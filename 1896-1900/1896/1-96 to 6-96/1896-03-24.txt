SPAIN GETTING
MORE INVOLVED
All Troubles Not Confined
to the Island of
Cuba.
CRISIS NOT FAR OFF.
With Exhausted Credit and the
Cortes Dissolved the Peril
Is Increased.
THE MONARCHY IS IN DANGER.
Meanwhile the Insurgents Continue to
Battle Bravely With the Hordes
of Oppressors.
HAVANA, Cuba. March 21 (via Tampa,
Tla., March 23).â Spain, with rebellion
growing apace in Cuba, tokens of coming
revolution at home, dangers of war with
the United States, exhausted credit and the
Cortes dissolved pending new elections, is
in a perilous position. Political leaders
here who are well informed say that the
crisis is not far off. One of the reformists
said to-day:
"When Canovas succeeded Sagasta the
Cuban rebellion was just begun, and Sa
easta, who was supported by the fii9ion
istÂ«, offered him support in whatever
war measures should be adopted to
suppress the trouble. But Canovas, evi
idently lacking confidence in tne support
of Sagasta and the fusionists, who with the
Republicans form a majority in the Cortes,
and fearing a coalition with the Carlists
and other dissatisfied factions for the pur
pose of crushing him, decided to dissolve
the Cortes, and with all the Government
machinery at hand obtain a victory over
his opponents by returning a majority in
hia favor in the new Cortes.
"With this end in view he consulted
General Weyler as to the possibility of
holding elections in Cuba. Weyler not
only replied that it was possible, but tele
graphed his guarantee that tbey would
take place. Then Canovas issued the de
cree dissolving the Spanish Parliament.
Now, when it has become manifest that no
elections can be held in Cuba and Sagasta
has taken a hand and denounced the
action of Canovas in allowing tne Cortes to
bÂ« dissolved at this critical period, the po
litical chaos that has followed is inde
wribibie. The reform and autonomist par
ties in Cuba have refused to take part in
a bogus election, and the reform party in
Spain talks of remaining away from the
polls, and what the outcome will be no
one can tell. It will not be surprising if
the Republicans, who have been gaining
in strength for some time, shonld improve
the opportunity to overthrow the mon
archy."
Many small encounters, but no import
ant battles are reported with numerous
bands of insurgents. The rebels are re
ported to have tired upon the forts at
Quivican, province of Havana. The towns
of Barrea, Bacurano and La Gallega, east
of Havana, were also attacced and stores
and several houses were burned. The
stores were plundered before the torch was
aDplied.
Among the rebels killed in the fight at
Ruby Hills were two of the insurgent
leaden. The rebels lost altogether eight
killed. In the recent engagement between
the rebels and the troops after the landing
of the filibustering expedition near Carde
nas, the insurgents lost eleven killed. The
troops had only two wounded.
General Bernal reports having had an
encounter with rebel parties led by Boges
and Aurelio Belancourt, who had assumed
the name of Civil Governor of the Province
of Havana. The fight took place on
Estrella plantation. Several insurgents
were captured. J. Frank Clark.

oners, all of whom will receive summary
court-martial. The insurgents burned six
ty-five houses at Punta Brava, ten miles
west of Havana, Saturday night. The
garrison of the town neld their position.
The Doshermanos and Begona estates, be

HFAiy IX ANGRY MOOD.
Will Jteaent Interference on the Part of
the United States.
MADRID, Spain. March 23.â The He
raldo to-day published an article stating
that Spain will never recognize the right
of an inquiry into Cuban affairs by an
American commission. The paper says
that war is preferable and that the nation
should resent most energetically an at
tempt at interference made by the United
States. f ;
Two articles that appear in the Epoca,
which are supposed to reflect, the views
of the Cabinet, have caused [ much com
men The first article â  challenges the
United States to cast aside its mask and to
Bho.v its colors. .... It says if America wants
war, Spain" is ready to meet it with" dignity.
If war is.not wanted, the American politi
cians ought to desist from their vextatious
debates.

whose interests are equally opposed to the
American claims. All the Madrid papers
concur in the belief that anything would
be better than uncertainty.
BARCELONA, Spain," March 23.â An
immense anti-American demonstration
took place here yesterday, In which 5000
persons participated. The crowd formed
in procession and marched to the French
consulate, where repeated cheers were
given for General Weyler and for Cuba.
The municipal band headed the procession
and played the national march. The
United States consulate was guarded by
the police, but was not visited by the
crowd.
AR3IS AXJj MJES ZAXDED.
Cheering >mÂ«i Received by the Cuban
Junta in Vetr York.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.â The
Cuban patriots.in this city were in a state
of great excitement over the announce
ment that an expedition of Brms and men
had safely landed in Cuba. The news
came by wire from Havana via Florida to
the Cuban Junta. One of the Cuban pa
triots, when asked by a reporter of the
United Press if the report was correct,
said:
"Commander Perez has reached Cuba
with thirty-seven men who are all ready
to give up their lives in the struggle
for Spain. It has been reported errone
ously that this expedition had landed.
Now we have the positive news that all are
In safety, with their munitions of war, in
cluding a large quantity of dynamite for
blowing up buildings, forts, ships, etc.' 7
It is reported that 600 Winchester rifles,
58.0U0 cartridges and two Hotchkiss can
non, together with a large quantity of
medicine, were landed.
SEEKIXG THE FILIBUSTERS.
Federal Authorities Trying to Head Off
Cuban Expeditions.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 23.â A Her
ald special from Key West, Fla., says:
The Federal authorities have been advised
of another filioustering expedition forming
in the vicinity of Cocoanut Grove, on the
east Florida coast, about a hundred miles
from this point, and are taking measures
to prevent its departure. Two special
agents of the Treasury Department have
been sent here and are assisting the local
officers in the matter.
The revenue steamer Winona arrived
yesterday from Tampa to co-operate with
the cutter McLane in patrolling the gulf.
The former left at noon in pursuit of the
schooners Delhi and Pearl, which are said
to have arms and ammunition aboard for
the expedition. Both schooners took
their supplies at the wharf unobserved, as
they supposed, but Spanish agents and
Federal officials were cognizant of their
plans and watched their movement?.
One sailed Saturday, while the other was
permitted to leave yesterday, being fol
lowed by the swift cutter Winona, whose
captain expects to capture both while at a
rendezvous transferring their cargo to
some vessel which is to carry the expedi
tion. The vessel is supposed to be the
steamer Three Friends, which left here
hurriedly several days sinre, having aboard
the balance of the arms she was prevented
from landing in Cuba on a former trip,
owing to the presence of the Spanish gun
boat Caridad. The Spanish warships con
tinue cruising in the gulf, and are visible
from the lookouts here.

Hans Maria yon Kadieh to-day left Mil
waukee on horseback en route to San Fran
cisco. He has started out to a trip
around the world in the interest of several
Berlin journals. The traveler adopts the
horse as a means of getting onward, as he
can study the people better in that way
than from the window of a Pullman. He
expects to reach the Pacific Coast about
the end of December. In San Francisco

ON THE GROUND
OF DESERTION
Chancellor McGill Grants a
Divorce to Drayton's
Wife.
THE HUSBAND BEATEN
Reasons for His Suspicions of
Infidelity Not Sufficient to
Win the Suit
NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION
Climax of a Scandal in High Life
That Could Only Culminate in-*
a Separation.
TRENTON, N. J., March 22.â Charlotte
Augusta, wife of J. Coleman Dray ton, re
ceived her decree of divorce from Chancel
lor McGill this morning. The decree was
tiled in the office of the clerk in chancery
and states that it is allowed on the ground
of desertion.
The opinion accompanying the decree is
a rather lengthy one. In it the Chancel
lor says that it is impossible to escape the
conviction that Mr. Drayton's suspicions
of his wife's infidelity were not destitute of
foundation in questionable circumstances,
at least, but the Chancellor continues there
is no decision holding that a husband may
with impunity be guilty of desertion of his
wife merely because of suspicion of her in
fidelity. Desertion is never justified ex
cept when it is shown by clear and satis
factory proof that he was so offended
against as to warrant, at his instance, a
decree for divorce or judicial separation.
â¢'lf his suit had been brought promptly
and in good faith after the separation,"
says the opinion, "the time consumed by
it, during which the law does not require
him to cohabit with his wife, would
not be computed as part of the statutory
period necessary to the desertion which
will authorize a decree for divorce, but its
mere institution after such statutory period
of desertion was complete will 'not avail
as a defense to a suit for divorce on the
ground of desertion. It was the husband's
duty to act expeditiously &o that hia wife
should not remain longer than necessity
required, if guilty, unconvicted, and if
innocent, under the shadow of a scandal
ous and disgraceful charge."
Chancellor McGill holds that there is no
proof of collusion between Mr. and Mrs.
Drayton to procure the divorce. It is not
collusion, he says, for them to wish their
matrimonial relations severed. The evi
dence in the case has not been filed, but
the Chancellor refers to it. Hallett Allsop
I linrrowes' name does not appear in his
references, but mention is made of one
"8., a neighbor," named'as co-respondent
in Mr. Drayton'g suit against. his wife.
The Chancellor reviews the troubles of the
family. One evening in October, 1891, he
says, upon Mrs. Drayton's return home
| from New York, her husband accused her
! of intimacy with one "B, a neighbor."
The next morning Mrs. Drayton went to
her father's house at Rhinebeck and there
she remained a month, when by persua
sion of her family the Draytons and their
four children went, to England. In that
country they lived nominally together,
Mr. Drayton adhering to his belief in his
wife's infidelity and refusing to share her
room or to accompany her . when she
would go out and refusing to remain in
her company when they would be alone.
It was in consequence of this state of af
fairs that Mrs. Drayton decided upon a
legal separation. She was much distressed
in mind and very unhappy. Having no
confidante in England she telegraphed to
America to "8.," who went at once to
England. Mrs. Drayton met him at her
hotel, and he arranged a meeting for her
with his lawyer at his hotel. She went to
the hotel, but the lawyer was late in
appearing, and Mrs. Drayton and ':B."
went into another room in which they
were attended by a waiter. While they
were at luncheon Mr. Drayton and two
men, evidently detectives, entered the
room, and after identifying her departed.
Later she saw the lawyer referred to, and
it was arranged between this lawyer and
husband that she would go to Wimbledon,
where' her children were and bid them
good-by. She did so, ana made several
trips to Paris to see her father, by whom
she was persuaded, for the sake of her
children, to seek a reconciliation with fier
husband. She exerted every effor; to
effect a reconciliation, but Mr. Drayton
was obdurate, still insisting >that she had
been unfaithful to her marriage vows.
The Chancellor says that the separation
of Mr. and Mrs. Drayton was of more than
two years' duration, and that the deser
tion was willful, continued and obstinate.
J nines McVieker** Will.
. CHICAGO, 111., March 23.â The will of
the late James McVicker, the theatrical
veteran, was filed in Probate Court to-day.
The estate is actually valned at $750,000,
but only a third of it is shown in the court
record ' because $500,000 worth of his
property was given to his widow before his
death, $350,000 of it being in McVicker's
Theater stock. All. the remainder is left
to Mrs. McVicker and the only son,

< DUBOIS, Pa., March 23.â The first
gr*at mining disaster in this neighbor
hood during all the fifteen years of mining
occurred at 9:20 o'clock this morning at
the Berwind-White shaft, just east of
town. It came in the form of an explo
sion of mine gas and resulted in the death
of thirteen men, all of Dubois. <
The names of the deed are as follows:
James Graham St., James Graham Jr.,
who was working with' his father; John
Monroe, George Postlewaithe, Jesse
Postlewaithe, Henry Harvey, George Har
vey, Harry Smith, Lindsey F. Bradley,
Andrew Mowak, David Bell, Reuben
Noble and Georee Ainsley.
All of the dead leave families except
James Graham Jr. As soon as the explo
sion occurred and before the extent of the
disaster was known messengers were sent
into town to summon all of the physicians
who could be found. When the news
reached Rochester mines, which are three
miles from the shaft, the men who were
working there rightly divined that the
services of good practical men would be
wanted under the ground and about forty
at once came out and started to the shaft.
Conveyances were found for some and
others went as far as they could in the
streetcars and walked the remainder of the
way. Superintendent Reed of the Regis
ter mines followed, and as soon as he ar
rived at the shaft went below with a cage
full of bis own men. The air was so bau
below that the men, who went down in
gangs of tea, could not stay long at a time,
but the opening- seemed to clear up later
on and better progress in getting at the
extent of the disaster was made.
About 1000 people were at the scene in
an hour, including many of the friends of
those underground, but as far as possible
the reports were kept from the families of
those who were dead until the bodies could
be recovered.
Seventeen men went down the shaft at 7
o'clock in the morning, thirteen going
into a heading north of the shaft and the
other four in the opposite direction, and
the latter, with the mine boss, were the
only ones to escape the terrific shock. The
four men wefe half a mile away from the
shaft, and shortly after 9 o'clock they felt
wha+ ihoy believed was the shock follow
ing an explosion of gas.
Immediately after Mine Boss Harvey
came running toward them and directed
them to hurry to the foot of the shaft.
When they came to the shaft they ran into
a body of gas and knew that . there bad
been an explosion. Them first effort was
to put up some brattices which had been
bjown off by the explosion, hoping that it
might possibly have the effect of turning
an air current to their comrades in other
parts of the mine, but before they had ac
complished much they were overcome by
gas and had to be taken up in the cage,
one of them being in a very serious condi
tion. Then it was that the news reached
the outside world.
The shaft is close to 300 feet deep and
for some time there has been known to be
traces of gas in the chambers, but precau
tionary measures were observed to avoid a
disaster. Tbe mine is a new one and is
yet in early stages of development, and for
that reason, there were no. more men at
work at the time of the explosion.
Twelve of the thirteen bodies have been
recovered from the shaft. It.is not known
whether the remaining body is that of
Bell or Noble, as the body of the last
victim brotight to the surface is mutilated
beyond recognition.
SHOCKED BUSINESS CIRCLES.
Failure of a Big Manufacturing Firm
at St. Louis. , .
- ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 23.â The busi
ness circles of this city received a shock
this afternoon by the announcement that
Kingsland & Douglas, formerly Kingsland
<fe Ferguson, manufacturers of agricultural
implements, had gone to the wall. The
assets and business of the firm were placed
in the bands of Charles W. Bates, attorney
for the creditors, under a deed of trust this
afternoon. The principal creditor is the
Mechanics' Bank, for $64,500. The aggre
gate of the other claims is $41,500, carried
Dy thirty-five firms and persons. Two
years ago the firm increased its stock from
$100,000 to $250,000, and Mr. Ferguson,
president of the bank, withdrew from the
firm. The business is remunerative, cov
ering the entire world in shipments, and it
is assured that the firm will liquidate dol
for dollar. j

RACED AGAINST
A RAGING FIRE
The British Bark Alexan
dra Almost Burned
at Sea.
HER CARGO CAUGHT FIRE
Captain Barfield Nearly Lost
His Leg Through an Ex
ploding Rocket.
FIRING SIGNALS OF DISTRESS.
Brave Work Done by Pilot F. W.
Jordan and Captain Haskell of
the Fearless.
One of the most exciting scenes wit
nessed in the habor for many a day was
presented to /ill who happened to be on the
water front about 7 o'clock yesterday even
ing. The big tug Fearless, with the Brit
ish bark Alexandra and the schooner
Helen N. Kimball in tow, was rushing
through the Golden Gate, while the tug
Vigilant was racing down the bay to meet
them.
The Alexandra was on lire and her hail
was at a red heat, while volumes of smoke
and steam poured from her open hatches.
The wooden deck had in places been burnt
away and below was a glowing mass of
coal.
Off Meiggs wharf the schooner was cast
adrift, and then both the tugs got along
side the burning ship and began pumping
water into her. At the same time they
were going full speed and soon had the
burning bark on the mud flats near the
sugar refinery. Eight streams of water
were then poured into her hold and grad
ually the nre was got under control. The
pumping was kept up all eight, However,
and it was only when ail appearance of
danger was over that the work of clearing
the ship was begun.
The Alexandra was on her way from
Newcastle, N. S. W., for Fort Los Angeles,
and the following extracts from the cap
tain's log tell the story in brief:
Thursday, March 19â In the afternoon no.
ticed a strong smell of coal gas coming up the
after hatch, but could not find any sign of fire
in the hold.
Friday, 20, at 5 a. m., upon opening the lau
rette hatch volumes of smoke issued out.
Roused all hands out and opened after hatch.
Found that in the same condition â dense
smoke coming up. At once proceeded to get
up some stores, at great risk to officers and
crew, they being repeatedly driven back by the
gas and smoke.
| .'At daylight the schooner Helen X. Kimball
was close by. The fire seemed now to be burn
ing fiercely around the mainmast, pitch boil
ing out of the seams and decks starting. So I
requested the captain of the schooner to stand
by me and I would try to get the ship to San
Francisco if possible. He agreed to do so.
Saturday, 21stâ Light winds and fine fire at
times bursting through the decks. Keeping it
under by pouring a quantity of water down.
Sunday, 5 r. m.â Sighted the Fa ra Hones;
calms and light winds.
Monday, 22d, 10 a. m.â Sighted the tug Fear
less, and made arrangements with the captain,
to tow the vessel in and put her on the mud
fiat and fill her with water. Arrived at the
flat at 8 o'clock.
When the Alexandra was away beyond
the Farallones she was sighted by the
pilot-boat America. Captain F. W. Jor
dan saw that the bark was on fire, but he '
never paused for an instant. The yawl
was called away, and he at once set out
for the Alexandra. About three miles
away was the tug Fearless, and Captain
Dan Haskell, using his new speaking- ,
trumpet, said, "Hold on a minute, Jor
dan, and I'll go with you."
The pilot heard the words distinctly and j
waited. When they got aboard the bark
they found the crew huddled forward, the
boats all provisioned and ready for launch
ing, and all the clothing and effects on the
schooner Helen N. Kimball.
Captain Jordan took command, and it j
did not take long to get a hawser aboard j
the Fearless. Captain Haskell was never ,
more cool or collected in his life, and it
did not take him long to get everything
shipshape and start the race for San Fran
cisco. The big tag took the bark through
the water at the rate of twelve knots an i
hour, and the speed made the fire in the
hold burn more fiercely. The signal flags
were all in the schooner, so the lookout at
Point Lobos could not make out the ves
sel, and for a time there was a great deal
of wonderment on 'Change.
Off Fort Point Captain Haskell began te ]
signal for assistance, and in response a
telephone message was sent to the office
of the towboats at Folsom-street wharf,
and the Vigilant was sent out.
Captain Barfield was a very sick man ,
last evening when seen aboard. He could
not use his right leg and his cabin was so
permeated with the fumes of the burning j
coal that it was almost unbearable. When j
tne fire was discovered the schooner Helen |
N. Kimball was sighted in the distance.
Captain Barfield signaled her to stand by
him as he was in distress, but the captain I
of the schooner having no code could not
read the nags. Then Captain Barfield de- ]
termined to fire a rocket, and in doing so '
the charge exploded and almost blew hit
leg off.
In spite of his injuries Captain Barfield j
got another rocket leady, but before it !
could be fired the schooner came up in the
wind and stood over toward the burning |
ship. When she came alongside, or as
near as she could approach with safety,
the master was engaged to stand by the
Alexandra until assistance came or she
had to be abandoned.
The crew wanted to leave her at once,
but Barfield would not have it, and in
spite of his wounded leg kept watch and
ward over everything. When Captain
Jordan came aboard he heaved a sigh of
relief and turned the command over to the
pilot.
Captain Barfield is well known on Puget j
Sound. For eight years he was master ol \
the Hudson Bay Company's ships Princess
Royal and Prince Rupert and made many j2
a voyage in them to Victoria and Vancou
ver, B. C.
"We had very heavy weather after leav
ing Newcastle, N. S. W.," said he, "and I
suppose that is what caused our trouble.
The rolling started the spontaneous com
bustion and we suffered in consequence. It
was lucky for us that the tire did not
occur in mid-ocean."
The tugs Fearless and Vigilant will re
main by the Alexandra all night and to
day she will be pumped out and floated.
WHITE'S MOTION IS DEFEATED.
Passage of the Bill Amending the Diseases
of Animals Act in the House of
Commons.
LONDON, Eng., March 23.â 1n the
House of Commons to-day M. J. White,
Liberal member for Forfarshore, moved
the rejection ot the bill amending the dis
eases of animals act of 1894 introduced by
Walter H. Long, president of the Board of
Agriculture, who proposes making the re
strictions placed on the importation of
cattle permanent instead of leaving them
to the discretion of the Board of Agricul
ture.
Mr. Robert John Price, member for the
East division of Norfolk, seconded the
motion. He said the bill was a serious
menace to Canadian trade and would in
jure the eraziers of the United Kingdom.
It was protection of breeders against
feeders.
Dr. Long, the introducer of the bill, said
the sole object of the measure was to give
to the owners of breeding stock in the
United Kingdom security, without which
they could not carry on their industry.
The symptoms of pleuro-pneumonia, he
said, were very obscure and difficult of
detection. The Board of Agriculture felt
that they could not adequately perform
their duty under present conditions and
asked Parliament to relieve them of a part
of their task through the bill.
Sir Albert Kaye Rollit (Conservative)
declared that the bill committed the coun
try to protection. It was certain to evoke
public opposition when its real character
became known. He hoped It was not too
late to reconsider the measure.
The Right Hon. James Bryce, formerly
president of the Board of TVade, and the
Right Hon. A. J. Mundella. also an ex
president ot that body, were among those
who opposed the bill. The Right Hon. A.
J. Balfour, First Lord of the Treasury, and
Government leader in the House, defended
the measure. He denied that it was a
protective bill. â¢ â¢
Mr. White's motion was defeated by a
vote of 244 to 95. Many of the members
abstained from voting. The bill then
passed its second reading without a divi
sion.
BRUTALITY TO STOWAWAYS
Two Men Manacled and Exposed
in a Cage on a Steamer's
Deck.
Longshoremen Protested in a Vain
Attempt to Secure Mercy for
the Unfortunates.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23. -A. Re
corder special from Boston says: Tbe
steamship Parkman sailed for Liverpool
yesterday afternoon with two stowaways
aboard. The terrible treatment to which
they were subjected nearly caused a riot
among the longshoremen, who attempted
to rescue them from their chains.
For seven days and. seven nights the
two young men were chained to iron bars
in an open iron pen on the deck, exposed
to all the changes of the weather, and
when the Parkman steamed out of port
they were still there, notwithstanding the
attempts to arouse the authorities to
action. Respite is promised, however, as
soon as the steamer reaches the open sea,
where there is no possibility of escape of
the luckless lads. They will then be lib
erated from their shackles and put down
in the hold with the cattle.
Manacled to tne cold iron in cramped
positions in the narrow den, they had
nothing softer upon which to lie than an
iron grating covered only by a thin piece
of bagging, which failed to prevent the
metal bars from sinking into their flesh.
One man gave his name as Louis William
Key, aged 21. He was barefooted, and
said he was a Russian Hebrew. The other,
John Walsh, aged 25, hails from London.
His feet were incased in the uppers of an
old pair of rubber boots.
The longshoremen were the first to give
information as to the condition of the men.
One of them called on the Immigration
Commissioner. He in turn telephoned to
the steamship offices, and Captain Reed,
who was there, answered that "the men
were quite comfortable."
Immigration Commissioner Delehanty
was asked why such proceedings had been
allowed. He explained that it has been
usual in such cases for the captains of
ships burdened with stowaways to take the
unwelcome fellows to the nearest police
station and pay for their board during
their stay in port. In this case the cap
tain pleaded that he could not afford to
pay the price the city charges for board at
the ttation-house. The charge is $2 per
day for each man. The company will not
assume any expense connected with stow
aways. Consequently it must come out of
tbe captain's own pocket.
The longshoremen are indignant over
the brutal treatment of the two prisoners,
who spent a week iv irons, almost naked,
and exposed to the winds and sleet. They
ask for an international investigation, and
propose to call the captain to a strict ac
counting.
WITH A CARGO OF PHOSPHATES.
The Barkentine Patterson Probably Lost
Jf-uring a Gait.
BALTIMORE, Md., March 23.â The
barkentine Robert S. Patterson, which
sailed from Punta Gorda, Fla., January 28
for Baltimore, is believed to have been
lost. Tbe vessel carried a cargo of phos
phate rock. She was commanded by Cap
tain Tunnell of Philadelphia, and carried a
crew of fifteen men, who were shipped
from tbe Quaker City. Captain Tunnell
was the managing owner of the vessel.
There is every piobability that the vessel
has been lost in one of the severe gales
which have swept the Atlantic Coast
recently.

Rights to Patriots.
MILLS MAKES A NEW MOVE.
Joint Resolution Asking Spain to
Grant Natives the Power of Local
Self' Government.
WASHINGTON D. C, March 23.-On
the desk of Senator Blackburn there stood
this morning wnen the Senate convened a
massive piece of floral work representing
â as near as such a representation could
be made with flowers â the coat-of-arms of
the State of Kentucky. It was a testi
monial from the Democratic -Senators of
the chamber. The flowers were beautiful,
but the combination was far from being
artistic In addition to tttis Senator Black
burn received a magnificent horseshoe and
a bunch of cut roses. The latter was from
Mrs. Senator Squire.
Gallinger (R.j of New Hampshire, pre
sented very numerous petitions and papers
from clergymen, medical men and educa
tors in favor of setting apart a Govern
ment reservation for the benefit of persons
suffering from pulmonary diseases in the
North, who might be benefited by a
change of climate to the salubrious atmos
phere of the Rocky Mountain regions;
and he introduced a bill setting apart the
Fort Stanton military reservation in New
Mexico. He spoke in favor of the proposi
tion, which is under the lead of the Amer
ican Invalid Aid Society of Boston. The
bill was referred.
On motion of Sherman (R.) of Ohio the
conference report on the Cuban resolu
tions was taken up. Palmer had just
begun his speech against the report when
Sherman broke in with a notice that he
would, at the conclusion of Palmer's
speech, ask unanimous consent to have
the conference report disagreed to and
another conference asked for.
Palmer objected. Palmer recalled the
anecdote of the man who ran so fast to
get in out of the rain that he fell, and
when asked why ne ran so fast said that
he was afraid the rain would be over I
before he got into shelter. The applica
tion of the anecdote was that he (Palmer)
thought the matter might be adjusted and
withdrawn from the Senate before he
would have an opportunity to make his
remarks. [Laughter.]
He said the whole undertone of the res
olutions was unfriendly to the Government
of Spain and that the whole procedure
was in a spirit of unfriendliness to the
Spanish Government. The language em
ployed was undiplomatic. It has given
offense and would give offense. Referring
to Sherman's outburst, asking where, out of
hell, was there war if there was not war in
Cuba? Palmer said that there was mur
der there, slaughter, violence, destruction
of property, but that was not war. The
insurgents were still unorganized. If they
were recognized by the United States as
belligerents it would follow that the United
States conceded that the Spanish Govern
ment would no longer be held responsible
for injuries to the person and property of |
American citizens in Cuba, and that the
United States must hereafter look to the
insurgent government for the protection
of Americans there or for indemnity for
wrongs done them.
At the close of Palmer's speech a joint
resolution was introduced by Mills (D.) of
Texas directing the President of the
United States to request the Government
of Spain to grant to the people of Cuba the
power of local self-government, and, in
case the Government of Spain shall refuse,
to take possession of the island of Cuba
and to bold it until its inhabitants can in
stitute such government as they may wish
to organize and to raise such forces as
may be necesssry to support it. He gave
notice that he would address the Senate
to-morrow on that joint resolution.
By unanimous consent the Senate dis
agreed to the conference report on the
Cuban resolutions.
Sherman then moved that the Senate
insist upon its amendments and ask a fur
ther conference with the House. That
motion, which is debatable, wa3 then dis
cussed by Allen. In concluding his speech
Allen said :
"A few days ago Senators were falling
over one another to get an opportunity to
vote for these Cuban resolutions. There
was then a wonderful burst of patriotic
sentiment here. Republicans and Demo
crats (and Populists, a little inspired, too,)
wanted to demonstrate to the world that
we not only sympathized with Cuba, but
were willing, if need be, to afford her sub
stantial aid. And yet our patriotism has
been sifting out from that moment till it
is very doubtful whether the resolutions
can pass to-day. First came the Senator
from Maine (Hale) antagonizing the reso
lutions. Then came the Senator from
Massachusetts (Hoar). And finally the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Relations (Sherman) has considered. I
guess, that it is about time for him to re
treat, and we are offered this resolution
now to recommit the matter to a confer
ence committee and I supposa that that
will be the end of it."
Sherman's resolution that the Senate in
sist upon its disagreement to the House
amendment to the resolutions of the Sen
ate in regard to the insurrection in Cuba
and ask for a further conference was then
agreed to without a division, and Senators
Sherman (R.)of Ohio, Morgan (D.) of Al
abama and Lodge (R.) of Massachusetts
were appointed conferees on the part of
the Senate.
George (D.) of Massachusetts said that
he was one of the six Senators who-had
voted against the original resolutions, and
desired to give one reason for his doing so
â tnat was that, in his judgment, their
subject-matter belonged to the executive
and not to the legislative branch of the
Government. He believed that there was
no exigency whatever that could justify
or even palliate, an assumption by one de
partment of the Government of the pow
ers and duties which were by the constitu
tion assigned to another and different de
partment.
IliÂ« legislative, executive and judicial
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
appropriation bill was taken up, but its
consideration was interrupted by the offy
ing of a concurrent resolution by Platt(R.)
of Connecticut in relation to Cuba, in these
words: li The Senate hereby expresses its
earnest desire and hope that Cnba may
soon become a free, independent and re
publican Government, and that the
friendly offices of the United States shall
be offered by the President to the Spanish
Government to secure such results."
The resolution was referred to the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
The consideration of the legislative ap
propriation bill was proceeded with until
a paragraph was reached providing com
pensation for "a skilled laborer." On in
quiry by Peffer (Pop.) of Kansas it turned
out that this skilled laborer was a barber,
and when Peffer objected to the foutlay
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire dis
charged some of his witty shafts at the
Kansas Senator, whose length of beard is
proverbial. This "skilled laborer," he
said, was needed to shave other Senators
if not to shave the Senator from Kansas.
"My idea," said Peffer, "is to get rid of
these Senate barbers." The item was not
'altered.
An item for the appointment of three
clerks and one laborer in tbe State Depart
ment to be selected by tne Secretary of
State, by reason of special aptitude, was
attacked by Gorman (D.) of Maryland as
an attempt to escape from the civil service
rule promulgated by the President with
the approval of the Secretary of State. He
(Gorman) was not in favor of the sweep
ing civil service rules that had been made,
but so long as they were in force there
was no reason why the Secretary of State
should escape from them.
After discussion, tbe words objected to
were stricken out.
After having disposed of about thirty of
the 135 paragraphs of the bill, the Senate
held a brief executive session and at 5:30
adjourned until to-morrow.
SESSIOy OF THE HOUSE.
i An Amendment to the Bill for Leasing
. Arizona School Lands. . -X. :'
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.âTo
day's session of the House, was under the
rules, given up to District of Columbia
business, but the District calendar was
soon cleared and the remainder of : the
session was spent in the consideration of a
bill to modify the existing law regarding
the punishment of crimes committed in
Federal jurisdiction involving the death
penalty so as to allow a sentence to prison
for life. After a three-hours' discussion
the passage of the bill was frustrated by a
I point of no quorum made by Barrett (R.) of
: Massachusetts and the House adjourned
until to-morrow. . 'â '.
In the morning "hours bills were passed
authorizing the construction fof various
bridges, authorizing the ' leasing of school
lands in Arizona and exempting logging
trains from the law requiring patent
couplers and air brakes.
The bill authorizing the leasing of school
lands in Arizona was amended by prohib
iting the cutting of timber thereon ' and
limiting â¢ the number of acres -to each
lessee so as to remove the objections of the
President in vetoing a bill on the same
lines. ___^_^_____Â»
WITNESSES MUST TESTIFY
An Important Case Decided by
the United States Su
preme Court.
No Longer Can Testimony Be Dodged
in the Interstate Commerce
Questions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.-ThÂ»
Supreme Court of the United States to
day decided that witnesses must testify in
interstate commerce cases, or go to jail for
contempt of court. The decision was made
in the case of Brown vs. Walker, appealed
from the Circuit Court for the Western
District of Pennsylvania, involving the
validity and force of the amendment to
the interstate commerce law, intended to
make effective the provision forbidding the
secret and illegal granting of rebates to
favored shippers by railroad officials.
It was impossible, under the decision in
the Hitchcock-Counselman case, to suc
cessfully prosecute a case, because the
only parties to the transaction who could
testify could claim the constitutional
privilege of refusing to give evidence on
the ground that it would tend to incrimi
nate themselves.
To remedy this situation the amend
ment in question was made, providing
hat no person who testified as to any
such transaction should be prosecuted for
his part in it.
Under this new provision Theodore F.
Brown, auditor of the Allegheny Valley
Railroad Company, was called to testify in
a case of alleged illegal rebate before the
United States District Court for the West
ern District of Pennsylvania. He declined
to testify on constitutional ground, but
the court held that under the new law he
was required to give his evidence, not
withstanding the constitutional provis
ions. Declining still to testify, the witness
was committed to the custody of the Mar
shal for contempt of court. Thereupon he
sued out a writ of habeas corpus in the
Circuit Court and his release was refused.
He then appealed to the Supreme Court of
the United States.
The case was argued in January, and
Justice Brown delivered the opinion of
the court. He said that the constitutional
provision was susceptible to two construc
tions â one literally protecting the witness
from requirement to testify under any
conditions, the other was such that the
operation of a law giving protection to a
witness against prosecution for a crime of
which he may testify would entirely sat
isfy the clause in the constitution.
The opinion discussed the operation of
the laws and decisions bearing upon the
statute in question, both in England and
in this country. The conclusion of the
court was that while the constitutional
provision was one of the most valuable
safeguards of the citizen the statutory
protection fully conforms to its require
ments and that the witness in the case at
bar must testify. The judgment of the
Circuit Court wa3 affirmed.
Justices Field, Gray, Shiraa and White
dissented. .^
Xnminated. by the President.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.-The

Company Narrowly Escape
. Destruction.
COLON, Colombia, March 23.â A fire
started here at 4 o'clock this morning, and
before it was got under control half of the
city had been burned. The spread of the
flames was aided by a strong wind that
carried large pieces of burning material
onto tne roofs of houses, which were soon
destroyed in a conflagration that at one
time threatened to wipe out the entire
city. By 10 o'clock all the buildings south
of Seventh street as far as the market, had
been destroyed, and shortly afterward the
market itself was burned.
Among the buildings destroyed was
Hafeman's pharmacy. It was then con
sidered that the only buildings that were
out of danger were the Swiss Casino and
the offices of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. The fire extended down to the
the railroad station and for a time that
building was in imminent danger, but the
firemen thought they might be able to
save it.
The fire brigade of Panama was asked
for aid iv fighting the tire and came here
on a special train, accompanied by the
chief authorities.
Traffic of the Panama Railroad was com
pletely suspended later in the day. All tbe
bakeries have been burned and a scarcity
of food is threatened. Intense excitement
prevails. The captain and crew of the
Colombian line steamer Finance rendered
valuable aid in checking the spread of
flames. It is impossible as yet to learn
the full extent of the loss, but it will be
very heavy, probably in excess of $300,000.

11:15 o'clock last night fire broke out in
the elevator shaft of the four-story build
ing occupied by the Washburn-Halligan
Coffee Company, at 115 East Second street.

inflammable nature of the stock.
At I o'clock this morning the Washburn-
Halligan building is a complete ruin, and
the plant of the Daily Leader, which oc
cupied the front portion of the west half
of the double structure, is in flames and
will probably be almost a total loss.
The loss on stock of the Washburn-
Halligan Company is $120,000; insurance,
$38,000. The Joss on the building will be
about $15,000. Tbe Washburn-Halligan

THE LITERARY BURGLAR.
Stzelecki's Woes May Be Increased by a
Divorce Suit.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 23.-A Jour
nal special from Boston says: Another
trouble haunts Charles S. Stzelecki, the
literary burglar. He is now threatened
with being made the co-respondent in a
divorce suit brought by Frank L. Tupper,
a Tremont-street confectioner, with whom
he boarded. Mrs. Tupper has already sued
on the ground of extreme cruelty. The
cases will be heard in May. Mrs, Tupper
is an extremely handsome young woman
of education and refinement.
"Mr. Stzelecki has nothing to do with
my domestic troubles," said she yesterday.
"I first became acquainted with him when
assisting my husband in the store. When
Mr. Tupper and I separated I furnished a
flat and took in lodgers, among whom were
Mr. Stzelecki and Mr. Gurley. I have
always liked Mr. Stzelecki, and for that
matter like him still. I have visited him
since his arrest. Many of his presents to
me were stolen, but they have been given
to the police. It was a great shock to me
when his guilt was proved."
Mr*. Tupper is the daughter of a wealthy
San Francisco building contractor, and has
a brother practicing dentistry in Chicago.
Frank L. Tupper, in speaking of the mat
ter, said: "I felt that sooner or later my
wife's acquaintance with this man would
become known. I'll tell the court* what I
! know of my wife and Stzelecki."
PASSENGER AVEXIS TO MEET.
Important Matter* delating to the Trunk
Lines.
CHICAGO, 111., March 23.â Orders were
received from the Board of Control of the
Joint Traffic Association in New York to
day calling a joint meeting of the Trunk
Line passenger agents with the Central
passenger committee in this city next
Thursday, to act on several important
; mattef s of rates referred to it by the execu
tive officers of the Trunk Line Association.
Since the first of the year these joint meet
ings have been held in New York.
The Chicago Great Western road, which
has been in an independent mood since
the thirty-day limit was refused the Grand
Army encampment, notified the Western
Passenger Association chairman to-day
that it would in ten days accept second
class tickets on first-class tourists between
Minneapolis and Kansas City, relief having
been refused by the chairman, who also
refused to accept the notice on the ground
that it was not a subject for relief under
the agreement. The company also asked
for authority to do the same thing be
tween Chicago and Kansas City, because
it ran no tourist cars, but this was refused.
The Great Western may be laying the
foundation for a bolt from the association,
although entering a disclaimer.
HOUSE TO BOUSE COLLECTION.
A 2Teu> Mail Method to Be Tried in San
Francisco.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 23.â First
Assistant Posknaster-General Jones said
to the Call correspondent to-day that San
Francisco was one of twenty-five cities at
which the experiment of house to house
collection of the mails would be tried. It
has been in. operation in St. Louis and ac
cording to Mr. Jones has been quite suc
cessful.
The inventor of the box is Mr. Cushing,
who is now in this city. The box was pat
terned closely 'after those now in use in
England, where the House to house col
lection plan is in vogue. It is proposed to
put one of these boxes at each Business
and dwelling house where request is made
by occupants, the latter to pay the cost
of the same. The plan has been on trial
here in Washington for several years and
is an absurdity, according to postoffice
employes.

LIKE A MAN
Are the People in the State of Wash-
ington Remarkable?
There Is One Who Will Tell the
Truth Every Time. \
TS THE WORLD FULL OF LIARS? THAT
.-*â  seems a curious query, but by "a liar" is not
meant hero exclusively or even particularly a falsi-
fier. . A lie . has j been very properly defined as an
attempt to deceive, ana those "who damn with
faint praise" when the whole truth would serve the
case are very evidentlyâ if this definition, be cor-
rectâliars. The term is a harsh one to use, doubt
less, but there are cases In which it is Justifiable
Let ns take as an instance that of a man who bat
been ill, and on meeting a friend he is asked what
accounts for his . Improved appearance. He will
say, perhaps, that he "never was very ill," but
that Dr. So-and-So had "visited him once or
twice." Now, if he is recovering from a danger-
ous illness that man might in all justice be termed
a liar. But speaking, of this class of prevari-
cators is reminiscent of the fact that they do not
seem to be plentiful in the State of Washington.
Take the instance of George H. Rice, who some
few months ago was on the verge of a most serious
and vital nervous trouble. He lives at Fort
Canby, Wash., and when he was fully aware as to
; how sad a state he was in be applied to that grand
medical institute, the Hudson, and being told thai
bad as his case was it was curaole, he placed him-
self unreservedly In the hands of the specialist*
â  there. Here is what he has to say when asked as
to the result of the treatment :
Fobt Canby, Wash., Aug. 5, 1895.
â¢ â  Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco, Cal.â
1 Gentleman: Your favor of July 30 is at hand, and
I thought I had written you long ago, but as I have
not done so perhaps this will do.
' The treatment from the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute Is all that could be expected or desired by any
one, as your medicine has, I think, established a
perfect cure in my case, and 1 hope and think it
will be permanent. I am unable to speak the
praise it deserves, but suffice to It gay that I feel in
every respect as a man should. Very respectfully,
â  GEORGE H. RICE.
Now, there is the manly and straightforward let-
ter that a Washingtonlan has written when he
was simply asked as to what was the result of bis
going to that Mecca for all the sickâ the Hudson,
Medical Instituteâ and it Is worthy of him in that
it speaks tbe truth out plainly. But Mr. Rice is
by no | means the only one who speaks out fear-
lessly when asked to state what has been done for
him. Thousands join him in praising this great
Institution. â 
IK.1 K. C Taf t of Stowe, Cal., writes: "I am feeling
fine, with not a sign of the disease now."
.> A. JJurton of Grass Valley: "The medicine that
I took did me lots of good."
S. J. Bailey of Weaver says: "After two
months' treatment with you I feel fully restored
to health."
| Mr. J. T. Ward of Park City, Utah, says: "I am
cured of the terrible disease that I had."
Day by dayâ hour by hourâ these convinc-
ing statements come to the managers of the Hud-
son Medical Institute, and they must be taken as
proof positive that there is hope for every one till
the famous specialists of the Hudson Medical In-
stitute say that YOU HAVE AM INCURABLE
DISEASE. FJ;;S

RALLY OF DELEGATES.

Metropolis.
M'KINLEY MEN VERY ACTIVE.
Although a Blizzard Rages People
Turn Ont to Hear the Ohioan
Eulogized.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23. â The
preparations for the launching of the Mor
ton boom were completed to-day, and
there is every indication that the senti
ment of the Empire State Republicans
will be voiced by to-morrow's convention
in a manner that will attract the attention
of the nation. Notwithstanding the dis
comfort and uncertainty of traveling at
this season of the year, no more thoroughly
representative body of Republicans ever
met in this State than that which is ex
pected to assemble to-morrow noon to
present New York's favorite son as a can
didate for President. Hundreds of men
who have for years participated in the
councils of the party, and thousands of
younger men. who compose its active
working force in their several localities,
are gathered here to testify to their ad
miration for Governor Morton.
New York entertains many visiting
Statesmen and politicians every day, but a
political convention is something of a
novelty. While all the parties conduct
their National and State campaigns from
this city, they have been in the habit of
going elsewhere to nominate their candi
dates. Whether or not it was considered
by the committee in naming New York as
the place of this convention, it is thought
lining by many of the delegates that the
metropolis, with whose social and com
mercial life Levi P. Morton had been so
intimately associated, should be the start
ing point of hi 3 formal entrance into the
field as a Presidential candidate. The
holding of a convention in New York is as
much of a novelty to the delegates as to
tbe city. Instead of being confined to one
or two hotels they have scores from which
to choose, and the result is such a 6calter
ing of the visitors that it is difficult for
them to realize that they are attending a
State convention. They seem to enjoy the
new experience of plenty of elbow room
and breathing space.
Since noon to-day it has been snowing
hard, and from present appearances to
morrow will be equally disagreeable. The
Grand Central Palace, at the corner of
Lexington avenue and Forty-third street,
in whicbf the convention will be held, is a
spacious auditorium with two galleries
and as arranged for this occasion will have
seating capacity for 6000 people. A por
trait of Governor Morton, flanked on
either side by the State and city flags,
occupies the position of honor above the
proscenium arch, but otherwise the deco
rations are entirely of the National colors.
The arrangement of the details of work
to be done by the convention has proceeded
under unusual difficulties to-day on ac
count of the indisposition of ex- Senator
Platt and Chairman Hackett of the State
committee. Mr. Platt, whose side is still
sore from the effects his fall last Friday,
remained in his room all day, seeing few
visitors. He hones, however, to be able to
attend the convention.
The convention will assemble at noon,
and after the address of Senator Cornelius
R. Parsons, as temporary chairman, and
the appointment of committees, a recess
will be taken probably until 8 p. m. At
the evening session, after tbe report of the
committee on contested seats, the per
manent organization will be effected with
Congressman George R. Southwick as
chairman. The business of the conven
tion will occupy but a small part of the
evening, but after it is concluded, the con
vention will be resolved into a ratification
meeting. Ex-Senator J. Sloat Fassett.
Edward Lauterbach and other prominent
orators of the party are expected to speak.
EULOOIEB FOR McKUfLET.
Anti-Flatt Jif publicans at a Monster
Mat*- Meeting.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.â The
McKinley boom in New York City was
launched to-night at Cooper Union, and
although the weather was very inclement
and a miniature blizzard raging outside
the big hall was paefced with people. In
the center of the platform was a crayon
picture of ex-Governor McKinley. The
frame was made of tin-plates to remind
the audience what McKinley had done for
the "tin" industry of the United States.
At the bottom of the picture was a banner
on which was inscribed the following:
"The anti-machine Republican organiza
tion of the city and county of New York."
On the right of the platform was a ban
ner un which was inscribed the words:
"The Republican party stands for an
honest dollar and the way to earn it," and
on the left was another banner bearing the
words: "William McKinley, prosperity's
advance agent." The anti-Platt element
was present in considerable force.
Major L. H. Jerome called the meeting
to order and nominated W. G. Swayne for
chairman. In doing so Major Jerome
said:
"It does not require a Daniel tc read; the
writing on the wall, 'President of the
United States.' under that picture of Mr.
McKinley. It has become evident that the
â¢favorite son' candidacy of this State will
not materialize. It is therefore necessary
a 9 well as politic for the Republicans of
New York to declare themselves for one
who will lead the victorious ranks of the
Republicans next November, That is the
object of this meeting. It is useless for
politicians to ignore figures of the returns
that are coming in from all the States or
to try and juggle them into anything but
an overwhelming majority for McKinley.
The cry from now on until success crowns
us next November will be the people of
the United States against bosses and boss
ism, with McKinle? for our standard
bearer.
"McKinley, the advance agent of pros
perity, the friend of tAe working-maii, is
the embodiment of all that the ReDublican
party holds most dear, They are as fol
lows: 'Honest payment of tbe National
debt with the best money'; 'sound cur
rency for the people's use.' McKinley's
opponents to-day in this city and State
and the country generally are the men
who have debauched and besmirched the
good name of the Republican party by
fraudulent enrollments and primaries. His
enemies are our enemies. His friends are
our friends. His principles are our prin
ciplesâthe eternal principles of the Re
publican partyâ and with him as our
. leader our success is assured."
General Swayne received a most en
thusiastic greeting. He denounced ring
parties, and said McKinley was against
the machine. Governor Morton's name
was hissed once when General Swayne
mentioned It; but the speaker quickly
repressed the hissing and said that Gov
ernor Morton had rendered valuable ser
vice to the State. He said he had hoped the
name of Governor Morton would go before
the National Convention without any
opposition, but that hope could no longer
be sustained and that McKinley was the
choice of the country. General Swayne
said that a combination of machine pro
prietors had become a threatening aspect
in the situation. But the Republican party
did not propose to tolerate the rule of any
boss or combination of bosses, and did not
intend to have in the Cabinet of ihe next
President of the United States any one
who was known as the proprietor of the
Republican machine.
"The voice of the country," said he, "is
for McKinley, and it is not an unwise thing
for us to snpport him."
The name of Governor McKinley was re
ceived with the greatest enthusiasm, and
was cheered again and again.
General Swayne then introduced Benator*
Frank D. Pavey, who reviewed briefly the
history of the Republican party and its
more prominent leaders, and then told how
William McKinley was admitted to the
ranks of the Union soldiers by John C.
Fremont, and traced McKinley's career
thenceforth to the present time.
When Senator Pavey had concluded John
Millholland read the fol lowing resolutions,
which were adopted amid a great uproar of
applause:
Whereas," It Is apparent that William Mc-
Kinley is not only a logical candidate of the
Republican party for President, but also the
choice of a large majority of Republicans;
and whereas the chief obstacle in the way of
his nomination in tbe coming convention
seems to be a combination of political bosses,
including the leader of the New York State
machine, which opposes Mr. McKinley be
cause of his steadfast refusal to comply with
their demands to mortgage the Presidency in
their interests; and whereas there is reason to
believe that if for any reason Governor Morton
cannot be nominated, persons to maintain a
prÂ»prietory interest in the party organization
and control its action throughout the State
will represent the vote of the delegation from
this Staters henceforward a perquisite to be
disposed of at pleasure in bargaining for po
litical consideration in future; and whereas
there have been intimations, apparently ema
nating from the New York State machine, that
should Mr. McKinley be nominated against its
wishes he would be compelled to look else
where for support in his canvass than to the
so-called regular party organization in this
State; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, Republicans of the city
and State of New YorK, in mass-meeting as
sembled organize ourselves into a political
body to be known as "The McKinley League
of the State of New York," and
Resolved, That the object of the league's ac
tivity shall be to procure by all lawful and
honorable means the nomination of Mr. Mc-
Kinley at. St. Louis, and his election at the
polls in November. Be it further
Resolved, That the immediate w6rk of carry
ing into effect these resolutions be placed in
the hands of a committee on organization, to
be elected here to-night, the said committee
to consist of not less than fifteen members.
It was then moved and seconded that
the chairman be given the power to nomi
nate fifteen persons who should form the
executive committee of the McKinley
League of the State of New York. Gen
eral Swayne then selected the men who
will form the executive committee.
Edward Mead of Texas, who was next
introduced, said the South would do its
share to nominate and elect William Mc-
Kinley. The South was now prepared to
indorse protection and would vote solidly
for McKinley at the St. Louis convention.
C. T. Campbell, the next speaker, spoke
in part as follows: "The nomination of
McKinley means the unconditional cap
ture and surrender of all the opponents of
true American progress. His success
means the death knell of the free-trade
contingent in this country. It is not
therefore to save protection that I urge
the nomination of McKinley, that would
be saved anyhow, but it is to close the dis
cussion of the question."
Among the other speakers were the
Hon. George E. Matthews of Buffalo and
A. H. Steele, Deputy Commissioner
of Public Safety of this city. Tne singing
of "America" by the audience and glee
club brought the meeting to a close.
Among those who had been invited to
speak at the meeting was W. S. Manning
of Albany. Mr. Manning had prepared
his speech, but was uuable to deliver it
on account of the lateness of the hour
when his name was reached on the list
of speakers.
MIXXEBOTA. J-'OR M'KIXLET.
Delegate* Elected, to the Convention at
St. Lou it.
ST. PAUIi, Minn., March 23.â The Re
publicans of the Second, Third, Fourth,
Sixth and Seventh Congressional districts
to-day selected delegates to the St. Louis
convention. Six of these delegates are in
structed for McKinley, two lor Davis and
two others for Davis with a queer proviso.
In the Fourth District, of which St. Paul,
Mr. Davis' home, is the greater part, a
resolution was adopted that two delegates
should vote for Davis unless their votes
should jeopardize the chances of McKin
ley, in which event they should be cast
directly for McKinley. The resolutions in
all the districts declared strongly for pro
tection. On the money qnestion all the
districts declared for sound money except
the Seventh, which declared for the largest
possible use of silver. There will be over
1000 delegates in the State convention to
morrow. The indications to-night point
very strongly to a McKinley victory.

Dors Hot Think He mil Jtt a Candidate
for Vice- President.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 23.â United
States Senator George C. Perkins of Cali
fornia has written a letter to the editor of
a Republican paper in his State thanking
him for sending him clippings from the
newspapers in which his name was men
tioned for the Republican nomination for
the Vice-Presidency, and addinsr:
" I cannot fail to feel complimented at
such a compliment as that which has been
paid me in placing my name before the
public. Though there is no possibility
that the desires so warmly expressed will
be realized, my friends may be assured
that their kindness and good will can
never be forgotten. I am of the opinion
that it will not be possible to go so far
west for a candidate for Vice-President.
Indeed, I do not think that either of the
candidates for the two highest offices in
the gift of the Nation can be drawn from
States west of lowa. With a Presidential
candidate from the middle West and the
Vice-Presidential candidate from New
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
England or New York I think that the
Republican party would sweep the
country.
â¢â¢1 am of the opinion that California
should send to the National Convention
representative men who shall be un
pledged, and in consequence left free to
vote for the best men brought forward for
nomination. The State will thus be Â©laced
in a position to make its influence felt and
will be able to work for the best interests
of the entire country. Besides, it may
thereby secure the power to name a Cabi
net officer, which would perhaps prove of
more benefit to the entire Pacific Coast
that to have a V ice-President chosen from
that State.
"My name has been brought forward as
a possible candidate for Vice- President
without any consultation with me, and in
fact, the movement was started without
my knowledge. The position which I oc
cupy is one which presents a field which
is wide, and in which it is perhaps possible
for me to secure as many benefits for the
Pacific Coast as I could do in any other."

CHICAGO, ItL., March 23.â Acting
Commander Eva Booth and Commissioner
Cariton, who came from New York to put
the Salvation Army officers of this divi
sion on record as to their stand for or
against General Booth, claim that the
party's two days' Visit has resulted in
a practically unanimous rally under the
old flag, so far as outward appearances in
dicate. Brigadier Fielding, commander of
the division, and Staff Captain Cay
gill of Mew York, who came with
the party, stated tonight, after a
big farewell demonstration in honor of
Miss Booth that all but a few officersâ and
they lacked the courage of their convic
tions to speak outâ had attended the coun
cil called by Miss Booth this morning, and
by a show of hands, when asked, had
pledged anew their allegiance to the foun
der and head of the army.
On the other hand, Adjutant Heron,
who will join Ballington Booth's forces,
Staff Captain Wincnell of Milwaukee, and
other commanding officers, said the coun
cil had not been satisfactory. They claim
that of the 225 officers who attended the
council, over half a hundred will be found
under Ballington's banner. Miss Booth

A WATCHMAN'S STORY.
Claims the Woolen Mills Pro
prietors Made Him Their
Confidant.
WANTED HIM TO SAY NOTHING.
Was to Receive $iooo for Keeping the
Secretâ A Sensational Affi
davit.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 23.â Charles
A. Shepherd and P. G. Collum, proprietors
of the Woodland woolen-mills, recently de
stroyed by fire, were arrested this after
noon on a charge of arson,, sworn to by
District Attorney Hopkins. The com
plaint is based upon the deposition of
Night \Vatohnian Shirley, who was in
charge of the mills on January 27, when
the first fire was discovered and ex
tinguished. Shirley's deposition alleges
that shortly before 6 o'clock on the even
ing of January 27, while he was en route
to the mills, he met Collum and Shepherd
in a wagon near the woolen-mills. Shep
herd said to him :
"Ed, I wish you would give those flues a
blowing out to-night."
Shirley replied, "I do that every night."
Collura then said, "The weather beinÂ»
damp they choke up more than usual,"
and then some one said, "Blow out the
boiler, too."
At 8 o'clock that night Shirley's atten
tion was attracted by the barking of a dog.
He quit work and went around to the
south of the building, but saw nothing and
returned to the engine. He proceeded to
make his rounds of the building and dis
covered a fire in the north end of the fin
ishing-room. He gave an alarm and put
out the fire. Soon afterward he saw two
persons coming toward the mills. He
recognized them as Collum and Shepherd.
He discovered on the floor that night,
near where the fire started, a piece of bur
lap the size of a wool sack.
About 3 o'clock on '.he afternoon of
January 28, he met Collum and Shepherd
on the streets of Woodland. They invited
him into a saloon and had a couple of
drinks. He then made arrangements to
meet them a short time later at the corner
of Main and Third streets. He met Collum
and Shepherd at that place, and they asked
him about buying the woolen-mill prop
erty, and wanted him to go in with them.
Shirley replied that he had no money.
Collum then said in the presence and hear
ing of Shepherd :
"How would you like to make a thou
sand?"
He replied, "It is owing to how I am to
make it."
Collum said. "Wait till we get to your
house and I will tell you about it."
All three went down to Shirley's house
and went around to the back yard, and
Shepherd said: "They are settling up the
Laugeno ur estate and we are liable to lose
it (meaning trie woolon-mills), and it
would throw these families out as beg
gars."
Collum said, "There is an old home
stead back East mortgaged to run the
mill."
After further conversation Collum said
to Shirley, touching him on his arm,
"See here; I am the who set that mill
on fire."
Shirley replied, "I believe it."
Colium said, "We knew you did from
the way yon talked that night and we had
decided to take you into our confidence,
and if you want to make $1000 you can
do it."
Shirley then asked Collum what he
wanted him to do, whereupon Collum re
plied, "Just to know nothing, and you
can get your money in from forty to sixty
days."
Collum stated that they had prepared
for the fire on January 27 by putting coal
tar underneath the floor and then touched
it off through the veutilator, and con
cluded by saying. "Charley struck the
match and I set the fire." Shirley then
asked when they set it, and Collum re
plied, "When you were upstairs filling
your lamps."
Before Shepherd and Cullom left the
house it was understood and agreed by
and between all that the mill should burn
that night. Shepherd and Collum then
departed and Shirley commenced think
ing the matter over and advised with hia
wife, and finally went to Charles Shepherd
and told him he would have nothing to do
with it. Collum and Shepherd pleaded
with him and told him to think of the
$1090, but he refused, and they then
pleaded with him not to give them away.
In conclusion, Shirley swears that this
statement is made freely and voluntarily.
Public opinion as to the guilt or inno
cence of the accused was, until the arrest,
about evenly divided. To a Call corre
spondent Bhepherd and Collum said that
they had no statement to make, further
than that they were surprised at the depo
sition made by Shirley.
"We had heard two or three days ago
that Shirley was to make some such a
statement," said Mr. Shepherd. "When
we approached him yesterday he said,
'There is nothing in it; the whole thing is
a lie.' "
The two were admitted to bail in the
sum of $4000 and the following have quali
fied in $800 each : Mrs. Emma Laugenour,
owner of the burned property; J. F.
Hink, merchant; C. Sieber, hotel man;
A. M. Elston, druggist.

SAM RAFAEL CONVICTS FOILED.
Four Prisoners Detected While Cutting
Through the Brick Wall of
Their Cell.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., March 23.â An
attempt was made this afternoon by four
prisoners to cut their way through the
solid brick walls of the County Jail.
When discovered by Under Sheriff â¢'Jack"
Hannon the men had already abstracted
two bricks and were working with all pos
sible haste and energy to complete the job
by night, when they hoped to get away
under cover of darkness.
Under Sheriff Hannon said that his at
tention was attracted to the jail, which is
situated in the basement of Marin County's
Courthouse, by hearing a low grating
sound, such as might be made by some
sharp instrument being rubbed against
the walls of the prison. He listened for
awnile and heard the sound kept up. At
once suspecting that everything was not
right, be started out on a tour of inspec
tion. When he arrived at the cell occu
pied by Bollotti, Morelas, Taylor and Nel
son he' noticed that things were not â¢as
they should be and immediately sum
moned Deputy Sheriff Londen, who was
in the Sheriff's office on the floor above the
County Jail.
When the prisoners found that they were
discovered they made no resistance and
were put into another cell, while the
implement with which they were work
ing was taken away. It was simply a Tib
bone which one of them had taken from
the dinner platter and smuggled into the
prison cell.
The men are all desperate criminals and
have been tried and convicted of various
offenses. Morelas is the man who robbed
the Marshal's store and is to be sentenced
to-morrow. Bollotti was but yesterday con
victed of an attack upon a* girl. Taylor
and Nelson were detected in the act of
smuggling opium to the prisoners at San
Quentin and convicted.

TAMAL PAIS ROAD TROUBLE
The Land-Owners' Injunction Suit
Heard by Judge Angelotti
at San Rafael.
Maurice Windmiller of Mill Valley
Claims His Property Would Be
Ruined by the Railway.
SAN RAFAKL, Cal., March 23.â The
injunction suit of Maurice Windmiller
against the Mill Valley and Mount Tamal
pais Scenic Railway and the California
Construction Company, restraining them
from building the railroad upon Cprte Ma
dera and Blythedale avenues, in Mill
Valley, came up before Judge Angolotti
to-day.
Before the case was called the answer of
defendant was served and filed. They
deny that the full and absolute control of
the roads in Mill Valley belongs to the
people. The case was not concluded when
a continuance until to-morrow was taken.
Both sides of the controversy were well
represented. The plaintiff, Maurice Wind*
miller, testified to the injury his property
would sustain if the road ran upon Corte
Madera avenue. He said it would mean
that the avenue would become a death
trap, for the cars would come out of the
trees and be upon one before he had an
opportunity to escape. The grading of
the road to make room for the railroad
would leave a high bluff in front of hit
property.
M. M. O'Shaughnessy testified as to the
dangerous condition the road would be in
if the railroad was allowed to run on it.
J. H. Mclnnes, who sold the right of
way through his property to the mountain
road, did not believe the running of the
road on the avenue would hurt any one's
property. Mclnnes was the man who
stood guard over a tree not long ago and
refused to allow the company's men to cut
it down.
E. Steele toofc the stand and made the
startling assertion that he did not know
there was a saloon in Mill Valley, and
thought that the building of the road
would bring about 100,000 people to Mill
Valley to live. Mr. Steele was followed by
Mr. Janes, who could not see the harm of
building the road. Mr. Janes is the secre
tary of the company. Henry L. Dodge
and President Egan of the construction
company thought the road was a good
thing.
The examination of S. B. Gushing was
begun, but the case went over until to
morrow, when, it is expected, a decision
will be reached.
TRAGEDY IN THE

With a Razor.

VIS ALIA, Cal., March 23.â Si Lovren,
the man accused of having planned the
attempted train holdup near Tulare early
last Thursday morning, which resulted in
the death of Outlaw Dan McCall, at
tempted to commit suicide 10-night in the
County Jail. To-day his lawyer requested
that a razor be allowed him, so tbat he
might shave, and the officers permitted
him to have it. At 6 o'clock loud knock
ing was heard on the inside of tbe jail,
but as the inmates make a great deal of
noise but little attention was paid to it.
Tbe noise grew so loud and long con
tinued that Deputy Hafley went inside to
have it stopped, and was informed that Si
Lovren had hurt himself. Several officers
who had been standing outside Jrushed to
Lovren's cell and found the accused man
lying on the floor, covered with blood. He
had cut his throat with the razor.
A physician was summoned and the
wounded man taken out into the corridor.
Before the doctor arrived Lovren was asked

Mrs. Lee Walters, 823 First Street, Los Angeles,
Tells the Public How Much Has Been
Done for Her.
SHE BELIEVES IN THE HOME REMEDY.
A Peculiar Case of Nervous Dyspepsia, Insomnia and Impure Blood Mas
Just Been Successfully Cured by the Great Home Remedy, Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla â It Has Astonished the Doctors of Los Angeles,
Many of Whom Are Now Making an Investigation.
A TRUE AND AUTHENTIC STORY comes from
the. city of Los Angeles which is really marvelous.
It is especially interesting to tnose suffering from
dyspepsia and an impoverished blood, for while the
individual is now permanently cured, many doctors are
wondering how the cure was effected, and it is given out
that the physicians of Los Angeles are secretly investi-
gating the * 'formulae" of what is known as
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Four years ago Mrs. Lee Walters was considered one
of the handsomest women of Los Angeles. Up to that
time she was in perfect health. All of a sudden she
developed headaches â dyspepsia. Her case was so pain-
ful that many of the best physicians were called in, but
they could only give temporary relief.
About a year ago Mrs. Lee Walters began using Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. She has completely recovered
her lost health. All the old symptoms have disappeared.
She writes for the benefit of those who may be similarly
afflicted :
Ths Edwin W. Jot Co., 269 Stevenson street, Ban Francisco, Cal. â Gentlemen:
From a deep sense of gratitude I am glad to be able to tell you that I am now a well ,
and hearty woman. Ail the old symptoms have disappeared. I have no more head-
aches. They are gone.
You see, my headaches were so awful, so extremely painful, I had to call in many
doctors, but was never relieved until I used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. It is such a
pleasant medicine. There is no nasty taste to it.
I ran eat almost anything and digest well. I sleep every night. Mv stomach does
not fill up and bloat. My digestion is really perfect. I praise the Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla and will always recommend it. I stopped using pills as soon as I began to
take Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. It is a splendid laxative. Hoping Borne person will
read this who is looking for relief, I wish you God's blessing.
(Signed) MRS. LEE WALTERS,
823 E. First Street, Los Angeles, Cal.
why he had attempted to kill himself. He
said he was innocent and did not want to
be banged. All he had ever done for the
"boys" was mere favors, and he had never
done anything to justify the people in
talking about him the way they did. He
said the people should not hang innocent
men. Ardell, as well as himself,' was in
nocent.
When Dr. Patterson arrived he found
tbat the wound was aoout five inches long
and was in the angle between the jaw and
the neck. It severed both external jugular
veins, but the wound was not quite deep
enough at the extremes to reach the carotid
arteries. The man had lost fully three
pounds of blood. The doctor closed the
gaping wound with twenty stitches.
The chances to-night are very much
against Lovren's recovery. He is almost
pulseless. When asked if he "wanted to
get well he replied in the negative. He
wanted to bid the "boys" all good-by.
Lovren's act seems to have been the re
sult of a fear of lynching. Charles Ardell,
bis accomplice, said that they fully ex
pected an attack on the jail at any mo
ment. While the doctor was with Lovren
Officer Russell accidentally broke a pane
of glass in the back part of tne jail, and
Ardell exclaimed that a mob was coming.
The doctor told him to expect nothing of
the sort, and succeeded in quietinc him.
Earl Daggett, one of the officers wounded
in the tight with McCall, will recover. He
is resting easily and growing stronger.
FRESNO FRANCHISE GRANTED.
Last Obstacle in the Way of the Valley Rail
road Removed by the City
Council.
FRESNO, Cal., March 23. â The San
Joaquin Valley Railroad now has a fran
chise to build its road through Fresno, on
the Q-street route. The City Council met
to-night and formally granted this fran
chise without opposition. The matter has
been hanging fire a long time, awaiting
ihe decison by the Supreme Court on a
point of law. This decision was favorable
to the railroad, and it # was given all it
asked.
The only stipulation is that work must
commence within seven months from the
granting of the franchise and t'iat certain
street grades shall not be interfered with.
But on all these points there is an under
standing with the railroad people, and
there is nothing now in the way of build
ing the road so far as Fresno is concerned.
Tbe right of way from one end of the city
| to the other and a mile beyond the city on
the north has been donated and deeded to
the Valley road.

Two Letters Reveal the
Cause of Miss Emma
Plucker's Act.
WAS ONLY A PLAYTHING
Dying Reproach, to the Man Who
Had Trifled With Her
Affections.
DEATH BATHER THAN MISERY.
The Girl's Former Lover Asked to
. Assist in Bearing Her Body to
. the Grave.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., March 23.â
tragic suicide of Miss Emma Plucker, the
pretty 19-year-old daughter of the proprie
tor of the Central House, was investigated
by a Coroner's jury to-day. It was found
that hers was the deed of a love-lorn girl,
who hoped to. bring repentance to the
heart of a man who had not been constant
in his attentions to her. The Coroner's
jury returned this verdict:
We, the jury, find, that said Amelia Plucker
came to her death from a gunshot wound, in
flicted by her own hand with suicidal intent.
The following . letter to James Trail,
which fell into the hands of the Coroner,
has been made of record and consequently
became public. It explains the situation.
Trail lived at Pluckers hotel:
Cextral House, March 22, 1896.
Dearest Jim: When you receive this note you
will be shocked and surprised, and I shall be
dead, for the moment this note leaves my hand
I will kill myself and the reason for this crazy
act is, you care more for fast women, cards
and saloons than you do for me. Darling Jim,
do you remember how often I have said that
nothing but death should ever part us, and
that I would sooner have you kill me than
leave me. Oh, lam a woman of; my word and
I shall take my own life, but no one in this
world shall ever know that I killed myself for
you. 1 I wrote Frank ? a few lines begging him
to be kind to dear old papa, but I did not even
hint the reason for killing myself.
Darling boy, will you please grant my last
wish? Please go to my funeral and be one of
my pall-bearers, and for your dead girl's sake
do not let this letter get into the newspapers
or in any one's hands but yours. Please never
lead on another girl that you are ashamed to
be seen with, and do not tell her that you love
her when you only care for her as your play
toy. Always bear in mind that you are the
cause of one girl's death. Don't be the cause
of another. I will now close with a "God bless
you" from my heart. I love you with a pure
woman's love and cannot live without you.
From your broken-hearted â¢ Emma. &;
The act was not only premeditated, but
carried out with a nicety of detail that
portrays courage. The following letter
was addressed by the young lady to her
brother:
Central HorsE, March 22, 1896. '
1 Dear Brother: When you read this note I
will be dead, and I have one request which I
hope you will grant, and that is to be kind and
good to my poor old father. Sister Mollie is
married and brother Adolph is away, there
fore you are his only comfort. Remember,
father has always treated us well, in fact, is
the only person that ever loved me. When
mother left he stayed with his children and
gave them a good home. ' 'â¢ -I, â  - . â 
The reason for doing this ; foolish ast will
never be known, therefore do not trouble your
self trying to find out. Now, asking you to
grant my last wishes, I will tell you how I
would like to buried. Please bury me in Union
Cemetery. Have Mrs. Copland make my dress,
and I would like very much to have these gen
tlemen for my pall-bearers : Walter Frey, Nick
Fox, James Trail, Dr. Shepherd, George Schlff
Â»nd James McKernan. â 
Brother, do not thin* that I am crazy to kill
myself without taking a second thought, for I
am as cool and in my right mind now as I ever
have been, and 1 have thought over this for a
lous time. I shall bring this to a close now, by
saying God bless my parents, friends and also
these people that were always ready to run me
down and talk about me without any reason,
and remember your broken-hearted sister,
:'- Emma.. !
P. S.â Please always be good to your dear old
father, and please forgive me for telling that
story and saying that 1 was sick, but I would
not leave papa without some one in my place.

MODESTO, Cal., March 23.â The horses
Of "White Hat" McCarty confined in
Rancher J. M. Canty's pasture, over which
there has been so much trouble because
they were not fed and over fifty starved to
death, are now assured of food at least for
a while. A. E. Clary, acting Deputy
County Assessor, assessed the stock at
$18,000 on Saturday. As the tax was col
lectable at once and was not forthcoming
the Assessor, acting under the provisions
of the Political Code of California, placed
the stock in the hands of a receiver.
Now, in order to secure the State and
county taxes for the year 1896 on the 240
horses, the official will sell them for the
taxes, costs and percentage, and he gave
notice this evening in a Modesto paper to
that effect. The sale will take place, un
less the money is paid in the meantime,
on Monday, March 30, at Canby's ranch,
two miles east of Grayson. The horses,
immediately upon being placed in a re
ceiver's hands, were given better feed.

SENSATION AT SAN JOSE
Papers in the Barron Will Case
Are Missing From the
Files.
Failure of an Attempt to Prevent
the Appearance of Lawyer
McKinstry.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 23.â The call
ing of the motion of J. C. McKinstry, at
torney of the Protestant Orphan Asylum
of Sau Francisco, to set aside service and
quash the citation to appear and show
cause why the application of George Bar
ron for the revocation of the will of Ed
ward Barron, developed a mild sensation
in Judge Reynolds' court this afternoon.
The citation and service could not be
found, having mysteriously disappeared.
M. C. Hassett and H. V. Morehouse, who
were present as the legal representatives
of George Barron, contended that the loss
of the papers shut McKinstry out. as now
he had nothing to move on. McKinstry
claimed that the motion could be made
just as well on a copy of the original cita
tion and service.
M. C. Has?eit then presented an affi
davit to the effect that the board of direc
tors of the Protestant Orphan Asylum had
not authorized J. C. McKinstry to appear
as the attorney of the institution, and
moved that the court set aside his motion.
The question was submitted to Judge Rey
nolds without argument on McKinstry's
part. In passing upon the point raised
the court held that an opposing attorney
had no right to question the authority of
another attorney in the case. If Mr.'jJc-
Kinstry was appearing without authority
he would be subject to punishment for
contempt. The motion of Mr. Hassett was
therefore denied.
Attorney McKinstry stated that he
wished to present counter affidavits and
asked leave to withdraw his submission of
the question. The request was granted
and Judge Reynolds continued all matters
until next Monday.

.-"Sufficient time - has now elapsed to de
termine decidedly as to the effects of the
recent cold spell "upon the fruit, and it is
now certain no kind of fruit was materially
damaged by the i frost. >? Prunes and early
pears : are in full bloom, and the Bartlett
Dears are beginning to come out. . Craw
ford peaches and apricots .are almost out
of bloom. The crop of Moorp'ark apricots
will be very light. This is not due to the
cold weather, but to some mysterious and
unknown sort of blight that struck them
in December. v The: buds remained on the
trees until the nap began to flow, : and then
fell off. Taken altogether the prospects
are bright for a good crop."
' . Considerable more rain will be needed
to insure good crops.
Xortnal School Improved.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 22.â Extensive
improvements, involving the expenditure
of about $4000, are being made in the
departments of chemistry, physics and

Interest in the contest grows daily. It
is estimated that about 2800 ballots have
been deposited in the box up to date.
SANTA. BARBARA. PRIZES.
Liberal JRf\vards to lie Given to Exhib
itors at the Carnival.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 23.â
Visitors from a distance who annually
gather to witness Santa Barbara's beau
tiful flower festival often inquire with
interest concerning the nature and value
of the prizes for which the exhibitors in
the procession so zealously contend. To
some it no doubt seems a little absurd
that well-bred ladies and gentlemen, many
of them possessed of ample means, should
strive against each other for the posses
sion of rewards which must be but a trifle
to the winners, and scarcely to be countea
in comparison with the great expense at
tending decoration and costuming or the
glorious success of each individual exhibit,
regarded, from a purely esthetic point of
view.
As a matter of fact these prizes are ex
ceedingly generous and far exceed in ag
gregate value the total offered by any
California city since the inauguration of
these spring festivals. All of the exhibits
in the procession are divided and subdi
vided into classes and each class has Ita
own set of awards, the larger prizes going
to those which are understood to entail
the greater expense and labor in prepara
tion and decoration. These prizes are in
tended both as incentives and as compen
sation, and a pleasing rule hag been estab
lished that every decorated vehicle en
tered in the procession, which in the eyes
of the judges is possessed of artistic merit,
shall receive a gratuity of ?5. The list of
premiums is published in local papers for
a couple of months preceding the great
event and it is safe to say is the subject of
frequent and anxious scrutiny by intend
ing exhibitors.
This year the directors offer, as usual.
$150 for the best decorated floral float, $75
for the second best and $25 for the third,
each receiving in addition one of the
pretty satin banners, which, floating from
long bamboo poles, have from the first
been one of the pretty features of these
contests. The best sorrev or carnage re
ceives $75, the second best $40 and the
third $10, in addition to the banners.
Phaetons or buggies drawn by two horses
receive $50, $25 and $10, according to their
rank in the eves of the judges, while the
same vehicles drawn by single horses are,
oddly enough, advertised to receive $60,
$25 and $10. Tubs or carts, four-in-hands
and tandems form separate classes, the
premiums in each being $40, $25 and $5.
Spring wagons and farm wagons form
two more classes, with first and second
money premiums only, of $30 and $20, the
third receiving only its banner unless, as is
extremely probable, it earns the gratuity
from the judges. Equestrians, boyÂ» ana
firls on ponies and burros, ladies on horse
ack, children's miniature vehicles, mar
shal's aids and individual decorated cy
clists each fall into the various classes re
ceiving $10 : $15 and banners. Special
premiums are put up on originality of con
ceit or design, as shown by the prizes of
$50, $25 and $10 for novelties other than
equestrian, and $40, $20 and banner for
equestrian novelties. For the best Spanish
cavalcade, to consist of not less than eight
persons in Spanish costume and flower
decorations, $40 and $20 premiums are of
fered; and the b-st gToup of not less than
twenty mounted ana decorated cyclists re
ceive $60 and $40.
A considerable number of exhibitors
prepare their designs with no thought or
desire of winning prizes, often deliber
ately neglecting to make formal entry upon
the list. It is frequently the case that
single horsemen or exhibitors in classes
commanding but a $50 prize spend hun
dreds of dollars for costumes and decora
tions. A single horseman has used 30,000
carnations, the most of them imported
from the famous pink gardens of Coro
nado. It is a common thing to use 40,000
or 50,000 of the most exquisite half-blown
rosebuds on a single vehicle, and as many
as 75,000 j r ellow and white marguerite's
have beautified a single float.
Yet the average exhibitor makes liberal
expenditure of time and money as a con
tribution to this lovely spectacle, drawing
upon a limited exchequer, and it is fitting
that some substantial recompense should
be made.

REDWOOD CITY, Cal., March 23.-The

HEALDSBURG, Cau, March 22.â The
rains for the past three days have been
just what the farmer needs and good for
flowers and blossoming vines, but, as L.
A. Norton of the finance committee for
Healdsburg's Floral Association says, "it
is too damp for collectors." However, the
festival fund has now reached the $1200
mark and a fair start is just made. Last
year many residents of this place contrib
uted $1 to the cause. There are no $1 sub
scribers this year, $5 being the lowest
limit, while some enthusiasts are giving
$50 to $100. On the score of money no dif
ficulty will be met with.
The dates of the festival have not yet
been fixed, but will be determined at a
meeting of the directors to be held Tues
day night. To-morrow the voting contest
beiins. Much interest will center in the
battle of ballots, for last year over 7000
votes were cast.'

SUVA SWEPT
BY A TORNADO
Capital of the Fiji Islands
Believed to Have Been
Destroyed.
SOUTH SEA HURRICANE.
Disastrous Storm Reported by
the Australian Steamship
Warrimoo.
BRISBANE FERRY DISASTER.
Details of the Sinking of the Pearl
in Which Thirty-Seven Lives
Were Lost.
VICTORIA, B. C. March 23.-The Cana
dian-Australian steamer Warrimoo, which
arrived to-day, reports the probable de
struction of Suva, the capital of the Fiji
Islands, by a terrific hurricane which
swept over that section just after the
steamer had departed. The hurricane was
felt by the Warrimoo when one day's
steaming from Suva, and is described by
its officers as being exactly similar to the
memorable storm of little over a year ago,
but greater in its fury and undoubtedly
more disastrous in its effect. The storm of
last year destroyed crops and villages on
the islands and caused great loss of life.
The late hurricane seemed to rage from
every quarter, and the elements, gather
ing in the north, scon *so wonderfully
intermingled that to those aboard the
Warrimoo they appeared a scene at once
grand and awful. Although it was morn
ins when the storm arose, the day seemed
as night, and the ship plunged and lurched
with great labor, everything movable on
deck going adrift.
It is the opinion of those aboard that
much damage is done at Suva, and the
report brought by the Warrimoo has
caused considerable anxiety among local
business men, some of whom are deeply
interested in Fiji trade.
So firmly convinced are the officers of
the ship that Suva has been at least partly
demolished that they made it one of their
first duties upon arriving here to report
the matter officially. .What action the
imperial Government will take toward re
lieving possible distress wilt probably be
known in the course of a few days, as the
Warrimoo is scheduled to sail on the 25th.
The Warrimoo left Sydney on February
29, and brings full particulars of the ter
rible Brisbane ferry disaster, by which
thirty -seven people lost their lives.
The sinking of the ferry-boat Pearl was
due to the extremely swift current Â«f the
river in a flood.
The flood was so strong as to endanger
the Victoria bridge, which had to be closed j
to traffic. Under thrse circumstances the
Pearl was unusually full, though carrying
only half of its full capacity. In trying to
cross the river, the Pearl was carried by
the force of the current into collision with
the Lucinda, and sank within a minute.
Three years ago, during a similar flood,
the danger of crossing was so great that
as high as $50 was paid as fare, and several
ferries refused to cross at any price. The
Pearl was supposed to be deficient in
engine-power. The captain stood on the
bridge until the vessel went to the bottom.
He felt the bridge break under his feet,
and he then arose to the surface and saved
two women, who caugnt and clung to him
desperately.
The present wet season promises to
eclipse all others as regards rainfall. The
rivers are all in flood and great damage
to railroad and other property is reported.
The rabbit inspector at Wilcannia has
reported to tue Minister for Lands that up

RYAN SCORES PREACHERS
Criticizes the Attitude ol the
Young Men's Christian
Association.
The Lecturer Claimed That Christ
Himself Was an Immigration
Restrictionist.
Major T. C. Ryan delivered the last but
one of his anti-Rnmanist addresses at
Metropolitan Temple last evening to a
large audience.
The address was under the auspices of
W. A. P. A. No. 17.
H. W. Bowman presided and made a
nary introductory addiess, in the course
of which he said: "I impeach Romanism
stealine the livery of heaven to serve the
devil in." He dubbed the Pope the "Grand
humbug of the ages" and indicted Catholi
cism in the name of "Jesus of Nazareth,
whose religion has been travestied." Fin
ally be characterized the Roman Catholic
church as the "Benedict Arnold of the
ages."
Mrs. M. E. Richardson said: "There are
signs of the times that one who is inter
ested must see. I see how eager the peo
ple are for the word they have heard here
and elsewhere on the subject of the even
ing. I see a favorable sign in the attitude
of the press and the public mind."
Major T. C. Ryan was the chief speaker
of the evening. He said :
lam not a preacher. I would make a better
stevedore. But the Bible la, mine as imicli as
it is the property of any preacher. The Bible
is God's singing angel. It has charmed more
griefs to rest than any philosophy in the world.
It has driven more wicked thoughts back to
their dungeon than has any philosophy in the
world. It has made the soldier's death easy.
The book will be read by your children and
mine and their children's children unto the
end of time. Priests mar burn it, -as they have
in the past, but its work will not be done till
the last pilgrim of earth has planted his feet
on the other side of Jordan. It will not be
done then, for its work will extend through
all eternity.
I take it that, of the thousands of ministers
in the United States, not more than 10 per
cent are preaching against the man of am as
they .should.
May it not be true that those ministers arc
controlled by their official boards and that
those boards are under the rule of moneyed
considerations. Are they nQt too much like
the Young Men's Christian Associations, which
would rather have a dozen Romanist contribu
tors to their gymnasium and baths than 100
good, true men?
Referring to the projected Slavonian
colonization of Mendocino County, Major
Ryan said â¢
. Tnat is one of the most ignorant races of.
people in the world. It is the people who
come to this country with a torch in one hand
and a stink of dynamite in the other. That
people will be dominated by the priesthood
and five year" hence the fair State of Cali
fornia may be under the dominion of Mendo
clno This is the threat that menaces our fair
land. The preacher of the gospel who refuses
to raise his voice against such abuses is cruci
fying his Savior anew.
We have allowed people to enter the temple
of liberty who have set it on fire. Christ him
self was an immigration restrictionist.
Can we not let the monetary question go for
awhile? Can we not leave the tariff to itself
whi'.e we settle this terrible question?
The command. "Let mv people gp, ' has
sounded through the ages. England heard
bat would not heed it till it was accompanied
Dy the thunder of artillery. Again, in the
middle of this century, the command was
heard and Lincoln arose in his Christlike
manhood and answered it by the emancipa
tion of the blacks. A third time it is making
itself heard. Must it be followed a third time
by the tramp of armies and the shedding of
How is it in other lands? 'France ha*
arisen against the clericals, Germany has ar
rayed herself against it, Barcelona is at. war
with them. Italy and Irelandâ "Ould Ireland
âhave heard the voice of God. In Manitoba,
just across the line, the war is on.
If the Methodist church, with which I
affiliate, should undertake to dictate my vote,
I should Jeave Methodism. >*o minister,
Driest, Cardinal or .Pope shall use my
brains for me. If we could get the
hydra-headed monster, Romanism, out
into tiie field of debate it would not be five
years before it were buried in the sea. But
the system doesn't light that way. It
stands'beneath its shelter and says "you re a
liar," and expects us to forget we are gentle
men and answer "you'are another." We don t
believe in that brute method of warfare.
Only that man or woman who has traveled
the highways of good literature is able to
wisely judge of this question. Freedom m
ciudes freedom to read and recognize good
literature. Â
The man who interferes with American poli
tics is not worthy of Amerlcau citizenship.
The man who interferes with politics by means
of an ecclesiastical saber should be put behind
the bars with the man who buys a vote.
In the course of a comparison tho speaker
isaid some one had taken a fancy to inquire
who he was. Mike Ryan of Cincinnati h.ad re
replied that he did not known him. I sub
scribed $10 to aid that gentleman in a pur
ported movement in the encouragement oi
the study of the Irish language. I never had
any returns. Since that time Mike doesn't
know me and I am glad ha doesn't.
Commenting upon a doctrinal point, he
said:
Don't be too fearful of that spot called purga
tory. I don't think many people will be hurt
down there.
Speaking of the practice of confession-,
he said :
Every man who is true to himself, every
woman who is true to herself, all who are true
to their homes need not fear to go to God in
stead of the confessor. Fear neither purgatory
nor the confessional.
What have the priests done? I passed one of
your school buildings the other* dayâ the
Horace Mann School. The Roman Catholic
church never in all her history produced a
Horace Mann. Where is the Wendell Phillips,
the Lowell, the George Washington of Rome?
Where has Rome produced a Hamilton or a
Joseph Jefferson? Where, oh, whereâno
whereâhas Rome given us a Lincoln or a Gnr
field? Where has she given us a man like
Harrison? Where has it produced a patriot
like the great Senator Morgan of fcbe
present Congress? Did Rome give us
the intrepid soldier, General O. O.
Howard? She gave Rosencranz, but he
was a fighter because he loved his country
more than his church. She gave us Beaure
gard, and worseâ Andersonville. But she did
give v Fitzpimmons and Paddy Ryan and
John L. Sullvan, who reign in the realm of
brutes. I shali return home by way of Texas.
I want to congratulate the legislature on pro
hibiting brutal amusements. I can't afford to
despise Texas any more.
In conclusion, he said: "Give up your
political party for a while and vote for a
man."
Major Ryan will give his farewell ad
dress at Metropolitan Temple Sunday
a fternoon.

TANGERMAN IS IN TOWN
Says the Action of the Miners'
Union Was Wholly Un
provoked.
Hale ft Norcross Directors Determine
to Take Action Toward Protec
tion of the Property.
H. W. Tangerman, superintendent of
the Hale & Norcross mine, whose eviction
by the members of the Miners' Union iias
attracted wide attention, arrived in the
City yesterday iv company with President
Jere Lynch of the company.
President Lynch was considerably
wrought up over the affair, but declined
to discuss it further than to say that the
company will take care of the mine.
Superintendent Tangerman did not look
at all worried over his experience or the
result of it. He said that during his ab
sence there is no foreman in the mine and
only an acting superintendent. He said :
"I have never broken any rule fixed by
the Miners' Union, and their treatment of
me was wholly unprovoked."
At a meeting of ihe directors, held yes
terday afternoon, it was determined to
seek legal advice and to take such measure!
as shall secure the supremacy of the rights
of the stockholders.
Jere Lynch, president of the Hale &
Norcross Mining Company, left Virginia
City Saturday and arrived in San Fran
cisco yesterday forenoon.
He was seen at the Bohemian Club last
evening in company with A. Krause, one of
the directors o" the company. President
Lynch apologized for imitating the
spninx of Egypt, but positively declined
to be interviewed on the subject of the
mining troubles at Virginia City. He said
that during his sojourn at Virginia City
he made a thorough exploration of the
mine and closely inspected the property
of the company.
He was asked : "What reasons have you
for supposing that a large body of ore
exists in the mine, which Mr. Tangerman
would uncover if not hindered by adverse
interests?"
"I cannot answer that question," replied
Mr. Lynch. "On that matter my lips are
sealed. Here I must be the sphinx."
"Was the subject of resuming work in
the mine and restoring Mr. Tangerman to
authority discussed at the meeting of your
directors to-day?"
"The directors held a prolonged ses
sion, 1 ' answered the president, "but the
proceedings of the session must be kept
becret for the present. Yes, all the di
rectors were present."
Director Krause has agreed with Mr.
Lynch about the necessity of keeping pro
foundly secret the transactions of the
board "at the long session. Mr. KrauÂ«e
and one other director were with the presi
dent in Nevada. **-*
Mr. Lynch was asked if he consulted the
authorities at Virginia City on the subject
of affording his superintendent the pro
tection of the law, but declined to answer
the question.
In reply to the question as to whether
he had called on the Governor and Adju
tant-General of Nevada at Carson, Mr.
Lynch said the Governor was not at the
capitol. and that he did not see the Adju
tant-General.
President Lynch expects to return to
Virginia City before many days, but there
will" be another meeting of the board be*
fore he returns.

and yesterday Logan, the iron horse, had
his colors lowered by the cheap selling
plater Monita, in a seven and a half fur
long race, decided over the treacherous in
side course. Alex Shields' old campaigner
was held at 2 to 5 and 1 to 3 in the books,
and whether or not he was defeated by fair
means is questionable; at any rate the
majority of those who witnessed the race
think he was not. According to the condi
tion of the race Logan carried 135 pounds
and was ridden by W. Shields.
The favorite was not prominent until
the hill down the back stretch was
reached, when he shot to the front, fol
lowed by Monita with Shaw up. The two
horses then enga?ed in a very pretty strug
gle, fighting it out head and head. A fur :
long from the wire Logan faltered, but
Shields urged him with the whip and he
responded. About a hundred yards from
the finishing-post, Shaw, who at some
period of his career must have worked in
a lemonade manufactory, could not resist
the temptation offered and "lay^ too,"
squeezing Logan against the fence. Shields
momentarily" stopped riding, and when
Shaw took off the screws, again went to
work on his mount and was making rapid
strides to the front, when Shaw again bore
in and Logan was beaten a head, with his
rider sitting up straight in the saddle.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
Shields entered a protest with the judges,
and exhibited a torn boot as evidence that
he had been fouled, but the claim was not
allowed.
It is quite evident that the present rules
governing fouls are entirely inadequate to
cover the'exigencies that arise, and should
be ao revised as to make it only possible
to disqualify a horse when said horse's
rider deliberately and intentionally pulls
his mount in, forcing the contending
horse over the fence and breaking two or
three of his rider's libs, thus putting an
end to muca grumbling and kicking.
The day's racing card was a very com
monplace one, and the attendance was
correspondingly lisht. The favorite got
to the wire first on but two occasions, and
the pencilers fattened and looked happy.
A five and a half furlong dash for maid
ens under selling cpnditions opened the
day's spo^t. Mirambo ruled an 11 to 5
favorite but could only finish second to the
10 to 1 chance, Hazel D, sporting Barney
Schreiber's colors.
The Cambridge stable's Rey de[ Tierra
was a pronounced 3 to 5 chance for the
two-year-old half-mile spin, and had
about all she could do to win. In a rat
tling finish the favorite, Roselle and Scar
borough finished head on the wire in the
order nam^d. Harry Giiffin. who is a
"free lance" now, put up one of his $15,000
finishes astride the back of Artist, the
second choice for the third event at six
furlongs. Rosebud was backed down to a
2 to 1 choice, but was interfered with
shortly after the barrier was raised and
could not get to the front. Catch 'Em, a
70 to 1 shot came very near making a run
away race of it, but Griffin brought Artist
up in the last few yards and through
splendid riding beat the outsider a nose.
Morven was a poor third.
The mile and a furlong hurdle race went
to the 7 to 5 favorite, Bellringer, with
Willie Spence in the saddle. The second
choice, Three Forks, set a hot clip to the
stretch when the first choice began closing
on him, and on the trip to the wire was
beaten out easily.
Rebellion was once more made a warm
favorite, the books holding him a 6 to 5
chance for the last race over seven fur-
longs, with Dare Dollar next in demand,
at Bto 5. It looked any one's race at the
head of the stretch, where Decision was
slightly in front, closely followed by Re
bellion, Dare Dollar and the 20 to 1 chance,
Montallade. Approaching the wire De
cision, who was a 50 to 1 shot, hung on
gamely, but at the end was easily out
footed by Montallade, who won by half a
length. Benham was a close third.
Track and Paddock Items.
The horses owned by Barney Schreiber
and the estate of C. H. Durkee were sold
at auction by Killip <fe Co. Jast evening and
brought very low prices. Of the Schreiber
lot Ingleside brought the top price, being
knocked (town to Oscar Bachman for $400.
Zoolein went for $205 and Yemen for $175.
Trix, owned by the deceased Bookmaker
Durkee, was sold for $310 to Tod Sloan, and
America, Beatrice and Juno brought very
low figures.
Horsemen will take notice that the
Crocker stake will be run on the opening
day at Ingleside and the Ormonde stake to
be run at the same time on April 8.
DR. SHUEY IS INDORSED
A San Francisco Mother Writes
to Her Regarding Steels
in Clothing.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 23.â Dr. Sarah
I. Shuey has received the following in
dorsement of her stand on dress from a
San Francisco mother:
Dr. Shueyâ Dear Madam: I have read, with
much appreciation, your opinion on corsets
and dress. I am just an ordinary woman,
working at home as mother and wife for my
family, often under poor and adverse circum
stances. My children have grown up without
the slightest trouble over teethinpand with
few and slight illnesses; none have died and
all are robust and distressingly full of spirits.
Though the oldest of them is a girl of nearly
13, neither she nor her two sisters have ever
known the discomfort of corsets, and I look
forward with dislike to the time when she
must wear them or take a back seat in her life
chances.
Not only thin, but I look with longing to tne
time to come when the rich (who can be idle if
they like) will allow those who have to toil
every day of every year the great benefit and
advantage from every point of view of a
trouser-dress of some kind. This concession is
undoubtedly due to the workers, whose ease,
as far as the work will allow, would benefit the
rich.
I know the skirts to the ground would cause
an enormous loss to me â to my strength, time,
health, temper and moneyâ and I envy, bit
terly envy, the meanest animal, for it has not
lost its Wrthrigntâ the free and necessary
active motion ot its limbsâ but we unfortunate
female human beings have lost our rights to
the best and most valuable gift of nature, and
all are, and must be, semi-cripples, while we
retain skirts lower than the knee, and though
we talk in church about being made in the
image of God, we show plainly that we are
ashamed of that shape and try all we can to
alter and deform it.
Look through the whole of creation and we
have to admit that the female of man is the
only cripple, and the belief is strong in me
that we cannot approach anywhere near hap
piness and contentment whilst we tight a vain,
stupid, fatal battle against tne commonest
laws or nature. When I watch ladies passing
in the street, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, with the
awful volume of their skirt wagging to and
fro, I feel miserable and disheartened, when
I know they ought to be as light and graceful
as a deer; and when I read so much about the
gracefulness of this or that beautiful woman,
I know it means only the useless gracefulness
of inactivity, and to see these '' graceful
creatures " all doubled together trying to walk
up their own stairs is truly painful and ludi
crous.
I thought possibly a community in the
county could be found not restricting men as
Dr. Mary Walker in her farm colony for girls
is reported doing, but only admitting such
men as are willing to allow women to live un
der the most favorable circumstances to health
and economy. Economy and the present dress
for women is impossible in any way, whether
health, money or time; and between dress and
drink we waste our energies and can never
prosper nor be happy. Very respectfully,
Mes. .

jected free love into their platform as a
part of the doctrine of equal representation.
Some of them chewed snuff and ejacu
lated "My Gawd!" at the most unex
pected crises, while others smoked cigar
ettes and rested their thick ankles on the
backs of chairs while they spoke of the
divine rights of women.
Amid this heterogeneous mass of freaks
and cranks there shone brightly here and
there the luster of a true woman â of such
as Susan B. Anthony, Julia Warde Howe
and Harriet Beecher Stowe, to whom was
reserved the martyrdom of battling against
the prejudices which the eccentricities of
the less noble of their sex provoked among
the people.
But the representation of the new era
last night was most vivid. There were no
vinegar-visaged misanthropes, no untamed,
unsexed shrews, but an assemblage of
bright, cheerful women, many of whom
were young and pretty, and all of whom
were fashionably attired. In other words
there wÂ«re no symptoms ot crankiness, the
participants being earDest American
women, maids, wives and mothers repre
senting all shades of religious belief and
all varieties of political opinion.
Not a seat was vacant in the commo
dious hall of the Native Sons of the Golden
"West. The audience was composed of rep
resentatives of the best families in the
City, and their attractive costumes were
enhanced by the background of the beauti
ful white hall.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, who took so much
of an active part in the trial of Dr. Brown,
presided over the meeting, and her
daughter Hattie was among her many
willing assistants on the floor. Rev. Dr.
Rader, a member of the council which
tried Dr. Brown, delivered the opening
prayer and remained an interested listener
until the close of the meeting. Dr. Brown
was not present, or, if present, was not in
sight of the reporters.
Leaflets containing the words of half a
dozen or more suffrage songs were dis
tributed among the audience, and these
songs were nung with a will, between
speeches.
Colonel Taylor Rodgers, Mayor Sutro's
secretary, read the following letter from
the Mayor:
March 23, 1806.
Miss 3fary J. Hay and Ming Harriet Cooper,
San Francisco, CaJ.â Dear Ladies: During our
short but very pleasant interview of to-day
you kindly extended me an invitation to ad
dress the meeting to be held at Native Sons'
Hall to-night in advocacy of female suffrage.
It will be inconvenient for me to attend, but
please accept my appreciation of your request,
and rest assured that your movement has my
earnest indorsement.
I believe in even-handed justice for ail
hence woman should have her share in civic
aft airs.
I believe that equality is the basic principle
of our Governmentâ hence woman should as
sume all the responsibilities that arise out of
her morality and mental endowments as a
citizen.
I believe in the preservation of the sacred
ness of the homeâ hence woman should aid in
the duty of tormulatinpr, executing and inter
preting all legislation that touches that home.
Woman's advent as a voter will be the means
through which the Government may be per
petuated, as embodying justice, equality and
righteousness.
Through theÃe attributes our great corpora
tions will be forced to obey the laws that pro
vide "equal rights for all and special privileges
for none."
In simple phrase let me conclude by saying,
"God bless you in your noble efforts." Yours
respectfully, Adolph Sutro.
Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine
and for five years a missionary in China
was the lirst speaker. Miss Yates is a
very prepossessing brunette of a Southern
rather than a Northern type of beauty.
She made an effective speech in a quiet,
modest way.
She began by saying that according to
Blackstone goodness, wisdom and power
were the three elements of government.
The best and the worst of men
will acknowledge that women hold the
balance of power for morality and
that they form the great majority of
the church membership. Women were
not perfect, she continued. They
were created as companions of men, and
the men would be very lonesome if the
women "were perfect. Eve was not the
only woman that raised Cain. Taking
everything into consideration, it seemed
to the speaker that if men were good
enough to vote, women were good enough
to vote also.
Some men said that women were foolish
and did silly things. In reply to that
statement the speaker said that women
never yet organized an expedition to hunt
for the north pole.
When men turned a deaf ear to Colum
bus it was a woman who gave up her jewels
to make possible the discovery and settle
ment of America. The women of the
American Revolution proved that they
were as loyal and as brave as the men.
The speaker told of Ella Carroll of Mary
land, who in the days of Lincoln brough t
to Washington a cleverly conceived plan
of the Tennessee campaign. It wan her
plan and her genius that made the vic
tories of Grant possible. But she received
neither credit nor pension for it, and was
allowed to die in poverty.
Miss Yates told of Edward Everett Hale,
weight 120 pounds, who informed Mrs.
Livermore, weight 170 pounds, that he was
opposed to woman voting because she was
not strong enough to bear arms. Mrs.
Livermore replied that she was strong
enough to take Mr. Hale in her arms to
ihe polls. If physical strength was to be
the qualification for all the rights of citi
zenship, she suggested that James J. Cor
bett should be elected President of the
United states and John L. Sullivan Vice-
President.
Some laughter was caused by the an
nouncement that the King of Siam had a
bodyguard of 400 women, two of whom
recently saved his life in a tiger hunt.
Another objection to woman suffrage
was to the effect that woman should not
dip her white wings in tne dirty pool of
politics.
"Women have no wings in the East,"
added Miss Yates innocently. "Have they
in California? I think a woman with
them would look like a goose. But the
women can take charge of politics and let
the men retire to a cloister and wash from
i themselves the pollution of the filthy
pool."
The speaker referred to the non-partisan
ship of the movement and predicted tnat
the wise and generous men of all parties
would make the battle in this State for
woman suffrage.
Miss Harriet May Mills, a sweet girl
graduate from Cornell University, N. V.,
Followed Miss Yates, and began with a
graceful compliment to California. This
State had the climate and the soil to make
it great and beautiful, but it lacked only
one thing and that was a constitution
without the word ''male" in it. Every
constitution was improved when the word
"male" was stricken out of it.
She told about one man who had said to
her that he was opposed to letting women
vote because all the women would want to
hold office, and it would be a very danger
ous thing to turn these professional politi
cians loose upon the community. Women
did not want office, she saia, but they
wanted to see that better men were put
into office.
Mrs. Cooper then introduced Miss Susan
B. Anthony, whom she spoke of as the
queen who had fought the battle for
women for fifty years.
Miss Anthony made a straightforward,
businesslike tafk, unembeilished with any
of the flowers of oratory. She was glad to
have learned that two of the great
political parties in the State had
passed resolutions favoring the enfran
chisement of women.
Rev. Dr. Anna Shaw followed with a
talk which keut the audience in good
humor.
"1 don't know enough to be a Republi
can ; I am not good enough to be a Demo
crat; 1 have not suffered enough to be a
Populist, and I am not sober enough to be
a Prohibitionist."
It was with such epigrammatic sentences
that she kept her hearers on the laugh.
At the close of the meeting Miss Mary
G. Hay called for subscriptions in aid of
the campaign. Mrs. A. A. Sargent headed
the list with $100 and several other sub
scribed sums ranging from $100 down
to $5.
There will be a reception at Mrs. Sperry'a
residence, at 2100 Pacific avenue, at 2 p."m.
to-day.
IT WAS OPENING DAY.
Thousands Visited Hale Bros, and Were
Delighted With What They Saw.
It was not a question with the ladies of
San Francisco yesterday what store to
visit in their shopping expeditions, but it
was a question whether it would be pos
sible to obtain entrance to the store of
Hale Bros. The house is a deservedly
popular one, and always enjoys a full
share of the patronage of the people of
thisCitv, but their announcement made
in the Sunday papers that they would
open a new cloak and suit department
yesterday was sufficient to draw to the
store the largest crowd that has ever as
sembled within its walls during its history.
The place was beautifully decorated with
potted plants and palms, while festoons of
flowers throughout added to the hand
some appearance of the premises. All
day long, particularly during the after
noon, the store was thronged with the fair
sex, who were present not merely to in
spect, but to purchase. The silk and dress
goods counters especially were lined with
fashionably attired ladies who came to
select from the new stock the latest con
ceits in spring good?. Carriages in great
numbers drove up to the doors during the
afternoon and the street presented the ap
pearance of a fashionable Nob Hill re
ception.
The San Francisco house of Hale Broth
ers has built up a trade on broad-gauge
business principles. Their constantly in
creasing patronage has necessitated an in
crease of their quarters, and by the addi
tion of the new departments first opened
to the public yesterday, they have in
creased their store capacity fully one-half
as much more than it was previously.
' They now have a frontage on Market
street of 100 feet and the basement below
is utilized to carry a large stock from
which requisitions are made daily to sup
ply the departments above. Yesterday's
opening was a most successful affair and
served to impress more firmly than ever in
the minds of the, people of Ban Francisco
the magnitude and enterprise of this firm.

AT THE CITY THEATERS
The American Extravaganza
Company Opens at the
"CONFUSION" AT THE ALCAZAK.
Carroll Johnson's New Irish-American
Comedy-Drama at the Grand
Opera-House.
'.'Sin bad" was welcomed back to the Co
lombia Theater last night by an audience
that tilled the bouse and which included
many fashionable first-nighters.
The extravaganza has come back with
an almost entirely different cast. Miss
Louise Eissing is still with the company
as Sinbad, and Miss Frankie M. Raymond
takes the part of Niuetta, but the other
people are nearly all new to the American
Extravaganca Company. Fresco, the idle
apprentice, who blossoms into the can
nibal king, was amusingly played by Oscar
Girard, several of his songs making de
cided hits. Henry Carter, as Count Male
detto. sang with a throaty tenor voice, but
he acted in a bright and sprightly manner,
which after all is the main thing in ex
travaganca.
Hugh Chilvera, one of the few people in
the organization who really possesses a
voice, sang and acted well as Snarleyow,
the pirate captain. Miss Marta Rainsford
was thorough lv amusing as Maraschina,
the terrible old maid who wins the count
in a lottery. Henry Clay Blaney as the Old
Man of the Sea, was chiefly remarkable for
the violent contortions he underwent in
what was presumably a dance.
It seemed impossible that he could
writhe and fall in such a manner without
doing himself a grievous bodily injury,
but Blaney appeared none the worse for
his falls and was rapturously applaunded
for his originality.
The ladies of the chorus had evidently
been chosen more for their personal
charms than for their voices, though their
singing was by no means to be
despised. For extravaganza singing
it was bright and light and spirited,
though the quality of the voices left some
thing to be desired. The girls looked
handsome in their gay costumes, and they
all entered with spirit into their stage
business.
"Sinbad" is large for the Columbia
stage, and when the full strength of the
company was all on it was gather a
tight tit to get them in. How
ever, beyond the mishaps of Ninetta
tripping in one of the dances no incon
ience seemed to be experienced from the
size of the stage. The scenery fitted in
well enough. It was all new and effective,
particularly the opening scene of the har
bor of Balsora and the Valley of Diamonds
scene.
Ballets are few and far between in San
Francisco, and the public here is lenient
in criticizing ballet-dancing. Judged from
the local standard the ballet in "Sinbad"
was very good indeed. The first four
dancersâ those who wore blue â were par
ticularly graceful and clever, and the
prima ballerina. Mile Ferrero, was a skilled
performer of the kind that one sees in bal
lets d'action. Signor Biancifiori, the bal
lerino, was also skilled, though he did lit
tle else but rotate. The Diamond Valley
ballet was gorgeously staged.
The jokes in "Sinbad" have been
brought up to date. There are some good
local hits and the songs, both old and
new, are bright and catchy.
Baldwin Theater.
"A Milk White Flag" opened its third
week at the Baldwin Theater last night.
There was a large audience and all the
specialties were warmly applauded.
At the California,
"Captain Impudence" entered last night
upon its second week. The house was
well filled, and indications are that the ro
mantic comedy will conclude a very suc
cessful fortnight. Edwin Milton Boyle's
plays are all marked by peculiar, dashing
individuality, but "Captain Impudence"
is said by critics to be his best. Much of
the success which has attended the piece
during its presentation here is due to tbe
skillful management of Arthur C. Alston,
who sees to it that everything goes like
clockwork. The comedy-drama "Friends"
is announced for next week.
The Grand Opera-Honse.
A new departure in play writing is Car
roll Johnson's Irish- American comedy
drama "The Irish Statesman." The plot
deals more with this country than with
Ireland, though the play opens on the
shores of Killarney's classic lakes. Here
a pretty love scene takes place between
Osmonde O : Sullivan, the hero, and Lucy
Lovelace, an American heiress. The usual
villain intervenes, in the shape of Richard
Talbot. a cousin of Lucy's, who seeks
her hand and her millions. Poor Lucy
is entangled in a dreadful fashion,
and but for the well-timed advent of
O' Sullivan would lose her fortune. But
the hero dawns upon the dark-hued scene
just in time to save his lady-love and bear
her off in triumph to America. After
many strange ups and. downs the two are
made one. Meanwhile Ireland gains her
freedom. O'Sullivan enters the political
arena, where he achieves great distinction
and ends by being appointed as the first
American Minister Plenipotentiary to the
new-born Irish republic.
Mr. Johnson as O'Sullivan gives a
charming picture of the ideal Irishman,
his fine acting being well supplemented
by the grace and power which Essie Tit
tel gives to the role of Lucy. Fred Butler
as the villainous cousin and Darrell Vin
ton as Rowland, his accomplice, are both
as delightfully diabolical as could be de
sired. The other parts are well sustained
and the stage settings faultless, the scene
representing the Lakes of Killarney being
exquisitely beautiful. The orcbestral
music consisted of variations upon old
Irish airs, while the singing of the Ne
Plus Ultra quartet, composed of Messrs.
Stantini, Lane, Gibbons and Fogarty, was
an innovation evidently relished by the
Ii and appreciative audience.
Tivoli Opera-Honse*
lid Pasha" was well-performed at the
li Opera-house last night, one of the
features of the production being the
good work done by the chorus and orches
tra. It is evident that Carl Martens, the
new conductor, is doing good work, par
ticularly with the chorus.
William H. West has scarcely voice
enough for the title-role of "Said Pasha,"
but he acted well, and gave a creditable,
though not a remarkable performance.
John J. Raffael was the usual star of the
production, his singing and acting being
both excellent in the role of Hassan Bey.
Kate Marchi made a bright little Serena,
her dancing of the hornpipe being espe
cially applauded. Martin Pache was at
home as the Mexican and Fannie Liddiard
and Carrie Roma were respectively clever
as Alti and Balah Sojah.
The Tivoli Opera-house to-morrow even
ing will give a special performance called
"Yachtsmen's Night," under the auspices
of the San Francisco Yacht Club.
At the Orpheam,
Gertie Carlisle, the child-actress and
Binger.is a drawing-card .The girl has a won
derfully graceful and easy stage presence,
while her voice gives evidence of careful
training and displays a carrying quality
frequently absent in the efforts of older
professionals. Basco and Roberts in their
grotesque comedy sketches and the Kins-
Ners iv their marvelous equilibristic feats
are very good in their way, as are also the
club-swingers and jugglers, Albertus and
Bertram. Segommer, the ventriloquist,
mimic and shadowgraphist, the Nawns in
Irish .comedy scenes and a number of
other clever people contribute to present a
very enjoyable programme.
Special mention is due to the amusing
work of the travesty stars, Norma Wills
and Montie Collins, whose quaint conceits
kept last night's house in continual con
vulsions of merriment. Frank La Mondue,
the eccentric clown, while most droll, is
far above the vulgar buffoonery which
renders some of the would-be jesters so
tiresome. The entire bill this week is of a
higher order than has been presented at
the Orpheum for some time, which is
surely no faint praise.
At the Alcazar.
The "continuous show" seems to take
with the amusement-loving public. The
week-day matinees are not as well at
tended as they might be, but the evening
performances are crowded. Last nignt
the piece de resistance was the farce "Con
fusion," which will continue on the boards
during this week. The piece is truly
"confusion worse confounded," hydro
phobia, love's young dream, a fatal tele
gram, a much rnixed-up baby and a niost
reprehensible canine figuring in the fan
tastic plot.
Between the acts Miss Agnes Rajikin
and Miss Josephine Gassman sang a coniple
of sentimental ballads, and "TheO'Bryan,"
as he is called, danced, sang and thrum mcd
away at his banjo to everybody's antire
satisfaction. Some graceful and difficult
evolutions on the triple horizontal bars
were given by Messrs. Starkey and Hath
bun, as well as numbers by several good
singers and specialty artists.
BARRISTERS EMBARRASSED.
The Laugh Often Turned on Saxcastio
Lawyers by Sharp Witnesses.
On one occasion Sir Frank Lock wood was
defending a man in Yorkshire who was ac
cused of stealing cattle, or "beasts," to xise
the north country term. One witness for
the prosecution declared he beheld the
whole transaction from afar.
"Now, my man," quoth Mr. Lockwood,
severely, "you must be extremely careful
in your statements. You say you watched
this affair for some time. Tell me, now,
how far you can see a beast to really know
its points?"
"Just as far off as I am from you, mas
ter," replied the yokel, earnestly. And
the great Q. C. subsided.
There was a civil action in tbe Law
Courts some time ago, mainly concern
ing some money matters. The plain
tiff stated calmly in tbe witness-box that
his financial position had always been sat
isfactory.
Counsel for the other side rose with a
truly portentous air and inquired if he bad
ever become bankrupt.
Plaintiff said he had not.
"Pray be careful, sir. Remember, you
are on oath. Do you mean to tell the
court you never stopped payment?"
"Well," was the reply, "now you come
to call it to my mind, I believe" I did on,
one occasion."
"Ah, I thought we should arrive at it
presently." And counsel took a long
draught of water, in an impressive and
theatrical way. '-Now, sir, when did that
happen?"
"After I had paid all my debts," was
the crushing reply.
The court fairly shrieked with laughter,
and the Judge laughed, too, while the
usher was so stricken with merriment that
he was far from restoring order. â Tit-Bits.

Unless something unexpected happens
this will be a dull week in Congress,, as
every issue in sight has had the edge worn
off long ago.
Every day Bayard stays in office after

The oscillation in Nicaragua has begun

The next; big debate in the Senate will

ORIENTAL COMPETITION.
Colonel John A. Cockerill, who has been
traveling in the Orient as a correspondent
of the New York Herald, gives an account
of such a degree of manufacturing progress
in those countries as renders it certain they

neea for home use and before long will be
large- oompatiters in -the niarkets.<of the

Describing in a recent letter the activity
that prevails at Shanghai Colonel Cockerill
says :
A bit of real estate which might have been
picked up three years ago for a matter of $100
wiil sell in the open market to-day for $1000.
Three years ago there were only three silk
filatures in Shanghai. To-aay one finds thirty,
employing from 800 to 2000 people each. Al
ready the city Is blagjc with the smoke from
cotton factories, shops and ioundries, and four
big mflls are inproceis of erection. The Inter
national Cotton Company, which is practically
the American Trading Company, is well ad
vanced with a new mill, which will operate
40,000 spindles. The cotton-racing Industry
has been greatly stimulated and, thanks to the
liberality of Japan in the making of the Shi
monoseki treaty, Eastern China will soon hum
with machinery if governmental stability can
be secured.
The facts thus stated are interesting as
the report of the latest observer, but in
the main they embody nothing new. It
has been known for a long time that China
has been forging rapidly ahead as a man
ufacturing country, and some of the abler
British consuls in the Orient have repeat
edly warned the manufacturers of Great
Britain of the coming competition. Some
of them have done more than that. They
have pointed out the advantage possessed
by China and Japan in the use of silver as
the standard of monetary value, and have
given the British, people full notice that
unless the Indian mints weie reopened for
the free coinage of silver it would not be
long before the Indian mills would be
closed and the manufacturing for the
Orient would be done exclusively by silver
using people.
The predictions of these astute consuls
who have studied the rivalry between the
industries of the gold standard and the
silver standard countries on the ground
where they come into closest competition
and struggle hardest for supremacy are
nearing fulfillment. There have been de
pressions, bard times and industrial dull
ness in every gold-standard country, and,
on the other band, where the silver stand
ard prevails, even when the people are
among the least enterprising of races,
there is activity, progress and an unwonted
prosperity. This condition of affairs has
a plain moral for the American people.
W r e must have the free coinage of silver as
well as a protective tariff, if we would
maintain the welfare of our workingmen
and advance our industries. The issue
may be' postponed for a time, but it must
be faced in the near future, and the sooner
it is prepared for the better.
WHITNEY'S CHAEGES.
Caspar Whitney, a sporting gentleman
who constituted himself an 'investigator
and judge of amateur sportsmanship in
California, has been expressing himself
freely in the East regarding what he de
clares to be unsportsmanlike practices of
the San Francisco Olympic Club. His ad
verse criticism, when reduced to its essen
tials, is that the club is too liberal a patron
of baseball and football, and that the
club's football nine is composed of profes
sional players and is not an amateur club
in the highest sense. It is pleasing to
note Mr. Whitney's high commendation
of the sports fostered by the State and
Stanford universities.
Mr. Whitney rnieht have said many
things to the advantage of the Olympic
Club while showing so earnest a disposi
tion to attack it on trivial and disputable
grounds. It is presumably the custom for
ball clubs to employ expert coaches and
some players whose skill will increase the
club!s efficiency. That is hardly worthy
of discussion. Some matters of far greater
interest present themselves for considera
tion.
Before the Olympic Club attained to its
present dignity and importance San Fran
cisco had an unpleasant reputation as a
center for "slogging matches.' 1 Disgrace
ful meetings politely called glove contests,
and sometimes resulting in brutal fights
and the death of a contestant, were of too
frequent occurrence. The community was
in revolt. A true sporting sentiment, de
termined to abolish the stain on the repu
tation of the City, concentrated in the
Olympic Club. The membership rapidly
increased and soon embraced many of the
leading men of town. The club erected
one of the handsomest and most com
pletely equipped clubhouses In the United
States, and near the park bought and
fitted up extensive grounds for athletic
games. The Heavy dues and assessments
made membership in the club something
of a luxury, but the elegance, comfort and
completeness of the club constituted it the
focus of fine and wholesome sportsman
ship and crushed out the naif-shady or
ganizations which had given San Fran
cisco an unpleasant notoriety. An im
portant subsidiary enterprise growing out
of the club's organization was a heavy in
vestment in a plant for pumping salt
water from the oceau into the heart of the
City, and it was this tnat made the Olym
pic and Lurline salt water swimming
baths possible.
If the Olympic Club has pursued an
offensive course tne most enlightened ele
ments of our population have not discov
ered the fact. The club is not an object of
criticism by any of the religious, moral
and good government organizations of the
City. It is regarded here as a useful and
wholesome institution, embracing in its
membership many of the best citizens.
The work of its skillful instructors in ad
vancing the physical culture of tbe people
is deemed an excellent thing. Mr. Caspar
Whitney would have to search long before
he could find a club which has accom
plished so much for the health and pleas
ure of its community.
THE EAILEOAD BILL.
It is evident that the sub-committee
of the House Committee on Pacific Roads
will report to the general committee, and
that the general committee will report to
the House, a bill for the funding ot the debt
that will embody the salient features of the
Frye ana Smith bills. Such is the fore
cast of The Call's Washington corre
spondent, and it is what has been expected
in California. Such a bill will likely pro
vide for a re -f undine of the debt at 2 per
cent interest and for gradual extinction
covering a period of fifty years, the prin
cipal and accumulated interest to consti
tute the basis of the re-funded debt. In
other words, it seems reasonable now to
assume that the bill will be entirely in the
interest of the Southern Pacinc Company.
A considerable time must elapse before
the House will take final action on the
measure. This, however, presents the best
opportuuity for .making a stand. Most of
the Congressmen from California may be
depended upon to stand vigorously for the
right, and the others may not be expected
to destroy the^r political prospects by ex
hibiting a violent opposition to the wel
fare of their constituents. There will un
doubtedly be such a xattling of dry bones
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
on the floor of the House as has not been
witnessed in many a day. Those who are
loyal to right cannot afford to miss this
brilliant opportunity for distinguishing
themselves.
In the Senate committee a wide breach
has occurred. Even though the majority
may report a bill favorable to Mr. Hunt
ington, Senator Morgan undoubtedly will
present a minority report, and that will
precipitate a conflict. No disposition has
yet been made of his resolution in the Sen
ate directing the committee to report a bill
favoring Government control, and aeon
test must first be had on that measure.
Thus, while the House committee will
probably have plain sailing, the Senate
committee is hopelessly divided and is
blocked by Morgan. Mr. Huntington's
victory is not yet in sight.
The great thing for California would
be the introduction of overland com
petition. Mr. Huntington's assertion
that this already exists falls before
the fact that because the three great
arms of his railroad system center in Cali
fornia he can and does maintain absolute
dictatorship over the "competing" lines
that nibble at the heels of his traffic. He
is master of the situation, beyond any
question. In the exercise of tnat power he
renders the development of California slow
and uncertain. Should the Government,
unhampered by any Congressional interfer
ence, proceed to foreclose its debt and in
pursuance of that course offer the delin
quent roads for sale, some great Eastern
company unquestionably would buy them.
That would break the Southern Pacific
monopoly and relieve California of the
burden which prohibits its progress.
ON BEHALF OF EECIPROCITY.
The third section of the tariff act of 1890â
the McKinley billâ contained a provi
sion to this effect, that with a view to se
cure reciprocal trade with countries pro
ducing five specified articles then on the
free list â namely, sugar, molasses, coffee,
tea and hides â if such countries should
impose any undue exactions upon Ameri
can products the President should be
authorized to remove any or all of the five
articles named from our free list, and that
thereafter import duties should be imposed
according to a schedule fixed in the sec
tion referred to.
This piece of legislation was commended
in the highest terms by publicists in
nearly every country in Europe, though
the exporters in such countries objected,
but solely on personal and selfish grounds.
The dignity and standing of the United
States were preserved by the making of an
offer which might be accepted or rejected,
and the wisdom and shrewdness of the
plan were shown by almost immediate re
sults. Our trade with the countries
south of us grew at once at an unprece
dented rate and a market was found for
our home products beneficial alike to the
producer and the consumer.
This plan was so successful as to excite
Democratic jealousy, and for no reason
possible to conceive except the desire of
the Democratic party to undo all that the
Republicans had accomplished for the
good of the country, this reciprocity
clause was repealed in 1894 by the free
traders, and the result was a serious loss
to the producers of the United States,
especially the farmers.
Now comes a petition to the subcom
mittee of the House Committee on Ways
and Means, from the American National
Association of Farmers, signed by T. C.
Zarich, which makes interesting reading
for those who are interested in the pros
perity of this country. Mr. Zarich points
out that before the act of 1890 Spain, in
order to control the trade of her West
Indian colonies, imposed a dmty of nearly
$5 50 a barrel on American flour, or about
100 per cent, but under the convention
which resulted from section 3 of the Mc-
Kinlev bill, the duty was reduced to $1
per 220 pounds, large reductions were
made in the duties on other breadstuffs,
the duties on fifteen leading commodities
were redticed one-half, and about forty
articles were added to the free list.
Thereupon our trade with Cuba ad
vanced Dy leaps and bounds, so that un
der the three years of the McKinley bill
our export trade increased some $8,000,000,
and our import trade $14,000,000. The
moment the law of 1894 was passed abro
gating this treaty or convention Spain ad
vanced the duty on flour to $4 75 per 220
pounds, which is almost a prohibitory
rate.
Nor does Mr. Zarich confine himself to
the producers of farm products. He shows
that among those directly interested in
reciprocity are manufacturers of carpets,
drugs, streetcars, engines, iron steam gene
rators, linseed oil, mattresses, silk, agri
cultural machinery and tricycles, and this
we may be certain by no means exhausts
the list. The simple truth is that there
never was a more monumental exhibition
of Democratic ignorance and stupidity
than tne repeal of the so-called reciprocity
clauses of the McKinley bill, and whatever
else the present Congress may do it should
restore those clauses or an equivalent to
the tariff law, and throw the responsibil
ity of disapproving them, if he dare take it,
upon a Democratic President.
THE TUOLUMNE EIVER.
The legislative act which gave Boards of
Supervisors authority to declare the
streams traversing their counties public
highways has given rise to a perplexing
condition of affairs with reference to the
Tuolumne River. This question might
never have arisen had it not been for the
fact that a lumber company has applied to
the Supervisors having the exercise of this
power to declare the river a public high
way in order that it might be used for
floating logs. The company â which, it is
asserted, is composed of Eastern men
having no interest in the development of
California â has acquired large timber in
terests in the mountains and is trying to
find an easy and inexpensive means of
sending the logs to market. As a conse
quence a feeling has been roused in Tuo
lumne County, and the probabilities are
that trouble will come out of the affair.
The Call has no particular information
regarding the merits of this controversy,
but it is sufficiently aware of the broader
needs of California to be able to state cer
tain general propositions which deeply
concern the permanent welfare of the
State. The difficulty which has arisen
over the Tuolumne River proposition
covers the following matters:
1. If the declaring of a river to be a
public highway should cause its use to be
prejudicial to more important interests
which would be served by not declaring it
to be a public highway, then auch.declara
tion would be manifestly unwise.
2. The declaration that a river is a pub
lic highway would not necessarily mean
that as such highway the river should be
used for floating logs.
3. Those rivers in California which are
not adapted for vessels employed in the
transportation of freight and passengers,
or either, might yet serve a very useful
purpose in furnishing irrigation facilities
and the generation of electrical energy for
industrial uses.
. 4. In any particular case, therefore, it
will be a question whether, if the river is
I declared a public highway for the purpose
of permitting it tp be used for floating
logs, such use is the best to which the
river might be put.
In other words, if it would be better for
the people whom the Tuolumne River
serves to have lumber than irrigation and
electric power, then there might be a rea
son for turning the river over to a lumber
company. As the upper Reaches of the
Tuolumne bear an important relation to
mining ana the lower to agriculture, and
as irrigation is unmistakably the prime
consideration in California farming, at
seems that those having the Tuolumne
River in charge have a serious responsi
bility which no local governing body
should be permitted to exercise without
some sort of restraint;.

A CALIFORNIA IDYL.
A roafi-ninner nodged in tbe chaparral
As a coin will slip from the baud of a wizard;
A black wasp droDed by his sun-baked cell.
While flat on the stone lay a Nile-green lizard,
And a wolf in the rift of a sycamore
Sat gray as a monk at tbe mission door.
A sagehen scratched 'mong the cactus spike,
And high in the sky was the noon sun's glamor,
While steady as ever rose anvil-strike
Came the rat-tat-tat ot a yellow-hammer;
And a shy quail lowered his crested head
To the dust-lined sweep of adrr creek's bed.
And out of the earth a tarantula crept,
Un bis bhiry legs to the road's wbite level,
With eyes where a demon's malice slept
And the general air of an unchained devil.
While a rattlesnake by a dusty trail
Lay coiled in a mat of mottled scale.
Then tbe gray wolf sprang on the sagehen there,
And the lizard snapped at the wasp and caught
him:
While tbe spider fled to bis sheltering lair
As though a shadowy foeman sought him;
And the road-runner slipped from tbe wayside
brake
And struck bis beak through tbe rattlesnake.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Theodore Grueninger arrived recently from
Guatemala. Central America, where ne spent
four months in looking about the country. He
reports considerable activity in railroad build
ing in that country. The Guatemalan Govern
ment has already completed seventy-five miles
of the trans-isthmian railroad from (he Atlantic
side, its terminus being Livingstone, and ex
pects to finish the road to the Pacific Ocean in
about two years, the total distance from ocean
to ocean being 350, miles.
The Government has been aided in the work
by Muller & Thompson of Hamburg, Germany,
who last November loaned to the Government
Â£658,500, or $3,292,500, on 4 per cent
bonds. El Progreso Nacional head 6 the an
nouncement of the loan in large black letters,
with "El Ferrocarril del Norte. Su pronta con
clusion esta asegurada. La RepuMica es du
ena de su porvenir." â¢ "The Railroad of tne
North. ' its speedy completion is assured. The
Republic is mistress of her future."
Collis P. Huntington owns a railroad in that
country running from San Jose to Guatemala
ana passing through Escuintla. He has now
started in to build a switch road from Esc'uintla
to Retalhuleo to tap the coffee plantations in
that vicinity. Retalhuleo is on a rival line
paralleling Huntipgton's, about seventy-five
miles away, and running from Champerico to
San Felipe and Columbo. Huntington formerly
owned the controlling interest in this line,
which connects with the rich coffee district,
but German capitalists bought up the majority
of the bonds and they noy own the road, one
half of the road being owned by a German Jew
named Meyer.
Native labor is cheap, farm laborers receiv
ing 25 cents per day and boarding themselves.
They are allowed the use of a small piece of
land, on which they raise beans and from two
to three crops of corn per year. Their diet
is corn in the form of tortillas, or pancakes,
and beans cooked with red peppers and called
frijoles.
Germans have almost a monopoly of the
business of the country. One planter named
Hochmeyer shipped last year 15,000 sacks of
coffee at $25 per sack, making the total value
of the output ."Â£375,000.
Notwithstanding the low rate of wages, paid
farm hands, it costs $5 a day for board and
room in the leading hotel in the city of
Guatemala. In second-class hotels the board
is $15 per week. Guatemala itself is a high
city in the mountains, and the air is thin and
bracing. Imported beer costs 62J^ cents per
pint, and ordinary claret $1 50 per quart
bottle. There are 80,000 inhabitants and no
tramps there. During Mr. Grueniuger's stay
he never heard of a crime of violence com
mitted in the city, and never heard a brawl or
other public disturbance.
The police wear blue uniforms and brass
buttons, with belts and clubs end revolvers.
The penalty for feeling good and singing in the
streets at night is a fine of $20. The Guate
malans are bound to have peace.

Ten to 25 cents is offered for a half-cent (U. S.)
of 1800. Dealers offer to sell five-franc pieces
of 1822 with figure of Louis XVIII at $1 75 to
$2 50. The description of the other coins in
your communication is too indefinite to locate
them in the catalogues.
Yellow Carnationâ S., Mount Bullftm, Mari
posa County, Cal. Yes: there are yellow car
nations. From the caryophylus, under the in
fluence of cultivation, have been" derived all
the splendid varieties of carnations, whose
flowers are of all possible colors and combina
tions of colors except blue.
To Cooks Inletâ H. B. E., Mill Valley, Mariu
County. An advertisement has appeared in
the daily papers recently announcing the fact
that a schooner was being fitted up for a triD
to Cooks Inlet, but as this department does
not advertise private enterprises, it cannot
furnish the desired information.
Currant's Second Trialâ L. G.. Santa Rosa,
Cal. Whether Theodore Durrant will have a
second trial is uncertain, as his case is now
before the Supreme Court, and there Is no
knowing what that body may decide, nor is
there any way of determining when a second
trial will take place should he be granted a
new trial, but it is safe to say that about a year
will elapse before a decision is reached.
Octagonal Dollarsâ N. 8., San Jose, Cal.
Gold dollars of octagonal thape were never
coined In the mints of the united States. They
were issued by private mints and jewelers in
San Francisco in the eaTly days. Some were
made as late as 1875. Collectors of coins do
not make any offer to purchase any of these,
but they have them for sale and charge from
$2 75 to $4 for each, according to date, variety
and state of preservation.
Buildingsâ C. A. J., City. Whether the Mills
and the Crocker buildings will stand "being
kept in constant repair, barring earthquakes
and acts of Providence," 200 or 2000 years
answers to correspondents cannot say, not be
ing endowed with the crlft of prognostication.
There are no buildings that were erected 200
years or more ago of the same materials or
combination of similar materials as used in
the two buildings named by which you could
form an idea as to how long these two build
ings might stand.
Quotations â Gwendolyn, City. As you do
not state in your communication the character
of quotations you desire it is impossible to
know exactly what you do desire. "Many
Thoughts of Many Minds," two volumes;
"Familiar Quotations," by Grocott; "Latin
Quotations," "Quotations From Greek Au
thors" and "Quotations From the German and
Spanish," with English translations by Tate,
and "Familiar Quotations From French and
Italian Authors," to be had at the libraries,

The Pemberton Disasterâ Old Vet., Yount
ville, Xapa County, Cal. The Pemberton Cot
ton-mills, in Lawrence, Mass., were built in
1853, had a capacity of 950 hands, had 650
looms, 29,000 spindles, and when in full opera
tion consumed 60,000 pounds of cotton per
day. On the 10th of January, 1860, while
the machinery was in motion, the main build
ing, without a moment's warning, collapsed,
and conflagration followed. There were 700
people in the building at the time. Seventy
seven were killed outright, 134 were more or
less injured, and of this number 14 subse
quently died.
Chinese Braceletsâ C. X,, City. The brace
lets so commonly worn by Chinese are of
nephrite or jade, a change of feldspar by a
process of saussuritization which is a conver
sion into saussurite, a term used by some
lithologists in describing certain metamorphic
changes in various feldspars. The reason that
it is so universally used by the Chinese is that
they attribute to it a certain virtue, namely,
that of being a preventive of renal disease.
In ancient times it was considered a sure safe
guard against attacks of nephritis, hence its
name nephrite. These bracelets are a fad
among a certain class of white people because
they are Chinese.
Stockholdersâ C, Napa, Cal. The law
of this State says that each stockholder in a
corporation Is individually liable for such pro
portion of its debts and liabilities as the
amount of stock or shares owned by him bear
to the whole of the subscribed capital stock or
shares of the corporation, and for a like pro
portion of each debt or claim against the cor
poration. In a recent case the Supreme Court
held that a stockholder could not be held li
able beyond the proportion of the stock he
owns to the capital stock of the corporation.
An action' against a stockholder should be
commenced in the place in which the corpora
tion has its headquarters.
A Contractâ Steno, City. A contract be
tween an employer and an employe depends
upon the language used at the time the em
ploye is engaged. If tbe employer should
say "I will engage you and pay you at the rate
of $50 per month," that would be one proposi
tion, but if be should say, "I will engage you
by the month and pay you $50 each month."
that would be another proposition. In the first
case he would have the right to dismiss his
employe at any time and pay him only for
such time as he worked. In the other case he
would be bound by his contract and it is prob
able that a court would compel him to pay the
employe a full month's salary if he should
discharge him without cause before the month
was up.

. Naturalizationâ A. C. R., Berkeley, Cal. An
alien who has served in the army of the United
States and who has been honorably discharged
therefrom may become a citizen on his peti
tion without any previous declaration, pro
vided he has resided in the United States at
least one year previous to bis application ana
is of good moral character. It has been judi
cially decided that the residence of one year
in a particular State is not requisite. The ap
plicant must prove by witnesses thai he re
sided in the United States one year before he
applied for naturalization papers. A man who
served three years In the army, was honora
bly discharged and has eince his discharge re
sided for live years in San Francisco can ob
tain his papers on application at any time, but
he must have besides his discharge papers wit
nesses to prove that he resided at least one

street, now Sixteenth, to Market, nearDrumm
A few days, later the railroad was opened for
regular traffic thereafter the cars ran berond
Center street to the rear entrance to the Wil
lows, which fronted on Mission street, betveen
Eighteenth and Twentieth. The cars at firs; ran
every thirty miuutes from fe: 3o in the i corn
ing to 11:30 at night, and it was estimated
that the trains ran 102 miles between the
hours named. It was originally intended ;hat
the cars of the company should be moved by
horse power, but before the road was com
pleted the company obtained permission to use
steam for a limited period. The use of stÂ«am
as a motive power was discontinued Marc a 5,

READY FOR THE
GREAT STRUGGLE
Striking Painters and Bosses
Resting on Their
Arms.
ACTIVE WORK TO BEGIN.
Every Shop in the City Will Be
Picketed by Union Men
To-Day.
A COMPROMISE SUGGESTED.
The Building Trades Unions Likely
to Take a Hand in the Trouble
Very Soon.
The painters' strike was not productive
of any very great sensations yesterday.
As it stands it is a stubborn fight between
the master painters and the union jour
neymen, and both sides express their con
fidence in winning. The master painters
declare that work is very scarce, and that
they have all the men they want to finish
their work. The strikers claim that with
few exceptions the City is practically
tied up.
At 7 or 8 o'clock this morning the
striking painters will "picket" every shop
in the City where any work is being done
and endeavor to get the workingmen to
quit and join the strikers. The leaders
have commanded the pickets not to use
any violence whatever.
It was stated yesterday that the whole
sale paint-dealers will endeavor to in
duce the master painters to come to some
satisfactory understanding with the strik
ers in order to put an end to the trouble.
A conference of the paint-dealers and
master painters was held last evening, but
they would not discuss what had been
done.
The several unions of the Building
Trades Council will shortly decide what
action they will take in the painters'
strike. The council's card system will go
into effect on April 1. On that date they
will have to stand for the card system,
whatever may be their decision in the
painters' strike. So far the majority of
the building trades union men are in favor
of standing by the striken.
WILL STAND FIRM.
Striking Painters Determined That
No Boss Shall Be Specially
Favored.
There was an interesting meeting of the
striking painters held yesterday morning
and another in the afternoon. At both
gatherings plans relative to future action
were discussed. Several suggestions were
made, but definite action was deferred
until the master painters show exactly
what they propose to do.
A few members agreed that the strike
should be continued against the bosses
who are unfriendly to the union and that
some of the men be allowed to return to
those wbo would come out openly for the
union and for the working-card system.
By tbis the friendly bosses would secure
all the work and the men who received
employment could assist in the support of
the idle strikers.
It did not take very long to upset this
suggestion. Those who claimed to have
had experience asserted that, while there
are many good, honest bosses in the City,
such a course would never succeed. All
men cannot be relied upon, they said, and
cited their experience of a week ago.
Many bosses who got their men back to
work by professing friendship for the
union, and who acceded to all demands,
were among the first to subscribe to the
Master Painters' Association's ultimatum
in which they declined to recognize the
working-card system.
The proposition to "tart into the co-oper
ative business and bidding for contracts in
the open market was also discussed.
In the afternoon C. L. Ames, chairman
of the committee of twenty-five on co
operation, reported that at aspecial meet
ing of the committee it was decided to rec
ommend that the union stand firm and
solid for a few days longer at least. Good
news for the union had been received. It
was in substance that at a meeting of the
wholesale paint-dealers the latter had de
cided to meet with the master painters and
use their influence to induce tbe bosses to
comply with the demands of the painters.
The committee also recommended that
every shop in the City be "picketed," so
as to induce all men at work to quit and
stand by the union.
Mr. Bean of tbe same committee said
that St. Denis, who has the painting con
tract on the Parrott building, will be
obliged to put twenty painters to work
this morning or give up the contract.
A special committee of twenty-five was
appointed to picket the St. Denis jobs,
half to remain at the Parrott building and
half at the shop. This committee was
simply to use moral suasion to keep the
men away from the work.
A communication was received from the
Los Angeles Council of Building Trades
in which that body sent to the striking
painters of tbis City a resolution indorsing
tbe strike and expressing the hope that
the strikers will win.
FEARS OF TREACHERY.
A Slight Internal Difference in the
Union Was Quickly Rectified
Yesterday.
The regular meeting of the Painters'
Union last evening was particularly inter
esting, because, for the first time, things
were said that were evidently calculated to
throw discredit upon some of the principal
leaders and most active workers. So far
matters have progressed with remarkable
harmony, and each has had full confidence
in ttie other, barring, of course, the very
few that were known to have been false to
their union obligations. The hall at 115
Turk street was crowded, and seventy-five
new members were initiated. Later in the
evening it developed that seven of the lot
were car-painters, working nine hours a
day, and that the work they are on will
last for some time longer. Consequently
a protest was raised, on the ground that
they could not live up to the obligations
they had just assumed.
i irst, all members of the union are or
dered to be out on a strike, and, second,
no union painter is allowed to work over
eight hours. The new members stated, in
defense, that Mclvor, Rose Pnd Ames had
given them permission to join the union
with thft understanding that they could
continue to work and to work nine hours
a day. Of course this created a small
rumpus of dissatisfaction because no one
in the union has the right to grant special
privileges.
Rose said that some time ago he told
some painters to send in their applications
and discuss the situation with the com
mittee on credentials. He thought it
would be all right, but he granted no

special privilege. Ames and Mclvor also
denied that they had assumed such a re
sponsibility, and the latter denied remem
bering the faces of the car-painters. The
car-painters were given their initiation fee
and ariowed to retire. Those whose names
were mentioned apprehended that certain
forces were at work to cast discredit upon
them and thereby create internal dissen
sion. However, "if such attempt was made
it failed, for the best of feeling prevailed
after the matter had been straightened
out.
Several painters arrived during the day
from San Jose and Sacramento, Dut they
were met by the strikers and taken into
the union.
Great enthusiasm was shown when the
following letter was read :
To whom it may concern : Members of the
Sailors' Union of the Pacific must not take the
places of striking painters. Any member of
the Sailors' Union found taking such places
will be strictly dealt with according to the
rules of the union. Ed Rosenberg,
Secretary pro tern. Sailors' Union.
This settled a troublesome question, as
it was stated that the bosses had threat
ened to finish their contracts with sailors
who run ashore for a few days' light work
and tobacco money.
It was reported that the strikers scored
another victory.' A non-union crowd of
pape-rhangers and painters w,ere at work
fitting up the Original Creamerie at 865
Market street. The strike committee in
duced F. W. Marston, one of the proprie
tors, to dismiss the non-union workers.
The matter of foreman came up and it
was decided that no painter who actually
works with a brush can be considered as a
painters' foreman.
The striking painters are to have a big
benefit in the near future. Danielson, one
of the hardest workers, was out yesterday
and found a lot of professional theatrical
people and managers who are willing to
assist in such an enterprise. He reported
that he had enough talent to give a first
class show, and a committee of four was
appointed to act with him and make ar
rangements.
MASTER PAINTERS PLEASED
Claim to Have Sufflcent Men for
All Work In Hand-Black's
Views.

sociation reviewed the situation quite
freely yesterday from his point of observa
tion. He declared that so far as bis asso
ciation was concerned the strike was not a
recognized fact, and, he added, with Jere
miah Sullivan, a fellow member, that one
fourth of the men who quit work will never
again be employed in association shops.
"We are working right along," he said,
"that is, those of us who have anything to
do. There was an understanding at the
meeting of our association that those
members who had men to spare would
send them here to my shop, and thos9 who
needed men would call upon me. I have
not had a single call to-day from any of
the shops, for there were enough men and
to spare. The truth of the matter is there
are painters enough in San Francisco to
day to paint a town three times as large. I
have sent out only ten men since the strike
began, and from this the inference is that
no distress at all exists among the bosses,
not that they are doing as much work as
otherwise they would. Some of the work
has been postponed, but all work in hand
is being done.
"A great many men have come here for
work, which I could not give them, be
cause I had no place to send them. I
really expected a different state of thingsâ
that is, I would be put to much inconve
nience, and that we would have to start a
kind of labor bureau, but we nave had no
trouble in getting painters."
' "Have you ascertained the number of
painters at work to-day in San Francisco?"
"No; that would be almost impossible,
and at best mere guesswork. The associa
tion has appointed a statistician, and we
expect that he will be able to keep us
posted on what is goingon. VVe computed
that forty master painters were members
of tbe association wlien this trouble began,
and then we estimated that about 300 men
were steadily employed. Now the number
of members is nearly doubled, and we
approximate that the men employed by
them is about 500 to GOO."
"Of course, we have not so many em
ployed at present, because some work is
postponed, and also because this is the
dull season. â¢
*'N. P. Kuss bad nineteen men on bis roll
Saturday night, and St. Denis has twenty
five in his shop, staying with him right
through. There are just fifty in two places.
A fair estimate of tbe number of painters
working in this City, say, is 300."
Jeremiah' Sullivan, a prominent member
of the Master Painters' Association, said:
"I don't want any men, and am quite well
satisfied if the fight keeps up all summer ; it
won't affect me in the least.
"One fourth of the men who went out
on this strike won't go back to tbe shops.
They won't be taken back. There will be
too many men to take their places. The
journeymen wbo were idle and could not
get employment, because there were more
men than work, have joined the union
through this strike, so that even if the
whole trouble was settled there would not
be work for all the union men. The men
who quit steady jobs will be the real suffer
ers."
CONFERRED WITH DEALERS
A Strictly Secret Session Is Held
In the Occidental
Hotel.
The executive committee of the Paint
and Oil Club, a society of dealers, and the
directors of the Master Painters' Associa
tion held a conference 4ast night at the
Occidental Hotel. An understanding was
had that the proceedings should be ob
served as strictly secret, so, although the
representative men of each organization
announced with a solemn show of candor
that nothing pertaining to the strike was
diFcussed. and in fact nottiing that would
interest anybody, they could not possibly
divulge what had taken place.
Before the meeting was held Mr. Black
of the Master Painters said: "This meet
ing has nothing to do with the strike; it is
simply a business proposition. A plan has
been on the docket for six or eieht months,
whereby our association could make ar
raneeroents for terms which would enable
us to pay wanes asked by the journeymen.
The question was under consideration and
we requested time for another meeting to
further discuss it. Instead, they went out
on a strike. That is all there was to this
'triple alliance' business. It is all over
now â knocked on the headâ and we shall
not uiscuss the matter aeain. Our meet
ing witb the dealers to-night is solely for
our own mutual advantage.
"If the journeymen uad given us a
chance and iuet us again we would have
devised some way of settling the question,
but they 'want war, 1 and they are going
to have it."
After the meeting various members of
the Master Painters' board of directors
were seen. They excused themselves from
discussing the proceedings of the confer
ence on the ground that they had agreed
to keep them secret. However, they de
clared that the strike or any feature of the
trade directly influenced by the strike was
not considered. As for themselves, they
asserted there hardly ever was a time in
the more recent history of the trade in
San Francisco that the master painters
were in such good financial condition as
the present, aud consequently they were
in a position to be independent with tne
merchants.
The president and secretary of the dealers
claimed that only "business* 1 matters were
discussed, but the strike was not con
sidered.
NEW BUSINESS AGENT.
Harry M. Saunders Elected Walking
Delegate for the Carpenters'
Unions.
Harry M. Saunders was elected Sat
urday as the business agent for the four
Carpenters and Joiners' unions of this
City. Several weeks ago E. R. Johnson,
the walking delegate, resigned this otlice
in order to accept a position in Alaska, and
the District Council selected C. F. Scbadt
to fill the vacancy until the position could
be regularly filled by a general election.
A call was made for a mass-meeting of
carpenters, which was held last evening.
Tbe unions were well represented and tbe
early votine was spirited, as there were
several delegates' in the field, but Mr.
Saunders was elected by a large majority.
His term will last until July 1. At the
expiration of that time there will probably
be a change in tbe present order of things.
At present each union in the Building
Trades Council has its own business igent
or walking delegale.
THE PLASTERERS' UNION.
They Are Asked for Moral and
Financial Sup
port.
The Plasterers' Union, D. Sullivan presi
dent, met last evening at 927 Mission street
and* received two delegates from the
Painters' Union, who asked for moral and
financial support. After they retired it
was decided to postpone action until the
meeting to be held next Monday night, at
which time will be issued the cards to go
i into effect on April 1.
The union will elect officers at the next
meeting, and the following were placed in
nomination: For president, D. Sullivan;
i vice-president, William O'Brien; record-
I ing secretary. John Lawless; financial sec
! retary, D. Marron; sergeant-at-arms, P.
Corcoran; trustees â George Wheaton,
Michael Kelly, Alexander Stevenson and
Timothy Hanley; delegatesâ W. O'Brien,
G. Wheaton, H. McKenzie, Wilkes Bailey.
H. McKenzie was elected delegate for an
un expired term.

The Carpenters' Union No. 304, at its
meeting at 1159 Mission street, last night
indorsed tbe card system and decided to
bold a muss-meeting in Odd Fellows' Hall
on Wedn sday evening. What action the
union will take in regard to the painters'
strike will depend upon the action to be
taken by the United Council, to be held
shortly.* If tbe council should be favor
able to the proposition to involve the dif
ferent uni jns in the strike this union will
go out.
Cooks and Walters.
The Fraternity of Hotel and Restaurant
Employes will hold its regular public meet
ing this evening at 1159 Mission street.
All cooks, waiters, dishwashers and ho

have been invited to attend. This union
was formed last week, and promises to be
stronger than the old union that existed
several years ago.
The Stonecutters.
The sandstone cutters met last night at
1159 Mission street and waited until a late
hour for a delegation from the Painters'
Union, but as none called no action was
taken in the matter of the strike.
MRS. MARCEAU'S DENIAL
Two Affidavit* Filed, One of Which
Is in the Nature of an
Answer.
Mrs. Marceau has commenced proceed
ings to secure possession of the child
which she says was taken from her just
before her husband filctd his suit for di
vorce. In addition Mrs. Marceau has filed
an affidavit in which she denies the charges
made against her and declares her inno
cence of all wrong doiner.
Mrs. Marceau is no longer a resident at
the Palaoe Hotel. She is living in a house
at Ash bury Heights. She says it is be
cause her Husband declined to pay her
bills; but Marceau says he notified the
hotel people that so long as sbe desired to
stay sbe was to be accommodated. She
asks the court to compel her husband to
provide for her pending the trial of the
divorce suit. She admits having some
money, but she says her estate, valued at
$100,000, has become so encumbered that
she has very little left. The case will be
tried before Judge Slack.
Murder or Manslaughter.
The preliminary examination of Nicholas
Mori, the peddler, on the charge of murdering
Antone Cordinez, a farmer from Stockton, on
Kearny street, near Jackson, was held before
Judge Joactiimsen yesterday afternoon. Some
men had been annoying Mori on the night of
February 17 and he plunged a knife into Cor
dinez. who happened to be looking on. Cor
dinez died at the City and County Hospital a
few aays later. The Judge took the case under
advisement till Saturday, when be will decide
whether to hold Mori for murder or man
slaughter.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Bark Theobald Will Carry
Miners to the Alaskan
Gold Fields.
HUNGRY MEN ON THE OREGON.
Harbor Commissioners and the Risdon
Iron Works at Outs Over Its
Contracts.
The rush for the Alaskan gold fields
still continues and at least half a dozen
vessels are now in the berth for Cook's
Inlet. One that is now being fitted out i 8
the bark Theobald, but as her master is
now engaged in a suit for defamation of
character in the Superior Court it may be
a fe.w days before sbe gets away. '
Captain Swan was formerly master of
the bark McNear, and like many another
skipper be got into trouble with Managing
Owner Thompson. The morning the vessel
was to have sailed Svran was superseded,
and he at once sought revenge. He gave
Thompson a thrashing and the latter got
even by telling tales about the captain.
The slander, suit resulted and Swan will
have to remain in port until the matter is
decided. The present master of the Mc-
Near also has a row on his hands with the
managing owner. A few months ago he
telegraphed from Puget Sound, repudi
ating Thompson, and said be would not
recognize any charter which he might
choose to accept.
The bark Theobald is one of the best
known traders in and out of San Fran
cisco, and Captain Swan, her master, is a
very skillful narizator. He has worked
his way up from the position of cabin-boy,
and never had a word said against bis
good name until he was relieved of the
command of the McNear. Underwriters,
stevedores, merchants, towboat men and
reporters have all borne testimony to his
character, and the chances are that he will
win his suit.
Another vessel that will leave for the
mines in a few days is the steamer Port
land. She will go out under the auspices
of the Pacific Steam Whaling Company,
taking the place of the Jeanie, which has
been detained at one of the canneries. The
Portland will not go direct to Cook's Inlet,
as so many vessels have promised. It will
be the latter part of May belore any vessel
can go through the ice, so the miners who
contemplate trying their fortune in the
frozen north will have to use the portage
system. Captain 0. J. Humphrey, one of
the oldest and most experienced masters
in the employ of trie whaling company,
will have command of the Portland, so
passengers may be sure of getting to the
. nearest available point to the gold fields.
The men on the bark Oregon, which had
to put in here in distress iast Sunday
morning, say they were half starved dar
ing the voyage from Junin lo San Fran
cisco. Captain Parker says there is not a
word of truth in their statement, and that
there is still plenty of food aboard and
enough tobacco to last another voyage.
The entire crew, including the first mate,
left the vessel as soon as she came to an
anchor. They say that in order to reach
port they had to guarantee an extra $25 to
the towboat before a hawser was put
aboard. The agent of the Oregon calls the
crew of the bark a chronic set of kickers,
and says they do not know when they are
well off.
Mate Fisher, who was formerly master
of the bark Ophir, is the most outspoken
of the crew. "I wasn't going to stay out
there and starve," said he yesterday.
"When the master refused a tow I spoke
up and the men joined in. We called the
tug bacK and. finally reached Sen Fran
cisco. It is the last trip I will ever make
in the Oregon."
Captain Hughes of the steamer Oakland
is in a precarious condition. Some time
ago he was stricken with paralysis and
another master had to be placed on the
ferry steamer. He was seized with a
second stroke a few days ago and lost the
fpwer of speech. Now he is helpless and
is friends expect his death at any time.
Captain Hughes was a general favorite
with the Oakland traveling public and all
his friends are grieved to hear of his
serious illness.
The Harbor Commissioners and the
managers of the Risdon Iron Works are
at outs over the contract for the new ferry
building. Messrs. Mead and Taylor,
representing the company, have been
trying to get the State to allow them an
honorarium on the supposition that the
price of iron had advanced while the test
case has been before the Supreme Court.
An investieation by Chief Engineer
Holmes snows that iron is lower to-day
than it was when the bid was put in.
Messrs. Mead and Taylor will be asked to
explain their figures at the meeting of the
board to-day.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
San Bias, scheduled to arrive from Pan
ama and way ports to-morrow, will not get
in until next Thursday. She has been de
tained at Mazatlan. The San Bias has
4250 bags of coffee aboard and over 900
tons of general merchandise from New
York. She will docs at Lombard street,
as the Mail Company's wharf is crowded
with Central American and Asiatic freight.
Captain N. Wolters of toe German bark
J. C. Pflueger is a very sick man. About
three years ago he was thrown from the
bridge by a giant sea and injured his spine.
He is now going home for medical treat
ment. His place will be taken by Captain
William Fangmeir, formerly chief officer
of the ship.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Ala
meda, which sails for Australia on the 2d
of April, will take away over 1000 tons of
flour for the Colonies. Wheat was a very
poor crop over there last season and
American flour is in demand.
The apprentice boys on the English
ships at anchor off Sausalito had an excit
ing gig race last Sunday. There were six
entries, and the course was from the club
home to the tide guage and back, a dis
tance of two miles. The crew of the snip
Kilmeny won first prize, while the Wyn
stay's boys carried orf second honors.

A Buckley Biief Will Be Scattered
Over the Stateâ Other War
Plans Made.
The Buckleyites fired a battery of cam
paign guns last night. The meeting of
the general committee quite filled Odd
Fellows' Hall and the proceedings were
vigorous.
The defending sawdust on the new
maple floor was mixed and tracked by a
large majority of the committee and by
many of the old guard who came to hear
and cheer. Of the Buckley leaders there
were James H. O'Bryan, John McCarthy,
Joseph Rothschild, M. J. Donovan, Sam
>'ewman, Dr. J. J. Stanton, Dr. Bryan,
Judge Robert Ferral and others, and
Thomas Gallagher and others of Congress
man Maguire's friends.
Frank Gould, chairman of the State
Central Committee, was flayed, an amend
ment to the constitution creating an ex
ecutive committee of ninety waa given a
first reading, the election of delegates to
the State Convention was ordered, a state
ment of the Democratic situation in San
Francisco was ordered prepared and dis
tributed over California, and even the
municipal campaign was taken up by
ordering the appointment of a committee
to prepare a call for a primary election to
select delegates to municipal and legisla
tive conventions, the committee to report
next July.
These and other things done and said
last night were filled with the declaration
that the Buckley general committee is Hje
only legitimate and regular local party or
ganization, and the purpose to go ahead |
in all things as "the" party machine.
These features of the proceedings, some
hot talk about the A. P. A., several
speeches and mentions of Congressman
Maguire, Gavin McNab and others caused
all sorts of noises, which helped make the
meeting interesting.
The first business after dispensing with
the rollcall was a resolution by Frank
Malloye providing for going ahead on the
rough* road to the State Convention.
The "whereas" of the resolutions note
the calling of the State Convention for
June 16 in Sacramento and the apportion
ment of 161 delegates to San Francisco.
It is declared the "duty of this general
committee representing the Democratic
party of the City and County of San Fran
cisco" to proceed to elect delegates to that
convention in accordance with the consti
tution and by-laws of the geneial commit
tee.
The district clubs are directed to make
preparations for holding an election of
delegates to the State Conveution, and to
carry out an enrollment and an election
for that purpose in accordance with the
articles of the constitution and by-laws
governing the general committee arid the
district clubs. The resolution apportions
eight delegates to each district and pro
vided for the election of seventeen dele
gates at large by the general committee.
The club rolls are directed to be kept open
in the different Assembly Districts for
additional signatures between 7 and 9:30
o'clock on the evenings of April 29 and 30
and May 1 and 2. Nominations for dele
gates are to be made on May 25, and the
club election of delegates is to beheld June
6, between 6 and 9:30 p. m.
Then came an objection from the Twen
ty-eighth. Thomas Egan said that the
rven allotment of eight delegates to each
district was not fair to the south of Mar
ket districts, where the Democratic vote is
large. He argued that as the apportion
ment of 161 delegates to the City and
County of San Francisco was based on the
Budd vote, the 161 delegates uhould in
turn be apportioned among the districts
on that basis. He moved as an amend
ment that this apportionment be made.
T. E. Tracy and Senator M. J. Donovan
favored the resolution, Donovan making
the point that under Egan's plan there
would be but one delegate-at-large, and
delegates-at-large were good things.
"We south of Market street demand
representation," declared John Rafferty of
the Tbirty-nrst, "and if we cast the most
votes we ought to have it."
There was a roar of ayes from one front
corner and then a bigger roar of noes from
the other side of the house. A stand-up
vote was demanded, and the south-of>
Market interests were plainly squelched.
Egan's amendment was lost. The resolu
tion was adopted as read.
The following resolution handed up by
It. L. Barry was adopted :
Resolved, That the chairman of the DÂ«mocre
tic General Committee appoint a committee of
five on resolutions as provided for in article
111, section 1, of the constitution governing the
general committee, and that said committee is
hereby instructed to at once proceed to the
work of preparing resolutions setting forth
the facts relating to the affairs of the Democra
tic party in this City and County and also a
Teport of the proceedings of the meeting of the
State Central Committee as they occurred at
the California Hotel on Saturday, March 14,
3896, and to have a copy of the same sent to
every member of the Democratic Central Com
mittee and also to have a copy of said docu
ment sent to the chairman of the Democratic
County committees in every county of this
State.
Then the report of the committee on
revision of the constitution was read for
the first time and iaid over. Its only im
portant feature was the abolition of the
campaign committee and the creation of
an executive committee of ninety. As the
committee first planned the executive com
mittee It was given fctrong independent
power. It was discovered that there would
be trouble over this and the plan was
changed by making the executive com
mittee less important and making its acts
subject to the general committee. The
amendment posted last night provides
that it shall consist of live members from
each district, one to be appointed by the
chairman of the general committee and
four to be elected by the delegates to the
general committee in each district. The
executive committee is to consider all
matters referred to it and report at least
every two weeks, and perform all duties
imposed by the general committee. It may
appoint sub-committees. It is under
stood that M. J. Donovan is to be chair
nan of the executive committee when it
blooms.
Then the story of what happened to the
Buckleyites at the recent meeting of the
State Central Committee was told in the
following report of the committee, which
had been appointed to look after the State
committee:
To the General Committee of the Democratic
Party of the City and County of San Francitcoâ
Gentlemen: Your committee of twenty-five,
which was appointed to represent you before
thÂ« State Central Committee on the 14th inst.,
most respectfully offer the following report:
We met at tae Democratic headquarters, 935
Market street, on Friday evening, the 13th
inst., and after fully discubsing the situation
concluded to appear before the State Central
Committee and deny their jurisdiction inÂ« the
premises, but at the same time state our wil
iiugness, in the interest of harmony and for
the best interest of the Democratic party , to ac
cept any fair proposition which might be made
for the selection of delegates to the coming
State Convention.
The BtaÂ»e Central Committee met on Satur
day, March 14, at 2 o'clock p. m. The commit
tee held its meeting in the billiard-room of the
California Hotel, a place absolutely inade
quate for the accommodation of the Democrats
who desired to be present. The ceiling was
extremely low and the crowded condition of
the room soon rendered the place unfit for oc
cupation. So foul was the atmosphere that
two members of our committee were overcome
and had to be assisted from the hall and were
unable to return. The foul condition of the
atmosphere was a fitting accompaniment to
the foul tactics that were resorted to by Chair
man Gould in his eagerness to carry out the
prearranged programme that had evidently
been determined on between him and John
Daggett, Superintendent of the United States
Branch Mint; O. M. Welburn, Collector of In
ternal Revenue of this district; Sam Rainey
and persons representing the Junta, to fraud
ulently secure the delegation to the National
Democratic Convention. '
Many members of the committee protested
that the billiard-room was an unfit place to
hold the meeting of the State Central Commit
tee of the Democratic party, and desired to ad
journ to some hall where the business of the
committee could he transacted with decency,
and which would accommodate all Democrats
â who desired to witness the proceedings. Chair
man Gould declined to entertain their motions
or listen to their protests. This arbitrary ac
tion was but the commencement of what
proved to be the most disgraceful conduct ever
witnessed on the part of the chairman of a
State Central Committee or any other self
respecting body. Throughout the proceedings
Chairman Gould was but the puppet of one
Gavin McXab,-who held numerous proxies and
who sat immediately in front of the chairman,
where his winks and signals to the chair could
easily be seen. Chairman Gould, Secretary
Markley and said McNab, through the instru
mentality of the Federal and State office
holders, were provided with sufficient proxies
to practically control the action of the State
Central Committee and throttle the several
fair propositions that were presented to the
committee, and in some oases by members
Irom the countryâ notably the proposition of
Committeeman Mitchell of Los Angeles, who
Presented a fair plan for the holding of prima
ries for delgates to the State convention, which
plan your representatives immediately staied
their willingness to accept, and which Chair
man Gould ruled out and refused to allow the
State Central Committee to consider.
From the foregoing it will be seen that your
committee knew in advance what the result of
the meeting would be, as it was evident -that
Chairman Gould had determined that fairness
I and decency should have no place in the de
' liberations of the committee. However, your
j committee felt that it was a duty it owed to
the party throughout the State to present to
I the State Centrul Committee all the facts in
| the case, so that it could not be claimed iv the
future that the matter was not fully under
stood by the members of the State Central
Committee, or that we had neglected to ex-
I pl*in it thoroughly to them. The first step In
their programme was taken when said McNab
presented a resolution that the call for the
election of delegates to the State convention
I from San Francisco be addressed to the chair-
I man and secretary of the bolting committee
commonly called the "Junta."
Your committee protested that the State Cen
tral Committee had no jurisdiction over the
selection of delegates from this City, and re
fused to be bound by the action of the State
Central Committee, as it was well known that
the meeting was packed with proxies for the
purpose of carrying out the programme of the
opposition. McXab's resolution was finally
adopted.
It would take np too much time to eive in
this report a detailed account of the many
tricks used to prevent a fair consideration of
the question; but the conduct of Chairman
I Gould, in giving the floor to a partisan of the
"Junta" while Joseph Rothschild was address
ing the committee, and in refusing to enter
tain any motion or amendmentembodvingfair
propositions for the settlement of the difficulty
by the calling of a primary to be conducted by
impartial persons, and in permitting ths con
sideration of the previous question at that
time presented by partisans of the "Junta,"
was so glaring as to call for special mention by
yonr committee.
The action of the State Central Committee,
by reason of the disgraceful and unfair man
ner in which it was secured, will have no pos
sible effect upon the judgmevit of the State
convention, which alone has authority to de
termine the matters in dispute and to which
alone this general committee concedes the
right ol determining the qualifications of the
members of said convention.
In conclusion, we desire to say that the con
duct of the officers of the State Central Com
mittee, and particularly of Chairman Gould,
who lent himself to every trick of the "Junta"
partisans, merits the utmost condemnation of
all Democrats, and has earned for such officers,
and especially for Chairman Gould, the ever
lasting contempt of every fair-minded man who
witnessed the proceedings of the State Central
Committee.
Joseph Rothschild, chairman; George R. B.
Hayes, Henry Ach. P. F. Dundon, John McCar

thy, Dr. J. I. Stan ton, D. M. Gavigau, secretary.
Secretary D. M. Gavigan read the report
while the audience applauded or groaned.
P. A. Dolan popped up as fiery as his big
mustache.
"I would like to amend that resolution,
Mr. Chairman," said Dolan. "I think that
McNab and Gould were actuated by differ
ent motives than those spoken of in the
report. I understand that they belong to
a secret society known as the A. P. A. and
it ought to be investigated. Mr. Gould ac
knowledged to me, and so did Mr. McNab
in the last campaign, that anybody con
nected â with the A. P. A. would get no
recognition by Mr. Budd. They acknowl
edged that to me and I think there ought
to be an investigation."
Mr. Dolan's speech petered out some
how amid the commotion that changed
into cries for "Foote."
Then M. M. Foote went to the platform
and delivered a speech of frenzied elo
quence that kept the audience laughing or
applauding.
â¢â¢You are here," he said, "to express
your opinion about a man raised by the
Democracy of California higher than a pil
lory could raise bim. I speak of a man
named Go-o-o-ld." He spoke of the snub
to the committee which had just reported,
of the proxies, and then of the A. Â±\ A.
"Are you men? Are you free-born
American citizens? I think not. Youare
slaves. Your vote is owned by a San Ber
nardino A. P. A., and a scoundrel."
He denounced Gould's course as "hell
born and hell-inspired," and closed by
declaring "the Democracy will not allow
this impious and perjured organization,
the A. P. A., to rule San Francisco."
The report was adopted, and then James
H. O'Brien said something about the State
Central Committee meeting at which the
secretary was instructed to send the State
convention call to the Junta organization.
He spoke of the Junta committee ap
pointed to appear before the State Central
Committee.
"They put on a few names to give it
flavor," said O'Brien. "They put on
James D. Phelan, E. B. Pond, George T.
Marye and G. Howard Thomson, but these
would have nothing to do with it. They
were not there. I'll tell you who was
there. Clitus Barbour, once a Buckley
candidate for Police Judge, was there. So
was Captain Fitzpatrick, a professional
job-chaser and once a Buculey nominee for
Supervisor. There was also 'Shootlow'
Sullivan, who went up to Sacramento to
shoot workingmen. There was M. C.
Hassett, who only last campaign visited
Mr. Buckley at his ranch to try to get a
nomination. I will ask Larry Conlan if
he saw Mr. Hassett there."
"I saw him there," said Larry.
Secretary Gavigan presented a resolution
which lay hold of the municipal end o! the
fight. It was adopted as follows:
Whereas, Section 1186 of the Political Code
(Statutes 1861, page 166) reads as follows:
"Any convention, as hereinafter defined, held
for the purpose of making nominations for pub
lic office and also electors to the number herein
after specified, may nominate candidates for
public office to be filled by election within the
State. A convention within the meaning of
this act is an organized assemblage of dele
gates representing a political party which at
the last election before the holding of such
convention polled at least 3 per cent of the
eniire vote oi the State, county, dis
trict, or other political division for
which the nomination is made." And
whereas, in accordance with section 1186 of
the Political Code, and for the purpose of
making nominations for City and County
offices to be filled by election in the year 1894.
in the political division of this State" known as
the City and County of San Francisco, this
general committee, the governing body of the
Democratic political party of this City and
County and known aÂ« the general committee
of the Democratic party of the City and County
of San Francisco, did. during said year, issue a
call for an assemblage of delegates in City and
County and legislative conventions, and there
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
after in said year did appoint for such purpose
000 persons' as the representatives of this
general committee; and whereas, 6aid bOO per
sons convened in Union Hall, on Howard
street, In said years, and did nominate a City
and County and a Legislative ticket, and said
nominees were classified on the official ballot
by the word "Democrat"; and whereas, at the
election held in the said year 1894 the persons
so nominated and representing this general
committee or Democratic political party of this
City and County did poll at least 3 per cent of
the entire vote of the City and County;
and whereas, by virtue of 3 per cent of
the entire vote of the City and County
having been polled at the last election
for the nominees for City and County and Leg
islative offices, representing this general com- â¢
mittee or governing body of the Democratic
political party of the City and County of San
Francisco, power was and is vested in this gen
eral committee by section 118b of the Political
Code, to issue a call for and provide for the
selection of delegates from this general com
mittee or governing body of the Democratic
political party of tne City and County of San
Francisco, to a convention for the purpose ot
making nominations for City and Connty and
Legislative offices to be tilled by election in the
year 1806; therefore, in view of the law and
the above statement of facts, be it
Reto'vcrt, That a committee of seven be ap
pointed by the president of this general com
mittee to provide for the call and selection by
primary election of delegates to City and
County and Legislative conventions, said com
mittee to report to this general committee, at
a meeting to be held in the month of July,
Resolved, That 25,000 copies of the foregoing
preamble and resolutions be ordered printed
and distributed among tne Democratic citizens
of this City and County.
Chairman Rothschild was called upon
for a speech on the situation, and he made
a vigorous one.
"There is not the slightest doubt," he
said, "that we are the legitimate succes
sors of the old general committee in fact
and in law. The resolution adopted by
the State Central Committee doesn't
confer legal existence on anything.
The only evidence presented by the
Junta was a little certificate by
A. A. Watkins and Frank P. Hughes that
the oJd committee had adjourned sine die.
If this matter becomes a legal proposition
Mr. vVatkins will never dare say on his
oath that the committee adjourned sine
die. Let us go on . in the even tenor
of our way and pursue. the
course mapped out in the resolutions
adopted here to-night. McNab, Daggett,
Rainey and Wei burn can't control the
Democracy by any manner of means. I
have reason to believe t!i at this combina
tion is in the interest of the control of the
State Convention in behalf of a certain
candidate for the Presidential nomination,
but Mr. Daggett will not have things all
his own way., We will go right ahead to
the State Convention, and I believe that
we will receive fair treatment there.' 1
He spoke of Maguire, and read his tele
gram of the other day reiterating his stand
iv favor of the regularity of the Buckley
organization and in favor of a fair and
open primary. Maguire's name was en
thusiastically cheered.
"They don't want a vote by the people."
said Rothschild. "They want to name 161
delegates in a back room."
When Rothschild quit the meeting
adjourned.
MR. DE YOUNG'S RETURN
His Visit to the Capital City of
the "Unspeakable
Turk."
The "Sick Man of Europe" Is Only
Sick When Called Upon to
Pay His Debts.
Mr. and Mrs. M. H. de Young returned
yesterday after several months' travel
through France and Southern Europe.
They extended their journey as far east as
Constantinople and were in the city of the
"Sick Man" at the beginning of the Ar
menian troubles. When seen at his resi
dence last evening Mr. de Young was
adding to his already numerous collection
a number of rare and costly articles gath
ered by the way in France, Italy and Tur
key.
"Regarding the Armenian question,"
said Mr. de Young, "I had many oppor
tunities of getting inside information, |
both from the American Minister and j
Turkish officials. I had the pleasure of
dining with Mr. Terrell; also of meeting
the Sultan and the Grand Vizier. The
two latter are well educated, highly intel
ligent and fully acquainted with tne con
dition of affairs, and, I fancy, able to cope
with the astute diplomats of the powers.
"The Sick Man is not so sick as the
world at large believes him to be. He has
millions of subjects devoted to him, a
religion that holds him to be its supreme
head and 600,000 splendid soldiers that
will die for him on any battlefield. He
has plenty of money, plenty of credit for
more and is only sick when called upon to
pay his debts. Many a Christian warrior
will fall before the 'unspeakable Turk is
driven out of Europe, take my word for it.
"You have no idea how well an American
is treated in Constantinople, and also all
throueh the TurKish dominions. And it
is all because America has been so well
represented at the court of the Sultan. Our
Ministers never meddle with the affairs of
that empire as do the representatives of
European countries. Consequently the
legation of the United State 3 and the court |
of the ruler are socially close together. It
was by Mr. Terrell's efforts that the Ameri
can missionaries were not butchered with
the Armenians.
"The Sultan refused to permit the Red
Crosa Society to 20 into the country as an j
organization, but permitted them to do so j
as American citizens. Any American with ;
Minister Terrell's signature on his pass
port is safe in Turkey.
"I think the Armenian troubles are sub*
siding and I do not think that the slaughter
will begin again with thÂ« summer as has
been reported. Mr. Terrell is of that
opinion and he is in a position to know.
"The Sultan can stop all these horrors
with a word, but I fancy neither the Brit
ish lion nor the Russian bear is ready to
force him into speaking, for all be is the
Sick Man, so-called. They may be jealous
of each other, but they are more fearful of
his ability in a fight."
Mr. de Young bad learned little of
National political issues since his return,
and beyond Baying a word in favor of Mc-
Kin ley s chances for the Presidency, re
served his opinions.
Manufacturers and Producers.
The annual meeting of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association will be held to
morrow afternoon at 1 o'clock for the purpose
of electing officers. A number of matters will
be brought up for consideration. One of these
will be the discussion of the Home Industry
Fair which it is proposed to hold at no distant
day.
Ths Turkish Consul.
George E. Hall, wtio represents the Sultan of
Turkey in San Francisco, returned yesterday
from a visit to the Ottoman empire. During
his sojourn abroad, covering a period of sev
eral months, Mr. Hall visited England, France,
Germany and Italy.
Reynolds Gone to Washing-ton.
Lieutenant Reynolds, who conducted the
prosecution of Captain Healy airl Lieutenant
Daniels before the court-martial, has gone to
Washington, where he will be located perma
nently.

acknowledged, The Call is in receipt of the fol

WILLIAM PUT KELLOGG
The Famous Orator and Cam
paigner of Louisiana on a
Visit Here.
HAS FOUGHT MANY A BATTLE.
He Says He Is Perplexed as to Our
Present Financial StatusâA Safe
Man for President
Hon. William Pitt Kellogg, ex-United
States Senator from Louisiana and ex-
Governor of that State, famous as a fighter
and debater over the world, is at the
Palace.
The ex-Senator, in the days of recon
struction and long afterward, was one 0
William Pitt Kellogg, the Distinguished Ex-Governor and Ex-United States Sen
ator of Louisiana.
â¢ [Sketched from life by a "Call' artist.]
the most powerful men on the floor of Con
gress, and his tilts at various times with
Hampton, Blackburn, Brown, Sunset Cox
and others had made him known as one
of the readiest of speakers. When Blame,
Thurman and hosts of other statesmen
were at their height of power, William Pitt
Kellogg was at Washington, and his
speeches were always listened to with in
terest.
Any one who has followed his career
knows what a stormy time he had in
his own State. He was affirmed by Presi
dent Lincoln Chief Justice of Nebraska,
and served six months of each year on the
bench, from 1862 to 1864. The other six
montns he put in in the cause of the
Union, being often at Washington. Fin
ally Mr. Lincoln appointed him Collector
of the Port at New Orleans, and put his
name to the commission the afternoon be
fore he died, it being the last he ever
signed.
In Louisiana, at one time or another,
Mr. Kellogg has had most tragic experi
ences. It was very hot there after the
war. when the Ku Klux band was riding
forth at night, and when tragedies were
of frequent occurrence. Affrays growing
oat of political contests were the regular
thing. Mr. Kellogg has been often the
target at which murderous balls were
aimed, but beyond getting a part of one
ear clipped offone night, as he was riding
home in bis carriage, he remains sound
and whole.
The distinguished ex-Senator and ex-
Governor is of medium size, with blue
eyes, a white mustache and hair nearly
white. He is a singularly interesting
talker and a pleasing one, as well. Yes
terday he told how he had been in Cali
fornia on two occasions previously, and
each time with Congressional commis
sions. The lait time was in 1872, when
he came with Senator Thurman and others
equally notable. During that visit Mr.
Selby was Mayor of Ban Francisco.
Mr. Kellogg inquired about him and
about the locality of the grave of Senator
Brorforick. He never knew Broderick, but
had always, he said, been interested in
him. Mr. Kellogg also told how on one of
the occasions when he was here he met
Ralston, and was driven by him, in com
pany with other guests, to his handsome
country seat at Belmont.
Mr. Kellogg said he guessed he was get
ting a little old, though he didn't feel that
way, except when he recalled similar inci
dents in his active life. Then he adverted
to the political situation, saying he was
somewhat perplexed as to bow things were
coming out.
"I am a large property-holder," he Â»aid,
"at New Orleans, Omaha and other places,
and I have lately been making a stndy of
our present condition, especially in a finan
cial way. What causes me to be some
what more perplexed than usual was read
ing t&e otner day of Dun's commercial
report and a letter of Henry Clews. They
show the volume of trade, the imports and
the general conditions in an unsatisfactory
condition. I don't know just now we are
going to come out.
"Suppose we nominate another man for
President. Suppose it should be McKin
ley. He would be elected, I think, for I
have no doubt that any Republican nomi
nated will be, but then there are more
problems. With his ultra-idea of protec
tion the question is, Could he bring any
order out of the chaos? With the ardent
Populists and silver advocates, and so
many contending interests, I doubt if he
could pet enough votes in tne Senate to
pass his measures. The House would
stand by him, but in order to pet the wnole
matter before Congress he would have to
have a long extra session, and everybody
knows how wearisome that is.
'â¢Such Senators aa Dubois and Shoup of
Idaho, Allen of Nebraska and my old
friend Teller of Colorado, I am afraid, will
all stand oui for silver as against helping
out the protection measures, and tne only
thing to do would be to admit New Mexico
and get two Senators there who would act
as an offset. Even then there would
scarcely be enough to enable anything to
be done. There might be if two or three
votes were shifted around by death, or in
some other way, but at any rate it would
be by a close shave. I don't look for any
aid from Kentucky, for the matter is al
ready settled there, as I understand it, by
precedent. So this is, in a general way,
about bow things stand.
"Now, as to what Republican should
really be nominated. I think it should be
some safe, conservative man in whom the
people at large have confidence. Louisi
ana's delegates to the National Conven
tion are for Reed, but are unpledged. I
think Reed a good man, and he might be
the man of all others to be chosen, pro*
vided the people of the East have confi
dence in him and think that he will not
go too far with Western bimetallists. But
I should say Morton, if he was not consid
ered too old, for the first place, and a safe
man like Allison for the second place,
would not be at all bad. Then if the
President should die we would have a
good conservative man in his place.
"Or Allison might do lor President
at the start. I think he would make a
very good President. Everything consid
ered, 1 am hopeful that brighter times are
dawning. 1 am inclined to think, per
plexing as some of our political problems
are, that the next few months will see us
risiog on a firmer and better basis, and
that the next year, or say two years, at
most, will see us back to our old prosper-
Tbe distinguished gentleman was intro
duced at the Union League Club yester
day, where he met many prominent local
Republicans. He will be here rive or six
days, and will tnen visit other points in

THEIR CLUB LANGUISHES
Decline of Interest in the Con
gregational Monday
Meetings.
Methodist Pastors Discuss Possible
Reforms to Come in Their
Church.
Ever since the beginning of the Brown-
Davidson scandal the attendance at the
Congregational Club iias been growing
smaller by degrees and beautifully less.
Before Dr. Brown had Mrs. Davidson ar
rested the Congregational Club was noted
I for the advanced and energetic way in
j which it discussed the questions of the day,
but gradually since then the attendance has
fallen off and interest in the discussions
seems to have languished.
This decline in interest and attendance
has been attributed to the fact of some of
the club's leadine members being mem
bers of the council which was en
gaged in conducting the Brown in
vestigation. It was expected that when
the council's labors were ended the 'Con
gregational Monday Club would resume
its normal condition, but this was very
far from being the case yesterday. In fact
the attendance was so small that the Rev.
Mr. Kimball made the suggestion that
those present should move up to the front
U> be nearer together.
The subject of the scandal has been al
most entirely tabooed ever since Dr. Mc-
Lean made and carried a motion express
ing confidence in Dr. Brown, the first
Monday after the arrest of Mrs. Davidson.
Yesterday the proceedings were of ttiat
placid character which has marked the
Congreeational Monday Club of late.
Twice Mark Strauss tried to raise a ripple
of excitementâ once when he reported that
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper's Bible class had
been locked out of the First Church and
once when he declared that if Christ came
to the San Francisco churches he would
"condemn the scribes and Pharisees, hyp
ocrites, who make excuses for iniquity by
attributing it to unfortunate dispositions."
Mr. Strauss' remarks did not result in any
discussion, however. Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
explained pacifically tbat her class had
been invited to participate in the praise
services, and tne innuendo respecting
scribes and Pharisees passed without com
ment.
The paper yesterday was supplied by J.
M. Lewis, a student of the Theological
Seminary, nis subject having relation to
the coming of the kingdom of heaven.
Professor Lloyd, the president of the club,
announced that be would be unable to at
tend any longer on account of a coming
trip to Europe. A vote of thanks was ten
dered Professor Lloyd and Rev. W. Row
ell was elected president till the election
in May.
Methodist Preachers.
Rev. T. S. L. Wallis, who was to have
spoken at the Methodist Preachers' Club
yesterday morning, was unable to be pres
ent and, as a substitute for Mr. Wallis'
paper, the pastors discussed the question
of reforms in the M. E. Church.
Rev. Dr. Harris, who spoke first, said he
considered that no man holding an official
position in the Methodist Episcopal church
ought to be elected as a delegate to the
conference. He also said: "I would give
every lay member over 21 years of age the
right to vote. The lay element in the
churches should bo cultivated more ex
tensively." Rev. Dr. Matthew agreed in
giving more power to laymen, and Rev.
Dr. Chenoweth added: "A star-chamber
| conference is no longer possible." Rev.
Dr. Goodwin was satisfied with tho ma
chinery of the Methodist Episcopal church
as it is. A number of other opinions were
expressed on the policy of the Methodist
Episcopal church.
Presbyterian Union,
The Presbyterian Ministerial Fnion was
addressed yesterday by Rev. Dr. Fraser on
the subject of "Inspiration." The paper
was able and interesting and was indorsed
by all the pastors who took part in the
discussion.

Duncan Mills, Sonoma Co.,CaLSELLING STOLEN BONDS
Why Dr. Benjamin B. Lee Was
Arrested and Placed in
the Tanks.
SCHEME THAT FELL THROUGH.
William Loughridge, Alias Rodgers,
Supposed to Be a Missouri Bank
Robber.
The police reluctantly mad* public yes
terday the story of the man confined in
the '"tanks" for a fraudulent bond trans
action, which was referred to in yester
day's Call.
On February 7 the vault in the State
Bank at Savannah, Mo., was cracked and
fourteen $1000 thirty-year bonds, bearing
interest at 4 per cent, were stolen. The
bonds were the property of Mrs. Eliza
Brackenridge of Savannah, who offered a
reward of $1000 for their return, in addi
tion to the reward offered by the bank
officials. The bonds were numbered 114,
--10 1; 120,733 to 120,745, inclusive.
On March 11 Chief Crowley was notified
by telegram from Kansas City to arrest
"William Loughridge, Jake Weber, alias
'Dutch Jake," and William O'Brien,
alias John O'Brien, alias "Red" O'Brien,
alias John King, alias "Denver Red," the
last two being expert bank burglars.
The telegram was followed in a few days
by a letter fully detailing the facts of the
bank robbery, and that the ttiree men
mentioned in the telegram were suspected
of being the burglars.
As soon as a description of the bonds
was received Captain Lees communicated
with all the local banks, requesting to be
notified at once if any person attempted to
negotiate any of them.
In a few days Captain Lees located
Louguridge in a house on Devisadero
street, where he and his wife were living
"with relatives. He found also that he had
obtained employment in the otlice of a
real estate firm.*
Detective Harry Reynolds and three
men were detailed to "shadow" Lough
ridge, but no developments occurred till
last Friday. On that day A. T. Johns,
stock broker on Market" street, notified
Captain Lees that Dr. Benjamin B. Lee,
400 Geary street, had asked his assistance
in the sale of two of the stolen bonds â
2s os. 120,737 and 120,738. Acting on the
captain's advice Mr. Johns requested Dr.
Lee to return on Saturday.
On (Saturday Mr. Johns took Dr. Lee to
the Market-street Bank, where the bonds
"were submitted to Cashier Hopkins, who,
by pre-arrangement, asked Dr. Lee to
accompany him to the Bank of California,
as he was not familiar with the bonds.
Detective Ross Whitaker was detailed to
wait outside the Market-street Bank and
follow Cashier Hopkins and Dr. Lee to
the California Bank. Then he was to
"shadow" Dr. Lee with the object of dis
covering the person with whom he was
dealing, as the Bank of California people
were to make some excuse for not pur
chasing the bonds outright.
The saying that "the best laid schemes
of mice and men gang aft ngley," was ex
emplified in this case. When Cashier
Hopkins entered the Bank of California
witu Dr. Lee he looked around to see if
Detective Whitaker was in sight. Whita
ker was standing on the opposite side of
the street, but Hopkins did not see him,
and fearing that Dr. Lee might get away
he called in the policeman on the beat and
had the doctor placed under arrest.
This unexpected action of Cashier Hop
kins killed the whole scheme and Dr. Lee
was -hurried out to the City Prisou and
placed in the "tanks." Detective Reynolds
and his men were instructed to arrest
Loughridge at once, and they surrounded
the house on Devisadero street, about 8
o'clock that night. A search of the house
was made, but Loughridge had fled. He
was discovered in the act of climbing over
the rear fence and was ordered to surren
der.
He was secured and handcuffed and
taken to police headquarters. When
searched in Captain Lees' room a loaded
revolver was found in the pocket of his
overcoat and a $100 bill concealed in the
lining oi his coat. He at first denied his
identity, saying his name wa3 William
Rodgers and that he was from Texas, but
when asked if the woman livinsr in the
house and known as Mrs. Loughridge was
not his wife He admitted be was the man.
He denied any knowledge of the Savannah
bank robbery and said he did not know Dr.
Lee.
Captain Hems of the Pinkerton agency
was immediately notified of the arrest of
Loughridge and hurried to police head
quarters, where he remained for hours in
consultation with Captain Lees.
Loughridge's trunk was taken from the
house on Devisadero street to police head
quarters, but an examination of Us con
tents did not disclose any pf the stolen
bonds.
The Kansas City authorities were noti
fied of Loughridge's arrest on Sunday and
a reply was received yesterday that an offi
cer would leave at once to take him back.
Loughridge does not propose to go back if
he can help it and has retained Carroll
Cook to look, after his interest. Carroll
Cook yesterday applied foj a writ of
habeas corpus hefore "Judge Slack, which
was made returnable at 10 o'clock this
morning. In order to hold Loughridge a
charge of carrying concealed weapons was
booked against him.
W. Lee, it seems, claims that he is the
innocent victim of others, who led him to
believe that the bonds were good and he
thought he was engaged in a perfctly legit
imate transaction.
Captain Lees was at first of the opinion
that Weber and O'Brien were also here,
but he does not think so now and believes
that the burglars divided their plunder
and parted company.
Captain Lees last night received the fol
lowing dispatch from L. E. Irvin, Chief of
Police of Kansas City, in reference to the
arrest of Loughridge : : "Burglarie ing the
State Bank of Savannah, Andrew County,
Mo., on the night of February 7, when
114,000 in United States Government bonds,
denomination $1000 each, were stolen, the
property of Eliza Brackenridge. Other
property and money taken amounting to
about $4000, belonging to various parties.
Application has been made to the Governor
for a requisition on ilie Governor of Cali
fornia for the return of W T illiam Long
bridge. Cofnplaint filed March 23, before
I'embroisfe Mercer, Justice oi the Peace, by
E. C. Trumbo, son-in-law of Mrs. Bracken
ridge, at Savannah."
Tbe Captain said last night that he did
not think Lee had received the bonds
directly frotu Loughridge, but he felt sure
they were iot indirectly from him. Just
who tbe -ot^er party was he had not yet
been able to'find out.
The other party is believed to be Alfred
Holmes, an Â«x-sa!oon-keeper, who it was
reported on Sunday was also in the tanks,
from the fact tnat many inquiries were
inndeat the tyty Prison for him. Unfor
tunately the rtport was not true, but the
police have been and still are hopeful of
being able to aapture him. Holmes it is
said, was the own who introduced Lee to
Mr. Johns, the stockbroker.
Holmes and LÂ«e and two or three others
are believed Â«to belong to an organized
trang of as clever Confidence operators and
all-round crooks fis ever existed on this
continent. Lougfcridge, Jake Weber and
"Kea" O'Brien v;eje also members of the
same gane.
Holmes was a cfcar drummer wben he
came to this City several years ago. He
and George LablaV che . the "Marine;"
opened a saloon enwockton street. He
was known to be a I>al of Louis Matheny
and Joe Twohill. the\ burglars, the latter.
it will be remembered having been killed
in Oakland during Â» burglary there in
which Matheny was Â»uto implicated. He

was also a pal of "Dink" Wilson, Larry
Brown and "Court" Thompson, all clever
crooks.
About seven years ago Tommy Ellis and j
his brother George, who were dice sharp
ers, beat a prominent business man in
Holmes' saloon out of $7000 by shaking
dice. He had $700 in gold on him and for
the balance he gave them his notes. Lee
was next morning sent to the business
man to collect tbe value of the notes, but
he had learned of the character of the
brothers Ellis and refused to honor them.
There was a big row over the affair, but
the business man carried his point.
Subsequently George Fair, a notorious
pickpocket, was arrested for picking a
woman's pocket on a Geary-street car.
Lee interceded for him and tried hard to
get him acquitted, but he was convicted
and sent to Han Quentin.
Holmes lived with a woman named
Amy Howard at 107 Ellis street. Four
years ago he fired a shot al her, but
missed her. He was arrested, but as she
refused to prosecute him the case was
dismissed.
Four or five years ago Thompson and
Jordan, another confidence man, assisted
by Lee, put up a job on Ned Fester.
They represented to him that a business
man was anxious to put up $10,000 on a
footrace, backing a certain man, and as
they knew of a sprinter who could easily
beat him it would be a sure thing. -They
induced Foster to put up $4000, which was
handed over to Thompson as referee and
Thompson absconded with the money.
Foster made such a "kick" that he got
$2000 back.
Clinton Smith, alias Green, was another
of the gang. He was arrested about three
years ago for assault to murder, the com
plaining witness Deing Mrs. Claude Lee.
Jordan went on his bond, and Smith dis
appeared. Jordan was arrested for perjury
in connection with the bond, but macaged
to beat the case, and left the City. "He
and Smith shortly afterward -swindled a
mart in Btocktor. by the "gold brick"
method and are now serving time in
Folsom.
Tbe police know of other confidence
tricks in which Holmes and Lee have fig
ured. Lee's assumption of the title "Dr."
was simply a cloak.
Two other men were arrested last night
in connection with tbe bond transaction
and placed in the "tanks." It was im
possible to procure their names, but it is
thought that one of them is Holmes.
THEY'RE GOING FAST.
The Whole Town Talking About That
Dictionary Distribution.
That San Francisco and surrounding
communities are quick to appreciate
anything meritorious in a literary
or educational way - is clearly shown
by the alacrity with which read
ers have hastened to secure one of
those introdnctory sets of the new En
cyclopaedic Dictionary which the Newspa
per Syndicate is distributing on nominal
terms, so that the work may find a place
in the homes of cultured and discriminat
ing people, there to be compared with
other dictionaries and encyclopedias.
A limited number of sets of four volumes
each were offered a few days since, and it
is quite safe to say there are now very few
of them left.
It is expected that the last of them will
have been allotted by to-morrow night,
possibly by this evening, after which time
the price will be advanced.
Applications have been numerous, not
only from City folk, but from out-of-town
people, who rightly appreciate the oppor- j
tunitv afforded.
The Syndicate headquarters, at 36 Mont
gomery street, are thronged throunhout
the day by those desirous of inspecting and
securing the work.
The rule "first come, first served," is
strictly followed, which means that those
who first apply, either personally or by
letter, with their initial payment of $1, get
tbe volumes.
To say "they're going fast" is strictly
within the truth, for the distribution has
for some days been the talk of the town,
and will close all too soon for those who
hesitate or delay.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
POOLMEN MUST GIVE UP
Important Decision â¢ by Judge
Low on the Downtown
Resorts. .
MONEY SENT BY TELEGRAPH.;
The Judge Holds That This Process Is
Merely a Subterfuge to Evade ,
the Law.
Â An important decision was , rendered by
Judge Low yesterday morning Yin regard
to tbe poolroom question, which shatters
the only hope left by the poolsellers under
the recent Wallace decision.. V .- V :
'.Last Thursday, in the case of V James
Bowlan, it was argued by Attorney Julius
Kahn that if it was a crime to gamble on
a horse race the parties, who should suffer
were the ones who m&de the bets/ and not
the commission men. â¢ The San Jose pool
room men . with whom : the money r had
been placed through the Postal Telegraph
Company, and the patrons of the commis
sion-houses here", were . the parties en
gaged in the aileged violation of the ordi
nance. ; The poolroom men here as com
mission men stood on â  identical grounds
with the men who bought and sold stocks
for another. V V;-' V-' V- VV'VV'
The decision of Judge Low. is as follows:
The defendant in this case is charged with
selling a pool-ticket outside of â¢ the racetrack
in this City and J County.; in violation 'of : the
order ', of the Board of Supervisors; No. 2361.
His defense ii. that the bet was made by the
complaining witness with the bookmaklng
firm of Messiuger &.CO. of San Jose, and that
he, the defendant,' and the firm with which he
is - employed, acted > as ' agents for â¢ the â : bettor
solely. It is - claimed by the defendant â¢ that
the decision In the case of Lascalette vs. the
Commonwealth, decided by the Supreme Court
of Appeals of . Virginia . and reported in the
Southeastern . Reporter (Vol. 17, page 500),
governs this case, and that he is not guilty of
violating this ordinance because the bet, as he
claims; was made in San Jose and that that
is where the bet was, accepted. That decision I
in substance is that a man in the State of Vir- !
ginia, where betting' on horseraces is prohib- j
ited, who sends money to (mother State where '
horseracing: is' not \ prohibited, either by tele- I
graph .-- transferor sends it ; by , express, for
the purpose of playing it on a horserace, and
the bet is accepted there, that the bet is made '
in that case where it â is . accepted, viz. : where
betting * is t not ' prohibited, and ; that the man
who sent it from Virginia is not guilty of vio
lating the law of the State of Virginia. There
is no question about , that being â  the â  law, of
course. - >â . â  ' .;-â  ; . " â -. .;, â ;> â - -;.<;.; â  K';->^ :;
7 Betting on a horse race is not prohibited in
this State. This case is a little different from
the Virginia case in that respect, because bet
ting on horse races is not prohibited by statute
in this State. But the Board of Supervisors has
seen fit/for reasons which seem proper to them,
to prohibit the selling of pools on a horse race
in any other place in this City and County
other than on a racetrack. Now this ordinance,
commonly known as the Ellert ordinance, re
cites as a reason for its passage as follows: ;//
Wxebeas, It has become apparent " that the
practice of gambling | on ' horse races has become
alarmingly prevalent, and Is the cause of debauch
ing many of our I boys ami young men. tendering
them until for the honorable occupations of life;
and whereas, this discreditable occupation,' with
all ' its 'â  vicious â â â  results, Is '; allowed *In '-.' all "â ', its
Alluring features 110 occupy j places lln t the busi
ness portions of / our City,": enticing ' our s youth
into habits which ultimately effect their ruin and
degradation ; and whereas, it is asserted that there
is no legislation | prohibitory of this nefarious and
demoralizing pursuit being conducted and carried
on, the . present ' Legislature < having | failed to paw
any of , the I bills j Introduced for that Durpose ; - now
therefore the People of the City and County of Sao
Francisco do ordain aÂ» follows:" ; -> - r - â¢
And theu passed this act, which limits betting
on horseraces to the track. There is a lino of
decisions, which it is not necessary to quote
here * now, which hold that in such cases
gambling of different kinds may be limited to
certain places. Th^t question, however, is not
raised In this case.
The defense here is that no bet is made in San
Francisco; that the poolroom people do not
make bets with their patrons, but simply re
ceive the money on commission and trausmit
it to San Jose and there bet it for them outside
tne jurisdiction oT tllis City and transact the
business there. If that is so. then, of course,
no offense has been committed in San Fran
cisco. It then comes down to simply a ques
tion of fact as to what they are really doing.
What are the facts, then, as shown by the evi
dence, both parol aud documentary, in this
case?
The defendant received the money of the
complaining witness in this case and issued a
card to him, designating on that card what
lhatbetwa?. It was a bet on a horse called
Cabrillo of 25 cents straightâ that is, that the
horse Cabrillo would wiii the race; and it was
made in conformity with the odds posted up
in the room of the defendant here in San
Francisco. When the money was placed an
additional 5 cents wa? claimed by him as a
commission for transmitting the money to San
Jose. It is claimed here thnt a like amount
was required on every bet, whatever the
amount of the bet might be. I understand
from the evidence that whether the bet wus 25
cents, $25 or $100 the same amount wa^ de
manded, viz.: 5 cents and no more. That is,
the compensation is not regulated by the value
of the services rendered. And that would
lead me to suppose, that this 5 cents was mere
ly put on hs a subterfuge to take the case out
of the provisions of the ordinance. Because, if
they were charging for their services they cer
tainly would charge in proportion to the ser
vice rendered. A man certainly would not
charge the same for makingabet of 25 cents
and transmitting the '25 cents to Han Jose
and placing it on a race and going to the ex
pense of telegraphing, as lie would for making
a bet of $25 or $100 and transmitting that.
The evidence shows that it costs about 1%
per cent for transmitting Die money down to
ban Jose and lj<j per cent for transmitting
back the winnings. It would be worth more
to send $25 to ban Jose than 25 cents. The
evidence shows that ibe telegraph company
charges \ x 2 per cent for transmission. That
would be, on $25, 3~}4 cents, and if the bettor
won at even money, another 75 cents Mould
have to be paid to the telegraph company to
send the money back from San Jose. Then
there is all the expense of the leased wire and
operator, who is engaged by them, to
say nothing of the rent ot the place
of business here in the City, clerk
hire for making out betting-sheets, etc.,
their printing, and all these incidental ex
penses of running the business, which would
amount to many dollars per day. Of course
he gets 5 per cent additional from the firm in
San Jose, aud that leads me to think that hav
ing received a commission of 5 per cent from
the firm in San Jose, it makes the people here
the agents for tbe firm in San Jose, and they
are acting here in San Francisco as their
agents, and the betting is closed here in San
Francisco through this agency here.
The fourth race, the one in which this bet
was made, included ninety-one betsâ that is,
if even counting the two bets on a ticket-that
is what I just asked the witness, if he con
sidered straight and place two bets, or otilv
one bet, and he said, " He would charge 5
cents for both of them, giving him the benefit
of both place and straight; there were ninety
one bets made on the fourth race, aggregating
$117 50. The amount won by the bettors was
$67 50, leaving a profit to the bookmnkerof
just $50. Who made this? The witness just
said that Messinger & Co. of San Jose made
that, lets the commission they paid him, for
obtaining these bets for them. The delendant
claims that he did not make that $67 50, but
simply made 5 per cent on those amounts of
money, and in addition thereto 5 cents on
each bet. Now, 5 cents on each of the ninety
one bets would amount to $4 55. But, as ne
claims, he had to pay out $1 90 to the tele
graph company to send $117 50 to San Jose,
and at the same rate it would cost $1 01 to
send back the $67 50, this $2 91 would come
out of his profit of $4 55 and leave only $1 64
on that business transacted on that fourth race.
Assuming thst they made about the same on
the six races that day, then they would have
made about $9 84 as the day's profit. Mes
singer & Co. paid them 5 i-er cent on $117;
that .would leave $5 85. Add that to tfte other,
tbe $1 64, and that would be $7 49 for trans
acting that volume of business, out of which
mustl>e paid all these expenses.
Mr. Bchwartz says in his testimony: "I get a
commission from them for all the money I
send." It seems to me that that would consti
tute, as I said before, an agency, and that the
bets would be consummated and closed here in
San Francisco through their agent here. In
the transcript, folio 15, he also says:
-The Courtâ Who is the bet made with?
"Mr. Kahnâ lt is made with Messinger & Co.
of San Jose. That is, the bet is made by the
complaining witness with them.
"The Courtâ This man is not betting with
Mewing-e:. <&. Co.?
"Mr. Kahnâ He is told before he sets tbe
ticket tb-' ihls firm don't do any betting, and
that hi& >*t is with Messinger & Co. of San
Jose."
The evidence shows the ticket was made oat
and given 10 him without anything being said â 
about where the bet was nÂ»ade, and if he de
rived any information from the back of that
ticket in regard to their way of doing business
his information was derived after his bet was
made and after his ticket wns handed to him,
and not before.
"Q.â Did you get this card before you made
your bet? A.â No, sir.
"Q.â Then you had no chance to read that
until after your transaction,.. was complete?
i A.â Not until alter my money was passed to
them.
"Q.â Then they handed you a piece of paper
similar to this one? A.â Yes, sir.
"Q.â You had no chance to read that con
tract until they pave it to you? A.â No, sir."
But it does not make any difference what is
j printed on this card, or that they have as
I many signs as they have put up in the betting
i room" that there is no betting. The question
i here is simply what they are actually doing.
! You could not say if you went into a place
where faro was being played that because
I there were eighs placed about the room sayine
that no faro-playing wns to be permitted'that
they were not actually playing faro. That
would be absurd. It cuts no figure what signs
they have placed about the room. The ques
tion is, Did they <lo any betting? Were they
selling pool tickets?
After all it comes flown to the original prop
osition: Was the defendant and his firm mak
ing a book on the race at Ineleside and selling
pool-tickets 0:1 the same? I" am satisfied be
yond a reasonable doubt that they were, and
that the San Jose connection with the firm of
Mcxsinger & Co. was established mÂ«rely to get
the track odds as telegraohed from the track
to San Jose, and such other information as to
jockey*, and so forth as was necessary to make
the bew. That any man or tirm would go to
! the trouble and expense of procuring bettors
I for some book-making firm in San Jose without
any interest other than this 5 per cent, which
is mentioned here, is simply absurd, because
it would not pay to do it. It would not half
pay the expenses of running this place alone.
I am satisfied that this circumlocution office,
with which Uoldtree & Co. are doing butiuess
(that office in San Jose which could be properly
styled (1 a circumvention office") was estab
lished for tnat purpose.
It reminds me very mucb of this class of
liquor cases where they sell you a cracker
and give away a glass of whisky, or claim that
they aie acting under a restaurant license be
cause they have a gas stove on which & chop
or an egg'can be cooked. It is simply an effort
to do indirectly what the law says shall not
be done. Thu law frowns upon all such at
tempts to evade the plain meaning of the
statutes and strip the transactions of all sub
terfuge*.
Now if what Mr. Schwartz says is true, that
tliev are paying him a commission, then they
are the agents here of that firm, and every bet
they receive at the window they receive as a
bet and as the agent for that firm, and the bet
is taken and accepted right there and theu on
t&e spot.
A man cannot go outside of the State or out
side of the city where a thing is prohibited and
leave a man in that place to do that prohib
ited business, and then simply say he is inno
! cent because he lives in another place where it
! is, not prohibited, and consequently the law
liBH not b*n broken.
There are two views to take of this. One is,
that they are acting as the agent, and if so the
betting is done here in San Francisco. lam
satisfied this whole method is pursued simply
for the purpose of avoiding the ordinance, and
they are selling pools in this City in violation
of that ordinance. There are several other
things that I could say about it that lead mo
to think so in regard 40 these transfers. It is
carried on. in such a way simply to try and
show that they are doing it in San Jose. All
these things are perfectly uselessâ the sending
a ticKet the day after the money is paid out,
and so on.
Tbe defendant was found guilty and or
dered to appear for sentence this morning.
The other defendants are I. Goldtree, B.
Messinger, Frank Smith, L. Rothschild,
Hugh Rothschild, Mark Jacobs, J. Messin
ger aud L. Black.

ARCHITECTS IN SUSPENSE
Supervisors Still Deadlocked Re
garding the Municipal
Building.
SHEA & SHEA HAVE SIX VOTES.
Hog Ranches May Be Given Three
Months to Move to Other
Localities.
Shea & SheaG, Banks 5, Mooser& Mooser
1 was the result announced by CJerk Rus
sell of the Board of Supervisors when a
vote Mas taken yesterday at the close of
the meeting of the board to decide which
of the competing architects is to receive
the contract for supervising the erection
of the new municipal building.
The ballot showed that the feelings of
the members had not changed since the
last meeting, and another ballot was
called for. Again Shea & Shea were short
one vote to get the plan, and after motions
to postpone the matter for three and six
months had been lost, in the iormer in
stance by a narrow margin, the matter
went over until next Monday's meeting.
The Supervisors voted as follows:
For Shea & Sheaâ King, Scully, Hirsch,
Dimond, Taylor and Hobbs.
For Banks â Benjamin, Hughes, Dunlcer,
Morgenstern anrt SpreckeU.
For Mooser &. Mooserâ Wagner.
The matter of extending the hop-ranch
limits beyond the Excelsior and Bay View
homesteads was hud over for a week by
the board after the members had shown
an inclination to grant the request of the
Board of Health in the matter, and at the
Mine tive gave the hog-ranchers time to
remove their objectionable animals to
other localities.
Tne report of the committee appointed
at the last meeting to investigate the mat
ter which recommended that action be de
layed for six months was received, and
then a motion was made to extend the
limits, with a "proviso that the regulation
should not go into effect lor ninety days.
Health Officer Lovelace and Dr. William
son of the Board of Health were present,
and both declared the ranches in the
Bay View district to be a nuisance'and a
menace to the public health. The mem
bers of the board who favor giving the
ranchers six months to vacate their places
succeeded in having the matter deferred
for a week. It is probable that, unless
some action is tasen by the board at its
next meeting, the health authorities will
declare tne Bay View ranches a nuisance
and condemn them.
A resolution requesting the California
Senators and representatives in Congress
to advocate the passage of a bill for the
recognition of the Trans-Mississippi and
International Congress to be Held in
Omaha, and for a liberal appropriation for
a Government building and exhibit was
adapted.
The resolution was adopted, making it
necessary in future for all applicants for
free licenses to appear before the License
Committee and be examined as to their
financial condition and ability to pay for a
license.
A resolution was passed calling the at
tention of the Superintendent of Streets to
the provision of the general orders pro
hibiting obstructions to streets, and re
questing him to immediately enforce it by
causing the removal from the streets and
sidewalks obstructions of any description
unless the same is maintained by permis
sion of the board.
The position of operator of the fire alarm
and police telegraph, held by F. E. Has
kell, was declared vacant, and Joseph H.
Blakely appointed to the place.
The order prohibiting open poker games
was referred back to the Judiciary Com
mittee to have it remodeled to conform
with the views of the District Attorney,
who recently rendered an opinion that the
measure as originally framed is unconsti
tutional.
A resolution was passed indorsing the
memorials which have been presented to
Congress by the San Francisco committee
on commerce asking for an appropriation
for harbor improvements. The matters
desired are the removal of dangerous rocks
in the bay, a steam fog vessel for the en
trance to the harbor, a cable to the south
east Farallon island, a house for the
telegraph operator at Point Reyes, ex
haustive observations of the currents of
the bay, a fog-sienal station on the north
east Farallon island, fairway marks on

HELD FOR MARRS` DEATH
A Coroner's Jury Throws the
Responsibility on D. J.
Dunn.
Charles Gerkin Had No Murderous
Intent in Causing the Death
of John Buckle?.
Daniel J. Dunn, one of the striking
lathers who are charged with assaulting
Charles A. Marrs, who died on March li),
was yesterday held responsible, along with
others unknown, with striking the fatal
blows. A large number of witnesses were
examined before the Coroner's jury.
Dr. Cachot testified that when called in
to attend Marrs, shortly after the assault
upon him, he found him unconscious.
Thirty-six hours later Marrs recovered
consciousness and told the physician that
he had been attacked by strikers. The
deceased was then suffering from paraly
sis. There was a bruise on the nose;
otherwise there were no injuries. Great
excitement, in the opinion of the witness,
might have caused death.
C. F. Marrs, son of the deceased con
tractor, identified Daniel J. Dunn as the
man who assaulted his father while they
were at work in a house at Fourth and
Welsh streets on March 10. He said that
a number of strikers came into the build
ing and called to him and his father to
come down from the scaffolding where
they were working at the time. They did
so, and later were attacked by the men.
When the witness went to the assistance
of his father he was struck down. The
deceased complained of pains in his head
after the aesault. Be was unable to speak
for three days, and died on March 19.
Thomas Marrs, another son of the de
ceased, also identitied Dunn as the assail
ant of his father.
Mrs. Marrs. widow of the deceased, testi
fied that her husband had a large lump on
the back of his head as the result of the
beating which he told her he had received
at the hands of the strikers. Dunn,
McCoy and Haley were mentioned by the
deceased as among his assailants. She
also stated that the physician did not ex
amine the bsck of her husband's head for
several days, and by that time the lump
had passed away.
Oflicer Geimann testified that the de
ceased had identified Dunn, who was
brought to his bedside on March 10, as the
man who assaulted him. James Holmes
and William Pattee did not assault him.
Dr. J. S. Barrett, the autopsy physician,
said that death had been caused by a
hemorrhage of the brain. The condition
of the arteries, however, were such that
apoplexy might be caused under excite
ment.
In the case of John Buckley, who was
knocked down by Charles Gerkin, and
who died on March 19. the Coroner's jury
returned a verdict to the effect that death
was the result of injuries received by the
deceased falling on the pavement, and
that the fall was caused by a blow struck
by Gerkin without murderous intent.

The club has given seventy consecutive :
monthly illustrated exhibitions to andi- j
ences numbering from 700 to 1500 people.
In a convent of Wheeling, W. Va., Mrs. A.
G. McFarland, wife of the club's presi

California Camera Club was highly prized
and quite well known.

The rooms last evening were so densely |
thronged with spectators that one could j
hardly get an opportunity to study the j
pictures of the vast collection. Six hun- j
dred invitations were sent out and 4000 '
cards distributed. The attendance last j
night approximated 400. '

AT HARMON GYMNASIUM
Celebration of the Twenty-Eighth
Birthday of the University
of California.
HORATIO STEBBINS' PICTURE.
Freshmen Beat the Sophomores in a
Hard-Fought Rushâ Cornell to
Meet Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23.â The
State University's twenty-eighth birthday
was celebrated to-day by the rendering of
an interesting programme of exe-cises in
tne Harmon Gymnasium. President Kel
logg presided and the Rev. E. Lyman
Wood, president of the graduate club,
acted as chaplain.
The first speaker was Miss Millicent W.
Shinn, IT. C. '80, whose subject was "An
Empirical Suggestion." Miss Shinn dealt
with various methods of education that
pre in vogue and with their respective
claims to superiority. She called atten-

cises Yesterday.
tion to literature's lack of any exhaustive
treatise telling of the comparative results
achieved by such method*.
Miss Shina was followed by William
Nathaniel Friend '9(5, the president of the
.student body. In Mr. Friend's address,
which wag on "The Significance of Recent
Events," the student body of BerKeley was
likened to a miniature political ?tate. The
speaker traced the life of the college state
from its organization twenty-eight ran
ago to the present, telling in brief of tlie
early rise of an "aristocracy," the control
of the government, its division into
quarreling factions and fraternities and ol"
its final overthrow by the "plebeians."
"The two pariies still exist at Berkeley," |
said Mr. Friend, "but they have united
against the common enemy. The cure for
a nation divided against itself is the ap
pearance of a common foe." Thus Stan
ford's advent was declared to have unified
the factions of Berkeley, making possible
such harmonious student enterprises as
the Eastern athletic tour of last spring,
which was supported by all students, and
such exhibitions of united college spirit as
was the action of the students in forming
themselves into a pick and shovel brigaue
for the beautilication of the grounds of
their alma mater.
After a song by the Glee Club Louis de
Fonteney Bartlett of the riastines Law
College spoke on "American Law Col
leges." Mr. Bartlett told of the great in
crease in the number of law colleges that
has recently taken place, there being but
few such colleges in the country fifty
years ago. He outlined a number of
methods of instruction in law and advo
cated a more strict examination of aspir
ants for admission to tie bar.
Professor J. If. Stilhnan of Stanford
University, a graduate of the University
of California, delivered an address on
""Some Responsibilities of the Modern
University* Professor Stillman said that
there is at present no general agreement
among the great universities of the world
as to the best system of higher education .
"The reasons for this lie near the sur
face," said he. " The machinery of civil- !
! ization has become so complex that the I
j need of edncated men and women has
become more manifest. The sum of use
ful ana important knowledge and the de
mands upon the university system become
more ana more exacting. The mass of
subjects in every department of thought
is becoming raxndly greater, and the diffi
culty of mastering it is correspondingly
increased."
He declared that money spent in the ed
ucation of capable political economists, i
j capable engineers, so that coatly errors to |
i such fields of labor might be avoided, re- j
turned to the State several times over in i
actual cash.
Tne last speaker was Professor Thomas |
R. Bacon of the department of history in j
the University of California. Professor .
Bacon'a subject was "Our Foreign Policy
tad the World's Peace." The professor j
said ne would assume that peace is a good j
, thing, though like the axioms of mathe- |
matics the proposition could be disputed
i by those disposed to argue it. He referred
i to recent speeches in the United States
â  Senate as "frantic voices' for war and said
I that certain Senators "demand war at any
! priceâ not war with any one in particular,
j but war for its own sake. If not witn Eng
land, war with Spain, and if not with the
; latter with some nation that could be
| fought with even more safely than might
Spain."
Professor Bacon said he had high respect
for the aims of pnilanthropists who would
establish international courts of arbitra
tion, but that he had no respect for their
judgment. War, he declared, would
always be a part of history as long as hu
man nature remains as it "is. The profes
sor advocated closer diplomatic relations
between England and the United States.
At tne conclusion of the speeches came
the formal presentation to the university
of the portrait of Dr. Horatio Stebbina,
which has for some time been in the uni
versity library. The speech of presenta
tion. prepared by the principal donor, John
Perry Jr. of San Francisco, was read by
Professor William Carey Jones. The other
donors were: Regents Crocker, Bartlett, t
Wallace, Slack, Rodsers, Houghton,
Mayne, Hallidie ard Hellman and Messrs.
H. JT. Crocker and J. D. Phelan, President
Kellogg, Professors Howison, Le Conte
and Hilgard.
The committee appointed to receive the
picture consisted of: Regents Hallidie,
Martin and Hough ton and Professors
Howison, Le Conte and Haskell. Presi
dent Kellogg responded to the address of
presentation, accepting the portrait in be
half of the university, ard paying a high
tribute to Dr. Stebbins, who was one of
the first regents of the university.
In the afternoon an old-fashioned hop
took place in the gymnasium, but on ac
count of the extreme heat of the day the
crowd was not large.
Sophomores Vanquished.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 23.â About
seventy-five Berkeley students from the
freshman and sophomore classes had a
rush this morning on the hill back of the
library, which resulted in a victory for the
freshmen. The first signs of the combat
made themselves manifest at about 4
o'clock this morning, when twenty fresh
men appeared on tne hill with an abun
dant supply of whitewash for the purpose
of leaving their "99" on the mountain side.
Some sophs heard of this, and in a few
minutes the news was heralded through
the neighborhood, and long before day
break a number equal to that of the
freshies were on th? scene, and a fierce
battle, lasting for four hours, ensued.
Reinforcements came to the assistance
of both classes, and by 8 o'clock at least
seventy-five men were at the scene of the
struggle. Pairs of first and second-year
men scattered here and there over an
area of several acres indulging in friendly
combat. At last. the sophomores were
vangnished and the victorious freshmen
were permitted to plant their class num
ber on the hill in full view of the charter
day visitors at the university. This was
the first victory which the fre-hmen have
scored over the sophomores since their en
trance to college, and in consequence
supreme delight reigns among them. In
their rush against the sophomores last
fall they were badly defeated, and the loss
of that struggle registered the first defeat
of a freshman class By the sophomores
since 1884.
Cornell Want* a Meet.
BERKELEY. Cal., March 23.â Another
Eastern college wants to meet the Uni
versity of California team should they
make a transcontinental trio again this
summer. Cornell has fallen into line, and
her athletes desire to try conclusions
against the Berkeley cracks. To-day Cap
tain Merwin received the following letter
from Charles F. Hamilton, manager of the
Cornell team, asking what dates are open
and what he thought of a meet between
the two institutions:
Ithaca, H. V., March 17, 1896.
Manaaer of University of California Track
Teamâ l)ear Sir: Hearing tnat it is quite prob
able that you will have an athletic team in
the East during the coming spring, I write to
ask if it would be possible for Cornell to
arrange track graines with you. Should this
idea strike you favorably, kindly let me ki.ow
what dates you have vacant, and also your
views as to an agreement. Looking for an
early reply. I am, yours truly,
Charles F. Hamilton,
Manager Cornell Track Team.
25 Quarry street.
This makes the fourth encouraeing com
munication/received from the Eastern and
Middle West colleges within the last ten
days, and Captain Merwin says that if a
few more like them are forthcoming, to
gether with assurances of good gate re
ceipts, the trip will be a possibility, if not
an extreme probability.
"We are certain," said Mr. Friend, the
prospective manager, to-day, "that we can
arrange for all the contests we are able to
enter while on the tour, but what we want
is cash as "well as cordial receptions, good
tracks and appreciative audiences. We
must have the wherewithal to make the
trip, and not get into debt. The students
and friends of the university lent the team
of last year their heartiest financial sup
port, and it was through them that we
were able to send the team across the con
nent, but this year we do not want to call
on them if it is possible to do otherwise.
Captain Merwin has sent letters to
Eastern institutions other than those
already mentioned as having been favora
bly disposed toward arranging for contests,
and is daily awaitin* replies. He has
written to Vale and to Princeton since re
ceiving dispatches from them regarding
meets, and expects answers within a few
days.
Suicide of -T. B. Aghworth.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 23. â A
pitiable case of suicide was reported to
the branch morgue at 3 o'clock this aft
ternoon. Joseph B. Asbworth, a butcher,
residing at 715 Bristol street, corner of
Fourth, took carbolic acid at about 2
o'clock, and within half an hour he was
dead, leaving a widow and five children,
the eldest of which is 5 years and the
youngest 1 month. The family is left in a
destitute condition.
A .-h worth came home at about 1:30 and
asked his wife for some carbolic acid to
apply to a corn. She gave it to him,
and going into his room shortly after
ward he swallowed the contents of
the bottle. He called to his
wife to come and kiss him good-bye. She
went to his side and found that he had
taken poison. She gave him vaseline and
meJted lard, but it Was of no avail. Dr.
Payne was called for, but arrived too late
to be of any service.
The cause of Ashworth's rash act is at
tributed to despondency over financial af
fairs. He is reported to have defaulted to
the amount or $700 from his late em
ployer, Storck of West Berkeley. Rumors
have been about that detectives were on
Ashworth's track and that he put himself
out of the way in order to avoid further
trouble. He was a native of Trinity
County, aged 37 years, atid had lived in
Berkeley tor three years. An inquest will
c held to-morrow evening.
VACATION FOR MR. MARTIN
Some Changes Talked About in
the Art Associa
tion.
BOSQUI IS NOT ADMIRED.
Candidates on the Regnlar Ticket
Who Favor New Methods of
Management.
The annual election of directors of the
San Francisco Art Association, which
takes place March 31, may not call out a
large vote, as there is only one ticket in
the field. The only candidate mentioned
for the presidency is Horace G. Platt, and
the present indications are that he will be
chosen without opposition. Mr. Platt
denies, with a good deal of animation, the
statement made by some other members
of the association, and published in The
Call, that Mr. Searles desires his election.
The information comes from a source
deemed authentic that the new board of
directors will cause many changes to be
made in the method of conducting the in
stitution on the hill. One report is to the
effect that Mr. Martin, the secretary, will
receive a pension or a long vacation. There
is talk, also, of readjusting the class of
teachers, and placing one of the class in a
position to direct the course of instruction.
One of the candidates on the regular
ticket, in discussing the subject, said:
"The directors on the regnlar ticket, if
elected, will bring about some reforms in
the management of the Art Association.
Six of the eleven men on the ticket are in
favor of a readjustment of affairs. They
desire to infuse more life into the institu
tion."
When asked to indicate by pencil marks
on tbe ticket the men who would stand in
for a new order of things, the candidate
indicated James D. Phelan, L. P. Latimer,
Horace G. Platt, Henry J. Crocker, Henry
Heyman and William G. Stafford.
"I expeot," said the candidate, "that
the opposition of Edward Bosqui will be
encountered. He has been on the board
so long, and is so thoroughly identified
with the existing management, that he
will insist on adhering to plans adopted
by himself and Mr. Martin.
"It is one of his pet schemes to have the
board meetings take place in the afternoon,
as he lives in Marin County and cannot be
in San Francisco in the evening. To gratify
hiÂ« convenience business men must sur
render business hours to attend to asso
ciation affairs. The result hitherto has
been slight attendance at board meetings,
and Bosqui and Martin have had every
thing their own way. This will be changed
after the election."
"Do you fancy that the men indicated
will stand up to the rack?" was asked.
"I do, indeed,'' replied the candidate.
"I have talked with Horac9 Platt, and he
is in favor of readjustment."
The candidate, being asked his prefer
ence for president to succeed Mr. Phelan,
said: "I am in favor of Platt. Horace is
capable and energetic, besides he has
social ambitions. He would make a good
president."

THE QUEEN'S SECRET.
How Victoria Has Retained * Her Won-
derful Health and Strength.
"Have you ever heard of Queen Victoria*
secret?"' .-.- â -â¢; ." . â¢- ' ' â  i: â â¢ ; ' â¢
It was a well-known. New York physician
who recently asked the foregoing question in
the course of a conversation at his club. None
of the company had ever heard about 1 it, and
they pressed him for an explanation., He then
related the following remarkable story :
- "It is a well-known fact," he said "that the
Queen of Great Britain is one of the most won-
derful old ladies in existence. Although she
is nearly 80 years of age, she is to-day as bright
aud active as many a woman of 40. , And why
do you suppose it is? - I will tell you, for I ob-
tained the information from reliable sources.
It is because her Majesty never allows a day to
pa>s by without taking a little pure malt whis-
key. She takes this strengthening stimulant
by the advice of her physicians, among whom
are some of the greatest medical men in the
world. That is wny the Queen is so full of life
and energy in spite of her advanced years.
This is an interesting story, and it clearly
proves that scientific men are correct in telling
us that nothing compares with a, pure malt
stimulant for building ,up health. Unfortu-
nately such a stimulant is by no means common
or more people would reap the benefit of taking
such a preparation: In fact there is only one
pure medicinal whiskey in existence which ig
entirely free from injurious adulteration. - It is
known as Duffy's pure malt whiskey, and thou-
sands of men and women have testified to the
wonderful benefit receivedjfrom taking it.|,__
< Nothing has ever equaled It for stirring up the
blood, promoting digestion; and invigorating
the body. For, reason no inferior imita-
tions should be accepted from grocers or drug-
gists who attempt to â  substitute something
which they claim is,"just as good" as Duffy's.

SEVEN JURORS CHOSEN.
Judge Bahrs Would Not Allow

KNIGHTS PLEA FOR TIME.
He Wants Mrs. Tunnel!, Mrs. Bad
din and Miss Overman as
Witnesses.
Once more the Brown-Daviason scandal
is struggling upward toward public atten
tion. It is again in court, but this time
it is no ministers' council which is trying
Attorneys for the Prosecution, With the Brown Family as Auxiliary Counsel.
the case; it is no church law whiett will
be applied to objections and demurrers.
There is no judge advocate â each side
must run its own case â and there will be
no addresses to the court by the prose
cuting witness; he must speak through
his counsel or testify under cath.
There is no lack of counsel in the case
before Judge Bahrs, but it is not evenly
distributed. There are three lawyers
prosecuting the extortion charge against
Mrs. Davidson ; there is but one defending
her. Carroll Cook, Davis Louderback,
both special counsel, aftid "Walter Hinkle,
Assistant District Attorney, arranged
themselves in a row along the prosecutor's
table. |Behind Cook was Dr. Brown,
behind Louiierback was Mrs. Brown, be
hind Hinkle was Vally Brown, and to the
side was Detective Seymour. Knight and
Mrs. Davidson sat by themselves.
The defendant was as calm and placid as
she has been all through the trial. She
still wore the little bonnet with purple
violets and the white veil, which became
so familiar during the Police Court exam
ination, and she appeared much less dis
turbed over the situation than did the
contineent which formed the group for the
prosecution.
Dr. Brown took more than a passive
interest in the proceedings. He leaned
forward frequently and spoke to Cook, and
at every whispered council of the attorneys
he drew his chair forward and joined in.
Mrs. Brown, Valley and Detective Sey
mour were silent spectators all through
the day. They had, really, but little to
listen to, for the day dragged alone under
the examination of jurors. The proceed
ings opened, however, with a motion by
Mr. Knight for a continuance.
He said his most important witnesses â
Miss Overman, Mrs. Tunnell and Mrs.
Baddinâ were not present, and it would
seriously embarrass his case if he were
compelled to proceed without them. He
said he had asked the police to subpena
the witnesses named while they were still
in this State, but that now they are in En
senada, in Lower California. Knight said
he bad had affidavits prepared, but they
had not yet arrived in court, so, if allowed,
he would dictate a statement to the court
reporter, and he would swear to that as an
affidavit. This permission being granted.
Knight dictated as follows:
George A. Knight, being sworn, depose* and
says that on the 2d day of March, 1896, he
caused sabpenas to be taken out for the ap
pearance at this trial of Dr. C. O. Brown, Mrs.
W. J. Tunnell and Miss Mattie Overman. That
he, George A. Knight, went with the subpenas
to the Chief of Police and requested him to
have them served on the parties named. That
he notified the Chief of Police that the parties
would be present at the church council that
afternoon, aad that it was apprehended that
Miss Overmen would leave the jurisdiction of
this court. Those'Bubpenas were not and have
not yet been wrved upon Miss Overman and
Mrs. Tunnell. And the deponent says that he
cannot proceed to trial without the presence
of Miss Mattie Overman, who is a most mate
rial witness, anl that the same applies to Mrs.
W. J. Tunnell.
The other affidwit is sworn to by Mrs. Mary
A. Davidson, the defendant in this case. In
that the affiant asserts that she expects to prove
by Mrs. \V. J. Tunaell that there existed and
still exists a conspiracy for the purpose Jof
falsely accusing her, Mrs. Mary A.Davidson,
of the crime cf extortion. She expects to. prove
that Dr. Charles O. Brown paid to Mrs. W. J.
Tunnell money with>vhich to departout of the
jurisdiction of this cofert, and from attendance
at the church coun#l, as well as this triai.
That she, the affiant, ii unable to prove the ex
istence of this conspiracy without the aid of
Mrs. W. J. Tunnell an* Miss Mattie Overman. ,
Mrs. Davidson expels to Drove that Dr.
Charles O. Brown also c*used Miss Mattie Over
man to disappear.and to-go into place a of hid
ing for.no other purposes than to avoid attend- j
ance before this court, And the affiant states i
that she cannot proceed without these wit
nesses named. She has no personal knowledge
of the whereabouts of Miss Mattie Overman
but what she has gained from newspaper re
port When last heard of, according to news
paper report, Miss Overman had left Lower
California, and was in the neighborhood of
San Diego.
The affiant asserts that both these witnesses
named are in communication with and in fact
are under the command of Dr. .Charles O.
Brown.
On Friday lest, the 30th inst., knowledge
came to this affiant that subpenas which had
been got out for these witnesses Jhad not
been served; that, acting upon this knowledge,
this affiant, by her counsel, caused foreign
subpenas to be issued by the Judge of this
court, with directions to have them served
upon Mrs. W. J. Tunnell and Miss Mattie Over
man in their places of hiding. These subpenas
are now in the hands of the Sheriff.
Such being the case, Mrs. Mary A. Davidson
asks a continuance of this case. All that is
asked is a reasonable delay, in order that ser
vice of subpenas may be had upon the two
witnesses named.
The affidavits had but small weignt with
the court, however, for Judge Bahrs de
nied the motion for a continuance. The
witnesses were out of the jurisdiction of
the court, he said, and there was nothing
to show that they could be brought back
for the trial. Knight excepted, and then
twelve jurors were called into the box.
Hinkle made the opening statement to
the jury. It was short and to the point,
and contained only a passing explanation
of the charges against Mrs. Davidson. He
also read the information against her.
C. A. Devlin was the first juror under
examination. He easily passed Mr. Cook,
who asked the prosecution's questions,
but not so with Mr. Knight. Knight asked
him first if he knew any of the parties in
terested. Then he wanted to know if the
juror was a church member, where he
went to church, how often, and what he
thought of pastors generally. Then his
newspaper education, so far as it related
to the case, was included. Tbe juror said
he had read tbe newspaper reports of the
council trial, and he told Knight that he
disagreed with the verdict rendered. Be
sides the jaror did not think he would
make a fair and impartial judge of the
case, and Knight challenged. Mr. Devlin
was let go.
George Walcom's tnrn came next. Cook
had but little to inquire about, and Wal
com soon passed the prosecution. Then
Knight took him in hand and proceeded
to get his opinions on the conduct of min
isters and the relative degree of iniquity
attached to their errors. Hinsle objected.
He didn't see the use of roaming all over
the mental processes of the talesman just
to find out whether or not he was a fit
juror for the case. He said Dr. Brown
was not on trial, and his name should not
be dragged into the case. Knight submit
ted that he had a perfect right to ask the
juror what he thought of Dr. Br6wn, just
as he had a right to ask the jurors what
they thought of Mrs. Davidson, and to sup
port his position he did ask Mr. Walcom
what he thought of Mrs. Davidson. The
juror did not see anything in Mrs. David
son which Was repulsive to him, and so
after a few more words the juror was
passed.
C. O. Deming, who came next on the
list, passed both sides easily. He was
eminently satisfactory to Mr. Cook, and in
reply to knight's searching queries he had
none but satisfactory answers. His news
papers had not biased his judgment, the
crime of extortion had no particular abhor
ence to him, any more than that it was a
crime, and he thought ministers were no
more entitled to a peculiar brand of justice
than were the members of their conerega
tions. He was passed, but afterward a per
emptory challenge from Knight excused
him.
H. Maskow had an opinion and he was
let go without further parley.
"W. H. Wharff wore the Grand Array
button, so his examination took a mili
tary turn. Knight wanted to know what
he thought of his comrades and if he
would not be lenient with them when be
could. "He would help them, wouldn't
he? When, as in this case, the verdict
might mean a ereat deal, he would give a
Grand Army man a little consideration,
wouldn't heâ a little better show?"
These questions did not strike the prose
cution as being proper. Dr. Brown wears
the button, too, and once more Mr.
Hlnokle's voice was raised in protest.
Again he said Dr. Brown was not on trial
there in the court, and counsel had no
right to raise such questions. But Knight
exhausted another peremptory on Mr.
Wharff, so he left the panel, anyway.
J. Newbauer knew nothing about the
case nor any one connected with it. He
thought be would make a good juror, but
the defense thought not, find a third de
fendant's peremptory removed him.
W. Felitz had read the testimony and
had formed an opinion ; so had D. C.
Bates, aud both were excused for cause.
David Gorman passed Mr. Cook on his
newspaper record. He had read the testi
mony, but had formed no opinion. He is
a comparatively recent arrival, and has
not yet fathomed Western ideas. He was
satisfactory to the court, so Knight used
another peremptory challenge to secure [
his release.
H. A. Marvin admitted that while on a
question of sentence he would be more
lenient with a woman, still on a question
of guilt or innocence he would treat both
alike. Mr. Marvin bad read the papers,
but his reading had brought him no I
THIS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 1896.
opinion. He confessed to being a man of
religious principles, and he did not like to
see such a scandal as the Brown-Davidson
case in the church. He would give the
evidence his unbiased attention. He was
accepted.
L. W. Johnston was of a similar mind,
and so was John Nolan. Both were passed
and accepted, and then the box was filled
again. Counsel had secured four jurors
out of the twelve talesmen examined.
H. Kosminsky. W. Weston, W. B.
Hicks, H. Hoffman, John Brophy, J. C.
Gardener and Claus Atten were the next
men sworn to answer questions. Mr. Kos
minsky's examination proved interesting.
He was asked what he thought of a minis
ter charged with the offense upon which
Brown had been tried. The prosecution
objected again. Dr. Brown was not on
trial, said Mr. Hinkle once juore, and the
court seemed to agree with him. It was
not a material issue, said Judge Bahrs,
whether or not Dr. Brown had been guilty
of improper conduct.
"But you say in your information," pro
tested Knight, "that the charge against
him is doubly hard on him because of his
ministerial standing. I want to know how
these jurors look at it.
"We are not trying Dr. Brown now â or
at least just now, but I can ask those
questions if for nothing more than to base
a peremptory challenge."
Knight's line of inquiry was stopped
there, however/and he took up another
instead. He asked what the juror would
think of the absence of Mrs. Baddin, Mrs.
Tunnell and Miss Overman from the trial.
"They were material witnesses for the
defense, and would the juror hold it
against the defendant if they were not put
on the stand? Would he believe the
| defense when it was announced that they
I were not to be found?" All this was sub.
mitted with great earnestness, and at the
end of it all Mr. Kosminsky was excused
on a peremptory challenge by the defense.
W. Weston had opinions, and so was
unavailable. H. L. Judell was let co on a
defendant's challenge. W. B. Hicks would
hold that Mrs. Davidson was guilty until
she proved her innocence, and even the
prosecution thought him superfluous.
Henry Hoffman satisfied both sides and
was accepted, and Clans Ottin'a senti
ments regarding scandals and ministers
were too much for the prosecution. They
used the first people's challenge on Mr.
Otten.
To fill the vacant chairs some more
talesmen were called forward. J. W.
Steinart was accepted; so was J. H. Bilser.
S. M- Smith had an opinion â just a little
one â not sufficient to disturb his judg
ment. His opinion was too strong for the
court, however, and he was excused.
D. A. Williams had not read the papers,
and did not know whether the last event
at the First Congregational Church was a
funeral or a thanksgiving feast. There
were flowers there he knew by the pic
tures, but he knew nothing further. He
did not even remember Dr. Brown's text
of the day before. He did not know Mrs.
Tunnell, Mrs. Baddin nor Miss Overman.
He did not know where they were. He
did not know even whether they were in
California or Mexico. This bit of ignor
ance pleased Dr. Brown immensely, and
he pulled Cook back until he could whisper
in the attorney's ear. Then he sat back
and smiied.
Knight wanted to know further if the
juror had ever been mixed up in a church
scandal. Yes, the juror was at one time a
member of an investigating council.
'â¢Was the verdict upheld by th-j congre
gation?" queried Knight. The juror didn't
know. And the juror would give no more
credence to the sworn testimony of a min
ister than he would to that of a lay
man ? The juror thought not, and Knight
passed him. The "people" challenged
again, however, and Mr. Williams was
lost to the case.
C. W. Stoffers was in a very satisfactory
state of mind, but he did not ring true to
the defense, and though Stoffers was a
church member, he was allowed to go on
Knight's challenge. J. D. Rohrs was
passed, but let go on a people's challenge,
and J. B. Batton was biased.
For the third time Charley Fancher, the
court clerk, opened his tin jury-wheel and
he drew out the names of E. E. Ames, T.
P. Duley, W. M. Dye, J. Witt and Francis
Thomas. Then, it being 4 o'clock", court
adjourned.
During the day there were twenty-seven
talesmen examined and seven jurors se
cured. The defense has used seven of its
ten peremptory challenges and the prose
cution has used three of tne five allowed it.
All through the day counsel for the
prosecution gave evidence of an intention
to tight to the last every effort to get Dr.
Brown into the case except as prosecuting
witness, and Knight gave evidence of the
fact that he understands the situation.

BATTLE FOR FAIR RATES
A Serious Controversy Pending
Over the Eureka Traffic
Situation.
NO DISPOSITION TO YIELD.
Both Sides Are Fully Determined to
Maintain Their Respective
Positions.
There is now every indication that a
well-defined issue is to be raised by the
principal merchants of San Francisco in
the effort to have rates to Eureka from
this City and Portland respectively fixed
on a mileage basis.
More than usual interest and import
ance attaches to this situation as it is one
of the few instances where the most influ
ential commercial interests of the City
have arrayed themselves in a solid
phalanx against what they considered a
discrimination on the part of a transporta
tion company. The prime actuating idea
on the part of the commercial bodies in
volved in this controversy is that there is
an effort being made to favor Portland at
the expense of and to the injury of San
Francisco.
Attention was first called to this alleged
discrimination through the Traffic Asso
ciation, which charged that the steamer
South Coas t, operated by the Oregon Kail
way and Navigation Company, of which
Goodall, Perkins & Co. are the local
agents, was carrying freight from Portland
to Eureka at lower rates than was being
charged by the Pomona, operated by
Goodall, Perkins & Co., from this City to
Eureka.
As a result of the action of the Traffic
Asseciation there was a special meeting
called by the Board of Trade of San Fran
cisco, to which representatives from the
Chamber of Coraraerce.Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, Traffic Associa
tion, Merchants' Association and San
Francisco Fruit Exchange were invited
and at which the Board of Trade was also
represented.
At this meeting a sub-committee was
appointed, consisting of Traffic Manager
W. B. Curtis, A. L. Scott, W. R. Wheeler
and T. J. Parsons, and instructed to place
the matter before Goodall, Perkins & Co.
in the manner they thought best. This
committee met, and, after due deliberation
and consideration of the matter, Mr. Cur
tis was authorized to communicate with
Goodall, Perkins & Co., reviewing the
grievance of these six bodies and suggest
ing as a remedy that rates be readjusted
on a mileage basis.
To this the company representing the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company
sent a reply on Friday last virtually de
clining to make the concessions asked.
Their reasons for this stand are partially
summarized la the following paragraph,
quoted from the letter sent to Mr. Curtis:
"We should judge there is an average of
fifteen to twenty vessels per month sailing
from San Francisco toEureta, while there
are about two per month from Eureka to
Portland, and these are small, slow and
irreeular. At even rates, with these ad
vantages, are we to infer that Saa Fran
cisco ca nnot hold her own ?"
In this letter it was also stated that the
freight rate from Portland to Eureka on
the South Coast was $1 and that the same
rate had been made by the Pomona from
San Francisco to Eureka when the matter
was first called to the attention of Goodall,
Perkins & Co.
There was a meeting yesterday of the
speciaL committee of four appointed by
the joint commercial bodies which lasted
nearly three hours and at which the reply
of Goodall, Perkins & Co. was discussed,
with the result that the whole matter is
to be again referred to the joint body of
the six commercial organizations named,
which will hold a special meeting this
afternoon at the Board of Trade rooms.
The committee considers that it has no
further power to act in the matter, but
that its duties ended with sending the
communication to the steamship agents
and receiving the latter's reply.
It is understood that the report of the
committee will recommend that the posi
tion originally taken at the joint meeting
declaring for a readjustment based on a
mileage basis be maintained, and there is
every liklihood that this recommendation
will be adopted. If this is done the issue
will be fairly made, and a bitter contest,
will in all probability be precipitated.
One of the committee of four, speaking of
the situation, said it was brought about by
the action of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company in placing the
steamer Sooth Coast on the route between
this City and Portland and way ports in
the effort to drive the Alice Blanchard and
Empire of the Northern Pacific Steamship
Company's line from that field, but more
particularly to prevent competition in the
Portland-San Francisco traffic.
YOSEMITE TOURISTS.
The Season Opened Under Circum
stances That Promise Well.
Fourteen tourists took advantage of the
opening yesterday of the road to the Yo
semite Valley for the season. This is an
unusually large number for the first ex
cursion of the year, and is considered to
augur well for the future of this business.
In order to accommodate this class of
travel a special train was put on yester
day, which will be run through the sum
mer. It will leave at 4:30 p. m., connect
at Raymond wiÂ£h the stage to Yosemite,
and be run to Fresno.
Sam Miller, the local agent for tourist
travel to the Yosemite, reports the road
from Raymond to the valley to be in ex
cellent condition.

NEW YORK MARKETS. .'
' Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March . â The bears
were more aggressive to-day than fora long time
past. The failure of the Rock Island to increase
Its dividend, a little selling for foreign account and
the debate in the Senate on the Cuban question all
had a tendency to assist the bears in their work of
depressing prices. 'Burlington and Quincy was
also affected by statements that the February re
port will make a 'poor showing. Chicago houses
were liberal sellers of this stock. St. Paul broke
badly. L. and N. was sold freely, and ran off
nearly 2 points to 4b ;i 4,. Tobacco and Sugar were j
the features of the Industrial -â¢ croup. The first
named advanced 34 per cent to 8414 and later re
ceded to 82%Â®83'A(.
The old stories about a settlement of the war
were again circulated and again denied. Sugar
ruled strong in early dealings and moved up to
117V4-" The rise, however, brought out offerings
of lon- stock; and the price declined to 1153,4 to
116Vif Chicago Gas and General â¢ Electric, while
inclined to weakness, were by no means active.
The belief that the Pacific Mail Company will be
awarded the usual subsidy by the transcontinental
lines stiffened the stock for a time, but Inter it, fell
from 27-vi to 26 4- Near â  the close the selling by
the bears abated, and I under covering of short con
tracts prices rallied 1.4^3,1: Louisville ami Nash-

CHICAGO MARKETS. .
CHICAGO, iii., March 23.â An advance of
%@ 3 A of a cent over Saturday's close was estab
lished in wheat at the opening to-day. Liverpool
and Berlin , cables were higher,, which evidently
helped to strengthen the feeling here, but It ap
peared as though the main -factor in the" improve
ment was apprehension lest some of the statistical
figures incident to Monday would prove a surprise
in the 'interest of the. bulls. An easier tone de
veloped during the morning, and some decline was
noted.' but not all the gain was lost. - Receipts at
Chicago were 28 cars, and 80,233 bushels were
taken from store. Northwestern arrivals were
largo at 581 cars against 645 last Monday, and 456
a year ago. The visible supply decreased 785,000
bushels. The amount on ocean passage decreased
480,000 bushels, and the English visible supply
increased 226,000 bushels. The total world's ship
ments for last week were 6,448,000 bushels. About
noon when most of the information regarding
stocks and supplies had become generally known,
and nothing very startling 'in the way of bull news
coming to hand prices began ; to show considerable
weakness and declines followed. Closing Conti
nental cables were irregular. Paris quoted a de
cline on spot wheat with other prices unchanged;
Berlin was higher and Antwerp unchanged. At
lantic seaboard clearances were light at 229,019
bushels. May wheat opened from 63Vic to 63y B e,
Bold between 63S /8 c and 62c. closing at the latter,
Vila's o under Saturday. Estimated receipt* for
to-morrow 50 cars.
CORNâ steady but later, in sympathy
with the modified feeling in wheat, declined frac
tionally. Business was moderately active at inter
vals, but the total trade was not large. Receipts
were 489 cars and 151.433 bushels : were taken
from store. Liverpool cables were quiet and steady.
The visible supply increased 966,000 bushels. The
amount on ocean passage decreased 720,000 bush
els. Export clearances were large at 602.905 busu
els. May corn opened at 29% c, sold between 29%
@29Â»ic and 293/ c, closing at the latter. 14c under
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 670
cars. '
OATSâ Reflected the tone of wheat and corn, an
ordinary business being transacted. Receipts were !
3*2 cars and 22,690 bushels were withdrawn from '
store. The visible supply increased 754,000 bush
els. Offerings were rather heavy later in the ses
sion and prices exhibited â¢ decided weakness. May
oats closed Â»4c under Saturday, Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow 400 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 90c; May, 90^c;
July. 93c Receipts 40 cars.
PROVISIONSâ a stronger hog market furnished
product with a bull argument at the opening, caus
ing prices to open firm and higher. The rally
seemed to suit sellers, offering becoming free and
in the course of half an hour a material decline
took place. The weakness prevailed â¢ until the
close, when May pork was 15c lower, May lard 5c
lower and May ribs 12Â«^@15c lower.

WELL VERSED IN CRIME
The Quartet of Baby Burglars j
Seem Happy in Their
Cell.
HINTS OF MANY MISDOINGS.
Chief Lloyd Speaks of Searching
Baby Buggies and Shadowing
School Children.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 23. \
Another boy burglar has been added to
the trio in the City Prison. He is James
de Rocca. a brother of Frank, who was ar
rested Saturday. The little gang is now sup
posed to be all in jail and when they were
lined up to-day by Officer Rand to be pho
tographed it cannot be said that they did
not look all that they profess to be.
Jamesk c Rocea is only 12 years of age
and is very small for one of his years. His
brother Fran* is only 10, while the child of
the noble name of Pacheco is 11, and Bob
Ash, the king of the gang, is nearly 14.
Tbey are all kept in one cell, and althoueh
made to clean it out twice a day they show
a desire for filth and discomfort that is re
pulsive in the extreme.
It is thought likely that the quartet
has been living a life of crime for some j

months. Ash is a well-known little petty i
larcenist and from hints the boys have
been dropping, it is inferred that they
long since joined the lignt-nngered fra
ternity.
The cause of the elder De Eocca's arrest
was s suspicion that he broke into the sta
tion at First and Broadway and stole a
bunch of ferry tickets. The lad acknowl
edged knowing all about it. They have
also told the Chief of a bicycle they stole
from the Rambler shop last Friday. Ches
ter was the leader on that raid. He walked
into the *tore and rolled out the first
wbeel he saw while the employes looked
on, evidently thinking he had aright to it.
They hid the machine in a barn and the
police found it there.
For a long time there have been little
gangs of water-front pirates stealing from
ships and off the wharves, and at times
pome of these now under arrest have played
the role of amatenr pirates and taken away
boats and plunder which they have after
ward disposed of. They have not been
guilty of any great crimes, but they have
indulged in peccadillos, and without
doubt there is a "fence" which they pat
ronized and which is not known to the
police.
"It would seem as if it were useless to
suspect grown-up people of crime any
more," said Chief Lloyd to-day.
"The officers will soon consider it neces
sary to search baby buggies and shadow
school children. These little fellows are
just as smart as old thieves and are just as
able to cover up their tracks. The exam
ple set by Majors and "Wilmore has, I fear,
been far-reaching, but their followers seem
to forget that these lads are now spending
ten years in jail. It is very difficult to de
cide just what to do with these lads.
They are babies, both in size and crime,
compared to the original two boy burglars,
but I suppose there is nothing for them
but the. reform school."
The lads were in the Police Court this
morning, but as no compiainta had been
filed their cases were continued, until to
morrow. ______________
DISOBEYING THE COURT
Work on the Addition to the
Alameda Electric Plant
Goes On.
A Barroom Brawlâ Dangerous Trip
in a Catamaranâ News
Notes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 23.âNotwith
standing the temporary injunction issued
on Saturday last by Judge Frick restrain
ing the City Trustees and "their agents
and servants and all persons acting under
their authority from permitting or causing
to be permitted any further work upon
the addition to the building now in
process of construction upon the land
occupied by the municipal electric plant,"
the noise of hammer and saw was stiJl to
be heard this morning at the workÂ«. City
Attorney Tavlor advised the contractors
and their employes that they mieht con
tinue their labors in spite of the court's or
der, which they did. An affidavit which
Engineer Messer of the electric works
would have presented in court to-day, had
the hearing been held, explains why the
City Attorney takes this liberty.
It shows that au excavation six feet deep
lias been made for the foundation of the
new boiler and engine which is 6oon to be
placed at the worKs; that it is in sandy
soil, likely to cave at any time; and being
only four feet from the old machinery,
there is danger of the old boiler and engine
sinking, in which case the fittings would
become disconnected, an explosion would
result and tlie engineer and fireman would
be killed. The roof ofÂ»the old building,
too, is off the engine, and should it be ex
| posed might ruin the machinery. These
; facts are given as sufficient reason for the
| continuance of work.
_ Judge FricK was not on hand this morn-
I mg when the attorneys for plaintiff and
defendant appeared. An effort was made
to have Judge Ellsworth hear the matter,
but ne could not, having entered into a
conversation concerning it. It may be
taken for hearing to-morrow, although
nothing definite has been fettled upon.
A Dangerous Trip.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 23. â Two
weeks ago George, Louts and Charles
Tullis left on a catamaran which they had
recently built and thoroughly equipped
for a trip up the Sacramento "River. All
went well with them until on the return
trin last Saturday, when they had an ex
perience which nearly cost them their
lives and which did cost them the loss of
their craft. Coming down through the
straits of Carquinez the frail catamaran
encountered some heavy seas and was
straining every timber trying to weather
me gale. Everything even then might
have gone well had not the boat struck a
floating log. She ran tilt into one just at
the time when the crisis had passed, the
result being a complete shattering of
every stick in her. The navigators man
aged to get into a tender which they had
been towing ana rowed ashore, landing on
the northeastern extremity of Angel
Island. There they stayed "all night, for
some reason making no attempt to get
over to the other si'le of the island, where
they could have been cared for. They
shivered until morning in their wet
clothes and suffered greatly from hunger.
Still they stayed, hoping tliat tLey might
attract the notice of some passing craft
and get succor. Tney waited all day, but
not until late in the afternoon did they see
a sail. Then it happened that Captain E.
A. yon Schmidt came along in his yacht
Whirlwind, and he, seeing their frantic
I motions and bearing their loud yells for
help, came to their rescue and brought
them to Alameda, much the worse for the
hard knocks they had received.
A Barroom Brawl.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 23.â A bar
room brawl yesterday resulted in the com
plete using up of one of the participants.
Sherman Fish, an ex-police officer, and
Robert Cavanaugh got into an altercation
in the "Old Corner Saloon" and soon were
at it hammer and tongs. Cavanaugh
thrust Fish through a pane of glass and
he was badly cut about the face. Myron
Fish, the injured man's son, attempted to
assist his father, but was 'kept at bay by
Thomas Cavanaugh, a brother of the as
sailant. Dr. Zeyn dressed Fish's wounds,
which required eight stitches.
General Notfs.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 23.â The City
Trustees passed this evening a claim for
$7949 in favor of Thomas H. Day & Bon
of San Francisco, being the final payment
on account of construction work on the
City Hall.
Mrs. E. D. Ells, of the Central restaur
ant, was awarded the contract to fwrnish
meals for the inmates of the City Prison.
She agrees to do so at the rate of 18 cents
per meal.
An ordinance making it a misdemeanor
to deface public buildings was passed.
F. N. Debanoy made application for a
franchise to establish an electric light
works. It was filed.

The matter of the final settlement of the bill
j of exceptions in the water-front case was con
j tinued to-day until Wednesday.
The divorce case of William B. Church
i against Georgiana Church has been referred to
the Court Commissioner to take testimony.
S. H. E. Partington. the artist, will speak
on Friday evening next before the Starr King
Fraternity upon "Painting, Pictures and Paint
ers."
Governor Budd will be present at the Fabiola
May fete. He has already signified his inten
tion of accepting the invitation tendered him
by the executive committee.
The Consolidated Piedmont Cable Company
has taken an appeal from the order of court
directing Ira Bishop, as receiver, to pay John
Yule $406 28 on account of a judgment.
Janet Cameron has been granted a divorce
from Truman Cameron on the ground of
adultery &nd cruelty. The plaintiff is awarded
the community property on Magnolia and
Fifth streets.
There is considerable feeling between Acme
Club members and the directorate of the Y. M.
C. A., owing to the latter's refusal to allow the
use of the Tabernacle for a boxing exhibition.
Pressure has been brought to bear upon the di
rectors, ana even some members of their own
association hare urged that the request be
granted.
The case of James Stuart Adams vs. Anita
Day was to have been argued on demurrer to
the engrossed com pi aim before Judge Frick
this morning, but went over until to-morrow
at 10 o'clock. Judge Frick was not on the
bencu, having gone out of town. In bis ab
sence Judge Ellsworth disposed of the busi
ness on the docket.
The attorneys for J. T. Fleming, who is try
ing to defeat the proposed improvement of the
municipal electric-light plant in Alameda,
have amended their complaint and set up that
the proposed enlargement is for the purpose of
supplying incandescent light to private con
sumers and that the Trustees have not tne
power under the charter to do so.
In Judge Ogdeu's court this afternoon the
motion for a new trial in the case of Public Ad
ministrator Knight vs. Tripp was dismissed
without prejudice and will later be submitted
on briefs. In this case the Public Administra
tor sued Tripp as trustee and secured the per
sonal effects of Mrs. Eliza Cook, which Tripp
had previously refused to surrender.
Chief Lloyd will endeavor to have the Gov
ernor grant pardon to Mrs. Crowley, who,
though now in the hospital, is a prisoner doing
100 days for getting drunk and creating a dis
turbance in the Police Court during its session.
The woman is suffering from a cancer, and the
poor accommodations at the City Prison make
it impossible to give her the necessary care
there.

â  a Duel. â¢ "-â¢* ' '3 â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway, March 23. "â ;(>â 
The Board of Supervisors : spent some
time to-day discussing the best ' mode <of
proceed are in the matter ; of the ; draw
bridges over the Oakland Harbor at Alice
and Webster streets. _ This was ? necessary
owing to the , notice served I upon County
Clerk Jordan by Colonel Charles R. Suter
of the United States army engineer corps.
: The notice set forth that it was proposed
to require the reconstruction of the draw
spans, so as to give a clear ' draw opening
of not less than 150 feet, the substitution of
other than hand power for operating the
draws, and propositions : looking to the
substitution of a single structure in place
of \ the present < two â¢ bridges, ; and \ that ' a
hearing .* would be ' held - before 'I Colonel
Charles R. Suter in his office in San Fran
cisco on Wednesday next at 11 A. m. ? .. v
District Attorney Charles E. Snook ad
dressed the board, adhering to his opinion
given that body on October 9, 1895, to the
effect that the Supervisors' had no author
ity over the bridge further than to see that
it was kept in repair. â¢ "The Alice-street
bridge," he said, 1 -. "was -built by a railroad
company, and the board had nothing
whatever to da with it. The Webster
street bridge was built by a joint commis
sion, but, later, by an " act of : the Legisla
ture, it was transferred to the Supervisors
for maintenance. '. .. -
; "I don't see how the board has any
power to construct the bridpe, as proposed",
for a ' county has - no right to come into
municipalities and do such work without
an act of the Legislature. It might have
the power to go ahead and widen the span
desired if it can be proven that it is not
wide enough as it is. . ; â ? ; "
"The War Department has no authority
in the matter until there is *n act of Con
gress accepting the harbor. â¢.â¢ It ' is . a % fact
the Government is doing work in the es
tuary and has made Oakland :i a port â¢ of
entry, but the State Legislature is supreme
in the control of â . the bridge over it
until Congress takes some action remov
ing that power." â¢ ' . -
The attorney dismissed ", the board to
present its case to Colonel Suter by pre
paring three facts for his consideration: ..""
Firstâ Powers of the board in the premises as
provided by the laws now in force. â 
Secondâ Whether the span l is , such now as
to be an inconvenience to commerce.
Thirdâ Regarding the time . occupied ; in op
erating the bridge. . \
"Well, we certainly have a pig in a hole,
here," remarked Snook. ."Why, in 1877 the
county t refused to accept this Webster
street bridge, but it -was forced to. The
county not only had to accept the bridge,
but was obliged to keep it in repair accord
ing to law. I would suggest,' if Congress
wants to take charge of the.situation, to
give >t the bridges. I feel sure the county
would surrender all rights to the the Gov
ernment if it was desired. These engineers
overestimate the ; board's power.' They
seem to think we can build a new bridge at
their dictation, but Iwe can't doTany thing"
of the kind, according to my judgment."
The matter was referred to a committee,
consisting of * Superviser W. H. Church,
County Clerk Frank C. Jordan, County
Surveyor George L. Nusbaumer and Dis
; trict Attorney Charles E. Snook, to pre
; pare the case to be presented at the hear
ing. â .: . .'. â¢ ; Â.-â  â ..'â â  v. â  Â i .

CHALLENGES ' FBBELT PASS.
Ex- Assemblyman; Bretz and' George W.
- Asper Have Trouble Over Note*.
OAKLAND, Cal m March! ' 23.âEx-As
semblyman A. A. Bretz and George W.
Arper a former aspirant for the Mayoralty,
of this city, had a clash this afternoon and
now both are breathing vengeance against
the other. - The two so far = have only in
dulged in a word * war, but more serious
trouble may break out at any moment
and undoubtedly will if the two come face
to face while in the present mood. .
Arper and Bretz were formerly good
friends, but when the latter entered ; the
journalistic field he asked Arper to cash
some notes made 'by local Populists, so as
to secure money to ; start their sheet. - The
note fell due November, 1893, but to date
all attempts to collect it have failed. Nat
urally Arper has lost faith in Populists in
general, as well as a large number in par
ticular, so when Bretz - appeared â¢on the
scene to-day '.and expressed a desire :to
have another Populist note "shaved" he
was met with the statement that' neither
he nor any of : his friends were ; any good.
>:l: Bretz took exceptions to the remark and "
for a few moments Arper's office was blue
with ! oaths . and uncomplimentary re
marks about the two men which finally
resulted in Arper saying:
; ' 'You're a cur, and I want you to' get
out of my office." ./f*-"?. >= : â¢â¢/â¢
"You're another, and Fir get out when
Iâ â please," was the rejoinder. ; .
; "You'll get out now, and - â = quick at
that.".;^>v; v. ' " ;;v; '"^
With this Mr. Arper forcibly ejected
from his store the i Populist editor. / This
so enraged Bretz that lie f dared 'Arper i 'to
come out and meet him with bare fist? or
any other weapon he might name. When
he attempted to re-enter Arper banged the
door in the angry Populist s face. Bretz
then departed breathing vengeance. iv -y I

': In speaking of the matter his attorney
to-day said: "I shall appeal hiÂ« case if he
will let me. If he objects If can do noth-
against his wishes. . He says :it will
take a year of more before ;; he will i know
whether he is to have a new trial or not, if
an appeal is taken, and meanwhile he
must \ remain :in ? jail. Then if he should
get a new trial, and there should be a sen
tence of ten years or life imprisonment in
Folsotn or San Quentin, he would much
rather die ?on the scaffold. He j does not
fear death and appears determined to let
nothing farther be done in his case."

AN INSULT OR ACCIDENT.
A Significant Page That Appears

Magazine.
BALLINGTON BOOTH'S WORDS.
In the Light of Recent Events Their
Import May Be Satirical or
Serious.
Oakland Office San Franxisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 23. j"
The local Salvationists are somewhat
divided regarding the spirit that animated
the editor of the current number of the
Conqueroi, an army publication, when he
arranged for page 111. In the light of re
cent events the floral illustration looks
like a polite way of telling the late com
mander that he should practice what he
preaches.
The opinion that the page was intended
as an affront to Balliugton Booth is said
by some to be strengthened by the ed-
Itorial page, where frequent mention is
made of the necessity of obedience in the
Salvation Army and of the struggle that
is sometimes required to say "farewell."
The following paragraph is taken as indi
cating a hostile feeling to Ballington
Booth.
The principle of self-denial, without which
nothing great, or noble, or of permanent value
ever bas been, can be or will be accomplished
ior either God or man.
In this instance â and all like it â a great
number of people are called upon to practice
this difficult virtueâ the commander and Mrs.
IJooth, the officers and soldiers of the army on
the American field, the auxiliaries and other
friends and sympathizers outside our ranks
and the territory as a whole.
In other places the spirit of the editorial
matter is taken as indication that the copy
was all prepared before Ballington Booth
announced his intention of disobeying the
general's orders, ana that there was no
sarcastic intent in the publication of page
111. Those who believe in this may sus
tain their position by the following ex
pression :
It Is no easy or trifling matter for officers
who have held long and successful commands
j to bid adieu to comrades in arms to whom
I they are bound by ties of mutusl love, grati
tude and appreciation. The â¢fficers and sol
diers of the American wing naturally do not
j feel any exuberant joy in parting from leaders j
i who have indeed led and whose lives have cor- I
responded with their words. The territory, as
] a whole, naturally feels reluctant to lose the
benefit of the experience, toils and talents of
those whose administration has been conspicu
ously successfulâ even for the benefit of some
Other country.
The wording of the extract that bears the
signature of BallingtonÃooth is so stranegly
I at variance with his conduct of the past
! few weeks as to make it unfortunate that it
! appeared at this time, if its publication
were devoid of malice.
"One thing is certain," said Ensign
Reid, "and that is that nothing has been
done at our National headquarters that
could in the least degree offend the feel
ings of our late commander. It is our de
sire, and to a great extent onr hope, that
Ballington Booth will soon see that he has
made a mistake and will acknowledge
that he has done wrong. lam sure that
I no otlicer or editor would ever dream of
j hurting his teelings or of creating any
obstacle against his retnrn."
The Oakland corps does not appear to
have taken any notice of the Eastern
trouble. There "has not been any talk of
secession, but, on the contrary, every iv-
I dividual member of the corps has pledged
their fidelity to the general and the Pa
cific Coast officers.
MOTHER OF NINETEEN.
When She Got Home Not One Was to
Be Seen.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 23.â 1f Mrs.
K?.te Kennedy of Temescal had one more
child she would be the mother of an even
score. She has lived in Temescai many
years and is now well along in life. But
she has not yet learned to look away from
'the cup when it is red. Several times she
has been arrested for drunkenness and
fifteen days ago she was sent to jail for
disturbing the peace.
Last Saturday Mrs. Kennedy's term ex
pired, and she was released. She went out
to Temescal and expected to be received
into the bosom of her family of nineteen.
To her great surprise she fonnd that the
family had moved away, and had not fur
nished her with the address. She hunted
for her family for several hours, but large
as it is, it disappeared as completely as if
it consisted of only one.
Karly on Sunday morning she was
found on the street by Deputy Sheriff
Kruner, who is helping her to find her
family.

WORKMEN ATTACH
FOR THEIR WAGES.
The South San Francisco
Pottery Closes Its
Doors.
i
________
MANY MEN OUT OF WORK
i
A Very Costly Establishment
That Was Run at a
Heavy Loss.
STEIGER BROS- IN TROUBLE.
Mortgages and Defective Work Cause
the Collapse of a Big Enter
prise.
After a more or less successful career for
about a year the South San Francisco Pot
tery, owned by Steiger Bros., the San Jose
capitalists, has apparently gone to the
wall, and anxious creditors are wondering
where the coin to satisfy their claims is
coming from.-
Early in 1895 a great fire destroyed the
Steigor Bros.' pottery in San Jose, and
after the losses had been adjusted by the
employes of the insurance companies who
carried risks on the place the firm de
cided not to rebuild on their own location,
but to remove to South San Francisco,
where close proximity to tbe fat contracts
awarded by the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors would insure them better
profits.
A magnificent building, supposed to con
tain all of the latest improvement? in pot-
I tery machinery, was erected near the
Baden slaughter-houses, and a large force
j of men was installed to carry out the work
of several large contracts that the firm
had on hand.
Over $100,000 was invested in the im
provements and the establishment was
i looked upon as the finest of its kind in
this section of the State. At first the
pottery sewer-pipes, tilings, etc., turned
out by the factory were accepted by con
tractors without question, but within a
short time it is said, poor materials began
â  to be noticed and a number of important
contracts were let to Los Angeles firms in
preference to the South San Francisco con
cern.
In order to erect its establishment in
South San Francisco the firm was com
pelled to negotiate several heavy mort
gages, and as business fell off the interest
on the loans cramped Steiger Bros, for
ready coin and they were compelled to go
into debt to their workmen.
The tronhles of the firm culminated on
Saturday, the 21st inst., when the demands
of the employes of the pottery became so
importunate that they could not be put off
any longer. On that day the doors of the
establishment closed, and from sixty to
seventy-five men who had been with the
firm from the day it opened were thrown
out of work.
Steijter Bros, promised to settle with- j
in a day or two and tbe workmen waited j
patiently, but no coin was forthcoming j
and they finally concluded to attach the
pottery to protect themselves. For several
days past Deputy Sheriff Fred De3irello
has been carrying a number of attach
ments in his pockets amounting to $1800
or more hoping to meet some member of
the firm o_ which to serve them, but thus
for he has been unsuccessful in finding his
men.
It is understood that in addition to those
who have aiready taken out attachments
a number of others have decided on the
same course and that various claims rang
ing from $200 to $500 will be filed against
the concern within a short time.
The storekeepers of South San Francisco
are anxious about the matter, for the em
ployes of the pottery have many of them
been living on credit for weeks past and
their accounts if lost to the tradesmen
' -will seriousJy cripple the latter.'

The matter of holding the meeting of

WHEELMEN'S RELAY.
The Annual One Hundred-Mile Event
Will Be Bun Sunday.
April 12.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
held a special meeting last evenine at the
Olympic Club to discuss matters pertain
ing to the annual relay race to be held
next month. Delegates were present from
fifteen of the twenty-three clubs belonging
to the association.
It was unanimously decided to postpone
the race one week, to April 12, as the usual
day, the first Sunday in April, is Easter
Sunday this year.
The sixth " relay, which formerly ran
through the streets of San Jose, has been
changed to skirt the town as follows:
Commencing at the end of the fifth relay,
at the outskirts of San Jose, thence via
Rare street and Lincoln avenue as far as
Willow, across Willow to First, down one
block to Reyes, along Keyes to the East
San Jose road-race course* to King road,
following this road to Alum Rock avenue,
to the county road.
Another change is made at Irvington,
where, instead of branching off via Niles,
as was done last year, ihe riders will fol
low the main road toward Centerville, Al
varado, Mount Eden and San Leandro.
At High street, Fruitvale, the route
leads into Alameda instead of to East
Oakland, as it did last year. The finish
will be in Alameda, on Central avenue,
west of Park street.
George H. Stratton, H. B. Wynne, C. N.
Ravlin. A. P. Swain and J. J. B. Arcenti
of the association will ride over the course
next Thursday and measure it accurately.
The changes will be carefully noted and a
map will be made showing the new route.
The rules of the race will be printed and
sent to all the clubs.
A. P. Swain, captain of tbe Acme Club
Wheelmen, has been appointed to the
vacancy on the road racing and records
committee of the association, to fill the
vacancy caused by the removal of John S.
Egan. The announcement made in an
evening paper last week that John Kitchen
Jr. of Oakland had received tbe appoint
ment was an error. Mr. Kitchen has been
made an official referee for the League of
American Wheelmen, together with San
ford Plummer, captain of the Bay City
Wheelmen.
The next meeting of the association will
be held Saturday evening, April 4. at the
rooms of the Olympic Club "W heelmen.
Allan Jones rode to San Jose Sunday in
3 hours 15 minutes, paced by a quadrup
let. In spite of the recent rains the roads
are in splendid condition.
MAYOR SUTRO TROUBLED
The Presidio Band at the Baths
May Cause a Boycott by
Workmen.
The Trades Council Will Be Appealed
To if the Soldiers Are Not
Withdrawn.
Pericles won the gratitude of Greek citi
zens by adding popular games to the feasts
of Athens; Julius Caesar courted the favor
of Romans by great circuses at the colli
seum; Adolph Sutro has added to his
fame by the magnificent baths and amuse
ments at the Cliff House. This is history.
But Pericles fell; Caesar met Brutus;
Sntro engaged the Presidio band. This is
trouble.
The troubles of Julius and Pericles are
over, but those of Adolph have only be
gun. The Musicians' Mutual Protective
Union has set the ball rolling. The Presi
dio band comes under the head properly
of non-union labor.
"If Mr. Sutro wishes for the patronage
of the working classes and their continued
favor and support he must be willing to
employ union help," said Mr. Davis yes
terday.
And what Mr. Davis says counts, for he
is the secretary of the Musicians' Mutual
Protective Union of San Francisco. "I
am not expressing an individual opinion
in this matter," he added, ''but rather
voicing the sentiments of our members
and the members of other unions. Per
sonally, I regret that this difficulty has
arisen. To-morrow the executive com
mitte of the union will meet. The matter
will be laid before them for action. Some
action will certainly be taken. Mr. Sutro
may be asked to dispense with the Presidio
band in favor of a union band. If he
should accede to this request all will go
well."
"If he should refuse?"
"Well, I cannot anticipate the action of
the union, but 1 know what tne usual pro
cedure is. We can lay the matter before
the TradeÃ- Council and ask that body to
request all men and women who believe
in the principle of upholding the price of
labor â there are a good many of them in
this City â to refrain from patronizing the
Sutro baths. Such a request would doubt
less be complied with.
"The Trades Council might even formally
lay the baths under the ban as a place
where non-union labor is employed. This
would keep a good many thousand people
away from the baths. This is probably
what would be done.
"Yes, I dare say Mr. Sutro would con
sider our attitude as an interference with
his private businessâ that is, should he op
pose the union's request But we operate
under the same laws as the Standard Oi.'
Company, for instance, only that our
struggle is to maintain wages up to the
standard of a merely decent living, while
the oil monopoly struggles in a much
more interfering manner, and often by
secret and underhand means, to pile mill
ions info the coffers of men already im
mensely wealthy. This talk about inter
fering with other men's business sounds
big to those who let other men do their
thinking, but it won't stand the test of
good logic.
"I hope we snan't have trouble with Mr.
Jsutro in this matter, but we surely will if
he refuses to employ union musicians at
the batbs. At all events we shall, know
more after the meeting of the executive
committee to-morrow."
A DEFECTIVE COMPLAINT.
It Relieves a Preacher of a Charge of
Perjury.
The Rev. H. E. Howland has been grant
ed a new trial by the Supreme Court, be
cause the complaint which he tiled against
a man named Howard and upon which a
charge of perjury was based, was defective.
The Rev. Howland was a traveling
preacher. He went to Pasadena, and
after being there a few days he filed a
complaint against a man named Howard,
charging him with disturbing a meeting.
The complaint fell through and Howland
was charged, tried and convicted and sen
tenced for perjury in consequence. He was
now serving a two years' time in the State
prison until released yesterday.
The complaint against Howard was de
fective, says the Supreme Court, and
therefore there could have been no per
jury, even though it was sworn to. The
order denying a new trial has therefore
been reversed and the lower court is in
structed to acquit upon a second hearing
of the case. (

at any moment. That he has lived even
for a few hours with a puncture of the
heart is astonishing to the physicians who
have charge of his case at the Receiving
Hospital.
"It is a wonderful case," stated Dr.
Edwin Bunnell yesterday. "I was in the
Receiving Hospital when the young man
was brought there and have watched him
to this hour, noticing every detail which I
find of unusual interest. When he was
first nut Into the hospital van at Market
and Powell streets Sunday night, Murphy
was already weak from loss of blood, and
the officers feared he would die on their
hands. Before he reached me he must have
lost a quart more. The usual remedies
were applied to stop the flow, but about
midnight another and more violent hem
orrhage set in.
"At this time I opened up the wound
that I might better examine it, and the
gush of blood and air told how the knife
had penetrated the left lung.
"It is not unusual for a person to linger
on or recover entirely from a cut in the
lung, but it is the other cut that puzzles
me.
"The knife penetrated between the fifth
and sixth ribs, right where the apex of the
heart is located, hence that part of the
heart must have been punctured, and the
muscles cut.
"The weapon with which Murphy was
stabbed was an ordinary pocket knife, one
with a blade about two and a half inches
long. If the blade had gone into the body
at right angles it would have reached the
heart's cavity, and death must have oc
curred almost instantly. However, the
cut had an upward course, which is
probably the only thing to which Murphy
can account for his unusual lease of life.

lie Lived for Many Hours After Having His Heart Punctured by a Knife-
Thrust at the Hand of Candy Peddler Grodner.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
Nevertheless, the knife's blade must have
pierced the upper portion of the heart to
a depth of nearly a quarter of an inch,
which, with the cutting of the lung tissues,
accounts for the great flow of blood. That
the young fellow has lived to this hour is
remarkable beyond all medical annals."
Late in the afternoon yesterday the
patient grew very weak. The beating of
his pulse could hardly be felt. Nausea set
in as well, and with his "empty retching"
the flow of blood inwardly as well as
outwardly continued.
Solomon Grodner, who wielded the
knife, has little to say of the affair more
than be stated when arrested. He devotes
most of his time in the cell nursing his
bruised face and crying over his sad pre
dicament.
The police have been investigating the
case, and from what has been learfled
there will be but little chance of convict
ing Grodner on any charge whatsoever.
Grodner, who is a peddler of candy in
and around the saloons and other resorts
about Eddy and Powell streets, had laid
aside his pack for the night, and he had
just bought a sandwich which he was eat
ing on the south side of Eddy street.
Daniel Murphy and four other young
men who had been drinking and
making things generally disagreeable
on that thoroughfare, came out of the
saloon at 11 Eddy street and picKed Grod
ner as a mark with which to .have fun.
Murphy made a lunge so as to strike the
sandwich out of the peddler's hand, and
failing he reached out with the Qther hatiii,
striking Grodner in the face. The blow
knocked the lad's hat into the gutter, and
as he picked if up he called Murphy some
hard names.
The hoodlums retired again to 11 Eddy
street and drank some more.
In the meantime Grodner stepped into
the cigar-store and asked for some paper
with which 10 wipe his hat, but the man
in charge refused to give it to him, fearing
Murphy and his crowd would resume the
battle in his place. It was at this juncture,
and when Grodner pulled and opened his
pocket-knife to scrape the dirt from his hat.
that a friend notified him to get away, as
the hoodlums were coming out of the
saloon to beat him.
Fearing the encounter Grodner stepped
to the sidewalk, where Murphy planted a
cruel fist blow on the Jioy's face. Grodner,
in his attempt to protect himself from fur
ther assault shoved Murphy away. The
knife was in his hand, the blade made
an ugly wound, and Murphy swooned
away into the arms of one of his friends.
"Bob" Burdette.
Robert Burdette, the genial humorist, will
deliver his lecture on "Good Medicine" at the
New Auditorium to-night. It is said that the
address is full of humor and that it also con
tains plenty of sound logic.
TO HELP THE CHILDREN.
Olympic Club to Give a Benefit at the
__ New Auditorium.
"There is a good deal of enthusiasm in
the Olympic Club over the entertainment
which will be given next Saturday night
at the new Auditorium for the benefit of
the Salvation Army's Children's Home.
A fine programme is being prepared.
Indeed, it is expected that the perform
ance will surpass that which was presented
at the Olympic Club benefit, which proved
such a success some months ago at the
Columbia Theater. Frank Belcher, the
popular barytone, has delayed his depart
ure East on purpose to sing at the enter
tainment, and the athletes are preparing
some special exhibitions of skill. Leandro
and Belau will perform on the triple bars
and Artz and Brornmer will give exhibi
tions on the rings.
The Reliance Glee Club will sing at the
entertainment. A. yon Bendeleden is to
give female impersonations, and Cook,
Toohig, McNally and Sagaman are to give
acrobatic performances. The Acme Club
of Oakland will also lend its aid. The
full list of performers includes Frank
Belcher, Bob Mitchell, Jack Cathcart, Pete
Sloan, James Swinnerton, W. J. Hynes,
Alex Rosborough, Charles Cathcart, W.
W. Finnic, D. If. Ward, W. H. Hallett.
Frank Coffin, Plymouth Quartet, Charles
Morel, Charles Kreling, Phil Fay.
The management of the new Auditor
ium has donated the house, and as it is
expected that there will be a large at
tendance the Salvation Army hopes to
reap a sum which will materially benefit
the Children's Home.
ARBITRATION IS FAVORED
Chamber of Commerce to Consider
Eesolutions Deprecating War
With England.
Speeches to Be Made on the Subject
by Several Clergymen and
Others.
At a meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce, to be held next Thursday afternoon
at 2:30 o'clock, the following will be pre
sented for ratification :
The committee on international arbitration
at New York has adopted Hie following reso
lution:
Wherkah, The "true grandeur of nations
means the arts of civilization, justice secured
by statute, the magnanimity inspired by good
will, which fundamental conditions are always
marred by the wasteful and bitter violence of
war; and whereas, the United States and
Great Britain, akin in language, jurispru
dence, legal methods and essential love of
right, are already accustomed to arbitrate
their disagreements and have emphatically
declared themselves in favor of such arbitra
tionâCongress by the action of both houses
in 1890, and the House of Commons by its
vote in 1893; therefore.
Resolved, That we earnestly desire such ac
tion by our National Legislature and the ex
ecutive as shall make permanent provision for
some wise method oi arbitration between the
two countries, it being our hope that such a
step will lead to international arbitration
throughout the civilized world.
A. S. Hewitt, Chairman.
Invitations have been issued to the fol
lowing named to attend the meeting and
speak on the resolution : Judge Beatty,
Archbishop Riordan, Rabbi Voorsanger,
Judge Garner, Rev. H. Stebbins, Irving
M. Scott, Rev. Robert Mackenzie, R. B.
Forman and Horace Davis.
The Yoeemite Valley.
Secretary Sheehan of the Yo3emite Commis
sion said yesterday that it is probable that
within two weeks the roads to the valley will
be opened for the benefit of those who may
wish to visit there. The next meeting of the
commission will be held in the valley ia June
next.
ALL MUST GO TO COURT.
Subpenas Issued Calling for the
Papers of James G.
Fair.
BUT ATTORNEYS WILL EESIST.
" May Be Taken to Court, but to Show
the Papers Is Another
Matter."
Snbpenas were issued and served upon
Reuben H. Lloyd, Charles S. Wheeler,
George A. Knight and Charles S. Heg
gerty, who are interested in the es
tate of the late James G. Fair, requiring
them to produce in court on Friday next
"all letters, documents and writings of
any kind written by or purporting to be
signed by James G. Fair, Jas. G. Fairbr J.
G. Fair."
The subpenas were issued by order of
the court at the instance of Delmas &
Shortridge, representing Dr. Marc Leving
ston, executor of the "will of the 24th," or
the pencil will.
Similar pubpenas were served yesterday
upon those not so interested in tn'e later
wiJl, including W. S. Goodfellow, Messrs.
Angus and Bresse, trustees of the earlier
will; Richard Dey and Charles Neal, who
have had close relationship to the dead
millionaire as private secretaries. Charles
L. Fair was also served yesterday morning
with a similar subpena calling for papers
relating in any way to the wills.
This, the lawyers say, includes the
earlier will and all that pertains to it. This
move will bring all the lawyers and
Charley Fair himself into court, as the
subpena is an order of court to refuse
which would cause them to be deemed
guilty of contempt and "liable to Day all
losses and damages sustained thereby to
the parties aggrieved and to forfeit $100 in
addition thereto," according to the lan
guage of ;the subpena itself.
The lawyers and trustees are not at all
pleased at this prospect. In speaking
of it George Knight said: "Of course we
will obey the subpena. We will produce
the papers but "
Then he looked out of the west window
to where the blue smoke of his neighbors'
chimneys was curling up to heaven.
The trustees of the earlier will also
stated that they would produce the papers
in court, "but to show them to anybody,
possibly excepting the court," they said,
"was entirely a different matter." One of
the trustees is reported to have at first
declared a flat refusal to obty the subpena.
The lawyers say that what papers and in
formation they may have came into their
possession in their professional capacity,
and they will not, therefore, be compelled
to divulge or exhibit either.
George Knight stated that no move had
been made on the part of the representa
tives of Charles Fair or the sisters.
"We are waiting to see what the others
will do," he said. "We have held no meet
ing, and I am not certain that we will do
so. I have been busy with the Davidson
case to-day. If we come together it will
not be before Wednesday."
At the office of Delmas <fc Shortridge no
new developments were reported except
that the subpenas referred to had been
Issued upon their motion in the desire to
get at all the facts.
Russell Wilson, who is the attorney for
Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss J?air, and who has
figured in the previous litigation as against
the trustees, had been reported as saying
that he intended to join forces in favor of
the pencil will. Mr. Wilson declares this
tor be untrue. He says that he believes the
pencil will to be genuine and has said so
repeatedly, but that he has never declared
any intention of fighting the opponents of
that will.
WOMEN OF SHAKESPEARE
W. Greer Harrison's Essay Be
fore the Woman's Press
Association.
Colonel Dickinson's Address and a
Programme of Classic Vocal
Gems.
Over 500 of the City's most cnltured
ladies assembled in Golden Gate Hall at
yesterday's open meeting of the Pacific
Coast Woman's Press Association. In the
audience could be noticed many to whom
years had brought additional dignity and
grace; but most of those present were
young ladies, who, while they displayed
none of the characteristics associated with
bloomers and blue stockings, looked far
more intelligent and infinitely more
charming than the average gathering of
young men.
The meeting being called to order by
Mrs. Van Pelt, the genial lady president,
Cheminade's ballad, "Rosamonde," was
sung by J. H. Toler, who gave as an en
core Pease's romantic song, "Darling, Kiss
My Eyelids Down." Mr. Toler's ringing,
.silvery tenor was ably seco nded by Mrs.
Eva Wren's artistic accompaniment.
Miss Fannie Jeffreys Pray recited a
clever satire on the state of things which
might be supposed to prevail should the
"new woman," as commonly understood,
come. to be a power in the land. The
sketch dealt with the domestic trials of a
husband forced to manage the nursery
and kitchen while his advanced helpmeet
devoted her attention to the office, the
promenade und the club.
Next came Dudley Buck's beautiful
solo, "When the Heart Is Young/ which
was charmingly rendered by Mrs. Wren,
and as charmingly accompanied by Mr.
Toler. Mrs. Wren's voice was much ad
mired by all present, her high notes in
particular beine soft and natural, clear
and well sustained.
Colonel T. M. Dickinson of Alameda
made a brief, but interesting address
on Ihe "Evolution of Woman." He
said the time had been when the best of
women were by a stretch of magnanimous
consideration regarded as just below the
leÂ»el of the lowest man. That time, how
ever, had passed, and now woman in her
sphere was regarded as equal to man in
his. It had taken the world some cen
turies to arrive at this natural and just
conclusion, but now that it was reached
he said the future held great possibilities
for woman. His remarks were inter
spersed with a number of well-timed an
ecdotes and comparisons, which evoked
frequent demonstrations of applause from
his appreciative and critical audience.
Mrs. Wren and Mr. Toler sang Hen
shaw'sduet, "Eden Land," after which
William Greer Harrison read a paper on
11 The Women of Shakespeare."
Nothing could be more thorough than
Mr. Harrison's analysis of some of the
heroines whose loves and livea form so in
teresting a . feature in toe plays of the
Bard of Avon. In reviewing " King Lear "
Mr. Harrison brought out with rare lucid
ness the contrast between the gentle Cor
delia and her two vixenish sisters. In
Portia, Beatrice, Isabelle and Rosalind
the essayist found instances of Shakes
pears types of the intellectual woman.
The cold, keen logic of the female barris
ter, the astute yet honorable diplomacy of
the Spanish Queen, the cutting irony of
Beatrice and the gay, capricious, harm
less wit of Rosalind were all noted with an
appreciative particularity which evinced
long familiarity with the types described.
Mr. Harrison's portrayal of Juliet was
especially graphic. He' described her as a
tender girl, whose heart had just become
the seat of a passion, ardent and scul
consuming, yet pure and stainless. The
paper was rather long, but when the
essayist would have abridged it he was
requested amid much applause to continue
it to the end.
A discussion was to have followed the
reading of the paper, but on its conclusion
the ladies agreed that Mr. Harrison had
covered the ground so thoroughly and so
well that there was nothing left to discuss.
DOUGHERTY, NOT KLOOS.
The Wrong Man Arrested for an As
sault to Murder.
The preliminary examination of Charles
Kloos, charged with assault to murder,
was held before Judge Campbell yester
day afternoon. The complaining witness
was Edward Bowen, a peddler.
Bowen and his wife attended the mas
querade ball of the Verein Eintracht So
ciety in the Mechanics' Pavilion, and on
their way home about 6 o'clock next
morning with some friends they got into
a tight with Kloos and his friends on Polk
street, near Hayes, during which Bowen
was stabbed in the back, but not seriously.
From the evidence yesterday it was
made manifest that Kloos did not stab
Bowen, but suspicion pointed to* John
Dougherty, a plumber, one of Kloos'
friends. "Dougherty was booked on a
charge of assault to murder and the case
against Kloos was continued pending fur
ther investigation, his bonds being fixed
at $1000.
THE WALKING WAS GOOD
Why Annie Sloane May Not Re
cover Damages From
the Railroad.
She Must Forfeit One Thousand Dol
;.>} lars or Stand a New
â¢ â¢ Trial.
The case of Annie Sloane has not found
favor with the Supreme Court. In fact, it
is threatened that unless she will knock
off $1000 from the verdict she received the
court will grant a new trial, and then she
may get nothing.
The plaintiff took passage on the South
ern California Railroad at Pomona for San
Diego. At San Bernardino she changed
cars, but the former conductor had taken
up her ticket, and when 3he boarded the
second train she had nothing to show for
her . fare. The second . conductor de
manded more money, and; the passenger
had none to give him. She was thereupon
told she would have to get off . at ; the next
station, which was East Riverside.
= She got off at East Riverside and started
to walk back to Colton, where she could bor
row some money. , She had gone but a mile
when a wagon passed, and the driver vol
unteered to take her the rest of the way.
She sued the railroad for damages and was
awarded $1400.
: The Supreme Court concurs with her
contentions through most of the case â in
fact until the real damage begins. Then
there :is : a dissent. She : cannot recover
damages for walking back, the court says,
because . the road was smooth, the country
level and the walking good. Besides she
only walked a little way and then a wagon
overtook her. She is entitled to compensa
tion for loss of time, breach of contract and
humiliation, but she must consent to a re
duction of $1000 from the verdict or a new
trial will.be ordered. When she gets her
$400 and pays her costs, there will be jittle
left to show for that walk back from River
side. â¢â¢â â¢-â 
INVASION OF THE HOSTS.
Five Hundred Hotel Men to Be
Hospitably Entertained in
California.
Six Days of Pleasure to Be Spent in
This Vicinityâ Kings of Their
Class.
In something less than a month from
to-day California will be acting as host to
about 500 members of the Hotel Men's
Mutual Benefit Association of the United
States, an organization comprising the
proprietors of the most important hostel
ries in the United States.
Their selection of California as the place
for holding their annual meeting and ban
quet was due to the efforts of the Southern
California Hotel Association, which body
will act as host during the sojourn of the
visitors in that part of the State, while the
California Hotel Association will heartiJy
second the efforts of their brethren in the
south.
The hotel men will gather in Chicago
and leave there April 10 on three special
trains that will vie in elegance and com
fort with anything ever run on rails in
this or any other country.
Among the party will be such men as
Bolot of the Waldorf, New York; J. H.
Brenlin of the Gilsey House, New York;
Stafford & Whitaker" of the New Nether
lands and Imperial, New York, and of the
Walton, Philadelphia: HauK & Wether
bee, formerly of the Windsor and now of
the Manhattan. New York; Hitchcock of
the Fifth Avenue, New York; Kinsey &
Baumann of ttie Holland, New York;
of the Ashland, New York:
Shears, proprietor of the largest hotel in
Cincinnati; Alvin Hulbert of the Great
Northern and Tremont hotels of Chicago.
Ten days will be spent in Southern Cal
ifornia, the itinerary having been po ar
ranged that the sojourners will be enabled
to witness that unique and extraordinary
celebration Deculiar to and possible ouly
in California, known as the floral festival
of Santa Barbara, and to participate in the
State's great fiesta to be held in Los
Angeles.
The annual meeting of the association
will be held in the latter city and the
grand banquet at Coronado. An interest
ing incident in connection with this visit
of this host of public hosts is that two
local agents of French wines have offered
to supply free the champagne for the ban
quet at Coronado and also for that to be
tendered the guests in this City, offerings
that are valued close upon $2000. It has
been remarked by a member of the local
reception committee that the California
wine-makers have been slow to see their
opportunity in this occasion, and have
not made any systematic or other effort
to get their products fairly before a class
of men who are in a position to do much
to secure for California wines their proper
place on the wine cards of the hotels of
the country.
All arrangements were completed yes
terday for the entertainment of the visi
tors after their arrival here from JUos
Angeles. They are expected to amve
here shortly before the dinner hour on tha
23d of April. That meal over, a trip will
be made through Chinatown and theater
parties will be organized, the visitors then
and during their stay in this part of the
State being the guests of the California
Hotel Association.
On Friday, the 24th, there will be drives
about the City, to the Presidio, to the Cliff
House, where there will be a lunch for the
various parties, and then a homeward
drive through Golden Gate Park. In the
evening the guests will be tendered a ban
quet at the Palace Hotel by the California
Hotel Association.
At 8 a. m. Saturday they will be taken
down to Stanford University, which insti
tution they will be given full opportunity
to inspect, and at 11:30 a, m. their train
will be taken for San Jose. Here drives
through the beautiful suburbs of the Gar
den City will be followed by ajlunch at the
Vendome, tendered by the citizens of that
enterprising city. A"t 3:45 P. M. they will
depart for Monterey and Del Monte. That
night a ball at the Del Monte Hotel will
provide entertainment.
Sunday will be taken Tip with a jaunt
over the seventeen-mile drive and with a
sacred concert at the Del Monte in the
evening.
Departure will be taken for Santa CruÂ«
at 9a.m. on Monday. A drive along the
beach and the bluffs will occupy the time
before lunch, which will be served at the
Sea Beach Hotel. Then will come a drive
up to the Big Trees and later the return to
San Francisco.
On Tuesday there will be a monster ex
cnrsion on the bay on one of the ferry
boats, during which there will be dancing,
for which excellent music will be provided,
and there will aho be other forms of enter
tainment.
The return eastward will be over the
Central Pacific .Railroad, and will be begun
on Wednesday, the 29th.
Changes on the Xarrow-Gauge.
There will be a change in the train schedule
on the narrow-gauge road to Santa Cruz, made
by the Southern Pacific, to go into effect next
Saturday. The hunters' train to Los Gatos will
be taken off for the summer and an excursion
train to Santa Cruz put on, leaving the narrow
gauge mole 7:45 a. m. daily.
