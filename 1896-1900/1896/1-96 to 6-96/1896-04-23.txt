SCHULZE LOVED
A GAY WIDOW
Mrs. Burrill Was to Have
Married the Tacoma
Embezzler.
MET IN SAN FRANCISCO
The Rascally Land Agent Lost
His Heart at a Bohemian
Club Dinner.
GAVE THE WOMAN A FOETUNE
His Rumored Engagement to Marie
Wainwright, the Actress,
Disproved.
PORTLAND, Or., April 22.â 1n refuta
tion of the oft-asserted rumor of the en
gagement of Marie Wainwright. the
actress, to Paul Schulze, the colossal de
faulter, who committed suicide in Tacoma
last summer after swindling the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company and other cor
porations out of over $1,250,000, Frank S.
Chamberlain of San Francisco to-night
told to a Call correspondent a strange
story. The narrative Mr. Chamberlain
related must dispel all lingering belief in
the rumored engagement between Miss
Wainwright and the crooked land agent.
Mr. Chamberlain's story also accounts for
$300,000 of the $1,250,000 stolen by Schulze.
"About two years before Mr. Schulze
died," said Mr. Chamberlain, "he met
Mrs. Charlotte Burrill, a young widow
from Winchester, Va., at a Bohemian Club
reception in San Francisco. She was on
the coast visiting friends. I was acquainted
with her and teased her late that evening
for allowing a comparative stranger like
Mr. Sciiulze to pay her the attention he
did. She smilingly answered that she
fancied him as one of the most gallant
gentlemen she had yet met In San Fran
cisco, and if she permitted him to pay his
devoirs to her it was her affair and con
cerned none other.
"After this mild snub, I refrained from
further commenting on the subject to her.
But a few niont later I heard that the
Tacoma financier and Miss. Burrill were
encaged. Later I personally informed
myself, as a matter of curiosity, that every
two or three months Mrs. Burrill made
trips to Tacoma, where she also had
friends, but, as a matter of fact, to see her
fiance, Mr. Schulze. I will vouch, though,
for the strictly pure and honorable nature
of their relations, for Mrs. Burrill was a
woman of irreproachable character, whose
estimate of a good name was priceless.
"Early iti 1895, Mrs. Burrill no longer
concealed the fact that she and Mr. Schulze
were to be married Some time in the fall.
In substantiation of this she exhibited to.
a few of her most intimate friends a $500
diamond ring,' and on several occasions
large sums in paper money, forwarded to
her by Mr. Schulze, per registered mail.
For what purpose this money was sent she
did not tell, but she cut the dash of a prin
cess. VVy-r? y'
"Last winter when Mr. Schulze met his
untimely death and the report of his
heavy defalcation reached San Francisco
I happened to be lodging in the house of
some of Mrs. Burrill's friends also my
friends. It was a fearful shock to her,
from which she scarcely rallied in â¢ a
month. She did not attend the funeral of
her betrothed, but soon thereafter she re
turned to Winchester and in December
last she and a sister went to Europe,
where the pretty widow is being consoled,
from what I hear.
"About a month ago I moved into the
room Mrs. Burrill occupied in the house
of our friends, and on opening a drawer I
found a lot of partly-destroyed letters writ
ten by Mr. Schulze which the widow had
forgotten to throw into the fire before her
departure. Natural curiosity led me to
patch up a few of them, and tneir contents
convinced me that Mr. Shulze not only
was madly in love with Mrs. Burrill, but
that he also sent her a fortune during
their engagement. .'*'.-â  ."-;â '
"The most interesting of the letters was
this one," remarked Mr. Chamberlain,
drawing a missive from his pocket-book
bearing date June 16, 1895, written at Ta
coma and signed "With unquenchable love
and devotion, your own Paul." * It said: :
So soon as 1 can arrange my business affairs
bo that I can take a month's rest 1 will go to San
Francisco and there once again enjoy the
aroma of your delightful presence and the
charm of your incomparable Intellectu
ality. * * * The last package of banknotes
I mailed to you. makes a total of $285,000. I
trust you may well husband these resources,
for in these times of depression the most un
expected may come to pass. '.* â â * ***
"That Bohemian Club reception made
Mrs. Bun-ill's fortune ; and even if she did
lose a lover she has enough money to buy
a titled one in Europe," was Mr. Chamber
lain's concluding remarks. < y "',/,_
STEALING ELECTRICITY.
Brooklyn Saloon-Keepers Illuminate Their
Resorts at the Expense of a Rail
road Company.
NEW YORK. N. V., April 22.â Richard
Rademacher, proprietor of a saloon in
Brooklyn, was arraigned in the Ewen
street Police Court, that City, vestexday to
answer a charge of petit larceny. â }'. Henry
R. Brockbank, superintendent of electric
construction of the Brooklyn, Queens
County and Suburban Railroad Company,
said the prisoner had stolen electricity
from the company. - y ,
Rademacher said he had no doubt that
his saloon had been illuminated for sev
eral months with electricity stolen from
the railroad company, but , leaded that
he bought the current not knowing that
it was stolen. H<. explained that two
young men had asked him a year ago
to let them light his \ saloon with electric
ity, offering him more electric lamps than
The San Francisco Call.
he had gas-burners for half the sum he
had been paying ' for gas. He consented,
found the light satisfactory and paid for it
monthly. He was unable to tell who the
men were. Justice Laimber paroled Kaae
macher pending an . investigation.by the
police, who hope to find the two men.
One indicator in the railroad company's
power-house has shown for a year that
power has been taken from the supply
wires. Many efforts have been made to
find the leaks. A tree in front of Rade
macher's saloon caught fire two weeks ago,
supposedly from a trolley wire coming in
contact with it. Linemen were sent to re
pair the wire and found that a wire led to
the saloon. Two other saloons have been
lighted by the same parties, but the line
men have not been able to discover the
wires that supply these places.
STILL TALK OF WAR.
The London Papers Again Assume a Bel
ligerent Attitude on the Venezuelan
Question.
LONDON, Exg., April 22. âThe St. James
Gazette says: Tne revival of the Vene
zuelan question reminds us that even the
wars in Africa are trivial compared with
the real danger which has existed in the
West since December. The American de
mand that the United States shall decide
our quarrels and settle our frontier is in
admissible, and no amount of talking
around the matter will make it anything
else. President Cleveland last December
referred everything to a special commis
sion, and when it was too late attempted
to negotiate. We are now told to be pre
pared for a report that is hostile to the
claim of Great Britain. What will happen
then? There is reason to believe that an
attempt will now be made to work upon
English feeling in favor of surrender of
our Government. This is vain. Our posi
tion is simply that British frontier ques
tions are matters for negotiation with the
parties concerned.
The Globe says: All hope of a weak
kneea compliance of Great Britain with
the views of the United States are ground
less.
The Westminster Gazette says: There
was no reason why Lord Salisbury should
have rejected the proposal for a joint com
mission. y-. ; y*l,y
WAS NEARLY MURDERED.
Speaker Byers of the lowa House of Repre
sentatives Roughly Treated by
a Client.
DES MOINES, lowa, April Speaker
H. W. Byers of the lowa House of Repre
sentatives was nearly murdered last night
at his home at Harlan. He had acted as
attorney for Colonel A. R. Jack and they
had just settled their accounts.
Jack sent for Byers to come to his office,
which he did. Arrived tbere, Jack, who
is about twice as large as the Speaker,
locked the door, put the key in his pocket
and announced there was going to be
trouble. He presented Byers a check for
$150- and demanded ' that 'the-*- Speaker
s>igh~it.-y_\ . :* ,: '
Byers refused and Jack assaulted him.
He threw the Speaker down and pounded
him viciously. Byers became insensible
as a result of the treatment and Jack be
came fearful that he had committed
murder. He desisted from the punish
ment and went away. Byers was cared
for and taken home. His face was badly
bruised and his back wrenched, but it is
understood the injuries will not be dan
gerous.
Dead Under a Stairway.
NEW YORK,' N. V., April 22.-The
police of the East Thirty-fifth-street station
reported this afternoon that a woman was
found dead under the stairway of i the
house at 636 Second avenue. It is supposed
that she has been dead about a week, as the
body was very much decomposed.

THE PRESIDENT'S MISHAP
An Accident That Caused Wild
Rumors to Be Scattered
Broadcast.
One of His Horses Stumbled, Fell and
Kicked Dashboard and Lamps Out
of the Carriage.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22.-Short
ly after dark this evening a disturbing
rumor was in circulation to the effect that
while President Cleveland was . driving to
his Woodley residence, after leaving the
Executive Mansion this evening, his car
riage came -in collision with a cable-car
and that the President had been*; thrown
out and had received serious injuries. *
Inquiries were numerous from all direc
tions, but in a little time information was
obtained from Officials closely associated
with the President that the only founda
tion for the widely spread, story was that
as the j President's carriage was being
driven along U street, near the outskirts
of the city, one of the horses stumbled and
fell, causing the other horse also to lose
his footing. The animal kicked vigor
onsly, broke one of the lamps of the car
riage and also broke the dashboard and
ruined the harness.. The President did
not immediately alight, as .'the coachman
was quickly on the ground and disen
tangled the animals from the Victoria.
Hon. Gardner G. Huobard was driving
along the road and seeing the plight the
President was in stopped and tendered his
carriaee to the President, who accepted a
seat in it and was conveyed home in time
for dinner. ' V

Cuba with a gentleman who has just ar
rived from Havana.

gentleman said hat all the talk of the

Cubans were convinced that they had the
best of the situation and weie sure to gain
their independence. | But in the interest of
humanity they hope the : United States
would recognize them as belligerents, as
that would , stop the Killing of unarmed
people and the execution of prisoners S of

to bring about an earlier ending of the war.

First Session of the Inter

EDMUNDS IS CHAIRMAN.
He : Safd the Convention Had Met
to Aid the Interests of the
Government.
CARNEGIE SENT A CHECK.
It Occasioned a Good Deal of Talk
. and -a Motion Made to Send It
-A. Back Was Tabled.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 22.-The
International Arbitration Congress began
a two days' session in Metzerott Hall in
this city to-day. Gardiner G. Hubbard
called the convention to order and intro
duced Hon. John W. Foster, ex-Secretary
of State v as temporary chairman.
Mr. Foster -in. his opening address said
that he could not refrain from expressing
his pride at the record which this country
had made in the past half century of un
broken peace with all the nations of the
earth and : of a; steady adherence to ; the
settlement of international difficulties by.
the pacific method of arbitration a record
almost without parallel among the nations
of the earth. - Ay^A: :' y A : yAi
: "You have riot, therefore," he said, â¢'as
sembled to recommend to our Government
any new departure in ; its policy on this
subject, but rather to strengthen and con
firm it in \ the policy so ' long and so con
sistently followed.* ' \ . - "'. - }
"And if this conference shall result in a
permanent plan whereby their differences
may be adjusted by arbitration, it will win
for itself the fame of one of the memorable'
assemblies of all history.". J > V
.. Ex-Senator Edmunds ;of Vermont : was
chosen permanent chairman and . made a
brief .speech; He said the convention had
met to aid and promote the interests of the
Government. It was a pitiful thought
that in this time -of peace over nearly all
the world more than a million capable of
taking part in the : progress of civilization
were kept under arms and a billion dollars
diverted to their support. , ;
A letter ? from Chief Justice Fuller, who
was unable to attend, was read. He ex
pressed his sympathy with the object of
the meeting. A letter was also read from
Andrew Carnegie of Pittsburg, stating that
he, was â  unable to attend the conference,
but asking to . have his name associated
with those who favored arbitration, and
inclosing a check for $1000, to be used for
any purpose the convention saw fit.
.On motion of Mr. Dodge of New York a
committee of fifteen was appointed on
resolutions and a committee of five on
order of business. Ay ty
The chair named Messrs. L. T. Chamber
lain of New York, S. H. McCormick of
Chicago, J. S. Billings of Philadelphia,
Robert T. Payne of Boston and J. C. Mor
ris of New Orleans as the latter committee.
The following six delegates were named
for the committee on resolutions, the
others to be announced later: J. D. Angel,
Michigan, chairman; J. B. Moore, New
York; A. D. White, New York; Henry
Hitchcock, St. Louis; L. L. Currie, Vir
ginia, and G. W. Blatchford, Illinois. Dr.
L. T. Chamberlain of New York spoke of
the history and purpose of the movement.
At the conclusion of Dr. Chamberlain's
remarks John Doliphon of Missouri rose
to a question of order. He moved that
the check from Mr. Carnegie be returned
with thanks. If the boards of trade of
the various cities would not pay the ex
pense of the convention he thought that
the delegates themselves could meet all
needs. A'yy.yA:
Mr. Carnegie, he said, was contracting
with this and other countries for furnish
ing munitions of war, and he had been
charged (the truth of the charge Mr. Doli
phon would not vouch for) with "stinting"
his employes. Mr. Carnegie might be
earnest in bis desire for arbitration, but
he thought that it would be humiliating
to accept money from him. Mr. Weeks
of Pittsburg defended Mr. Carnegie, and
said it was neither right nor proper, in his
opinion, to attack his generosity. He
moved to lay the motion on the tabic.
The chair at first ruled that the whole
matter should go to the committee on
resolutions, but eventually put the motion
of Mr. Weeks, and by a viva voce vote
the motion to reject Mr. Carnegie's con
tribution was tabled. . A'Aiiy
A recess until 8 o'clock was then taken.
. To-night's session was well attended.
Mr. ' Edmunds presided and' intro
duced Carl Schurz as the first speaker.
Mr. Schurz . said that in the resort
to arbitration in case of international
difficulties the United States was the nat
ural leader of the movement, and he could
conceive for it no nobler or more I benefi
cial mission. ' L "
Mr. Schurz declared that the institution
of a regulated and permanent system of
arbitration between the United States and
Great Britain would not be a "sentimental
cooing between loving cousins, nor a mere
stage show gotten up for the amusement
of the public, but a very serious contriv
ance intended for very serious business,
and would set to mankind the example of
two very great, practical and hard-headed
nations deliberately 'agreeing to abstain
from the barbarous ways of bygone times
in adjusting questions of conflicting inter
ests or attftfttion.*' ' â  *'â *" "

CLEVER FORGERS IN JAIL

LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 22.â
first part of the gorgeous street parade
occupied the center of the city from 2 to 5
o'clock this afternoon. Streetcars were at
a standstill. Wagons were stalled at every
block. It was impossible to get through
some of the crowded thoroughfares even
on foot People 'occupied every favorably
located balcony and filled the windows
and doorways along the line of march.
Spectators' stands erected at many points
along the line of march were thronged.
The grand stand at Seventh and Hope
streets was occupied by about 5000 people,
and â  there was room for no more. It is
estimated that there were at least 150,000
persons in Los Angeles this afternoon. It
is certain that tbe hotels and boarding
houses had yesterday about all the guests
they could accommodate. The demand
for sleeping places is greater to-night,
however, and dozens of trains brought
visitors into the city this forenoon and
took them back at evening.
Governor Budd is the distinguished man
among the new arrivals. He is at tne
Nadeau, and he has been hugely enjoying
the Fiesta..
The weather has been delightful. Last
night's showers had left no trace at sun
rise except that the Japanese lanterns
were nearly all down. It had been feared
tnat tbe rain would cause the colors in.the
bunting to run together, but that was not
the case. The day was bright and beau
tiful. There was no dust, and on the
whole the rain was beautiful. ....:_ .._;'.*-.'.
At 2 o'clock this afternoon the Queen of
the Fiesta sat under- the' panoply of red,
white and gold, ' , where she was to review
the parade of her fantastic subjects. She
was attended by noblemen, and about her
were the radiant maids of honor. Armed
soldiers in carnival uniforms stood on
guard. On both sides of the Queen's
throne extended the rows of tribunes, the
grand stand accommodations provided for
the invited guests. Across the pavement
of the fiesta court were more tribunes, the
rows on both j sides extending a hundred
yards. The grand stand was arranged in
the form of a hollow square, the Queen
and her attendants facing from the outer
side. All in the parade marched around
the corner of the side of the square at
which the Queen and her attendants re
mained, and after giving salutes they
marched away around the corner to edify
and enlighten the tens of thousands who
where struggling for room on the streets.
It was a decidedly imposing parade. The
Southern California militia acquitted itself
with the greatest credit, though following
the thoroughly trained marines of the flag
ship Philadelphia battalion. The Califor
nia people were proud of their troops, and
Governor Budd declared that the militia
made an admirable appearance.
The Los Angeles Fire Department made
a great showing for itself, and the floral
decorations of the engines and trucks was
of a veiy elaborate character. The Pueblo
Indians brought here by Charles F. Lum
mis were a feature of the day, and the cow
boys gave another distinctive feature to
the procession. The great and incompre
hensible Chinese dragon, borne by about
sixty sons of the Flowery Kingdom, was
an exceptional attraction for the tourists.
The entire effect of the Chinese . section of
the parade was like that of the memorable
display on Chinese day at the Midwinter
Fair. -Au^Ay^ ';Ai ; jj^^-K â '
National Guard officers, on horseback,
were at the head of the parade, instead of
the usual squad of unbending police. There
were a few advance police skirmishers, but
they were mounted. .*. ;y-{ "v,

The marines from the flagship had the
place of honor in the line, and in their
I white uniforms won admiration all along
the route. Their .salute to the Queen be
fore the broad, red-covered stairway, that
led up to the throne was the occasion of
great applause.
With Colonel Barry and staff the gallant
Seventh Regiment was the pride of South
ern California. All - the people spoke of
them .as : "our soldiers," In the ranks
with the wearers of the blue uniforms was
a pretty girl in white. This girl, "The
Daughter of the Regiment," was Miss E.
A. Sanborn of Santa Paula, 16 years old.
;- During the march she was the recipient
of applause from men, women and chil
dren.",: She ,; rode / a white ' pony and wore
.the > full-dress uniform of the regiment.
The helmet that has been designed for her
was white, with a white plume and golden
chin strap, bearing the arms of the United
States in gold upon the front. For fatigut2
there was a jaunty scarlet fez, embroid
ered in gold, with the insignia of an in
fantry officer. The blue jacket was elabor
ately embroidered in white and gold and
opened over a close-fitting scarlet waist
coat, buttoned to the throat with gold
army buttons. The short skirt was dark
blue, with two broad stripes of gold and
one of white, and neat little dark-blue
gaiters finished the jaunty uniform. The
gauntlets were white, the sword belt of
gold, the hilt heavily chased and gilded,
with an elaborate sword-knot of real gold,
and the blade chased and inlaid with
black enamel, bearing in raised silver let
ters the name "Elteen A. Sanborn" on

TrooD D, the new unattached cavalry
company of Los Angeles, made its first ap
pearance in a public procession. The
troop escorted the queen to the reviewing
stand and then took its place in the line of
march. It is composed of excellent horse
men and the exhibition cavalry drills were
excellent.
Uniformed civic organizations followed
the militia. Major H. M. Russell was mar
shal of this division and he was aided by
Captain A. C. Jones, Captain Falkenberg,
T. E. Russell and S. X. Mezenhuber. The
San Diego band furnished music for the
mounted Foresters, who turned out fifty
strong. Next marched the High School
cadets, in dark blue sailor suits. The Uni
formed Rank, Knights of Pythias, com
pleted the division with 150 members.
The third division was typical of old
California. A troop of caballeros, dressed
in the old Spanish costumes, was made up
of dashing riders. Among these horsemen
was a girl of apparently 12 or 14 years, be
decked with flowers. She stood upon her
saddle, lightly and with evident ease. Be
fore the queen she stopped her horse. The
next instant she jumped to the ground as
gracefully as a bird might have made the
flight. Still holding the bridle, she
calmly, deliberately saluted the queen.
Then she turned to the horse, which was
much taller than she. Her intention was,
apparently, to pat the beautiful animal on
the forehead. The horse gracefully low
ered his head, when the maiden leaned
upon it and was lifted up to the neck and
shoulders of her obedient steed. The next
moment she was standing on the saddle
and away she went with the caballeros.
Accustomed as California is to pretty feats
in horsemanship, this girl won the high
est admiration from the men who live in
. the saddle. yy^y-AA
A dashing and daring lot of riders were
the cowboys, among whom were a few
mounted Indians. A cowboy stopped be
fore the queen and caused his horse to lie
down. The man- stood and bowed, and
when he returned to the saddle the horse
arose with him and went tearing down the
roadway. The Santa Barbara band was
with the horsemen. Ignacio Francisco de
la Cruz Garcia rode in a carriage, and a
placard announced that he was 115 years
old. The Pueblo Indians from New
Mexico were led by Charles F Lummis.
At the head of the division made up :of
the horsemen and Indians was Marshal
C. A. Sumner, with M. A. Wolfskill, C. R.
Sumner, F. W. Sabichi, Conde Jones, C. G.
Rhone, J. J. Johnston, F. W. Millspaugh
and J. R. Winston as aids.
Decorated floats were the features of the
third division, which was led by Captain
Hampton Hutton, marshal, assisted by J.
P. Randolph, H. Drew, William Dunn,
William Mathews and H. Mathews as
aids. First came the Pasadena band, fol
lowed by a gilded eagle perched upon a
stand made of shields bearing the stars
and stripes, and. carried by eight men
covered with fiesta colors.
The Pasadena float was decorated with
roses and had upon it immense multi-col
bred butterflies. Upon two colossal roses
were beautiful maidens. There was a boat
to represent "The God of the Sea," with
Moorish sailors manning the vessel. Next
were the California float and the trade
.float, and these were followed by the grain
and fruit floats and the Cahuenga Valley
float, in which King Lemon was monarch.
The Temescal Indians closed the division.
There were fifty of them. Behind came
'two standard bearers, who carried the war
banner consisting of a collection of Eagle
feathers. The braves* were naked from the
waist up, and their breasts and faces were
covered with paint. The headgear of the
men consisted of feathers a_d bear skins;
that of the squaws of green twigs.
The goreeous Chinese section was led by
General Johnstone Jones, marshal, aided
by John C. Cline, Ralph Duninguey, F. R.
Willis, George Reed, Guy Woodward
Lewis C. Brown, George Wilson, James K.
Stevens and E. C. Attrill.
In the last division of the parade the
beautiful floral decorations of the engines
and trucks of the Fire Denartment were of
high artistic merit. There was a whole
carnival of, flowers in the display' The

air, and the firemen ran aloft to pay their
salute to her Majesty of Fiesta week.
Engine 8 was adorned with smilax,
roses and snowballs. Clara, the daughter
of Engineer Fred Nessler, occupied a seat
on the flower -covered smokestack. A
parasol in fiesta colors and bedecked with
choice flowers shaded the child from the
sun. City Electrician Francis' wagon was
decorated with flowers and carried a
minature fire-alarm system.
A chemical engine was almost entirely
covered with carnations, white roses, farns
and smilax. A department wagon had a
long bell of poppies suspended above the
seat, and back of the seat was the Ameri
can flag, formed of roses. The old oaken
bucket in smilax and roses was displayed.
On another wagon a set of harness seemed
to be made of roses.
When the Fre Department had passed,
the Queen and the maids of honor were
escorted to carriages and the parade moved
about the city for about two hours.
The judges of prizes at the parade are:
Hon. F. W. Henshaw, Oakland; Chief
Sullivan, San Francisco; Hon. W. W.

A FEAST OF MUSIC.
California's Best Talent Appears
Before tbe Queen.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 22.â The
characterization of "he who hath not music
in his soul is fit for treason, stratagem and
spoils" will not apply to the people of this
sunny southland. The grand fiesta con
cert was given at Hazard's Pavilion here
to-night and the great building with its
two balconies was fairly packed with people
eager to hear the famous artists and
musicians. The immense stage platform
was crowded with the orchestra of 100
pieces and the fiesta chorus of 300 trained
voices. This concert was given under the
auspices of the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce and the Merchants' Association
and Board of Trade. Every town and
hamlet in Southern California was repre
sented in the great audience, ladies being
elegantly attired.
At 8:20 o'clock the trumpeters at the
entrance announced the approach of the
Queen. This was answered from Dack of
the stage, then the royal lancers arose and
the orchestra struck up the "Marche de
Entree,"from "Boabdil,"while her Majesty
came slowly down the main aisle, attended
by her prime minister, two pages carrying
her train. The maids of honor followed
ana were seated on the Queen's stand, to
the right of her throne. The Queen was
charming in her magnificent concert
gown. - -,_,'_ .
Conductor Harley Hamilton took his
position, and in subdued but delicate and
sweet strains arose the music of the over
ture, "Anacreon Cherubini." At rap of
the baton the great chorus arose and ren
dered "With Sheathed Swords" (from
"Naanan"), by Costa, the male voices lead
ing. The applause which greeted this
rendition was hearty. A barytone solo
entitled "She Alone Charmeth My Sad
ness" wasisung by Andrew Bogart of Oak
land. - Mr. Bogart is an artist of acknowl
edged merit in the musical world. He has
a splendidly modulated voiceâ pure, clear
and sweet. Then followed Wagner's
"Lohengrin" by the orchestra a fine ren
dition of an exquisite piece of music.
The great audience was now given a real
treat in . the soprano solo, "La Parlate
d'Amor" (Gounod), by Mrs. Maude Berry
Fischer of Oakland. They encored
tbe lady to the echo. Mrs. Fischer has a
voice of remarkable, flexibility < and won
derfully sympathetic quality. >.
The "Hindoo Song," a contralto solo by
Mrs. Charles Dickman of Oakland, was de
lightful, ana was greeted with an encore.
Mrs. Dicknfan is known and esteemed
among vocalists of San Francisco, Oak
land, San Jose and other towns and cities
of California. Her voice is noted for its
purity, depth and sweetness.
The soloists were . all fairly over
whelmed with basket bouquets of elab
orate design. .'_.â â¢ 9
Mendelssohn's "He Is Watching Over
Israel" was a magnificent rendition by the
full chorus and orchestra. : Following was
an intermezzo and minuet from the Sec
ond Arlesienne Suite, Bizet, the harp obli
gato being by Mrs. F. C. Gottschalk of this
city. "My Dreams," Tosti, by Mr. Bo
gart, brought forth â  prolonged and deter
mined applause.
ft was a happy thought when Mrs. Dick
man and Mrs. Fischer were associated in a
duet. It . was "Madragal," by E. Meyer
Helmund. The blended sweetness of these
two voices afforded such an inspiration as
one seldom hears.
And it was fitting that this splendid
musical treat should clo.-e with : the Na
tional ; hymn "America," the audience
rising and joining; in the chorus in a vol
ume of tremendous fervor and patriotism.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.

MURDERER HOLMES.
His Attorney Still Scheming to Swindle
the Gallows.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 22.âLaw
yer Samuel P. Rotan, who defended H. H.
Holmes, the convicted murderer of Benja
min F. Pietzel, to-day admitted that he
and Attorney McCaffrey of this city had
wired Coroner Caster of Indianapolis to
come to Philadelphia. The Coroner, who
is said to have received $75 to pay his ex
penses, will bring all the evidence in the
inquest on the death of young Howard
Pietzel, tne son of the man whom Holmes
is alleged to have killed. The boy is also
an alleged victim of the murderer. This
testimony is in connection with the effort
that will be made to have Holmes' death
sentence commuted to imprisonment for
life, but what particular part it will play
has not been learned. Assistant District
Attorney Barlow read of the proposed
visit of Coroner Caster with evident sur
prise. "Whatever the game is," he said,
"it is too late. Ido not aticipate any fur
ther bother about Holmes."

ley identified the clothing of the mur
dered girl. Mrs. Mabel Stanley of Grecn

of Dr. Caruthers, who conducted the post
mortem, and stated in his' opinion that
the girl had been beheaded while yet alive.

STANFORD'S ATHLETES.
Wearers of the Cardinal Expect to Give
Berkeley a Chase. i'A^A:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
22. Track Manager Brown, when asked
about Stanford's prospects in the coming
intercollegiate field contests next Satur
day, stated that he had great confidence in
Stanford's athletes this year, but hardly
hoped for a victory.
"All the men are hard workers," said
he, "but, though they have trained con
scientiously, a few are not in the condition
I had hoped to have them for Saturday's
meet. This will, however, be the greatest
intercollegiate athletic event of its kind
ever held on the coast, and I miss my
guess if several records are not broken.
All other field days this year will be small
affairs â mere side compared to
this annual competition between Berkeley
and Stanford."
If the weather is pleasant a large crowd
of enthusiasts will go up from here to
cheer on their representatives. It was
estimated to-day 'that 200 Stanford stu
dents : would be on hand to witness the
events.
Toney will have an easy time in the
hurdles, it is believed, but were he out of
them the contest would be very close.
The 100-yard dash will be one of the pret
tiest races of the day and Stanford should
make a fine showing in that event. The
pole vaitlt will also be interesting, and if
Dole's bruised heel permits he will prob
ably break the coast record in that event.
The shot-put record should go by the board
and possibly that for the mile run. With
her crack riders in the bicycle race Berke
ley should have this event, but not with
out a very pretty ride. ,
â  From now on 'the Stanford trackmen will
do no work on the field or track, but con
fine themselves to light gymnasium work
to keep in condition. A professional rub
ber has the men in charge, and everything
possible will be done toward putting them
at their best before Saturday. S The train
ing table has been running for two weeks
and will be continued up to the day when
Stanford sends forth ' her twenty-five
athletes to battle on track and field with
ber adversary.

Senate to-day petitions â¢ from Baptist
churches, in relation to the arrest of
Bishop Diaz, a naturalized American citi
zen, by the Spanish authorities in Cuba,
were presented by half a dozen Senators
and referred, and a resolution requesting
information on the same subject from the
State Department was offered by Bacon
(D.) of Georgia and agreed to.
. A Senate bill authorizing the Secretary
of the Treasury to proviae for the safety of
passengers on excursion steamers, and
oarsmen taking part in regattas, amateurs
or professionals, in, navigable waters, by
detailing revenue cutters to enforce such
rules and regulations as may be adopted
to insure safety, was passed.
Sherman (R.) of Ohio, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, offered
a resolution for the appointment of a com
mittee of five Senators to proceed to
Alaska after tbe adjournment of Congress
and to inquire and report on the condition
of the fishery industry, the condition of
the fur seal fisheries and the measures
that should be adopted to promote the
progress and development of the people of
Alaska. The resolution was referred.
Mitchell (R.) of Oregon addressed the
Senate in favor of a bill introduced by
him and reported back favorably from the
Committee on Pensions extending tbe act
of July 27, 1892, which grants pensions to
the survivors of the Black Hawk, Creek,
Seminole and Cherokee Indian wars to the
survivors of those who served in various
other wars from 1817 to 1856. The bill also
includes the widows of j survivors. The
estimated number of beneficiaries under

The Indian appropriation bill was taken
up and the question of sectarian schools
for Indian children was discussed for a
couple of hours. It ended in the adoption
of the amendment offered by Cockrell of
Missouri, the bill as it came from the
House appropriating $I,l3s,oooâ increased
by the Senate to $1,335,000 â for support of
day and industrial schools for \ Indian
children. This appropriation was accom
panied, however, by a provision absolutely
prohibiting future payment for education
of Indian children in sectarian schools.
Cockrell' amendment was a substitute
for the provision declaring that it. is "the
settled policy of the Government to make
no appropriations whatever for the educa
tion of Indian children in any sectarian
school, just as soon as it is possible for
provision to be made for their education
otherwise."

Provisions of the General Pension Bill
Explained by Pickler.
WASHINGTON, D. 0.. April 22.â The"
House to-day, in committee of the whole
entered upon tbe consideration of the gen
eral pension bill reported from the Com
mittee on Invalid Pensions. ; Its pro
visions were explained at length by Pick
ler, chairman of the committee, who occu
pied two hours and a half in makintr his
speech.
The intent of the bill, he said, was to fix
and determine certain controverted ques
tions which had arisen in the administra
tion of the Pension Bureau; so as to pre
vent Secretaries of the Interior and Pen
sion Commissioners from undoing the
work and reversing the rulings of their
predecessors.
The debate is likely to continue through
out the week. ;;
When the House met the first order of
business was a vote on the resolution de
claring Albert L. Goodwin (Pop.) to have
been elected Representative from the Fifth
District of Alabama and r entitled to the

WILL NOT COME UP.
An Entire Change Programme Reported
in Regard to the Pacific
. Railroads Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 22.â The
Star to-night says: "It is understood to
day that there has been an entire change
of programme in the Pacific railroads bill.
The first of the week it was given out that
Speaker Reed had consented to give the
committee all' the-; time it wanted. It is
said now, and on good authority, that
friends of the bill have found that the op
position to it is so strong that it will not
do to call it up at this session. Several
Representatives who approached Speaker
Reed to-day to ask for time to speak on
the matter were told that it was* not
thought that the bill would come up."
. The foregoing is given for what it is
worth. It is the understanding of The
Call correspondent that all parties are at
sea and that Speaker Reed has as yet
given no intimation of his intention.

INTERESTS THE COAST.
Appropriation for the Protection
of the Sacramento and
Feather Rivers.
Tirey L. Ford Is Highly Pleased With
the Senate Commerce Com
mittee's Action.
WASHINGTON, D. <?., April 22. -The
Senate Committee on Commerce to-day
adopted the following language for the
item in the river and harbor bill covering
an appropriation of $250,000 for restraining
barriers, viz. :
For the construction of restraining barriers
for the protection of the Sacramento and
Feather rivers, in California, $250,000, such
restraining barriers to be constructed under
the direction of the Secretary of War in ac
cordance with the resolutions of the California
Debris Commission as contained in executive
document No. 16 (11. R.), Fifty-third Congress,
second session, pursuant to the provisions of
and for the purposes set forth in see*
tion 25 of the act of Congress of
the United States, entitled, "An act to
create the California Debris Commission and
regulate hydraulic mining in the State of Cali
fornia," approved . March 1, 1893; provided
that the Treasurer of the United States be and
he is hereby authorized to receive from the
Estate of California, through the Debris Com
missioner of said State, or any other officer
thereunto authorized, any and all sums of
money that have been or may hereby be appro
priated by said State for the purposes herein
set forth, and said sums when so received are
hereby appropriated for the purposes above
named, to be expended in the manner above
provided. . ..*,:; v_ ;
Referring to the action of the Senate
Commerce Committee Tirey L. Ford said
to-day : '"The item as it vow stands is the
result of much careful thought and study.
The changes made by the Senate commit
tee are intended to more carefully guard
valley interests and bring State and Fed
eral acts more in < harmony. j Every safe
guard that could be thought of has been
placed around the appropriation, and it is
not now seen how any one can object
to j it.* _ I ! endeavored to have another
chance made striking out the words 'Sac
ramento and Feather' and inserting the
word 'navigable,' in accordance with an
opinion rendered by Messrs. de Haven,
Carpenter and Wright, but some of our
delegation objected to it and it was not
further urged. The House will doubtless
agree to the Senate changes and a much
needed work will thus soon be begun
under the supervision of Government en
gineers."

Joy's Sarsaparilla Will Cleanse the Blood
MR. T. STACKE. .
" Mr. T. Stacke lives at the Santa Rosa
Hotel, corner Fourth and San Pedro streets,
Los Angeles, Cal. He ' has used several
bottles of the native sarsaparilla, and is
now convinced Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla is best, "for," said he, "when I be-
gan using the Sarsaparilla I had a desire
to rest all the time. My blood was . dis-
ordered, my tongue coated. At times,
just for a moment, my head swam ; I was
not the least bit dizzy. I knew my needs
and determined to use a bottle of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I easily procured
the first bottle, and after using for six days
felt better in every way. When I bought
the second bottle I had a little trouble in
getting it. The drug clerk tried to talk me
into using something else. I knew what I
wanted and insisted on getting Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. I am heartily
glad I bought the remedy and will gladly
recommend it to any one. Joy's is cer-
tainly fine."
Many persons write complaining that
they ask their druggist for Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla and something else was
offered. Be sure you get Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla and nothing else.

ERIE MEDICAL CO., Buffalo, N.Y.BLAINE'S MANTLE
FALLS UPON HEED
Chicago Followers of the
Dead Statesman Roused
to Action.
AN OLD CLUB'S ACTIVITY
The Maine Candidate an Ideal
American and Foremost
Republican.
M'KINLEY METHODS CRITICIZED
The Organization Will Go to St. Louis
in a Body to Boom the
Speaker.
CHICAGO. 111., April 22.â The Chicago
Blame Club, which has been quiescent
since the Maine statesman passed away,
sprang into the political and Presidential
arena at a meeting to-night, when the
mantle of the Plumed Knight was trans
ferred to the shoulders of the Maine can
didate for the Presidency â Thomas B.
Reed. By formal resolution and in many
eulogistic speeches he was indorsed unani
mously as the proper legatee of the club.
The resolutions declared it to be the sense
of the club that its choice should fall on a
candidate who best represented the Re
publican party on all principles for which
it stood and all issues which it must meet
in the future. No candidate presented a
clearer and more thoroughly Republican
record than Speaker Reed ; the passage of
the McKinley law became possible by the
ruling of the Speaker as to counting a
quorum.
On the monetary problem it was de
clared that Mr. Reed had always been op
posed to the free coinage of silver. He
was the ideal American, the ideal candi
date for the Presidency. Some of the
speeches were decidedly anti-McKinley in
tone, and Secretary Teed in particular de
nounced the insinuation of an afternoon
paper that the Blame Club was dead as
being "in keeping with the tactics of the
McKinley organs in Chicago, with their
deliberate intention to deceive the public,
to claim everything and admit nothing."
He declared that there was a Reed senti
ment and anti-McKinley sentiment in
Chicago that would surprise Republicans.
The club will go to St. .Louis in a body to
boom Reed.
NEBRASKA SILVER DEMOCRATS.
The Free- Coinage Wing of the Party in
State Convention. ..
LINCOLN, Nebe., April 22.â silver
had its inning in Nebraska to-day, and at
- the same time the machinery was started
for at least one contest for seats in the
Chicago National Convention, inasmuch
as the State Convention of to-day, com
posed entirely of the free-coinage wing of
Nebraska's Democracy, is to be followed
in just a week by a meeting of the sound
money men of the party. The breach oc
curred two years ago and has been waged
bitterly since. The currency question was
the dominating feature of to-day's conven- '
tion and enthusiasm was at a high point.
With the delegates all of one mind, there
was little strife and the work was com
pleted early.
The appearance of ex-Congressman
Bryan and the mention of his name as a
Presidential possibility was the occasion
for wild cheering. The report of the com
mittee on platform was presented and
adopted without dissent. It is in part as
follows:
We, the Democrats of the State of Nebraska,
congratulate the Democrats of Massachusetts
upon the candor and frankness which charac
terized their platform utterances of yesterday.
We rejoice that they, no longer quibbling
about the ratio or holding out the delusive
hope of international co-operation, have at
last consented to submit to the people the
question whether the United States shall have
monometallism or bimetallism, whether the
American people shall deliberately adopt the
English system of finance or restore the gold
ana silver coinage of the Constitution. The
Massachusetts demand for a single gold stand
ard and for the redemption of all Government
obligations in gold alone presents the para
mount issue of the campaign, and we welcome
the contest.
We indorse the. language used by Hon. J. G.
Carlisle in 1878, when .he denounced the
"conspiracy" to destroy silver as a standard
money as "the most gigantic crime of this or
any other age," and we agree with him in; the
declaration then made that "the consumma
tion of such a scheme would ultimately entail
more misery upon the human race than all
the wars, pestilences and famines that have
ever occurred in the history of the world.'.' We
are not willing to be parties to such a crime,
and in order to undo the wrong already done
and to prevent a further rise in the purchas
ing power of the dollar, we favor the imme
diate restoration of the free and unlimited
coinage of gold and silver at the present legal
ratio of I<> to 1, as its coinage existed prior to
1873, without waiting for the aid or consent of
any other nation, such gold and silver to be
full legal tender for all debts, public and pri
vate. . ': * â ..*"â â 'â 
We are opposed to the retirement of the
greenback and demand that the Secretary of the
Treasury, instead of issuing interest-bearing
bonds for the purchase of gold, shall recognize
silver as money ot redemption and exercise
the right to redeem greenbacks, treasury notes
and all other coin obligations in silver when
silver is more convenient.
The resolutions declare for a tariff . for
revenue only on income tax; election of
United States Senators by direct vote and
in opposition to A. P. A. methods.
Just before the convention adjourned a
resolution was introduced instructing the
delegates to support W. J. Bryan for Presi
dent. Mr. Bryan protested, inasmuch as
it would virtually bar bim from acting as a
delegate and at his earnest solicitation the
resolution was withdrawn. . ;
" To-night Governor Stone of Missouri
addressed the delegates and spectators.
CONNECTICUT REPUBLICANS.
Declare for a . Geld Standard, Protection
and the Monroe Doctrine.
MONTGOMERY, Ala., April 22. -The
Democratic State Convention reassembled
this morning, when the committee on
resolutions presented a majority and mi
nority report on platform. The ; majority
report was an unequivocal declaration for
free silver. The minority report indorsed
President Cleveland's advocacy .of sound
money and opposition to free coinage.
The minority report was taMed by a vote
of 331 to 173 and the free coinage majority
report was adopted. A resolution , was
passed approving President Cleveland's
foreign . policy and expressin_ â¢ gratitude
for his appointments, but disapproving of
his financial policy.
Joseph F. Johnston was nominated for
Governor by a vote of 356 to 148. ..

-IOWA POPULISTS.
Money .Will Be the Only Issue of the
Party in the Campaign.'-. '?
, DES , MOINES, lowa. April 22.â The
Populists of lowa held ' the largest State
convention they ever held, to-day, to name
delegates to the St. Louis convention.
There were over 600 delegates in attend
ance ' and ' nearly every county was repre
sen ted. General v' J. B. Weaver was tem
porary chairman, and in -an unusually
strong speech, for _ him, said the present
was the opportunity for the Populist party
to make itself an element in National af
fairs, when the I Democratic party is losing
ground. y *. . â .â ..-..-. â .",.. At -.
General Coxey of Ohio * and National
Chairman Taubeneck of Illinois were on
the platform, and made speeches declar
ing the time had come for Populism to as
sert itself. They urged concentration of
effort on the : money question. The com
mittee on resolutions presented a majority
and minority report. The majority was as
follows :
Resolved, That the delegates to the St. Louis
convention be instructed to do all in their
power to secure a union of the reform forces \
on a common ticket and a platform embodying j
all fundamental principles of the Omaha plat
form, with a further resolution favoring the
initiative and referendum.
The minority reported:
We favor the adoption of the Omaha plat
form in full, with initiative and referendum
added, y * V**y -t . * :
The fight on platform was long and
vigorous. Weaver and his followers wanted
to unload the Omaha platform by the ma
jority resolution because it had too many
things in it and drove away more people
than it brought into the party. The
minority opposed this and was defeated
overwhelmingly. The majority victory
means that lowa will favor making money
the only issue of the campaign and plat
form.
TENNESSEE REPUBLICANS.
Delegates to the National Convention Are
Pledged to McKinley. ?'y '.
NASHVILLE, Term., April 22.â The
State Republican Convention met here
to-day in the hall of the House of Repre
sentatives. It was one of the largest con
ventions in the history of the party in this
State, and a great deal of enthusiasm was
manifested. The McKinley men were
largely in the majority, but Reed and the
other candidates had a respectable follow
ing. The fight was over the selection of
one of the delegates-at-large, B. Sanford,
who was opposed because of his anti-Mc-
Kinlev sentiments.
A compromise was finally effected which
resulted in the election of Sanford by ac
clamation, after he had pledged himself to
carry out the instructions of the conven
tion and vote for McKinley. The other
delegates were H. Clay Evans, Ernest
Caldwell and James Jefferies. Thea can
didates for the Chancery Court of Appeals
were nominated. ".;->.' --V . â¢ â â 
The platform adopted believes in an ad
justment of the tariff duties for the pur
pose of meeting the requirements of the
Government and lurnishing adequate pro
tection to American industries, renews al
legiance to the doctrine of reciprocity and
unalterably opposes the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver at the
ratio of 16 to 1.
McKinley was indorsed for President
and the delegates to the convention were
instructed to co-operate with the friends
of the Ohio man in the temporary and
permanent organization of the National
Convention, and to vote for a McKinley
man as a member of the committee on
credentials from Tennessee.
H. Clay Evans was indorsed for Vice-
President and the delegates were in
structed to use every honorable means to
secure his nomination.

BALTIMORE, Mo., April 22.â The Re
publican State Convention 1 to elect four
delegates-at-larce and two alternates to
the convention at St. Louis met at 12:45
o'clock this afternoon. A. P. Barnes of
Worcester County was unanimously se
lected as temporary chairman. In a short
address he mentioned the names of Mc-'
Kinley and Reed, the first name being
cheered by a vast majority of the auditors,
while Reed's name was also moderately
applauded. â -' Z^^A^^^-yy-^-y-^-A-'Ay
Following the appointments of the usual
committees, and before the committees had
retired, two resolutions were sent to the
stage, and by consent read before being re
ferred. They both strongly -recommended
the nomination of McKinley and were
loudly cheered. Jr *."\ A'yyy.
Attorney-General Harry M. Clabaugh
was elected permanent chairman and
made a brief address, in which he ex
pressed the belief that any man nomi
nated at St. Louis who believes in the gold
standard and protection to American in
dustries and labor will receive the eight
electoral votes of Maryland.
The platform adopted declares a belief
in the gold standard upon which to base
our circulating medium, and opposition to
free and unlimited coinage of silver until
an international agreement of the impor
tant commercial countries of the world
shall give silver a larger use.
An effort to instruct for McKinley was

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23. 1896.
STOCKTON'S WAR
OF THE ROSES
Carnival Crowds Attacked
by Girls Armed With
: Flowers.
A BLOODLESS BATTLE.
The Floor of the Big Pavilion
Covered With Vari-Colored
Ammunition.
TINY CHARIOTEERS PARADE.
Little Tots Dressed as Romans Ride
in Floral Vehicles Drawn by
Knights in â¢ Helmets.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 22.â There was
a much larger crowd at the floral carnival
to-night than witnessed the scene .at the
agricultural pavilion last night, and on
the lower floor there was not' standing
room outside the ropes ot evergreen that
separated the throng from the partici
pants. Wherever it was possible fresh
flowers had taken the place of those used
for decoration last evening, and the entire
building was once more a blaze of bloom.
The young ladies who participated last
night in the floral march repeated that
feature of the fete to-night. Queen Flora
once more led her retinue about the build
ing, and the Queen of Roses put her 300
pretty maidens through their evolutions
amid rounds of applause. The march
closed with a shower ol roses. All of the
300 and odd misses besides being bedecked
with these flowers carried baskets and
bouquets of the beautiful blossoms, which
they threw high in the air as the march
ended, making a veritable cascade of
multi-colored buds and blossoms descend
ing on the heads of the people.
The prettiest part of the programme to
night was the chariot race. Two chariots,
one made entirely of red and yellow roses
and the other of pink and white roses,
were each draw by four little boys dressed
in Roman costumes and garlanded with
roses. Each chariot was preceded by a
band of little fellows in pink tights and
shining helmets and the charioteers were
little girlsâ one the daughter of Henry
Adams and the other the daughter of W.
W. Westbay.
As the floral chariots were drawn about
the racecourse formed by a ring of beautiful
girls, all dressed in rose-trimmed gowns,
they were greeted by thunderous plaudits.
Around and around the big building they
went and as they passed showers of roses
fell upon them from all sides.
Later in the evening the battle of roses
was fought until the floor of tne immense
structure was packed deep with beautiful
petals. It was finally cleared and the
pleasures of the dance were enjoyed until
midnight. A special musicial programme
had been arranged and the closing night
of the carnival proved to be more enjoy
able than the first.
The Native Daughters have received
congratulations on all sides for the success
of their carnival and are so encouraged
that they have already decided to give one
on a grander scale next year.
POR A DUNKARD COLONY.
Eastern Farmers Arranging to Settle
Near Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 22.â An organ
ization is being formed among the farmers
of the southeastern part of San Joaquin
County, or more properly speaking, among
those owning land which is subject to ir
rigation from the Stanislaus and San Joa
quin Water Company's ditch, which is to
be known a land co-operative union. The
object of the association is to promote im
migration. The projectors of the scheme
are the Rev. Mr. Harrison, the pastor, of
the Dunkard church at Lathrop, and a
Mr. Lacy, who has recently come out
from the East. Mr. Harrison has been
here since last September, during which
time he has acted in his clerical capacity.
It is their intention to establish a colony
of Dunkards near J_athrop, provided a sat
isfactory land deal can be effected. Mr.
Lacy expects to leave for . the East next
Saturday and he wants to receive a definite
proposition to take back to his people by
that time. The meeting last night was at
tended by a dozen or more farmers and a
great deal of enthusiasm was shown in
the enterprise.

SANTA ANA, Cal., April 22.â Julian
Berdugo, charged with the murder of his
cousin, Jose Sepulveda, here on February
17 last; was to-day found t guilty of murder

TA COMA LIBEL SUIT.
Action Brought by the Government
Against the Steamship Transit.
TACOMA, Wash., ; April 22.â W. H.
Brinker, United States , District Attorney,
on behalf of the Government has com
menced an action for libel against the Nor
wegian steamship . Transit, now lying at
the Eureka dock. . .
The action is brought because of alleged
negligence and want" of skill on i the part
of the officers of the Transit, by which she
collided with the cruiser Monterey when
the latter was lying at anchor' in Elliot
Bay, on April 12. The collision caused
considerable damage to the Monterey,
necessitating repairs which, the complaint
alleges, will cost $3000. This the Govern
ment wants the Transit to pay.
THE WOODLAND HEARING
Shepherd and Collum's Attorney
Attempts to Impeach a
Witness.
Night Watchman Shirley Admits That
He Led a Double Life at
Cacheville.
WOODLAND, Cal., April 22.â The court
room was crowded to standing-room to
day at the preliminary examination of
Shepherd and Collum, charged with arson.
The principal witness was Night Watch
man Shirley of the woolen-mills, who
made the deposition resulting in the ar
rest of the owners of the burned property.
In that deposition Shirley alleged, that the
two had purchased his secrecy after vainly
endeavoring to bribe him to assist them in
destroying the woolen-mills.
"HOw long have you been in California,
Mr. Shirley?" was the first question on
cross-examination.
"Four years," responded the witness.
"Were you ever in Cacheville?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you ever go by the name of Cor
nelius while in Cacheville and pass as the
brother of Mrs. Cornelius' husband?"
"Yes, sir." ây^ v y v!
When Attorney Clark resumed the cross
examination his questions indicated that
he had a theory that Shirley passed under
an assumed name and was introduced to
the people of Cacheville as a brother of
Mrs. Cornelius' husband, that he might
be in a position to collect the woman's life
insurance in the event of her death, she

"Mrs. Cornelius was very sick, and they
said that I looked like her brother-in-law,
and that if I would represent myself as
such it would help to pacify her during her

She is 1 a petite brunette, and the fellow
with whom she ran away is a rather coarse!

July from San Francisco, where his father,

financially, resides. ', A"\
O'Dell "hung around. the St. Lawrence
stables for a while, and then went into the
country. He became acquainted with Mrs.

absence of her husband, had gone to
Angels Camp to ; work. The erring pair
came to Stockton, accompanied by a lady
friend of â¢; the wife, and while here they
made arrangements to elope. A few days

Grand-Jury Expert Halsey
Assails n the * County
Supervisors.
ILLEGAL ACTS CHARGED.
Alleges That They Allowed
Sums on Contracts in 1 Ex
cess of the Bids.
DEMANDS AN IMPEACHMENT.
Chairman Greeninger Says the Re
â  jecting of a Claim Caused
Halsey's Action.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 22.â Edward
Halsey, expert for the Grand Jury of 1895
--96, filed an accusation to-day against Su
pervisors S. F. Ayer, A. Greeninger,
George Elmer Rea and John Roll, and asks
that they be impeached. He accuses the
officials of illegally auditing claims and
allowing sums on contracts in excess of
bids. An order was issued by Judge Lori
gan citing the accused Supervisors to ap
pear on May Ito answer the charges. A.
Greeninger, chairman of the Board of Su
pervisors, stated in an interview that the
transactions of which Halsey complains
were thoroughly investigated by the last
Grand Jury, and the board was sustained
in every instance.
"The charges made by Halsey are
actuated by malice," said he. "He pre
sented a claim of $250 for services rendered
the Grand Jury, part of which sum was
itemized as being due for legal services.
As we have no power to allow a claim for
legal services we laid tbe bill over for fur
ther consideration. This incensed Halsey,
who wanted the bill allowed immediately.
That is not his only fancied grievance.
He has been endeavoring for over a year
to get the board to adopt an index, which
he claims as his own. The index is so
complicated that no one but an expert can
understand it, and its adoption would
cost the county about $1000," as
all entries in the Hall of Records
would have to be re-entered. We could
see no benefit to the county, and theie
fore refused to accept it. ' If we had
thought Mr. Halsey's interests superior to
those of the county there would have been
no charges.'* "_;V.Vv
Supervisor J. S. Selby is not included in
the accusation. When asked why he had
omitted one member of the board Halsey
replied that that was his business. The
truth of the matter is that Selby made a
motion that Halsey's claim be allowed,
but the motion received no second.
SEATTLE DIVORCE CASE
Ex-Mayor Ronald Comes to the
Aid of Accused Mrs.
Dawson. ,
Sarcastic Questions Put to Two Wit
, nesses Who Deposed in the
Husband's Favor.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22.â The Daw
son divorce scandal will come up for final
hearing in Judge Hume's court within the
next thirty days, and the attorneys in the
case are just now trying to get ahead of
each other in the matter of gathering evi
dence and obtaining depositions. .; i;\ : <
Yesterday the . former nurse of Mrs.
Dawson made a statement in Dr. Daw
son's favor, and this morning Will H.
Thompson and ex-Mayor J. TÂ« Ronald
filed a number of cross-interrogatories ad
dressed to George ; P. Kinsey and his wife,
who live in California, and who are against
Mrs. Dawson in the present case. Thomp
son and Ronald wax sarcastic in asking
the two witnesses questions, and they
make it a point to score the husband.
The latter has stated that Mrs. Dawson
on her visit to California had shocked him
on * a number of occasions when he met
her in the presence of his wife. Thomp
son and Ronald go on tbe assumption that
Kinsey is one, of those men who is easily
shocked. They also put some questions
to.Mrs. Kinsey which will likely make her
blush before she gives the Commissioner
an answer fo them. . -
An .attempt, was made to show that
Kinsey had . some personal spite against
Mrs. Dawson. "Are , you in the habit,"
he is asked, "of making repeated visits to
ladies whose conduct shocks and makes
! you ashamed 1"- }
The witness is asked about his having
met Mrs. Dawson in Los â¢ Angeles on the
night of the fiesta, when, while masked,
she threw her arms about his neck. "Were
you unable to extricate yourself from the
embraces of Mrs. Dawson upon the street
on the occasion testified to by you? If so,
what assistance did you procure to enable
you to break her hold upon you?" ,
The witness -is. asked if . he did not re
; ceive pay from Dr. Dawson for making the
deposition and- if he did not change his
residence after making the affidavit, be
' I cause he feared .arrest on; the charge of
I false swearing. 'He is also | asked if Mrs.
Dawson ever offered him any money to
swear in her favor. .
The interrogatories addressed to Mrs.
Kinsey, are many, and Messrs. -Thompson
and Ronald ask the witness.; many. ques
tions as to why she joined Mrs. Dawson in
so many .wicked acts when she knew them
to) be - such. r : Mrs. Kinsey ' is ; asked about
the alleged trips which she says she and
Mrs. Dawson made ,with ? two young men
at Alameda. She is asked: if she enjoyed
the trips, if she Saw anything wrong, and
if she did, why / she continued to go out
with them, as admitted by her. V /':"â ':
Mrs. .'Kinsey '. is -.' asked if Mrs. Dawson
made her a confidante and told her all her
secrets, or was > she^ reticent?- .Messrs.
Ronald and Thompson asK Mrs. Kinsey to
tell them what she means when she- says
that she was inexperienced and "assum
ing all which you have said in your affi
davit to be true,* did you not consider you
were acquiring considerable experience in
your association with Mrs. Dawson?"

every one else believed the rock to be noth
ing but "bull" quartz... From all indica
tions, if it does not prove a pocket, this is
beyond exception the greatest gold mine
in Calaveras County or the > State of Cali

pocket, but even if it is, enough gold is in
sight for a snug fortune.
PLIGHT OF A SACRAMENTO MAN.
Out of Employment, He Became a Bandit
to Find Sustenance for His
Sick Wife.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 22.â the
Callendine, Baker and Townsend robbery
case the entire day was consumed in the
taking of. the testimony of witnesses on
the part of the prosecution, and the end is
not yet. All of this testimony has been,
in the main, corroborative of confession
made by Fred Townsend, one of the par
ticipants.
The most important witness to-day was
A. McClelland, night foreman of the street
railway car barn, who not only gave a
vivid description of the robbery of the car
shops, from the moment when the masked
men stepped into the office until they left
with their loot, but also claimed to be
able to identify Call.ndine by his voice,
walk and gestures.
All the testimony so far has tended to
prove that Baker was led into the rob
bery, not only by the persuasions of Cal
lendine, but through the fact that his
young wife, whom he very evidently wor
shiped, was sick at the time, and he was
without work or means to provide for her
the common necessities of life. In his
desperation he fell. Public sympathy is
with Mrs. Batter, who is conceded by all
to be a noble little woman, loyal to her
husband in his trouble.

SAN JOSE, Cal., April 22.â Mrs. Laura
A. Bennett, a bride of less than six weeks,
swore to a complaint in Justice Dwyer's
court last evening charging her husband,
George Bennett, with felonious conduct

Mrs. Bennett told a pitiful story of de
sertion, but asserted that if her husband
would only return to her all would be for
given. She said tnat Per husband had

ARRAIGNED BY WILSON.
The Commander Says Grand
Army Laws Were Violated
by the Accusers. '
PROMPT ACTION NECESSARY.
Delegates From the Oaklani Borly
Will Demand Scats in the
Convention.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., April 22.â
twenty-ninth annual encampment of the
Department of California and Nevada,
Grand Army of the Republic, began its
session at 2 o'clock this afternoon. Dur
ing this encampment the suspension of
Lyon Post of Oakland for the publication
of allegations against the Yountville
Home, without permission by competent
authority, will be considered. Lyon Post
delegates were not in the convention to-'
day. If the credential committee fails to
recognize them to-morrow they will ap-
peal to the convention.
Department Commander Wilson, refer
ring to this matter in his report, said that
on January 15, 1896, he visited the Yount
ville Home and was entertained by Com
modore D. W. C. Thompson.
"I privately conversed with many of the
inmates," ne continues, "and, in short, I
think, saw all that could be seen and ac
quired all the information that could be
obtained as to the conduct and manage
ment of the home and the treatment of
the inmates in the time occupied. I came
away fully satisfied that no institution of
the kind is or could be better managed in
relation to tbe comforts supplied to the old
soldiers there domiciled and the care of
the Lome property. This conclusion was
reached by comparison in my own mind
with soldiers' homes in other states which
I have visited. I felt that this encamp
ment was to be congratulated upon its
wisdom and good fortune in the selection
of representatives to the association.
"Subsequently charges of a serious nature
against the board of directors were made
by a post of this department, which, in
my opinion and the judgment of the coun
cil of administration, made an investiga
tion by this encampment imperative.
With that view special orders Nos. 20 and
21 were issued from department headquar
ters, constituting a committee, consisting
of Past Department Commanders Buckles
and Walling, Judge Advocate Crawford and
Comrades W. H. Pratt and William Haw
ley, to investigate the charges. The in
vestigation was held, and the findings of
the committee, embodied in its report,
will be presented for your information and
consideration. The committee is to be
commended for the faithful and intelli
gent manner in which it performed an un
pleasant duty.
"On the 19th day of February, 1896, my
attention was called to the publication in
tbe San Francisco Call of a series of reso
lutions purporting to nave been adopted
by Lyon Post No. 8 and embodying charges
of mismanagement, favoritism, misappro
priation of money, violation of the by-laws
of the association and drunkenness on the
part of the board of directors of. the Veter
ans' Home at Yountville. I will not dis
cuss, the charges' made by Lyon Post
against the board of directors of the Veter
ans' Home except to say that whether the
allegations were true or false their publi
cation (irrespective of printing in the
newspapers) without permission by com
petent authority was a violation both of
tho letter and spirit of Grand Army law,
and in view of the fact that a majority of
the men whose reputation for honesty,
integrity and sobriety were assailed are
comrades in good standing, and consider
ing the professions of fraternity, charity
and loyalty which we make to one another
and to the world, it has seemed to me, and
I am still of the opinion that, in order to
retain for our organization the respect of
the people and to preserve its usefulness
such infractions of the letter and spirit of
the laws and principles by which we claim
to be governed demand -prompt and firm
action." .' ' â â â .-â ,-â â  â - -â¢â¢, ' 'â¢â â¢''VV;'
A matter that will be discussed by all
three of the bodies with much interest' is

STANFORD'S LAST WEEK.
Dr. Jordan to Play on First in

Game.
Freshmen Will Be Shown the Mysteries

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
April 22.â For some time pant the com-
mencement week committee has - been
arranging its programme for graduation
week, and as a result from May 22 to i 27
there will be a constant round of excite
ment and amusement. y The seniors are
bound to outdo all predecessors, and are
planhing elaborate events for the final week
of the semester. The committee which has
charge of the arrangements is composed
of N. A. Folsom (chairman), B.L. Mills,
J. E. Reynolds, W. E. Campbell, H.
Lobbe, John Gregory and Misses Kohler,
Haven, Martin and Straight. "â¢'/'>.- a' :
The festivities are to begin on- Friday,
May 22, when the customary faculty recep
tion to the seniors will be ; given at Presi
dent Jordan's residence. In the evening
there will occur the annual peace unions
of freshmen and sophomores. This ' pecu
liar ceremony takes place about blazing
bonfires and the freshmen are ; ./duly
initiated into the pleasures and mysteries
of sophomore existence.
Saturday morning will witness the great
baseball game. of the year between the
senior class nine and the faculty team.
The latter numbers among the members
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who play* a fine
first base and is also a fair pitcher. Dr.
Jordan was in times past a phenomenally
heavy batter, but when he was compelled
to use glasses it interfered with his batting
eye considerably. Professor Richardson,
head of the chemistry department, is the
catcher of the team. Once he was a star
at Lehigh. Then there is Professor An
gell, head of the psychology department,
who has played ball since he was a boy
and is undoubtedly the best man on the
team. >' Professor Fish is a good pitcher
and will probably till the box. Professor
Young is a star third baseman. This
match is always very interesting for the
students, who take pleasure in joshing
their "Profs" on this occasion.
Sunday morning will be devoted to the
baccalaurate sermon in the chapel. May
25 will be senior class day. The farce en
titled, "An Intercollegiate Affair," will be
given in the morning. This farce was one
of six offered the committee, and was
chosen as the best. The play was written
by W. H. Irwin '98. A ' prize of $25 went
to the winner. In the afternoon tbe class
will hold literary exercises and the even
ing will be devoted to the senior hop.
Alumni day falls on Tuesday, May 26,
and in the evening a grand promenade
concert will take place in the quadrangle,
which is to be illuminated for the occa
sion. The finest band on the coast will be
engaged for this affair.

Bernardo and His Mate Triumph Over
Their Fellows From Alpine
Monasteries.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 22.â The
eighth annual bench show of the Southern
California Kennel Club opened here yes
terday, with the largest exhibition of high
class canines ever shown in this section.
About 200 dogs are benched, among which
are some of the best specimen this side of
the Rockies, or, in fact, in the United
States. J. Otis Fellows of New York
officiates as judge, and his decisions so far
have given general satisfaction. About
fifty San Francisco dogs are here, and
have more than held their own with the
local entries.
Among the St. Bernards, J. G. Barker's
California Bernardo is easily the best, and
was awarded first prize in the challenge
class. * Lady Bernardo, also owned in San
Francisco, got first in the female class; J.
O. 1 Cunningham's Great Dane, Queen C,
took first in her contingent, and the same
party secured first puppy with Ivan in
dogs and Juanita in females.
Old Kioto, owned by A. B. Truman,
took the challenge pointer class, while Jap
owned by Kerckhoff of Covina captured
the open in heavyweights. Baldy, a local
dog, 'got first for : lightweight dogs. Jill.
owned 1 by *W. J. Golchi-r, was first in
heavy females, and Walker's Lassie K. of
Chino, the same in lightweights.
H. T. Payne's Countess Noble was the
only entry in the challenge class for fe
male English setters. She was given a
first. In the open-class dogs, Nim rod, a
San Francisco canine, took .the blue rib
bon, Peru second, Schlot third. Open
females brought another San Francisco
dog to . the front Silverplate, owned by
Samuel F. Hughes; Ron-ena, a local dog,
was second â â  i lake L, belonging to B. M .
Lelong of the Mills building, ban Fran
cisco, third.
Billy Coleraine captured the Irish setter

Kildare wae first in the female class. Wood
land Duke from Oakland took first in open

same place, second. Lady Etta received
first in black cocker females and Daisy

CAUSE OF THE
COLUMBIA FEUD
Dorsey and Newcomer Had
Not Prospered at
Mining.
DISPUTES OVER DEBTS.
One Wanted the Appointment
of a Receiver for Their
. Property. ;
HIS DEMAND WAS OPPOSED.
The Colonel's Attempt to Draw a
Pistol Caused His Partner to
Open Fire.
â¢ SONORA, Cal., April 22.â Coro
ner's inquest throws no new light on the
killing of Colonel Caleb T. Dorsey, and J.
T. Newcomer, the homicide, still posi
tively refuses to make a statement of any
kind regarding the cause of the killing.
W. H. Bailey gave the most important
testimony at the inquest, " Newcomer
having given. him, briefly, the reasons for
his act. . ' â â _."..';.,";;.'_""â 
"The first I knew of any trouble was
Tuesday morning between 8 and 9
o'clock," . said Bailey. "Mr. Newcomer
came to the house and turned over the
keys to his cabin to m?, saying he had
shot -Colonel Dorsey. He wanted me to
go down and take charge of the place. I
asked him bow it happened and he said
he asked the colonel to appoint a receiver
for their mine, and the colonel said he
would have gold enough to pay every
thing. Hot words followed and Dorsey
reached for his pistol, but Newcomer drew
his first and fired. He said he did not
know if he had killed Dorsey or not, but
thought that he had. He then rode away
and said that he was going to Sonora to
give himself up." y'A â : '-
Newcomer is reported as having said in
Columbia on yesterday that Dorsey ac
cused him of stealing amalgam from the
mills. He called Dorsey a liar. Dorsey
reached for his pistol, but Newcomer got
in the first shot. Dorsey's nephew, as well
as others who were at the mine at the time
of the shooting, knew of no trouble be
tween the partners. Dorsey's pistol could
not be found, although It was his custom
to carry one always. The searchers did
find cartridges on his person.
'a, Dorsey's friends attempted to bring his
body out from the mine on a mule to-day.
The mule became fretful and unmanage
able and after hard work they succeeded
in getting the body from its back, and, en
folding it in a blanket, strapped it to a
Duckboard. They are bringing i the corpse
by the wagon road via Sugar Pine, a dis
tance of thirty-five miles. It : will reach
Sonora before morning.
Colonel Dorsey was a cousin of the late
Caleb Dorsey, for many years District At
torney of this county and a prominent
mining lawyer. The Colonel was a Mason
of high rank. '"i;?-;
MISSING FROM KODIAK.
Schooner Seventy-Six and Its , Crew Be
lieved to Have Gone Down.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash.. April 22.â
The - schooner j Falcon, Captain Â« Peterson,
arrived to-day from Kodiak, Alaska, the
1400 miles being traversed in exactly seven
days steamer time. The Falcon recently
took a cargo of supplies to the station and
came to the sound for a cargo of lumber.
- .News was brought by the Falcon of the
loss of the trading schooner Seventy-six,
which left Kodiak about, four months ago,
manned by five men; for a trading cruise.
There was provisions aboard sufficient to
last only. three weeks, and as the vessel
has ' never " been reported lit iis surmised
that it was lost with all on board. y'j
The fishing ; schooner Lizzie B, which
left here a' month ago bound for Kodiak,
came back to port this morning in distress,
having run short of water and provisions
after making 250 miles against head .winds
and terrific seas. For the past: two days
there had not been a single drop of water
aboard and the men ' began showing- the
effects of it A The men will be paid off
here. y A â - ' , ;:;' ,- â

DOCKING THE MONTEREY.
Successful Event at Puget Sound Naval
Stationâ Great Enthusiasm Among
the Spectators.
SEATTLE, Wash, April 22.â The Puget
Sound naval station at Port Orchard
passed into the hands of the Federal Gov
ernment' to-day with the docking as an
official test of the harbor of the : coast de
fense vessel Monterey. The caisson was
hoisted at 8 o'clock a. M., and when the
creat warship passed through the gate at
extreme low tide the water being twenty
six feet deep over the sill at this timeâ a
mighty cheer arose from the thousand or
more persons present as the Monterey's
nose broke a beautiful blue ribbon which
was strung across as an artificial barrier.
Without a break or mishap of any kind
the vessel settled upon the blocks, and by
the noon hour she was visible from stem
to stern and exposed to view from her up
permost deck to her keel. Three great
pumps", which were Moran Bros.' make,
coula have emptied the dock within less
than two hours, but it was 2 o'clock and
after when all the water was removed, ex
posing and making prisoner, as was done
by lowering the caisson, of a million fish,
ranging in size from a light forefinger to
ten pounds in weight. The dock was in
charge to-day of Commander J. C.
Morong, commandant of the station, and
Captain Ludlow, who mastered the Monte
rey until she passed through the gate and
into the charge of Naval Constructor Bax
ter of the Mare Island Yard.
The British warship Pheasant and her
crew witnessed the docking of the Monte
rey, besides numerous smaller craft.

Chamberlain Again Warns Against In
terference in Africa, y
LONDON, England, April 22.â 1n a
speech at the Constitutional Club this
evening Right Rev.' Joseph Chamberlain,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, reiter
ated his formerly expressed views regard
ing â ; South 'â  ; African affairs. He % insisted
that Great Britain must : above fall things
prevent foreign intervention and expressed
hope that harmony would soon be restored.
In his remarks Mr. Chamberlain di
vulged nothing regarding the negotiations
now in progress. The Government, he
said, was fully alive to the , serious posi
tion resulting from the revolt in Matabele
land, but beileved that the suppression il of
the outbreak could be best achieved by.the
local forces and; therefore, unless an unex
pected emergency should ; arise he ,would
not send a large i detachment *of imperial
troops to the scene of the trouble. â

THE EXAMINER'S
NEW MANAGER
H. W. Hawley, Former
Owner of the Chicago
Times-Herald.
HEARST'S FINAL SHAKE.
Reported Sale of a Large Interest
in the Big Democratic
Paper.
THE NEWMAN HARD AT WORK
It Is Expect & That Many. Changes in
the Personnel Will Ba Made
' in a Few Days.
If the signs of the times be correct,
H. W. Hawley will be the new managing
editor of the San Francisco Examiner.
It is understood that he has purchased
'A H. W. HAWLEY. ; ; â¢ .; . *..*.,*i *â¢:,- /y-^
a large interest in the paper, and will
conduct it on the Western method.
Mr. Hawley is a successful newspaper
man. . He was formerly owner of the Den
ver Times, and was, until recently, owner,
with Mr. Kohlsaat, in the Chicago Times-
Herald.
Mr. Hawley made a good deal of money
out of the Denver Times. It is supposed
that he made considerable in Chicago,
but he says he was well enough satisfied
to sell his stock to Mr. Kohlsaat, and thus
let him have full control over the Times
and Herald as consolidated. The enter
prise seems to be doing well, he says, but
the new Chicago Democratic morning
paper, the Chronicle, is having signal suc
cess. "It is a little short on advertising,
but Mr. Seymour was telling me the other
day," said Mr. Hawley, "that he was sure
he would get a large amount the cominu
spring. I-../-.-'.,"'*
"As for the newspapers in the towns
and cities of the Middle West j those oc
cupying the evening field now have as a
rule a larger circulation, more influence
and are more profitable than the morning
papers. It is so in Minnesota, lowa and
Missouri with scarcely an exception. lam
informed it is true of many othei States.
"The reason is that most of the evening
papers have been published for 10 cents a
week. They got big circulations, and a
couple of years ago when times got hard
people who had been taking the morning
papers at a greater expense discontinued
them and took the evening paper, with per
haps a Sunday paper, and the cost of both
was less than the morning paper. This is
the case in St. Paul and Minneapolis. The
Minneapolis Journal, an evening paper,
has increased' its circulation over all of the
other Minnesota papers. In Kansas City
the Star is another illustration of an even
ing paper going to the front.
"Of course the "situation is different in
San Francisco, but this is a field that I
have looked upon ; with some interest.
President Harrison alluded to it not long
ago." v.':;;: Vy./;-/:',; .aa
, ; Mr. Hawley Is scarcely 40 years old. Â He
is tall, with dark hair and eyes, and is a
pleasing talker.
But Mr. Hawley did not talk : much last
night. He could not be found by the re
porters who were hunting for him. In
fact, there seemed to be a disposition to
keep ' all . '. the ?; details of the/-' re
ported sale a profound secret. Early in
the evening ... and for , t the past . few
days he has been in the editorial rooms of
the Examiner, familiarizing himself with
the work. ".-''â -â .. â¢.>
It is expected that within a day or two
official announcement will be made of the
changes contemplated under the new ad
ministration. , -â *''.
.â _. Ever since Mr. . Hearst purchased ; the
New York ;. Journal it has been . an open
secret that the Examiner was # for sale ; for
a million or less. y Not that : it was not a
profitable ; investment, â  but because- Mr.
Hearst â¢ preferred ;- the â â â  wider . journalistic
field of New York, and desired to devote
all his energies and capital to the Journal.
SANTA BARBARA'S AFFLICTION.
Brazilian Gypsies Terrorizing People, in
the Vicinity of the St. Vincent
Sisterhood Ranch.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal.,, April 22.â
The large party of Brazilian paupers,
which arrived in Santa Barbara ' on 'â  Mon
day "night, was compelled V. by 'Constable
Kelton to move outside the city limits last
evening, and is now quartered on the
country side in the vicinity Jof '.. the ranch
belonging to "the St. Vincent Sisterhood,
whence the women have T been ; brought
into town to prosecute their profession of
begeing. The gang, which calls itjelf a
colony, is the terror of the valley, Being
lawless and unscrupulous. .A dozen â  awe
bodied men accompany it, out they make
no effort to secure honest employment,
preferring to live on the fruit of tne
women's mendicancy. It is unsafe for
small parties of Americans to visit tne
camp, as the Brazilians are bold in their
attempts to plunder. .
An attempt was made yesterday to roD a
little San Francisco girl of the handsome
belt she wore, while dozens of visitors in
cluding the constable, were present in
camp. â .â â 'â ' â .''.'â 'â "
The officials of this county cannot under
stand how such a tribe was ever permitted
to pass Los Angeles and the customs
officers there. So far no passports have
been exhibited which would demonstrate
the rijrht of the strangers to be on Ameri
can soil. Although claiming to be Brazil
ians, the women wear Peruvian coins,
braided in their hair. ". : â â *::;'
SHRINKAGE OF DEPOSITS
Causes the American National
Bank of Denver to Close
Its Doors.
DENVER, Colo., April 22.â The failure
of the American National Bank caused a
flurry of excitement on the street this
morning. Internal dissensions, the with
drawal of $200,000 in deposits during the
past two days and failure to close up past
loans without serious loss to customers
made the closing of the bank inevitable. !
President John B. Hanna made the fol
lowing statement to-day: "Since the clos
ing of the Union National Bank last July
we have noticed a gradual loss of business,
and attribute it largely to tb,e general
stringency. This stringency manifested
itself in the difficulty of roakine collec
tions. The change in the officers of the
bank last January was the cause of much,
comment and resulted in a loss of busi
ness.
"The shrinkage of deposits and but com
paratively few customers to replenish the
loss, and the inability to . collect our bills
resulted in our inability to continue our
business. I believe the depositors will
eventually receive the entire amount due
them. We have $650,000 excess of . assets
(exceeding our capital) over our liabilities.
| The stockholders also may be assessed
I $500,000 more, if necessary, to pay the de
! positors. With this surplus I cannot see
j any loss to tbem."
I The change referred to was the consoli
! dation of the State National with the
I American National, which estranged some
j valuable customers. - C, ; :
The bank's showing to-day was as !
follows: Resources â Cash and ex- !
change, $70,300; bills receivable, $1,078,000;
stock and securities, $265,435 : real estate]
$136,590: excess on circulation, '22,000* ;
total, $1,572,325. Liabilitiesâ lndividual
deposits, $530,712; demand deposits. $28,
--; 698; time deposits, s66,297; banks, $97,024 â¢ ;
I borrowed money, $142,500; total, $865,231. '
Besides the resources of $1,572,325 shown
j above, there are $500,000 of assets in the '
j shape of notes set aside for the reduction
jof capital. Beyond this the bank owns '<
! one-fifth interest in the Strong mine at
i Cripple Creek, which was obtained through
a collection of a debt due the bank. The
; mine is a shipping property and is con- i
; sidered valuable.
President Moffat cf the First National
offered to loan the bank $300,000 upon per- I
sonal security of . the board of directors, '
but only one member consented to become j
thus responsible for his share of the loan '

DUTY OF THE TRUSTEES
The Pulpit Must Only Be Occu
pied by a Duly Accredited
Minister.
MRS. DAVIDSON IS PLEASED.
Rev. Flawith Thinks the Unfrocked
Gentleman Would Do Well to
Leave the State.
The suspension of Dr. Brown from the
Bay. Conference until such time as he can
prove his innocence is thought to practi
cally settle that gentleman's ministerial
career. True, he will in all probability
continue as pastor of the First Church for
a time, but it is generally admitted that
before many weeks he must go. }â ?â  - *' AA
The pastor himself will not acknowledge
this. He declares his absolute willingness
to rest his future in the hands of his friends.
This statement, however, seems to be based
on a knowledge of a "power behind the
throne" rather than on rules governing
congregational affairs.
Precedent points to only one course
that is, his resignation as pastor of the
First Congregational Church of San Fran
cisco. His expressed intention of allow
ing his friends to decide the issue proves
conclusively that he hurls defiance at ihe
associated churches. If the deacons and
trustees 01 the First Church determine to
stand by the twice-convicted man, then it
follows that the organization over which
he presides becomes in ecclesiastical par
lance a "tramp."
If Brown in the "hands of his friends" is
stronger than the unqualified verdict of
the Bay Conference, then it is only a ques
tion of days, and very few at that, before
such a condition prevails.
It is stated, however, on what appears
to be good authority that if Dr. Brown
persists in occupying the pulpit the
dissatisfied members will seek a legal
redress. The First Church was formally
dedicated to Congregationalism many
years ago, a board of trustees being
formed to regulate its affairs. In view of
the fact that Brown has been unfrocked
by the associated churchesâ that is, de
clared no longer a Congregational minis
terâhe has no legal right to speak from
the platform of any church dedicated to
that particular form of religion.
The courts have decided this point time
and again. Ihey have held that the power
which rave has also the power to take
away. The Bay Conference has done this
very thing. It declared that Dr. Brown is
unfit to preach Congregationalism or in
any way perform the duties devolving upon
a minister of that church. In this is in
cluded his right to perform the marriage i
ceremony.*-- '-. * '
In view, therefore, of Dr. Brown's eccle
siastical decapitation, it is thought that
the courts would sustain an .injunction
tending to prevent his further appearance
in the pulpit of . the First Church. He is
admittedly.not a Congregational-minister;
therefore, an objection in a legal way from
one member of ihe First Church, which is
held in trust for Congregationalism, would
be sustained by the courts. It is said that
if Dr. Brown attempts to preach any time
after next Sunday the courts will be ap
pealed to. '. ''.â.'
In the meantime those opposed to Dr.
Brown are playing a waiting game. They
propose that everything shall be done ac
cording to Congregational usages. They
realize that the fight is still on, more bit
ter, if possible, than ever, and as they are
slightly in the minority it is not their pur
pose to hazard anything by premature ac
tion. " - '-V
The petition requesting the trustees to
remove Dr. Brown received several new
signatures yesterday, largely from people
who have been influenced by the stunning
sentence of the conference." This petition
will be presented to the trustees to-mor
row.
"The church is declining rapidly," said
Mrs. Cooper yesterday. "Last. week the
. Sunday-school was even smaller than that
of the week before. The treasurer's report
for last Sunday week is as follows:
"Primary class. 3; intermediary, 29; Mr.
Eaton's* 9; Mr. Kimball's, 16; orchestra, 6;
teachers, 15; officers, 5; visitors, 3. Total,
96. Collection, $1 96.
"This report is distressing when it is
remembered that the attendance formerly
reached the 400 mark."
' The action of Valley Brown in threaten
ing to do bodily barm to Dr. McLean
because the latter saw proper to condemn
Dr. Brown is generally regarded as most
cowardly. No attempt has yet been made
by the pastor's friends to deny the dis
graceful scenes which occurred in the
Market-street church Tuesday night
The friends of Dr. Drown now admit
that the verdict of the council was a gen
uine surprise to the pastor. He had mar
. shaled his forces carefully, though he now
understands that friendly expressions of
sympathy, such as met him on all : sides
were really founded in pity rather than
faith.. It is well understood that Deacons
Hatch and Barnard are unalterably op
posed to the present pastor. Even Deacon
,Dexter, in spite of his frantic appeal to the
council, seems to nave undergone a slight
revulsion of feeling since the verdict.
â¢ "I am not prepared to 6ay anything at
this time," said Dexter. ."I was natur
ally surprised at the verdict, but I don't
care to say anything further than this
now."'-'.- - â¢â¢â¢â¢-;._â¢ ; \Â«;,<*
"Will you vote to retain Dr. Brown as
pastor of the First Church?" asked the re
porter. " .-*:
Well, I do not care to answer that."
replied Dexter. "I am looking into cer
tain matters, tbe result of these disclos
ures, and until these things are made clear
to me 1 don't care to commit myself."
Rev. Mr. Flawith is of the opinion that
that Dr. Brown would do himself a good
turn by leaving the State as quickly as
possible. He hints at all manner of
things, but winds up in saying nothing.
"I have a very strong notion of writing
to Dr. Brown that it would be well for
him to leave the State as quickly as pos
sible. Why? Well, -I cannot now give
my reasons for saying that, but I think he
Will understand. *_ .* * * , r .vj
. . Mr. Fi_. w t h will be remembered as one
of Dr. Brown ' 8 principal opponents during
the Herron controversy. He has also been
prominent in the fight which has finally
ended in the ministerial undoing of Brown.
Mrs. Davidson has expressed * nefself as
highly pleased with the action of the Bay
Conference. The one-time alleged black
mailer of Dr. Brown is en-aged in writing
a general resume of the case.* It is her
â¢purpose to deliver it to such of the public
as care to listen from the lecture platform
"SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER."
Devotional Exercises at the Mid
week Meeting- of the Church
Members.
-Not sensations, but songs of j praise; not
bickerings and recriminations, but words
of prayer characterized the mid-week
meeting of the Rev. Dr. Brown's fiock last
night. His people rallied round him in
the most loyal manner imaginable. Mrs.
Brown and Valentine were in the body of
the lecture-room, and near by were Dea
cons Morse, Dexter and Vasconcellos;
Waldemar F. Ohristensen, the church
clerk; Mrs. Rogers, Mrs. May Davis, At
torney Nagle, Rev. Messrs. Kimball and
Willey, beside many other pillars of the
congregation. _-. "
Every eye turned toward the platform
as the pastor took his place and opened
the prayer-meeting by announcing the
hymn, "Sweet Hour of Prayer." All the
congregation, which filled tne lecture
room, joined in the singing. y? : 'A:AA.
Dr. Brown then read, from the Gospel
the lesson of the penitent thief, his com
ments upon it b'dng very brief.
"Lord, remember me when thou comest
into thy kingdom," the words uttered by
the dying malefactor on the cross, gave the
reverend gentleman his theme. He dwelt
upon the hope which animated the man
who, though stained with many crimes,
yet had the grace of repentance.
"Remember," the pastor went on, "that
though our sins be many we yet have a
hope of peace and pardon if we will but
abandon them. The theif had barely time
to frame a vocal prayer, but the sight of a
Redeemer near him filled his soul with
hope and he cried out for a place in the
Kingdom of heaven. This blessed hope
still lives. We have a right to invoke it
and look upon it as the anchor and com
pass of our lives. And if through life this
hope has been our guiding star, then we
may await with confidence the glad sent
ence of salvation from the Savior's lips:
â¢This day thou shalt be with me in para
dise.' " ......
That was all. Only a simple, touching
commentary on a Gospel story, given by a
pastor to his people. No mention was
made of the stormy scenes during the ses
sions of the council and the Bay Confer
ence. Not a word of bitterness passed the
pastor's lips. He spoke but of pardon,
hope and peace.
After the hymn, "I Know That Thou
Canst Save Me," had been sung the Rev.
Dr. Willey led in prayer.
"Help us. O Lord," he petitioned, "to
look beyond the things of earth to those
which compass about thy throne of purity
and justice. We have loved the pastors of
this . church who are now far removed
above the sin, the strife and the confusion
of this world. Now, in this meeting set
apart for prayer, we pray for a most
abundant blessing upon the one into
whose hands thou hast committed the
spiritual guidance of this con relation.
Help him to triumph over the adversities
which have pressed so thickly about him
during his hour of trial. Grant him the
grace of fortitude and patience to sustain
him amid the difficulties which may beset
his path now or in future. Give to. the
officers of this church a wisdom more than
human, and to its members a higher
spiritual life, that this church may be re
fined and purified, even though it be so as
by tire."
"Oh, Worship the King" was sung to a
stirring hymn tune, and Deacon Morse
made a prayer. â¢;Â«
"We realize, 0 Lord," he prayed, "that
our burdened souls are passing through
deep waters. We look to thee alone for
guidance into the green pastures. To thee
we cry for the peace which thou alone
canst give. Watch over our church and
suffer it not to disappear; but let it rather
become pa light "shining *in the darkness
and a city placed upon a hilltop, which
cannot be hid. Keep and bless our pastor
and her who is the companion of his home
life, that they may both find peace and
comfort alter coming out of tribulation."
The hymn "Jesus Shall Reign" was fol
lowed by a prayer by Deacon Dexter for
union and peace between the pastor and
his people ana for a cessation of dissen
sions in the church. *' <-yAy* '
Several hundred voices sang another
hymn to the old tune of "Adeste Fideies/'
and Deacon Vasconcellos, Mr. Hill and
Mr. Cnristensen made brief prayers. The
pastor announced that, a request from an
absent member for a letter of transfer to
the Third Congregational Church of Chi
cago would be considered at the church
meeting -next week, and then he raised his
hands and blessed the people.
After the meeting Dr. Brown was sur
round' d by his parishioners and the best
fellowship seemed to prevail. He declined
to speak for publication, but greeted the
press representatives most cordially.
"You see what has been done this even
ing," was all that he would say; "and you
find me happy in my church among my
people."
Just prior to the opening .of the prayer
meeting, Deacons Morse, Vasconcellos,
Dexter and Dewing held what they
termed an V'informal" meeting in the
pastor's study. Morse, Vasconcellos and
Dewing expressed themselves as dissatis
fied with the action of the conference, and
for that reason would stand by the pastor.
Dexter refused to commit himself.
THE ACTORS` FUND ROBBED
More Charges Against W. C.
Dudley, the Missing Sec
retary of the Elks.
A Warrant Has Been Sworn Out for
His Arrest on the Charge of
Embezzlement. A,y
â¢ The San Francisco Lodge of Actors of
the Association of America have sworn
out a warrant for the arrest of W. C. Dud
ley, the, defaulting secretary of Golden
Gate Lodge; of . Elks, charging him with
having absconded with about $678, the net
proceeds of the benefit given last July to
Lodge No. 2 of the Actors' Association, of
which George Osborn is president and
E. J. Holden vice-president.
The affair was handled by W. C. Dudley,
Fred J. Butler and H. Coulter g Brinker.
After the expenses were paid $673 were
paid over to Dudley with instructions l to
place the money. in the German Bank to
the credit of the organization. The other
two trustees had perfect confidence in
Dudley's honesty and no examination of
the actor's accounts was made. - The re
cent Elk defalcations caused "them to in
vestigate and they declare now that they
learned that Dudley . had drawn all
the fund from the bank, except a solitary
$5 piece, and that he had placed the money
in the institution in his own name, proving
that as far back as- July, the date of the de
posit, he was contemplating the crime
which he is now charged with. A
It is also charged that he borrowed about
$200 from R. Harris, the proprietor of . the
Laurel Palace saloon, corner of ' Bush and
Kearny streets. ~ ?/. â¢'-*. ''â ' A A a-.
* Dudley's whereabouts are unknown. ' -

The administrators of the Fair estate are
suing Charles M. Plum, Edwin B. Mastick and
George Schocnwald, the surviving Lick trus
tees, for taxes paid on land which Fair mort
gaged to the Lick; trust for $320,000. Under

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, . THURSDAY, APRIL 23, (l 896.
NEW WESTBOUND
FREIGHT RATES.
Table Showing the Tariff
on Some of the Prin
cipal Commodities.
OLD FIGURES COMPARED
Hardware in Less Than Carload
Lots Shows an Advance of
ioo Per Cent. â¢â :Â».
IRON THE LEAST AFFECTED
It Is Expected That the Date for
Making Effective the New Rates
Will Be Fixed To-Day.
Every importer on the Pacific Coast has
been on the anxious seat since it was an
nounced that the new westbound commo
dity tariff schedule adopted at the recent
meeting of the Transcontinental Freight
rate Committee at Milwaukee meant a de
cided advance in rates. This tariff is the
most important one in its effect on the traf
fic that comes into this section of the coun
try, as nearly 80 per cent of all goods im
ported is moved under the commodity
tariff, class rates cutting but a small figure
in this branch of commerce.
It was known that these rates had been
received by the railroad people, but they
have hitherto refused to make them public
as a whole, though accommodating indi
vidual shippers by informing them in
j reference to any particular commodity.
I The Call has already given the newly
i adopted class rates, which are now the
same for both east and west bound busi
| ness. It has also given the revised east
| bound rates on the most important com-
I modities, and now herewith gives a list of
the most important revised westbound
commodity rates, with a comparison of
the rates now in force. A s a..aa
The date when these new rates will be-
I come effective will probably be determined
to-day by the executive committee of the
Transcontinental Traffic Association which
j is in session at Chicago. *
All the rates given herewith are to Cali
, fornia terminal points and are given in
! cents per 100 pounds. Where carload lots
' are not specified the rate is for less than
I carload lots. Ki<
it will be noticed that comparisons are
made only for four territories. This is due
to the fact that two new territories were
created by the recently organized Trans
continental Traffic Association that is,
the Pittsburg and Cincinnati territoriesâ
and hence no comparison with the pro
posed rates to these sections was possible.
For brevity's sake the following abbre
viations have been used in the following
table:
: C. L., carloads; N*. 0. S., not otherwise
specified; 0. R. 8., owner's risK of break
age; O. R., owner's risk; 0. R. C, owner's
risk of chafing.

R. H. McDONALD IS POOR
Though He Has No Definite

Hopes for the Best
HE HASN'T LOST HIS GRIP.
" ':â  : - "'. . ' â¢ ..â ' ..- ' \ - !
Mrs. McDonald's Illness Will Deter
-AaAA Him From Taking Any Steps â 
for the Present. , .
"I'm a poor man now, but I haven't lost
my grip." ;
Thus did Richard H. McDonald describe
his present position: as he sat yesterday
evening beside the sofa where his sick wife
lay. During Saturday, and Sunday her
joy at having her husband once more by
her side, a free man, had kept her up and
made her. seem as gay and blithesome as a
girl; but Sunday night the reaction came,
and the loving, hard-worked wife , suc
cumbed to the 'effects of two years' phy
sical exertion and mental strain. During
those two years, three times dally, in all
weathers, she had prepared her husband's
food and carried it co the jail, and served
it to him with her own hands. Incum
bered with household cares, she had been
obliged to go from place to place in all
quarters of the City in the interest of the
husband who was unable to' do his own
errands; and while her labor of love was
necessary, she never faltered. But now
that she had her husband's arm to sustain
her, her husband's feet ready to run in her
service, her long-tried strength has given
way, and she seems as helpless as a child.
"Until she gets better," continued Mr.
McDonald, "I cannot devote my attention
to business, My great object is at present
to get her on her feet to prove "that I
wish to show her some gratitude for her
unceasing devotion, which was my joy and
comfort amid scenes which 1 now shudder
to recall. If her health does not mend 1
cannot thing of entertaining any business
proposal. '
"At the same time I must take some
measures to keep the wolf from the door.
At present I am preparing a letter to my
father and he will certainly give me what
aid and advice may be necessary. I have
reason to know that he is hard pushed for
money, but if he has anything at all I
know he will strain a point for me. I have
also a few friends in town who have prom
ised to stand by me. Ido not care to men
tion any names as neither they nor. I have
formulated any plans as yet, nor. do I
know what form those plans are likely to
take. . â â¢ , â¢
"As for the banking business, I have seen
bo much of trouble and suffering during
the time I spent in it and afterward that I
hardly feel like embarking in it again. . â¢
"But Dick McDonald is not down. A
man may go through many severe trials
and see many a dark day, and yet his
spirit may remain unbroken through it
ail. I have made up my mind not to rive
up, and I will hold my own. And. thank
God, I am not alone. The kindness, tbe
offers of assistance and the assurances of
sympathy which I have received and am
continually receiving fairly overpower me.
With friends so loyal and with hopes re
vived 1 can afford to meet the future face
to face without quailing." .'
A low sigh from the sofa summoned Mr.
McDonald to his wife's side. With hands
as gentle as those of a woman he arranged
the pillows and straightened the cover
ings. A look of loving "gratitude from a
pair of heavy, tired-looking eyes was his
reward, and he was satisfied.
"I will get to work and make a name for
myself. I wiil save my wife from every
care and trouble; and' my worst and bit
terest enemies will have to acknowledge
that Dick McDonald, whom they call a
thief, a perjurer and a villain, is and
always has , been an honest man. And
then the woman who has worked herself
nearly to death for my sake may find that
she has a husband of whom no woman
under heaven need be ashamed."
And the last glance of the setting sun
saw the man whose history has been so
strangely checkered with mystery and
suffering" sitting beside his wife with her
hand in his. '
OLYMPIC CLUB ATHLETES
They Will- Not Compete in the
Annual Championship
Games.
Captain Gill Is Surprised That, the
Pacific Athletic Association Failed
to Notify Him.
"The Olympic Club will not enter a team
to compete in the so-called championship
meeting on May 2 . at . Central Park," said
Leonard Gill, the, captain of the Olympic
athletes, last evening. v ; â¢-/,*;
"I will tell you all about this affair in
very few words," continued Mr. Gill, who
looked somewhat puzzled at the action of
the Pacific Athletic Association in not
having notified him of such a meeting. Â«
"The annual championship games are
held either l in . this City jat the Olympic
grounds or in Sacramento on May 30. The
athletes of this club have always looked
forward with much interest to these games,
and it is hardly necessary for me to re
mark that they were taken by surprise when
they read recently in the Examiner that
the" contests * would be held this year at
Central Park on p May 2. I was ; asked { for
an explanation by the club members,' but
not having any notification from the Pa
cific Athletic- Association . I could not ad
vance an intelligent reply. , :>., .- : v
â¢ "A few days ago I was approached by a
representative of the Examiner who asked
me if I would help the cause along by en
tering a team to compete against the ath
letes of the Stanford and Berkeley univer
sities on May 2, and I informed the gen
tleman \ that- I would r : gladly y lend all
the assistance in my power in the interest
of general athletics, but that as the time
was too short - for â¢ our boys to train for a
meeting of this kind I could not agree' to
the proposition. I informed him that the
athletes of the Olympic Club were not in a
condition jto | enter into - contests \of I any
kind at present, and that I had more than
a passing .; interest in â â¢ the , success of , our
boys when-:- they met in competition the
athletes of other clubs. ; ;.
|"He then replied that if the Olympic Club
would join in and make the day a para
mount success by entering -a team in* the
games, the Examiner would handsomely
appreciate J and ;* return \ the \ kindness ex
tended at some; future time. ÂI J thanked
the gentleman; but you know the Olympic
Club feels proud of its athletes and would
certainly call me to task if I insisted upon
them taking part in contests they would
not stand a ghost of a chance of winning.
â¢;; "I certainly will do all in my power to
assist ,* the press '< in * every, way, but under
the present circumstances, considering the !
limited time our athletes would be 'given â¢
to train for those games, I could not give \
the : representative of \ the % Examiner an *"j
answer in the affirmative. If the games !
were postponed to May 30,. I can assure
you' that -Â» the Olympic Club 1 would' have
a ';â  strong -' team 'â : to pit ' against ' the ' crack
athletes of the universities." ' "- -" ;:'*'â¢>'
Aj Mr. Gili % cannot & understand why ; . the
Pacific Amateur r* Athletic -.Association
failed to notify, him that the champion
ships are to be held at Central Park on
May 2. Certainly the Olympic Club should
have some voice ; in - the matter, and -it is
not to be wondered at that the captain of
tbe club feels naturally indignant at i the
action of the P. A. A. A. in having failed
to notify him of the day on ; which the
games are to be held. The 1 Olympic Club
will not '.be represented at; the meeting,
excepting as spectators. y
The intercollegiate championship games
between the Stanford and Berkeley Uni
versity will be held on Saturday at the
Olympic Club grounds and an excellent
day's sport is guaranteed all lovers of good
athletics. Edgren, the famous hammer
thrower, will attempt on that day to break
all existing records 1 in hammer-throwing.
At * the 'â  Caledonia Club games, which
will be held on May 30 at Shell Mound
Park, four amateur events will figure on
the programme, viz. : One mile race, open
to high-school representatives; 300 yards,
ooen race for amateurs in ' good standing;
half-mile * race and vaulting with pole.
Handsome gold and silver, medals will be
given to the winners. , ;: _ rV y'AAli-
FOR LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE.
Resolutions by the American "Women's
League of San Francisco.
The following resolutions and preamble
have been adopted by the American
Women's Liberal League of San Francisco:
Whereas, Liberty of conscience Is a sacred
right guaranteed to all citizens by the constitu
tion and laws of the United States aud the State
of California; and whereas, the. said constitu
tion and laws enact that no religious test shall
ever be required as a qualification to office or
public trust; and whereas, the experience of
over a hundred years demonstrates that the
religious "liberty thus guaranteed the citizens
of this Republic is the corner stone of our glo
rious civilization and of our unparalleled pros
perity. Therefore, be it *.
â¢Resolved, By this meeting of American citi
zens, held under the auspices of the American
Women's Liberal League of San Francisco,
Cal.:
1. That we denounce any attempt. to array
one class of citizens against another on the
score of creed, race or color as un-American, un
republican, unrighteous and unjust, and we
appeal to all fair-minded Americans to put
upon any such attempt the stamp of disap
proval and condemnation.
2. That we condemn as violators of the or
ganic law of the Nation and as recreant to the
constitution of the State those who seek openly
or secretly to make a religious test a qualifica
tion for any office or public trust.
3. That we call the attention of ihe conven
tions of political parties to the attempts now
being made to decide the fitness of candidates
by their membership in, or their attitude to
ward, a certain religious denomination.
4. That we call on said conventions and on
all candidates for office to speak out manfully
as becomes Americans concerning this treas
onable attempt to bring to naught that pro
vision of our constitution which a century's
experience and the enltgntened judgment of
mankind pronounce to be the noblest, grand
est, best, namely: Religious Freedom.
5. That these resolutions be printed and dis
tributed by the American Women's Liberal
League. ' Susan M. Sheall, President.

FLORENCE BLITHE SUED
Attorney T. I. Bergin Begins
an Action to Recover
: $15,000.
ClainJs That the Coin Was Advanced
to Assist in Securing the
Blythe Millions.
Is the Blythe estate pressed for coin?
Attorney Bergin seems to think it is, for
he has commenced an action against Mrs.
Florence Blythe Hinckley to recover
$15,000, alleged to be due him as the result
of sundry advances made to Florence
Blythe when she needed both friends and
money.
On April 16 Attorney T. I. Bergin filed
with the County Clerk a suit for attach
ment for the above amount.. The Sheriff
so far failed to make any returns, so it is
presumed that the papers have not yet
been served.
"I don't, care to discuss this matter,"
said Mr. Bergin yesterday, "because the
papers on file tell the story. This is purely
a private affair, however, though I must
confess some surprise that it has not before
this come into the possession of the public.
"The suit is for $15,000 advanced to
Florence Blythe at various times.beginning
with her first appearance a3 a claimant for
the Blythe millions. I have demanded a
settlement many times, and have a3 often
been refused. I finally saw that the only
thing for me to do was to bring suit for the
amount. 1 have done so, and that is all
there is to the story." V

A man likes to feel so strong, so full of pent-up vitality, that

every man to be the equal of his fellow-man.
This strength is simply one element ; it is not alone mus-

SCARE IN THE BALDWIN.
Frank Brown, a - Horse-Trainer,
Has a Row With Watch
man Moore. â 
A WOMAN WAS IN THE CASE.
Brown Fires Two Shots at Moore and
Moore Retaliates With a
Slungshot.
There was a sensational scene in the
Baldwin Hotel at an early hour yesterday,
the sharp report of a pistol rousing the
guests from their slumbers.
The row was between Frank Brown, a
horse-trainer, and Charles Moore, the
night watchman. There was a woman in
the case, and Moore accused Brown of un
seemly conduct with her in the early hours
of the morning. : AA'y ;:â¢
â¢ The story is that Moore went to Brown
ana ordered him and his companion to
leave the hotel.
Hot words passed between Brown and
Moore and, according to the version of the
affair told yesterday, Brown pulled a re
volver and fired two shots at the watch
man, but his hand was unsteady and both
shots missed. Then, it is said, Moore
pulled a slungshot from his pocket and
attacked Brown furiously with it before ne
had time to fire another shot. .
The woman's screams and the report of
the shots aroused the guests and made the
night clerk and other attaches rush to the
floor where Brown's room was situated.
They were just in time to pull the two
men apart. '-'IM
Tod Sloan, the well-known jockey, and
two or three other friends of Brown got
him out of the hotel and took him in a
hack to the Receiving Hospital about 3
o'clock in the morning, where Dr. Bunnell
sewed and dressed a deep wound in his
scalp. y : jy.A: :.'â¢'-. -,'
Brown and his friends declined to give
any information as to how he received his
wound, putting off all inquiries by the re
mark that it was only a saloon row.
-Moore has lost his position as watchman
in the hotel through the fracas, but his
friends hope that he will be reinstated, as
he was, they claim, simply doing his duty
by ordering the woman out of the hotel,
and that he had a right to defend himself
against Brown's attempt upon his life.
Moore is an ex-policeman.
There has been a strong effort on the
part of the hotel people and Brown's
friends to hush the matter up, but it
leaked out last night. : ; ."; .
VISITING HOI'EL ME!..
About 400 of Them Are Expected to
Arrive in the City This Afternoon.
Manager J. O. Kirkpatrick of the Palace
Hotel returned yesterday from Southern
California, where he has been for over a
week past with the hotel men of the Na
tional Association, who are to reach here
to-day.
Mr. Kirkpatrick says the hotel men have
enjoyed themselves in a splendid way
ever since they crossed into California,
and that in all the towns they were re
ceived royally, presented, with wines,
fruits and flowers, banqueted and shown
the sights. :
"I meet* them at Barstow," said Mr.
Kirkpatrick, "and went 'with them to Los
Angeles. Pasadena, San Diego, Coronado,
Santa Monica and other places. The
banquet at Coronado was attended by. 427
people.
"There are a great many big hotel men
in the party. The cities outside of New
York are especially well represented and
New York, of course, has a good quota.
The first detachment of the hotel men will
arrive here about 1 p. m. to-morrow and
the others will follow shortly afterward.
There will be about 400 people in the party.
"The first train will have about seventy
people from New York, the second will
have 140 from Chicago and the third 120
from New England. Delegates from Colo
rado, Indiana and Ohio will arrive in
special cars probably in the meantime. _
i The tourists will visit the theaters and
Chinatown in the evening. A luncheon
at the Cliff House will be given on Friday
and that evening there will be a banquet
at the Palace. On Saturday they will go
to Palo Alto, San Jose and Monterey and
will spend Sunday at the latter place."

Smalley says we may have war with
England, but it is only a smallish scare.
There is a possibility that England may
find in Africa what Spain struck in Cuba.
The Morgan report . struck the funding

Judging from results prediction bureaus
seem to be operated very largely on the
principle of the "Weather Bureau. .
Los Angeles is as gay as if she were hav

The California miner is liable to lose
more than his name when he becomes an
Alaskan miner.
There is ahrdly likely to be a union be
tween Democrats and Populists, but there
may be a conspiracy.
The Los Angeles man finds his hat as
useful as ever to talk through, but he can
not wear it any more.
General Weyler's trocha promises to add
a word to our language even if it adds
nothing to his reputation.
The New England Democrats have been
the first of their party to get a Russell on
for a Presidential candidate.
â¢ If Senator Morgan is in search of health
he had better come to California, where
everybody is ready to pledge it.
The Call is playing no favorite at St.

California interests are at stake. - . *y- \ 1 -
As the Valley road goes forward in Cali
fornia the cinch of the Southern Pacific of
Kentucky goes steadily backward.
It is not the Hebrews only, but the peo
ple of all the world who have suffered a
loss in the death of Baron de Hirsch. ? y
Congress had better pass the appropria
tion bills and leave everything else until
after the people have spoken in November.
If Populism has the nerve to make a
straight fight this year it will come very
near wiping Democracy off the face of the
West.
Why should our delegation to the St.
Louis convention sacrifice the chance to
get a Cabinet officer for a chance to get
nothing?
The majority report of the Pacific Roads
Committee might just as well be dropped
into a waste-paper basket without any
further fuss.
If the posing of Kelly and Mahoney as
Republican leaders in the Fourth Con
gressional District were not a farce it would
be an insult.
Competition has settled the monopoly
problem in the San Joaquin and eventu
ally the same means will be used to settle
it throughout the State. '
An investigation of the bond deals may
not expose a fraud, but it will nevertheless
be worth while to lift the mask off and let
the people see what is under it.
The Senate made a good record in war
talk and ought to make a better one in
providing for coast defenses in case the
next war talk should happen to mean war.
As nearly every intelligent man in San
Francisco knows the position and condi
tion of Kelly and Mahoney it is easy to es
timate the character of those who follow
them.
The great central transcontinental road

Herr Bebel told the Reichstag the truth

The chances for Democratic success this
year are very slim, but it seems there are
quite a number of sideshow leaders in the
party who are small enough to get into
them and find themselves suited.
Holmes, the. murderer, has received
thousands of applications for his auto
graph, and some who are posted go so far
as to assert a belief that he has even broken
Paderewski's record in that respect.
Streetcars in Boston move so slowly and

The Republican party of California as
an organized body has no favorite and no
antagonist among the candidates to ap
pear , before the convention at St. Louis,
and will send there a delegation pledged
to carry the ( State for whoever is nomi
nated.
POLITICAL WISDOM.
For California to send a pledged delega
tion to the St. Louis convention would be
a political blunder. y Wisdom demands
that our delegation to that great National
gathering should be made up of strong
men unpledged, untranimeled and free. To
these conclusions nearly every Republican
has come who has given ! the subject the
consideration it deserves. 'The press has
in many instances declared it. Earnest
members of ' the party ;in '. interviews pub
lished in The Call have indorsed it.
Leaders of the party have urged it. In
fact, it may now be announced as the pre
vailing sentiment of the party throughout
the State, and there can be little doubt the
convention will act in accordance with it.
The dominant factor involved in the
question was well expressed in a commun
ication published in The Call yesterday
from General Chipman in these words:
The Pacific Coast has never received just
recognition by any administration. It is en
titled, by reason of its varied and important
industries, by reason of its location on the
map as the western entrance to our continent,
by reason of its contribution to the wealth of
the Nation and its promise of future greatness,
to a Cabinet office, at least. By wise counsels
and harmonious action I believe we can secure
this very important and very proper recogni
tion from the next administration. V.? ; l
If we instruct for A or for B, we go with our
hands tied. We sink every opportunity to
urge the cause of silver, we leave entirely to
chance the hope of obtaining a place in the
Cabinet counsels, we push aside the peculiar
wants and demands tof our region, and. we
thus declare the man to be our paramount
object and all other things subordinate.
No man, as General Chipman points out,
can at this time forecast what will be the
situation at St. Louis when the convention
assembles. If we at the State Convention
pledge our delegates to a particular man
we will be taking a leap in the dark. We
will be depriving California Republicans
of all power to take an influential part in
the deliberations of the National assembly.
The folly of such a course is now becom
ing generally recognized even by the
stanchest friends of particular candidates.
Irving M. Scott, a strone supporter of Mc-
Kinley, is in accord with the ablest advo
cates of other candidates on this point. "I
believe," he says, "that the best interests
of the State can be subserved by sending
an unpledged delegation to St. Louis."
That is the way it goes everywhere. Cali
fornians are beginning to stand up for
California. â 
FIXING FREIGHT RATES.
There is no surprise that the managers
of the San Francisco and San Joaquin Val
ley Railroad have employed an able traffic
manager and instructed him to prepare a
schedule of freight charges that will serve
to pay an income ol 6 percent on the in
vestment in the road. Still, the idea is so
novel in the conduct of railroad matters in
California that it has necessarily attracted
surprised attention. It is to be observed
that neither the competition offered by the
Southern Pacific Company nor theÂ»propo-
sition of charging "all the traffic will
bear" in those places where the competi
tion will not be encountered is cutting any
figure in the plan of the Valley road. It
is going ahead on the simple business
proposition of securing a reasonable re
turn on its investment. It is impossible
to encounter antagonism on such a basis
as that.
It may be assumed that the schedules
first put in operation will be calculated on
uncertain data and that an allowance on
the side of safety may be made on that ac
count. The managers cannot ascertain
definitely beforehand the volume of traffic
which they will obtain. They " owe it to
the shareholders and to prospective bond
purchasers to make the rates safe while
placing them below the figures to which
the shippers ' have been accustomed. As
the road is extended the amount of traffic
per mile will increase, and this will lead
to a reduction from the first rate.
After that will come a denser settlement
encouraged by the lower rates, and this
will add constantly and unceasingly to the
volume of business. The policy of operat
ing the road so as to secure only a fair
return on the investment will necessitate
steadily decreasing rates, so that the
factor operating to the development of the
section will be progressive in its tendency.
It will not be possible for the Southern
Pacific to pursue its old tactics of cutting
rates for the purpose of crushing opposi
tion. Not only is the opposition too
strong for that, but the Southern Pacific
Company's suit against the proposed
reduction ordered by the California Rail
road Commission has tied its hands. - â :,. -r
In time the Valley road will come to be
regarded as the pioneer- in a movement on
the part of capitalists to respect the grow
ing sentiment that money is entitled only
to a fair return on the amount of its invest
ment in enterprises which bear a â¢ vital
relation to the public welfare. It is the
contempt with which this just principle
has been. treated by capitalists that has
given rise to the movement for bringing
railroads, telegraphs, water supplies and
the like under government ownership. A
few such examples as that set by the
Valley road would check a movement
engendering bitterness and .threatening
vested rights.
PROTECTING INCOMES.
The operatives who assisted the Demo
cratic party to establish free trade were
persuaded to do so by the argument that
the manufacturers, not the operatives,
would receive the benefit of protection,
and that wages would.be no better under
protection than under free trade. On the
contrary, while wages would remain the
same, the cost of living would be reduced
and the lot of the workingman would be
easier. These arguments were effective
before the Gorman-Wilson tariff began to
compel many manufacturers to suspend
and others to reduce wages.
It might have been , reflected then, as it
is well understood now, that a; protection
which insures the prosperity of a manu
acturer places the power in- his hands to
raise wages, whether he exercises it or not,
and that competition waich destroys rea
sonable profits renders it impossible for a
manufacturer to increase wages; that
heavy imports induced by a low tariff
mean a large drain on the money of the
country, and that we cannot expect to live
as cheaply as the poor of Europe without
accepting the other conditions of their
lives. . . ' -
The point made with the operatives who
assisted in forcing '.-'.Wilson-Gorman
tariff on the country is now being tried on
the orange-growers 'of California. They
have been exceptionally^ prosperous this
year in spite of the competition which the
trade policy of the Democratic party
compelled them to meet, and now efforts
are being made to persuade them that
they have secured good results in' spite' of
the absence of protection. y The argument
is similar to ; that of r the worldling who
pointed to the extreme ; old age of a man
who had used, tobacco Ito excess since his
youth and sought â  to prove by this fact
that tobacco is not injurious. "Ah, but,"
replied the reformer, "how much â¢ longer
he might have lived had he never touched
tobacco lV JiÂ¥a___%__%_____^sl'* l - -. 'â ' ''".

reason that * they would â  have been much
larger had they been protected against the
cheap ' labor competition of : the Atlantic
tropics.- No sensible person is satisfied
with a good thing if by the exercise of a
little wisdom he can secure abetter thing.
Of all the producing States in the. Union
California has most reasen to uphold pro
tection. It produces a range of articles
finding no competition in this country and
produced nowhere else save in foreign
countries where wages are exceptionally
low. This is true particularly of wine, figs,
raisins, citrus fruits and prunes. There
being no home competition a protective
tariff would remove the only competition
that is possible. California ought to be the
strongest protection State in = the Union,
and it very probably will be in the next
election.
VACANT PUBLIC LANDS.
There are some things in the recently
published report of the Geological Survey
that demand attention, as they are likely
to create a damaging, erroneous opinion
concerning California. Among the inter
esting matters set forth are the following:
California has 57,737,000 acres of land still
public. Railroads . have received 0,000,000
acres, and the grants and swamp lands em*
brace 10,000,000 acres. The lands disposed of
to individuals amount to 19,000,000 acres.
The greater part of the still unoccupied 90,000
square miles of California will probably remain
in the public domain for a long time to come.
It is in the southeastern part of the State, and
includes the great Colorado Desert, Death Val
ley and similar barren regions. From there
the strip extends northward along the eastern
boundary to the lava-covered plateaus in the
northern part of the State. There are also vast
stretches of vacant land along the northern
coast ranges, north and northwest of Mount
Shasta. Much of this latter area, and also the
vacant lands along the Sierra Nevada, are for
ested and have considerable value in lumber.
AH this is well, but Mr. Newell, the ex
pert of the survey, goes further and makes
this declaration: *
The estimates of the water supply of this
State show that, while there is an excess for
the humid and sub-humid portions, there is a
great deficiency for the remainder of the
State, there . being probably not enough to
cover the lands now in private . ownership,
should these be in such position as to have
water brought upon them. It is impossible to
utilize for agriculture more than a very small
percentage of the vacant public lands, espe
cially those in the southeastern part, although
it is probable that by means of wells and stor
age reservoirs small settlements may be estab
lished at such localities that the grazing can
be used to better advantage than at present.
A more misleading statement could
hardly have been imagined, Of course,
Mr. Newell is referring to the deserts in
the southeastern part of the State, but in
making his estimates of the water supply
he completely ignores the Colorado River,
which, in view of the insignificant pre
cipitation of that region, is the only sup
ply worthy of consideration. He conse
quently fails to call attention to the fact
that the water of that stream can be turned
upon millions of acres of desert land and
would be sufficient to invest them with
the highest conditions favorable to agri
culture. Even now a strong company is at
work constructing an irrigating system
from the Colorado River for the Mojave
plains. "Pasturage" has nothing 'to do
with that scheme and is absurd to con-
sider in connection with the irrigation of
desert lands. . The moment that water is
placed on any of these lands in California
they become entirely too valuable for
pasturage. It is respectfully suggested
that there is an inviting opportunity to
revise this report. â . ' -.1. .!â --â¢ 'yr' **'
IT SIGNIFIES NOTHING;
Mr. G. W. Smalley, the American corre
spondent of the London Times, informs his'
paper and the British public that there is
a great deal of illusion in the belief that
the Venezuela question has passed beyond
the point where war between the United
States and Great Britain is probable. Mr.
Smalley is in the habit of letting an over
loaded stomach influence and direct the
flow of his gray matter, and so his alarm
just now may be attributed to no more
substantial cause than indigestible food.
The trouble with Mr. Smalley has" al
ways been that be is too much of an Eng-
American to see any good, in our
people or in our Government; besides, he
has no more facilities for obtaining inside
information at Washington than the most
obscure gatherer of news items in and
about the halls of Congress and in the de
partments, and his speculations upon com
ing events are of no value whatever as a
basis for forming opinions.
The English public, however, appears to
take Mr. Smalley's observation quite seri
ously, but all this is food for amusement
rather than alarm among our people.' The
utter absurdity of Mr. Sraalley'a alarm is
too apparent to comment upon. In the
first place, Justice Brewer's committee is
nowhere near ready to report, and until it
does report and its recommendations are
formally rejected by Lord Salisbury there
will be no occasion to talk about war. But
If the London Government should refuse
flatly to consider a settlement of the boun
dary question upon lines suggested by the
American Commission, one hundred and
one other avenues would be sought out to
lead to an amicable adjustment of the
dispute.
No, Alarmist Smalley is all wrong in his
surmises. He has ' allowed his imagina-
tion to lead him far out into the swamp of
miasmatic poison, and his thought circu
lation is woefully disturbed by unfounded
apprehension for ; English safety. There
will be no war, not even rumors of war at
all serious, until every means of reaching
a satisfactory settlement of the Venezuela
misunderstanding is entirely exhausted. ,
BARON DE HIRSOE.
Afterallit is what a man has done to
make his fellows better and happier and
to advance civilization by example along
safer and truer lines that gives j the; histo-
rian opportunity to say that , the world is

Maurice de Hirsch, who was gathered to
his. fathers yesterday, leaves more than
enough ; records of " substantial effort -; in
broadening and deepening the . ties ,"â¢ that
bind man to : man to supply the future
writer of past events with ample material
for a pen picture of ; such a man.' Baron
Hirsch was great in * simplicity of charac
ter, grand in work for the betterment of
bis people and supreme in demonstration
of love for humanity, v ' r ~'.'-'
It is said, and truthfully no doubt, that
the Baron's annual expenditure for public
charities reached; the : enormous sum ,of
115,000,000, but what the suras, were that
he gave in secret to secure joy and com
fort to men, women and children only his
God and himself ever knew. : That they
were princely, however, the world may be
assured. ,
- A Jew? Yes, Baron Hirsch was a Jew,
and not â¢ only so, but a distinguished rep
resentative of ; traits of [ Hebrew character
which are seen in the code of ethics and
jurisprudence of the world's greatest : . law
givers,' in the rhvni- of the world's great
est sacred poet, and in the lofty lessons of
the world's greatest teacher of ethics.
i But ~; Baron Hirsch, v although in â¢ high
social favor with kings and royal families,
made it the object of his life to be a manly
man, with a standard for the conduct of
his life that should not only recognize the
brotherhood of man, but demonstrate his
thorough honesty of purpose by acts that
were all in \ harmony with his ; high aim
and purpose. Yes, the world is' better "off
in every way for Baron Maurice de Hirsch

WHAT "THE CALL" DOES.
_ Seattle Argus. , . :'
The San Francisco Daily Call Is working up
an immense circulation in Seattle and vicinity.
The call prints the j news, all the news, and
puts it in such shape that it can be read. r
A HIGH-CLASS NEWSPAPER. !
Los Angeles Civic Review. *
The San Francisco Call takes rank as a high
class newspaper, for it is I making its claim
eood that "it speaks for all." 1 While it is a
stalwart Republican journal, its columns ap
pear to be always open for a fair statement of
views not in line with its own policy, and the
dishonest policy of suppressing such news as
does not suit its purpose finds no tolerance In
The Call office, if we may judge by the space
given in its columns to the news of the
People's party and of the movement for
a complete development of the silver
sentiment of the country. Moreover,
Joseph Asbury Johnson is a regular
correspondent of . The Call and his contribu
tions show that there ore '.'no strings on him"
as to what he shall write. This is a notable
departure from prevailing ; newspaper ! meth
ods and is worthy of unstinted commendation.
The Civic Review has the highest authority for
stating that it is the settled policy of The
Call to be a fair, broad-gauge, impartial news
paper, regarding that as the true province and
mission of modern high-class journalism, and
in pursuance of this policy it will give the
Populist news, reports of conventions and the
like all through the campaign, . no matter
how hot the battle maybe. As no other news
paper has done so or proposes to do so, and as
the news service of The Call, that of the
United Press agency, is in many respects
superior, and in every way equal, to any other
news service. It should be the pleasure, as it is
the duty, of the Populists of California to sub
scribe for The Call in preference to any of the
other San Francisco dailies, the contributions
of Mr. Johnson alone offering a sufficient in
ducement to Populists and silver men for
giving The Call the preference, for he is, as
our readers know, not only a trained editorial
writer of far more than average ability, but a
tried and true Populist and a recognized leader
in the movement for a union of reform forces
in 1896. A.-y-^A- â

And then methougbt 1 heard his voice
A-singlng as he came,
lie lightly thrummed a mandolin.
.. Its tones right cheerily rang,
Like raindrops pattering on the eaves,
And this is what he sang:
"Heigho ! Demoiselle Daisy, . ,

Heigho! grasses and leaflets,
Hear you my tender call?
Heigho! come, pretty Mayflower,
You are the shyest of all.
Heyday, come, Pussy- Willow,
Wrapped in your hood of fur. ;

To wake a hundred dames.

"I fain wouid learn your power."

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
Frau Clara Schumann is reported to be dying
from a stroke of apoplexy. The great pianiste
is one of the noblest women that have ever
adorned the musical profession, and her loss
will be deeply deplored, not only at Frankfort
on-the-Main, where she has resided since 1878,
but also wherever the music of Robert Schu
mann is appreciated and loved. The history of
Clara's life, and her wifely devotion to her
unfortunate husband are almost too' well
known to need repetition. She was the
daughter of â¢.. Professor Wieck, who abso
lutely refused to countenance the dreamy,
romantic â  Robert Schumann as a proba
ble son-in-law, though he had been so
impressed by the talent of Schumann that he
himself, had advised him to take up music as a
career. The young people finally married in
spite of the professor. " After poor Schumann's
insanity and death, Clara devoted her talents
to making his works known and appreciated by
the public, and his popularity to-day is largely
due to her brilliant and sympathetic playing.
Since 1878, when Mme. Schumann took up her

It seems to be settled that Mapleson will be
heard from a good deal* in American operatic
circles next season. He has made himself
very. conspicuous lately in England in connec
tion with his Imperial J Opera â  Company, for
which he proposed ,to build an opera-house.on
the site of the Haymarket Theater. "Mapleson
stated that a large amount of stock in his com
pany had been sold, and that he was quite in
a position to establish a permanent London
headquarters for his company. The Hay
market scheme is now supposed to be dropped,
but Mapleson is engaging artists in Italy.
These singers it is understood are for a season
of Italian opera which this veteran impre
sario contemplates giving at the Academy, of
Music, New York, next season. The possibility
of a tour to the Pacific Coast is also on the
tapis, for with Abbey and Grau and Walter
Damrosch's German opera season Mapleson
will find plenty of competition in the New
York field. y: ".-'"'.-"': . â -A.^'-X
Henri Murger's novel, "La Vie de Boheme,"
seems to have taken a new and sudden lease of
life in opera and drama. No sooner has Puc
cini's "Boheme" met with success than Leon
cavallo comes forward with an opera bearing
the same title and written round the same sub
ject. It is at the Lyric Theater in Milan that
the newest "Boheme" will first see the light.
In an interview Leoncavallo states that the
action of his opera will be absolutely different
from that of Puccini's, and that the music will
also bo of an entirely diverse genre from that
of his confrere. Clyde Fitch's adaptation of
"La Vie de Boneme," which is running in New
York, has proved a substantial success at the
box-office in spite of the onslaughts made by
the critics when the drama was first produced.
A very painful criminal trial is creating a
sensation in the musical world of Vienna.
The subject of it, whom the public prosecutor
accuses of perjury, is Carl Zeller, aulic coun
sellor to the Minister of Public Instruction,
director of the public department of fine arts
and a composer of very popular music. His
two operas, "The Miner" and "The Bird Mer
chant," have had almost as much success in
Vienna and Germany as the best works of
Johann Strauss or Yon Suppe. The ; trouble is
over a disputed Inheritance, and people are at
a loss to understand how Zeller could have
compromised himself by committing perjury,
particularly as the amount in litigation is
comparatively trifling. The whole sum does
not exceed $10,000, and the bulk of the suc
cession was in any case assured to the com
poser. It is hoped that | Zeller, who has fallen
seriously ill, may yet succeed in proving his
innocence. . , â '-â â -
â¢ Every day seems to add to the popularity of
Carl Goldmark'a new opera, "The Cricket on
the Hearth." The Royal Opera of Buda-Pesth
has already followed Vienna's lead in produc
ing the work, and a number of other theaters
are preparing to do likewise. The composer of
"La Relne de Saba*' and "Merlin'! has given
proof of unexpected talent for grand opera in
his "Cricket on the Hearth." Its music is sim
ple, almost popular. in regard to the melodies,
but the orchestration is spoken of as being full
of splendor and refinement. The prelude to
the third act seems to have proved as irresisti
ble as the now celebrated intermezzo in the
"Cavalleria Rusticana," for at every perform
ance it has to be repeated again and again. .
The students of the University of Bologna
have just collaborated in a rather singular
way to produce an opera. ; One of them, Ales
sahdro Tirelli,' wrote a libretto, entitled "Bom
bacina's Marriage" * (11 Matrimonio di Bom
bacina), and the most promising young com
posers among the students took different parts
of the work to set to music. Federico Buga
melll wrote the overture; the first act was the
joint production of G. Grazioli, A. Rubbi and
R. de Ma tthaeis, while Ugo Delia Noce wrote
the second act. The students \ produced \ their
operetta at the Corso Theater, and the musical
journals speak of it seriously as being quite a
clever production. ' _*_j_

LADY'S SHORT CUTAWAY JACKETS.
The jaunty models of this season are cutaway
in shape, very short with small revers. The
flaring skirt is preferred to the fan back in
these short Jackets. Narrow belts are much
worn slipped' through the . under-arm seam or
the dart, leaving the front free. "
Made of plain colors,'. such as brown, tan,
black and blue, serviceable garment to wear
with any skirt is gained. V .- *
There is a fancy for plain jackets with skirts
of checked or plaid goods. One of blue with a
broken blue ana white check for the skirt, had
no buttonholes, but on either side several.tiny
gilt button., and was worn with a gilt belt.
A hunter's green Â«loth jacket had a skirt of
mixed cheviot that toned in beautifully.
Shirt waists are worn for general use, but
there is an innovation this season in the shape
of exquisitely dainty vests of lace tc worn
with tailormade costumes. These are gener
ally made on a body of cambric partially fitted.
The woman â  who cherishes her pretty jacket
lining puts sleeves in this under-waist. :â .-*â *â 'â '
The skirts made specially to wear with these

major key is known by its major third and the
minor by Its minor third. When from the
tonic to the third note above there are four
semitone* (on the piano five keys) the third is
major, and the key is called a major key. C
E is Â£, major third. . When from the tonic to
the third note above there are but three semi
tones (on the piano four keys) the third Is
minor and the key a minor key. A C is a
minor third. To tell in what key a piece of
music is written it is only necessary to look at
the signature alongside of the clef.

Fears Entertained for the Safety

HER CARGO DANGEROUS COAL.

Similar Cargoes Arrived Here
on Fire.
Grave fears are entertained ior the safety
of the British ship Republic, now out
ninety-two days from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
and 15 per cent reinsurance has been paid
on her. Longer voyages than the above
have been made and no danger antici
pated, but, then, the. Republic is a very
fast vessel, and on her last voyage from
Newcastle to San Francisco made the run
in fifty-five days. Â«"â¢ â >*> Â»â¢ *.*-,".' _fi
It is not the length of time- that she is
out that is frightening the underwriters,
however, but the fact that she is loaded
with Cardiff Colliery coal. The Hollin
wood, with a cargo from the same mine,
had to put into a New Zealand port with
the coal on fire. On March 23 last the
Alexandra, with Cardiff coal, reached here
with the cargo on fire and had to be
scuttled in Mission Bay. , On the 7th inst.
the Brabloch, with the same coal in her
hold, arrived off the heads on fire and had
to be scuttled off Sausalito. All these
facts weigh with the underwriters, and
they propose to do all the reinsuring tbey
can at once. Xy\'A â [ 'yyiAA : i.

When the South Coast Arrived With the Point Arena She at Once Placed the
Steam Schooner Alongside of the Wrecking Steamer Whitelaw. v The Latter
. Was Heady for Her and Soon Had the Disabled Vessel on an Even Keel.
. /-.v,- \ ~s;2a [Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
THE POINT ARENA IN PORT
Was Put on an Even Keel by
the Wrecking Steamer
Whitelaw.
IS NOT VERY BADLY DAMAGED.
Holes in the Hull Will Be Patched
With Canvass and the Vessel
Pumped Out.
After many delays the steam schooner
Point Arena finally reached port yesterday
in tow of the steamer South Coast. She
was run alongside of the wrecker White
law and the work of righting her was at
once begun. The derricks on the wrecker
were got into position and it was not long
before the steam schooner was almost on
an even keel. Divers were then sent down
to locate the damage and later they nailed
canvas on the holes, and*to-day the work
of pumping her out will begin.
The Whitelaw is one of the finest wreck
ing vessels in America, and although she
has not yet. had her trial trip, Captain
T. P. H. Whitelaw considered her full}'
able to handle the disabled vessel. Steam
was got on the boilers and in a few min
utes things were working as smoothly as
though the wrecker had been at work for
months. Cables were placed under the
steam schooner and it was not long before
she was on an even keel.
The real hard work then began, and that
consisted of discovering the damage to the
hull. The following divers were employed:
E. H. Dolph, Peter Wold, Walter Page,
Tom Tucker and Chris Johnson. The
nailing of canvas over the holes in the
bottom of the vessel took some time, and
the coming and goin_ of the divers drew a
large crowd to section 3 of the seawall.
They watched the screwing on of the hel
mets with breathless interest, and when
the clivers would come to the surface to
report progress there would be a rush to
hear, if possible, what they were saying.
In several instances the pipes that carried
air to the divers were trampled on, and
finally Captain Whitelaw had to clear the
ship in order to save a possible catastrophe.
The divers worked methodically, and in a
lew hours they bad all the holes in the
hull of the Point Arena canvased up. At
low water the work, of pumping out will
begin, and by noon to-day j the steamer
will probably be ready to go on the Spreck
els drydock.
Captain Johnson of the Point Arena,
who arrived on the South Coast to-day,
makes the following brief report of the
disaster: "April 19 at 7:30 a. m., while
leaving Point Arena, got a line in the pro
peller, which was made fast from the
steamer Wbitesboro to the buoy. Disabled
the vessel and she was washed' on the
rocks and a hole stove in : her bottom. Was
hove off an hour later with the steam
winch and assistance from the steamer
Whitesboro. Signaled the steamer South
Coast, which was bound north, and made
arrangements to tow to San Francisco."
Captain Hanson of the | South Coast re
ports that the tow was not very difficult.
After the Point Arena went on her beam
ends the main trouble was to just keep go
ing for fear that the engines misht drop
out of the sunken vessel. "We could not
make more than three or four knots an
hour,"' said he, "and it. was mighty lucky
for us that we had fair weather or else we
would have been compelled to abandon
her. As it was, we jogged along and finally
reached port without any trouble after the
Point Arena went on her beam ends."
The Point Arena does not show many
signs of wear and tear after her rough ex
perience. Some of her bulwarks have been
carried away and her deck houses dam
aged. The standing-rigging, however, is
intact, and the boilers and machinery are
still in place. Once the water is pumped
out of hor the work of repairing will be
pin at once and about the first wee l_ in
May Point Arena will be on her old
route again.
Captain Hansen of the South Coast is
quite a large shareholder in the Point
Arena, so what he looses, on one instance
he will make in the other. The salvage
will amount to considerable and Captain
Hansen's share will more than likely
leave him money in pocket after all the
losses on the Point Arena have been paid.
The South Coast only waited here a few
hours to take on coal and 'then started
north again under a full head of steam to
complete , her interrupted voyage.
The appliances for wrecking on the
Whitelaw are perfect and the automatic
air machine is capable of keeping five men
supplied continuously. Yesterday it
worked perfectly and the divers asserted
that the supply \ of air' was 50 per cent
more regular than that sent to them by
the old hand-pumps.
NO COBBLES IN CAR TRACKS
An Ordinance Which Provides
for Removal of the Bad* y
Pavement â .;â :.*
NEGLECTED BY AUTHOEITIES.
Streetcar Companies f Must Ob.y the
Street Superintendent's Order.
A Test Proposed.
The attention of the Merchants' Associa
tion has been called to a | City ordinance
which provides for improving and keeping
in repair the streets between railway
tracks, If enforced this law would cause
many of the busiest thoroughfares in San
Francisco to be completely transformed.-
Fully 50 per cent of the barbarous cobble
pavements would disappear.
The importance of the ordinance has im
pressed itself upon the officers of the asso
ciation, who have given it some considera
tion, and intend to go deeper into the
question. Â â â _;â -'.,: ;--y*l
Some of them are not quite clear on the
interpretation of the law, but they say a
test case should be made, if for nothing
more than to determine the power, of the
municipality to compel the street railroad
companies to keep streets between their
tracks in proper condition.
The ordinance has all the appearance of
having been long forgotten and brought
to light after a lapse of years. Through
many of these years it was an open secret
that certain streetcar companies par
ticularly interested in cobbles held a pe
culiar influence over the authorities whose
duty it was to attend to street matters.
At the present- time, however, when
popular sentiment is strong against the
antiquated pavement this, old ordinance
appears. -The Merchants'/ Association,
which has taken upon itself the general
improvement of the streets, will therefore
have a good opportunity of stirring up the
right people. ;â¢-'
The interesting ordinance gives the Su
perintendent of Streets the same power as
he exercises over sidewalks in which only
private parties are concerned. If he wishes
he can compel* streetcar companies to im
prove or repave between their tracksâ a
power he has neglected to exercise. Here
is the ordinance in lull :
. [Railroad corporations to improve and re
pair the roadway between their tracks, on
notice from Superintendent of Streets.]
Section 5. The Superintendent of Public
Streets, Highways and Squares is hereby em
powered at his option, by serving notice upon
any railroad corporation or company having a
railroad franchise to operate a railroad upon
any of the streets of the City and County of
San Francisco, to require said railroad corpora
tion or company to grade or regrade to the
official grade, plank or replank, pave or re
pave, macadamize or rewacadamize, or to re
pair that portion of the roadway of any street
of this City and County over which the fran
chise of said railroad corporation or company
empowers them to lay down their tracks and
operate their road, for the . space occupied or
to be occupied by and between the rails of said
track or tracks. â¢.
Between said tracks, should there be more
than one laid or to be laid, and for a distance
of two feet on either side of said track or
tracks if laid, and on either side of the space
to be occupied by said track or tracks if yet to
bo laid, any railroad corporation or com
pany so notified shall, within ten days from
and after the service of said notice by said Su
perintendent, cause to be commenced such
grading or regrading to the official grade,
planking or replanking, paving or repaying,
macadamizing or remacadamizing or re
pairing as may be /.specified in said
notice of said Superintendent, and shall
continuously prosecute such work and im
provement to its completion within such a pe
riod of time as shall have been designated by
the said Superintendent in his said notice;
provided that the said Superintendent shall in
all cases require in said notice that the work
and repairs to be executed by said railroad
corporation or company shall be of such a char
acter as will make the space on the roadway of"
said street or streets which said railroad cor
poration or company are required to improve
to conform to the nature of the improvement
contiguous thereto on the said streets or por
tion of streets, whether grading or regrading,
planking or replanking:, paving or repaying,
macadamizing or remacadamizing. .'.-'â 'â  . > .<
The Market-street Railway Company
pretends that this ordinance is not in
tended to apply to streets already accepted
by the City, although it speaks of "regrad
ing, replanking, repaying and remacad
amizing." . This has been construed to
mean that the streetcar corporations must
repair between their tracks. Where streets
are paved after many years witn bitumen
or basalt blocks the presumption is that
the cobbles have outlived their usefulness
as paving material on those thoroughfares.
In such cases removing cobbles and repay
ing them with modern pavement ' is re
garded as "repairs," and for that reason

the ordinance is valid. This is the point
that will be tested.
The method of applying the test lies in
the hands of the Superintendent of Streets.
That official has the power vested in him
by the ordinance to issue a â  mandatory
notice on the street railway company to
remove the coboles. -
- The question arises, will this official en
force the law? . :*Â£__â¢;
ORDERED PURE CHEESE.
Dairy Inspector Vanderbilt Exon
crates the Importing
Firm. ' .
Kennard & Co. of Chicago Sold the
Impure Brand for Good
Cheese.
As was stated in a former issue of The
Call, the name" of the firm that has been
shipping filled cheese to this City, and the
name of the persons to whom it was con
signed, have been withheld from the pub
lic up to date on account of the. fact that
Inspector William Vanderbilt wished to
give the local dealers a reasonable time in
which to prove their innocence of criminal
intent belore giving the full facts for pub
lication. The time expired yesterday, and
true to promise, when seen at the offices of
the State Dairy ' Bureau, the inspector
made the following statements as regards
the affair:
"I have made a full investigation of this
filled-cheese business, and find the facts in
the case to be as follows:
"Messrs. De Bernardi & Co., well-known
commission merchants on Front street of
this City, wrote to A. A. Kennard & " Co.,
commission merchants of Chicago, for quo
tations of full cream cheese, fresh, and for
old cheese of cheaper grade. Kennard &
Co. quoted prices, and De Bernardi & Co.
ordered full cream cheese ana some old
cheese of cheaper grade.
"The cheese was shipped about March
5, accompanied by a letter from the firm
stating that they were full cream cheeses,
which contained a postscript to the effect
that if they could use any filled cheese
they had some that was nice and fresh
and could quote it at prices that would
leave a handsome profit. ; They added,
however, that they would not ship any
filled cheese without informing the per
sons to whom it was consigned that it was
filled cheese. . > -
"The shipment arrived, and Messrs. De
Bernardi & Co. sold it off at once to the
retail dealers. April 1 the Dairymen's
Union purchased two of these cheeses for
the State Dairy Bureau. One of them had
no brand, the other was branded New York
State Full Cream Cheese, Stone Creek Fac
tory No. A.G.
"The bureau made a microscopic exam
ination of the cheese which tended to
make them think it was impure, and they
immediately â¢ notified the dealers, who
promised that they would sell no more of
it until a chemical analysis should con
clusively demonstrate whether or not the
cheese was filled. y*: ; yK y a
"I then took the samples over to the
State University and had an analysis
made by Professor Hilgard. On April 14
the result of the analysis was sent to the
bureau. It showed that both of the cheeses
were filled, but that one of them was more
impure than the other. A-aA.A
"The analysis was at once taken _to
Messrs. De Bernardi & Co., who wired the
Chicago firm that the cheese was filled and
could not be disposed of here. The answer
received was a denial that the cheese was
filled. .De Bernardi & Co. said that they
would return the cheese to-Jvennard &
Co., and I know that this was done to-day.
; ''Messrs. De Bernardi & Co. have shown
me the correspondence on the subject from
the first, and, to be just to them, I must
say that at no time have they shown a
disposition to violate the law. After a
full and impartial investigation, the bu
reau is of the opinion that they were im
posed upon when the cheese was shipped
to them by Kennard & Co., the Chicago
firm." , ,â¢:._*,. .'â  !._?''-*-

TRIED TO ATTACH HER SHARES
Mrs. Auzerala Hoyte Has an Experience

' An ? enterprising firm of collectors at

a bill of $195, contracted some time before
the actress took to the professional stage.
.i The amount Â»' claimed - was for two ele
gant dresses procured from a local firm of
dressmakers previous to one of the then
Mrs. Auzerais' trips to Paris. "The plan to

HAYNE OVERHAULS
THE RAILROAD.
A Scorching Indictment of
the Great Corpora
tion.
LIKENED TO A THIEF.
The Company's Bill of Com
plaint Torn Into Minute
Fragments.
HOW ABOUT THE GRAIN RATES?
A New Line of Argument Is Opened
and Will Be Fo! owed Up in
Earnest To-Bay.
Mr. Hayne continued his luminous and
spirited argument in the case of the South
ern Pacific Company against the State
Board of Railway Commissioners yester
day, and many lights of the legal profes
sion graced the United States Circuit
Court room during the session, and many
were the approving nods which followed
close upon the brilliant pleader's well-put
points and polished periods.
The central point of Mr. Hayne's con
tention was that the burden of proof rested
upon the complainant throughout. The
complaint of the company was, he said,
extremely brief and vague. It volun
teered no information whatever, and stated
barely what was necessary. Placing no
valuation upon the road itself, the docu
ment included the cost of improvements
upon the road under the head of operating
expenses, and was hence, in bis opinion,
indefinite and liable to misconstruction
and misinterpretation. Continuing in the
same strain the eloquent barrister proved,
at least to his own satisfaction, that the
Southern Pacific Company deserved to be
likened to the thief who says "The world
owes me a living." As for the complaint
and its supporting affidavits he picked
them apart and cast their fragments to the
cruel winds of public scorn in terms which
he alone could possibly evolve.
"As though desirous of enlightening
the world," proceeded Mr. Hayne, "the
complaint of the railway company states
that its bonded indebtedness is less than
the value of the road. This statement,
the public knows, is untrue. It is so
false that their own affidavit-makers, with
one exception, fear to support it. That
exception is Mr. Curtis. He says in his
affidavit that the cost and value of the
road largely exceeds its bonded indebted
ness. He has gained the gratitude of the
great corporation by that statement, and
he deserves it. He should be sent to
Egypt, embalmed and preserved for ages
to come as its faithful servant. The plia
ble Stubbs tries to support Curtis, but he
cannot. He clothes his affidavit in subtle
language, and no one knows what he
means. He dared not make the cold as
sertion that Curtis did. Traffic Agent
Klink makes a general statement that the
complaint is true, but he, too, is afraid to
swear that the road is not swallowed up
in debt. The other affidavit agents do not
touch the debt question at all. They dread
its recoil." ,-_y
QAs to the grain rates Mr. Hayne con
tended that if they were the only rates to
be considered the showing was insufficient.
It did not appf ar whether the other rates
were proper or improper. For all that
appeared to the contrary it might have
appeared that the whole trouble revolved
about rates other than grain rates. It
might be that the grain rates which were
cut down had been too high. The company's
bill of complaint alleged that in many
cases large shipments of freight were
carried at actual cost.
In this case, he went on, how many
such shipments were there? What sorts
of freight were referred to? For all that
appeared of record it might be that all
classes of freight save grain alone were
Card d at cost and that the entire burden
rested upon the grain-producers. The
showing should have been of the relative
character of each rate.
The information regarding this point
was all in the complainant's hands and
the complainant had not divulged it. A
large number of cases were read in sup
port of the position that where evidence
in the possession of a party was not pro
duced presumptions would be drawn
against such party by the court.
He then took up the evidence contained
in the report of the Pacific Railway Com
mission and proceeded to show from it
that the inbebtedness of the Central Pa
cific Railway was fraudulent and that
therefore it could not be made a basis for
tbe fixing of rateÂ».
Soon after the opening of the afternoon
session Mr. Pilisbury called attention to
his side's contention that the company
was not claiming any consideration of the
Government debt.
Mr. Hayne read from the bill of com
plaint to show that such was not the case
but that by an artfully, contrived mode of
expression it appeared to be open to the
construction that the Government debt
was not relied upon.
This produced some spirited discussion
and an interruption in the line of argu
ment. Mr. Hayne said he had not brought
his authoritiesâ or, to use his own expres
sion, his "ammunition"â with him, and in
order to give him time to load up for an
other onslaught the Judge adjourned fur
fa er proceedings until to-day.
THE HOME INDUSTRY FAIR.
Final Arrangement* Nearly Perfected
for a Grand Exposition.
A second conference of the committees
from the Mechanics' Institute and the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
wag held yesterday relative to holding a
big home industry fair in the fall. The
institute's committee reported that the
trustees had approved of the recommen
dations of -the committees at the first
meeting. A little change had been made
regarding the articles to be exhibitedâ in
this, that all shall be of Pacific Coast States
manufacture excepting such as are not
made on this coast and articles of
curiosity.
It was decided that space and power
shall be free, and that the fair shall last
from September Ito October 3. The sub
ject of season tickets for members and for
the public in general, will be discussed
later. S There will be* thousands admitted
free of charge, such as school children.
The important matter of how the profits
of the fair/shall be disposed of did not
require so much discussion as was "ex
pected: Mr. Denicke of the institute ex
plained that the last two expositions net
ted $13,866 and the last five fairs ; netted
only $20,000. The Drofits on the last fair '
were $10,000. The â¢ trustees had' decided,
that as the last-named. sum is about the
average of what a fairly profitable eiDosi
tion would nroduce, that all net profits
above $10,000 'be divided between the two
organizations. The institute will not
charge any rent for the Pavilion. Mr.
Lewis said that the fair should net at least
$20,000. With but little discussion r the
offer was approved. After further conver
sation the committees decided to make
their final reports to their respective bodies
and if their work be approved, to leave the
arrangement of further details â  to the
management of the fair, which will be
composed of representatives of the two
organizations. - j
A SAILOR'S YARN.
Jack Tells How a Stranger Forced Bim
to Carry Off a tot of Diamond
Jewelry.
James H. James, a sailor, was arrested
Sunday on a charge of being drunk. When
searched at the City Prison a gold watch
and chain and several diamond rings were
found in his pockets.
The matter was reported to Captain
Lees ana he detailed Detectives Gibson
and Wren to find, if possible, the owner of
the jewelry. They soon learned that it
was stolen from * the residence of Mrs.
Mary Thomas, at Shattuck and Rose ave
nues. Oakland, last Saturday night.
James had been detained pending the
investigation and yesterday be admitted
that the jewelry belonged to Mrs. Thomas
of Oakland ; but he made an original de
fense.
"I called at the house," he said, "and
met a man there who asked me if I was an
Englishman. I told him I was and he
gathered up the jewelry and put it in my
pocket I told him I was no thief and did
not want it, but he would not listen to me.
When I made further objections to carry
ing it off he pulled a pistol out of his
pocket and told me to keep it or he would
kill me. 'You'll need it,' he said, so I
walked away. I came to San Francisco
next morning and got drunk."
The police place no credence in his
story and yesterday morning he was
booked on the charge of burglary. Later
be was taken to Oakland for trial.
TRADES UNION MATTERS
The Recent Agitation and Strikes
Productive of Good
Results. *
Purposes and Aims of the Fraternity
of Hotel and Restaurant
Employes.
The recent agitation in the Building
Trades Unions' circles has about subsided,
and from all accounts the disturbance has
proved a benefit to the union working
men. Business Agents Schadt and Mclvor
report that the City is steadily becoming
unionized under the card system. The
mixed jobs are gradually becoming fair,
and notwithstanding that several unions
have raised their initiation fee many new
members are going on the rolls. Most of
these came from the unfair jobs. This, of
itself, is encouraging. Agent Mclvor
states that the unions have one difficulty
to overcome, and that is a number of
workmen of all trades are coming to
San Francisco, having learned that
the strike has been successful and that $3
for eight hours' work is the prevailing rate.
Even at the best there are 50 per cent more
workmen in this City than the trade war
rants, and at present the trade is at a very
low ebb. It will be several months be
fore it is likely to liven up to anything like
briskness. For all this the union men are
holding together in a commendable man
ner.
The Fraternity of Hotel and Restaurant
Employes is booming along in a most en
couraging manner since the division
caused by the withdrawal of a number of
cooks and waiters, who formed a union of
their, own. The latter withdrew because
they objected to being in an organization
with dishwashers, porters or any but those
in their own lines. With the fraternity it
was different. With the latter body its
principles are set forth in a little circular
which reads: ;â¢â;.:;
The objects of this union are to better the
condition and educate the cooks, waiters,
kitchen-hands, porters, and all other persons
employed in and about hotels and restaurants.
The advantages incident to a membership in a
union of this description are only too evident
when compared with those who are not organ
ized and who fail to assume a definite atti
tude toward labor in the great struggle for an
existence. All engaged in the above work are
cordially invited to join us. There is an em
ployment office in connection with the union
lor the benefit of its members.
The fraternity met Monday night at 115
Turk street and after considerable discus
sion it was unanimously decided to affli
ate with the new Trade and Labor Alli
ance, the union deeming it the wisest
course to connect itself with the alliance
instead of the Labor Council. The invi
tation to participate in tbe parade and
exercises given by the Socialist Labor
.Party at the Metropolitan Temple on the
evening of Mayday was accepted, several
waiters volunteering to act as ushers at the
temple on that evening. Short speeches
were made by Henry Wanicke of the cigar
maker's Union, Theodore Lynch, the
union's delegate to the Central Trade and
Labor Alliance, G. B. Benham of the Typo
graphical Union, Eugene Brown of the
Journeymen Butchers' Union, Thomas
Beresford, B. Kriegor, J. H, Luchewitz,
Leon Brown and several others.
At a meeting of the United Garment
makers last evening the question of organ
izing the women in the trade into a branch
union was discussed. It was the opinion
of the majority that there was no use of
beginning aggressive movements until the
co-operation of the women was secured.
The tenor of the reports was that the
women as a rule were in favor of becom
ing unionized, realizing that the trade
would never improve without active con
certed efforts on the part of the employes.
Upon this showing it was decided to' or
ganize a woman's union, to be a branch of
the men's union, as soon as possible.
Business Agent Schadt of the Building
Trades Council yesterday received from
Philadelphia . the charter for the French
and Italian Carpenters' Union recently
organized by him when he was district
organizer. This body will at once go into
permanent organization.
. Although the new Metal- roofers' Union
has only been organized two weeks it has
gathered in nearly ail of the old organiza

THE y SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.
THE PAINTER'S MASCOT.
"Jumbo " Purvine's Sudden
Change From Poverty to Un
limited Wealth.
A CRIPPLE 1 CREEK CLAIM.
A Poor Painter Learns That His Min
ing Property in Colorado Is
Very Valuable.
There are very few who know that the
painters' union in its recent strike had a
mascot, and the number is even smaller
who know that this mascot has himself
had a change of luck, having gone at a
bound from poverty to affluence. Around
the painters* headquarters he is known by
the name of "Jumbo," and besides the
secretary of the union there are not many
who have heard Jumbo's true name. But
away back in his old home in Monett, :
Missouri, the family Bible shows a record
that Jumbo was baptized in the name of
J. E. Purvine. In other parts of the 1
Union, and particularly in the Wild West,
Purvine has sailed under the nickname of
"Buster."
The painters' mascot is a young giant,
i
J. E. Purvine thÂ© Painters' Mascot, Who Has Recently Learned of His Good
Fortune.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
standing over six feet in height, and he
has massive shoulders and powerful arms
for a boy of 22 years. He is a painter by
trade, and coming to this City shortly
before the strike, he at once joined the
union, and proved himself to be an active
member during the times of trouble. If
there was any committee or "missionary"
work to be done, Jumbo was in the front
ranks. He was also the warden who
guarded the door when the strikers were
meeting, and no spy upon the union en
tered while Jumbo was in the hall. >
As the strike progressed and the time 3
became worse Purvine's purse, like the
others, became alarmingly flat. When the
grass became so short that he knew not
which way to turn the mascot received a
lettr from his old father back in Monett
that contained joyful news as well as the
following clipping from a Monett daily
newspaper: *: â .-,Â« .y.
The name of "Buster" Purvine is familiar to
every one in Monett. It will be remembered
at the mention of this name that "Buster" was
a rustler of odd jobs of painting, etc. Becom
ing disgusted at the monotony of odd jobs,
"Buster" became imbued with the idea of ad
venture over a year ago and lrft his natal nest
for pastures green and fresh, in the wilds of a
Western life. Not as an adventurer after the
wild West fashion, but a longing desire had
seized him to look for work in other locali
ties. "Buster" left Monett and went to Vinita
and remained there a short time, follow
ing his regular vocation of odd jobs.
Not realizing his ideal at Vinita, he
embarked overland, through sand and
storm, tall grasses and wild jungles, until he
reached the high and rugged lands of Colo
rado. Here he wandered from place to place
still in search of employment. Atlast "Buster"
came to his fountain of wealth. '-â â  *
A few months ago he pitched his tent on
Cripple Creek soil and, unlike the Arab of old,
concluded to stick his stake. News has at last
been received of "Buster's" unsurpassed luck.
He has struck it rich. The little bit of earth
that "BusteÂ»" concluded to adopt as his own
has turned. out to be a bonanza. Gold in an ;
unlimited quantity has been found on his
claim. Ana the once "Buster" of odd jobs has
become the happy possessor of a $50,000 . gold
mine. Long live our favorite "Buster." .* â¢'â â ;'*,
To say that Jumbo was delighted is put
ting it mild, and in his glee he told how
he became possessed of the valuable Crip-,
pie Creek claim. .As indicated in the clip
ping, Purvine was of a roving disposition,
and after several years at public school he
started out to see -the world at the early
age of 12 years. Since then he has roamed
all over this country and Canada', and has
been in every : State and Territory in; the
United States except five. v He made sev
eral visits to * his ; home at , Monett, but
never stayed: long. In his wanderings
Purvine : has been . in many strange situa
tions, and being a union man in principles,
he has been ,â¢ through half a dozen labor
strikes. A few years ago he traveled ex
tensively through Texas, the ; Cherokee
Strip and the' Oklahoma district. In the
latter Jhe served las- a" shotgun messenger
on the railroads to protect Uncle Sam's
mail | trains \ from | road agents. He was
then wearing a Deputy United States Mar
shal's badge. : *> y'. â¢ '*â .-:
When a reduction was made in the force
of deputies "Buster," as 'he was then
called ,' was cropped with 100 others,' and
be paid another visit to his Missouri home.
Shortly after the gold} fever broke f out in
Colorado, and Purvine 'was \ one of Â« the
multitude that rushed to the new * fields.
In the latter part of last July Purvine took
up a miner's claim in the Cripple Creek
district, and, 1 fortunately, he has kept up
his title to - the â¢? claim. For â  the " lack, of,
funds to develop the property; Purvine
was obliged to start out again, and he fol
lowed his trade until he reached this coast.
Purvine is a man of many resources, as
shown by an incident connected with his
departure from Colorado. As stated, he
was nearly "broke" and bad only 75 cents
left on * one occasion. Of : this sum he
spent 26 cents for a dinner and invested
the remainder in soap, tinfoil and the oil
of pennyroyal. Retiring to his room Pur
vine mixed the soap and the oil, rolled
the mixture in little strips of tinfoil and
started â  out : with his "patent corn cure."
He worked the sporting resorts, where
people were lound whose corns caused
them trouble, and within a week Purvine
had made $160 oat of his corn salve. A
funny incident happened in the fact that
he sold to his uncle, whom he had never
met, $1 50 worth of the stuff. He did not
find this out for several months, when he
accidentally met and became acquinted
with his relative. -\ J â 
The letter from Purvine's father stated
that the old gentleman was about to
hasten to Cripple Creek to look after his
son's claim and see that no one got it
away. Purvine is working hard to get
money to go to Colorado and look after
his valuable mining property. At present
it is uphill work as the painting business
is not very lively. In case Purvine should
receive any money from home the Paint
ers' Union will suddenly lose its mascot
as Jumbo is anxious to leave for Cripple
Creek. . '
CHARGED WITH PERJURY.
Walter B. Forsyth's Father-ln-Law
Swears Out a Warrant Against Him.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge Low's
court yesterday for the arrest of Walter
13allentine Forsyth on the charge of per
jury. The complaining witness is Ber
nard Connama, 914 North Point street,
his father-in-law.
The alleged perjury, according to the
complaint, is that Forsyth on March 25
went before H. J. Angelo, a deputy County
Clerk, and falsely swore that Mary Con
nama's age was 18 years and past, whereas
in fact she was only 17 years old.
Forsyth is having a hard time of it with
his wife's parents. Last week he was ar
rested on complaint of his mother-in-law
for vagrancy and failure to provide, and
on Tuesday Judge Joachim sen dismissed
the charges against him.
FIFTY MILES OF TRACK
The Valley Road Now Extends
From Stockton to the
Merced River.
More Big Contracts AwardedâAddi
tional Rolling Stock Added to
the Equipment.
.Track-laying on the Valley road was
completed to the Merced River yesterday.
This rounds up the first fifty miles of the
road that is to be the first great competitor
the Southern Pacific Company has ever
had to contend with. ' â >â â â¢'
Some remarkably rapid work was ac
complished between the Tuolumne River
and the Merced, a : distance of about
twenty miles being laid with track in ten
days, or an average of two miles a day. y
Further track-laying "will now have ;to
await the construction of one of the largest
and most costly bridges of the road, that
across the Merced River, which will be
three or four weeks in ' building. \ Con
tracts for the material for continuing
work when the Merced has been crossed
were awarded Tuesday and the successful
shippers were notified yesterday of their
good fortune. ; The contract for the trestle
bridges that will be required between the
Merced River and the San Joaquin was
let to Darby Laydon.& | Co." of this j City.
This contract involves about $20,000. The
iron work for the San Joaquin | bridge was
awarded to the Pacific Rolling Mills, the
J udson Manufacturing ! Company â¢ and * to
the Payne Bolt Works. V
Another , lot of cars for the road arrived
at Lathrop yesterday from the carshops of
Carter Brothers at Newark, Cal. It con
sisted of a train of thirty flatcars on which
were loaded the material for about seventy
or eighty more cars, which will : be ' put to
gether as rapidly as possible. This is the
first installment of an order for 250 cars re
cently placed with the firm named. Ex
clusive -of these the r road â¢ now has s three
locomotives, 100 flatcars and fifty boxcars.

YALE'S WORK APPROVED.
The State Mining Association
Presents Him With an
Address.
WAS A PIONEER IN MINING.
The Appropriations That Have Been
Gained and the Laws Enacted
for the God-Diggers. t
The California Miners' Association held
a meeting last night at the Union League
Club. Attorney Wright presented to
Charles G. Yale, one of the leading organ
izers and member of the executive com
mittee, handsomely engrossed resolutions
commending him for his untiring work in
aid of the California miners.
Mr. Wright made an eloquent speech. j
Jacob Neff also made a brief address, com
mending Mr. Yale's work. The latter
gentleman replied in a very feeling way.
Mr. Wright's i address, with the resolu
tions, was as follows:
Mr. President: In the year 1873 a blow was
struck which crippled and has almost de
stroyed the silver-producing industry in the
United States. Ten years later the gold-mining
industry of California received an equally se
vere stroke. The Nation has not recovered
from the one, the Slate still suffers from the
other, while the miner is the heaviest indi
vidual loser by both.
The necessity for a policy so destructive to
the Interests of this particular guild is not ap
parent to my mind in either case.
After much careful study of the subject I am
firmly convinced that the wisest American
policy is that which would result in securing
full value to the product of every American
mine and a check upon the unlimited power
of gold, now fast becoming a tyranny. I have
entire confidence in the abundance of Amer
ican resources and in the wisdom of American
statesmanship to accomplish these results.
When we reflect that in the domain of
diplomacy the simple writing of a letter by an
American President to an American Congress
resulted in the immediate surrender of a cher
ished and vaunted policy by the proudest and
most aggressive nation on earth, it Is no
longer difficult to believe that In the world of
finance the power of this Nation is equally un
derstood and feared.
The United States and not England should
be and will be the world's arbiter in finance
and In business as well as in war.
Equally difficult is it to understand the
necessity for that policy which has reduced by
one-half the product of gold in California dur
ing all the years. since 1883. We hear much of
the rivalry between Califo rnia and Colorado
as to which is the banner State in the matter
of gold production, and our friends, the Colc
radans, have even had the temerity to call
theirs the "New Golden State." Mr. President,
such rivalry would be unknown if the miners
of California were permitted to work their
mines.
By a moderate estimate, the product of gold
in California has been curtailed not less than
$150,000,000 since the North Bloomfield de
cision was rendered, and but for that decision
who doubts that the . product of California
would now equal $30,000,000 per year ?
It is significant of the law-abiding character
of the miners of California that with such pa
tience they have submitted to a system of laws
which brought them poverty for riches, and
desolation and ruin where formerly existed
prosperity and abundance. . â  *
Stunned and helpless after the first ruinous
blow they submitted to the law as it was de
clared by the courts, with but little hope of
ever regaining the privileges they had lost,
while their enemies of the valley rejoiced in a
ruin which, by -natural processes, eventually
became at least in part their own. But there
is a limit to all things, even to the patience of
a miner. â â¢"- ..--.
Up in that mountlan county, which, Mr. Presi
dent, is honored by your residence within its
borders, a few thoughtful'miners in the latter
part of the year 1891 gathered together and
reasoned somewhat after this fashion: The
guilds of London have been a power within
that city for centuries, and the Lord Mayor is
always selected from among their members.
Their power is the result of organized effort.
The farmer of California has bis grange and
boasts of the ability of his class to dictate the
political and business policy of the State. He
too derives his power from organization. Why
should not the miners of the State organize and
stand together in an effort to regain something
of what they.have lost, and even to advance
beyond their former condition of prosperity?
It was fortunate for the miners of the State,
Mr. President, that among the little group was
a gentleman, now here present, a member of
the committeeâ the son of a man eminent
among the many eminent men who have fol
lowed the profession of the law and the busi
ness of mining in this Stateâ who had not
only the knowledge to comprehend but the
administrative ability to carry to success the
plan outlined at that meeting.
I refer to the gentleman whom this night we
delight to honor, Charles G. Yale.
Soon after the little meeting I have spoken
of, Mr. ale returned to San Francisco, and
called a meeting here, whicb was attended by I
sixteen gentlemen. It seems strange, Mr.
President, to think of the California Miners-
Association with a membership of only six
teen, â¢ while now half that many thousands
have their names upon its rolls. The work
begun by those little meetings was not allowed
to lag. From that time till now it has gone
on with ever-increasing success until the full
fruition of the association's labors seem near
at hand. . Â..,..-â¢-â¢
. The caminetti law, making the business of
hydraulic mining again lawful and respecta
ble and providing for the United States Debris
Commission, the California State Debris Com
mission law. providing for the appointment of
a State Debris Commissioner and condition
ally for the expenditure of $250,000 of money
by the State in the construction of impound
ing darns; the Ford hydraulic mining lawâ all
these are facts made possible and accomplished
by the efforts , of the miners of California in
association assembled ; and we are assured
from the Nation's capital that once more the
appeal of the miner has been heard and that
within a few short weeks we may certainly
count on the following enactments: First, a
clause , in the rivers and harbors bill appro
priating $15,000 forthe expense of the United
States Debris Commissioners ; next, a clause in
the same bill appropriating $250,000 to be
used in connection with the like amount ap
propriated by the , Legislature of this State m
the buildiug of impounding dams,* and last,
but not least, in its importance to the miner,
the mineral lands bill, < preventing the appro
priation of mineral lands within this State by
the railroad companies, v
I note in the morning dispatches, Mr. Presi
dent, a statement by the attorney of the Anti-
Debris Association to the effect that he admits
he has lost the fight against the appropriation
I have named, but that his association will
contend with the miner against the building
of such dams as will permit of further dydraillic
mining. Mr. President, I for one give myself
no anxiety on that score. I noted, sir, that
Mr. Devlin on his recent visit to Washington
soon found he had but little business in that*
busy city. A change came o'er the spirit of
the little dream he had cherished when he
found a united delegation working in the in
terests of the miner, and he left for New York.
And, Mr. President, I think we can trust the
eminent lawyers of that delegation to so word
the statute as to give the miner the benefit he
craves. :â 'â¢:â â  >. - â  - ... -..-.-. -.--*- -.
Think of the change, Mr. President, in th.
position of the hydraulic miner of California
from what it was when that little band was '
called together by, Mr. Yale. Then, "none so
poor to do him reverence," now, a Congres
sional delegation united in advancing his most
reasonable requests.
. Such, Mr. President, is the result of organ
ized effort. > Sir, from that s little beginning
until now this movement has had no more un
flagging : friend than Charles G. Yale, . while
still his services are given to the cause without
stint and without weariness. To multiply
words in this connection, Mr. President, would
but belittle their power. I can but express
the truth by reading the resolutions which
on behalf of the Miners' Association of Cali
fornia, it is now my duty and my pleasure to
present, Mr. Yale, to your good self.; _
Whebkas, Charles G. Yale was the founder of
the California Miners' Association as now consti
tuted, and, whereas, lie has rendered invaluable
services to the association at all times since its or
ganization,' as an editor earnestly and intelligently
urging measures for its advancement; us a writer
for the dally press fearlessly and consistently
making its contests, and as a diligent worker upon
its various committees: thereJore. - *
a Resolved, 'That the : gratitude of the California
Miners' Association la due to Charles G. Yale for
his past services, and that its thanks he hereby
tendered to him; and- ._ ?- j â  .â â --.- '

thai-lea G. Yale with an - engrossed copy of these
resolutions, the same to. be duly attested by the

JERE LYNCH RETURNS.
Miners and Mine-Owners Satisfied With
James Cronan as Manager of
"- ' Hale '& Norcross. 'â -:â --â ?:'â 
Jere Lynch, statesman, Egyptologist and
president of the Hale & Norcross Mining
Company, returned * from the Com stock
yesterday, bringing words of cheer and a
brick of gold and -silver to his associates
in the management of the mine. The
bullion brought by Mr. Lynch in his grip
sack is a sample of , the first product of
Hale & Norcross under the new manage
ment, and surely nothing finer was ever
produced under Colonel Nat Messer's
regime. .. . . i
Mr. Lynch did not pose as a sphynx yes
terday. "On the contrary, he imparted
cheerfully the information . that the mine
was being, worked in a satisfactory man
ner and that all the difficulties with the
Miners' Union of Virginia City had been
happily adjusted. "There are no longer
any shadows, said Mr. Lynch, "and it is
just as if there had not been any. No.
Mr. Tangerman is not there. James Cro
nan, a very capable man, is manager."
THEY WILL NOT TELL.
The Committee Decides the Phelan
Competition and Keeps It Secret.
The fate of the artists who competed in
the Phelan competition for the best his
torical picture is already decided, for the
committee which is to award the prizes
met yesterday afternoon at the Art Insti
tute, and after deliberating an hour and a
half, arrived at â¢ its decision. The mem
bers of the committee then dispersed, with
set faces and "locked lips, resolved not to
betray their decision by so much as the
raising of an eyebrow.
Captain Robert Fletcher and F. 8. Sam
uels are the members of trie committee ap
pointed by the board of directors as the "lay
men" who had to give a non-artist's opin
ion on the pictures. Miss Alice Chitten
don and Ernest Peixotto were the two
artists appointed by the competitors, but
as the lady declined to act, Douglas Tilden
was appointed in her stead. The fifth
member, chosen by the four appointees,
was Bruce Porter.
The reason given for guarding the secret
till to-day was that the committee wished
to communicate its decision formally to
the board of directors late this afternoon.
There is zreat curiosity in art and Bohe
mian Club circles to know whether Mat
thews. Kieth or Pissis will win first prize,
and the members of the awarding com
mittee made a mutual compact not to
frequent clubs or studios last night for
fear their secret should be surprised and
wrung from them. â

SHE LEADS IN BURGLARY
Daisy Cohen the First of Her
Sex and Kind to Be
Convicted.
No Other Woman in San Francisco
Has Ever Been Found Guilty
of a Similar Charge.
For the first time in the criminal history
of the State a woman has been convicted
of burglary. Convictions for grand lar
ceny have not been few and petit lar
cenists have been as numerous as the days
of a decade, but a woman burglar, pure
and simple, is a novelty in the San Fran
cisco courts.
The woman was Daisy Brown, also
known as Daisy Cohen. She was very
like the ordinary grand larcenist, and her
victim was the usual man from the coun
try. He was W. Selkirk, a miner from Si
erra County, and he had a room in a house
on Ellis street. He had $60 in cold which
he kept in his room, and foolishly he told
where he kept it. A visit from the defend
ant was the result. She was on burglary
bent, and she left with the miner's $60 in
her pocket. She was caught, arrested
tried before Judge Wallace, was convicted
and will be sentenced to-morrow.
The difference between burglary in the
first degree, the charge of which the woman
was convicted, and grand larceny is
sufficient to make the case interesting' A
grand larcenist is one who, among other
things, takes money or valuables of any
kind and any value from the person or
pockets of the owner. A burglar is one
who takes property from the house of the
owner, and burglary in ,the first degree is
where one breaks into si room or house
and takes what can be found. â¢ The
woman, while not the first woman bo
charged, is the first one to be convicted of
burglary in the first degree.

BACK TAXES
Petition for Writ of Man
date Against Asses
sor Siebe.
MR. CLUNIE'S ATTACK.
He Wants the Assessor to Col
lect on Thirteen Millions
for Last Year.
THE MARKET-STREET LINE.
A Railway Official Says That the
Supervisors Are the Court of
Last Resort.
Andrew J. Clunie yesterday filed in the
Supreme Court a writ of mandate asking
that Assessor Siebe be required to collect
the taxes on $13,000,000 alleged to be due
by the Market-street railway system on
the taxes for 1895, which escaped collection
by reason of alleged false representation of
the railway company.
Divested of the necessary legal verbiage,
the petition recites that the capital stock
of the Market-street Railway Company is
$13,750,000, divided into 187,500 shares of
the par value of $100 each, and that on and
since the first Monday of March, 1895, the
company has been the owner of real and
personal property of the value of
$17,500,000. It is alleged further that the
company, through its officers and for the
purpose of and with the design of evading
taxation on its property for the fiscal year
commencing July 1, 1895, willfully and
falsely represented to the Assessor that
the full cash value of its property did not
exceed $3,888,886, whereas the said officers
knew that it was not less than $17,000,000.
The petition recites further that the dif
ference of $13,616,154 between the actual
assessment and the $17,500,000 of alleged
actual value has escaped taxation by con
cealment on the part of the company, and
has entailed a loss of $300,000 or there
abouts to the revenue of the City. It is
recited further that the reason why the
application is made primarily before the
Supreme Court is that the matters here in
volved are of great public importance, and
that it is absolutely necessary that the
same should be speedily decided in order
that the rights of the people may be pro
tected and that the time consumed by pro
ceeding in the Superior Court would be so
great as to render the proceeding of no
avail if carried in the lower court.
The petitioner asks the court for a writ
of mandamus directing John D. Siebe, as
Assessor, to assess the property upon the
difference of $13,000,000.
Mr. Clunie said yesterday that the stock
of the Market-street Railway Company
was selling in the open market for $13 a
share and that on this estimate the value
of. the system -would approximate' $9,000,-"]
000. He added that he represented clients
who had furnished various City depart
ments with supplies and to whom the City
was indebted to the extent of half a mil
lion dollars, which could not be paid be
cause the funds had been exhausted and
because the law prohibits the City and
County from using the funds of one year
to pay claims contracted in another year.
His clients had argued that if the Market
street Railway Company had paid its just
taxes th* re would have been no deficiency
in the funus. , J|___fÃi__slMÃg|Â£j
Assessor Siebe was asked as to his
opinion of the affair. He replied that he
had treated the Market-street Railway
system in the same manner as he had
treated every one else and had assessed
them on the same basis.
"I have increased the assessment on the
Market-street Railway system every year."
he said. 'I have been watching their im
provements very closely, and nothing has
escaped me. Last year's assessment was
$800,000 more than' that of 1894. It was
$3,100,000 In 1894 and $3,962,000 in 1895.
This year it will be about $4,500,000. I
have not yet received any statement from
the company, and when I do 1 shall not
be guided by it. I tried them in .he same
way as all other corporations and firms.
"I don't love the Market-street Railroad
Company, and have no reason to love it,
for it had a green ticket out against me at
the last election. I assess according to
values and not for buncombe. So far as
the $17,000,000 of bonds is concerned, they
have not been sold, and therefore do not
represent value. That is another of those
tricks of Huntington." vy -
Mr. Siebe added that he had received
two letters from Mr. Clunie, but had paid
no attention to them.
The following is a copy of the second
letter: . --.'-- _ ",Â« v?
Fan Francisco, March 26, 1896.
Jinn. John D. Siebe, Assessor of the City and
County of San Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Several
days ago I wrote you concerning certain of
your duties as Assessor. Since then I have made
an examination of the assessment roll, as pre
pared by you last year, and find many dis
crepancies therein, to which I desire to call
your attention in order that the mistakes of
last year may be corrected and their recur
rence this year prevented.
The particular matter to which at this time
I desire to call your attention is your manner
of assessing the property and franchises of
different corporations, particularly, Market
street Railway Company, Spring Valley Water
Company, Gutter-street Railway Company. San
Francisco Gas Light Company, Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph Company, - California
Electric Light Company, and the objection I
make to the assessed valuation of their prop
erty as returned by you applies to a great num
ber of other corporations, as can be readily
seen by reference to the roll and their articles
of incorporation and the quotations of the mar
ket values of their stock./ â  - *
This objection is that you have failed to
assess the property and franchises of these cor
porations at their full cash value, which, by
notices issued by you, is defined as follows:
"The term 'foil cash value' means the amount
at which the property .would be taken in pay
ment of a just debt due from a solvent debtor;
or. In other words, if taken in exchange for
L'niied Slates coin."
The questions as to the manner of assessment
of the franchises of corporations have fre
quently been before the Supreme Court of the
State, and a mode of determining the value of
the same by deducting the cash value of all the
real and personal property of the corporation
from the market value of its capital stock has
been approved in the cases of San Jose Gas
Company vs. January, 57 Cal., 614; Spring
Valley Water Company,, vs. Schottler, 62 Cal.;
69; Spring Valley Water Works vs. Barber, 99
Cal., 36; but the rule here. sanctioned does not
seem to have been followed by you in making
your assessments.
Section 3648. Political Code, provides: "Any
property willfully concealed, removed, trans
ferred or misrepresented *by the owner or
agent thereof to evade taxation upon discov
ery must be assessed- at not exceeding ten
times its value, and the assessment so made
must not be reduced by the Board of Super
visors."
Section 3649: "Any property discovered by
the Assessor to have escaped assessment for the
last preceding year, if such* property is in the
ownership or under , the control of the same
person who owned or controlled It for such pre
ceding year, may be assessed at double its
value." juW'J ' ignijjs _TJiili_jji Juwiiil o_H___g_L___l_la-__-(
The provisions of the code have been con
strued in Biddle vs. Oaks, 59 Cal., 95; city of
San Luis OWspo vs. Pettlt, 87 Cal., 499. V
Construing them with reference to the fail
ure of the corporations referred to to pay
taxes upon the full cash value of their prop
erty â¢ and franchises last ; year, I am of the
opinion that, if the failure to assess was the
result of concealment or misrepresentation on
the part ox said corporation or their agents,
then it is your duty to now assess the same un
der section 3648 at not exceeding ten times Its
value. If the omission was from any other
reason, then it is your duty to now assess the
same under section 3649 at double its value.
The records of the Superior Court of the City
and County of San Francisco will furnish much
interesting 'Information as to the value of the
property and franchises of some of these cor
porations. In the case Market-street Rail
way Company vs. Hellman there on file, and
recently decided by the Supreme Court of the
State, will be found a lull history of the
Market-street Railway Company, and part of
this history will show the directors of this
company consider the property of such value
as to have authorized the issuance of $17,500.
-000 worth of bonds thereon; this certainly
ought to be taken as a fair valuation of the
property last year and now.
In the case of the Spring Valley Water Com
pany vs. San Francisco, 82 Cal., 286, on appeal
from the Superior Court of the City ana County
of San Francisco, this company, in its verified
complaint, set forth that it had "constructed
aqueducts and pumping and otner works and
laid many miles of water pipe for distributing
water to its consumers, and that its aforesaid
lands, water rights, works, buildings and im
provements necessary to make it to fulfill the
said purposes of its incorporation are of great
value.to wit: of a value exceeding^ 25,000,000."
This was of its property in 1889. Since then it
has constantly been extending its works and it
certainly was worth as much last year and is
now as in 1889, so tbat you can have but little
trouble in determining its value.
It is my intention, if possible, to see that the
property of these corporations is properly as
sessed this year and the mistakes of last year
rectified as herein suggested. In order to do
this I intend to apply to the Supreme Court of
this State, upon notice to yon, for a writ of
mandamus to compel such assessment to be
made for this year and last year.
As a basis for such application I hereby de
mand that you assess the property and fran
chises of said corporations for the year at their
full cash value. ',"- *Â«â '-. â¢
And inasmuch as the franchises and prop
erty of said corporations were not assessed at
their lull cash value last year, I hereby de
mand that you Immediately proceed to assess
the same as required by sections 3648 and
5649, Political Code of this State.
An official high in the law department
of the Southern Pacific Company said that
of the new issue of $17,500,000 of bonds
only about $2,000,000 worth had been sold.
"The petition will be dismissed in the
Supreme Court for want of jurisdiction,"
he added. "The whole matter lies in the
discretion of the' Assessor. Should any
taxpayer feel aggrieved he may appeal to
the Board of Supervisors, sitting as th 1 *-
City and County Board of Equalization.
They are the court of last resort, unless
the constitution has been violated."
"How about the stock of the company
being sold at nine millions?" was asked.
. "That is a matter that rests with As-,
sessor Kiebe," was the reply.-
SLEEPS IN HIS OFFICE
One of Dr. Preston's Methods of
Reducing His Ex
penses.
His Wife Says She Is Starving and
He Says He Cannot Give Her
the Alimony Ordered.
The matrimonial row between the Pres
tons took on a definite shape yesterday, for
from legal papers and the filing of motions
and petitions, the principals came down
to verbal charges and caustic remarks.
It is only two months since Dr. Walton
Preston was ordered by Judge Seawell to
pay his wife $50 a month alimony. Be
tween that time and this he has paid her
only $25. and for some weeks he has been
in imminent peril of going to jail for not
paying more. He was discharged from
custody yesterday, however, after he had
shown that his interest in this world's
goods was small and very precarious. . yv-
I The case came up yesterday on an order
to show cause why he should , not be pun
ished for contempt of court for not paying
alimony to the limit set. Mrs. Marie
Preston was first on the stand. She said
she and her children were starving, or at
least they would be starving only they
had been living on the bounty "of the
charitable institutions of the City. She
had received but very little help from her
recreant husband, she j said, and she
wanted him to pay up to date or let the
grip of the law try to wrest it from him.
Dr. Preston then mounted the throne of
truth and veracity, and before he had been
there two minutes he and Mr. Heyneman,
counsel for Mrs. Preston, were paying
negative compliments to each other at
such a rate that the court had to interfere.
Preston produced a book of receipts show;
ing that his monthly income amounted to
about $240, and he then produced a state
ment of bills payable showing that his ex
penses amounted to the same sum, having
nothing in the way of alimony for any one.
Heyneman intimated that the figures
were not what they seemed, and the wit
ness became angry. Preston was asked if
he had not deposited his money with
people who would keep it until the suit
was over, and who would then return it.
The witness indignantly denied that such
was the case. Then he swore that he had
sixty patients, thirty of whom were pay
ing patients and the remainder were not.
He was then asked if he had his shoes
polished, and he answered that he black
ened his shoes himself and hoped counsel
did the same. He said further that he
averaged about two meals a day. Some
times he got one and sometimes he had
three good ones, but he averaged about
two meals a day. He swore, too, that his
office rent was $35 a month, and that he
slept in his ollice to save room rent. . ; Vy
There were more tales of poverty and
starvation, and finally Judge Seawell dis
missed the order to show cause and set the
trial of the divorce case, which' is stilf
pending, for to-morrow. it will not be
tried, however, for neither side is ready,
but it will come to trial within a short
thee. . . f ' , *
AFRAID OF FELONY.
Why James A. Oibson Does Not .Want
to Answer Question*.
James Alfred Gibson refused to answer
any questions touching his knowledge of
the 122.000 of his brother's estate which has
mysteriously disappeared. He said he
feared to lay himself open to a prosecution
for felony should he tell what he knows.
He was given until to-morrow i to bunt up
authorities to support his position.
The case came before Judge Coffey yes
terday on a citation directing Gibson to
appear before Judge Coffey | and tell what
he knew of the money.' Soon after Charles
Gibson died Gibson's mother, now Mrs.
York, left, suddenly for Denver, taking
with her, it is* charged, the $22,000 which
composed the bulk of the estate.
Gibson does - not want to > tell what he
knows for the reasons given. Unless he
can show gooa Â authority to-day he
may be compelled to answer whether he
likes to or not. - :'''â¢'â .; ':':â _â  : : *

Secretary Mead of the Manufacturers' and
Producers', Association has sent a letter to the
Board â  of Trustees ; of _ Sacramento * requesting
that when they purchase the steam road-roller
they will let "the contract to a California

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.
YOUNG KEYES A MANIAC
His Mother Brought Him From
New York Only Last
Tuesday.
HIS INSANITY HEREDITARY.
The Published Accounts of the Affair
Magnified Out of All Proper
Proportion.
It not only appears now that the young
man named C. Keyes who was arrested
Tuesday evening by Detective Ben Boben
and Policeman Greenwaltin St. Mary's
alley is in no likelihood the celebrated
strangler whose operations have been so
mysterious, but. that the published ac
counts of the incident magnified it out of .
all proportions compatible with its im
portance. ;
The true details of the affair as given by
the girl May and her next-door neighbor
are as follows ,â¢; Ay; .-. . ?/ : : A
Shortly before 8 p. m. the young fellow
entered the den occupied by May. After

Seems Probable That the Youth Is Insane.

a short conversation he began to wander
restlessly up and down the apartment,
took off his hat and shoes and immedi
ately replaced them, then seated himself
and remarked :
"1 don't know of anything of value in
this life; everybody seems to be against
me."
"At this," said May, "the idea entered
my head that the fellow was crazy. I
edged toward the rear of the apartment.
I was not particularly frightened, nor did
I think him 'the straneler,' but thought it
best to be on the safe side.
"The fellow noticed this, but exhibited
no excitement whatever, merely saying in
a matter of fact tone:
'â¢'I guess :if you knew who am you
would get out of h ere.' y> y
"When he said this, I opened the door
that leads into my companion's compart
ments, stepped through, and closed and
bolted the door. Then I hurriedly told
her there was a crazy fellow in my room,
and she ran out to the . corner where De
tective Bohen was, and he returned with a
policeman and took the man away. That
is all there is to it."
The girl vigorously, denies that she
jumped out of the window, as stated in
certain . papers, or.that she . ran out the
back door and screamed, as was reported
to have been maintained by Detective
Bohen. Her version has the support of
her companion. ... , , '"
About 2 p. m. yesterday the stepfather
of Keyes, W. S. fiavely, who lives at 1921
Vallejo i street, called at the City Prison
and bad bim transferred to the Receiving
Hospital on the ground - that he has been
of unsound mind for some four years.
Havely says the boy's insanity is hered
itary, his father being similarly afflicted.
About twenty days ago his mother took
him to New York to have him' treated in
an asylum for mental weakness, but he
improved so much in the meantime that
she concluded to bring him home again.
They arrived in San Francisco Tuesday,
and it was on the evening of the same day
that he wandered into St. Mary's alley. .*
A few years ago he was taken round
Cape Horn and along the Atlantic sea
board in a sailing vessel, in hopes tbat a
sea voyage would benefit him, and it
seemed to do so, but recently he has grown
worse. '. '.:-."â 
The boy is young, only 19 years old,
dresses very stylishly, and is rather good
looking. The only features that would at
tract attention ; are the weak cast of the
mouth and the dull, staring expression of
the eyes.
He sits quietly in* his 'cell at the Receiv
ing Hospital and answers most questions
in monosyllables. Now and then he will
volunteer a sentence or two in a rambling,
incoherent style. When asked if he had
endeavored to frighten the woman he
answered "-.-â¢-.-'*; â  ;
"No; but she 'was . scared, because â¢ she
fainted In, the officer's arms." , . .
Of course she- did nothing of the kind.

Complaint to the Police.
Mrs. Rosie Kammarony, a midwife liv

ous complaint at police headquarters yes
terday. She said a well-dressed man
called at her place Tuesday; afternoon
about 4 o'clock and asked her if she would
perform an operation upon a girl 22 years
of age. She declined. The stranger of
fered her $10,000 to change her mind.
Finally he gave her a promissory note
for $2500, payable at the Crocker-Wool -

and told her he would return at 7 o'clock
for her answer. He returned punctually
on time and while talking to her he lifted
her purse, which lay on the table, and
coolly abstracted three half-dollars. Then
he walked out and she has not seen him

STERNBERG'S LAST HOPE
, â 
The Supreme Court Will Not
Allow Him a Re
hearing.
A Fair Prospect of Six Years in
Prison for the Registrar of
Stuffers. J..
There seems little more for Louis Stern
berg to do but to go to prison. Since soon
after the last election he has been being
tried in . the Superior Court and in the
Supreme Court on motions and on ap
peals and petitions for rehearing, but
with the dismissal of his last appeal his
chances, on one charge at least, seem
ended. *" : .
Stern berg was convicted on two charges
of procuring false registration. One was
for registering Dave Newman from the
Baldwin Hotel, when Newman at the time
lived in the suburbs. Sternberg was con
victed on this charge, and upon appeal
the Supreme . Court affirmed the convic
tion. An application for a rehearing was
asked, and the Supreme Court has replied
by dismissing 'his appeal. He has no
more to look for in that case but three
years in the State prison. ;".y
In the meanwhile another charge against
Sternberg had been running the gauntlet
of Superior and Supreme courts. He had
also | registered one A. Gutman, and he
was convicted on that | charge also. The
Supreme Court, however, looked with a
more ki ndly eye on that case, and he was
allowed a new trial. â¢ Judge Wallace had
not told the jurymen what corroborative
evidence was, nor bad he informed them
that they could look with suspicion upon
the evidence of an accomplice. The theory
of the Supreme Court was that the jury,
knowing that Samuel Lust was an ac
complice,, for it was so instructed, ne
glected to look with suspicion i upon his
testimony, and being in ignorance of the
terra "corroborative," they did understand
what testimony so designated was. ''':â :
; But the new trial was granted and ended
as its predecessor had i ended. Sternberg
was once more convicted. "â 'â  He moved ! for
a new trial and the question .was taken
under advisement, but delay was not what
Sternberg wanted. - He- wished to get his
case again before the Supreme Court.
And, again; if , he were sentenced for â¢ the
Gutman charge before * it â¢ was determined
whether or not the petition 1- for 1 a rehear
ing in the case would be granted' the sen
tence passed would have to take effect im
mediately, and then if the petition failed
the two sentences would have to run to
gether and the defendant would make just
three years i on 'â : the $ deal. { Judge Wallace,
however, refused to pass! upon the motion
for a new trial, , and without : saying : any
thing definite in tbe matter he has put it
over and over until now the Supreme
Court has rendered its decision.
>.'; Sternberg will come up for sentence to
morrow, and then j his j motion for Ia * new
trial will probably be denied and he will
be sentenced, the sentence to begin upon
the completion of : the one affirmed by the
Supreme Court, ..-â â â â â  .â  .â - â :,*â .,.â ,'.
WEAVER HOLDS HIS JOB.
The Majority in the Board . of
Health Fails to Remove
X Him. > .
DE. WILLIAMSON'S REPORT.
The Superintendent's Opponents Scored
for Their Stand in the i
- Matter. -
The three members of the Board of
Health who are opposed to Superintend
ent Weaver of the Almshouse made a last
desperate fight to oust the veteran official
yesterday and failed signally, Mayor Sutro
and Dr. Williamson standing firm and re
sisting every effort of Dr3. Hart, Morse
and Fitzgibbon to accomplish their pur
pose. â  * .. .
A special meeting was held to consider
the matter and when it had been called to
order Secretary Godchaux stated that he
had received a minority report from Dr.
Williamson and proceeded to read the
twenty-nine type-written pages it con
tained. l ' \ - '
. In the majority report submitted at the
last meeting Dr. Williamson was severely
criticized in the matter, and in his own
communication he did not hesitate to re
turn the compliment. In his introductory
remarks, while speaking of the treatment
accorded Superintendent Weaver during
the investigation; Dr. Williamson said:
; Here .was a man ! against whom accusation
after accusation had been heaped up, who was
not allowed to sit in the presence of those who
preferred the charges against him, but he was
placed upon- the witness-stand and over
whelmed with a volley of questions based upon
information lodged in the hands of this com
mittee before the investigation began. Even
counsel was denied him, so that he was left
completely defenseless, with no knowledge of
the statements which he would be subse
quently called upon to confront. Had not one
member of this committee taken the necessary
step not a single witness in favor of the super
intendent would have been called to the stand,
but, the case would have been decided entirely
upon the evidence of hostile witnesses. 1,
therefore, submitted to him such parts of the
evidence as in my opinion needed refutation
and explanation, and told him to take the
necessary steps to defend himself. i
In this 1 believe I was justified, and I chal
lenge criticism. In no way was any member
of this committee bound by oath, affirmation
or any compact whatever to keep inviolate
the proceedings of the inquiry, and if I have
erred In giving information to the accused for
the purpose of allowing him to make a de
fense, 1 admit the error and am willing to err
again under like conditions.
' When he came to his opponent's report
Dr. Williamson waxed eloquent.
1 have listened with interest to the scathing
philippic embodied in the report of the major
ity*, of this committee. I will compliment
those who have presented it on its masterly
eloquence and vigorous vituperation ; its bit
ter denunciations and caustic comments, and
beg leave to suggest that as a classic in def
amation of character it far surpasses the
Catalinian orations.
Stripped of its exaggerations and shorn of its
luxuriant verbiage it stands forth in bold re
lief, bearing upon its face the following accusa
tions : P. L. W eaver is a thief, a liar and a gen
erally disreputable character. The Almshouse
under his administration is a sink of iniquity
and a nest of corruption.* The reputation of its
superintendent has been a ragged in the mire,
and the mangled and distorted remains are
presented to your honorable board and through
you to the public.
A reputation that in the local commercial
world has been handed down untarnished for
the past twenty-live years is blackened and be
smirched in the interest of "clean politics" and
in demonstration of the principle that "to the
victors belong the spoils." *..- : Â».;
Dr. Williamson then reviewed the testi
mony at length and drew, the conclusion
that no misconduct _ ad been proven and
that the action of the . majority was
prompted by motives other than the good
of the taxpayers who support the Alms
house. v
Mayor Sutro heartily indorsed Dr. Wil
liamson's report and stated that after
hearing It, and in face of the recent Grand
Jury report, he could take no other course
than to vote against . Superintendent
Weaver's removal. -
On the negative votes of Dr. Williamson
and Mayor Sutro the opposition to Super
intendent Weaver was finally put at rest.
Drs. Williamson and Hart were ap
pointed a committee to draw up rules and
regulations for the management of the
Almshouse.
There has lately been much speculation
regarding, the origin of the word "tip."
The truth is that in an old English tavern
a receptacle for small coin was fixed in a
conspicuous place, over which' appeared
in , writing, "To insure promptness."
Whatever was placed in the box was
divided among the servants. Other taverns
followed tho example, and soon the words
were abbreviated to "T. I. P." Â

HOBART WON HANDS DOWN
Astride Ferrier the Wealthy-
Young Turfman .Easily, Dis- ,
posed of Old Logan.
SHIELDS A GOOD HORSEMAN.
Hello Took the Steeplechase -in a Hot
Drive With Esperanceâ All .
Over a Winner.
â¢ Races run with gentlemen riders in the
saddle appear to be quite 'the proper^ thing
in San Francisco at present. . I ' |
The triangular sweepstake at seven fur
longs announced for yesterday simmered
down to a duel between Ferrier and Logan,
Owner Sam Hildretb and Service declining
the issue. Ferrier, with his master, W. S.
Hobart, in the saddle, opened a 4 to 5 fa
vorite, and such a tremendous plunge was
made on him that he went to the post 9 to
20. The "iron horse," piloted by Owner
Alex Shields, opened at evens, going back
until 9 to 5 was laid. Both horses were
announced to carry 160 .pounds.. Mr. Ho
bart rode his horse with excellent judg
ment and in front from the jump won
easily by a couple of lengths in 1:31._.
The pretty fiancee of the young million
aire turfman viewed the race from a car
riage in the infield and applauded enthusi
astically as he passed the stand in advance
of the Canadian horseman.
Eight events were down for decision
and it was after 6 o'clock before the crowd
started for town. Nearly all of the en
tries were of the cbeap selling-plater va
riety and 5 the sport was not above medi
ocrity. Favorites took four races.
A five-and-one- half-furlong dash, with
twelve starters, opened the racing, and
was captured in a common canter by the
aged sprinter Hyman, a 5 to 1 shot in the
betting. Red Bird, starting al6to 5 sec
ond choice, made the running to the
stretch and finished a good third.
Faro had all kinds of speed yesterday
and romped away the . mile run that fol
lowed like a real stake horse. On his two
preceding essays there was considerable
"lobster" gossip mentioned in connection,
with the chestnut horse's name, and per
haps not without reason. ' :/
Starting at odds of 6 to 1, he had shaken
off Clara Johnson by the time the stretch
was reached and passed the wire the hand
iest of winners over j the ' 8 to 5 favorite,
imp. Fullerton Lass. Clara Johnson, who
was extensively played at odds of. 16 to 5.
was a good third, beaten half .a length by
the place horse. J "
The five-furlong scramble for two-year
olds was cleverly gathered in by the llto
'JO choice, Adam Andrew, who passed Lena
swinging into the stretch; and won easily
by three lengths in I:o4>^. . The last
named filly tired badly at the end, being,
passed by both Early Notice and Dolce,
the former getting tbe place by a length,
driving. '
There were five acceptances for the hand
icap steeplechase, the distance being about
two miles. Carrying 157 pounds Bell
ringer was sent to the post a 7 to 5 favorite,
but sulked before the sixth jump was
reached and fell out of it. Hello ridden
by T. Murphy then took the lead, and in a
hard drive through the stretch with Es
perance, ridden by W. Clancy, got the
decision by a head. April finished a good
third. _â _â  â ;" "*

inner, P. Archibald's blk. g., by
a "leadpipe" for All Over, who was held a
â 7 to 20 chance on the books, but he only
won by a neck in tbe hardest sort of a drive
with -Doubtful, \_who. led- from the start.
Une Que Amo was a fair, third. â¢
, "Holiest Dodd's horse, Mt. Air, gave
bettors a' hard shock in the seventh race, a
cheap five-and-a-half-furlong affair. He
went into the starter's hands a pronounced
3 to 2 favorite, but could do.no better than
finish an ordinary third, after looking a
winner at the head of the stretch: 5 In J a
hard drive Myron, who cut out the pace,
was beaten out a head by the 6 to 1 chance,
Hanford, ridden by Joe Piggott. ... , .
There was no pronounced choice for the
concluding event of the day, a mile run,
decided under selling conditions.: Around
post time both Charles A and Wawona
were held at fours, with Arno at 5 to 1
next in demand. Arno and-Wawona raced
away at a great clip ; when the bunch was
sent away,. showing their heels to the oth
ers until the stretch was reached. â¢ Charles
A here loomed up a dangerous factor, and
steadily working to the, front the black
horse reached the wire first, half a length
before Road Runner, who made a fine run
from the rear. Wawona, who grew weary
the last furlong, was lapped on the leader.
Track and Paddock 'ltems, _
Jack Richelieu, running in Sam Hil
dreth's colors, was a heavily played fa
vorite in the opening race, and he exhi
bited about as much speed as a dog with
a broken leg. . i : 1.:., .*.
Mike Bergen put up a good ride on the
outsider, Road ' Runner, in â¢ the last race.
The chestnut got away from the post two
lengths behind the field, but Mike perse
vered with him and at.the end was beaten
out but half a length by the winner.
In a letter to a friend in this City Arthur
Heinrichs writes, from St. Louis that he
will shortly leave for Baltimore, where he
will do the riding for a horseman named
Bird. The crafty and clever jockey evi
dently believes that a "bird in- the hand is
worth two in tne bush."
On Tuesday when the cranky jumper
Wag straddled the fence on his way to the
post, he was extricated from the unpleas
ant predicament and sent to the paddock,
all bets made on him being paid back.
Yesterday after Ginger had shaken Mack
lin from the saddle and made a circuit of
the track three times, finally being stopped
at tbe saddling paddock after jamming
her shoulder against the fence, she was
sent to the post in no condition to race.
There was' a good stiff play on her, and if
bets were returnable in the Wag case there
was no just reason why the rule should
not apply as well with Ginger. Macklin
pulled the mare up when the barrier was
passed, and the coin bet on her was sim
ply "burnt up." bookmakers have enough
the best end of it now without rulings
being given in their favor.
Philosopher Earl Cochran's ride on Ra
pido, the second choice in the seventh
race, did not suit the judges, and he stands
suspended pending further investigation.
The sudden reversal of form shown by
Faro was altogether too startling, and at a
meeting held by " the board of stewards
at the conclusion of the racing it was de
cided to accept no more entries from A. Y.
Stephenson. The horse who, was entered
to be sold for $100, was' bid up $10 by an
outsider and owner Stephenson let him
go. The stewards did not believe toe sale
to be a bona-fide one and the entry of Faro
will in future be rejected.
Dolce, the sister to Crescendo, made a
much better showing yesterday than on
her previous essays. She fell out of it
soon after the start, but made a game run
through the stretch, finishing a good
third.- .

his chariot, but there is living, breathing
testimony at hand that the president of Po
lice Court 1 is an expert from the price of
a bike â in installmentsâ tn the riding of
the gleaming steed of steel.
H. M. Hafford, a bicycle-teacher, who
had been arrested, charged with stealing a
wheel, was examined yesterday before
Judge Campbell. He had rented the ma
chine from T. H. B. Varney last month
and pawned it at the North End Loan
Office, on Washington street, near Mont
gomery. Hafford had been unable to raise
the $17 50 and interest due on his pledge
and a detective from the cyclery bore the
bike away to the City Hall. Incidentally,
Hafford was borne to the same locality
and was lodged in a orison cell next to the
property-room, where reposed the wheel
upon which he had speeded to his own
undoing.
The prisoner came into court without an
attorney and Judge Campbell, out of sym
pathy for the luckless biker, charitably
undertook, without interfering with his
functions as the Judge in the case, to help
the young fellow.
The accused had never seen Judge Camp
bell minus the ermine and dlus the
bloomer, and consequently could not know
that his Honor was as aDIe in the saddle
as on the bench. He took issue on several
points wifi his judicial counsel.
"My client won't agree with me," said
the Judge stilly. "Call the bicycle as the
first witness!"
The machine was tumbled into the court
room by an officer.who scraped the skin off
his own shin at every revolution of the
right pedal, and leaned it up against the
witness-stand, where it stood under the
admiring gaze of the Judge.
The question of its value was argued pro
and con without any agreement until his
Honor stepped down from the bench and j
made an examination. He lifted the bi- I

William McCracken InsUted on Taking
a Forged Check in Security for
a Debt.
Bayard Saville is before Judge Belcher
for forgery and the testimony against him
shows the peculiar case of a man who in
sisted on being victimized despite Saville's
objections.
The charge of foreery rests upon a check
on the Bank of California for $650 made by
Mrs. Teresa Bell in favor of Bayara Saville
and indorsed by him. William McCracken
is the complaining witness and he mourns
the loss of $50. From the evidence it ap
pears that Saville borrowed $30 at one time
and $20 at another from McCraeKen. and
he offered to write a personal check for the
amount on a Santa Rosa bank. Mc-
Cracken had seen the Bell check, however,
and said he would take that and send the
extra $000 to Saville when he had cashed
it. Saville objected, but finally gave the
check and when McCracken offered it at
the bank lie was told it was a forgery.
Saville's defense will be that there is a
conspiracy against him to railroad him to
the penitentiary. The writing and signature
on the check are not in the least like Mrs.
Bell's writing and the forgery, if it be one,
is a very poor one. Mrs. Bell is the widow
of the late Thomas Bell.

CAN`T BUILD THE DEPOT.
Harbor Commissioners .Will Be
Enjoined From Using
Colusa Stone.
IRON FRAMEWORK WON'T WAIT
With the Law's Delay a Skeleton of
Steel Will Be the Ferries
Station for Years.
The prospect of a great > frame of steel
and iron rising far above the sheds that
now constitute the ferries depot. That is
among the possibilities of the near future.
: A huge, gaunt thing, with upright col
umns and row after row of horizontal
girders and steel beams. A skeleton of
iron on tne verge of the bay. And worst
of all in this prospect it may stand for
yearsâ a monument to the law's delay.
For the grand new structure is menaced
by legal complications, and since there is
no telling how long it may be until the
process through Superior and Supreme
courts is concluded, two or more years
may pass with the metal framework still
staring people from all points of view in
and about San Francisco.
This may be but a mere possibility after
all, although in the opinion of more than
one Harbor Commissioner it will be re
ality.
The trouble which makes it so comes
from a conflict in opinions over the stone
to be used in the depot building. Noth
ing short of a lawsuit will settle the diffi
culty, and the beginning of this contest is
already at hand.
Proceedings looking to the enjoining of
the Harbor Commission from using Colusa
stone will be begun to-day, to-morrow, or
at least as soon as the necessary documents
shall have been prepared for filing in the
Superior Court of this City and County.
A notification of the contest was given
yesterday to the attorney of the Harbor
Commissioners, who in turn informed
Commissioner Colnon.
S When the specifications were drawn up
in accordance with the architect's ideas it
was practically decided that Oregon gray
stone, such as is used in the facade of the
Parrott building, should be employed in
facing the depot structure. The Commis
sioners, however, entertained different
views of this particular matter.
They thought that California could fur
nish a stone quite good enough for a State
building. Of course, relative merits of
building stone was one thing, the patri
otic Californian spirit another. But the
Commissioners were specially cautious.
They retained an expert and had him
examine several varieties of building
stone, including the importation from
Oregon, with the result that Colusa stone
was found to be most desirable. It had a
nice soft color, qualities of great endur
ance under the action of air and rain, and,
in fine, the attributes of building stone
that should last through ages. Colusa
stone was selected by the commission as
the material for the facade ot the ferries
depot.
When the decision was made a member
of the law firm of Reddy, Campbell &
Metson appeared before the board in the
capacity of a citizen. 'â He entered his
protest as such against the board's action,
and argued that Oregon stone should be
used as required by the specifications.
This, protest was the first inkling of a
suit at law over the stone for the building.
It was all but forgotten until a representa
tive of the same firm announced yester
day that injunction proceedings against
the Harbor Commission would be started
at once in the interest of the Oregon
people.
The commission might look for it to
day, or Friday. . :r . . .y,:-'Ay^
Meanwhile the contractors for the iron
framework are busy manufacturing the
columns and girders. : Their contracts
make it imperative that the iron shall be
delivered and constructed before a date
net far off now, and no matter what takes
place to d-day progress of erection in the
departments, the iron men are determined
to lose no time in completing their part of
the work. Already several loads of col
umns have been 'delivered at the foot of
Market street, and others are expected to
follow daily. Then, as soon as enough
material is upon the ground, a force of
men will begin to raise the iron skeleton.
. A few months more and the last rive
will have been closed on the top beam and
the sound cf the hammer may cease upon
the depot for a long time.
With the dispute over the stone in court
and an injunction in effect against laying
Colusa stone, it is feared that obstructive
methods may be resorted to. Delays can
be secured on one pretext or another in
the Superior Court that would easily cause
proceedings to drag for a year or more.'
After that would come the trial, then an
appeal, more delay in preparation of the
case to the higher tribunal, and, with a
docket far in arrear, it might be two years
more before a decision would be handed
down. - [A'AAA'i'-y â¢ â¢â - \--a
The Commissioners dread the delay
which now seems inevitable, and look to
the Manufacturers' Association and other
public bodies to create a sentiment which
would tend ; to expedite the case in the
courts.

Promptly Effectual In Curing Crip,
Colds and Coughs and a Sure
Preventive of Pneumonlaand All

Colds lead to coughs, coughs to Pneu-
monia and Consumption; therefore, it is
all important to check a cold before it
reaches the lungs. Munyon's Cold Cure
â  will positively break a cold . inside of
twenty -four hours if taken as soon as the
cold manifests itself. When the cold
reaches the lungs or bronchial tubes the
Cough Cure should be used alternately
every half hour with the Cold Cure. The
Cold Cure is guaranteed to prevent pneu-
monia if used in the beginning of a cold.
Pneumonia, or inflammation of the lungs,
can be controlled by the use of these two
cures. . .
The Cough Cure positively cures bron-
chitis, tickling in the throat, hoarseness,
loss of voice, soreness of the chest, diffi-
culty in breathing, hacking cough and all
pulmonary diseases where the lungs are
not too far consumed or covered with
tubercles. . A. ,_> " -
If you are ailing, step into : the nearest

yon's Remedies' No matter what your
disease, or how many doctors have failed
to cure, it will give you relief.

9.00 a. m. Sunday. -Point Reyes ana Waystatloa*POLICE COURTS
ARE UNDER FIRE
The Grand Jury Has Be
gun a Rigid Investi
gation.
FINES GOING WRONG.
Funds That Have Never Found
Their Way Into the City
Treasury.
CAREFUL EXPERTS AT WORK.
Judges, Clerks and Attorneys Wili
Be Called Upon for Testimony
TcMorrow.
"When the Grand Jury assembles to-mor
row for its regular semi- weekly session
the officials of two of the four Police
Courts will probably be called to explain
If they can certain transactions which
have come under the observation of the
jury, and which are deemed worthy of the
strictest investigation.
Sine, the present Grand Jury began the
exercise of its duties numerous intima
tions have been received that the amount
of collected in Police Courts 2 and 4
would not tally with the sums turned into
the City treasury for the use of the munici
pal government. *,:_.,â¢
It was said that in cases where fines of
$20 or .30 were assessed on offenders con
victed of petty crimes only $10 ana in
many cases but $5 was sent to the treas
ury, and that the difference was diverted
into the pockets of those who had no right
to the same.
Just previous to its recent vacation the
jury began an investigation of the matter
and sent its expert to look into the books
of the County and check them up with the
accounts in the Treasurer's office.
It is expected that the results of these
investigations will soon be made known.
They have been kept secret quite success
fully so far, but yesterday it was stated
that even a worse condition ol affairs than
was anticipated has been found and that
many cases were discovered where fines of
from $5 to $25 had been collected and no
returns whatever made to the custodian
of the public funds.
The fact that the expert misunderstood
to a certain extent the orders of Foreman
Moskey of the Grand Jury in relation to
the matter, and took a more roundabout
way than was necessary to ascertain the
facts needed to pin the matter down to
the proper parties, seems to have retarded
the investigation somewhat, but enough
information has been gained, it is said, to
warrant the belief that an important lead
has been struck, and the matter will be
sifted to the bottom. Thus far no effort
has been â¢ made to ascertain tbe total'
amount of money that is said to have been
diverted from its proper channels, but it is
believed to be large enough to bring the
offenders within the jurisdiction of the
Grand Jury, and, should an adequate ex
planation not be forthcoming, indictments
are expected to be brought.
: Judge Low and his clerk of Police Court
4 and Judge Conlan and Clerk Morganstern
of Police Court _. with the possible addition
of the attorneys of both courts, will be
called to cast as much light as possible on
the whereabouts of the money the Grand
Jury is interested in.
No suspicion attaches to either of the
Judges, as they are not supposed to han
dle the money assessed in fines, but there
private records are expected to aid mate
rially, by comparisons with the court rec
ords, in throwing light on the mystery.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Richard Mansfield Appears in
"Prince Karl" at the
Baldwin.
Mrs. Auzerais-Hoyte Is Proving an
Attraction at the Alca
zar.
. The performance at the Baldwin Thea
ter last night was "Prince Karl." which
offers the versatile Richard Mansfield an
opportunity of shining in a totally differ
ent line of character from "Rodion, the
Student." "Prince Karl" will be played
to-morrow and Friday evenings and at the
Saturday matinee. ".___
The repertoire for Richard Mansfield's
last week, commencing next Monday
night, will be as follows: Monday, Tues
day and Saturday night?, "A Parisian
Romance"; Wednesday, "The Story of
Rodion, the Student" ; Thursday, "Beau
Brummell" ; Friday (only time). "The
Scarlet Letter"; Saturday matinee,
"Prince Karl."
> Roland Reed's breezy impersonation of
"The Politician," at the California Thea
ter, is being greeted with large houses and
considerable applause.
The announcement is made that Prim
rose & West's white and black minstrels
and the only George Wilson will appear at
the California Theater following Roland
Reed. The minstrels open Monday, May 4.
"A Pair of Kids" is affording plenty of
amusement to Columbia Theater aud
iences, and Ezra Kendall, the kids' papa,
is as provocative of laughter as ever.
To-morrow afternoon Mrs. Mabel Jen
ness Venter will deliver at the Columbia
Theater her lecture, entitled "Artistic
Dress.and the Vulgarisms We See in So
ciety." Mrs. Venter will show during the
lecture the new costumes that have lately
been designed in London and Paris.
This morning the sale of seats will be
gin for the Rivarde season of concerts to
be given at the Columbia Theater, com
mencing with Monday evening next.
There will be six concerts in allâ Mon
day. Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
matinee and on Sunday night. It will be
the first appearance here of Rivarde, the
Spanish violinist, wno will be assisted by
Aime Lachaume and William H. Keith.
Mrs. Auzerais-Hoyte has proved quite
the attraction of the season at Grover's
Alcazar. Her debut has been looked upon
as quite a social event among her friends
and acquaintances, and the public, which
has beard a great deal about â¢ her, has
E roved itself anxious to see and hear Miss
[oy te on the stage. >i9Bi
The debutante bears herself gracefully
and easily and looks charming. The sup
port afforded by Grover's company is ex
cellent.
' "Special Delivery" affords the company
at the Grand an opportunity of showing
its versatility by the performance of a
number of "turns" of the vaudeville
order. All the introduced songs and
dances are well received and many of them
arouse encores. .
"Special Delivery" itself is a sparkling
comedy-drama, which is excellently
staged. -.; yy â "â '::-â Â«â '.
This evening a special performance of
"Blue Beard" will be given at the Tivoli
Opera-house entitled "Hotel Men's Night."
when oVer 250 of the visiting bonifaces
will attend. A special souvenir will be
prepared for them. . â â  â â 
The Rossand Brothers are making quite
a furore at the Orpueum. People are will
ing to stand in line and even go seatless at
last in order to see the little fellows . go
through their "cute prize fight. The little
midgets are graceful mannikins and do
not presume on their diminutive stature
to give an inferior performance.
Their act is the only really star "turn"
given by the Hopkins Company, though
several of the performers do some clever
things.
The Namedo Brothers' act with the
dummy would be more effective if the
audience knew beforehand that the appar
ently inanimate thing was alive.
On Monday evening next at the Aud
itorium there will be the first appearance
here of Professor Bristol's horse show, in
cluding the thirty trained horses, mules
and donkeys, whose capacity for tricks
is said to be unlimited.
GEO. A. NEWHALL ELECTED
Official Result of the Pacific-
Union Club's Con
test.
Committee Appointed to Change the
System of Electing
Officers.
As foreshadowed in yesterday's Call
onl.v one director of the nine on the Paci
fic-Union Club ticket was chosen in Tues
day's election. The candidates voted for
were: Winfield S. Keyes, John W. C.
Maxwell, Charles A Grow, Evan J. Cole
man. Bernard Faymonville, George T.
Mayre, Clark W. McAfee. Eusebius J.
Molera, George A. New hall. .
Had nine directors been chosen the new
board would have organized yesterday
and elected a president, but as only George
A. Newhall was chosen another election
must take place.
The members of the progressive ele
ment, who did not care to introduce an
opposition ticket," made their influence
felt by practically defeating the regular
ticket, j Now it is reported that there is to
be a complete change in the classification
of directors and the system of club elec
tions. A committee was appointed night
before last to provide for a board of seven
members to be elected annually.
When the next election takes place the
leaders of the progressive element will put
a ticket in the field and under the banner
of progress rally all who are in favor of a
permanent club home owned and not hired
by tbe club. No fault is found witn the
present site overlooking Union square and
near the principal business thoroughfares
of the City, but there is a strong objection
to paying rent for leased premises. Ad
vocates of progress argue that the leading
clubs of the world no longer occupy rented
houses, ..but- dwell in establishments
de7oted exclusively to club purposes. â¢ â¢ ,
The Pacific-Union, they assert" cannot
plead poverty, as its members are wealthy
and its resources ample to maintain a
clubhouse of modern grandeur. Some
time in the future the changes contem
plated must be made, hence many hold
that the first steps should now be taken.
The old-timers, who constitute the con
servative element of the club, will resist
up-to-date innovations. The present pros
pects please them. Club life to their way
of thinking is happy enough when the
best dinners obtainable are served and the
easiest chairs ever devised are placed with
in reach.
While the old-timers are not likely to
get excited by this agitation for -progress
they will rally to defend the existing quiet
and luxury.
The indications therefore promise an ex
citing campaign and a red-hot election in
the usually quiet precinct of the Pacific-
Union Club. The new method of select
ing officers is almost sure to provide that
the president shall be chosen by a direct
vote of the members. The strength and
boldness displayed by the progressive ele
ment in the election last Tuesday give as
surance that a progressive ticket from top
to bottom will be placed in the field.
Fireworks at Haight Street.
On pleasant weekday afternoons and even
ings the Chutes on Haight street are well pat
ronized, especially by family parties. new
departure will be taken on Saturday evening,
when an elaborate display of fireworks which
will excel any previous exhibition given on
the grounds will take place. A number of set
pieces are in process manufacture and many
surprises are promised.
Baron Hirsch Memorial.
Special memorial services will be held at the
Bush-street Temple in the near future m mem
ory of Baron Hirsch. Rabbi Julius Fryer will
deliver the eulogy and Cantor Meyerson is pre
paring a musical service. .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.
FREUD ON THE CHARTER
Makes at Richmond an Eloquent
Appeal for the New In
strument.
ONE HUNDRED REASONS GIVEN
A Condition of Affairs Almost Upotian
Promised Under Its Do
minion. _
'â¢â  - . '

MME. SORBIER'S PERIL
She Is Chased and Threatened
by Mary Hallacy, a Crazy
Woman.
It Tock Three Policemen to Over
power the Woman and Lock
Her Up.
Mme. - Sorbier, â¢ the well-known phil
anthropist of 220 Van Ness avenue, had a
narrow escape from being roughly treated
by an insane woman last evening.
She is the president of the Woman's
Educational and Industrial Union, 7 Van
Ness avenue. Its object is to help work
ing women in various ways.
About three months ago Ma ry Hallacy,
an unmarried woman, about 48 years of
age, was provided with a room at the
union until a situation was procured for
her with Mrs. J. C. Jordan, 533 Harrison
street, as a laundress.
In a few weeks she reimbursed the union
for her room and board, and nothing more
was heard of her till Monday, when she
went to the union and demanded a room
again. Miss Trouett, the manager, seeing
that the woman was evidently crazy, | de
clined to accommodate her, 'and she told
her she had done up a woman and would
do her up the same way unless she got a
room. She refused to leave the place, but
finally rushed out as some one entered.
She returned on Tuesday and made a
disturbance because she 'â  was refused ad
mittance. Yesterday afternoon she went
back and became so violent that Miss
Trouett allowed her to enter. * ,
She said she had walked the streets for
three nights and needed a rest.' Miss
Trouett telephoned to the Central Police
Station for a policeman, but she was told
they could do nothing unless a warrant
was sworn out for her arrest.
'â â '- Miss Trctiftt then telephoned for Mme.
Sorbier. who had a. talk with the woman,
and told Miss: Trouett to go to St. Mary's
Hospital and arrange to have her taken
there, if possible. While Miss Trouett was
cone the woman again ; became very vio
lent, and ; Mme. ;_._ Sorbier, becoming
alarmed, went; out and sat on the front
porch. - Mary came . out after her - and
grasped her. fiercely : by the arm, telling
her to come inside and see the funny
things on the walls. â  y ;
*, The madame broke away from her and'
ran. ; There 'â¢. were y only three â¢' ladies ;in
sight, and she ran toward them, pursued
by Mary. , The ; madame was dodging
round - the i three ladies â to elude Mary's
grasp, when Policeman Brownlie " ap- i
peared. He grabbed hold of Mary, but as
she is a powerful woman, he had all he
could do to bold â  her. Sh. 'tore - his right
hand with* her teeth, and was fighting
him with all her strength when two other
policemen Â came â â : upon the . scene. . "â  It re
quired their combined -strength to over*,
power her till the handcuffs j were put on
her. Then she was -taken â¢;.' to \ the City
Prison A and - later to the Receiving Hos
pital, here she : was locked -upin a
padded cell. _'.'â '--_"
'Madame Sorbier's nerves were consider
ably shaken by the fright.
CASSASA STILL WANTED.
The Defaulting Collector Was
Given Far Too Long a
* Start.
A YEAR'S INVESTIGATION.
The Italian Benevolent Society Has
Suffered Long an_ Was
Kind.
There seems little hope that the Italian
Mutual Benevolent Society will ever again
see either A. Cassasa, its absconding col
lector, or the three thousand eight hun
dred odd dollars belonging to the society
which disappeared with him.
The warrant issued for Cassasa's arrest
and the instructions issued to the Sheriff
of Santa Rosa County to employ detectives
if necessary have not had the effect of
bringing Cassasa from his lair, and all the
people who have studied the case say that
if the defaulting cashier is not far away
from the power of the law by this time it
is not the fault of the long-suffering, much
forgiving Societa Italiana di Mutua Bene
ficenzia.
'â Billy" Cuneo, one of the bondsmen
who believed implicitly in the untarnished
quality of . Cassasa's honor, and who loses
$500 by his defalcation, observed yester
day with frank candor, "We wanted to see
justice done, but 1 do not think any of us
.were desirous to have Cassasa/ put in the
dock, for an investigation would have fol
lowed and that would have shown very
plainly that we had all made fools of our
selves." , A : : VyA'A"A' : : '
There is a good deal of talk in the
Italian colony over the flight of Cassasa
and there are some mutterings of a de
mand for an investigation. *
The history of Cassasa's defalcations
began about a year ago. The Italian
Mutual Benevolent Society averages about
800 members, each of whom pays $12 a
year, and in return receives, relief ana
medical attendance in sickness, etc. The
expenses in medicine and doctors and hos
pital fees are heavy and about a year ago
F. Cavagnaro, the treasurer, noticed that
not enough money was coining into the
treasury to defray running expenses.
The paid secretary, B. Morone, was not
able to give any accounts, and Cavagnaro,
suspecting something was wrong, . de
manded the appointment of an auditing
committee. Cassasa, when summoned to
appear before the board, pleaded sickness
and inability to collect, but an auditing
committee was appointed, consisting of F.
Cavagnaro, G. L. Peri and L. di Grazia.
The auditing committee looks its own
time, which proved to be months. The
end of the year bad been reached and Cas
sasa had been re-elected for '96 by the
subscribers before the committee repoited
the amount of his defalcations.
Even then he was not removed from his
position, but continued to harvest the dol
lars of the subscribers till early in March,
when he resigned, or was made to resign,
and another collector was appointed. By
that time he owed the society over $3800.
From that time on Cassasa temporized
and was granted more and more time by.
the board. A meeting was held on the 2d
inst., at which the auditing committee was
instructed to secure a warrant for his ar
rest that night if he did not immeaiately
refund the last $500 he had collected. *
The order was not obeyed, Cavagnaro
stating at the succeeding meeting that he
had wished to swear out the warrant, but
that Peri and Di Grazia had been in favor
of granting more time. On the 13th inst.
Cassasa wrote from Santa Rosa, stating
that he was at the ranch of his brother, D.
Cassasa, and was still examining his
books. The probability is that his friends
telegraphed to him that even the extraor
dinarily patient Societa Italiana di Mutua
Beneficenzia considered that ' patience had
ceased to be a virtue, for that letter was
the last heard of him. i
But the society still seemed to have. a
faith that was child-like and bland in its
collector. He bad promised to attend the
second board meeting of the month. The
meeting came, but Cassasa did not, and
then the officers resolved to take action.
A warrant was sworn out and instructions
were wired, the Sheriff of Sonoma
County to capture the defaulter at all
costs. It was too late, however; the bird
had flown, and now the people who suffer
by Cassasa's defalcation are asking why
he was treated so leniently.
Some subscribers blame President Kala
for not informing the board of the state of
things, others blame the secretary; and
the auditing committee comes in for a
share of the censure. "Billy" Cuneo and
C. Calegaris, the two bondsmen, have
not yet received any official notification of
Cassasa's defalcation. Had they done so
it is probable that more active steps would
have been taken for his arrest. . At.
INSURANCE CHANGES.
A Number of General Agencies of
Companies in This City to
Be Removed.
The sharp rate war which has been go
ing on among the insurance companies
here for the last year has brought about a
number of upheavals and changes in some
of the agencies here.
After the Ist of next month the general
office of the Continental of New York will
be withdrawn from this City and trans
ferred to Chicago. A local agency will,
however, be retained, with J. W. Maxwell
in charge.
' It is thought that the old Pacific Bank
property and other holdings will be sold,
as it is not tbe intention of the company
to make any improvements or investments
in San Francisco.
The Phoenix of Brooklyn, Brown, Craig
& Co., 407 Montgomery street, is contem
plating a , change in which they will
abolisn their general agency on this coast
and be represented by local agents report
ing directly to headquarters. The firm of
Brown, Craig & Co., after a partnership of
eighteen yeasr, will be dissolved.
It is expected that Vice-President J. H.
Mitchell of the Phoenix of Hartford and
V. P. Snow of the Home of New York will
arrive here in a few days. These two com
panies, which act â¢ together ; and which are
represented ; here : by Arthur - E. Magill,
have been the principal obstacle to a pro
posed insurance compact and it is believed
that the presence of the two officers will in
some manner bring a change in the Phoe
nix-Home policy. Â»
â  The fire losses' on the Pacific Coast dur
ing the first quarter of last year approxi
mating $1,000,000, and the fact that premi
ums rule 25 per/ cent ; less than twelve
months I ago 'â¢ has :: had much to do with
bringing about the present situation.
Harry Stenart Arrested.
;a. Harry. Steuart, night clerk in the Prescott
House, 933 Kearny , street, was arrested ; last
evening by Policeman J. Rainsbury on a war
rant sworn ; to by ft. 11. Palmer,' and detained
at the California-street station on a charge of
grand larceny. Later in the evening Sleuart's
employers procured his release by depositing
a bond in the sum of $1000 with the; station
keeper. Palmer, the complaining witness, al
leges that last Tuesday evening, in collusion
with a woman of bis acquaintance, the clerk
was | partly responsible for the surreptitious
removal of $100 from his pocket.
; The Sultan ;of Turkey is believed to be
consumed by a morbid fear. He never at
tends the mosque without something like
a corps d'armee being ordered out. In the
warmest weather he always rides with the
hood of his carriage up, and he .sits i well
back, guarded against bullets by a fat aid
de-camp, who sits on the front seat, and
by two obese generals, who walk on either
side of the carriage.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, cf melted sr.ow in inches and hui.dredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
line:;, conned points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word ierli*' means high laroinetric pressure and
is usually a'ceomcanied by fair weaiher: "low"
r< f.i-s to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and aceonip mied by Bloody weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Wh-n the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a â¢high" in ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 22.-At the Stock
Exchange to-day there was a further expansion in
the volume of business, the sales aggregating
265,000 shares. The. temper of the speculation
was bullish, all hough' at the start the bears ham
mered the market on the strength of lower quota
tions from London and the receipt of selling orders
from that center. The greatest decline was in
Manhattan, which fell IV_ to 109 on the passage
by the Assembly of the three-cent fare bill." For
the same reason Metropolitan Traction declined 1
to 100. In the remainder of the list the losses
varied from 1/2 to 3,4 per cent, the latter in sugar.
The comparatively slight' recession brought in
# numerous buying orpers and a rally quickly en
' sued. During the afternoon the Vanderbilt shares
led the market. There was free buying of New
York Central, Lake Shore and Canadian Southern
by firms who usually do business for the Vander
bllts. The advance of %_} on this group gave
encouragement to the bulls, who commenced to
bid in prices all around. sugar sold up 1% to
1261/8- Western Union, Missouri Pacific, Consoli
dated Gas, the Grangers, Lackawanna, Distillers,
. American Cotton Oil, Reading and Wheeling and
Lake Erie were all prominent, rising V_@3 per
cent, "
The demand for the last named was stimulated
by the announcement by President Blair that the
company had secured business for the. season
which will tax the capacity of the road, including
the new equipment ordered early in the year.
Taken altogether, the dealings were unusually well
distributed and tbe feeling is decidedly bullish. The
market closed strong at or near the best figures of
the day. Net changes show gains of Vi to 2V_ per
cent. Lackawanna leading. Manhattan lost "â  _ Â»no
Metropolitan Traction 1 per cent of the diy.
Bonds were active and strong, the transactions

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., April 22.â Nothing having In
tervened to alter the brilliant prospects of the win
ter wheat crop and the Weather Bureau's issue of
Its weekly bulletin having confirmed the reports
of improvement in all sections, holders of wheat re
sumed their sales at the opening this morning,
and continued them with greater or less determi
nation during the session. Liverpool quoted a de
cline of %@34d. Receipts in the Northwest were
381 cars against 349 last Wednesday and 225 a
year ano. Chicago had five cars, and Inspected out
134,416 bushels. The tone at the opening was
easy, prices dropping over %c from yesterJa- 's
close in the first few' minutes, after which they
steadied under covering of short wheat, and made
a slight recovery. Export clearances were ex
tremely moderate at 94,1446 bushels. Closing Con-
I tinental cables showed declines, varying in Im
portance. During ihe last hour on some profes
sional buying, possibly for(Â» mo lerate t im, prices
rallied further. July wheat opened from b4!J/gc to
64V 8 c sold between 64%@64S/ 8 c and 63% c, clos
ing at 65y B (a)64i4c. %&VÂ«c under yesterday. Jis
lima ed receipts for to-morrow 10 curs.
CORNâ Participated in the easy feeling which
assailed wheat at the star*, afterward recovering
in part the early loss. Trade was neglected, the
greater activity of wheat absorbing the interest of
operators. Receipts were 198 cars and 27 3,3:6
bushels were withdrawn from store. Liverpool
cables quoted %d decline. Export clearances ag
gregated it04,2M1 bushels. May corn opened at
29iÂ£c. sold at -'93 c, closing at 29% c, unchanged
1 from yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
300 cars.
OATSâ Were inactive and uninteresting." On ac
count of its lifeless condition this market did not
invite attention, and beyond the usual trading by
specialists scarcely anything was done. Receipts
were 174 cars and 1000 bushels were withdrawn
from store. May oats closed a shade under yester
day. Estimated receipts for to-morro.v 170 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady; casli, 92c: May, 88% c;
July, 91c bid; September, 938/4 c. Receipts 13 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The hog martlet was visited with
an oversrpply this morning, the effect being seen
' in a decline in prices at the yards and through that
a depreciation in product. A recovery in sympathy
with wheat took place, Dut the full appreciation
wis not sustained. May pork, lard and ribs each
closed 2%c lower.
BUTTERâ The butter market was weak to-day.
Receipts were liberal and there was no improve
ment to the demand. Creameries, extras, li-i^c.
EGGSâ Were easy. The demand was distinc
tively local. The offerings were fair. Fresh stock,
9C<Â£9%c. ; ,
MONEYâ Was easy at 6% on caH and 6@7% on
time loans. New York exchange sold at 75c

THE STOCK MARKET.
Yesterday was a livelier day thr.n usual in min
ing stocks, both Comstocks and Bodies advancing
under active trading. Occidental rose to $1 40 and
the other Comstocks were higher nil around. Bodte
sold up to 50c and Bulwer to 42c, the latter stock
being particularly active. . . Â.â ' y.i
The close was lower, as will be seen below.
â¢On the bond exchange business continued
active. San Francisco Gas advanced to $93 60 and
Edison to: *119 50, both being sharp advances.
Giant Powder rose from $21 50 to $28.
. The superintendent of the Grant mine reports
that the third tunnel has advanced over 4 feet the
past week, being now ' nearly 150 feet in length.
The quartz is darker, looking better and carries
more sulphurets. '* **- '.-.'-."A-
The Virginia Chronicle has the following about
Occidental Consolidated : Three feet of rich gold
or* was opened in the Occidental mine on Friday
night in the west drift on the 750 level. The ore
assays over $100 a ton In gold, and the streak
may. prove a bonanza when developed. The dis
covery is very important and very encouraging. It
was made in the ledge at a point 100 feet below
the spot where the ore was discovered on the 650
level some time ago, and is a downward I continu
ation of that ore. The lowest assay jof the ore
showed a value of $80 and the highest run into the
hundreds.
No developing work has been ; done on the ore
since the strike was made, but the chance for the
ore to spread out from the face of the drift Is good.
Indications favor the belief that a big body of ore
of considerable if not great- richness may yet be
opened possibly in the near future In the Occiden
tal mine. There is great scope in , the mine for an
ore deposit of large dimensions, as is shown by the
fact that three excellent showings of ore are now
in evidence at three widely divided points. .' The
two developments above : spoken 'of are 100 ' feet
apart, one on the 660 and one on the 750
level, and the ore still has room 'to go
down indefinitely. Â« And there are two feet
of $27 gold ore showing in .' the south \ drift
on the 605 level, 180 feet south;of the first named
development. That it is not probable that a
bonanza of gold ore will be found In the > unopened
ground between and outside of these points cannot
be said. The signs of ore in the Occidental just
now are particularly encouraging, and if the mine
does not show up a body of ore before long many
people will be disappointed. . .
The Alaska-Mexican Mining Company of Doug
las island. Alaska, has declared a quarterly divi
dend of 10 cents per share, or $18,000, payable on
the 28th. The Alaska Treadwell dividend of $76,
--000 will be paid on the same day.
â  The American Tobacco Company has declared a
dividend of 2 per cent, payable May 1.
The Boston and Montana Mining Company has
declared a dividend of $2 per share, payable
May 20. . -.-'. .:.- .

Manager Kruttschnitt Denies
Many Rumors of West
Oakland.
ARE ENLARGING THE PLANT.
A Statement That Will Help Greatly
to Restore Confidence in the
West End.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,_
908 Broadway, April 22. )
West Oakland is not to be deserted by
the railroad. Although Manager Krutt
schnitt did not mention the future plans
of the Southern Pacific Railroad at the
meeting of the West Oakland Improve
ment Club last night he has since ex
pressed himself very clearly on that im
portant matter.
"I had supplied myself with some data
from Mr. Wilder,'' said Mr. Kruttschnitt
to-day, "expecting to be asked about West
Oakland. We are employing more men at
the shops now than we did five years ago,
though times are not so good now as they
were then. The amount of wages which
we pay monthly to the employes in Oak
land is about $140,000. This amounts to
over $1,600,000 a year. The shops in Oak
land, as everywhere else, are increasing in
size owing to the increase of the business
of the company. We have before this
been obliged to hold back increasing our
shops owing to the dull times.
"The story that we are contemplating
the removal of our shops from Oakland is
one of the strangest stories I have ever
heard. I can't imagine where it started.
There is no foundation for it. As an ac
tual fact, a small increase in size is being
built to the Oakland shops. This is being
done on the recommendation of Mr. Wilder
and Mr. McKenzie, because it is impossi
ble to do the work required with the
present accommodations. This addition
will result in giving three additional en
gine-stall to the machine-shop for the re
pair of locomotives. I cannot tell, off
hand, the number of locomotives repaired
in the Oakland shops, but it is very large.
Leaving out the shops at Sacramento and
Algiers, which are the two big terminals
of the Southern Pacific, 1 think the shop.
of Oakland come next in the number of
men.
"We have no idea of establishing shops
in San Francisco to handle work now done
in Oakland. That would be very incon
venient and we could have no motive for
doing it.
"I am not able to give you any definite
information about the bridges across the
estuary. Mr. Curtis has been giving some
attention to the matter, and has appeared
before the Government engineer and has
made some showing about the bridges. It
has been claimed that the bridges are ob
structions in many ways, but what will be
done in making the changes needed I do
not know. I believe that when all the
parties in interest put their heads together
an arrangement will be made satisfactory
to all."
FOR THE Y. M. I.
An Elaborate Banquet Will Be Served
All Delegates on Thursday-
Evening.
HAYWARDS, Cal., April 22.â The gen
eral committee of arrangements who have
"charge for the approaching annual convo
cation of the Grand Council of the Young
Men's Institute, to be held in this city, May

TO SAVE HIS BROTHER.
Thomas Hamilton, Once a Brit
ish Soldier, Killed by
, â¢ the Cars.
It Was in Trying to Prevent Injury
to His Companion That the
Fatality Occurred.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
&08 Broadway, April 22. J
Thomas Hamilton, who with his brother
was beating his way to Philadelphia, was
killed at Sixteenth-street station this even
ing and James Hamilton was run over
and lost portions of both feet.
The dead man lost his life while trying
to save his brother. James does not yet
know that his brother sacrificed his life, as
it is feared the shock might be more than
he can bear at present.
The accident occurred as the overland
express was drawing out of the depot and
.the Napa train was coming in at 6:30 p. m.
There were few witnesses to the fatal
ity, as the men were between the trains at
the time it happened and were shut
from view. The Atlantic express had just
started when some one cried out that two
men were under the wheels. This was
not so, for Thomas was under the East
bound train and James was being crushed
by the Napa train.
Thomas was fearfully mutilated by the
wheels and was removed to the Morgue.
James was at once sent to the Receiving
.Hospital, and an examination showed that
it was necessary to amputate a portion of
both feet. The operation was performed
by Drs. Hamlin and Dunn.
The injured brother told the following
story to a Call man :
"My brother and I came from Australia
about three months ago and have been
securing a few odd jobs in San Francisco.
Thomas Is an engine-packer, but I have no
business. We did not do very well in San
Francisco and decided to beat our way
East.; We crossed the bay this evening and
rode out to the Sixteenth-street depot.
Tom is an expert at train-jumping, but I
have done very little of it and .Tom was
going to keep a lookout for me. '
"We started to jump on the eastbound
train just as it moved out. Tom got
on all right, but when I attempted to jump
1 slipped. Tom shouted to me to look out
and at once jumped off to help me.' He
walked sidewise after getting me off ; the
track, and as he did so the cowcatcher of
the Napa train caught him and struck him
heavily. I would like to know how badly
he is hurt." .â
Robert Abrahams, who was a witness to
the accident, said that there was a party of
four tramps, and that the Hamilton
brothers were two of them.
: "I. first saw them talking to Officer
Sherry." said Abrahams to-night, "and
after they left him I watched them go to
ward the depot. Thomas Hamilton and
his brothei attempted to board the plat
form between the baggage cars, and when
James slipped Thomas ' pulled him out
from under the wheels. When he had
done so he started to walk sideways across
the track with his back to the Napa train.
The cowcatcher struck him and killed
him almost instantly. His brother was
almost insensible and did not know what
was happening. The other two tramps
made off after they saw the accident and
did not attempt "to get aboard. From
what I heard them saying they had made
up their minds to beat their way to Phila
delphia."
It was reported to tho Coroner that
James Hamilton was drunk and that his
brother was trying to persuade him not to
board the train when the accident hap
pened. James Hamilton and Abrahams
deny this and say that all were quite so
ber. The deceased was once a soldier in
the British army.
REV. JEFFERSON CALLED
The Massachusetts Candidate Selected
for the First Church by a
Unanimous Vote.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 22.â First
Congregational Church of this city voted
to extend to the Rev. Charles E. Jefferson
of Chelsea, Mass., a call to become pastor
of that congregation. Mr. Jefferson came
out here at the request of the pulpit com
mittee and preached four Sunday sermons
and attended one midweek prayer meet
ing. He gave such general satisfaction
that when the matter came up this even
ing there was no opposition, but a few
thought it would be better to delay action
at least a week.
When the question went to a vote it
stood 146 to 15, but was immediately made
unanimous. Mr. Jefferson left for his
Eastern home Tuesday morning without
giving any one the east intimation what
he would do if a call lwas extended him by

DAVIE'S BRIEF VICTORY
The Mayor Refuses to Be the
Clown of a Modern Munic-
ipal Comedy.
Four Times the Foard of Works Has
Tried to Elect Wilson as
Chairmen
Oaklanp Office San Francisco Call,)
SOS Broadway, April 22. .
If Commissioner Wilson ever becomes
chairman of the Board of Works he will
have to vote to place himself in that posi
tion.
"I've got Commissioners Wilson and
Peirsoi where I want them," said the third
Commissioner, Mayor Davie, to-day." They
have run the Board of Works to suit them
selves for a year, and they will whistle be
fore I will help to make Wilson chairman."
The charter says that the Board of Works
and Board of Police and Fire Commission
ers, the personnel of which is the same,
shall, at the commencement of each year
of office, elect a chairman. The year was
up two weeks ago and no election has been
held,, and Mayor Davie still presides.
Twice a wees the following little farce is
carried out in the office of the board:
Commissioner Peirsol â The time having
arrived when according to the charter we
must elect a chairman, nominations are
now in order. After a moment's silence,
Mr. Peirsolâ l nominate Mr. Wilson.
Commissioner Wilsonâ Do I hear a
second?
The Mayorâ unless you whispered
it yourself. !::
Mr. Peirsolâ l have placed Mr. Wilson
in nomination.
The Mayor laughs and without rising
says Well, gentlemen you have stuck to
gether against me all the year and I do
not intend to force my vote upon you. I
have been a minority for the whole year
and I should feel uncomfortable in any
other role. Go ahead, gentlemen, and elect
my successor. ! I shall not interfere. Vote
for yourself, Mr. Wilson.
Mr. Wilsonâ Well, I thinkâ
Mr. Peirsolâ Well, I thinkâ
The Mayorâ I'm â sure â The
board adjourns. .; ; :
The little farce was played to a full house
for the fourth time yesterday afternoon
and will be presented again to-morrow.
"It's all a farce, a|howling, hollow farce,"
said the Mayor this afternoon. "I've said
all along that the board, as at present con
stituted, is a mountebank show, but if end
men Wilson and Piersol think they can
make a clown of me, they are like the
Street Superintendent's lumber calcula
tionsâa little off.
Mr. Wilson says that propriety forbids
him from secondine his own nomination,
but he declines to add anything to hi. pre
viously expressed opinions of the Mayor.
City Attorney Peirsol declares that no
inconvenience will follow the deadlock, as
a chairman must act till his successor is
chosen. .
The Mayor has in his office one of the
well-known conundrum pictures "When
shall we three meet again?" and he says it
is particularly appropriate. Meanwhile
the political band plays on. ; ;*_, .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.
DROWNED IN MAD RIVER
Details of the Death of the Salva
tionist Officer, "Little
Lapp."
HIS COMRADE'S CLOSE SHAVE.
The Victim Was a Faithful Worker,
Who Was Trained in the Oak
land Garrison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. April 22. f
Information has - been received from
Captain Stedman regarding the death of
Captain Jonas Matheson of the Salvation
Army, who was drowned while attempt
ing to ford the Mad River in making the
trip from Areata to Trinidad.
Captain Matheson was trained at the
Oakland garrison, and was well known as
a persistent seller of War Crys on the
street. With his lieutenant, George Lin
nell, he was making the tour of his out
riders 1 circuit with his horse and cart.
They attempted about noon on Sunday to
cross the river, which, owing to the recent
rains, had become eight feet deep and very
swift. â¢'"'-..*-.
â¢ Captain Stedman, in a letter just re
| ceived, says: "As they approached the
j middle of the stream the water got so deep
that the boys began to get alarmed, and
i were about to turn back, when a sudden
: rush of water upset the cart. The boys
i got their coats off and began to swim for
! their lives. Captain Matheson struck out
j for one shore and Lieutenant Linn ell for
I the other. The lieutenant said that if he
', had had to go ten yards further before he
i struck bottom he* also would have been
'â  drowned. After landing he saw the cap
| tain still swimming toward the other bank.
: The latter suddenly stopped and sank be-
I neath the water. That was the last seen
j of him."
Captain Stedman says that although
men have been searching for the body
ever since the drowning, it has not been
found. It is supposed that the bodies of
both the captain and his horse have been
washed out to sea.
Everybody in the Salvation Army on
the coast knows "the little Lapp."* He
was very short in stature, but very earnest
and active. Jonas went to school on the
little island of J_ uo off the north coast of
Norway till he was old enough to go to
sea. While leading a sailor's life he came
in contact with the Salvation Army and
was led to change his manner of living.
He was drinking in a saloon with some
shipmates when some War Cry lassies en
tered and engaged Jonas in conversation.
He accepted an invitation to attend the
meetings and soon afterward was con
verted. A little later he entered the train
ing garrison in this city and was prepared
for an officer. Since leaving here be has
been in Hanford, Stockton, Eureka and
Fortuna. .;â¢" yy: 'â 
About six weeks ago Captain Matheson
was placed in charge of the Areata out
riders' circuit and he was on his way to
hold meetings when he met his death.

STANFORD WON AT BALL
The Cardinal Wearers From Palo
Alto Victorious by a Score
of 14 to 8.
BERKELEY CATCHER DISABLED
First Game of the Trio of Intercolle
giate Contests on the Diamond
"'* on the U. C. Campus.
BERKELEY, Cal., -. April 22. â With
flying colors the Stanford baseball nine
walked off the Berkeley diamond - this
afternoon, after having defeated the Uni
versity of California team in the first of
the series of three games for the season of
'96 by a score ot 14 to 8.
There was keen interest in the game and
a big crowd on the campus. At the out
set and until the fifth inning things looked
as though they were going Berkeleywise,
but the tide turned when the game was
almost exactly half through, and from
that point on the Stanford men had things
very much their own way. The disabling
of Wheeler did much to turn the tide in
favor of the cardinal bearers, as he ap
peared groggy from that point on.
McLaine did distinguishing work from
the pitcher's box during the greater part
of the game, but toward the last he grew
somewhat erratic. The Berkeley men
batted him much more easily than they
anticipated. His extraordinary quickness
in playing did much to balance up his
work. Morden was steady throughout,
but showed signs of weakness toward the
last. The summary shows that he gave
only four men bases on balls, while Mc-
Lame gave eight. It is a difficult matter
to decide which of the two pitchers did
the better work. Wherein one failed the
other did not, and vice versa. As for the
catchers, Jeffs did the better wort, after
the disabling of Wheeler, as a natural
consequence.
The outfield work of the Stanford men
was somewhat better than that of Berke
ley without a doubt. The game seems to
have been lost in the fifth inning, when
Wheeler failed to catch from Krug and
when he was fouled by Taylor. The odds
were much in favor .of Berkeley, and
doubtless the victory would have gone to
her but for the ill-fortune of the fifth in
ning. Berkeley/took the bat, and within
ten minutes after the call of time had
scored two runs. These were made by
Wheeler and Johnson. When the Stan
ford men came to the bat Taylor struck a
hard-sent ball, but was caught out On first.
In attempting to make first he fouled
Hennessey heavily. Jeffs came up next
and scored a run for the cardinal. -'â â â ii'AA
Harris is put out on first and Young on
second. lA^aAAa ...
In the next Krug sent the ball far into
the right field and was caught out.
Proctor struck out and Hoag was thrown
out. 'â  .^"P**
Following is the complete summary of
the game beginning with the inning: In
the second half of the second Sham struck
out, Thompson fouled to Catcher Wheeler
and Stanbury takes his base on balls.
Freeman knocks a sky flyer into right field
and is caught by Hoag and the Berkeley
men come to the bat again.
The inning opens. Elston takes his
base on being hit by the pitcher. He is
thrown out on second. Young on first
makes a brilliant stop from the shortstop
and rieht here the Berkeley men com
mence their good work of scoring, though
it lasted for but a short time.
Hennessey takes his base on error of the
first baseman, who missed a pop fly.
Wheeler and Hennessey both make bases
on a strike of Johnson. Wheeler scores
his second run, and immediately after
ward McLaren knocks a single and scores
Hennessey. Morden takes the bat and is
struck out, with McLaren and Johnson on
bases. Hoag is put out on first and leaves
Johnson on third, when Stanford comes to
the bat again. ",-.-,"
Pitcher McLaine flew out to Johnson
and Taylor takes his base on balls. Jeffs
is next to strike. Morden assists to
piston, and Taylor is put out. Harris is
soon after put out on an assist by Krug.
Three men out, and Berkeley takes the
bat for the beginning of the fourth.
Krug flew out to the shortstop and
Proctor strikes to left field and is missed
by Stanbury. Elston is next up, and
Proctor is put out on second by an assist
of McLaine to second baseman. Hen
nessey flew out to second and Wheeler is
left on first. :- :.-;y\
Stanford again. Young flew out to
Hennessey and Sharp flew out to McLaren.
Thompson takes his base on balls and is
put out on first by a very clever left-hand
catch of Morden. ':-'. .;
When the U. C. men come up again
Johnson flies out on the . second strike ;
McLaren is put out also by an assist of
.McLaine to first. Morden knocks a high
center fielder out and takes the first bag.
Hoag makes first on his second strike and
Krug flies out to the catcher. Three men
out and the cardinal again at the bat.
Sharp makes a base hit and brings in
two men. The game is just half through j
at this point, with the score standing â¢
eight to four in favor of Stanford. . The
old-time "hoodoo" strikes Berkeley and be- ;
fore the close of this inning Stanford
scores seven runs, which win for the Palo
Alto boys the game. Freeman follows
Sharp and makes first : on an error of
McLaren. McLaine now takes the bat and
reaches the first bag. Then came the
crisis, which ran up the score of the cardi
nal and laid out Berkeley's catcher. Krug
throws from third to Wheeler at the home
plate on a strike by Taylor, lor the pur
pose of putting out Freeman who was on
third. â¢
The ball came low and Wheeler muffed.
This error cost Berkeley just two runs, as
Freeman and McLaine both came home.
Jeffs comes to the bat and makes a two
base hit. Morden throws â : to Wheeler
again at the : plate, but â¢ before the ball
reaches him he is heavily.; fouled by Tay
lor, which laid him out for eight minutes.
Jeffs gets in also at this break -in the
game. Wheeler, in a half-dazed condition
stands up and works like a Trojan warrior,
but despite his efforts to hold up nis end
of the battery | Stanford scored three more
runs before their third man was put out,
thus * making the score -8 to 4 in their
favor, having had only one run when the
inning began.
In the first of the sixth Proctor went up
and was put out by ;an assist from Sharp
to Young. Wheeler flew out to second;
Hennessey makes second on his last strike
and .Elston makes ; home from < second.
Johnson strikes to third and is put out by
third while waiting for third to throw the
ball to first. - â  A clever play was â  registered
at this point for Sharp on third. '
.. â¢In . the second of the _ sixth McLaine
knocks to Johnson in left, who makes one
of the most costly errors of the day. Mc-
Lame goes none base with -Taylor at
the bat. ; Taylor takes his base on ball..
McLaine gets home on the strike of Jeffs,
who a is himself put out on first by a
brilliant throw from Krug.
Harris comes up and; brings in Taylor.
Harris gets on third, when Young . takes
the hat. Harris? runs in and Sharp is
struck out by Morden. Thompson is put
out on first, and the score stands 11 to 5 in
favor of the cardinal, with the game just
half through. T
â  i With Berkeley at the bat, McLaren takes
his base on balls.,*. Morden goes to first on
balls. McLaine, who had up to. this time
pitched good ball, was becoming wild and
erratic. He put tremendous force into his
throws and made the balls to follow one
another in* quick succession,' but , to little
effect, save â  the burning of â  the ; catcher's
hands. ,aa- .-.-;
'y McLaren is put out on second while steal
ing a base. j /'Diddy" ; Hoag : is ,; put out on
first by a right-fielder; and Morden comes
home, while Krug makes first. Proctor is
the third man to strike out and the Stan
ford men again have a chance at the bat.
Stanbury goes out and Freeman takes a
base on balls. McLaine makes first on a
hit to Taylor and soon steals to third.
Jeffs is caught out on first and McLaine at
the â¢ home-plate ;by a brilliant catch of
Wheeler.
In the first of the' eighth Elston is put
out on' first; Wheeler takes his base on
balls. Hennessey, scores a base hit and
Wheeler gets to second. Hennessey is put
out by ; a crack . play of Harris. ; McLaren |

In the end of the eighth Young gets his :
base on an error by. Eiston. .: He makes his
run home on an error of Proctor, the cen
ter fielder. Sharp strikes out and Stan- j
bury flies out to McLaren. Thomnson |
flies out to Johnson in the left field.'and j
the eighth inning is ended.
Only half of the ninth was played, as
the victory belonged to Stanford without |
the playing of the second half. Morden
takes the bat and fouls out Proctor \
strikes out, and Hoag gets to second on a <
hard fielder. Krug then . makes first on a
right center fielder. Hoag and Krug both j
score on Elston's two-bagger, and Wheeler
takes his base on balls. Hennessey fouls
twice into the crowd of small boys on the
side lines, and Wheeler makes a good '
steal. Johnson knocks a fly to Jeffs and
the game is ended, with a score of 14 to 8 i
in favor of the cardinal.

Postmasters hip Fight.
BERKELEY, Cal., April Much bit
terness has been aroused in the fight for
the office of postmaster of Berkeley to suc
ceed McCarthy, the incumbent, whose
term expires on April 28.
Deputy Marshal C. T. Kerns, who is
one of the aspirants for the place and who
claims to have the support of Congress
man English, is indignant at the methods
he claims have been used to defeat him.
Mr. Kerns says his opponents have sent to
Washington many slanderous statements
with a view to injuring his reputation and
his chances. vi;:. :
'â¢My character must be very bad in
Washington," said Mr. Kerns, "and 1 sup
pose those who have received the slander
ous statements and affidavits that have
been forwarded wonder why I am not in
San Quentin." '
Postmaster McCarthy is a candidate for
reappointment, but as he is a Republican
he is not thought to bave much chance of
success. Other candidates are N. P.
Byrne and Ole Vincent. Vi'. " ; i â¢)-;-
More Bonds Agitation.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 42.â Agitation
to bond the town has again arisen, in spite
of the defeat of bonds at two recent
special elections. The West Berkeley Pro
gressive Club has come out in opposition
to the special tax for $22,500, which will
be voted on on May 16.
A meeting of the club was held last
night and the members decided to make a
strong effort to defeat the direct tax, so
that another effort may be made to secure
bonds. ... - -Ay "a
An opinion was secured from Cary How
ard, an Oakland attorney, that a bonds
election could legally he held in which
wharf and school bonds were combined
under the A head of municipal improve
ments. It is thought by members of the
club that in such an election both propo
sitions wonld carry, as each would receive
the benefit of the affirmative strength of
the other.
A committee consisting of F. Wilkes,
Charles Geirrim, J. P. Renas and Thomas
Wilson was appointed to secure a man in
each ward of the town to work against the
direct tax and in favor of bonds.
The direct tax measure may be carried
by a majority vote, two-thirds majority
not being needed, as in the case of bonds,
and the general impression among those
interested in such matters is that the
measure to be voted upon on May 16 will
carry. ytw^sy y< "

The ceiling also is a work of art, the cen

were wont to meet, surrounded by small
panels containing symbols appropriate to
all the degrees. To add to the effect at
night three complete circuits of incan

installed, thus making it possible to view
the scenes at early morn, high noon and

in the neighborhood of $1000.
The Unitarian Conference.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 22.â The twelfth
annual meeting of the Pacific Unitarian
Conference was held in the Unitarian
church on Grand street to-day. Upward
of sixty delegates ere in attendance and
j to-morrow the number will be increased.
The Rev. Horatio Stebbins opened the
meeting and the Rev. Horace Davis of the
First Church, San Francisco, was ap

sence oi C. M. Gorham. After committees
had been chosen on business, nominations
and credentials, C. A. Mu_dock, the treas
urer, read a statement of receipts and dis
bursements showing a credit balance of
$155. The North Pacific Conference re
ported through Rev. E. M. Wilbur of Port
land, Or., that no sessions had been held
during the year owing to hard times. Rev.
Mrs. E. T. Wilkes on behalf of the South
ern California Conference reported favor
ably on the progress being made and the
encouraging outlook" in that end of the
State.
Rev. C. W. Wendte of Oakland, as
superintendent of the American Unitarian
Association, gave an interesting account
of the growth of Unitarianism on the
coast. He said that they now had thirty
church organizations, eight missionary
stations, eighteen church buildings, prop
erty valued at $600,000, with an indebted
ness of $75,000 ; twenty-three ministers in
active service and ten others ready for at
least occasional service. He intimated
that after the first of May he would cease
his labors- as superintendent in order to
devote his whole attention to his Oakland
ministerial duties.

Berkeley, read a bright paper on "The
New Pilgrim's Progress," and the Rev. W.
G. Eliot Jr. of San Francisco one on "Life
and Organization of a Unitarian Church."

young lads, named Willie Pratt, Tom

Bay Farm Island yesterday afternoon in
search of oysters.
After landing on a sandbar in the chan

search of a fresh oyster-bed. He forgot to
return, and his two mates were left stand
ing on the bar. The tide turned and com

by a passing fisherman three ' hours after
their mate had sailed away. By this time
the water was up to the boys' waists.

LAST OF AN OLD FIRM.
Preston & McKinnon Retiring From
the Lumber Business.
Preston & McKinnon, the old lumber
firm which has been engaged in business
in San Francisco for many years, has de
cided to close its career and leave the com
mercial and manufacturing arena. With
this end in view it is rapidly disposing of
its stock and various business interests and
winding up its affairs.
Recently Mr. McKinnon died. The re
moval of the active partner induced the
remaining owners to discontinue trading
and leave the field to others. The lumber
industry of late years has not been as
profitable as heretofore for all encaged in
it here, and this, too, had its weight in in
ducing the firm to retire.

THE FISH COMMISSION
Waters in Sonoma County That
Have Been Stocked
With Bass.
Anglers Who Deplete the Streams
by Catching Baby Troutâ New
Law Necessary.
The sportsmen of Santa Rosa are con
siderably interested in the protection of a
consignment of large-mouth black bass
which arrived there a few days ago in
charge of Deputy Fish Commissioner Wil
son and was afterward placed in a deep
lagoon near Sebastopol which empties
into the Russian River.
The Fish Commissioners received the
following letter from Mr. Saunders of
Santa Rosa, which gives evidence that the
anglers of the City of Roses are interested
in the propagation and protection of the
fishes:
Sebastopol, April 1, 1896.
California Fish Commissionâ Gentlemen: I
1 met your agent at Santa Rosa this morning,
and found him very courteous and received
from him can "W," containing some as
pretty, yes, as beautiful, laree-mouth black
bass as ever flashed a fin. Within forty min
utes from leaving Santa Rosa I had them in
their new home. Accept from me the thanks
of our people, who are with me in the forma
tion of a fish patrol to see that the beauties
received this morning have a fair show. I
believe that within four miles of Sebastopol is
a chance to start the biggest pickerel pond in
the United States. Very respectfully,
John* S. Saunders.
Deputy Wilson proceeded from Santa
Rota to Clear Lake, where the remainder
of the consignment of bass, pickerel and
perch from San Diego were placed. If the
residents in the vicinity of the waters in
which the fishes were placed will see that
they are protected for a few years, there
will be excellent food fishes and sport for
all who have a predilection fot aneling.
Yesterday fish Commissioner Babcock
received a letter from Santa Rosa, stating
that a Chinese was arrested for fishing in
the lagoon to which the bass were con
signed.
The immediate arrest of a poacher proves
that the sportsmen of Santa Rosa are de
termined to make an example of those
who will persist in illegal fishing.
Deputies Wilson and Cross have left for
San Diego, from which nlace they will re
turn in a few days with another consien
ment of fishes for the lagoons of the
Sacramento River within easy reach of
Sacramento City. - :-' -A
It is quite probable that the anglers of
this City who are interested in propaga
tion and protection of trout will use their
best endeavors at the next meeting of the
Legislature to have a law passed making
it a misdemeanor for any person found
catching or in possession of trout less than
five inches in length. â¢ ' * i-:*'
There are numbers of alleged sportsmen :
who, when angling on a stream, neper;
dream of such a thing as returning "baby"
trout to their element. Anything having
the semblance of a trout, goes into the
basket. . Unfortunately for the interest of
the sport some of the baby-fish killers
masquerade as honorable sportsmen and
protectors of game and fish.
Last Sunday one of these "honorable"
sportsmen, who some years ago shot quail
lor the Â»an Francisco market, caugbt a
number of trout fry in Bear Valley Creek,
which stream meanders through the Coun
try Club's preserve. Several ol the little
fishes did not measure three inches in
length, but they were dumped into, the
"pot" basket, nevertheless, and carted to
this City. It is in the robbing of a stream
of its immature tishes at this season of the
year that the summer sport of angling is
destroyed.
If the small trout were permitted to
grow to a respectable size there would be
good sport for all lovers of angling in the
months of June, July and August. A law
is, however, very necessary to stop the
present slaughter of the innocents.
The f-dlowing anglers returned last Sun
day from Paper-mill Creek, some of whom
met with tolerably good success near To
caloma: Messrs. Moorehouse, Jones, Sta
ples, Finch, Ibbotson, Meal, Bransdorff,
Gosliner, Gauthier, Parisser, Muller, Til
ley, Myers, Cbarles Kervell, Paul Bru
notte, Â£. McGreggor, Louis Rondeau, A.
Ireland, James Watt, Al Smith, Charles
Gate, William Cooney, Frank Dolliver,
George Twitcbell, Charles Precht, "Andy,"
William Kittle and John K. Orr.
Those who caught large fish that weighed
from three to eight pounds were: Cate,
Watt, Twitchell, Pre'cht, "Andy" and
Smith. The stream is yet too high for
successful angling, and will not be in fit
ting order for fly fishing for two weeks at
least. There are large numbers of trout in
the creek, and with the return of warm
weather good sport will certainly be en
joyed. :' - a : ' * 'â â  '--v y*.

FOR UNPLEDGED
DELEGATES ONLY
Should Represent California
Republicans at St.
Louis.
PLEDGES OF THE PAST.
Many Leading Men of the Party
Freely Express Their
Sentiments.
CALIFORNIA ON THE ROLLCALL.
Why Send the Individual if His Judg
ment at the Convention Is Not
to Be Exercised?
Whatever opinions may be entertained
by California Republicans regarding the
merits of statesmen who are named as
candidates for President it is clear enough
that fully three-fourths of the members of
the party hold that the delegates from this
State to the National Convention should
go unpledged.
William Alvord yesterday expressed his
sentiment briefly by saying: "It is my
opinion that our delegation to the Na
tional Republican Convention at St. Louis
should go there unpledged."
Joseph L. King, broker and granger, was
opposed to pledging delegations. As for
himself he doubted whether he would con
sent to go to a convention as a mere
mouthpiece.
A. S. Hallidie held that the delegation
to the National Convention at St. Louis
should not be hampered by pledges. Cali
fornia in the past had been unfortunate in
pledging delegates to the support of favor
ite candidates. In the light of experience
the State Convention at Sacramento should
not send a tied-up delegation' to St. Louis.
. Sidney M. Smith said : "The delegates
to the St. Louis convention ought not to
be instructed. Ido not mean to say that
the preference of the people of California
should not be expressed by the State Con
vention at Sacramento, but the expression
of preference should not take the form of
instruction. I believe from what I hear
and read the majority of Republicans in
California prefer the nomination of Mc-
Kinley, but it does not follow that the
delegates should be pledged to stand for
him under all circumstances."
Colonel Albert E. Castle said: "1 am in
favor of instructing for McKinley. I think
McKinley is going to win and we will
stand a better chance of getting something
by votirg for hint than by casting our
strength for any other candidate."
Charles G. Clinch said: "The Republi
can delegates from this State to the St.
Louis convention should act as a unit.
They should meet there, fully caucus,
unite and cast their strength for the win
ning man. In that way something may
be done for California and the Pacific
Coast."
James B. Stetson had positive views on
the subject. He said: {'The delegation
should go unpledged. If not, why not tel
egraph the choice of the State Convention?
Why send the individual unless he is sup
posed to exercise his judgment to do the
best he can to promote the success of the
party?"
Albert Gerberding had views on the sub
ject He remarked: "If the State Con
vention at Sacramento should decide to
send to St. Louis a delegation of common
place politicians, bent on promoting their
own prospects of getting favors under the
next Republican administration, then the
delegation should go pledged. If, on the
other hand, it should be the judgment of
the State Convention that California Re
publicans should be represented in the
National Convention by able men of high
character, sound judgment and patriotic
principles, then the delegation should be
permitted to go there unpledged and un
trammeled.' An unpledged delegation of
able men might exert a great influence for
good." *
Hugh Craig, president of the Chamber
of Commerce, said : "lam personally in
favor of McKinley, but I am a firm be
liever in sending an unpledged delegation
to the St. Louis convention. Our dele
gates,, however, should vote as a unit.
California is the first Republican State on
the rollcall. True, Alabama and Arkansas
are called first, but party success is not
expected in either. California is in the
Republican column, and for that reason
our eighteen votes may count for consid
erable. If the delegates should discover,
after surveying the field and fully caucus
ing on the subject, that McKinley could
not win, they should not be compelled by
their pledges to cast the fortunes of the
State with the losing cause. Let the dele
gates be free to exercise their judgment.
California ought to be recognized by the
next Nationaladministration. The Secre
tary of the Treasury should be appointed
from this State. California is the one
State of the Union that has steadfastly ad
hered under all circumstances and condi
tions to sound money principles.
. "The principle is recognized in our State
constitution. We have broad-minded and
capable public men in the State. There is
J. B. Stetson, a man of affairs, of excellent
â judgment and intellectually alert. There
is Horace Davis, a scholar and statesman.
Either one is capable of directing the
affairs of the treasury. The convention at
Sacramento should send to St. Louis men
of character and influence. These men
should be left free to form their own judg
ment at the National Convention."
Colonel William R. Smedberg said: "I
am in favor of unpledged delegates. It is
well enough for the State Convention by
resolution to express a preference, but the
delegates should not be pledged to stand
through thick and thin for any candidate.
"This reminds me of a talk I had the
other day with D. J. Staples. He said
California had an unpledged delegation
when Mr. Lincoln waa nominated the
first time, and this delegation voted for

Lincoln finally, but cast its first ballots
for Seward. Mr. Staples says if the chair
man of the California delegation had been
alert and quick enough to have caught the
spirit of the convention he could have
changed California in time to have gained
lor the State the honor of securing Lin
coln's nomination. He was a little slow,
however, and Ohio wheeled into line, first
giving Mr. Lincoln the number | of. votes
required. A delegation to a National Con
vention ought never to be tied up with
instructions. Experience should teach
Californians of the folly of pledging dele
gates in advance."
M. R. Higgins, Insurance Commissioner;
Al Johnson, Slate Printer, and Samuel K.
Thornton, who happened to come in when
Colonel Smedberg was relating the history
of Mr. Lincoln's first nomination,' ex
pressed their ' opinion decidedly that Cali
fornia should positively instruct the dele
gates to the St. Louis convention to vote
for McKinley. : : ~ * "
Dr. Horatio Stebbins remarked that he
took sufficient interest in public affairs to
have an opinion on this subject. He said :
"The habit of instructing^ delegates to
Congress and conventions is a localism.
Men should be sent to the National Con
vention to do the best they can for the
countryâ for the country ; and they should
be allowed to exercise their own judg
ment." â  -,''â "(
George W. Beaver said: "I am not in
favor of tying up our delegation with in
structions, but I do believe that it is
proper for the State Convention at Sacra
mento to indicate, a preference for Mc-
Kinley ; but beyond the expression of this
reference the delegates should not be
hampered in their choice."

IS SHE HYPNOTIZED ?
Strange Story Told by Mrs. William
Wright at the Receiving
Hospital. j
Mrs. "Wright of 747}_ Seventeenth street
accosted Policeman Eastman on Ninth
street yesterday afternoon and . asked for
protection. She ; told , him that she had
been in a hypnotic state for a lone time
and that it was wearing her ; life away.
Her enemies had made up their minds to
kill her, and unless the spell was broken
she would be completely at their mercy. .
' Eastman took her to police headquarters
and he was sent with her to the Receiving
Hospital," where she repeated her tale to
Dr. Stice. She told the doctor that her
husband was also under the spell of the
hypnotist, but he was affected in J a differ
ent way. Last Sunday they were out at
the park and her husband was so much
under the influence that he could neither
see nor hear.
She blamed a prominent physician for
hypnotizing her while she was under his
treatment over a year ago. Since then he
had appeared to her ; disguised in : various
ways and had attempted to get her to go
driving with him. Sometimes when he
met her on the street he would throw
kisses at her, which shocked her. "
Her husband is a carpenter for the Mar-
Ret-street Railway Company and she said
she had not seen him for two days. Dr.
Stice declined to detain her. as there was
no warrant for her arrest, and she left the
hospital. , -. .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 23, 1896.
PRIMARY RETURNS
ARE CANVASSED.
Republican Fourth District
Delegates Officially
Approved.
NO CONTEST KECEIVED.
The Regular Congressional Com
mittee Approves the Elec
tion Returns.
FIFTH DISTRICT TO FOLLOW.
Delegates Chosen by the People to Be
Certified to the State Central
Committee.
The Republican Congressional Commit
tee of the Fourth District met yesterday,
and after canvassing the primary election
returns submitted by the County Commit
teemen from that Congressional District
approved the report on the regular pri
mary election for delegates to the State
Convention, and ordered that the election
of all the delegates so reported be certified
to the Republican State Central Commit
tee.
To-morrow at 11 a. m. the Congressional
Committee of the Fifth District will meet
in the law office of its secretary, John E.
Richards, in the Crocker building, to can
vass the similar returns from that portion
of San Francisco lying within the Fifth
Congressional District and from San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties. The call
for this meeting was sent out yesterday by
Mr. Richards. This committee will sim
ilarly certify to the State Central Commit
tee the delegates chosen by direction of
tbe County Committeemen, to whom it
delegated this power.
The Congressional committees of the
Fourth and Fifth districts stand some
what apart from the other Congressional
committees of the State, in that they
have not received the kicks of the
masses of the party for taking to
themselves the power of appointing
delegates to the State Convention.
Both of these committees adopted at the
start the policy of leaving to the regularly
constituted local party authorities the
duty of supervising the election of dele
gates. Both committees delegated this
power to the tyCommitteemen of their
districts, and in San Francisco the selection
of delegates was further referred to the
people themselves at a primary, election
which was made the cleanest and fairest
known in the history of the local party
and at which a larger percentage of the
best classes of Republicans cast their bal
lots than ever before.
At the second meeting of the Republican
Congressional Committee held on March
13 the resolutions adopted included the
following:
Resolved, First, that the interests and success
of the Republican party of the State of Califor
nia in the coming State and National campaign
require that every effort should be put forth
and every means adopted by the regularly or
ganized agencies and committees of the Re
publican party to secure an honest election of
delegates to the State and District conventions
of the State of California and to the Republican
National Convention; second, that to that end
it should be and hereby is ordered j that a pri-
Mary election shall be called and held for the
Fourth Congressional District of the State of
California. ) .';-':.'-
The conduct of this primary was in
trusted to the Republican County Com
mitteemen representing tha Fourth Con
gressional Committee, the Congressional
Committee to act as a returning board
thereon. â¢, j.*'- -'-'*?
In pursuance of this instruction the pri
mary election was held in the Fourth Dis
trict on April 15, the same day on which
the primary was held in that portion of
the City belonging to the Fifth District,
and at that election a full and fair vote
was cast for delegates named solely by the
people of the various districts in I accord
ance with the policy of home rule insisted
upon by John D. Spreckels and heartily
supported by the members of the County
Committee and other party leaders.
The result of this primary election was
certified to the Fourth Congressional
committee on last Monday, the 20th inst.,
and it was the report then filed which the
committee of the Fourth District met to
consider yesterday. '
The meeting yesterday afternoon was
held at 327 Market street. There were
present six of the seven members of the
committee, as follows: C. C. Be mis, chair
man; J. Pockwitz, secretary; N. Ohlandt.
C. B. Rode, R. Rassmussen and Henry
Leffman. 'A-.A^.Aa:AA ; 'a. 'AyAA

/ The contest started by the defeated fac
tion in the Thirty-third District had been
expected to receive attention from the
Congressional Committee, but the protest
did not reach that body at all. In this As
sembly District the opposition ticket re
ceived Jess than one-seventh of the votes
cast, but a protest was gotten up based on
allegations of fraud in the conduct of the
election. .!'",-'''â¢"-
This protest was filed with Chairman
Chretien of the County Committeemen of
the Fourth District day before yesterday,
but after the returns of the election had
been filed with the Congressional Com
mittee. â¢;:;,*;_ - .
.No contest was filed with the Congres
sional Committee where it was ' provided
that all contests must be disposed of and
by the resolutions adopted by the Con
gressional Committee on March 13, and
published thereafter, it was provided that
all contests arising out of the election
mubt be filed with that committee within
nfteen days before the - meeting of the
State Convention on May 5.
_T. he dissatisfied contestants of the
Thirty-third were talking yesterday about
taking their contest to the convention.
The Congressional Committee of the
Fifth District will have before it when it
meets the similar contest filed by some
members of the defeated opposition fac
tion in that district. This contest, how
ever, lost yesterday some of the force it
possessed by the declaration of two of
the delegates on the defeated ticket that
they would not support the contest. Ex-
Supervisor S. 8. Morton stated that he was
put, on the opposition ticket without
his knowledge or consent, and had no
part to play in the .contest. E. L. Cook
said that he beHeved that his ticket was
defeated honestly and fairly, and that he
would not join in the con test. ' :
With the exception of these two small
contests, which represent small minorities
in these districts, the Republican delega
tion, which is united, harmonious and
backed by ninety-nine-hundredths of the
local party, has in its way but the farcical
and fraudulent Kelly- Mahoney fake dele
gation from the Fourth District.
At this stormy time of a stormy political
year, when the party in other Congres
sional districts is torn for the time by con
flicts between the people and the politi
cians, # the condition of the party in San
Francisco, where the people themselves
have found a chance to rule, thanks to
John D. Spreckels, is one of exceptional
and encouraging harmony and strength.
REDWOOD TO GO EAST.
Ex-Mayor Kinsey Talks of the
Stimulus to the Shingle
Trade.
Rise of the Wool and Dairying In
terestsâHalf a Million Dollars
, for a Railroad.
Among the recent arrivals here from
Humboldt County is f ex-Mayor L. T. Kin
sey of Eureka, .Who' is assistant cashier of
the Bank of Eureka. Mr. Kinsey has been
a resident of the solid Northern California
since 1857, or about his entire life.. He has
been County Treasurer, and then was
elected County Clerk and finally Mayor.
The ex-Mayor says tnere is a good deal
of interest in the forthcoming National
campaign. The majority of the people by
far want a Republican elected President,
tor they want protection for wool and
lumber alike. They want other things
protected also, and believe in it as an es
sential quality of permanent success.
"For this reason there are a good many
McKinley men up there," he said, "but
Mr. Allison has a great many friends, and
would get a heavy vote." The fact is, any
Republican nominated would easily carry
that part of Northern California.
"I heard a Democrat who is extensively
interested in the wool business say the
other : day that he had voted the Dem
ocratic ticket for the last time. He was
going to vote for a Republican this time,
he said. That man owns J 40,000 acres of
land. There ; are many Democrats who
feel as he does in Humboldt. Â
"You know, of course, that Eureka has
succeeded in getting terminal -rates,
through Portland. That will undoubtedly
help the lumber business and greatly
stimulate tne shingle trade with us.
"I have traveled a good deal South and
East, and dealers tell me that our redwood
shingles are by all- odds better than the
cedar shingles of Puget Sound. A lum
ber dealer in Kansas City who owns twen
ty-seven yards was recently, emphasizing
this to me, but we had previously been un
able to sell for the reason that we did not
have terminal rates. '. j Now it is different.
We can furnish a better shingle than any
other ' part .of the world and can sell as
cheap as the best cedar shingle can be sold.
"Our wool interests are very large, and
the same is true of our dairy interests.
Nearly all the land which was dsed for
potatoes and grain three or four year . ago
is now down in clover and other grass and
devoted to dairying. A great many cream
eries have been started. : " . "
- "We need a railroad, however. I think
a company could get a handsome jj cash
bonus of $500,000 or $600,000 â¢ that would
give us good connections. Even the Boise
road, the California,* Oregon and Idaho, in
which the people never had a great deal
of confidence, succeeded in getting $480,000
subscribed. A good company, could come
to Eureka and easily get $500,000." >" "
- Mr.. Kinsey is at the Grand. He has
been recuperating after considerable hard
work and will leave for home in a day or
two. ..' â¢â¢ *' l
