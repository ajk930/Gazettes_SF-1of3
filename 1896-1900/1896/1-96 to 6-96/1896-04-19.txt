[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON. Exc, April 18.â The mosi
warlike British jingo can no longer com
plain that things are dull. Each London
paper has from four to six columns daily
Dew from the headquarters of tlie British
armies in the field or the points where
British subjects are in hourly terror of
their live?, and it is practically admitted
by the Government at last that before
autumn there will be more of the Queen's
soldiers under arms in active service than
since the Sepoy mutiuy wa3 put down,
nearly forty years ago.
Even without any European entangle
ment or rupture of peace England has
enough fighting on her hands for 1896 to
make the year consoicuous in her records.
Now that it is known that 10,000 British
troops with three battallions of the house
hold brigade and Redyers Buller in com
mand, are to go up the Nile as soon as the
floods render an ascent practicable, people
are naturally angry at the wanton lies told
and persisted in for weeks by the Ministers
on this whole subject. The most charita
ble-explanation is that there were sharp
divisions in the Cabinet and that Salisbury,
Balfour and Curzon were hoping against
hope, when they gave pacific assurances
that they could hold their own against
Chamberlain's aggressive jingoism.
At all events no one is making headway
against it to-day, and now that blood has
begun to flow the chance of England's
listening to any peace party is hardly
wcrt.li discussing. Only some oveÂ» whelm
ing catastrophe in the campaign can work
that miracle now, and what caution, large
preparations and unlimited force can do
to avert this danger is all being done. It
is generally understood that a big draft of
native Indian troops will be employed later
on, but the details are unknown.
The news that the Egyptian soldiers ac- ,
quitted themselves so well in the opening
skirmishes with Osman Digna's men
is made much of, but there arc
still grave doubts what they will be
like when the Dervishes get really at
them, hand to hand. Their very appear
ance in the field is regarded as an unpar
donable insult by the Dervishes, whose
contempt for the Fellaheen is boundless,
and they know that if they fall into Der
vish hands their fate will be a thing to
shudder at. Hence they fight with ter
ribie despair, if there oe no way out, but
there must be a powerful pushing force of
British behind them all the while.
The Matabeie rising furnishes for the j
moment a much more exciting theme, for !
there appears to be a genuine danger that
Bulawayo will be sacked and put to fire
and sword before holp can reach it. The
beleaguered garrison could hold the place
against indefinite odds so long as provi
sions and ammunition lasted, but these
both are pretty short, and, worse still,
hundreds of natives are inside the Laager
whoÂ«e loyalty is more than suspected.
Every day brings bulletins of new massa
cres in the outlyina mining territory of
pNÂ»speelteg parties and among the vic
tims an exceptional proportion of young
men of well-known families. Exciting as
all this is, it is not an unfamiliar experi
ence to the English, and under ordinary
conditions they would not dream of bor
rowing trouble about it, but it happens
that something much mere important
than smashing a mutiny of savages is
involved, and the uncertainty of just what
this is makes the people nervous. The
whole Transvaal problem is darkly mixed
up with the Matabele difficulty, and all
England's steps to.\ard restoring order in
I'hodesia have to be picked carefully in
order jiot to tread on Kruger's toes.
This makes the Tories Impatient here
â  and they are beginning to cry out to
Chamberlain to go ahead regardless of the
Boers and whip them, too, if they insist
on being disagreeable. This is all reported
at fretoria, where pre-existing prejudice
hÃs been intensified to sober rage by i
wholesale lies cabled to and from South
Africa by aerents, parasites of Johannes
burg and gold-field syndicates. As a re
sult England is permanently increasing
the garrison of regulars at Cape Town,
and will probably find herself sending out
strll ot*ber forces as the summer advances.
The Times this morning says this
doubling of strength at Cape Town is done j
because in case of a European war the
Suez canal would be blocked and all traffic
would have to go round the Cape and the
security of this splendid British harbor
and baÃe of supplies would be an irupera- ;
tive necessity. If this be an authorized
statement it may well set Englishmen
thinking. They can only reconcile them
selves to the spectacle of their country wad
iner waist-deep into the African morass by
taking it for granted that the peace of Eu
rope has been provided for.
Meanwhile if this has not been done,
and if England finds herself confronted
suddenly by hostile Continental combina
tions to her detriment while she has her
bauds lied in Ethiopia, 1 should not envy
LorJ Salisbury his experience with the
British public.

week ago to feel sure if there is to be a j
crisis or not. The materialsjfor it exist,
indeed are piled high on every side, but at
the last moment, as happened so often be
| fore, they may be ignored. If it were not
folly to predict at all I should hazard a
cuess that Bourgeois will be found ready
with a plan for thrusting domestic ques
tions into the background and creating the
impression that the foreign situation has
suddenly grown very grave.
President Faure's hurried visit of in
spection on the eastern frontier seems
very likely the prelude to such a game.
The Triple Alliance may or may not ter
minate next year. Italy for the present
is in too impoverished and distracted a
state to pledge herself now to any future
course, and so the whole matter of renewal
has been left open. This, of course, will
not affect existing bonds, and these appear
to hold the three central powers together
somewhat more intimately and confidently
than at the beginning of the year.
The decision of the clerical party in the
Reichstag to take the lead in the agitation
against military dueling in Prussia is by
far the cleverest thing that the Catholic
leaders in Germany have done since Wind
horst's death. As was said last week, the
circumstances surrounding this latest
Kotze-Schrader tragedy have created a
profound impression throughout the em
pire, which is spreading so tbat it may
become the universal subject of talk.
People with memories liken the popular
excitement about it io that which stirred
all France at the beginning of 1870, when
Prince Pierre Bonaparte shot Victor Noir.
It is recalled thai historians are fond of
dating the fall of the second empire from
that event, which laid hold of the public
imagination with a grip that nothing
could shake off. Although it is true that
no question of dynasty kinship or politics
is now involved it is also true that Emper
or William's personal responsibility for
the tragedy is much more direct than was
Napoleon Ill's. It can well be believed
that the Ministers at Berlin are growing
excessively nervous at the indications of
the way the people have taken this thing
to heart and wish that the Bismarckian
i junker fire-eaters and editors who have
chosen this moment to bawl ecstatic
praises of dueling and laud the Kaiser to
the 6kies for his manly sympathy with it
were at the bottom of the seas. The Em
peror himself is at Carlsruhe, where he
may get notning but good advice from his
uncle, the Grand Duke of Baden. W hether
he will follow it is another matter. What
ever he does ray statement last week that
this will probably turn out to be the most
important, thing that has happened in
William's reign seems truer than ever.
Although the elections in Spain osten
sibly veto concessions to Cuba by a tre
mendous majority, I am told by people
who keep in touch with Spanish po'^
ticians that Canovas folly intends to us?
his majority to pass a tolerably conipre
, henuve scheme of reforms for the island.

SANTA BARBARA GIVES WAY TO LOS ANGELES.
He is understood to have become con
vinced that this is necessary and to
believe that he is now strong enough to do
it. It is evident from all the accounts of
the elections that this popular excitement
about Cuba has reacted with- most dissa
trons disorganizing effects on the Spanish
domestic politics. Mob violence, whole
sale intimidation and absentation of vot
ers, gross corruption and open falsification
of ballot returns are alleged all over the
peninsula as never before, so that practi
cally the whole reputable press of Madrid,
quite irrespective of party, join in gloomy
warnings that unless improvement begins
at once the monarchy, and, for that mat
ter, the country itself, will be doomed.
Prince Ferdinand's arrival in St. Peters
burg to-day divides the Russian politicians
more than any other event since the new
reign began. Almost all the papers which
a few months ago were reviling him with
the ugliest epithets in the language, which
is particularly rich in expletives, now wel
come him effusively and applaud the de
cision of the St. Petersburg municipal
officers to meet him on his arrival with
bread and salt and offer U> him a formal
address of greeting. But the men who
were dearest to the late Czar are furious at
this parade over such a shifty renegade.
Prince Mestschersky, whose Grashdanin
was the one paper that Alexander 111 per
sonally read and would never allow the
censor to touch, denounces the reception
as a degradation to St. Petersburg and an
insult to all enlightened patriotic Rus
sians. It. is recalled also that the St.
Petersburg municipality last used this
ancient ceremony when Alexander II re
turned to the capitol after the Turko-Rus
sian war and thus enforced the contrast
does seem to be sufficiently striking.
The discovery that while representatives
of every other religion in the whole Rus
sian Empire, including the tiniest non-
Christian sects in the Asiatic portions,
have been invited to the coronation fes
tivities in Moscow next month, not a
single Jewish rabbi is included in the list,
muÂ«t open the eyes of those who clung all
along to the notion that Israel had some
thing to hope for from the new reign. To
make the affront more pointed a delega
tion of rabbis has been invited from the
Crimean community of Karaim Jews, or
rather Judaized Tartars, who number
about 4000 and who are disowned by all
orthodox Hebrews. These schismatics,
who reject the Talmud, have always been
petted by the Russian anti-Semites just to
enrage the Jews in general, and for this
reason they will be thrust forward at Mos
cow as representing the entire Hebraic
race.
The date for which the Macedonia insur
rection was being planned all the winter
has passed, and no sign of an uprising is
; discernible. This is explained by the fact
that Russia, who controls both the Bul
garian and Macedonian committees, has
changed her mind, and, for the present at
[ least, wishes peace in the Balkans. The
machinery for a revolt is all in existence,
however, and at Vienna it is believed that
the wheels will be set in motion as soon as
the Czar's coronation festival is out of the
way, but in Vienna they have a habit of
alway believing gloomy things.
For a long time it has been becoming
less and less necessary to include mention
of Irish affairs in a survey of Europe's do
ings. Matters have reached a stage now'
which may well rejoice those who dislike
Ireland most. It would be hard to exag
gerate the amazement and disgust with
which everybody in Parliament, outside a
little group of two score tenth-rate bosses
and their salaried heelers, regards the epi
sode of Dillon's publicly forcing himself
upon the Belfast and Derby bills commit
tee in the place of Healy, whose appoint
ment had been unanimously asked for
by those concerned.
No politics whatever is involved in this
request, but the Catholics of the two
cities, who are opposing the bills, wanted
Hesly on the committee simply because
he is a clever lawyer who knows the de
tails of the case, and his presence would
save them several thousands of dollars in
lawyers' bills.
This view was presented to Dillon by in
fluential people of both towns, but he was
deaf to all arguments, and insisted that he
must be on the committee himself instead
of Heaiy, although he is not a lawyer and
knows nothing about the matters in
volved, and his appointment will necessi
tate retaining expensive counsel. As he
insisted, the Liberals could do nothing but
assent, though they had waived their
right to a man on the committee at the
request of the Derry Nationals Rolely to
make room for Healy.
I mention these details of a typical Dil
lon performance so that Irishmen in
America may comprehend why it is that
the home-rule movement, on which they
spent millions of dollars, has become a
pitiable laughing stock at home and
abroad.
The Irish land bill is of such scope and
contains such an intricable jumble of
good, bad and indifferent schemes that no
body is able yet to form a judgment
whether, as a whole, it will not be more a
harm than a benefit to Ireland. Its very
magnitude, however, suggests the shrewd
suspicion that there is no real intention of
passing it at all, and no one will be sur
prised if this happens.

Horrible Record of <Â» Woman Soted for
Her Piety.
LONDON, Ekg., April 18.â Mrs. Annie
Dyer and her son-in-law, Arthur Palmer,
baby farmers arrested on the charge of in
fanticide, were arraigned in the Reading
Police Court this mornicp; and remanded,
pending the result for further search for
bodies in the river, which the police are
now making. While the hearing was in
progress an angry crowd gathered outside
the court and indulged in menacing lan
guage toward the prisoners.
The developments in the case of Mrs.
Dyer are horrifying the country. It has
been proved that since Christmas twenty
children were intrusted to her keeping, and
that only four are living. The others have
vanished. Prior to Christmas many other
children who had been placed in her charge
disappeared. The woman has for a long
time practiced a wholesale system of infant
murder. It is suspected that she has
caused the death of over forty .children.
She lived in Reading, wnere she had the
reputation of piety. .
PERILS OF THE FIREMEN.
Two Killed and Many Injured
by Heat and Falling Walls
at Philadelphia.
The Old Pennsylvania Railroad Depot
Totally Destroyedâ Loss Esti
mated at $350,000.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., April 18.-The
old Pennsylvania Railroad depot at Thir
ty-second and Market streets, and the
trainshed, together with eight Pullman
car? and about thirty passenger coaches,
were totally destroyed by fire to-night.
Two firemen were killed by fallinp walls,
and over a dozen others were injured. The
loss is estimated at $350,000. The Penn
sylvania Railroad Company carried its
own insurance.
The dead are William Slaiger, aged 57
years, assistant chief engineer of the Phil
adelphia Fire Department, and Hugh Mc-
Grannigan, 48 years old, assistant foreman
of truck 1.
The injured are: George R. Preston, as
sistant foreman of truck A, will die ; Sam
uel Sneyd, ladderman, condition critical;
Philip Salberg, ladderman, condition seri
ous; William Bennett, assistant foreman;
Patrick Curtin, engineer; George N. Rey
nolds, ladderman ; Charles W. Rauw, lad
derman; Heury Douglass, fireman; Theo
dore O. Felton, fireman; John B. Lee,
foreman truck A, Edward Rosenfelto, fire
man; John Hart, railroad employe; W.
H. Sturgis, fireman.
Six Â«f these were overcome by heat.
David Weller, l(i years old, colored, was
run over by a wagon at the. fire and re
ceived a fractured arm and ribs.
The fire started at 4:30 o'clock, presum
ably from an explosion of gasoline in a
coal-bin under the trainshed. A number
of cars were saved by pusliing them by
main strength to places of safety. Eight
Pullman cars and about thirty passenger
coaches, however, were consumed. The
lire raged for six hours and it was not ex
tinguished until midnight.
. Shortly after 5 o'clock an iron portico in
front of the building fell and four firemen
were cauÃht in the debris and badly in
jured.. The most serious disaster occurred
two hours later, when a two-story wing of
the bui.'ding fell without warning, bnrying
half a dozen firemen under the mass of
hot bricks.
The men were rescued in a short time,
but Slaiger and McGrannigan had sus
tained fatal injuries. McGrannigan re
gained consciousness shortly before he
breathed his last and asked that a priest be
summoned. The clergyman arrived a few
minutes too late. He leaves a widow and
three children. Slaiger had been a fire
man for thirty years. Two children sur
vive him.
The building was occupied by several
officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad and
valuable records were destroyed.
HIBBEN KEPT IN CUSTODY.
Through tha Blunder of the Chicago Po
lice He Was Fined and Sent to
Bridewell.
CHICAGO, 111., April 18.-S. B. Hib
ben, manager of the Arizona Sandstone
Company of Santa Ana, Cal,, is a prisoner
at the Bridewell on a $10 fine for alleged
disorderly conduct, and his wife, who ac
companied him to Chicago from the coast
with a daughter, refused to-day to pay the
line so that her husband could be liber
ated. Mrs. Hibben's mother arrived here
last night from Lebanon, Indi. and the
couple left for Lebanon this afternoon,
after notifying the police. The Hibben
party arrived in town Thursday and Mr.
Hibben, who has been mentally unbal
anced since an operation was performed,
left the hotel, saying he was going to get
shaved. Nothing more was seen of him,
and the polite were asked to locate him.
It was learned that he pawned jewelry,
and it was supposed he had gone home on
a ticket he bought for Pasadena, Cal. He
was found wandering on the street, how
ever, by a policeman, to whom he said he
intended committing suicide. Although
he gave his right name and his disappear
ance had been circulated among all police
men, he was allowed to be fined and sent
to the Bridewell, where the superinten
dent discovered the blunder.
Trial of the. ytnaanrhuarttt.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., April 18.â The
battle-ship Massachusetts sailed from
Cramp's phip-yard at 2:30 o'clock this
afternoon for her official trip over the
ir.arkeii course between Cape Ann, Mass.,
and Cape Porpoise, Me. The Massachu
setts is nearer completion than any vessel
that has ever left Cramp's shipyard on a
trial trip, and if the occasion arose she
could meet an enemy on the high seas to
morrow..

Third Disaster Within Two
Weeks.
BUTTE, Mont., April 18.â The Broad*
water mine at Neihart was the scene of a
terrible explosion early this morning, re
sulting in the death of seven miners and
the serious injury of six others, some of
whom cannot recover. The dead are:
Frank Dorn, Jim Morrison, Hugh McKen
zie, Dan O'Leary, Dan Ross, John Kearns
and Joe Dearborn; injured, Mike Ward,
James Comity, Mike Coburn, James Gal
lagher and Joe Dorn.
Of the men killed all were single except
Frank Dorn. At Jast accounts James
Gallagher was dying. It is also feared
that three others will die. A special traia
carried the wounded to Great Falls.
Ttiere are several stories as to the cause
of the disaster, the most reasonable one
being that the magazine, a room used for
thawing powder at the middle tunnel of
the mine, exploded just as the men were
returning from lunch at 1 o'clock this
morning. One of the men was thawing
the powder with the too frequent result.
All the powder in the room, some thirty
sticks, was exploded. The explosion set
off a box of dynamite and scattered death
to the men who happened to be passing at
the time.
It is the worst accident that has ever
happened in Neihart, and tho town is
wrapped in gloom and mourning.
It is the third disaster that has occurred
in the State within two weeks, thus again
fulfilling the superstition that one big
mining accident is almost immediately fol
i lowed by two others.

WICHITA, Kaxs.,- April 18.â Bill Raid
ler, the outlaw recently convicted of at
tempting to rob the United States mails at
Dover, O. T., April j 3, 1895, was sentenced
in the Federal : court at Kingfisher, O. T.,
to-day to ten years' imprisonment in the
Ohio penitentiary. A motion for a new
trial was overruled, as was a motion to
suspend judgment. The case was appealed
to the Supreme Court. Pending the hear
ing Raidler was let out â on $5000 bail.
Raidler and Bill Doolin were partners in
crime and in captivity, and the capture of
both was the work of Deputy United States
Marshal D. Tilghman. The Dover train
robbery vras only one of the numerous
crimes in which Raidler was imi>Hcated.
He was one of the most daring and des

NOT FOE FKEE SILVER COINAGE
Approves of Cleveland's Course Only
So Far as It Relates to
Sound Money.
BROOKLYN, N. V., April 18.â A din
ner was given by the Montauk Club of
this city to-night in honor of Hon. Chaun
cey M. Depew's birthday. A large num
ber of distinguished persons were present.
After an,' address of welcome had been
delivered by the chairman Mr. Depew was
introduced. He was enthusiast ically re
ceived and spoke as follows:
"We are again, as we were four years
ago, in a Presidential year. 'We will all
ndinit that the conditions are reversed.
Then the handwriting was upon the wall'
which marked the success of the party
which had held power in the Government
for a generation. Then we all felt that
there was to be a condemnation of the sys
tem of protection as a principle of public
policy and the trial, in some form, of the
theory of free trade. We all know that
the cravings'for more currency would find
expression either in the debasement of
the currency or in a combination of forces '
as powerful and so threatening as to
endanger the continuance of settled stand
ards. But the handwriting is equally clear
upon the wall to-day that there is to be
another trial and a vigorous one of the
principle and practice of protection ; that
there is to be a defeat, and an overwhelm
ing one, of the friends of flat money, of a
debased currency or of the free coinage of
siver.
"The retirement from power of the Re
publican party after thirty-eight years of
rule was an event cf no ordinary import
ance; the advent into the possession of
every department of the Government of
tiie Democratic party and allies was an
event of extraordinary interest. These
four years vrill be remarkable for the
culmination of the facts and theories which
have come to the front since the Civil War.
Fifty years from now the story will
read like a romance of the rise of the
Populist party, its wild, vague, imposing,
impracticable theories, the singular pub
lic men whom it threw to the surface, its
capture of several States and its ability
to hold the balance of power in the Con
press of the United Btates and then its dis
integration and dissipation almost as rap
idly as it was organized.
'â¢No less interesting will be the history
ol the movement in favor of tl.e free coin
age of silver and the great proportions
which it assumed. While I differ entirely
from President Cleveland on almost every
point of his public policy, while I think his
theories, so far as the}' have been prac
tically carried out, have been disastrous
and if wholly carried out would have
been fatal to our industries, never
theless, in the frankness and the
fairness of this platform it is
due to him to say that the rout of the free
coinage, of silver policy and the energiz
ing of the National credit by the triumphs
of sound money are more largely due to
Ji is throwing upon the winning side with
magnificent courage and ability the whole
strength and power of hia great office and
of his administration than to anything
else.
"While we have had a period of distress
which has bronght so much suffering to
millions of homes, and while the cost has
been more than that of a disastrous war,
yet the suffering has not been in vain and
the cost has not been lost if it shall have
gained for as in education by discussion
and by the experiences of our people the
death of the absurdities of Populism and
the triumph of that sound money and un
questioned currency which shall keep this
great trading business and commercial
republic in honorable relations with and in
the lead among the great trading, business
and commercial nations of the world.
"But that will not be the only compen
sation. The experience of the last twelve
months has enforced the lessons of the ne
cessity of ability in diplomacy, and of a
foreign office which shall have in its per
manency and its power both the confi
dence of Congress and the country and
the ability to cope with dignity aDd
honor with every question which affects
the relations of the United States
with foreign Governments. We do
not differ as to the Monroe doc
trine as explained by Monroe and
Jefferson and Madison and Webster and
Calhoun, being the settled policy of the
country to be sustained at every cost and
every sacrifice. We do not differ in sym
pathy and the practical measures possible
to support it which should be given to the
Buffering Christians of Armenia and the
stoppage of the horrible massacres taking
place in that territory. We do not differ
in the feeling we all have that the
proconsular Government of the Ro
man Empire of the second cen
tury of its distant provinces with its
despotic authority and crushing exactions,
ought no longer to Â«xist anywhere in the
world, and especially in our neighborine
State, the island or Cuoa. But at Wash
ington these most delicate, most grave and
most difficult questions have been met by
resolutions and speeches which in the
laneuage of diplomacy and the custom of
foreign offices means a declaration of war.
"That magnificent revival of business so
hopeful for every industry which began
in the fall had become paralyzed by
March by the country daring neither to
invest nor employ nor to buy because of
continuing refusal to providetbe Govern
ment with the means for meeting its or
dinary obligations in the time of profound
peace, or buying great guns or building
fortifications for the protection of our
coasts and harbors, while at the same
time Congress was practically declaring
war every few days "and call
ing to some power to come on
and submit all differences, whether
formulated or not, to the arbitra
ment of war. There must come out of the
terrible cost of this method of diplomacy
â a cost without results, either in fame or
in territory or measure â a strengthening
of our diplomatic service and our Foreign
Office, and there must also come the
triumph of a movement begun within the
year and rapidly commanding the confi
dence and support of the best sentiment
of the civilized world for the creation of a
permanent international court of arbitra
tion to which nations, especially English
speaking nations, can with dignity and
honor submit every question in dispute
between them."

Favor Co-operation.
RALEIGH, N. C, April 18.â As a result
of the failure of the Populist and Repub

ment at yesterday's conference it is Baid
that Representative Skinner and four of
his associates on the Populist committee
have prepared and signed a statement
which Mr. Skinner will carry to Washing
ton to the effect that the vote in the Popu
list committee was nine to eight in favor
of co-operation. This is taken as a revolt

IS FOULLY ASSASSINATED
A Member of a Firm of Chicago
Painters Killed by Three
Unknown Men.
Supposed to Be a Result of an Un
successful Strike of Workmen
Last Winter.
CHICAGO,. 111., April 18.â John P.
Smith, a member of the firm of Patek,
Smith <fc Co., painters and decorators. 51
Market street, was mysteriously murdered
shortly after 2 o'clock this afternoon at
his place of business by three men, who
made their escape. The three men met
Smith in the basement of the building,
and after a few minutes' talk invited
Smith to step to the street. Smith went
to the stairs before the men, and as he
reached the top step, was struck with a
piece of easpipe on the head and instantly
killed. The men then fled. '
The firm had trouble with its painters
last winter and a strike resulted. The feel
ing was very bitter, and the murder is sup
posed to be a result of the unsuccessful
strike.
Six painters were arrested to-night on
suspicion of having murdered Smith. All
were discharged with the exception of a
man named John Ryan, and from evi
dence obtained it is almost certain that he
is the one that struck the blow that killed
the decorator. It is said that Ryan was
seen to pick out the gas pipe just before
the killing and ro to the office of Patek,
Smith & Co.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
FOR HARBORS
OF CALIFORNIA.
Progress of the Struggle
Before the Commerce
Committee.
SENATOR WHITE'S VIEWS
Favors the Continuous Contract
System for Oakland and
San Pedro.
THE APPROPRIATIONS ASKED.
Arguments Made by Those Who
Favor Improvement at Santa
Monica.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 18.âSen
ator White said to a Call correspondent
to-night:
"It is too early yet to form an opinion
as to what the Senate Commerce Con?
mittee will do as between San Pedro and
Santa Monica for the deep-water harbor
site. Several members of the committee
are pronounced in favor of Santa Monica,
including the chairman, Mr. Frye.
"I have already made a motion to put
Oakland Harbor under the continuous
contract system, and want to include the
inner harbor at San Pedro under this sys
tem if possible. As the bill stands no Cali
fornia river or harbor projects have been
provided for in this way, although other
States have been. Humboldt, of course,
is under the continuous contract Bystem,
but a former Congress made this provi
sion, and this should not militate against
our claim.
"The bill as it passed the House p ovides
for an outright appropriation of $100,000
for Oakland, and if I can get it put under
the continuous contract system and Con
gress authorizes the contracts to be made
to complete the projects recommended by
the board of engineers, the appropriations
will aggregate six or seven hundred thou
sand dollars. San Pedro's appropriation of
$50,000 for dredging is a pitiful sum, but if
I can secure the continuous contract
system for this harbor, at a cost of
$392,000 I would rather take the
$5000 to be immediately available, with a
certainty that contracts would be made to
complete the entire work, than to accept
$160,000 as a cash appropriation, with no
assurance that Congress would ever finish
the project. I will also make an attempt
to have the appropriation for the San Joa
quin River increased. I consider this a
very important work. The House bill only
allows this river $20,000, but it should have
$40,000 at least."
The Commerce Committee, of which
White is a member, has already voted to
increase the appropriation for San Diego
harbor from $40,000 to $50,000 and San
Luis Obispo from $32,000 to $40,000.
Several of the Los Angeles people will
leave for home to-morrow. Others will
remain here until the river and harbor
bill is reported to the Senate. The San
Pedro delegates feel that they have made
out a strong casa.
The outcome is a matter of great doubt,
however. Chairman Frye is a power in
that committee and his influence in favor
of Huntington's harbor may decide the
matter. Senators Jones of Nevada and
Squire of Washington are also actively at
work for Santa Monica. Senators White
and Elkins are doing everything in their
power for San Pedro.
Senator Frye has personally inspected
both harbor site 3 and says to his brother
committeemen: "I will never consent to
do anything for an outer harbor at San
Pedro until God does something for it."
A Californian said to-day: "If the
Lord helps those who help themselves
Huntington may receive some heavenly
aid, for he has been helping himself (to
Uncle Sam's cash) for a good many years."
FOB SANTA MONICA.
Argument* of Those Who favor a Deep-
Sea Harbor There.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 18.â The
fight between the rival towns of San Pedro
and Santa Monica for the proposed appro
priation of over $3,000,000 for a break
water and outer harbor was continued to
day in the Senate Committee on Com
merce.
John W. Mitchell, attorney, concluded
the argument he had begun yesterday in
favor of the claims of Santa Monica.
He declared that at least nine
tenths of the people of Los An
gelesâthe - commercial center of the
district â were in favor of the double appro
priation originally proposed by the House
Committee on Rivers and Harbors, $392,
--000 for the inner harbor at Ban Pedro and
$2,800,000 for the outer harbor at Santa
Monica.
He was reminded by Senator Vest
(D.) of Missouri ; more than once âas
were other gentlemen who made the
same sort of argument â the com
mittee was not concerned about pop
.ular sentiment in the .locality,
but only as to which of the two ports was
best adapted for a deep-sea harbor, in
view of the public interests. : Mitchell
questioned the action of the Lbs Angeles
Chamber of Commerce in favoring San
Pedro, and said the chamber misrepre
sented public sentiment. â 
James B. ) Lankershim of Los Angeles
also argued in favor iof the appropriation
for a breakwater at Santa Monica. He ad
mitted that â¢: for many years he. with
almost everybody else, had been in favor
of San Pedro. .
"Is not your change of mind and that of
these other people brought about," Sena
tor Berry . ; (D.) â â¢ of > Arkansas ' asked,
"attributable -in a large measure to
the fact that these people out
there came to believe that the in
fluences here at Washington were :so
strong against Ban : Pedro that that har
bor could not be built and that you came
to the conclusion that you had better. take
Santa Monica J than nothing. Is npt that
the fact?" _r â ; .
"Well, it is somewhat so," Mr. Lanker
shim admitted.
7 J. 8. Slausson of Los Angeles, chairman
of the delegation in favor of Santa Monica,
said there was a very largely divided opin
ion as %to which was the , best and ', most
feasible place for a deep-sea harbor. He
added with a good deal of :' humor that
petitions for one or ; for : the t other were
signed in ; very many instances by the
same men. 't;;
"Assuming that : you cannot get \ both
appropriations," Senator Nelsom asked,
"would it not be wiser to go on and com
plete the inner harbor at San Pedro?"
"Certainly," Slausson answered, "half a
loaf is better than no bread."
G. P. Hatch of Los Angeles gave an in
stance of the readiness and carelessness
with which Deople sign petitions, even
without reading them. He said that on
one occasion a petition was signed
by some 200 of the leading citizens of
Los Angeles, asking the Sheriff to
hang, before the next morning, the highly
popular Mayor of the city. He described
the attractions of Sani^ Monica and the
gradual extension of Los Angeles to that
seaport, predicting that in twenty years Los
Angeles would be a port of entry through
its absorption of Santa Monica, while on
the other hand he described San Pedro as
a miserable little fishing town, where no
one would stay over night if he could
possibly get away.
Stevens, who had spoken yesterday for
San Pedro, declared that there was an abso
lutely unanimous sentiment among all the
representative men of Los Angeles in
favor of an appropriation of $392,000 for
the inner harboi at San Pedro, and he
believed that was also the candid opinion
or the great majority of the people at
large. He admitted that there had been
recently <x change of sentiment, but said
that that change had been brought about
by telegrams from Washington as to the
intentions of the River and Harbor Com
mittee of the House. He added:
"We feel that the sovereign people of
Los Angeles County and district are en
titled to recognition by this Govern
ment, and if they cannot get .it
without making an aliie.nce with
these high powers, in the name
of God give us nothing. I want
to go home preserving my man
hood. If I learn that nothing can
be obtained from this authority ex
cept upon the surrender of principle,
I will go home and strike my name from
the Great Register of voters, surrender my
citizenship and forswear my country. That
is the way I feel about it, and many with
me feel the same-way."
Senator White, who had conducted the
inauiry and had introduced the several
members of the two delegations, thanked
the committee for its politepess and at
tention and Chairman Frye declared the
hearing closed.
TO AVOID PROSECUTION
Interstate Commerce Violators
Willing to Inform Against
Rate- Cutters.
Anxious for a Clean Bill of Health So
That They May Start on a
New Career.
CHICAGO, 111., April 13.â 1n railroad
circles to-day the report was circulated
that the passenger and freight associations
had made a proposition to the Interstate
Commerce Commission offering to furnish
evidence in the future against rate-cutting
officials and cut-rate receiving shippers as
a peace offering in view of the threatened
prosecutions in the Federal Court here
next month for violation of the interstate
commerce act.
It is said the associations will act as in
formers against individual railroad men,
both in and out* of their associations, as
well as against shippers who insist on get
ting a lower rate than smaller competitors
in business on condition that all cases of
violation of the law ftrior to the Brown
decision be dropped by the commission.
With this reported clean bill of health
the railroads are to start on a new career
of strict observance of the law, each road
protecting itself from the importunate
shipper through its respective association.
Since the Federal Grand jury subpena
sensation developed it is reported that the
big local shippers who have been recip
ients of cut rates have been frightened into
ordering all such rates canceled. Only two
subpenas have been served so far as known.

had disposed of considerable property
made out in their names and had robbed
their husbands of considerable cash before
their departure.
Suspicion was at once aroused, and it

Telegrams have been sent to St. Louis de

BULUWAYO, South Africa. April 18.â
A mounted British force numbering forty
while reconnoitering In the outskirts yes
terday encountered a large advance party
of Matabeles, whom it immediately en
gaged. After two hours of severe fighting
the natives were driven back on the main
body with the loss of tifty killed. The
British had only one man wounded. The
patrol party returned to Buluwayo.
Considerable alarm was occasioned in
the evening by the sudden appearance of
a number of natives in the vicinity of the
town. They avowed friendliness, but
nevertheless were brought into town and
detained. The anxiety of the residents of
Buluwayo increases hourly. The relief
column from Salisbury is now reported
within forty miles of Buluwayo and ad
vancing steadily.
Cecil Rhodes, ex-Premier of the Cape
Colony, who intended accompanying the
column, is still at Salisbury, his health
not having improved sufficiently to per
mit his leaving that place.
LONDON, Eng., April 18.â Major-Ge
neral Sir Frederick Carrington, at present
commanding the infantry brigade at Gib
raltar, has been appointed to the supreme

has telegraphed to all military officers who
are away from South Africa on 'cave of
absence to hold themselves in readiness to
immediately return to their regiments.

ANNUAL CONCLAVE
OF THEOSOPHISTS
Preparations for Gathering
the American Memhers
at New York.
SUCCESSOR OF JUDGE.
An Unknown Man of Great
Power May Lead the Es
oteric Branch,
SECRECY OF HIS IDENTITY.
Peculiar Qualifications Required for
the Head of the Wonderful
Society.
NEW. YORK, N. V., April IS.-The
Theosopbical Society in America will hold
its annual conclave in New York City,
April 26. The convention will be the I
most important in the history of * tbe or
ganization. The announcement that the
meeting will take place in New York will '
prove a surprise, as several weeks ago an i
official notice was sent to all the branches :
naming Chicago as the place. The change i
was made for a peculiar reason. It was
the result of the request by a mysterious
adept in . the society, whose existence had '<â 
been unsuspected, and who made known j
his wish in a communication to the execu
tive committee. That the highest body in
the society should thus bow to the wishes
of a stranger suggests that the explanation J
must b: one out of the ordinary. Arid i
such is the case.
In the Theosophical Society there are \
two bodies, called the exoteric and the ;
occult. Tije former is the society known !
to the worid, which holds open meetings, !
discusses philosophy and ; religion and j
carries on its propaganda like other re- |
ligious and humanitarian institutions. I
The occult is a secret , body of adepts, pos
sessing psychic powers, and is under the
direct guidance of the great beings known
as Mahatmas, who reside in Thibet. This
body is credited with doing most of its
work on the invisible planes, influencing j
the souls of nian.guid'inz nations and j
taking part in the governance of the
affairs of the planet generally. ,t\ Â£i '* ; *
In tne occult body there is no such
thing as the election of officer?. The chief
is appointed by the Mahatmas and is an
adept o:i whom the mantle of leadership !
; naturally falls by reason of his develop-
i nient. Mme. Blayatskyjwas head of this
body during her life and was succeeded Dy
,W. Q. Judge. When the latter died on
; Mjrch '21, last, itlooked as thou^h'there
was none to succeed .him. 'Among the
qualifications necessary ior such leader
ship" are the power to leave, the body -it
will and transport'oneseif to any.distant
place and to communicate with disciples | "
and the Mahatmas by thought-transfer
ence. No one was known withiii the ranks
of the society to possess these powers suf
ficiently developed and there was consid-
I eraole anxiety until an examination of
Dr. Judge's effects was made.
A complete surprise was in store. A
document was found which stated over
the departed chief's signature that there
was in the society a real adept who had
veiled himself in such obscurity that his
very existence was known to scarcely half
a dozen members. Mr. Judge named him
as successor. But the paper contained an
injunction that his name and identity
must be kept a secret for a specified time,
said to be one year. Mr. Judge's indorse
ment secured a prompt acceptande of the
new head, albeit he will remain unknown
for months. The unknown is not an
official in the Theosophical Society, but
as an adept the executive committee did
not hesitate to defer to his wishes.
The principal event at the coming con
vention will be the election of a new presi
dent in place of Mr. Judee. This is an
affair of the exoteric organization and
does not carry with it occult leadership.
If the new adept were known he could
doubtless be elected, but as that would in
volve the disclosure of his identity his
name cannot be presented. It is believed,
however, that he will be at the convention
incognito, as it has leaked out that he is
now in New York.
Many think Dr. J. D. Buck of Cincinnati
will be chosen president, but there is one
obstacle in the way. The headquarters
are in New York, while all of Dr. Buck's
interests are centered in the place of his
residence, and he says he could not move.
An arrangement might be made, however,
whereby he could be represented at head
quarters by Claude b alls Wright, who is
ex-secretary to botn Mme. Blavatsky and
William Q. Judge and resides there. If
j Dr. Buck does not permit the presentation
; of his name no one can say who may be
1 selected. Dr. Buck is a physician of note
and for many year 3 was dean of Pulti
' Medical College, Cincinnati. All his life
he has been a deep student of mysticism,
Egyptology and mathematics, and is said
to have one of the most valuable libraries
of mystical works in the country.
He hrst heard of the Theosophical Soci'
ety in 1879, and wrote to Mme. Blavatsky
i for information. She received the letter
j in London as she was boarding ship for
! India, and dashed off a characteristic
! re Ply, using the top of a barrel on the j
I deck as a table. The doctor joined at j
i once. His wife became a member in 1885, i
: and the following year W. Q. Judge visited
Cincinnati and initiated the doctor's two
sons and one daughter and the doctor's
j wife's two sisters, making seven theoso-
I phists in one family. The doctor has been
president of the branch in Cincinnati
since its formation, a member of the
executive committee of thÂ« society in
America for many years, and last year was
elected vice-president. Since Mr. Judge's
death he has been acting president. He
is over six feet tall, of massive build, has
a high forehead and a strong, though
kindly face. He is a skilled parliamen
tarian, and for years has presided over the
annual conventions. He will doubtless be
called upon to take the chair at the com
ing meeting. He is author of "A Study of
Man," a theosophical scientific work, and
is a prominent contributor to theosophicai I
publications.
Next in importance will be the election
of a vice-president. Dr. Jerome A. An
derson of San Francisco may be
named for tins office. He holds
the strings on the Pacific Coast. He
also is a noted physician, is the author of I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
many papers on medical science, and has 1
published two well-known theosophical
books, "Reincarnation" and "Sevenfold
Man.' 1 He founded the new Californian
Magazine, and is editor of the Pacific
Theosophist. He is president of the San
Francisco Theosophical Society, and a
| member of the executive committee of the
i Theosophical Society in America.
Dr. Anderson was a remarkable child.
j He could read at the age of four, and en-
I listed in the United States cavalry at the
j age of 16. Though self-educated he passed
without preparation an examination , in
cluding a course of twenty-seven studies
of the California public school system, and
got a percentage of 96. He was graduated
j from the Medical College of Ohio, and
' completed his education in the medical
I department of the University of Califor
| nia. He is president of the Alumni As
sociation of his department of the uni
versity, and is a fellow of the San Fran
cisco Gynecological Society and many
other medical associations.
E. August Nordsheimer, a wealthy dia-
I mond merchant of Maiden lane, New
! York, is treasurer of the society, and will
doubtless be re-elected.
Claude Falls Wright will be one of the
chief personages at the gathering, and
may prove a dark horse. Should he con
sent to being nominated he might be
elected to almost any office, from presi
dent down. Though only 29 years old, he
is believed by many to possess strange
powers, but he transforms himself into a
veritable sphinx when approached on the
subject. Like the late Mme. Blavatsky,
he is constantly doing things calculated
to dumfound conventional people .J He
hates conventionalism. His hair and
beard are a shade of red which produces
an almost luminous effect. His fund of
learning Is prodigious. He is quiet, re
fined and mild-looking, and has a habit of
making a good impression on people and
then of shocking them by eccentricities
believed to be deliberate. He eats only
one or two meals a day, sleeps little, and
thinks nothing of sitting at his desk
eighteen hours at a stretch. He has
lectured in almost every State in the
Union. He is the author of "Modern
Theosophy," and of innumerable articles
and papers.
Mr. Wright is a native of Dublin. He
studied for the ministry, then applied
himself to civil engineering and wound up
studying surgery at the Royal College of
Surgeons, Dublin. A remarkable incident
brought him into the Theosophical Soci
ety. He was calling on a young lady in
Dublin one evening when she suddenly
fell at his feet and went into a trance. She
said that she had a message to deliver and
that she was instructed to say that he was
to go to Mme. Blavatsky in London and
work for theosophy. He packed up at
once. Mr. Wright is a first cousin of Dr.
Edward Wright, librarian of the British
Museum. His mother is a daughter of
Lady Salkeld and his father was a cousin
of General Falls of Crimean fame.
The Theosophical Society has root in
every part of the world and delegates will
be present representing the four quarters
of the globe. Some confusion was created
by the change of ulace of holding the con
vention, and as a result a list of delegates
who will attend has not yet been made up.
The following are among the most promi
nent members, some of whom have already
announced that they will be in New York:
Mrs. Alice Cleather of London, wife of
Colonel Barclay Cleather of the Roysl Ar
tillery; Baron Opparnan of Belgium; Din
sha P. Ghadiali, electrician and jparsee
philosopher of Bombay, who is now in
this country ; Dr. Frank yon Hartmann of
1 Germany, physician, philosopher and au
thor of many mythical works; Judge
Edward O'Ronrke of Fort Wayne, of the
Indiana Suoreme Court; Ernest T. Har
grove, barrister, of Middle Temple, Lon
don; Lady Olivia Peterson of Paris; Miss
Katheritie HilJard, the Dante scholar und
poetess; Samuel Janer Ronan of Sancti
Spiritu, Cuba, now in this country; Charles
Johnston, F.It.A.S. and M.A., of the Ben
gal Civil Service, the famous English Ori
entalist; Professor William Crookes, the
great English chemist, who invented the
Crookes tubes, so largely used in X-ray
experiments; Mrs. Benson, wife of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, whose two sons
recently organized a theosophical society
in London; Fred J. Dick, engineer in the
British Civil Service at Dublin, and Ca
mille Flammarion, the French astronomer.
The delegates in this country will repre
sent almost every State, and most of the
! Canadian provinces will also have dele
gates.
It is said that there will also be present
ten members of the mysterious medieval
Rosicruoian Fraternity. The principal
session will be held in the concert-Hall at
Madison-square Garden. A string band,
composed of New York theosophists, and
including Schcnch, the cellist, and Herr- |
j mann, the violinist, will be in attendance.
After the convention, which will end
' Monday or Tuesday, a reception will be
given in the evening at 144 Madison
avenue, where the society has a $50,000
headquarters. The building contains
many curiosities. The walls of one room
are covered with Hindoo and Japanese sa
cred pictures and symbols, and one frame
'incloses a leaf from the sacred Bo tree, un
der whic'i, 2500 years ago, Buddha at
tained enlightenment. In a glass case is a
complete set of Brahmin tools of worship*
numbering twenty-three pieces, believed \
to be the only set in America. The sar- j
cophagus containing one-third of Mine.
Blavatsky's ashes is in the same room.
Jn the library is a collection of valuable
esoteric works and manuscripts, including
about twenty manuscript volumes from
the pen of the late General Abner Double
day, who was once president of the Theo
aophical Society of New York.
It is expected that a bronze bust of \v.
Q. Judge, on which work is now being
rushed, will be completed in time to be un
veiled.
ThÂ« Manitoba School Queation.
LONDON. Esq., April 18. â The St.
James Gazette, in an article on the Mani
toba school question, says that Sir Charles
Tupper's speeches on the subject indicate
clearly and concisely tne policy of the
Canadian Government in the matter. The
Dominion Government, the paper siys,
has been consistent and persistent in try
ing to dispose of the diiliculty without
needless delay upon the lines of the Brit
ish North America act, and the act under
which Manitoba became a part of the Do
minion of Canada.
Sona of Dueliata to Fight.
LONDON. Exg., April 18.â The Standard
says a duel is imminent between the sons
of Count yon Kotze and Baron yon Schra
der, arising out of a quarrel between their
fathers, which resulted in the recent deatii
of Baron yon Schrader, from the effects of
a wound received in a duel with Yon
Kotze.

Regarded as a Judgment

: BERLIN, Germany^ April 18. â The
party of the Center in '. the Jluichstag has
decided to put some questions to Chancel
lor yon Hohenloue in leganl to the recent
I German duels and ask to :be informed
what measures the, Government .proposes
to take to prevent similar encounters in
the 1 future, .i. The question j will . also ba
raised yinv in the Prussian Landtag. s This
movement of the Centrists finds support
in the highest social quarters .and is also
championed , by all of the leading Berlin
j and provincial newspapers, and it is sig
nificant that a journal of the character of
'. the Cologne Gazette, in a series of articles
on the : subject, deplores the injury to its
prestige which the court continues to suf
: fer from â  its supposed sympathy with
dueling and appeals to the Emperor to in
tervene and rigorously put a stop to the
practice. . â â â.,:; ;. ;-,â -:,â ..>â ,â â .,.,;â 
; In the. meantime the increasing public
Bentiment against dueling^ has prevented
a series of duels which were expected to
arise out of the Kotze-Schraeder affair.
| The meeting which was arranged between
j Barons Lanciren . 1 and . Lahn : ; has , been
i stopped, and several other impending en
j counters - are : off. ; Lieberecnt ; yon ( Kotze
and his family have left Berlin for the south

"; ; A-j majority of those who . are c fully i in
formed . as : to the quarrel â  between Yon
Kotze and "Schraeder consider the death
I of ' the latter las a kind of , Gottesgericht
(judgment of God). When the scandal
was first bruited; in, the summer of : 1894,
Schraeder was designated in the United
Press dispatches '** as the originator of
the trouble â which resulted in Kotze's
long ; string , of * misfortunes,. vÂ«; his
unjust imprisonment under the order of
the Emperor and his subsequent private
trial "and " release with a tainted name,
amounting to sociai and official ' death.
Schraeder,, was , Kotze's . accuser t . and r3
mained his bitter enemy even after bis in
nocence had been â â  proved. The newspa
pers allege that Schraeder addressed a let-
I ter to the Emperor prior to the duel en
deavoring to clear himself of any share in
the scandal, but it cannot be learned that
any such letter exists.
There has also been a complete change
in the attitude of the Emperor. For a
long time his Majesty placed the great
est reliance upon Schraeder, but latterly
j he turned against him, and his studied
contempt for him was shown by his omis
sion to send a 'wreath to his funeral and
i his refusal to permit the use of the
Friedrichskirche or the Garnisonskirche
at Potsdam for the deceased master of cer
emonies. In spite of the action which
the Emperor had taken, however, a large
contingent of court society testified their
respect for the deal duelist.
The Dowager Empress Frederick, al
though very strong in her condemnation
i of the practice of dueling, sent to the fam
ily of Baron yon Sclirae Jer a message of
sympathy and condolence, and also sent a
wreath of roses to be placed upon the
coffin. The body of Baron yon Schraeder
was taken on Thursday to Ratzeburg,
the family seat. The parish clergyman re
fused to give the body a Christian burial.
and Court Chaplain Wendelandt officiated
in his place. The Ratzeburg veterans
tired a volley over his grave.
The delay in taking any action agairst
yon Kotze for the killing of yon Schraeder
has created a widespread suspicion that
the authorities are desirous that the popu
lar feeling against dueling shall abate be
fore any application is made to tne law,
not wishing to brand the custom as an ab
solute offense. In support of this idea it j
is observed that the Hamburger Nacd- j
richten, Prince Bismarck's organ, in an
article on toe subject indicates a certain
reaction in favor of the practice, contend
ing that the higher classes cannot wholly j
abandon the usage, which has a distinct
ive social value.
The report circulated by the German
and foreign press that there has been a re- !
newal of the Dreibund treaties is an out- j
come of the meetings of the Emperor and j
King Humbert and Emperor Francis Jo
seph of Austria, but they are greatly at
variance with the open facts.
The treaty between Germany and Aus- j
tria is not subject to periodical renewal. It |
has no fixed term of duration and theo- |
retically continues forever, though prac- j
tically it can be repudiated at any time, j
The treaties between Italy and Germany
and Italy and Austria, however, are ipso
facto renewable every five years unless I
they are respectively renounced upon |
either side one year before their expira
tion. The last renewal of these treaties
was made in 1592. The Hamburg Corre
spondenz. an official organ, denies the sug
gestion that any question of renewal or
alteration of the Dreibund past was in
volved in the recent meeting of the mon
arehs party to that alliance.
A considerable number of members of
the Colonial Association are forming a
new organization in consequence of the
very general dissatisfaction in colonial
circles by the scandals affecting Dr. Carl
Peters. Prince yon Arneberg, chairman
of the Reichstag Committee on Colonial
Affairs, and Dr. Hammacher, leader of the
National Liberal party in the Reichstag,
are at. the head of the movement.
Some reflects of the disturbances be
tween the natives and Germans in South
South Africa are to be seen in a menaced
uprising of the natives in German-African

CHICAGO, 111., April 18. â Western
roads have agreed to make a rate of one
fare for the round trip for the Republican
National Convention at St. Louis. The
same rate has been agreed to for the Dem
ocratic convention to be held in Chicago.
The Prohibitionists will be given the same

MAJfXO WK.4DS GUILT*.
With Windrath He Committed Murder
and Robbery.
CHICAGO, 111., April 18.â Julius Man
now startled Judge riorton and sent the
revolvers and red pepper plots into total
eclipse Friday by getting up and declaring
that he and Joseph AVindrath were guilty
of the murder and robbery of Carey B.
Birch, cashier of the West Chicago Street
Railway Company on June 23 last. The
court informed the prisoner that he must
not feel too certain that his plea would se
cure leniency for him. Windrath's at
torney and friends pleaded with him to
have him also admit his guilt, but the
prisoner refused to do so, claiming that he
was innocent. In his confession Mannow
involved a third person, Albert ScbalK.
No attempt will be made to prosecute
Albert Schalk for conspiracy to rob, as he
has become a witness for the State. When
it was ascertained that the efforts to have
Windrath plead guilty were futile Judge
Horton ordered the trial to proceed.

California.
DOUBLES CLEVERLY CONTESTED.
Perfict Team Work G;ves the Cardinal
a Victoryâ Santa Clara Beaten
at Baseball.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oal., April
18.â The day has been made exciting by a
succession of athletic events, such as have
not taken place for many months on the
campus. This morning Stanford settled
the intercollegiate tennis championship
tournament in her favor by winning one
of the single matciies, as well as the
double. Inasmuch as she had won three
of the nine matches last Saturday in San
Francisco the two victories to-day settled
the championship of the two universities,
and Stanford has added another defeat to
the list she already has against her rival.
The matches this morning were between
Freeman (Stanford) and Magee (Berkeley)
and Picher (Stanford) and Gage (Berkeley).
Magee wou his sets and matches by the
following score, 6â4, 6â3, 6 â 3; while
Picher defeated Gage, 6â2, 6â3, 6âl.
Freeman played a much poorer game
than he did a week ago, and his lobs and
place shots, which practically won him
his former games, were seriously interfered
with by a heavy wind which was blowing.
Magee played a swift, smashing game from
6tart to rinish. His volleys were irresistible
and Freeman had some trouble in neeo
tiating wiih Magee's hot drives. Freeman
played a steady game. His coolness and
freedom from all show of temper won for
him no little admiration. His forte is evi
dently line game, while Magee is most
powerful at the net.
In the Picher-Gage match, Picher had
things his own way and played much the
better game of the two men. He is very
strong at backhand strokes and to-day
showed remarkable accuracy in placing hia
balls just out of Gage's reach. Gage, on
the other hand, seemed apathetic, redeem
ing himself occasionally by a brilliant
stroke.
The ereat interest of the morning settled
on the doubles between Freeman-Picher
and Matree-Giee. This series was by far
the most exciting doubles played for years
on Stanford courts. The perfect team
work of Freeman and Picher made them
easy victors, but Magee's speed and Gage's
general su mess made matters look
rather doubtful at first. The first set went
to Magee and Gage by a score of 6â4.
Then wa<Â« seen in the second set what good
team work really means. Freeman livened
up and showed something o; his usual
form, while Picher played with unusual
care and skill. Tne result was that the
Stanford men won a 6âo set.
The foilowing two seta went to Stanford
by scores of 6âl anl 6â3. After the first
set there was no time when Berkeley was
not clearly outclassed, both Magee and
Gage seemng to regard a Stanford victory
as a foregone conclusion.
Stanford's diamond was occupied by the
nines of Berkeley and Santa Clara College
this afternoon. Berkeley won the game.
Score, 8 to 1. Berkeley* played winning
ball from the first pitch. Its outfield made
pome grandstand catches of difficult fles
and the inr.eld was very accurate. Wheeler
was rather slow at getting the ball down
to second, but Berkeley's "southpaw" mo
tion gave few men chances to get around
the bases that far. Santa Clara owed its
defeat largely to its weakness in the box.
Galtez has a slow ball, and his curves are
not of the most perplexing cut. As a re
sult, notwithstanding excellent work by
the outfielders as well as those on the
bases, Saata Clara lost a game that might
have been a victory. Shortstop Custer
was a weak brother at critical moments.

GOOD BOXIXG BOVT3.
Satn Tonkins Given the Decision Over
Jimmy Handler.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 18.-The
boxing houts at the New Manhattan Ath
letic Club attracted a big crowd of mem
bers and their friends to the gymnasium
of the club to-night. Four bouts were de
cided and furnished gooil sport.
The event of the evening was a ten
round argument at 142 rounds between
Jimmy Handler of Newark and Sam
Tonkins of Astoria, L.I. It was one of
the best bouts seen in the club for some
time. Both men fought fast and furiously.
Handier was the aggressor until the
seventh round, when a terrific right
hand uppercut on the jaw knocked him on
the ropes. Handler was in a dazed condi
tion, and the referee seeing that a knock
out was inevitable stopped the bout and
gave Tonkins the decision.
The ten-round bout between Larry Burns
of Ohio and Johnnie Gorman of Lonjr
Island City did not come off, as Burns
failed to show up. The management sub
stituted Tommy White of Chicago for
Burns. The lads were evenly matched
and Referee Frawley declared the bout a
draw.
Portland's Baseball Revival.
PORTLAND. Ok,, April 18.â Glenalvin's

it, the Gladiators showed up in good form.
The score was 35 to 7 in favor of Portland.

all disputes were amicably adjusted.
LOST IX THE SIERRA.
A Butte County Mail- Carrier' Â» Adventure
in a Storm.
CHICO, Cal., April 18.-Tbe task of the
mail-carriers over the Sierra Nevada dur
ing the wintry seasons is fraught with
many dangers. The difficulties they must
overcome are sometimes very great, and
narrow escapes from deatu are frequent.
Mail-carrier Roberts, well known in Butte
County, was a victim of the late storm in
the mountains. Roberts carries the maii
between Powellton and Prattville, a dis
tance of fifty miles. While on his return
trip a few days ago he fell into a lake near
Chaparral House. At the Butte Creek
House he dried his clothing and resumed
his iourney, but in crossing the Humbug
Summit he lost his way and was out in
the storm three days. He at last reached
Humbug, and a physician was sent for,
who stated that both of Roberts' feet were
so badly frozen that they would have to
be amputated.

STOCKTON, Cal.. April 18.-J. D. Mc-
Dougald, who has the contract for grad
ing the roadbed of the San Joaquin Val
ley Railway between the Merced River
and Merced, was in the city to-day. He
says that the tracklayers will reach the
river by Monday night, and then the re
maining timbers of the bridge across the
river will be sent forward without delay.
All the piling for the bridge has been
driven, and all the bents are in. The
lumber will begin to arrive at the front by
Tuesday or Wednesday, and then the
building of the structure will be pushed
alone rapidly. The bridge will be com
pleted within fifteen days, according to
the calculations of Mr. AJcDougald. His
contract for grading calls for fifteen miles
of work between the bridze and Merced,
and he already has five miles finished and
is making about a mile a day of grade.
The tracklayers can wortc right on through
to Merced as soon as the bridge is com
pleted.
The contract for grading between Mer
ced City and the Cbowc ilia ha 3 not been
let, but beyond the last named point
Grant Brothers are at work now. They
commenced yes'erday and are fast push
ing the grade for the road soutnward.
The work of track laying was resumed
to-day on the Alameda and San Joaquin
Railway, and now only ten miles are to be
put down before the road will be com
pleted from Stockton to the mines at Cor
ral Hollow. It is expecte i that the con
struction will be completed before the first
of May, and it is possible that some sort
of excursion may be arranged soon
after the completion of the road.
In speaking of the situation to-day Sur
veyor Atherton said that there should be
some kind of demonstration here, as the
finishing of the coal road marked a new
era in the history of Stockton. It would
enable all the manufacturing interests to
prosper as they have never done before.
Cheap coal will soon be laid down here,
and the manufacturers will have an oppor
tunity to see whether it is all that has been
said of it.

OREAT PHYSICAL STRENGTH
is not necessary to the enjoyment of per-
fect health, yet strong, healthy organs
and faculties give rise to the most de-
lightful sensations of existence.
Exercise, common sense and ordinary
precaution and you need never be very
sick. When you find your stomach
troublesome, your bowels inactive, your
nerves sensitive â look out ! When your
weight is decreasing, when your energy
is waning, when exertion seems impossi-
ble and sleep does not give rest â look
out!
Serious illness has its beginning in
neglected little things. Even dread con-
sumption comes on by degrees, and may
begin with a very slight derangement.
Taken in time, 98 per cent, of all cases
of consumption can be cured. Taken in
time, no disease need be really serious.
The best safeguard against disease is an
active, healthy liver. That means good
blood and good blood means good solid
healthy flesh.
The germs of disease seek out the weak
spots in the body. Don't have any weak
spots. If you have them now, clear them
out, tone them up, make them strong.
Dr. Pierce s Golden Medical Discovery
will do it. It searches out all poisonous
matter and disease-germs of whatever
character. It regulates the action of the
organs of the whole body. It forces out
impure matter, makes the blood rich and
puts new life into every fiber. It makes
good, firm, healthy flesh â doesn't make
fat. It gives you flesh that you can work
with â the flesh that means "health, but a
reasonable plumpness is essential to the
best bodily condition.
Dr. Pierce s Golden Medical Discovery
is pleasant to take and you don't have
to take an ocean of it to get well either.

GHASTLY FIND NEAR FRESNO.
School-Children Discover a Corpse on the
River Bankâ May Be That of
William Wootien.'
FRESNO, Cal., April 18.â Professor
Sorensen and his pupils of the Easton
School made a ghastly find to-day on the
ranch of Martin Brotners, on the south
bank of the San Joaquln River, about fif
teen miles north of this city. The scnool
children were enjoying an outing and
picnic near the river's bank, and while
clambering over some driftwood which
had lodged against a clump of willows
they were horror-stricken at disturbing
the body of a man in an advanced state of
decomposition. The instructor's attention
was called to the discovery *and he made
as careful an inspection of the cadaver as
circumstances would permit.
The body was that of a white man, ap
parently about 40 years of age. He nad
worn fairly good clothing, including dark
coat and vest, buff trousers and congress
waiter shoes. The beard of the deceased,
which was well preserved, was light
colored and about four inches long. He
had been a man of 5 feet 8 or 9 inches in
height. The surroundings indicated
drowning, since the body nad certainly
floated out with the debris. The impres
sion of Sorensen was that death had
ensued about a year ago.
Owing to the condition of the corpse,
nothing but conjecture can be made as to
the cause of death. There are many per
sons who believe the body is that of the
body is that of the long-missing William
Wobtten, because of whose disappearance,
after a presumably forged transfer of his
realty, Professor Sanders is now in the
County Jail here. Coroner Long will con
auct a careful investigation to-morrow.
CATALINA ISLAND SCARE
Adventure of a Pleasure Party
on the Launch Fleetwing
in a Gale.
Driven Into the Shelter of a Distant
Harbor, Their Absence Causes
Great Alarm.
AVALON, Catalina Island, April 18.â
Considerable excitement and alarm was
occasioned last evening, when a Darty of
sixteen persons, which left early in the
morning for a trip round the island, failed
to return. A stiff breeze, which gradually
increased to a gale, had sprung up during
the day and a high sea was running, mak
ing it almost impossible to come up the
seaward shore of the island, which was the
route by which the pleasure party was to
return. As darkness came on and the
Fleetwing, the stanch littie launch which
carried the party, did not appear the grav
est apprehensions were felt, and at 9
o'clock a searching party was sent out on
La Paloma by the Banning Company.
The yacht proceeded at once to the isth
mus and there, quartered in the old Gov
ernment barracks, were the voyagers
seated around a glowing stove in the big
main ball singing and swapping sea
stories.
It seems the Fleetwing encountered no
difficulty un_til it attempted to round the
end of the island, when the heavy seas be
gan coming in and a terrific gale sprang
up. Captain Macdoneil, who is an able
seaman, put out six or seven miles to sea
before he could with safety round the
point and several hours were consumed in
accomplishing this feat, so it was well into
the afternoon before Catalina harbor, the
point on the see ward side of the isthmus,
was reached. The gale increased momen
tarily and it was not thought safe to re
turn to Avalon, a distance of some twenty
rive miles, with the course on the seaward
side of the island. At the isthmus the
island narrows to the width of a half mile.
Here the voyagers walked across and took
refuge in the barracks.
Some of the party returned in La
Paloma to Avalon last night, reaching
port at 1 o'clock this morning, but the ma
jority remained at the isthmus and re
turned on the Fleetwing this morning, en
countering heavy seas and meeting with
minor mishaps, but coming into harbor
with flying colors and cheering lustily for
the little craft and its brave captain.
SOLANO OFFICERS WIN.
Judge Buckles Upholds the Constitu-
tionality of the Four-Year
Term.
VALLEJO, Cal., April 18.â A dispatch
to the Vailejo Chronicle from Fairtield to

of Hale vs. the County Clerk in favor of
the plaintiff, holding that the defendant

decision upholds the constitutionality of

county was unconstitutional. Under the
ruling the officers of Fresno County
elected for two years will have to serve
four years. The case will go to the Su
preme Court at the May term, and a de
cision is looked for in July.

SANTA ROSA LITIGATION.
Harry Hall Seeks to Recover on
a Judgment Against the
City.
Ex-Treasurer Vanderhoof to Be Sued
for Public Funds Still in His
Possession.
SANTA ROSA, Cal.. April 18.â This
city has suffered for the past few years
from a multiplicity of lawsuits growing
out of sewer damage and the strife over
the new water works. Some time ago
Harry Hall obtained judgment against
the city for $3000 and costs for damages
claimed to have been suffered by him from
the proximity of the aewer farm to his
property.
Hall to-day commenced another suit to
restrain the city from paying any more
money out of the treasury until his claim
is settled. He also asks for a writ of man
damus, directing the proper city officers
to issue a warrant to him for $3358 50, the
amount of his judgment and costs and 7
per cent interest from the date of the
judgment.
Another lawsuit in which the city must
be a party is forthcoming. This will be an
action against ex-City Treasurer M. V.
Yanderhoof to recover $1610- This sum
was retained by Vanderhoof when he made
his final report last week, claiming that it
was due to him as the commission of 1 per
cent allowed by law on the sum of $161,000
paid by the city for the new water works.
The contention will be tnat the $161,000
did not pass through the Treasurer's
hands, being still outstanding as a claim
against the city in the shape of bonds.
Vanderhoof, who has the money safe in
his possession, smiles confidently when
the case \a mentioned and says that if he
is pressed any in the matter he will de
mand an additional 1 per cent on all the
money handled by him during his term of
office.
The law declares that the Treasurer shall
receive as fees 1 per cent upon all moneyÃ
received and disbursed, and most of Van
derhoof's predecessors interpreted the law
very liberally to themselves in this respect,
it being only during the past few years
that the present system of retaining only
single fees has been in vogue.

by the engineer being when he found him
standing at his side. Leaving that posi
tion the man walked toward the flywheel
pit, a large pillar obscuring him from
further gaze... He was next seen when
lifted from the pit. .... * ; â .-,
It iÂ« dark where the accident occurred,
and in all probability the intoxicated man
mistook the fast whirling belt for a solid
surface and stepped upon it. Instantly he
was thrown into and against the masonry
of the pit, his body being crushed and
drawn by the huge belt until it had worked
far enough down into the narrow space be
tween the wheel and the wall to serve as a
brake and stop the engine. There was
never a cry, never- a moan. The moment
Turner's feet touched the belt he : was
whirled against the stone of the pit, and
then, his body rolling over, the breath was
forced from his lungs, his ribs broken and
but the semblance of life left in him.
Dr. Whiting's examination showed the
skull to be fractured, the brain filled with
blood and almost every bone in the upper
part of the man's body broken.

VIEW RIVERSIDE SIGHTS
Hotel Men Visit Orange Groves
and Pick Fruit From
the Trees.
Enthusiastic in Tbeir Praise of the
Peculiar Beauty of Magnolia
Avenue.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., April 18.â The secÂ«
ond and third sections of the hotel men's
special left Redlands for Riverside at 5
o'clock this morning. Arriving in that
city, the strangers were met at the depot
and the Glenwood tavern by the following
committee of Riverside citizen*: Messrs.
George F. Seger, William McÃean, A. J.
Conden, John Jarvis, B. B. Bash, George
D. Cunningham, George V. Reynolds, E.
R. Miller and Dan Funday.
This body was supplied with a suffic
ient number of carriages ana tallybos to
give everybody on the excursion a drive,
and as the morning was a lovely one the
opportunity was gladly accepted.
Macnolia avenue, famous thÂ« world
over, was the first objective point in the
drive, and the guests of the occasion were
enthusiastic in praise of its peculiar
beauty.
The orange-packing houses at Casa
Blanca were visited and the Easterners
had an opportunity to witness the grading,
wrapping and boxing of the citrus fruits
for market. Victoria Hill, with its ex
pansive view of orange orchard, mountain
ana valley was also visited by many.
Some of the orange groves were thrown
open to the visiting bonifaces, and to
night there are quite a number of pack
ages of oranges and lemons which they
are going to tafce back East with them,
and they can assure their friends that they
picked them with their own hands.
It was near noon when all had returned
from the drive, and at 12:30 o'clock the
great excursion left pleasant, Riverside
with its members in love with that citrus
colony. "All aboard for Coronado!" was
the cry of tne conductor, and soon the
great engines were drawing the heavy
trains toward that objective point as the
terminus of the week's outing.
Speeding by the old mission at San Juan
Capistrano, along by the surging surf of the
Pacific, the iron horses hurried the trains
over plain and mountain; passing "Old
Town" many eyes were turned toward the
house where Kamona was married, and
then the city and bay of San Diego
claimed attention.
The trains were run out upon the Santa
Fe wharf, passengers and baggage were
quickly transferred to the ferry and thence
to the electric-cars, and at 6:10 o'clock this
evening the last one of the 400 excursion
ists had entered the hospitable doors of
the Hotel del Coronado.
SOUTH BITHRSIDE'B LOSS.
Death of ' George JU. Joy, One of the i

TROOPS XEIStUSIi AT ILWACO.
Oregon Fithertnen Still ZPlapoted to
Create a lilaturbanee.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 18.â Brigadier-
General E. M. Carr returned to-day from
Ilwaco, on the Columbia River, the scene
of the Fishermen's war. He reported to
Governor McGraw that the presence of
troops is still needed, and the executive
has directed that they remain there until
peace and order is thoroughly restored.
The presence of the militia, General Carr
says, alone prevents the destruction, at
the bands of Oregon fishermen, of tbe
traps in Bakers Bay.

steamship Coptic, brought the news to his
California friends.
MR. HEARST RETURNS.
The Editor Casts a Few Side
lights on National Poli
tics.
'TIS M'KINLEY AND WHITNEY.
They Will Probably Be the Respec
tive Standard-Bearers of Their
Two Great Parties.
W. R. Hearst, editor of the New York
Journal and the San Francisco Examiner,
is home from New York. He will remain
here for some time before returning to the
scene of his latest effort.
Mr. Hearst purchased the New York
Journal six months ago. He is* the one
man in the United States who controls the
destinies of two metropolitan dailies. And
his success in New York is no less splen
did than his triumph in San Francisco.
He went into the Eastern metropolis
with that vim and determination peculiar
to the man of the West, broke through the
crust of old and decayed journalistic cus
toms, and won out on new methods
against tremendous disadvantage.
Mr. Hearst, with that modesty that be
longs to him, was averse to discussing the
success of the Journal under his manage
ment.
That he had undergone a hard siege,
howevflr, was told in his somewhat re
duced appearance and the fact that he has
returned home for a much-needed rest.
Mr. Hearst cast a few side lights on the
political situation.
"McKinley seems to be the strongest
candidate," said the editor. "I remember
at about ttie time the candidates for the
Republican nomination announced them
selves the New YorK Journal made a poll
of the different States and the Ohio man
showed the greatest strength. After the
State conventions had been held another
poll of the vote was taken. This showed
that McKinley would be nominated on the
first ballot. However, there is no telling
who will be nominated.
"It is much the same with the Demo
crats," continued Mr. Hearst, "although
the sentiment of the party at this time
seems to De for Mr. Whitney, whose record
as Secretary of ihe Navy apparently car
ries great weight with the people of the
United States at this time."
Asked as to Mr. Whitney's position on
the currency question Mr. Hearst said that
he did not look upon him as a sound
money man, so called.
"I rather think," he observed, "that he
has silver tendencies, as I recall a public
statement in which he declared an impar
tial regard for both metals."
Speaking of rumored changes on the
Examiner staff, the proprietor of the
"Monarch" said:
"I see that an evening paper infers that
I returned home *Â»ith the intention of re
moving Mr. Hamilton from the managing
editorship of the Examiner. That im
pression is entirely erroneous. In fact it
is quite the other way. I have had much
difficulty in inducing Mr. Hamilton to re
tain his position,
"He has repeatedly resigned the desk,
but I prevailed upon him to continue in
harness until I should return home. Of
course he is a literary man â and as such
likes to knock about town, go to the clubs,
and have some little time to himself. To
him deskwork is distasteful. But I>m in
hopes of having him continue in his posi
tion as the chief of staff. He is exception
ally satisfactory to me and any statement
to the contrary is absolutely without
foundation.
"About the Journal? Oh, it is growing,"
I said Mr. Hearst, with a smile. "It had a

that the increase in the circulation for this
week was 4740 in the city, and 1888 in the

Mr. Hearst said a good word for the
Californians now on the staff of the Jour
nal. He prophesied that Homer Daven
port, whose New YorK success, though
sudden, seems to have been permanent,
would eventually stand at the head of the
caricaturists of the time. S.S. Chamber-
Jain is managing editor and C. M. Palmer
business manager of the journal.
They held these respective places on
the Examiner and their friends will note
their New York success with much delight.
A. M. Lawrence returned with Mr.
Hearst from New York.
There will probably be a big "shake up"
in Mr. Hearst's San Francisco shop just
about the time he goes East again, as it is
said that his coming to San Francisco
at this time means something more to
the staff of editors and writers than the
"glad hand."
MILL VALLEY'S RAILWAY.
Work on the Scenic Line Is
Progressing With Surpris
ing Rapidity.
The Road Will Be Completed in Time
for Many Summer Excur
sions.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., April 18.â With
a rapidity that is surprising the projectors
of the Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpaia
Scenic Railway are pushing the work of
construction to completion. A large force
of men is at work, and it is the intention
to have the road iv operation in time for
the summer travel. It was the original
intention to nave the work done by j une
1, but that is now out of the question, and
the cars will not be running before August
at the earliest.
The rains have interfered considerably
with the construction. There nas also
been trouble with the laborers, but men to
fill the places of those leaving have been
readily obtained, and these interruptions
have not bothered materially.
The track is laid through the Corte Ma
dera Canyon for a distance of two milea.
This part of the route has been the most
difficult to construct, as a number of
bridges were built. The last one, it is ex
pected will be completed this week.
For a distance of four miles the route of
the road on the mountain has been graded
and put in condition to receive tbe ties
and rails as soon as the construction train
ia able to get this distance.
The construction train consists of a sin
gle broad-gauge car, ' on which has been
bui't a derrick, and with this car and the
Snay engine in use the work goes rapidly
on.
There are four trestles on the first two
miles of the road. The work of wiring the
rails for the electrical power is being done
and the men will be put to work building
the power-house in a short time.
SACRAMENTO VERDICT.
By a Vote of 9 to 3, Murderer Simon
Raten Is Declared to Be
Insane.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., April 18.â Simon
Raten, who is believed to have murdered
two Japanese, with whom he was travel
ing, near this city, some weeks aÂ«o, has
been declared insane and will be sent to
Stockton asylum. His trial for the mur
der will be continued until such time as
the experts declare him perfectly rational.
There exists strong doubts in the minds of
all interested in the case as to whether the
trial will ever be resumed.
The entire week has been consumed in
hearing testimony relative to the prison
er's sanity, the result being that the jury
declared him insane by a vote of 9 to 3.
MORMONS WIN APPLAUSE
Last Secular Concert of the
Tabernacle Choir Is a
Success.
THE AUDIENCE WAS DELIGHTED
To-Night the Season Will Come to an
End With a Grand Sacred
Concert.
The largest audience that the Mormon
Tabernacle choir has yet had in- this City
was present in Metropolitan Temple last
night. The programme was composed of
more popular music than had been the
case on the opening night, and both the
choruÃ and the soloists received a good
deal of applause, including several deter
mined demands for encores.
There was a repetition of the finish of
act two in "LaTraviata," which was given
on Wednesday night, and which for crisp
ness, spirit and attack in about the best
piece of work done by the chorus. The
"Hallelujah" chorus was also repeated,
and as before was sung with a good volume
of sound, but with too much tendency to
insert portamentos where Handel never
intended them.
The polonaise and chorus from Glinka'a
"Life for the Czar," was rendered with
organ accompaniment by J. J. Daynes,
and though that instrument detructed a
little from the operatic character of the
work the chorus went with a good swin^
notwithstanding. The sextet and chorus
from "Lucia" showed the want of an
orchestra more than did the other operatic
selections. The concert opened with the
"Soldiers' Chorus" from Gounod's
"Faust."
The vocal soloists all did good work.
Master Pike, the boy alto, was not on the
programme, but he sang "Angels, Kver
Bright and Fair," as fin encore to the
"Lucia" sixtet. The familiar aria was
taken about a third lower than the originM
key and every note was sung in that
quality of production generally described
as the third register, which wafl a very un
common and somewhat unnatural feat,
but Master Pike has .in uncommon voice,
and his singing, which sounds more like
counter tenor than alto, is done without
much apparent effort.
"Anjjels Ever Bright and Fair," was
j rendered with a good deal of taste and
expression.
Miss Lizzie Thomas Edward sang an
! aria from "Ernani," with charming swoet
| ness and care of execution, and Mi^s Bes
j sic Dean Allison showed herself to be pos
i sessed of a well-produced contralto voice,
though she indulged a little too much in
the tremolo. Willard E. "Weihe, who
played a Vieuxtemps violin solo, "Fanta
sia Appassionata," would be a more satis
factory performer if he selected works of a
simpler character. George D. Pyper, the
solo tenor of the evening, won a good deal
of applause.
To-night the season of the Mormon
Tabernacle cdoir will close with a grand
sacred concert. Popular prices will pre
vail.
The following programme will be ren
dered :
Anthem, "Let All Israel Sing" (Joseph J.
Daynes), written for the dedication cf tht-grÂ»ac

SLAVES SEARED
WITH HOT IRONS
While the Stars and Stripes
Floated Gayly Over-
Head.
THE CITY'S OLD SHAME.
Cooly Women Imported Regu
larly by Perjury for
Immorality.
THEIR PRICE HAS ADVANCED.
Because It Costs More to Guild the
Corrupt Path Through Which
They Enter the Country.
The interview with Miss Culbertson and
Miss D. M. Cameron, of the Presbyterian
Chinese Mission, published in last Tues
day's Call concerning the importation of
and traffic in Chinese woman slaves for an
immoral purpose has been made the sub
jert of much comment among people of
the opinion that California should not be
made the dumping-ground for Asiatic
serfs and criminals.
The fact that even under the rigid exclu
sion laws now in vogue this traffic is being
continued, and that the gates of the Cus
tom house have l>een thrown wide open
to the admission of disreputable Chinese
â women, has occasioned surprise among
that portion of the public not conversant
with the chameleon qualities of the law
' and the cnameleon-iike manner in which
the law is colored to suit the requirements
of the occasion.
Rev. Dr. F. J. Masters, superintendent
of ttie Methodist Chinese Mission at 91G
Washington street, knows as much about !
the influence of gold in bringing about
those changeable hues as any other man
in this State. He has been connected
with the mission for many years and is a
Chinese scholar of more than ordinary
attainments. The opinion of such 3 man,
one who has intently studied this problem |
for years and years, is certainly entitled 1
to much weight. Hence, a remark which !
he made to a Call reporter yesterday to
the effect that it is easier for a lewd woman
to pass through the Custom-house than it
is for a merchant's wife must be regarded
as of grave significance.
Why should it be easier for the immoral
cooly slave, whose calling may be read in
her face, in her manner of dressing her
hair and in her conversation, and which
may be suspected in her unbound feet, to
and upon the shores of California than it
should be for the small-footed and lady
like wife of the honest merchant who
stands inside the Golden Gate to receive
her?
Mr. Masters' explanation was simple.
A strict compliance with the letter of the
law discriminated in favor of the unworthy
and against the worthy. When Timothy-
Guy Phelps was Collector of the Port he
followed out the letter of the law strictly.
The cooly woman backed with a money
value and by a powerful ring of slave
owners and immigration brokers had all
the forms of the law strictly complied
with. The necessary papers were all in
order and straight upon their faces. The
forgeries were cleverly executed, the per-'
jured witnesses, white and Chinese, were I
handy, the story which the woman was to
tell to the effect that she was born in Sai:
Francisco and that So-and-So, who lived
here-and-there, was her husband, had
been carefully committed to memory,
and in the whole of the proceed
ings not one flaw was to be found. So
that the officials had no alternative but
to let her enter with a grin upon her face.
No pains of this kina were taken with
the respectable woman coming here be
cause she had a risbt to return to this
country. She had not coolie brokers at
her back, no interpreters on frendly terms
with the brokers' ring, no money value
whatever. Upon the appearance of the
least flaw In her papers or the least irreg
ularity in the proceedings under which
she essayed to land she was turned back
to China to make the attempt again when
ever her husband could send the passage
money and have papers prepared that
would stand the test of official scenting.
Mr. Phelps could not be blamed for
this.' He was carrying out the Jaw as he
understood it and he treated all comers
alike.
"But," added Mr. Masters, "if I were the
Collector and a woman came to me with
bound feet and told me that she was the
wife of a merchant I would admit her
without any further evidence."
Mr. Masters explained his strange dec
laration as follows: In China a bound
foot woman is a lady. "Bound feet," or
"little feet," as they are known to Cauca
sians, are not a mark of caste, as is gener
ally believed. They are rather a mark of
virtue and respectability. There is one of
these "bound-foot" women in almost every
Chinese family, high or low, rich or poor.
The mother says, "I will make this child
a 'bound-foot' and she shall be a lady."
The child's feet are contracted, she is kept
at home with her mother day and night
and because of her fashionable deformity
she cannot do any menial work, but must
be waited upon as a real lady. When she
arrives of age she is married to some man
who can afford to have a lady for a wife
and to hire servants to wait upon her.
On the other hand, it must not be taken
for granted that because a woman has
large or unbound fest she belongs, neces
sarily, to the immoral class. All that
may be said of her is that she may be one
of that class, while no "little foot" woman
belongs to that class at all.
Mr. Masters' experience had been, he
â¢ said, that the general run of United States
District Attorneys at this port wore very
vigilant for a year .or two and then lapsed
again into original sin, as he quaintly
put it.
"It is like beating the air to try and do
anything with them," he continued. "I
have had much to contend with also from
official sympathy in behalf of ihe cause of
the slave brokers. I have had lawyers and
court officers argue with me that this kind
of immigration was a necessary evil, and
that without them there would be great
danger to our homes from those wild
beasts from the Orient."
The courts did not exercise a wise dis
crimination on the side of morality. It
had often occuned, in the course of his
his ten years' experience, after having res
cued one of these miserable slaves,
that "some shyster lawyer" would
apply for a writ of habeas corpus for
the restitution to her owners of some
girl manifestly and unmistakably un
der age. He had known this to be the
case in the matter of a girl who could not
have been more than 13 or 14 years old.
The girl is produced before Judge Levi.
"How old are you?" he asks the girl.
The interpreter makes the inquiry, and,
with a grin of unbelief, translates it.
"I am 21 years old."
"Where do you want to go?" asks Judge
Levi.
"Back to the brothel."
"Well, go,'' says the Judge, and she goes.
After this graphic description Mr. Mas
ters resumed: "Acccording to the proce
dure of some of the courts the statements
of the girl are taken as the truth with re
gard to her age, and in the absence of any
other testimony to the contrary, and the
Judge accepts the statement and sends her
back to hell. We have to talk plainly
about those things, and there is great
harm done by benevolent societies paint
ing things couleur de rose."
Mr. Masters expressed the opinion that
another great difficulty met with in en
forcing the law was the lack of Chinese
interpreters of strict integrity. Many of
them in the past were too friendly with
the slave-importing ring, and it was the
general impression in Chinatown that the
interpreters used to engineer the women
through the Custom-house.
There was no doubt in his mind that
1 money is used in landing the women. He
knew that it was openly boasted in China
town by the Chinese brokers* that women
can be landed here from Hongkong at the
rate of $1200 apiece. The fact that a
Chinese girl 10 years old can be bought in
China for ?200, and that the same eirl at
12 or 14 can be sold at from $2000 to $3000
in Chinatown was cited as an evidence
The Design by W. O. Banks That Will Probably Be Accepted for the New Municipal
Building.
that much money was required to land
them here.
Several girls, 12 years old, rescued from
vile dens, have been brought to the mis
sion, and seven years ago a girl between
11 and 12 years of age was rescued who
told of a whip hanging on the wall as a
reminder that if she failed to obey the im
moral behests of her mistress and earn
money for her she would be whipped un
mercifully.
Before the establishments of the Metho
dist and Presbyterian missions in this
City great cruelties were perpetrated upon
the unfortunate slaves. They were taken
into a room, divested ot every particle of
clothing, placed on the auction block and
sold to the highest bidder. For the most
trivial causes they were beaten black and
blue with whips and bamboo rods, and
even seared with redhot irons.
To these unfortunates the missions were
a haven of refuge, but with the advent of
the missions and the exposures that were
made by reason thereof the slave-masters
changed their tactics, and the rod, the
lash and the searing-iron were laid aside.
Kindness took the place of cruelty, not be
cause any feeling of humanity or of pity
had entered the brutal Mongolian heart,
but because they would lose all their
slaves if the system of cruelty was not re
placed by one which would keep the ig
norant chattels contented with their lot.
A pseudo husband appeared and some
kind of a mock ceremony was performed.
Then she became interested in the
glamour of a life which transcended every
thing that she had ever experienced in
China in her life as a cooly. She was
loaded- with cheap jewelry and fine clothes
and was well fed and allowed to go to the
theater. Hence they became contented
with their lot, for they had no conscience.
They had not been reared to look upon
that kind of a life as evil.
"Nearly all the Chinese girls who come
here are the products of the brothel," con
tinued the missionary. "They|have always
lived in that debasing environment; it is
j an improvement, physically and sensu
ally, upon their former lot and they do not
care to come to the missions. They will
swear to whatever their masters desire.
Some of them have been brought to the
mission, have pretended to reform, have
been married to good husbands and have
deliberately and from choice cone back to
the life* oi shame. Others nave reformed
for good and are in Christian families, a
credit to the missions and to the kind
Christians who have taken charge of
them."
Mr. Masters could see no remedy under
the existing order of things. The great
majority of women arriving from China
were of the prohibited class. There should
surely be some means of punishing the
perjurers and their aiders and abettors,
but much detective work would be re
quired. If the police could or would en
force the vagrancy act against the women
now here the evil would be very much
mitigated and the demand for new im
portations would be lessened. But Mr.
Masters did not know whether this was
practicable.^
GASTRONOMY AND GENIUS.
Rossini never ate any breakfast, and
frivolous critics say this is why he never
wrote any serious music. At a banquet
given by Napoleon 111 Rossini ate tw ice
of the Italian spaghetti and demolished
hi 9 portions with gusto.
Napoleon 111 had a "porcine" side to his
nature. He was rather a glutton and the
pictorial promiscuity of his salon quite
horrified the Americans who enjoyed his
hospitality.
Charles Reade could not be induced to
taste mackerel. He shirked beef, never
tasted soup, beer and fatty dishes. He was
fono of mutton and baked apples. He
hated to get into evening dress for dinner.
Patti detests great joints and affects
dainty French dishes, while her wine cel
lars are the wonder and envy of connois
seurs. Her husband, Nicolini, is some
thing of a cook and can concoct fine dishes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
BANKS GAINS A FRIEND.
Mooser & Mooser to Get the
Contract for the Dipso
maniacs' Home.
THE RESULT OF A COMPROMISE
Now Supervisor Wagner Will Change
His Vote on the Municipal
Building.
As a result of the action of the Health
and Police Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors Friday the vote for the de
signs for the new municipal building will
probably stand Shea & Shea 6, W. O.
j Banks 6, when the matter is again brought
up for Jhe consideration of the board.
Supervisor Wagner is evidently a friend
of Mooser & Mooser, who have made bids
for both the municipal building and the
Home for Dipsomaniacs. When the mat
ter came tip before the board ha made a
persistent fight for the firm, and when the
matter was postponed announced that he
was in the fight to stay. Later, when the
municipal building fight was in full swing,
he cast his vote for his friends, causing
the vote to stand Shea & Shea 6, Banks 5
and Mooser & Mooser 1.
The matter was put to a vote half a
dozen times, but the friends of the three
firms stood firm and the result was a
deadlock. On Friday the question of
awarding the contract for furnishing plans
for the Home for Dipsomaniacs came up
and the committee decided to recommend
that it should be awarded to Mooser &
Mooser.
It is understood that this result was
just what would satisfy Supervisor Wag
ner and that he will now join forces with
the Banks men who helped Out his
friends and vote for Banks. One of the
Shea forces is expected to fall into line
and the coast will be clear for Banks to
pet the desirable contract for erecting the
Kearney- street building.
The committee will recommend that
Mooser & Mooser be given fifteen days to
submit plans for the erection of a building
to cost not more than $25,000.

Before a Thunder-storm.
The important bearing upon bodily
health of the electrical conditions of the
atmosphere has received much attention
lately. As evidence of this, there is cited
by physicians that tendency to headache,
irritability and general malaise expe
rienced by many persons just previous to
a thunder-storm. In this connection it has
been said that among the conditions pre
disposing to sunstroke in India, tnere has
been noticed the peculiar conditions of the
air, in which the hairs of a horse's tail re-
Eel each otber, in which the nairs of the
cad stand on end, and in which a man
exposed to its influence becomes irritable,
headachy and restless without knowing
exactly what is the matter with him.
Various observers have remarked, also,
that a thunder-storm i 3 often preceded by
an increased frequency of cases of heat
apoplexy. The precise cause of this phe
nomenon has, however, not been deter
mined. â New York Tribune.

CONTEST FOR GRAND ORATOR.
The Different Parlors That Are
Entitled to Representation and
the Delegates Chosen. .
The Native Sons of the Golden West

be in session for nearly a week. A num
ber of the delegates will leave during the
early part of the week to enable them to
Witness the fiesta in the lower country.
:." There appears to be but one office on
which, the delegates will make a strong
contest, and that is the office. of grand
orator, now held by W. M. Conley of Ma
dera Parlor. There are a number of can
didates for the office, among the I number
Frank . Mattison of Santa Cruz, Louis P.
Byington of this City, E. A. Meserve of
Los Angeles and Frank L. Coombs of
Napa. Henry C. Gesford of Napa Parlor
is in the line of promotion to succeed
Frank H. Dunne as grand president.
A number of the parlors have neglected
to send in the list of cheir delegates, and
many of the delegates do not present their
credentials until the morning of the first
session. The following is a list of the par
lors entitled to representation and the
delegates whose , names have been re
ceived. . Quite a number of delegates were

Extreme Measure* to Overthrow Maxi
milian Advocated.
An unpublished letter from General
Grant upon the Monroe doctrine has been
found among the records of the War De
partment, says the Washington corre
spondent of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
It was written to President Andrew John
son some time before this Government de
manded the withdrawal of French troops
from Mexico. General Grant, as the letter
shows, was in favor of extreme measures
to overthrow Maximilian and to sustain
the republican cause in Mexico. The let
ter, which is of particular interest at this
time, reads as follows :
TT- r ;; ILL., Sept. 21, 1865.
His Excellency, A. Johnson, President: Seven
weeks absence from Washington and free in
tercourse with all parties and classes of people
have convinced me that there is but ona
opinion as to tbe duty of the United States to
ward Mexico, or rather the usurpers in that
country. All agree that, besides a yielding of
the loag-proclaimed Monroe doctrine, non
intervention in Mexican affairs will lead to an
extensive and bloody war hereafter, or a yield
ing of territory now possessed by us
To let the empire of Maximilian' be estab
lished on onr frontier is to permit an enemy to
establish himself who. will require a l&re<
standing army to watch. Military stations
will be at points remote from supplies
and therefore expensive to keep Tho
trade of an empire will be lost to our
commerce, and Americans instead of beinu
the most tavored people of the world through
out the length and breadth of this continent
will be scoffed and laughed at by theii adjoin
ing neighbors, both north arid southâ th*
people of the British provinces and Mexico
Previous communications have given mv
views on our duty in the matter here spoken
of, so that it is not necessary that I should
treat the subject at any length now. Conver
sations with you have convinced me that you
think about it as 1 do, otherwise I shoul 1
never have taken the liberty of writing Mi
this manner. I have had the opportunity of
mingling more intimately with all classes of
community than tho Executive can possibly
have, and my object is to give you the benefit
ef what I have heard expressed.
1 would have no hesitation in recommend
ing that notice be given the French that for
eign troops must be withdrawn from the con
tinent and the people left free to govern them
selves in their own way. I would openly soli
on credit to the Government of Mexico ail thÂ«
ammunition and clothing they want and aid
them with officers to command troops in
â¢fine, I would take such measures as would se
cure the supremacy of the republican Govern
ment in Mexico.
I hope you will excuse me for the free man
ncr in which I address you. I but spsak mv
honest convictions, and then with the full be
lief that a terrible strife in this country is to
be averted by prompt action in this matter
with Mexico.
U. S. Grant, Lieutenant-General.

There are charges still pending against
him, but he has been allowed to go on his
R. H. McDonald Jr., Who 19 Now Free After Standing Four Felony Trials.
own recognizance and it will not be long
before the charges will be dropped.
McDonald had been in j"il for nearly
two years, and during that time he was |
tried four times. Once the jury disagreed ;
and three times he was acquitted.
His first trial was for perjury for having
sworn to a false statement of the Pacific
Bank's finances. It was contended that he
did not actually swear to the statement,
and this was proved by the testimony. He
also alleged insanity as a defense. He was ;
next tried for embezzling $20,000 from the j
Pacific Bank, but he was promptly acquit
ted. Then hewa3 tried for falsifying the
records of the bank and again he was
acquitted. The charge of falsifying
the records and tnat of perjury
were closely related, for the much
talked-of Waterhouse checks were the
cause of both. The checks were for sev- 1
era! hundred thousand dollars and it was |
claimed they were put on the books to J
swell the assets of the bank. They were !
in the annual statement, and hence the j
charge of perjury Jor swearing to it and
the charge of falsifying the record for carry
ing them on. When, therefore, McDonald
was acquitted on the charge of falsifying
the record it practically destroyed the per
jury charge. The Jast charge was one of
em bezzlement, for returning a note for $40,
--000 made by Henry Westphal and indorsed
by C. O. Swanberg to the indorser. It was I
shown that the note had been deposited in
security for a letter of credit on the Pacific
Bank, but the Pacific Bank failed before
the Jetter of credit was drawn upon and so
the note was returned. An acquittal,
therefore, ended the trial of the charge
which was based on that transaction.
After the tnird acquittal, which was
only a few days ago, McDonalds bail was
reduced to $2000 and the remaining cases
against him were put over until yester
day. Cook had wanted the District At
torney to dismiss them right away, but he
demurred, and he demurred again when
they came up yesterday, so the cases were
put over for another week and McDonald's
bail was all set aside. Judge Bahrs has
intimated that the District Attorney must
take some definite action then.
The perjury charge will never amount to
much, and the other charges against him
are made by defective indictments. Sub
stitutes for these indictments were filed
and McDonald was tried upon them, while
the defective ones were never dismissed.
They can never harm him, however, for if
he is ever brought to trial on them he can
plead his former acquittals and so get free
at once.
There was no commotion in court when
the prisoner was told he could go. He
expected it, and so did his friends. He
said nothing, but with his wife and little
daughter walked quietly out of the City
Hall. ' \
HIS FIRST FREE DAY.
McDonald Spends It In Resting and
In Receiving the Congratvila
tlons of His Friends.
"Only a man who has been deprived of
his liberty can imagine the joy there is iv
getting it, back again."
So said Richard H. McDonald last night.
The man who has spent so many weary
days behind the cold merciless portals of
the County Jail was seated in the cozy
front parlor of his comfortable elegant
home on Page street. Close behind him
sat his young wife. Day after day during
the lone term of his imprisonment bad
she gone to the grim stone jail, morning,
noon and night, bearing dainty viands to
the lonely prisoner. During all the time
he waa incarcerated never once did orison
fare pass Richard McDonald's lips. Never
a sun rose or set but it brought him a gay
"good morning" or a parting kiss from
the wife of bis bosom.
"And now," he went on, "I am here
alone with her and our little one. No
cruel bars can part us; no turnkey can
order her from her husband's presence;
no power can prevent me from rising at
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. APRIL 19, 1896.
night and grazing upon the sleeping beauty I
of our child.
"Don't ask me what I intend to do. I
want to enjoy my liberty. I want to
stretch the limbs so long restrained; to
breathe the glad, free air. I want to
bathe my cramped and mildewed body in
a flood of God's free sunlight, while 1
watch the birds fly through the air, and
cry to them, 'At last I am as free as you.' "
Whether by reason of his wife's* unre
mitting attentions or his own vigorous
constitution, Mr. McDonald looks younger
than he did when first he was introduced
to the somber interior of a prison cell.
The former hollows in his finely chiseled
face are rounded out with healthy, firm
flesh, while his cheeks bear a tinge of
ruddiness which did not lighten them dur
| ing the long, tedious days passed in the
courtroom. His hair and beard are
slightly streaked with gray, but so slightly
that a stranger seeing him for the first
time would call him a young man.
"Friends have advised me to leave town
for a few days," he continued; "but why
should I go? My name alone indicates
the brave, sturdy Scotch blood which is
j my heritage. I will not even appear to
I fly from observation, though I have the
j right to go wherever I may please. If
j any one wishes to watch me here I am,
and here I will remain. Here in this City
I have been defamed and traduced; here I
| have felt the iron clutch of the law; here
I have endured the humiliation of im
prisonment, and here 1 will appear again
before the public in the role which is
mine by right â that of an honest business
man.
"I hardly feel like talking business for
j the present, but, of course, 1 must soon
think of some means whereby I may pay
, my way and give my dear faithful wife
j some little recompense for her loving and
constant ministrations to me in my hour
of direst need. Before Ido anything in a
business way I will write to my father.
When I last beard from him. which was a
few weeks ago, he was in England. Since
he wrote I believe he i 3 somewhere on the
Continent, I know the springs at Carls
bad agree with him, and he may be there.
At all events I can soon find out where he
is, and when he lenrns that I am out he
will surely give me some assistance. To
be sure he is hard pushed for money, but I
know he will do his best to set me on my
feet.
"All day I have been kept busy receiving
the congratulations of dear friends. Many
of them were frequent visitors at my
gloomy quarters in the Broadway
hostelry, while others knew me when I
was a power in the world of finance. Some
also have come whom I aided in my brief
day of prosperity.
"Never can I express the exquisite de
light with -which I welcome these manifes
tations of a regard which can subsist
through evil and good report. Never can
I form into words the torrents of gratitude
wdich well forth from my inmost heart in
view of the noble, faithful friendship with
which I have been so singularly blessed.
"And now I stand at the threshold of a
new life. I open wide my arms to give a
welcome to my future. It cannot bs aarker
than my past, and if its first day be an
augury my coming forth from bondage
will be like the passing of a soul from pur
gatory into paradise."
JOHN MOS3 HONORED.
Presented With a Carrara Bust by His
Late Associates.
John Moss, recently appointed traffic
manager of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railway, wag very agree
ably surprised on reaching his residence
last evening to find awaiting his arrival a
roost gratifying testimonial of the esteem
in which he is held by his late associates,
the employes of the local freight agency of
the Southern Pacific Company in this City.
The testimonial consists of a veiy hand
some Carrara marble bust, chiseled by C.
Lopini, standing on a tine Corinthian
column of dark green marble.
An Incubator Caused a Fire.
A fire broke out in the upper story of a frame
dwelling-house on San Jose avenue, near Bond
street, shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday even
ing, but although the firemen were on tbe
scene in a very few moments, having discov
ered the flames just as the engine team whr
returning from exercise, some $300 or $400
worth of property was destroyed before the
flames were subdued.
The house is owned by Mr. Jenkins, and was
occupied by J. Hanson. Ihere was a small
insurance on the house, but none on its con
tents.
The fire wns caused by a defective oil lamp
In useas a part of the heating apparatus of a
large incubator, in which were several hun
dred eggs. The incubator and its unhatched
brood were destroyed, together with the
greater part of the upper story of the building.

Major W. B. Hooper, com.mor.der of the Loyal
Legion of California, has returned from Los
Angeles and San Diego, where he attended the
annuul banquets of the local organizations of
the Loyal Legion. There are about 100 of the
members, who being elderly, find it difficult to
attend the general annual meeting in San
Francisco, and so the commander, as a courtesy
to them, met them there. Miijor Hooper, dur
ing his absence, caught a heavy cold, but is re

A Japanese, who could not speak English,
was taken to the Receiving Hospital yesterday
morning suffering from gas asphyxiation. He

FLYNN DECLARES
HIS INNOCENCE.
The Accused Man Says He
Is a Victim of Cir
cumstances.
NO FURTHER EVIDENCE-
The Police Rest Their Case on
the Testimony of the
Child's Mother.
FITZGEBALD MAKES DENIAL.
Preliminary Hearing TcMorrow Prc
vided Mrs. Ercwning Is Able
10 Be Present.
J. T. Flynn, the alleged destroyer of a
child born to a Mrs. Browning last Mon
day morning, and of which he is said to
be the father, continues to protest his
absolute ieuorance and innocence of the
crime.
The accused man now goes a little fur
ther than this by declaring that if a crime
was committed in the Browning house- |
hold that lady's sister is either entirely
responsible or has some guilty knowledge
of it.
Flynn further says that he defies any
one to prove that he was in the remotest
way instrumental in causing The death of
the child found in the vacant lot on Market j
street, near Tweifth. He admits that the
circumstances are against him, but con
tends that in time everything will be made i ;
clear. :
The police ha7e so far failed to discover I
any additional evidence against Flynn.
They endeavored yesterday, but without ,
success, to find the owner of the satchel, i
which the unnatural murderer, whoever (
it may be, sought to convert into a coffin
for the new-born child of siu.
There was nothing to show that it be- !
longed to Flynn. and there was equally
little to connect the ownership with either
Mrs. Browning or her sister, Mrs. Shane,
ana Captain Lees relies solely upon the
statement o! Mrs. Browning that Flynn
was th<: father of the child, and that he |
took it from the house for the avowed pur- j
pose of committing it to the care of some j
foundling asylum.
"As I have before stated," said Flynn ;
yesterday, "I am the victim of a rno?t pe
culiar combination of circumstances. It
is difficult, of course, for people to under
stand that I only entertained a platomc
friendship for the woman because I as
sisted her financially at various times.
"I first met Mrs. Browning about twelve
months ago. We kept company for quite
a while, and then oneday she told me that
she was not physically able to be more
than a friend. 1 wanted to marry ncr, not
that I entertained any particularly strong
passion, but than I was a widower with
two children, an>' needed some one to care
for them. Then it was that she told me of
her condition.
"Knowing tbat she was the mother of
two children, one a girl of 16 and the other j
a boy some years younger, and believing \
that she needed help, 1 assisted her when- \
ever I could. At various times I have
given her moneyâ slo, $15 or $20, accord
ing to the size of my own purse. I did
this solely because I felt sorry for her,
though it is evident now that my kindness '
was misplaced.
"On the night the child was born I j
called on Mrs. Browning and found her ill.
She said that she had been sick since Fri- â 
day and I immediately went in search of j
a physician. I found Dr. Quigley and !
giving him my card requested that he go I
immediately to. see Mrs. Browning. The ;
story of how he visited the house and deliv
ered the mother of the child has already!
been told and, of course, need not be gone i
over now. I can only repeat what I said !
last niifht, that I know absolutely nothing I
of any child being born to her, except {
what has been told me. If the child aban- :
doned was hers then the responsibility â¢
rests with her.
"To me it is very plain. The child was
left in the vacant lot and then traced to
her by the laundry mark on the towel, or j
else the attending physician reported the !
matter to the police. In any event she |
and her sister saw that they were in for it j
and at once concluded to shift the whole
responsibility on me. How successfully
they have done this is readily seen.
"Some comment has been indulged in,
so I understand, over the fact that 1 re
cently changed lodging-houses. It is true
that I did change my lodging-place, and I
was forced to, on account of not being able
to pay the rent. This is an embarrassing
thing to say, I know, but it is none the
less true. Now about the satchel or valise
in which the baby was found. On the
night I visited Mrs. Browning I had just
$1, and I got it on pawning my two
satchels.
"I owed my former landlady, on Third
street, $2, and she kept my mail as a sort of
guarantee. I expected some important
letters and thÂ» only way that I could pet i
them was by paying tha balance of the J
rent. I pawned my valise for $3, paid ray
landlady $2 and started for Mrs. Brown
ing's with the balance in my pocket. Ab
I only owned two valises it is impossible
for the one containing the baby to belong j
to me. Of course, I can't see how lamto i
get out of this at the present time, but I i
am sure that in the end all will be made j
clear."
A Call man visited a gentleman yester- !
day who has known Flynn for several |
years and been clearly identified with him
in several enterprises. His name, by his
request, is suppressed until the prelimi
nary hearinz, Monday or Tuesday next, j
Ke said :
"I have known John T. Flynn inti- !
mately. I regarded him and he me as a
brother. Yet were he guilt} of the offense
charged I would not shield him. I would
not shield my own son were he guilty of a
similar crime.
"I know him to be charitable, even
when he needed the small sura which his !
limited means would permit him to con- j
tribute to a worthy cause. I know him to
be of a kind and cheerful nature, making
life a pleasure rather than a hardship. I
have known him to protect a boy of ten
der years who was being abused by a burly
ruffian. He did not only protect the child,
but volunteered to prosecute the man and
convicted him.
"I remember an instance when he called
on me and asked rue to give him 50 cents
to procure a meal for a hungry mother and
her children.
"I know of hundreds of instances when
he has exhibited sufficient human
sympathy to convince me that he could
not commit the crime with which he ia
charged.
"He is a brave man in the cause of jus
tice, able with his pen and in debate;
could not be induced to commit an in
discretion, much less a crime.
"He is an author, an able editorial
writer, the father of two bright children,
of excellent family connection, and num
bers among his personal acquaintances
many of the leading citizens of Oregon,
Washington and California.
"In view of what I know to be true I am
justified in askirrg a suspension of public
judgment. There is a mistake somewhere
and the cause of justice will not be injured
by a short delay. John T. Flynn is not an
idiot and those, who temporarily condemn
him will have to reverse their opinion
later on. â¢ j
"lean cite instances, when the proper
time arrives, when he condemned crimes
of a heinous natureâ notably the Holmes,
Hayward and Durrant caseq. His pen has
j been used particularly against that class
I of criminals and at all times has he been a
stanch supporter of law and human
rights.
George Knight will look after Flynn's
interests in a legal way. The attorney
held a long consultation with the accused
man yesterday, and at its conclusion ex
pressed the opinion that Flynn will have
but little difficulty in establishing his in
nocence. The preliminary hearing will
take place to-morrow, provided Mrs.
Browning is able to be present in court.
It developed yesterday that Dr. Quigley
furnished the clew which finally led to
the arrest oi Flynn. He called on Cap
tain Lees Wednesday and informed him
of the prisoner's visit to his office on Mon
day night. Detective Gibson was detailed
| to look into the case, and he was not long
! in fixing on Flynn as the guilty party.
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald sends a
communication to The Call correcting
the erroneous statement that John T.
Flynn was an attache of the Labor Bureau.
It seems that his only connection with the j
bureau was, as Fitzgerald declares, as fol
lows :
Mr. Flynn was associated with W. G. C. Pitt of
the Voice of Labor, at the instance of the latter
in a canvass relative to the removal of the
headquarters of the bureau, which canvass
was closed some time ago, and subsequently
he was connected with the reporlorial staff of
the Examiner.
He has never been in my employ as deputy,
clerk or agent, and the only connection with
this department was through Mr. Pitt, who
called in Mr. Flynn as an associate.
Now that Captain Lees has solved the
mystery in this case he will at once turn
iiis attention to finding the parents of the
baby girl left nude on the doorstep of Mrs.
Stewart, 31% Oak Grove avenue, last
Wednesday.
BRIGHT SUES HIS SISTER
The Aged Capitalist Alleges She
Has His Mcney and
Land.
Mrs. Mary Craig Charged With In
ordinate S3 fishnrss in Dea:i:g
With Her Brother.
Only last summer a stroke of paralysis
fell upon Robert Bright, the old capitalist.
To his mind thia â  meant- the end, so he !
transferred air his money and property to
his sister. But the aeed financier cheated
death. With returning health came a de
sire to regain rofsession of tiie wealth that
was his a few months before.
"I want the money and property back
again," he wrote in making his request.
"They are mine, and mine they fehall re
main,". was the only answer he received.
The situation continued unchanged
until Friday afternoon, when a complaint
was tiled by Attorney James H. McKnight
in the Superior Court against Mrs. Mary
Craig, who is. Bright's sister. The comp
laint alleged that on June 7, 1895, Bright
thought he was , dying, , and , prompted by.
a desire to save expenses of various kinds
he gaye "â  Mrs. Craig . $16,931. 37arid]a valu
able lot at ; the northeast , corner, of ; Polk
and Broadway streets. .'Bright did not die r
however, and â  his sister would not return
either the money or property. .
The suit, according to the complaint,
will be fought out on the declaration that
the money and property were only trans
ferred in trust, and for that reason ' the
court .will, be asked to decree that Mrs.
Craig has held it in trust for her brother.
The request is made that she be compelled
to Rive back the coin and property.
Bright was .a. capitalist for. thirty or
forty years; in <Ban Francisco. He first
amassed considerable wealth in the steam
boat business ] on : the Sacramento River,
and was once very wealthy. Much of his
money was made in dealing in San Fran
cisco real estate. He is a widower with
children, grandchildren and great-grand
children in San Fran cL'co," buc through
his unfortunate tiansfer is now in < strait
ened circumstances. A friend of nis said
last night that the old man was. an in
valid, deprived of comforts and attendance
which he sadly needed. Â
Mrs. Craig is an old woman . who lives in
this City. She is a widow, possessed of
large wealth, and did not need a dollar of
her brother's money. Like her brother
she has not many years \to live, and can
not spend her fortune in the remainder of
her; lifetime. r The case is considered, an
extraordinary one and may bring out a

FEDERAL JUDGES
NOT TO BLAME
Promptly Returned the Post
office Plans to Wash
ington.
OFFERED MANY CHANGES
Insufficient Floor Space Allowed
for the United States
Courts.
DELAY IN BEGINNING WORK.
The Responsibility Rests With the
Treasury Department at
Washington.
The dispatch from Washington to the
effect that the Postmaster of San Fran
cisco and the Judges of the United States
courts were delaying the commencement of
work on the new Federal buildinc has
been amply refuted by the head of the
postal department. But now the Federal
Judges come forward with the additional
testimony that the statements given out
by the chief architect's office at Washing
ton and published at length in The Call
are entirely without foundation. The
Judges are charitable enough to believe,
however, that Mr. Aiken, the supervising
architect, did not himself inspire the as
sertions attributed to his department, but
that they were made by a subordinate in
the service.
There is every reason to believe that no
United States officer in this City has in
any way interfered with the progress of
the enterprise, has unnecessarily withheld
the plans submitted for change by the
architect, or in any way delayed the com
mencement of work on the proposed build
ing.
"The plans submitted to me were re
turned to Mr. Aiken a month ago," said
Judge McKenna of the United States Cir
cuit Court yesterday, "and I have had no
further communication with him regard
ing the matter. I made what chanses in
the plans I thought necessary, as they
were not entirely satisfactory. Consid
erable room is needed for the transaction
of the business of the court and the space
needed was outlined in the plans as re
turned to the architect.
"I do not believe, however," continued
Judge McKenna, "that Mr. Aiken himself
made the statement that the delay in the
commencement of work on the new build
ing was because of the tardiness of the
Postmaster and the Judges of these courts.
There must be some mistake about it, or
probably it was given out by some subord
inate of the architect's office."

streets.
"Mr. Aiken submitted the floor plans
for the accommodation of the United
States courts in the new Postoffice build
ing to me for any changes that I might
deem advisable," said Judge Morrow of
the United States District Court yester
day, "and after examining them and
making some necessary alterations I re
turned them to the architect's office at
Washington on February 27 last.. Now it
is highly important that the United
States courts shall have plenty of room for
their convenience and accommodation.
Mr. O'Rourke's plans were only outlines
and could not be considered as definite.
He went out of office and Mr. Aiken suc
ceeded him. His plans were somewhat
more in detail, and when submitted to ma
I_went over them carefully and returned
them without delay. I have a letter from
Mr. Aiken acknowledging their receipt
and thanking me for the suggestions
which I offered.
"it is not altogether within the dis
cretion of the Judge as to how these
apartments shall be arranged," continued
Judge Morrow, "since the law makes the
court the custodian of the Spanish
archives, which require a separate room,
and the patents issued by the Government
another. Thesa records are kept for the
accommodation of the public. The clerk
of court requires at least two rooms and
the Judge two. These were not provided
for in the plans submitted. If I remember
right the District Attorney only had two
rooms (he has four now) and the Marshal
one. The clerk of the Court of Appeals
only had one room. Now, when the plans
were submitted the idea at once suggested
itself that I should raiher increase than
cut down the space limit
"On March 3, 1887," continued Judge
Morrow, as he became interested in the
subject, "Congress appropriated $350,000
for the purchase of a site in San Francisco
for a new postoffice and United States
court building. The sum was not consid
ered sufficient to purchase a site for a
building that would serve the purposes of
the Government for all time. Therefore,
on March 21, 1889, the amount was in
creased to $800,000. Even then the Com
missioners said that the sum was insuffi
cient to purchase the required site, and on
April 4, 1890, the appropriation was in
creased to $1,'_'50,000 for the purposes
named. The original act distinctly speci
fies that the proposed building shall be
large enough to sufficiently accommodate
the different offices in connection with the
postal department and the United States
courts."
Judge Morrow was in Congress when
the appropriations for the new Federal
buildinc were from time to time enlarged,
and he labored assiduously to secure the
enactment of the law providing for the
structure. Therefore he takes more than
a passing interest in the contemplated
enterprise, and is anxious to see the work
on the foundation begun.
Since Judges McKenna and Morrow and
Postmaster McCoppin have absolutely
contradicted the statement sent out from
Washington that they have withheld the
plans, and therefore delayed the com
mencement of work on the new Postoffieo
building, it will be necessary for the au
thorities at Washineton to devise other
and more substantial excuses for their
tardiness and neglect.

WAS THE HADJI POISONED?
Strange Tale Told by an Egyp
tian at the Receiving
Hospital.
IS A SHRINER DEGREE MASON.
When Seen at His Home He Flatly
Contradicts the Story Told at
the Receiving Hospital.
About 9 a. m. yesterday a man hurried
into the St. Nicholas drugstore, corner of
Hayes and Market streets, and exclaimed
that he had been poisoned. An emetic
was promptly given him, after which he
was hastily driven to the Receiving Hos
vital. There the stomach-pump was
brought into play, and the man's stomach
thoroughly emptied.
When he had convalesced sufficiently to
talk coherently, Le asked that a message
be sent to the secretary of the Masonic
Board of Relief and to Dr. Wallace de
Witt to attend him at once. This was
done, and pending their arrival the sick
man told a story that for strange blending
of the theatrical and the practical, the
fresh scenes and incidents of Western civ
ilization and trie mysticism of the Orient
lias never been excelled. It reads as if
penned bj\the hand of Haggard or Kip
ling.
Said he, "I was born in Cairo, Egypt, in
1862. Four years later I lost my mother
and came under the care of my grandaunt,
who reared me tenderly because I was
named after her brother, my grandfather,
who was killed at Sebastopol.
â¢'1 commenced my education at Ismailia,
Egypt, continued it in French at the
Frere College and in Arabia at Kootab,
finishing at ti.e University of Cairo.
"At 19 I married the daughter of A.
Pessoah, the famous old merchant of
Egypt. One of my children I have named
after Victor Hugo and the other after
Tuah, an Egyptian goddess.
"I have traveled extensively and have
been in Constantinople, Greece, Palestine,
Rhodes, Paris, London and other promi
nent places. Some of the men with whom
1 have been associated are Sir Arnold
Morley, Mr. Gardiner, M. P., and Lord
Porchester of England.
"My linguistic education includes Eng
lish, French, Italian, Spanish, Turk
ish. Greek, and all Arabic dialects.
Five of these I can write and hold cor
respondence in. I have also taken the
thirty-second degree in Masonry.
"During the Columbian Exposition I
brought 160 persons, selected from the
tribes and communities of Egypt, and
ensconced them in the "Streets of Cairo."
From there I came to San Francisco and
invested at the Midwinter Fair. Here I
met with ill luck, and lost everything.
"To-day a friend of mine gave me some
candy. I ate it and was immediately
taken sick. An examination showed me
that this candy had been steeped in a vir
ulent poison made from Indian hemp.
That is how I came to be here now."'
Though the Hadji was repeatedly urged
to give the name of this friend he stub
bornly refused to do so.
On arrival of Secretary Haw of the Ma
sonic Board of Relief it was ascertained
that his claim to be a Shnner Mason was
legitimate. Shortly afterward Dr. deWitt
procured a buggy and drove Raphael to
his home, corner Polk and Union streets.
When Raphael was seen at his home
late in the evening, though in bed by the
physician's orders, he did not seem to be
in any pain, conversed freely and ration
ally and was generally cheerful. But he
flatly cantradicted his former story of be
ing poisoned.
"The reason I told the druggist that I
had been poisoned," he said, "is because I
thought they would give me relief more
quickly than if they thought I was merely
ill."
When it was suegested that they might
have not used the right remedies for his
case, acting on this hypothesis, he re
marked that a man so ill as he could not |
HADJI RAPHAEL, WHOSE LIFE IS FILLED WITH MYSTERY.
think of all these things at once. Evi
dently he overlooked the fact that his
mind was clear enough to think up a
means of being quickly relieved.
"Let me tell you the trouble," he said.
"I was bilious. This complaint is heredi
tary. My father used to be attacked this
way and woula remain in a comatose
state for twenty-four hours at a time.
Nothing cisc was the trouble with me."
It was mentioned to him that some curi
ous-minded persons might think he had
tried to commit suicide.
"No, no!" he exclaimed rising on his el
bow and emphasizing his words with his
forefinger. "That is the resource of a cow
ard. The Egyptian motto is 'The Dead |
Are Worse Off Than We.' Did you ever j
hear the legend of the Egyptian'who had \
only a nickel to his nam â¢ and contem- i
plated suicide? He purchased a sack of I
peanuts and went up to the top of the
Sphinx, intending to eat them and then
jump to his death. As he ate them and
dronped the shells he went into a vision.
"Below him hesaw the men of the nether
worid. and as each peanut shell dropped
they fought with one another for the pos
session of it. That man was something of
a philosopher, and he concluded that if a
man could eat peanuts here, but had to
right for the shells in the nether world, he
would hoid on to a good thing, and, as you
Americans say, 'push it along.'"
It is said that a lecture Raphael de
livered at the World's Fair, entitled "The
American Seed in the Land of the' Ph
araohs," is an eloquent tribute to the thrift,
cenerosity and enterprise of the Ameri
can people in transplanting Western
ideas to the Orient. It is also said that he
has written an able paper on "The Chas
tisement of the Conscience." An article
published by him in the Overland Monthly
for August. 1894, headed "Egyptian Super
stitions," attracted some attention and
shows much scholarship.
Meanwhile, the ghost that sits over the
tomb of the Pharaohs, when interrogated
as to whether Hadji Raphael was poisoned,
endeavored to commit suicide or was only
bilious, simply remains silent and "saws
wood."
TWO WORKMEN INJURED
A. Bucher Swung Bound by r Belt

A. Bucher, an employe in the California
Wire Works, Bay and Mason streets, was
caught in the belting yesterday afternoon
and swung off his feet before being re
leased. The ambulance was summoned,

but Bucher refused to go to the Receiving

sprained and he seemed to be injured in

whirled round and round till his clothing
was torn from his body and be was badiy

James King, an employe of Porter,
Slessinger & Co., 7 Battery street, was en
caged yesterday afternoon putting leather
into rollers to soften it. He stuck his hand
too far in and it was slowly drawn under
the roller. King yelled for help and at
tempted to pull out his right hand with
bis left, which was also drawn in. The
machinery was stopped and King was re
leased from his painful medicament.
Both hands were torn and bleeding. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital in
the patrol wagon. Dr. Thompson found
that two fingers of his ri. ht Land and
four fingers of his left hand were torn,
but it was not necessary to amputate them.
He was sent to his borne, 234 Twenty

Found Gold and Coal.
Captain Hans Christian Pande of Tacoma,
special inspector of customs on board the
steam schooner Essex, which sailed from here
for Cooks Inlet with eighty gold-miners
aboard a few weeks ago, has returned here and
is at the Grand. He says he met several Cooks
Inlet gold prospectors at the spit in Katche
kamak Bay. They claimed they had found
gold and were well satisfied. Inspector Pande
says there is an enormous amount of lignite
coal at that point. It has broken off on the
beach by tons. It is good for household use.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 10, 1896.
NEW IN THE NAVAL LINE
A Cruiser Whose Four Propellers
Drive Her at Thirty
Knots.
WIDE - SWEEPING BATTEEIES.
Can Be Submerged to a Low Freeboard
When Going Into Actionâ A
Deep Ram.
Something novel in cruiser-building has
been invented and patented by Walter de
Varila, mining and mechanical engineer,
of 316 California street in this City.
Mr. Varila, who is a member of the
Mechanical Engineering Institute of
London, has for some time been making a
study of naval science, and the result of
his research is a four-propeller ship of high
speed, a peculiarly shaped hull con
structed to be submerged to a low free
board ana a battery having a greater
range of fire than before known.
These are the principal features claimed
by the young engineer for his invention,
which, if found to be successful, will be
another advance in the nautical appliances
of war.
From the models and drawings may be
seen in prospective a modern cruiser 375
feet in length over all, 56 feet beam at the
ordinary waterline and 20 feet in depth
from the garboard strake to the main
deck. There is no material change in
shape of hull beginning at the stern and
moving aft until almost two-tbirds of her
length has been gone over. Then comes a
striking change. On each side from bottom
to deck tue walls of the shin almost
abruptly fall in several feet, leaving a
place for wbt>t the inventor calls the two
amidship propellers. Further under the
stern are the twin screws of an ordinary
vessel.
In putting the auxiliary propellers so
near the center of the hnll the inventor
has caught his idea from the rowboat
moved by a Dair of oars amidships; also
from a desire to find a place for the two
extra screws. He claims that his ship can
be made to turn completely around in a
circle of 300 feet in diameter going at full
speed. One propeller backs as the other
goes ahead, pivoting the ship, as the two
oars pulled vice versa in the rowboat.
Each of the propellers is driven by a
separate engine, and with a coal consump
tion of 200 tons in twenty-four hours will
attain a continuous speed of not less than
thirty knots and twenty-two knots with
122 tons. These propellers are two-bladed
and are of duplex power, constructed to
give tbe greatest speed with the fewest
revolutions.
Their dimensions are 12 feet, with a con
tinuous curvature of 19>Â£ feet. The Inven
tor claims that he has tested them and has
obtained an increase of speed over the
ordinary screw of the same length of blade
of 700 leet to a knot. Each of the four en
gines is of 3000 horsepower.
Tlie second great feature is the sinking
of the huil to a low freeboard. The hull
has double walls, and the compartments
or spaces between the outer and inner
casings are about 18 inches wide amid
ships," decreasing toward the stem and
stern. These spaces can be filled with
water, lowering the hull four feet, thereby
presenting less surface to hostile fire. This
also drops the ram four more feet or twelve
feet below the ordinary water line.
Mr. Varila claims that as the armor of
the modern cruisers only extends about
five feet below their water line his keen
steel ram will pierce the comparatively
unprotected bilges of an enemy's hull like
a knife blade through cork. His hull will
be sheathed in armor belt of ample thick
ness.
The third practical feature claimed for
this new craft is the concentration and
range of gun fire. All of the pieces have
high mounts, permitting them to be de
pressed upon targets close to the ship. Iv
the two large turrets the 8-inch rifles may
work on an object twenty-two yards dis
tant and the 4-inch in the four side tur
rets may make things warm for a torpedo
boat even twenty feet away.
The two large guns sweeping around
fully 270 deerrees and the four smaller
pieces describing a range of 220 degrees
make tbe battery a most formidable one.
The side guns may be trained across the
deck, making a starboard rifle bear on an
object on the port side. A secondary bat
tery of machine guns will complete the
new cruiser's fighting strength. Slie will
be provided with three torpedo tubes, one
forward and two aft.
Another feature claimed is the ram,
which is backed by blocks of heavy tim
bers placed fore and aft. This wooden
filling not only strengthens the weapon,
but takes up all the concussion of a blow,
saying the ship from the possible injury of
a jar. The forward turret is also the con
ning tower to be used in action. The coal
bunker capacity is 2000 tons, making her
a long-distance cruiser, as this will permit
her to steam abont 7200 miles at a thirty
knot speed and 8400 miles at twenty-two
knots an hour.

REVOLUTIONARY DAUGHTERS.
A Notable Reception by Them in tbe
Century Club Kooms.
Tbe Daughters of tha American Revolu
tion gave a charming reception at tbe Cen
tury Club yesterday afternoon from 3 to 6.
The rooms were exquisitely decorated,
under direction of Mrs. Moore, with Amer
ican flags, bamboo and roses. Notwith
standing the threatening weather, the
fashionable throng crowded tbe spacious
rooms to suffocation. There was a delight
ful sociability about the whole affair that
made the occasion an exception. A notice
able feature was the large number of very
handsome women. There was a charming
musical programme and it was a notice
able fact that the Daughters of the Revo
lution understood and practiced that cour
tesy to the musician or reader that is often
lacking in other places.
The Sequoia Chapter of the Daughters
of the American Revolution was organ
ized in December, 1891. at the residence of
Mrs. General D. D. Colton, with Mrs. Le
land Stanford and Mrs. Henry Mac Lean
Martin as honorary regents, and Mrs. Wil
liam Alvcrd as chapter regent. Its prin
cipal object is to foster a patriotic spirit
in celebrating National anniversaries.
Lexington day, 1894, was celebrated in
noteworthy fashion by planting a lioerty
tree in Golden Gate Park. Earth from 150
not d and sacred spots was deposited.
When earth from Lafayette's tomb in
Paris, from Mount Vernon, and many bat
tle fields were mingled together, many
prophesied that it could not live in such
a mixture, but it has thriven well. Tne
poem for the occasion, by Mrs. Frank J.
French, contained these lines:
For never grew a tree so grandly fed
From ibe mingled dust of a nation's dead;
And the society is proud of its emblem
of liberty, which is a living thing. The
scene of the planting was one of the most
impressive ever witnessed in San Fran
cisco. Lexington day, '95, waa celebrated
by an elaborate tea at the Occidental
Hotel, and this is the third lime that the
day has been observed.
Mrs. Olive Reed Batchelder charmed all
with an exquisite contralto solo, and Miss
Henry of Berkeley made a nit and capti
vated the audience with her two delight
ful numbers. Miss Maud Noble gave a
trombone solo, "Let Me Like a Soldier
Fall" ; Miss Pearl Noble gave a stirring
and appropriate rendition of the "Star
spangled Banner"; the Misses Noble after
ward gave a trombone and cornet duet
from "II Trovatore"; Mrs. C. Edward
Brown read a most beautiful and patriotic
essay.
Among those present were: Mrs. Wil
liam Afvord, State regent; Mrs. Henry
Wetherbee, regent of Sequoia Chapter;
Mrs. George Barstow, vice-regent; Mrs.
Joseph L. Moody, Mrs. Selden S. Wrignt,
Mrs. John D. Tallant, Mrs. Ward well,

BLOOMERS PASSING AWAY
The Pretty Girl With Bifurcated
Drapery Is Already
Doomed.
DECLINE OF ANOTHER FAD.
Swelldom Smiled Upon but Did Not
Copy Her, and Soon the
Novelty Ceased.
The bloomer girl of San Francisco is go-
Ing from us.
Like all things that come to gladden and
distress the heart of man and sometimes
incidentally to occasion family disputes,
woman, fair woman, of all ages and of all
previous conditions of flowing skirts, has,
in her fickleness, begun to leave her
Dloomers to the seclusion of some dark
and moth-threatened closet at home. For
the fad for the natty, jaunty things that
looked like baggy trousers and permit
ted just a suggestion, or sometimes more
than a suggestion, of well-rounded calf to
be visible, is certainly on the decline in
San Francisco. When such another op
portunity for a display of coquettishness
may occur is as uncertain as the equilib
rium of a beginner awheel. But it will
manifest itself somewhere; for ever de
siening, charming woman will not remain
content with what has been.
The bustle came and went. It rose and
then fell with the certainty of all things
that are developed beyond an artistic
semblance to reality. But the bloomer
was not a monstrosity. It varied as did
the individuals that affected it, but wher
ever it was unattractive the fault lay not
so much in the material or in the fit as in
the limbs and feet that a kindly skirt
might better have covered. In it the
matron who liked to imagine that she was
still girlish and sprightly did not always
look exactly angelic,, perhaps because of a
pair of beer-keg calves that maintained
the same uniform rotundity until they
;:-ned into feet.
She wonders why her dyspeptic, slen
der-shanked husband objected to her
wearing bloomers! And the would-be
considered athletic woman, whose peaked
features and swift, mannish stride were
always an indication that if by accident
she should gain an ounce of much-needed
flesh she would hastily run it off â she aid
not loom up much in bloomers, either;
but she would wear them. And how often
did man think that whatever might be the
extra cost for the lavish fullness of the
modish skirt 3 and voluminous sleeves and
the high stocks, it was devoted to a good
cause if it only made him forget that the
owl is a very small bird when robbed of
its feathers.
But all this is only incidental to the fact
that the bloomer craze is on the wane. The
local dressmakers, women's tailors, and
dealers in ready-made bloomers, almost
to an individual, admit that where the
demand was at its height a year ago, it is
become so light that the bloomer trade
can hardly be considered one of their
sources of revenue.
Yet the experience of these persons
should not be taken as a conclusive proof.
The great majority of bloomers have been
made at home. Sometimes by dress
makers; more often by novices, who per
haps had never profited even by the expe
rience of making little Johnnie a pair of
"pants' 1 from papa's discarded "jeans."
The bloomer may cost anything from
simply the labor employed in the home
product remodeled from an erstwhile
skirt, to the most approved creation of the
skilled artisan ranging up in the twenties,
thirties and forties, leaving the ready
made article and the private dressmaker's
production to fill in all the degrees between
the extremes of absolute economy and lav
ish indifference to price.
One pretty little dressmaker thinks that
unskilled workmanship has had much to
do with the decline and fall of the bloomer.
"Oh, yes, most of them are made at
home," she said, "and don't they look it?
When a thing ceases to be natty it goes out
of style. Many of the bloomers had be
gun to look about as genteel as workmen's
overalls."
The novelty of bloomer waitresses was
tried and it resulted in only a more
hasty return to skirts. Even the dives
added to their doubtful allurements of bad
music and faded and haggish femininity
by introducing the bloomer. It soon ran
its course.
In the earlier rains of this winter the
bloomer girl ventured forth, but in the
recent snowers she has been only a pleas
ant memory to be mused on by the staring
cigar-stand statuary on Market and
Kearny streets.
Where the bloomer girl used to be seen
shyly flitting out in the uncertain light of
evening for a spin up and down the blocu
on her -wheel or her brother's wheel, she
has ceased to wander.
That girl is still in existence. Wait
until she comes out in all her glory as the
irresistible summer girl, and you will
think so. The bloomers, too, are yet in
tact. The wheel is uninjured. The dis
position of the girl alone has changed.
Always eager for that that is latest and
calculated to make her most attractive,
the San Francisco girl is becoming tired
of her bloomers. They were real fun for
a while, but when the novelty was gone
the greatest charm was gone with it.
The co-eds of the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford may cling to their
bloomers for succeeding basket-ball
matches, happy in the consciousness that
they will be flatteringly illustrated in the
newspapers by horrid man, who must not
see but who may imagine their struggles.
Their experience will have about it the
charm that has always been attached to
things forbidden from the time of the first
apple to latter-day notices on high fences
warning boys not to filch the fruit within.
Whether or not the shocked Berkeley
women's cry of horror at the suggestion of
their public appearance in basket-ball
attire aided in discouraging the bloomer
girl is not definitely known. That it
formed one of the steps down from her
platform can ea3ily be imagined.
Simply because much fewer bloomers
are sold now and much fewer are made is
not the basis of the assertion that the
bloomer girl is unconsciously preparing to
evolve into some other delightful form.
Observation is the most conclusive proof
that the bloomer girl that was will be no
more.
Bowhay, the ladies' tailor on Post street,
says that the really swagger set here has
never favored bloomers. With them the
short Bkirt, as hign sometimes as the shoo
tops, has formed part of their correct
cycling dress, real knickerbockers, caught
below the knee by an elastic band, being
another part, but never in evidence.
Miss Ostrander of the Phelan buildine
says that dressmakers have probably made
more bloomers for matrons than for misses,
but that from her own experience and
from what she knows from others, there
has been a regular decrease for runny
months in the demand. D. Cohan of
Powell street says that the bloomer trade
is not anything like what it was a year ago.
Davidson & Miller of Post street, while
confessing that bloomers are going out of
popular fashion, think that it is only a
natural response to the styles introduced
in the East first and ultimately adopted
here. They think that the divided skirt
will take the place of the bloomer with
wheelwomen. Newman & Levinson, of all
the firms and dressmakers briefly ques
tioned pn the subject, were alone in the
experience that the demand for bloomers
has not materially decreased.
If, oh if, bloomers might become tha
thing for the small boy, think how readily
he could come forth in San Francisco, at
tiredjas the legitimate successor to his older
sister, his mamma, or his aunt!
GOING TO MOSCOW.
Some Well -Known Californians Who
May Attend the Coronation of
the CiÂ»r.
Prince Poniatowski, who has been so
journing in San Francisco for several
months, left the City last Wednesday for
Paris. It is expected that he will extend
his journey to Moscow and attend the cor
onation of the Czar. According to the
present outlook San Francisco will be
largely represented at that imperial func
tion.
Colonel C. F. Crocker, who leaves for
New York in a day or two, will prolong
his trip to Moscow and take a look at the
assembled royalty.
Joseph D. Redding of New York, who
has been in town for several weeks, left for
his Eastern home last evening. If he can
arrange his business affairs in New York
he will visit Moscow and see the Czar
crowned.
Commodore Harry M. Gillie of the
Larchmont Yacht Club, New York, will
represent that institution at Moscow dur
ing the coronation. He is in San Fran
cisco now, but will Btart for the East in a
day or two.
Fred K. Webster will leave the City next
Tuesday for New York. He will go abroad
before returning to San Francisco. ' but
owing to engagements elsewhere will not
be able to reach Moscow in time for th^
coronation.
Thomas A. Hubbard and General Fran
cis Fessenden, who represent large in
terests in the Southern Pacific Railway
Company, left the City for New York yes
terday, going via Los Angeles. They will
not extend the trip to Moscow. It is pre
dicted that Mr. Hubbard in 1897 wifi be
crowned Czar of the Southern Pacific to
succeed C. P. Huntington.
It is known as a fact that the place was
within his reach at the last election, but
he was not in a position to accept the le
spqnsible trust. His friends say that con
ditions will arise before the next annual
meeting which will virtually compel him
to accept the first place in the manage
ment of the corporation.
Ed H. Hamilton, who is about to retire
from the arduous position of managing
editor of the Examiner, is said to have the
option of reporting the National conven
tions in the United States this summer or
going to Moscow to do the coronation of
the Czar.
Several well-known society ladies of this
City are making calculations to attend the
imperial function. The United States
Ambassador to Russia, Colonel Clifton
Breckinridge or Arkansas, will have all he
can do to provide places "on the inside"
for the Americans who are inclined to see
tiie Czar formally mustered in.
TRAVELERS ELECT OFFICERS.
Annual Meeting of the California Post
at the Grand.
At the second annual meeting of Cali
fornia Post of the Travelers' Protective
Association of America at the Grand Hotel
Jast night a communication was received
from J. Wolf, the former secretary of the
post which the existing one superseded,
arid which endeavored to enjoin the new
post from transacting business as a branch
of the National body. In this letter an
offer was made to withdraw the suit on
certain conditions. The matter was re
ferred to the National association.
Officers were elected as follows: Presi
dent, E. M. Bacbelder ; first vice-president,
L. O Kepfler; second vice-president, J. F.
Cattslmll; secretary and treasurer, Solo
mon Davidson; board of directorsâ J. Zer
man, Jed M. Scott, H. W. Hickman L.
N. Tryon, W. B. McKay, C. H. Woods
Edgar Rosenblatt, H. J. Darling, C. M.
Zeitler. The two last named are from
Sacramento; all the other officers are of
this City. The following committee chair
men were appointed by President Bach
elder, each chairman having the privilege
of making up his own committee: Kail
road, L. 0. Kepfler; hotel, J. Zerman;
press, J. F. Cattshall; employment, C. H.
Woods; legislative, J. H. Batcher, Saora
mento.
It was decided not to send a delegate to
the National Convention.

If your body is partially covered with
sores which itch badly, or which run con-
tinually," or are hard to heal; or if your
hair is beginning to fall out ; if your teeth
are loose or are loosening, you may be as-
sured that your blood is in a very impure
state. These symptoms frequently follow
the contraction of diseases of a private na-
ture, and they may be due too to a parent
or nurse who had some affliction. "HUD-

promptly and permanently. It is a purely
vegetable compound, but strong and cef.

Mrs. Edward I. Mahoney Bru
tally Beaten With a Black
thorn Stick.
EESCUED BY HER ATTORNEY.
Her Husband Now Occupies a Padded
Cell in the Receiving Hos
pital.
Edward I. Mahoney, wholesale liquor
merchant, 31 Fourth street, was taken to
the Receiving Hospital last night in the
patrol wagon by Policeman Irvine aid
placed in a padded cell.
Four years ago Mahoney married a rich
widow, several years his senior, and since
then, it is decJared, he has been neglecting
his business, contenting himself with liv
ing upon the income of his wife's prop
erty.
For the past two years he has been
drinking neavily and in his drunken
moods his wife suffered. Yesterday after
noon Colonel J. J. OByrne, who is Mrs.
Mnhoney's legal adviser, went to her resi
dence, 412 Taylor street, as he had heard
there had been trouble in the house. Just
as he entered the servant ran against him
and implored him to save her mistress'
life.
Colonel O'Byrne ran to Mrs. Mahoney's
room and a sight met his eyes that stirred
his blood. Mahoney was beating his wife
brutally with a blackthorn stick and she
Was stretched on the floor covered from
head to feet with blood. Her face was
beaten almost to a jelly and her eyes were
blackened and swollen.
The colonel sprang upon Mahoney and a
desperate struggle ensued for possession of
the blackthorn. Mahoney in his maddened
state seemed to be possessed of a giant's
strength, but the colonel succeeded in
wresting the stick from him. He held
bim till assistance arrived and Mahoney
was put under restraint.
Dr. Albert J. Noble of Powell street, the
family physician, was summoned and he
attended to the injured woman. Her in
juries, although severe, are not necessarily
fatal.
Colonel O'Byrne hastened to police head
quarters and after consulting with Captain
Ilealy it was arranged that Dr. Noble
should swear out a warrant before Judge
Daiugerheld for Mahoney's arrest on the
ground of alcoholic insanity. The doctor
did so and Irvine was given 1 the warrant to
serve. He is a powerful man, but he had
all he could do to put the Handcuffs on
Mahoney and take him to the hospital.
He fought all the way to get away from
Irvine, and at the hospital it required sev
eral men to put him in the padded cell.
Mahoney was at one time prominently
dentiricd with the politics of the Demo
cratic party, and held a high position in the
Young Men's Institute. His bibulous
tendencies had the effect of making him
lose prestige in the political field, and he
was quietly dropped from the Institute.
He will be taken before the Insanity
Commissioners to-morrow morning.
CAW WAS EXONERATED
The Blairmore Court of Inquiry
Concluded Its Work
Yesterday.
Tripping on H;r Own Chain Dur
ing a Heavy Gale Was the
Cause of the Accident.
The Blairmore inquiry before Vice-
Consul Moore was concluded yesterday.
W. B. Goodrum, superintendent of the
refinery dock, testified that he put 250 tons
of ballast into the ship. He was positive
that fully this weight of rock and dirt was
used.
Captain Langford of the British ship
â  Inveresk stated that his ship was about
600 yards from the Blairmore when the
accident occurred. He had noticed that
ship the Sunday previous, April 9, and
caw that she remained upricht when head
on to the wind, but when athwart the tide
bad a fairish amount of heel.
''The Blairmore didn't appear to lack
Stability." said the witness. "If my ship
had acted as that vessel did I would not
have felt satisfied, because the Inveresk is
a very stiff ship. I was in the Ascalon, a
composite ship, which was very cranky,
the used to lay over quite as much when
ehe was neavilv laden as when she was
loaded with light cargoes. I consider in
such a gale as we had April 9 that if a ship
was athwart the tide she would be in dan
ger. I intended to get my ship away from
the wharf that morniug, and the tug
was alongside, but seeing how it blew I
made all fast again.
"I think the cause of the Blairmore dis
aster was her running ahead of the chain,
tripping on it athwart tne tide. I lay near
the Blairmore in the harbor of Newcastle
wheu we had several strong gales. She
was in about the same condition as I
could see, and she behaved very well."
The court then went into a considera
tion of the testimony. Summing up the
sworn statements of the witnesses, it was
8Â«-en that with the exception of Second
Mate McDonald of tne unfortunate ves
sel and Henry Matson of the ship Vere
jean all had testified to the exoneration of
Captain Caw.
All of the masters of different vessels
who had been eye-witnesses of the
catastrophe had sworn that there was no
ground upon which to censure the master
of the lucKless Blairraore. "While some of
her crew had spoken among themselves of
her action in the strong winds that blew i
over Mission Bay, they did not consider j
that there was any real danger, and i
neither they nor anybody had spoken to j
Captain Caw. McDonald testified that he ;
had had trouble with his commander.
The following is the verdict of the court
of inquiry:
Finding and order of a naval court held at
the British Consulate-General at San Fran
cisro on the 10th, 17th and 18ih days of April,
lÂ«9(i, tv investigate the circumstances attend
ing the capsizing and .sinking of the British
shiiÂ» Jtlairmoru of Glasgow, official number
102029, when anchored in the bay of San
Francisco, on the 9th of April, 1890, wbereby
h>-s of life ensued, and to investigate the cause
of such capsizing and sinking and to inquire
into the conduct of the muster ana crew.
The Bloirriio.-o wag a steel vessel, ship rigged,
Of 1*67 ton^ burden registered tonnage, official
u umber 102029, built in 1893 and belonging
to the port of Glasgow.
It appears from the evidence given before I
this court that she arrived safely with a cargo I
of coal, which she discharged at this nort
that she took on board 230 long tons of ballast,
consisting of earth and btones, and had on
board in addition to that about forty tons of
coal and about nineteen tons of water; that I
the ballust was placed in the lower hold at !
each side of the tanks and in.iiuniast, and
leveled down to the satisfaction of the waster*
that the coal was in the lower iorepeak, and
that the water-tanks were situated In the lower
bold abaft the mainmast; that the
vessel proceeded to Mission Bay, in
the harbor of San Francisco, and
anchored there on the Bth ol March
1890; that while lying there she experienced
more or less bad weather at various times, and
it would appear tnat she heeled to a consider
able extent, but not sufficient to cause anxiety
to her master or to the majority of the masters
of ships lying in the vicinity.
No serious leeling of alarm as to the vessel's
stability was felt among the members of the
crew, although some of them had discussed
the matter among themselves in a joking man
ner. On the 9th day of April, 1896, the vessel
had on board fifteen hands all told, including
the master. At about 4 o'clock in the morning
very severe weather was experienced, with
heavy squalls, the vessel heeling considerably
at that time.
The weather moderated slightly after this
and at V a. m. the men turned to, the following
members of the crew being taken into the hold
by the first mate and set to work chipping the
ship's sides:
T. Luduate, first mate; D. McDonald, second
mate; William Melville, third mate; Henry
Clark A. B. ; Albert Lowell, Roland Siegle,
Hamilton BeU, John Pope, Stuart Marwick and
v ictor Bannehr, apprentices.
The carpenter, James Watson, and Samuel
Kenny, steward, were about the decks. H.
I-ynstrand, A. 8.. night watchman, was in his
bunk, and T. RenneDaum was in the sailroom
on deck. At ti A 5 a. m. a heavy shifting squall
struck the ship and she capsized and sunk.
The master was on deck at the time and he
Rnd eitfht of his crow were picked up, some off
the hull and some from the ship's boat which
had beÂ«n%towing astern, by boats from the
British ships British Yeoman and Cromdale
which were lying in the vicinity. The follow
ing men were drowned :
T. Ludgate, chief mate; Henry Clark, A. B.;
Roland Siegle, apprentice; Samuel Kenny,
steward; H. Lynstrand, A. 8., and T. Renne
baum, A. B.
The court having regard to the circum
suinees above stated find as follows:
That the master appears to have been justi
fied in considering his ship to be properly
stiffened with the amount of ballast, coal and
water that was in her, as he had commanded
the Blainnore for two and a half years, during
which time she had frequently been in ballast
at other ports, lying in exposed positions with
less stiffening than was in her at the time or

visions and 105 Miners Aboard.
[Sketched by a "Call " artitt.]
the casuality, and that as for as the evidence
shows there was no serious feeling of alarm
among the members of the crew regarding the
ship's stability, although several of them had
discussed the matter in a jesting manner
among themselves. They made no complaint
to any in authority, and the master was to
tally unaware that any such feeling existed, !
with two exceptions.
The evidence of thG master and the officers of
ships lying in the vicinity of the Blairmore
shows that there was no feeling of alarm
among them regarding the vessel's condition.
The court regards it as an important circum
stance that the men happened to be at work in
the hold that morning, but sees no reason to
attribute blame to the master, as he did not
give any orders as to what duties they should
perform, and as the weather had moderated
somewhat before they went below, the squall
that capsized the ship was quite unexpected.
In the opinion of this court the casualty was
caused by the vessel being struck by a heavy
squall while riding ahead of her anchor, fore-
Ing the ship across her cable, wnich tightened
with the heavy strain and caused her to swing
across the tide. This movement brought the
wind on her beam, and the combination of
these three forces acting together effected the
I disaster.
The expenses of this court, fixed at Â£18 7s
9d, are approved.
Dated at San Francisco the 18th day of
April, 1896.
"The court exonerated Captain Caw,"
said Consul Moore yesterday, "because
under the testimony it could not do other
wise. Most all the eyewitnesses of the
accident testified that the vessel surged
ahead over her chain and tripped on it
broadside into the wind when it blew the
strongest. If s:ie could have swung a few
feet farther around she might have recov
ered. This was most unfortunate, and
hence the terrible casualty. Second Mate
McDonald showed some personal feeling
against his captain, and Mate Matson was j
aboard another ship. None of the crew of I
the Blairmore were afraid of the rocking
of their vessel, but joked about it."
THEY ARE AFTER KING
Chairman of the Hospital Com
mittee Charged With Neg
lect of Duty.
Said to Have Refused to Sign Requi
sitions for Supplies and Patients
Are Suffering.
There will be filed before the Board of
Supervisors to-morrow a statement from
Superintendent Stahie of the City and
County Hospital and Steward George F.
Robinson, charging Supervisor King,
| chairman of the Hospital Committee,
I with so neglecting his duty as to place the
j hospital and its officers in a most embar-
I raHsinsr position.
Tiie superintendent and the steward
yesterday visited the office of the Board of
Health and made complaint, and after
ward visited the Mayor, and nnder advice
will lay their complaint before the board.
They say tnat Supervisor King has for
two weeks past refused to si^n any of the
requisitions for food, so that the steward
has been compelled to beg supplies from
the merchants upon a promise to get a
requisition later.
"The merchants have been very indul.
gent," said Steward Robinson last night
"as we would have been completely out of
necessary supplies and the patients would
be suffering. I have seen Supervisor King
repeatedly and explained the situation to
him to no effect. I have to seek him in
I his barroom, and he makes capital before
the ward heelers by whom he is sur
rounded by Mulling me off.
"The toughs put him on the back and
cry, 'Good boy, Joe,' when he bawls out
] that he is not going to sign the requisition
and their approval seems to be sufficient to
warrant him in allowing the patients to
suffer. I shall go to his barroom no more,
but we will bring the matter before the
Board of Supervisors." <

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19. 1896.
ALASKAN MINERS RETURN
Others Who Want to Tempt
Fortune Will Leave on
the Albion.
MANY TALES OF DESTITUTION.
Cooks Inlet Is Frozen In, and Men
Who Went Up Early Have Not
Made a Cent.
A serious state of affairs reigns in
Alaska. Sitka and Juneau are known
to be overflowing with miners wko cannot
start for the gold fields on account of the
ice and snow on the hills, and now comes
the news that Cooks Inlet is frozen and
that the miners who went up early are
suffering great hardships. Provisions are
plentiful, but the prices charged are ex
orbitant. Some of the men are destitute
and not one has taken enough gold to pay
for a second-class passage to Puget Sound,
much less San Francisco. The gold fields,
as a rule, are said to be a miserable apol
ogy for an El Dorado, and hundreds of
miners are only awaiting the opportunity
to return home.
The news from the inlet should cer
] tainly discourage those who intend trying
I their fortune in the far north. The coun
{ try is overrun with prospectors, and in
i some instances the suffering of the ad
i venturers is heartrending. Starvation
j faces many who have forced their way
I into the interior, and misery and privation
await all.
i The steam schooner Excelsior, Captain
| J. F. Higgins, arrived direct from Cooks
Inlet yesterday. The passengers were:
Thomas Fleming, Alfred (Jorenue, C. H.
Bullock. J. C. vVilson, Louis Satter, S.
Hankerson, J. E. La Shelle, John Lavig
noui, Phillip Rinasso, Thomas Walker, J.
W. Holm, Joseph Cater and H. C. Pende.
Nearly all of these are men who had
I enough of Alaska mining and had enough
money to pay their way home.
"Cooks Inlet is not crowded with ice,"
said one of the miners yesterday, "but it
is cold enough to make a stove a necessity.
When a man has to hug a stove all day
there is not much chance for mining. At
Kachemak, where many of the miners are
camped, the thermometer occasionally
dropped to 40 deg. below zero. Ice is a
foot thicK over some properties, and the
mass that covers all the reefs is under
yards of snow. My advice to those con
templating a mining venture to Alaska is,
'Don't.' "
The steam-schooner Excelsior is the ves
sel that took a party of Oakland enthusi
asts to Cooks Inlet. Prior to their depar
ture they refused to reveal their destina
tion. On March 11 the steamer sailed
from Mission-street wharf, and some of
] the miners who went out on her returned
on her yesterday. The first point reached
was riitka, and the run was without inci
dent. On March 29 another start was
made, and heavy southeast gales were en
countered. The vessel was not well fitted
to encounter them, as the cabins were
| crowded, the holds overflowing and the
decks littered with lumber, while a num
ber of horses were penned up forward.
The weather turned extremely cold, and
four of the horses died from the exposure.
On the 3d inst. the Excelsior reached
Kachemak. in Turnaganifarm. Coal Point
was frozen over and all the lighters were
frozen in. Captain Higgins says the
weather was fine, but all the miners as
sert that it was the worst ever experienced
in Alaska and that no such thing as "fine
weather" is ever prevalent in Alaska. As
the lighters were frozen in some method
of landing the men and their belongings
had to be resorted to. Rafts were made
out of the lumber and on these everything
was ferried ashore. There were no heavy
winds and no snow, so the landing was
comparatively easy.
Alter getting rid of her cargo the Excel
sior sailed again for San Francisco on the
10th inst. and made a good run of seven
and a half days to this port. A letter re
ceived by her says: "Do not come up
here. It is all a fable about the richness
of the mines. Starvation and misery
threaten all the men who came here with
a bare traveling allowance of coin."
In spite of all these discouraging re
ports the steam-schooner Albion is listed
to sail this morning for Cooks Inlet wiih
I 105 miners, five of whom have their
I families with them. Friday last the in
spectors of hulls and boilers limited the
number of passengers to eighty-four, but
since then extra accommodations have
been put in and the horses and cattle will
not be taken. Those of the party who
cannot get away on the Albion will go on
the Sophia Sutherland, which will sail
Monday or Tuesday.
The Albion is loaded down to the gun
wales, and if anything like rough weather
is experienced the passengers will have a
hard time of it. As it is there is not five
feet of apace in which they can move
about, as every inch of decfe room is taken
up with coal, hay, lumber and provisions.
Many of the men do not like the manner
in which the vessel is loaded down, but
will take their chances sooner than lose the
money they hare paid for their passage.
A CHANGE OF HEART.
Returned Alaskan Fortune-Hunters
Say They Went for Their
Health.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
tOB Broadway, April 18. \
The Oaklauders who left here a few
weeks ago for Alaska deceived their
friends. They declare that the story that
they went to seek for gold was untrue.
Now that they have returned about six
months before they were expected and
with no gold they are enlightening their
friends by telling that they merely went
for their health.
This morning the bark Excelsior re
turned and seventeen disappointed peot>le
returned on beard of her. They are al
most unanimous in saying that they took
their mining implements by way of a joke
and that it was purely a hygienic trip.
What part patent mining apparatus and
winter clothing played in a pleasure trip is
not explained.
Among the Oaklanders who came back
was R. H. Wise Sr. "I went up not to
stay to mine, but in the hope that ray
health would be benefited by the voyage.
Most of those who returned had intended
to go into the mines, but the managers de
cided that they did not need so many
hands and let them out. They were
afraid the food supply might run short.
The party were getting along well and
were in good spirits when we left.
"On the way up one party chartered the
steamer General Canby at Seattle, but
when we left Cooks Inlet she had not ar
rived. They were waiting for her, and I
heard since that an accident happened to
her.
"The cargo of the Excelsior was dis
charged upon a spit in the inlet and they
have a large building erected there. When
the Canby arrives she will carry the freight
from this spit around to a place near
where the mining is to take place, The
spit is about 125 miles away.
"Our party never intended going to the
Yukon. Their mining is to be done on
Six-mile CreeK, Union Creek and Res-
- urrection Creek. I understand the
men who were returned received their
pay, but theie was some dissatisfac
tion among them on account of being dis
charged so quickly."
The news from Cooks Inlet is very dis
couraging. Starvation and misery await
miners who are forced into the interior.
Although provisions are not scarce, prices
are high. The season is a terribly cold
one, and hundreds of miners are preparing
ito return. At Cooks Inlet the water is
free of ice, but in the small bays and arms
the ice is thick. Turnagain Arm and the
upper inlet are frozen in, and the miners
at the former place are reported to be suf
fering greatly from the rigor of the cli
mate and have not secured enough gold to
pay for a second-class ticket from Sitka to
Seattle.
At the present time there are from 300
to 400 penniless men in Juneau. When a
vessel departs for the north scores of these
unfortunates congregate on the wharf
begging for deadhead passage. The Cooks
Inlet region is being discarded by experi
enced miners, but the district is literally
swarming with prospectors. Very few
men have so far succeeded in crossing the
pass into the Yukon fields owing to the
severe weather. Three hundred miners,
bound for the Yukon, are snowed in at
the base of the divide between Cooks In
let and the Yukon.
Within the next few weeks it is ex
pected that several other parties who
have gone north for their health will re
turn improved in physique, but not finan
cially.
GIVEN A HEARTY WELCOME
Alameda County Endeavorers
Honor National Treasurer
William Shaw.
Shown Points of Interest About the
City and Tendered a Rousing
Reception.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cam, )
908 Broadway, April 18. \
The Christian Endeavorers of Alameda
County turned ont in large numbers to
night to pay their respects to William
Shaw, the world-wide known and honored
treasurer of the United Society from
Boston. He arrived in the city this
morning at 10:14 direct from Oregon, and
was met by County President S. W. Con
den and A. R. Waters, who conducted him
to the residence of J. T. Gardiner, 524
Jones street, where he was allowed to rest.
After lunch he was driven about the city
by William N. Gardiner and shown the
various points of interest. He expressed
the greatest admiration for the floral dis
play in the residence districts.and expressed
a desire to tafce cuttings of the roses home
with him. He was entertained at dinner,
together with a few of the prominent
Endeavorers, by C. F. Baker, after which
he attended the reception.
County President Seymor W. Conden
presided at the mass-meeting, and Rev.
Mr. Campbell made the address of wel
come. Mr. Shaw, who has a very pleasing
personality, was greeted with the Chautau
qua saiute as he arose to speak. He ac
knowledged the warm greetings extended
him, and told of his trip across the con
tinent, up into British Columbia and then
down the coast, and of the delightful meet
ings held along the line. Ke referred to
the great gathering to be held in Washing
ton in July, and expressed the hope that
all would go well that the Endeavorer* of
the world could corns to California in 1897.
His reference to "California in '97" was
greeted with an outburst of enthusiasm
that showed the desire of the Endeavorers
of this county who have once been disap
pointed. At the close of his remarks an
informal reception was held, and hundreds
met and shook his hands.
In many countries in Europe boring the
ears is believed to be a sovereign cure for
sore eyes.
WHO DID THE COURTING?
Fred Stuart Adams' Wife Denies
She Beguiled Him to
Wedlock.
A VERY KNOWING YOUNG MAN
The Youthful Bridegroom Declared to
Have a Liberal Education in
Worldly Ways.
"Mrs. N. Day, otherwise known as Nlta
Potter, still otherwise known as J. Isabella
Potter, and now calling herself Mrs. Fred
Stuart Adams," filed an answer with the
County Clerk of Alameda County yester
day to the suit brought for annulment of
marriage by James C. Adams for Fred
Stuart Adams, a minor. The answer is a
decidedly aggressive document. The de
fendant, by her attorneys, A. Heynemann
ana A. A. Moore, has not hesitated in
making denials as sweeping as were the
charges in the complaint and in capping
the whole with specific counter charges of
marital inconstancy on the part of the
plaintiff, Fred Stuart Adams.
Tne defendant finds cause for denial in
the very outset of the complaint. She
says she never has been known as Mrs. N.
Day. J. Isabelle Potter she declares is her
maiden name and "Nita" is a pet name
given her by her family. The only evi
dence she claims to have of the majority
of the plaintiff is that she heard him
make oath to the statement that he was 21
years of age on or before July 30, 1895.
On that date the parties to this action mar
ried in Contra Costa County. Whether
this was with the consent of Fred's grand
mother or any of his brothers Nita does
not pretend to know, nor does she know
whether these parties then had control of
her bethrothed's person. She does know,
however, that there was no fraud on her
part in the transaction.
Mrs. Adams does not put much faith in
her husband's physical and mental
weakness. The allegations of the com
plaint that Fred had, when about 12 years
of age, received an injury which resulted
in his being much confined and in retard
ing his physical and mental growth, she
emphatically denies. She admits that he
was prevented from attending school for
a few months, but declares that he has at
tended various schools and colleges in
California, and is more than ordinarily in
telligent; is fully alive to all the affaire of
life ; is ordinarily well educated, and has
enjoyed experiences far beyond the ordi
nary experiences of any young man his
own age not possessed of wealth and
means to thoroughly satisfy and cater to
all his wants and wishes without restraint.
In the matter of experience the plaintiff
is throughout credited with being particu
larly well blessed, though the complaint
alleged he was simple as a child. In this
regard the defendant alleges the plaintiff
"has had the experience of men double his
age and has run the gantlet and knows all
the ills and vices that flesh is heir to, and
has had all the experiences of life, not
only common to young men of his age,
but common to young men of this age."
If he hasn't found any occupation she
says it is because he didn't want any.
There is also a serious difference of opin
ion as to which of the twain commenced
and prosecuted the courtship. The plain
tiff asserted that the fair one had taken
the aggressive from the start. She had
sought an introduction, had followed him
op persistently and had urged him to wed.
Her persistence conquered and he suc
cumbed.
The defendant's story is remarkably
similar, with the leading characters trans
posed. He it was who was persistent and
she was coy. But he conquered. Their
statements also clash painfully in regard
to the wine suppers. He claimed she ad
vocated this form of entertainment. This
she indignantly denies and says it was at
the plaintiff's suggestion that they had
wine, and she continuously urged him not
to drink so much, as it would make him ill.
Nita says if Fred didn't know all about
her past it was his own fault. She re
peatedly tried to tell him her history, but
he refused to listen, insisting that he
wanted only her and aid't care anything
about her previous misfortunes.
Her alleged story of an unfortunate
marriage with Charles Day, or Clarence
Day, she declares an airy fabric of the
Adams imagination. As a matter of fact,
she says Adams was the first and only
man to whom she had ever Deen married.
The statement is also styled as false that
she had to pay all the expenses of buggy
rides and wine dinners. She says that the
plaintiff often had money to pay for their
excursions. She admits plaintiff some
times pawned her jewelry and clothing to
raise the "needful, but this, she declares,
was at his importunity, and not at her
suggestion. He always promised to pay
the next day.
The circumstances of their visit to Mar
tinez and their subsequent marriage there
are related. Here they lived together as
man and wife after the ceremony, it is al
leged, as well as at numerous hotels r.t San
Francisco. It was while at the latter that
they visited the questionable resorts of
which Adams alleged previous ignorance.
His wife says she was the one who was un
sophisticated, and Adams seemed remark
ably well acquainted with the surround
ings and attendants.
While they were thus enjoying them
selves Fred left their room at one of the
hotels, saying he would return in a few
minutes. He neglected his engagement
and has not returned yet.
The allegations of the defendant's previ
ous immorality cause her to wax indig
nant. After denying specifically the
charges of proflicacy she declares the alle
gations in the complaint are "outrageous,
scandalous, conceived by the plaintiff,
born of his imagination, and simply placed
in the said complaint for the wanton pur
pose of needlessly harassing the said de
fendant."
There is a cross-complaint attached to
the answer, and in this Fred Stuart
Adams is charged with having on three
specific occasions violated his marital ob
ligations. On one occasion he is charged
with having lived openly and notoriously
with a woman whose name is unknown.
A decree of divorce is asked, and that the
plaintiff be compelled to pay a sum into
court for the expenses and counsel fee of
this action. Permanent alimony is also
asked for. The attorney for the defend
ant will, next Monday, ask that the plain
tiff be compelled to pay $5000 into court.
A vigorous oppositi on is looked for.
HOME INDUSTRY FAIR.
Manufacturers' Association and Mechan
ics' Institute to Discuss Plans.
There is every reason to believe that
San Francisco will have a home indagtry
fair this year. Several months ago the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion endeavored to secure the Mechanics'
Pavilion for that purpose, but the trustees
of the institute declared that the times
would not wariant holding two large fairs
in one year and they had better look out
for the interests of the Mechanics' Insti
tute annual fair first. This decision caused
the Manufacturers' Association to discuss
the advisability of erecting another large
pavilion and holding a fair of its own.
Since the recent election in the institute
new members have been seated in the
board of trustees who do not seem to be so
antagonistic to the association as the old
board. Now efforts are beine made to
make arrangements to hold a joint fair of
the two organizations and a stnctlv home
product fair is contemplated. With a
view of reaching this end the association
has appointed as a committee J. W. Kerr,
A. Sbarboro, L. R. Mead and S. Tracy,
who will confer with a committee from
the institute composed of G. Howard,
Oscar Lewis and George R. Presson. These
conference committees will meet to-mor
row, Monday, at 4 o'clock and discuss
terms on which a home industry fair can
be arranged. While the Manufacturers'
Association is willing that the institute
shall make all it can out of the fair it will
insist that all of the goods exhibited must
be of California manufacture. Many mem
bers of the association state that they are
prepared to make very extensive exhibits
if the proposed fair is to be of strictly
home products.
MISSION CLUBS UNITE
The Improvement Union Organ
ized, With J. D. Phelan
as President.
The Railroad Company to Commence
en Folsom Street Monday
Morning. >
A central and permanent improvement
organization of the Eleventh Ward, other
wise known as the Mission District, has
been established. Through this organiza
tion the wants of the entire district will
hereafter be attended to. It will be known
as the Mission Improvement Union, and
into which the various sectional clubs
heretofore existing will be merged or their
representatives accepted.
This central union will look after the
interests of any and every portion of the
Eleventh Ward when its attention is
drawn to the necessities of the location
and the wants of its residents.
With this system a proper representa
tion can be made to the Supervisors and
other co-ordinate municipal bodies for
what is desired. This plan, nt is thought,
will give greater weight and influence to
the movement than is usual where a few
isolated citizens appear from an outside
section asking for something of merely
local benefit.
With a central union, backed by half
of the City's population, and two-thirds of
its area, governing bodies will, it is ex
pected, be loth to refuse to accede to what
may be a legitimate and fair claim of its
people.
Sectional clubs in outside territory, like
Ocean View and South San Francisco,
may, if desirable, consolidate with or send
delegates to this improvement union.
A meeting of the executive committee of
the Mission Improvement Union was held
at the office of J. D. Phelan, on Market
street, a few days ago, at which were pres
ent James D. Phelan, John Bolger, J. H.
Grady, Daniel Kelly, George Walcom,
George L. Center, F. W. Van JReynegom,
j. K. S. Hobbs, William Metzner, A. P.
Van Duzer, A. B. Maguire and John A.
Lennon.
An organization was effected at the
meeting Dy the election of James D. Phelan,
president; F. W. Van Reynegom, vice
president; George Walcom, secretary and
treasurer.
On motion of Judge Van Reynegom, the
following committee was appointed to
make investigations and report upon the
matter of procuring the two Jewish Ceme
tery blocks at the Mission for a public
park and to ascertain the feasibility of
making Dolores street a boulevard : J. K.
S. Hobbs, John D. Daly, Goorge Walcom,
D. A. Hulse, Daniel Kelly, John H. Grady
and F. W. Van Reynegom.
A committee to "take charge of the mat
ter of procuring a High School at the Mis
sion and to ascertain and report upon the
necessary procedure therefor was ap
pointed, consisting of George L. Center, A.
B. Maguire, William Metzner, A. P. Van
Dnzer, John A. Lenuon, John Bolger and
John H. Grady.
These committees were instructed to
make their reports in writing at the next
meeting of the executive committee to be
held on the Ist day of next month.
It was resolved that the regular meet
ings of the executive committee be held
on the first and third Fridays of each
month at 4:30 p. m. at the office of James
D. Phelan in the Phelan building. Also
that the president may call a special meet
ing of the committee whenever he shall
deem it necessary or expedient.
A sub-committee on the Mission High
School was afterward organized for work
by choosing John H. Grady chairman with
power to ado. thereto sucn members of the
union as he might deem proper.
The merit of Dolores street as a boule
vard was discussed. It was stated that
the street has a width of 120 feet between
curbs, with a width of twenty-one feet for
sidewalks.
It was suggested to reduce the side
walks to fifteen feet, which would be the
same as those of Montgomery street, and
add what is taken off to the width of the
street. This would afford a ten-foot strip

in the center of the street on which shade
trees could be planted, leaving forty feet

The question of grade was discussed,
but it was ascertained from Judge Van
Reyneuom that the highest point, which
is at Twenty-first street, is only a 12 per
cent gradeâ none too steep, it was claimed,
for the purposes of a pleasure drive.
It was also stated that inasmuch as this
street is not yet paved the expense will
fall on the abutting property-owners and
not on the taxpayers in general. Its ad
vantages to the residents of the Mission, it
was stated, would be incalculable as a
means of reaching Golden Gate Par* or
the Western Addition, as it leads from
Thirtieth street to Market in a straight
line.
The Improvement Union will take steps
at no distant day to ask the Supervisors to
establish a police station somewhere in the
vicinity of the Mission road. The people
of that section with those of Sunnyside
and Fairmount demand a station and, as
some of the residents in Fairmount claim,
a fire engine also.
The Folsom-street boulevard is about to
be pushed to completion at once. Super
intendent H. H. Lynch of the construction
department of the Market-street Railroad
system will put a gang of men to work to
morrow morning to lay the track for the
electric line. He expects to have the work
finished inside of thirty days. Conse
quently by the first of June the cars will be
humming along the new boulevard from
the bay to Twenty-ninth street.
The Supervisors have given A. B.
Maguire, the chairman of tbis boulevard,
reason to hope that the entire street will
be fixed from end to end, thus making it
a continuous ooulevard.
The Noe Defense Club being organized
for a separate object, will not consolidate
with the union, but its members will co
operate in everything that appertains to

IS HOME FROM SWEDEN
C. 0. Swanberg Returns After
an Absence of Two
Years.
PACIFIC BANK SECURITIES.
He Says Sweden Is Wonderfully
Prosperous and He Attributes It
All to Protection.
C. 0. Swanberg, who has been for two
years in Sweden, has returned here and is
C. O. Swanberg, Who Has Returned Here After Two Years In Sweden.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" staff artist.]
at the Palace. Yesterday he was at his
old place on Pine street meeting friends.
It will be remembered that Mr. Swanberg
left at the time of the Pacific Bank and Peo
ple's Bank failures. He had some time
previously borrowed $40,000 of the Pacific
Bank, which account was transferred to
the People's Bank before he left. There
was a clamor that there was something un
fair about it. Mr. Swanberg's partner
telegraphed him at Ogden telling him of
the furore that had been raised in connec
tion with the arrest of Dick McDonald.
Mr. Swanberg at once came back and gave
his explanation of the matter. He also
went on the bail of several of the directors
for $50,000.
"I have no doubt they would have been
in jail, and stayed there all this time, like
Dick McDonald, if I hadn't come to their
rescue," said Mr. Swanberg. "1 doubt if
even Charles Montgomery could have kept
onu It was the most senseless thing in
the world, starting in to prosecute those
men. One of them was only in office three
days. I reckon he couldn't have gotten
away with much. It just shows to what
billy lengths public sentiment some times
goes. And, as it is, lam glad McDonald
is out of jail."
Then Mr. Swanberg, who is looking well
and in excellent health, told of his pleas
ant trip and long stay in Sweden, the laud
of his birth. For a number of years he
has owned a large farm near Kalmar, in
the south of Sweden. During his absence
he purchased another farm, till now he has
over 6000 acres. On this he has erected
magnificent houses and barns.
Some of the land he is cutting up into
lots of from an acre up, and selling to
workingmen, who are given twenty years'
time at 8 per cent interest, the interest
paying for the property in full by the end
of the twenty years. This is with the idea
of giving the laboring men comfortable
homes.
Mr. Swanberg says Sweden is in a re
markably prosperous condition, and he at
tributes it all to protection. Everybody
has money, and there is a thrift and con
fidence all over Sweden and Norway that
is very pleasant to see.
"For the last seven years Sweden has
had protection," he said, "and such pros
perity never was known there. Before
that for ten years there was free trade, and
the country went all to pieces. There was
no money. Times were hard all over that
country. As soon as it got protection it
began to improve, ana it has continued
prosperous for the seven years, as it is now.
"The farmers are prosperous. You
wouldn't think it if you didn't know, but
it is so. I wish the farmers of this country
had anything like the protection farmers
have in Sweden. They would have a lot
more money than they now have, and so i
would everybody in California and every
other State.
"There is a duty there on grainâ that is,
on wheat, rye and barleyâ of $10 â¢ ton.
Oats is free. They don't raise much oats.
Think of it, $10 a ton as a duty ! The
farmers are making money.
"Then take sugar. Only a few years ago
Sweden was getting all her sugar abroad.
Enormous sums were being sent away
annually. Swedish farmers went to work
to plant sugar-beets, and a duty of $32 40
was placed on all imported sugar. Now
Sweden produces all the sugar she con
consumes and sends a lot abroad. For
merly millions of dollars used to go out
for susar. This is all kept at home now.
Sugar-beets do not impoverish the soi!,
therefore under the circumstances they
are an excellent thing for Sweden to pro
duce.
"For the ten years that the country had
free trade it went in debt about $5,000,000
a year, or about $1 per capita, as there
are about 5,000,000 people in Sweden.
"To-day, if you go through the country
you see the lands well tilled, the fence 3 all
up and in excellent repair, the houses and
barns, which are always ample and com
fortable, neatly painted, and more than
thig, you will lind the people happy. I
can't attribute the change to anything but
protection.
"On my own farm in Sweden I am grow
ing grain, and clover and timothy and
other kinds of grasses. I run adairy, mak
ing butter, which always sells at a good
profit. Butter-making" for all Swedish
farmers is a great industry. They sell it
to the English market, and the average
net profit last year was 22 cents a pound
on the farm. "This was the net profit,
mark you, and right a home, too.
"The reign of Kin;; Oscar is, in these lat
ter days, highly prosperous. There is one
government over Sweden and Norway, but
each country yet maintains Ms separate
money. There ought to be one money
system for both. They didn't seem to be- 1
lieve in Sweden that Dr. Nansen had
found the north pole.
â¢'I saw Dr. Andree, who is going to set
out for the poie in a balloon. I saw a man
at a railway station. I didn't know who
he was. I had uo idea, but he was so i
courageous and so distinguished looking
tnat lat once asked he was. I was
told hÂ» ras Dr. .indree, the famous bal
loonist. I knew he was a great man the
instant I looked at him. I think he has
the right idea, that the real way to reach
the pole is by balloon."
Mr. Swanberg reached here in exactly
thirteen days. Formerly it took him
nearly a month of steady traveling, but
now the trains and boats go so fast that
the trip is made merely a comfortable and
pleasant excursion.
He says Sweden is building railroad,
telegrapb and telephone lines everywhere.
Every farmer who has 100 acres has a
long-distance telephone. It Is the most
magnificent telephone system in the world
and is very cheap. Not two inches of
snow fell during the entire winter. They
got pight inches of ice twice. The ice is
used for cooling the milk and butter.
Han't Release From Matter.

Society at National Hall. Ellis street, upon

A Proposition to Change the Time and
Place of Meeting of the Grand
Body â The Representatives.
Next Tuesday the Grand Lodge of Cali
fornia Knights and Ladies of Honor will
meet in annual session in the Alcazar
building. The session will probably last
two days. The order has twenty-one
lodges in the State and has for its head at
this time F. Kemp Van Ec, who holds the
office of grand protector. The lodges are
located in this City, San Jose, Oakland,
Alameda, Berkeley, Healdsburg, Sonora,
Sacramento, Marysville and Los Angeles.
During the year which is drawing to a
close there has been an increase in the
number of applications for the benefits of
the relief fund, but the social membership
is about the same as it was at the begin
ning of the year. Dunne the Grand
Lodge session an attempt will be made to
have that body meet but once in two
years instead of annually, as at present.
An effort will also be made to have the
meetings of that body held outside of San
Francisco, as has been done in the past.

NEWS OF THE CHURCHES
Rev. R. M. Campbell Has Ac
cepted a Call to Glasgow,
Kentucky.
RUSSIANS HONOR A BISHOP.
Two Pacific Coast Religious Papers
May Bs Unitedâ A Historic
Church.
The First Christian Church is to lose its
pastor, Rev. R. M. Campbell, who came
here only a few months ago from Ken
lucky. Mr. Campbell is the grandson of
the founder of that denomination and has,
therefore, bad a historic distinction in ad
dition to his own personal popularity.
The First Church had been without a
pastor for some time previous to Mr.
Campbell's advent and had run down con
siderably as to membership. During his
brief pastorate he has succeeded in arous
ing considerable interest in the services
and has had a number of additions to his
flock. The resignation has been tendered
in consequence of a call to the First Chris
tian Church of Glasgow, Ky. Rev. R. M.
Campbell will continue to preach at his
church here till the end of the present
month.
The coming event in Episcopalian
church circles is the annual Diocesan Con
vention, which will open in Grace church
on the sth of next month. The Brother
hood of St. Andrew will also bold a con
ference here. in May, though the date and
place of meeting have yet to be announced.
A good deal of interest lias been aroused
in Episcopalian church circles by tne Pa
cific Churchman's correspondence from St.
Petersburg, giving particulars of Bishop
Wilkinson's visit to the Russian capital.
According to the local Episcopalian
organ, "the Bisnop for North and Central
Europe's triennial visitation of the St.
Petersburg chaplaincy was made the oc
casion of a remarkable demonstration of
friendliness on the part of the Orthodox
church of Russia. He was received by the
Metropolitan of St. Petersburg with much
ceremony at his palace on Friday, Febru
ary 28, and, attended by two AYchiman
drites, was conducted to the tomb of
Alexander Nevski, in the monastic church
built by Catherine 11, in the great Nevski
Monastery. On Saturday, at the invita
tion of the Metropolitan, the Bishop at
tended the opening of the Theological
Academy, and, with the Metropolitan of
St. Petersburg, tie Archbishops of Fin
land and Odessa, the Bishops of Novgorod
and of the academy, the Dean of St.
Isaac's Cathedral and other high digni
taries, was present throughout the pro
ceedings.
"At the confirmation, held in the Eng
lish church on the Sunday when 130 can
didates were presented, "the Dean of St.
Isaac's Cathedral was present in his robes.
The oldest residents in St. Petersburg say
they never remember such a remarkable
demonstration of brotherly ieeling to
wards the Anglican church on the part of
the hierarchy of the Onhodox church of
vKussia, and many were the expressions of
earnest desire for unity, on all sides, be
tween the two churches."
Metnodists are a good deal interested
just at present in the proposed union of
1 the Oregon Advocate with the California
| Advocate. Many people contend that if
I the two papers were united and were pub
lished in this City, Pacilic Coast members
of the M. E. church would have one strong
organ. Resident-* ai the Portland end,
however, appear to object to the proposed'
| change ana it is probable nothing dennite
will be decided tiJl the next conference.
Rev. E. P. Deiupsey has returned to St.
Mary's Cathedral fully recovered from his
recent illness. Rev. Joseph Conway, who
| was attached to the Cathedral during
Father Dempsey's illness, has been trans
ferred to San Rafael.
Three altars in St. Boniface's Church
have been renovated and artisticaly painted
by the artist who completed the shrine of
St. Joseph in the same church.
The historic old church of San Francisco
in the City of Mexico, after having been
I lost to Catholics for years, is once again the
scene of Catholic sacrifice.
Rabbi A. Blum of Los Angeles, well
known for his translation of Leroy-Beau
lieu's work on the Jewish question and for
his account of Cremieux, has left the rab
binical ranks. He has been chosen super
intendent of the Lebanon Hospital in New
York, and his wife has been given charge
of the housekeeping and culinary depart
ment. This hospital, which is non-secta
rian in its benefactions, was started be
cause that model institution, the Mount
Sinai Hospital, jouml itself unable to meet
the needs of the many newcomers of re
cent years. '
Carelesn in Money Blatters.
Perhaps the gravest defect in the char
acter of Corwin was carelessness in money
matters. If this were a grievous fault,
grievously did he answer it. His life was
almost a constant struggle with financial
embarrassments. It was the generosity of
his nature which led him to spend money
too freely, and to become security for an
embarrassed friend when he was unable to
pay his own debts. During much if not
most of his life he was oppressed with the
heavy burden of debt. The same mail
which brought letters offering assistance
to nominate him lor the Presidency brought
others from clamorous creditors, to which
he had not the heart to reply. "I won
der," he is reported to have said, "if any
other man ever hid from the Constable to
read letters proposing him for the Presi
dency?" His intimate friend, Dunlevy,
wrote of him in 1840: "Mr. Corwin is in
moderate circum stances. Had he been a
money-making man he might have been
independently rich. His practice at the
bar has been extensive, and he held on to
it with remarkable tenacity all through
his public career, but be was careless of
collecting fees, and his pursestrings were
always too loosely held to retain what he
did realize."â From "Life and Speeches of
Thomas Corwin.' 1
TWO FARMERS ROBBED.
They Visited the Dive* on the Barbary
Coast Last Friday
: '-'.Night. '.' 'â ':â  .â â¢;â ;
Felix Bush, a farmer from ; Vancouver,
swore out a warrant in i Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday morning for the
arrest of Hannah Sandwich on the charge
of grand larceny.
He told Warrant Clerk Graham that he
recently sold \ his farm for $1800 and came
here a few days ago on his way to South
America, where he intended to settle. On
1-riday night he visited some of the dives
on the . Barbary. Coast and became ac
quaintea with a woman who said her
name was Hannah Sandwich. They had
several drinks together, and I finally when
Bush left her, his purse, which, to the best
of his recollection, contained $390, was

RESPITE FOR SHIPPERS
The New Freight Rates May
Not Become Operative for
Three Weeks.
Delay Caused in Getting Out the
Prinhd Schedulesâ All West
bound Rates Advanced.
From the outlook at present there is no
possibility of the new transcontinental
freight rates going into effect by the Ist of
May, as was rirst announced by the rail
road people, and there is a probability
that it will be the middle of May before
the important change is made. The delay
is due to the failure to get the new
schedules printed in time. This matter is
in the hands of the chairman of the trans
continental freight rate committee at Chi
cago, wuo sends to each road the number
of printed rate sheets requin d.
Only an advance copy of the new rates
has been received by the Southern Pacific
Company, and this is the old schedule cor
rected with marginal figures. The entire
force of twenty-two clerk? in the freight
department at Montgomery and Market
streets is at work making additional copies,
to be sent to all asents of the company at
terminal pointsâ not for use. but for "the
information of shippers who may wish to
know particular rates.
The lull schedule will not be made
public till the printed conies are received.
The task that the freight department
clerks have assigned is a heavy one, as the
commodity schedule comprises more than
1800 items, and the westbound rates show
a change in every article. The advance
ranges irom f> cents to <59 cents per 100
pounds, or from $1 to a ton.
It is not known justwnen the printed
schedules will be received, but they are
not expected for some little tine, and a3
it requires ten days' notice to the public
before new rates become operative it is
the opinion of railroad men that the new
month will be well advanced before the
higher charges prevail. This news has
caused much eralification to many mer
chants who have Inree orders preparing
for shipment in the East.

A STARTLING LONG SHOT
Duchess of Milpitas Won the
Follansbee Stake at Odds
of 60 to 1.
RIDDEN BY TOMMY BUTLER.
But One Favorite Finished in Front.
Esperance With Clancy Up Took
the Steeplechase.
The sensational feature of the racing at
the Bay District yesterday was the capture
of the $1500 Follansbee stake by the rank
outsider, Duchess of Milpitas. The dis
tance was one ana a half miles, and the
mare had a big pull in the weights, the
bandicapper letting her in at 80 pounds.
In the opening betting the bookmakers
chalked up 60 to 1 against her, which price
was gradually forced down to 30 to 1 by a
rambling sort of play. Lovdal, carrying
110 pounds, opened up an even money
choice, but he showed unmistakable signs
of lameness in his preliminary gallop, and
at post time 9 to 5 was obtainable. Un
doubtedly the most consistent play was on
Articus, with 90 pounds in the saddle. C.
Slaughter had the mount, and a world of
coin went into the book? on the once
crack colt at odds of 3 to 1. notwithstand
ing which the books laid 17 to 5 when the
horses were called out. Flirtilla, Service,
Pepper, Little Bob and Uncle Giles also
came in for slight consideration.
The barrier sent the horses away to a
good start. Slaughter at once went to the
front with Articus, passing the stand the
first time half a length before Pepper,
closely followed by Uncle Giles, Duchess
of Milpitas, Lovdal anil tiirtilla. There
was no material change in the order of
positions until at the end of the mile,
covered in 1 :43, when Slaughter appar
ently eased up on Articus amfl was passed
by Pepper and the Duchess of Milpitas.
At the far turn Butler shook the Duchess
up and she assumed first position, turning
into the stretch for home with a lead of
two lengths, followed by Uncle Giles and
Pepper. At this stage Articus was fifth.
Duchess of Milpkas maintained her lead
to the end, pass-ing the wire a length in
advance of Articus, who tinished with a
fine showing of speed. Uncle Giles was a
good third. The time, 2:36%, clips a
quarter of a second off the coast record.
The usual Saturday crowd turned out,
and the bookmakers reaped a harvest,
some very warm choices being tumbled !
over. Mount McGregor at 13 to 10 was the I
only wiiining favorite during the after- \
noon.
The track was in better condition than
at any time since the meeting opened, and
1 fast time was made in the different events.
; Jockey Joe Piegott was in good â form, â â 
; bringing in three winners.
There was very- little olass about the !
\ twelve starters that lined up in the open- i
i ing fiveani a half furlong scramble, and j
I there was no pronounced favojite in the !
; betting. My Sweetheart, on the strength
of a previ&ns good run. had a slight call :
; over Big Chief and Yreka, who v. ere both '
â¢ held at fours. At the cmi IJig Chief won :
easily, with Ginger finishing in the place.
The nice following was a second edition
of 'he opening event, with twelve going to
! the post. Frank Phillips' good filiy Mar- j
I jorie was backed from threes down to 8 to i
! 5, and although plainly the best horse in
j tie race, was beafeti through poor riding
;on the part of !Si McCluin. Jim Bozeman |
made all of the ru'ihine, but was beaten j
out at the end by Daylight, with Pi^jiOtt ,
j up, backed down from 15 to Bto 1. Mar- j
jorie who was interfered with shortly after
the start, falling bÂ«ck to the rear and then
being rushed into second place inside of
three furlongs, was a close third.
The third event on the card, a mile dasb,
decided under selling conditions, saw
Rosebud go to the po3t a warm 4 to 5
favorite. She could never head the 2lÂ£ to
I second cboice, Chartreuse 11, ana was
beaten out easily by two lengths. Scim
itar finished in the show.
The steeplechase resulted in another
disastrous dump for tne talent. Col.
Weightman was made an 8 to 5 choice,
but coula finish no better than third. Es
perance, ridden by Clancy, and a 4 to 1
shot in the betting, took the lead in the
stretch and won easily. with Arundel fin
ishing in the place. Hello fell at the last
jump. Cochran luckily escaDed with a
severe shaking up.
A favorite finally won. With 13 to 10
about him in the betting Mount McGregor
II led all the way in the six-furlong spin
that was sixth on the card, passing the
judges a length and a half before Major
Cook. The second choice, George Miller,
who had been running in second position,
was beaten out for the place the last
jump.
One of the biggest plunges of Jhe day
was made on Montgomery to win the last
event of the day, a five and a half furlong
selling dash. Opening at 2}4 to 1, the odds
against the chestnut were hammered down
to even money. Like Marjorie he was un
fortunate in being cut oft" shortly after tne
start, and wound up in tnird place.
Heartsease, a 7 to 1 shot, led all the way,
and in a drive beat Marble Rock out a
length and a half.
Mixed Mythology.
The unmusical manager who protested
when he found a performer in his orches
tra holding his bow duriug a rest, saying
to him, "I don't pay you to rest,"' was
superintending the arrangement of some
performer* who were representing allegor
ical characters.
"Here in front," said the author of the
piece which was to be given, "we will put
the nine muses."
"Nine muses!" exclaimed the manager
contemptuously. "Nine muses would look
well in that jjreat space, wouldn't they?
We will have thirty-six muses."âBloom

the Tariff.
SOME CLEAK-CUT IDEAS.
To Fight Great Evils Ministers
Must Understand Their
Origin.
ARE FAR BEHIND THE TIMES
The Tariff Said to B3 at the Basis
of Much Immorality and
a Crime.
Oakland Office Sau Fbaxcibco Call.i
908 Broadway, April 18. j
Rev Barton W. Perry, pastor of the San
Leandro Presbyterian church, has become
â¢ convinced that a successful minister must
understand the philosophy of social ques
tions and political economy, as well as
the fundamental principles of religion.
â¢ He has made an apparent success of his
â¢ ministry, but he has decided that, with a
closer knowledge of humanity than he
. can possibly obtain within the confines of
' a clergyman's position, he can better min
ister to the needs of his flock.
"It is impossible for any one to Dut to a
practical use the tenets of the Christian
belief unless he has a broad education,"
said Rev. B. W. Perry to-day. "It has
long been my desire to make a trip
through tne East and Europe and see for
â myself where our religion fails. It must
be conceded that, outside of a somewhat
limited field, modern religion is a failure.
1 I believe the reason for this is that the
ministers are not sufficiently advanced in
. the great questions of the day, and are
lulling themselves into a false security
that they are, when they are not.
"I have found that we must keep re
ligion as much up to date an anything
elÂ»e that is presented to the ever-increas
, ing intelligence of tbe public. lam going
to Europe in a few weeks for the purpose
of thoroughly familiarizing myself with
the social conditions of the people and
contrasting them with those of this coun
try. In my opinion the question of tariff
lies at the root of much of the evil that
we 'complain of to-day. A falsely ad
justed tariff admits goods here made at
prices tnat no free labor can equal. This
in turn throws our own people out of
work, and with starvation staring them in
the face many of our young men are
forced to commit crime and many of our
young women are driven to lives of shame.
' To be able to offset the progress of crime
and immorality we must know what we
are talking about.
"I regard it as part of a minister's duty
to understand the tariff question, and if
necessary to be able to instruct his hearers
on the most Chiistian and humane prin
ciples which should guide those who ar-.
â¢range our tariffs. It is acknowledged that
the tariff repulates the happiness of the
workingmen's homes, and yei the average
minister remains stubbornly in ignorance
of all these matters, falsely thinking that
to take a hand in molding popular opin
ion is to become polluted with 'the world.'
â  "1 am going to Europe to watch these
matters closely. I intend to study the ef
fect" of the tariff on the countries most af
fected and see just what classes are the
mo=t active in producing the current mis
ery in our own country. I shall be gone
several months, and expect to meet with
. many revelations."

ber, Tried Here for Murder.
OAKLAND, Cal., April IS.-John
Schneider, who was sentenced to-day to
. twenty years at San Quentin for stage rob
bery committed near Ukiah December

arrested and held for trial. Garrity was
retained and owing to lack of evidence Mil
ler escaped conviction. Garrity said Miller
was a i.ard character and well armed, but
the weapons escaped the officers as tie had
hid them before the arrest.
Robert H. Davis, an Oakland traveling
man, who was in Ukiah at the time of the
arrest, had a good opportunity to study
Schneider, and on his : return: home he
went to the police station ana took a iook
througn the rogues- gallery, and when
Miller picture was reached he Identified
it at once as Schneider. . Al White took a
patient to the Ukiah asylum," and he also
identified Schneider as Miller.

ALAMEDA PRIMARY POLL
Sad Accident to a San Fran
cisco Lady at Narrow-
Gauge Mole.
Dog-Poisoners at Work Againâ A Man
Announces a Large Robbery.
Two Runaways.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 19.â A good
deal of quiet interest was manifested in
the regular Republican open primary this
afternoon. In spite of the chilly weather
small groups were to be seen outside each
polling booth discussing and advising. At
4 o'clock the united vote cast was stated to
be in the neighborhood of 130. Every
thing was conducted in a quiet, orderly,
regular manner, and when the polls closed
numbers waited around to hear the linal
results. These Jwere given out aa follows:
Georee Baboocfc 455. Thomas White 453, F.
E. Jenkins 450, 1. P. Clark 448, W. B. Hodges
454, E. A. yon bchmidt 446. C. W. Petry 449,
C. J. Hammond 450, W. P. Davis 457, Alex
ander Hay 453, Elmer E. Johnson 454, X. C.
Larson 451, J. R. Sloane 452, W. S. Risiev 451
John Lubben 455, J. R. Walker 451. T. W". Ley
det.ker 446, W. B. Higby 450, Ed Houston 455 ;
voters 459, scattering 26.
They are, therefore, the delegates se
lected. The votes polled show over one
third of the total polled in the city for M.
M. Estee last State election, and the "Reg
ulars" say they are more than satisfied at
the resuit. It is claimed that if more time
had elapsed between tne nominations and
polling day double the number of votes
would have been recorded. The name of
Elmer Johnson was substituted for that
of E. B. Dunning since the night of nomi
nation.
The People's party also held a primary
from 4 to 8 p. m. in Linderman Opera
house, but the votes polled were so few
that the following selection of names was
decided on : Precinct 1, Sydney V. Mitch
ell; 2, L. F. Robinson; 3, J. W." Rew; 4, J. j
G. Hurley; 5, Green Majors; 6, W. Davis;
7, G. R. Read; 8, Rev. S. A. Taft; 9, Wil
liam B. Ryder, L. 8. Orcutt.
Accident to Sirs. Cook.
A sad accident occurred at the Alameda
mole this morning. Mrs. Elizabeth Cook,
living at 612 Grove street, San Francisco, en
route to Los Gatos, was just boarding the
narrow-gauge train and had reached the
platform of one ofjthe cars, when she had an
epileptic seizure. This caused her to fall on
to the wharf and track. When picked up
she was unconscious and had an'ugly gap
ine wound in her forehead. She was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, Oakland,
and is said to be suffering from concussion
of the brain.
Pyrotechnic Combination.
A surplus of coal oil about a heating
stove, a lighted match dropped carelessly
and a young woman, caused the chemical
engine to visit the residence of Mrs. Laura
Newton, on the corner of Broadway and
Clement street, about 9 o'clock last night.
Its services were not required, however,
as the blaze had been quenched. The
damage done was nominal and covered by
insurance.
XewÂ» >~otes.
The ownership of the $500 Great Dane
dog is still unsettled. W. Ziugg told one
tale and A. Schreiber another in Justice
Morris' court to-day. Hence the charge of
grand larceny preferred against Schrieber
ha 3 been taken under advisement.
The dog-poisoner has once more re
turned to his vocation, and as usual con
fines his attentions to the valuable and
high-class animals. Dr. Tom Carpenter
lost his pet Dalmatian pointer Leo, that
cost him $100, yesterday afternoon, and
Charles S. Neal, Policeman Jesse Rogers,
Richard Halinan and George Blanchard
have each experienced the result of such
dastardly work.
Tbe police station, which is unusually
quiet just now, had a strange visitor this
morning in the person of F. S. Koeppele.
He had been robbed of 250 chickens, ,'>oo
ducks, 24 pigeone and $250. The robbers
numbered five and had wagons to haul
away tue plunder. At least that is what
Koeppele believed and said. Later on in
the day he was arrested on the informa
tion of his wife as being a lunatic and
locked up pending an examination.

the Field Day â Dr. Mackenzie
to Preach.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 18.â Among
those who sailed for the Alaskan seas a
few days ago on the Revenue cutter Rush
was Dr. H. N. Kierulff, who has just been
appointed surgeon of the Bering Sea fleet
by the Secretary of the Treasury. Dr.
Kierulff i 3 the oldest son of At
torney I. N, Kierulff of Berkeley.
He was graduated from the medi
cal department of the lowa State Uni
versity several years ago, and since being
admitted to practice has been actively en
gaged in the work of his profession on this
coast. For a year he was surgeon on the
trans-Pacinc steamer City Rio de Janeiro,
plying between San Francisco and China.
The fleet of which Dr. Kierulff has been
appointed surgeon consists.'of the Bear, the
Rush, the Corwin and the Ferry. It is the

purpose of the Government to establish a
United .States marine hospital at Oon
alaska with tte doctor in charge. The hos
pital will be specially constructed for the
use of the fleet".
This will not be Dr. Kierulff s first visit
to the Alaskan territory, he having been a
member of the governmental exploring
1 party of 1889-91, which was sent out to de-
I fine the boundary line between Alaska
and Canada. The company was known as
the Porcupine River Party, and during
their stay in the frigid regions went 2500
miles inland, and spent several weeks in
close proximity to the Arctic Sea.
It was largely through Dr. Kierulffs
knowledge of the Alaskan territory and
his familiarity with the language and the
manners and customs of its people that he
was appointed surgeon of the tieet. Dur
ing the black plague in China the doctor
had an opportunity of visiting the public
hospitals and of administering aid to the
Chinese.
Dr. Kierulff is but 30 years of age, and
though he has been graduated from a rned-
I ical college for but a lew years he has
gained considerable distinction in the med
ical world. Much importance and consid
erable honor are attached to the office to
which the young physician has been ap
pointed.

Tuition Question Again. ,
BERKELEY, Cal., April 18.-It is un
derstood upon good authority that the
question or charging a tuition or "inci
dentals" fee will ,be oronght up again at
the next meeting of the Board of Regents.
During the past year the university has
been running behind to a material extent,
and, as is well known, the budget made,
out last year for. the academic period of
'95- '9G was short by several thousand dol
lars of meeting the actual requirements of
the various departments.
The proposed new tuition fee will be set
at flO per term, and will be expected from
all students registered at the university
according to the report. The fee will te
classed under the head of "incidentals,"
so as to avoid having the appearance of
being a "tuition fee" in its strict Â«ense.
The same objections have been raised
against the proposition as were advanced
last year, . that of the: injustice of asking
tuition for attendance at a State institu
tion. -
Sorosis Reception.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 18.â Uni
versity of California Sorosis gave a recep

CHIEF LLOYD WILL FIGHT
Desperate Efforts to Hold Root
Until the Grand Jury
Meets.
MORE OF THE GOLD BRICK
He Is Biing Held on a Suspicion of
Having Robbed Farmer
Hofstra.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cam,,)
908 Broadway, April 18. j
The arrest of Chief of Police Lloyd at
the instance of the gold brick men has
caused that worthy official to redouble his
efforts to hold Root and send him to San
Quentin. He fully realizes that the men
have been driven to desperate- straits in
their efforts to escape justice, but he does
not intend to lot them accomplish their
purpose if he can avoid or in any way pre
vent it. Said he to-day :
"I am in this fight to the finish and
don't care bow many times the swindlers
cause my arrest. I propose to do what I
consider to be my duty. I believe that my
position requires that I usa my best
efforts to hold this man and he will be
held if it can be done. I will continue to
arrest Root, no matter how many times
be is released, until I can bring him be
fore toe Grand Jury. I think that the
people will justify me in my efforts to
hold these men whom all who have looked
into the matter believe to be some of the
sharpest rogues in this country."
When Root's case was called to-day his
friend, Patsy Carroll, occupied a seat with
him. Patsy has shown a most remark
able fidelity throughout all of the numer
ous court proceedings, always being at
hand. At the request of Root's attorney
"Big Foot" Dave Gordon, alias Mills, alias,
etc., was brought from the County Jail
and occupied a seat near Root.
Farmer Hofstra retold his story all right,
but when he was being cross-questioned he
showed considerable irritation, until
finally he could stand the lawyer's nag
ging no longer and exclaimed: "Why
don't you be sensible? I have told this
thing over fifty times. You pump and
pump and pump on the same thing. I
don't think any court ought to compel a
man to answer these questions. I don't
think it is just or ricrht.
Banker Stephen Little of Dixon was late
in arriving in court, but saved an attach
ment by appearing while Hofstra was on
the stand. He testified as on previous oc- j
casions, but would not be sure Root
claimed to him io be a "United States as
sayer." Here Root's attorney brought up
the question on which he caused Chief
Lloyd's arrest â whether Root assayed the
bricks or borings. Judge Wood ruled
that if a piece had been chipped off the
bricks lie considered that the assaying of
the chips might be called assaying the
bricks, but to this the attorney objected
strongly.
A recess was taken until afternoon to
allow the Prosecuting Attorney to secure
the attendance of an employe of the Mint
regarding appointments. "However, when
the case was resumed he said there was no
record of such appointments but the "blue
book," which he did not believe the court
could accept as evidence, so he could not
ask for a conviction in either case.
Judge Wood accordingly discharged
Root on the two charges. His attorney at
once requested that the prisoner be dis
charged from custody, as there was no
other complaint against him. He called
attention, however, to the fact that Root
waa in jail on suspicion of having stolen
$10,000 from Hofstra, but the charge, he
claimed, had been thoroughly ventilated
and he wanted his client discharged.
The court said it could not make such an
order and left the bench. Root was con
ducted back to the City Prison by Captain
"Wilson.
As Patsy Carroll arose to leave the room
Chief Lloyd stopped him and said, "Patsy,
I have received some documents from the
East and San Francisco, and I may call on
you to pay my respects at any time."
Carroll looked rather surprised as he re
plied, "My rooms are at 16 Stockton street,
above the Pup. Any time you come over
if I am not in leave your card and I'll
call on you. Don't *fear that I shall
move."

Founded the Red Cross Society.
Dr. Henri Dunant, who jointlj- with his I
friend and fellow-citizen Maynier, chair
man of the Society of Public Utility at
Geneva, founded the Red Cross Society, is !
livinc almost universally forgotten in* the !
hospice of Heiden, in the Swiss canton of
Appenzell. While i he successful warrior !
and even the thwarted filibuster are ex- ;
tolled and glorified Dunant's fortunes I
should offer a flagrant illustration of the I
world's ignorance of its purest heroes. It j
was the horror and disgust with which he
contemplated the terrible scenes that at
te.ided or immediately followed the battle
of Solferino, June 24, 1859, that first moved j
him to make an appeal to the nations to !
take common action for the protection of
the sick and wounded in war, Baffled for j
a lons time Dy opposition or indifference i
Dr. Dunant's efforts were at length re
warded by the conclusion, August. 1864, of
the Geneva Convention and the institution
of the Red Cross Society. It is not doubted
that statues will be "erected to Dunant
after his death, but can nothing be done,
ask ' is friends, to impart a little more
comfort into what still remains to him of
life?

BARBERS ON THE WARPATH
They Will Endeavor to Crush
Out All of the Five-Cent
Shops.
A General Strike Will Be Ordered bj
the Executive Committee in
Two Weeks.
The three Barbers' Unions of this City
have dug up the hatchet and gone on thft
warpath against three common enemies.
They have resolved to do battle to the bit
ter end with Wilson's "College" at 1515
Howard street, theo-oent shoos and the
Supreme Justices who punched such a big
hole in the Sunday closing law by their re
cent decision, in which they declared the
law to be unconstitutional. The three or
ganizations are the Barbers' Association of
San Francisco, the Boss Barbers' Associa
tion and the Journeymen Barbers' Union.
There are in this City about 2500 barbers,
and the majority belong to at least one or
ganization and many to all three.
The situation calling forth such active
warlike preparations covers three distinct
propositions. In the first a man named
Wilson opened a school on Howard street,
where he advertises to teach young men
the art of cutting hair and scraping faces
for a small fee. The regular barbers claim
that Wilson gets the money, and in a
week or so turns out upon the community
workmen who inflict all kinds of tortures
upon their unsuspecting and innocent
victims.
The tonsorial art, they declare, is only
learned by long years of patient study of
strops, steel, cuticle, beards, etc. These
"college" bred barbers are of necessity
obliged to work at low waces, and this,
with the ever-increasing numbers, will
eventually reduce the wages all along the
line. All the associated barbers have
agreed to boycott, by not giving employ
ment to, the "college" graduates, and
place all under the ban who do business
with them.
The "college" barber has not caused the
rank and rile of the craft half so much un
easiness as the recent creation of the rive
cent shop, however. When the first of
these shops made its appearance it caused
no alarm because in the minds of the other
barbers arose visions of alkali soap, razor 3
with teeth on their edges, towels that were
a perpetual boycott on the launary and
other visions that seemed to argue but a
brief career. The ciass that went to such
shops were not desired by any other shops
in the city.
The first two or three shops flourished,
razors and towels notwithstanding, and
their success induced others to make simi
lar ventures, until to day there are twenty
5-cent shops in this City, and many are
doing a flourishing buiiness. In several
of these shops there are as many as ten
chairs in constant use. As may be ex
pected, they are drawing their patronage
from the 10-cent shops, in speaking of
these shops S. Fuchs, who holds offices in
all three organizations, said:
We should have begun our war as soon ai
the tirst five-cent shop opened and crushed it
out at once. Now -we have a bie light upon
our hands. The effect of these shops is to re
duce the vrajtes in the entire trade. Â£>o you
huve any idea what those fellows get? The
best of them do not make over $5 or $7 a week.
AYe have arranged our plans fcr driving them
to the wall. In the City are 000 boss harbors
and 300 belong to the Boss Barbers' Associa
tion.
They are all in on the fieht, even the best
shops in the City. Those who do not belong
are subscribing liberally to the fund that we
will have to use.
Our plan is this. In about two weeks we
will order a general strike and call all of the
journeymen out of the cheap nhojis. Thoae
who do not belong to any union we will order
out, nnd we will pny them the amount of the
WHges they earn when at work uutil we '.'an
provide them with emuiloymeut in respect*
ble shops. This is \vi;at we want the money
for. We have six committees out in as many
districts among storekeepers who have bar
bers' supplies. We will withdraw the patron
age of ail our onions from any who sell* sup
plies to the 5-cent men or to the "college"
graduates. In this way we will cut into their
business. With influence, pressure, boycott
and plenty of money we are sure of winning
the fight. The executive committee will order
the strike very sooii.
The third blow will be struck at the
California Supreme Court Justices who
knocked out the Sunday-closing law last
week. At the next meeting of the barber
organizations resolutions condemning the
Justices for their decision will be passed.
More than that, the barbers will lay their
grievance before the San Francisco Trades
Council and the Labor and Trades Alli
ance. The purpose of this is to bring
political pressure to bear against the Jus
tices should they ever seek office at the
hands of the people again. Of all the
barbers in this City only five shops are
opposed to these proceedings. Circulars
are being sent to all the barbers in the
State to boycott the Justices should they
ever run for office again.

Notwithstanding this he cannot co into

THE DEMOCRATIC GAME
It Is Now Squarely Set as Far
as the State Convention
Is Concerned.
McNab, Lanigaa and Sullivan Will
Name the Gold Delegation to
Sacramento.
Since the meetings of the general com
mittees of the two local Democratic fac
tions on Thursday evening the local
Democratic situation has become clearly
defined as it will exist from now on until
the meeting of the State Convention at
Sacramento on June 16.
The Buckleyites have made a square and
open silver play by declaring that their
delegation to the State Convention shall
be wholly for free silver. From now on
the Buckley faction will be full of life and
its mass - meetings, several committee
meetings and the preparations for its
primary election for convention delegates
will keep things humming.
The silver play made by the Buckleyitea
is their chief reliance in their fight for
recognition before the State Convention.
They have on their side all the equities
that are based on the regularity of their
organization and the party methods which
have been pursued, but before a State
convention something else besides their
claim to having the regular local Demo
cratic organization will count. The con
test will be settled in accordance with
sentiment and political expediency largely,
and as the convention is expected to be
largely in favor of silver, and as the Junta
delegation will represent the Federal
brigade and gold, the 161 silver votes
which the Buckleyites will offer to the
convention, along with the showing that
they represent the bulk of the local party,
are not likely to be spurned in a moment.
The silver resolutions which the Buck
ley general committee adopted on Thurs
day night, on motion of A. J. Clunie, are
too radical to suit many of the leaders,
and they are likely to be modified at the
next meeting of the general committee.
These resolutions prescribe a silver test for
the primary election. There are several
gold men among the Buckley leaders,
among them being A. T. Spotts, coiner of
the Mint, and John McCarthy, president
of the Occidental Club.
Under these resolutions these and other
prominent Democrats whose sympathies
lie with the Buckley faction "would be
shut out. This test will likely be elimi
nated, but then the delegation Will be solid
for silver just the same.
The Junta is now firmly concentrated in
Chairman W. P. Sullivan, who is con
trolled by Gavin McNab and Ed Lanigan,
with three or four people like Frank P.
Hughes and M. C. Hassett getting a chance
to net in a word of advice now and then.
The delegates to the State Convention are
to be practically appointed by McNab
Lanigan and Sullivan.
The form of a primary election will be
gone through with, but it will be wholly
controlled by a campaign committee ap
pointed by Chairman Sullivan, with no
recognition given to the people of the dis
tricts or to the general committee itself
and as McNab, Lanigan and Sullivan will
name the regular tickets and the elective
officers ana control everything, the people
they name will compose the delegation
wbicli tney expect to seat in the State con
vention.
When the State Convention is over
things will break somewhat differently.
The lo.al Democracy will then engage in
a scramble for local power. The present
McNao-Lanigati regime looks to the ele
vation of these two as the local Demo
cratic bosses. But there is Buckley to
reckon with and Rainey to reckon witn, as
well as the ereat neutral element of the
party, who are no more inclined to boost
Gavin McNab an i Ed Lanigan into con
trol of the local Democracy than they are
to back Sam itainey in his fight for boss
power.
Will Not Be Represented.
MILPITAS, Cal., April 18.â The Carni

at Sauta Eosa are given up.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Delay of the Gaelic Probably
Due to Quarantine at
Honolulu.
HAD BLACK PLAGUE ABOARD.
Marrying end Giving in Marriage Is
In Vogue Among Shipping
Men.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's Gaelic was to have arrived
from Yokohama, via Honolulu, according
to schedule time., on the 17th Inst. She i 9
a fast vessel, and is generally as regular as
clockwork, so the agents are beginning to
thinJj that she has been quarantined at
Honolulu. If such is the case it will be a
great relief to the United States and State
quarantine authorities, as both branches
of the service are anxiously awaiting the
arrival of the steamer.
The black plague is raging in China, and
when the Gaelic was a few days out it was
discovered that there was a case in the
Chinese steerage. When Yokahama "was
reached the cooly was put ashore, and
died the next day. After landing her
cargo into lighters the steamer proceeded
on her way, and probably reached Hono
lulu about the 10th inst. Aa she would
not have a dean bill of health, the Ha
waiian authorities would undoubtedly
place her in quarantine. In that event,
she may be delayed for the full term, and
will then be given a clean bill of health,
and on arriving at San Francisco will be
allowed to dock without any trouble.
As matters stand at present, however,
Dr. Blue of the United States Marine Hos
pital service and Dr. Chalmers, the State
quarantine officer, are watching night and
day for the arrival of the Gaelic.
The San Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad Company has a grievance against
the Harbor Commissioners. The latter
have been cleaning out the manholes
along the front, and the refuse taken from
some of them has a most disgusting and
powerful odor. Tne filth waa taken to the
ferry depot and the planka under the win
dows- of the railroad were torn up,
and there in front of the waiting pas
sengers the stuff was dumped. This pro
cess continued all the afternoon, and
while tne latter loads were mostly sand
and brick still it did not detract from the
fact that hundreds of passengew had to
stand the stench during the time they
were awaiting the different trips of the
steamer Tiburon. Had President Colnon
been around at the time and seen the filth
being dumped right under the waiting
room windows he would have instantly
stopped the work and ordered the men to
seek another dumping ground.
The American ship St. John arrived
from Kanaimo, B. C., yesterday, with a
decided list to port. She was caught in
the sont h wester that sank the Blairmore,
and had a rough time of it. The cargo
shifted, but as it did not appear danger
ous the captain ran for port. The ship is
not making water and is not strained.
The water front had a sensation last Fri
day night. Mattio Droba*?, who for over
thirty-five year? has kept the saloon at the
corner of Clay and East streets, got mar
ried and his friends rallied to the celebra
tion. The groom is over 68 years old and
for twenty-seven years has been a widower.
The bride was a handsome young widow,
and the couple started yesterday for Byron
Springs. Mr. Drobas is well-to-do, and is
the father-in-law of P. McGlade, the well
known Deputy Registrar. .
Marriages on the front seem to be popu
lar, as C. Eric Koch, the well-known and
well-liked steward of the steamer Alcazar,
is going to take unto himself a wife at 7
o'clock to-night. The bride will be Miss
Augusta Hansen, and friends of Eric
spent yesterday in wishing him long life
and happiness. Steward Koch has been
on the coasting "teamers for years and
some time ago was on the Vallejo route.
He has been popular wherever he went,
and his friends intend making his mar
riage a merry one.
The leak on the schooner Bonanza baa
increased, and now the work of discharg
ing the vessel has begun. She is leaking
at the rate of ten inches an hour, and a
.considerable portion of her perishable
cargo has been damaged. The general
imrression is that the leak is caused by
cheap work put in by the agent. The
Bonanza was to start on a trading cruise
to the Arctic last Thursday, but aa she
will now have to be docked for recalkiug
it may be weeks before she will get away.
The Seventh Day Aiiventist schooner
Pitcairn, now lying in Oakland Creek, will
sail on her fifth missionary voyage to the
South Sea Islands on the 30tb inst. It
is not yet fuliv decided who will go out on
the vessel, but ou the preceding Sunday a
memorial service will be held and tne mis
sionaries will then be picked out.
The bark Enoch Taibot mad a record
breaking run of forty-eight hours from
hern to Redondo, and Captain Johnson is
jubilant. While in port here he had con
siderable trouble with his wife, She was
form rly a Miss Beatrice Lee, a member of
the Emma Abbott Opera Company, and is
said to nave married the gallant skipper
out of spite. When the Taibot docked at
Folsom street the wife ran away, but later
was found in the cabin of the vessel â uffer
injc from the effects of poison. She recov
ered and when the Taibot went to sea she
went with her husband.

those that dwelt in hi<*h places in the

And Joe Tolrin, he that was married,
looked into the books he had not used at

draw up a Ions? set of resolutions, for in
those days when two or thr c men were

HARD ON HER SON'S WIFE.
A Tale of Desertion and Want
That Opened Many Purse-

Mrs. Mooney Visits Oakland to Learn
What Her Daughter-in-Law
Has Been Doing.
â¢ â â â â â
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
. 908 Broadway, April 18. )
Mis. A. Mooney of South San Francisco
was in Oakland to-day finding out to what
extent her daughter-in-law has fleeced res
idents of this city. According to Mrs.
Mooney's story her son's wife is a remark
ably shrewd young woman whose wits are
all the capital she needs.
"When I read in the papers that my son
had deserted bis wife and gone to Alaska
I was dumfounded," said Mrs Mooney.
''I could not understand it and immedi
ately set about an inquiry. My son, whose
name is Landis, went to Idaho and asked
his wife to stay with me until he could
send her money enough to follow him.
She knew this, but left my house and I do
not know where she went.
"Since she left I have received a letter
from her tbat has -not pleased me at all.
She came. over to Oakland and obtained
help from several officials and merchants
by telling them that she bad been deserted
and was in want. Her husband was a spe
cial detective for a while, and made some
friends and more enemies, and when it
was known that he had left the little
woman who looked after his interests so
weil while he was awaiting trial mucn
substantial sympathy was shown. She
went before the Supervisors, and I under
stand that she fared very well. .
"Since the account of her desertion wai
published she has written me a letter that
is a revelation. She says that she has
been in Oakland, and has bunkoed people
here till she has raised a large sum of
money. She tells me she knows that her
husband is in Idaho, and that she intends
to join him. She also asks me not to say
anything about this till she has gone.
Where she baa gone I do not know, but 1
do not believe she has joined my son or I
should have heard.
"Her 'bunko game' to which she refers
is the little story about the desertion and
tbe going to Alaska. allot which is untrue.
For all I know, Bbc is still in Oakland, and
if what she says is true she ought to have
quite a snug sum of coin."

MARTIN RECOVERS
BIG DAMAGES
The Railroad Must Pay-
Twenty -Five Thousand
Dollars.
JUROR HOWE'S STAND.
He Contended That Martin Should
Receive Three Times That
Amount.
THE MAN A PHYSICAL WRECK.
A Reputable Fruit-Dealer Treated Like
a Hoboâ Brilliant Victory for
His Attorneys.
We, the jury, find In favor of the plain
tiff and against the defendant in the
above-entitled action and assess the
damages for the plaintiff in the sum of
â¢25,000.
When Foreman Nathan Dodge handed
in this verdict in Judge Daingerfield's
court yesterday afternoon, General Barnes,
MR. DELMAS MAKING HIS SPEECH TO THE JURY.
[Sketched in court by a "Call" staff artist.]
of counsel for the Southern Pacific Com
pany, turned white. It was the first of
thirteen similar cases pending, and $25,
--000 was a rather ominous beginning for
the unlucky number.
Attorneys Delmas and Shortridge
smiled at their crippled client, Georsre N.
Martin, who had been forced off a railway
car at a lonely mountain station by em
ployes of the Southern Pacific Company
because the company did not like his style
of handwriting on the round-trip ticket
from Sioux City to San Francisco, for
which he had paid at full rates in gold.
General Barnes rallied and asked to !
have the jurors polled. The question was
put to each of them as to whether it was
their verdict that the railroad company j
should pay the plaintiff, Martin, $25,000.
Foreman Nathan Dodge, S. Fisher. Samuel
Rosenberg, Albert Folsom, James F. Nou
nan. Charles A. Castner, William Mocker,
G. W. Haskell and Cornelius Jensen re
plied emphatically that such was their
verdict. Jurors C. L. Stone and James
Holland replied as emphatically that such
was not their verdict, and E. P. Howe
replied:
"That is partly my verdict and partly
not. I divide it in this way. It is my ver
dict as to the liability of the defendant,
but as to the amount of damages I think
it is entirely too small."
The verdict'" was entered, the court
thanked the jury for their services and
discharged them.
It was afterward learned that the delay in
finding the verdict had been caused by
Juror RoTre arguing to the jury that the
wrongs which the plaintiff had suffered at
the hands of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, from the beginning of the affair to
the end of the case, were such that $75,000
could not adequately compensate him for.
Rowe called the attention of the jurors to
the fact that as soon as Martin brought tho
suit the company had put the Pinkerton
detectives upon his track and raked up
everything that they could find against
him, because he had the temerity to sue
the great corporation.
The veraict was the talk of the City last
evening. It was generally agreed that the
award of the jury was not excessive, con
sidering the brutal treatment to which
Martin had been subjected after he had
paid bis fare, merely because a train
agent, acting under instructions from
headquarters, had conceived a whim to
suspect him,
Martin's physical condition is most de
plorable. He is a confirmed invalid, suf
fering from locomotor ataxia, and moves
about only with the greatest difficulty.
He Is engaged in business as a fruit com
mission dealer in Sioux City, and has been
a large handler of fruit of California, Flor
ida and Massachusetts, which he distrib
uted from Sioux City throughout the Mid
dle West.
His business has amounted to $100,000 a
year, and he usually has eight or ten car
loads of fruit standing on the sidetrack.
It was shown in the evidence that on one
occasion he bought the whole output of
the Orange-Growers' Association at River
side; yet the defendant's detectives tried
to make him out a little better than a
hobo and a member of thebeercan brigade.
These tactics disgusted the jury. They
thought that it was a very poor way to de
fend the company against the charge,
t Ihe Southern Pacific Railroad Company
| had marie no more bitter legal battle in
the courts of this county than that of its
opposition to the suit of George N. Martin
for damages for having been thrown off
one of its trains for no better reason than
that a conductor did not like the way he
wrote his signature.
The fight has been waged for three
weeks before Jud.-e Daingertield.
On the one side was the leading jury
lawyer for the company, General Barnes,
and on the other, for the crippled plaintiff,
D. M. Delmas.
The company had brought into requisi
tion all its tremendous resources in euch
warfare. Witnesses were brought from
the most distant parts of the country,
passes and traveling expenses being paid
and a general holiday being provided.
Many of the witnesses brought their
wives along and put up at the best hotels.
That great engine for supplying informa
tion to order â private information for
public purposesâ the Pinkerton Detective
Agency, was enlisted to blacken the char
acter of the plaintiff.
But it all went for nothing. After but a
couple of hours' debate in their room
after the Judge's charge the jury brought
in a verdict for plaintiff for $25,000.
The Southern Pacific Company knew
why it was making this fight. It was not
to avoid the payment of $25,000 in this
case alone.
For the case of Martin is only one of a
great number of similar recent indignities
suffered by patrons of the road. The order
went out with the inauguration of the
new management that conductors must
require the most exacting identification
of passengers. In fulfilling these orders
a great number of passengers holding bona
fide tickets have been put off the trains at
various places.
As stated, initiatory steps have been
taken upon claims for damages for redress
of these outrages that will run up in
amount to a quarter of a million. So the
company knew why it was making in this
case one of the legal fights of its entire ex
istence. And it has lost.
MR. DELMAS' ARGUMENT.
The Evidence as Reviewed by the
Counsel for the De
fense.
Yesterday afternoon when the court
rooms were all deserted and the doors
locked and the clerks and Judges and law
yers all gone home and the jury were in
their room deliberating, the corridors were
still haunted by late-comers, who hoped
to hear something of the wind up of
the Martin case. Â«
During the close of Mr. Del mas' argu
ment in the morning the courtroom was
the scene of the same crush and struggle
for place that has characterized every day
of the last week of the trial.
Mr. Deltnas took up the broken thread
of his argument at the reference to the
ticket-scalpers and Martin's alleged at
tempt to sell the ticket to them. He said
that there was no proof that Martin had
ever offered the ticket for sale at Ottin
ger's or anywhere else or that the ticket
had ever been bulletined, although the
other side had expressly stated such proof
would be furnished.
Then returning to the handwriting and
those round and sharp pointed M's and
N's. The conductor at the Oakland mole
in the proper discbarge of his duty had
called Martin's attention to the discrepancy
in the shape of these letters as written on
the ticket and as written by Martin at his
request, and Martin had thereupon written
the name with the round points as he was
in the habit of doing at times, and the
writing was satisfactory and the passenger
was allowed to go on his way. This con
ductor had done his duty, and not acted
like a man setting a trap for or trying to
deceive the passenger. Any bank cashier
would have done the same. The conductor
was not there to entrap his passengers.
It was hid business only to satisfy him
self of Martin's identity and to do every
thing possible to do so. So he understood
it, it seems, for he did not peremptorily
i take the ticket up and put the passenger
off the train. Where is that first signa
tureâthe first when the return trip was just
begunâ the one that satisfied Hubbard?
It was made with the sharp-pointed M's
and N's that so troubled these conductors.
Hubbard says he gave it back ; Martin says
he did not. Every other of the signatures
secured from Martin, every business card,
every other paper having to do with this
transaction is brought in here save this
one. Why is that? It is because that sig
nature was just the same as this one, for
which the passenger was put off the train.
"It is charged that this man was trying
to perpetrate a fraud. If he wished to do
so would he have ticketed his baggage with
the name of George N. Martin and had
his business cards and business letters
with him bearing his name?
"Why should a man who wanted any
one to believe he was not George N. Mar
tin have carried such evidence around
with him to frustrate his own planâ that
plan being that he was not George N. Mar
tin?
"It is an admitted fact that he exhibited
all these evidences to the conductor, and it
is not possible that he would have done so
bad his idea beeu to make the conductor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
believe he was somebody that he was not."
Then the question of the cane was taken
up. The head of the cane was shown as
the one Martin showed to the conductor.
"Murray had said it was a cold- headed
cane, but why was he not put upon the
stand to swear it was not the cane? The
fact remains that Martin had shown a
gold-headed cane. The cane was presented
to him by the Orange-growers' Packing
Company; he valued it, and it shows that
it has been often used. In his condition
Martin evidently used it a great deal, and
it is beyond a doubt that he had it with
him at the time. The man who was be
hind Martin said he had seen Martin
show a cane to the conductor.
"Is it possible he would have done so had
he wisned to prove to the conductor that
he was not George N. Martin ? Would he
have shown the names on his letters and
cards, his match-safe, etc., if he did not
want to prove that he was George N. Mar
tin? He said he showed his watch; Murray
says to the best of his knowledge Martin
did not do so. Simmonds says he thinks
Martin did. He did not see the watch,
but he saw Martin put his hand to the
pocket in which a watch is usually car
ried ; he drew something from his pocket
and sbowed it to the conductor and the
conductor leaned forward to look at it and
he stretched out his hand and turned it
over.
It is admitted that he begged the con
ductor to carry him to Truckee, where
there were persons living who could
identify him. And would he have done
this had his purpose been to prove to the
conductor that he was not George N. Mar
tin? In view of all these circumstances
does it appear that plaintiff had himself
purposely put off the train? I submit
that he did not.
Then did the defendants believe that
Martin committed a fraud ? If so why did
they offer to return his ticket to him and
recompense him for the time he lost by
being put off the train and give him a
Pullman berth? And all this when the
inconvenience he was subjected to was,
according to them, only the frustration of
his own dishonest plans?
The only construction to be put upon it
is that they believe Mr. Martin was not a
fraud, was not a cheat, that he was enti
tled to legal compensation, but that it
should deplete the treasury of the railroad
as little as possible.
"If you believe." continued Mr. Delmas,
"that Martin was not wrongfully put off
the train, then your further detention by
argument is worse than idle. But, assum
ing that I have proved that Martin was
wrongfully put off the train, I can go on
and show what followed as a consequence."
Mr. Delmas then took up the events which
followed immediately after the ejection of
Martin from the train.
It was reasoned that there had been a
commotion when Martin was put off. At
tention was called to the fact that Martin
did not take with him his satchel and
overcoat, and that the conductor did not
do so either. They were carried out by
the brakeman, because the hands of both
the conductor and of Martin were other
wise engaged. Then, too, the brakeman
had been called in; and what was the rea
son for sending for him if Martin was
coing to leave the train as quietly as the
defense had said he did? Martin says he
was violently pulled from his seat and was
bundled out of the car, and this testimony
was corroborated by that of Mr. Tracy, a
passenger who saw it all.
The statements of Collins, the brake
man, were next considered. Collins had
said he was not present at all when Martin
was ejected. To offset this testimony was
the evidence given by Martin, by several of
the passengers, and of Weaton, the con
ductor, all of whom swore that the brake
man was there. The easiest way to dii
prove that Martin had been roughly han
dled, counsel continued, was to prove that
Collins was not there at all, and that Wes
ton put Martin out alone; but counsel
believed, when this was attempted by
Collins' statement that he was not there,
the defens* had overshot the mark.
The medical testimony then came under
comment. Martin's first ailment, thermal
ataxia, was described as one brought on by
sudden amd great changes of temperature,
but its change to locomotor ataxia was due
to violence, to a wrench, and that this was
done when the man was being cast from
the train.
The charge of Judge Daingerfield was
delivered and the jury retired.
General Barnes had suegested the day
before that the case be submitted to the
jury without argument. In his opening
address Mr. Delmas made reply to this
suggestion as follows, taking the occasion
to pay a glowing tribute to General Barnes 1
son, District Attorney Barnes. He said :
Was it not the universal sentiment of the bar
I that the only hope of escape for the arch-fiend
who a year ago startled us with the double
murder of the two Innocent girls in Emmanuel
Church lay in submitting his case to the jury
without argument? Did not every experienced
lawyer appreciate that, owing to the length of
the trial, the number of witnesses examined,
the variety of subjects touched upon and the
exhauÃtlveness of the investigations made,
there was a chance that the fallible memory of
jurors mi^ht overlook some essential fact or
their unassisted mind fail to perceive its im
portance? Was not the reed upon which the
defense leaned broken by the argument of the
District Attorney â that argument which
whil pointing out with the finger of unerring
reason every circumstance bearing UDon the
prisoner's guilt and demonstrating with un
assailable logic its relation to the case, clothed
the orator's thoughts with that wealth and
splendor of marvelous eloquence which awak
ened in our City the profoundest sentiments
of pride and admirationâ thatargumentwhich,
while it filled a Nation with wonder, was ac
cepted by all as the greatest which human ears
had heard since that delivered in the Knapp
I case by. the immortal Webster himself? If I
i cannot hope to reach here to such a height
few have attained, none have surpassed it â
still, if you will grant me your patient indul
gence, I will endeavor, according to my meas
ure, to lighten your labors on the way.
Asiatic Thespians at Sutro's.
There was a delighted audience of fully 5000
people at Sutro baths yesterday afternoon to
witness the initial performance of the most
famous troupe of Chinese singers, acrobats
and jugglers that has ever visited this coast.
The costuming was of the most elegant de
scription, and the tumbling and pyramid work
especially took the crowd's fancy. There are
over eighty performers, instead of fifty as ad
vertised, and each one is an artist in his line.
It argues well for the foresight of Colonel
Robinson and Mayor Sutro that the troupe
was engaged, and there will undoubtedly be
an immense crowd at the baths to-day, for the
opportunity of seeing a thorough Chinese per

is one that every one will grasp.

Why the Delegates to St. Louis
Should Not Be Tied to
One Man.

Delegate Llewellyn, Supervisor Dun
can and Major Hooper On the
Overdue Cabinet Place.
Major W. H. H. Llewellyn, delegate
from New Mexico to the Republican Na
tionai Convention at St. Louisas at the
Palace. Mr. Llewellyn is an attorney and
largely interested in mining and other en
terprises. He has lived in New Mexico
sixteen years.
"The delegation from New Mexico is en
tirely uninstructed," said he, "and in my
judgment this gives the delegation a power
it would not have if it was pledged to any
body. I hope the delegates from California
and the whole Pacific Coast will likewise
go uninstructed. If they will do bo, I
think California is almost certain to get a
cabinet position.
"It would be very unwiÃe for the Western
people, and especially those on the Pacific
Coast, to send instructed deJegates, no dif
ference who they might be for.
"By sending instructed delegates, the
coast will be more apt to damage its inter
ests than to aid them. There is nothing
to be gained by tying ourselves up in ad
vance to any one man, because if he didn't
get the nomination, it would in a large
measure take away the friendship of the
man who might win.
"On the other hand if the coast goes un
pledged every candidate will be our friend.
"Select a delegation of representative
men, who are thoroughly identified with
every interest and in whom there is confi
dence, and then let the delegation go anjl
exercise their best judgment. By such a
course as this the Pacific Coast will make
itself felt at St. Louis and, as I before re
marked, I believe California will be able
to get a Cabinet position. This would
please New Mexico, for what would give
power to California would aid New Mexico
and the entire coast. We buy much
mining machinery here and other sup
plies, and have a great interest in San
Francisco and California. I hope we will
all be able to stand together at St. Louis,
and with our unpledged delegates cast
our votes where they will do the most good
and where we will be enabled to secure
the recognition long overdue us."
Supervisor A. M. Duncan of Mendocino,
one of the nine Republican delegates from
Mendocino County to the State Convention
is at the Grand. He is very much opposed
to the pledging of the delegates to St.
Louis and thinks th*t if the delegates are
pledged they will be badly crippled in
their ability to do the best work.
"I would hate like everything to see
California's delegates go to St. .Louis in
ths way," said Mr. Duncan, "for it would
rob them of half their strength. They
will be in a far better position if they are
able to go entirely free, make friends with
everybody and vote as they deem wisest
after they get on the ground.
"Suppose the delegates all go down to St.
Louis pledged to McKinley, and suppose
there is a combination ana he is unable to
be nominated, what kind of a position
would they be in? On the contrary if he
cannot be nominated they can change to
Mr. Allison or any other good man. Per
sonally I am in favor of Mr. Allison, but
I would not have the delegation pledged
even to him.
"Dan T. Cole, the Harbor Commissioner,
who is from Mendocino, and who we of
the First district are in favor of for dele
gate to St. Louis, says he wants to go un
pledged, and I am for him strong on that
account. He is for McKinley, I believe,
first, and after that for some other good
man like Allison."
"As far as I am concerned I am in favor
of an unpledged delegation to the Repub
lican National Convention at St. Louis,"
said Major W. B. Hooper of the Occi
dental. For close on to fifty years now
California has been trying to get a Cabinet
position or some other appointment that
would help out the State and coast, bur up
to date we have never got anything worthy
of the name.
"The politicians in the East have given
ns the glad hand till they got our votes
and then they knew us no more. We have
played soft and got our reward.
'â¢Now, if we go down; to St. Louis tied
up for one man in advance â the delegates
pledged before they leave the Stateâ tsow
are we ever to stand any show to get any
thing? A certain man has got our votes
and that settles it.
"But if the delegation goes unpledged
it can be in a position to be of real service
to the man who will do most for Cali
fornia. Its hands won't be tied. The
delegates can act intelligently and accom
plish more in this way for the State. If
they go down to St. Louis shouting for

tion where will they be? How will the
successful candidate feel toward them and
California?
"For these reasons and many more
which I could give if I had time I am not
in favor of pledging the delegation. It
should by all means go unpledged. It is a
more dignified Dosition for the delegates
and their power would undoubtedly be
greater.
General Lucius H. Foote, who was a
delegate from California to the National
Republican Convention at Cincinnati,
when Ingersoll made the famous speech
nominating Blame for President, is a firm
advocate of an unpledged delegation to the
St. Louis convention. His observation
and experience in that convention taught
him that a delegation to be useful and in
fluential should not be hampered or
restrained by cast-iron instructions. Gen
eral Fooie had the honor of casting the
vote of California for Blame, yet at the
time he was convinced, notwithstanding
all the enthusiasm and the great display
cf strength for Blame on the first ballot,
that some other candidate would ulti
mately win the prize. Hayes was nomi
nated in the end.
General John F. Sheehan said : "I am
in favor of sending a delegation to St.
Louis instructed for McKinley. I believe
such instruction will reflect the sentiment
of California Republicans "
Ex-Judge Van R. Paterson of the firm ot
Rodgers <fe Paterson, having been urged by
many of his party to be a candidate for
delegate-at-large to the National Repub
lican Convention at St. Louis, and it being
understood that he did not care to pose as
a candidate, was interviewed on the sub
ject at the firm's offices in the Nevada
building yesterday.
When asked if he would be a candidate
for delegatÂ«-at-large, he responded:
"I certainly shall not. lam out of poli
tics; besides, I am too thoroughly en
grossed in my legal affairs to pay any at
tention to political matters."
"Do you think the Californian delegation
will be pledged ? If so, to whom ?"
"Well," said the Judge, contemplatively,
"in my opinion the Californian delegation
will be pledged to support McKinlev."
"Whom do you think will be "second
choice?"
"Allison, undoubtedly."
"Dame Rumor hath it, Judge, that you
are opposed to pledged delegations. Is
there any foundation in fact for the tale? "
Judge Paterson was silent for a moment
as if deeply engaged in thought. Then he
answered slowly:
"Well, as I am out of politics I am not
prepared to say whether or not we should
send a pledged delegation to St. Louis.
For this reason my opinion may not count
for much.
"However, I am opposed to pledged del
egations on general principles. I think it
radically wrong to send a pledged delega
tion to any National convention.
"A pledged delegation is not infrequent
ly placed in a most embarrassing position
on account of a change in coriditions.
For instance, McKinley seems to-day to
be the most popular candidate â certainly
has shown the greatest strength; and ap
pearances indicate his nomination. At
the same time something might arise to
convince the delegation that McKinley
could not be nominated or would not be
acceptable. Then, again, he might ex
press a view upon some subject which
would change the sentiment of the people
of our State. The delegation would, in
either event,, be placed in a position where
they would have to violate their pledge or
stand firm and act against their best judg
ment.
"And," added the Judge, "It is not a
pleasant thing to be tied to a dead man's
bones."
MAYOR SUTRO REPLIES.
l>em>s That Fin Intended to Charge the
Almthouoe for Wood Supplied.
The enemies of Mayor Sutro who Have
been trying to prejudice him in the eyes
of the public by claiming that he, as a
public official, was selling wood to a pub
lic institution, were effectually check
mated yesterday when the Mayor sent the
following communication to the Board of
Supervisors :
It appears from the newspapers that Mr.
FlannÃgan. one of my employes, acting on his
own responsibility, has agreed to sell some
wood to Mr. Weaver of the Almsnouse for $5
per cord, and the superintendent alleging that
he had to pay $8 a cord for the same char
acter of wood down at the wharf and there
after haul the same to the Almshouse.
My wood is located very near that public
institution. It further appears that these facts
have been commented upon as being in con
flict with certain flections of law. It hÂ»s not
been my intent to bring myself in opposition to
any statutory provision. Therefore, to relieve
any and all persons from any criticism, even
ostensibly justified by the letter of the statute,
my instructions have been given to Mr. Flan
nagan not to deliver any more wood to the
Almshouse, and for the wood that has been
delivered, it is my hope that the municipality
will permit me to donate the same for the
benefit of that institution, it not being my
desire to demand any pay for the same. Very
respectfully yours, Adolph Sutro.

INTERFERENCE
IN" the pursuit of his enterprise on this
certain night Joseph Queltin, known
variously as French Joe, Backdoor
Frenehy, Soar-face Jo", and the like,
was confronted with the disagreeable '
necessity of strangling his victim. This I
was because Mr. Martin, in spite ot the
burglar's matchless skill as a silent opera
tor, happened to be sleeping in an unaccus
tomed room and was uncommonly wake
ful. As he was rather a delicate man
Joe, who was possessed of prodigious
strength, found the task not at all diffi
cult, though none the less distasteful for
that. It requires more ferocity to choke
the life out of a human being than is com
patible with the deft skill of a burglar so
accomplished as Queltin, but when driven
to murder as the alternative of an outcry,
a strugtrle and possible discovery he did
not hesitate a moment. At the instant j
when, after turning the key of Mr. Mar- I
tin's hall door with an "outsider," he I
entered and the victim awoke, he shot
open the slide of his dark-lantern, so as
fora second to draw Mr. Martin's atten-'
tion from his real danger to the broad
circle of light which the lantern threw
upon the opposite wall, ana then sprang
to the bed in the shadow and sank ten
trusty fingers and thumbs into a warm,
yielding throat. It was all over in a min
bfa or two.
Then the burglar, with anything but a
cheerful heart and with many a nervous
plan<Â«e toward ttie silence that burdened
the bed and filled the whole chamber with.
its weight, proceeded abont his business.
He had done so much fine preliminary
work on the case, and had planned the
affair with so great care that the surprise
which had forced him into a tragedy had
weakened the security of his nerve.
He shivered as he glanced over his
shoulder toward the bed with its awful
load of silence.
"Don't suppose there's another man in
my profession that eonld have got on to
this sly old duck with his rubies and dia
monds that he brought from India. That's
because the lad don't understand the trick
of watching the faces of people when the
customs officers put 'em through at the !
dock.
"Good thine that beastly monkey that
he brought was sly enough to do the
HnojrgHng while the officers was thinking
about liie man. Good thing for me, too, !
that the bean didn't hear nothing just I
now, or he might be screeching."
In spite of this semi-cheerful mono- :
logue, pursued while a trunk and the !
drawersof a oureau were yielding up from
their remoter corners a sparkling diamond j
here and a glowing ruby there, Queltin i
was under a tremendous nervous strain.
The commission of a murder in the course i
of a burglary is not only unprofessional i
and evidence of a blundering skill in an j
exquisite art, but the silence that follows I
i- aggressive, biting and terrifying. The ;
burglar's nerves were on so hard a strain j
that when the closed door standing within !
the circle of liglit thrown by the dark lan
tern whs suddenly opened and a formid- ;
able figure slouched clumsily over the ''
threshold, the burglar with a smothered !
gasp snatched a stifling mask from his i
face with his left hand, drew a long, thin
bladed knife with his right and sprang
back into an attitude of defense. It
Beamed to him that in this one moment of i
terror his heart would burst.
But it was only for a moment. In the
next instant he recognized the lodger's aid
in the smuggling enterpriseâ a splendid
specimen of the male orang-outang, five
feet in heicrht, and though of enormous !
strength, an indolent and docile beast. It
Was not alone the opening of the door that j
had alarmed the burgiar; the giant ane,
f.tartled by the unaccustomed burning
eye that blazed at him from the '
darK-lantern on the bureau had as- i
sinned instinctively a menacing atti
tude toward it, ignorant as yet of the !
more formidable presence that crouched !
behind the lantern in the darkness, and i
with drawn knife awaited assault. ' The
a]>e soon realized that what he saw was
not dangerous, and then he yawned,
blinked sleepily and began to Took idly
about the room.
From terror the situation of Queltin ''
quickly degenerated into that of a half- â 
amused perplexity. Would the beast, "see- i
ing his master lying so quiet on the bed, \
retire peacefully? Would he suspect any- ;
thing from the disordered condition of the
bed-cloihing, or from his master's disor
ganized aspect, or from his silence or the
prevalent evidences of confusion in the
room? Could he smell a strange man? If
ho discovered .the truth would Jie run, cry
out or light ?
The oraqg, unlike his anthropoid con- j
gener?, is slow and deliberate in domes- !
tication, seeming to have more thinking
than anything else to do. This one, I
called by his master Kahruo, seemed j
old, for he was growing gray, carried j
considerable flesh and was awkward
in gait. The heavy projection of his!
orbital arches and their furnishing of
rebellious hair, taken with the expanse
of his jaw and the sinister smallness of his
ears, gave him a ferocious look, which
the bland expression of his eyes was in
sufficient to tamo. His grotesquely long
arms, reaching below his knees, had a
suggestive restlessness that contrasted
oddly witii the blankness of his face and
the clumsiness of his body and lower
liiul>!-.
Having yawned, blinked and danced
idly about the room the ape, too indolent
and sleepy to move further, peered at his
master's bed, which lay in semi-darkness.
As he .lid so his manner became more at
tentive. He cocked his head on this side
and that, listening. Meanwhile he had
succumbed into a sitting posture, his
" Queltin began to advance cautiously, his knife-hand behind him."
knuckles resting on the floor. He seemed
to become more and more interested as he
listened. Then he shambled on all fours
to tlie bedside, quietly raised himself to a
standing posture and gazed earnestly at
hLs master. Queltin breathlessly awaited
the result.
Kahrao gently touched his master's
hand, then raised it and let it fall inert.
He waited and then took his master by
the shoulder and shook him. There wa's
no response. The ape desisted and seat
ing himself comfortably on the edge of the
bed yawned a< though "he was bored.
AH' this had consumed so much time
that Queltin could no longer bear the
strain imposed by his attitude. Although
he had no acquaintance with the ape he
had observed him to be intelligent arfd
docile. He decided therefore to make hj.s
presence known and offer some friendly 1
advances. Gently placing his knife hand
behind him he took a step forward, saying
pleasantly :
"Kahmo."
With astounding celerity the orang
leaped from the bed toward the door which
he had left open. This entered an inner
chamber, and was not the door by which
Queltin had gained admittance. He
paused at the threshold and faced the in
truder, his eyes Hashing and his formid
able teeth barea in a menacing grin. As
he was in full glare of the light he could
not see the burglar, who, noting the ad
vantage which tne shadow gave him, re
mained where he was, but began to speak
coaxingly to the brute.
The light annoyed Kahmo. Though he
feared danger, his master's presence was
more reassuring than possible safety in
flight into back rooms, from which escape
in the event, of pursuit would be difficult.
Besides, Kahmo hat! the absorbing curios
ity of his species. He itched for a clear
view of the figure now dimly discernible
in the shadow. In order to secure this he
must abandon his means of retreat. This
he suddenly did, alighting in one clean j
bound upon his master's bed, which
cracked under the impact. There, being
in equal darkness with the intruder, he
peered sharply at him.
Queltin continued to speak reassuringly
m low tones, as there were other lodgers in
the house. He began cautiously to ad- j
vance, his knife-hand behind him and his |
eyes making careful study of a place in the
ape s body to receive the thrust.
All at once the burglar wondered why he
had deemed it necessary to attack the ape.
Being a shrewd and experienced operator I
he had made it a rule to be governed by I
uncdnscious rather than dehbeTate men
tal operations in perilous situations. His i
instinct ID this instance urged him to kill
but his reason questioned both the neces
sity and the expediency of that course. As
the ape was evidently terrified, was ig
norant of his master's death and clung to
the Dody for protection, what risk would
Queltin run in retreating quietly, seeing
that he had already made a haul of jewels
that would support him in luxury fora
year or more? But there must be other
tine stones hidden away, and the burglar
who understands his business would be
ashamed to leave them. And, besides,
what was there about a gibbering, grinning
ape to frighten a strong man ol superior
intelligence and courage? Queltin snapped
his ringers at his timidity, openly sheathed
his knife and proceeded about his work.
Tne orang couched immovable upon the
bed, one hand pressing his master's breast,
and watched the burglar unceasingly.
It became necessary for Queltin to pick
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 189(5.
up the dark-lantern and use it in his ex
plorations. He searched the remotest cor
ners of the bureau-drawers and then began
gently to rip up the edges of the carpet.
He found a gem .here and there. Finally
he had made a thorough search of that
room without interruption from Kahmo,
who still sat in pitiful helplessness on
â  the bed, no part of him except his eyes
I having moved. Queltin now decided to
examine the other chambers of the suite.
His contempt for Kahmo was complete.
| He was even so foolhardy as to make a
j grimace and a feint of striking as he passed
the bed on his way to the open door.
Kahmo dodged, bared his teeth and
! growled, and for the first time his eyes
j blazed with a new light. Queltin chuckled
i softly.
While searching the inner room the
burglar, whose attentive ear had caught
jno sound, felt a chill air. He was on his
knees pressing the carpet with his fingers
at that side of the room farthest from the
communicating door. His lantern sat on
the floor, its blazing eye directed toward
! the door and throwing its lieht upon a
â  French window in the front of the room
| where Mr. Martin lay, nearly forty feet
away. To his astonishment he discovered
that the shade covering this window had
been raised to the top and that the two
broad- hinged sashes were wide open.
Queltin even noticed that the light from
his lantern, after passing through the
open door and window, fell upon a blank
white wall on the opposite side of the
street.
He was puzzled and alarmed. How
couid the window have been opened and
for what purpose? The rooms were on
the first floor. Underneath them were
j shops. Directly above was a suite oceu-
I pied by an elderly woman who taught
school and lived alone. She could not
have reached the window without passing
through the room in which Mr. Martin
I lay. and the window could not have been
approached from without except by the
aid of a ladder to the tire-escar>e.
At last an idea struck the burglar â the
ape had escaped by means of the window.
That seemed simple and natural.
But it was dangerous to have the win
dow open and the curtain upâ the mov
! ing light might attract the police. Quel
! tin was putting forth bis hand to shift the
light before closing the window, when two i
lithe, long and powerful arms closed si
lently upon him, pressing his own arms to
his sides.
"Kahmo!" he gasped, as the brute's !
) grasp tightened.
The orang had seized him from a quar
tering rear approach. Both were seated
on the floor. Queltin was at a great dis- I
advantage. Only his hands were free, but I
he could reach "nothing with them, not!
even his knife, which was pressed firmly I
between his body and the ape's.
The burglar made no resistance at pres- I
ent except to stiffen his muscles against
I the crushing force of Kahmo's embrace.
He needed time to think and also to re
cover his nerve, for an unspeakable fear
sat cold upon his heart. There must be
no haphazard work here; no blind ex
penditure of precious strength and endur
ance, and yet no dangerous loss of time.
The ape's terrible strength and the cun
ning, silence and daring with which he
had planned the attack appalled the help
less man. The steadiness and increasing
force of Kahrao'd grasp were straining the
prisoner's ribs, shortening his breath and
giving his head an ominous sensation of
i fullness.
Without in the least relaxing the pres
sure of his arms the oransr began to
squirm and struggle in an effort to reac i
Queltin's throat with his teeth. Discov
ering that he had taken his hold too low
even to reach the side of the burglar's
neck, the ape selected a convenient spot
In Queltiu'a shoulder and sank his strong
teeth through the clothing and into the
flesh. Queltin groaned. Then a "fierce
struggle began.
Miss Heckney, the woman who lived
alone in the suite above, was roused from
her light slumber by a deep groan, suc
ceeded by an irregular thumping. She lay
still a little while, then she sprang out of
bed, alarmed by a heavy fall. She realized
vaguely that something unusual was afoot
in the house, and an intense fear assailed
her. She tried bravely to reassure herself
with calm reasoning. Doubtless a
drunken man was being brought
home. The occasional groans might be
natural with a drunken man, but if there
was a struggle which meant murder it
couid not be so greatly prolonged without
cries. Despite all this reasoning her heart
beat with stifling force and rapidity. Fi
nally, being unable longer to control her
fears, she staggered from her bedchamber
into the front room, intending to open her
window and cry an alarm. This window
was a counterpart of the one below. On
raising the shade she was appalled by a
spectacle across the street. There, on a
blank white wall, illuminated from the
apartments of the lodger beneath her, Mr.
Martin, she saw moving shadows that held
her hand from the window-latch and
chained all her faculties of volition. Never
theless, she retained a clear recollection of
all that she saw, as will be seen from the
following intelligent testimony which she
gave before a Coroner's jury two days
afterward :
"The shadows as 1 saw them through
the glass wore so strange and frightful
that I did not have the strength to open
the window and call for help. At first
they were very large, Out as the objects
casting them neared the window they
dwindled in size, but to the last were gi
gantic and terrible.
"When 1 rirst saw them I supposed them
to have been cast by two men struggling
desperately in a close embrace. They were
so cl sely mingled and writhed so rapidly
that fora time i rould not distinguish
them, but at intervals there would be a
pause. Presently I discovered that one of
the shadows was that of a man of ordinary
proportions, anu that the other was ex-
tremely grotesque and ill-shaped. It was
shorter than the other. The head was
small and round, the forehead retreating,
the brows heavy and acgressive. the neck
very short, the arms prodigiously long and
the legs very short, sprawling and widely
bowed. This one ?eemed to be the stronger
of the two. He held the rear right side of
the other pressed close against his body,
and was evidently urging him toward tne
open window. The other seemed to be
aware of that purpose and wad struggling
to avoid being dragged thither and thrown
out.
"The short object evidently had a deep
hold in the man's shoulder with his teeth.
I could see him tug at the shoulder now
and then, and with each such effort the
man would groan. The short one seemed
to be tearing the other's flesh with his
teeth."
(At the recollection of this incident the
witness paled and came near fainting.
Presently she was able to proceed.)
"The taller one's legs were free but
whenever he would kick, the short one,
standing on one leg, would twine the other
round the tall one's legs and tug more
fiercely with his teeth at the shoulder.
That would cause the tall one to desist for
a time. In this way, inch by inch, they
readied the window. The final and hercest
struggle was there.
"A fall from the window to the stone
pavement meant death. The tall one
braced himself against the facing. Torn
from that he suddenly collapsed and both
rolled upon the floor. The shadows then
I became so foreshortened and confused that
I could make very little of what was goin"
on, but 1 inferred" that the shorter one was
i gradually working himself and the other
head forward over the sill. I Wf Â»s too
horrified to open my window and look j
down, or 1 could have seen them.
"I might hare done so, however, had it â¢
not been for a terrible cry of pain and fear I
that went abroad from ine straggling pair.
j It was the cry of a man in extreme agony!
Immediately afterward the dull impact of
a heavy body upon the sidewalk struck
my senses like a blow. A police whistle
sounded and I heard men running. At
that juncture I saw only one shadow on
the wall. It was that of the shorter object.
"My head was swimming and I was
Stirling. I frantically tore the window
open for the fresh, cold air. Below I saw
men kneeling over one lying on the ground.
One of them, a policeman, said. "His head
is wide open; no ambulance needed here.'
They said other things â something about
French Joe â but 1 didn't hear them dis
tinctly. They had been looking up at the
open window. I could see nothing there '
although I knew the short object was just
within, for I saw its shadow across the
street. I heard the footsteps of men ascend
ing the stairs.
"Then another shadow appeared. It
was that of a man dressed for bed. By its
decreasing size I knew tnat it was ap
proaching the window. The man seemed
to be staggering. When he had come
near the other turned, gave a plaintive
cry and threw his arm around nim in a
caressing embrace. The other patted him
affectionately, and then the short one
whined and cried like a child. The man,
holding the shorter one's head back,
said :
"Why, Kahmo, what is the matter? You
are bloody and you cry and tremble.
What has happened, Kahrao? My head is
bursting, and my throat is sore. Ah,
there's some one at the door !"

TAKING THE FENCE
DESPITE the popularity of tbe
bicycle and the preuictions we
â  card so frequently only a short
time ago there seems to be
a general reaction this spring
both East and West in favor of the horse.
Those enthusiastic wheel-lovers who were
so ready to predict that tne noble animal
had had his day and would soon become
an ornament or a curiosity seem to be a
little premature. The horse will never go
out of service as the friend and compan
ion of man's toils and pleasures until we
come ourselves to be mere machines and
utilitarians. And in particular will the
bicycle never supersede him. A mere
thing of rubber, wire and wind can never
take the place of the living, breathing, re
sponsive creature with a conscious intelli
gence, who enters into work or sport with
us and has a perfectly recognizable partic
ipation in all external things that concern
his rider. I have heard wheelmen talk of
their machines as though they were alive;
but I always have a feeling that in their
hearts they know better. And I never
heard a group of them together when the
talk was not of wheels and bars and
wrenches and tires, prices, repairs and
records. When will you hear equestrians
wasting time over such chatter? When
they talk horse, as we all of us love to do,
they have something alive 10 speak ofâ a
responsive, flesh and blood creature who
keeps his own bearings oiled, and as for
tires, why if you gain his love he is tire
less in your service.
Yes, despite predictions, the star of the
horse is again in the ascendant. The an
imals are bringing better prices. The bi
cycle craze has had the good effect of caus
ing breeders to raise fewer scrubs, and
there is just now quite a perceptible de
mand for tood saddle-horses.
The current issue of one popular mag
azine has an article anent women on
horseback, with illustrations that would
serve admirably as examples of how not
to ride.
The horse in motion| has always been
more or less of a poser for our artists.
John Sturgis, in his well-known painting,
"Not This Time," shows a horsewoman on
a hydrocephalic steed, that has just, ap
parently, refused a ditch, probably aware
of his physical infirmities, while in the
background careers another rider â a man
â whose horse, could he ever have got
GOING WELL.
[From a painting by Thomas Blinks.]
into such a position as the artist pictures,
could never by any possibility recover
himself. The artist's model for this draw
ing is not difficult to imagine. The por
trait is exactly that of the time-honored
wooden hobby-horse on rockers. In or
der to gather himself for his next stride, a
liorse in such an unfortunate position
would have to have a fifth leg in the mid
dle of his body. In the style of hobby
horse that moves on a spring such a ieg is
always supplied.
But it is in the portrayal of the horse
and rider in the act of leaping that our
picture-makers are oftenest betrayed into
absurdities.
As an explanation of what is amiss in
one picture here reproduced a brief glance
at what is involved in a leap may be in
order.
The problem presented is to get a rapidly
moving animal over a barrier with as little
danger to his rider and himself as possi
ble. A woman in the side-saddle has a
much firmer seat for leaping thtui a man
has; but in the event of her horse getting
a fall her perils are multiplied threefold
over those of the rider on the cross-saddle.
Coming at his fence at a moderate gallopâ
for a horse should never be allowed to
rush at any obstacle as it is the custom of
some riders to put their mounts at a bar â
the animal begins his leap with a quick
spring of the hind legs, which carries him
to the rise. If the rider is leaning back
ward or sitting too far back in the saddle
at this juncture she receives an impulse
from the powerful quarters tliat would be
pretty apt to unseat her.
As a matter of fact, however, the^ri^ing
of the horse brings the body of a good
rider quite involuntarily into an upright
position, and the balance and seat are
maintained, as in ordinary riding, by the
same instinctive clinging of thigh and
knee. The hands should be kept as close
as possible to the body, in order that they
may have room to "give" readily when the
horse thrusts forward his head in coming
down. At this stage of the leap the rider
must lean backward, in order to avoid
beitiE shot from the saddle by the concus
sion of the hind feet in landing. The reins
! should be held tightly and firmly, the
snafHe snujr, the curb more loosely, else
I the horse, fearing to thrust forward his
j head, may come down with a bounce upon
| all four feet at once, a proceeding most
I disconcerting to the rider and about as
j easy to sit as a "buck-jump.' 1
j A good leaper brings his forefeet first to
j the ground, the hind ones following in
j an instant, ready, if he has been kept well
i in hand, to go on his even way rejoicing.
i But if there has been any sawing at the
! curb, any undue restraint or rigidity on
the part of the rider, so that he has not
- had his head, to feel sure that no sharp,
j cutting curb is going to bruise his mouth
i if he obeys the natural instinct to stretch
his neck and preseive his balance, or to
thrust forward his head in recovering his
I stride, he may bring his hind feet down
I first, in which case I have known a rider
i to be rendered unconscious by the concus
! sion.
Now, keeping these points in mind, a
THE WAY A HORSE REALLY GALLOPS.
[From a drawing by Gray Parker.]
AS NO HORSE EVER GALLOPED.
[From a painting by John Sturges.]
pretty fair idea of what t*> avoid may be
gained from a study of the accompanying
reprint of a popular painting entitled
"Going Well," which, though a spirited
and taking picture, is a capital illustration
of how not to ride.
The artist has, to begin with, chosen an
unfortunate instant in the action. The
thrust of the hind leas in the running
jump is so instantaneous, they are gath
ered so immediately, that at the moment
the forefeet are in the poise here pictured
the stifle? are already flexed toward the
flanks. As it is, the beholder of this pic
tare becomes a prey, and the anxious
wonder whether the horse will bring his
hind leÂ»s with him when he lands on the
other side. One has a sense of hoping he
will prove adequate to the task laid upon
him, but it is a hope tempered by anxiety.
The rider, too, is leaning oackward, on the
rise, until the center of gravity of her
body seems to fall perilously without the
base, while she is evidently determined
that the horse shall not have his head if
she can help it. Else why that desperate
clutch, with outstretched arms, at curb
and snaffle? If her mount so far over*
comes his fear of the pressing curb as to
thrust out his nose and let her down easily,
the reins will either be jerked from her
hands or she will be dragged forward upon
his neck. In any event, the outlook for
the landing looks dubious for Doth horse
and rider.
To take that leap comfortably the lady
should be sitting so nearly perpendicular
with the ground that she would appear to
be leaning forward, and a line dropped
from her shoulder would fall down across
the blade of her horse's. Instead of her
arms being stretched out before her, the
elbows should be flexed, with hands, hold
ing the reins well gatnered, close to her
body. The left foot should be drawn very
slightly back, thrust well home in the
stirrup, with the left Knee pressed closely
against the third hoin, and the curb-rein,
should be a trifle relaxed.
But, if our artists have yet something to
learn about leaping, so, too, have riders.
It is an art in which our women are all
too inexpert, although there is nothing
that adds more to the pleasure of a gallop
across country than the ability to nut
your horse at a fence or bar instead of fid
ing miles out of your way in search of a
gate, which, unless your mount is unnsu
ally well trained, you must dismount and
open. Horses and riders both need train
ing for this exercise, for while some horses
jump naturally and with pleasure,
others understand the leap only
after careful teaching. It is, however,
an accomplishment they can easily
be taught, for most horses are willing and
anxious to do what their riders desire. la
that they differ greatly from the wheel,
which, it seems to me, is generally pos
sessed of a demon of perversity and takes
a malicious delight in landing its rider
where he does not desire to go. At all
events in the days of their more general
use we heard less of accidents through,
vicious noises than we now here of casu
alties from unmanageable wheels.
The wheelman must keep to the beaten
road or push his machine laboriously up
grades or through sand, must lift it over
fences and across streamsâ in a word, he is
the servant of his steed, which does for
him only within a very limited range.
And yet when I see half a dozen middle
aged men, gray-haired, bald-headed,
inclined to take on weight and additional
girth, speeding along the highway on tha
"silent shining safety" I am glad for this
renewal of their youth and the taste the
wheel affords them of out of door life and
pleasure. They have at last found the
next best thing to a horse.
But the bicycle, rival the horse as it
may, will never be beautiful. It will
never be alive. It will never be a pictur
esque feature in the landscape. One never
sees it in the landscape except leaning
as-ainst the rail at <% the half-way house,'
and it will never take a fence.

How to Get Famous in Congress.
Oratory is the shortest road to Congress
and if a man wants to stay in Congress
after he gets there he had better be an
orator than a reformer. In fact, the days
of the reformer are waning. Tne business
of reform has been so overdone and the
article has so often proved spurious that a
Congressman who indulges in it as stock
in trade is looked upon with suspicion.
If a Congressman is not an orator the
second best card for him to play is to get
the reputation of beiug a business man.

THE LION IN THE PATH
Joaquin Miller Talks to the Members of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union.
jk T the session of the tri-connty
J\ convention of the Women's
/\\ Christian Temperance Union,
/( held at Pacific Grove on Friday
evening, Joaquin Miller delivered
a lecture on "Prohibition." As might
have been expected, the poet treated the
question in an original and entertaining
manner. A full report of the lecture,
revised by Mr. Miller especially for The
Call, follows:
There is a difference between women
and menâ a wide difference â mentally,
morally, as well as physically. But what
woman loses in one thing she more
than makes up in another. What she
Jacks in weight she more than makes
up in fineness. W hat she lacks in strength
she more than mates up in true courage.
Woman is by far the braver of the two
sexes. True, man has kept the record of
his brave butcheries, and it is equally true
that he has credited all the courage to
himself. The one great soul that shed
more luster on the pages of French history
than even Napoleon the Great was a
woman, but men could not bear that.
They bound her to the stake. And so it
has been from the dawn of history, on
down past the shining example of Queen
Estherâ on down, flown, down to this age,
this day, this hour, to the head of this
movement â to Susan B. Anthony.
I have been in many wars, many hard
battles, but those -vere glorious, exciting
days and deeds. What so splendid, de
lightful as to dash into the fighi that can
last but a day at longest, and, end as it may
be, come victory or defeat, man has only
to bear himself bravely and leave the rest
to Him.
But it is the long, long fight, and alone,
such as that brave woman has made â the
fight of a lifetime for an ideaâ that is the
true test of courage. The cold neglect, the
cruel scorn, the defeat day after day, year
after year, from tbe dawn of womanhood
o the verge of the grave, the cowardly
faltering of men who promise one thing
and perform another, weak men who pre
fer popularity to principle â this it is that
makes woman's lifelong battles so terrible.
Woman as a rule instinctively knows
what is right and she generally dares to do
it. Man, by reason as a rule, knows what
is right and often is afraid or forgets to do
it. lam sorry, ashamed of him, but I did
not make hini. "Male and female created
"Vie them."
It is this patient persistence of woman
that shows the true steel, that requires a
higher and a holier type of courage than
man has ever shown -with all his bloody
butcheries. Woman's courage is the
courage of Jesus Christ, who said, ''Put up
thy sword into its place," and so was led
away to contumely and crucifixion. Shall I
tell you where you wilJ find the bravest
battle-field in all history?
The bravest battle that ever was fought,
Shall I tell you where and when?
On the maps of th- world you will find It not;
It was fought by the mothers of men.
Nay. not with cannon or battle shot.
With sword or with nobler pen:
Nay, not with wonderful word or thought,
From mouths of eloquent men.
But deep in a walled- up woman's heart,
A woman that would not yield.
But patiently, silently boreher pan;
Lo, there is that battlefield.
No marshaling troop, no bivouac song,
No banners to gleam and wave,
And ah. these battles they last so long,
From baoyhood to the grave.
The bravest act I ever Baw was the act
of a woman, and you must know I have
seen many brave deeds and seen many
brave men. Tne bravest of all, perhaps,
was my Quaker father. This man lived j
seventy-two years in the wilderness, al- i
ways among wild beasts and wilder men ; I
yet he never learned how to either load or
fire a gun. He never raised his hand
against anything or spoke one cross word
even to the dumb brutes.
True, this is not the Bort of courage that
appeals most loudly, but it is the loftiest,
truest and most Christlike courage to be
found under the sun. And so this little
story of a woman's brave deed will not
strike you as remarkable.
We were 200 miles from the nearest post- I
office, in the heart of the wilderness, and '
surrounded by savages. We had almost I
daily battles ; nearly every day some one i
of our 2000 men "was killed or maimed.
But this little quiet story is not of men or
of battles, but of a woman â the preacher's
wife. Do you know anvthingof the old
customs of the border? "Of the preacher,
the preacher who must always preach the
funeral sermon? No matter who died, or
where, or how, there must be a funeral
sermon. To this day my mother, who is
with me, asks, when one of the old neigh- |
bors dies up in Oregon, "Who preached
the funeral sermon?"
One bright spring day, after a sudden
rainstorm, a poor abandoned woman, who !
had been caring for the wounded all night, i
and now was drinking again, started to i
walk across the roaring creek on a foot- I
log from one saloon to another. Half-way i
she stopped, turned, tried to cross back I
to co forward, but at last, with a wild cry ]
of despair, threw up her hands and fell, '
to be picked up by the miners miles I
below. They picked the willow twigs from !
her cold hands and the grasses from her <
hair, smoothed her wet dress, folded !
the poor hands and, having made such a i
coffin as they could, brought her back up
to the great log house, wuich served as a
fort, arsenal, courthouse and church, for
the funeral Bermon. She had been good
good to the wounded, good to the sick,
good to everybody but herselfâ but she
was what the world calls badâ badâ the
only woman in the town at that time,
except the preacher's young wife.
They went to get the preacher to presch
Ihe sermon after they had dug the' grave
upon the hill, but the preacher would not
Mi They came after me to go and urge I
him to say a few words over the poor, lone
dead woman, and I with some others
went to him. He was a good man, but he
Baid: "No; it will do her no good and
will injure the cause of the new church "
The yonng wife urged him to go.
"No, no. She was desperate, wicked.
Let her death be an example. That is
bestâ best for the living and all the same
now to tbe dead."
"Then I will go!"
"What! you. Mary? If you must go,
go; and never come back to me."
She did not say one word. She caught
up some wild flowers from tbe mantel as
she hurried out and on up to the place
where the dead lay among the men, and
in such haste that we could scarcely keep
up with her. And she passed right in, I
down through the dense crowd that gave
way to let her pass, and she fell on her
knees at the foot of the box, and ail the men
held their heads low as she silently
prayed, and then she got up, and as she
moved up to the head of the dead woman
her husband stood in the door. She
heeded nothing, no one, but tenderly laid
the flowers on the dead girl's breast.
Then, as she leaned over and kissed the
cold and despised woman the men began
to cry like children. I don't know why
they cried so, but they ail cried together,
though she never said one word. And the
preacher came softly to her side and,
turning to the men, "said: "Forgive me!
I came to preach the sermon, but she has
preached it. Take up the dead and let us
allgo to the grave together."
He was a good man, a brave, good man;
but who was the braver, who saw the rigbt
road to the hearts of the miners, the duty
to the living and the dead more clearly,
tie woman or the man?
Wo were a mixed lot in the mines.
There was a great, big Enelisbman. who
afterward grew very rich in New Zealand.
V\ c met long after in London and talked
of old times. We talked of women. Men
will talk of women sometimes, when
they have no norses, and I told
him the women of California, were
going to vote some day. He tooK his
cigar out of his teeth and said: "Bosh!
The.only people that ever knew how to
handle woman were the Turks. They
locked her up, and if she did not like
that they put a few of her into a sack and
threw it over the side of a boat."
I agreed with him at that time. But
one of the few advantages the American
man has over the Englishman and a mule
is the possibility of changing his mind.
LÂ»st spring my old English friend came
up from Australia.
"Well, women got it in New Zealand â
got suffrage in spite of us all," he said,
the first thing.
"And how do you like it?''
"Detestable! Ruins political business â
dull as a meat ax. Why, the elections
used to be all carried on in the saloons and
money flowed like water. Now all a can
didate has to do ia to go among the wo
men, have clean habits and good manners
and he is elected. Of course it's cheaper
for the towns; don't cost half as much to
run a town as before. Some make more in
the end. But sport is ruined. An election
down there is like a California flower
show."
Now, this is the testimony of a man who
has made a fortune in liquors â a good
man, truthful, honest, my friend. He
says in substance the machinery of elec
tions has been transferred from the dead
falls to the family fireside; that power has
passed from the politician to the sacred
keeping of woman; that it don't cost half
as much to run a town as it did, but that
the liquor business on election days is dull.
Well, if woman can take the place of tue
politician in any part of Australia she can
do it in California. If woman can by her
better influence run the towns in Califor-

nia at half what it costs now, in heaven's
name let her do it. It is not only her
right to do it, it is her duty to do it. I
shall vote for woman suffraee. I am a
new convert, but a true one. I was afraid
this new privilege wouW drag women
down. But we see it is lifting men up,
and if there is anything under the sun
that will lift us up out of the political gut
ters of California let us have it, and let us
have it now
I assume that this august gathering
means action â figuratively speaking, a
fight ; and I assume that you are not going
to fight for fun, . but for victory. I want
you to fight and I want you to win.
Therefore let me first tell you of the
strength and the position of our friends,
the enemy ; let me tell; you the strength
of the lion in your path.
When I was ttrst in Paris I saw a woman
there, a lion-tamer, exhibit the magnificent
king of beasts in harness. He was hitched
to a chariot in which she rode around and
around in the circus with her children.
True, he waÃ chained across the j forearms
and the hinder parts, so that he could do
no great harm but he was made to think
that that was a part of the beautiful glit
tering gold harness, and it was all right.
Now, you women may just as well as not
harness up man if , you will be wise. : But
that is another story. â¢-
To begin with, it is a fact that California,
the men of California, are rather fond of
women. They always have been. It is
their weaknessâ their strength. â¢â 
I repeat, I take it you are here to fight,
figuratively, and I take it you are to fight
for victoryâ not for noise nor for renown,
but for victory and the good of humanity."
Well, victory is yours, if you will have it
so. If . you will only be wise, half as wise
as that little French woman in; Paris, you
can not only harness the lion in your path,
but have him haul you all around the
circus.
Now, I want woman suffrage in Califor
nia, but there is a lion in the path, a
power that you must harness to your use
or provoke to strife and your own destruc
tion. Let me tell you a few facts. Your '
august and earnest boay ia gathered here !
in the American 'â  Italy. You are in the i
land of the vine and the fig tree. Have i
you any real idea of the vast industry
here in the grape fields? -
At Heidelberg, . as many of you have
seen, there is a wine cask that holds 47 000 j
gallons of wine. This cask is still, as it !
has been for generations, the wonder and
admiration of all the Old World. Forty
seven thousand gallons of wine! Did ever
j you see or hear of anything like : that
|in all America? I think not. I doubt if
one in fifty of yon ever heard of anything
like a cask in America | capable of holding
47,000 gallons of wine, or even half that
amount. Yet in Fresno, where 1 went last
week to get some â¢; facts about this lion in
the . path, I was shown casks that held
not only 47,000 gallons of wine, but
nfty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, and
even up as high as ninety-four thousand
gallons, and I was told of a cask further

What will : you , do with him? Harness
him to your service â or make him "as a
lion roused" ?
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
Napoleon always first pierced the center.
He first split the army in two and then
thrashed this side and then that.
Now deceive no one, least of all your
selves. But if you want to put yourselves
in position to handle the affairs of this
State, as I hope you will, you will not
fight the lion in your path till you have
the power to fight with in your own
hands. You will rather say with Mrs.
Browning, " 'Twere imbecile" hewing out
roads to a wall." However brave it may
sound to say "Fight on and on and oh
and fall and perish in the ruins," it is not
good sense and it does no good to be cruci
fied unless you are saviors.
I am not here to advise. lam here to
tell you some blunt truths, and I tell you
that if you were to dig up every vine in
California to-morrow, flood and make red
with wine every river and lake in Califor
nia, next year the vines would grow again,
and the next and the next, though you
should destroy them the next and "the
next, and they would grow and glow in
the sun of California above your graves
in a little time the same as if you had never
been.
God made this hot sun and God made
that soil, and the grapes will grow and the
wine will flow as long as this sun and soil
endures, although, as John Hayes says,
"you resolute till the cows come home."
There is your first great lion. What will
you do with him?
True, now and then a wine-grower feels,
as perhaps half of you do, that "wine is a
mocker and strong drink ia raging," and
so bravely plows up his last grapevine and
plants something else.
When I lectured at Napa not long since
a well-to-do farmer was pointed out to me
who had plowed up his last grapevine only
the year before. He had become converted
while listening to the Salvation Army,
and he went home and told his wife, and
they both joined the church, and they not
only plowed up the last vine but they actu
ally emptied the last cask of wine "on the
premises, for they were rich and not under
the bond of mortgage. They would not
even sell it. These two truly Christian
converts did not want â would not touch â
money that was made by furnishing in
toxicating drinks.
Having plowed up the grapes from
which wine was made, they planted hops
and barley and made more money than
before. They sold them to make beer
out of!
And here do you not see the paws and
the nose of another, a more terrible lion,
in the path? Here are the great brewer
ies, tne great rye and barley fields, the
great hop fields. Consider the unem
ployed, consider the ruined homes, con
sider the desert you would make of Cali
fornia. And cvi bono? Do you- not see
how terriDly you tax the gallantry of Cali
fornia now when you say, "Give us suf
frage, so that we can espouse prohibition"?
Very easy it would be to talk loud and
taik long, as we nave all heard very good
people do in denouncing and damning the
wine and the wine industries, but such
talk is out of date. This would be to in
sult some of the best and most honest
common sense in the United States gath
ered here to-day.
Now therÂ« is a third lion. He is lying
in the jungle farther on. He is not so big,
not so devouring, but he is terrible in bat
tle. The wine-merchant, the iiquor-deaier,
if you please, tne saloon-keeper. Did you
ever see and know a saloon-keeper, his wife,
children? I mean the respectable saloon
keeper, not the keeper of a "deadfall." I
was Judge of a city of saloons, where
that poor woman was drowned. I had
to accept their bonds and give their license.
I knew each one, his character, often his
history. Well, in the first place a coward
cannot keep a saloon. A stingy man has
no custom. A saloon-keeper must be the
"sober Injun." So you see the saloon
keeper is a cool, sober, open-handed de
termined man, "a sober, cool, determined
villain," if you insist, but he is the third
lion before you, and he is the hardest
tighter of the three. He is organized, he
is rich, he is relentless in war. Are you,
who want to vote and who ought to vote,
going to rouse this lion also?
I invoke you, harness one, two, all three
of these lions, gird them in trappings of
gold, as you can, and you shall ride in
such a chariot in the coming California
circus as you never dreamed of; or go
around these lions in your path, as you
can, and let them sleep as did the- women
of New Zealand, but arouse them, then
face and tight them and you will be "smit
ten hip and thigh," you will be torn to
pieces, you will be so torn to shreds and
tatters that there will not be left to you
even a piece of petticoat biir enough for
you to make a flag out of for the next
battle.
Send everything but the one central idea
behind you, as did the women of New
Zealand. Pay no attention to the prayers
and pieadingsot timid men or ax-grinding
cranks. They are Jonahs, throw them
over and sailon, and on, and on, straight
on, as did Columbus, in spite of prayers
and tears to set up the cross and say mass
for help in the middle of the sea.
"Time enough," said he in answer, "to
set up the cross and say mass when on
solid land."
Behind him lay the gray Azores,
Behind the pates of Hercules;
Before him not the gliost of shores,
Before him only shoreless seas.
The good mate said : "Now must we pray,
For lo! the very stars are zone.
Brave adm'rl, speak; what shall I say?"
"Why, say, "Sail ou ! sail on! and on!"*
'â¢My men grow mutinous day by day;
My men grow ghastly, wan and weak."
The stout mate thought of home; a spray
Of sst'.t wave washed his swarthy cheek.
"What shall I say, brave adm'rl, say,
If we sight naught but seas at dawn?"
"Why. you shall say at break of day,
'Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on! "
They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow,
Unttl at last the blanched mate saia:
"Why, now not even God would know
should I and all my men fall dead.
Thi'se very winds forget their way,
For Qod from these dread seas Is gone.
Now speak, brave adm'rl; speajc and say â â "
He said: "Sail on! sail on! and on!"
They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:
This mad sea shows his teeth to-night.
He curls his lips, he lies in wait,
\V ith lifted teeth, as If to bite !
\?-\. c adm>rl i say but one good word;
\\ hat shall we do when Hope is gone ?"
l fie words leapt as a leaping sword :
"Sail on! sail on! gallon! and on!"
And now one word to the honest and
earnest Prohibitionists, men and women
of the faith to which I was bornâ for I see
lam called to speak to about half the al
phabet and so must scatter like a shotgun
to hit half the game. I do not advise; I
only tell you what I would do.
I "would suppress about one-half the
saloons, or at least all the dark "dead
falls, in order that we might have the
better open and outdoor resorts, as in
Germany. This you will find will meet
the approval of "all our best wine mer
chants. I would do this for their good as
well as the good of the public; just as I
would suppress at least half the news
papers, in order that we might have some
lew reasonable and respectable.
I was a "teetotaler," but in Europe I
learned to use wine after a year or two of
effort, for it is the milk of Italy, and in
nearly a dozen years abroad I never saw
but one drunken man in Italy, and that
man was an American. In the remote
mountain towns wine and blackbread and
blackbread and wine make the staple of
food. The wine there is trodden out by
the bare feet of women, as in the old Bible
days. I did not like to drink this wine at
hrst. It seemed to me that it was not
clean, but one day I saw them at their I
work of treading in the wine press, and I j
noticed that they all, from the biggest to
the least, washed their feetâ washed them
carefully, after they got done treading out
the wine.
It would be on my conscience did I not ad
mit that I always have wine on my table
and hope I always shall. In fact, phy
sicians say that if they could get people to
drink wine, as in italy, we would have as
little drunkenness here as there.
Now as between the man who takes "a
little wine for his stomach's sake" and the
man who will not "look upon the wine
when it is red," you may have your
preference, I may h.ive mine. There may,
in truth, be as many degrees of temperance
as creeds in Christianity. The broad Chris
tian accepts all creeds; the broad temper
ance man is glad of temperance in any
form and under any flag, only so that it
goes forward and forward for the better
ment of man to the final round-up. Some
men will have only prohibition. Each has
a right to his creed.
Now, shall I tell you bluntly the cause
of increasing intemperance among our
rich and poor people in America? Bluntly,
our poor and rich people have caught a
fatal disease from the gay and luxurious
French of Paris â a disease that makes
them desperateâ a disease that drives them
to drunkenness, deathâ often death by
their own hands, for ours is the land of
suicides.
And what is the fatal French disease
that is driving us to drunkenness â death
by our own hands?
High up on the portal walis of Paris and
over their temple doors the French once
emblazoned this mad lie: "There is no
God! Death ia an eternal sleep." And
although this has been obliterated from
the walls and temple doors it still festers
in the heart of every gay Parisian. He
cries out in the night: "There is no God.
Death is an eternal sleep, and since death
ends all I will 'eat, drink and be merry,'
for to-morrow I die."
This is the fatal disease the poor rich
people of America have caught from the
gay French of foolish Paris. Our rich and
traveled people will not be outdone by
Parisians, even in atheism. They, too, cry
out, "There is no God; death is an eternal
sleep: therefore I, too, will eat, drinK and
be merry, for to-morrow I die." But can
any law, prohibition or otherwise, reach
the poor rich in America? "More than
10,000 suicides and homicides last year,"
said the Superintendent of Schools for
California last month at Los Angeles.
And aid you ever hear of a suicide who
was a Christian? Did you ever hear of a
suicide who was a true Mussulman? Did
you ever hear of a suicide who was a true
Indian? 1 never knew or heard of a Mus
sulman who committed suicide. I never
Knew or heard of one who was not certain
of another and a better world. I never
knew of an Indian in all my intercourse
with them who committed suicide, and I
never knew one who was not certain of im
mortality. He read it in the resurrection
of the little seeds that fell from the trees
into the hollow of God's hand. He read
it in the resurrection of the great, dead,
yellow year that had laid down in its
shroud of snow, awaiting the roaring
month of March to trumpet through the
pines and waxen it again and garment it
and garland it in foliage and in flames.
And he never knew one doubt till the
white man came to put aside nis book of
nature and try to teach him from another
book.
Go teach the rich man, whom no law
can reach, the truths of immortality and
you will teach him temperance. I care
not, so far as results co, whether you teach
him the immortality of the Turk, I care
not whether you teach him the immortal
ity of the Theosophist, the Indian or the
Christian, only teach him that he is not a
Chinaman, to'be blown out like a candle,
and you will save him from dissipation,
drunkenness, death.
And here is where and why woman
must be the savior of the world. Woman
by herself, alone, un warped by man,
knows, knows as Socrates knew, that she
ia immortal. Is there one unbelieving
woman to one hundred unbelieving men?
There is not one to a thousand if left to
her own finer senses unbiased by the
luxuries and the follies of man. She
knows, she knows!
True, there have been, there are, great
women, blinded by the books of men, who
willingly walk in darkness and doubt be
cause â because it is counted brave, bright,
Parisian; and yet in their heart of hearts
they know better. They naturally, like
the Indian, read immortality in the book
of nature.
But how are you to reach the poor rich
young men of America? How can you
earnest women reach these younÂ« men,
who, as a rule, are ashamed of their
fathers, who were hewers of wood and
drawers of water? Each man's house is
his castle. May not each rich man make
his house a wine cellar if he pleases? You
may prohibit ana prohibit and yet your
laws would be only straws in the wind.
You have got to reach these men as Jesus
reached the hearts of men â by love, not by
legislation; by lessons from the lilies of
the field; by the continual lesson of im
mortality from the eternal book of nature.
Go to the rich drunkard or atheist, the
same thing in the end, with the Book in
your hand. If he is on his deathbed and
he knows he is on his deathbed, he may
listen to you; if he is not on his deathbed
he will politely laugh at you and ask you
how you know it is God's book. Drop the
Book and take up a leaf, a flower, a blade
of grass â for every blade of grass is a saber
waving in the wind, battling for God and
truth and immortality â say to him, "Here,
whatever that book may be, this is His
work. This, this little dusty downtrodden
blade of grass is God's work, and all the
genius arid wit and industry and learning
of all the men that have ever lived never
dared dream of making even so much as a
single blade of grass of all the grasses that
carpet the earth for the feet of unbelieving
man."
And behold how beautiful, how miracu
lously, indescribably beautiful this one
little blade of grass, that has seen the
resurrection and has risen to testify to im
mortality! I would point to the little
flowers on the fervid foothills, the sapphire,
the snow white, the poppies garmented in
gold ; and on up, up to the chaparral sing
ing with busy brown bees, and on up
to the pines, the tsmaract, the spruce,
the cedar, the juniper, the sequoia;
on up, on up to the rock - built
battlements of the Sierras; on, on up
to where the snow-clad pyramids prop the
porch of heaven with tneir icy helmets,
and on, and on, and on to where the ever
lasting stones burn incense perpetually on
God's altar, lighting the way for souls to
the endless worlds beyond. Believe me,
the haven of the great ship of Temperance
is not in Law but Love; Faith and Hope
and Charity. These three are the Fortu
nate Isles in our mad sea of doubt, dark
ness, death.
One variety of the cricket has its ears in
its hind legs.
PROF. GEORGE
DAVIDSON`S
RECOLLENTIONS
OF
WEBSTER AND CLAY
MEN who listened in the halls of
Congress to the utterances of
Webster and Clay in the first
half of the present century are
very few indeed at the present
day, and soon these giants of debate, who
thrilled the country and made their influ
ence felt through the civilized world, will
find no longer any dwelling place in
the personal reminiscences of the living.
The time is rapidly approaching when
men shall vainly seek for one who could
say, "I have been an awed listener to the
ereat expounder of the constitution, and I
have been charmed with the eloquence of
his famous sometime rival â the man who
made 'the Slashes' known beyond the
boundaries of Virginia."
Among the few in the West whose for
tune and privilege it was to have seen and
heard both Webster and Clay during the
closing years of their services in the coun
cils of the Nation is Professor Georere
Davidson. Chauncey Depew's recent visit

to this City and his after-dinner speech at
the Palace recalled to Professor Davidson
with some vividness no less a celebrity
than Henry Clay.
"I have listened spellbound to an ad
dress by Henry Clay," said the distin
guished scientist. "He was truly a most
captivating speaker and he held audiences
for hours by the charms of his oratory.
Now, Mr. Depew belongs to the old Clay
school â he must be seen and heard to be
appreciated.
"Depew interests yon from start to
finish, and you imagine that you could sit
and listen to him all night. Take up the
morning paper containing a verbatim re
port of that address, however, and you are
actually led to wonder what there
was in it to have moved you
to admiration and applause. I
sat one atternoon enthralled by the flow of
eloquence from the lips of Clay; yet when
I went home I could not recall one of his
utterances, and when I read the report of
the speech I was much disappointed and
was unable to discover much real value
in it.
"The old Clay type of orator is very
rare now. To-day the vast reading public
is best acquainted with statesmen and
great speakers through the medium of the
press. The sentences of a statesman.
therefore, cannot depend upon the charm

and grace of delivery for their effect; they
must be framed with the foreknowledge
that a nation will anaiyze the oration and
weigh it for what it is worth in solid wis
dom.
"Webster lacked those easy graces which
were characteristic of Clay. With Web
ster it was matter more than manner.
Webster didn't fascinate like Clay. I felt
when 1 heard him that a great solemnity
had settled over all. I was a very young
man at the time, but I was deeply im
pressed, and when I went away at the
conclusion of the speech I had a good
conception of its meaning and remem
bered many of his arguments. After
hearing Webster one felt impelled to read
the report of the speech, and the reading
was as interesting as the delivery. Web
ster, speaking to Congress, spoke to all
time. Clay held his audiences completely ;
but the streneth of most of Clay's speeches
was gone when they appeared in cold
type."
Davidson was a student in the Philadel
phia High School, and took advantage of
the opportunity of hearing Webster in his
campaign speeches for General Harrison
in 1840. The commanding figure, the
massive head, the face telling of power,
and the deep-el ested voice that added
force to strong sentences, he remembers
well.
He heard Clay while the latter was the
recognized leader of the Whig party in
1841-42, and during the time the Clay land
bill and the same statesman's proposed
amendment to limit the veto power of the
President v,-ere subjects of warm discus
sion. Clay, tall, graceful, with a counten
ance as expressive as it was intellectual,
won his way to the hearts of people by the
magnetism of his personality.
Professor Davidson did not venture a
comparison of Webster with any modern
statesman or orator. Like Demosthenes,
or like Napoleon, the author of the "Lib
erty and Lnion" speech has a place all by
himself. But there is something new in
the comparison of the brilliant Henry
Clay and the delightfully interesting
Chauncey Depew.
Webster's speeches, all the world agrees,
Â«re masterpieces of literature, and time
proves more and more that the effect of
his speeches was immeasurably beyond
the audiences and occasions of their de
liverance. The suffering Cubans, were
Webster in the flesh, would have a mighty
friend in him. Webster's celebrated
Greek speech, in fact, may serve now
almost as an appeal in behalf of the
people wbo are striving to shake off the
Spanish yoke. Here is an extract:
"Sir, I am not of those who are for with
holding aid when it is not urgently needed,
and when the stress is past and the aid no
longer necessary overwhelming the suffer
ers with caresses. I will not stand by and
see my fellow-raan drowning without
stretching out a hand to help him until
he has, by his own efforts and presence of
mind, reached the snore in safety and
then incumber him with aid. With suffer
ing Greece now is the crisis of her fate,
her great, it may be her last, struggle.
Sir, while we sit here deliberating her des
tiny may be decided. The Greeks, con
tending with ruthless oppressors, turn
their eyes to us and invoke us by their an
cestors ; by their slaughtered wives and chil
dren ; by their own blood, poured out like
water; by the hecatombs of dead they have
heaped up, as it were, to heaven, they in
voke, they implore us for some cheering
sound, some look of sympathy, some
token of compassionate regard. They look
to as as the great republic of
the earth, and they ask us, by our
common faith, whether we can forget that
they are struggling, as we once struggles
for what we now so happily enjoy ? I cannot
say, sir, that they will succeed; that rests
with heaven. But for myself, sir, if i
should to-morrow hear that they have
failed â that their last phalanx had gone
down beneath the "Turkish cimetar,
that the flames of their last city
had sunk in ashes, and that naught
remained but the wide melancholy waste
where Greece once was, I should still
reflect, with the most heartfelt satisfac
tion, that I have asked you in the name
of seven millions of freemen, that you
would give them at least the cheering of
one friendly voice."
But Henry Clay, as the foremost advo
cate of the American system of protec
tion, has an immortal place, thoueh in a
iower niche than Webster, in the Nation's
temple of historic fame. His speeches oa
the American system will always bo
studied by political students, who will
picture to themselves the effect that must
have been carried by the magic of his
voice, when he shot forth such periods a^
these, that statesmen are to-day repeating
ia the halls of Congress:
"When gentlemen have succeeded in
this design of an immediate or gradual de
struction of the American system what is
their substitute ? Free trade ! Free trade !
The call for free trade is as unavailing as
the cry of a spoiled child in its nurse's
arms for the moon or the stars that glitter
in the firmament of heaven. It never
has existed, it never will exist. Trade im
plies at least two parties. To be free it
should be fair, equal and reciprocal. But
if we throw our ports wide open to the
admission of foreign productions free of all
duty, what ports of any foreign nation
shall we find open to the free admission of
our surplus produce? We may break
down all barriers to free trade on our part,
but the work will not be complete until
foreign powers shall have removed theirs.
There would be freedom on one side and
restrictions, prohibitions and exclusions
on the other. The bolts and the bars and
the chains of all other nations will remain
undisturbed."

ernment branches which has cJaimed for

for a device for tipping his nat. How he

mm â¢ - - . .A DEATH VALLEY
ELOPEMENT
DEATH VAIiLBY is the last I
p!ace in the world where one
would look for a romance, and
yet the desolate alkali pit in
Inyo County was lately the
ecene of the most thrilling kind of love
etory. There was no romantic element
lacking in the little life drama. The
yearning maiden, the fairy prince, love at
first sipht. the irate father and a daring
-elopement all combined to bring matters
to a climax in the marriage of Walter
Newton and Carrie Jeffery in Los Angeles
about four weeks ago.
To teil the story it will be necessary to
take a brief look backward about twenty
years to the time when John Jeffery was a j
prosperous merchant in Louisville, Ky.
lie had accumulated a fortune before he
was 30 year? old and married the daueh
tcrof a prominent statesman. The bride
Jooked forward to a life of happiness, as
Jeffery was a kind, indulgent husband,
and nothing seemed wanting to make it
so. But in less than two years, and before
little Carrie was born, Jeffery had become
almost crazy on the subject of lost mines
in California. He could speak of nothing
else, and in spite of his wife's protests that
they had more than enough money to
keep them in luxury the rest of their lives
he started off after selling out his business
and investing a large portion of his for
tune in Government bonds.
Jeffery wrote one letter home after reach
ing San Francisco, and then nothing was
beard of him for two years. He came to
Bee hi 9 wife and child, but was a changed
man. The gold fever had its grin on him,
and he only remained a few days and
started for the desert again.
During the next eight years he made
only three brief visits to his family in
Louisville, and on the last said that he
had built them a home near h'u mine and
that they should live there with him. He
was sure he had found the location of a
long-lost mountain of gold and would
soon be the richest man in the world.
Mrs. Jeffery did not line the peculiar,
nervous clare in her Husband's eye when
he was telling of his mines and describing
how an old Indian wizard had guided him
to the right spot. But she was a Southern
woman with exalted ideas of a wife's duty,
and hurried over her preparations for de
parture without asking any questions.
Where he went it wiis her duty to follow,
she felt, but her wildest imaginings and
dread misgivings never conjured up one
hundredth part of the hardships and dan
gers she was doomed to pass through. She
had visited some of the coal mines in In
diana-, and thought, perhaps, her new
home wouM be somewhat similar. The
influences would not be desirable and the
opportunities for the education and train
ing of l'>-year-old Carrie would be lacking,
but as she had been told to buy anything
she wished and take as much as she
wanted she felt that she could overcome
many difficulties.
The trip across the continent and down
through California was novei and pleas- '
ant, and when Los Angeles was reached
the anxious mother was feeling more hope- :
ful. As a great many household articles
were needed, Jeffery had decided to buy (
them at Los Angeles and make the rest of
the journey by wagon.
It was a ten days' trip over seeminsrly
endless miles 01 blinding desert wastes, j
and when a sione house, standing close to j
a cliff on the edge of Death Valley, was '
reached the mother was r.earlv wild with I
iear.
The location of the house had been care- I
fully selected. It was not far from Furnace !
Creek and about half a mile from the road
Blong the eastern side of the valley. It i
0 concealed behind cliffs that it'could j
not be seen from any direction until one i
was quite close to it. A thousand feet i
south of the house-, just within the mouth i
of a small canyon, was a spring of good
water babbling among the hot rocks. The
house itself was comfortable enough, but I
the surroundings were desolate in the ex
treme. No -pot of green to rest the eye
no matter in which direction one looked, j
Only tne white glaring sand of Death Val
ley and the distant mountains quivering
through the heat.
Mrs. Jeffery and Carrie had suffered
agonies on the trip and were nearly pros
trated. The awful heat and dry, burning"
desert winds had cracked their lips and
their faces, and hands were swollen and
blistered. The mother had expected some
sort of settlement and a few servants at
' They Started Across the Desert as Soon as th c Sun Had Set."
ea3t. In both she was disappointed, and
eVen the teamsters went away as soon as
they had unloaded the piles of household
goods.
It was an awful day when mother and
dauchter fonod â  themselves i alone in the
cheerless house, with the hot wind whist
ling around it. But it was only the begin
ning of eightlong years of hardships. Jef
fery's mines were in a wild canyon about
five miles from the house, and" spent
most of his time there. Frequently he
.would be absent for several days. .When
at home he seldom spoke and he daily be
came more morose.
â  Nothing that could be obtained was
wanting in the little household. Jeffery
made arrangements with a man at Keeler
to come to ihe house once a month and
bring such things as were needed and take
orders, for more. They had all the deli
caciesthat could be transported to the
region and also all of the latest books and
magazines, v Jc-ff ry felt.tuatHf. vis.wife

things, for she 2ducatPd:.Carrie^and kept'
her -dressed "in* pretty ~ and' ."..becoming"
clothes. Her met.od Â of â keepine the
l"juse was as nearly like her. own home *Â» i
the circumstances would permit. For the
first three years she made no complaint of
her distasteful lot and never even wrote to
her friends of the awfully desolate place in
which she lived. But when she saw Carrie
growing up and beine deprived of so many
advantages of civilization she felt re
bellious and ventured a mild protest to
her husband. He iiew into a passion at
the idea of allowing them to go away even
for a short time.
From that day he became almost brutal
in manner. He read all the letters before
they were sent and a large vein of vicious
ness seemed to break out in his nature.
His mine, of course, did not turn out as he
wished and he vented the wrath of his dis
appointment on his wife and daughter.
There was no pleasure in life for either of
them and by the time Carrie was 16 years
old she felt the injustice of being com
pelled to pass her days amid such uncon
genial surroundings and entreated her
father to let herself and mother go away,
if only for a little while. This only added
to his fury and many times he became so
enraged that he threatened their lives.
Mother and daughter frequently contem
i plated escape, but always gave up the idea
after turning over in their minds the awful
dangers of the venture. They did not
know the way across the desert sands and
besides the "only horses about the place
I were two old creatures who could do little
j more than carry them. Jeffery had a fine
THE "OLD, OLD STORY."
animal, but he used it all the time and
seldom if ever let it out of his sight.
Visitors never came to the stone house
on the edge of the desert as the road ran
some distance to the west.
As time went on mother and daughter
occasionally contemplated suicide. so un
i bearable became their lot. Jeffery grew
suspicious, and to make things as unbear
able as he could he hired an old Indian to
act as spy and see that his wife and daugh
! ter did not leave him. The Indian was a
miserable wretch, who would r.ot have
hesitated to commit murder. He did his
I duty so well that mother ana daughter
were kept in constant fear of their lives.
Things daily became more and more un
pleasant, and Mrs. Jeffery's health began
to fail to such an extent that she threat
ened to break down.
This was the state of affairs about the
first of last March, just after Carrie had
passed her nineteenth birthday. As
Jeffery's mines had failed to turn out as
he expected he concluded to send the
Indian spy for the old wizard who had
guided him to the locality to tell him what
was wrong.
It BO happened that the morning the In
dian left, Walter Newton, a professor of
geology in a Pennsylvania university,
came upon the Jeffery spring and after
drinking lay down beside it to rest. At
this moment Carrie came for a buctcet of
water. She almost lost breath at the sight
of a stranger and Walter thought he must
be dreaming when he saw a pretty young
girl in a white muslin dress trimmed with
pink ribbons standing before him.
It did not take them long to get ac
! q u aimed and before the day was over ,
Walter had met Mrs. Jeffery'and heard
I most of the story of the cheerless lives of the
; two women. He wanted to stay there and
i have a talk with Jeffery as soon as he came
i fron ' J 1 "! mine, b ut Carrie feared her father
. would kill luni and induced him to lea.ye.
V\ alter went back to his party a few miles
south and told them that he had discov
ered some interesting indications in a cer- !
tain canyon and intended to make a thor
i ough investigation. He promised to join
j the party in a week or so.

; were somewhat, different. They felt like i
! old friends, and somehow Carrie had for
i gotten all about Her desire to leave the i
desolate reeion.
Walter had made up his mind simply I
for humanity's sake to help the two
1 women, and commenced his plans at once.
i He found out all about the Indian spy',
and fairly boiled with rage at the idea. He
also discovered a deep canyon about a '
mile from the Jeffery house where he
I could stay at night and avoid danger of
being seen in the daytime. Another i

had to keep out of sight when Jeffery was I
about, but still he managed to see a good
deal of Carrie and her mother.
It was a week before the Indian re
turned, saying that the wizard could not
come until the next moon. Jeffery at
once started for bis mine, and in less than
an hour the Indian was in the deepest
recesses of the cave tied band and foot,
Walter haying managed to jump on him
from behind a roc* and subdued the
coward without trouble.
Jeffery was in no hurry to come back
from the mine, and in a week many
things had happened. Walter had told
Carrie the old, oid story beside the spring
in the barren desert, and no doubt it
sounded as sweet to her ears as to any
woman that ever lived, for she accepted
him on the spot and "mamma" gave her
consent at once. It was planned that they
should all leave as soon as possible.
There was no hitch in the arrangements.
A note was left on a table telling Jeffery
that they had gone and thai the Indian
was tied up in the cave back of the spring,
but with plenty of food and water to last
him a month or more.
The two women bade farewell to their
prison that afternoon, and, in company
with Walter, started across the desert just
as the sun was settipg. This was to give
them a start by preventing Jeffery follow
ing their trail in case he returned that
night. Walter's horse was a fine, power
| ful brute, but those ridden by the two
women were the poor jaded creatures be
longing to Jeffery and could not be de
pended upon for any great amount of
speed.
The night trip across the southern part
of the desert was a trying one to the two
women. To them every ghostly cactus
appeared to be some enemy, and in the
awful stillness they fancied the howl of
every wild beast to be the enraged Jeffery.
in pursuit.
No stop was made until morning, when
they had reached the western side of the
desert and there was a little sign of vegeta
tion. At a point called Windy Gap a road
commenced that led to Hinckley, a station
on the Atlantic and Pacitic Railroad.
Walter, however, decided to cut across the
desert for Daggett and there take the train
for Los Angeles. It was about seventy
miles, and at the end of three days they
had covered all but ten of it without being
compelled to urge their horses. The next
morning, after they had been an hour or
so on the road, a cloud of dust in the dis
tance told of pursuit. Bj r the aid of a pow
erful glass Walter assured himself that
Jeffery was on the trail. The horses were
urged to their utmost, but it was a losing
game from the start, and the cloud of dust
grew nearer and nearer until it was not
j more than four miles in the rear.
Walter had determined not to give in
! and also made up his mind to shoot if it
j became necessary. Mrs. Jeffery and Car
! rie never lost courage. When the cloud of
dust had eained another mile a sudden
turn in the road brought them to a sur
veyors' camp.
their story was told in a few moments
and the boys enthused on the subject.
T. ey provided the women with fresh
horses, promising to turn the others over
to tlieir owner as soon as he came alon>;.
They even offered to capture him and hold
him until the elopers had time to get
safely aboard a train. It was thought best
to let him continue the chase, however, as
the chances were all against him now. All
the surveyors asked was that their horses
be left at a certain stable in Daggett, where
they could got them later in the day.
While the excnange was being made
Jeffery had gained a mile or more and the
race became a hot one. It was four miles
to Daggett and th*e road was rough. But
Jeffery's horse was pretty well used up
and the elopers commenced to gain. When
about a mile out of town a locomotive
whistle was heard and the horses were
urged with whip and spur until they
fairly flew over the ground, throwing the
sand in clouds about them. Daggett was
reached when Jeffery was still a mile on
the desert. A train was just ready to
leave, but the horses were turned over to
the stableman and the elopers got aboard
in good time. A few moments after the
train pulled out Jeffery dashed up to the
station, but too late.
The rest of the story is soon told. The
entire party reached Los Angeles in safety,
and after the wedding Mr. and Mrs. New
ton and Mrs. Jeffery started East. A
letter was sent to Jeffery telling him that
they were all going to Louisville, and that
if he would come there and live like a civ
iliz.-d being at Iwould be forgiven.
An Old Art Revived.
Daguerreotypes are coming into vogue
I again. This were good news. A good
| daguerreotype portrait is much more than
a photograph, and it is a wonder that pho
tography ever swamped this more dis

ago the Listener saw a wonderful collec
tion of daguerreotypes in an old house up

I taken at least forty years ago," there were
as sharp and clear in their neat black
cases as if they had been taken but the day
before and some of them were as beautiful
as good miniatures. Woen we consider
that all these fine old daguerreotypes were
made by professional operators with little
experience and no artislic training, and
reflect upon the amount of tkill ana taste
that is applied to amateur photography at
this day we may realize soruethi ng of
what the result of the application of an

KING OF GREAT TUNS
The Gigantic Wine Cask at
Fresno Which Holds
79,000 Gallons.
HEIDELBERG IS FAR ECLIPSED.
It Tcok Two Ca r s of Steel to Hoop It
In and Used Lumber Enough
for a Mans or.
Down at Fresno, on the St. George vine- |
yard, has lately been erected a gigantic j
wine cask, or tun, beside which the famed !
Great Tun of Heidelberg sinks into insig- j
nincance. It is the biggest in the world.
For almost 150 years the Great Tun has
been celebrated far and wide for its im
mense size, and nothing on the globe
could compare with it. It was built in a
part of the picturesque castle of Heidel
berg, the finest in all Germany, itself
erected at the end of the thirteenth cen
tury.
Mighty rulers and brave knights have
occupied it, and throngs of beautiful ladies
and their royal escorts have gathered at
the old castle on the Neckar and partaken
of the wine which the Great Tun held. It j
has cot into the cyclopedias and into all i
history as the one unreachable, irreproach- j
able thing in the world in the way of i
winemaking.
So it has been by right, too, for till now j
there was nothing anywhere to compare
with it in size. But the gentlemen who
own the St. George vineyard have i
knocked the fame out of the gigantic Hei- j
delberg tun, and it is a has-been. History
will have to be corrected.
The Great Tun holds 49,000 German gal
lons, or 42,000 American gallons, while the
St. George tun holds no less than 79,000 !
gallons, or almost twice as much as the !
tun which has for 150 years been figuring j
in history.
It took two carloads of steel to hoop the
gigantic cask, and there is enough lumber
in it to construct an elegant mansion.
The lumber is all n-dwood, obtained from
the forests of Humboldt County. Not one |
stick in ten from which the material was
selected would answer. Absolute freedom j
from any kind of flaws was required.
When" the redwood was selected it took j
almost two years for it to dry and undergo
the preparation for the cask". About two
complete railroad trains of this California
redwood is used in the Fresno great tun.
The tun towers to a height of no less I
than thirty feet, and it is twsnty-six feet !
wide. It can contain thirty carloads of i
wine.
"This is by all odds the greatest cask i
that ever was built," said George H. Malta,
one of the largest owners of the St. George
vineyard, at th 2 Bohemian Club a day or !
two ago. "We built it and the other casks j
in the winery so as to always have a sup- j
ply of uniform wine on hand. The big |
cask inside is twenty-four feet by twenty
fonr ftet."
But Mr. Malta, not satisfied with having
knocked the spots off the Heidelberg tun
with one gigantic piece of architecture, i
started in ana erected three more casks, j
any one of which holds more than the
Heidelberg tun. They are in the vineyard
not far from the kinjj of tuns, and are con
structed for blending purposes.
"These each stand twenty feet by twenty- I
four feet over all," said Mr. Malta, "and j
they hold about 45,000 gallons each, or an
amount equal to eighteen carloads. I had I
to have them in order to enable me to ,
make some fifty cars of .wine uniform and ;
thus supply wine men with a uniform \
class of wine at distant times in the future
"Not only is the great tun built in tte
strongest manner, but all of them are.
The Fresno Wine Vat, an Ordinary Hogshead and the Famous Heidelberg Tun.
They are very heavily built. There is no
timber grown anywhere else in the world
that is strung enough to hold such enor
mous quantities of wine. California only
can grow the timber, and it is redwood.
The commercial length of lumber here is
twenty feet, but this we had made longer.
There is not a knot or a speck of any kind
in the material. The timber was cut for
two years before it was use.!.
"Our winery is the largest in the country,
too, and Â»ye have a number of other
casks there, holding from 10,000 to 20,000
gallons each. There isn't a vineyard or
a winery in Europe that handles one-third
of the grapes that we do. We bandied last
year at the St. George vineyard more than
7500 tons of crapes, and made 120,000 gal
lons of brandy "for fortification purposes
alone. Our vineyard consists of 1200 acres
of grapes, but we Duy a great many other
than what we raise. The Vina vineyard is
larger than the St. George, but. it doesn't
produce as many grapes. This, therefore,
puts us in the front rank, not only as hav
ing the largest winery, but the largest
vineyard in the Â»vorid.
"There is no vineyard or winery in any
part of the world that is as great."
Several million dollars are behind the
great wine-making enterprise. The St.
George vineyard is six miles east of Fresno.
Some years ago Mr. Malta, who is a prac-<
tical vineyardist, conceived the idea of
combining several vineyards in that local
ity. The grape 3 were especially fine and
he believed if he could combiue the
various interests and made one vine
yard he could, by the aid of gi
gantic casks, make a wine that for uni
formity and character would be of great
merit.
After considerable effort six vineyards
were consolidated and then the owners set
about to make casks to supply the de
mand. They built the three casks al
luded to and then set to making the king
of tuns, which holds the enormous amount
of 79,000 gallons, a quantity almost in
credible of conception in itself when the
size of the monster cask is considered.
The great tun towers so high that every- \
thing for miles about is dwarfed by it. It j
is a landmark for all the country, being in j
size, though not in appearance, a great
castle in the level stretch of land about
Fresno.
The three casks, which are connected for
blending purposes, would be giants be
yond comi>are of themselves if it were not
for the monstrous tun, now known as the
King of Tuns.
Longfellow, in his Hyperion, tells of
the wondrous size of the Heidelberg tun.
In speaking of the castle, Paul Fleming
asks:
"Does anybody live there now?"
"Nobody," answered Baron Hohlen,
''but the man who shows the Heidelberg
tun, and a Frenchman who has been
sketching there since the year 1810."
Popularly the great tun of Fresno is re
ferred to as the 100,000 gallon cask and the
others as the 50,000-gallon casks, though
the figures heretofore given are correct.
But by the conservative and actual figures
the great tun of Heidelberg is laid far in
the shade.
"This great tun of Heidelberg has not
been used for many years, because there
was not wine enough to fill it," said Mr.
Malta. "In and about the St. George
vineyard it is different. We can not only
till one almost twice as great, but are
obliged to have three others, any one of
which is greater than the Heidelberg tun.
And this is but for one vineyard of the
thousands in the valley about Fresno."
WHAT MOLDS
THE CRIMINAL
The Question Viewed From a
Theosophical Standpoint.
By confessing to the murder of twenty
live or more men, women and children H.
H. Holmes removes all doubt as to his
puilt. The enormity of the crimes he
coiemitted and the various reasons he
assigns for committing them make the
man an interesting study on criminology
lines. Something moved him to delight
in taking the life of human beings, but
what it was that moved him is the ques
tion. Holmes does not differ, however,
from any other criminal except in degree
of criminality. The chicken-thief has
i more moral unfoldment than the mur
derer and therefore he is not so great a
criminal, but he is a criminal. This brings
up the question of why the chicken
thief, beiniz a criminal, should confine his
criminal acts to stealing property of small
value and the murderer extend his crim
-1 inal acts to the taking of human life; or,
in other words, what is it that molds a
Holmes into a heartless murderer and a
Friday into a petty thief? Hamlet says,
"There is a divinity that shapes our ends,
rouph hew them as we wiJl." If that is
divinely true, it follows that it is "divin
ity" that molds the criminalâ and the
good man, too, sinner and saintâaccord
ing to "divinity's" own sweet will and in
clination. If, then, "divinity" shapes the
course of a man for a life of crime or a life
of righteous living, a man only Kicks
against the pricks of an "eternal de
cree" when he essays to depart from the
already blazed way he shall go.
Hut that philosophy is the very essence
of fatalism, and it makes so much of a
machine of a man that it is repulsive to
him, whether his aspirations be for higher
or lower levels of existeuce. It is not true,
however, that men, law-breakers, are
molded >nto criminals by some one or
some intelligent force outside of them
selves. If criminals are the product of a
molding process it foliows that there was
a time when they wen; not criminals, and
it follows, too, that they were as clay in
the hands of the potter to be shaped to
suit his purpose. If that be true, the
criminal is at once relieved of all responsi
bility for his acts, for he is under the law
of Paul's "election and predestination,"
John Calvin's "total depravity" or Ham-
let's "divinity." He is upon the earth to
be used by a power higher than himself to
glorify gods or rebel against them accord
ing as it pleases his creator, and hence he
is what he is according to a general plan
and purpose.
If that be true, Holmes murdered by
wholesale because he was arbitrarily as
signed to the role of a man-slayer, and
provided with ample inclination and
strength of character to resist any over
tures from his higher nature to spare his
victims, and so it must be that he is
blameless for the lives he took. But there
is something implanted in every human
being that insists upon holding every one
responsible for his acts, and no philoso
phy, gospel or doctrine will ever be able to
convince mankind otherwise. There is a
grandeur in personal responsibility which
no one, even the greatest criminal, would
surrender for any consideration. The "I
am I" Wbich every huruan being delights
in repeating to himself is the one great in
centive to independent personal thought
and action. No sane man would think of
giving up his personality and individuality
for any compensation that could possibly
be offered.
There are those who vehemently deny
that divinity, predestination or total de
pravity molds the criminal, but they ad
vocate the doctrine of heredity, which is a
far weaker and less tenable theory than
any other. To believe that one must be
born right to be right is a proposition
that cannot be sustained by logic or fact;
besides, it is cruel, in that it places the
unborn absolutely at the disposal of men
and women who may and may not them
selves be criminals. Heredity makes the
child subject to the caprice of chance. It
consigns him arbitrarily and irrevocably
to a life of crime or a life of correct living,
as inclination is transmitted to him by his
parents. He conies into the world equipped
with propensities for good or for evil, ac
cording as his ancestors were equipped,
for the law of heredity and of atavism
marked him and he must go to his place
upon the treadmill of human action.
If the law takes him in hand for offend
| ing against it he must submit to the pun
ishment meted out to him, notwithstand
ing his ancestors prepared him to commit
the crime by transmitting to nim a desire
so strong to commit crime that the re
straining; moral influence of his environ
ment and the command of the law were
too weak to restrain his hand. But some
will say good and evil were before him;
that he was a free moral agent, and that if
he elected to do evil let the consequence
be upon him. What nonsense! Is it
natural law that one corning into the world
loaded down with the accumulated desires
and propensities for evil of an evil-minded
ancestry, reaching back through the ages,
shall liave moral courage and sense of
right in sufficient force to enable him to
overcome every characteristic of his na
ture?
If character is transmitted, what we call
the processes of individual evolution aro
little less than vehicles to keep desires
alive and further stimulate them to deeds
of vice or virtue, according to the natural
product of the original seed. But human
ity grows better as the generations come
and go when it should grow worse as each
generation comes into the world bearing
tne sheaves of the harvest of its predeces
sor's ciiminal life. There is to-day, as
there has been on every other day since
man appeared upon the earth, more of
what is called evil than of what is called
good in the world, and it would seem that
the greater ou^ht to have overcome the
lesser by this time, but such is not the
case.
And, again, if the great and good are
powerful enough to minimize the evil pro
pensities of the race, and that they trans
mit inclinations of increasing strength for
higher and better conduct of life, it should
certainly follow that the children of great
and cood people would be stil! greater and
better, but no such results obtain. The
history of the world does not record many
instances of two persons who were greatly
distinguished for moral and intellectual
worth springing from the same parents.
On the other hand, it is a fact of history
that for the most part the towering geniuses
of the world sprang from the lowest walks
of life, where culture, refinement, wealth
and social advantages were total strangers.
From Moses to Abraham Lincoln the
world's greatest leaders of men to higher
and truer manhood were, with few ex
ceptions, born amid poverty and ignorance
I and of parents who did not aspire to a
higher life than they were living. Thus
it will be seen the environment of wealth,
education, polish and high social position
is no warrant that children born under
such desirable and encouraging circum
stances will be even up to ordinary. We
might asK. if the doctrine of heredity be
true, from whom did Cain inherit his high
temper and murderous inclination? And
from whom did Abel inherit his meek and
pious disposition? If from Adam and
Eve, who transmitted these contradictory
dispositions? Ay, there's the rub, for
something does not come from nothing.
But referrins to Holmes, "Who did sin,
ttis man or his parents, that he was born
(morally) blind?" Theosophy teaches the
I truer doctrine. Strictly speaking, neither
he nor his parents did sin. He was born
blind in obedience to the law of ethical
causation. He gathered the harvest from
seed sown by his own hand. But this is
incomprehensible unless examined and
analyzed in connection with monadology .
and cause and effect, which is the doc
trine of "ye reap as ye sow." Holmes was
j the potter and the clay of his own spiritual
| being, and he chose in the long ago to
i dwell upon the confines of his lower na- j
ture. He resisted the yearning of his soul I
for a nearer apnroach to divinity, and
caroused in his animal desire. He refused
to let the light of moral sense shine upon
him, preferring the habits and customs of
his cannibal liie of aijes ago.
He advanced intellectually, but not
upon ethical lines. The habits and
inclinations of his jungle life cling to him
because he so desires. He differs from the
bushman only in mentality. He is now
and always has been a freeagent, and the
conduct of his life has always been of his
own choosing, but he must reap in each
life the legitimate harvest of his former
sowing. There is no escape from tne
operation of Karma. He must himself
atone for every criminal act. He must
suffer wrong for every wrong done to
others. He must come and come again
into the activities of human action until
every tare and poison weed is rooted out
j of his field of existence, and the seed of
[ the harvest of each life's planting will be
the seed of the next sowinj*. "Whatsoeve
a man soweth that shall he also reap."

Counting a Million.
I wrote to the Treasury DeDartment in
Washington, and I put two questions,
which one of the leading authorities an
swered in the most obliging manner.
"Treasury Department, Office of the
Treasurer, Washington, D. C, March 16,
1893.â Sir: You ask me the following
questions: (1) How ]ong does it take, un
der the most advantageous circumstances,
for an expert to count 100,000 silver dol
lars? (2) How long does it take, under the
' most advantageous circumstances, for an
expert to count 100,000 notes?
In reply to the first inquiry, permit me
to state that for a continuous count of an
expert i f will require twenty hours to
handle $100,000 standard silver dollars.
Under ordinary conditions, and observing
the rules and regulations of the office for
count as to correctness, and at the same
time keep a careful eye for the detectipn
of counterfeits, 4500 per hour, or 27,000 per
six working hours each day is about the
limit capacity of our experts in that line.
To the second inquiry 1 may say that it
will take an expert 16% hours to count
i 100,000 new notes, and for a current or or
dinary day's woik 40,000 notes is about all
that can be done. Respectfully yours,
E. H. Neheker,
Treasurer. United States.
Take, then, 1,000,000 silver dollars, and
set an expert counting it. If he worked
night and day over it, lost no time in eat
ing, drinking or sleeping, he would finish
a fairly lough job of counting 1,000,000 sil
ver dollars in precisely eight and one
third days. â Harper's Round Table.

This is to certify that I was troubled
with the rheumatism more or less for about
eight years, and a good share of the time
obliged to co with canes or crutches. At
the time I heard of Munyon's Rheuma-
tism Cure I was obliged to go with a cane
and a cratch, and, in fact, could hardly
put my feet to the floor. They were so
swollen with inflammatory rheumatism
that I could not sleep, and life was a tor-
ture. Within twenty-four hours after I
commenced using Munyon's remedy I
threw away cane and crutch, and am now
as free 1 from it as I ever was in my life.
The same remedy cured two others here.

SOCIETY
HE season '95- 96 is closed; that
is, for those who gauge the period
of social gayeties by the opening
)\ and closing events of the Friday
Night Club.
For them the season is not truly on be
fore the iirst cotillon, and after the last as
sembly â well it's worth one's social stand
ing to even tnink of entertaining any
more.
But, in spite of that fact, there are a
number of small but very select affairs an
nounced for the coming week, and it is ex
pected that for many weeks yet to come
there will be any number of delightful
gatherings. The affairs of the past week,
though not numerous, have made up in
brilliancy wiiat they lacked in numbers.
The brilliant entertainment given by
Mrs. Hager on Monday evening at the
Native Sons' Hall has certainly never been
surpassed, if it ever has been equaled, in
the annals of local â¢ society. Its chief
charm lay in its novelty and the brilliant
way in which every detail of the perfect
whole was handled.
Other charming affairs of the week were
the Dunn tea, tbe Sloss theater party, the
Masten wedding and the Wells euchre
party.
Society is already turning its attention
to the various sumrtier resorts and prepa
rations are being made for the annual sum
mer exodus. There does not seem to be
any particular resort that is to receive all
the favor this season and it is probable
that all the watering places will enjoy a
fair share of society's patronage.
The European departures have been un
usuaiiy numerous this year. On Wednes
day evening last Joseph D. Grant left for
New York, expecting to sail on the 22d
on board the Teutonic. Mr. Grant in
tends to go to Moscow to witness the coro
nation of the Czar and will probably be
absent about three months. Mr. and Mrs.
Oxnard leave the latter part of the month
for a European visit and will divide their
time among the various German water
ing places and health resorts.
The past week noted the return of Mr.
and Mrs. Winthorp E. Lester (nee Hobart),
and Miss Ella Hobart and Miss Vassault,
who went on a visit to New York to meet
them on their return from Europe.
Apropos of the return of the Hobarts, it
is stated that the wedding of Ilisa Williams
and Walter Hobart will be celebrated at
the little church in San Rafael on the
30th of May, Decoration day.
Among the other travelers who have re
turned are Mrs. Requa and Miss Amy
Requa and Miss Julia Crocker, after an
extended ana most enjoyable Eastern
visit. The Requas are now again at their
Lome in Piedmont, and Miss Crocker is
home just in time for her sister's we iding.
It was an extremely pretty wedding yes
terday, that of Miss Fanny Crocker,
daughter of Mrs. Clark W. Crocker, and j
Robert Clark McCreery, solemnized at 8:30 j
o'clock, at the residence of the bride'B j
mother on Slitter street.
The handsome drawing-room in which
the ceremony was performed has been the
scene of many fashionable gatherings. I
Yesterday it was decorated all in dainty
pink and white blossom-, making a most '
handsome setting for a spring wedding.
Only relatives and a limited number of
invited friends witnessed the ceremony
which was performed by the Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie. Miss Julia Crocker, sister of
the bride, was maid of honor and W. W.
Douglass of Sacramento best man.
The bride wore an elegant gown ot ivory
white satin trimmed with some rare and
costly family lace.
Miss Julia Crocker was more than usually
attractive in her dainty pink silk gown.
After the ceremony there were congrat
ulations and dancing and at midnight an
elaborate supper at which covers were laid
for eighty. Mr. and Mrs. McCreery will
reside in Sacramento.
Mrs. F. L. Whitney gave a most de
lightful progressive euchre party yesterday
afternoon at her home on Laguna street.
The players occupied seven tables and in
dulged in a most warmly contested game.
Dainty prize? were awarded the victors.
After the game there were elaborate re
freshments and music.
Mrs. A. N. Drown and Miss Berenice
Drown entertained about 200 friends at an
afternoon tea yesterday, between the hours
of 3 and tj o'clock, at their home on Jack
son street. The usual accessories of the
fashionable afternoon tea â music, brilliant
company, exquisite decorations and elab
orate refreshments â went toward the
making of a most delightful afternoon.
Mrs. J. 8. Coneaiul Miss Josephine Cone
of Red Bluff and Miss Nellie Hillyer of
this city completed the Mediterranean
trip of eight weeks' duration early in
April and are now in Rome. They will
probably visit Egypt and take the Nile
trip. They will not return home until
November.
Colonel and Mrs. W. R. Shafter, U. S. A., !
will soon leave Angel island to pass a
couple of months at Bakersfield for the
benefit of Mrs. Shafter's health.
Lieutenant-Colonei L. S. Babbitt, Ord
nance Department, U. S. A., of Benicia,
has been inspecting Fort Point.

HE APPEEOIATED " JANE EYRE."
The Publlsher'g Keader Used to Sit Up
at Night Reading the Manuscript.
Mr. Williams, who was the "reader" of
Messrs. Smith, Elder & Co., was by his
position brought into touch with many
literary men of the day, but from a letter
full of interesting reminiscences of Leiph
Hunt and his son, Thornton Hunt, of
George Henry Lewis and of Ruskin, with
which Miss Williams has favored me, I
have room only for a short extract. "My
mother," Miss Williams says, "well re
members how my father sat up vry late
at night reading the manuscript of 'Jane
Eyre' and his haying to her how in spite
of the liny cramped writing he could not
leave the story, so thrilling and exciting
was it. and how he thought it would make
a great sensation when published. There
was much excitement day by day, as he
came into the house, saying to my elder
sisters, 'More nroofs of 'Jane Eyre, girls!'
and waving them in his hand.
'â¢My sisters could not imagine why my
father brought home those funny little
ladies he described as country cousins,
who were so quiet and retiring at the
family tea. These were Charlotte, and, I
believe, Emily Bronte. My mother guessed
the secret, and, being a woman of keen in
tuitive judgment, said the next day, with
a twinklft in her eves, 'Your Miss Brown
is. I believe, Jane Eyre. : My father hushed
her down, but, being so amused at her
woman's wit, could not control his ex
pression, ana his telltale face proved her
power of discernment had not been
â¢wrong."
Mr. Williams, it may be added, was a
man of wide culture, deeply susceptible to
the charms of country life, a passionate
lover of music, a student of art and the
editor of a volume â now becoming scaree â
of extracts from the works of Mr. Ruskin.
For some years he Had a large share in
the management of the Cornhill Maga
zine in the days when Thackeray was the
nominal editor, and many living writers
yet remember -with gratitude that they
owe their first steps up the ladder of fame
to the encouragement and assistance of
Mr. Williams. He died in August, 1875.â
Good Words.
ANCIENT OLUPMIA
AS SEEN
BY MODERN EYES
'E7 1 I iVF gy igg |m 1 \|*~' itei $ JsTl
WE left Athens early on a
bright spring morning with
a small bag for necessaries
on our short trip and a well
tilled lunch basket. The ac
commodations in Gresce in the way of
railroad conveyances are about like those I
of other countries of Southern Europe,
very inferior. But by this time we had !
become seasoned travelers and regarded
such minor matters with true philosopny.
As we always carried a goodly supply of
creature comforts we managed to make
ourselves tolerably happy under all cir
cumstances.
The weather was very warm ana we
crawled along at the rate of about fifteen
miles an hour, but there was so much to
observe and enjoy that we did not notice
the matter of speed particularly. The
Greeks themselves are an interesting peo-
pie, though one look 3 in vain for the
classical style of beauty he is apt to asso
ciate with this ancient race. On the con
trary they seem a coarse, blunt-featured
type and do not look over-intelligent,
though they appear gentle and kind
hearted. We speak, of course, of the
poorer people, who have but little educa
tion.
The dress of one class of soldiers is very
peculiar. It consists of an immensely
full short white cotton skirt reaching the
knee, a long close-fitting covering for the
leg, and a very pointed heelless shoe
turned up at the toe and finished at tne
j end with a tuft or ball of cptton as an orna
ment. These curious shoes, which strike
one at first as ridiculous, are an important
feature of their dress.
The soldiers in question are renowned
for the rapidity of their march, and so
noiseless is their approach, owing to these
very shoes, that they are upon the enemy
before their presence is even suspected. A
shirt of white cotton, abroad, colored sash
around the waist, a short, gayly embroid
ered jacket with long, flowing sleeves, ana
a red Greek cap complete this odd and
picturesque costume. The officers' dresses
| are of finer materials, the jackets often
I very richly embroidered and the aaahes of
silk.
These soldiers are specially chosen and
are considered the finest in the army.
They mount guard in front of the King's
palacu and are of great service in sur
prises and advance work. As the sun
shines on them the gleaming white of ttie
dress and the bright colorinar of sash,
jacket and cap produce a very pretty effect.
In spite of the full skirt they have a'manly,
cv n martial, air.
Our whole route was in sight of the
water, first of the beautiful coast of the
Saronic gulf and later along the classic
j shores of the Gulf of Lepanto. For a long
j while after starting we could see the island
I of Salamis, where was fought that famous
battle of the allied Greeks against the
mighty hosts of the dreaded Xerxes over
2000 years ago.
As we crossed the narrow isthmus of
Corinth we could see far below us men at
[ work on the canal, which is now finished,
j uniting the two gulfs. They are said to
have followed traces left by that malig
nant but undoubtedly clever and enter
prising Emperor Nero.
From her.- to Pyrgos, where we were to
remain for the night, the ride was the
most pleasant. Nothing can equal the
vivid blue depths of a Grecian sky, and the
clearness of the atmosphere is "startling.
On one side of us quivered the sparkling
waters of the deep blue bay, relieved now
and then by a dancing white sail. On our
other hand extended nrlles and miles of
fair green vineyard bearing the famous
Corinth crape, which, when dried, ia
known as the Zante currant.
We hail never seen more beautiful or
flourishing vineyards, and their yield is,
indeed, one of the few sources 01 wealth
of this poverty-stricken country. Across
the bright eulf we could see the lovely
outlines of the distant mountains, bathed
in the soft liquid atmoshere. We arrived
at the ancient town -of Pyrgos about dusk,
and taking a carriage rode a few hundred
yards to a hotel we had chosen at hap
hazard, where we enjoyed a tolerable meal
and a fair night's rest.
By half-past 6 the next morning we were
on the way to Olynipia on the short branch
railroad recently constructed. An hour's
ride through a lonely anil primitive coun
try and w. had reached the famous goal of
our journey. A country road led up a
gentle slope and passed a simple roadside
tavern and a rural blacksmith-shop. At
the very summit of this hill stood a mod
ern, well-built museum, that seemed quite
imposing from its site and solitude.
And this was every trace of life to be
found for miles around. We turned off to
the left before reaching the museum, and
after a short ramble around the slope of a
green hill found ourselve- ill the midst of
the imposing ruins that have been lying
serenely under the lovely Grecian SKy for
so many centuries, safely buried from hu
man invasion and barbarian destruction,
under a mass of material fifteen feet deep,
the accumulation of ages of debris borne
from the sides of the mountains by the
streams of water.
It is due to German enterprise and
science that they have been at last un
covered. The Greeks are immensely proud
of their ancient prestige and their wonder
! ful art treasures, but it is a singular Fact
that it is entirely owing to foreign exer
tions that the latter have been restored to
the interested world. They are very bitter
against Lord Elgin for robbing them, as
I they express it, of some of the matchless
beauties of the Parthenon; but it is the
sight of these wonderful sculptures that
has aroused European appreciation and
helped to interest other nations in the
little country, thus materially assisting its
development.
A personal visit is really needed to give
one an adequate idea of these ancient
' remains. The completely ruinous condi-
i tion of the wholeâ for there is scarcely an
entire pillar standingâ the vast quantity
of these fallen monuments, the primitive
materials of many of them and the brood
ing soiitude of the spot, environed by
green hills and lofty mountains, produce
a strange and solemn impression not
found among any other ancient remains.
Pompeii seems lively compared with this
place, for there you find several hotels
near by, a fine highroad and plenty ol tour
ists to people it. ~As we wandered from the
remains of one ruined temple to another,
( climbing the vast foundations and walk
i ins around the bases of the huge pillars or
along the prostrate lengths of others, it
brought back to me in some unaccounta
ble manner a day of equal solitude spent
among the t'iant redwood forests of Cala
veras. Only here the mystic associations
of former gods and departed heroes added
a stronger intensity to the whole effect.
A technical description of the place
would be long and tedious. The various
gymnasiums and courts, temples and
fountains are easily traced by the aid of a
guidebook, and to a student of classical
history are of absorbing interest. As we
gazed upon the famous Stadion dim vis
ions of some of those celebrated contests
floated before us, from the time of the first
great victor, Pelops, to that last entry of
an individual unknown to the common
fame of to-day, but doubtless a glorious
and privileged character during his own
short existence. What a democracy it
was when magnificent conquerors like
Philip of Mac*;don and fearful tyrants like
the cruel Nero could count it as one of
their most glorious titles to have gained a
victory over these sturdy, well-trained but
simple Spartan youths. They were almost
as proud of this laurel wreath as of the
one that crowned them emperor.
But the most unletteredjof visitors is
bound to be impressed with the general
atmosphere of the place, and we uncon
| sciously moved about in a subdued man
ner and spoke in low, musing tones, not
solemn or awestruck, bift quiet and
melancholy. Olympia. is so thoroughly
off the beaten tracK that the average
tourist does not seem to reach it. and we
enjoyed it in undisturbed possession for
many hours.
While climbing over the ruins of the
vast temple of Zeus we came most unex
pectedly upon three Greeks who, by the

by, art most enthusiastic admirers of their
own country. They bowed very politely
and sm/lingly showed us a small tortoise
they had found not far distant. It was a
beautifully marked little animal and, see
ing our admiration for it, they insisted
upon our keeping it. We exchanged
cards and thus parted from these gentle
strangers, not one word of whose laneuage
could we understand, but wtioae simple
politeness and old-fashioned courtesy
needed no interpolation. The tortoise,
which seem *i a titting type of that ancient
Greek civilization, has remained with us
ever since, accompanying us in our traval9,
and is now living a peaceful life on tha
borders of western modern progression in
a climate much like her own. What
wondrous tales she might pour forth
could she but dictate to a stenographer
the accumulated wisdom that her ances
tors must have acquired in listening to
Greek sages of nearly 3000 years ago!
How many vexed questions she might
settle could she but speak! With her
added advantages of modern travel what
sagacious conclusions she might draw and
what marvelous theories might be
evolved from herdoubtle-s logical brain!
On our way back to the train we stopped
at the pretty little museum, which is
gradually being tilled with treasures dug
up from under the ruins. There were
many interesting bas-reliefs descriptive of
famous races, and others illustrating lead
ing events in the life of that favorite god
of physical force and beauty, Hercules.
But the gem of the collection is the incom
parable Hermes, whose matchless sym
metry and noble visage will tempt any
pilgrim to this distant shrine where it is
to remain.
Then there is a wonderful Nike or Vic
tory, whose perfect limbs are exquisitely
outlined under the graceiul drapery whose
flying folds are instinct with life and spirit
as they flutter â not "seem" to flutter â
with the exertions of the flying feet So
powerful is the impression of beauty and
force of this eloquent figure that one
scarcely noti< es that the image is headless.
We felt amply repaid for our long, hot
journey, and on our way borne were too
eagerly excited to feel fatigue. We broke
cur journey at Patras this time, and had
an excellent meal before retiring. Our
rooms looked out on the open square, and
we could see not far away the waters of
the gulf gleaming in the rays of the full
moon. We were just opposite the spot
where the famous battle of Lepanto
(1571) was fought and Christian
ity triumphed orer Mohammedanism,
under the leadership of the gallant hero,
Don Juan of Austria. The more glorious
war of independence was fought in these
waters also, and on the other side of yon
der promontory lies the town of Misso-
Jonghi, where the brave Greeks com
manded the admiration of the civilized
world, and where the romantic Byron,
whose name is cherished by tvery Grecian
heart, met his untimely fate.

Picture of a Sea Fight.
Instantaneous photography has made it
easy to-day for men -with little knowledge
of seamanship to place ships and boats
under sail in a picture, but in early days
the power of doing so correctly was limited
to a few men like Stantield and Cautuin
Beecby, R. N.
The difficulty of obtaining anything like
a reliable description of a sea fight, even
from those who had taken part in it, was,
according to Stanfield, very great, and he
told us how, when planning his picture of
'â¢The Battle of Trafalgar," he applied to
Captain Hardy for advice as to the posi
tion of the Victory, Hardy's answer being
that, owing to the smoke it was impossi
ble during the height of the action
to see beyond the ships alongside,
adding: "I am about the worst man
you could come to, for some time
before that which your picture repre
sents the Victory's tiller-roper had been
shot away, and I was below in the steerage
attending to them and the helm, and
down there we knew so little of what was
going on that we continued to load and
fire one of the stern guns until ordered
from the deck to stop because we were fir
ing into one of our own ships."â Temple

VILLE DE PARIS.
BRANCH HOUSE,
LOS ANGELES.IMBER AND THE CABBALA
The Mystic Professor Under
takes to Explain What
It Is.
HIS "JEWISH MARSEILLAISE."
He Seeks to Prove by the "Children
of the Ghetto" that He Is Not
Melchitzeiek Pinchas.
Naphtaly Hers Imber, national poet of
Israel, mystic, expounder of the Cabbala,
takes exception, as it was presumed he j
â¢would, to the coupling of his name with |
that of Mclchitzedek Pinchas of the j
"Children of the Ghetto." He says such :
coufusion misrepresents him as well as j
the teaching of the Cabbala and plays into
the hands of his enemies â enemies through
prejudice or lack of knowledge.
"The prejudiced." he says, "expect me
to present something trimmed with flow
ery language, arrayed in shallow words,
and they are disappointed to find in re
presentation the naked truth in her sim
ple, pAe, primitive conditions."
Again he refers to the mention of him
selt by name in the "Children of the
Ghetto," by Melchitzedek Pinchas, the
fictitious character and poet. To a little
party of seekers after the truth as it is ex
pounded by Professor Imber, and who
were gathered in his room on Bush street
yesterday, bo read what he calls his "Jew
ish Marseillaise," as it appears translated
from the Hebrew in the eighteenth chapter
of the "Children of the Ghetto.' "Pin
chas, the poet, is speaking," says Professor
Imber, and lie reads:
Into the exile we too* with us, of all our
glories, oaiy r spark of the fire by which our
temple, the aboae ot our great one, was en
girdled, and this little spark kept us alive
â while the towers of our enemies crumbled into
dust, and this sj.ark leaped into celestial flame
and shed light upon the faces of the heroes of
our race and inspired them to endure the hor
rors of the dance of death and the tortures of
the autos-da-fe. Let us fan the spark again
till it leap up and, become a pillar of flame,
THE POET APPEALS TO THE THIRTY-SIX MASTERS.
going before us and showing us the way to
Jerusalem, the city of our sires. And if gold
will not bring buck our land we must try steel.
As the National Poet of Israel, Naphtall Herz
Imber, has so nobly sung (here ne broke into
the Hebrew â¢â¢Wacht Am Rhein," of which an
English version would run thus):
I.
"Like the crash of the thunder.
Which gpliueth asunder.
The flame of the cloud,
On our tars ever tailing
A voice is heard calling
From Zion aloud:
Let your spirit's desires
For the land of your sires
Eternally burn.
From the foe to deliver
Our own holy river,
To Jordan return.;
Where t>ie soft-flowing stream
Murmurs low as a dream.
There set we our watch.
Our watchword, 'The sword
Of our lAnd aud our Loid'â
By the Jordan there set we our watch,
11.
"Rest in peace, loved land.
For we rest not. but stand,
< >r?-sbaken i.ur sloth.
When the bolts of war rattle
To shirk not tin- battle.
We make thee our oath.
As we hone for n liÂ»-av.-n
Thy claims shall be riven.
Thine enstÃn unfurled.
Au'l in pride of our race
We will fearlessly face
The might of the world.
\Vh';n our trumpet is blown,
And our standard is flown
Then set we our watcn.
Our watchword. ' riie sword
Of our laud and our Lord' â
By Jordan there set we our watch,
111.
"Yea, as long a* there be
Birds in the air. fish In the sea.
And blood in our veins;
And the lions in might.
Leaping down from the height,
Shake, roaring, their manes;
Ana the dew nightly laves
The forgotten old graves
Where Judah's sires sleepâ
We swear, who are living.
To rest not in striving.
To pause uot to weep.
Let the trumpet be blown,
Let the standard be flown,
Now set we our watch.
Our watchword, 'The sword
Of our land aud our Lord'â
In Jordan now set we our watch."
He sank upon the rude, wooden bench ex
hausted, his eyes glittering, his raven hair
disheveled by the wildness of his gestures.
He had said. For the rest of the evening he
neither moved nor spoke.
Professor Iruber, his own raven hair dis
heveled by the wildness of bis gestures,
cio;-ed the book and looked from one to
the other of the little party.
'â¢llow can any one say that 1 am i
Pinchas, or intended to be Pinchas. when
Pinohas uses my own na:ne and calls rae
the National Poet of Israel?" he said.
"It is this song of mine that has awak
ened the envy of Pinchas that is now
heard on the lips of the lovers of Zion in
Palestine," said the professor.
"But about your teaching," was sug
gestedâ"this new cult that you are to es
tablish?"
"I can only give you a hint," he said.
"Very many have asked the same ques
tion. But it is impossible to explain the
deep mysteries of life and of time in a few j
words and off-hand. It must be given in
small pellets at first. If I jjive you an ac
count of my spiritual life with an outline
of the Cabbala you must be able to deter
mine whether I present the truth or not.
I will write it. I will explain about the
thirty-six masters, and how they differ
from those imaginary things, the mahat
mas, and why I was chosen to expound the
Cabbala."
And, as before, talking all the while, the
professor wrote the following, headine it :
THE CABBALA
And My Advent in San Francisco.
In spite of the irritations of human
mind in seeking the truth, which is yet to
be found, still all agree that the truth
exists. Now, if so, there must also exist
ways and means by which we can obtain it
too. That the Cabbala answers the truth is
plain and clear for various reasons; first,
that occultism refers to it; second, that
the learned ones of all the ages and de
nominations have striven to study it. The
Popes in Rome were students of the
Cabbala as the Jews in Jerusalem. But
the best seal of truth is impressed upon its
I letter by the science itself. For every re
ligion, from the lowest fetish faitu up to
i the highest cults of Buddha, Moses and of
' Christ, has a division divided in itself.
j Even science, in all its branches, has not
yet established a unit. In every religious
cult there is always a split iv the shape
of "sects," and in every branch of
science we witness the same spectacle,
'that the doctors disacree." Even iheos
i ophy is experiencing the same, as it is di-
I vided in Oriental and Occidental theoso
phy. This disagreeable agreement is proof
enough that they have not yet found the
truth. The Cabbala is the only science of
truth which has in all its branches estab
lished a unit, and the laws which govern
that science are still in force as in the by
gone days of Mclchisedek, who was Abra
nam's mentor in the Cabbala. The reason
for that phenomenon is, first, its teach
ings are not an outcome of heated brains
of speculative thinKers; they are laws
brought into existence through the com
bination of certain circumstances and sur
roundings; hence whenever those circum
stances come into a combination those
I laws are treated as consequences. They
are as the laws of nature: as ttiose of days
and nights they come and go.
In plainer words, if a cabbalist eoes
through the road outlined by the Cabbala
I he reaches at last that milestone which is.
marked "Wisdom." Has such a person at
tained the highest degree, then he sees the
! world with celestial eyes by the inner light
I of the spiritual optic nerve, not by the
i crystallized fleshly one. The second reason
i is, as they are natural laws, consequences
i of a certain combination of circumstances,
hence they are above and beyond any dis
pute, as revealed facts make silent the
strongest imagination of fiction. No mat
ter how high a cabbalist climbs upon the
ladder of wisdom he can give only that
which is given to him, and cabbalistic
wisdom does not come from books, only
by seeing facts in the light of truth.
ITS LITERATURE.
The Cabbala was never translated into
any living tongue, and its books are writ
ten in a Ciialdaic jargon with the exception
of the book "Sefer Jezira" (book of cre
ation), which is written in pure Hebrew,
the authorship of which is attributed to
the patriarch Abraham. "TheSohlar" (the
light) ia the second book in rank. It was
written by a sage of the famous Tal
mud Rabbi Simon War Yochaii nearly
2000 years ago. The book "The Tree of
Life," from Vital, and the books of the
disciples of Israel Bal Sheni Tow (the man
of good name).
The Cabbala has two parts. The one
teaches about the Cosmos and life's mys
teries, and that teaching can be taughtin
the presence of many; the olher about the
creation, and it can only be taught to sin
gle persons in verbal or oral traditions.
Should the Cabbala be translated and
known, even a Herbert Spencer will bow
his venerable head before its wisdom.
ITS BENEFIT.
Not only to the individual alone will the
Cabbala be of benefit, as it will bring into
his heart comfort and self-satisfaction,
even to humanity at large. For the Cab
bala is a wonderful mirror, wherein every
one sees that which he wishes to see. As I
wrote in my open letter to the religious
congress (published in Chicago) the
Caboala is the only medium through
which we can establish a universal brother
hood on earth, as the Fatherhood is
already established in heaven â as in the
Cabbala the Jew sees his single powerful
Jehovah as well as the Christian sees his
Trinity; the Parsee sees his dual deity as
the great Spinoza sees in it his cosmo
political divine providence.
THE MAH ATM AS.
Like most of the theosophical doctrines
a:id dogmas which were presented to the
world as genuine br Mme. Blavatsky the
niAhatma business is one of them. It is
very easy to fool the Gentiles, as none of
them are able to read the Cabbala. The
original idea of the mahatraa originates
witli the Cabbala, but Mme. Blavatsky
modeled it to her own heart's delight.
According to her there are some masters
called ruahatmas living upon tiie roof of
the world in Thibet. Those masters were
advertised by the now famous story-teller,
Dr. Henseld, who claims having seen them
anil their wonderful power in handling
the forces of nature as a man handles his
don. Nay, more; he claims that he spoke
face to face with the big reincarnated god,
Buddha, who wears the little pants of the
six-year-old great Daia Lama. The doctor
knows, of course, those mahatmas, and I
know him. He has passed many a year
of his life in Boston before he put his
stories in a good shape of a "rix and
mix up."
Attention to those Mahatmas was

called last year by the theosophical family ]
quarrel, when Mnie. Besant, the high
priestess, charged the late high priest, Mr.
Judge, that he forced the communications
of the Mahatmas (when two servant-girls
are fighting the landlady pets out the
truth). In my "Uriel" I showed by the
light of that quarrel that the Mahatma
business is a traud. First, if Mme. Be
Â»ant said that Judge was a forger, she
ought to know what she is talking about,
and if Mr. Judge declared the contrary,
he, of course, knew, too, what he is about,
and we outsiders knew, too, what the mat
ter was with both. The Mahatma business
is only a misrepresented idea of the Cab
bala, as I am going to show by the histori
cal light of truth.
THE THIRTY-SIX MASTERS.
The thirty-six Masters of the Cabbala are
not liKe the mahatmas of the Theosophists,
sitting in idleness on the top of Thibet's
rocky mountains meditating like fools,
why has God created bad boys? The
thirty-six Masters of the Cabbala are scat
tered" all over the world, and they occupy
positions in all the stations of life, from
the lowest beggar to the high-living banker.
"While occupying their positions they do
good in all directions, to help those who
are in need of it without being detected or
known. They are known each to the
other, and to the few students of the Cab
bala. They have no regulations or signs,
as they do not form an order, for each one
has his own way, and divided as they
stand, harmonious they work. They are
the guardians of the sacred science of the
Cabbala, and they communicate each
with the other either by telapathy or by
self-appearance. Never do they write.
If one of them becomes known to out
siders, he either leaves the place or he
must pass off and another is replaced to
fill out the number thirty-six.
The masters are recruited from the ranks
of cabbalistic students and they must be
of 40 years of age. I never dared to pub
lish about the Cabbala, and in my long
literary pursuit in Jewish literature I
avoided to touch the button of tuat sci
ence. Two years ago 1 was offered in Bos
ton by Rabbi Shinder and Mr. Avers, presi
dent of the Theosophical Society, to fur
nish me $2000 to translate the "Sonar"
and I refused. But 1 published the Uriel
in the city when I was ordered by the mas
ters. The reasons of giving now to the
world the light of the Cabbala, the masters
say that humanity has the dyspepsia
from digesting unripe fruits of knowledge
(alluding to the false teachings), now the
people will know to value the Healthy
food of truth.
WHY I WAS CHOSEN.
People have asked me the above ques
tion, and not for my sake only, for the
sake of truth, that at the same time they
may take out of it as a lesson of the hour
to understand better spiritual life. Why
I was chosen? I do not know, but sur
mise. As a matter of fact I am not an
educated man, and I never was in any
school. My personality as well as my
pocket-book are veid of earthly attractions.
From my early childhood I began to study
myself, which is only a miniature edition
of the big cosmos, and you know tiiat he
who seeks will find. At the age of 14 a
master revealed himself to me, instructing
me with the keynote of the CabbaJa,
handing me over regulations to live up to
them.
When I left my native country I joined
the Oliphants, going v/ith them tc Pales
tine as a member of the family. There I
lived, so to say, a high life, yet working
in the spiritual one, too. There I wrote,
together with the noble Alice Oliphant,
the book "Supneumata," which I regard
as the hcralder of the science of truth.
When I got a mission to go to Egypt I left
the pleasures of life in order to enjoy a
better pleasure in my spiritual work" I
was again recalled, and after a short stay I
left a>*ain. Then, after wandering around
the world, I came to this country and was
hailed as poet, scientist and common
sense thinker. Had I been a hypocrite 1
couid have gained some position in life,
but I throw the gauntlet to the Pharisees,
fighting those who make love to God and
are wooing the devil, i made my living
in writing for the religious Jewish papers,
and there was not much of it, as you
know that there is no good pasture in a
churchyard. Two years ago I came to i
Boston, where a young lady, child of Mr.
Thayer, beard my lecture andfell in love
with me. She, as gentile woman, uuder
stood me better than my whole race.
When our love was at the highest pitch,
and she came to me to study, I told her
that it was a crime to deceive her parents.
She refused to do so, for she thought it
will cause an uproar. I could have mar
ried her without the knowledge of her
parents, as I dad her in my power, yet
spiritual light did not allow me to break
moral obligations, and I do as I preach.
I forced her to tell, and her father wrote
me the meanest letters Uncle Sam ever
carried in his letter- bag.
Yet, beyond conception of human cal
culation, I succeeded in publishing the
"Uriel," which required a couple of hun
dred dollars. I was then ordered to Wash
ington, to Syracuse and to San Francisco.
Reader, there is my life in a nutshell. Find
for yourself why I was chosen.
A CHEAP HOUSE,
It Is in the Desert and Cost
Seventy-Five Cents.
Frank Haven, a young man from Bos
ton, thinks that he haÂ» the cheapest house
in this country, and from the appearance
of the editice most people would agree
with him. His dwelling lacks nearly all of
the so-called modern conveniences, but it
is well ventilated and gets plenty of sun
shine. In fact it is situated in that land of
sunshineâ the Colorado desert.
Mr. Haven is one of the army of Eastern
people who annually come to California
for their health and he found the vicinity
of Indio to agree with him better than
any other locality. He arrived last No
vember and for a while lived in a cottage,
but thought the life did not produce ali
the beneficial results to be derived from
the climate. He then bought a tent and
moved a few hundred yards out on the
desert. This scheme worked satisfactorily
until a sandstorm came up and the tent
started on an excursion toward Death
Valley.
After living in a cottaee again for a
couple of weeks, he hit upon an idea that
has tilled all requirements. The onlj T in
convenience was that he had to go over
two miles from the railroad station to tind
a group of giant cacti that were necessary
to his purpose.
It took him about a week to construct
his house and all the money it cost him
THE HOUSE OF CACTI ON THE DESERT THAT COST 73 CENTS.
[From a sketch by a " Call" artUt.]
was 75 cents for some heavy muslin. The
only tool he used was an ax to chop down
the cacti that were where he did not
want them. In the end he had four large
trees at the corners of a square space and
all he had to do was to tack his muslin
from one to the other. A few poles across
the top enabled him to put up a roof of the
same material. Plenty of the cacti were
still standing on three sides to act as wind
breaks.
Since then several severe sandstorms
have prevailed, but Mr. Haven's 75-cent
house was never disturbed.
Such an abode would not be practical in
this part of the country, even if it were
possible, but in the desert, where it is
warm, and never rains, it is all that is
necessary to bodily comfort. Mr. Haven
camps out and says tbat he gets all the
fresh air possible and is rapidly being re
stored to perfect health. The first few
nights wild beasts made him nervous, but
he always keeps a good fire of dead cacti
wood in front of his abode and they never
I disturb him.
OLD-TIME HOUSEHOLDS.
Domestic Arrangements in The Four
teenth Century.
Carpets were unknown luxuries, but the
fashion ot strewing the apartments with
rushes was being gradually abandoned.
Rushes were still used in the retainers'
hall, but for the better rooms sweet
scented herbs and fragrant twigs were
usually employed.
In the fourteenth century windows were
apertures tilled with glass so as to admit
light, but to exclude wind. The walls also
were frequently nunp with cloth or tapes
try to protect the inmates of the room
from the many currents of air that pene
trated *he strong but badly built walls.
We learn from various ancient docu
ments that it was the duty of the serving
men and pages to sweep out the principal
apartments, but as the use of water is
rarely mentioned damp and fragment
leaves and twins must have aided not only
in collecting the dust, but also toward re
freshing the atmosphere in such con
stantly closed rooms, fresh air being only
admitted tnrough the <loor.s opening on to
the battlements or balconies.
From old inventories at Thurleigh and
elsewhere we ascertain how scantily fur
nished were these ancient mansions, al
though they seem to have been abundantly
supplied with flagons and drinking cups
in gold, silver and finely engraved pewter,
besides an infinite number of black jacks
or cups made of leather.â Good Words.
FOND OF PIGEONS,
Bob Spear and His Strange
Fancy for Feathered Pets.
Bob Spear says he is a poor man, very
poor in fact, and his looks do not belie
his words. His clothes are little more
than rags, and yet he is a pigeon fancier.
Bob has his home at the foot of San
some street, not far from the base of Tele
graph Hill, and a most picturesque place
it is. In years gone by it was used as a

saloon, and the sign of the former keeper â 
is still over the door. The building is !
rapidly falling to ruin, but Bob is doing ;
what he can to hold it together, all of '
which adds to the general appearance of
dilapidation.
There are about eight rooms in the j
house, but Bob uses only one for himself; !
the rest are given to his pigeons. And j
such a lot of them he has! They are every- j
where, and of all breeds known to orni
thology. In fact, Bob don't care much â¢
about the breeds of his birds so long as
they are pigeons, and some of them are of J
the most outlandish mixtures. He has
blowers, fantails, homers, tumblers and
just common pigeons. All live in the
same place and seem to get along together
without trouble.
Bob devotes his life to his pigeons' com
fort. At almost every hour of the day he
can be seen doing somethine for them.
Early in the morning he appears with a
large bae of feed, which he throws to them
in handfuls. The birds are not afraid of
him and will fly all around, often perch
ing on his shoulder. Later in the day
Bob will examine the nests and make any
repairs that may be needed. As his flock
increases he builds new boxes and fastens
them to the outside of the house.
He has done this so many times it is
difficult to see where he is going to nail
any more, as the whole outside of his resi
dence is literally covered with pigeon
boxes. In addition to nis pigeons Bob has
several goats and a dog that he thinks are
very valuable. He makes great pets of
them and guards them as he would a
treasure.
People in the neighborhood do not be
lieve Bob's story of poverty. They say
that he sells the pigeons he pretends to
love so much and has lots of gold con
cealed in the old house where he makes
his home.

A MYSTERIOUS BENEPAO TOR.
"Who Has Sent Checks Aggregating
811, 000 to Dr. Guiterag.
During the past week, saya tne Phila
delphia Ledger, Dr. John Guiteras re
ceived a letter dated "Europe, March 19,
1596," from an unknown Cuban sympa
thizer, who inclosed a check for $4000 in
aid of the Cuban cause, and a second check
for $1000 to be given to the widow of a
Cuban journalist who had acted as secre
tary to the Cuban delegate, Senor Estrada
Pal ma.
This makes the third letter which Dr.
Guiteras has received from his unknown
correspondent, who sings himself Ignacio
Agramonte. The rirst, which came
two months ago, inclosed a check for
$2000 in aid of the Cuban patriots'
cause. The second, received about a
month later, contained a check for
$4000. The letters are written in excellent
Spanish, but the handwriting is in an
upright style, each letter being distinctly
formed, and more in the manner of print
ing than writing, and is undouotedly dis
euised. The letter which came last week
was as follows:
"Dr. John Guiteras. my distinguished
compatriot, I take up the pen once more
to thank you for the service rendered in
turning over to the proper parties the last
$4000 I sent you. I again trouble you to
day for ths same object, believinc
that you will attend to it with
pleasure on account of the purpose in
view. 1 inclose herewith check for $4000,
the receipt of which you will acknowledge
in the usual way in the newspaper Patria.
I inclose also another check for $1000, that
you will do me the kindness to place in the
hands of tne widow of Manuel de la Crux
as a help to her in her present distress.
Again thanking you for your kindnes I
am yours truly, Ignacio Agkamoxtk."
According to late statistics there are In
the United States 40,000 deaf mutes.

STAND UP FOR CALIFORNIA.
The work of the National Republican
Convention must necessarily center upon
the construction of a platform. The
party's declaration of principles will fore
shadow the policy of the party when it
shall take bold of the reins of govern
ment. Moreover, the platform adopted at
St. Louis will be in force and binding upon
the party in all the States until the several
States again meet in National convention.
The East and the West and the North and
the South have very many interests that
are in common, but every section of the
country has local interests of vast im
portance to it which in some degree con
tiict with the interests of all other sec
tions. Therefore the party's platform
should be so constructed that all interests
will be harmonized. This can be done,
but only after a clear and comprehensive
presentation has been made of the needs
and requirements of each section and a
frank willingness evinced to make con
cessions here and there.
This being true the importance of hav
ing the interests of California clearly and
forcibly presented to the convention is
evident. It may and it may not have oc
curred to the other sections of the country
that California, and the whole Pacific
Coast as well, ia very much in need of
having her channels of commercial oper
ations and the avenues of her trade pro
duction and interchange strengthened,
but anyway a great opportunity to pre
sent and analyze these requirements will
be afforded in the St. Louis convention,
and it would be an inexcusable derelic
tion of duty on the part of California's
representatives in the convention if they
should fail to stand and earnestly plead
for their State. Some of the immediate
needs of California are a liberally subsi
dized merchant marine, liberal appropri
ations for the improvement of rivers and
harbors and coast defense, and a broad
and comprehensive plan of irrigation. The
agricultural, mining and commercial pros
perity of the State depends largely upon
securing these things from the General
Government.
But if we send our delegation to St. Louis
imder strict instructions to make the nom
ination of this or that candidate of para
mount importance will not they be shorn
of all influence with the platform comm
ittee first and finally with the conven
tion itself? Human nature is substan
tially the same everywhere, and it is rea
sonable to suppose tbat the nominee
would not forget California if her dele
gates fought him through every ballot un
der instructions from their party. On the
other hand, if he whom our delegates sup
port under instructions is nominated, he
would not feel bound to go out of his way
to serve California, because it probably
would occur to him that California had
secured enough in the nomination of her
choice. If, however, our delegates go to
see that a platform is not constructed with
out considering the needs of California,
and are free and untrammeled to espouse
the cause of this State from every stand
point of argument and presentation, we
may be sure that they will accomplish
great good for this great commonwealth of
oursâ the State of California. In the
name of sound business sense, and in the
name of . the natural and undeniable
claims of California upon the National
Government, let our delegates go fully
equipped to do their whole duty by their
State.
INEXHAUSTIBLE TBEASUBES.
It is wonderful to read in the annual
report of the Superintendent of the San
Francisco Mint that out of the fifty-seven
counties in the State thirty-three are regu
lar producers of gold. The amounts ran
last year from $144 for Orange County to
$1,789,815 for Nevada County. Eight pro
duced over half a million dollars each
and five over a million each. The total
was $15,334,317, besides $599,789 in silver.
The gold area occupies the major part of
the State, sweeping in a broad semicircle
from the northern coast eastward, thence
down the Sierra Nevada and ending in a
broad base near the southern end of the
State.
This is a stretch of country 700 miles
long and of a width varying from a few
miles to more than a hundred. It covers
all of the State except the great interior
valleys and the coast mountains south of
Eel River. In the gold territory there
exists, besides the precious metals, inex
haustible stores of timber, a bewildering
list of valuable minerals that have haraly j
yet been touched, and millions of acres of
as good farming land as can be found in
the world. To mention the deposits of
gold is but to begin the list of the treas
ures with which these magical mountains
are filled.
Even gold is found in every conceivable
formation suited to its presence, and hence
the methods of mining and extracting ap
oear in amazing variety. Extending all
down the Pacific Coast, from the inacces
sible regions of Alaska far toward the
southern extremity of South America,
there is a vast tortuous wrinkle on the face
of the earth, in the upheaval ot which the
great layers of rock confining the internal
vapors of the shrinking world were broken.
Through these fissures the mighty forces
beneath expended their energies, in some
places producing stupendous volcanoes,
in others slowly depositing precious min
erals ejected in a vaporous state. Glaciers
likely brought down much of our rclacer
gold from the far north; ancient rivers,
later broken and lifted skyward by the
great upheaval, certainly did. In addi
tion to these enormous deposits imported
from a distance and left on the soil of Cal
ifornia, nature has maintained a local
workshop of incredible size for the manu
facture of the precious minerals on our
own soil. The geological history of gold
in California is a splendid story.
And yet gold is only one of the items of
natural wealth possessed by the State. In
most of the counties which produce it are
orchards yielding frnite and wines of the
rarest and most valuable kinds, and min
eral waters of a variety and curative effi
ciency greater than any part of Europe
can boast. Over all these treasure- stores,
only in tne incipiency of their discovery,
let alone their development, are conditions
of climate which make existence among
them pleasant, wholesome and inspiring.
San Francisco, the metropolis and center
of all these sources of wealth, and sitting
with an open gate for the traffic of the
Orient, is awaiting a greatness surpassing
imagination.
AN ALLUBING HOPE.
Professor Roentgen is said to be hopeful
that the mysterious X-ray may be found
to be an efficacious germicide. He does
not doubt the assertion of Professors Pratt
and Wightman, the indefatigable American
investigators, that the ray is fatal to the
bacillus of diphtheria, and he is disap
pointed that the germ of cholera does not
yield to its killing effect. He promises to
pursue these lines of investigation, having
provided himself with an excellent equip
ment for the work.
The celerity with which the fertile and
eager American mind turned its attention
to this possible power of the ray is one of
the most interesting phases of the subject.
While the scientists of Europe achieve
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL J9, 1&96.
noble results by the exercise of infinite
patience and a calm devotion to science
for its- own sake, give the American
student a hint and at once his imagination
is inflated and his daring challenged. In
spectacular scientific achievements, par
ticularly those involving mechanics,
Americans lead the world, but most of the
groundwork of discoveries and inventions
for the alleviation of suffering is laid in
the patient laboratories of the Old World.
Professor Roentgen says he has already
thought of the possibility discovered by
Professors Pratt and Wightman, but with
characteristic European slowness he has
not yet made himself ready to begin the
investigation. The idea staggers the im
aeination. Whether the marvelous ray is
a germicide by dynamic or by chemical ac
tion no one has ventured to say, if indeed
a clear distinction could be drawn between
the two operations in thia case. Either
view suggests bewildering possibilities.
The microscope may assist in solving the
problem, but the vista thus opened lies so
near the ultimate reach of that wonderful
instrument as to bring discovery within
the haze of guessing. Comparing the
marvelous advance that has been made
since the ray was discovered with the
length of time it was known to exist, and
laying these treasures of achievement and
time alongside those furnished by the
wonderful advances in the manipulation
of the electric current, we may weil stand
with bated breath before the possibilities
which the future holds.
With all this tremendous expenditure
of energy for the healing of disease, is
there a commensurate movement for its
prevention? In externals we have brii
liant inventions enough. We are begin
ning to comprehend the value of drainage
and disinfection, but is there anything
like a corresponding endeavor to master
the science of intelligent individual living?
Until the scientific and reformatory forces
separately at work join forces for the com
mon good, and the world comes to prefer
substantial and wide- reaching to spectacu
lar and restricted results, we shall not see
the dawn of intelligent progress.
A CALIFORNIA IDYL.
Among the idyls of Scottish life told by
the author of "The Bonnie Brier Bush"
for the enjoyment of all who delight "in
fair passions and bountiful pities and loves
w ithout stain," there is none which
awakens a more responsive chord in the
heart of the reader than that which tells the
story how the farmers of Drumtocbty, in
genuine kindliness, went forth to plow the
fields of a neighbor who was too sick to
plow them for himself. This story, told
with more than ordinary grace, has given
the world a glimpse into the true heart of
Scotland and revealed the life of the plain
people there under one of its finest aspects.
We have not yet had that faithful chron
icling of the minor events of life in Cali
fornia that has been given to those of
Scotland, and consequently the ways of the
world here seem harder and neighbors less
kindly than they are in that land whose
every gentle instinct has been made the
theme of song and story by men of genius
and of worth. There are abundant evi
dences, however, that all the finer facts of
life are here and that only the coming of
the true writer is needed to make it known
to the world that California has her idyls
not less lovely than those of the land of
Burns and Scott.
While in the hurry of things and the
great events of the day the press largely
overlooks these little "unremembered acts
of kindness that make the tenor of good
men's rives," it is fortunate that here and
there among the country weeklies there is
an editor with an eye keen enough to see
them, an instinct fine enough to value
them, and an appreciation of them
sufficient to give them space in
the records of his papeA Editor Edes
of the Morgan Hill Sun is one of these.
He not only makes his paper one of the
best in the country considering the size of
the community that supports it, but he
makes it a true chronicle of the life of peo
ple there, and accordingly shows that
neighborhood now and again under as
pects as idyllic and Arcadian as any that
have been revealed to us since the days
when Greece was young and the golden
age prevailed.
In the course of these weekly chronicles
the Sim has recorded of Morgan Hill an
event exactly similar to that which makes
so grateful an idyl when told of Drum
tochty. A party of orchardists in that
district went forthwith their teams and as
an act of neighborly good-will plowed the
ten-acre orchard of their sick neighbor, and
then, not weary of well-doing, went fur
ther and plowed five acres for one man
and six for another who happened to be
behind in their work.
The California incident is more notable
than the Scottish one, because the people
of Morgan Hill have not been life-long
neignbors and old schoolmates bound by
ties of kinship and marriage as were those
of Drumtochty. They have known one
another but a few years. The orchards
planted when the town was founded
have not yet ripened their first fruits.
Nevertheless the community itself has
already ripened the best fruits pi so
cial life, as is shown by this inci
dent. There is one moral to the sub
ject which should not be overlooked. If
out of simple deeds of this kind Scottish
writers can make tales that are read the
wide world over, surely California writers
can find in similar themes an opportunity
to give the outsiders a truer conception of
California life lhan by depicting it as
made up of the rough scrambles of the
mining; camps and the coarse tragedies of
evil natures. California should be known
not only as the land of golden sunshine,
fruits and mines, but of golden hearts as
well.
A GEEAT CONVENTION.
The opportunity offered the people of
San Francisco to secure the international
convention of the United Society of Chris
tian Endeavor, to be held in July of next
year, is one that the City cannot afford to
neglect. At the last international conven
tion, held in Boston, the number of dele*
gates in attendance was 50,000; it is
thought that at least 30,000 may be ex
pected here. The amount of money asked
for is only $25,000, which is one-fourth the
amount so readily subscribed for the Re
publican National Convention.
The great body ol this useful organiza
tion is composed of earnest workers in the
affairs of lifeâ the upper "middle class,"
educated, intelligent, leading clean and
industrious lives and devoted to the pro
motion of correct livine. It is a great
army of enthusiastic young men and wo
men, representing the cream ot busy and
useful humanity. Its influence is against
vice and for industry, thrift and educa
tion. The comprehensive scope of its or
ganization prevents antagonisms engen
dered by sectarianism in the Christian
faith.
For the prosecution of its work it re
quires the ablest thinkers in science, art
and economics, great instructors and lead
era who are masters of their several pro
fessions. Their services are engaged as
public lecturers, and in the approaching
convention they will be assembled from
all parts of the world. These distinguished
persons wield a vast influence. Being
teachers they are also students, and will
be eager to learn and afterward to talk
about the wonders of California. Their
influence is all the more valuable from the
fact that their pupils are glad to learn and
to profit by their knowledge. These pupils
are largely the millions who are being in
structed in the colleges and universities of
the world.
The "Endeavorers" themselves must
make a close study of California in order
to be consistent. It is part of their self
assumed duty to learn and teach every
thing that may benefit the race. If they
should (as they certainly would) find in
California superior natural conditions for
the development of all that is highest and
best in human nature, they will preach and
teach California throughout Christendom.
They will tell the world of the wonderful
spot where gold awaits the digging and
the rarest fruits the planting, and where
physical vigor, unhampered by adverse
natural conditions, expands with mental
growth and spiritual elevation. Their in
fluence would bring to California a popu
lation of sturdy, earnest, upright, God
fearing, educated and industrious people
eager to assist us in solving the great prob
lems which await us and out of which
priceless blessings to humanity will flow.
A CONVENIENT FORM.
The Call desires to draw particular at
tention not only to the increased size of
to-day's issue but also to its convenient
form. It will be observed that the thirty
two paÂ»es appear in only two parts, in
stead of four or more, as is customary with
other papers. This prevents scattering
and loss. It may have been noticed that
for nearly a year the weekday editions of
The Call, consisting of sixteen pages,
have appeared in one part. This has been
a great convenience to readers of the paper
and is explained by the fact that The Call
has the latest ana most improved presses.

UNPLEDGED DELEGATES.
Oakland Tribune.
California is about to have an opportunity to
secure the greatest amount of influence for the
National Hepubican Convention soon to be
held in St. Louis. In order to secure the great
est amount of influence the delegates should
go to that convention unpledged for or against
any man. It is probable that a majority of the
Republicans of the State are in favor of the
nomination of McKinley. But they should go
to the convention free to vote for him or for
any other candidate who at that time may
seem most available.
With this freedom the votes of the California
delegation may turn the scale in favor of some
successful candidate. California will be want
ing many things of the next administration,
it is assumed that it will be Republican. The
delegates will in all probability attend a Presi
dent-making convention. Their influence will
be recognized in a much greater degree if there
is freedom to take advantage of the largest op
portunities. It would be an unfortu
nate circumstance If the delegation were tied
up by pledges to support some one man be
cause such pledges necessarily antagonize all
other candidates. Fortunately, every name
that has been prominently brought forward in
connection with a nomination is that of a
good man. California would be well served by
either of such men as McKinley, Reed, Alli
son, Morton or Harrison. There may be even
a greater number of names before the conven
tion. It certainly would not be a fortunate
circumstance, if, by reason of pledges, the dele
gation from thiÃ State were compelled, tnrough
thick and thin, to stand by an unsuccessful
candidate.
It is safe to promise that good men will be
selected as delegates, who, having personal
preferences, would be ready to sink these for a
common good. California has been left out in
the cold on many occasions because her in
fluence has not been sufficiently felt in Na
tional councils. Here is a golden opportunity.
An unpledged delegation can make its in
fluence felt in this President-making conven
tion beyond all that could be exerted by a
delegation tied up by pledges.

IN LESS SERIOUS MOOD.
Richard Mansfield, the brilliant actor, whose
genuine merits would seem to deserve more
substantial recognition than has been accorded
them at the hands of the public during the
past week, had an exceedingly haughty not
to say overbearing way about him up to a few
years ago. He held tyrannic sway, as it were,
behind the curtain, and it was common for
stage managers to take upon themselves
excra pains to gratify Richard's wishes and
even his whims as far as their business went.
In Spokane, Wa6h., however, Richard was
taken sadly aback. There he came in con
tact with Jack Quinn, a scene manager,
who had been familiar in olden days with
Booth and McCullough and who was a
prince at his work. Jack always sought to
avoid cause for complaint and especially did
he so act in the case of Mansfield. But a kick
was inevitable. A couple of scene-shifters,
after some laborious work in the files, came
down to the rear of the stage breathing rather
heavily as a result of their exertions. Mans
field chanced to walk near them. He nearly
froze them with a look. Then he summoned
Quinn.
"The breathing of these men annoys me,"
said Richard.
"I'd answer to the law if I stopped it," re
plied Jack, with ready wit.
A stage-hand slipped and danced about a
little in the effort to regain his balance.
"Your men make too much noise with their
feet," exclaimed the actor.
"Hereafter they'll walk on their hands," was'
the response.
Mansfield had no more use for Quinn and
during the remainder of the engagement they
spoke to each other only when it was abso
lutely necessary.
The Nation has worried through nearly four
years since, in a misguided moment, it placed
the White House for the second time at the
disposal of that ponderous individual whose
physical immensity is so ill-proportioned to
his intellectual capacity. Delegates and spec
tators shouted till the canvas of the Chicago
Wigwam swelled like the skin of an over
charged balloon at the mention of the only
name that Democracy felt able to conjure
with. And how they did singâ under the lead
ership of that now departed Pennsylvanian,
whose widest fame was in the fact that he
originated the verses which Democracy has
sorely regrettea that ever it closed its eyes to
repeat:
Grover, Orover,
Four years more of Grover.
Accidentally running across those lines in
an old paper, the other day, the thought oc
curred to me that an edition "revised and cor
rected up to date" might not fail altogether
of appreciation among Democrats who were
unremembered in the distribution of Federal
loaves and fishes. It can't be expected, how
ever, that they will snout with that old-time
enthusiasm, or even at all, the following lines,
which (and it is saying precious little for
them) are fully up to the literary standard of
the Wigwam verses:
Grover, Grover,
One year more of Grover!
Out he goes, iv we go
for better food than clover!
Grover swore to give us pie
And cake the Nation over;
Grover got the pie and cake;
Ail he gave wasâ Grover !
Gave it almost rough enough
To tip the country over.
Won't the Natiou have it rich
Oace we're rid of Grover!
Grover, Grover,
One year more of Grover â
Then the workshops will resume.
Woeful times be over.
Wages then will take n jump,
Blest be every section,
fcioon as we are safe beneath
The rests of protection !
Labor's face be joyous bright.
Hardships gone with Grover;
Nation be Itself when ibts
One short year is over.
I have a country friendâ a whole-souled,
honest fellowâ whose good-will I value even
more highly than Governor Budd values the
applause for which his grand-stand plays are
baited. A few days ago my country friend
visited the City, and, incidentally, my first
floor flat. The painters had just adorned the
front doorsteps with an azure dress, and bad
placed a few boards temporarily across the ap
proach from the sidewalk, for a very obvious
reason. Visitors, in the meantime, were wel
comed through a side door. My country friend
came unexpectedly, crawled over the barri
cade, slipped on the bottom step, recovered
himself, and then, with a proud air, mastered
the ascent to the door.
"Oh!" exclaimed the horrified servant, "the
steps are freshly painted."
"Don't mention it," said my good-natured
friend, "these shoes has been wearin' nigh
onto three years, and ain't much, nohow."
Like all pleasures, the visit came to an end,
and my relatives diplomatically sought to save
the balance ot the work on those front steps.
"Excuse me, but this is the shorter way
out," observed one of my relatives, moving
toward the side door.
"Jest a few extra steps won't tire me, I
guess," was the response; "I'll jest mosey out
the way I came."
"But you'll get yourself all covered with
paint, I fear."
"Don't bother about me, now." he laughed.
"I don't mind the paint a particleâ it won't
hurt these shoes, nohow."
And with a farewell wave of his hand he
started down the steps, slipping and regaining
his balance a number of times as he went, but
always exhibiting a delightfully careless man
ner.
I almost expected him to shout back, after
he had fallen over the fence to the sidewalk
(and after ruining a. neat job and necessitating
a recall of the painters), "Don't you dare to
think of buyin' me new shoes â I wont
wear 'em."
Oh, summer girl, deceive not me!
Thy tale Is music to mine ear;
Yet am X warned, and much I fear
To put my soulful trust In thce.
If frank tliou art, thoa wilt not move
Whilst I apply these Roentgen rays;
Thou wilt not tremble while I gaze
The trueness of thy heart to prove.
Oh, summer girl, forgive! 'Tls clear
My love, and mine alone, thou art !

Old-timers in literary walks hereabout will
recollect the genial Colonel Will Visscher, al
though many s year has flitted by since the
colonel's ever-present smile and joy-empur
pled nose were in evidence in this metropolis.
While in the Northwest, half a dozen years
ago, a guest of the colonel, it was my pleasure
to attend a banquet at which Visscher was
the lion of the evening. The bohemian vet
eran, a veteran bohemian, was In those days
conducting a trl-weekly newspaper in a boom
town, and living, temporarily, in bachelor
style In an apartment adjoining his editorial
room. An hour or so after retiring Visscher
suddenly sprang out of bed. felt his way to the
editorial desk, turned on the electricity, drew
up a chair, grasped a pen and began wedding
thought to paper. An idea for a poem had
struck him and he made haste to indite a num
ber of verses.
"Egadl" he exclaimed, as he dropped the
pen and settled back in his chair; "Egad, if I
only had all the champagne I wanted I could
write poetry as brilliant as ever you read, sah,
and any quantity of it. Champagne makes
me scintillate, sah â scintillate."
He recited the verses written a moment be
fore. They were certainly good. "That cham
pagne dinner did the work, sah," explained
the colonel.
In Visscher's presence, the day following, I
told the story of the champagne poem.
"Fact," he admitted, "positive fact."
"Colonel," put in an old friend who had been
listening, "if a new gem of thought had been
discovered in your mind by every bottle of
champagne you have ever consumed, and if
you had put every one of those gems into
verse, you would long ago have written all
around Shakespeare, Milton and Byron."
A Syndicate Letter, whose birthplace was an
Eastern village, attained a rather flourishing
condition. It had known suffering. Early in
its career it had shivered from the effects of
cold receptions accorded by an Exacting Home
Press. It was gifted, however, with the virtue
of perseverance, and it said, "I may yet dis
cover some distant places where I shall not
shrink before the Critical Frown, and where I
may find preferment, by reason of the cheap
ness of my services, over Literature that ie
dearer and of better parts." The Syndicate
Letter underbid all rivals, and obtained many
contracts to fill space at very low rates of com
pensation. When the Exacting Press in the
Eastern village heard what financial success
the Syndicate Letter bad met with it remarked,
with a pitying look, "It is too bad that the
Press in those distant places should be act l
ated by no higher motive than that of filling
apace at the smallest cost. I care not for
the acquaintance oi the Syndicate Letter,
and when the people of those distant places
learn to value good home productions in liter
ature more than the mediocre article with the
stamp of importation upon it, then will the
Syndicate Letter retire to its native shade."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
One oi the strange and entirely unique char
acters of one of the old and now rapidly ad
vancing gold camps is W. P. Gaither, known
by the sobriquet of "Tennessee." Indeed, by
this lest name and not by the other is he
known throughout the various mining towns
of Tuolumne, Calaveras, Mariposa and other
counties.
"Tennessee" lives at Angels, and it is said that
there is no man, woman or child in trouble
that "Tennessee" does not at once set out
to render aid to in some way. He has
raised many a subscription in a modest
way for the sick, and he has devoted a great
| deal of time personally to those who are ailing.
j Every woman in the camp is his friend and
he is usually found choring around, trying to
do something to make somebody happy. It
j would appear that Dickens' story of the
I "Cherryble Brothers" and their charities was
finding a living illustration in Angels, only
that "Tennessee" is nocapitalist, as they were,
and simply does what he can, as the widow did
I on an occasion long ago.

I needy woman who came by the stage to
Angels to find her husband. The husband
was not there. She was entirely out of money,
I and so Tennessee, the refuge of all Angels in
i hours of momentary sorrow, set about to see
| what could be done for her. Of course her
wants were provided for.
James F. Wardner. the former owner of the
Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines, who has been
in every leading camp from the Black Hills to
the coast, to Africa and elsewhere, is in the
City from Angels. He says Tennessee is the
most remarkable product he has ever seen in.
the various mining camps.
"1 have been in all of them and have seen all
kinds of odd men," he said, "but Tennessee is
the most singular of them all. He cams from
Tennesseeâ Memphis, I believe, and that's
why they call him Tennessee. He is about 4fl
years old and has lived up in the bills a good
many years. He knows all the camps, trail*
and claims, and the quickest way to get there.
"Because of his knowledge of the country he
is often employed to carry telegrams and do
all kinds of erramis, and he doea everything
with a promptness that has wen the confi
dence of every one. He has also acted as a.
guide a great deal, and has piloted many
people to the Calaveras Big Trees. Of course
he gets a little something for all this, but he
gives all his money away in aid oi unfor
tunates as soon as he gets it.
"But he is no loafer. He does something for
all he gets. But it doesn t take much to
keep him.
"He 'is the oddest study lever saw. They
call him everything from a blank fool to
the greatest humanitarian. Its just as you
take him. Just now he is taking care ot a
lambâ ieeding it by a nursing-bottle.
"But I must tell you a joke on Tennessee. To
begin with, he has a glass eye. Well, the other
day he was watering a horse at the watering
trough, when his eye dropped out and fell into
the water. Somebody had put a big cattish in
there, and that fish didn't do a thing but grab
that eye and swallow it. It was the funniest
thing, and Tennessee was so nonplussed at
the fish getting his eye he didn't know what
to do. Of course that fish was slain and the
eye recovered.
| |"One striking thine about Tennessee is his
gentleness. He treats all women with the
greatest kindness, as, in fact, he does all peo
ple, especially those who are sick or with out
means. He doesn't save 25 Cents a month
gives everything away. But Tennessee is no
tramp, either. He is always neat in his appear
ance. Strange nian, Tennessee! I never saw
the like ol him."

AN important contribution to ab
stract political philosophy has
been furnished by Professor W.
W. WtUoaghby of* Johns Hopkins
University in an elaborate study
bearing the title of "An Examination of
the Nature of the State. "
The author defines his purpose to be the
construction of a true system of political
philosophy, the determination of the ulti
mate nature of the state and the grounds
upon which its authority may be justified.
He emphasizes the distinction between
essential nature in politics and mere ap
pearance, between the legal and political
character of forces and institutions and
their actual operation in the arena of
civic life. In this direction he points out
the difference between sovereignty and
public opinion and establishes the legal
omnipotence of the state, separated from
its actual limited coercive power, and the
non-legal character of international prin
ciples shown to be lacking the recognition
of any. obligatory force by civilized peoples.
The essential element* of a state are
found to be three in number: 1. A com
munity of people socially united. 2. A
political machinery terme<t a government
and administered by a corps of officials
termed a magistracy. 3. A body of rules
or maxims written or unwritten determin
ing the scope of this public authority and
the manner of its exercise.
It will be seen from this statement of
its elements that Professor WiUoughby
treats of the state as an abstraction quite
distinct from its organization or adminis
tration. Tee term "state" therefore as
used by him must not be taken as a syno
nym for either "government," '-nation"
or ''people." These phrases signify con
crete things which may differ from one
another in quality or degree, but in the
idea of a state there can b* no conception
of comparative excellence. In other
words there can be no such thing as an
imperfect state.
Proceeding to a consideration of the
origin of the str.te Professor WiUoughby
traces the various theories which have
been advanced on the subject by eminent
political philosophers. These theories in- j
elude the Patriarchal, or the doctrine that
the state is an outgrowth of the family; i
the Instinctive, which teaches that the
state is an outcome of the natural soci
ability of man; the Utilitarian which re-:
gards the state as one of the utilities of
human life; :he Force theory, or the
doctrine that the state is the result of the
coercion of the masses by the strong; the
Divine, by which the state is held to be a
creation of God, and the Contract theory,
which derinesthe state as the outcome of
A governmental compact between the pec
pie of a p>.rt:cu:ar community by which
they agree to act together under" certain
istied forms for mutual benefit and
protection.
After an elaborate review of these vari
ous theories and an historical account of
the basis on which each of them rests.
Professor Willonghby advances what he
regards as the true origin of the state.
This he concludes 'o be "a sentiment of
community of feeling and mutuality of
interest," which rinds expression for itself
in the creation of political power. He
quotes approvingly the saying of the
Austrian publicist Jeliinek:" "The inner
ground of the origin of the state is the
fact that an ut-gregate of persons has a
conscious feeling oi unity, and sives cx
i cession to this unity by organizing itself
Bfl 3. collective personality, and consti
tuting itself as a volitional and active sub- i
ject." That is to say, the origin of the
state is to besought in psychology and not \
in cohtics, utility or divinity. Where this ;
I -ycDologicsl unity exists, we have the
true State, but in political organizations
w. ere it does not exist we have only a â 
mechanical union or compiexus or atoms
held together by force, and forming a gov
ernment indeed, but in no sense consti- i
tuting what is rightly a state.
Out of this theory that a state is the oat
come of a sentiment of unity among a
people there flow momentous conse- j
quences. As men advance in knowledge of
one another and their thoughts widen with '
a;i increabing liberality, it "becomes possi- i
bie for states to expand and include ;arger ;
and larger aggregates of men. With the
growing development of the sentiment of
humanity there is a tendency toward the
final establishment of a world-state in
cluding all the earth and all the nations
thereat in one va?t whole acting in con
cord under harnionii us lair.
Pro:es=or Wiiloughby, while admitting
this tendency, does- not believe tbe world- j
state will ever be accomplished within j
any limits of time that m;iy be estimated j
now. Hesays: "As timegoes on the as- i
sociution of states will unucubtedlv grow I
closer and the rule of iiiternational'moral
ity will increase in both force and number, |
but that a genuine world-state embracing j
the civilized nations of the world will ever
be established does not Beem possible. !
Sucb a type would require the surrender !
of the sovereignty and independence of the
individual nations â a surrender to which
it is not conceivable they will ever sub
mit. 5 '
Many interesting questions concerning
the development of the modern idea oi the
state, the extent of its powers and the
present tendencies in forms of government
are discussed in the course of the work, but
these we have not the space to pursue.
They, however, are well worth the study
not of political philosophers only, but o"f
the higher order of practical politicians as
well, inasmuch as they help to an under
standing of the political tendencies of t c
time, and are full of suggestions as to the
limits of law and legislation under the
idea of the state as it exists to-day in the
sentiments of the people of civilized na
tions.

A PARTING AND A MEETING.
W. D. Howells has given us another story [
that dwells on Shaker life. It is almost
a companion piece to that simple taie of
Quaker innocence, 'The Day of Their
\Vedding." In the latter story a Quaker j
couple flee from the colony of Friends to :
marry and sees happiness in the "outside j
world." The varied experiences of their
.honeymoon convince '.hem that more per
fect contentment is to be found in tbe
colony, and they gladly return to the oM
life. "A Parting and a Meeting" brings us
to the conclusion that, after all, as far as
complete happiness is concerned, life is
pretty much the same every A-bere, and
that, even to tbe end, unsatiatie.l longings
afflict Shakers a:ui worldly fo!n alike.
In the ?reÂ«h novel Ro-er Burton, a
Tiliage teacher, and Chloe Mason, a
physician's daughter, are in iove and
the wedding day is very near, when
for an afternoon's pleasure they visit a
g; akÂ»r settlement not far distant from
their homes. Chloe had visited the Friends
many limes as a child, and she is received
by tbem with much rordiaiity. She informs
theSisiers of her engagement to Roger,
and the twain are regarded with eyes of
wonderment, for engagements and" mar
' riages have no place in Shaker life. Roger ;
i and Chloe are shown through the famly
house; then an old Brother accompanie* I
Roger through the workshops, explaining i
! many things; while the girl is being en- j
] tertained b.v the Sisters, The youn^ man
is in a very thoughtful mood when the
j homeward journey is besun. Learning
; from Chloe's lips* that the Sisters had
, tried to induce her to join their
i angelic order, Roger clasps the
| girl's hands, and begs her to return
' to the settlement straightway. - He de
! Clares that he has been convinced that :
true happiness â¢â xi'-ts there and there ;
alone. '"Those people have found peace," <
; says Roger, "and ail the rest of the world is '
at war. I can remember my own father and
mother even. They thought all the world '
of each other, but they were always dis
! puting and quarreling". Look . around, at
; all married people; every house is a scene
of contention. against will always."
He pleads with Chloe to join the
Friends with, him, saying that his
. life will be nothing without her. ;
! She will neither go nor prevent Roger i
i from going, and so they give each other
! up. Roger returns to the settlement and
1 is received among the Friends with joy.
Three-score years elapse, and the author
brings about a meeting between Chloe and
Roger in extreme age â he is ninety and
â , she eighty. /; >* â ':.
Chloe had married within a year after
; parting with Burton, and now she was
paying a visit to the Shakers in
! company with a grandchild. Once
', more the lovÂ»rs of sixty years
gone-by meet. She had sought happiness j
, in herown way; and he in his, and neither i
I has found it complete. "I've had the best '
the earth can give," says Chloe, "and I |
have seen my children grow around me, â¢
and now my grar.children, and yet I don't
know, Roger, but what I'd have done as
'â  well had I stayed here with you that
i day." He laughed as if it all affected
I him humorously. "Yes," he replied,
"I've lived the angelic' lite, as
you Â«ay, and it's been all I evtr
, expected. I've had peace ; I don't deny I
! that, and I haven't had any sorrow or
trouble. And still I'm not sure but I'd
have done ai>out as well to go with

is a master portrayaL The story is admi
rably told, and a considerable insight into ;

MRS. E. BURKE COLLINS.
Prominent among the literary women of
this country to-day is Mrs. E. BurKe Col
lins of New Orleans. Her success as a
story writer has been phenomenal. She
has contributed to nearly all the leading
periodicals in the United States, writing |
in all, according to Book News, ninery-six j
novels and serial stories, together with j
thousands of short stories, sketches and !
poems. The amount of writing she ac- !
compli-hes in a given time is said to be!
j wonderful. Mrs. E. Burke Collins is a
native of Rochester, N.Y.,, and on the
maternal side is a direct descendant of the
Whitin i family of GreatÃarringtoh.Mass.,
I whose published genealopy traces the fam
ily back GOO years. Among, her ancestors
was the famous Captain John Mason, who \
saved from hostile savages the earliest set- i
tlers of Connecticut. Her first article was i
written at the ase of 9. At 15 she left i
school and was married to E. Burke Col
-1 lins, a rising young lawyer of Rochester,
and under whose name as a norn de
j plume she still writes. Shortly after
' the marriage they moved to the milder
\ climate of Louisiana, where, within a year,
! an accident left Mrs. Coilins n. widow
among comparative strangers. She was
: almost alone in The world and she real
ized that the-strug for subsistence was
before her. She had previously written
for pastime; now she decided on" the pen j
as a means of livelihood. Only a girl in |
years, she: conceived -and executed the :
daring scheme of starting a purely literary .
t journal in New Orleans. T:me and place
: were unpropitious for the enterprise. De
spite the exertion of all her splendid en
ergies the venture did not pay. and her
finances being exfiausted after a few
months the journal was discontinued.
That venture, however/gave her prestige
in the literary worM ; orJers poured in
upon her from publishing houses and her
literary success was assured.
SUSANNAH.
The new novel "Susannah," by Mary E.
Mann, concerns the fortunes of a girl who,
with two other sisters and a brother, starts
out a penniless orphan to make her own
way in the world. The story shows "how j
salt his food who fares J. upon another's j
bread.' The brother is taken by an uncle, i
a clergyman, who provides very scantily
for his charge during a school course, and \
an aunt supports the two eldest girls until j
they are oideriough to secure positions of |
some sort. Susannah, the youngest, the |
homeliest and the favorite, is adopted by j
her mother's old friend, Mrs. Foote. who [
is a very wealthy widow, and who helps to
sustain a number of cbaritab'e societies,
yet who nearly starves herself and the j
members of her household. Mrs. Foote's
only son, Percival, remains away from
home on account of his mother's close
habits. : At ' home he could never , get
enough to eat, and he is pained to see Su
sannah being made to perform domestic
service. Percival and Susannah become
engaged" against Mrs. Foote's will. : Then !
the girl hears of the illness of her brother !
Alfred, seeks him out and attends him in '<
a common boarding-house, where she en- I
lists as a servant to defray, expenses. Evil \
influences are around her, but she bravely
combats them,; and her brother's pbysi- j
cian. Dr. Hartley, proves a noble friend to '
her. Alfred win^s up a dissipated career
by suicide. In seeking for. her brother at :

remarks that one of the best examples,
perhaps, of the necessity of constantly ap
pealing to the most elementary and gener

the continuance under British dominion
of slavery in Zanzibar. In bis essay on
"Political Economy and Journalism," Mr. !
Nicholson appeals to journalists "to make

treating practical Questions â not merely
because it will improve their professional !

NON-HEREDITY OF INEBRIETY.
Leslie E. Keeley, M.D., LL.D., has writ
ten a treatise on a subject upon which he |
may presumably be accepted as an author- ;
ity. The question as to whether or not !
chronic alcoholism can be transmitted j
from father to son, from generation to gen
eration, is one that has been discussed !
since time immemorial, and it is a much- '
mooted point even to-day.
Of the attitude adopted by practitioners
toward inebriety, Dr. Keeley says:
"Until within a few years no treatment,
except mind cure, has ever been tried. >
Those who regarded inebriety as a sin pre- i
scribed religion; those esteeming it a â 
social vice have enjoined pledge-signing; !
those who consider it a crime pronounce ;
the sentence or line or imprisonment. All j
of these methods have had more or less
success. The inebriate may refrain from i
drinking because he fears punishment, or ;
believes some mental influence has cured j
him, or because his pledge stimulates his !
will to abstain; but none of these things '
can cure the disease. The mental

The writer of the present work devotes

AN EPITOME OF 9PENCEB.
No man has performed a greater service
to the English reader for years than has ;
j the author, or compiler, of "An Epitome |
i of the Synthetic Philosophy of Herbert i
! Spencer." To take ten large volumes, con
i taining as they do both a general and a
; detailed survey of the highest and the (
i broadest philosophy that the Western j
World has given birth to, and reduce their j
contents to one volume of 500 odd pages >
of good sized type, seems almost a her
| culean task. This, however, has been the
| self-apnointed task of F. Howard Collins,
j and that he has done the work well we
' have the warrant of Herbert Spencer's
own words for stating. '"The condensed
i statements are at once correct and clear," i
I writes the great English philosopher him
; self in an introduction to the book. "In
; deed, I have been somewhat surprised that \
i it has proved possible to put so much into
! so small a space without sacrifice of in
j telligibility."
With the epitome at band even "the â¢
j busy man," about whom so much is writ- I
j ten to-day, may become tolerably convers
i ant with the synthetic philosophy. How- '
j ever, it is only the fiu*y man, mentally, â 
i who cares much for philosophy and has
I the time to inquire into the nature ana â !
! causes of things. He will prize the book i
I highly, even though already on sneaking j
! terms with >Jr. spencer's great works. I
It will fit well on the shelf alongside of I
He-bert Spencer's complete works, and I
will prove invaluable as a reference book I
to every library in the world. [New York:

William Eleroy Curtis, author of "Span
ish Capitals jof ; America," has written a
volume entitled, "Venezuela, a Land
Where It's Always Summer," in which
that country is described with much de
tail and, apparently, in the light of a
thorough knowle ige of the facts. ,It .af
fords a better view of the much-talked-of
South American Republic than any book
so far issued this year. It contains a
large amount of historical matter relative
to Venezuela and devotes chapters ito the
birth of Sonth American -independence,
Simon Bolivar, the Washington of Scuth
America, Guzman Blanco and other rulers
of Venezuela. The 1 characteristics of the
people and the productiveness of the
country are among the, subjects of treat
ment, and the author also g;ves an ex
haustive account of the question of the
disputed territory. He concludes that
Great Britain has no more title to the
territory she has forcibly occupied than
the United States has to Manitoba or
Chihuahua and no more right' to occupy
the island of Barirna at the mouth of the
Orinoco than the jetties or the Mississippi
or the islands in the harbor of New York.
"She had a title to the latter once, but
never to tbe former." .In his chapter on
agriculture in Venezuela Mr. Curtis says
that one cannot buy coffee plantations
there except for their full value, for they j
have gradually passed into the possession
of men of means, who regard them : as the
safest and most profitable investments.

LITERARY NOTES.
The Overland announces for its May
number the first of an important series of
eight papers on "Unexplored Regions of
the Hig.i Sierra," by Theodore S. Solo
mons. The opening paper, "The Sources
of the San Joaqmn," contains a reraarJt-
able group of photos of peaks and valleys
that have never been known before except
to prospectors and sheepberders. Mr.
Solomons is practically the first "white
man" that has ever traveled from the Yo
sernite to Kings River in the High Sierra
region. A notable sketch map made by
him with n:a:iy newly named peaks is a j
feature cf the article.

Duriaux to classes both of pupils and of
teachers, will consist, hrst, of a textbook
for the use of teachers ; second, of exer
cises issued separately for the use of classes.
Canon Ainger has undertaken to pre
oare an annotated edition of Hood's poems,

critical Introduction, and the serious
poems will for the first time be arranged

In the May number of The Century Miss
Eliza R. Scitlmore writes of the present
aspect of "The Alaska Boundary Ques
tion." Miss Scidmore shows that the
acceptance of the Cameron line, wnich is
put forward by the Dominion Govern
ment, would not only taKe from the
United States several rich mineral sec
tions, but its most unique scenic posses
sions. The Stikine Kiver would go, which
John Muir says is "a Yosemite o:ie hun
dred miles long," the Taku Inlet, Glacier
Bay, and finally, the great Muir glacier it
self. This would prevent United Slates
steamers from land inn passengers in this
region, 1 just as the Canadian excursion
steamer nas been debarred for want of a
custom-house.

side of the first location made on the lode or ve;n.
If a lede or vein 2000 reet in length is discovered
two locations may be made.
Abandonment of a claim is a matter of fact
and of law, and whether a locator has forfeited
his rights or not under certain circumstances
is a matter that should be decided by tbe
propei authorities and not by a newspaper.
The law requires that the necessary amount of
assessment work on a mining location shall be
made first within the year after location and
then after that within the calendar year.

a'e not a careful student of archaeology.

est is that of the Atmelian or Hippodrome of
Constantinople. Two others which formerly
stood at Heliopolis were subsequently

as Cleopatra's Needles. One of these,
which Ion? lay prostrate, was after an adven

The Atolls âC. F. R., Langlois, Curry
County, Or. John Murray, in his theory of the
Atoll or Lagoon Islinds of the South Pacific
Ocean, reverses the order of their growth as
given by Darwin. He enters into a full ex
planation of his reason for reaching the con
clusion he does iv "Structure and Orig.n
of the Coral Reefs." He holds that
the island- building corals began to build
on the tops of volcanic islands which
happened to be at the level convenient for the
polyps. They would, of course, build up to the
surface of thÂ« water and then build outward.
The corals, being dependent ou the ocean for
food, wouid thrive only on the outer edge of a
fallv formed reef, and those on the inner side
of the reef. wouid die out. Hence, fringing
reefÂ«, barrier reefs and atolls, according to cir
cumstances.
The Time Bali.â G., City. The dropping oJ
the time ball on Telegraph Hill at noon each

fore noon each day an observer takes his sta
tion at the foot of the mest on Telegraph Hill
and stands there watch in hand waiting for the
hour of noon. J. T. McMillen, who is stationed
in the office in the Merchants* Exchange,

should by chance be any accident the man on
the hill drops the ball according to the time as
shown by an accurately set watch.
The Arxemiajt Chcrchâ M. H., City.'. The
Armenian church was probably establis*ied as
early as the second century. In theology it at
tributes but one nature to Christ, and holds
: that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father
! a.one. With respects to the seven sacraments
it entertains the notion that at baptism one
must be sprinkled three -times, end as often
dipped;, that confirmation is to be conjoined
with baptism; that the Lord's supper must be
celebrated wi th. pure wine and leavened bread ;
that the latter before being handed round
must be dipped in the former; and that ex
treme unction is to be administered to ec
clesiastics alone, and that, immediately after,
instead of before death. It believes in the
worship of saints, but not in purga
tory. It exceeds the Greek church in
the number of its fasts, and is es
pecially rigid in the observance of these,
but it has fewer relisrious festivals. These are
more enthusiastically kept. In Turkey divine
service is held principally at night. Mass is
celebrated â in the .old Armenian language;
preaching is carried on in the new. Its sac
erdotal constitution differs little from the
Greek. - The head of the church, whose title i*
Catholiko.% resides at Etshmiadzin,- a mon
astery near Erivan, capital or Russian Arme
nia. To this place every Armenian must make
a pilgrimage once in his life. The monks of
this church follow the rule of St. Basil. The
; Wartabieds form a peculiar class of ecclesias
tic-; they live like monks, but are devoted ex
clusively to learning. Secular priests must
' marry once, but none are at liberty to take a
: second wife. . Missionaries from the . evan
gelical churches in the West have had much
success | among tho 'Armenians in gathering
churches and establishing schools and col
leges. The Armenians number 4,000,000, half
of which are in Turkey. There are several
works on the Armenians to be had at the libra
ries. .. -.-. , -, â ;-â â¢â¢-.

THE
THEATRES
A PROPHET is not without honor,
save in his own country and
among his own people, is not
true of dramatic art â outside
America. In France, for in
stance, the whole nation hugs itself when
a Gallic composer or actor wins recognition
abroad â not because foreign honors are
considered capable of conferring distinction
on a French artist, but because it affords
the nation satisfaction to see that other
countries are not dead to the superiority
of French art. This feeling of proprietor
ship and pride in homemade artists is
also to be lound in Italy, Germany and a
number of other countries, which have
encouraged and fostered musical and
dramatic art. In some cases there is a
feeling of positive indignation when the
public is temporarily bereft of its idols by
foreign impresarios.
In America, strange to say, the public
seems to prefer art that is far-fetched and
dear-bought. Actors and singers "made
in Europe" are considered as superior to
the home product as Paris bonnets are
considered to milinery made in San
Francisco. It is easy to prove this
by recalling facts. Eight years ago
Emma Nevada could and did double her
prices in Madrid and Milan, and turned
people away from the door every night; in
San Francisco she suffered for lack of ap
preciation. Mary Anderson was never
tally appreciated at home, and the iron
entered Booth's soul too, though as he is
dead, the evil that men did him, in tbe
way of neglect, is being forgotten, and
Booth is now referred to as an Idol in the
temple of art.
It is painful to recall these facts when
one remembers tbe adulation which for
eign artists so constantly receive in
America. The facts are recalled only to
point a moral, which is this: Richard
Mansfield deserves a vast deal more ap
preciation than he is receiving. If be had
never done anything but Beau Brummell
he would be an ornament to art of which
America should be proud. It is not only
what he does but what he leaves undone
that makes his characterization of the
beau the very mirror held up to nature.
Most players try to show by puppet-like
externals and tricky effects of voice and
gesture the feelings that are supposed to
agitate their hearts, but one feels instinct
ively that in spite of all their bombast
they are hollow within ; a few, a very few,
players possess the power of suggesting a
vast depth of feeling, which they seem to
be rather struggling to hide than exhibit,
and they are the artists; the others are
only mummers.
You need not use the fingers of both
hands to count the actors and actresses
now prominently before the public whose
art is as perfect in its truth to nature as
Mansfield's in "Beau Brummell." Duse
is the head of the school which takes as its
special observance, "O'erstep not the
modesty of nature." Novelli, another
Italian, has an art scarcely inferior to
Duse's, and Constant Coquelin in his own
line is near perfection. Henry Irving is
cursed with an impossible voice and a
halting eait, which give him a fictitious
appearance of staginess, but his power,
like Mansfield's, comes from within. Other
artists, like Ellen Terry, there are who
portray nature truthfully, but outside
those above named there are not any
' prominently before the public who
can give a characterization of such abso
lute truthfulness as does Richard Mans
field in "Beau Brummell."
No doubt when Mansfield is dead â may
the day be far distant â people will put
busts of htm in public places and his
memoirs will be published, recounting all
his struggles, his shortcomings and his
triumpLisâ in fact, the whole Nation will
probably rise up and call him blessed, be
cause he reflected credit on it. But just at
present Mansfield is alive, and it would be
more practical to show now that he is ap
preciated as much as he certainly would be
if he had been "made in Europe."
Baldwin Theater.
The second week of Richard Mansfield's
engagement at the Baldwin Theater will
open to-morrow night with the new play,
"The Story of Rodion the Student." The
plot is based on Dostoyevski's novel,
"Crime and Punishment," the dramatized
version having been made by Charles
Henry Meltzer and Mansfield himself.
. The plot runs something in thiswise:
Rodion is a young Russian law student,
who becomes a socialist and theorist. He
harbors the hallucination that in ridding
the world of any incumbrance on society
he commits a justifiable act, and in pur
suance of his theory murders an old miser
and pawnbroker, who had for a long period
been a stigma to the lower class of St.
Petersburg society. After the murder is
committed .Rodion escapes, and while the
officials feel that he is responsible for the
deed they cannot procure sufficient evi
dence to convict him. The punich
i ment of his crime comes to him,
i however, in the form of remorse,
j and the student finally succumbs under
j the terrible mental strain and surrenders
] himself to the authorities. This role is
; entirely foreign to any of Mansfield's for
| mer creations, and on that account will be
i invested with added interest.
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I eveninss and at the Saturday matinee A. C.
I Gunter's comedy, " Prince KarJ," will be
! presented. On Saturday evening a drama
| tization of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Dr. !
| Jeky'l and Mr. Hyde" will be given. For |
; the third and last week of his engagement !
j Mansfield has arranged to produce '"A Pa- !
risian Romance," "The Story of Rodion
the Student," "Beau Brummell," "The
I Scarlet Letter" and "Prince Karl." Eddie
I Foy will be the attraction to follow Rich
ard Mansfield at the Baldwin.
California Theater.
Roland Reed comes to the California
Theater to-morrow with his new play,
"The Politician," in which he takes the
part of General Joseph Limber, a typical
but comical country politician.
In the general who dabbles in politics
Reed is said to have found a congenial
role. He presents the character of an
active worker, a man who knows every
body and who is willing to engage in any
affair where he can keep a friend or gain a
vote for his side.
Reed professes to have molded the part
on men who have been prominent in the
line of character which he seeks to por
tray. He has studied pictures of Senator
Matthew Quay taken fifteen years ago for
his make-up, and has also taken hints from
the dress and deportment of other men
who are familiar figures in politics.
Miss Isadore Rush, Reed's leading lady,
takes the part of Cieopatra Sturgess, a
; twentieth-century woman, and it is stated
that she invests the character with a good
deal of sweetness and charm.
Columbia Theater.
Audiences at the Columbia this week
will have an opportunity of laughing
over the comicalities of Ezra Ken
dall as the old countryman in
"A Pair of Kids," His imperson
ation of the character is already thor
oughly familiar to the theater-going pub
lic â how he undertakes to run a New
YorK restaurant the way such a place
"orter to be run," winding up with a
league baseball act. This and many other
bits of comedy have already made the
character popular.
"A Pair of Kids" does not profess to be
a drama, but only a farce comedy. The
play depends for interest npon repartee,
hits and droll stage effects, tne action
being consequently dominated by a spirit
of exaggeration and amusing burlesque.
Rivarde's series of concerts begin at the
Columbia Theater on the 27th inst.
The young Franco-Spanish violinist will
be assisted by Lachaume, the pianist, who
I appeared here witn Ysaye last year, and i
William H. Keith, the barytone, who is
just returning home to this City, for the
first time after his European success.
Theie will also be an orchestra under the
direction of H. J. Stewart.
Grover's Alcazar.
The special attraction at Grover's Alca
zar to-morrow evening will be the first ap
pearauce as a professional of Mrs. Auzerais
Hoyte. As an amateur this lady has at
tracted considerable attention.
The pieces chosen for her debut are the
curtain-raiser, "The Setting of tbe Sun,"
and the favorite comedy, "Everybody's
Friend." As Mrs. Featherley she will
have a good chance of displaying her |
ability. A feature of her performance will j
be a number of gowns obtained by Mrs. j
Hoyte on her recent trip to Paris.
The support will include Hereward I
Hoyte, who has been specially engaged for
the occasion, and Leonard Grover Jr., who
will appear in his well-known impersona
tion of Major Wellington de Boots. The
piece will be conscientiously mounted and i
carefully costumed. Regular matinees \
will be given on Wednesday, Saturday
and Sunday.
Tivoli Opera-House.
The second edition of "Blue Beard" will
be presented at the Tivoli Opera-house to
morrow night when the members of the
cast will appear in new specialties, includ
ing songs, dancea and localisms. Ferris
Hartman, John J. Raffael, W. H. West,
Thomas C. Leary, Carrie Roma, Kate !
toarchi, the De Fillippis, Gilbert and 1
Goldie, Gertrude Aylward, Fred Kava
nagh and the others wilt all have additions
to their roles.
One of the features of the new edition I
will be the Chevalier medley of coster bal- I
lads, to sing which Ferris Hartman will
make up in imitation of Chevalier, the |
English music-hall singer, who has been j
the race in New York.
After the run of "Blue Beard" Dellin
ger'e romantic opera "Lorraine" will be '
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
presented, to be followed by a scenic pro
duction of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and the
revival of Planquette's favorite opera,
"The Chimes of Normandy."
Grand Opera-House.
A comedy-drama entirely new to San
! Francisco will be presented at the Grand
I to-morrow night. The work bears the
j rather striking title of "Special Delivery."
The United States postoffice furnishes
the main incident in the plot, which is
said to be uncommon and interesting.
The scenes are all laid in and about New
York, among them being one of special
novelty. It will represent exactly the
delivery department of a metropolitan
postoffice in full operation.
Another picture promised is a view of
Harlem River by moonlight, the scene of
tbeone tragedy in the story.
No less than seven specialties are to be
introduced in the postoffice scene. They
include character sketches and new songs,
grave and gay. The full strength of the
Morosco company will be required for the
cast.
At the Orpheum.
What is said to be the strongest travel
ing vaudeville organization in America is
billed to appear at the Orpheum to-mor
row evening. It is the Hopkins Trans
oceanic Combination, under the manage
ment of Robert Fulerora, who states that it
is the best equipped troupe he has ever
brought to the coast.
Among a number of artists of interna
tional reputation be points with special
pride to the Rossow Bros., the Lilliputian
Sandows and imitators of Corbeit and
Fitzsimmons.
These dainty mites of men, Franz and
Carl, were born in Vienna 22 and 18 years
ago respectively. Up to the present "time
they have only attained the respective
heights of 30 and 26 inches, and turn the
scales in order at 26 pounds and 16 pounds
Tneir lather, who accompanies them,
weighs over 300 pounds and stands 6 feet 2
inches, and their mother was a German
woman of normal size. The little fellows
are handsome and perfectly formed. They
are splendidly developed muscularly and
are said to be lithe and graceful athletes.
Their boxing act is said to be an extremely
amusing exhibition, as both manikins were
trained in the fistic art by Corbett when
in New York.
They engage in the bout with a dead
earnestness that made them quite a craze
in New York for over six months.
The Namedos, Fulgora, Apollo, Horace
Benners, Sharp and Flatt, Ford and Fran
cis, Tom Mack, the Evans and Clayton,
Jenkins and Jasper, all new to Orpheum
theater-goers, complete the list.
Macdonough Theater.
Frank Mayo in "Pudd'nhead Wilson"
will appear at the Macdonough Theater to
morrow evening. He plays two perform
ances only. The remainder of tbe week,
including Sunday evening, will be occupied

ist. The coming attractions are: Peter
Dailey in "The Night Clerk," April 27
and 28; Rivarde, the violinist, April 29;
"Captain Impudence" and "Friends,"
A pri 130 and May 1, and Richard Mansfield.

give her first piano recital at the Y. M. C.
A. auditorium on Wednesday evening, j
April 29. She is said to possess exccp- I
I tional talent and already has a large rep
| ertory, including works by Beettioven,
j Chopin, Mendelssohn and other great
I masters.
Carr Testimonial.
The prospects are most fluttering for the
farewell concert to Mrs. Carmichael Carr,
which is to take place on the 30th inst., in
j Golden Gate Hall. This lady has done so
much for good music in this City that her
friends are rallying round her to snow
their appreciation of her long and un
ostentatious efforts.
Among the artists who will appear are:
Miss Sofia Newland, Willis E. Bacnellor
and a double quartet from the Loring
Club; the Ban Francisco quartet, com
prising the following Bingers, will also ap
pear: Miss Fiynn, Mrs. Carroll-Nicholson.
Willis E. Bachellor and T. Ricard : B.
Joulus will play a viola solo; there will be
l a duo by Mrs. Carr and Mr. Beel; J. Jo
sephs will join Messrs. Beel and Joulus in
Dovrak's trio.
Abases His Audiences.
Robert Mantell has followed in the foot
steps of Mr. Mansfield, and now abuses
his audiences. The fashion, no doubt, will
grow, but it will not be a popular fashion.
The Chicago Evening Post thus scores Mr.
Mantell, and so gives Mr. Mantell the free
advertising he sought. Says the Post:
The fashion, set byJÃichard Mansfield, of
abusing an audience because it happens to
be limited in numbers, has been adopted
by Robert Mantell, who assured the
people of St. Louis that he sup
posed he would "have to take his
company to Europe before it would be con
sidered good enough for the American
public to potronize." We cannot apeak
for Mr. Mantell's company, which we
have not had the artistic enjoyment of
inspecting this season, but we do not
doubt that a few years of study and prayer
in Europe or other equally desirable place
of retirement would be of material ad
vantage to Mr. Mantell. It is the great
American privilege to amuse one's
self as one sees fit and to spend
one's money as he may desire.
The sooner the Mansfields anÂ«t Mantells
discover this great fundamental truth the
sooner they will take what the gods pro
vide and be thankful.â Footlights.
Benefit Concert.
Miss Frances Wertheimer will be ten
dered a benefit concert in Golden Gate Hall
on the 28th inst. The following artists will
appear on the occasion: Bernhard Mol
lenhauer, violinist; Mrs. E. B. Blanchard,
contralto; Frank Coffin, tenor; Mrs. A.
Fried, soprano; H. Clay Wysham, Boehm
flute; accompanist*. Mrs. E. J. Batchelder
and R. Fletcher Tilton.
MISS PAY REPLIES.
An American Woman Gives the Retort
Courteous to Hugo Goerlitz.
Miss Amy Fay, the authoress of "Music
Study in" Germany," has written a
tart rejoinder to Hugo Goerlitz' stric
tures on America and the Ameri
can press. The lady, who pub
lishes her letter in the Musical Courier,
does not take so much exception to
Paderewski's manager's remark, "The
whole press of America is rotten," as she
does to the Eastern press for stating that
the women of America vied with each
other in showing adoration for the pianist.
Among other things Miss Fay says:
"Men are never so imaginative as when
they are writing about women, and when
they get on this subject the wild flights of
fancy to which they yield themselves is a
source of wonder and surprise to the femi
nine mind. A remarkable instance of the
manner in which they will allow their im
aginations to run away with their sense of
truth when speauing of women is evi
denced in the articles which have ap
peared all over this country about Pader
ewski and his so-called feminine admirers.
Now, if the truth must be told, it is the
men who make fools of themselves over
Paderewski. Theirs are the voices which
shout "Bravo!" all over the hall. They,
equally with women, press down to the
platform to see and hear him play
after the concert. In the greenroom
it is the men who crowd around
him, making a cordon which is
difficult for any woman to penetrate for a
modest handshake. Nay, the men even
take him in their arms, hug and kiss him
on both cheeks. Remarkable sight!
Rather ashamed of this emotional dem
onstration, they take it out in putting it
on to the women, something after the
style of Adam in the Garden of Eden, who,
on being taken to task for eating the ap
ple, sheepishly replied, "The woman gave
it me, and I did eat"â as if that were any
excuse.
MARY'S MEMORIES.
Miss Anderson Publishes Recollections
of Her Youth,
The long-talked-of "Memories" of Mary
Anderson was issued last week. The
book comprises 262 pages, and scattered
through it are six portraits of the actress,
the frontispiece being taken from the
large sketch for the portrait of her by G.
P. Watts.
Mary Anderson's motive in writing and
publishing her "Memories" is set forth in
her introductory remarks, in which she
says: "'1 will not plead the apology for
publishing these few recollections "that
friends â I might add strangersâ have urged
me to do so. That excuse is worn thread
bare, and it would not be true to say that
it is that which has induced me after five
happy years of married life and retirement
to write this short memoir. I have, as 1
am well aware, no literary skill and as
suredly do not wish for further publicity.
But it seems to me reasonable to believe
that my experience may be of some service
to those who have, or think they have, an
aptitude for acting."
Despite her disclaiming the possession
of literary skill the "Memories" are writ
ten in a style which would do credit to a
professional author.
The opening chapters are devoted to an
account of Mary Anderson's childhood.
She tells us that she was born in a
quaint hotel in Sacramento, Cal., on
July 28, 1859. Her mother, who was
scarcely 19 at the time, had eloped, and
was clandestinely married the previous
year to Charles H. Anderson, a young man
of English birth, who had just finished
his education at Oxford. Tue match had
met with opposition from the girl's parents
because they were strict Catholics, and
young Anderson was not religiously in
clined. The married life of the young
couple was not of long duration, as Mary
Anderson's father died at Mobile in 1862
at the age of 24.
In 1860 Mrs. Anderson went to live in
Louisville, Ky., in order to be nearer her
uncle, "Pater Anton," as he was called,
and who was pastor of a German congre
gation in New California, situated just
outside of Louisville.
Noni, as Mary Anderson called her
mother's uncle, began to teach her to play
the organ. About 1868 Mrs. Anderson
married Dr. Hamilton Griffin, and Mary,
who was then 8 years of age, spent a year
in tne Convent of the Ursulines, near
Louisville.
She relates with great gusto that she felt
like a great Heroine when she was awarded
the consolation prize, because she gig
gled in the opening chorus at
the annual exhibition. She says she
took the prize as though it had been some
well-earned laurel, only she could not
quite understand her mother's crestfallen
look at the result of her "first appearance
on any stage."

Friday afternoon next.
The liar is becoming a very noticeable
element in modern drama. vVe used to
have nim served up to us as a double-dis
tilled villain and blackguard, but now all
that is changed. The liar nourishes and
the virtuous are compelled to â¢orrow
money of him, just as it is in real life.
Anthony Hope Hawkins â though he
doesn't use the Hawkins â wrote "The
Prisoner of Zenda" and then helped dram

representative.

San Francisco, April 9, 1896.
DONALD SERIES.
FOB TINY BOYS.
Do you know that there is a place called
"Broken Toy Land ?"
I'm almost certain there is such a place.
What else could have become of the many
toys you can't rind which you received on
all the past Christmas days and birthdays,
if they have not been taken to this
"strange land?" 1
Every night, or some nights at least,
when you are fast asleep, the fairies and
sprites in charge of that place come to
nursery, garden and playroom searching
ior neglected toys and games.
They gather up great armf uls of torn pic
ture-books, headless dollies, battered sol
diers and lots of other tilings which have
not been treated with real politeness by
you, and hie away with them to the "Land
of the Broken Toys," where they dwell in
peace ever afterward.
Tommy, that's where that nice game of
yours has gone. Its parts were scattered
ell over garden and house.
Jimmy, thaf s why you can't find your
pretty red ball.
Now we know where Harry's lovely pic
ture-book is.
Hut there, we won't talk' about those
things any more to-day, for I wish to tell
you a story.
The other nizht one of the fairies, of
very high standing, from this land came
to examine the toys in Donald's play
room.
Of course the little boy knew nothing
About it, because he was a-leep.
" IT WAS A NIGHT OF UORROR INDEED."
IN CHILDHOODS
REALM
I As she was tripping across the room sh
noticed a strange expression on the face
of the little boy*s doll. "Why, she's in a
spasm ! See how her eyes are rolled back !"
Going quickly to the little oaken bed
where Miss Dollie was lying the kind fairy
raised her gently from the pillow and gave
her a little shake, which restored her eves
to their proper Dosition.
"Oh, thank you," said the doll, "I feel
better now. 1 '
The fairy wished to know what had
caused such a serious attack.
If your majesty will please be seated I
shall tell you, for it is quite a long story
and I fear you will be weary.
As you see I am a very Jovely doll and
because I have these charming dimples in
my bisque cheeks Donald calls me Dolly
Dimple.
The golden hair which adorns my head
is real, real hair, which can be combed and
arranged quite becomingly. Â«
My eyes open and close with perfect
ease and I have a pair of earrings in my
tiny pink ear*.
The sweet smile which I constantly
wear parts my ruby lips and shows four
of my pearly teeth.
During the three years that I have be
longed to Donald I have been extremely
happy until quite lately, having haa to eb
to the hospital but three times during all
this period. Once to have a new set of
arms and hands (you may have noticed
that my arms are too large for the rest of
my body) ; once to have my eyes fastened
in, and again to have my hair glued on.
These things sound perfectly terrible,
and I confess they caused me some incon
venience, but, my, I did not mind them
much, because Donald was always so kind
to me, and I felt sure that I was really
loved by him. When things did happen,
of course he "didn't mean to" or "they
were accidents," or something like that.
But, alas! not long ago he hurt my feel
ings and shocked me exceedingly, and on
on purpose, besides.
One day when his mamma returned from
town she brougnt him a new doll, just
exactly my size.
Hut it was a Chinese doll !
His black eyes were as shiny as the
eyes of the snaxe I saw in the garden one
day when I was out walking with Donald.
How awfully clean he was, too! His
sleek hair, none, eyes, ears and feet with
polished nails, as if he had just come from
one of the odd Chinese barber- shops where
tney attend to all those things.
I shivered from head to foot when I saw
him clasped lovingly in Donald's arms,
and my heart felt like a lump of lead.
To add to my sorrow, whenever the little
boy hugged him he responded with a sort
of a cry, which I should have been so de
lighted to be able to utter.
All that long, long dreary day I was left
alone â in bed, too, not even dreesedâ but,
dearie me, that was nothing to what took
place later on.
When night came and it was time for
Donald to go to bed he brought his
precious "Loo Lang," as he called him,
into the playroom. Sitting down beside
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
ray bed he took me up, and then changed
my sweet, white nightgown for "Loo
Langs" gayly colored, strong-smelling
kimono, putting mine on the Chinaman,
it wasn't any comfort to me when he told
me I looked perfectly beautiful.
Then he added insult to injury by plac
ing "Loo Lang" beside me in my own
dear little bed.
Oh, what a nieht of horror I passed !
Shall I ever forget it? Oven! There I
had to lie, as still as a mouse, frightened
half to death lor fear if I moved I might
tumble out of bed, or touch the smooth,
oily, shiny doll beside me! And it was
not only that night, but all the next day
and night, then the day following, that I
was obliged to suffer torture, for Donald
went away early in the morning: to spend
a few days in the country.
Is it any wonder, my dear fairy, that I
have those terrible spells, or that my eyes
are rolled back so far that but a little of
their heavenly blue can be seen?
"Loo Lane" has now lost all charm for
Donald. See, there he lies on the floor,
one leg hanging by a thread, and I have
my little bed all to myself again; but I
know I must look a perfect fright, for the
other day when Donald's mamma came
into the room she said, 'Oh, Dolly Dimple, I
wish you would hide your face. You make
me positively ill with that heart-rending
expression. * I must attend to having your
eyes straightened right away."
So I suppose I shall have to go to the
hospital again and submit to being ope
rated upon once more.
The morning light was breaking through
the windows, so the fairy said good-by.
Then tenderly lifting poor "Loo Lang"
from the floor she carried him away with
her, wondering as she went how "many
days would pass ere Miss Dolly Dimple,
too, would have to be taken to "Broken
Toy Land."
Playing With a Living Ball.
Down in South America there lives a
queer creature that carries its fortress
around on its back. It isn't very large or
strong and so when toe animals of the
forest attack it it rolls up into a little ball,
draws in its tail, and its hard outer fort
ress protects it. The natives have given it
PIGGY'S VISITORS.
the name of "bolita," which means "little
ball," and sometimes it is brought In
from its home in the woods for the chil
dren to roll about and play with as they
would with a football. And when they
are tired of bowling it around the bolita,
which hasn't been disturbed in the least,
calmly unrolls and crawls away.
The English name of this animal is ar-
madillo, which means "little armed," and
there are a great many different qpecfea of
it found in South America. It lives in the
earth in burrows which it. digs with its
sharp claws. During the daylight it
quietly naps, but as soon as dark comes it
crawls out and searches for its dinner,
which consists of insects, roots and fruits.
It looks very comical as it crawls about,
for its claws are so lone that it seem 9 to
walk on its very tiptoes.
The natives are fond of the bolita's flesh
and whenever they find one of the ani
mated little fortresses they carry it home
and after the cnildren are tired playing
with it they eat it up. Many centuries
ago armadillos as huge as express wagons
were common, but they are now extinct
and the bolita of to-day never grows more
than two or three feet long.â Chicago

The Story of Sally the Kicker.
lam a little dog, just one year old, and
was born in San Francisco.
When I was a very young puppy I be
came quite ill, and while in that condition
I strayed away from my first home. I was
go sick and weak I could scarcely stand
a nd should nave surely been run over had
it not been for a little girl who was pass
ing by.
I gazed at her pitifully and she was so
sorry for me that she picked me up very
gently, wrapped me in her apron and
carried me under her cape to keep me
warm, for I was shivering with cold.
Pretty soon she reached her home, and
after giving me some nice, warm milk she
put me in a comfortable little bed by the
tire, where 1 soon fell fast asleep.
In the morning; I felt much better; then
the same kind little girl took me in her
arms and sitting in a low chair soon
rocked me to sleep again.
Of course I yot strong and well under
such very kind treatment and am now an
exceedingly happy little dog.
When my mistress goes to the store she
always brings me some nice sweetcake or
candy, as I am quite fond of both.
She has taught me to sit on my haunches
with my front paws neJd up, and when
over Ido as she bids me I am rewarded
with a piece of savory cooked meat. Then
I show my gratitude by wagging my tail
and kicking.
Every morning I have a bowl of mush
and milk for my breakfast.
On Sunday afternoons when the sun is
shining bright my mistress puts a harness
on me and o bow of pretty pink ribbon, of
which I am very proud.
Then we go out for a walk, I gayly
prancing at her fide.
WJUea the passers-by admire me I look
up at my mistress and was; my tail. This
makes her smile, and if she has a piece of
candy in her pocket she gives it to me.
The first hne day i am going to the
photographer's to have my picture taken,
and as 1 can use my feet so well I am going
to be taught how to work the typewriter,
at least that is what my mistress says.
I am a little Esquimaux dog and can
outkick any other dog of my size, and that
is wny I am called "Saliy the Kicker."

Dear Editor: My papa takes The Call and I
read the children's page every Sunday and I
like it very much. I found the answer to puz
zle Ko. 3 April 12. It is "Madam." The oth
ers are so hard I can't make them out. The
next President of the United States I think
should be a married man, then his wife would
be madam; also the first lady in the hind, and
if she is bea\itiful she would be a tKuvtr. if she
is eood and kind also. A man to be President
should have good friends, my papu nays, and
be just us honest as any boy can possibly be
and help the whole country and make good
times. Of course I am a Republican. Your

Dear Editor: You want us to tell about the
diamondâ the stone for April. It is pure
carbon, and carbon is one of the most common
things in nature.
Leadpencils, charcoal, soot, lampblack, bone
black, coal, peat and coke are all forms of
carbon.
But the diamond is pure carbon crystallized.
It is the hardest of substances and will scratch j
all the other gems and cut glass. It is found
in North Carolina, Georgia, Borneo, Africa and
Brazil.
Diamonds are thought to be of vegetable
growth and to have exuded many, many years i
ago, as gum does i;ow from cherry trees, and i
then slowly crystallized. Diamonds are not
found beautiful, us we see them in the jewel
er's, but often covered with a crust, and always
have to be polished.
Diamonds are of various colors, though often
colorless. The latter are most valued, and be- j
cause they look like a drop of water arecalled I
diamonds of the first water.
Mama once read a little article, in which it |
MY kitty would not wet her fur,
Or paws, if she could choose ;
So she shall have a gossamer,
And she shall have gum shoea.
And she shall have a parasolâ
Ho, kitty'll be quite vain !
And then she wiJl not care at all
How often it may rain.
H. R. Hudson, in Wide Awake.
was said that when your shoes were highly
polished they were covered with minute dia
monds, the blacking having much carbon
which while being polished becomes crystal
ized. If this is true, then the poorest of us
may wear diamonds. Your friends,
Byra Sill and George Sill, Watsonville.

A Useful Gate.
A wealthy engineer who had set up a
very fine place in the country, where he
had carried out many pet constructive
projects, was visited there by an old
friend, says the Youth's Companion.
The vieitor had so much difficulty in
pushing open his front gate that he spoke
about it to the proprietor.
"You ought to tix that gate," said the
guest. " A man who has everything 'just
so' should not have a gate that is hard to
open."
"Ha!" exclaimed the engineer, "you
don't understand ray tconomy. That
gate communicates with the water works
of the house, and every person who comes
through it pumps up four gallons of
water."
An Absent-Minded Man.
"There was a man up in Gorham," says
a member of the South Paris George
Washington Club, "who used to keep a
pig in his barn cellar and fed him through
a spout from the floor above. One day he
remarked to his wife:
"'I have to go down and see what ails
the pig. He doesn't eat at all, lately.'
'"Why. William B. Blank!' replied his
wife, 'you killed that pig three weeks
ago.'
'"I swan!' said he; "so I did. I'd for
gotten all about it.'
"One time a man came and paid him
some money while he was milking. When
he got the milking done he went to put
the money away in a drawer. He opened
the drawer and turned the whole pailful
of milk into it." â Lewiston Journal.

Why They Like Americans.
A good many of the ignorant country
people in Spain, Bays the Boston Tran
script, are very much more courteous to
Americans than to English people, for the
carious reason that tney consider them
subject also to the crown of Spain. It has
been found in out-of-the-way villages near
Gibraltar especially, where the English
occupation of that fort is still looked upon
as a temporary and offensive intrusion on
Spanish soil, that the whole tone of the
people will change when it is found that
a tourist is not English but American.

Of a foe you entertain ;
I have seen you with him often.

That "I don't care is a thief,

That he daily tells to you,
And that mukes you say "I don't cart,"
When at heart you really do.
He at first will only cause you
To forget yourself and dare
To answer parents, friends and strangers
With the rude words, "I don't care.
But be warned ! He'll plant within you
The true spirit of his name:
Then he'll disappear like magic,
Leaving you to bear the shame.

Many a life in reckless ways.
Guard your words, your thoughts, your actions,
To yourselves be true and dare

BROWN`S

"ffiW*

I
WILLIAM BROWN, the for c j
mastmau, brought his Boj r
aboard the ship one day
while we were tying at an
chor in a little bay on the
Central American coast, he took the !
youngster up on the to'gallant forecastle j
and introduced him to the old fellows |
there. "Mates," he said, "this is ray
Boy â Brown's Boy! That's his name,
duly entered on the log as a naval appren
tice exter-oidinary. Touch yer cap to yer
father and his peers, Boy!"
Then he listened lor the comment he :
knew would come from these old wise ]
men of the sea.
"Rem-inds me of my sister's ugly brat
that looked just like its drunken father,"
said Saxie Fisher, the captain of the main
top, after a profound study of the new
arrival.
Saxie's observation, strongly discreditable
"At These Gatherings Brocky's Boy Was an Interested Listener."
to his kinfolks, passed without notice, be- â¢
cause he was known to be a bigb-coior !
story-teller, and in proof of this it was also I
Known that his sister had no brat, Had no
husband and had no existence â herself out I
of Fisher's world of imagination.
"Looks like a farmer," mused Tom
Walker, the agriculturist of the navy.
"Bee the hay-straw in his hair."
So wedded was Walker to a life on the
rolling lea that he would, when afloat on
the topsail yard reefing down in the teeth
of a screaming gale, stop to tell of his ex
perience on the ranch.
"Ha, my son," he would say, as he bent '
to paes the reef-earing around the yard- I
arm, "that's the life to lead. Damn a â 
ship! Plowing and sowing, reaping and 1
mowing â all day watches and all night in j
your hammick." And the folds of the re- j
sentful canvas, bellowing upward in the |
blast, would slap him in the face, and the
mad, mad midnight storm would carry his
words away to leeward.
"Pass your boy over to me. Brown," j
said George Romer, boatswain's mate ex
tbe port gangway, "and I'll ship him on
my chicken ranch."
Poor old Romer's chicken ranch was an
eternal mirage in the desert of his ocean
life. It always stood just before, to be
reached when his time was out and he had
said good-by to the sea forever.
But he would always come back when
bis "pay day" had fled his pocket, and from
the deck regained he heard as of okl the
siren song of tbe worm-seeking, cackling j
hen. The sea is ever calling, calling back
her own.
"Have his enlistment papers made out
before the ship's cook," advised Dave
Clark, the master-at-arms, "so be will be
sure to get his ration of salt horse." David !
Clark was the ship's lawyer, and dispensed
marine jurisprudence with an unsparing
hand. To weather a section in the "blue j
book-," or burst the restraint of a coil of:
red-tape successfully, one only had to con- i
cult "D. Clark, attorney-at-sea-law," and j
the case was won.
"I think dars 'possum blood in 'im," |
suggested "Clam" Johnson, the colored '
cooper, rolling his voluminous lips over a j
juicy recollection of some past feast, j
Clam's duties on shipboard were unhead
ini! beef barrels, building deck-buckets
and leading the choir at divine service, j
He had a mouth like the bell of a fog- i
horn and a voice like "the thunder-drum '
of heaven." But when this dusky though i
sweet minstrel of the main turned loose '
his organ-voice in a Sankey aria the tri- |
tons of toe deep ceased their sounding j
shells to listen.
"Better send him ashore," growled
Paddy White, who owned a plank in the
ship, "because there's too many boys
aboard this hooker now not worth their |
salt. All they think about fs loaf up un- I
der theio'c'ale out uv hail uv work. But !
they always an: wer their names at the '"â 
mess-table muster."
And the snappy old man of the seal
turned on liis heel to tramp his plank. |
Paddy White had been so long in tbe navy j
that his first enlistment papers were laid !
away in some deep stratum of a prehistoric j
era. Even the date of his putative titie to
"the plank" was lost in the mists of an
tiquity.
"'ls beys er like burnt 'oles in a
blanket," said "Cockney" Burn?, referring |
to the boy's dark orbs that roved wonder- j
ingly ami pitifully from one face to t.e j
other of his circle of critics. What as- j
pirates Burns had brought away from the
bank of the Thames he invariably pre- !
tixed to the wrong word. This vocal char
acteristic, comb l ned with the fact that his
face was as beautiful as that of a porpoise,
gained him the nom-de-marine of " 'An
some 'Arrtr." He afterward became the j
godfath.r of the Boy, in sympathy, they !
said, with tiie youngster's homeliness.
"He is as pretty as Brown," paid the I
ship's painter, and that petty officer being
considered pre-eminent in artistic discern
ment, his judgment was concurred in fore
and aft. This more than any other testi- j
mony established Brown in the fathership
of the Boy.
While Brown's baptismal name was
William on the;pavmas.ter's books, it was
"Brocky" on the topgallant forecastle.
Not "without rhyme nor reason" had lie
been rechristened as he came over the
gangway, for his fac*. was a parody. He
had gathered from his race not one line of
beauty and smallpox had further ruined
his facial inheritance.
Sergeant McGrath said with Celtic fit
ness and humor that the "pits in Brown's
! face would hould a wake's rain." But
those features, seamed and scarred and
rent, little indexed the big, tender and
beautiful heart of the man. Nature and
: the plague which had spoiled Brocky
' Brown for a photograph had not devas
tated the soul. That was not pitted.
As the sanhedrim of the topgallant
forecastle was discussing, the small re-
emit sat on the deck and looked at his
judges with the sad simian eyes of his
race. What a paradox a monkey is. with
all the solemnity of the animal ages in his
face and the sprightly motions of a king
dom of harlequins in its limbs. Brown's
specimen was gravity and comedy jum
bled together in confusion worse con
foundeti, and was destined to be at once
the plague and favorite of tbe ship.
After they had used up their fund of wit
and satire at the little animal's expense
Brown launched out in a history of his
protege. The yarn was so manifestly
apocryphal, so full of "holidays"â blank
spaces, where whole links were missing,
ttiat the paternity, even the maternity, of
the subject, was lost in doubt. The only
thing tnat gave Brown a sea-legal right
and title to the youngster was their com
mon comeliness, or rather their uncom
mon uncomeliness. Dave Clark handed
down a learned opinion on this showing,
supplementing other decisions along the
same lines, and Brocky was confirmed in
his guardianship.
The naked truth of the matter was that
Brown had stolen the baby monkey from
its mother's encircling arms and tail one
day in the forest while that lady was en
gaged in a fierce battle with Jack, the
ship's dog. Jack got a whipping, but
Brown got the youngster.
The Boy's education was conscientiously
carried on by the old graybeards of the
topgallant forecastle. Lnder such training
lie soon became a useful member of the
ship's company. He knew the names of
ail the gear belayed around the foremast,
Brown said, and could lead out the royal
sheets and clewlines as well as the boat
swain himself.
Like all sailors, the Boy early evinced an
ear for music and gave promise of be
coming a vocalist. On Sundays, when
the quarterdeck was rigged for church by
laying the capstan-bare on empty buckets
for seats, the Boy could hardly wait till
Brown got him into his mustering clothes,
he would station himself with the choir,
and when Clam Johnson tuned his mighty
pipe in "Pull for the Shore, Sailor,' 7 the
song-loving younsster would treble in uni
son. Nor was the Boy's church-going
practice without its fruits, for the men be
gan to follow the good example he set
them.
At least it seemed that way, because
when the boy went off with Clam all the
topgallant forecastle followed, and would
watch every movement of the small chap's
devotions. Paddy White would walk
down. his plank as far as the deck to look
on, and. George Homer from his place in'
that blue-jacket congregation found his
mind led up to a place higher than a
chicken ranch. Dave Clark quoted Mosaic
law and swore vehemently (thereby break
ing one of thoseoruinances) when anybody
questioned the righteousness of the Jewish
code. Tom Walker, the agriculturist, said
it was just heaven here below to hear
Clam warble "Bringing In the Sheaves,"
and Cockney Burns said it was eood for
the "'art" to see such piety in one so
young, referring to the Boy.
Even Saxie Fisher's mind dwelt upon
better things and his narrations took on a
purer tone. He said he Lad been ship
mates with a man whose father had not
only been wrecked with St. Paul on the
Isle of Patmos, but had looked upon the
sublime scenes of the Apocalypse with
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APTJIL 19, 1896.
that sacred personage. Here the ship's
cook observed that the story-teller was
getting the apostles somewhat mixed, but
K-ixie insisted that St. Paul might not
have been there, but his shipmate's old
man was.
Brown was untiring in his efforts to
make a thorough navy sailor out of the
Boy. Being an expert tailor he soon had
the youngster provided with a well-fille<l
clothes-bag. In the tropics the crew, at 8
o'clock in the morning, would shift from
blue flannel to white duck, and at 4 o'clock
in the afternoon back to blue again. The
Boy went through these revolutions in
raiment guided by the modiste hand of
Brocky. Sometimes he objected to these
seemingly lightning-like changes, and,
having been brought up in the Costa Rica
woods, too much civilization thrust upon
him was burdensome.
But Brocky, brought up in the old
school of the sea, permitted no relaxation
of discipline, ana a small cat-o'-nine
tails, hanging on a beiaying-pin in com
pany with a paint-swab end scrubbing
brush, always fetched the Boy np with a
round turn. Sometimes he would miss
his muster in the night watch and Brown
would find him fast asleep in his tiny
hammock.
Then the culprit would be brought to
| the foremast â not the main, which is the
j place of justice, the tribunal on board
j shipâ and put on the "black" or "extra
duty" list for punishment. He even re
! ceived a summary court-martial charged
I with stealing the sallmakers' beeswax.
| Brown, as senior officer, heroically sen
tenced his protege to be contined on
board ship all his life.
Brown and the old shellbacks would
gravely discuss the Boy's future as they
sat around between the guns during the
j dog-watches, with the subject of the con-
I ference perched on his own riiddy box
j (which had formerly held cigars), intently
i watching their faces.
"If we can get the Secretary of the Navy
to takeoff the court-martial life sentence, '
| said Brocky solemnly one day to the ex-
I ecutive officer, â¢'me and the Boy will take
the road and go cruising with a hand
organ for a change. Do you think the
I captain will forward a petition to Wash-
I ington, sir?"
He was told that there was not the least
doubt of it, as the Boy was well known to
the department.
A middy who had once "rushed" Brown
to the mast, charged with some frac
ture of the rules, once started in to "josh"
Brown regarding his pet, and have a pleas
ant quarter ot an hour with the sailor.
"Brown, you should pick out something
i easy for the Boy,'^ sain he, "some profes-
I sion that he shows the most fitness for."
"I will, sir," answered Brown, remem
berine the young officer's hostility at the
mast and chuckling inwardly at bis own
wit. "I am going to get him in the Naval
| Academy."
1 The conversation ended abruptly, but
the middy "squared yards" with the funny
man the next time that personage failtd in
some duty.
Every morning, while the decks were
being washed down, the Boy was put
through a salt water bath. He objected
until he saw dog Jack and Denis the pig
subjected to the same ordeal. Then he
submitted. Jack wouid shut his eyes
when the soap lather covered him in airy,
fairy, snowy robes and be dumb, but the
frantic expostulations of Denis could be
heard at dawn all over Central America.
The monkey never could abide the fire
of the great guns, and the concussion from
the discharge of a 9-inch piece would
knock him over like a bowled tenpin.
Then he would start for the royal truck,
the highest point he could find, to be far
away from that awful roar. Of course, the
jar of each discharge would travel up the
mast to him and he would cross the stays
to some other mast in his vain search for
peace and tranquillity. Long after the
firing was over he would perch on his airy
place and watch the guns and finally ven
ture down with a reproachful look on his
face.
One day Brown took his charge ashore
and the animal escaped into the woods.
The men came cff. to their ship without
their pet, feeling that he had deserted
them for good. That evening they heard
the Boy screeching on the beach and going
ashore they found the runaway and an
other monkey.
The stranger took to the woods on the
appearance of the men, but the deserter
readily climbed into the boat. Like his
biped shipmates he had become hungry
and came bacK, also bringing a new recruit
with him.
The animal died on the voyage north,
and Brown aaid it should have a burial
befitting a sailor, and Fisher swore that
such was the proper thing.
"A shark or a big-mouthed cod will get
him before he reaches the bottom," said.
Saxie, "but we must give the Boy a good
send off."
So the body was 6ewn up in a
piece of old royal for a shroud
and a chunk of holystone for a sinker
made fust to the feet. The little
white package wrapped for its deep tomb
was laid on the rail of the topgallant fore
castle and the ship's cook, who, next to
Brown, had nad more dealing with the de
ceased than any one, also made a speech
over the remains. It was a somewhat dis
jointed eulogy, forecastle-commendation
and culinary-metaphor much mixed, but
Dave Clark pronounced it Al at Lloyds as
a funeral sermon and Saxie Fisher said
the parson had used like words over his
"sister's brat." Then Clam Johnson in
toned "Light in the Darkness, Sailor," as
he tilted the plank and Brown's Boy went
down in the sea like a dead sailor.
Not Afraid of Bard Study.
Tom Corwin did not believe that there
was great danger of a young man injuring
his health by hard study. When his son
was attending college in Ohio Mr. Corwin
wrote to him: "I am informed that you
are seriousiy injuring your health by
study. Very few young men nowadays
are likely to be injured in this way, and if
you should kill yourself by overstudy it
will give me great pleasure to attend your
funeral."
COLLEGIANS AT THE BAT
Berkeley aad Stanford Prepare
to Wrestle on the Green
Diamond,
STRONG POINTS OF THE TEAMS.
Cardinal Ranks Pin Fa.th to McLaine's
Delivery, While Worden's Twirling
Inspires the Bine and Gold.
On Wednesday next the baseball nine of
the State University will meet the nine
from Stanford on the Berkeley diamond.
With the opening of the present season,
there has been a revival of interest in the
national game, and although far from
what it should be, the Varsity players
claim that this season's team is greatly
suDerior to those of previous years, and
that the chances of besting the Palo Alto
nine are better than ever before.
Since the latter part of February the
candidates for the various positions have
been practicing daily under Captain
Johnston and Coach Cohen, who from the
thirty-odd men have at length practically
selected the nine which will taKe the field
in the championship games. The batting
order will be as follows:
Wheeler, catcher: Worden, pitcher;
Hennessey, first base; Elston, second base;
Krug or Goodwin, third base; McLaren,
shortstop; Johnston, left fiela: Proctor,
center held; Hoag, right field.
Up to the past two weeks the nine prac
ticed in a desultory fashion, but the neces
sity of team work and fast playing beoame
so evident that they have secured Alfred
H. Cohan of the University Club of San
Francisco to act as coach.
He has the boys well in hand, and sys
tematic work has done much to strengthen
the nine.
Coach Cohen is greatly pleased with his
men's work, and believes they will win
from Stanford.
"The 'varsity has never had a first-claÂ«s
man in ttie field," said he, "and I am sure
this is the reason for the lack of interest.
In every other branch of sport California
ranks as high or higher than the colleges
of the Middle States, and it seems a pity
we should be so far behind in baseball. I
am sure though that from now on the
game will be more popular. Certainly the
nine is 100 per cent better than last
year's."
"We have some extraordinarily good
material from which toseiect. and the men
are all plnying so well that it is hard to
decide just which candidates to choose.
We are exceptionally frtrong in the points.
In fact Worden, who will pitch in the
Stanford games, and Wheeler, wiio will
be behind the bat, are the backbone of the
nine, and our success depends to a big
extent on their work."
The Varsity men were present at the
game between Stanford and the Reliance
Club at the Berkeley grounds a week ago
yesterday, and watched the work of their
rivals carefuliy. Although they acknowl
edge that Stanford is playing fast ball,
they feel that tliey are their superiors in
the field, though, perhaps, tho Stanford
team, are harder hitters.
Captain Johnston says that Berkeley
will win, but expects a hard tight. "This
is my third year on the Varsity nine," said
he, "ana I know that we are stronger this
year than before. We have iiad the ad
vantage of good coaching, and the men are
taking great interest in the work. Yes,
most of the men are new, but they are aIJ
enthusiastic and are doing their level best
to get into good shape.
The only trouble 1 anticipate in the
games with Stanford is in the batting.
It's not that our stick work is bad, biit
that McLaine, who will be in the box for
Stanford, is extraordinarily good. His
pitching is all the Stanfords'have to boast
about, and if we can hit him the rest looks
easy. Coach. Coh-.-n is giving us daily
practice in batting, and most of the boys
are hard and sure hitters. A tendency to
hit too high is the only trouble.
The nine has played a number of prac
tice-games, in which they have shown to
advantage. They were defeated by the
Reliance team two weeks ago by a score of
7 to 2, but as their regular battery was laid
up for repairs this cannot be counted
against them.
The game next Wednesday will be the
first of a series of three which will decide

the championship. The next Stanford
game will be at Palo Alto on the 27th, and
the last on the 2d of May at San Jose.
Manager Miller has arranged for addi
tional games with the University Club on
the 24th, and a return game with Reliance.
The game with the University Club will
be for the benefit of the Mercantile Library
Auxiliary, and will be played at Central
Park.

CAPTAIN JOHNSTON OF THE VARSITY NINE.

Whist
[All communications concerning whist, an
swers to problems, etc., sbouid be addressed
â¢'Whist Editor," Call, City.]
How many times has the situation oc
curred when you were the opening leader
of a deal that you would say to yourself,
"If I could only call for trumps in making
my original lead, and get a lead through
that honor" ? Milton C. Work, author of
"Whist of To-Day," was the first promi
nent expert player of this country
that had the courage of his con
victions to come out to try and popularize
the beautiful innovation first played and
introduced to the whist world by the great
English expert and authority, Major-
General A. W. Dravson, many years ago â
some time in the seventies. In "The Art
of Practical Whist," by Drayson, pub
lished in 1892, the play is exemplified, and
Mr. Work gives a conventional way of
making this play simple. Like all inno
vations, it has been frightfully abused
or misunderstood. It is about three
years ago that the writer's attention
was called to this play, on trial
in Philadelphia, and some months after
ward in the same city we took part in a
match game between Brooklyn and Phila-
delphia, 100 players on a side, where it
was publicly announced that Philadelphia
players adopted the play. It consisted in
making an "irregular opening" from your
strongest and be3t suit.
The object being two-fold, first, to an
nounce to your partner that you wanted
him to lead a trump immediately, if he
could get the lead, and the best one he
held, regardless of number; secondly, you
were taking a step toward the establish
ment of your best suit. It does not follow
that the first card led always proclaims an
irregular lead; it may not be possible to
select such a card from your suit that will
at once give such information; it may not
develop until the second round. Of course,
you must be very observant and note
the small cards, and without that ability
don't attempt the play. There is no object
in calling for trun-.ps in this way unless
you are quite sure 01 preventing the honor
turned of making a trick, in other words,
catching it; but in trying to "catch it" be
very careful that you don't lose tricks
enough to lose you "the match, if your are
playing one. This generally occurs with
novices.
For trick-winning we hold this lead
should not be made excepting from your
best suit. You can readily pee if you do
not adopt a uniform system of playing it
you muddle your partnerâ set him to
euessing. and whoever was known to guess
right in a whist play? It has become a
fashion with many young players who
have heard of this irregular opening, but
won't read a whist book, to make it from a
*<hort suit of one, two, or three cards, and
if they succeed in catching the honor, no
matter how many trick 9 they lose in so
doing, they are as tickled as a boy with
his first pair of pants.
Everything that comes from the pen of
Milton C. Work is worth giving to the
whist world. In a recent Tetter he says
commenting on the above play: "To-day
in this country, however, this lead is con
ventional, in spite of the fact that there
are still some conservative players who be
lieve that it is better when you want
trumps out to lead right up to an honor,
over which you have a tenace, rather
than risK an irregular card which your
partner may either fail to recognize as
such or may be unable to win even if he
does distinguish the irregularity.-'
This sometimes results in the leader's
being lorced and then being compelled,
after all, to lead up to the honor with a
weakened trump suit. Of course, this sel
dom happens, and the best players of to
day heartily indorse the play "underdis
cussion; but no matter how enthusiastic
the player may be in its favor he must ad
mit that there are times when the play is
not as effective as it might be, because the
partner fails at first glance to positively
recognizo the card led as an irregular one.
We suggest to our readers a possible im
provement in this particular. Our idea is
that when an honor is turned the lead of
a queen or jack should be a command to
lead trumps through the honor. This can
oe easily accomplished by varying fie fol
lowing lead when it is not the desire of
the leader that his partner should lead
trump.
Instead of queen, from combinations of
five cards with king, lead the king, tem
porarily not showing the number; lead
kxng also from king, queen, jack and more
than one other.
Under this system the lead of queen or
jack from any combination is a call ipso
facto, and the old rule applies to any other
irregular lead. The only possible objec
tion is that the partnercannot when an
honor is turned get much information from
a kins: lead, as it may be from a variety of
combinations, and does not show number.
On the other hand, it seems probable that
flic imperative trump information more
than offsets this. The idea has notyet been
put in practice, and therefore no practical
statistics on the subject are available.
We offer the suggestion to our readers
with the thought t*jat it is well worthy of
careful consideration.
ANSWERS TO QUERIEB.
When the leader has two four-card plain
suits exactly alike, in playing .duplicate
whist, there should be a new deal â which
suit to lead from is guessing pure and
simple, and the deal should be thrown out
and a new deal ordered.
The hrst illustrated hand at whist was
published in Cavendish, fifth edition,
1862, and is the hand that is e:i graved on

This problem that we give to-day is a

deal played in St. Paul a few days ago.
It comes from the pen of George ij
Bunn, director of the American Whist

nized as one of the greatest in this coun
try. He says East "can practically ab

LIGHT HOUSE
p^np^HE lighthouse farthest removed
I from tlic Pacific of any in the
I Department of California is the
)\ one on Roe Island, in Suisun Bay,
about seven miles above Benicia.
It is of little use to any but river craft, and
there is no need of its being seen, at any
great distance, but it is as powerful a light
as the one on Goat Island, and the light
house proper is almost a duplicate of the
one at the mouth of Oakland harbor.
Roe Island is little more than a piece of
marsh land a few inches above high tide
and overgrown with tule. The lighthouse
is on that portion of it which might be
called the southwest corner, and can be
Eeen by incoming vessels as soon' as they
leave the Carquinez Straits.
The lighthouse is built amid a growth of
tules, on piles driven in the mud. The
platform is about fifteen feet above high
tide, and on this a house of two rooms is
built, and also a sort of closet for the fog
BignaJ. The light-tower is in the center of
the building, and the lantern is nearly
thirty-five feet above the water. A porch
is built entirely around the building, and,
all things considered, the place is roomy
and comfortable and kept in the best con
dition.
The present lighthouse on Roe Island
was established in 1891. It is of the fifth |
order. The lenses were new at the iime it j
was put up and of the latest pattern, made
by Sautter & Co. of Paris, France. They |
cover the whole horizon. The lamp is of |
the usual pattern, made of brass, and con- j
suming mineral oil. It is made to burn !
twelve hours, but is always changed at j
midnight, â¦xcept, perhaps, on some of the
short nights in summer. â¢ â -.-. â  .
Roe Island is also equipped with a fog- j

bell. There is not much use for it in sum
mer, but in winter it wiil often be kept
tolling for days at a time on account of
the strange land fogs that are frequent in
the locality and are said to be caused, to a
large extent, by burning tule. The fog
bell is tolled by a machine that is operated
by a weight, and will run several hours
with one winding.
The lighthouse on Roe Island is at pres
ent in sole charge of A. Nilsen, and a most
lonesome life he leads. He cannot leave
except in a boat and has very few visitors
on account of the difficulty in reaching
the place. He cannot even see any signs
of life from the lighthouse, except the
few parsing steamers, as all settlements
are far away and partly hidden by hills
and the vegetable growth of the marshes.
Two or three times a month he goes to
Martinez for mail and provisions, but even
then he has to oe careful to seiect a fine
day. as a fog might come up at any moment
and prevent his getting back.
The mouths of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers are lighted by several small
stake lights. They are nothing but poles
stuck in the mud and equipped with
tackle so that a lantern can be hauled to
the top. . A few of these are attended to
by hunters who have their camps near by,
but the most important ones are in charge
of men who live at Pittaburg Landing and
Black Diamond.

Captain John Ross, Keeper of Angel
Island Fog Signal.
[From a sketch.]
Island has alwayj been so small the Gov
ernment never thought it worth while to
erect a lighthouse there, but at the same
time some warning was necessary to navi
gators on dark and foggy nights, and in
1886 a fog-signal was erected that has since
proved to be ail that is necessary.
To be of value it was, of course, neces
sary to keep a man there a'l the time, and
this necessitated the "building of a resi
dence and a bouse for the bell machine.
These are placed on a peninsula that is al
most an island, about 200 yards south of
the steamer landing at the military post.
They are In a most picturesque position,
but somewhat difficult to eet at. From
the neacti a winding path leads along the
sides of the cliffs, gradually climbing
higher and higher until several hundred
feet above the tide level. At many points
a single misstep would mean a fall to tbe
beach below that would result in certain
death.
At the top of the hill the path is a few |
feet bacfc from tlie edge of the cliff, and
then makes a sudden turn westward and
downward through a thick growth of
pcrub oat. About forty feet down the
Eides a stairway commences that ieads
over bowlders and along the edge of the
cliff tor several yards. The last part of it
is really a bridge that crosses the chasm
between the peninsula and the mainland.
It is at least seventy-five feet above the
bottom, and likely to cause a nervous
feeling to people crossing it for the first
time.
The residence is a pretty and comfort
able house, but the surroundings are as
barren as the desert. All of the available
space has been used so that there is not a
square foot of soil on which to grow plants
of any kind. The interior of the residence
contains three rooms conveniently ar
ranged and comfortably furnished.
The bell machine is located at the back
of the residence, or the side toward the
bay. It is in a substantial building, so ar
ranged that the machine will be inside
and the clapper swing outward and strike
the bell. The machine is of the latest pat
tern, and, as there is plenty of room for
the weights to drop, will run four hours
with one winding.
Captain Ross is in charge of the Angel
Island fog signal. He is the only man
who has held the position, as he went in
as soon as it was finished in 1886 aud has
remained there ever since. His duties are
not arduous, as he has only to keep the
bell machine wound up and start it as
soon as a fog comes in. He does not even
have to keep on the lookont for fogs, as he
can always hear thÂ«* Lime Point signal as
soon as it blows, and have plenty of time
to start his own before the fog reaches the
place. Although it is not required, Cap
tain Ross always keeps a lantern burning
in the signal-house on dark and foggy
nights.
Captain Ross is over (30 years of age, and
has spent the greater part of his life in the
lighthouse service. Thirty-four years ago
he was first mate of the lighthouse tender
Shubrick and held tne position for many
years. He has also been keeper at the
San Simeon lighthouse, but the work
there became too hard for his advancing
years, ana he was transferred to his pres
ent position.
After the Armada.
The defeat of the Armada inspired Eng
land with energy and hope. Our people
i became busy traders. Flemish trader Ã
had been ruined by war, Flemish refugee 9
. had flocked into England, and Antwerp,
the great port for New World commerce,
had been sacfeed and taken. England suc
ceeded to the trade of which the Dutch
| had been deprived. Beyond the ocean lay
a vast world of wealth, of which Spain,
united with Portugal, claimed the monop
oly, thereby excluding English commerce
from the larger half of the planet. Sys
tematic violence â that is, the combination
of trade with private warâ was the only
mode in which this monopoly could be
attacked.
Elizabeth connived at this covert mari
time war both before and after the Armada,
and the struggles between English traders
and Spanish monopolists were far too nu
merous and important to admit of peace
between the two Governments. It was this
spirit of commercial adventure, whether
it be called piracy or a heroic attempt to
rescue the New World from the inquisition
and give it back to the free use of the
human race, which was the first step in
the development of three colossal growths-
British trade, British empire, the British
navy.â Blackwood's Magazine.
| ALBINO BIBDS AND BEASTS.
White Deer and Quail Found Along a
Dakota Rtver.
W. L. Bruce of Yankton, S. D., reports
that while hunting twenty-five miles
nortnwest of Yankton, along the James
River, he shot two albino quail from a
flock normally colored. They were larger
than the ordinary bird, of a cream color,
speckled with brown, but so dimly as to
appear pure white at a short distance.
Some years ago an old quail with thirteen
young, all albinos, were reported from
j California by a correspondent of the same
j paper. Many individual albino quail are
reported and a few albino ruffed grouse.
The London Field lately noted the finding
of albino and pied rooks, crows and black
birds, and a white house martin. It also
told about a white badger that was taken
j in a weasel trap a short time ago.
A pure white deer and a mottled one
: were reported killed on Whidby Island, in
; Puget Sound, lately. Three or more white
I wild turkeys are known to have been
killed during the past fifteen yearr. One
! bird in Tennessee was known as the "Old
i White Witch Turkey." He may not have
; been a bright bird naturally, but it wasn't
very long after he was hatched that he
learned that being white was not all com
fort. The hen turkeys liked him exceed
ingly, and one of his offspring, a gray
bird, was killed in 1882, while others of
light color were seen. Hundreds of bullets
were fired at the witch bird, but without
success, and he probably died a natural
death in some out-of-the-way clump of
bushes.
For many years albinos were thought to
be barren, but observation has proved this
to be erroneous. One, a female robin,
reared a brood of young for five successive
seasons up the Hudson, and a number of
other robins were seen attending young in
the vicinity during two or three mating
seasons, the young being often oddly col
ored. Albino robins ana squirrels are
most frequently seen of the small crea
tures, while deer are the most numerous
of larger albinos. An albino moose was
never seen.â -P'oiest and Stream.
A Dentist's Parrot.
A parrot owned by Dr. C. M. Gill, which
bad an interesting history, died yesterday.
It was about 50 years old and was pur
chased by the doctor's father.
Dr. GUI is a dentist, and he says that
often when he had a patient in the chair
Polly would laugh and call out "Kick up
old Harry!" If the person happened to
cry out with pain Polly would do likewise.
Many patientÃ dia not like this, supposing
it was some person that was mocking
them, and when told it was a parrot they
would hardly believe it.
The most annoyance caused by the par
rot. Dr. Gill says, was to the congregation
of Sharp-street colored Methodist Episco
pal Church, which adjoins his house. On
a bright Sunday morning Poll would be
hung out on the side of the house, and if
it happened that a preacher with a sten
torian voice was in the pulpit, as soon as
THE SAN FR A3 CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, 1896.
he would begin to preach Polly would
shout and yell at him. If an orator of
milder delivery was holding forth Poll
would continually interrupt him by
shouting "Amen."
Poll was not a large parrot, and a per
son would think he was only 6 or 7 years
old instead of 50. He was of a bright
green color, with a red topknot. Dr. Gill
says that old age and a tumor which
formed on the end of his bill and caused it
to decay were the causes of his death. â

FAIE FLEMISH WOMEN.
They Are Very Tall and Models of Great
Beauty.
A recent traveler in old Flanders says
that the Flemish women are tall and that
they possess great beauty. Their eyes are
usually blue, their hair is like burnished
gold, which they wear long like the Ger
man gods, according to an account in the
Philadelphia Times.
The Flemish woman is simple to excess ;
not because she has poor taste in her toilet ;
on the contrary, a Flemish woman never
goes out on a Sunday without a heavy silk
dress, with soft frou-frou marking her
steps.
The Flemish woman has preserved in
tact the admirable naivete of the woman
of the middle ages. She is an ideal
mother of a family; she has no ambition,
no love for art, for music or for poetry ; not
a whisper of rebellion against the domina
tion â often brutality â of her husband, who
in her eyes represents power, and for
whom she cherishes an admiration that
cannot be shaken.
Bruges is the only city in Flanders
which in our days has preserved its origin
ality, and where at every step in its de
serted streets one feels the soul of this
marvelous Fianders of the middle ages.
Bruges can be proud also of having the
most beautiful women.
Whenxme takes a walk at twilight in
those narrow streets, darkened by heavy
facades of the thirteenth century, which
advance and seem to bend over, out from
the low doors of the houses walk timidly
Junoesque women draped in a large
mantle. Upon their heads they wear
broad-brimmed hats with little plaits,
which permit one to see only the brusque
line of the nose and the thickness of proud
lips.
The Flemish woman is profoundly re
ligious. For her God is not a tyrant, who,
in order that he may forgive, wishes to be
flattered, and to see one humiliated before
him. Her God is sweet. She thinks that
one must love him with human love, as
one loves a gentle child, aud that one must
put tender words into prayer.
When one sees them kneeling in the
shadows of old churches they give an im
pression of many beautiful statues, grouped
there by the hands of a marvelous artist.
Ala 9! the true Flemish woman will soon
disappear.
"Civilization" will end by penetrating
and soiling this little corner of Belgium,
which until now remains rebellious to all
Latinization. Civilization is like a bad
architect â the last one puts a modern win
dow in Gothic facade, and the first one
grafts a German upon a Latin ; so we will
end by forming a unique race, a race with
out a name, without origin and without
endâ the race of cosmopolitans.
BERNA'S BIG PREDECESSOR
An Interesting Letter Frcm Hed
ley Chapman, the English
Dog Breeder.
The San Francisco St. Bernard Taller
by an Inch and a Half Than
Princes.s F.orence.
Dog fanciers the world over have been
greatly interested in the recent description
of Berna, the great St. Bernard nog owned
by E. P. Schell of this City, which ap
peared in The Call recently. Hedley
Chapman of Victoria, B. C, the well-
Known English breeder, has addressed to
The Call an interesting letter concerning
Berna and .Princess Florence. In this
communication Mr. Chapman gives some
data concerning the latter dog which is
not only of interest to lovers of the noblo
St. Bernard, but also of news value to the
fanciers. Mr. Chapman writes:
If the height of Berna is takeu at the shoul
der and measures 33 inches, as stated, he is
certainly a wonder, and will make English
breeders look to their laurelsâ provided, of
course, she has bone and substance aud her
other points are symmetrical.
As a comparison is made between Berna and
Princess Florence, my interest is easily ac
counted for when I state I was the rearer o"f the
latter "champion."
It may interest the public to have her meas
urements taken when a year old. us these
measurements I have reason to believe have
never been published on this side of the At
lantic. They were:
From nose to stop, 4'^ in. ; stop to occiput, 7
in.; occiput to set-on of tail, 43 in.; length of
tail, 24 in. ; girth of skull, 27^' in.; below eye,
17^ in.; of chest, 39 in.; ol loin, 32 in. ; of
elbow, 13 in.; of the ball, 9 in.; height at
shoulder, 31^ in.; weight, 189 pounds. Her
immense bone needs no comment from me.

graphs of Princess Florence, the Duke of
Maplecroftâ one of her famous offspring â

grandsire and grandam of Princess Flor

California Dog Owned by E. P. Schell.
their owner would set a man up in busi
ness as a money-lender.
To appreciate the value of Berna, of
whom Mr. Schell is the lucky owner, it
need only be remembered that, though
she is only 8^ months old, she is 30 inches
in height, ia entirely symmeirical, that
her bones and skull are larger than
Princess Florences, and that though far
from the goal as regards development, she
already weighs 165 pounds.
When Mr. Scheft gets ready to place
Berna on exhibition as a contestant it is
pretty certain that he will not go home
empty-handed.
Living" Pictures Criticized by an As

astronomer, went to see the living pictures

woman set on a moon, like that? It's
contrary to every theory of 'stronomy
in the ; world, including my own, and
besides, the moon 13 :in tne west at this
time of night, too. It's a swindle, I say, a
swindle." ' And Uncle Joe wandered home
to commune with the , north } star or the

OUT OF HAPPY CAMP
Captain Doolittle's Story of a
Unique Place in the
Siskiyous.
IT HAS ONLY 600 PEOPLE.
But It Produces Lots of GoldâFreight
ing on a Mule's Hurricane Deck
Over a Trail.
Gold is coming out of the mines of
Northern California and reaching San
Francisco at a rapid rate. The gold comes
here in dust and nuggets, and i 3 at once
transferred to the United States Mint and
made into coin. There is a regular stream
of gold from the various little and big
mining centers.
The miners bring in their bags of gold
in the rough and take away the shining
new $20, $10 and $5 pieces. One of the
latest arrivals is Captain Albert Doolittle
of Happy Camp, a remote place in Siski
you County. He is at the Russ, and a
day or two ago brought down about $5000
worth of crude gold.
"It's all made into money now," he said
yesterday. "The gold was from the mine
of A. H. Ock at Happy Camp and not
from my own. Mr. Ock has one of the
richest mines there. It is now bonded to
James Camp.
"There is a good depl of gold coming out
of Happy Camp, the queer little place in
the mountains, where I have lived since
1858. I had been at sea for thirty years
before that, and came around the Horn
first in 1839. But I settled down there
and have remained ever since.
"Happy Camp is on the Klamath River
Captain Albert Doolittle, Who Brought Out the Gold from Happy Camp.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
in Siskiyou County, seventy miles south
west of Yreka. To get there you have to
go through Fort Jones, Scotts Bar and
other old-time diggings.
"It is only in the last three years that
we have had a wagon road. Before that
we had to go by trail over the SiÂ«kiyqu
Mountains. All our supplies came in via
Crescent City and Waldo, Oregon. It was
nothing but a mountain trail we had, and
we made our passage on the Hurricane
deck of a mule. Pack animals had to
carry all our goods.
"The camp now has 600 people, in fact it
is something more than that now, as many
new companies have started up. Some
aie working mines and others are digginsc
ditches, preparatory to opening mines. A
new mill, costing $20,000, has been built.
Seattle capitalists are opening a property,
and the property owned by Mr. Hughes is
employing a good many men.
"All this is in addition to the usual
work carried on there. Several mines
have changed hands during the past year.
The county looks well and everybody is
encouraged. It is estimated that we can
work our mines for half what it cost us
fifteen years ago. If we can do that I
think we ought to get along, for we did
very well before."
Captain Doolittle. who gained his title
at sea, is the owner of the Consolidated
Doolittle mine on Clear Creek, ten miles
below Happy Camp. They are hydraulic
properties. "The captain, before coming
to California in 1858. had been for some
years in Australia. He is not an Austial
ian by birth, but is a native of New
Hampshire. He will be here for probably
two weeks. He says most of the supplies
for Happy Camp, since the completion of
the wagon road, reaches there by way of
Yreka.
WAR AND 00MMEE0E.
VaÂ«t Amount of Property Destroyed by
the Â£neniy.
War with France opened in 1793, and
was protracted, with the exception of the
short break due to the peace of Amiens,
for twenty-two years. We started with
16,073 ships of 1,540,000 tons, manned by
118,000 men, and with a navy of 141 ships
of the line, 155 frigates and 129 small ves
sels. We had to deal with a thoroughly
inefficient enemy, disorganized by revo
lution and distracted by intestine quarrels.
From the first hour of war our military
superiority was unchallenged. The declara
tion of war, however, caused a very
serious contraction of trade. There
were many failures, and a temporary loan
of Â£5.000,000 was necessary to avert panic.
This measure had a most salutary effect,
and only Â£3,855,000 was applied for. Early
in the struggle the attack upon our com
merce besan. Ships of war and privateers
of all sorts fell upon it. Rowboats put off
to merchantmen lying becalmed in the
channel or under the Forelands, and car
ried them by boarding. Surcouf in tne
East Indies swept into his net not only
helpless sailing ships, but also large and
heavily armed lndiamen. In 1805 the
Rochefort squadron got to sea and took in
five months four warships and forty-two
merchantmen. "In 1810, says the Naval
Chronicle, quoted by Captain Mahan, "sig
nals were out almost every day at Dover,
on account of the enemy's privateers ap
pearing in sight." In I*Boo, the same au
thority tells us, there were eighty-seven
large French privateers in the Channel
ports of France alone. From first to last
the French captured 11.000 ships, with
their cargoes, worth Â£200,000,000, a toll of
2]4 per cent at the very least on our trade.
At first sight this loss does not look par
ticularly heavy, and it certainly had on
effect upon the issue of tne war. It was
only so much property destroyed that
might, if spar -d, haveadded to our wealth.
We annihilated French trade so that Na
poleon conld not even send a cockle boat
to sea, as foe himself confessed, nnd we
captured no less than 1031 privateers, car
rying 9400 guns, manned by 69,000 men.
Thus we lost an average of 550 ships a year
and took less than 55 a year of the depre
dators. Neutrals, it will be observed, lost
by peace and gained by war. From 1790
to 1793 the average clearance of neutral
shipping was under 200,000 tons.âNine
teenth Century.

Cost of the Cuban War.
The autonomist newspaper, La Union,
publisned at Guines, in the province of
Havana, prints the following estimate of
what the war in Cuba ha* cost in a single
year:
War expenses $60,000,000
Losses from tlip destruction of the
sugar-cane crop 50,000,000
Lost by the proprietors of 40.000
dorses taken "iiher by the patriots
or the Spanish troops 600,000
Cattle tÂ»ken by th.Â« patriots 500,000
Small towns destroyed 3,000,01)0
Dost r.icv ion of railroads 3,000,000
Stores sacked 2,000,000
Destruction of country estates and
farms 5.000,000
Losses of capitalists in commercial
importing business 10.000,000
Total f 184,000,000
Five years of peace, adds La Union,
would be necessary to make good the
losses of one year.
Why England la Great.
How was it that half an island over
which Queen Elizabeth ruled developed
into the world-wide empire over which
Queen Victoria reigns. First and fore
formost it must be referred to the quali
ties of the race, their energy and adven
turous spirit, their capacity to colonize, to
rule subject races, and to administer their
affairs. That race was sprung of succes
sive seafaring invaders of these islands
â¢who were trained for generations in the
arduous defense of these shores, and taught
to achieve naval superiority as a nt cessity
of their position.
As early as Edward 111 the sovereignty
of the narrow seas was asserted and con
ceded as a matter of course by the people
of the Low Countries. As centuries rolled
on the insularity of our position became
more marked as our possessions in Europe
dwindled away. The drill sergeant, who
is the artificer of German fortunes, has
had no ascendency in these islands, whose
preoccupations have not arisen from mili
tary empires on their boundaries. Naval
superiority has been the guarantee of our
shores, and, at the same time, the founda
tion of an empire which has grown up
beyond the seas. The same qualities
which achieved ordered liberty at home
spread commerce, settlements and empire
abroad. â Blackwood's Magazine.
SOUTH APEIOAN SOCIETY.
Women Vulgar and Illiterate Plagtered
With Diamonds.
"Society" as represented in Jobannes
bnrg is of a decidedly novel description.
Without doubt there are highly educated
and altogether charming people amone
the residents, both men and women, bnt
they belong, with few exceptions, to tne
professional classes â clergymen, physi
cians and lawyers, who have left their
native lands and come here, attracted by
the prospect of a larger scope for the ex
ercise of their various callings. The elite,
the mine-owners and original possessors of
land â all millionaires many times over â
taking them collectively, hardly display
those qualities which "stamp the rank of
Vere de Vere."
The women are vulgar and illiterate,
with dyed hair and artificial complexions;
they wear outrageously loud toilets and
are plastered with diamonds at all hours.
Moss of them are former members of
theatrical touring companies, barmaids or
shopgirls, and they are to be seen all day
long driving about the streets in their
gorgeous carriages. The men are prin
cipally of the pronounced Hebrew type,
loud in manners and dress, ostentatiously
drinking champagne at Â£1 the bottle at
all hours of the day and causing the be
nolder to reflect upon the quotation from
the "Lady Slavey": "Can I not do as I
like? Am I not a millionaire?" The ballÂ«
given by the elite are of the most sumptu
ous description. Flowers for decoration
are procured from all parts of Cape Colony
and many hundreds are spent over one
evening's entertainment.
The suppers comprise every "delicacy
that could be had in England â came, fish,
etc., being sent out in the cool-air cham
bers of the mail steamers for the purpose.
The cost of a fancy ball recently given
amounted to over Â£3000; a plush curtain,
specially made, and used for one evening ;
to hide an unsightly archway, costing
Â£150. It is impossible, unless possessed
of considerable means, to live with com
fort in a private house in Johannesburg;
rents are in proportion to ail other prices '
askedâ enormous. It is difficult for white t
workingmen engaged in the mines to ob- |
tain a single room in a tiny shanty under i
a rental of Â£4 a month at the very least, j
while a small villa of fivÂ« rooms, built of I
corrugated iron, will easily let at Â£12 to

HOW TO BEAOH THE POLE.
Views of Admiral Markhatn, KN., on
the Subject.
In order to ensure success in Arctic ex
ploration it is essential that there should,
if possible, be a continuity of coastline.
The total absence ot known land in the
neighborhood of Bering Strait renders ex
ploration in that quarter undesirable
until, at any rate, other directions have
been attempted. It was the sudden ter
mination of land ou either side of Smith
Soundâ that is to say, land trending in a
northerly directionâ mat prevented Nares
from attaining an even higher latitude
than that reached t by his traveling par
ties.
Had Sir Edward Parry been aledging
along a coast line instead of forcing his
way through a moving and broken-up
pack he would assuredly have reached a
position nearer to the pole than the one he
gained. The great desideratum, therefore,
in selecting the route for polar exploration
is the presence of land trending to the
northward. 8o long as this can be found
so sure is it that its northern termination,
however far it may be situated, will be
reached. This particular condition, so far
as we know to tne contrary, is to be found
in Franz Josef Land, for Lieutenant Payer
has stated that he saw high land to the
north of the position which he reached
and which be estimated to have been situ
ated in latitude 63 deg., and thus from the
configuration of the land thus seen, taken
in connection with the coast along which
he was traveling, it is more than probable
that Franz Joseph Land extends a consid
erable distance beyond the furthest land
that has yet been discovered. Taking all
things into consideration, it seems to me
more than likely that when the north-pole
problem is solved â and solved it assuredly
will be â tbe solution of it will be found in
the direction of Franz Josef Land. â North

Early California Literature.
BY FRANCES FULLER VICTOR.
FOLLOWING the publication of
the alleged discovery of the source
of Bret Harte's most successful
inspirations were several very
iigreeable episodes. The very next
d:ty in a literary assembly a lady ap
proached me with the information that
she was "Ridinghood," and thereupon I
proceeded to congratulate myself and
question her. "Was I correct in my in
ferences in relation to Shirley's letters?" I
aÂ«ked.
"Quito so," she returned: "I have al
ways known it. But concerning the'Out
croppings' and its compilation I could tell
you much more than yon learned from
Mrs. Clappe. Come to see me someday
and I will do so." The lady's name is
Mary Viola Tingley Lawrence and 1 lost
uotime in prosecuting the acquaintance.
Miss Tingley was the daughter of a dis
tinguished member of the California bar
in "the fifties." Her childhood was spent
in hotels and in contact with the stimu
lating life of the Minerva-like young State.
Whether it was sliding down sandhills in
company with Lily Hitchcock or exchang
ing bonmots with the gentlemen who so
greatly predominated in San Francisco so
ciety in those times she was ever receptive
or reflective, using her bright intellect to
cull out and to rix the best impressions
from what was going on around her.
Very fortunately, as she felt it to be, she
became a pupil of Mrs. Clarpe's.wbo, hav
ing been nurtured and educated in the
mrs. maky Viola Lawrence.
[Drawn from an old daguerreotype]
atmosphere of one of the great Eastern
universities, \\a* competent to direct an
aspirin* younsr mind, and who was her
selt still, young enough to be a congenial
companion to her pupils. She had besides,
as any reader her letters will readily
perceive, a loving and generous disposi
tion, and as any one who knew her will
remember a personality that was fascinat
ing, even regal, in spite of a rather too
slender frame. Thus the pupil and teacher \
werecomplementary to each other.
â¢ By the time that Miss Tingley was
graduated from the high school she had
made hcquaintance witii and secured the
friendship of such men as Rev. Fred C.
Ewer, whom Ehe describes as a "beautiful
man," grand of stature,- handsome of
ieature. cultivated, and helpful; and
of Starr King, whose only handsome fea
ture' was his eye, which in eloquence was
only equaled by his tongue.
Miss Tinsley's "excellence" in literary
exercises at school, with the commenda
tions of her friends, lea to further aspira
tions in the line of authorship. But with
a forethought unusual in one of her age,
she conceived the idea of collecting for
preservation the fragmentary literature of
California down to her time, or about the
beginning of the War of the Rebellion.
Many fripnds gave discouraging counsel,
but : her most trusted advisers, Mr. Ewer
and Mr. King, said, "Go ahead; the idea
is a good one, and at any rate it will be an
education in many ways." t â¦â¢'â¢.'
On this eiK-ouragement she commenced
her work, sending letters all over the
State, asking, wiiters of prose and poetry
to furnish her with a copy of what in their
judgment was their best contribution to
California publications. "The answers re
ceived from those parties," says Mrs. Law- i
rence, "had they been preserved, would ;
now be most interesting reading." The i
result of the correspondence was a great
mass of material, out of which was finally
selected the matter for a book of both
prose and verse, which would have epi- ;
tomized the pioneer writings of California, j
And what writings they were, to be sure!
To speak contemptuously of them be
cause they were pioneer productions is i
simply to write one's self down as a sense- '
less sneerer. It is in times of stirring ex- j
periences such as the early immigrants to
the Pacific Coast encountered that the in- 'â 
teliectual and emotional part of us flashes
up, and the Johns and Jeanettes who may j
now rbe quietly attending to the hum
dram duties of ordinary living, out of
their aroused consciousness utter those
expressions which have ever made "the
whole world kin." Thus the first literary
productions of any people are a part, and
a very interesting part, of their history;'
and Tingley's book,- if published as!
compiled by herself, revised by Mrs. Clappe i
and approved by Starr King and Rev. !
Fred C. Ewer,.would have been such a part I
of the intellectual history of California.
When completed it was placed in the !
hands of A. Roman,-who was to secure its
publication in the East. The war, how
ever, had caused so great ; a decline in the
book publishing business that no Eastern I
house was found who would 1 , undertake to '<
bring it out; and Miss Tingley, hoping for '
some change to more favorable conditions j
and feeling too shy on account of her seven
teen years to annoy Mr. Roman with re
peated inquiries* left the manuscript with j
him awaiting developments.
In the meantime Bret Harte had come I
into notoriety and favor through his style,
which was amixture of caricature, humor, j
delicate touches of sentiment and misrep- I
resentations of .the people who were "sup-, !
posed to give character to the State,
namely, the, mining population. It was
the unusualness of his pictures of Call- J
fornia life, the very audacity, with which j
he painted the miner? to themselves, that !
amused them. They were men who were ;
capable of ; appreciating, the humor I and
the bits of sentiment . as well. To people !
abroad the stones had a different meaning ; j
hence, to-day he is very .generally reviled i
for having been unfaithful to his own j
people and the facts. The literary men |
of San Franciscoâ such generous . souls . as
were to .be found ;in the'otfices- of the
Golden Era and the Evening Bulletin,
Wifab. Rir^an, St<r- King, and : manj buai.'

[ ness houses â cheerfully gave both appro-
I bation and money to encourage the rising
j genius. Mrs. Fremont also lent her aid to
i secure him a position in the Sub-treasury,
I in order to lift him into a free atmosphere
! where he might work to advantage.
The great popularity of Mr. Harte sug
! gested to Mr. Roman that it might be a
j good thing to connect his name In some
i way with the unpublished book on his
I hands, and he therefore invited him to
look it over. Tim he did, with the result
that the prose part was thrown out, and
j many of the poems. Neither Miss Ting
| ley nor Mrs. Clappe appeared in its pages,
I although in the preface an acknowledg-
I ment is made that the editor had been as
sisted by Miss Tingley. Of several titles
which she had proposed to Air. Roman,
"Outcroppings" was selected as most suit
able. All the material collected by her
with so much effort, excepting that which
appears in the tliin volume which Mr.
I Harte, in his usual felicitous style, men
; tions as his "first book," was cast aside
I and never recovered, nor can the same
j matter ever be duplicated. The same con
i tempt was shown for the illustrations pre
i pared for it. In this transaction, from
first to last, the person to whom the col
! lection belonged was not consulted, nor
i even informed of the facts. Such i 3 the
j history of "Outcroppings" as learned from
Mrs. Tingley-Lawrence, in answer to my
questioning.
Like Harte himself, Miss Tingley made
her debut into California newspaperdom
in the columns of the Golden Era, but she
found her true place in journalism in 1868,
when she became a regular correspondent
of the Sacramento Union, then a leading
newspaper not only on the Pacific Coast,
but in the United States, her contributions
being spoken of as indicating her to be
"the rising young writer of the West" by
such men as Horace Greeley, Samuel
Bowles and George W. Curtis. * They pos
sessed that charm of spontaneity, fresh
ness and naturalness which captivates
alike the Judge upon his bench and the
miner in his cabin. The commonest
themes became invested with a fascinat
ing interest when touched by her pen.
Her optimism insDired courage and Lope
as it revealed latent possibilities to her
readers. Some of her letters were copied
entire by the Eastern press, and in many
a camp and town of California the arrival
of the mail brineing the Weekly Union
was the signal for a gathering about the
postottice to hear read the Ridinghood
letter.
It has been declared that no California
writer has given so much pleasure or in
spired such high ambition. During the
three years when her correspondence was
running in the Union Miss Tingley re
ceived not less than a thousand letters
from all classes of n:en and a number of
offers of marriage. Expensive holiday
gifts from unknown admirers, cold and
silver bricksand substantial checks poured
into her lap, with thanks for the good she
had done in brightening and strengthen
ing the lives of her unknown correspond
ents. What a very different notion this
gives of the mining population from that
imparted by Bret Harte's tales! And
that it is sustained by facts 1 know of my
own experience. Among them a few
years earlier when as "Florence Fane"
they welcomed me to the mountains with
a present of stock from every mine
owner in the district. Ah, those were
the happy days of writers before the As
sociated Press dispatches were substituted
for their more human sympathies and
conceits. The newspaper readers of to-day
do not know what they have missed by
coming upon the stage when "corre
spondents" are abolished and telegraphic
brevities are made to take their uluce.
In June, 1870, Miss Tingley was married
to state Senator James Henry Lawrence,
a lawyer and journalist representing the
district of Manposa, Stanislaus and Mer
ced counties, and for several years resided
in Mariposa. her husband owning and
editing the Gazette, to which she contrib
uted. Her summerswere spent at the big
trees and in the Yosemite Valley, enjoy
ing their wonderful beauties, and meeting
many agreeable tourists. A story in the
Overland Magazine called "Mountain
Posy," and an article entitled "A Bummer
With a Countess," are samples of her
work at this time. The latter, which was
the biography of Therese Yelverton or
Lady Avonmore, was also a scrap of
Caliiornia history, read before the
Historical Society of New York, and pub
lished in book form. She aiso wrote for
the Overlaid "College Charlemagne," a
sketch of the French college which she
attended from 1860 to 1863, which was
much commended by the Eastern press.
Later she wrote for the San Francisco
Chronicle a series of "High Sierra" arti
cles which were freely copied into trans
niontane journals, receiving praise for
their descriDtive charm from the most
conservative classes of readers. From
time to time she has written ior the sev
eral San Francisco journals, and also for
those of Sacramento. During the Cen
tennial year she acted as Eastern corre
spondent of the Bulletin.
The industry of Mrs. Lawrence has not
been all bestowed upon newspapers and
magazines, but she has written a' Califor
nia romance not yet published; and an
other book founded on the experiences of
i er friend, Mrs. Lucius H. Foote. wife of
the lirst United States Minister plenipo
tentiary to the 'kingdom of Korea, Mrs.
Foote being the first white woman to enter
the wallea Korean capital. Tnis also is
still unpublished, awaiting some revision.
Mrs. Lawrence has always been in an at
mosphere of cultivation, her education
having been carefully looked after by her
father, who was a man of tins literary abil
ity and an orator, as is also her husband.
She is a popular club woman, frequently
reciting some production of her own for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 19, lÂ»yÂ«.
the entertainment of her associates. She
is descended from a member of the Wash
ington family, her great-Krandfatbei hav
ing been a cousin of tne "Father of his
Country." Withal she is an unpretending,
quiet, self- possessed woman, the pleasure
of whose acquaintance grows by what it
feeds on : a helper of the poor, and a wise
counselor of the weak.
The thought which has been pursuing
me for some time is one of wonder that
with such writers as belonged to what I
should call the second period of California
literature so little credit has been given
them by reviewers of a later date. Take,
for instance, Mrs. Ella Sterling Cummins'
"Story of the Files," prepared for the
Columbian exposition and incorporated in
the final report on tne early writings of
the State, and much stress is there laid
upon the ill-judged saying of J. McDon
ough Foard, one of the founders of the
Golden Era, that it "was killed by letting
women write for it; they killed it with
their namby-pamby schoolgirl trash."
Now, there were 218 writers named who
contributed to that paper, seventy-eight of
whom were women, giving a preponder
ence of forty to the men's list. Among
the men writers were: Prentice Mulford,
Charles Warren Stoddard, Starr King,
Bret Harte. Mark Twain, Joaquin Miller,
John Muir, Edward R. Sill. Gilbert B.
Densmore, Stephen Mass6tt, 0. H.Webb
and others of unquestioned genius.
Among the women were Therese Yel
verton, Adah Isaacs JVJenken, Mary V.
Lingley, Ada Clare and (not Laving the
files before me I cannot name a whole
dozen) and the writer of this vindication
of her sex (who until Mrs. Cummins did
so was never called "weak and wordy"),
who, if they did not make, certainly did
not unmake the reputation of the Golden
Era. In fact, a large degree of the support
received by that "remarkable paper," as
Horace Greeley called it, was due to the
bright things said by the women who
wrote for it. The decline of the Era's
period in literature was due to new condi
tions. The men who had fostered it by
their abilities had found wider and more
remunerative fields, and the women like
wise. The weaker majority could not sus
tain the reputation of the paper. Besides
the overland railroad had opened the East
to us with its monthly magazines, its
great weeklies and dailies, and as I have
already pointed out the form and fashion
of journalism was changed. So unique
had been the character of the Era that at
this day it requires a "key" to enable the
reader to understand its "localisms. Such
a paper, when its peculiar period is oast,
becomes a sealed book, and such the Era
became, not on account of its women
writers, some of whom no doubt were
vapid enough, but because the world
moves.
A FLEET OF
SCOW SCHOONERS,
Craft That Make an Animated
Picture When Anchored
in Mission Bay.
Taken individually, few of the scow
schooners that are so numerous about the
bay are beautiful to look at. even when
seen under the most favorable circum
stances. But when a fleet of them is an
chored in Mission Bay they form as beau
tiful a picture as' can be found within a
day's journey of San Francisco.
The scow schooners are a craft peculiar
to San Francisco Bay. They sail up the
rivers to Sacramento, and Stockton and to
points on the bay as far south as Alviso.
Most of them are owned by their masters,
who attend to all of the business and in
many cases do the cooking. Few of them
have regular work, but as soon as one trip
is made tne captain has to go out and hunt
up another cargo. While he is doing this
he lays ; his vessel up in Mission Bay.
Sometimes there will be as many as thirty
schooners at anchor at the same time, and
there is never less than a dozen. \
A large number of : schooners ply only
between San Francisco and- Oakland and
can finish a job in a day. r In that case
i they, always anchor for the night in
! Mission' Bay and the ; fleet forms a little
! city on. the water that is full of life and
i color. If the evening is 'calm- and the
I water reflects the brilliant sunset sky on its
I smooth surface the forest of masts will be
j reproduced as myriads of quivering ser
pents. Fromeach vessel a tiny wreath of
pale blue smoke curls up until it mingles
with the delicate mists of evening. . After
supper strains of music float over the
water and small boats move here and
there, bearing visitors from one vessel to
another.
An altogether different picture is pre
sented on any morning, when the tide is
running in , and a stiff breeze is blowing
from the southeast. As most of the vessels
are empty they are as buoyant as corks
and even though the water be not dis
turbed to any great extent they will dance
around in the liveliest fashion. The masts
will swing; from side to side so that the
movement becomes confusion.
The hulls of *he vessels are of all sorts of
colors and the sails of most are weather
beaten and brown. Things are not gener
ally "trim" about scow schooners, but this
only adds to the 'element of picturesque
ness, as the swinging ropes and sails hang
ing loose help to create an effect of anima
tion. The stiffer the breeze blows the
more the boats roll and swing, until it
makes one dizzy to look at the ever-mov
iner, ever-cbangin? acene.
r The captains of scow schooners are hard
working men, and if they have anything to
do always -make an early start regardless
of the weather. They will hoist their
sails and go out in a storm, or when the
fog is .so thick the helmsman cannot see
the jib.

San Francisco boasts of a youthful

whom a brilliant career is predicted should
he choose art as his vocation In life.

had never taken a lesson in drawing ex
cept those mild tasks that are found in the
public-school drawing- books.
Then his persistent and somewhat suc
cessful attempts to delineate faces attracted
his father's attention, and, thinking he
might develop talent it given a'enauce, it
was decided that he shouid take lessons in
drawing. Thus far his only tutor has been
a man who draws and paints advertising
pictures, but the lad has already done one
elaborate pen picture that would do credit
to one twice his age.
The portrait was drawn from a piioto
graph of a painting of an itinerant old
tiddler and the youthful artist has caught
perfectly the expression of expectation on
the old man's face as he nolds out his hat
for stray pennies after giving a street per^
formance. The drawing was finished in
six sittings of about an hour each and has
been handsomely framed to be kept in
later years as a nienienlo of the lad's first
ambitious effort.
Young Goldberg is a scholar in the
seventh grade at the John Swett Grammar
School and has shown as much precocity
in his lessons as in his art work.

Some Suggestions Offered by a. Naval

the second line, which should be an en

question of fortifications and 1 harbor pro
tection. It would seem superfluous at this
late date to draw attention to the vulner
able ": condition of our great ports; every
rank, from general to lieutenant, has re
iterated again and again the 'need of ade
quate protection. ... Fortification . boards
have reported, and Congressional commit
tees have visited each 'defenseless locality;
the ; sum and substance of all inquiries
being, r that we are powerless to resist the
first onslaught from .even a second-class
navy. 'Suffice it to say to those who are
I clamoring for war, that $125,000,000 must
be I invesied in â  the ; building of j forts and
their equipment with modern ordnance.
If this seem Hrge, let, it be refnembered
â that it is no greater than the annual pen
sion appropriation. Certainly, safeguards
for the luture are as much a patriotic ne
ce.ssity as gratitude for military services of
the past. 1 : As in the case of battle-ships,
the element of time here faces us, and wo
must prepare some crude means for ward
ing off any sudden blow which, may be
struck before â  the completion of the
new forts. Again the question,' "What
can ;we>- do?" And once ; more
the answer; is, "Fall back upon the
mechanical .Ingenuity of our people and
| create at least, a .flimsy covering for our
military nakedness." In default of the
immediate formation of the general staff
an enlargement of t.ie duties of the war
college and "offices of intelligence" would
result in collecting much diverse infor
mation concerning the commercial plant
litted for building earthworks, blockading
clian n'els, placing su bmarine mines and
for-nuinerouc other purposes. Each State
should also establish. an "'office of intelli

ENGLISH PACKET SERVICE
How It Originated and Was
Carried On in the
p Olden Time. â¢ >*
A FAMOUS POSTOFFICE COLONY.
The Captains of the Packets Used to
~"~ Fight Their Ships
. Valiantly.
â¢ In a recent issue of the London Chroni
cle is an interesting 1 review of a new
book, "History of the Postofiice Packet
Service," by Arthur H. Norway. The
author tells,. with engaging modesty and
simple directness, a story which, in all
probability, is quite unknown to the* world
at large. People are accustomed nowadays
to think of the postoffice as the most pa
cific of all establishments. It was once,
however, a lighting service. : The convey
ance of mails over seas â now, as always,
the most important of its dutiesâ forced
this character upon : it. day the ques
tion is mainly one of speed. Only a few
generations ago it was mainly a question
of safety. The very change of significance
in the word "packet" shows the altered
conditions. To-day we think of a floating
hotel, some Lucania or Teutonic, designed
mainly for passenger traffic, and treating
the conveyance of mails as a mere mci- j
dent. A century ago the word denoted a
ship practically appropriated to the car
riage of mails and, what was more, armed
to the teeth. "V '*<â  ';'
The postoffice packet service, like the
roquelaure and Dutch gardening, came in
with the Revolution, .tor its headquar
ters choice was made of the best roadstead
for sailing ships in the English Channel,
Falmouth, which from a mere fishing vil
lage became as it were a postofhee colony,
existing solely for postal purposes and
thriving upon postal trade. A packet
agent, the ional representative of the
Postmaster-General (two at a time), pre
sided over this queer little community.
The captains and their crews were ser
vants of the postofficeâ an important fact
which, as it soon appeared, they were in
some danger of forgetting. With their
heavily armed ships and their fiery Cor
nish blood they only remembered that
they were "iirst-rate -fighting men" and
delayed the mails while they scoured the
seas for prizes. They dubbed themselves
privateers, but they were privateers with
out license from the Crownâ in plain Eng
li-h, pirates.
To recall them to a sense of their duty
their armament â  was reduced and they
were bidden not fight, but to outsail tneir
enemies. "You must, run when you can.
You must fight when you can no longer
run ;' and when you can fight no more you 1
must sink the mails before you | strike."
These instructions brought about unex
pected results. The packets neither out
sailed nor fought their enemies, but sur
rendered to them. One vessel even hauled !
down its before its opponent had tired
a shot, and, lest the darkness should cover
its dishonor, sent a boat off at once to an
nounce it. "â â .:â 
Curiously enough, these little accidents
always happened on the homeward voyage.
It took the postoffice authorities some
Jittle time to unriddle the mystery; when j
they dici they found it deliciously simple.
The packet crews, their officers, the agent
and the whole town of Falmouth were en
gaged in an elaborate system of private I
trade. The cargo, heavily'lnsiired* for the j
round voyage, was secretly disposed of j
at ; the outward port; the "capture of the I
vessel on the homeward voyage established I
a claim on the insurance "companies, and
the crews quietly pocketed a double profit.
There were other abuses. The sailors not
i only traded, but smuggled. The agent did
a littie business with his own packets m
the ship-chandlery line. The captains
sent the boats to sea under a fo'c'sle hand,
while they stayed at home and made their
piie.
There exists a significant minute of the
Postmaster Genpral on this point, dated
1798: "We cannot forget that Captain
P~â â has been absent from his duty dur
ing many years, as-signing no other cause
than the death of his mother in 1792."
Ultimately, greater vigilance at the gen
eral postoffice put an end to these abuses.
Private trading, at the cost of an abortive
mutiny, was suppressed, and during the
first decade of this century the packet ser
vice, while attending to iis proper busi
ness of carrying the mails, â¢ distinguished
itself, in safeguarding them, by a series of
actions as gallant as any in English naval
history.
The course of these actions was nearly
always the same. There was first an at
tempt to get away. Then, upon this
proving uselt^s, the mails were brought on
deck, heavily shotted, so as to be sunk in i
case the ship should have to strike her i
flag. The eriemy, relying upon superior I
numbers, would always attempt to board,
and when it came to hand-to-hand fight
ing the Englishmen were - nearly always
victorious. Many oi the packet, captains
died gloriously on their quarterdeckâ j
Bert Dyneley, Edward Curtis and John I
Arthur Norway, an ancestor of the writer
who now piously chronicles his heroism,
being among them. The men were worthy
of their commanders, and even the passen
gers would take a cheeriul share of the
fighting. â¢
A passenger, on the Cornwallis, which
beat. off six gunboats outside Tarifa in
1806,- writes: "Everybody on board did not
seem to mind at all, down to the little boy J
who serves U3 in the cabin, although we i
: could see they outnumbered all of we, for I
one Englishman is as good as two frog- I
eaters, and, I am sure, as good as any two !
of those rags of Spaniards. I saw that I
little David, the cabin lad who carried up I
the powder from below, sang merry until j
he had no wind with running up and down
so much, and he only cried one bit at first,
when a splinter from the boat's bottom
cut his forehead. H s face was very black
from the smoke, and :he looked* mighty
comic when I wrapped- his head inniy
large kerchief, which I did when I was re
covered from my fright."
In another engagement the ship's sur
geon, a Quaker, refused to arm himself in
the right, but seized a Frenchman, who
was .clambering on board, by the waist,'
and saying gently, "Friend, thee mates a
mistake, this is not thy ship," flung him
into the sea. We suspect that this gentle
man must have been a descendant of ',
Quaker William, in Defoe's "Captain Sin- j
gieton," who, it will be remembered, also !
declined' to bear arms, but recommended
his commander to board, in these terms:
"Friend, wnat dost thou mean? - Why
dost thou not visit thy - neighbor in the :
ship, the door being open for thee?"
â It was the downfall^ of , Napoleon that i
put an end to the Postoflice Packet Service,
as to so many other things. Three years
after Waterloo the service was taken over
by the -Admiralty,' until, with the develop
ment' of steam "power, it passed into the
hauds;of: private companies, under

innumerable schemes to grow them, for
such a thing as a real garden does not
exist in that part of town.
Every accessible place where the sun
strikes is utilized, if possible. A wide
window-sill is a treasure, and nearly every
one in the neighborhood is covered with
all sorts of plant", growing in all sorts of
receptacles. Real flower-pots are scarce,
because they cost money, but boxes, cans
and broken bottles are used everywhere.

Sometimes a sort of platform is arranged,
but most of the landlords object to this,
and not many can be seen. A favorite
method is to fix up a sort of hanging shelf
that can be suspended from a nail on the
window-sill by a cord. On this the plants
are placed during the day, but are taken in"
at night.
One narrow window-sill is made to hold
three old coal-oil cans filled with flowers.
The cans are out of balance, but kept from
sliding off by a wire stretched acros3 in
front of them and fastened to the wall at
both ends. The vents are turned down to
serve as air inlets. An anisic effect is
produced with old chianti bottles. Tiiay

these bottles and they are quite handy be
cause it is very little trouble to tie a string
around the neck and hang them on a nail.
There are a few window-sills in the
Spanish quarter of town that have no
flowers on them, but there are also many
people who have flowers and no window
sills. In order to give their cherished
plants a little of the sunlight that never
enters their rooms, these people will carry
them to the street if neressary and sit be
side them for hours. Most of the houses
have back porches, where the sun strikes
at some hour during the day. At such
times every one who has no window brings
out the flowers and moves them about to
give them as much sun as possible.

SCIENCE, LITERATURE
AND ART
A NATIVE of Montreal has in
vented a gun which, be confi
dently believes, when it is adopted
bjr all nations, will make war im
possible. If all that is claimed
for ii be true this gun is certainly the most
remarkable piece of ordnance in existence.
A description of the piece is furnished
by M. Sommery of Montreal, an agent of
tlie inventor, who recently returned from
Washington, after giving an exhibition of
the weapon bifore If. Patenotre. the
French Embassador, and the military
attache of the embassy.
The most remarkable feature of the gun
is that no explosive is used and that its
missiles are projected by an aeency th 6
nature of which is a profound secret, I
SMOKELESS A>D NOISELESS GIN.
which, without noise or smoke, is capable
of discharging the almost incredible num
ber of 260,000 shots a minute.
The gun in general appearance resembles
a field piece of the modern type. Over the
barrel are some cylinders, surrounded by
a pressure gauge, and to the rear is a
shoulder piece such as is commonly at
tached to rapid tire guns.
A little forward of the breech is a fun
nel, down which the bullets are passed
into the pun as fast as two men can pour
them. Underneath the gun and between
the wheels is placed the mechanism by
which the propulsive force is generated.
This is carefully inclosed, so that no hint
of its nature can be obtained, altbou-h
the presence of tie pressure gauge might
be taken as an indication that compressed
air is the'mysterious power used.
The mechanism, M. Sommery explains,
is pnt into action by simply giving a slight
oscillating movement the trail by means
of a lever worked by two men, the trail
â  being geared direct to the mechanism and
having no attachment to the axle, as is
usually the case. â¢
Once started the mechanism is said to
generate forcn enough as long as the
motion of the trail is kept up.
How the muscular strength of two
men could produce power sufficient
to throw 260.000 bullets a minute, with a
range of about 6000 yards, is something
that the inventor is not yet prepared to ex
plain. He insists, however, that no other j
source of power is used.
The power of the weapon seems to vary ;
greatly with the length of the piece, one j
two feet long giving a muzzle velocity
884 feet a second, while for the nine-foot
form the amazing velocity of 3752 feet is I
claimed, the bullets in each case being i
half an inch in diameter.
The inventor insists that his principle
can be applied to cannon of the largest
fcize.

to the Board on Fortifications.
Klectricity In the Kitchen.
In a modern house equipped with elec- j
trie devices the use of coal and gas is alto- i
gether obviated. In the kitchen hot water !
is supplied by a tubular electric boiler, j
Each water tube of this boiler is wound !
with wire resistance coils, and when the \
current is passed through the coils by the j
turning of a switch the water very soon ;
begins to boil because of the heat gener
ated by the resistance to the electric fluid, j
Along one .side of the room is arranged a â¢
polished wood bench, upon which the j
electric cooking-stove and electric pots and
pans are placed. Above this bench is
arranged a smoke-trap, provided with an
electric fan for creating a suction to draw
all the smoke from the room and discharge
it into the chimney.
The electric stove is heated by a plate of j
separated resistance bars. This plate can '
be raised or lowered in the stove to or
from the cooking article to give a greater
or less amount of heat. The top of the |
6tove i 3 provided with a window, and an j
incandescent light illuminates the interior |
so that the cooking article is in plain sight i
at all timee. The stove is started and
stopped by the simple turning of a switch.
The oegree of heat in the oven is regulated

frames provided with hollow-spaced bars i

and Â« pan beneath the same to catch the
drip. Electric resistance wires are passed
through the hollow bars and connected to
an electric circuit. When the current is
turned through this device the bars be
come heated and thoroughly broil the meat
between them. The electric frying pans,
coffee pots, gridirons and like cooking
utensils cover the remainder of the bench
and are each heated separately by electric
resistance coils applied on their under
sides. These articles are all detachably
connected to the circuit wires that pass
along to the rear of the bench, so that they
may be disconnected and carried about.
There is no smut or dirt a*>out any of the
devices or any part of the kitchen for the
obvious reason that there is no fire or coal
to create the same.
In one corner of the kitchen stands the
electric dishwasher. Rotable shelves are
mounted in this washer and are adapted to
receive the dishes. Flexible stationary
wipers are arranged over the shelves to
wash the dishes as they are carried about
by the rotating shelves. The shelves are
rotated by a small electric motor and hot
water is supplied from the electric boiler.
In the bedrooms electrically heated mat
tresses are used on all the beds. These
each comprise flexible resistance wires em
bedded in asbestos covering, which are
placed in the mattress proper. These
mattresses each diffuse a mild, gentle
heat, which can be instantly stopped
when so desired by turning the electric
current out of the mattress by a suitable
switch.
The blankets are also heated in the same
manner by electric resistances: All the
towels are also heated to a len tie warmth '
by flexible resistance wires embedded in
them, and flexibly connected with the
electric circuit. The combs and brushes
are also electrical, and are each provided
wiih their own batteries for generating the
current. The bristles of the brush are of
flexible metal, and are connected alter
nately to the positive and negative ele
ments forming the battery in the back of
the brush. The use of this brush invigor
ates the scalp and prevents falling of the
hair and like complaints.

Utilizing Power.
The engineers of the Marquette Iron
i Ranee Railroad have adopted a scheme
| for utilizing the power of a loaded train
| going down grade. It is proposed to
i string a trolley line over the tracks, which
j fall 800 feet in a distance of fifteen miles.
i The loaded cars, each carrying twenty-five
I tons, will be made up into trains of ten
cars each, and to each train a motor car
will be attached. On this car a dynamo
will also be placed, connected with the
axles of the car. The descending train
will thus generate electricity, which will
be conducted to the trolley line, and thence
to the motor car of an ascending train,
which will haul back the empty cars. It
is said t at the difference in weight be
tween the empty and ioaded cars will
make up for the loss of power due to fric
tion, leaxage, etc. It is quite probable
that the motor of the down cars could be
used as a dynamo, thus obviating the
necessity of an extra machine.â lndustrial

A Shower of Dynamite.
Recently numerous schemes have been
suggested for the protection of the country
in case of war, and many of which would
doubtless prove effective. One of these

schemes, by a Western inventor, H. G.
Rich of Dcs Moines, lowa, is called an
"aerial torpedo." The invention consists
of a gas-inflated balloon capable of sus
taining for any given length of time a
weight of 30 or 40 pounds at an altitude of
500 or 1000 feet. In the basket of the
balloon is placed an electrical device, the
purpose of which is to ignite the gas of the
balloon, causing it to explode at any de
aired time. In addition to this device
there ii placed in the basket a store of
dynamite or other explosive, designed to
explode on striking the earth. The man
agement of the torpedo is described as
very easy and simple, a corporal's guard
being sufficient.
The outfit is compact and simple, and a
large number can be cairied by a few men
or a pack animal. The gas to" inflate the
balloon is carried in light metal cylinders,
enough being compressed in one cylinder
to inflate a number of aerial torpedoes.
The torpedo is uÂ«ed by approaching near
to the camp or besieged city, where the
torpedo is desired to take effect, and, after
ascertaining the direction of the lower air
current and the velocity per hour, the
len.thof time it will take to carry the
balloon over the objective point is deter
mined, and the electrical device set at the
proper hour or minute. After the torpedo
is released the electrical device will ignite
the gas of the balloon, causing it to ex
plode, when the torpedo will fall to the
earth. The explosive, striking the earth
or other hard substance, will cause serious
damage in that locality. In the siege of
cities this aerial torpedo will be especially
effective, as no defense can be ma<ie
against it, and it can be used in the night
as well as the day and by a few men of
ordinary intelligence.
An Electric Pocket-Lamp.
In the January number of the Popular
Science News an electric cane was de
scribed, which serves the double purpose
of walking-stick or lamp. Much interest
was excited in the ineenious device â the
invention of Herr Vohwinkel, a clever
Austrian â and as much will doubtless be
aroused now by his application of the same
principle to an electrical pocket-lamp.
The lamp is made in several shapes and
sizes. The common form, shown in Fig.
1, looks very much like a pocket-flask;
and really it wouldn't be a bad idea for
temperance agitators to lay in a supply for
distribution among irreclaimable drunk
ards. Sir Toby Belch would place it to his
lijti and tip it up, but instead of the
tempting liquor there would gush forth a
blaze like a realization of the fiery sym
bolism of anti-saloon oratory.
The other form â see fig. 2 â resembles a
pocket telescope, and is fitted with lenses
and reflectors, which augment its illumin
ating powers considerably.
The light is furnished by a small incan
descent bulb; the battery is of the kind
commonly known as a revolvpr battery,
somewhat resembling the cylinder of a
revolver, giving a current of four to five
amperes with an intensity of six volts.
(See sectional view, rig. 1).
The flask light is covered with a knob of
hcavj' ground glass, to prevent breakage of
the bulb; in the telescope pattern this is
sufficiently protected by the cusine of the
lenses and reflectors.
The acid is in the lower partâ the reser
voir of the device, one might say. When a
light is wanted the lamp is tilted forward,
and the fluid, reaching the poles of the
battery, generates the current. One tilling
insures one and a half hours' continuous
Hunt. There is no waste when the light is
not in use; so this hour and a half of
illumination can be distributed as re
quired.
Electric Light on a Trawler.
The tise of electric lamps for drawing
fish into the fisherman's net is now an old
story, but the owners of trawling vessels
have found that this is not by any means
the only profitable use that can be made of
the electric light in conjunction with their
industry. A trawler recently put into Ab
erdeen, Scotland, which is probably, so far
as internal fittings and lighting are con
cerned the best equipped fishing-boat in
the world. She put into Aberdeen to dis
charge her catch, and the work was car
ried on under the electric livht, which is
fitted throughout the vessel. Incandescent
lamps are placed in the engine-room and
in the various berths, while on deck three
lumps are fixed on (he deckhouse, one at
each side of the bridge, and a mastliead
light. A large lamp, containing five
branches, can be moved to any part of the
ship at convenience. The current is gen
erated by a dynamo belted to the engine.
Some Gigantic Photographs.
The largest photographs that have ever
been made, if we are correctly informed,
wero those useel in Baltimore's Columbia
parade, in the fall of 1892. They repre
sented scenes in the life of Columbus, and
were used as decorations for the float of
St. Pins Parish in the parade mentioned.
The lareest one of the lot, a copy of
Gribayedoff's "Columbus Before Ferdi
nand and Isabella," was nine feet lonjjand
six feet wide. This photographic triumph
was made by a special process. The pat

An Electric Yacht.
A writer in the New York Sun thus de
scribes the electric yacht being built by
John Jacob Astor, the millionaire:
The boat, which has not yet been named,
will be seventy-two feet over all, twelve
feet beam and four feet draught. She will
be built in secret under a shed, ana will be
fitted with twin screws, which are to be
run by two electric motors capable of ne
veloping at least fifty horsepower. The
new boat is expected to have a maximum
speed of sixteen miles an hour, with the
motors revolving 1000 times a minute.
Her ordinary speed will be about ten to
twelve miles an hoar, and it is claimed
her batteries will run ten hours without
recharging. The power will be supplied
by 480 cells.
The cells as well as the motors are placed
entirely below the floor, thus occupying
none of the cabin space, so that the entire
room of the boat is unobstructed and clear
for accommodations. The entire boat,
decks, planking and exterior finish, will
be of polished mahogany, except the gun
wales, which are of quartered oak. There
is also a Ibw brass railing worked around
the decks at each end, while all the other
deck fittings will be of polished bronze.
The hull is of a peculiar foim, having a
channelway for each of the propellers, to
enable them to work in solid water. There
will be two Tobin bronze centerboards,
which may be raised or lowered by electric
capstans from the promenade deck.
The boat will be fitted with electric cap
stans, and there will also be a large air
chamber, connected with air pumps, to
supply air for blowing the whistles, which
will consist of an elaborate outfit of chimes.
It will also be fitted with a hand bilge
pump, as well as electric-driven pumps for '

freeing the boat from water in case of leak
age.
The accommodations consist of a cock
pit forward 11 feet long, fitted with seats
and windows on either side and bent glass
windows in the forward end. It is also fit
ted with steering wheel and independent
controllers lor handling each of the pro
pellers, spirit compass, binnacle, speaking
tubes and electric bells. There is a stair
way on either side at the after end of the
cockpit leading to to the main deck. The
seats will be upholstered in leather, and
all joiner work, as well as window-casings,
shutters, etc., will be of mahogany.
Next abaft comes the saloon, 8 feet long
and the entire width of the boat, fitted on
either side with seats arranged to unfold
and form wide berths. They will be beau
tifully upholstered with brocatelle and
velvet and fitted with drawers under same
Â«nd finished in elaborate geld trimmings.
Next abaft the saloon is the owner's
stateroom, seven feet long, extending the
full width of the boat. The berths are
arranged on either side so as to fold up
much the same as in the saloon, with
drawers fitted underneath. These berths
will be beautifully upholstered in bro
caded satin in harmonizing colors. At
the forward end is a large ciothespress on
either side, while at the after end there is
a plate-glass mirror on each side. Con
necting with the stateroom is a commodi
ous private toilet fitted witb bath, closet,
folding wash-basin and fresh-water tank.
The toilet-room will be finished in quar
tered oak and elaborately glazed tiling.
In addition to her electric battery Mr.
Astor's new yacht will be rigged as a
schooner and will have a good-sized sail
plan for use in case her machinery is disa
bled. The sails consists of fore and main
sails and jib and will be made of the best
Quality of full-bleached cotton duck of ap

Color Photography.
A method, differing radically from those
hitherto employed, has been devised, and
is interesting for its novelty, and is seem
ingly practicable. The plan is to have
the color on the sensitized paper before
printing â red, preen and blue lines ruled
in alteration, 300 or more to the inch. A
sheet of paper thus prepared appears
faintly tinted, and would almost pass for
white. The negative is made behind a
colored screen, ruled in exactly the same
way. Superimposed upon the paper in
the perfect register, the negative is then
used for printing, and, owing to the chemi
cal action which ensues, the color is fixed
wherever the light falls, and may be dis
solved off from those spots upon which
the light has not fallen. For instance, a
red point in the object photographed re- j
fleets a ray of red light which encounters !
a red line on the screen before the nega
tive and fails to get through. This same
point remains transparent after develop
ment, and will thus allow a red point on
the printing paper to be acted upon and
become fixed. Similarly with yellow and
blue colors.â Yale Scientific Monthly.

bility as well as the commercial advantage
of his scheme the chances are that it will
not be long before the great Atlantic Ocean
steamers which now ply between New
York and Liverpool will have been trans
forrmd into electric ships.
The means for electric propulsion of a vessel,
consisting of a conduit located beneath the
surface of the water, a conductor in said con
duit, insulated fluid of greater specific gravity
than WHter within snid conduit and a contact
or collecting device electrically connecting
said conductor with the current-using device
of the vessel.
The above is .an extract from the patent
specifications and the claims made by the
inventor, as well as a sketch of the device
of this, the first patented method for elec
trically propelling vessels on record.
It will be observed upon examining the
invention, that it iw the intention of the
inventor to utilize the conduit system. Of
course the conduit will not be underground,
but submarine; in other respects, however,
it is very similar to the ordinary under
ground electric conduit spstem as it is now
in use in this country and Europe.
New l T Â»c of Glass in Building-
By a new process glass is made to repre
sent a highly polished wood when viewed
from the exterior, and when looked at
from the interior of the house gives a semi
transparent and very handsome effect.
In the veneering process the glass, which
may be either plain or ground, is clouded
with a liquid dye, which is applied
with a sponge in such a way as to repre
sent the grain of the wood which it is de
sired 10 imitate. After shading has been
softened the grain is made clear and fast
by an application of photographer's var
nish. Ihe glass is then heated slightly to
prevent the shadings from merging, and
j the various shades of dye required are ap
i piied with a syringe. A final coat of pho
tographer's varnish is then added, which
increases the brilliancy and protects the
dyes.
Fishing by Electricity.
We described the other day the aston
ishing evolutions of tadpoles subjected to
the action of an induction current. L'Etin
celle Electrique now gives us the means of
utilizing the same effects in the case of
fishes:
"In the glass prison of an aquarium
swim peacefully several small fish. You
approach, armed with two metal plates,
connected to the two poles of a small
Ruhmkorff coil.
"You plunge the two plates in the
aquarium, one on each side, at A and B.
The innocent victims, suspecting nothing
of your evil designs, manifest at first a lit
tle fear, mingled with curiosity, but soon
resume the peaceiul course of their grace
ful evolutions.
"The zincs of your battery having been
lowered so as just to touch the liquid, and
the screw of your coil regulated so that ito
point is not in perfect contact with the vi
brator, you draw the latter over against
the coil and then let go. There result a
few vibrations each followed by a contact,
and consequently by the sendinc of a few
brief induction currents through the
liquid of the aquarium. The fish seem
struck with madness. With an expres
sion, which if you are a physiognomist
you will certainly find to be that of aston
ishment, they execute a frenzied saraband
in their prison.
"But this is only a foretaste of what
awaits the poor creatures, victims of your
passion for electro-physiology.
"Immerse your zincs entirely and screw
up the vibrator-screw so that the coil will
work normally. Then there is no more
anger among the poor fish, but resigna-
Action of an Alternating Current on Fish
tion. As soon as they pass between the
two fatal plates they nse to the surface,
bellies upward. The effect is very striking
and curious to observe. ,
"Nevertheless, it Is only the appearance
of death, perhaps onfy a trick. If you
have not used a very powerful battery
whenever the current ceases, whenever
you stop the vibrating hammer with yonr
finger, the fishes turn over, and as soon as
you let the vibrator go they turn belly
upward again and rise once more to tne
surface."

Wasps Commit Suicide.
A short time ago, says Popular Science
News, M. Henry, being curious to see the
effect of benzine on a wasp, put some of it
under a glass in which one was impris
oned. The wasp immediately showed signs
of great annoyance and anger, darting at
a piece of paper which had intro
duced the benzine into his cell.
By and by he seems to have
given up the unequal contest in despair,
for he lay down on his back, and, bending
up bis abdomen, planted his sting thrice
into his body, ana then died. M. Henry
allowed his scientific interest to overcome
his humanity so far as to repeat the ex
periment with three wasps, only to find
that the other two did "likewise. He is
therefore of opinion that wasps, under
desperate circumstances, commit suicide.
Various Notes.
The Soar family of Ambaston, Derby
shire, England, have a curious heirloom
n the shape of a loaf of bread which is
now over 600 years old. The founders of
the family, it appears, were great friends
of King John. When that monarch died
he made several land grants to the Soars.
One of these tracts, it appears, had always
been conveyed with a loaf of bread as a
witness of good faith. When King John
made over the papers to the original Soar
he sent the traditional loaf along with the
"writings," and the deed and tne loaf are j
I both kept to this day as sacred relics.

hollow rod in the desired length, the cross
pieces being held by key-shaped wooden
pieces driven in on either side of the pole.

TREE GROWING IN A BOAT.
Strange Sight on the Bar Shore Not Far
From Benfcia.
On the shore of Suisun Bay, between
j the Carquiuez Straits and Benicia, a most
j unusual siaht can be seen. It is grotesque
I in the extreme, but there is nothing mys
terious nor apparently impossible about
it. It is that of a tree growing in the
hatch of the wreck of a sloop.
What the name of the sloop was or the
length of time it has been lying in its
present position are things past finding
| out. When the vessel was in good shape
I sha was a craft of about forty feet in
j length and eight feet beam. Judging
from her lines and manner of construe
! tion she was a vessel with good sailing
! qualities.
When abandoned she was hauled onto
j the mud at high tide and has since sunk
:so deep as to become immovable. The
place where the hull is stuck is what
! would be called good "tule land," as tnere
j is a fine growth of that reed in the vi
| cinity. The bottom of the boat has rotted
I away and they have formed quite a growth
! inside the hull, large numbers of them
! poking through the batches. A peculiar
. thing will be noticed in the growth and
I that is that they grow straight up aa stiff
I as a bayonet instead of having tne grace
j ful sweep so common under ordinary con
aitioDS.
How the tree came to grow in the boat
is a mystery, but most likely the seed
blew into the old hull from some of the
I trees on the surrounding hillsides. Close
I examination would be a difficult and dis
I agreeable matter, but seen from shore it
1 appears to be a specimen of live oak. It
! has attained a height of about ten feet
: above the deck of the wreck and appears
| to have a healthy growth.
Such a thing would not be possible a
little farther down, as the water is too
salt, but on the shores of Suisun Bay the
conditions are iust right. The air is
warm most of the year and fertility has
undoubtedly been given to the soil by the
decaying wood in the bottom of the sloop.

THE LATEST GOSSIP
FASHION
FOR
WOMEN
AND
MEN
p~-|=^HE past week has been a pay one,
the presentation of "A Modern
Ananias" having been the princi
\\ pal event, which was brilliantly
successful, most of our most ad
mired belles having been present. On the
same evening many well-known people
were present at the charity concert given
in the Occidental parlors. I trust that
financially it was a success, for the cause
is a worthy one and the programme was
excellent. On Friday another luncheon,
this time on Pine street, was given in
honor of one of our most popular brides;
about twenty were piesent. On Thursday
was the large recep ion and tea at the
Pixley home, to which were bidden all
members of the "Needlework Guild," a
noble charitable organization far-reaching
afitt most excellent. The house was more
than crowded. Saturday one of the
largest and most brilliant receptions of
the season was given by the patriotic
society of the Daughters of the Revolu
tion. Almost all of our prominent women
were present and not a few of their hus
bands. The army and navy were well
represented. What a pity that hall a
cozen men-of-war were not in the harbor.
Many went from the clubhou?e to the tea
given in honor of one of San Francisco's
most lovely debutantes. T;ie tea con
cluded with a <iinner party, greatly en
joyed by the numerous youthful guests.
Many other delig tful affairs are on the
tapis, and. as a result, all oi us are busy
ordering new gowns and all manner of
dainty, pretty things, as. with the arrival
of spring, it seems only right that our
cowns, etc., should be in keeping with the
beautiful background prepared by nature,
so let us to our frills and tads. One of the
marked fashions is to have our sleeves
gathered on the shoulders, in three to five
runners.
Speaking of linings reminds me that the
silk baiayeuse is acain in fashion, and our
skirts must be iined with a siik of a tone
that shades into or harmonizes witn the
material, not one that matches it. A
black skirt lined with a violet siik, chang
ing to gray, lines the skirt of a stylish
London-made tailor suit with excellent
effect. The most fashionable skirts are as
full as ever, but they are cut to stand out
more at the <ides and to fall more softly.
'â¢The fullness at the back narrows into
alnioft nothing." This is Doucet's cut,
for Paquin is trying to introduce fullness
f>n the hips, but without success, as on the
Doards of the leading Parisian theaters
this mode has received no encouragement.
The princess style is rapidly increasing
in favor. Toe newest sleeve is quite narrow
to well above the elbow, and shaped to the
arm, and then the material expands into
soft folds, which form a puff. The great
object is to give an idea of length, for in
eftect a lonz sleeve cannot be too long.
Monair.canvas and pique are being sold
in great quantit'<tÂ». Tne canvas and mo
hair gowns are frequ. ntly trimmed with
chine or shot silks. Panels are sometimes
introduced down the front. Let us trust
that this very hideous fashion will not be
generally observed.
Basques are to be short, and must be cut
carefully with relation to the hips. Mus
lin ruffles will be seen on many gowns,
and a new shade of yellow has appeared,
but few and far between are the women
who can appear in yellow. Even a touch
of it about a dress will frequently rum it.
Dark skirts will be much worn with bod
ices having light touches about tnem.
Black grenadine will be universally worn
by smart women.
"The shirt and coat combination is as
mucii the vogue as ever, owing in a meas
ure to the popularity of alpaca, mohair
and similar fabrics, which do not make up
into satisfactory tight bodices and only
should be handled by a good tailor, and
for such costumes "the sleeves are de
cidedly smaller. However the modi tied
puff still exists. Naturally cravats and
waistcoats are important subjects and the
most exquisitely fine and beautifully em
broidered cambrics are utilized. Grass
lawn run with gold threads is declared by
good authorities to form excellent close
litting waistcoats. They fasten invisibly.
An expensive and beautiful article is the
waistcoat of chiffon elaborately fulled.
The finish of the waistcoat at the neck de
pends upon the contour of chin and throat,
as only the woman with the slender long
throat can wear the chic thick ruffle put
around the top of the collar band. The
woiran with a plump, well-shaped throat
looks well in tne plain turndown linen
collar. This collar is to be much worn
this season, especially on silk shirts when
completed with a silk necktie. The new
est turndown cuffs are just one incu in
width. They are becoming to the hand
and give a finishing touch to a plain shirt
sleeve.
In many cases entire bodices are being
made of embroidered batiste, and yet
others are entirely composed of embroid
ery, excepting the sleeves. One variety
can be had in an overlaid pattern in red,
dark blue or black. Edgingand insertions
can always be had to match the open-work
embroidery. Batiste and lace frequently
trim bodices, the center being 01 plain
batiste, the edging which borders both
sides of the plain fabric is of narrow
Valenciennes lace embroidered with a pat
tern of dots worked in twine-colored
threads. Batistes worked in silk are lovely
and will never become common, being
very expensive. For the same reason the
finest embroidered grass linen may be
safely used, as $3 and $2 75 per yard are
prices asked, and the width is not great.
I have heard of a good use for this.
A waist of a fine French taffeta
came home to a friend of mine
from her dressmaker covered with a
line black silk applique lace, which
not only formed the vest and collar, but
also covered the back. It was an expen
sive garment, so on discovering that the
shade of blue was hideously unbecoming,
especially after the addition of the black.
Miss X was for a moment undecided what
to do, as she at once saw that tie bodice
must be relieved with a light color; so she
carefully removed the black trimming and
purchased a piece of wide gras9 lawn in
sertion for a vest and sufficient of a fine
edging to make a soft pretty collar and
cuffs. The vest was placed over white silk
and the collar and cuffs prettily finished
with a touch of black velvet. Now the
waist is a success, and many an old bodice
could be freshened up in the same way
and the expense will not be heavy, as half
a yard of he insertion is sufficient, which
means 75 cents, and rive yards of the lace
at 40 cents per yard will be all sufficient,
add 25 cents for white silk to line the vest,
and for ?3 you can produce results that
will .be most satisfactory.
Dresses of twine-colored linen canvas
are very stylish East, and this material is
to be had at one of our principal stores, i
have just seen a gown ot it, and am con
vince! that for outing nothing better
could be used. The one I saw was the
work of an excellent tailoress here, and
consists of a jaunty little silk-lined coat, a
tailor vest with small white pearl buttons
and an absolutely plain skirt, perfectly
cut and well hung. It has a silk ruffle
but no lininer. Such a gown can be worn
with a feel in ir of placidity, as in evÂ»ry
detail it is faultless and certainly can be
worn an entire' season without having to
be consigned to the laundryman if occa
sionally pressed.
For seaside hops a bright girl is having
a . silk gingham â¢ made up into one of the
most fetching frocKs I have seen. The
gingbara has a white ground, with bright
orange \ stripes and while satin dots. A
little yellow satin, a few yards of mousse
line de s-oie and several ynrds of white lace
enter into its composition.
I think our. gin's are generally modest in
their Â°xpenditures on summer hats, for a
New York correspondent writes, "from,
three to four hats are quite indispensable
(if one intends to be at all smart) during
the summer season." The same writer
makes a good remark. ; She says:
It is a dangerous thing to have horticul
tural enthusiasms when â¢ ordering rÂ»r
selecting a bat of : the new order where
space on crowns and brim afford such
broad sweeps for self-indulgence. The
thing to avoid is this over-trimming,
which enters so stealthily under the ban
ner of la mode itself, to destroy our bon
gout. To the happy mean must one looK
for lasting satisfactions and most alluring
appearances. it follows then that a limi
tation to our expenditures is a capital safe
guard, hindering us from disfiguring our
selves by masses of gorgeou*ness, and
wild incongruities. The expression wild
incongruities exactly expresses the ap
pearance presented by many of the
chapeaux to be seen on all sides. They are
simply wonderful and dreadful, great glar
ing pink roses perched aggressively beside
bachelor buttons or the yellowest of cow
slips next forget-me-nois, and such great
bunches of t ings, I shudder when I re
call some of them and sigh wh?n think
ing of many of the pretty sweet faces that
are under these flower , gardens. I say
again, try to avoid top-heavy bats. , Exert

Parasols are now receiving their share of
consideration, a"d well worthy are they of
both our admiration and commendation
as well,' for they are deliciously pretty
and artistic. Silk-covered ones> are stiil
shown with Dresden flowers, but large con
ventional designs in flowers of silk having
a white or dark ground are newer, and
those having plain or China silk borders
or shaded colors are shown and those com
posed of plaided silks are also to be had.
The pure white parasols are sore tempta
tions for the pretty girls with limited al
lowances, for they must be covered with
fine net or iace frills or with . chiffon,
which can be '.white or softly tinted to
match the linWig. One trirl had last sum
mer a white silk foundation covered with
ruffles of a lovely flowered gauze; the
rutfl.es she had frequently changeu: first
the parasol was frilled with a gauze cov
ered with wild roses, then with one
sprayed with buttercups. It next ap
peared gorgeous with poppies and I nave
no doubt that it will do good service again
this season.
Very effective is a parasol of white satin,
covered with a heavy white silk hst em
broidered in quaint geometrical designs.
It has a deep ruffle of black chiffon. The
handle is white, with a large Dresden knob
painted in black and purple. This is
the property of a pretty widow; and this
reminds me that fashion has decreed that
even those in the deepest mourning can
wear dead white. The Princess of Wales
always does so. and it is a usual custom in
Europe, and a.yery sensible one in all re
spects, especially in the summer time.
. I see that a novelty in parasol covering
is being well received. It is sold apart 'â 
from the parasol, and is found in various |
sheer fabrics, more or iess washable. These
coverings are said . to be most useful, and
are made of white net in a series of full j
ruffles, or of dotted nets. Perhaps the !
most useful are of ! sheer muslin, lace '
edged, and deep ruffles of Valenciennes I
are much liked.
Among the most chic gowns to be seen
are those of mousseline de soie. They
are simply incrusted with laces and come
in not only plain and solid colors, but in
'â¢chine effects of two snades of tbe same
color as well."
Black tulle gives a Frenchy touch to
many toilettes and is most extensively
used, being unusually becoming.
Eton and Figaro jackets appear in
many delightful fabrics and combinations.
Black grenadines, in a multitude of open
designs, are to worn over colored taffe
tas. One Ytfrf|^aa^' L liful gown is of cross
barred sr&a'wffhger a!c green .satin, the
color sbowVK^jgjyfcough the b;irs. The

Women , with any pretensions to style
all possess at least one smart tailor gown
and as a critic remarks, "the tailor cos
tume is more classical than it has been for
the last few seasons." The sleeves are
smaller, the jackets shorter and the godet
has vanished, and i; the '< skirts, although
plain; demand the greatest care in the cut.
Everything depends on the fie, and
skirt must be of the exact width requisite
for ease of movement, and it must be well
shaped to the hips. In spite of : the varied
weaves in alpaca and ; mohair which are to

epaulette, over which extends a large collar ;

A brown tweed frock with pipings of
myrtle grân velvet is very stylish. It has :
a plastron of a lighter shade of brown, the j
pretty little turned-down collar is of the
velvet, which pipes all the seams. The \
skirt is cut as Rertfern knows so well how |
to cut all garments made by him, for this
one comes from his establishment. A
round, brown straw leaf, simply trimmed
with quills and rosettes of green velvet, is :
suggested as very appropriate to be worn ]
with this gown.
The evening dress illustrated is the j
production of a Frenchwoman. It is of '
"thick, cream-colored satin, ed>:ed with j
sable, the seams on either side being of i
the loveliest lace. The stripes are of nar- !
row black velvet, studded with diamond
buttons." The bodice is draped round the i
figure and is of the cream satin. It has \
an inner chemisette of the finest muslin
and lace insertions. As you see, the
sleeves reveal the arm, the small under- 1
sleeve bring made ot insertion of tucks,
lUe the ton portion of the bodice, which
is threaded with the tiniest of pink satin
ribbons.
A good visiting dress is composed of
chine silk of black and white stripes. The
bodice is of a modified directoire with
cape-like revers, andga waistcoat of white
satin and paste buttons, as are also the
gauntlet cuffs of the satin. A jabot of lace
effectively finishes it.
For a youn<: woman nothing could be
more desirable than a navy blue canvas â¢

bodice embroidered in thin stripes of goid
and silver and copper. With this should
be worn a fancy cape of black net, which !
is placed on a foundation of orange shot
silk in a series of three very full box- '
pleated ruffles, the first three of which are
finished with a full ruche of black lace;
such a ruche completes it at the neck.
The dre9s of grass lawn is now too com
mon to merit our consideration, unless
made of the exquisitely fine embroidered
lawn â the $2 75 per yard qualityâ over I
silk. Just such a frock has been received j
with approval and it is completely lined
with whit? silk. The beautiful open-work
embroidery around the hem gives one a
glirupse of the silk. The bodice is full
and trimmed with fnllings of embroidery
and lace. The sleeves extend to the elbow
only and are striped with the embroidery.
I have just read about a pretty colored
poplin made with a short Eton bodice
composed of embroidered grass lawn, on
which are worked medallions of guipure.
Three rows of black velvet ribbon trim it
and the front is of white chiffon, the col
lar being of a most becoming shade of
green. A serviceable dress is of blue gibe
line, with panels of green cloth braided in
black. The jaunty coat has a vest of green
braided.
Such a long time has elapsed since I
mentioned tea gowns that I am sure you
will be interested in hearing of one of a
soft bluisli green brocade. It has a floral
design, made with a Watteau pleat falling
from beneath a pointed collar, which is
bordered by a goid sequin trimming, of
which also the corselet beit is made. The
sleeves are of the new shape, consisting of
a shoulder puff and ruffled chiffon. Down
tne front, from the neck to the foot, a jabot
of accordion-pleated chiffon falls grace
fully. Another is very dainty of shot ap- i
pie-green silk, which has a front of chiffon
and bretelles of embroidered lace, with
painted medallions on the white satin.
One of the most admired gowns in "The
Grosfc Fortune" was a princess one of a
light green veivet which laced at the back ',
and was absolutely plain excepting that
the material in the bodice fell apparently
in natural, swathed tolds.
From Paris comes quite a novelty. It is j
a gown of striped .ireen and white cbine j
silk with rases. This joins a plain skirt j
and full bodice with a folded belt of tlie j
same over this. This is intended for house
wear, but for out of doors is worn over
this a shaped skirt of green canvas bor
dered with a narrow galon. It opens in
front showing the flows re<i silk and could
be thrown off at a moment's notic â , and ;
the bodice has a plainly cut hal.-handker- j
chief of the canvas, the point falling at !
the back, the two ends being tucked under '
the belt in front, thus completely tran3- I
forming the appearance of the gown. The
s-eeves are close-fitting to above the elbow.
The fullness is caught up in the center.
Silk c.-tpes are to flourish as never be
fore, and are to be of great beauty, when
encircled with lace, chiiion offtny of the
beautiful gauzes to be found in such rich
profusion at all our large stores. Traceries
of beads, jet, gold and silk are seen on
others. Besides the capes of silk are to be
found capes of peau de soie. ruffled with
silk edges, chiffon, and beautified with an
applique of white lace. Spangles are
seldom seen except on crass lawns, when
they are permitted to decorate the glace
silk capes. A cape of white and gray
striped glace has quadruple capes edged
with full ruches of black net. It fits quite
closely in at the back, fastening into the
waist with a ribbon-belt. A dear little
cape of violet velvet has a collar of white
satin, the e-quare revers are covered with
an exquisite embroidery of violets
incerspersed with esthetic browns and
greens on grass iawn foundation. The
lining is of white satin, and around the
neck is a lar; c ruche of white chiffon.
For a young slender woman I recommend
a cape of drab cloth with square white
satin revers covered with embroidered
lawn. This cape fits closely in the back,
and it fastens below the waist in front
with a hook and eve. Each team is striped
with narrow embroidery, which almost
meets at the waist, and is lined wit a
fawn silk, shot with green. For evening
wear has been created a mantle of tan
moire benualine. The collar is of the finest
old lace, and the lining is of glace of
a changeable green hue. The sleeves are
caught up so as to show a touch of this
greenâ the back hangs in two large VVat
teau pleats, down each of which is seen
an insertion of the lace.
The full short coat, which is one of the
novelties, hangs from the yoke t* ab jut
three inches below the waist. This pretty
garment is being much patronized in
Paris, as it is very attractive, being easily
adjusted, comfortable, and almost as effec
tive in cloth as in velvet. The neck is
usually completed with a ruche of net or
chiffon, but th. tabbed Tudor collar is al
ways used for those who have short necks.
When it adorns a cloak destinod for any
one with a long, slender throat, a ruche of
chiffon shows between each tab. These
loose coats, of course, have larsre, loose
sleeves without any stiff interlining. A
truly charming coat of this description is
the property of a New York belle, and
only she and her little French maid knew
that it did not come direct from one of the
great French houses. This earment was
evolved from a remnant of rich green satin,
which forms the coat and sleeves, the yoke
being made of a delightful scrap of won
derful green velvet, embossed with pinkish
crysamhÂ«mum. This yoke is outlined with
narrow dull-gold passementerie; the vest
is of cream-white, accordion-pleated chif
fon, and shows the color of the lining,
which is of a very delicate pinkish satin.
Three rows of the passementerie encircle
the neck, over which is sewn a ruche of the
chiffon.
It is not likely that more than one or
two of these coats will be seen here this
summer, bin we may expect them to be
worn in a slightly modified form all
through the aiuumn and winter, a word
to the wise, you know, so begin collecting
appropriate remnants.
A coat of black satin with a military
braiding on the sleeves of cold braid is
said to be attractive. "A frill of shot rib
bon emerges from the back of the sleeves,
edged with black Russian net; the revera
are of w'nte satin." The front is of em
broidered grass lawn with frills of the
shot ribbon edged with black net. Al
though I have not seen this garment I can
say unhesitatingly that I should not care
about it; however, I mention it, as I want
all tastes to be satisfied.
For traveling or driving cloaks are now
being made which are lovely affairs, not
bearing the slightest kinship to the hide
ous old-fashioned dusters of brown linen
or pongee. The new ones C3n be had in
Bhot glace or chine silk, or in any of the
new mohairs. They are trimmed with a
ruche of silk or lace; for instance, one has
a wide fall of lace encircling the shoul
ders and extending down the front, the
collar being a rea: Tudor, lined inside and
out with good Irish point. The back is
drawn in at the waist and is usually pretty
and graceful. A garment which can be
called neither cloak nor cape nor mantle
is composed of black velvet. It sets full
from a silk yoke and has jet epaulettes.
The sleeves are curious wing-like affairs,
tinished -vith a ruche of black chiffon
embroidered with gold. A ruche appears at
the neck. The lining is of a shot blue and
gold silk.
Bodices and blouse bodies are receiving
much attention at this season of the year,
as in spite of all reports to the contrary
our best dressmakers are weekly sending
out fancy waists or all descriptions, which
will be worn on numerous sort 3 of occa
sions. One seamless bodice for street wear
ha* a slightly gathered front, which is
braided all over with a small design
prettily contrasting with the light cloth of
whi< hit is made. The sleeves match the
skirt and have a braided cuff. The waist
is finished with a twisted scarf ot silk.
A bodice that can be worn in the even
ing and at home in the daytime is cut
high out of a rarely lovely piece of light
blue silk, which is covered with a rich
iace of a coarse texture, with here and
there a gold ring embroidered upon it.
At the neck anil sleeves there is a soft
ruche of delicate blue tulle. This waist
can be worn not only with a skirt of blue,
but equally well with Â«ray or black.
A novelty describe! as "charming" is a
blouse in white leather, embroidered in
black and silver with white undine sleeve*.
This was worn with a handsome black
cloth skirt.
Embroideries will be worn extensively
and on a bLick satin bodice appeared cut
steel cabochons. This satin is draped
about the figure and the sleeves are comp
osed of black chiffon caught up on the
shoulder, tied handkerchief fashion, and
the satin skirt is relieved by four Daneis
striped with the single steel cabochon.
This is a good and useful gown.
A bodice of violet velvet is embroidered
in gold, jet and turquoise. The top por
tion of this and the Duffed sleeves are of
velvet chiffon lined with an unusual shade
in blue, and the skirt of .violet silk is
striped with tucks of violet velvet. These
go straight around at the back, pointing
upward a t the side in ji style said to be
like tiie earJy Victorian.
One of the latest additions to a bodice is
the new tippet. It s distinct from the
skirt and easily added, and entirely alters
the appearance of a gown. For instance.
a dress of shot mohair has a bodice of
chine glace trimmed with white lace, jet
studded, The tippet is of the mohair.
A narrow galoon edging it, of the lace,
extends in two sharp points below the
waistband of satin ribbon, which ties in a
smart bow at the left side. A bodice cut
in the coat style is very chic, being of
peach and green silk ; the front and sieevea
are adorned with lace. The sleeves are
slashed here and there and turn back
in revers, showing the silk lace between
the slashings.
Very fetching are the shirts which are
b^ing made of bandana in red, green and
gold, but some greatly favor the latest
London fad, shirts of white satin, made
with a stiff front, tucKed on either side.
These have turn-down collars and cuffs of
satin. At the neck is tied a white satin
bow. They are said to be "the most be
coming, the most expensive and ihe most
unusual shirts seen' for a long time, and
they must be made by a regular man's
shirtmaker.
The latest fad is a "Marie Antoinette
tea." This suggests delightful and novel
ideas, worthy of the consideration of tea
givers.
A "Chafing-dish Club" nourishes in Bal
timore and is declared to be "great fun."
The fair members have to pledge themselves
to eat there what they cook. Not a,t all a
bad idea this, to experiment on themselves
instead of waiting to experiment on hus
bands later on. Marcella.
FOR MEN.
Some men, weary of colored shirts, have
declared their intention of wearing white
shirts this summer. However, the blue
and pink shirts will be great favorites,
but no man will ever indulge in more than
one yellow shirt, for they are wonderfully
unbec ming, but very blonde men may
look artistic when arrayed in some of the
latest shades of green.
Concerning tlie colored shirt a writer
says that as long as London aud England
exist it will probably be fashionable, and
its star in the ascendant, it would be per
fectly correct to wear white linen during
the entire year, if you chose, but white
linen bosoms are not seen frequently when
the club tie, which is the only comfortable
neckwtar for summer, is in vogue. You
could wear white or colored percale scarfs,
but they would look very warm and un
comfortable in midsummer* A'though the
harberdashers' shops teem with colored
shirts, and every one is wearing them,
still there are only a certain number of
men who are seen in the best examples
and designs. We all wear trousers and
coats and hats, but it is individual ideas
which denote tue^ line between the com
mon and that which is smart.
When wearing colored shirts the cuffs
must match the shirt bp3om and correct
shirts always have the cuffs attached.
Cuffs are still square and must not be too
deep.
Silk and Madras shirts are being made
with white cuffs attached.
On shipboard a man can wear a black
morning or cutaway coat in to dinner, and
when crossing tlie Atlantic many men
wear "knickers" with thick-soled russet
leather shoes.
Last summer men dressed very little at
Newport, taking as their examples the
Duke of Marlborough and other titled
Englishmen, who looked on all occasions
cool and comfortable, and did not even
wear their frock coa ts or top hats to church
on Sunday.
Knickerbockers will be more worn than
ever before this summer, as the bicycle
tours will be very numerous; but unless
possessed of an unusually good figure, a
man will not risk having his knickers
made by any but a first-class man. One
tailor, I see, is offering to make jacket,
breeches and cap for from $10 to $20.
Last summer, at Tuxedo, many com
mented on the fact that men were not
particular enough about having their
wagons and carriase3 in perfect condition.
Indeed, some of the horsey did not have
their hoofs properly scraped aod black
ened. There is a decided tendency shown
to be careless in such matters, men seem
ingly forgetting that "their traps should
be as immaculate as their boots or their
linen," for, as a critic well remarks:
"You may have all the pedigree you
wish ; your name may figure as a patron
of half a dozen associations, and it may be
followed by all sorts of mystic initials in
the social register. This may do in its
way, but give me a glance at a man's
hordes, his carriages and his servants, and
I will tell you whether he is a gentleman
or not. They are the reflection of himself."
The knitting of golf stockings has not
yet become a fad even in Burlingame.
However, the cheerful clink of needles
may be heard ere long in that favored spot.
Men certainly show individuality nowa
days when selecting their clothes, and
when they possess taste as well the re
sults are excellent.
We continue to oe threatened with loud
ties and terrific waistcoats. However,
those who understand what is correct will
never indulge in extremes, no matter what
fashion may proclaim to be the latest.

BUB ON WEDDING VEILS
Early History of the Conven
tional Bridal Head-
Covering.
ANCIENT PENELOPE LEGEND.
Hjw the Ladies of Queen Anne's Time
Gluttonizid in Meat and
Drink.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 13.â As there
are weddings and brides and suggestions
of brides and weddings everywhere one is
forced to wonder what the new woman
will assume in place of the wedding veil.
Naturally she won't wish to wear that
frivolous white tulle thing fancied now, as
it is too feminine. Its very origin is es
sentially womanly. It is claimed for it by
the Orientalists that it is a remnant of the
Eastern canopy, but it is also claimed for
it that it had its origin in the behavior of
Penelope, who, when she was asked by
her father whether she would leave him
and go with her husband, did not
answer, but drew her veil over her face to
hide her blushes. This silence was equiva
lent to the "yes" which is said by the mod
ern maiden onJy more audibly, ana at
the altar. There is no doubt about it that
the most becoming veil is the soft one of
shimmering tulle, which is cream white
in shade aud cloud-like in effect. A bride
wants to seem enveloped in it; it must
fall behind her and fall in front of her,
like part of the heavens, surround her
until she really seems a something en
tirely too good for everyday food, or an
ordinary man. The lace veil inherited
from oui grandmother, which is frequently
bought from a smart second-hand shop,
is expensive but not becoming. It makes
a girl look matronly, and it will suggest
the lace lappets worn by her Royal High
ness, Queen Victoria of England, a lady
for whom I have tiie utmost respect, but
whose appearance is not suggestive of a
bride.
Although you and I would think a bride
looked awiuf in anything but a white veil,
opinions differ. The happy Roman bride
hid her blushes under a veil of deep yel
low. The Persian maid intensified her
modesty, as painted on her cheeks, by
wearing a veil of rose color; the Greek girl
went her one better, and made her blushes
look almost tierce by wearing a veil of
bright red, while the young lady of Tur
key put blusnes and eyes and everybody I
else under cover, that is, aa far as seeing j
anything was concerned, by assuming a j
veil of brocade, seeded with pearls. The
last named may be magnificent, but it sug
gests economy. Think of a girl in a bro
cade veil?
Think of a newly covered sofa! But
wherever the bride is there should be
some kind of a veil, although personally I j
should prefer ttie brocade of the Tursish ;
lady to the black one worn by the Spanish
girl. It may be coquettish, but it cer- i
tainly will bring bad luck. I never could |
fancy a bride without a flesh veil. Even :
down on the Bowery the young woman |
who hires a white satin gown not quite
new, orange blossoms that have been used (
before, gets a new veil by paying a little i
extra.
You and I are inclined to scoff at the
girl who hires her white satin wedding i
frock. There is a good bit more sense in
that, however, than in getting one after !
the fashion ot Miss Shabby Genteel. She J
has very little money and an immense â 
capacity for getting into debt. She reads i
of the gorgeous wedding frocfee worn oy >
women who have millions of their own and '
who wed millions; then she elects to wear â 
a frock as near like that of Miss Bullion
aa she can; so, instead of putting her
money in a neat little walking suit that !
will be of use to her afterward, she buys
a cheap, cotton back satin, lines it with
canton flannel, gets a gorgeous tiara of ;
orange blossoms, a superb veil, white kid
gloves, white siik stockings and white
satin slippers, and the consequence is, in a
month's time, Miss Shabby Genteel has i
nothing to wear. She is not invited to
houses where white satin is the rule, and
in time she realizes exactly how foolish
she has been, while she has the doubtful
pleasure of wearing her old frocks and
weeping over her folly. Of course, a wed- i
dins frock can always be cut to advantage j
to make a baby's cloak, but â well, some
people are sentimental.
During the days of good Queen Anne it '
was the thing for a lady never to be quite
well. Although the ladies of those (lavs !
drank and ate until they hid their hefy
cheeks, not to mention noses, under pow- :
der and rouee galore, still health was !
counted a vulgar blessing, and those of
the court never confessed to possessing it. i
I only wonder one thing, and that is, how
did the men behave in those days, or !
have they changed, or were they particu
larly angelic during the reign of the good j
Queen Anne? I think they must nave '
been, or else the ladies of the era would j
not have had so much pleasure in being ,
not quite well. Nowadays if a woman is i
ill, unless she is staring death in the face, ''<
the average man regards it as a personal
Insult
He flies from illness as he might from
an invading army, and he is a great deal j
more afraid of a bad headache or a fever '
than he is of one of those new guns that I
shoot a million people ai once. "When he j
asks how are you it is in an aggrieved tone â 
impossible to describe, and if you happen
to have enough strength left to argueVht
tle, and mention to him that you think it
strange he did not send a you a few flowers,
or some dainties, he remarks: "Oh, well, j
if you were really dying I would probably !
care a great deal abjut it all because, of '
course, I am really very fond of you, but j
wh*n you are only a liule bit sick, well, it '
seems so unnecessary, and 1 would rather
not be around. Then, too, why didn't you
ask for what you wanted?"
From the standpoint of the Coroner, we
die once in our lives. But a woman dies a
hundred deaths from headache and heart
ache, and rheumatism and diseases that
verge on pneumonia, but don't quite reach
it, and everything else that is unpleasant
and not dangerous. And these occasional
deaths are the ones when she would like
to have a little thought given to her
When she is absolutely dying she don't
care. She is not troubling herself about
men, then.
It is while she is living that sho would
like to be remembered; when she is under
the weather, as were those ladies in the
days of good Queen Anne, when, perhaps
morais.were not quite as gool as they are
now, but manners were a great deal oetter
History tells us that during those daya the I
Duchess of Marlborough frequently had
straw laid in front 01 her house so that
she might not hear the carriages co by
when the had the headache; and that
once when she was -near a garrison, she !
asked that the morning and evening shoot- t
ing be stopped, as it hurt her head And '
it was stopped I would like to know just
a few things Do you think the Stock Ex
change would stop its hullabailoo because
some woman had the headache? Do you
think that the abominable express- wa ons
would stop running at night because some
other woman had the h artache? Or do
you think a man would stop a garaeof bil- !
hards because some woman had a wretched j
cough and was nervms? There is noth- !
lngquneasexasreratintrtoanybociy who is I
keptawaue uy illm-ss a~s the sound of a
came of billiards. Next to it, in order,
comes the noise made by a man who is
practicing a horn that is to be attached to :
a four-in-hand in the early June daysâ
both horn and man. I mean. I don't think
anything, generalizing, wouid stop be- ;
cause a woman was ill. Ami yet it ought
to. Most of us women try pretty hard to !
keep well, and we started handicapped be- I
ing women.
Away olf in the East, in one of the won- â¢
Lderrul countries that Moore wrote about. |
there was a beautiful maiden who loved an
equally handsome youth, who was below
her in'rank, inasmuch as she was a prin
cess. And every day her favorite fox ter
rier went to him with a message of love,
and every day he came back with another
message of love. Now, one of the queer
Eastern gods was her father, and lie had
determined to wed ncr to a great king;
but she refused and said she would only
marry the man she loved. And she sent
word by the little fox terrier to her lover
that she would die for his sake, but that
she would never become the wife of another
man.
And the lover whispered somethiper to
the little fox terrier and hid a quaint littie
bottle in the collar of jewels that was
about his neck. That same day the prin
cess heard that a beautiful youth, who
was of no standing, had been found dead on
the street. Then she permitted her maids to
dress her for her wedding. And the littie
dog astced her if she were going to be un
faithful; and she looked at him as dogs
Icok at women nowadays. When they
fetched her into the temple in all her
bridal finery and left her alone to pray
she took from one of the gorgeous jeweled
pockets that swung at her side the little
bottle that her lover had sent her, and she
swallowed Us contents.
They came to look for the bride, but
they found a dead maiden, while beside
her was a little dog crying as if his heart
would break. And her wicked father
called a curse on him, and said that, from
that day on until the end of tne world no
dog should speak except through his eyes.
And if you have a bit of doubt about this
story, you need only, some day when you
are in trouble, and a little dog who is fond
of you and whom you love is near yon,
look at him and he will say all
that a friend couid say, but it will
be with his eyes. True? Of course it is
true. If you have any doubt at all about
it â that is, any further doubt â you need
only go to a small villasze 400 miles from
Calcutta and the truth will be sworn to by
several priests in the temple there. And
when the clergy swear to anything it must
be true. Even truer than when womrn
announce certain facts as truths. But this
is enough about dogs. Let us return to
women. Bab.

NEW YORK, N. V.. April lg.â firmer tone
characterized the trading at the Stock Exchange
to-day. It appears that on yesterday two promi
nent traders concluded to take profits ana fully
80,000 shares of various stocks, including sugar
and the grangers, were thrown overboard. The stock
was well taken, however, and to-day when the
bears discovered that there was no additional stock
pressing on the market, they changed front and
managed to cover. Sugar was the special feature
of the trading, moving up tol2sVs; Washlnzton
houses and brokers connected with refilling inter
ests bought the stock. Tobacco jumped irotn 615/9
to 72Â®71, recent short sellers being conspicuous
buyers. .

ed up from 157 to UOVi on intimation! that there
will be no unfavorable legislation at Albany this

higher, the common r.aing to 14 and the preferred

STICKY PLY PAPER.
Most of the Supply Manufactured in
Secret In Michigan.
The world's supply of sticky fly paper
comes from this city, says the Grand
Rapids (Mich.) correspondent of the New
York Sun. There are three or four other
small factories scattered about the coun
try, but none of them makes enough to cut
much of a figure in the market. The great
producer is the single factory in this city,
a big concern employing 400 to 600 hands
all the year round, and its product is
shipped to every land.
The factory is surrounded by a high board
piclset fence, and guards are on watch day
and night to keep out intruders. The best
friends of the proprietors meet with as
cold a reception, when the matter of going
into the factory is mentioned, as any
stranger. The sticky preparation with
which it is expected the flies will form
entangling alliances is prepared by the
proprietors personally, and they alone
know the exact formula. The prep
aration iB not patented nor copyrighted,
as to gain the protection of the
Government it would be necessary
to reveal the materials that go into it, and
thus make the formula known to the world
and give trade pirates a chance to operate.
The secret is protected by not letting it
out, and it has been kept successfully for
nearly twenty years. The machinery used
in the factory is guarded in the same man
ner against infringement instead of being
patented. Most of the machinery was de
signed for the special purpose to which it
is put, and the four brothers engaged in the
business made the designs for it them
selves, and had different parts of it con
structed at different machine-shops. The
fly-paper factory occupies four large two
story brick buildings, and the employes in
one department are not allowed, under
any circumstances, to visit any other de
partment. None but trustworthy men
are employed, and once engaged they have
substantially a life job, but even the most
trusted is not allowed to know more than
one branch of the business.
The fly paper is made by spreading cer
tain balsams and gums on a sheet of sized
manilla paper. The sheet has a narrow
border of wax to prevent the sticky stuff
from oozing out. The border of wax is
put on, the sticky preparation is spread
and the sheet is folded neatly for inspec
tion and shipment by one machine, and
this machine nas a capacity of about 50,
--000 sheets a day. From the machine the
sheets pass to inspectors, who see that the
stuff is of the right consistency, and then
to the packers, to be put into boxes for
shipment. The paper goes to Africa, Asia.
Europe, Australia and South America,
besides all parts of this country.
The manufacturers of the sticky paper
began business about twenty years ago on
a small scale, occupying a lean-to in con
nection with a suburban drugstore wbicn
the brothers had established as a brach of
their city business. One ?of the brothers
carried on the fly paper manufacturing as
a side issue, and at nrst only enough was
manufactured to supply a limited local de
mand. The demand gradually grew and
the factory is now one one of the big insti
tutions of the city ani the four brothers all
devote to it their entire time.
Some time ago the brothers had occasion
to discharge one of their employes, a man
who had been with them several years, and
had unusual facilities for learning the in
side of how everything was done. It was
suspected that it was his intention to sell
the secrets of the manufacture of fly paper,
or such of them as he possessed, to a rival
manufacturer- doing business on a small
scale in an^fUer town. The brothers im
mediately br%ight suit against him by in
junction to restrain him from telling what
he knew, and from himself engaging in the
business. The suit has not : yet been de
cided. | ItinvolveÃ a question of law never
yet adjudicated in this State, and one that
is specially, interesting to manufacturers
and attorneys.

THE WILMERDING SCHOOL
The Aged Capitalist Intended It
to Be Erected in This
City.
Three Reputable Citizens Tell What
Was Contemplated When the
Will Was Made.
Since the Board of Regents has had
under consideration the establishment of
the VVilmerdinÃ School of Arts there has
been much speculation as to the wishes of
the late J. C. Wilmerding when he by his
will provided for the school. The ques
tion of where the donor intended the col
lege to be erected ha 3 been caused by the
recent claims of several communities for
the establishment of the school in their
midst, as against the claim of San Fran
cisco, Mr. Vilmerdine's home. Through
the efforts of J. R. Freud of the Mer
chants' Association it is now conclusive
that the intention was that the sch|ol
should be in this City, and nowhere else.
â¢ E. J. McCutche|Â£}^ie. attorney who drew
up the WilmexdiiÃVwill, states : that the
only reason that fsah' Francisco was not
specilied was thatflAwas so well under
stood that the soh^Hftaa to be built here
that its est *ytf^sPgi elsewhere never
entered Mru2l^HMÂ«MnÂ» mind. William

" To ihf Merchants' .â f^BtÃkiâiiv.s'ii.r.^t-s:
When Mr. WilmeriUnMflUll-'onci decided to
provide funds for thwÃist>lishment and en
dowment of the. school he'set jtbout the work
in a .systematic way. Rjecogniiing that such
an undertaking was new to hiinV hÂ«- applied to
others who were able to fUrirtslivthe details of
it. The fourtdingof the school> was firÃt suir
gested to. him Mr. William\ Alvord, >vno
wrote a number of letters- giving valuable
hints concerning the .site, the arrangements
and costs of the birildin*s;.etc. In one of the
letters occurred the. : 3>hrase. "f believe the
Potrero would be the^rontr location." j This
was read to Mr. WilmifM*!',- and after some
reflection he saidj/HpHÃ^Bjcht; the Potrero
is the place for H.'***re!yÃMgii, little, yet his
emphatic manner of snydÃJ Bftefi little room
for doubt about his fli>]>rrTvflÃ^BÃu. site -
On further eohsideratioiiWHPrrived at the
conclusion that as the Re&enn?Tff,the Univer
sity were to be the custodians* of the fund it
would be proper to leave all details of the con
structionof the buildings tp r their judgment
After that" no more 'investigations along that
line were made. It is a matter of <rejjret now
that the many casual remarks Mr. WNmerdine
made on. the subject were hot recorded, but it
it certain that they left no impression that he
had . any. idea ; that ; the school might be estab
lished . outside- the limits of San ' Francisco
County. ; His comment., on Mr. Alvord's sng
gestion of | fhe Potrero looks like strong affirma
tive evidence, does it not?. = ;i Â - -
The first hint thnt the school might be estab
lished outside the limits of San Francisco was
a genuine surprise to those who were near Mr'
Wilmetding all through the time he had the
subject underconsideratiou. .The Regents of
the University I having the weight of the re
sponsibility resting ; npon them are entitled to
much â  â¢ consideration. _â  They , should be :. in

tion to the clauses in nis will. Respectfully
yours. Thomas J. Lamb.
William Alvord sent to the association a
letter of similar character. Mr. Freud, in
speaking of the will, states that under the
law when the wishes of a deceased are not
clearly expressed in a will, his known
wishes, attested by competent and reliable
witnesses, are given about the same con
sideration by the court as though the
wishes were* expressed in writing. In
view of this new evidence bearing upon
the millionaire's wishes, it is not at all
likely that the school will be established
outside of San Francisco.
HOMELESS CHILDREN.
Reception to Interest the People in the
Welfare of the Little
Ones.
The ladies who have charge of the San
Francisco Nursery for Homeless Children
at 570 Harrison street 3'esterday held a re
ception to friends of the institution. The
object of the reception was to interest the
people in the home and its wards, who
are now seventy in number. The eldest of
these are 12 and there are seventeen under
3 years of age. The visitors were enthusi
astic in their commendation of the bright,
cleanly appearance of the children, and
the homelike appearance of the institu
tion was favorably commented upon.
An interesting programme was enacted
in the kindergarten room as follows:
Vocal solo, Miss Wagner; recitation, Miss
Beveridge: "Shining Star" Japanese drill,
Misses E. Catherine LusÂ«. Marguerite
Larzelere, E. Josephine Larzeiere. Cbar-
Jotte E. Parks, Ellen Stone, Isabel Lervin,
Millie Redeli, Sadie Phillips, Eva E. Jef
fery and Carrie W. Morris; games and
songs, nursery children; vocal solo, Miss
Anita Taggard ; vocal solo. Miss belle
Scotchler; recitation, Mrs. Langsboth.
The institution is comparatively young
and the ladies hope by interesting people
in the children to enlarge their subscrip
tion list.

addition was made to the collection yesterday
in the shape of a large exhibit of minerals
from the State Mining Bureau. These were
arranged in large showcases by Secretary Dur
den of the Mining Bureau. The several coun
ties are sending in large collections of exhibits
of their localities. Several large cases of ex
hibits were received yesterday from Los Ange
les County.

SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY
It Will Put a Municipal Ticket
Into the Field This
Year.
WILL ORGANIZE THE STATE
The Rapid Growth of the Organization
Within the Past Four or
Five Years.
The Socialist Labor party is making
active preparations to put a ticket in the
field during the coming campaign. Not
only is it their purpose to enter into local
politics, but they will get out and work in
all parts of the .State. This is a part of the
plan for eventually taking a band in Na
tional politics.
At the last Presidential election the So
cialists polled 18,000 votes in New York
and Massachusetts for Mr. Wins;, the can
didate for President of the United States.
There are at present in SBn Francisco six
i branches of the party, two American, Ger
man, .trench. Jewish and Italion. There
was a project to organize an Irish-Ameri
can branch, but it was found undesirable
to have too many branches speaking the
same language. It is the wish to do away
with the "language" branches as' fast as
possible, and consolidate all in one broth
erhood as soon as all are able to express
themselves in the prevailing language.
These branches have been selecting the
members of the State executive commit
tee, and on next Tuesday night these re
turns will be made at the Temple at 115
Turk street. This section will at once
take in hand the work of organizing the
State. In all probability E. T. Kingsley
will be the State organizer, he being the
only nominee for the position named so
far.
In this city the first work will be to
organize in the Assembly districts, begin
ning first in the Twenty-ninth and Thir-
socialist Labor Party s Vignette ana
Button.
tieth districts. These are selected for the
first work because the Socialist element is
the most numerous among the working
classes of those districts.
The work will be pursued into all of
the districts in San Francisco. The next
movement thereafter will ba the circula
tion of a petition for recognition as a
party, the socialists never having had such
recognition here before. Mr. Kingsley, in
discussing the situation, stated that there
will be no trouble whatever to secure
names to a petition for party recognition,
as the branches' membership roll shows
more names than sufficient for the desired
purpose.
While this work is in progress the or
ganization of the State will be in progress.
There are now chartered sections in San
Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Los Angeles,
San Diego, and the section in Santa Cruz
will receive its charter as soon as the State
executive committee assembles. The so
cialists in Los Angeles are preparing to
enter municipal politics this year and put
up a ticKut of candidates for the city
officers.
The State organizer will probably begin
to work in Sacramento, and after starting
the ball rolling there will visit Stockton
for the same purpose. It is more than
likely that socialist tickets will be put out
in several of the California cities named.
The vignette that will appear on all of
their tickets will be the mechanics' arm
and uplifted hammer. This was adopted
at the last socialist convention held in
New York and has been generally ac
cepted by all of the socialists in the United
States. "Many in this City are now wear
ing the button of the party. A week or so
ago a lot of these buttons were received in
this City and are now extensively worn.
They groundwork is in red enamel and
the arm and hammer are in blacK and
white. At the bottom are the letters S. L.
P., in white enamel.
The National Convention of the Social
ist Labor party will be held in New York
on next July 4. There was not a dissenting
voice as to the selection of that date. At
that convention candidates for tlie posi
tions of President and Vice-President of
the United States will bo nominated.
Delegates to the National Convention will
be sent from nearly every State in the
Union. Four years ago the socialist rep
resentation was confined to the New Eng
land and Middle States. Reports state
that the party is spreading out, particu
larly in the Southern States. Large num
bers have been recently converted to the
doctrines of socialism in Texas, Colorado
and ttoe Northwestern States.
SUICIDE OF JOHN MOTH
Despondent Over Business Re
verses, He Fatally Shoots
Himself.
Was at One Ttme the Agent of a
Large Milwaukee Brewing
Concern.
John Muth, at one time Pacific Coast
agent of the Schlitz Malt Extract, com
mitted suicide by shooting in tne park
yesterday. He was despondent over his
financial affairs, and took this means of
ending his earthly troubles.
The body was found by Thomas Monroe,
foreman in the park, who was attracted to
the scene of the shooting by the report of
the pistol. He found the body reclining
on a bench, with the head thrown back,
near the Haight-street entrance of the
park. Blood flowed from a wound in the
right temple. The man was dead,
Foreman Monroe telephoned to the
Morgue, and Deputy Coronfr O'Brien had
the body removed. An inquest will be
held. Letters were found in the pockets
of the dead man's clothing showing that
he was financially embarrassed. He had
been trying to raise money for several
months, but his efforts in this direction
were unsuccessful. He had difficulty with
his partner in business, and some tirbe ago
a dissolution of the agency resulted. Since
that time Muth went from bad to worse.
So he determined to take his life, and with
that intention he purchased a new pistol
yesterday morning and repaired to the
spot in the park where the deed was con
summated. He lived at 640 Golden Gate
avenue.
The deceased has a brother living in Los
Angtles. He was a native of Germany
and about 38 years of age.
LOOKS LIKE PERSECUTION
George W. Simpson, Locksmith,
Arrested on Complaint of
a Neighbor.
RELEASED BT JUDGE SLACK.
Simpson Says His Neighbors Want
Him Oui of the Way to Tear
His House Down.
The question of whether George W.
Simpson is insane and a dangerous person
to be Â£.t large will be determined by the
Insanity Commissioners to-morrow.
"Yesterday morning Louis Helbing, 529
Frederick street, went before Judi*e Heb
bard and swore out a warrant for Simp
son's arrest on the ground of insanity.
The warrant was handed to Policeman
Durkin, who placed Simpson under ar
rest and had him taken to the City Prison
and then to the Receiving Hospital in the
patrol wagon.
Simpson is a locksmith, aud lives in an
old shanty at 613 Shrader street. The
property is owned by George J. Hobe, sec
retary of the Odd Fellows' Cemetery As
sociation, and Simpson has occupied the
building for many years.
The surrounding buildings are all hand
some family residences, and for years the
owners have been endeavoring to get
Simpson away from the neighborhood, as
the shanty was an eyesore to them. They
have dumped their garbage in his lot and
have done other things to drive him away,
but he has refused to be driven.
Two weeks ago last Wednesday Simpson
had Policeman Moran, whose beat is in
that neighborhood, before the Police Com
missioners for neglect of duty. He had
subpenaed about fifty witnesses, men and
women, to testify against the policeman,
but after the Commissioners had listened
to the evidence of about half a dozen they
dismissed the case, President Tobin re
marking that it was the most frivolous
ever brought before the board. When the
waiting witnesses were notified of the re
sult they broke into cheers, and Simpson
aid not show his face among them, but
waited till they had all left the City Hall.
Yesterday afternoon when taken to the
hospital Simpson declared his arrest was
an outrage. "It is done," he vehemently
declared, "to get me out of the way so
that they can tear down my building.
"When I went home after the meeting
of the Police Commissioners they had
broken my windows, pulled down my
chimney and had a rope round my build
ing to pull it down.
'â They want to get me out of there be
cause they can't get a connecting sewer
through my lot, and they want to make it
a short cut for their own convenience.
"This man Helbing's property abuts on
mine and that is why he wants to get me
out of the way on this charge. I am no
I more insane than he. I have lived in this
City over forty years and have reared a
family of five children, and this is the first
time I have been charged with insanity.
There never was insanity in my people
and it ? s a gross outrage to have me ar
rested.
"I will have this man Helbing arrested
for false arrest and will make him suffer
for this. Ho is the man who got six
months for stealing water from the Spring
Valley Water WorKs. He gave out that
he had discovered an artesian well on his
property and for weeks supplied the peo
ple with water till it was discovered he
was tapping the mains of the water com
pany.
When told that he would have to be de
tained in the hospital till taken before the
Insanity Commissioners to-morrow morn
ing, he raised his hands and saiu : "My
God, what, shall I do? They will tear my
house down as sure as I am a living man.
Can nothing be done to get me out of this?
I can give substantial bonds for my ap
pearance on Monday. You can see i am
not insane."
The old man's fear for his house was so
real and his appearance was so free from
insanity that Judge Slack was communi
cated with. The Judge went to the hos
pital, and after a brief conversation with
Simpson he wrote out an order for his re
lease.
"Now be sure and be in J udge Hebbard'a
court Monday morning," said the Judge,
"and you will no doubt be released. When
you go home keep quiet and don't pay
any attention to your neighbors if they
seek to annoy you, but ask for police pro
tection."
Simpson left the hospital and laid his
complaint at police headquarters and he
was told that he would be properly pro*
tected,
He Paid the Fine.
George Upeon, the counterfeit lottery ticket
man, was sentenced by Judge Joachimsen yes
terday to pay a fine of $250 or to be impris.
oned in the County Jail for six months. The
fine was paid. Upson was convicted of tha
charge about three years ago and appealed it
and it was only on Thursday that the judg
ment was affirmed by the Superior Court, lie
is now serving a six months' sentence imposed
upon him by Judge Low.
