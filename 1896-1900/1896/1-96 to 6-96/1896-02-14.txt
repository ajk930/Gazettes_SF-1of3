ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb. 13.â |
A disDatch from Irkutsk, Siberia, says
' that a Siberian trader named Koachlaeroff,
j who is acting in the capacity of agent for \
Dr. Nansen, ' the Arctic explorer, has j
stated that off Kolymsk he received in- |
formation that Nansen had reached the
north pole, where he found land, and is
now on his way back.
When Nansen sailed on his voyage it
was with the intention of devoting five j
years to it if necessary. His vessel (the
Pratt) was peculiarly constructed, so as â 
to resist the pressure of the ice, and fully
provisioned for five years. His intention j
was to penetrate the ice as far as possible i
and then let it carry him north.
Dr. Frithjof Nansen, who has gained j
fame as an Arctic explorer, is about 35 |
years of age. He was formerly keeper of |
the Natural History Museum of Ber- j
gen, Norway. He acquired his Arctic !
experience in Greenland. Nordens- I
kjold had started a theory that the in- i
terior of Greenland had a mild climate, '
and that probably the survivors of the I
settlers from Iceland would be found j
living there. To determine this ques- i
tion Dr. Nanseiv,accompanied by three Nor
wegians and two Laplanders, started from |
â¢ Iceland in June, 1833. After terrible hard
ships, in some places . finding a tempera
ture 80 or 90 degress .below zero, they suc
ceeded in crossing Greenland and reached
the western coast in September. j They
were obliged to remain in Greenland all
winter.
LONDON, En.*,., Feb. 13.â Relatives of,
lir. Nansen have circulated a statement !
that they do trot attach* much credence to I r
the report of Koachlaeroff. â¢'_â¢'â â -. 7

RECEIVED WITH IXCRETtVLItT.
Melville and Greely Say There Can Re
. X'o Truth in the Report.
-WASHINGTON,- D. C, Feb. 13.-The
story coming from Russia to the effect that
Nansen, â  the explorer, has discovered and
.landed on the north pole and is now. on
his way home is received here with abso
lute incredulity by two persons who, of all
others in the United States, are best qual
ified to pass any opinion upon the proba
bility of tne statement, namely, Commo
dore Melville of the navy and General
Greely of the army. " Commodore Mel
ville said to The Call correspondent that
he was particularly confident the story was
without a reasonable foundation.
â¢ "The Fram," said he, "entered the Arc
tic to the north and east of Nova Zembla,
with the intention of forcing her waylo the
eastward to the vicinity of Bennett Island, j
â¢which is south of where the .leannette I
was crushed in the ice. - As the Jeannette j
had made 1300 miles in a northerly direc- j
tion, Nansen had an idea that if he could
get into the same current it would carry
him to the -pole. This, to my mind, is i
impossible. There is an ice-cap at the I
pole extending to the vicinity of the I
eighty-fifth degree of north latitude.
Soundings, currents and all of the ob
served phenomena of the Arctic region
assure us of this fact. â â¢
"If ; the Fram should have managed to
-get as far east and north as Bennet Island,
and so was seized by the current which i
The San Francisco Call.
carried the Jeannette, the probabilities are,
if the shin was not crushed and sunk by
the ice, as was the Jeannette, and the pro
visions held out', that "she would drift out
into the Atlantic Ocean between Franz
Joseph Land and Nova Zembla. If, how
ever, there should be a 'channel north of
Franz "Joseph; Land and between it and the
ice-cap mentioned, it is possible that the
ship may have drifted through it to the
northward of -Spitsbergen and got into a
drift coming south along the east coast of
Greenland. If beset iD ice there she may
have turned the cape and drifted around
to the west coast of Greenland, eventually
to be cast out into Baffins Bay and drift
southward. These are the results which
300 years of exploration and observation
Indicate may be" expected as the ending of
the attempt made by the Fram."
General Greely called attention to the
fact that the dispatch announcing^ Nan
sen's success did not state where he was
when heard from, and this he regarded as
a suspicious circumstance. It would have
been easy when telegraphing the reported
discovery of the pole to have stated just
where Nansen was when this trader heard
Irom him. ';.>'*â¢ 7 â '- V* 'i
"As a matter of fact." said General
Greely, ."nothing authentic has been
heard from the explorer since his depart
ure from civilization, It was expected
that he would touch at New Siberia Isl
ands on his way around, to take jon extra
orovisions and dogs for his sleds. Several
parties had .touched at the islands during
the past two or three years, however, and
they had found no evidence : that Nansen
had been there." i Â»^ : ;7 7r
General Greely has gone on record as*
condemning the theory upon which Nan
sen's expedition was founded and, like
Commodore Melville, he believes the
project impracticable. According to Gen
eral Greely, Nansen held that by getting
into the Jeannecte's current he "would be
carried north to the pole* and then across it
south into warmer waters again. Nansen
based his belief upon the existence of such
a current on the finding of what were
claimed to be relics of the Jeannette expe
dition which had been found on the
Greenland coast, and on the theory he
conceived based upoD the direction of
the currents and wind. New, according to
General Greely, the supposed relics of the
Jeannette have never been authenticated
as such, although it would have been easy
to do so. Upon this flimsy foundation,
said General Greely, the Fram expedition
started. He said he did not believe that
it has got to the pole, but, in view of the
time since tne party started, he believes
that it has perished or is in great peril.
The Norwegian Government evidently
takes the same view, he said, for it has
projected an expedition to go to Nartsen's
relief, though no one can suggest the point
where a relief expedition should be sent.

Lieutenant Peart/ Hoes Sot Fully Be
â  lieve the Report.
NEW YORK, N. V., ! Feb. 13. -When
Lieutenant Peary was' seen* to-night" and
asked whether -in his judgment any
: reliance was A- to be placed '"/â  on
the report that Dr. .Nansen \ had
reached the north pole and is now return
ing, he pramptly replied' that what - with
the in eagerness of *' the dispatch, the local
ity from which , the news comes r and ; the
season, it does not seem to him as likely to
be authentic. " AA'A ; V : " ' ' '
Dr. Nansen, if his theory in regard to
the current be correct. Lieutenant Peary
says, would not be likely to ever get back
in that direction. He expected to cross
the pole and come out somewhere on the
east coast of Greenland.'
If Nansen or any of his party is where
it is said he is, the lieutenant thought the
message should come direct from him.

;. "I hardly know what to think of this
strance intelligence,"- remarked Professor
Davidson when the story of Nan sen's sup
posed discovery was mentioned to him.
"Somehow or other 1 cannot .disabuse my
mind of the suspicion that the thing is un
deserving of belief. If Nansen could com
municate with his agent at the mouth of
the Lena, w-tiy should the agent be the
first to let the scientific world know of so
important a matter ? If Nansen j really
sent a message to the effect that he had
discovered the long-sought north pole,
surely he would make; an authoritative
statement as soon as he were able to com
municate with his" fellow-men. In such
an event Nansen's agent might. naturally
be employed as the transmitter of the in
telligence,* but it seems incredible that
the agent should be allowed to figure be

fore mankind as the source of the informa
tion. 7. - -,- _ . ,
"Regarding the truth of the report,"
continued the venerable savant, "I prefer
to suspend my judgment, for the present.
If the story is true we will have evidence
of it before long, and then we can afford
to believe it. There is no hurry. As to
the fact itself I am far from believing it
beyond the range of possibility. '. Nansen's
plan was ingenious, to say the least. He
relied upon the current supposed to de
scend through Baffins Straits. It was, I
believe, his original intention to pass
through Bering Straits to the northward,
allow his vessel to become embedded in
an icefloe, and drift with the current across
the pole in case there should be no land
there, emerging from the Polar Sea by way
of Baffins Straits. ' :
"However, according to this report
Nansen has taken a widely variant course.
Sailing easterly along the northern coasts
of Siberia he would. strike the northbound
current from Bering. Straits and, accord
ing to his hypothesis, pass over the pole
and leave the Arctic Ocean through Baf
fins Straits, as I said before. He would;
not, in fact, could not navigate, strictly
speaking, seeing that his vessel, imbedded
in perhaps thousands of tons cf ice, would
be able to drift. only. How, then, can ;we
believe that he could, after* making his
discovery, return to the Siberian coast and
acquaint his agent with the facts, retiring
immediately ' into the mysterious back
ground and allowing the agent to publish
the discovery to the world? There is a
hole in the saucepan somewhere. . .. â¢
"The route . through Bering and Baffins
Straits, was the: one which the ill-fated
Jeannette would have followed. The fact
of the current's existence seems irrefuta
ble in view of the relics of the Jeannette
which found their ..' way to the coast of
Greenland. Among these relics, by the
way, were some which would have been of
great interest to .us. Some articles of
clothing made, in Sau Francisco and a
bankbook issued by one of the San Fran
cisco banking-houses were a part of the
important find.
"All the relics washed ashore in Green
land, so far as known, were sent to Chris
tiania, where they formed a part of a eeo
graphicai society's collection.
"The Geographical Society of the Pacific
naturally desired to , gain possession of
those relics having a special interest for
Californians. Considerable correspondence
between the two societies took place with
out any satisfactory answer. |At length,
about eighteen months ago, Mr. Lund, the
Swedish and.' Norwegian Consul,' paid a
visit, to his home and while there made
inquiries as to the Jeannette relics. - The
result of his inquiries was; enough ;to dis
gust any man living. ; The Christiariia so
ciety, it appeared, had boxed the relics in
three chests, which were placed in the
charge of one of ; the organization's mem
bers. ; This man, who was a bachelor, with
no immediate relatives, died shortly after
ward, and his heirs r took charge of his
effects. ,'â "*' â..',....' .â â¢'â¢-â¢\.. .v
; "The relics being considered as merely a
lot of rubbish and ? old i clothes were carted
off j with the j household debris and lost to
the scientific world forever.
"I I have only, this to say about these
north pole expeditions," said j the : -, pro
fessor in conclusion. "It seems as though
explorers would do better to give up look
ing for the : astronomic ' pole beyond the
polar ocean and ; try to find the magnetic
pole to the northwest of Hudson Bay.
That would be discovery of incalculable
importance,, ( and there ,is at least some
chance of its realization." â ./ ./ '

POOR PROSPECT OF A BATTLE.
Many Who Went. to Attend the Fistic
Carnival Are Leaving El Paso
in Disgust.
; EL PASO, Tex., Feb. l 13.â Robert Fitz- 1
Simmons and Peter 'Maher will not battle
in a " prize-ring to-morrow morning. To
night it is confidently asserted by many
of the downcast sports that the proposed
"mills" are off for; good. This condition
of affairs is not due -to the efforts of : the
Federal, State and Mexican authorities. to
prevent the two men from coming to
gether, or to any inability on the part of
Dan Stuart to guarantee a safe battle-'
ground, but solely to the fact that Maher
is suffering from a temporary affliction of
the eyes that would make it impossible for
him to put up a decent showing in the
ring. ' '" '
About a week ago, while taking a morn
ing spin at Las Cruces in a brisk wind,
several particles of sand were blown into
Maher's left eye, and later in the day while â¢
kicking a football a quantity of dust was
knocked into the same member. The next
day inflammation set in and the services of
a local doctor were called into requizition.
The trouble, however, was obstinate ; and
refused to yield to treatment and a couple
of days ; since ; the right eye j also became
affected. Visitors to the training quar
ters from Sunday to Tuesday .-'; noticed 1 the
trouble and regarded it as of so trifling â 'a
nature \ that [ nothing was thought or said
of the matter until to-day when word was
received that the Irishman was in al bad
shape and that a fight to-morrow was next
door to an impossibility. â¢ â â -
.A- Telegrams were at ; once sent to Las
Cruces urging him 'to -come to the city by
the ;-' first train. The regular daily pas
senger train had, however, already passed
the y training-ground, "A and nothing â¢ re
mained but* to wait for the | Silver City
freight and to which ; a * passenger-caboose
is attached. ; This arrived over the Santa
Fe shortly : belore 7 o'clock, and a large
crowd of local and visiting sports gathered
at the depot to see something of the would
be jj champion's f condition for themselves.
In this, "however, they were disappointed,
for Maher, who : was â¢' accompanied : by his
manager, J. J. Quinn, and Pete Lowry left
the train at the smelter, three miles out.
Here a carriage was in waiting, and the
party "; was driven 'â }. to the ; offices in the
Grand ; Central Hotel of Dr. S. T. White,
the leading local oculist. 'â¢â ? :: ;
After a thorough examination Dr. White
came to the conclusion i that: Maher was
suffering ; from an * aggravated 'case 'A of
ophthalmia, caused by alkali dust entering
. within 7 the eyelids, and ; expressed the
opinion that â he could ' not enter the ring
with any prospect of being on equal terms'
with his opponent in the matter of eye
sight at least, i ; *-*i_-',7
â¢ Maher was considerably disheartened by
this opinion," and after â¢ a- conference with
Quinn a message was dispatched to' Juarez
with the 7 request that) Fitzsimmons (arid
Julian come across the river as quickly as
possible. â  â â Â£> Y7.7;..7 -.-.-77
>."â¢ When pressed for a more definite tstate
ment Dr. White said that care Maher
might be able to get into tbe ring in 'three,
days, but that it would be i better to f alio wi
; himself a week. He n prescribed v, a wash of
sulphate of zinc and atropia, and advised
Maher ;to : keep . away from;. the * sunlight.
It would be safer, he added, if he i would
keep his eyes bandaged and . avoid exer.
cise. The party remained in the doctor's
office until Julian : put in an appearance
with the statement that the Australian
had authorized him to make any arrange
ments he might see' fit. Joe Vendig,
Maher's backer, designated Buck Connelly
of Pittsburg as his representative, and the
latter with Julian went into conference
with Dan Stuart at 9 o'clock.
The conference lasted "'â _ for an hour, and
at its conclusion it was announced that
the fight would remain in statu quo until
Monday, pending which ' Julian -would
make no claim for forfeit in behalf of
Fitzsimmons, the latter holding himself
in readiness to fight on Monday or before
and ; agreeing to announce his final de
cision that day if Maher is still disabled.
When the decision was announced Dan
Stuart stated 'that ; he would waive all : his
rights and interests until next summer if
the jj intervening -period was : necessary to
enable Maher to get into 'fit condition*
'; : Maher and Quinn expressed themselves
as Satisfied with the agreement and the
Irishmen said that he was confident of
being Yin shape to. get inside the ropes
Monday. ? The few that saw, him,'.how
ever, were of a' different ; opinion.'. His
eyes are badly swollen, there ! is a continu
ous discharge and the eyeballs are dotted
I with white spots. . 7 ''"â¢*'â ', 'Â .-'.-: â "',,'â¢ :,
The opinion late to-night is that the
fight is off for good and many of the out
of-town, sports are getting . ready for an '
early departure. i No attempt will be made
to bring off i any of . the minor fights until
the big affair is settled, Stuart saying that
such a move, would be impolitic. Maher
will remain here until Monday under the
care of -Dr. White and > will do no more
I training. 7 A.. ,7 -.
. â  Outside of the news from Maher's train
ing quarters there was scarcely anything
during the day to create even ; a ripple of
excitement. , Big \ cards announcing , that ,
tickets we re on sale were posted about the
promoter's headquarters, but the visiting
and local sports were fighting shy, of put
ting up their money in speculation, and
the receipts of cash in exchange for the
cardboards made but a small aggregate. -
The arrivals up â  to . dusk were not , a
twentieth of what had been expected.
The reported delegation of a - couple |of
hundred . from Mexico City and â â¢ inter
mediate points dwindled down to a round
dozen, and the number of eleventh hour
visitors from the . Eastern, Central \ and
Southern States was also- disappointingly
small. V â â¢â 'â ;â¢-';â . '.â .â â¢â¢ Vv^Y^y;
Stuart and his associates, however, took
this phase of the situation philosophically
and told every j inquirer . : that the pro
gramme would ,go on even if there were
but: a hundred ticket-holders at the ring
side. : Fitzsimmons and Julian ' lounged
about the office during the morning and

The squadron of Mexican cavalry that

north and westward, along the boundary
line, two squads having instructions to
keep, well toward the country between
Hatch's' Spur, and Strauss on the Southern
Pacific, where it was supposed yesterday
that the fight would be brought off. ' Each
squad carried sufficient rations for a week,
and was under orders to remain in, the
field until called by' Governor Ahumada.
The latter remained in his office at Juarez,
receiving occasional reports from his lieu
tenants, who were circling about in this
city until dusk, when he crossed the river.
On his way down he dropped into Stuart's
office,' but the promoter was absent and,
with the remark that he had no particular
business to transact, the Mexican execu
tive went his way.
Adjutant-General Mabry of Texas had
little with which to occupy himself during
the day. He contradicted the report that
a detachment of ten rangers went out on
the train this morning that.carried a por
tion of the ring f paraphernalia, but added
that he was satisfied with the assurances
of the managers that no infraction of the
Texas law was intended. As to the story,
that he would co-operate with the Federal
and Mexican authorities and aid in pre
venting the fight on other soil, he said:
"It is not within my province to do any
thing of_. the kind. So long as these men
keep clear of the State line I have nothing
against them. The rangers will accom
pany the train if one should go out, but
their authority will have ended when the

SOON TO RECEIVE ATTENTION.
Pending the Battle on the Repeal the
Senatorial Deadlock , Remains
'Unbroken.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 13-For the
first time during tne session thirty-eight
Senators were present to-day in the joint
assembly. No pairs were announced in
the Senate and only one in the House.
The ballot resulted in no change from yes
terday. The ballot stood: Hunter 64,
Blackburn 63, scattering 9. Necessary to
a choice 69.
The duplicate of the Goebel bill to
repeal the Southern Pacific's char
ter", introduced in the House several days
ago by Steiglitz of Louisville and referred
to the Committee on Corporations, has
brought the matter prominently be
fore the House and members, have
begun ". to read the i masses of liter
ature sent by friends of the bill and
the Huntington people. It was the pur
pose of friends of the measure to have the
bill' discussed before the committee in
order to facilitate the measure when it
passes the Senate. Chairman Freeman
said to The Call correspondent to-night:
"I have not yet called a meeting of tho
committee to consider the bill, but will do
so whenever the parties for or against the
bill desire it. I am not thoroughly ac
quainted with the bill, but the measure
shall have fair and impartial consideration
before my committee."
Friends of the bill in the House claim
the measure is meeting with much favor,
and will pass in that branch. "Huntington
and his . manager have evidently conceded
the fight in the Senate, and have been
taken by complete surprise by the intro
duction in ; the House. .bill-will have

The Capitol, the largest and semi
official daily paper of Frankfort, comes
out this morning in a strong editorial,
evidently drawn by the master hand of
Huntington, against the bill. ' Friends of
the bill have gained such headway that
the only hope of defeating : it will be by
causing delay. _7-';^7-^y'

This Legislature is no exception to 'that
rule, and it is a very fortunate thing that
Senator Goebel and others who
are supdorting him have no di
rect or . indirect interest in â¢ the
repeal of the Southern Pacific Company's
charter, have received no retainer for in

promise of a fat fee contingent upon its

decessors of the session of 188%
which made it legal and possible for
a close corporation of capitalistic cormo
rants to fasten upon the good people of a
large section of our country a system of
thieving monopoly, as they understood it,
saps the very blood of their industry and
their "trade, the calm health of nations,"
and growing more insolent and powerful â¢
year by year through their ill-gotten gainS,
far from being satisfied seeks by the most
nefarious methods, at which long practice
has made them adepts, to virtually perpet
uate the monstrous wrong.
* Were it otherwise the repeal bill would
certainly have strong opposition in some
quarters in retaliation for the action of its
supporters in the matter of the --anti-pool
room" ' bill introduced ' by -Mr. Grazioni,2
representative from Covington, Goebel's
home. This bill, which, as amended,
passed the House by a vote of 71 to 13 aud
is now before the Senate Committee,
allows pooling on the racetracks, but kills
the city poolrooms by making it a felony
to operate them, and imposes a heavy fine
on any person who rents a room to pool
room operators.
The introduction of this bill, which cre
ated much comment all over the State,
but especially in the cities having pool
rooms and racetracks and in the race
horse breeding sections, was due to a faght
between opposition poolrooms in the city
of Covin eton, in which Harvey Myers,
former State Senator from that district,
was attorney for one side and Goebel for
the other. These two men have been
at loggerheads and in their various fac
tional lights their clients have always tak
en an active part, and finally Goebel suc
ceeded in vanquishing Myers in the polit
ical arena. This anti-poolroom bill as first ,
introduced was aimed at the interests of j
Goebel's clients, who are interested in the |
racetrack at Latouia, a short distance out I
of Covington.
The passage of the bill as amended in
the House by such a handsome vote scores
a victory for Goebel, and is an indication
of his power and popularity in the Legisla
ture. He had the backing of the best I
Horse-breeding men all over the State, J
such as Henry C. McDowell, who was I
mentioned as Republican candidate for
Congress against Billy Breckinridge,
Colonel Zeke Clay of Lexington, president
of the Kentucky Racing Association, and
others of like standing, and his success
has made him more favor than enmity,
and that is confined to the city of Coving
ton, and will hurt the repeal bill but little.
Senator Hays must be dissatisfied with
playing the role of watchman for H _nt
ington's interests in the Kentucky Senate,
and intends seeking some higher plane in
the political world for the exercise of his
talents, and with a view of disarming his
future opponents as to his course in the
matter of the repeal bill he has introduced
a bill to protect citizens, public officers
and candidates from "the campaign liar."
The bill provides that the circulator of a
campaign slander be fined $500 and dis
franchised for five years. .
This bill won't do the major as much
good as he doubtless expects. The record
of his work here in the interests of the
Southern Pacific Company is largely a
â¢ matter of record, which will be printed
and circulated by the authority of the law.
With the printed journal of the proceed
ings of this Legislature in his band no
opponent need go to the trouble- of
manufacturing and circulating any slan
ders or lies about the major. His record
will speak for itself.
When the major is for you he is for you,
sure enough, and he never tires in 1 his
work, though he is a little deliberate in
speech and action. Both he and Weissin
ger are so placed on the several committees
as to give them a good chance for work
against the Goebel bill.
Hays is on the committees on Federal
Relations, Library and Public Buildings,
Municipalities and Penitentiary and House
of Reform. Weissinger, besides being on
the Judiciary Committee, is chairman of
that on Kentucky Statutes and a member
of the following others: Constitutional
Amendments, Revenue and Taxation and
Rules. These positions of course carry
with them more or less influence.
THE ORIGINAL DESTROYED.
Only a Copy of the Protest to the Reilly
Bill Found.
SACRAMENTO, Cat.., Feb. 13.â 1t has
been definitely ascertained that Assembly
concurrent resolution" No. 7,' protesting
against the Reilly funding bill, was tele
graphed to Washington on the day of its
passage.
This was done by Governor Budd at the
special request of its framer. Assembly
man Belshaw, who, fearing that it would
not reach its destination in time to
bring any weight to bear before
Congress passed on the fundinz
act in case it took the . ordinary
routine of all bills, took a roueh draft of
the resolution to the Governor personally,
who immediately had it forwarded to Con
gressman J. G. Maguire. paying -the tele
graph tolls out of his contingency fund.
The latter, on February 2, two days after
its receipt, laid it before the House and
the fact that this was done appears in the
Congressional Record of that date.
The; reason that this was sent unofficially
was because the Governor at the time had
no official knowledge of its passage, owing
to; the failure of Chief Clerk Duckworth
or his subordinates to perform their
duty, but it was sent in time, owing to the
earnest solicitation of Belshaw for Con
gressman Maguire to use it in his speech
against the Reilly funding bill.
The fact still remains that the bill was
never officially received at the Governor's
office. Why it was that the matter was
not transmitted as it should have been is
still as much of a mystery as ever.
Mr. Duckworth has denied all responsi
bility and throws the burden of blame
upon the shoulders of his subordinates.
As far as the enrolling clerk, Herbert Kid
der, is concerned there is nothing to show
that he ever saw the document, although
Duckworth mentions him as one of - those
who mieht explain its failure to connect.
"Upon re-examination of the document
found in the vault of the Secretary of
State's office it has been discovered that it
is not the original resolution and should
not be on file among the archives of the
State.
This paper is simply a copy of Assembly
concurrent resolution No. 7, and a close
reading shows that it does not purport to
be anything else.
There is but one explanation, and that is
that the original must have been de
stroyed, and after adjournment of the
Legislature a typewritten copy was made
from the records of the House Journal.

Rut South Carolina Democrats Should
Send Delegates io Chicago.
- WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.-
Senator Tillman of South Carolina has
mailed the following letter in reply to one
he received from a prominent Democrat of
his State, making the suggestion that the
Democracy of South Carolina ignore the
Chicago convention and send its delegates
to the St. Louis convention :
,A. 7 Washington, D. C", Feb. 11, 1896.
Sir:. I have your letter of February 5, and
appreciate very much your kind words of com
mendation. In order to preserve the unity of
the white j Democracy ;of ; South Carolina, we
cannot act your -ugEcstion not to send dele
gates to Chicago. We have already captured
the 'Stale; Democracy. We are the State
Democracy, and we ; must go to Chicago ; pre
pared to. bolt if heed be and- ally ourselves
with the free silver men of the West. ; It would
be a fatal bluuder not to send delegates to the
National Democratic ! Convention, and y would
only be putting , it in the hands of our gold
bug enemies. -If the - National Convention
does not adopt a platform to suit us and put a
man on it above suspicion as to his loyalty, we
can then leave the party, but not before. The
effort of every true friend of silver J and finan
cial reform should, be directed to having our
State Democratic committee' composed solidly
of men of our way of thinking, so as to have it
act as a unit, Benjamin R. Tillman.

i The Urgent Deficiency Appropriation
Bill Taken Up and Items
Argued..
WASHINGTON", D. C, Feb. 13.â
Senate to-day refused, by a vote of 29 to 21,
to take up the House tariff bill, with the
| free-coinage substitute, and that measure
| continues to remain on the Vice-Presi
' dent's desk. The motion had the support
of none but Republicans, the Democrats
voting solidly against it, together with
four Populistsâ Allen of Nebraska, Butler
of North Carolina, Jones of Nevada and
Peffer cf Kansas, and three Renublicana â
Carter of Montana, Dubois of Idaho and
Teller of Colorado.
Trie urgent deficiency bill, carrying ap
propriations to the amount of about
$6,000,000, was passed, and the military ap-
I propriation bill was taken up and is now
j the unfinished business.
The resolution of Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
j calling on the Interior Department for a
' great mass of information touching the
| past history and present status of the
Union Pacific Railroad Company gave rise
; to some discussion and was eventually
I modified so as to instruct the Pacific Rail-
I road Committee'|to furnish the informa
tion; and that committee was also author
ized to examine the witnesses who came
i before it under oathâ condition* being
| insisted upon by Morgan of Alabama, a
| member of the committee, who referred to
j Mr. Huntington by name as one whose
j statements he desired to have made under
the sanctity of an oath.
At another stage of the proceedings the
Pacific railroad problem came up, Petti
grew of South Dakota making a violent
i speech against the reorganization com
' mittee and its plan.
The resolutions on the subject of Cuba
! were taken up finder an agreement made a
I few days previously, but Call of Florida,
who had them in charge, consented to let
them go over for the day.
Among the bills reported from commit
tees and placed on the Senate calendar to
day was one reported from the Judiciary
Committee to withdraw from the Supreme
Court jurisdiction in criminal cases (not
capital) and to confer it upon the Court of
Appeals. 7 7..- .;'
Also one granting to the State of Califor
nia 5 per cent of the net proceeds of the
sales of public lands in that State.
The free ship billâ encourage Amer
ican shipping"â was reported back ad
versely from the Committee on Commerce
and was indefinitely postponed.
' A bill making -'Jackson's birthday" a
legal holiday was introduced by Hill and
referred to the Judiciary Committee.
The resolution declaring Alonzo H.
Stewart of lowa assistant doorkeeper of
the Senate and Bernard W. Layter of Ohio
acting assistant doorkeeper was taken up
and agreed to.
At the request of Daniel (D.) of Virginia,
the House bill to incorporate the National
Society of the Daughters of the American
Revolution â¢ was taken from the calendar
and passed.
The resolution offered yesterday by
Allen â  (Pop.) of Nebraska, requiring the
Secretary of the -Interior to furnish de
| tailed statements in reference to the past
history and present status of the Union
Pacific, the Kansas Pacific and the Sioux
I City and Pacific railroads, was also laid
before the Senate. 7*f"tl*i|pÃiÂ§
Allen was ; informed by Brice that nine
tenths of the information called for in the
j resolution was contained in the report of
I the Senate Railroad Committee last ses
sion; as to the other tenth, neither the
| Secretary of the Interior nor any depart
j ment of the Government could furnish it.
I He suggested that the , resolution be modi
fied so as to instruct the Committee on Pa
cific Railroads to obtain the desired infor
mation.
The resolution was so modified by Allen,
and Morgan, a member of the Committee
on Pacific Railroads, offered an amend
ment authorizing the committee to send
for persons and papers and to administer
oaths, adding that Mr. Huntington and
others were to appear before the commit
tee to-morrow, and he wanted their state
ments on oath. As this amendment, if
adopted, would necessitate the * reference
of the resolution to the Committee on Con
tingent Expenses Morgan withdrew it', and
Allen's resolution as modified by him was
agreed to.
Morgan then offered his proposition as
an amendment resolution, modified so as
to merely. authorize the committee toad
minister oaths. It was agreed to.
Morrill moved that the House tariff bill
be taken up. The motion was defeated.
Ayes 21, noes 29. .
On motion, of Pettigrew (R.) of South
Dakota the House bill granting leave of
absence for one year to homestead settlers
upon the Yankton Indian reservation in
South Dakota was taken from the calendar
and passed, with an amendment extend
ing for one year the time for makiner final
payments on lands in any Indian reserva
tion in South Dakota. 7
The urgent deficiency appropriation bill
was then taken up, the amendment I ap
propriating $230,500 for fees ' and ; ; expenses
of United States Marshals being still under
consideration. After another long discus
sion the j amendment was agreed to, the
remainder of the bill disposed of without
trouble and the bill was passed. , The reso
lutions in relation to- Cuba -were ' to ' have
been taken up after the urgent deficiency
bill, but Call (D.) of Florida consented to
let it go over for the present. -7 ;
7 ; The military. academy appropriation bill
was taken up and Teller (R.) of Colorado,
having charge of it, yielded the floor "to
Pettigrew (R. ) of \ North Dakota, . who ad
dressed the Senate on the resolution intro
duced by him on Tuesday last, directing
the foreclosure of the Government ; lien on
the Union Pacific V railroad. y He opposed
the J reorganization f plan, declaring that
the reorganization committee was entitled
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1896;
| to no consideration whatever, . represent
| ing 7as7 it : did , the heartless ; " and
unscrupulous men . who 7 have been
robbing the Government for a generation.
He applied equally strong '. language to the
j receivers and Government directors of the
I Union Pacific, whom he spoke of as oper
ating in the interest of "this gang of high
waymen, this Boston crowd ;. of highway
men." AHe argued that the Government
should take possession of ; the road, issue
its own bonds, refund to the treasury the
fifty-three millions now due and take up
the floating debt of $12,000,000. He quoted
at some length ; from the minority report
of the United States Pacific Railroad Com
mission (Governor Pattison's report) to
show corrupt management on- the part of
the railroad directors.
"Is not the Republican party directly
responsible for continuing this condition
of things?" Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska
asked. *
"I do not care to furnish campaign ma
terial for the Populist party in Nebraska,"
Pettigrew replied.
"Then you decline to answer?" Allen re
torted. "I infer from your ; remarks that
you are in favcr of the Government taking
possession of the road. Is that correct?"
"Oh, certainly," Pettigrew replied.
"And owning it?" Allen asked.
"I see no possible objection to the Gov
ernment owning this road and operating
it," Pettigrew said.
"I beg to call the Senator's . attention,"
Allen remarked, "to the fact that that is
paternalism and populism according to
Republican definitions."
Pettigrew went on and finished his
speech.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed :
House bill to authorize the leasing of
lands for educational purposes in Arizona
(with an amendment).
House bill to amend the act for the re
lief of the Chippewa Indians in Minnesota.
Senate bill to authorize the change of
name and location of the â  First National
Bank of Sprague, Wash.
Senate, bill appropriating $5000 for the
repair or rebuilding of the public wharf at
Sitka, Alaska.
Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania offered a
resolution, which was agreed to, instruct
ing the Finance Committee to inquire re
specting the alleged invasion of American
markets and the menace offered to Ameri
can manufacturing industries by the prod
ucts of cheap oriental labor and to deter
mine what is the cause of such menace,
and what means should be adopted to pre
vent injury to domestic producers.
After a short executive session the Sen
ate, at 5:10 p. m., adjourned till Monday.
TRUSTS AND COMBINES
Attorney-General Harmon Sends
a Reply to a Resolution of
the Senate.
The Law-Making Powers of Congress
and of the States De
fined.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.âAttor
ney-General Harmon sent to the House
to-day a reply to a resolution of that body
in regard to the enforcement of the laws
against trusts, combines, etc. 'â  i; 7;
Replying to the first part of the inquiry
Attorney-General Harmon says that many
complaints have been made against alleged
j trusts, combines, and monopolies, which,
in so far as they relate io matters within
the jurisdiction of the Federal Govern
ment,' he has endeavored to investigate.
In reply to the question as to what leg
islation is needed to protect the people, he
says this is a question of general policy
and not one of law, which, therefore, does
not pertain to his department. Assuming,
however, that Congress desires him to
point out such defects in the present law
as experience has shown, he submits the
following suggestions:
"The act of July, 1890, known as the
Sherman anti-trust law, as construed by
the Supreme Court, does not apply to the
most complete monopolies acquired by
the unlawful comoination of concerns
which are naturally competitive; though
they, in fact, control the markets of the
entire country, if engaging in interstate
commerce, this is merely an incident of
their business and not its direct and im
mediate object. The virtual effect of this
is to exclude from the operation of the law
manufacturers and producers of every
class, and probably importers also.
"As a matter of fact, no attempt to
secure monopoly or restrain trade and
commerce could possibly succeed without
extending itself largely, if not entirely,
over the country. ;So that while engaging
in interstate commerce may not be the
direct or immediate object, it is a neces
sary step in all such undertakings/ While
Congress has no authority in the matter,
except what is derived from its power to
regulate ".* commerce, the States alone
having; general power to prevent and
punish such commercial combinations or
conspiraciesâ may make it un
lawful to ship from one State to another
in carrying out or attempting to carry out
the designs of such organization articles
produced, owned or controlled by them or
any of their members or asents.
"The limitation of the present law
enables those engaged in such attempts to
escape from both State and Federal Gov
ernment â the l former having no authority
over the interstate commerce, and the lat
ter having authority over nothing else.
By supplementing State action in the way
suggested . Congress can â  accomplish the
proposed object of the present law."
Attorney-General Harmon refers to the
rulings of the courts, the result of which
has been in great doubt and uncertainty,
and the failure of the law to . accomplish
its purpose, and says : that the law should
be amended so as to leave no doubt about
what is ; meant by "monopolies," by at
tempting to monopolize, and by contracts,
combinations and conspiracies in restraint
of trade and commerce.
'-; It - should not, Jhe says, be difficult to
distinguish legitimate business enterprises
of associations or r bona-fide partnerships!
The present law should be amended so as
to prevent the : refusal of witnesses to
answer on the ground of self-incrimina
tion,' this defect having been severely felt
in all attempts to enforce.; the law. He
also suggests the propriety of making the
penalties of ; the . law { applicable only to
general . officers, managers or agents, and
not to subordinates. ' : -

Defeated.
ARGUMENT ON THE BOND BILL.
Hall and De Armond of Missouri Create
Amusement by Their Harmless
Attacks.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 13.â After
nearly two weeks of almost continuous de
bate the House this afternoon in commit
tee of the whole by a vote of 190 to 80 rec
ommended to the House proper non-con
currence in the Senate free coinage amend
ment to the House bill providing addi
tional revenue for the Government, the
issue of bonds to protect and maintain the
gold reserve and the sale of treasury cer
tificates to meet temporary deticiences in
revenue. As nearly as could be judged
about half the Democrats voted against
the Senate substitute and the Republican
vote in favor of it was about 30. The
exact figures, however, wiU be known to
morrow when the roll will be called for an
aye and no vote on the committee recom
mendation. In the course of the consider
ation of the bill under the. five-minute
rule, which lasted from 12 to 4 o'clock, the
following proposed amendments were lost
by the votes stated
. By Long (R.) of Kansas, to coin the
product of the mines of the United States
onlyâ to 41..
By Bruinm (R.) of Pennsylvania, pro
viding that whenever the commercial ratio
of the two metals shall vary from the coin
age ratio, the seigniorage shall be retained
by the Governmentâ Bs to 39.
By Towne (R.) of Minnesota, commit
ting the United States to the free coinage
of silver at the ratio of 15}^ to 1, when
ever Germany and France open their
mints for the same purposeâ l 46 to 52.
Dingley, chairman of the Committee on
Ways and Means, announced that to
morrow Crisp would speak in favor of con
curring in the Senate amendment; mem
bers of the Ways and Means Committee
opposed to that action would reply, and
then he should ask a vote upon the recom
mendation of the committee of the whole.
In the latitude: of debate still enjoyed
under the rules of the House, Hall and
De Armond (D.) of Missouri engaged in a
personal controversy, conducted with con
siderable : ; bitterness of 7 expression, , but
within proper parliamentary methods,
however, over tbe conversion of the former I
to the cause of sound money, as contra
distinguished from free coinage of silver.
This Hall had announced in a speech last
Saturday, and on Tuesday, in his absence,
De Armond criticized his action. When
they had concluded matters were left in
much the same state as at the beginning.
The incident, however, seemed to afford
much entertainment to the members and
they resented efforts made to restrict and
limit the verbal onslaughts of the gentle
men upon each other. -'""
The report of the Committee on Elec
tions No. 2 upon the contest of Van Horn
vs. Tarsney, from the Fifth Missouri Dis
trict, in favor of Van Horn, was presented
by Chairman Johnson. The House then,
at 4:15 o'clock, adjourned until to-morrow
at noon.
Doolittle (R.) of Washington began his
speech at the opening of the last session
of the House dcv oted to general debate on
the bond free coinage bill to Speaker pro
tern. Payne and two other members. He
announced his intention to vote for the
Senate substitute as an American, a Re
publican and a protectionist.
Grout (R.) of Vermont said that the
adoption of the substitute would of neces
sity put the Nation on a silver basis,
thereby causing a depreciation in the
value -of every obligation issued in the
country to 50 cents on the dollar.
McCall (R.) of Tennessee and Hadley
(R.) of Illinois. followed in opposition to
the Senate substitute, and the general de
bate was closed by Willis (R.) of Dela
ware.
V At 11:55 the House adjourned, and at
noon reconvened in Thursday's legislative
day. -Â .. A A- "A; .â¦
.'--â¢" Hitt (R.) of Illinois reported from the
Committee on Foreign Affairs a resolution
calling upon the President for the corre
spondence with Hayti respecting the claim
of Bernard Campbell of Boston for dam
ages because of injuries inflicted by an as
sault committed in an â¢ attempt to force
him into the naval service of Hayti, and it
was agreed to. â¢ - -. ; . '"â '"' ?
- The consideration of the bond coinage
bill was then resumed in committee of the
whole under the five-minute rule.
Dingley stated the parliamentary situa
tion of the bill ; which would permit of the
introduction of motions "to concur in tne
Senate substitute, to concur with amend
ments," and to "non-concur." He would
ask the committee ; to vote down all ; mo
tions to amend, so that at 4 o'clock the
question of concurrence or ; non-concur
rence could be voted on without any quali
fication. He moved that the committee
recommend A non-concurrence with the
Senate substitute.
Crisp (D.) of Georgia moved that the
committee recommend s that the House
concur in the Senate substitute.
Long (R.) of Kansas moved to amend by
restricting the coinage' to the production
of the silver mines of the United States.
On this amendment ;> there was ; debate -in
the general terms of the financial question
and of the action of the Senate in return
ing the substitute to the House. Among
â¢the speakers were: Grow (R.) of Pennsyl
vania, McCall (R.) of ; Massachusetts, Blue
(R.) of Kansas, Maguire (D.) of California,
Boatner (D.) of Louisiana and Hutchinson
(D.) of Texas. â¢
Ly Dingley said that the amendment J, was
open to the objection y that it was : not in 'â 
place upon this bill.'and that it was in no
sense a solution of the problem of free and
unlimited coinage of \ silver. The amend
ment was rejectedâ 41 to 118.
; r Brumm (R.) of Pennsylvania offered an
amendment to the Senate substitute: pro
viding that whenever 5 the 7 commercial
ratio of the two ? metals \ varies from * the
coinage ratio the seigniorage of the/ bow
lion presented for coinage shall be retained
by, the Government. The amendment was
lostâ 39 to 81.' '-..".',:':.' .'! 5" 7
Corliss (R.) of ..Michigan offered an
amendment combining the two previously
rejected, for the purpose of explaining his
position. 7 Dingley opposed * the â  amend
ment and was asked , by Corliss ' if the
House might look to the Committee on
Ways and Means or to another committee
for action at this session looking to the in
itiation of a movement in favor of en
larged use of silver.
- Dingley replied that the Senator from
Colorado , (Wolcott) had prepared an
amendment to the sundry civil appropri
ation bill for the current year looking to
an international conference, the United
States," however, looking to another na
tion for initiative action. For himself,
Dingly stated, amid applause, that he was
in favor of the United States taking " pri
mary action to ; bring about a conference
on the subject.
Corliss' amendment was rejected with
out a division.
Towne (R.) of Minnesota offered an
amendment committing the United States
to the free coinage of silver at the ratio of
15>_ to 1 when the mints of Germany and
France shall have been opened for that
purpose. He said the bill was agreed
upon by a conference of economists in
Europe last summer and was to be offered
in the English Parliament, the German
Reichstag and the French Chamber of
Deputies. With the concurrent action of
the United States with Germany and
France, he said, he had no doubt that the
parity of the two metals under free and
unlimited coinage could be maintained,
and such joint action would compel
Englandâ nothing else wouldâ to come to
their position.
Updegraff (R.) of Ohio said that the
financial argument ! had â¢ proceeded upon
one of two assumptions: That the Amer
ican people were desirous of settling their
debts upon a basis of 50 cents on the dollar
or that Congress had the power to legis
late into 50 cents' worth of silver 100 cents'
worth of value. No honest man would
stand a moment on the first, and no legis
lative body had the power to do the latter.
The curse of Adam, the force of which he
first felt in his youth, that in the sweat of
his face must he earn bread, stood in the
way of accomplishing such an object by
legislation. Silver was demonetized, he
said, upon the same principle and for the
same reason and by the same "conspiracy"
which effected the law of 1873, that de
monetized codfish in Massachusetts and
whisky and tobacco in Virginia. Both
gave way for a better material for cur
rency, and when the people found some
thing better than" gold for money they
would adopt that. *7
Owens (D.) of : Kentucky said he con
gratulated the country that the House
was not confined to the choice of either of
the two evilsâ the bond - bill as it passed
the House or the free-coinage substitute
sent by the Senateâ but that the defeat of
one would be speedily followed by the de
mise of the other. Whatever party to
day, he said, : bound itself to the dead body
of free silver would not again receive the
confidence of the country in the twenty
five years to come.
Dingley (R.) of Maine opposed Towne's
amendment for the reason that United
States was not ready at this time to sug
gest an international ratio for the coinage
of silver. The .amendment was disagreed
to-52 to 146.
On Crisp's motion to agree to the Senate
substitute without amendment the vote
was: Ayes, 80; noes, 190. It seemed 'hat
half of the Democrats voted against their
leader, and as the -"members rose to be
counted the demonstration of overwhelm
ing strength was greeted with applause by
the victorious side. -7" â ;"-*â ..

of 2233 Claifc street, the : possessor of con

DRAMATIC SCENE
IN THE COURT.

Judge.
MARIE FAINTS AT ONCE.
Ruby Sobs and the Grandmother
Desperately Fights the
Officers'.
SHE DECLARES IT AN OUTRAGE.
Screams of the Unfortunate Females
Drowned by the Clanging of the
Prison Doors.
â â -.:'â  ,-: -
OMAHA, Neb., Feb. 13.â The well-known
Wilson women who came from Los Angeles
are in jail. They assaulted Officer "Wilson
when he got into their room to serve a writ
of attachment. 'C; 7
When arraigned there was a scene dram
atiointhe extreme. Marie fainted, while
Ruby sobbed and the old lady fought the
officers. They were told to listen to the
complaints.
v "l won't listen," said Mrs. Wilson, and
she turned her back to the officer and threw
her head as far away from him as she
could.
"Come up before the Judge," ordered the
court officer.
"I won't," said Mrs. Wilson, as she
braced herself. The little girl renewed her
weeping.
"I won't go," screamed Mrs. Wilson, as
two officers caught hold of her; "I won't."
She struggled desperately.
"Bring her up here," ordered the court.
The officers put forth extra efforts and the
woman dropped to the floor, striking upon
her knees. She was dragged up before the
bench, all the while screaming, "I won't,"
and was then placed upon her feet.
During all the . while the sobs of the
granddaughter resounded through the
courtroom. The complaints were read and
throughout the reading Mrs. Wilson
screamed: "It is an outrage. You can do
anything you want with us, but it is an
outrage." â -""*â¢
The woman and the girl were at once re
turned to jail, the former between two
officers and bewailing the outrage to which
she had been subjected. When the "ail
was reached the jailer was ordered to take
the old woman to a cell, while the girl was
ordered to be placed with Marie in the
woman's room. At the iron grating the
old woman fiercely clutched the girl and
refused to let hei go.
"You shan't take her away," she
screamed. "If I go down there she will
go, too. You are brutes, all of you. You
shan't take her, you shan't."
The officers once more interfered. They
seized the old woman and forcibly tore her
from the .little girl. She was dragged
down the stone steps and pushed into a
cell, still resisting. . The trial was set for
to-morrow.

a baker; and an anarchist, was arrested to

Morgan Objected to Hasty
Action.
WARNING TO BE EXTENDED.

* . - -*
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 13.â The an
nual meeting of the New York Yacht
Club was held to-night at the clubhouse
here. There were in all 127 members
present. The meeting was called to order
by Commodore Brown. After the trans
action of some routine business the follow
ing resolution was offered by Captain
Ledyard :
Whereas, The Earl of Dunraven, an honorary
member of this club, has publicly made cer
tain statements charging that foul play was j
practiced by those in charge of the Defender
la the recent race for the America's cup, and !
upon investigation of said charges, mads by !
t committee appointed by this club on No
vember IS, 1895, and participated in by
Lord Dunraven and his counsel, it clearly
appeared that the said charges were
not only untrue in fact, but wholly unwar
ranted and unsupported by any reasonable
grounds of suspicion. Lord Dunraven has
neither retracted the said false charges nor
offered any apology for making the same.
Under these circumstances it is in the judg
ment of tne club manifestly improper that the
Earl ot Dunraven should contiuue to enjoy the
privileges of honorary membership therein;
therefore it is
Resolved, That the secretary be instructed to
inform the Earl of Dunraven that bis resigna
tion as an honorary member of the New York
Yacht Club is requested by the club.
be following cablegram was then read:
London, Feb. 12.
'die, Sew York Yacht Club, New York : For
warded letter Rives Saturday, Phelps to-day.
Dunraven*.
J; P. Morgan opposed the immediate
adoption of the Ledyard resolution, and in
moving an amendment to it said:
"In view of the dispatch which has just
been received by the secretary, it seems to
me unwise for the club to take any action
to-night on the resolution offered by Cap
tain Ledyard.
"Not that we are not in a position to do
so, but as we have extended to Lord Dun
raven every courtesy up to this time I
think it would be a mistake, in the face of
the dispatch from him stating that there
â  are letters on the way,* to act too hurriedly
to-night, when we can just as well do it in
a few days. I would move, therefore, that
this meeting be adjourned to ..two weeks j
from to-night (February 27), to take action
on the resolution offered by Captain Led
yard."
The amendment was carried by a large
majority, although some of the members
were not in favor of granting the ear""-- fur
ther time and manifested a strong desire
to demand his resignation .immediately.
The regular nominees for officers of
the club were all elected without opposi
tion. Commodore E. M. Brown was re
elected, as was also the regatta committee.
Hon. E. J. Phelps and Captain A. T. Ma.
han, U. S. N., were elected honorary mem-
Ders of the club. The date of the annua'
regatta was fixed for June 11. The meet
ing was then adjourned to February 27.
DR. NANSEN AT
THE NORTH POLE,
Continued from First Page.
wouldn't wonder if Nansen had really
found the pole.
"Why not?" he said at the Occidental
last night. "Nansen is just the man to do
it. He is a Norwegian and there is nobody
like the Norwegians to stand excruciating
cold, show and little food. Their powers
of* endurance are wonderful. And they
take pride in it, too, when there is occasion
for it.
â¢'What greater incentive could one have
than the hope of finding the pole? Add
to all this the fact that Nansen is young
with lots of new good blood in his veins,
the feeling of conquest and glory upon
him, "besides being better equipped than
any other man who ever set out to
find the pole, and you will see why he is
peculiarly the man for the effort. Nansen
has studied the whole matter and has the
accumulated knowledge of the ages. I
have been at Irkutsk. It is something over
1000 miles from the . coast which borders
the Sea of Kara. I do not know Koucli
nareff, the reported agent of Dr. Nansen,
who is* said to have arrived at Irkutsk, but
he is a Russian probably. That is a com
mon name in Siberia.
'As to the Sea of Kara, it is rough
enough there, but not as terrible as would
appear. We have thought at times of
sending our own vessels that way to Lon
don. Captain Wlggta has crossed by that
route many times. He sailed from London
to. the mouth of the Lena River, on the
Siberian coast, and Sea of Kara, seventeen
times, and only once was wrecked.'
" "To-day I heard a man say it was non
sense to suppose that a man could arrive
at Irkutsk in winter, with the news. Why,
it is the time a messenger could best arrive.
I apprehend that the dispatch may have
for month** been delayed at some remote
post. I think it arrived there at such- a
time in the fall as found the tundras still
uncovered by the snow. The messenger
had to wait till snow; fell.in depth. The
way would then be good and the messen
ger could advance. He may : have had to
travel with dogs for weeks and months.
"In these days of the.cathode rays, when
men are looking through ; a man's flesh at
hi: bones and you can look In upon the
workings of the brain as a man can rais?
the lid of his watch and see the wheels,
Nansen's effort should not be despised. . â (.
"His* project is really feasible. ,1 Bay
this knowing much of the country he has
to contend with. y The 1 story ' that he .has
found the pole should not be laughed at.
Trie man who could give up family, friends
and civilization for three or five years,
subsist on poor and meager food or none
an hear no news from anywhere, has the
stuff in him "which brings results. I
; wouldn't wonder if he had found the pole.*
"The Fram was just the kind of a vessel
â¢ he should have had, and Nansen was the
j best man of the age to go in it."
GUAYAQUIL'S GREAT LOSS.
The Damage . Caused by Fire Much Heavier
Than Was at First Re
ported.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 12.â A special
cable dispatch to the Herald from Panama
says: ~-.*7.â.~
The fire that swept through the city of
Guayaquil, Ecuador, yesterday did not
result in as many deaths as at first feared,
but the property loss was much greater.
Only five members of tne fire brigade were
killed, though forty were wounded and
several severely. The death list maybe
materially increased.
More than 134 houses, including several
public buildings of great beauty and one
or more of historic interest, were destroyed.
Among the latter were the cathedral and
the convent adjoining. The loss is con
servatively estimated at $4,000,000.

reports that 1500 rebels, under command
of the leader Castillo, attacked a small
i detachment of his troops who Were en
gaged in repairing the telegraph lines near
San Filipe, the fight lasting an hour and a
half. ; 7;7.77^.
The rebels had three men killed and
fifteen wounded. Reports are also re
ceived that a column of Spanish troops
coming by train from Guara to San Felipe â¢
were surrounded by the enemy, who had
burned a bridge to compel the train to
stop. The Spanish soldiers fought with
great bravery and dispersed the rebels
with the loss of five killed and many
wounded.
Another column of Spanish troops ad
vancing from Aljaria met and dispersed a
party of rebels, killing eleven and wound
ing twenty-three. The only Spanish loss
reported during the entire series of en
gagements was the wounding of Corporal
Jose Sanchez.
The official report of a battle between
Colonel Lopez Amor, with 400 Spanish
troops, and a force of 5000 insurgents has
just been given out. The report says the
fight lasted the entire day of February 8.
â  The rebels sustained heavy losses and
the Spanish troops had six killed and forty
wounded. The troops conducted them
selves in the most heroic manner. The in
surgents were the escort of the Cuban rev
olutionary junta.
General Godoy reports having defeated
the rebel parties of Lacret, Nunez and
other leaders at Five Palms on February
9, killing eighteen rebels.
General, Cornell reports having had a !
successful battle with the forces of Anto- j

seven seriously wounded and sixteen
slightly wounded. General Cornell was
himself slightly wounded in the chest.

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 13.âAn
other Cuban expedition, including about
100 of the survivors of the Hawkins expe
dition, sailed from New York last Monday
night. It was made up of Cubans from
this city, New York and Boston.
A steamer which the Cuban leaders here
call by the name of Englewood, hailing
from Nova Scotia, is the vessel. She was
leased through a New York firm of ship
brokers and brought on to Long Island
Sound, where she has been lying at an
chor for the last two weeks.
She carries to the insurgents 100,000
rounds of cartridges and 20U0 stands of
arms.
The money to pay for this expedition
came from Cuba a few days ago. In
Cuban circles $97,000 in Spanish gold is
the figure named.
A mistake made in the Hawkins expedi
tion was avoided in this. The men were
sent in small squads to the vessel and Â« the
arms and ammunition in small quantities,
instead of loading in bulk, as was done
before. - v

HEALY ADMITS DISLOYALTY.
Ready to Attack and Thwart the
Policy of Those Who Refuse
Ireland Justice.
LONDON, Esq., Feb. 13.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day the Right Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State
for the s Colonies, said in reply to a ques
tion that only three of the Uittlanders ar
rested in Johannesburg, were now in jail
at Pretoria, and it was bis belief that if any
of them should fall ill they would be re
leased as was John Hays Hammond, the
American. In view of the fact, however,
that the inquiry into the cases of the men
arrested has been adjourned without date
he was considering whether it would not
be proper to suggest lo the Transvaal Gov
ernment that they be released on bail.
George N. Curzon, Parliamentary Secre
tary for Foreign Affairs, made a state
ment in regard to the small island of Trin
idad, occupation of which is now a sub
ject of dispute between Great Britain and
Brazil. It was occupied by Great Britain,
he said, in 1871 and evacuated, the follow
ing year. , Subsequently Great Britain re
occupied the island after communications
on the subject had passed between
England and Portugal. The Government,
Mr. Curzon said, had proposed to submit
the dispute with Brazil over the occupa
tion of the island to arbitration.
Mr. Curzon, continuing, said that the
island of Trinidad had not been ceded to
Brazil when it was abandoned .by Great
Britain, but to Portugal. Brazil had not
at that time an independent existence.
The reoccupation of the island by Eng
land was not based upon the ground of
her previous occupation, but because hav
ing been abandoned for a century the
island belonged to nobody.
The debate on the address in reply to
the speech from the throne was resumed,
the subject being the amendment offered
by John Dillon declaring that a balance of
a bill providing for the self-government of
Ireland had aroused discontent among the
Irish and increased the difficulties exist
ing in foreign affairs.
Sir William Harconrt. leader of the op
position, said it was the belief of the oppo
sition that the discontent prevailing in
Ireland would not be extinguished until
the demands of the Irish for local self
government were satisfied. They would
never cure the dormant disorders of many
centuries unless they went to the root of
the evil. The Government had said that
it would never grant home rule. "Never"
was a word which, in the liberal inter
pretation, was unwise, especially in the
mouth of an occupant of the office of
Chief Secretary for Ireland, and he would
advise the Chief Secretary to modify the
expression to "Hardly ever."
The future of home rule, he said, de
pended much upon the course pursued by
Irish members. Home rule certainly did
not get a great deal of encouragement I
from John Redmond, whose policy, Sir
William said, appeared to be to attack
home-rulers wherever he found them,
[Cries of "Hear! hear!"]
Sir William, continuing, said that noth
ing had occurred to alter the home-rule
policy of the opposition, and they con-'
tinued to adhere to it as he repeatedly de
clared. [Cheers.]
A. J. Balfour said he believed that when
the Irish at home and abroad realized
"that Parliament Â» was sincerely and
earnestly desirous of giving to Ireland a
full and generous measure of justice, a
change of opinion would occur, removing
at . once â  and : for all time the dissensions
between the nations. *
Mr. Healy admitted his disloyalty to
England. He. had been sent to this" Par
liament to secure the establishment of a
native Irish Parliament, and his endeavor,
therefore, would be to harass, attack and
thwart in every way the policy of those
who refused to grant Ireland home rule.
Mr. Dillon's amendment was rejected by
a vote of 276 to 160.
Henry Labouchere, ' the well-known
radical, moved an amendment to the ad
dress declaring the Jameson inquiry ought
to include the financial and political ac
tions of the British South African Com
pany. â¢
â¢ The Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, said
that he having t carefully examined into
the facts connected with the raid into the
.Transvaal believed that Cecil Rhodes, the
directors of the British South African
Company, the Reform Committee at
Johannesburg and Sir Hercules Robinson,
Governor of Cape Colony, were all equally
ignorant of the action of Dr. Jameson.:
Mr. Chamberlain protested against pre
judicing the case, The Transvaal Govern
ment, he added, was responsible for acts it
would be difficult ': to justify. President
Kruger, in showing moderation now, only
followed the example of Great Britain on
previous occasions.
Mr. Chamberlain further said that the
inquiry would J include the objects of the
proposed amendment. Nobody knew
what the outcome would Ibe of ; the trial of
Dr. Jameson or I the trial *of the prisoners
at A Pretoria. The ;.; Government had an
mind IS regarding -;â  the ."; inquiry. He A had
nothing to do with Mr. Rhodes' return, to
Africa. * ""
- Mr. Rhodes had told him that he was
going back " with the sole object of devel
oping Rhodesia.- It would bean act of in
gratitude now when ' suspicion hung over
him to forget the services he had done and
might do the country. ;
â¢ Mr. Chamberlain announced that Presi
dent ; : Kruger complained about the pub
lication of the dispatch; sent by him (Mr.
Chamberlain) to 'â¢'. Sir Hercules Robinson
reviewing the causes A that ; led to Dr.
Jameson's raid into the Transvaal, enum
erating r the grievances of thevUitlanders
and": suggesting; a scheme of reforms, in
cluding the granting of limited autonomy
to the inhabitants of the Rand.
* This dispatch also contained an invita
tion for President Kruger to visit England
to discuss the questions rat issue, and said
that if j' he â¢ should be unable to accept the
invitation Mr. Chamberlain â  relied upon
Governor Robinson to prosecute negotia
tions for upholding the Anglo-Boer con
vention of 1884, President : : Kruger, Mr.'
Chamberlain said, also complained that he
(Mr. Chamberlain) had interfered with the
internal relations of the Transvaal. ' '
This Mr. Chamberlain rebutted, declar
ing that he had been actuated by the sin
cerest wishes for the welfare of the Trans
vaal. He was confident that he "would
have the support of the country in con
tinuing all legitimate influence to secure
the justice that has hitherto been denied
to a majority of the population of . the

GHOST DAXCE OF STXTDEXTS.
Peculiar Revelry Reported at a Dental
College.
INDIANAPOLIS, Inp.. Feb. 13.â A great
sensation has been caused here by the dis
covery that the body _of Mrs. Alonzo
Rooker, who was murdered by her nus
band several weeks ago, was turned over
to the Indianapolis Dental College, and
during dissection by \ the students was
made' the subject of jests and other in
dignities. It is charged the students
sang the witches' song from "Macbeth"
around the corpse as it lay on the dissect
ing table, decorated the body with ribbons
and conducted a kind of a ghost dance
around -it.
The Coroner says that he turned the
body over to the college as the law pro
vides, and that he knows of no indignities
offered. The officers of the institution
deny that anything of the kind occurred,
but the report has created a sensation,
and is told with apparently truthful de
tails, so as to leave no doubt of its truth.
HEARD IN THE REICHSTAG
Minister Yon Bieberstein Pro
tests Against British In
dignation, y
Germany Has Only Protected Her In
terests in the Transvaal Accord- ,
ing to the Treaty.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 13.â pre
senting the Foreign Office estimates in the
Reichstag to-day Freiherr Marschal yon
Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
took occasion to declare that nothing had
happened to justify the outbreak of Indig
nation on the part of the British public.
The good relations existing between the
"Ministers of Germany and Great Britain,
he said, had never for a moment been in
terrupted.
It is' not true that President Kruger of
the South African republic had appealed
to Germany to intervene. Germany had
only protected her interests in the Trans
vaal under the commercial treaty con
cluded in 1885. He would not attempt to
argue against English public opinion and
he would equally avoid anything calcu
lated to pour oil upon the fire, but he
declared he would demand the same right
of free expression of the feeling of the
people of Germany as England wields
freely the right to express the anti-
German feeling of the people of Great
Britain. This declaration was received
with prolonged cheers. V
Dr. Hammacher expressed his thanks
that the Government had not identified
itself with the fantastic increase of the
navy which bad been suggested.
Herren Lieber and Yon Kardoff gave ex
pressions of thanks to the Government for
its firm foreign policy. â¢
Herr Richter declared that harmony be
tween England and Germany meant peace
throughout the world. War, he said,
would work serious damage to Germany,
but it would be disastrous to England in
India and in Egypt.
Herr Rebel, Socialist, condemned the
congratulatory telegrams sent by the Em
peror to President Kruger, which he said
had justly aroused the indignation of
England. If the . case had been one in
volving free France^ or Russia instead of
England, he declared the message would
never have been sent. If such a policy
was ventured upon, he predicted that
Germany would some day be awakened
by a dire catastrophe. He then proceeded
to attack the policy of Germany in the
East.;. ; .' -â  'â â  '."' - ".â -
FORTY PERSONS DROWNED
Terrible Disaster by Which the
Steamer Pearl Was
Sunk.
The Vessel Was Cut in Two by Being
Carried Athwart of a Cable
in the River.
BRISBANE, Queensland, Feb. 13.â The
steamer Pearl, : having on board aoout
eighty persons, met with:, a peculiar acci
dent to-day that resulted in the death of
forty persons. The Brisbane River has
been greatly swollen by heavy.- rains that
have fallen lately and the current is run
ning very - strong. . The Pearl was not
powerful enough to stem the current, and
was swung broadside on and carried down
the river. . â  :*
Before she could get way enough on to
carry her out of danger , she was carried
athwart the cable chains of the Lucinda,
which was lying at anchor in the stream.
The Pearl struck the chains with such
force that she was almost completely cut
in two. Then the current turned her over
and she sank. . Before she went down,
however, a vast volume of steam was seen
ascending from her, and it was afterward
learned that her Bteam-pipeu had â¢ been
broken.
* Many of those on. her lower deck were
fatally ; scalded, while forty others were
drowned. ".'. ' , â  ?"; j
The work of rescuing the survivors * was
extremely difficult, as they were carried
seaward with great rapidity; by. the flood.
Thousands gathered about the; scene* of
the j disaster, and there were many affect
ing ,' scenes "^ as :' the living and _ dead were

An Almost Incredible Story of Brutal
ityâThe Perpetrators Are All
Under Arrest.
â  â  /â . v
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Fab. 13.â Two
other Indians have been arrested for com
plicity in the murder of Mrs. Piatt, the
Indian school teacher at Temecula.
Their names are Francisco Rodrigues and
Ventura Marido. 7
:*, The two men were brought before Jus
tice Vawater at San Jacinto and arraigned
on a warrant charging them with murder.
Guavish was also arraigned before the
same Justice and the examination set for
February 25. ,
Last evening in the jail at Riverside one
of the last two men arrested broke down
and made a complete confession. The con
fession was made to Sheriff Johnson of
Riverside and Deputy Sheriff Martin
Marsh of Los Angeles.
His story is to the effect that on Septem
ber 19, 1894, the three men now under ar
rest, together with Mateo Pa, went to the
house of Mrs. Piatt and demanded that
she eive them some money. In some
manner they had .earned that Mrs. Piatt
had that morning.received o her salary from
the Government.
Mrs. Piatt, however, deposited all but
$20atTemecula. She informed the quartet
of this fact when they called at her house,
but they did not believe her. That even
ing three of the men returned to Mrs.
Piatt's house. ,
In some manner they got her to come to
the door without wakine her little niece.
As she opened the door, Guavish is said to
have grabbed her about the throat, thereby
preventing her from making an outcry.
, She was taken about 250 feet from the
house and outraged by the three fiends.
Aiterward she was murdered. Her body
was then carried back into the house, sat
urated with coal oil and the torch applied.
In making the confession the young
buck slated that Mrs. Piatt was strangled
to death by Guavish before being as
saulted. He also .stated that -Mateo Pa
was not with them when they returned in
the evening,' but that he knew of their in
tentions and sanctioned them.

Advisability of Incorporating the

. â *~ â â . â 
BALTIMORE, Md., Feb. 13â Only a cor
poral's guard of delegates to the L. A. W.
convention were in their places when Pres
ident Willison rapped for order for the
closing day's session this morning. Many
of the delegates had departed for their
homes. A committee of five was appointed
to take up reinstatement appeals from the
decision of the racing board,' to hear all
evidence and report their findings to the
convention. The method of selecting the
place for holding the National midsummer
meet came up under new business and
caused a prolific debate. It was finally de
cided to empower the legislative commit
tee, the president and the first and second
vice-presidents to set the place of holding
the meet by mail vote of the members of
the assembly, or the executive officers of
each division, subdivision or consulate, or
of the boards of officers of the same, or of
the membership at large, as in the judg
ment of the executive committee shall be
deemed best. â 
. The special committee appointed to con
sider reinstatement appeals made a report
which was adopted. I By it A. Parker Rich

Orleans, L. A. Ryer of Jersey City, A. W.
Cleaves of Chicago, \ Albert ;M. ; Price of
Ghent, Ky., arid James W. Curry of Au

The advisability, of " incorporating the
league was discussed at length and Messrs.
Sams of Maryland and Cossum and Potter,
of New York were appointed ' a committee
: to inquire into the laws of the various
States in relation to the matter, with
power to take out incorporation papers.
During the last hours of the convention
several unimportant amendments to the
constitution were rushed through. The
incoming executive committee was dele
gated ,to select the place for holding the
next annual assembly. V Mr. * Potter â¢ pre
sented the case of F. J. Titus of Brooklyn,

PROHIBITION AT RIVERSIDE.
The Law Gains Another Victory by a
Decision of Judge Xoyes.
A. RIVERSIDE, Cal., Feb. 13.â The pro
hibition law of this city gained another
victory to-day -when Judge Noyes of the
Superior Court handed down a decision in
an appeal case wherein one Bush, a res
taurant-keeper, under conviction of illegal
liquor selling, sought to have the verdict
against him set aside. Bush was con
victed under that section of the law which
gives to the hotels with forty rooms or
more a right to supply guests with liquors
while denying the right to houses with,
less than forty rooms.
The decision of the court is that the city
had a right to arbitrarily fix the number
of rooms, and that Bush having only
thirty-four rooms in his hotel was euiltv
of an infraction of tbe law. Bush, who is
under sentence of $300 fine and thirty days
imprisonment, will appeal the case to the
Supreme Court.
MILL VALLEY WARBLERS
The Scheme to Import Feathered
Songsters Assumes Tangible
Shape.
All the Sportsmen's Clubs of Marin
County to Take a Hand in the
Project.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 12.â The
scheme to import songbirds into Mill
Valley has at . last assumed definite shape.
Well-known business men of San Fran
cisco who are.residents of Mill Valley have
taken hold of the project with the in
tention of pushing it through as rapidly
as possible.
A meeting has been called for next
Saturday night by Secretary Thomas Fot
trell of the Mill Valley Improvement Club
and a general invitation has been extended
to all persons interested in seeing such a
worthy project 'carried through success
fully. Special invitations have been sent
to the members of the Tamalpais Sports
men's Club and other Marin County or
ganizations of a similar character, and it
is expected that a large number of ; the
lovers of birds will attend.
Contractors have been consulted, and
they have furnished estimates on the cost
of constructing large cages, in which the
birds will be kept for some time after they
arrive in the valley, in order that they
may become accustomed to the climate.
Bird-dealers have also been asked to fur
nish prices at which they will supply song
birds of various varieties.- ; -.:.-
Mr. Michalitschke, who is a resident of
Mill Valley, and one of the members of
the firm of Michalitschke Bros, of San
Francisco, has been most energetic in his
efforts to interest the people of Mill Valley
in the scheme. He was seen by a Call
correspondent, and said that a number of
friends had talked over the matter of im
porting songbirds from Ireland and other
countries, and had come to the conclusion
that the best means in order to accomplish
the purpose was to form a club whose
members might pay a small monthly due
which would go toward the support of the
club and the birds. In this way, he
thought, the members of the club could
pay a very small sum, which, if the or
ganization held a fair membership, would
be sufficient for all the needs.
Secretary Thomas Fottrell of the Mill
Valley Improvement Club was also seen,
and said. that an unusual amount of inter
est was being taken in the project by the
people of Mill Valley and elsewhere. 7V-. .':â â¢'
"Why," said he, "I have received nu
merous" suggestions as to how the : birds
should be cared for. ; One person suggests
feeding them upon potatoes, and . others
have instructed me unon the 'only correct
method; of building cages' in which to
keep the birds. I have written to Ireland
and expect to receive a reply in a week or
so, and I think it will be possible to secure
the biras "needed at a very slight ex
pense. * . .
"A subscription list has been started and
a meeting called for next Saturday even
ing, so you see that business is meant."
Mr. Fottrell also said that it was the in
tention to : secure larks at once. Every
thing necessary for the protection of t_e
birds will be done and it is possible that
the small boys of Mill Valley will be given
a bonus for every scalp they secure of the
detestable ' bluejay, which plays havoc
with the young birds.

at the County Infirmary William. Sea and
his son. . The father has attained the re
markable old age of 102 years. The son is
now in his sixty-third year, and probably
no one has endured the sufferings he has
and that are yet in store for him. His ail
ment is chronic epilepsy, extending over a
period of - sixty years, and his only relief
County Physician Kier says will be the

to a scalp burn while lying in a cradle too
close to a heated stove.
The old man and his boy are. made as
comfortable as possible *in a little ward
some ; distance from the main . building.
The son has no use of his limbs and lies in
a contracted position on a cot in one cor

VAN KOVALEV'S
DEATH WATCH
The Weber Murderer to Be
Closely Guarded After
Monday Next.
STILL CHERISHES HOPES.
Cannot Understand That He Has
No Possible Chance for
His Life.
NO DOUBT AS TO HIS SANITY.
Warden Aull Will Take Every Pre
caution to Prevent Self
â¢ Destruction.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Feb. Mon
day next the death watch will be set over
, Ivan Kovalev, and from the time that he
is transferred from his solitary cell, which
he now occupies, to the larger one, where
he will spend the last few hours of life
which the stern mandates of the law al
lows him, he will not be allowed a single
moment of solitude.
At the present time he still cherishes
hopes that there may be a possible chance
that the law which has condemned him to
' die an ignominious death on the scaffold
wiU relent and allow him to try to prove
that he is innocent of the ghastly crime of
which he Pas been convicted and for
which he will pay the full penally one
short week hence. -
There has as yet been no attempt made
upon the part of the prison authorities to
disabuse his mind of the hope that there
is some chance left that he will be enabled to
gain a new trial, for the absolute cowardice
of the roan is so apparent that the authori
ties fear that should he know of a
surety that there is absolutely not one
atom of hope for him the man would cheat
justice of her prey by dying outright of
sheer fear.
For some time past â  Kovalev has devel
oped a spirit of sulkiness, and bis only de
sire seems to be that he be left entirely
alone.
He does not. care to mingle with his
fellow comrades 'in misfortune, nor
does he seem to care to hold converse
with any â¢of the - guards or officials
of the prison, but" like 'the symbol
of the wild beast he iv reality
is he only desires to keep apart from his
fellows till the hand of" the executioner of.
the law's* mandates falls upon his shoul
ders and he is led out upon the scaffold to
swing off into eternity.
Every other day Kovalev is led out into
the open air and .for, some hours he is
allowed to enjoy the bright sunshine which
he is goon to bid /farewell to forever. He
seems to enjoy these brief respites from the
confinement and gloom of . his cell and in
variably eats heartily after one of these
brief strolls, but the majority: of the time
he isa very slight eater, and -at times be
will absolutely refuse-to touch - any of the
eatables that are conveyed to him for days
at time.
Warden Charles Aull when interviewed
by a Cat,!, representative to-day said:
"Physically and mentally Kovalev is all
rfgb He possesses not one trace of in
sanity, and in fact openly acknowledges
that he is not insane.
"He has not the slightest idea that there
is no hope for him, on the contrary, he is
living in the hope that circumstances will
mitigate in his favor. I shall place a
death-watch on this man next Mon

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
13. âIf enthusiasm counts for any
thing Stanford should be able to put a
pretty good set of trackmen in the inter
collegiate meet this year. More men are
now at work each evening than at any
time before in the history of athletics here.
It is no uncommon sight to see twenty
men at wOrk together on the track or at
the weights, while last season at this time
it was frequently the case that the captain
had but four or five men out, despite his
efforts. * ,

tain Toombs '96 directs the operations of
some ten or a dozen, bare-limbed athletes. ,

Dole 'OS and Bunton '99 show up credit
ably in the pole vault, and- Reynolds '96,

Senator, W. Cross, the San Francisco
lawyer, was here last week and examined
the* Pure Quill mine. : Papers < are now

NIELSEN'S ABSENCE EXPLAINED.
The Stockton Bookkeeper's Accounts Sev
eral Thousand Dollars Short.
STOCKTON; Cal., Feb. 13.â It; is now
known that Edward C. C. Nielsen, ' the
missing bookkeeper of Thomas & Bueli,
the planing-miil men of this city, is a
defaulter to tbe extent of several thousand
dollars. His peculations extend over six
or seven years, and - were covered up by
false footings in the cash book and ledger.
Some months as high as $180 was taken,
and at other times smaller sums, ranging
down to $100.
Experts are now busy examining the
books, but there are so many discrepancies
that the full amount of the defalcation will
not be known for several days.
Before leaving Stockton he gave his wife
a policy for $5000 on his life. This led to
the belief that he had killed himself, but
he was seen in San , Francisco on Sunday
by a .Stockton man. He has been gone
now two weeks. . It is not likely that he
will be prosecuted.
VANCOUVER SILVER BOOM.

' Excitement,
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. There is
a great silver excitement here. Just on
the other side of the city limit line sam
ples of silver ore running $30 to the ton
have been secured, and parties are pros
pecting and boring in the vicinity with
good prospects. Mayor Collins yesterday
stopped following the lead with a bore in
Stanley Park. This mine is a mile from
the city reserve, being property belonging
to the Dominion Government. Mean
while two companies, on the strength of
numerous finds recently, are organizing to
erect . smelters in the city. Away from

EXPELLED FROM. COLLEGE.
Fred R. Sherman, a Popular Student,
Suspended for Insubordination.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Feb. 13.â The faculty
of the University of the Pacific this morn
ing expelled Fred R. Sherman, one of the
most popular students in the college, on a
charge of insubordination.
The suspension grows out of the cele
bration of Chinese New Year by the stu
dents of east hall.
The firing of firecrackers during a recita
tion disturbed Professor Cross, and in his
search for the culprits he ran across Sher
man. The professor addressed Sherman
in a heated manner and received a sharp
reply, and it was for this that Sherman
was expelled.
Sherman had been a member of the uni
versity for two years and a half and was a
great favorite. He was a leader of all stu
dent enterprises and a prominent member
of the football team. .
The students are agitated over tbe sus
pension, and will mate an effort to have
him reinstated.

THE SAN* FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1896;
MARY HARRIS'
STRANGE DEATH
Investigating the Methods
of the Fountain Grove
Community.
THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY.
Where the Girl Was Kept a
' Prisoner Before She Took .
Her Own Life. I**1 **
CARRIED BY FORCE TO A ROOM.
Assistant District Attorney Butts'
Efforts to Throw Light
Upon the Case.
.SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 13.â
judicial probing into the mysterious
death of Mary Harris on January 2at the
Fountain Grove community has brought
to light some very strange things. For
instance, tbe dead girl was kept . a \ close
prisoner in. the "House of Mystery" for
T. J. Butts, Assistant District Attorney of Sonoma County, Who Is Conducting the
Investigation Into the Mysterious Death of Miss Harris at the Fountain .Grove
Colony. 'â¢"''". '-.'.,'. ,'-
ten days before she summoned courage or
desperation enough to take the deadly
draught that released; her from her un
happy life.
She was formerly kept under strict
watch in the Clark house, but was removed
by force to the house occupied by the two
Japanese, Nagasawa and Ari, and by Mrs.
Parting, her sister and two dughters.
Tnis house gained its mystical; designa
tion because it was the residence of
Thomas Lake Harris, the founder of the
colony, before he went to New York, a
couple of years ago.
' Nagasawa and Clark carried Mary Har
ris by force to her prison-room in the
"House of Mystery,'' and her meals were
brought to her there until the end.
All this was elicited by the cross-exam
ination of Mrs. Clark, who was asked why
Mary was removed to the Japanese resi
dence. She said it was to guard her the
better until word could be had from
Thomas Lake Harris making final dis
position of the girl. Harris had been
written to on the subject, and they were
waiting his orders.
When the Deputy Sheriff went to sub
pen a Pearl Harris for the Grand Jury
Clarke , refused to let the girl leave the
community until he was threatened with
arrest. ,
;It seems there were but two living wit
nesses to the death of Maryâ Nagasawa and
Miss-Parting. The .former has testified
before the Grand Jury, but the latter is
said to be too ill with nervous prostration
to leave the House of Mystery at present.
â¢Mary Harris .was a" Catholic, the faith of
her mother, and resisted to the last the
doctrines of Fountain Grove.
BEFORE THE â¢ GRAXD JURY.
Possible Indictment of Persons Connected
.With the Tragedy.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 13.â 1t is ex
pected that th. Grand Jury of Sonoma
County will adjourn sine die by to-morrow
"evening, and that then there will; come
report upon or possibly the indictment ; Of
some one connected with i the recent trag
edy at the Fountain Grove community; :;|
â¢ Since Tuesday last this body has been
investigating the cause of the death of
young Mary: Harris, and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Butts has been most ; per-*
sistent in his efforts to throw 3 some light!
upon the mysterious affair. And this has
been no easy task. ,
. In the first olace - the, Coroner's . investi
gationÃ were of the most perfunctory Kind.
On the .:â¢ day after ;. the ' tragedy .; Coroner
Young came from his home at Healdsburg
to the community. .' . :â .;'â  V V'' -' : '1
He impaneled a jury of six 'men, all: of |
whom were either :- members "-. or : trusted!
employes of the community. X' He did not'
summon "" the attend ing-w physician, : Dr.?
Thorn psqn, â¢of -this | city, nor any _ other '
medical expert. -* He heard the testimony
of -but three witnesses; all -high members'
of ' the community, and % then; his jury of
Fountain Groveites brought in a verdict of
suicide while despondent. />-* â 
A Now, as a matter of fact, although there
is only the word lof the Japanese manager
( Nagasawa),'^ corroborated ; by two women:
who: reside >; in the Harris? mansion t with ;
him and unsupported by all the other fifty
men l and i women on the premises, for the
theory of suicide, the general impression '
here is that the .'poor girl really did take
her own life. T rÂ±sut why? .-; " ' .a-'^ : A-:A)AaA
To most maidens of -sixteen who live
amid such beautiful and healthful natural
surroundings life lis' very , sweet, but this
maiden courted death. Some of the rea
sons have come out during.; the -Grand
Jury's investigations, and these seem to be
almost sufficient to account for the rash
act. She was kept a close 'prisoner.on the
second story of the big boarding-house. In
a whole year she was permitted to speak
to her younger sister, Pearl, but three
times. '
Both she and ' her sister were kept â  such
close prisoners - that scarcely any one in
Santa Rosa 1. knew until t the tragedy oc
curred that the two girls were at the com
munity. And yet almost daily the com
inunitv is visited by tradesmen and tour
ists, who are privileged â  to drive all about
the grounds, and same of whom are enter
tained very handsomely by Nagasawa. '>:
. Another fact that has leaked out is that
Mary Harris was detained at the. ranch
against her will. For a year she ' had
been trying, to escape. When she jumped
out â¢of a window twenty ' feet ; high, :as
already admitted by . Nagasawa, she was
in desperate rebellion against what must
have been to her a most cruel and un
natural existence.
Mrs. , Clark complained to the Grand
Jury that Mary was a self-willed : girl who
did not know how to mind, so she had to
be shut up and kept away from all sym
pathy ; and love. -These were not Mrs.
Clark's exact words, bnt the inference that
the jurors drew from them. .
The day after the tragedy Nagasawa
appeared at the office of the Republican,
in Santa Rosa, and announced to its editor
and proprietor, Mr. Lemmon, that "One
of those alleged granddaughters of Har
ris'" had committed suicide, and accom
panied the statement by the request that
, Mr. Lemmon should have the ' matter
treated in his paper as briefly as possible,
*- Indeed, the tragedy was kept rather
quiet for a time, and bad it not been for
the energy of Assistant District Attorney
Butts no further investigation would have
been held.
-The people of this city and county are
not greatlj excited over the occurrence,
for sensations and rumors of sensations in
connection with the Harris community
are old stories here. But they . are ar.x-
ions that the truth should be known in
this instance. *'
The witnesses before the Grand Jury so
far have been Miss* Babcock, a' sister of
Mrs.. Clark; Pearl Harris, the sister of
the dead girl; Kanai Nagasawa, the vice
primate, and Miss Clam*.
An indictment is not seriously appre
hended, for no witnesses have been beard
or seem to be obtainable, besides the in
terested persons. '
Pearl Harris is only 14 years old and has
the innocence and ignorance of a girl eight
years. She said her sister was always kind
and gentle to her, but she knew from what
others said that Mary must have been ob
stinate and willful, In truth, Mary seems
to have been a highstrung, sensitive girl,
who suffered much from ill health, brought
on by confinement and an unsanitary way
of living. ; / â¢ '
It seems to have been a case for the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty -to
Children to handle, but it is too late now.
_ Yet Pearl Harris is still a prisoner there.
She lived in the house with her sister and
yet was -not permitted' to see her. Even
when Mary lay at the point of death and
Pear) begged to be allowed to go to her,
she was restrained. y
That last word seems to have â  been the
keynote of the treatment accorded " the
girls. They were restrained in everything.
They lived in separate parts of the big
"boarding-house", habited by the Clarks,
and dared not even walk across to the
handsome and luxurious residence of the
vice-primate and the Partings, nor go out
in the fields and enjoy the sunshine and
the green things and flowers. ; They were
always "restrained."
The Grand Jury, it is expected, will re
turn a report to-morrow evening criticiz
ing : the management of the Fountain
Grove concern for the unnatural existence
and conditions it imposed upon the two
orphan girls, and holding it morally re
sponsible for the death; of the elder sister.
â¢ There are a great many rumors about to
the effect that.Mary; Harris took her life
as an alternative to indignities . that were
sought to be put ; upon â  her, but nothing
that has leaked, but of the Grand Jury
room . seems :to bear Tout this view. 'â¢< Dr.
Thompson is authority for the statement
that the dead girl led a pure life.:

A PECULIAR INVESTIGATION.
There Was No â  Expert Testimony at the
...- Coroner's Inquest. â 
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 13.â What
was, to say the ; least, a very peculiar cir
cumstance in connection with the myste
rious death of Mary. Harris at the Fountain
Grove Farm, is the fact that there was no
expert testimony adduced at the coroner's
investigation, and yet the cause . of death,
"irom strychnine poisoning iby her own
band .; with Buicidal ; intent,, while A under
despondency," is stated in the jury's ver-.
diet . with . a certainty arid in terms that
cohld*'only -be knowingly asserted either
by the medical attendant who was present
at the deathbed or ;by post morten ex
amination.
y." Recourse was had " by the jury to neither,
of these scientific sources of information,
though. both were available. *. * ;
It is true that there was no autopsy
held, but one might easily have been held;
for the jury was impaneled < arid rendered
its verdict on the day (following '.the even
ing of J her death. However, ; there was a
medical attendant, Dr. Charles L' Thomp
son of this city. . . .:: -'"'
He arrived? at the scene a few minutes,
after the girl expired.; . For - the last
eighteen years he has been -the physician 1
in attendance at the colony,' and it is only,
fair to state that his -opinion as to the
. :.:'". " â â -â â .'A-..*-..-. .-.-..; a Â-.. 'A-'A'a!.
"cause^of Miss Harris' death agrees i in- the
main yfrith the Coroner's jury's verdict.
; However, Dr. Thompson does not f state
it as a"3 fact ; that â¢ the > strychnine was self
administered or that it was; taken with
suicidal intent, or that it was taken dur
ing a fit of despondency. Yet Dr. Thomp
son, a'man'hefd in "; good esteem through
out the county, is inclined to believe that
these were the circumstances surrounding
the tragedy and that there - are no ill
doings at Fountain Grove, no unlawful nor
immoral practices there; that there never
has been and could not be so long as the
colony is under its present â - management.
But Dr. Thompson, the only expert wit
ness available, was not called upon to
testify before the Coroner's jury. .And, as
a medical man, he admits that he was
surprised at not being* called upon.
* The truth is that the verdict was ren
dered imprecisely the same words as those
used by the Japanese , vice primate and
present supreme ruler of the colony,
Kanai Nagasawa. . .
r The jury was impaneled about noon of
January 3, at Fountain Grove farm, and
was composed of two inmates of the insti
tution, L. Cowles and Ray P., Clark, and.
four employes of the farm, S. C. Gum, F.
M. Harris, John . Fields and: J. S. Turk.
Only one of these six â  names is on the
Great Register of Sonoma County, that of
Mr. Gunn.
The first witness heard was Kauai Nag
asawa, whose sworn and attested evidence
'is as follows: ';* A "'A. '.'"
I am one of the firm of â¢ the Fountain Grove
Vineyard Company. Miss .Parting heard
screams and called me, so we, Miss Parting
and myself, went upstairs and found Miss Har
ris sitting in a chair. She seemed to . be in;
great agony, and I took her in my arms and
placed heron the bed.
I held her hands, as I saw she was having
convulsions. She said she was going to die,
and said she had taken poison [strychnine.]
We administered white of egg, mustard and
warm water and sweet oil, but could not re
lieve her. '
She told us where the poison was to be found
and we found it.
She said she had only taken just a little, end
I think she did not realize what she was doing.
Do not think she intended to take her own
life.
I think she only tried to frighten us.
She has at times seemed despondent and In
sane. She at one time jumped out of a win
dow some twenty feet high.
It was some three months ago. She was
about 16 years of age and a native of Montana,
and I know of no trouble she had ever had
with any one. lAm satisfied she took her own
life while under despondency.
K. Nagasawa. '
Sworn to the 3d day of January, 1896.
Tom G. Young, Coroner.
Only two other witnesses were heard.
Miss Parting came first.' Her testimony
was as follows: â¢':â¢'*. -â â¢:-/
My name is Miss Parting, and I live here on
the place. I was present at the time of Miss
Harris' death. I know nothing more than that
that Mr. Nagasawa has testified to, only we
sent for Dr. . Thompson. He came, and Miss
Harris was dead. He -said that there was no
doubt she had taken poison. She has been ail
ing for some time, and Dr. Thompson has been
attending to her; and I corroborate the same
testimony as that of Mr. K. Nagasawa. Signed,
M. E. Parting.
â  Sworn to this 3d day of January, 1896.
Tom G. Young, Coroner.
Mrs. Parting, the mother of the preced
ing witness, testified as follows:
1 live here on the ranch, and know nothing
more than has been testified to, and corrobor
ate the same testimony. Emma Parting.
Sworn to this 3d day of January, 1896.
Tom G. Young, Coroner.
1 This concluded the investigation, and
almost before any one outside of the col
ony knew of the ' tragedy the following
: verdict was rendered and signed, all ac
cording to law:
Death caused from strychnine poisoning by
her own hand with suicidal intent while
under despondency. -
Tom G. Young, Coroner.
S. C. Gum, F. M. Harris, John Fields, J. S.
Turk, L. Cowles, R. P. Clark.
Dr. Thompson was notified by telephone
about 6 o'clock on the evening of January
3. He was simply told that he was wanted
at Fountain Grove at once. , It was impos
sible for him to proceed directly there, as
he had an urgent case elsewhere, and when
he did arrive at the colony he. found Miss
Harris dead. Those about her, Nagasawa
and Mrs.,Partinc .told!. him substantially
.what they told the Coroner's jury. ".". v._r -f
SCRAMBLE AT WOODLAND

WOODLAND. Cal., Feb. 13.â Lively in

friends for the postmastership of this
city. Among those prominently men
tioned are Professor C. E. Dingle, E. T.
Huston, H. Deaner and Attorney Byron

Two of the number have already sent
voluminously signed petitions on to
Washington in the fullest and firmest
confidence that action will* be taken and a
successor to F. M. Rahm.the incumbent,
appointed next month.' But in this the
petitioners are doomed to disappointment.
; /in their eagerness ' to secure an annual
salary of $2000 ; they â  have incorrectly
figured on the expiration of the incum
bent's term of office.
By, reason of a disagreement by the rep
resentatives in Congress in 1892 to decide
on ex-Postmaster J. T.-McConneU'e suc
cessor, Rahm did not secure his appoint
ment till March 6, 1893, and, as he was
commissioned for four years, his term of
office will not expire till March 6, 1897.
The would-be postmasters are still chas
ing hallucinations and are* wondering who
of their number will next month .be
awarded the coveted prize." But there will
be a dawning when "The: Call reaches

A CHAPTER OF
MISFORTUNES.
The Tragic End of a Once

of Sixty-Five.
LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO.
Driven to Desperation the Unfortu
nate Man Fires a Bullet Into
His Breast.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 13.â John
Tapley Jr. shot himself this morning and
died to-night. His life was a chapter of
misfortunes with a violent finale. He
was one of Vancouver's pioneers, em
barked in business and succeeded. Besides
a large confectionery-store he has a block
of rooms rented to lodgers.
Some months rto his eldest daughter, a
beautiful girl of 20, ran away with an im
pecunious lodger. Then the tongue of
scandal became busy with his family.
The next calamity was the desertion of
Tapley by his wife. She fled to San Fran
cisco with a gray-headed man of 65, and
the guilty pair are now said to be residing
there with Mr. Tapley's two remaining
daughters. .. t â¢â¢;.-'
. Tapley. broken down in health, became
despondent and hopeless, and through
some dishonest act was placed in jail.
This drove him io desperation and he de
liberately planned to take his life. Calling
his aged mother to bis bedside and speak
ing of his unfaithful wife he cried, "Flos
sie is the cause of all my trouble, and i
love her yet."
He then gave bis mother a long message
for his wife and on his mother attempting
to console him he continued:
{ 'â It is too late now ; prepare yourself for
something that is going to happen. Tell
Flossie all about it."
He then placed the revolver to his breast
ana fired. His mother's screams brought
passers-by to her side.
They took the dying man to the hospital.
Though conscious all day he refused to
make any further statement, and it is said
that he died in possession of certain secrets
in connection with an alleged arson case
that the authorities were anxious to get.

C. H. Hubbard, Mayor of Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 13. -la
early days Sacramento, being the cen
tral point of departure for the mining dis
tricts -throughout the Sierra foothills,
proved a greater attraction for the invest
ment of mercantile capital than any other
point on the coast, and for a few brief
years her growth was phenomenal and
the wealth of her : merchants in
creased without parallel. Then came a
period of dull times when the mines
became exhausted, when thousands,
rich beyond their wildest expectations,
forsook the hurly-burly of California life
for their peaceful homes in Eastern States.
Then many of the larger and wealthier
firms deserted for the greater advantages
of the Pacific metropolis, and then for a
period came almost utter stagnation in j
business circles. But not for any great
length of time could this continue. Situated I
at the outlet of one of the richest farming
and fruit-producing valleys on the coast,
Sacramento soon became the shipping
center of these industries which sprang
into life like magic, on the decline of the
mining industries.
Possessing six lines of railroad which ra
diate in all directions, and direct river com
munication with the metropolis and all
foreign countries, the city can but be
come the leading commercial city of the
interior, and that such is becoming a recog
nized fact is evinced by the wonderful
growth and prosperity of the business in
terests of the city and the rapid erection
of magnificent residences in all portions
of this municipality.
Even the downtown precincts are rap-

idly recognizing the benefits accruing
through the increase in tiade and the in
troduction of new blood and enterprise,
and many firms have been compelled
to erect new structures and additions in
order to accommodate their growing in
terests. Notably is this the fact in the case
of Weinstock & Lubin, one of the largest
and most enterprising firms on the coast.
But a few short years since they erected a
magnificent three-story building and now
find themselves so crowded that they have
been compelled to build as an addition a
four-story building to accommodate their
monthly increasing trade. In fact, in all
directions, and on nearly every block of
the main .business portion of the city
there have been erected either some
magnificent new structure or some sub
stantial addition which will long prove
monuments to the enterprise and push of
Sacramento's solid business men.
The business . fraternity of Sacramento
to-day are men of brains and intellect:
men who fully appreciate the unparalleled
advantages possessed by this city; men
ready to seize every advantage which may
arise that will prove advantageous to this
locality and who are always willing to
contribute substantially in a financial way
to everything beneficial to the community
at large. ; "â â 
During the past year a Chamber of Com
merce has been organized, the object of
which is to foster trade, commerce and the
economic interest of the city and county
of Sacramento; to assist and encourage'
home industries and manufactures; to in
duce immigration and the subdivision and
settlement of lands, and generally to pro

mote development of the agricultural,
I horticultural, mining and other resources
iof Central and Northern California. It is
proposed to procure a site and erect a suit
able building for the use of the chamber,
and it is claimed that the building will be
a model of architectural beauty and finish.
The chamber has standing committees
on commerce, manufactures, immigration
and lands, mines and mining, ways and
j means, statistics and library, laws and
j legislation, hotels, parks and public im
provements, exhibits, reception and county
and municipal affair-'. Toe members
forming these committees are sterling busi
ness men of the city and county, who have
been carefully selected for their individual
aptitude for performing the duties en
tailed upon them.
The president of the chamber, Hon. Jo
seph Steffans, has lone been identified
with every enterprise which has been, in
troduced looking to the promotion of the
growth and prosperity of this city and
has always been foremost among the lead
ers. Formerly president of the Sacra-
I mento Board of Trade he has accomplished
I a great work in the development of not
only this city, but also of Central and
.Northern California; a thoroughly in
formed and far-seeing financier he has al
ways been foremost in contributing to the
welfare of the community at large.
One of the leading attributes to the
future prosperity of this city is the mag
nificent electric power, which affords facili
ties for manufacturing not exceeded in
any city in the United States. This power
is generated at Folsom, some twenty miles,
distant and is transmitted to this city over
j a system of copper wires to an immense
j power-house lately constructed, where it
is received and distributed to any part
j of the city where it may be needed.
In preparing their plans for the intro
j duction of this power into Sacramento the
j promoters of the scheme foresaw the neces-
I sity of guarding against any possible stop
i page of the plant under "any and all cir
'â  cumstances. To attain this object they
provided for two lines of transmission,
each entirely distinctive from the other.
These consist of ten lines of copper wire
erected on separate rows of poles, and
either line possessing a carrying capacity
sufficient to transmit the entire product of
the plant situated at Folsom to the Sacra
mento terminus. By. this precaution,
should one line become disabled, the cur
rent can be instantly switched on to the
I other system without a moment's cessa
tion of the main plant, and the same
amount of precaution has been displayed
in the arrangement of the various genera
tors and dynamos within the interior of
the power-house, every one being soar
ranged that should breakage occur in any
one machine -it can be instantly detached
from the main olant without stoppage.
Through these precautions a steady, never
failing source of generation has been as
sured, and the chance of stoppage to the
machinery driven by this power has been
reduced to a minimum.
At the present time this great plant has
a capacity of 4000 horsepower, although as
yet but one-fourth of that amount is being
used. But the company is rapidly extend
ing its facilities of introduction, and every
day new contracts are being made with
various local industries.
The draw in the new bridge which spans
the Sacramento River at this point will be
operated by a motor connected by wire
with the power-house, as will be the large
I fruit elevator of the Southern Pacific Com
pan}*. Negotiations are under way look
j ing to the introduction of the power into
the immense shop plant of the Southern
; Pacific Company, and it will be a matter
! of but a few months until the mysterious
\ fluid entirely- supersedes steam in the ope- i
| rations of this vast mechanical plant. In
all parts of the business portion of the
city the interior of the stores are lighted i
by incandescent lights furnished from this
source, and as the huge plant is operated
night and day light is obtainable at all
hours.
At the present time the company has
over 2000 incandescent light? in operation
and are also lighting the streets of the city
with a system of 229 arc lights. There are
also 80 commercial arc lights in constant
use in various business houses, and. it is
the intention of the managers to extend
their system of residence lighting as rap
idly as possible.
Over thirty local business and manu
facturing firms are now using motors ope
! rated by this power and there are numer
: ous applications on file from other enter-
I prises for power facilities which will be
j furnished as rapidly as the necessary mo
j tors can be manufactured. This power
can be positively obtained in steady
and sufficient volume and at a price rate
! that will reimburse Eastern enterprise suf
| ficiently to warrant the abandonment of
old-time plans and "locations. The present
ratio of prices adopted by the electric com
pany has been based on the standard of
power prices in Kansas City, conceded by
all authorities on the subject to be the
cheapest attainable power in the United I
States. This ratio ranges from $10 per
month for single horsepower to $5 per
month, depending altogether upon the
amount required ; and as a further induce
ment the company is prepared to offer a
: reduction of 10 per cent on these rates for
! the introduction of new industries, thus
placing the power at such a low figure as
I to be a temptation not to . be slighted by
! any manufacturing enterprise large or
i small.
Another great inducement to investment
I of Eastern capital already employed in
localities where only expensive power can
be secured is the action which has been
taken by the Citizens' Industrial Improve
ment Association, with the' hearty co-ope
i ration of the property-owners of the city,
I in formulating a fund by an assessment of
i Hot 1 per cent on all taxable property,
sad fund to be used in assisting to defray
j the expenses consequent upon the re

moval of plants to this city, and to assist
in procuring suitable locations for the same.
Although the Electric Power and Light
Company has an ' immense surplus of un
used power at their disposal at the present
tune, yet they have positive assurance
that within a few brief months nearly the
entire amount will be , profitably em
ployed, and they are already making
preparations to . double the capacity of
their plant, which can easily* be done by
using their second fall at the original
power-house situated at Folsom. This
will give them 8000 horsepower in all
sufficient to meet all manufacturing and
other needs for several years to come.
Sacramento is essentially a city of
homes, the tenement system of the "East
never having been introduced in this lo
cality, and from the wealthy business
man and capitalist whose magnificent
residence is surrounded by extensive and
handsomely adorned grounds, to the more
unpretentious cottage of the sturdy artisan
with its miniature lawn, flowering shrubs
and semi-tropical plants, each vie with
the other in adding to the beauty of the
city. It is apparently the ambition of
every mechanic and laborer to own his
own residence and to beautify its sur
roundings as far as his time and means
allow. In point of costly mansions and
elegant cottages of the wealthy Sacra
mento excels any city of the same popula
tion on the coast.
Nor are these latter edifices grouped in
any one locality ; on the contrary, they are
scattered throughout the city and are con

j nected with the business portion by an
| extensive and excellently conducted sys
-1 tern of electric cars, which, running at an
average rate of speed of eight miles an
hour, convey the business man from his
office to his home in a few minutes. This
electric car system threads the city in all
directions and is so carefully planned and I
laid out that there is scarcely a residence
which cannot be reached in a few minutes'
walk from some car line, the entire system
being operated by power generated at the
Folsom power-house.
" In all Sacramento there is not one rough
narrow street. On the contrary, the thor
oughfares are broad macadamized or bi
tuminized avenues, which, throughout the
residence portions, are lined with rows of
magnificent elms and other shade trees,
which add greatly to the city's beauty. To
a great extent the smooth streets of Sacra
mento have contributed to the popularity
of the bicycle as a means of locomotion,
and there is no place on the coast where
the silent steed is more universally used.
One of the greatest points of interest to
the visitor, one of the chief outing resorts
to the resident and a substantial adorn
ment to Sacramento is the great white
Capitol building, with its surrounding
park of thirty-five acres artistically laid
out in walks and drives, terraces and lawns,
and containing trees of rare beauty, whose
foliage remains perennially green.
Gathered from every portion of the known
world, here side by side may be found
cedars from the Himalaya, pines from
Asia and South America, the native
sequoia giganta, bananas, fan palms,
magnolias and other species too numerous
to mention. Under the efficient manage
ment of State Gardener Dunn, who is one
of the best-informed men on floriculture
in the State, these grounds have been
made a dream of beauty.
This is the favorite evening resort of all,
and its attractions are enhanced on sum
mer evenings by free musical concerts.
The city possesses. other breathing spots,
also deservedly popular, but not to com
pare in the affections of the residents with
this. . v -
One of the most important adjuncts of
the city's prosperity in the past has been
the shops of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, probably the most complete
| plant of a like nature in the United States.
These shops and yards cover forty acres
and are equipped with all the latest modern
machinery, and employ in the neighbor
hood of 2500 men.
The motive power used in running these
extensive shops consists of twenty-five
stationary engines having a capacity of
1500 horsepower, sixteen large steam
pumps, twelve . steam hammers and
twenty-five stationary steam boilers, all of
which, it is expected, will shortly be super
seded by electric motors.
-Among the many manufacturing in
terests which have been attracted to
Sacramento by reason of central location
and shipping advantages but few are of
more importance than the Buffalo Brew
ing Company, who ; give steady employ
ment to -over 100 men all the year round
and* distribute over $75,000 in salaries.
Frank Ruhstaller's City Brewery is also
an important factor in the city's indus
tries, being one of the largest steam beer
plants on the coast, giving employment to
over 100 men and having an output of
100,000 barrels per year. This is not only
one of the largest breweries, but one of the
most complete in all its furnishings, the
entire building being fitted throughout
with refrigerating pipes, so that even in
the hottest weather the interior can be
kept :at any desired temperature. The
entire plant is under the personal super
vision of Captain Ruhstaller, whose palatial
residence is in such close proximity that
he : can be reached at any s moment :if
necessary. . \ . . "' â¢ >
The milling industry of Sacramento is
important and no locality 'in the State is
better adapted- to fulfill -all the require
ments needed, the city being a railroad
center and situated on the Sacramento
River, that : magnificent, stream which
connects it with, the greatest grain-pro
' ducing area of the State. There are al
ready some of the largest milling plants
in the State situated at this point and the
field is by no '. means ' exhausted. The
meat-packing ;: interests are already well
represented in this city and their products
are becoming known throughout the State.
The lumber-planing mills and -box fac
tories '-' of ' this r city form A, a source of
great revenue," which r will be largely en
hanced by. the extensive â¢ plant of the
American -Land, and Lumber Company,
situated at ? Folsom, whose yearly output
must center in Sacramento. This is an
entirely hew enterprise, originated in con
junction with the Electric Power _ Com-
pany, ; and whose ) yearly." log ' drive down
tie" turbulent current ' , of ' the American
River? consists of millions of -feet of , the
clearest sugar pine ; lumber ; taken from a
district of virgin 'pine forests which have
never, before echoed the ring of the wood
man's ax or the buzz of the crosscut saw."
This successful enterprise, already cross
ing the threshold^ completion, has been
projected on an extensive - basis that' will
successfully, vie with any other of a like
nature on the entire Pacific slope. \ It has
cost millions; 'it will produce millions. Its
cost came from other localities; its pro
ductions will in the main benefit this lo
cality. '-'â *-'
The fruit-canning industry is largely
represented in this city and affords in sea
son employment to hundreds of women
and children, but there la always\room in
this field for the introduction of capital
with a- certainty of abundance of materia!
at reasonable rates which will yield a fair
return on investments.
On the outskirts of the city there is an
industry which is more than an important
factor "in the furtherance '.of the city's
growth and an added incentive- to the
i establishment of manufacturing interest*
at this point, as it insures an abundance cf
building material at rates as low, if not
lower, than can be procured elsewhere
the brick-making industry. In one yard
alone are produced nearly ' 30,000,000 brick
annually, and all the modern appliances
are possessed by the owners of the plant to
manufacture any grade of this building
material desired and in anyquantitv.
Without doubt what will eventually be
an important factor in promoting the
growth of trade in this city is the contem
plated electric line of railroad which is
shortly to be built for a distance of over
twenty miles into one of the richest farm
ing and fruit producing districts of the
surrounding country. The assurance that
this road would be built in the near future
has resulted|in the establishment of a large
colonization scheme a few miles from the
city, which hss already a substantial
nucleus of bright, energetic Eastern men,
whose brains and brawn will add materi
ally to the welfare of * the city, and whose
glowing accounts of soil and "climate sent
to home friends the East are rapidly re
sulting in inducing others to abandon
their homes ; and settle in this favored
locality.
. This electric line taps a fruit-producing
j area second to none in the State, where
I not only all the ordinary fruits can be pro
j duced, but where the orange and lemon
! prow and mature with but little >if any
' danger of blighting frosts. Vegetables
j can also be grown with but little irriga
tion, and the rapid facilities of transporta
tion to a central market can but prove
a source of immediate revenue to any. who |
may engage in their production. This
I will also afford an added incentive to
: the establishment of canning and fruit
drying establishments at this place. This
city is probably the best equipped on the
coast in point of local telephonic com- !
munication. :â¢};**- y" 'â¢';- y â  ./; :,-/'â ;;;â .:' >,
The recent incorporation of i the ; Capital
Telephone and Telegraph Company, which
has been organized by a number' of pro
gressive citizens and business men of this
locality, and is in successful operation, has
raised a spirit of competition between it !
i and the Bell Telephone Company, which j
has resulted in such a reduction of rates as i
to place the instruments within the reach i
of all, and they are being rapidly introduced I
into the residences in all portions of the j
city. ;; /''"^'i^'y'y-
In point of social, religious and educa- !
tional advantages Sacramento ranks in the i
foreground in comparison with any city of
Northern California. Over twenty-five !
churches and religious societies, of almost I
every denomination, own handsome cdi- J
fices within its limits, and the newly erected â¢
Catholic cathedral is famed throughout the j
State for the beauty of its architecture and
the completeness of interior arrangements. I
The secret and benevolent societies of :
the city are legion. The Masonic frater- i
nity is represented by ten lodges, chap- i
ters and comraanderies. The Odd Fellows j
have thirteen lodges, encampments and |
] cantons. *â¢ The Knights of Pythias possess i
I eight departments of the order. The Im- I
j proved Order of Red Men of lour separate
tribes hold counsel and smoke the pipe of
peace. The Grand Army of the Republic is
represented by six posts, circles and corps.
The United Orderof Druids. Native Daugh
ters, Good Templars, United Workmen,
Chosen Friends and sundry other orders
all have representation in the city, while
the energy and push of the Native Sons of
the Golden West of Sacramento have been
fully exemplified and are appreciated from
one end of the State to the other.
If there is any. one attribute of the city
in which the citizens take deserved pride
it is the magnificent educational system
which has been fostered and promoted by
their enterprise and devotion to the en
couragement of learning. From the kin
dergarten to the high , school the system
is absolutely complete, and the latter in
stitution, under the able management of
Professor Pond, is becoming known all
over the State for its thorough course of ed
ucational advantages.
At the beginning of the present term it
was found to be an impossibility to ac
commodate all the applicants for admis
sion, many of whom "came from other
cities. The system at the present time
embodies ten primary schools, four free'
kindergartens, four grammar schools and
the high schools. Besides these there are
several private institutions of learning
and business colleges. The School of De
sign, under the management of vV. V.
Jackson, has attained a State-wide popu
larity. It was organized for the purpose
of teaching designing and the pictorial
art, and has facilities for all desirous of
studying drawing and painting in all its

This school is under the management of
the California Museum Association, an in
corporated society for scientific, literary
and artistic pursuits. It is not conducted
for profit, and the entire income is devoted
to tne school. It is located in the Crocker
Art Gallery, a beautiful building on spa
cious* grounds, filled with works of both
modern and ancient masters, besides thou
sands of studies. Its art school and class
rooms are the j finest in the country; its
collection of casts and school appliances
is complete and modern. \ This is also a fa
vorite place of resort for citizens.
One of the 'handsomest business houses
which has been erected during' the past
year is the Joseph- building, erected by
Architect James Seadler, who for years
past has ranked as a. leading architect of
Sacramento, and has many evidences of his
skill scattered through various counties of
Northern California. This building is sit
uated on the northeast corner of Sixth
and; X; streets, and i 3 three stories in
height, with ; a basement. The structure
is of brick, faced with Redding stone. On
the first floor, there are three stores. The
second floor has sixteen office-rooms, and
the third is arranged for three apartments
of rive rooms each, with baths, etc. This
building was erected by Silas Carle, a
contractor who is well known through
out , Northern and â  Central : . Califor
nia, and who has constructed the ma
jority of the handsomest buildings in
the city of Sacramento. He has also
been identified with large building inter
ests of various kinds â flumes, bridges,
etc. and probably gives employment to
as many skilled artisans as any man in
Sacramento County.
The building in question has a very com
plete system of ventilation and plumbing,
this worK having been performed by
George Stack, who is considered one of the
leading men in the plumbing line in this
city.' â¢â 
All the glazing, both in the Joseph build
ing and the Weinstock & Lubin annex,
was done by the Sullivan-Kelly Company,
one of the largest giass and paint houses

on the coast. The upper portion of the
building is furnished throughout with
leaded glass,, of which this firm makes a
specialty, possessing one of the most com
plete plants for manufacturing this product
of any firm on the coast, and giving em
ployment to a large number of men. Their
manufactory is situated in Sacramento
and is the best equipped plant of the kind i
in the State.
The Joseph building when entirely com- }
pleted will cost $25,000. The same parties j
are erecting and finishing the annex to the |
Weinstock & Lubin store. This annex
is a four-story brick structure 60x1(10 and
will cost when completed $27,000. It will;
be used for general warerooms, depart
ment offices, etc.
It is impossible to make mention of all j
the magnificent structures which have j
been erected during the past year, some â 
400 in number, or over one per day, all of j
which are monuments to the push and j
enterprise of their owners and show the |
abiding faith they possess in the outlook j
for the future of Sacramento, which has j
so fitly been named the Queen City of the i
interior.
There are four libraries' and reading- i
rooms in the city, to nearly all of which I
any one may obtain access. The main
library is owned by the State and is situ- |
ated in the Capitol building. This is the
third largest library in the United States, I
containing over 98,000 volumes, many of
which are rare and costly. The Odd Fel- \
lows fraternity also have a large collection j
of literary works, and the Public Library, I
which has been lately enlarged and im- <
proved, contains about 27,000 volumes.
The public affairs of the city are pre- j
sided over by a Mayor and Board of I
nine Trustees. Charles E. Leonard, pres- j
ent President of the board, is a thoroughly |
practical business man, conservative and
sound in his convictions, . unfaltering in
his duty and in his faith- in the bright
future of the city. The other members of
the board are men of like brains and capac
ity, and they are all combined as a unit to
forward the best interests of the common- j
wealth. C.H.Hubbard, the present Mayor, |
although but lately inaugurated, has
already fully demonstrated his ability in |
directing the affairs of the city, and is a i
financier who without doubt will solve the j
problem of an economical administration.
Sacramento possesses a Fire Depart- ;
ment, presided over by a Chief who has
amply demonstrated in the" past his ability
to cope with any conflagration, and in
consequence insurance rates throughout
the city are as low, if not lower, as in any
other city on the coast.
The Police Department, presided over by
Chief M. M. Drew, is composed of active, I
conscientious men, who, although â  few in I
number, have proved themselves capable
of handling such of the. criminal element
as may be hardy enough to attempt to
gain a foothold in the city.
In conjunction- with the police station
there is a receiving hospital for the treat
ment of accidental cases of injury, and ]
the patrol wagon, which is in service at
all times, is fitted with all the approved
appliances of a modern ambulance.
, The County Hospital, situated on the
outskirts of the city, . affords accommoda
tion for 225 patients, and under the effi
cient supervision of Dr. White has the
reputation of being the best conducted in
stitution of its nature on the coast, admis
sion being eagerly sought for by the un
fortunates of all surrounding counties, and
it is an authenticated fact that more appli
cations for admission to the institution are
received from the sick and afflicted of these
.than from within the boundaries of the
county which maintains it.
There is within the city limits a private
hospital where all home comforts are pro
curable, and the Railroad Hospital is also
situated in this city. Much has been
wrongfully said in the past of the preva
lence of malaria in the city and yet veri
fied statistics prove that Sacramento
ranks as the second city in the United
States in point of health.
Of banking institutions Sacramento
possesses five, namely: â¢" The California
State Bank, with a capital of $350,000.
Its president, Frederick Cox, and cashier,
William E. Gerber, stand foremost among
the progressive element of the city, and
are already among the ranks of those
anxious to promote and foster the intro
duction- of new manufacturing interests
in .this locality. The Farmers' and Mer
chants' Savings Bank has a. guaranteed
capital of $500,000, and to its president,
B. U. Steinman, formerly Mayor of the
city, may be traced many of the existing
reforms in the city's government, and !
nearly all of its late public improvement?, j
The National bank of D. O. Mills is one |
of the most substantial institutions on the I
coast and has a capital of $600,000. Its
president, Frank Miller, is also included
in the ranks of progress. The People's
Savings Bank has a paid-up capital o I
Charles E. Leonard, President of thÂ«
Board of Trustees.
$225,000 gold coin, and its president, Wil
liam Beckman, is strongly identified with
the city's best interests.
The Sacramento Bank possesses a guar
anteed capital of $500,000, and is the
oldest institution of its kind in Sacramento.
Its enterprising president, W. P. Coleman,
is quietly in accoid with every progressive
plan presented and is unsurpassed in en
terprise and advancement.
The real estate firms of Sacramento have
done and are doing much to forward the
material interests of this city and its
immediate locality, and no class of citi
zens in the city are more prominent in
receiving and entertaining strangers and
affording them opportunities of closely
examining the many advantages offered
by the locality for settlement; nor is it
essential that the visitor should be a pros
pective purchaser. The mere fact that he
is a stranger calls forth all their hospitality,
as it did with their forefathers in the days
of old. Among the foremost firms in this
line are E. L. Hawk and Edwin K. Alsip,
The latter firm at the present time is
handling the interests of the Sunset
Colony. There are others of great worth
and prominence.
The tax rate on city property is not now
as low as in some few other cities on the
coast, but with the steady income derived
from the water works, which more than
suffices to defray all the current expenses,
it is an assured fact that within two years
the city's debt will be wiped out and the
tax rate will be reduced to a minimum.
- Such is a brief list of the manifold ad
vantages offered by this locality to those
of our Eastern brethren who, weary of the
constant struggle with frosts and droughts,
seek openings for the establishment of a
home in this favored clime.
Such is Sacramento, a city with th*
Joseph Stef fan. President of the Chamber
of Commerce.
brightest augury of any in the State of
California, a city whose manufactories
will before many years produce all the
necessities which to-day are procured
from the East. Nor as a manufacturing
city will its clear sky be darkened with
clouds of smoke, the buildings grimed
with soot, for the motive power will be
electricity, that quiet, clean, mysterious
agency, whose capabilities Â»re just begin
ning to be understood.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. <
Quay is in the ling, and there \3 room
for one more.
The next thing is to get ready for Wash
ington's birthday.
# â
Pennsylvania is determined to be known
as the Quaystone State. '
It is pleasing to learn that Huntington
is blocked, but we wish to see him stumped.
It used to be "Lincoln and emancipa
tion," but now it is "Lincoln and protec
tion."
The Republican party is offered Quay
for a valentine, but Democracy is still
hunting for somebody.
Huntington once boasted he had never
dropped a quarter, but it now looks as if
he would drop his whole wad.
It is evident that among reviving things
we are to have this year a revival of the
inspiration of Abraham Lincoln.
The reported discovery of the north pole
is one of the thing? we must put under the
cathode ray to find out what is in it.
The Chinese claim to have now driven
out the devil for a year, but it won't be
long before they begin to raise him again.
From the record of Wednesday it is evi
dent we need no National law to provide
for the observance of the birthday of Lin
coln.
Perhaps the only sure way to get the
scandals out of the Custom-house would
be to make a clean sweep including the
officials.
The poolroom fakes think they are
fighting for life, but really they are going
through a spasmodic struggle in the throes
of death.
It is announced that Mrs. Lease will be
come a preacher, and accordingly we may
expect from Kansas a new religion with
frills on it.
Smuggling Chinese women for illicit
purposes into this City and then passing
them off as native daughters is a clear case
of adding insult to injury.
"A bond-issuing, gold-depleting, debt
increasing, labor-destroying low-tariff pol
icy" is what .McKinley called it, and he
called it by the right name.
The battle for the improvement of Fol
som street is virtually but just begun.
The chief part of the fight will be to see
that the work is well done.
At last the Senate promises us a com
mittee to investigate the bond deals and
now we may expect to see how the thing
looks when turned inside out.
If Gladstone should re-en Parliament
to demand justice for Armenia it might he
not only a dramatic stroke in politics but
the impulse to a new crusade.
Krueger will visit other capitals as well
as London, and does not intend to pose as
a British colonial show when he can make
himself an international exposition.
The inspiration of Lincoln animates the
spirit of the Republican party and all that
his glorious example stands for that party
represents in American politics to-day.
General WeyJer's arrival in Havana has
been followed by the aggressive movement
he promised, but not in the way he prom
ised, for it was the Cubans who made it.
It seems that Krueger applied to Ger
many for aid and the Kaiser's famous-let
ter was not an impromptu attempt to
tickle the British lion as a passing caprice.
The original draft of the legislative pro
test against the funding bill has been
found, and now the question arises whether
it was hidden away or just lost in the
shuffle.

If the Republican speeches on Lincoln's
day were bound in the same volume with
the Democratic speeches on Jackson's day
the Republican party would ask no better
compaign document.
The voice of the orators at the Lincoln
banquets in all parts of the country formu
lated the course of the Republican cam
paign. The issue is protection to industry
and labor and the battle-cry is "America
for Americans."
With the Goulds, the Vanderbilts and
the Atchison system competing with Hun
tington to get the Central Pacific, it seems
clear the Government will get a good deal
more out of it than two streaks of rust and
right of way. â¢ v ,
It is reported that the House Committee
on Territories is opposed to the admission
of Arizona because her people would send
two silver men to the Senate, and if this
be true it will make one more issue for the
Greater West to settle with the goldbugs.
If -the proposal to make the birthdays of
Lincoln and Jackson j National holidays is
carried out we shall have to put in nearly
all the time from Christmas to the end of
February in celebrating - and will . hardly

The abolition of class B racers by the
American League of Wheelmen seems on
the face to be a good move. A racer in" the
nature of : things must be either a profes
sional or an amateur, and there was little
fairness in having a class ' that straddled
the track as well as the bicycle.
-
IMPERISHABLE. PRINCIPLES. '
It is instructive, to note with what en
thusiasm and unanimity the various meet
ings held throughout the country to cele
brate the birthday of Abraham Lincoln
recalled those elements of his policy which
are still living issues before the people.
This' is 'because the principles which he
advocated belong to every time and peo
ple and are the foundations of liberty and
prosperity.
; At the Chicago celebration ex-Governor
McKinley referred to a series of resolutions
introduced by Lincoln at a Whig meeting
in Springfield held March 1, 1843, and then
to Lincoln's platform adopted May 17, 1860,
by the second convention held by the Re
publican' National Convention. As his
sentiments on the subject of the tariff were
expressed in both, only the latterâ that
which became a principle of the Republi
can party at its birthâ .need be quoted here.
It is this:
"Resolved, That while providing revenue
| for the support of the general Government
j by duties on imports sound policy requires
! such an adjustment of these imports as to
1 encourage the development of the indus
trial interests of the whole country; and
we recommend that policy of national ex
changes which secures to the workingman
liberal wages, to agriculture remunerative
prices, to mechanics and manufacturers an
adequate reward for their skill, labor and
enterprise, and to the Nation commercial
prosperity and independence."
Protection and wise reciprocity are both
clearly stated in that old platform in
spired by Lincoln's genius and patriotism.
As Mr. McKinley wisely remarked: "Bet
ter protection no Republican could ask or
desire. The Republican party is competent
to carry this policy into effect. When
ever there is anything to be done for this
country it is to the Republican party we
must look to have it done. We are not
contending for any particular tariff law or
laws or for any special schedules or rates,
but for the great principle the American
protective policy the temporary over
throw of which has brought distress and
ruin to every part of our beloved coun
try."
At the same x meeting Senator Thurston
stated the issues of the impending struggle
in these clear words: "The great political
contest of 1896 will be fought on the same
lines as have all other recent contests be
tween Democratic and Republican parties.
The protection of American industries,
American markets for American products,
American prices for American labor, is the
battle-cry of the Republican party for the
coming campaign. Two million idle men
in the United States demand a chance to
vote upon this issue in the full knowledge
of bitter experience."
The same spirit pervaded the celebra
tions held in other cities. In New York
Chauncey M. Depew recalled in these words
the beginning of Lincoln's public career:
"The first speech he ever made was a
speech for that policy which was the
first policy of George Washington, the
first policy of the greatest creative brain
in Revolutionary periods, Alexander Ham
ilton, the principle of protection of Amer
ican industries. With that keen and in
tuitive grasp of public necessity and of the
future, growth of the Republic which
always characterized Lincoln he saw
early in life that this country, under a
proper system of protection, would become
self-supporting; he saw that a land of raw
materials was necessarily a land of pov
erty, while a land of diversified industries,
each, of them self-sustaining and prosper- 1
ous, was a land of colleges and schools, a
land of science and literature, a land of re
ligion and Jaw, a land of prosperity, hap
piness and peace." ''->'."" \ -
At the same meeting Mr. Foraker, who
devoted his speech to the merchant ma
rine and the American navy, said that had
Harrison been re-elected we should likely
have had measures for the encouragement
of American-built ships carrying Ameri
can goods, with discriminations in ton
nage and tariff duties to effect the pur
pose. As a result of Harrison's defeat our
merchant marine interests have declined
until at present we carry only about 12
per cent of our foreign trade. Not only
must we recover our merchant marine, he
urged, but we must have a navy able to
protect it and compel respect throughout
the world ; and then he urged that a part
of all this was the construction of' an
American ship canal across Nicaragua. j
He added this:
"These are three majestic works. They
are worthy of the party that saved the
Union and gave to immortality the great
names of Lincoln and Grant. Their un
dertaking will be a fit crowning of the
closing century, and their consummation
will bring wealth, power, honor, happi
ness and glory to the whole American
people, and. so entrench .the. Republican
party in their affections that neither you
nor I will live long enough to see another
Democratic President."
It would hardly be, possible to state in
clearer terms the policy of the Republican
party as laid down by Lincoln than is set
forth in these extracts. The great value of
these principles lies not alone in their age
nor in the fact that they were among the
great causes which led to the founding of
the Republican party, but in the fact that
they are universal and imperishable, their
temporary obscuration having called a
halt in the progress of the Nation.
THE POOLROOM TIGHT.
It was doubtless a _ surprise to Judge
Wallace to read in The Call the suspicion
that the poolroom case which he tried and
in which he decided that so much of the
Ellert ordinance as prohibited the down
town acceptance , of betting money to be
placed at the racetracks "on commission"
was unconstitutional, was "cooked" ,. for
the purpose of deceiving him as to the true
nature of-, these establishments. It may
interest the Grand Jury likewise to bear a
rumor to the effect that the policeman de
tailed to place money was expected by the
pool-seller, and that . his money was im
mediately Bent toÂ» the racetrack' to be
placed.
That this pretense of doing a commission
business was pure sham and that Judge
Wallace was imposed upon has never been
doubted by well-informed citizens, but ab
solute'proof of the absence of anything
like a commission business has been fur
nished within the last week by the wild
mistakes â¢ made by the downtown - pool
sellers in posting horses, since means for
securing information from '.the: track had
' been shut off. ;." For that matter, the - very
fact of shutting off this information makes
it a physical impossibility for the down
town establishments to do a commission
business.; This is so self-evident as to re
quire no argument. , . â '.'â  :.. :
vS Even " under ; Judge Wallace's decision,
therefore, the ; ; downtown poolrooms L are
illegally conducted, for," having ' no ""; longer
that decision upon which to stand, they
manifestly come in conflict with the pro
visions of ; the Ellert ordinance left intact.
In addition to that their operations clearly
come within the prohibition of the general
laws against fraud and (disorder, as '< they
are nothing more than bucket-shops, hav
ing no legitimate relation whatever to
racing.- ... t " * v *
Prosecuting â  Attorney Dare is * perfectly
right in declaring , that we have 1 sufficient
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1896.
'aws to cover the case, and that we need
only to enforce them. It seems to haVe
been taken for granted that the poolrooms
should be permitted . to operate ' until' the
Board of Supervisors should pass an ordi
nance prohibiting them more completely
than the Eliert ordinance. The manner
in which the Supervisors have handled
the matter prohibits the â  hone that relief
may be expected from them. The relief is
at hand, and the police and the courts can
proceed without the Supervisors.
The things to be done now by the police
are not only to follow Mr. Dare's sugges
tion to make an arrest every day and thus
have a new case daily for trial,' but to
work diligently to secure sufficient evi
dence to convict. Meanwhile the scandal
which has cropped out with regard to the
case before Judge Wallace cannot be ig
nored by the police, and whatever course
they may take the Grand Jury still has ; a
duty to perform. A - .':_ i'
IRRIGATION AND POWER.
The people of thePoso irrigation district
in Kern County have reason to rejoice
over the completion of the great flume
which is to -irrigate 40,000 acres of their
land. The instant water is turned on the
value of the land is at least doubled, and
that makes a splendid addition to the
wealth of the State. ,; *
Attention cannot be too early called to
the fact that where there is water for irri
gation there is water for generating elec
trical power a 9 well; that the same water
may be used for both purposes without in
jury to either, and that where the two are ',
worked in conjunction the cost of the com
bined plant is much smaller than either
would be if kept separate. More than
that, the separate installation of irrigation
and power plants will tend to restrict the
utility of water without securing a corre
sponding benefit. VW(
It may not generally be that both power
and irrigation are presently needed at any
one source of water supply, but the double
need is sure to arise sooner or later. Take
the case of Poso as an illustration. The
bringing of 40,000 acres under irrigation
means the abolition of broad unsettled
acres devoted to grazing or grain and â  the
incoming of a dense population cultivat
ing comparatively small farms devoted to
fruits or other valuable crops. Such a set- .
tlement will require a town, which means ;
facilities for the transaction of business
and for the enjoyment of social and re
ligious advantages. The town will need
electricity for light and other purposes.
The water which makes the town neces
sary can produce electricity as well as
irrigate the land. This combination of the
two utilities will reduce their cost and thus
tend to the more rapid development of the
community. â¢ J ': -S . -.-
This suggestion should be considered in
all schemes either for irrigation or the
conversion of water-power into electric
ity. These are two of the most important
lines upon which the future development
of the State is to proceed, and it is a for
tunate coincidence that they are so clearly
related. It is true that, as a rule, the de
mand for electricity will follow the de
velopment caused by irrigation, and that
when electricity is needed it can be fur
nished by the irrigation company. This
opens up a new line of discussion. If the'
Supreme Court of the United States sus
tains Judge Ross* overthrow of the Wright
law the business of irrigation will pass
largely into the hands of capitalists. The
private ownership of matters so vital to
community interests as irrigation and
electricity means a monopoly of those
functions. â¢', The Wright law might con
ceivably enable a district to secure its irri
gation without cost other than that of
| construction, as it is easy to imagine that
an electrical company would ordinarily
be glad to perform the service of irrigation
in exchange for the privilege of using the
water for the generation of electricity.
Not a sing element of a monopoly would
present itself under such circumstances.
CUSTOM-HOUSE SCANDALS.
The restrictions placed on tue importa
tion of Chinese ana opium into the United
States have been productive of such
an endless amount '. of official rascality
that the office of the Collector of the
Port of San Francisco has suffered
from scandal more . perhaps than any
other in the country. Only recently
thirty Chinese women were openly smug
gled into the City from the Atlanta Fair
under circumstances pointing indubitably
either to incompetency or connivance on
the part of the local Federal authoritiefT
The latest news is that the authorities at
Washington have under investigation a
charge that the local customs officers have
lately received $8000 in bribes for the ad
mission of women imported from China
for immoral purposes.
It is but. just to explain that suspicion
has not attached to the Collector himself,
but. to the men under him. At the same
time he is responsible ' for the conduct of
his office and for the misdeeds of his in
feriors. A daring feature of the latest plot
to swindle the Government is said to be
the arrest of a Chinese who has given val
uable service to the Government, the idea
being to put him out of the way of ob
structing the operations of the "Custom
house ring." I Bribery and forged certifi
cates are alleged to be parts of the ugly
business. v*y '**
From the very beginning of lawsmu
nicipal, State and Federal for the regula
tion of the Chinese in San Francisco,
every conceivable form of official corrup
tion has had a genesis in the Chinese
quarter. As our laws were obnoxious to
these aliens and interfered with their evil
practices, they were easy victims of black
mail and willing offerers of bribes. If it
were possible to force them into an accept
ance of and submission to our laws one of
the greatest evils of their presence would
be eliminated. Being incurably alien,
they ; are dangerous ; and having ideas of
morality repugnant to those of the white
race, they are a demoralizing and corrupt
ing agency. V..-/ . **,*
Collector Wise owes it to himself and the
people to assist in running down the scan
dals in his office' Considering the ; pa
tience, silence and cunning of the Chinese,
the^ask of exposure is exceedingly diffi
cult; and while that will make the efforts
all the more arduous, it indicates the dan
gers of Chinese evils. y 1

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Even the professional joke writer gets the
tables turned on "him occasionally. Mr. Car
penter, the gentleman who writes the "Out of
Tune" column on the Pott, is the latest victim.

words, uttered in the What Cheer House to a

them on some one before I gave them to the

purity was a watchman at the City Hall. He
used to wait for me near the Clerk's office
about 9 o'clock. I always turned loose a dozen

would lean up against the wall and nearly
burst with laughter. He finally got so he
laughed whenever he saw me coming. He had
a perpetual smile on ready to hear one of my
jokes. He so pleated me with the rapidity
with which he saw the point that I used to
treat him twice a day. There, boys, is where I
made the fatal mistake. He was simply after
the drinks. Well, it went on for some time,
and whenever he laughed I concluded that the
story wÂ»s good and ran it in the paper. ', ' _
"One afternoon Clarence- Webster came up
and called me off to one side. 'Look here,
Carp,' said he ; 'that watchman is an imposi

with him to-day, and tried the experiment of
stopping in the middle of a story long ' before
the point was reached, and he invariably went
all to pieces with hilarious laughter. I not
only tried it once, but several times, and when
ever I hesitated, as though' the point had been
reached, he got right In and laughed all ; over
the hall. Go and try it on nim and see for
yourself.' ... i . -â¢ -. *,

the next day I greeted the watchman with the
old smile and the information that I had a new
joke to tell him. 'Give it to us,' he -exclaimed
eagerly, getting his mouth ready for a roar. I
then began a story which was utterly without
point, and suddenly stopped' in the most un
interesting part of it. | He looked at me a sec

he reeled around the place in convulsions of
laughter. It made me pretty hot to see â  how
he had been dragging me for drinks and I
reached for his coat lapel. /.'Look here, you
scoundrel,' I roared, shaking him up .pretty.

drinks, and I want to know why you laughed

The Journal's editorial paragraphs are de

"Falstaff." It takes "The Cat Came Hack," or
"Throw 'Em ! Down, McCioskey," -or "The Man

Italian newspapers brag that Baratieri's army, in

Under the beading "Cockroach in the Cake"
a few moneyed men of Wall street, aided and
abetted by some Colorado capitalists, are
accused of "bearing" Cripple Creek stocks so
that the "combine" can get hold of the prop

Cripple Creek will not need a Home Pro

editor of the Journal is encouraged in writing
paragraphs like this: >^.
TAKE YOUR FEET OUT OF THE TROUGH.
A Bennett-avenue groceryman, between First
and Second streets, whose place of business is
about the middle of the block, on the south side of
the avenue, says that unless Cripple Creek printers
will do his job work at figures as low as those
offered by Colorado Springs he will send his work
to the last-named city. The gentleman seems to
overlook, from his own experience, that rents,
materials and expenses are higher here than at the
Springs. Following his example the newspapers
should publish his name and advise people to
send to Colorado Springs for their groceries.

A. LESSON TO ; RAILROADS.
Railroad presidents and railroad stockhold
ers"have hadfmany interesting "object lessons".
since 1893. They are.not quite so ready now
to say that the tariff" has nothing to do with
the railroad business. They thought it had
though, in 1892. -.Then they were expecting
to order more engines and more freight cars so
as to he able to supply the demand of shippers
of farm stuff as soon as they began to rush
their products forward in their effort to can
ture the markets of the world. That breach in
the wall or protection was to let farmers ? get
their stuff out of the country, and the rail
roads were ready to haul it to the seaboard so
that it might lose no time in getting out, and.
incidentally paying freight bills. T There is
everywhere, a significant silence now as to how
many markets were captured. ; Let us try to
fathom the mystery. * Here is a table , showing
m^B9" C to c l P B95 0 gr&in at Atlantic Eeab Â° aid
GRAIN BECEIPTS AT ATLANTIC SEABOARD.
Ypar. 3 7 7 3 30 , 1"0> Average.

1895 159,621,930/ 163,213
A drop of 123,000,000 bushels within * a
couple of years must have sidetracked many a
freight car and rusted many an engine. So
wonder that 96,000 railroad \ hands were laid
off In 1894. The tariff may have nothing to do
with the railroad business directly, but it is
mighty significant that an average of 244,
--400,000 bushels of grain : was hauled to . the
Atlantic seaboard during the two years of pro
tection, 1892 and 1893, while the average was
only 157,000,000 ..bushels during the two
years of the Democratic administration.
And this docs : not show the smaller
quantity hauled to our home market points in
1894 and 1895 ! owing .- to the lighter con
sumption. -Nor does it take any account of a
couple of million barrels less flour, hauled to
Asiatic seaboard because reciprocity had been
a fraud and was abolished. Honestly, now,
Messrs. Railroad Presidents and Stockholders,
don't, you think it would be a pretty good move
to build up that wall of protection again, and
to have a few more reciprocity treaties, instead
of letting our foreign trade transactions result
for the benefit | of the foreigners, and against
ourselves?â American Economist.

SEEING ONE'S OWN BRAIN.
The following experiment taken from Pro
fessor Lloyd's new book, "Etidorhpa," is quite
interesting. The experimenter provides him
self with a lighted candle and enters a per
fectly dark room.. He stands before a black
curtain or wall, or any other dark flat surface,
so that details cannot be seen by the candle's
feeble light. The candle is moved laterally to
and fro in front of the eyes, keeping it about
six inches from the face and just below the tip
of the nose. In & few minutes something, as if
thin mist, seems to grow before the eyes. It
becomes more definite and gains outline. Soon
one can distinguish the venations and the di
visions of the brain. One is seeing his o* n
brain ! A change of position of the candle will
bring out other portions into view, but as soon
HOW A MAN'S BRAIN LOOKS TO HIMSELF.
as the lateral movement is stopped, however,
the view, whatever it is, soon fades away.
The example given is very simple. Accord
ing to the author, there is nothing more won
derful in seeing an object almost touching the
organ of sight than in seeing the most distant
stars, hundreds of millions of miles away.
The theory is that the moving light produces
a counter-irritation of the nerves that conduct
the impression of sight to the brain. The
cutrent is reversed, and the brain is pictured
on the retina. Then the impression returns
through the nerves, and affects the brain so
that we see it. The explanation may or may
not be true, but the fact remains that one see's
something marvelously like what one would
imagine a brain to be,' in its natural environ
ment. _ > J___H_____

WAS HER OWN EXECUTOR
So Her Lawyers Testify With
Regard to Mrs. Ellen
Gallagher.
SHE HAD MADE TWO WILLS.
Told Her Relatives It Was Nobody's
Business How Her Property Was
Disposed Of.
The case of White against Rev. Denis
Nugent attracted a crowd to Judge Hunt's
courtroom yesterday. The plaintiffs rested
their case after the introduction of: some
documentary evidence, and J. C. Campbell
for the defendant moved for] a nonsuit,
alleging that no case had been made; that
no evidence had been introduced showing j
that Father Nugent had exercised any j
undue influence over the mind of Mrs. Gal- J
lagher in the matter of disposing of her
property.
Judge Hunt denied the motion, and the
defense began its case. Attorney O'Don
nell took the stand and identified the will
of the deceased, which he had drawn and
witnessed. There was another will, he
said, drawn two years prior to her death,
and which will bequeathed almost all she
had to the Roman Catholic church, show
ing that it was no recent impulse or fear
of death that caused her to so dispose of
her property later. Father Nugent, he said,
had never given him any instructions in
the matter. Mrs. Gallagher had told him
distinctly that it was her desire to be her
own executor. â¢
John McGara, a clerk in Jones & O'Don
nell's office, and who also witnessed Mrs.
Gallagher's will, was called. He stated
that in conversation with Mrs. Gallagher
she had given him to understand that she
had disposed of her property chiefly by
donation and that all she had left was dis
tributed by the will.
The will" of Thomas Gallagher was intro
duced after a long argument of the coun
sel of both sides. Mr. Campbell read the
will and then George R.B. Hayes arose
and began to address the court on what he
proposed to prove concerning it by the
witness.
Mr. Henley interrupted, saying that the
proper way was to go on with the offer, so
far as it was admissible; that to state what
was intended to be proved was one way of
getting the matter before the jury; , that
the other way was more in consonance
with fair play.
"Do you mean to impute unfair dealing
to me," sir?" inquired Mr, Hayes, facing
Mr. Henley. .
"What's that?" said Henley.
Mr. Hayes repeated.
"Nothing of the kind," said Henley, ris
ing. "When I undertake to impute un
fairness to you, sir, I shall do so so unequiv
ocally as to leave no question about my
intention.."
Mr. Hayes, by agreement, stated the na
ture of his offer quietly to the court and
upon objection it was not allowed.
Hugh Jones testified that Mrs. Gallagher
had consulted him about disposing of her
property. Fl>e wanted to give a large part
of 11 to" charity. Witness told her|she
could not do so except before her death;
that if she bequeathed more than one
third to charity it might invalidate the
will; that there was no other way that he
knew of except to give it away before her
death. He testified that he drew up the
will for her. He called upon Her after
ward to witness her signature to it, and
found that she had signed it already. He
advised her to sign again in his presence,
and she did so, "which accounted for it be
ing signed twice. '
Mary Gallagher, sister of Thomas Galla
gher, testified that she was on friendly
terms with her brother and sister-in
law until his death and with Mrs. Galla
gher for a year after.* She had often
heard her brother say that after his death
and that of bis wife their property was to
her brother say that after bis death
nat of his wife their property was to
go to God or to charity, 'as they used the
words." He said that he felt that he only
held the property in trust, and aside from
some small bequests to relatives he would
devote it all to charity. The witness called
upon Mrs. Gallagher some time after the
contest of her husband's will had begun
and urged her to make a will then so as to
avoid the likelihood of trouble about it
afterward.
She said in reply, "What's the use of
making a will; there must be some other
way of disposing the property."
The witness tried to influence her to give
her (the witness) something more, but she
refused, saying that her husband had
earned the money and she (Mrs, Gallagher)
had helped to save it and it was nobody's
business what they did with it.
Margaret Toner, another sister of Mr.
Gallagher, who had begun the contest of
his will, testified to the same effect.
The case then went over the contest of
will, testified to the same effect.
he case then went over until Monday
morning.. â¢
POTRERO IMPROVEMENTS
Work to Be Recommenced on
the Kentucky-Street
Hill.
The Paving of Tennessee Street With
Bitumen Is One of the Things
. Contemplated.
The work of cutting down the big hill on
Kentucky street, between Nineteenth and
Twenty-second, will be commenced within
a short time. Tb_> work was suspended
during the heavy storms about Christmas
time on account of the rains softening the
earth and causing the banks to cave, mak
ing it impossible to continue the work ;at
that time. But a scene of activity will
again soon be presented, and when the
work is recommenced it will continue
without cessation until the blocks and
streets to the eastward have been filled to i
the official grade.
...It; is estimated that a force of twenty
five men will kept busy until August or
September of the present year , to finish
the work already under way, and if fur
ther work is started it will : take even
longer. â  The grading of , these streets and
blocks will undoubtedly prove of. great
benefit to the entire. district, and once the |
big bill on Kentucky street is entirely re- |
moved this part of the Potrero will be one
of the most 'â¢ available . and choicest resi
dence portions of the whole district, being
near the Kentucky-street car line and hav
ing very easy and gentle grades. .
:' As an instance of how this property is
looked upon by home builders it may be
stated that last summer the, lots" immedi
ately adjoining the Potrero schoolhouse on
the north and south, eighteen lots in all,
were graded and offered for sale, and with
in; a very few i weeks thereafter . eleven of
the : eighteen had ; been sold at the full
prices asked by the owners of the property.
On ' four of â  these' lots I have ; been ~ erected
two-story flats of : a good ;. substantial char
acter * and I-' most of ; the other purchasers
contemplate erecting either ; flats or cot
tages during the year. "A-. â¢ â  "\ :.' ' " .
The paving with basalt blocks of Twenty
second street, between Kentucky and Ten
nessee, and the laying of granite curbs
thereon will be finished; in a few I days.
The paving with bitumen of the crossing
of Twenty-secondhand J, Tennessee has just
been finished. The next improvement
contemplated in this district is the paving
oi Tennessee street with bitumen from
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1896.

CHANCE FOR STERNBERG
The Supreme Court Will Hear Again
the Judgment Already Con
firmed. .
Louis Sternberg; has been- granted a' re
hearing by the Supreme Court in the case
in which the action of the Superior Court
was affirmed, and in that case in which
the judgment was reversed the remittitur
has been sent down to the County Clerk.
The cases of false ; registration upon
which Sternberg was tried were for the
registering of Samuel Newman and A.
Gutman.
In one case the judgment denying a
motion for a new trial was reversed be-Â»
cause Judge Wallace had not instructed
the jury as to what was corroborative evi
dence and also because he did not tell
them that they should look with suspi
cion on the testimony of an accomplice.
In the other. case Judge Wallace charged
that a certain witness was an accomplice,
which was a charge as to a matter of fact,
but it was passed by the Supreme Court
because its effect was to greatly strengthen
the case for the defense. In spite of this,
however, it was one of the points in a pe
tition for a rehearing, and the granting of
the petition shows that it was deemed of
some importance by the court. The re
hearing was granted by Justices Beatty,
Garoutte, McFarland and Van Fleet.
ONLY TRYING HIS NERVE.
Thrilling Experience of a Fruit
Man With a Many-
Legged Centipede.
A Friend Stood. Calmly by and Saw
His Companion Suffer Con
siderable Torment.
The Hawaiian Islands are almost as
well off as Ireland. St. Patrick drove all
the venomous insects and reptiles out of
the green isle, but the Hawaiians claim
that the reptiles and insects left on Mr.
Dole's domain are in no sense of the word
poisonous.
People who have particular dealings
with venomous insects imported from the
islands make the same claim. A local
fruit importer said yesterday:
"Very frequently we receive consign
ments of bananas and pineapples packed
in dried grass and leaves. In taking the
fruit from the boxes it it not uncommon
to find a big centipede crawling along the
stalk between the bananas doing his best
to get use"d to the California climate.
"Tuesday afternon I was opening a box
of bananas and pushed my hand through
the straw to get at the stalk. I felt around
for a few seconds and thought I couki feel
something moving around on the back of
my hand. I had often heard of the pres
ence of centipedts in
fruit shipments, so I
carefully withdrew my
hand so as to make as
little commotion as
possible. Imagine my
surprise and alarm to
see a five-inch centi
pede slowly crer ing
uo my arm to my coat
sleeve. I was on the
point of striking it off
and jumping all over
it, when a fruit-packer
standing nearby warn
ed me to mate no at
tempt to get rid of it,
but to let it crawl off
at its leisure. I had
forgotten the fact that
they were not poison
ous, and I know I got
as white as a sheet, be
lieving every moment
that it would sink its
claws into me and send
its powerful poisons
through my blood.
"I looked at it with
fear and trembling,
but did not dare to
move a muscle. It
lifted its head and
seemed perfectly satis
fied to remain where it
was. I could hardly
restrain myself from
making a quick motion
and shaking it off, but
my companion warned
me again and again to |
keep quiet. All I could i
feel was a tickling sen
sation as the insect's
lees quivered and felt
around in every direc
tion. The tickling in
creased, and I was al
most ready to faint
with suppressed ex
citement. Finally the
centipede looked up at
my sleeve and slowly
made for it, moving all
the legs in unison.
A Sandwich Ttland cen
tipede, taid to be non
poig'jnovtâZife size.
â¢ The sensation by this
time was simply un
bearable, and I feared
remain calm until the thing got entirely
off. My flesh seemed to shrink away as
the horrible creature proceeded, but in a
few more seconds, every one of which
seemed an hour, it had settled itself
comfortably on the fabric of my clothing,
and with a motion quicker than I was
ever known to make before I routed it
out with a stick and sat down perspiring
from head to foot. It was the most thrill
ing experience I ever figured in, and it
made me sick the rest of the day.
"My companion began to laugh as
though he would die of merriment, but I
saw nothing particularly humorous in the
situation.
" 'You are crazy,' said he, *to get fright
ened over a little thing like that. Do you
not know that Hawaiian Island centi
pedes are not poisonous? I told you to
keep quiet just to see how long your nerve
would last. If the thing had sunk every
claw he had into your flesh it would only
have caused a little swelling and nothing
more. I have had several of them strike
i me, and I apply a little ammonia or salt
I water and cure it up in half an hour.' "

jects who reside there. He said-yester
day: ; / y â  . ;.â  â¢;-!
In addition to building up trade with China,
I shall travel about the empire and establish
consulates where they may be deemed neces
sary. i shall also visit Japan and India, and
spend some time in Doth for the same purpose.
The trade of all the countries of the far East
we regard of much importance to Peru. We
feel that we produce many things which ought
to find a ready market there at a profit to us.
At the present time there are some fifteen
sailing-ships plying between China and Peru.
One or two leave China every month. They
come loaded with tea, rice, silks and various
fancy things. We do a heavy business with
China, but the Chinese don't do any with us.
All these sailing-ships go back empty from our
shores, only to be loaded again with rice, tea,
silks and other products, for which they get
handsome prices from Peru. So the Peruvian
Government has delegated me to go over as
Consul-General and see about it. We think we
can bulla up a heavy trade all through the
Orient, and are going to try.it.
Lima, the capital, the city which has for
many years been my home, now has 150,000
people, and Peru, as a whole, fully 3,500,000.
The country is fairly prosperous, but the war
with Chile a few years ago set us back consid
erably. However, we have recently completed
the railroad from Callao to Oroiya, over the
lofty Andes Mountains, and since then we are
able to bring out the coffee. Planting of
coffee has also Increased till now we export
coffee, even to San 'Francisco. The railroad is
the highest in the world, roachlng an altitude
in the Andes of over 20,000 feet.
An American engineer, representing a syn
dicate, of American capitalists, has lately
bought the horsecar line in Lima, and ob
tained with it a franchise to build electric
lines there. He was to have reached San
Francisco on the Zealandia. the steamer on
which I came, but at the last moment he was
obliged to wait over till the next steamer.
Consul-General Mesa was formerly an
officer in the Peruvian navy. He will sail
for China on Saturday.
A TUG OWNER CENSURED
Captain Grey of the Ship-Own
ers' and Merchants' Com
pany to Blame.
The Squabble Over the Fault-Finding
Settled by the Harbor Com- *
missioners.
. . V '" ''â¢
The Harbor Commissioners came to a
decision in regard to the dispute over the
docking of the Roanoke yesterday. â¢ Tbe
Ship-owners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company' was found to be in fault and on
the motion of Mr. Chadbourne it was cen
sured. Superintendent Grey was also
ordered to refund $25," the amount it cost
the commission to successfully dock the
ship. â  . - . *
When the matter came up for discussion-
Captain Tupman of the British ship Sea
farer was the first one heard. It was his
vessel that had moved just at the time the'
Roanoke was docking, and by getting in
the.way had caused all the trouble. He said
he '.j received imperative orders from Chief
Wharfinger Root to move at 2 â¢ o'clock? in
the : afternoon, and . as he was .doing ':. so
some one whom he did not know told him
to hold on, as might interfere with -the
docking of the Roanoke. H
*;i He ; did > not j know âthat , the , man w
representative of the â¢ State, but admitted
that he wore a ? uniform. In answer to a
question put by President Colnon, Captain
Tupman said be was not sure about the
message given. His vessel was , almst \un
der way at the time and he could not hear,
but his impression was that the words he
heard were, "You had better not move as
there may be damage 1 done." The Roan
oke was then beyond Folsom-street wharf,
so he thought there was plenty of ( time to
get out, and besides he foid; not I recognize
the authority of the man giving the orders.
B. Morrow, representing Williams,
mond"' & - Co., y described % the ' manner in
which the tugboat company had blocked
the docking of the Roanoke, 1 and made the
assertion that Captain i Grey ; had 7 said the
tug Milieu Griffiths would not dare to
handle the ship. ., ,'- -AA" ~-A: AA
; In reply Captain Grey denied ever,: hav
ing made such a statement. He, insisted
that there was no ill-feeling in the matter
and that there was an offer now on hie in
the office of Williams. Dimond, & Co. to
handle all the firm's ships on the old terms.
"It is | preposterous to think," said, he,
"that we would risk two boats valued at
over : $50,000 r just , for a little spite work.
Another thing, our captains are amenable
to the law, and if they were guilty of any
such work.their licenses woulu be revoked.
If there was any appearance of disobeying
the orders of the wharfinger I am sorry,
and can assure you it will never happen
again.''
"All I have to say," said Captain Hamil
ton of the Roanoke, "is that it was one of
the nicest laid schemes to prevent the
docking of a ship I have ever seen, but it
failed." Then Commissioner Chadbourne
made his motion, and it was carried. Cap
tain Grey seemed surprised, but Captain
Hamilton and Mr. Morrow left the room
smiling.
Lieutenant Fechteler appeared before
the board as the representative of the com
mandant at Mare Island. He made a plea
in favor of free facilities for the docking of
the Unadilla being granted and gained his
point. As soon as President Colnon learned
that the charges would have to come out
of the pockets of the navy officers he
moved that a free berth be given, and this
motion was carried. Â» â¢"
E. K. Wood protested against the grant
ins .of ; a contract, to the S. E. Siade Com
pany to supply lumber at $11 a thousand.
He said his company had an offer on file
to supply it at $10, and wanted to know
why it had not been considered. President
Colnon said the offer was nearly five months
old and that* the board did, not consider it
binding. ' He also pointed out that Wood
in the same offer had quoted shingles at
$1 25, and when the superintendent of con-
struction went to him for that article he
charged $1 50. Mr. "Wood was told to make
a : memorandum to the effect that in six
months' time the board would cali for new
bids, and that then he could make another
offer. .'.... - .-â  â > Â

CUSTOM-HOUSE SCANDAL

' The Custom-house scandal grows apace.
It promises some lively developments
within the next few days, as it is known
that Special Agent Moore has preferred
some serious charges against Federal offi
cers of high standing. Moore must either
substantiate these charges or stand con"
victed of gross misrepresentation. There
is reason â â  to . believe that he has a very
strong case against the accused inspectors.
Anyway, the information is now in the
possession of the Treasury Department at
Washington.
It is learned on good authority that of
the sixteen Chinese girls .imported within
the last three months for immoral pur
poses, and who were allowed to land on
the payment of $8000 ;to certain ", Custom;
house inspectors, eleven were secured by
Lee Hoy and Lee Gee and five* went to

Loss of Life on the Big Sealing
Schooner Edward E.
Webster.
MEN WASHED OFF THE JIBSOOM.
Unsuccessful Attempts to Launch the
_,â ;â¢'.â¢'â  , Steamers Trilby and Caro
line.
The sealing schooner Edward E. Web
ster nas been very unfortunate in her start
on an otter-hunting expedition. There was
some difficulty in securing a crew, and
now the owners are in trouble with the
Customs authorities.
A few days after the vessel left port two
of the crew were drowned. The captain
put into Drakes Bay and came to San
â¢Francisco to report the accident. Hear- ,
rived here last Sunday, and, securing two
men, started back for - the schooner early
on Monday morning. , No report of the
loss of life and no memoranda of the ship
ping of the men was made to the Custom
house, and, in consequence, Captain Frank
Johnson will be hauled over the coals
when the Webster gets back to San Fran
cisco. . ',
When the Webster sailed from this port
she cleared for an otter-hunting cruise.
Oft' Point Reyes it came on to blow, and
the vessel was put under short canvass.
Three men were sent out to furl the jib.
Tbe vessel was plunging into a head sea,
and the sailors ware on several occasions
nearly washed away. They succeeded
in getting tne sail furled, however, and
started back for the deck. A giant wave
came along, and when it had swept the
ship all three men were gone. Axel Peter
son and Arthur Jeffreys were never seen
again, but the third man-, managed to
catch a flying rope and was hauled aboard.
Captain Johnson ran his vessel for the
nearest safe anchorage and then came to
San Francisco on the gasoline steamer
Mary C. It did not take him long to se
cure two men to fill the places of those who
had been lost, and he at once started with
them by train for Bodega Bay. The full
particulars of the accident will not be
known until . the vessel gets back, as
Agent A. V. Lorentzen says that he knows
nothing further than that tne men were
washed off the jibboom and drowned.
The steamer Trilby, built for the Sacra
mento River trade, had not a very suc
cessful launch in 'life.. As she was sliding
into the arms of the "gray old sea" the
supports gave way and she went stern first
into the mud. Luckily no particular dam
age was done, .but the vessel will have to
be raised on jacks before she can be got
into salt water. ;
When in commission the Trilby will run
in opposition to the Southern Pacific
Company, and Hideout '& Co., who have
built her, say they will make it hot for the
monopoly om the river.
The steamer Caroline was also in diffi
culties. She had been on the ways at
South San Francisco receiving an over
hauling." As she was being launched one
of the supports gave way and a projecting
timber went through her bottom. She had
to be hauled back again and it will be at
least a week before she will go into com
mission. â â¢-;â¢'.â 
Joseph Byrnes, the sailor on the revenue
cutter Bear who caused all the trouble
last Monday by disobeying orders and
afterward deserting, was caught yesterday
and placed in irons. Captain Turtle is
determined to : maintain discipline, so he
made Byrnes an example and the rest of
the men will j probably, obey orders in
future.; . . '.-...-.
Dr. C. F. Peckham, the surgeon in charge
of the quarantine station at Angel Island,
has been ordered to Port Townsend. He
does not like the change at all as his wife
and family are with him and he will have
to break up his home. The orders -were
for an immediate transfer, but under the
circumstances Dr. Peckham was given ten
days in which to get ready.
Harry Edwards, an apprentice on one
of the British ships in the stream, has to
thank Captain Pippy of the State tug Gov
ernor Irwin for the fact that he is alive.
The lad was not satisfied with his sur
roundings and determined to desert.
There was no chance lo get ashore except
by swimming, so he slipped into the water
when no one was looking and started for
the shore. "
When picked up by the Irwin he was
almost exhausted, and could not possibly
have reached the wharf. He was dried in
the engine-room, and , Captain Pippy gave
him a dollar to get a bed with. Young
Edwards says he left all his clothing and a
$00 sextant on , the ship, and intends try
ing to recover them as soon as. the vessel
docks.
The captain of the British ship Centaur,
which arrived from Liverpool yesterday,
reports that on January 3 when passing
Easter Island a boat came alongside with
fifteen natives and the King of the islands,
and gave them six sheep, two hogs, sev
eral bunches of bananas and other fruits.
The King said they were all well, and had
about 30,000 sheep and 30,000 cattle on the
island, and that also a British ship was
loading with wool.
Seamen Were Released.
Paul Kenzie, John Quinlan and R. Connolly,
charged with disobeying orders of the captain
on board the Australia, were discharged by
United States Commissioner Heacock - yester
day. The evidence against them was . insuffi
cient. '. .

FATHER YORKE TO
B. F. HUDELSON.
The Chancellor Replies to
Thirty-One Ques
< tions.
FREE SCHOOLS UPHELD.
Says the A. P. A. Is Dangerous
to the Welfare of the
Country.
HUDELSON WRITES AGAIN,
His Interpretation of A. P. A. Princi
plesâDr. York Replies to
Father Yorke.
The Rev. P. C. Yorke contributes the fol
lowing letter in answer to recent com
munications from the pen of B. F. Hudei
son, State president of the A. P. A.:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: The
Reverend .Benjamin Hudeison, State Presi
dent of the A. P. A., has been marching up and
down before the public of California for the
past few weeks with a chip on his shoulder.
lie has addressed himself particularly to me
and with much grotesque gesticulation and
wild waving of his goosequiil has invited me
to come on.
I must confess, Mr. Editor, that I have not
put myself to any particular trouble to gratify
the impatience ol the Rev. Benjamin Hud
eison. There are- certain things which age
cannot wither nor custom stale. The verdant
freshness which assumes that your readers are
stone blind to the nature of the A. P. A. is one
of them. Mr. Hudeison will keep and I can
afford to hasten slowly. Moreover, the contro
versy was already so mixed that I did not wish
to add another thread to the tangle. Now,
however, since the Rev. Dr. Wendte has given
me the marble heart and the stony stare, as
this morning he bowed "positively ' his last
farewell" over the footlights. I have an oppor
tunity to attend to the Rev. Benjamin Hudei
son, State President of the A. P. A.
I must, however, express my surprise that
the Rev. Benjamin- Hudeison- should be so
anxious for a controversy. The ritual of the
order which was used in the initiation of can
didates in this City during the summer of 1894
contains a stringent provision against suÂ«'h
proceedings. As the candidate stood before
the chaplain, with his right hand on his heart,
he solemnly swore, after promising to break
down the power of the Pope, "I will not eater
into any controversy with a Roman Catholic
upon the subject of this order." . .-;._""
As the oath binds the supreme .president as
well as the inferior members I am. now more
than surprised that the Rev. B. Hudeison
should be so dreadfully anxious to enter into a
controversy on the subject of his order with a
Roman Catholic priest.
The Rev. Mr. Hudeison opens his communi
cation with the statement that "the principles
of any individual largely if not wholly deter
mine his character." This statement is very
true if we are dealing with an honest and a
consistent individual; it is very false if we are
dealing with a hypocrite or a fraud. The ad
vertised principles of Uriah Heep were far
different from the principles on which he
acted, so the advertised principles of the A. P.
A. may be far different from those which ani
mate its member. When a man comes before
us with a set of maxims and with the claim !
that he lives up to them we test his claim by 1
his deeds. When a society appears before the j
public and asks for support because it pro
fesses certain principles it is the first duty of
the public to consider how far these principles j
are put in practice by the society.
THE A. P. A. PLATFORM. '
Hence it is that the A. P. A. platform cuts i
but little figure in such a discussion as this. I
The assertions in the declarations of principles 1
are so loosely constructed that they may mean |
anything or nothing. As they lie there is very '
little to distinguish them from the platforms '
of the two parties to which the great bulk of j
the citizens of this country, Protestant and
Catholic, give their adhesion. Hence there is |
no need of answering the multitudinous ques- j
tions which the Rev. Mr. Hudeison tacks on to i
the A. ]'. A. platform. To many of them I
would give assent, and to none of " them am I
counselled by any principle of my religion to
answer no. However, though the operation is
perfectly needless, it may be just as well to
take up the questions one by one and say my
say about them. --v<
question 1.
Does Mr. Yorke deny that politics need puri
fying, or does he object to their purification?
I have not the slightest objection to the puri
fication of politics, and I believe that pure poli
tics, should be the ideal of every good citizen.
The extent of the need is a matter on which I
am not competent to judge. I know, however,
that a secret political society can never bring
about pure politics. I know that wherever -the
A. P. A. has come into power its politics have
been a stench in the nostrils of decent citizens.
Because I believe in pure politics I with every
thinking American am opposed to the A. P. A.
question 2.
Does Mr. Yorke object to our attacking any
religions organization attempting to become
a factor in politics?
I object to no one attacking any religious
organization which attempts to become a
factor in politics. lam firmly of the opinion,
that no religious organization should meddle
in politics. I believe that such meddling will
produce bad politics and worse religion, and
because the A. P. A. is a religious organization,
directed and controlled by reverends like Mr.
Hudeison, I am opposed to it root and branch.
question 3.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our aim to preserve
and maintain the Government against all for
eign influence?
Mr. Yorke believes in the Monroe doctrine
for the United States, as well as for Venezuela.
I believe, however, that the Government is
perfectly capable of maintaining itself without
the aid of a gang of foreign conspirators, whose
denunciation of the President's stand against
foreign aggression is still fresh in our memo
ries. Because the A. P. A. is a foreign influ
ence, devised by the ancient enemies of this
Republic to divide our people, I am hostile to it.
- â¢ : question 4.
Does Mr. Yorke regard religio-political or
ganizations as friends to civil and religious
liberty?
He does not. I believe that religio-political
organizations are as . hostile to the American
spirit as they are to the plain provisions of the
constitution. And it is precisely because the
A. P. A. is a religio-political organization that
I consider it not only wrong, but even treason
able.
question 5.
Is it not in Mr. Yorke's opinion unsafe and
unwise to put in office men who owe allegiance
to a foreign power?
I think this country is strong enough to hold
that such a policy might not be unsafe, but I
am decidedly of opinion that it is unwise and
unnecessary. Because the hungry horde of
office-seekers, of which the A. P. 'A. is com
posed, is mainly made up of those whose first
allegiance is to Queen Victoria, her crown and
dignity, I believe that the. A. P. A. is both un
safe and unwise.
question 6.
Is Mr. Yorke an enemy of the free public
school system and does he favor supplanting it
with a sectarian Institution?
He is not and he does not. I believe in a free
public-school system and lam not In favor of
supplanting it with a sectarian system. I be
lieve that the schools to which the members of
all sects contribute should be entirely non
sectarian. Because the A. P. A. has tried suc
cessfully to introduce into those schools such
sectarian practices as- Blble'readlng and thus
destroy their non-sectarian character I con
sider the Rev. Mr. Hudelson's followers the
most insidious enemies . the public schools
have.
â¢ question 7.
Does Mr. Yorke oppose protecting our citizen
laborers from European pauper and criminal
labor, and is he hostile to honest and educated
immigrants who propose becoming American
citizens and will forswear allegiance to every
foreign power? ; - . â : â  * .-._
I strongly favor protecting our citizen labor
ers, not only from European pauper and crimi
nal labor, but also from Canadian paupers ami
New Brunswick defaulters. Because the A. P.
A. by its boycott and labor bureau is trying to
oust our citizen laborers* and. put in their
places unnaturalized Immigrants lam opposed
to the A.P. A :
I am not hostile to the incoming of honest
and educated immigrants, hut I am -hostile to
the influx of immigrants who form, the; main
strength of Mormonism,as they lorm the main
strength of the A. P. A. â¢
jÃ^^ffira'ff'Vft'T'i ' â 8.
Does Mr. Yorke oppose * putting into office
honest and true menâ patriots who are quali
fied and who owe allegiance solely to the stars
and stripes?
I believe that there is no man too honest, no
man too true, no man too patriotic for even
the smallest position of trust under the Ameri
can Government. I oppose putting into office
political preachers', characterless shysters, phy
sicians without practice, business men without
credit, politicians without principle, dema
gogues without education and bigots without
sense. Because this is an exhaustive list of
the active membership of the A. P. A. lam
hostile to that society, and every respectable
American shares in that hostility. ?./-,::
question 9. ' '
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to "loyalty to true Amer
icanism which knows neither birthplace, race,
creed or party" as a first requisite for member
ship in any organization?
That depends. The Native Sons' organiza
tion takes note of birthplace. The Scotch-
Irish organizations take note of race. The
Methodists' organizations take note of creed,
the Republican organizations take note of
party. If an organization is supposed to culti
vate Americanism without regard to
these points there .is no reason why
I should be hostile to it. But when
an organization purports not to take note of
birthplace and ostracises everyone born in a
certain country; when an organization pur
ports not to take note of race and boycotts
every one sprung from a certain stock; when
an organization purports not to take note of
creed and maschinates against every member
of a certain church; when an organization
purports not to take note of party and sells
itself or is sold to a certain political cabal
then I say such an organization is fraudulent,
hypocritical and Un-American. Because the
A. P. A. does all these things 1 am heartily op
posed to it. -,â¢,":.
*>.. question 10.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to intense political ac
tivity and a conscientious discharge of the
duties of citizenship by every individual in the
solution of the problems confronting our
people?
I believe that only by reasonable and intelli
gent political activity and by the conscientious
discharge of. the duties of citizenship can we
solve the problems of. our times. But because
the A. P. A., by placing it* members at the
mercy of an advisory board end by herd
ing them to the polls at the dictation of
a boss or a cabal of bosses destroys that
intelligent exercise of the duties of citizen
ship which the American constitution re
quires, I believe that the A. P. A. is a menace
to the constitution, and I look upon those at
the head of it as the most dangerous enemies
our country has. A society which destroys the
sense of individual responsibility and creates a
caste of political workers fattening at the
public crib is an un-American society, and
such a society is the A. P. A. : : ' - ;.
QUESTION 11. .*> --^v.^/
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our toleration of all
creeds, and does he deny us the right of fran
chise guaranteed by the constitution of the
United States, the right to support or oppose
such candidates as we think proper?
Because you do not tolerate all creeds I am
hostile to you, and I deny you the right to pose
as tolerants of all creeds when -your only
reason for existence is intolerance.
-I do not deny you the right given by the con
stitution to oppose any candidate you see fit;
but when in defiance of that same constitu
tion you make religious belief a condition for
office and oppose candidates because of their
creed, I say you are unworthy of the franchise
and hostile to the constitution. Because you
do this I oppose you. â ' i._r :
question 12. â¢
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our position that sub
jection to and support of any ecclesiastical
power which claims equal if not greater sov
ernlty than the United states Government, and
which is not controlled by that Government, is
irreconcilable with citizenship?
Igo further. I believe that such subjection
to any ecclesiastical power which claims a jot
or title of sovereignity within the territory of
these United States is irreconcilable with citi
zenship. And because the A. P. A. is an ec
clesiastical institution, controlled by ecclesias
tics like the Rev. Benjamin Hudeison, which
exacts the control of the supreme act of sover
eignity, to wit, the franchise, I believe that the
members of the A. P. A. are unfit for citizen
ship. f AAA:V
QUESTION 13.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the upholding of the
constitution of the United States and its guar
antee of religious liberty to the individual ?
I have sworn to uphold the constitution of
the United States, and to no principle of our
American ; polity do 1 render more ready
allegiance than to that of religious liberty.
But because the A. P. A. strives to render that
principle null and void by waging war upon
Catholics and by attempting to drive them
from public, from business and from social life
I believe that organization to be hostile to our
constitution, and 1 consider its existence a dis
grace to our civilization. .
QUESTION 14.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to our position that the
non-sectarian free public school is the bulwark
of American institutions, and does he claim
that it is not the best place for the education
of American children? â¢
I believe that our free public school system
is a necessity to the continuation and pros
perity of our people. That it is the bulwark of
our institutions 1 am not prepared to say, for I
remember that our institutions were estab
lished and flourished for fifty years' before
there was a free public school system. I believe
too that if by any contingency (which God
forbid) our public school system ceased to
exist, American freemen would still be found
able to defend American institutions.
The best place for the education of American
I children is where patriotic and conscientious
American parents choose to send them. The
private schools of the past gave to America
the greatest patriots and the greatest states
men in her history, and I decline' to admit
that the private schools of the present are in
any degree inferior. Freedom of teaching and
a healthy rivalry between State institutions
and private enterprise are the true American
ideas in the matter of education. ;,;..
Because the A. P. A. tries to destroy the non
sectarian character of the public schools and
attempts to abridge the right of American
parents in the education of their offspring, I'
am opposed to it. - I am the more opposed to it
that the leaders of this A. P. A. show by their
writings, their speech and their spelling that
they are unacquainted with the inside of any
school, public or private.
QUESTION 15.
Is MrÂ» Yorke hostile to the principle which
condemns the support from the public treas
ury of tiny sectarian school, reformatory or
other institution not under public control?
. I object to the appropriation of public money
for sectarian teaching, and therefore I object
to the A. P. ; A., which would force sectarian
teaching and sectarian textbooks on our pub
lic schools. *
I do not see, however, why the State should
not support, feed, clothe and maintain its de
pendent classes in institutions under sectarian
control if such support costs less and Is more
humanizing than any which can be otherwise
provided. The experience of California is not
such as to induce the taxpayer to experiment
with many more State institutions.
Moreover/the. dependent children of the
State have as much right to a religious educa
tion as the children of the rich. If the State
'refuses to the orphan what the citizen gives
his child the State is making invidious dis
tinctions between the fortunate and unfortu
nate. Ido not think that Americans have yet
come to that point when they will deny to the
boy or the girl who has been bereft of parents
that religious teaching which they give their
own little ones. - <â  <
Because the A. P. A., would infect all State
institutions with sectarianism and would pun
ish the children of misfortune by refusing
them a knowledge of the faith of their fathers,
I am opposed to the A. P. A. and to the hypo
crites who rule it.
; . QUESTION 16.
Does not Mr. Yorke believe that exemption
from taxation Is equivalent to a grant of public
funds, and is he hostile to the taxation of all
property the title to which is not vested in the
National or State. Governments or their sub
divisions? â â -.-- *-..-â  .*..-
--in non-productive operations, to say that ex
emption from taxation is equivalent to a grant
from public funds is rubbish. I believe that
the exemptions from taxation granted by the
State of California to young orchards, for in
stance, are dictated by sound public policy and
are In no sense grants of public fundi*. '
Moreover, I - believe that in those States
where exemption from taxation is granted to
churches the result is a thousand times more
beneficial to the State than the paltry sum re
ceived in taxation would be. 'â â .
In California- church =; property has been al
ways taxed, and therefore there is no need for
that plank in the A. P. A. platform. â¢
;-â .. Moreover, I believe the Methodist Bishops
and preachers who are agitating this repeal of
the tax are just as good Americans as Mr. Ben-'
jamin Hudeison," and I know that they pay
more in taxes than the whole A. P. A. put to
gether.
question 17.
Does Mr. Yorke favor the enlistment In the
military arm of the Government of any one not
actually a citizen of the United States? '
!"' Any man who is r willing to offer his 'life in
defense of our Government and who swears al
legiance to the. flag is tit to be an American
soldier. .*â ..;â¢ Â,-..-:â¢ *â ; â¢ ... â â¢ â¢ â¢ . . ,_--â â .-.
In the war of of the Revolution and in the
(War .of the Rebellion men who. were not citi

; their blood.; Because' the A. P. A. is mainly
made up of men who in the days ' of the rebel
lion were in * Canada shouting for the Con
federacy or hiding in sugar-barrels â¢to escape
the conscription, or fighting against the Union
; with English guns in. their hands, I am op
posed to the A. P. A. There is neither law nor
gospel to prevent all the members of the A. P. A.
from enlisting. : However, the manliness of. the
soldier never agrees with the canting cunning
of Apaism, and 'if a soi-disant patriot comes
by chance under military discipline he ends
by deserting, like the first of his kind, Benedict
Arnold. - â ; ----- â¢- -

proof of the ability and honest intention to be
come self-supporting American citizens from
all immigrants? - r .- .
I think such a proof is necessary to protect
ourselves against pauper immigration. Be
sides, I am of the opinion â¢ that if such proof
were demanded more strictly along the Cana
dian border, we would be spared the burthen
of many -A. P. A. lecturers who have neither
the ability nor the intention to support them
selves by honest toil, but who strive to make
their livelihood by stirring up religious dis
sension among neighbors. -..;â¢: >\" -â â¢;.. :â¢.-;-"â¢;-
QUESTION 19.
Would Mr. Yorke object to the repeal of the
act authorizing the naturalization of minors
without a previous declaration of intention,
and is he hostile to a provision by law that
persons to be Â« naturalized must speak the
language: of the land and must prove seven
years' continuous residence in the country
from the date of the declaration of intention"?
lam of the opinion that minors who have
been raised and educated in America are just
as competent to become citizens *as the
Canadian or Scandinavian : who has been here
for seven years. I consider it a good thing that
all candidates for citizenship should know
English, but I would remark that if a gram
matical knowledge of the language be exacted
as a condition for registration the A. P. A. will
not be able to muster a corporal's guard at the
polls.
- question 20.
Does Mr. Yorke object to a protest against the
laxity with which our present naturalization
laws are administered?
' Like the purification of politics, this is a
matter which depends much on the Judge
who administers the law. No law should be
administered with laxity.
But when a political society pays its cappers
to gather into Its ranks all the sailors and
vagrants who come into a port I believe it is
laying its plans for an extensive system of
colonization and grafting, and that it is' put
ting a premium on the lax administration of
the naturalization laws by its tools on the
bench. This the A. P. A. is doing right here
in San Francisco, and for this do all good citi
zens oppose it.
question 21. AiA''- A.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the public Inspection
at all times of all hospitals, asylums, reforma
tories or other institutions in which people are
under restraint ? .
Every institution which keeps persons under
restraint should be open at all times to inspec
tion by the civil authorities.
Because the A. I. A. lodges exercise such re
straint on their members when, in session go
ing even to the length of locking doors and
searching visitors by force with threats of bod
ily harm and exhibition of deadly weaponsâ
believe that such meetings should be super
vised by the police.
question 22.
Does Mr. Yorke favor National or State legis
lation in favor of any one section of the coun
try or of any class?
The burthen of law should be equally dis
tributed, and its favors should go to all who
bear the burthen.
When therefore the A. P. A. attempts to de
prive Catholics of the benefits of equal law and
of a proper share in the favor of the State they
are violating this principle, and are striving to
benefit a certain class, to wit, non-Catholics,
and therefore they are detestable in thj eyes of
all fair-minded non-Catholics themselves.
question 23.
Is Mr. Yorke opposed to such restriction of
immigration as will prevent paupers, criminals
and anarchists Irom landing on our-shores?
This question I have already , answered. If
the restriction had been long ago applied to
Canada the A. P. A. would now be minus a
grand president.
question 24.
Is Mr. Yorke hostile to the extension of the
.time for naturalization, to the end that for
eigners may become famijiar with our institu
tions and laws before they be permitted to
vote?
I I think experience has sufficiently demon
strated the fact that the present time for nat
uralization is long enough.^
j A foreigner who is not Americanized in five
years will never be Americanized. Considering,
however, that the leaders of the A, P. A. do not
wait even for five years before beginning the
task of saving the country from the Pope, I
think it is very ungracious for the Rev. Mr.
Hudeison to make any allusion to the subject
at all. .v.
QUESTION 25.
Does Mr. Yorke oppose an educational quali
fication for every voter? Does he wish them to
be ignorant of the duties and privileges of
citizenship and the pliant tools of politicians?
1 believe in an educational qualification for
every voter, and 1 believe in it the more that
I am convinced it would disfranchise the rank
and tile of Mr. Hudelson's own following.
Because the leaders of the A. P. A. are
gathering up the ignorant, the besotted, the
debased elements of the community and
voting them blindly on occasion, I am
opposed to these leaders, and every true Ameri
can is opposed to the society which is the
means of perpetrating such an outrage on our
free institutions. .
, question 26. " â ; 'â 'â 'â '
Does Mr. Yorke oppose supporting from the
public funds one general non-sectarian free
j public school system sufficient for the primary
education of our children?
I have already said that I consider such a
system a necessity. I have also said that the
A. P. A. is engaged in a steady design to de
stroy the non-sectarian character of our
schools, and that for that reason all lovers of
lair play were ranged against the conspiracy.
:'" ,I;-"' .*. V, QUESTION. 27. ' ',
Does Mr. Yorke. favor using public funds
or public property for sectarian purposes,
whether directly or indirectly?
Neither directly nor indirectly do I favor
using public funds or public property for sec
tarian purposes. ;
But if the State sees fit to pay for the main
tenance of its wards at sectarian institutions,
Ido not see, why it should not do so. If the
Stale places a boy out with a farmer and pays
for his clothing . and support, the State is not
contributing to sectarian purposes if the farm
er's wife teaches the boy to say his prayers and
read his Bible.
question 28.
Does Mr. Yorke oppose the taxation of all
non-Governmental property?
I have already answered this question. I re
peat now that if the State wishes to remit the
taxes of non-productive . property or even
of , i productive property . which it
wishes to foster, such remission is not always
against public policy. Each case should be de
cided on its merits. There are no universal
propositions in politics.
question 29.
Does Mr. Yorke oppose the public inspection
of all private schools; convents, nunneries,
monasteries, seminaries and other educational
or charitable institutions?
Most certainly I do, and, for the very same
reason that I would oppose the inspection of
my home. If any institution becomes a public
nuisance or a menace to the welfare of the
State there are laws enough to abate it with
out having recourse to a smelling committee. '
If twenty ladies choose to live in community
I do not see why their privacy should be dis
turbed as long as half a dozen can' live in a
boarding-house and not be subjected to espi
onage.
This demand of the A. P. A. platform is the
onfe which - : rouses - the most disgust
in the minds '.: of â  respectable .. Ameri
cans., It is fathered by men, Mr. Benjamin
Hudeison, whose past will not bear investi
gating. ' If is put forward by the foul-mouthed
and foul-lived satyrs with whom your society
abounds. Such a demand is a disgrace to
Americanism and the curse of God Is falling
on those, one by one, slowly but surely, . who
first put it forward to stain the fair fame of the
best and purest of the womanhood of our land.

now that the A. P. A. owes allegiance to a
foreigner, Traynor, the grand master of Cana
dian Orangeism, and therefore that no mem
ber of It is fit even to be a dog catcher. The
A. P. A. lodges; have to do as Traynor orders

question, 3l.
Is Mr. Yorke in ; favor of granting public
lands to other than actual settlers?
lam not. I believe that those who profit by
the liberality of the Government should make
some return by cultivating the soil. . . â 'â â 
Because the A. P. A. is made up, jn Its higher
reaches at least,' of birds of passage, of men'
who are without stake in the community, men
whose orogress through the country has been
marked by a trail of unpaid; debts, I believe
the A. P. A. violates : the spirit if -; not . the
letter of , this principle, and for the thirty-first
time 1 am able to say that it is condemned"

YORK TO YORKE.
The Liberal Lecturer Says . the
Priest Has Not Answered- His
Arguments.
Dr. J.L. York, the liberal lecturer, sends
the following communication in reply to a
letter from Father Yorke : Â
r _ Mr. Editor : As to Father Yorke's reply in
The Call of last Wednesday to my lecture of
last Sunday night let me briefly say that his
reply is a literary novelty, and while we were
almost overwhelmed with bis deluge of words,
and deeply impressed with his learned dis
quisition, we fail to find any reply in refuta
tion of the salient points contained in our lec
ture. :.','-.'â¢'â â â â  -' ,*;--:-. ->.! '-â â .â . .*-.â â¢â â . "'â â  " : â /â '
_ The subject of mv lecture, "Revelation and
Inspiration," upon which .1 spoke, he replies
to by a play of words about the eternity and
universality of matter, and tells us that "mat
ter is the antithesis of universality," and does
not in reality exist at all, and the reason he'
gives to prove that matter is not eternal is be
cause it can be. burned up as coal is burned up.
But does the gentleman presume upon the Ig
norance of the reader ? Even a schoolboy
should know that as coal it is destroyed; but
as matter it was by combustion convertible
into light and heat, and still exists in other
forms. Will Father. Yorke deny this in plain \
terms, and without verbosity, as life is too j
short ?
Again, Father Yorke says, "that the univer
sality of matter is not a fact, because matter j
can be cut into chunks and some of it put here |
and some of it put there, and therefore it is the
subject of limitation and hence cannot be uni
versal." â  â  .
We were not talking about a chunk of coal
or a chunk of any other of the various forms of i
matter in our lecture, but simply . matter, that !
divine substance of which all things are com
posed. Will our friend. Father Yorke, point
out to the readers of The Call what there Is
that Is not matter or dependent upon material
tor its existence? Ana, again, will he make
another contribution to the science of our day
by revealing to the readers of average acumen
what place there is, and where it is, that mat
ter in some form does not exist? '
-â¢ ?, ther Yorke says that I am unscientific.
well, perhaps I did not express myself with
that degree of perspicuity which I should do, ]
and I promise to do better in the future, but I
will stand by my statements as to the eternity,
universality and divinity of matter, and so
tar as Father Yorke's reply is concerned they
stand unrefuted. Father Yorke says that "Dr.
York has never seen matter, never touched
matter, never came in direct contact with
matter in any shape or form." What a strange
proposition is this. To what purpose and end
are the phenomena of sight, hearing, feeling,
tasting and smelling if we do not come in con
tact with the realm of physics? . -V-:
And if the contact of our senses with matter !
is indirect, what is the medium of contact? j
And whatever the medium of | contact may be i
does not disprove the existence or immortality i
of matter, and I cannot account lor such a
statement unless it be that nature's science is j
not taught, perhaps, to any great extent In
Catholic schools. Or.perhaps as Festus said j
of the Apostle Paul, "Thou art beside thyself;
much learning doth -make thee mad." " And
with such unconvincing proofs of the truth of
Christianity as Father Yorke has furnished in
his comments, we are not able to say with i
King AgriDpa, "Almost thou persuade'st me !
to be a Christian." And yet we may agree to
disagree and get to heaven after all.*- --:>
Father Yorke says, that "When Dr. York says
that matter cannot be destroyed he is con
founding matter with energy or force." Not '
so. We are not making any such mistake. It j
is Father Yorke that is confounding force with i
matter, as he further states that matter has no !
existence and yet is a function of force. This !
is about as clear as* mud. Now, if we know ,
anything, we know that matter is a self-evident
fact, and when I run against a rocking-chair :
and knock a big piece of skin from my shins!
no Christian science, tweedledee and tweedle
dum, now you see it and now you don't theory
can make it clear that matter is nothingâ and !
force a function of nothing.
Such logic as this may do to sustain the J
Christian theology and absurd dogmas of the j
church, but will hardly answer the purpose of I
seekers after truth. Of matter we may know
a few things as we find it in multifarious '
forms. But of force we know of it only as we ,
See it manifested in matter, inherent in i
matter and coexisting with it, and no doubt !
eternal in its existence. *
Father Yorke says my statements are j
puerile. What shall I say to him in a kindly !
| spirit and in truth which will not be puerile? j
And , I am surprised that a man of God, and
i presumably a lover of truth, should so far j
forget himself as to resort to the most paltry i
sophistry and quibbling evasions of the simple I
. facts of nature. And what a pity that reason, |
the light of God in the soul, should be so pros- J
tituted and blurred as to deal in this hair
splitting, subtle -way in his comments on our'
| lecture, which, to draw it mild, is beneath the
'â¢ dignity of the cloth as well as ! the subject
under discussion. â  ' â , *.
And I am reminded by the craft and cunning
of Father Yorke, as displayed in his peculiar ;
style of reasoning, of lather Lambert's book j
and his reply to Robert G. Ingersoll's lecture,
in which Colonel Ingersoll said, "Fire burns,
poison kills and water always runs downhill.'
Whereupon Father Lam berc occupies five
pages of his book to destroy the force of five
little words of Ingersoll: that "Water always
runs downhill.". Father Lambert flatly de
nied the statement, and argued that more
water went uphill in the stems of vegeta
tion in a day than ran over Niagara Falls in a
whole year. Such reasoning and evasion of
truth as this can only be required by men on
the walls of Zlon to prove the mysteries of su- '
perstition. We trust that Father Yorke will !
forgive us if we have been too harsh in our |
reply to his comments on our lecture, and it is '
only the letter which killeth while the spirit
of it was intended to give life and quicken our â 
apprehension of truth.
We scorn the idea, of controvery for the sake
of controversy, and only iv the interest of
truth and sincere belief is debate and contro
versy justifiable, and our modesty in. this re
gard will be regulated by our appreciation of
how little we know of * the great questions
which concern our belief. Knowledge and bo
lief re two widely different things, and as our
realm of knowledge is increased our realm of
theory and belief is proportionately decreased.
And happy is the man who has discovered his
own limitations, as he will then be able to see
the limitations of others. And what a great
bargain it would be for some if they could be
bought for what they really know and sold for
what they half believe and pretend to know
about God and religion, and at the best are
only blind leaders of the blind.
' And as to the great religious discussion now
going on in The Call, and the prodigious
amount of good brains and labor expended on
the part of the A. P. A. and Catholic clergy in
their struggle over the knotty problems of
church and state, it is a good omen. And we
think that this war of words will do much to
enlighten the mass of our people on the great:
questions so vital to the peace and stability of
our Republic.
â  We think it is a good thing that the church
has been called to the front to define her atti
tude to State and school, and that Protestant- !
ism, as well as Romanism, must take the hint I
and keep religion out of politics and hands off I
from our free schools..' ..'
': Of course political shysters and cheap patri
otism have had much to do in promoting a
gospel of hate between Protestant and Roman
Christians, which will cease when Christians
discover that this is not a Christian country
and its constitution is free from religious taint
and yet affords ample protection to all religious
faiths in the enjoyment of religious liberty.

To the Editor of The Callâ Sir:' In my
last letter I set forth the A. P. A. interpreta
tion of the "Objects of the A. P. A." Herewith
I hand yon the A. P. A. interpretation of the
"A. P. A. Platform" and of the "Political Prin
ciples of. the A. P. A.," thereby concluding my
Interpretation of the principles of - the order,
Jou will notice that in several instances I
have ' simply quoted the s sections In their
proper order without any attempt st explana
tion. This I have done for the very good
reason tnat the sections so treated are clothed
in language so simple that their meaning can
not be rendered more clear. "*' .
A. p. A. platform.
i *'1. -"Loyalty to true Americanism, which knows
neither birthplace, race,* creed nor party, Is the
first requisite for membership." ; -yy.'* ' :
, ''Loyalty to r true Americanism" is in our
opinion- such allegiance to the Â» constituted
Government of the: United ! States and I its free
institutions as forbids the yielding of contem
poraneous allegiance to any foreign military;
civil or ecclesiastical power which may claim
sovereignty in any particular over the -Indi
vidual. : .. i. *
; 2. "The association is not a political party and
does not - control the political affiliations' of ; Its
members, but it teaches them : to be Intensely ac
tive :in the discharge lof their political | duties In
and out of party lines because ; it believes that all
problems confronting our people r will ibe -. best'
solved by a conscientious discbarge of the duties
of citizenship by every Individual. ',* , . : ,
7 The fundamental principle of our Govern
ment requires that the will of the majority

the best and only wav to obtain such adequate
expression of the popular will is for every citi
zen to be intensely active in the discharge of
his political duties, both in and out of party
lines..; â  ':, .:..--.
. 3. "While tolerant of all creeds, it holds that
subjection to and support cf any ecclesiastical
power no: ; created and . controlled by ; American
citizens, and which claims equal if" not greater
sovereignty than the Government of the. United
States of America, is irreconcilable with citizen
ship... It. -is, - therefore, opposed to the holding of
oihces in National l or. municipal government by
any supporter of such ecclesiastical power." : ,
This section needs no interpretation. The
statementâ support of and subjugation to any
! power which claims sovereignty is irreconcila-
I ble with citizenshipâ is as niain in its meaning
| as words of the English language can make it.
I A-.4.A "We uphold the , constitution of the United
j States of America, and no portion more than
[ its guarantee of religious liberty to the individual,
, which does not mean that under Its protection any
: un-American ecclesiastical power can claim abso
â  lute control over the education of children growing
I up under the Star and Stripes." " "
We hold that the absolute control of the edu
. cation ; of children , by any church is incom
: patible with religious liberty and is an in-
I fringement of an inherent right of the State.
5. "We consider the non-sectarian free nubile
| school the bulwark of American institutions and
j the best place for the education of American
i children. To keep them such we protest against
the employment of subjects of any un-American
ecclesiastical power as Officers or teachers of the
public schools." .; . â¢
"Subjects of any un-American ecclesiastical
power" are, in our opinion, those who yield
"subjection to and support of any ecclesiastical
power which claims equal if not greater
sovereignty than the Government of the United
States." .:â â¢ .-. .y v-.--.' :: r
6. "We condemn the support out of the public
treasury, by direct appropriation or by contract, of
any sectarian school, reformatory or other institu
tion^ not owned and controlled by public author
' lty." â 
This secticfti condemns the payment of pub
lic funds to private institutions of any kind,
whether for the restraint of the criminal or
the insane or for the care of the sick or the
widowed or the orphaned.
7. "Believing that exemption from taxation is
equal to a grant of public funds, we demand that
uo real or personal property the title to which is
not vested in the National or State governments or
their subdivisions be exempt from taxation."
This section contemplates the taxation of all
non-Governmental property, whether held by
churches, charitable Institutions or private
individuals, and that such taxation shall be
equal. y':0" ;; v'\. ! ~ â¢- ' ' -:"'
8. "We protest against the enlistment in the
United States army or navy, or In the militia of
any State, of any person not an actual citizen of
the United States."
We mean by this section that no person
should be placed in such position that the State
or Nation might, in case of war, have to depend
on him whose first allegiance is due to some na-
I tion with which we might become involved.
! 9. "We demand, for the protection of our citizen
; laborers, the prohibition of the 'Importation of
I pauper labor and the restriction of immigration to
j persons who can show their ability and honest in
tention to become self-supporting American citi
i zens.' " - â¢ 'y , y y
We purpose to secure proper protection for
the wage-earners of our Nation. We are there
fore opposed to the admission of those whose
competition is calculated to reduce American
laborers to pauperism. The restriction to
"persons who can show their ability and. hon
est intention to become self-supporting Ameri
can citizens" contemplates the requirement of
evidences of physical ability, moral character
and ordinary education.
10. "We demand the change of the naturaliza
tion laws by a repeal qftthe act authorizing the natu
ralization of minors without a previous declaration
! of Intention and by providing that no alien shall
1 be permit ted to vote in any State in the Union who
, cannot speak the language of the land, and who
'. cannot prove seven years' continuous residence
in this country, from the date of his declaration of
Intention." - y'yy. .

HOW LEVY WAS CAUGHT.
Deputy License Collector Benjamin
.-. Assumes the Bole of a Countryman,
â¢ and Arrests Him.
' M. Levy, the well-known ticket scalper,
sometimes called "Nibsey," was fined $20
yesterday by Judge Campbell for violating
the license ordinance. * â ;. ';
' It was Levy's boast that he never could
be caught, as he was too wide awake a
customer for the deputy license collectors.
Word reached the License Collector that
Levy was selling' tickets on Kearny street
for the Paderewski concerts, and it was
determined to lay a trap for him.
Deputy Collector C. W. Benjamin on
Monday attired himself as a young man
from the ; country in search of pleasure,
and walked ; along Kearny ;, street with a
faraway 100k 1 * in his eyes. He saw Levy,
and purposely threw himself in his way.
"Say, young fellow," said Levy, -'don't
you want to hear the great Paderewski?"
"Paderwhiskey," said j Benjamin, "who
may he be, friend?"
Then Levy expatiated on the great vir
tuoso's : talents, and wound up by saying
he had some tickets to sell cheap.*
,J "I guess," Benjamin, "I'll take
Sarah -there. Give me two ;of your
tickets.". .
. Levy promptly presented the two paste
boards, and Benjamin as promptly showed
him his badge and placed him under
arrest.

THE PEOPLE BETRAYED.
Management of the Case Against
Pool-Seller Isadore Mes
senger. â 
NEW FACTS COMING TO LIGHT.
Decision on the Pool-Selling Ordinance
Â Was Not a Fair Test of .
the Law. :
A deeper inquiry into the pool-selling
case of the People vs. Isadore; Messenger
tends to verify the belief that the case was
"cooked" to get just such a record of testi
mony before the Superior Court as the
pool-sellers most desired.
In yesterday's Call the facts were set
forth that a police officer, disguised in
citizen's clothing, went to purchase a pool
ticket, but previous to his advent as a pur
chaser the defendant, Isadore Messenger,
knew of his coming, and so the money
tendered was dispatched immediately to
the racetrack by a special messenger. The
Call inadvertently mentioned the trans
action as connected with the Slater case, j
whereas the real defendant was Isadore
Messenger. â¢.
The case was heard in Police Judge
Charles A. Low's court, Department 4.
Notice of appeal was filed August 16, and
appeal papers and settled statements on j
appeal were transmitted to the Superior ;
Court August* 20. The remitteur was re- >
ceived August 23, judgment reversed and !
case dismissed.
Judge Wallace reversed the decision of
the Police Court on the ground that the
defendant simply performed messenger
service, and violated no law in sending the
money to the track for investment.
Facts coming to clearer light now show,
beyond reasonable doubt, that there was
collusion somewhere to get a decision on
an incidental issue, and not on the merits j
of the ordinance, against pool-selling.
When Patrick Sullivan, an officer of tbe |
police force, went to Isadore Messenger's j
place in the disguise of a citizen to buy a
pool card on the races the defendant, Mes
senger, knew that Sullivan was "a cap
per," as he expressed it, for the police.
An investigation will be instituted to ascer
tain from whom Messenger got the tip.
The police authorities who engaged to
niake'the arrest were surely betrayed by
some one in the service or the confidence
of the department.
The case was so managed in Department
4of the Police Court that Judge Low's
suspicions were excited.' At the time of
the trial ana since then he -imparted his
doubts concerning the integrity of the pro
ceedings to John T. Dare. Yesterday Judge
Low was asked to mention the incidents
or circumstances which aroused his sus
picion, and he said very frankly that the
case was not conducted on either side with
the vigor or spirit indicative of earnest- |
ness. He observed that counsel readily I
agreed to one theory or another, which led |
him to suspect that an arrangement to I
agree had been formed.
Judge Low is convinced that the law
prohibiting pool - gambling will be sus
tained, if a test case reaches the Superior !
Court, on the merits ot the ordinance. He
does not regard the decision on appeal in
the Messenger case as a test of the law.
The papers in the case were not accessi
ble yesterday afternoon, but when they
are produced close examination may be
made to ascertain if the statement on
appeal was fair to the cause of the people.
The records, however, do plainly, show
that there was little time lost in getting
the case heard in the Superior Court and
in making up the official record that the
decision had been j reversed and the case
dismissed.
The business of pool-selling in Messen
ger's house was not seriously embarrassed
by the proceedings.
When the wheels of justice move In a'
preferred case the revolutions are exceed
ingly rapid, but in other 1 cases where tho
interests of the people demand, speedy
trial the wheels move provokingly alow.
MAY CLOSE THE SCHOOLS
Board of Health to Demand
Better Sanitation of
Buildings.
Dr. Hart Declares the Supervisors
Must Act to Save the Lives
of Children.
â¢ Dr. Henry : H. Hart and Dr. J. M. Wil
liamson, a committee from the Board of
Health, will appear before the Finance
Committee of the Board of Supervisors this
morning to ask that the urgent necessity
fund be employed to put the schools of the
City in a proper sanitary condition. .
The two doctors have spent considerable
time in investigating together with the
Committee on Buildings and Grounds of
the Board of Education and J. P. Kincaid,
superintendent of school buildings.
"We must have the schools put in better
condition," said Dr. Hart last night. "Onr
committee is going to demand funds to do
this to-morrow. The board can get the
money somewhere. If they : refuse it we
will close such ; schools as we have found
unfit for habitation. â¢ . *
v "And there are many of them. Dr.
Lovelace reported a list last September
that were in unsanitary condition. The
schools he condemned were Sutro Pri
mary, Mission Grammar, . Webster Pri
mary, Lincoln Grammar, Everett Gram
mar, Marshall Grammar, Buena Vista
Primary, Columbia Grammar, Fairmount
Primary, Bernal Heights Primary, Horace
Mann Grammar, Irving Primary and
Cooper Primary. Only one of these, the
Sutra School, has been put in proper con
dition. One other school, the Richmond
Primary School, has also improved.
Abatis all. : . â  .
i"Why. in the Marshall Primary School,
back of the Mission Grammar, they have
open wooden vaults.' ' Besides this the
drainage pipes leak and the floors of the
yards' are saturated with the discharge.
wooden vaults are always a menace
to health. They allow, the sewage to . seep
through and the walls- and surroundings
retain the filth for years. ,
.'.'The committee of the Board of Educa
tion are heartily in co-operation with us.
They - promise ; to assist 'in pressing , the
matter as much as possible. ;Tiiey realize
as well as the Board of Health "that the
lives of .'thousands of children and their
teachers are jeopardized by delay. The
summer months will soon be here. The
first hot days will expose ; all tnose attend

"I know that the Board of Health does
not intend ; any hardship toward the pub
lic nor the school-teachers," Dr. Hart con
cluded,."tut there is nothing of more im
portance to us than the health and happi

RANK PERJURY
Judge Buck Announces From
the Bench That He Will
So Hold.
THE BIG BROWN CHECK.
It Was Not Given to a Baden
Roustabout, but to a Woman
for Wine.
MOVE TO REOPEN THE CASE.
1
Depositions.of a Sensational Character
Indicating Prodigality in Ten
derloin Resorts.
In the proceedings to remove Jesse S.
Potter as executor of the will of Charles
Lux a move was made yesterday at Red
wood City such as will give a new cast to
The Check Drawn by Jesse S. Potter in Mrs. Young's Resort, Concerning Which He Is Said to Have
Perjured Himself.
the case. Jesse Potter is charged by the
attorneys for the petitioner, Henry Lux,
with perjury. The affidavit of James H.
Campbell making this allegation was sub
mitted, backed by depositions of Samuel
E. Beaver, C. Z. Merritt, Edward Mar
chand, Fannie Haworth and Mrs. S. P.
Young.
Presenting these D. M. Delmas asked
that the submission of the case be set
aside, and that the cause be reopened for
the admission of the testimony.
The depositions were under seal. This
incident of the alleged perjury attaches to
tne $SOO draft which figured in the case as
having been drawn by Potter in favor of
John . Brown, roustabout, employed at
Baden.
The court wanted to know if the counsel
were merely anxious to enlighten the
court, or trying to complete its record with
the Supreme Court in view.
Mr. Delmas said he hoped they would
not be obliged to go to the Supreme Court.
. Judge Buck said that while he did not
i propose to announce his decision at tnis
J time he would find that perjury had been
' committed in this particular.
"I do not think any sensible business
man would loan $800 to a roustabout with
out some security," he continued. "I don't
believe a business man would do it. I take
that view of it in my decision thus far. My
decision is not completed as yet."
Garret W. McEnerney of counsel for
Jesse Potter demurred "to the whole pro
ceeding. He stated that as a matter of
law the motion should be denied: An at
tempt was being made to tender an issue
which, if true, would not constitute a
ground for Potter's removal. He said also
that the offense occurred subsequent to
the commencement of these proceedings
and as such could not be introduced. He
claimed that there was no question about
Potter's business integrity and that his
veracity was not an issue.
D. M. Delmas of counsel for plaintiff
disagreed with Mr. McEnerney and said
that the idea advanced by the latter was
certainly a most novel and startling
proposition â for a leading witness to con
fess perjury and yet deny the right of the
court to consider it against him. He con
sidered . the. evidence material. An ad
verse decision to either side would most
. likely lead to an appeal. If the decision
was favorable it would strengthen their
position before the Supreme -. Court, while
if the decision was unfavorable it would be
too late to ask that the evidence be in
troduced.
Judge Buck announced that be had
some aoubts about his right to grant tbe
motion and he would take it under advise
ment.
Formal notice was served last evening
upon the defendant and his attorneys that
a formal motion will be made on the 20th
inst. before the court asking that the cause
be reopened and the affidavits and deposi
tions going to prove that Potter committed
deliberate perjury in his story of the $800
draft. ../,..-. V
On the stand and under oath Potter, con
fronted with the draft made out in favor of
John Brown, said that Brown was a roust
about employed by Miller & Lux at
Baden and that he, Brown, had subse
quently, while he was in the northern part
of the State, sent the money back to him,
Potter, through Wells, *. Fargo & Co.'s Ex
press." -'*_ â 
In going over the business in detail; Mr.
Delmas made the discovery that this draft
had really been made by Potter while he
was stopping in | the disreputable house of
Mrs. 8. P. Young; that she had endeavored
. to get Edward Marchand, the caterer, to
cash it; that Marchand had taken it to
Miller & Lux. and they, upon Marchand
indorsing it, gave him a check on the Cali
fornia Bank for the amount.
Following are the material points of the
deposition made, by Mrs. Sadie Powell
Young in answer to questions put by Mr.
Barnes:

When was that? That was in 1892.

quaintance? In November, 1892; the 14th day

remember.
Who had the eighteen bottles? I decline to

Yes, sir; I have sold him twelve bottles in a
day.
I asked you if you sold . twelve bottles of
wine on that day. Yes, sir.
Did you, on March 2, sell three bottles?
Yes, sir". > '
Did you, on March 4, sell five bottles?
Mr. Barnesâ l object as incompetent, irrele
vant and immaterial, and not cross-examina
tion; and furthermore as being misleading
and improper in form, in that the gentleman
asks if she sold five bottles of wine upon a cer
tain day, which is apt to confuse the witness,
not calling to her attention the fact whether or
not it is a specific item upon the book to which. .
the inquiry is directed, v
I don't remember whether I did or not.
The same objection was made. In this
way, statement by statement, the witness
was taken over the original ground under
cross-examination, how she kept the books,
and every detail of the transaction, with
out evolving any materially new point. '
In her deposition Fanny Howartb,
housekeeper for Mrs. Sadie Young at 312
Stockton street, and formerly at \ 205 Post,
stated that the draft in question signed by
Jesse Potter was â . given to her by Mrs.
Young with the request that she get her
husband to cash it. She gave it to Mr.
Marchand, and subsequently he or some
one in the restaurant gave . her the cash;
$800. She gave the money to Sadie Young.
Mr. Marchand in his; deposition tells
how he took the check to Miller & Lux
and secured another from that firm on the !
Bank of California, and E. Z. Merritt,
cashier for Miller & Lux, and Samuel E.
Beaver, paying teller of * the bank.'tell of
their part in the transaction as stated. All
these depositions are in the hands of the
court, and it is the effort of the counsel for
the petitioner to have them made a part
I of the record.
JUDGMENT FOR SUTRO.
J. D. Thompson Fails In His Snit
'â¢Against the Mayor. ~
Justice of the Peace Cook decided the
case of J. D. ' Thompson-' against Mayor
Sntre in favor of the defendant yesterday.
:; During the last campaign suit was
brought in the name of Adolph. Sutro.
E. M. Wardell, W. H. Mathews : and J." V.
Webster -against ''Alfred J.; Evans, then
Registrar of ; Voters, 1 P. A. Dolan and
others to prevent the name Populist or :
Populist party being used on ballots.
A temporary injunction was granted by
the court, the plaintiffs putting ; up a bond
in the sum of $500 with the plaintiff in
the present action , and J. â¢W. Swales as
sureties. : Subsequently the defendant
Dolan went into court with his â â  attorney
and succeeded " in . having the * injunction
dissolved, the costs falling on the plaintiff.
Dolan had contracted : a , bill of ' $200 for
attorneys' fees,' which was subsequently
transferred to Ira G. Leek, who demanded
and received from 1 ; Thompson, as bonds
man, that amount. *" -,-\ ;:;.;â¢ . y
Mayor Sutro refused to pay the amount,
on the ground that; he had not authorized
the use of his name in the case and knew
no reason why he should be held respon
sible. The court ruled that ; , the evidence
was not sufficient to show the Mayor had
authorized any one to use his name in the
matter and gave judgment as stated. :-;:;',

The William J. Rotch and

: Vladivostok;
LARGE INCREASE OF ORDERS.
Trade Has Grown Over 300 Per Cent
. Between This Port and
Russia. .' '...'/
Two fast-sailing vesselsâ the ship W. J.
Rotch at Fremont-street and the barken
tine Chehalis at Harrison streetâ are load
ing for Vladivostock, Siberia. For several
years trade between San Francisco and
the Russian port has been steadily grow
ing in importance, despite the fact that
the German and Dutch firms have been
reaching across Siberia toward the prin
cipal Russian seaport in the Pacific, and
also that the ice closes up that harbor from
j October,;to April. However, efforts are
now being made by the imperial Russian
Government ' to keep the harbor open by
running powerful tugboats around the bay.
This breaks the young ice and prevents the
bay from being closed up against com
merce for six or seven motnhs of the year.
Another offset to trade with Russia is the
currency question, and the silver jof that
country against the gold of . this does not
work to a smooth interchange of commo
dities between the two countries.
Last year about $300,000 worth of goods,
principally flour, meat and salt, were
shipped to Siberia, and this year it is esti
mated that the exports from San Francis
co to Vladivostock will be valued at over
$500,000. The flour is used on the Siberian
railroad, now in course of construction, to
feed the great number of Cninese and
Japanese laborers. The meat is princi
pally for use- in the political. prisons and
the salt for fish curing. Some canned
fruit,, a few smail consignments of beer
and a large quantity of agricultural imple
ments: find their way to the shores of
Siberia.
.'. The Rotch and Chehalis will carry away
almost 5000 tons and sail about the" last of
this month. There is a large number of
firms who have received contracts to load
consignments for Siberia. Hawley Bros.,
the wholesale hardware merchants, have
chartered the Rotch, and Roth; Blum &
Co., 201 California street, have the Cheha
lis. Roth, . Blum & Co., the South San
Francisco Packing Company and the
Western Meat Company 'â  will send large
consignments of beef. Several firms have
contracts to export about 6000 barrels . of
flour.. There is indisposition among the
houses having. contracts to state the ex
act value of the exports, but they acknowl
edge that ; the orders from the Russian
Government are unusually large this year.
The fact that the Government lis
determined to make Valdivostock the
rendezvous for their Pacific fleets of cruis
ers in view of war-cloudy affairs around
Japan and China has much to do with the
rising importance of that port. Its loca
! tion - also makes it a future customer for
San Francisco commercial houses."
Besides the sailing vessels . chartered
each year for Siberia every steamer for the
Orient takes large quantities of goods con
signed to Valdivostock, which are shipped

EEAL VAIN CATS.
How One- Feline - Showed Her Low of
; * y Admiration.
Cats are susceptible to little attentions,
such as spreading a rug or laying a cushion
for them, and exceedingly tenacious of
their rights of possession. .*> Besides . their
baskets each of mine has a cushion which
is kept in one place, on 'which she is
trained to lie,* to prevent her, covering the
furniture with hairs..; Only two have been
completely broken of the habit, and Lalla
has so exclusive a sense of properly in hers,
which is in the corner of a sofa, that if she
sees a human being- resting his head or
elbow on it she posts herself on the floor
before him, < looking " him ; out of â¢â  counte
nance until he moves. Once a visitor
threw her cushion into ' a chair and sat on
it. As he disregarded her mute protest
she walked away, but would not lie ;on it
for k weeks afterward. This jealousy of any
thing like a privilege or ; prerogative shows
itself in them all. ** : vA~. '.''â _ -r â *' .'â¢â .';: â -.< V>y

A HERMIT PORTY-NINER DEAD.
1 His Last, Moments Measured by the
Ticks of the Clock He Had Made.
Ebenezer Brnndage, an eccentric hermit
of patriarchal aspect, died at Orange City,
N. J., the other day in a rude hut on the
old racetrack in East Orange. -He was un
educated, but he was a good talker, and
was locally celebrated for his versatile me
chanical and artistic talent. He made
cigars and clocks and painted pictures.
He got a living chiefly by selling eggs and
poultry.
There was only one room in his hut,
against which he had built a coop for his
150 fowls. In front of the house he had
put up a board on which he had painted
"Eggs from the nest-" Hanging on the
un plastered wall of the hut was an octag
onal clock which he had made himself and
which had run down about the time he
died. His last effort in. painting was the
portrait of a woman that adorns her home
on Main street, near Hawthorne avenue. â¢
Brundage was 81 years old. It is said
that he left a wife and two children in

returned to the East thirty years ago and
went to Newark. His children had grown
up and be has lost interest in them. He
then began his solitary life. ;â 
Brundage's room was bare of ornament.
He never swept away the cobwebs, but let
the dust accumulate on everything. The
floor was bare, â¢ save for a small piece of
carpet near his cot. He cared a good deal
for his personal appearance, always keep
ing his long white hair and beard well
combed. He slept on a pillow of corn
stalks that he had made himself, refusing
to use a big feather pillow given to him by
the woman whose portrait he bad painted.

THE INVENTOR OF JOVIAT
Dr. Emile Blomen, the Noted
Chemist, Has Arrived in
the City. .
EXPLOSIVE NAMED AFTER JOVE.
More Powerful Than Nitro-Glycerine,
Yet Can Be Banged About oV
at Will.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental it
Dr. J. Emile Blomen of Washington-,
D. C, professor of physics in Columbia
College and inventor of the new explosive,
joviat.
This is a very strange and most destruc
tive explosive, with the power of nitro
glycerine, yet it may be handled with
impunity. Stories in regard to the dis
covery of the new explosive were tele
graphed here some months ago.
Dr. Blomen has come out at the instance
of Senator Perkins and . ex-Senator Felton
to make arrangements for the manufac
ture of joviat at the California Powder
Company's works, near Berkeley, in
which they are interested. Joviat has be
come with them so important and neces
sary an explosive that they are going to
make it. The inventor has, therefore,
been perfecting arrangements there for its
production. Several experiments have
been attempted already, and everything
is said to be working out all right. â â 
Dr. Blomea says the new explosive may
be. banged around in any and every way
and yet be perfectly safe. It may even be
placed on a railroad track and cars run
over it, yet it will not explode. Nothing
can render it dangerous till it is exploded
in the novel way provided, and that is by
a percussion cap.
It will be some time yet before the Cali
fornia Powder Company will have every
thing in shape. Dr. Blomen will be here
several months. It is said that the in
ventor has already made a comfortable
fortune from his discovery.
He was seen yesterday," but declined to
go into extensive details in regard to the
joviat. The explosive takes its name from
Jove, who hurled all the thunderbolts and
ruled even the gods. Extraordinary in
terest has been taken in joviat ever since
it was discovered. >.** -.-

MR. WILDERMAN'S
MOTIVE EXPLAINED.
Dr. Brown Tells Why the
Co-Operative Society
Opposes Him.
THE STORIES WORTHLESS
Mrs. Cooper Does Not Deny
That Her Witness Is
Mrs. Tunnell.
A MRS. BADDIN DISCOVERED.
She Suddenly Disappeared in December
and Has Not Since Been
Heard Of.
"I have no objection to stating now
what I might have done some time ago,"
said Dr. Brown yesterday, in response to
an inquiry concerning the character of the
witnesses who have so far appeared against
him. -^^-J^PW
"It must have been noticed by the gen
eral public," continued the reverend gen
tleman, "that these witnesses who have
been so willing, nay eager, to say some-*
thing harsh of me, are in some way con
nected with the institution known as the
World's Co-operative Society. This man,
Wilderman's opposition to me, and he has
no doubt influenced members of the Co
operative Society who testified to. things
which it is impossible for them to know
anything of, is easy of explanation.
"Shortly after my return from the North,
in January of last year, I received a letter
from Rev. Jonas Bushell of Port Angeles
asking for certain information. He said
that a branch of the World's Co-operative
Society had been established there, and,
wnue no one seemed to doubt its sound
ness, he wanted me to find out its exact
standing and the character of the men at
its head. '
"After much difficulty I found Wieder
man in a little room on Fourth- or Sixth
street, I have forgotten which now. There
was a broken-down lounge, an old table
and a greasy-looking man in the room,
who said he was his secretary. We talked
for an hour about the society ana its. re
sources. I found that the latter consisted
of a patch of desert land in Southern Cali
fornia. It was an utterly visionary schema,
and only required a little thinking to see
it as such.
"Wilderman asked me what I thought
of it and I told him frankly it was mainly
a scheme to get the initiation fee of the
unwary. I remarked to him that I would
write the results of my investigation to
Bushell of Port Angeles. Wilderman
seemed alarmed and asked me to look fur
ther into it before taking this step. How
ever I did write as 1 said. A few days
after this Wilderman called on me at my
office. He tried to remove the impressions
I had of the Co-operative Society, but 1
again said to him that I thought it a vis
ionary scheme. My letter to Bushell re
sulted in his coming here and he made a
personal examination. He then said to
me that if he had taken my advice he
would have saved many dollars to say
nothing of the time lost in coming to San
Francisco.
"This in brief is the animus which in
spires Wilderman and his associates to
make damaging statements concerning
me. These people know absolutely noth
ing against my character, for the principal
reason-there is nothing to know. At the
proper time I will have more to say about
them, particularly one or two who have
been most unceasing in their efforts to put
me in a false light before the public."
Mrs. Brown and her husband continue
to receive letters from all over the country
indorsing the course followed by the for
mer in the controversy with one of the
leading members of the First Church. The
pastor's wife gave out a few of these letters
yesterday, the first beine from a Presby
terian minister of New York, and in part
is as follows:
Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher did herself honor
in the hearty and vigorous support she gave
her husband in his trials, and I am glad to see
that Mrs. Brown stands faithfully by her hus
.band. The wise and good are generally taken
good care of by time, and often allowed to re
turn pity and kindness for scoffing and con
tempt. There is no lack of good people inter
ested in this case.
A well-known religious writer of this
City expresses his "admiration for Mrs.
Bro* in and abhorrence for the attitude of
Mrs. (Cooper" in the following manner:
San Francisco, Cal.. Feb. 8, 1896.
Be . Dr. Brownâ My Dear Brother: I wish
to express my deepest abhorence for the atti
tude of Mrs. Cooper and my equally strong
admiration for Mrs. Brown.. * * * Mrs.
Cooper resembles Andrew Johnson in the mat
ter of swinging around the circles and in ver
bosity as to personal merit. Mrs. Brown's
conduct justifies the highest admiration. Will
you be kind enough to say to her that both
Mrs. and I think so?
An Oakland correspondent declares that
she is "so excited over Mrs. Cooper's dev
iltry" that she cannot refrain from pen
ning the following lines:
Â»- Oakland, Feb. 12. 1896.
Dear Mr*. Brown: I am so excited over Mrs.
Cooper's deviltry I cannot refrain from pen
ning you a few dines. Can't they see through
that woman? She is bad enough" to be Mrs.
Baddin. I heard a person say that she wrote
to Rochester, Mich., and went to see every one
who had lived there, or who had friends who
would write there and find out all she could to
use against Dr. Brown; that she has also writ
ten to Oberlln, Ohio. If Mrs. Stockton is a bad
woman, I consider Mrs, Cooper far worse. Mrs.
Cooper is trying to ruin her pastor. Why does
she not leave the church if she does not like
Dr. Brown? If there was nothing wrong with
herself she would not be watching to find bad
things in others. I wouid like to bring some
things to her mind that happened before she
came to California. God bless you and yours.
"One of the highest officials in this
City," said Mrs. Brown yesterday, "met
my husband by chance to-day and he said
that he desired to express entire.sym
pathy and confidence and ' also utter
abhorrence at the way in which the facts in
the case have been handled. He said fur
ther that Mrs. Cooper's attitude seemed to
be beneath contempt, j 'The idea,' he said,
'of a woman seizing on a few statements in
advance of all official investigation and
presuming to pass judgment upon them;
yes even daring to openly condemn the
character of a gentleman of' high stand-'
ing. It is so preposterous that I wonder
bow the community endures it; much
more, I wonder how the church tolerates
it.' I happen to know that this is the
view held by many of the best people of
this City.'-'
The statement of Mrs. Barton, published
In The Call of yesterday, to the effect that
the mysterious witness of Mrs. Cooper is
ho less a person than' Mrs; Tunnell, ; re
ceived practical confirmation yesterday
from Mrs. Cooper.
"I must tell you, as I have others," she
â¢aid, "that I have nothing â  to' say, at this
lime. Ido not think it would be right at
this time."
"Do you deny that Mrs. Tunnell is the
witness in whom you place so much re
liance," was asked.
â¢ "No, I do not deny it, neither, will I
. iffirm it," was the evasive reply, and that
iv as as far as she would discuss the matter.
Mrs. Barton insists that she has made a
lorrect' guess, however, though she exer
cises a discreet silence as to the source of
tier information.' < MSffi_-MMBB(R_S'*^(S
Among the letters - received by Mrs.
Cooper } yesterday was one from *â  the wife
of Senator J; E. McComas of . Los Angeles.
It reads as follows:
I.os Angeles, Feb. 12, 1896.
Dear Mrs. Cooper: Mv heart goes out to you
and it tells me you will triumph. Your grand,
strong character will stand you in good stead.
I could not resist the impulse to drop you
this little word of confidence and loveâ not
that 1 think you need it so much, but because
I feel like itâ just to let you know I am think
ing of and sympathizing with you in this hour
of vexation. Believe me, your sincere friend,
. Alice M. McComas.
The editor of the Santa Clara Weekly
expresses "great admiration" for Mrs.
Cooper in the following letter: / .
San Jose, Feb. 11, 1896.
Mr*. Sarah B. Cooperâ My Dear Madam: I
trust you will not deem it an intrusion that I
obey a strong impulse to express to you my
great admiration of your heroic and womanly
course during this very trying season In your
life.
I can well appreciate, that it has been no
easy matter for you to take the stand you have
done in obedience to the demand of conscience
and right.. That you are possessed to a remark
able degree with the courage of true and noble
convictions is apparent to every clean and

lowed yov: course. I am myself a Catholic,
but also an earnest admirer and champion of -
Christian womanhood wherever found. For
this reason I beg to be permitted to thus pay
my respects to you and assure you that I earn

you through whatever may await you in the
course you have laid out. . Most sincerely and
respectfully, Carrie Steven? Walter. ,
Mrs. Kate Tupper Galpin, one of the
leading women in the Women's Parlia
ment of Southern California, living in Los
Angeles, in a letter dated February 8,
writes as follows:
My sympathy goes out to you and your
daughter, dear Mrs. Cooper, in this recent
Brown matter. Your courage is wonderful,
and could only manifest itself in a cause where
your conviction of right inspired it. How
hopeless it seems this war against man's lust
and chambering. May God give you strength
and courage for this painful struggle.

At least a Mrs. Baddin, who is described
as a woman of a peculiarly bold disposi
tion, has not been seen since a short time'
previous to the â  eruption that - turned
public attention upon the pastor and
some of the members of the First Congre
gational Church.
Over on the : south side of Bernal
Heights, at the end of Kosciusko street,
lives a carpenter named Reinecke. It is
with him that Mrs. Baddin had several
business conferences, terminating in a
visit to his house about December 2 of last
â  year.
The first time she came, as Mr. and Mrs.
Reinecke together told the story last
night, Mrs. Baddin, for she wrote that
name on a * slip of paper, said that she
wanted a shanty built on one of her two
lots close by, as she wished to store her
furniture there. Her manner wa3 so flip
pant that Mr. Reinecke felt no hesitancy
in joshing her during their conversation
over the estimated cost of the small Duild
ing. . He said that her short curly hair
and her boldness impressed him at once
with the idea that she was not a particu
larly proper woman. At that visit she
mentioned her residence as Mission street.
Subsequently she called several times
when only Mrs. Reinecke was at home
and on one occasion was accompanied by
two young girls, aged about 18 and 16,
whom she introduced as her daughters.
The older one she said was a dressmaker.
But it was not until her last visit that
Mr. Reinecke satf her af an. Then she
i talked of going down to Monterey to live
in a summer place she owned about a half
mile from the Hotel del Monte, and where
she took summer boarders.* She also sug
gested that possibly; she might soon Vgo
East on a trip to show her daughters some
of the sights.
Chancing to pick up a copy of The Call
she pointed to; an advertisement; of rooms
to let somewhere on Geary, street, remark
ing that that was where she .lived." And
this only increased her auditors', donbts in
the woman, because only a short time be
fore she had said that she kept furnished
rooms at Mission and Sixth streets.

were being discussed ; Mrs. Baddin, in a
very cunning way, suggested that she be

How Rhodes Works.
â  "Cecil Rhodes has no private life,", says
an English admirer. "Scorning delights,
he lives fiercely laborious days, his only
pleasure in his work a self-denying hu
man steam engine, always traveling at
full speed, in tow of a lengthy train of
responsibilities into an unknown region of
possibilities, whose horizon continually
recedes. His ambitions do not turn toward
.social distinction, but rather to Â£ ace in
the nation's remembrance as a faithful and
useful servant." Somewhat different is the
following estimate of him by the London
Saturday Review: "Cecil Rhodes :is a
strongman, of the kind that is never fin
ished by a single stroke. And he is strong
with the strength of a coarse, ruthless,
greedy y egotism, the strokes of â¢". whole
pistonrod force the minds and the money
of weaker men into its reservoir. As he

tuated his defects to the point of disease,
and .made him so irritable, so self-ab
sorbed and so insolent that none but para

RECORDS KEPT IN STONE.
Frank Shea's Discourse on the
Church and Archi
tecture.
GROWTH OF THE BUILDING ART
Rome's Great Influence on Its Im
provementâlllustrations With
the Stereopticon.
Frank Shea, the well-known architect,
delivered a most entertaining and instruc
tive lecture last evening at Metropolitan
Temple under the auspices of the San
Francisco Educational Union. His sub
ject was "The Church and Architecture."
He spoke as follows:
Architecture is a book of stone. â¢ So the poet
has said. I Each monument of the ages fixed in
the world's great highway is a page. It is in
short the embodiment of history and civiliza
tion in imperishable materials. Had all the
sacred chronicles and profane history perished
the architectural remains would have formed
a means of tracing with accuracy the progress
of civilization. - Â«*
. The speaker then incidentally referred
to all the notable architectural relic* of
ancient and .medieval times. Babylon,
Persia, Egypt. Greece, Rome, were in turn
mentioned. Continuing he said:
Civilization was tottering on the ragged edge
and architecture had no friends. Chaos was
I about -to reign, when Christianity radiated to
the confines of the world. It was on the
Greeks it made the first impression, and the
Greek Christians created in the great Church
of St. Sophia in Constantinople the form of the
house of worship which is still to-day the type
in use. I refer to the form of the cross, em
phasized at the center by the* transformation
of the square plan to a circular plan or dome.
in the meantime the followers of Mohammed
were forcing their way toward Egypt, and
finally settled on the banks of the Nile. They
here created the type of architecture known as
the Moorish, founded, however, on the Con
stantinople type. This form reached its high
est excellence in the Alhambra in Spain.
Here then in the East, with the nomadic
warriors on the south and the barbarians on
the north, with hope apparently fading, did
the church preserve architecture throughout
the dark ages. It sent forth Into Europe its
scholars and teachers of the faith, who spread
the spirit of Greek- Byzantine architecture and
art along the eastern coast of Italy. It was the
church, by its indefatigable labor and un
paralleled sacrifice, which preserved the
Eternal City of Rome with its sacred monu
ments from total destruction at the hands of
the Goths. Vandals and Lombards;
It reared its churches and monasteries here,
there and everywhere, and transformed the
ancient buildings into tabernacles of the Lord.
Charlemagne, wishing in the name of the
church to improve the architecture of France
end Britain, imported art and architecture
from Italy. Through his efforts the monastic
or Romanesque style of architecture became
disseminated throughout the northern portion
of Europe. * , â¢
As the nations of the West matured and with
them grew the church, the demand went forth
from all lands for a more ecclesiastical style of
architecture. In the thirteenth century all
firecedent was cast aside and magnificent and
uxurious edifices arose. These structures
were the embodiment of all previous architec
tural science. \ Half a century passed before the
type of Gothic architecture reached its height
of glory in the cathedrals of Notre Dame, St.
Denis, Rouen, Rheims and Amiens in France.
What a story they tell, these stately piles, of
lofty aspirations and brotherly love. But the
reformation came and brotherly love : was no
more. Architecture stood still in the reign of
anarchy and confusion. At the same time
Rome was torn from the inside and outside by
its enemies, -but the great church still con
tinued to foster architecture, bnt it made little
advance in Southern Italy. ; - â . y
â  But the churcn at last performed its work,
and under the influence of the church a new
era began to dawn in the twelfth century,
when Vienna, Sienna and Pisa reared their
great cathedrals.Â°aÂ»BajaÃMi
This was an era of the revival of the archi
tecture of Rome. It was an era that made
Italy the cradle of architecture, giving sam
ples of the science that all nations may aspire
to imitate, but none hope to surpass.
What the ancient nations nave failed to do
the church ; has accomplished,- perpetuating
the art of building for all time to come. ; Had
the church done nothing more for humanity
than transmit her monuments, she would have
done enough. ->'g > . J _B_Hsg_Â£ . â¢
- From her edifices spring all ideas of modern;
domestic, civic and religious architecture.
Without her monuments half the beauty of
the world would be lost. Without her monu
ments the currency of Europe would be largely
. contracted by the loss of the revenue from
tourists.
a-: So come what may to . the defenders of the
faith, though the storms of enmity .rage
around and about them; their monuments
shall stand, splendid and adamantine, for all
ages, protected alike by friend and foe, as ever
lasting testimonials of the glories of the
church.
:_â  For all the world believes, in this great age
the truth, which, in the words of Goldsmith,
slightly transformed, maybe thus expressed:
111 fares the land, to hastening tils a prey,
Where her monuments accumulate and then de-
Cay. â  "
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade.
A breath can take them as a breath has made.
But architecture Inspired, a country's pride, . â¢
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.
At the conclusion of his lecture a pic
torial review of the growth of the art and
science of architecture was provided. for
the audience by means of stereopticon
Views. It began â¢ with the portrayals of
the places of worship of early India,
Egypt and Nubia, then depicted the mag
nificent piles of Greece and Italy and later
the more modern and beautiful structures
of France, Germany, Spain, Belgium and
Great Britain.
As each huge reflection appeared on the
canvas, Mr. Shea described its architec
tural peculiarities and added his individual
criticism of the various styles and their
use, in some few cases being not at all
sparing of words that were far from praise.
A telling effect was produced when the
. interior of King Charles' magnificent
chapel (a portion of Westminster Abbey)
was in view. , , ââ¢
After a few words appropriately leading
up to the -climax,- the faint peals of an
organ, as if coming from the heights of
the ? organ-loft of the chapel, were heard,
and then came the apparently far-distant
voices of the choir in sacred chant. .The
peculiar solemnity of the scene was ; most
, realistic, ; and > the â¢ a wed silence of > the
audience was such that the faintest sound
of organ sor voice was distinctly audible.

Old Family Records.
In speaking of the , recoros of the Pro
vincial Court of the province of Maryland,
from 1657 to toe Revolution, now preserved
in Anne A Arundel County, the Baltimore
Sun says: "The historical value of these
old records is ; inestimable. It is believed
that no other State in the Union has such
records of family history showing the
manner of living among the people of the
colony as far back as 250 years ago. In the
wills families can be traced from father to
son for a century. The court record books
containing inventories of personal; estates
make a complete exhibit of the character
of â :.. household furniture, kitchen imple
ments, farm utensils, ' etc., : used by the
early settlers and their descendants during
the first century -and a half of the colony.
From - these things we can read much of
the habits and customs of , the people."
THEIR BEST DRESSED MAN.
Why Captain Langnortliy Was Sent on
â  an Important Mission.
It is no . reflection on the bravery or
other soldierly qualities of Captain Lang
worthy of the Twelfth Wisconsin to say
that he was not a fop. He never pur
chased an officer's uniform, and when he
was commissioned his rank was modestly
designated by bars sewed on each shoulder
of the coat which had served him while a
sergeant. -, It need only be added that his
commerce with the sutler did not betray
any extravagance in the matter of soap.
Sherman had marched from Atlanta to
Savannah and desired >to inform the ad
miral commanding the flotilla on the river
of his arrival. It was a perilous duty, in
volving a trip through a region daily tra
versed by bands of Confederates and more
than an even chance of being captured.
In view of these facts it would have been
in the highest degree imprudent to give
the scout any written message, and he had
to be , trusted to deliver his* orders by
word of mouth. An order for the detail
of an officer to perform this service was
sent through. corps, division and "brigade
headquarters until . it reached the ' colo
nel of the Twelfth. He had no hesi
tation in selecting Captain Langworthy,
who was a natural scout, as wary
as he was brave. With great difficulty he
made the trip on foot through marshes
and underbrush and when he reached his
destination it can be imagined that he was
a thing of shreds if not of patches.
Arriving at the Dank of the river he sig
naled the flagship and the admiral. sent a
small boat and took him aboard.. He was
ushered into the presence of the admiral,
whom he found surrounded by- officers
dressed in the handsome uniforms of the
navy. He gave ; his name and rank and
stated that he bore an order from General
Sherman for the flotilla to effect a junc
tion with the land forces. The admiral
looked at him with amazement and heard
the message with suspicion, then he sent
him out under guard. i&gSKg * ,' > ;
After an interval he was again sum
moned into the presence, when the admi
ral addressed him as follows:
"Captain Langworthy, if you are a cap
tain, we have decided to act upon the order
which you say you were sent to convey ;
but we have decided also to put you on
the prow of the first gunboat to go down
the river."
It was thought that if he was a Confeder
ate in disguise, sent to lure the flotilla on
to torpedoes or other agents of destruction,
he Tould weaken on hearing this an
nouncement; but he betrayed no uneasi
ness, and the suspicions of the admiral
were in a measure allayed. After some
general conversation he addressed the cap
tain as follows: .
"Captain Langworthy, will you please
inform me how you came to be selected
for this duty?" %
"Certainly, admiral," replied the cap
tain. "General Sherman recognized that
this was a mission of great dignity. Our
army has had a hard march from Atlanta,
and our bagsaee train has not yet over
taken us. In short, tbe fact is, admiral,
I was chosen because I was the best
dressed man in the army."
The admiral looked at his associate
officers, clad in their bright uniforms, then
at bis own apparel, and then all of them
laughed,* while Langworthy looked hurt,
as if he thought they were laughing at
him.
"Laugh, gentlemen. Some day real in
stead of play service for your country may
undo some of your fine feathers and gild
ings," said our hero in rage.
; "Why, captain, we were not laughing at
you. The dawning of the real situation
made us laugh. We longer doubt you ;
that explains our merriment. We are at
your service. You can have this whole
flotilla if you want it."
. Then the admiral gave orders to move,
and at the same time directed that Cap
tain Langworthy be supplied with the best
there was to eat and drink on the vessel
and such clothes as he needed. â J. A.

HEE PASSWOED WAS GOOD.
How a Richmond Girl Obtained Admis
sion to See the President.
Miss Nellie Parker, one of the belles of
.this city, again renewed her acquaintance
with President Cleveland last Saturday.
It will be remembered that at the un
veiling of the Martha Washington monu
ment at Fredericksburg in May. 18&4, Miss
Parker . met the President, and at
the banquet that evening the chief Â»
executive . " presented the Richmond
beauty with a penny, laughingly re
questing her to keep it as a souvenir of
the occasion. Miss Parker again met the
President at Atlanta on Virginia day, one
of the first questions he asked Governor
O'Ferra 11 being, "Where is the young lady
to whom I gave the penny?" Upon seeing
,her he asked her if she still had the coin,
to which she replied that she certainly
had, and that it was framed in gold. â¢
Last week Miss Parker was visiting
friends; in Alexandria, and went over to
Washington on Saturday. She thought
she would call upon the President at the
White House.'and did so, being accompa
nied by Colonel L. C. Barley of Governor
O'Ferrali's staff. It so happened that the
President at thai hourâ which was shortly
after noonâ was busily engaged in a con
ference with a committee on the Venezu
elan question, and one of the servants told
Miss \ Parker that he did not think the
Executive could be seen then. Miss Par
ker, however, wishing to see if the Presi
dent still remembered the little incident,
wrote upon : a card the following words:
"The girl you gave the penny to." Its
presentation promptly gave her an audi
ence with the President. She was shown
to Secretary Thurber's office, and, when
tbe committee had left, she was ushered
into the presence of Mr. Cleveland. *:
The ; President seemed delighted to see
her, and spoke of the little incident at
Fredericksburg when he had given her
the penny, and which he remembered dis
tinctly. â Richmond Dispatch.
Origin of Two Tavern Terms.
The term "entire," so often seen over
inns and taverns (and not always under
stood ,by the passers-by) is said to have
firÃt been used about 1722. Prior to that
date the malt liquors in general use were
ale, beer and "twopenny." It was usual
for tavern customers to call for a pint or
tankard of half-and-halfâ that is, half ale
and half beer, half ale and half twopenny,
or half beer and half twopenny. In course
of time it became necessary, to call for a
tankard i oil "three '? threads," meaning a
third of ale, beer and twopenny. To save
publicans the trouble and waste of turn
ing three taps , for ; one; pint of liquor a
brewer named Harwood conceived the
idea of making a beverage ': which should
unite the flavors of all three drinks. He
called bis production "entire," or "entire
butt-beer. As it was considered suitable
for porters â ; and other working people, it
is said to have obtained the further name
of "porter." London Daily News.

IT WENT TO WASHINGTON
The Resolution Against the Re
funding Bill Was Not
Lost.
MR. COLNON'S EXPLANATION.
He Telegraphed the Measure to Con
gressman: Maguire the Day It
Was Passed.
â  President Colnon of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners has been pursuing a quiet
investigation for the past few days that
has effectually set at rest all uncertainty
regarding the fate of the concurrent reso
lution of the - last Legislature against the
passage of the Reilly refunding bill by
Congress that was supposed to have been
lost at feacramento and never transmitted
to Washington. <
"I was Governor Budd's private secre
tary at the " time the resolution .was
passed," said Mr. Colnon last evening,
"and as the law requires that all such
measures must pass through the secre
tary's hands, the statements that the reso
lution had been lost and never trans
mitted to Congress seemed to me to be a
reflection on my conduct in office. -â¢'
"As soon as I saw the Examiner's story
on the matter I telegraphed to Assembly
man Belshaw of Antioch, the author of
the measure, asking whether he remem
bered the matter and whether he knew
that it had gone on to Washington. Of
course, I knew myself that it. had. Mr.
Belshaw replied that .he. remembered it
perfectly.
"Then wired the following message to
Congressman Maguire at Washington:
Did you receive Assemblyman Belshaw'.
resolution against the Reilly bill. If bo, what
was done with it?
.Â» "His answer, received to-day, was as fol
lows:
Received the Belshaw resolution and -pre
sented it to the House. It was referred to the
Committee on Pacific Railroads.
"Going still further into the matter, I
found in the Congressional Record a re
port of the presentation of the resolution
on the floor of the House and the state
ment that it had been referred to the Com
mittee on Pacific Railroads.
"The Examiner of the following day con
tained in its Washington dispatches a
paragraph to the effect that the resolution
had been received and referred to the com
mittee mentioned. ljH_pÃ_S__
"To make sure I wired to Sacramento to
the Controller's office to ascertain whether
there was a bill the =* for telegraphing the
resolution, and fou .d that there was one
of $26, or something like that.
"I believe that there is no record of the
receipt of the bill at the Governor's office,
but this arose from the fact t-.at the Reilly
bill was then before Congress and might
be taken up at any. moment, as it was
urgent that the resolution, if it was to do
any good, must be sent on at once. There
fore I did not wait until it came back from
the printer's, as was the usual custom,
but sent it at once, the very morning it
was passed."
SALMON ON ICE.
Boniface Chace Establishes Himself a*
the Cham_>lon Angler.
John R. Chace, mine host of the Pacific
Ocean House at Santa Cruz, must be a.
mighty fisherman, judging from the num
ber of salmon sent by him to this City.
Recently he chartered a refrigerator ; car,
and with a special engine hurried a car
load of . frozen salmon hitherward for dis
tribution among his friends. With the
fish was a message that he had only been
trolling with one hand thus far, and that
when he started in earnest to thin out the
finny denizens of the vasty deep a big'
drop in the piscatorial market might be
expected all along the coast.

before the turn was reached Garner put an
additional twist on Lizzie H, almost yank-,
ing her back onto her haunches. Straight
ened away for the wire, Cochran on Unity
moved up, and nearing the finishing post
Earner on the favorite let out a link and
pulled over between the pair where the
track was deepest. In a â¢â¢terrific" finish
Hazard won by a neck, with Unity second
half- a length before the favorite. The
time was I:3o>_â very slow. Garner's ride
on Honig's mare, who was simply choked
until the last 100 yards, was such a peculiar
one that it created a sensation, and a big
crowd gathered around the judges' stand.
The judges, however, overlooked every
i thing tor the time being and those who
[ expected to see bets declared off were dis
j appointed. Later the sheets were sent for
and Garner was suspended pending an in
vestigation.
Outside of this one- unpleasant feature
the day's sport was most enjoyable. The
; favorites did not carry off first honors, for
but two were successful in winning purses,
but all of the winning horses were well
supported. .
The Australian starting-machine was
tried with marked success in the two
| year-old event, which opened the day's
! racing. With one exception the young
sters broke away on nearly even terms.
; In a hard drive the 13 to 10 favorite, Ingie
; side, won from Seven Up by a short head.
: Coady, on the sccone choice; Modestia,
was slow at getting in motion and ran un
placed.
The 2\_ to 1 choice, Schnitz, for the next
event at six and a half furlongs was in
front almost from the jump and won
easily from Fortuna. Artist ran an im
proving sort of a race, finishing third..
The iron horse Logan again suffered de
feat in the mile and a sixteenth purse race,
starting an even-money favorite. YanKee
Doodle with Garner up was backed down
from 2>_ to 1 to 8 to 5, and after running
under wraps to the stretch came on and
won easily. Logan was an easy second,
with Del Norte finishing in the show.
Pittsburg Phil's mare, Derfargilla, was
the favorite for the five furlong handicap
at even money and 6to 5. Mobolasca was
a heavily played second choice at threes,
with the "Kansas City Hindoo," George
Miller, third in demand. The latter horse
took the lead before a furlong had been
covered, and, never headed, won cleverly
by a length and a half from Mobolasca.
j Pat Murphy, with 50 to 1 about him,. was a
good third. The favorite was beaten ' a
furlong from home.
Louis Ezell's speedy mare', Babe Murphy,
came out in the last race,. a six and a half
furlong sprint, after quite a rest, and was
made a 4 to 5 choice. Backed from sto
2)4 to 1, Morven, with Jones up, shot out
in the lead and, -never very hard pressed,

passed the judge's a length"* before Braw
Scot. '-. The favorite finished a good third.
' Track and Paddock Items. -'
Both of the six-furlong races on the card
to-day will be dispatched by the Austra
lian starting-machine.
''Billy". McCormick 'has resigned his
position as trainer for the . Nevada stable.
George Grant, manager, for Theodore Win
ters, will hereafter handle the string.
John Cochran has departed for bis home
In St. Louis, where he will, begin shaping
up his two-year-olds for the summer sea
son. George Cochran will handle the
horses left in California.-
It is said Trainer Hunn will soon send
the grand racehorse Joe Ripley to the post.
Sam Doggett has tired of California and
will depart for the East on Sunday. Sam
is a great favorite with racegoers, "and his
splendid finishes will be greatly missed.
And now it is said George E. Smith
(Pittsburg Phil) will dispose of his horses
in training and leave for a tour of Europe.
> The management at Ingleside have in
prospect a great attraction for the closing
day of the present meeting on .Wednesday
next. "Daggle" Smith, the owner of Oak
land, has been anxious to put his horse
against Cadmus at two miles, and as the
owner of the latter horse, A. B. Spreckels,
is perfectly willing, efforts are being made
to get Claudius and Fred Garner to enter,
making a four-cornered contest for $500 a
corner, with ?500 additional added by the
association. The maximum weight car
ried would be 110 pounds, with six . allow
ances. This would, prove: the greatest
drawing card of recent years, and it is to
be hoped this great quartet of distance
horses can be brought together.
EZETA HEARD FROM AGAIN
Nearly Killed Himself : Running
Away When the First Shot
Was Fired.
The Marion and Alert Both Damaged
in South American/
Waters.
Ezeta and his filibusters have been
heard from again.
The United â  States steamer Alert ran
across the Barclay Golden near Panama,
and the officers of the American vessel are
still laughing over the general's fiasco. It
appears that when firing began at a. point
near Acajutla Ezeta nearly broke his neck
in getting behind the sacks of coal that were
piled on deck. His sword got between his
legs and he measured his length on the
deck. His head went into an open ven
tilator and his frantic efforts to escape
every time a rifle was fired from -the shore
nearly cost him his life.
The news from the Alert came in a
private letter which arrived yesterday. It
is dated at Panama and gives all the move
ments of the sloop-of-war. On her way
to Callao she was caught in a cyclone and
considerably damaged. The letter states:
"We were a sad-lookine wreck when we
reached Callao. Head booms and fore top
gallant mast gone and twelve feet of the
bow crushed in. But after forty-six work
ing days of good hard endeavor every
thing was made shipshape again."
Another vessel of the navy was in trouble
and the letter treats it in this way:
"The Marion arrived a few days before
we sailed. She came in under canvas, her
engines having broken down. It will take
her six, or eight weeks to get into good
order again, and then the chances are that
! she will have to go back to Mare Island."
According to the communication the
j Alert will go to Puenta Arenas from Pan
ama, thence to Amapala.'-La Liibertad. San
i Jose, Acapulco, I Manzanillo, San "Bias,
I Mazatlan and Pichiluque Bay. A few days
will be spent in each port, and from
Pichiluque Bay the warship will come to
San Francisco. .....
Speaking about Ezeta the writer says :
"The Barclay Golden arrived here
Monday, bringing Ezeta and his party of
despeiadoes. Their expedition turned out
to be a fizzle. They landed two or three
! men at Salvador, a few miles below Aca- i
' , jutla, but they were driven off by a few '
, soldiers. While the shooting was going :
| on Ezeta hid behind the sacks of coal piled
j up on deck, and he did not show up again
until the tug was out of- range. Eighteen
cases of .arms were seized by the Colom
bian Government and 'the general' only
escaped by the skin of his teeth. Ezeta's
jig is probably up, and his followers have |
I lost faith in him since he ran away at the I
' first rifleshot and nearly broke his neck in
the ventilator. There 'will be no revolu
â  tion in Salvador."
j When the Zealandia was at Panama
Ezeta wanted to take passage for San
.Francisco. The captain refused him a
â¢passage, as he was afraid of trouble at the
first Salvadoran port. The chances * are,
however, that he will be back here inside
of a month.;.
FOE THE NEW HOSPITAL.
The Societa Italiana to Give a Mardi-
Gras Ball, Which Prince I.ulgi
May Attend.
Society circles of the Italian colony are
agitated over the Mai .li Gras and Carne
vale di Venezia to be given next Tuesday

j pital fund. The affair .is to be given at
j : Washington-square Hall, corner Stockton

Elaborate preparations are . being made
to have the carnival an artistic success.
The society will have a number of novel
features and valuable prizes have been
offered to induce competition in the mat-
I ter of costumes. Already many tickets
i have been sold. " .*-â -.-
A committee waited upon the officers of
the Cristoforo Colombo yesterday with an
invitation to attend. The captain prom
ised to allow a number of his officers the
desired leave, and the sailors will be
largely in evidence in their picturesque
uniforms. It "is expected that Prince
Luigi himself will attend, but only as a
spectator. \

DECLAEED A BOULEVAED
Drivers of Heavy Vehicles Are Warned
to Keep Off. Golden Gate Avenue

; - Chief Crowley on Wednesday received a
certified copy of the resolution passed by
tho Board of Supervisors last week declar
ing Golden Gate ; avenue a boulevard, and
instructing him ' to cause the arrest of all
persons driving over the ; avenue with
heavy wagons.
The Chief notified Captain Wittman,
and yesterday a special cordon of police
men, . including, two mounted officers,
patrolled the avenue and a] warned the
drivers of all heavy vehicles of the action
of the Board of Supervisors. The names
of the drivers ; were taken, and they were
informed that if caught on Â« the avenue
again they would be placed under arrest; â .

R. S. Lopez, Envoy Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary from Salvador to

[Sketched by "Call" artist.]'
member for several previous terms. He is
an attorney. While the Ezetas were in
power he was an exile, and found an
asylum in Guatemala. r y
.He says that Antonio Ezeta's byplay of
capturing Salvador by his cruises on the
Barclay Golden is the laughing-stock of
the whole of Central America.
"Ezeta is now at Panama," said he, "and
there I suppose he will remain. There is
'one thing certain, and that is that he is
without friends in Salvador. -.*â¢â .,
"When be came cruising along the coast
between 7000 and 8000 men came to Presi
dent Gutierrez. and offered their services.
They were largely businessmen, too. They
simply were ready to close their doors and
bring their own guns. ;â . y .
"Ezeta's j strolling about with his new
uniform, golden epaulets and cockade hat,
and pretenses at a right to rule Salvador
, may win the judgment of some people,
but it will have no influence-, in Salvador.
We know him of old. V â *'â¢'::
"The Ezetas when in power were simply
bandits and Calieulas. ; They robbed .the
treasury and citizens, and killed those who
were in their, way. lam sorry their deeds
are not known abroad as they should be.
If they were, a closer bond of sympathy
would exist between ..other countries and
Salvador. As it is the impression prevails
that Salvador is really at all times a semi
barbaric country. This is not so.
"Salvador is quite prosperous at the
present time. I expect to remain in
Mexico City for at least six months before
again visiting my country. â¢ I will sail from
here to Acajutla and thence cross to the
City of Mexico."

THE POKEE MEN WIN.
Judge Campbell Declares That the
New Ordinance' ls Uncon
stitutional.
. Sixty-four poker- players arrested Mon
day night in the Cafe Royal .rooms were
released yesterday afternoon by Police
Judge Campbell. . ." . \' A
The ordinance against poker-playing in
barrooms and .public places, passed . re
cently by the Board of Supervisors, .was
the basis of the; arrest, but Judge Camp
.bell declared that not only he believed the
ordinance \ was unconstitutional, but >he
also knew that the meaning of the Super
visors was not to prohibit poker-playing
except in open places accessible to every
body and in full view of people entering
barrooms and public places.
It was intended that Judges Low and
Conlan would sit in bank with Judge
Campbell to try this case, but the two for
mer magistrates declined at the last mo
â¢ ment. 'â¢-â¢-: "A- : i'*A â  '"â¢' "',.â .. â "" -a; A:.a-;:'Aa . a ':
â¢;,.; The defense showed that in all the games
prohibited by the laws of the State poker
was not mentioned, and :; that the ordi
nance, passed by the Supervisors did not
make a pretense to prohibit that game.
The ordinance was only passed to regu
late the playing of the game.,'; The main
regulation it intended was that it be not
played in a barroom.
;. In- the particular case at issue,, it was
shown by the testimony of. the arresting
officers that the place where the game was
conducted was in a room adjacent to the
barroom, and that no - minors were per
mitted, therein. -v As the ordinance says
that ; it is unlawful to i play poker - with
minors in a room adjacent to a barroom or
other public place, it was evidently *. the
intention of the Supervisors to : not . place
a restriction on' anybody but a" minor, and
not an adult. *

THE BUILDING TRADES.
Perfecting the. Plans Upon Which They
y: Will Conduct Their Business.
The second meeting of the recently
organized Building Trades Council .was
held last evening and the delegates were
highly ' pleased to admit . the delegate of
the Lathers' Union into the council.'; As
published recently in The Call, the car
penters will present a protest at the next
meeting of the Supervisors against the
employment of police officers as carpenters
in repairing the police stations. They ask
that money be appropriated for the, em
ployment of a ' carpenter. The Painters
and Decorators' Union will also present a
similar potition that regular painters ,be
employed in; the painting work for the
Fire Department. At present the regular
firemen are doing all of the painting in
and upon the engine-houses. The council
last evening indorsed both of the petitions
and protests. "*.'".."â¢'.-â  â  â 'â â¢ .
There was considerable discussion rela
tive to that part of the by-laws which will
deal with the working-card system and
the duties of the walking delegates or
business agents.
It was deemed advisable that all the
trades in the council receive their working
cards from the council, and thus insure
uniformity. Cards will .'be issued quar
terly. The matter of business agents was
not finally decided. It was the opinion
that two or three would have to be con
stantly employed, who will look after the
interests of all the trades in the council.
When the business is in better \ working
order, the "shop steward" system' may be
adopted. That is, on every job select one
man who will be held] morally responsible
for the enforcing of the union rules among
those who. work with him. He is to report
all violations and grievances to the busi
ness agent of -the; council, who will in
vestigate and ', correct. This system is
operated successfully in the East.
THE POOR LOSE A FRIEND
Death of Mrs. Amie Powell Bur
gess, Wife of Doctor o.'
0. Burgess.
| A Lady Well Known for Her Exten
sive Though Unostentatious
Works of Charity.
The cause of -charity has lost a stanch
supporter in Mrs. Amie Powell Burgess,
wife of Dr. 0. O. Burgess. Four years ago
Mrs. Burgess had a severe attack of the
grip, from which . she never fully recov
ered, the disease r< turning year by â  year
with additional severity. The weakened
condition of _ the lady's health left her a
read}' prey.to acute disease, and ten ; days
ago she took to her bed never to rise from
it. Her death, which' was easy and ap
parently free from pain, took place at 3:45
o'clock yesterday morning, her last ; mo
ments being cheered: by the presence of
her husband,' whom she knew to the last.
. . Mrs. Burgess. was born in New York City,
about sixty years ago, and was a mem ber"
of the distinguished Powell family of that
city. William :H. Powell, the .'famous
artist, :, was one ?of " her brothers. At the
age of 27 years she was united in marriage
to Dr. Burgess. The wedding took place
in New York City, and was quite an event
in the social world of the metropolis. j Her
life . with i her * husband was a most happy
one, save for the fact that their union was
not blessed with children. However, the
good lady tasted the joys of maternity by
constituting herself a mother to the chil
dren of ; misfortune * and privation. Her
charities were not of an ostentatious type,
but her name was hold in benediction by
the poor, who always found, in her a
friend in need. "â¢: - .
A Soon 15 after her â  marriage â  Mrs. Burgess
came with her husband to San Francisco,
where she united in membership with the
congregation of Grace Church. She; soon
became identified with the charities under
control of that organization and also look
a leading in the work of the Young
Women's Christian Association, and other
non-sectarian institutions of benevolence.
Up to . the ; .time of â - her " death - she â â  ; was a
valued member of. the Associated Charities,
in the work of which she : took a deep and
constant interest. - .v",-.-; ..â 'â¢.- ; y .- A'- ,-aâ
â¢ y The ? funeral | services, which t are to 'â â  be
strictly t ; ; private, y will take ;. place at- the
Burgess residence on Geary street at 2
o'clock Saturday ? afternoon, "the â¢ Rev. Dr.
Foute, rector of Grace Church, officiating.*
Dr. Burgess - ; is for the ::; present entirely
prostrated by the * severe visitation which
has come upon him.*.; At the same time he
expresses a deep appreciation of the con
solation afforded him by the condolences
of his many warm friends in town. - j
LAND FOR THE NEW HALL
Property Adjoining the Site on
Washington Street for
â  .Sale. .
$55,000 ASKED BY THE OWNEES
The Matter Will Be Placed Before the
Board of Supervisors by G. H.
Umbsen.
It is probable that the architects who
have drafted plans for the new munici
pal . building which is to occupy the site!
of the old City Hall may have to plan
again, as those who own the lots adjoin
ing the old hall site have reached an agree
ment and placed their property in the
hands of G. H. Umbsen with instructions
to dispose of it as a whole to the City for
the sum of $55,000. The old hall occupied
almost the entire block surrounded by
Kearny, Washington and Merchant
streets and Dunbar alley. The remaining
portion of the block is occupied by three
buildings. The one situated on the corner
of Washington and Kearny streets is
owned by Amelia Cohn, Abraham Cohn,
Caroline A. Simon, Meyer Cohn, Flora
Hamburger and Daniel Cohn, and covers
1620.62 square feet. The adjoining build

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
a* station indicate maximum temperature for the
days: those underneath It. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted slow- in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, oonnec: points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiah" means high tarometrlc pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather:' "low"
rtfers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" â  usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
an.! low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the -low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
I ill produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Feb. 13.- Speculation at the
Stock Exchange was in the main strong to-day.
At Intervals, however, the market reflected the re
cent heavy liquidations, and more especially in
the case of Sugar, which lagged throughout. The
opening was strong, London having turned up as a
. buyer of St. Paul and Louisville and Nashville.
The recent favorable traffic returns of these two
companies seemed to stimulate foreign purchasing.
The main factors, however, were, first, the general
belief that matters are so shaping themselves that
an early and amicable settlement of - the Venezu
elan question is likely and. second, the heavy re
ceipts of gold at the Sub-treasury, widen is steadily
bringing the gold reserve up to the traditional
$100,000,000 mark.
Rumors from Washington that the Senate free
silver amendment to the bond bill will be defeated
by a big majority In the House to-morrow contrib
uted to the good feeling. Minor causes at work
for higher prices were the refusal of Attorney-
General Hancock of New York to bring an action
against the Central Trust Company In the matter
of the reorganization of the company and the
splendid exhibit of the American Tobacco Com
pany for the year. Tobacco was the special feature
and oounded up from 79V4 to 83*-/_. Later on there
was a drop to HO I . _ and a recovery to 82yi.
Chicago Gas opened iy 8 higher at 66L_ on the
Hancock decision, and then rose to 69y_'on cover
ing by shorts and buying tor the long account.
Sugar closed H/g higher at 112%, after selling at
llis/sÂ®l i2Â»4. The. advance i. refined had but
little influence, and the stock was less ac ive than
of late. General Electric was stronger and rose to
32 on reports Metropolitan Traction had
adopted the company's underground trolley sys
tem m the railway group Louisville and Nash
ville, the grangers, Manhattan. Heading. Jersey
Central, Big Four and Kansas and Texas preferred
were most prominent.
The rise in the railway list ranged from y 2 to 38/ g
percent. At one time Missouri Pacific broke from
24 :i 4 to 23i<s and recovered to 245/g. This break
led u> selling of Western Union and Manhattan.
In the last hour, However, when Chicago Gas
bounded up to 68 14. the whole market improved,
and the prominent issues sold at the best figures
of the day. Specu atlon closed strong, with prices
anywhere from y_ to 33/ 8 per cent higher on the
day. Total sales, 248,500 shares.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lix., Feb. 13.â There was no particu
lar news on wheat either of a favorable or unfav
orable nature this morning, and the market acted
In an erratic manner, advancing and declining
frequently within a narrow range. . There was a
moderately good trade, but nothing of a remark
able character was noted. The Cincinnati Price
Current, reported the winter wheat plant in need
of snow protection, but the storm of the past forty
eight hours afforded the necessary relief in many
sections. The receipts were lair at 157 cars for Chi
cago and 832 for two days in the Northwest. The
latter section had 960 for a like period a week ago
and 157 for one day a year ago. Liverpool cables
were quiet and slightly easier. Local inspections
from store amounted to 180.946 bushels. Export
clearances at the Atlantic seaboard, mostly for
two days, amounted' to 400.663 bushels. Closing
Continental cables were generally lower. The
market developed strength on fears of frost, and
aner the first two hours advanced and held firm.
May wheat opened from 65y2C to 65s/ B e, advanced
to 66% c, closing at 666,3 c asked, lc higher Chan
Tuesday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 200
cars. WWmW_t^Wlig
CORNâ The storm had. the effect of strengthen
ing corn, as it added to the diillculty of moving
grain in the country. The weak moments In wheat
detracted from .the firmness of the coarser grain,
but strength succeeded In each Instance. Receipts
were 190 cars and 83.420 bushels were taken from
store. Liverpool cables were quiet and unchanged.
Export clearances amounted to 396.037 bushels.
May corn opened at 29% c, advanced to SOVic,
closing at 301, gO, "Vie higher than Tuesday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 326 cars.
Exhibited the same trait ajas corn and
were governed by that grain's action. Trading de
veloped no feature of interest. Receipts were 173
cars. The Cincinnati Price Current made refer
ence to restricted Interior marketing due to bad
roads. May oats closed V_c higher than Tuesday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 263 cars.

. THE FUTURE LOOKS RRIGHT. .
A New York View of the Effects of the
AAa-AAA, Bond Issue.
The circular of Henry Clews, the New York
banker, says under date of February 8: "As to the
bond issue, Wall street is deeply impressed with its
value as a new uplifting element in the general
situation, and the feeling is general that Its real
effects have yet to come. At one stroke it puts the
whole investment interest of the country upon a
higher status. It exhibits a vast unemployed'
home source of investment that had not been sup
posed to exist. It reveals us la a position of re
source which we had not credited ourselves with
having attainedâ namely, that of a people with
vast accumulations of capital ready to be loaned
for long periods at low rates of interest. What
Europe has been to us. as a source of procuring the
means for internal development, we now find we
have become ourselves. This uplifting of the veil
reveals to us the United States emancipated from
dependence upon future foreign lending and
capable of framing its destinies from its own capi
talistic power.
"It is understood that an important sum of the
loan goes to the German Reicbsbank. and that other
sums have been awarded to representatives of
Continental investors. -These engagements place
so much to our credit in Europe and will have an
easing effect upon the foreign exchanges, which,
according to current symptoms, do not seem likely
to give us much inconvenience for the next few
months. Thus the conditions affecting Wall-street
interests and the general busine s of the country
have entered on a new and entirely more hopeful
phase, and the current year should show more
prosperous results than were realized in 1895.
"The im mean demonstration- of the American
people in bidding for the United States bond loan
was largely inspired by the recent majority action
of the Senate. The effect of so brilliant i a 'success
of the loan will be magnetic, both at home and
abroad. It insures the credit of the Government
on the 'basis of the world's best money. It will
give confidence to everybody in trade circles. , It
will be the signal for a new vigorous departure
with everybody connected with commercial enter
prise, and a return of confidence in every channel
01 business. It will change the competition in the
stock market to the buying side. in place of, as
heretofore, the selling side. This will . especially
apply to European dealings in our securities. We
are in for a steady bull movement of important
dimensions and for a prolonged period." .

MINK AT ADAMS POINT
The First One Ever Caught
in the Oakland
Estuary.
POLICE FORCE TOO SMALL.
There Should Be Ten More Patrolmen
Added to Chief Lloyd's De
partment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 13. j
Charles Chambers, watchman at the
wharf on Adams. Point, caught a black
mink there to-day. It is the first animal
of the kind ever found in this vicinity.
There have been other fur-bearing ani
mals caught about the estuary in the past,
but the mint: is entirely new to these
parts. The animal is now, in a cage in the
show-window of a Broadway druggist,
where it has attracted much attention
during the afternoon from citizens pass
ing by. "
WANTS MOKE MEN.
Chief Lloyd Believes the City Is Not
Properly Protected.
â [OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. Chief of Po
lice Lloyd has been considering the force
at his command and comparing the city
with others, and finds Oakland is about as
poorly protected as any city in the Union.
There are thirty-seven officers, thirty-one
doing night duty and six day work.
"It we had a force as large in proportion
to our population as San Francisco has,"
said the Chief, "we should need seventy
more men. Kansas City, a place of 75,000
people, has 150 regular officers, or one to
every 150 people. We have one to every
1300. Our city is harder to patrol than
Kansas City because it is more scattered,
and we are singularly pestered with San
Francisco crooks, who can run over in a
very short time, do their work an J set out
of town almost before I can get a man at
the different avenues of escape to inter
cept them.
"With only six men patrolling the city
in the daytime how can I have the trains
watched? I don't know of a city in the
United States so badly off for police pro
tection as Oakland. This is not an off
hand statement, for I have msde a study
of it since I have been in office. I have
not a man for special detail work, and if I
call one from another part of the city it
absolutely denudes that beat of protection.
If an officer is ill I have no one to put on
in his place, for the officers are allowed
pay during sickness and there is no fund
out of which I can employ a special or
substitute officer." . ' â  '
J. E. HIGGINS' FAILURE.
Was Badly Involved in the Fresno
Raisin Company.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. 13.â James E.
Higuins, an accountant and a stockholder
in the La Favorita Raisin Vineyard Com
pany of Fresno, filed a petition in in
solvency to-day, in which he stated his

engaging in the business of electric light.

trary, in that in one place- it alleges that
do plans and estimates were made, while
in another it is shown that such plans
were prepared and estimates made. De

pears that the city will engage in supply

Her New City Hall Dedicated
With Speech, Song and
Dancing.

the Completion of the New
Municipal Home.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 13. â A large
American .flag was suspended from the
tower of the new City Hall yesterday, naif
draping it at the front. Seventy - five
smaller flags of varying sizes 'were dis
played about the interior in the way of
decoration, besides many signal flags ob
tained from shipping masters. Consider
able preparation was made for lighting the
whole house. Electric lamps were ar
ranged everywhere and the whole interior
was ablaze. The library-room, which is
immense in size and which has not been
put to the use for which it was intended,
was decorated and prepared for the ball.
The floor was waxed and the bunting on
the walls made the room look warm and
inviting, vast as it was. â¢
First on the programme were formal ex
ercises in. the Council chamber, which is
directly above the ballroom and just the
same size. These were opened '. with an
overture by the orchestra, which was fol

Scudder. Then there was a Song by a
male quartet, address by the President of
the Municipal Council, F. F. Forderer;
another selection by the orchestra; address
by Dr. C. L. Tisdale, y President of the
Board of Education; and then alternate
musical selections and speeches by func
tionaries, and concluding with the formal
transfer of the building to the city through
its proper representatives.
This over the crowd adjourned to the
ballroom, where there was dancing until
1:30 o'clock. The exercises and ball were
free. Every citizen of Alameda was en
titled to attend. Some few formal invita
tions were at first sent out, but it was not
intended that these should be a gauge of

COUNTY OFFICERS TERMS
The Supreme Court Said to- Have
Already Decided the
Matter.
TO BE TESTED IN OAKLAND.
A Decision Containing Definite Lan
guage Against Terms of Four
Years Is Quoted.
Oakland Office San. Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 13. \
. An. influential "coterie of politicians in
Alameda County who are interested in
seeing the four-year term for county offi
cers declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court is already laying its plans.
The lawyers to whom they have intrusted
the- task of paving the â¢â¢ way for . a test of
the new county government act are of the
opinion that the Supreme Court has al*
, ready decided the very point in issue in
favor of two-year terms.
The county government act provides
that in all other counties but those of the
eighth class the terms of the county offi
cers shall be four years. In the excepted
class the terms are lixed at two years.
This is the clause that it is claimed the
Supreme Court has already passed upon.
Among the lawyers who have given the
point- consideration are Genera W. H. L.
Barnes of San Francisco and Major An
derson of Sacramento. Both argue that
the act is invalidated by the exception
above noted. It is understood that the
exception was deliberately made for the
benefit of Fresno County. The exception
was made when Mr. Anderson was a mem
ber of the Assembly, and he warned the /
Judiciary Committee at the time that the
Supreme Court would hold the law to be
invalid.
The case in which the Supreme Court so
claimed is that of Welsh vs. Bramlet. In '
tbe decision, which is found in 98 Cal.,
occurs the following language:
Sec. 4, article XI, of the constitution pro
vides that "the Legislature snail establish a
system of county governments whicn shall be
uniform throughout the State." This means
that the "system" or plan for the government
of the several counties in the State shall be
uniform, so that its several parts shall be
applicable to each county. . The Legislature is
forbidden by the constitution from passing any
local or. special law "regulating county or
township business" (Art IV, sec. 25), or '-pre
scribing the powers and duties of officers in
counties" (Art. IV, sec. 25). Sec. 5 of article
XI directs that "the Legislature, by general
and uniform laws, shall provide for the elec
tion or appointment in the several counties
of such county, township and municipal
officers as public convenience may require,
and shall prescribe their duties and fix
their terms of office." This provision of
the constitution is mandatory, and must
be construed only as giving to the Legis
lature the exclusive authority to provide for
the officers in the several counties, fix their
terms of office '. and prescribe their duties; but
also as declaring that such provisions must be
made "by general aud uniform laws," and that
any law which the Legislature may enact upon
these subjects must be uniformly applicable
to all the counties in the State. .
The county government act of 1891 purports
to be applicable to all the counties of the State.
Its title is "An act to establish a uniform sys
tem of county and township governments. The
first 161 sections of the act are devoted to pro
visions for the various officers of the counties,
authorizing their election, fixing their terms
of office and prescribing their powers and du
ties. Section 162 makes a classification of all
the counties in the State, according to their
population, "for tbe purpose of regulating the
compensation of all officers hereinbefore pro
vided for," making fifty-three classes for the
fifty-three counties into which the State was
divided. .This classification is criticized as be
ing in contravention of the evident purpose of
the constitution, but it was held in Longan vs.
Solano County, (65 Cal., 125; that the consti
tution had conferred upon the Legislature
authority to make the classification, and that
its action therein is not reversible by the judi
ciary. Sections 163-215, both inclusive, pro
vide for the compensation of the different
county officers in the several classes.
In these' sections, in addition to providing
for the compensation of the various officers in
the several classes, are louud other provisions
prescribing duties for county officers in cer
tain classes which are not made for all classes
fixing the terms of county officers in some
classes at four years, while the section which
declares the term of county officers generally
limits it to two establishing special fee
bills for certain classes, fixing the fees of wit
nesses and jurors in other classes, prescribing
rules for the conduct of courts and fixing
penalties for violation of ordinances which are
applicable to only one or more of the several
classes. It is, however, unnecessary here to
consider the particulars in which the uni
formity of the law is destroyed in matters
other than those which refer to the office and
duties of the District Attorney. * * * When
ever it (the Legislature) attempts to enact a
law for one or more of the counties of the State
upon subjects that it is directed to provide for
by general laws, or which are to form part of a
uniform system for the whole State, whether
such counties are designated directly byname
or by reference to a class into which they have
been placed for other subjects of legislation, it
infringes these provisions of the constitution.
We must take judicial knowledge that there
is only one county in the State whose popula
tion places it in the eighth class, and if an act
is passed by.the Legislature that is applicable
to only one county in the State whose popula
tion places It in the eighth class, and if an act
is passed by the Legislature that is applicable
to only one county in the State, it does not
cease to be a local act by reason of the fact
that it purports to be applicable to a class of
counties which trie Legislature Is not author
ized to create for the purpose of such legisla
tion and of which that county constitutes the
only member.
The opinion is signed by De Haven,
Fitzgeraid, Garoutte and Beatty.
This opinion was rendered before the
new county government act was passed,
but it is stated that the language is so
plain that it is surprising that its princi
ples were misunderstood.
. So confident are the politicians that the
act will be repealed that they are now lay
ing wires for the offices that may be voted
for next .November. Nothing can be done
till the proper time for the filing of nom
inations, when, if the County Clerk refuses
to issue the necessary certificate or ad
minister tne proper oath, ; mandamus pro
ceedings will be resorted to.
CAMPAIGN OF THE BONDS.
It Has Changed to a Bitter
Fight of a Personal
Nature. .
Report of the Students' Aid Society.
A Subject ; for Intercollegiate
Debate.
BERKELEY. . Cal., Feb. 13.â Tbe cam
paign for the school and wharf bonds in
Berkeley has suddenly changed from a
quiet and peaceful canvass to a bitter
fight, in which anonymously circulated
personalities cut a large figure. ; J >
: Up to to-day no \ very i vigorous or sys
tematic y opposition y to either ; school or
wharf bonds has been manifested, but this
morning. Berkeleyansvrere startled by the
appearance of 1 10,000 anonymous circulars
containing \ a lengthy argument against ;
any " bonds at all ,and;' making . severe
cbatges against the Town Trustees.
"The circular in Â question ,is . addressed
â¢'To the Voters of >â  Berkeley" and signed
"By Order the Civic Federation." No
"Civic Federation'! is known in Berkeley,
and if such an organization exists it has
been born and matured in secret. ,
The authorship of the mysterious circu
lar is a: subject of; much : speculation.
Rumor has.it that among, the men who
hide themselves under the signature
"Civic Federation" are George Schmidt
and ex-Trustee N. T. Whiting. The former
has frequently made charges of extrava
gance aeainst the present Board of Trus
tees and he is known to be opposed *to the
bonds. :
It is understood that the Good Govern
ment Club, which has appointed a cam
paign committee consisting of J. L. Barker,
J. M. Foy and H. D. Irwin, will prepare
and circulate an answer to the circular of
the "Civic Federation." .
: Students' Aid Society, i
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 13.â brief
history and report showing the work done
by the Students' Aid Society has been pre
pared by Manager. Howell; in response to a
request from tne board of directors. The
report shows that during the first two
years of its existence, up to December, 1893,
the society gave assistance to twenty-four
students. The aid rendered was in the
securing of employment,: by which the
students benefited were enabled to keep
themselves at college. During the third
year the society found employment for
eighteen persons, and the amounts re
ceived by them for the work performed
amounted to over $500.
The society was reorganized with larger
membership in March, 1894, and a man
ager was appointed. Under the new man
agement a large increase has taken place
in the amount of work done by the society.
Thirty -four students were helped by ihe
society during the academic year of 1894-95,
the assistance rendered representing a cash
value of $1561 80.
A still further increase in the usefulness
of the Students' Aid Society as, a source of
aid to needy students is shown by the rec
ords of the present year. During last term
forty-nine positions were filled by the so
ciety, the students aided being twenty
eight young men and six co-eds, and the
cash value of the assistance rendered being
$1156 40.
The report of Manager Howell states
that there are still more . applicants for
help than can be supplied. Mr. Howell
says:
Besides the thirty-four for whom employment
was found, there were eighteen . applicants
fifteen young men and three young women
âfor whom no work could be found. Nearly
all the students who applied for work last
term are still dependent upon their own ef
forts for support, and are willing to do almost
anything within their power that will help
them to make their way through the uni
versity. The work most sought for is natu
rally coaching, tutoring, translating, clerical
work and reading to the blind; but many
students are glad to do housework, milking,
gardening and "chores" of all kinds in return
for board and lodging. Others would take
charge of vacant houses during vacations or at
other times, and not merely in Berkeley, but
in any of the neighboring cities and towns.
Intercollegiate Athletic Committee.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 13.â President
Harry Hirst of the University of California

Professor Ardley's Lecture.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 13.â Professor
H. T. Ardley of the department of decora
tion and industrial art of the State, Uni
versity lectured last night in Stiles Hall
on "Around the World, the lecture being
descriptive of one of the tours around the
world that Professor Ardley has taken in
the study of art and as art correspondent
of the Illustrated London ; News. The
lecture was for the benefit of a fund that is
being raised to provide for a vestured choir
at St. Mark's Church and was very largely
attended. Professor Ardley's lecture was
preceded by a solo by Mrs. Lewis, with
violin and piano obligato by Mr. Drew and
Miss Hill. .
Subject for Debate.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 13.â Tbe foren
sics class at the university has been un
able to decide upon a question for the
coming intercollegiate debate. At the re
cent meeting of tbe intercollegiate execu
tive committee on debating Stanford won
the choice of sides and Berkeley was given
the right of choosing the subject. Owing
to the fact , that a decision could not be
reached as to a subject by the forensics
class the matter was placed in the hands,
of a committee with full power to. act.
The committee consists of Professor Wil
liam Carey Jones, Professor Bernard
Moses, Professor Charles M. Gayley , Pro
fessor Thomas Bacon, M. C. Flaherty and
two other students to be appointed by the
professors.
STOCK OF GEORGE H. ROE
The Electric Light Company Sues
His Estate tor a Large
Sum.
Some Peculiar Methods of Manipula
tion of Shares in an Offshoot
of That Concern.
â â â -
The California Electric Light Company
is suing the California Safe Deposit and
Trust Company and Laura B. Roe, ex
ecutors of the estate of : George H. Roe, for
500 shares;' of stock ; in the Electric Light
and Power â¢ Company and the dividends
upon them since July, 1894.
The suit exposes a rather peculiar trans
action, the principal figure; in which was
George H. Roe, the deceased. The Cali
fornia Electric Light Company of this City
and the Edison General Electric Company
of Philadelphia formed together the Elec
tric Light and Power Company -in 1891.
Charles R. Lloyd was employed to pursue
the negotiations necessary to start the new
company.- Roe was at that time secretary
of the California Electric Light Company
ana also a director. The complaint alleges
that 'he * and Lloyd took charge :. of 'â¢ the
matter together as recognized agent
and Roe in secret. The agreement between
them, the complaint says, was at first
that Roe was to receive a third of the com
mission, but this was changed later on and
Roe was given half. ; [
When the time for paying Lloyd his
commission. came he announced that a
certain J. C. Henderson of New York had
assisted him and that he had agreed to
give him, half the , commission. Lloyd
was given - 786 shares of the stock and
$21,400 ih lieu of the remaining 214 shares.
Henderson, or as the complaint states,
Roe, who was Henderson so .far as , the
transaction went, received 500 ; shares of
the stock and drew large dividends. The
plaintiff ; is .. suing for the return . of . the
stock in possession of Roe's estate and for >
all the dividends collected upon the shares
since July, 1894. ';â  y

Labor Unions Protest Against
the Importation of De
tectives. .
THE SOUTH CAROLINA LAW.
Local Workingmen to Organize and
Enter. Politics for Their
R Protection.
The labor union mass-meeting that is to
be held this evening at 1159 Mission street
is the beginning of a movement of "greater
importance than many understand. Os
tensibly it is for.the purpose of uniting all
labor unions more firmly in one central
body, in order that they may support and
protect each other in matters where gen
eral support is required by the ' laboring
element. Back of all this there is another
movement on foot, which if j carried out as
planned by the leaders will cut a big figure
in the next and all general elections.
. Briefly stated, the labor unions of San
Francisco are going into politics. The
purpose of the mass-meeting is to form a
central body, so that in everything under
taken there will be a concentration of
forces upon the object to be attained.
This movement was started by the
Trades Council several months ago. Years
ago the Federated Trades, and later, the
Trades Council, were powers in the land,
because enrolled under their banners were
all the labor unions in the City. Hard
times and other causes produced a de
pressing effect upon trade unionism, and
while a few went out of existence, others
drifted off by themselves and fought their
battles single-handed. As may be sup
posed, the result was disastrous, for nearly
every stick in the bundle was more or less
broken whenever a pressure was exerted,
thereon. The revival of the trades unions
in the East, and the affiliation of the ma
jority with National and international
bodies, caused a corresponding interest on
this coast, and within the past six. or ten
months the former strength of the local
unions has returned.
With the past as an object lesson the
principal leaders in this City determined
to avoid the rocks on which they struck
in the past, and they determined to ex
pand the strength of the workingmen in
manipulating the affairs of state instead
of wasting it upon strikes and boycotts.
They believe , that by changing the laws
that make labor troubles possible they
will be striking the very root of the evil. â¢
While the meeting is ; called under the
auspices of the' Trades Council, every
union in the City will have a voice in the
proceedings. Each union will "be repre
sented by delegates in proportion to its
membership. .
Since the call for the meeting the sub
ject of politics has entered largely into the
debates of the various unions, and there
seems to be a unanimity of sentiment
upon the matter and a deteimination that
hereafter the laboring man will "do poli
tics" for himself and not for the political
bosses. So far as can be learned there will
.be no party lines followed. The motto
will be men, not party. From the present
appearance of the plan the proposition is
that the laboring element will unite in
favor of the candidates who will stand
firm for bettering the condition of those
who earn their bread by labor. One of
the labor leaders said :
This means that we will throw all our votes
and- influence in favor of those we know to be
our friends. We have too often been deceived
by men we have . assisted to put in office. We
have been laughed at by traitors who were put
into positions of trust by our votes. 1 We may
be deceived once, but woe be to the man who
does it again. Our purpose is to secure our
rights by the ballot. If that is denied to us the
traitors maybe punished in other ways than
by their consciences. We mean business this
time. r .
At the meeting to-night the principal
business will be the reunion of the labor
unions in a central labor body, probably
in the Trades Council, the principles of
which have been tried and found to be sub
stantial. In this central body will proba
bly be vested the power to conduct an ag
gressive political campaign in the interest
of organized labor.
There is another matter of great im
portance that will be considered at the
mass-meeting, and from the attitude of
all the large labor organizations no as
pirant for political honors will be ; sup
ported by the laboring men, unless he
commits himself upon the issue in ques
tion. It is a demand that a law be enacted
prohibiting the entrance into the State of
private detectives or private police, armed
or unarmed, to suppress domestic disturb
ances. This means that the Pinkerton de
tectives ,or other detectives shall be pro
hibited from taking part in any labor
troubles as they did at Homestead and in
numerous States during the recent railroad
strikes.
The labor union people learned from
what they consider to be a reliable source
that William Pinkerton, the well-known
detective, is at present in this City making
a contract with the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company to do its detective work
over the entire system. That detective
agency has already obtained a hold in the
State of Oregon and is doing the railroad's
business on Oregon division.
When the Southern Pacific Company
abolished its detective bureau recently, an
officer of the company stated that it was
done for the purpose of giving the bureau's
business to Pinkerton's agency, which bad
already performed many a special bit of
work for the railroad people. The suc
cessful hunt and capture of train-robbers'
in Oregon, and conviction through the
efforts of Pinkerton's men, placed the
Chicago detectives .in an exceptionally
favorable light before the high officials of
the railroad and, it is said, led to the con
tract which is now being closed, or may
have been- signed. Pinkerton's local rep
resentative has been John Curtin, but it is
now thought highly probable that an inde
pendent agency of the Chicago detectives
ill soon be established in this â  City and
maintained with a special.force of men:
These matters have g been carefully
watched by the labor unions, and one of the
members said: - "Pinkerton and his gang
have been kicked out of several of the East
ern States by legislative enactments,' and we
do not propose to allow him to establish
himself here." Continuing he said: : y
1 South Carolina was the 'â¢, last; to kick these
private detective r gangs over its border, and
hereafter in that State no Pinkerton men need
apply to do the South Carolina corporations*
work. The Review of Reviews of January pub
lishes the following upon the now law in that
State : v "-;
;.' "The : general agitation :of , the labor unions
against tue class of private watchmen Known
as 'Pinkerton men' has conquered public opin
ion in South Carolina so completely as to have
placed the following, section in i the new con
stitution:
':'> "No armed police force or representatives of a de
tective agency shall ever be brought into this State
for the suppression of domestic violence, nor shall
any other armed â , or > unarmed *. body of : men be
1 brought in for that purpose except upon the appli- j
cation of the Oeneral Assembly or of the executive
of this State when the General Assembly is not in
session, as provided in the constitution of the
.United States." . â â ': :
: From what I can learn the labor" unions in",
this City stand solid. on this proposition. - We
will not support a single Legislative candidate
unless he makes a sworn affidavit that J he will
do all in his power to cause the enactment of a
law similar to the one now in force in South
Carolina. 'c-AA';yi.:<{SA[AA.A : -AJA ::v A , iA\.'".^ y.
A\ This matter of shutting out foreign pri
vate detectives will be presented ;to â¢â¢ the
meeting by M. McGlynn, the president (of
the 3- Trades Council. -He will introduce
the following resolution : '
A Whereas, It is stated on good authority that
' the presence in the City of William Pinkerton,
the Chicago detective, is due to an attempt on
his part to secure a footing for his armed force
in this btate; and whereas, we have witnessed
how in every State jin which this pander | and
his ; minions ' have : been .tolerated, . riot ! and
A
bloodshed inevitably followed in their wake;
therefore, be it
a Resolved, That the trades unions of Pan Fran
cisco, in meeting assembled, do hereby pledge
themselves ;to use every honorable . means
within their power to have the following law
enacted at the next session of the California
Legislature:- â â¢;
â ' The law mentioned in McGlynn's reso
lution is the one adopted by. South Caro
lina, which '; appears in the foregoing.
There is no doubt that the resolution
will be heartilly supported and adopted.
As may be expected the American Rail
way Union has taken up' the subject in
earnest. The : delegates to the mass-meet
ing are instructed to do all in their power
to have the resolution adopted.
On Wednesday evening, at the meeting
of the Amalgamated Wood - workers'
Union, formerly the furniture-workers, a
resolution was passed directing its dele
gates to help to their. full ability all move
ment toward the enactment of such a law.
- The District Council of Carpenters and
Joiners, representing 1600 active workers,
took similar action at its last meeting.
A resolution similar to the one to be pre
sented by Mr. McGlynn will be offered at
the next meeting "of the Painters and
Decorators' Union. This is one of the
strongest unions in the City.
With the other unions it is the same,
and unions not already committed upon
this matter propose to put themselves on
record at their next meeting.
â¢ There is another strong organization in
this City that has taken up this matter,
and it will stand with the labor unions in
their fight for an anti-private-detective
law. It is the Socialist Labor party.
When making up its political platform a
clause, based upon the principles of the
South Carolina law was introduced and
indorsed, but the socialists thought that
they ..would not receive enough outside
support to accomplish any great good and
decided to expend their strength upon
other measures that might yield desirable
results more readily. When the Socialist
Labor party leaders learned of the strength
of the movement in the labor organiza
tions they at once declared themselves to
be in favor of putting the prohibitory
plank in their platform again. The social
ists number several thousand members in
this City.
When the delegates to the labor mass
meeting learn of the support that they can
rely upon there is no doubt that McGlynn's
resolution will be passed without opposi
tion. , â  'â¢-.â < -: ;.;â :>
As stated, the labor unions will be in
politics this year and the first wedge to be
driven into the old political combinations
will be the one prohibiting corporations
from hiring private detectives or private
watchmen or police in California."
MRS. WOOD MAY RETURN
No Conspiracy Existed Between
Her and Missing Annie
Parker.
Her Former Employers Recall Her
Expression, "That Will Be
Too Late."
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 13. )
The story that a conspiracy existed be
tween the missing girl, Annie Parker, and
Mrs, J. F. Wood, wife of the man who was
at first supposed to know where Miss
Parker was, had no foundation whatever.
Hinted at a Conspiracy Between His
Wife and Miss Parker to Get a Divorce
From Him.
[From a photograph.]
| Letters and telegrams have been received
from the East, and it is known positively
by the Parker family that Annie is not
there and that she has not been near Mrs.
Wood. . * ' : Â'?'.: -.:; a-aa
Mr. Wood has always denied that there
was a plot hatched between Miss Parker
and his wife for the purpose of facilitating
divorce proceedings that Mrs. Wood might
bring against him. The letters that he
receives from his. wife are absolute proof
that no such conspiracy existed.
It is now considered certain that during
Mrs. John F. Woods, Who Writes That
She Knows Nothing of the Missing
y Annie Parker
[Drawn from an enlarged photograph in her
husband's unique house on Lake Merritt.]
a temporary and sudden aberration of
mind Miss ': Parker carried â  out : her oft
expressed ? wish i that she might die. xAs
she referred* to the bay as a medium to
attain her end it is thought: that the un
happy girl sought surcease from a life that
was not altogether free from trouble. . -
1 Mrs. Parker, mother of the missing
woman, said to-day : that no information
had been received as to the whereabouts of
her- daughter. "Annie ~z. as * not gone "< to
Mis. Wood." she said. "We have communi
cated with friends at the place where Mrs.
Wood is and we have? learned positively
that she has not been joined by Annie.
We did not get our information from Mrs.
Wood, although we have all along felt cer
tain that Annie had not gone East. We
do not know where she is. We have had
every asylum and hospital searched and
have inquired at all railroad ticket offices,
but have learned nothing."
Police Officer Morrison, who has been a
friend of the Parkers for many years, does
not think Annie is dead. He says that she
was not of the nature that suggests sui
cide and he is of the opinion that she has
wandered off while her mind was de
ranged.
J. F. Wood recalled a circumstance to
day, that would seem to show that the dis
appearance of the voune lady was pre
meditated. He said .that on the night of
her disappearance Annie had agreed to
meet him at her store, 1619 .Jefferson
street, at 7:30 in the evening. The ap
pointment had been made .be said, to
enable Annie to tell him about her pro
posed purpose of closing out the business.
He said she attempted to tell him about
tne matter during the afternoon, but that
she spoke in a whisper, so that no one in
the shop could overbear what was spoken.
| "I knew that there were many sus
picious eyes around us," said Wood to
day, "and I was always opposed to
whispered conversations, so I suggested
the night meeting. I told her that after
we had concluded our arrangements she
could go to prayer-meeting. For some
reason or other Annie did not seem to
care for a meeting that night, and I
suggested that we settle up the following
night. To that suggestion Annie said,
â Oh, that will be tod late.' 1 did not know
what she meant, but now that I recall it I
think it was indicative of an intention on
her part to do something that night."
BARRED FROM THE TRAINS
Milk Inspector Dockery Expects
Trouble With the Rail
road.
Two Milkmen Arrested Yesterday
Morning and Fined lnspection â 
Stations.
*
Milk Inspector Dockery is anticipating
a lively time when he comes to invade
Southern Paeilie trains, stations and ware
houses in pursuance of his duty in enforc
ing the new milk ordinance, but he in
tends to enter the places mentioned just
the same.
Copies of the sections of the new order
which give the inspectors authority to ex
amine milK wherever found, and to pro
hibit persons or corporations from inter
fering with them in any way whatever,
were served on the company some time
ago and Inspector Dockery called yester
day at headquarters to ascertain certain
figures regarding the amount of milk that
reached this City each day by the com
pany's trains.
He was politely but firmly informed
that if he expected to enter trains and
storage places at his own sweet will he
was entirely mistaken in his calculations,
and that no such action would be tolerated
under any circumstances.
Mr. Dockery gathered the impression
that the Southern Pacific was angry with
the Board of Health regarding certain
measures which have recently been passed,
and that the refusal to allow the Milk In
spector free access to milk in transit has
something to do with the matter.
The Milk Inspector is not given to using
his vocal organs except when absolutely
necessary, but he told the railroad officials
plainly and promptly that when in the
course of his duty he should'rind it neces
sary to enter any train or station in the
City and County of San Francisco he in
tended to do so, and that the whole force
of the company would not stop him. He
declared his intention of arresting the first
and every man who attempts to interfere
with his free ingress or egress.
The new milk order went into effect yes
terday and bore .fruit before the sun
peeped over " the eastern hills. For some
time Mr. Dockery has kept off- the roads
leading into this City and milkmen have
come and gone without being halted, be
cause the Inspector desired to wait until
the new ordinance became operative.
Yesterday morning he was out in his old
accustomed haunts, and a score of wagons
were stopped and the milk tested. Two
were . found that contained milk below
the standard, and they were promptly
driven to the City Hall, where the drivers,
James Sanders and John Nelson, were
charged with violating the ordinance. Be
fore 11:30 o'clock they were taken before
I Judge Joachimsen, and, pleading guilty,
fined $25 each.
Both asked Mr. Dockery if he intended
to dump the milk, and when he expressed
himself as satisfied with their punishment
they voluntarily turned . the 120 gallons
contained in their wagons into the gutters
of McAllister street.
The inspector expects to make more
I arrests before the order is fully enforced.
Within a few days four inspection sta
tions will be established at the following
points: Clay street wharf. Fourth and
King streets, Army and Alabama streets
and Central avenue and Geary street.
All the milk brought into the City must
be taken to these places for examination.
The board intends to go ahead and appoint
inspectors in spue of the edict 'of the
Finance Committee of the Board of Super
visors that their salaries will not be paid.
People's Home Bank.
The directors of the People's Home Bank yes
terday appointed a committee to prepare state
ments in regard to the Sherman case. The re
port of the committee will be acted upon by
the directors and the result submitted to the
Bank Commissioners.
Death of a Pioneer.
' J. J. McKinnon. a pioneer of 1850, who died
at his residence, 833 Fulton street, on Wednes
day afternoon, left an estate ' valued at $500,
--000. His family consists of a widow and six
children. The funeral will take place at 9:30
o'clock this morning.

GORI DENIES ALL
BAD INTENTIONS.
Says Prince Luigi of Savoy
Is Quite a Harmless
Boy.
WOULD NOT INJURE HIM.
The Anarchist Apologizes for
Those Who Have Thrown
Bombs.
â¢IS BUT SIMPLE RETALIATION."
In a Letter to "The Call" Gori Excor
iates the Governments of
.the World.
The story published in The Call
that Prince Luigi of Savoy had been shad
owed since his arrival in this City by
Pietro Gori, the most noted of Italian
anarchists, created a decided impression
yesterday, both in the colony and among
Americans who have met the pleasant,
unassuming young Prince.
Few of the young man's compatriots
were willing to discuss the matter pub
licly, however, and both the daily Italian
papers kept absolute silence on the sub
ject. On the one hand the Prince has the
good will of his compatriots, both on ac
count of his own agreeable personality and
also because he is a member of the popu
lar House of Savoy. On the other hand,
Gori already has a large following here,
and his eloquence is rapidly making him
more friends and admirers in the Italian
colony.
Speaking guardedly on the subject yes
terday one Italian resident of this City
said : "None of us fear that Gori will
perform any act of violence. He is the
sort of man who influences others with his
words; if he strikes at all he does it second
hand."
Pietro Gori himself, when asked point
blank whether the advent of the Cristoforo
Colombo had anything to do with his '
simultaneous arrival in this City, scorn
fully laughed and said: "I have no ill
will to the Prince. He is a harmless boy,
and the highway in America is wide
enough for us both. My propaganda is !
not made with bombshells."
As always happens when Pietro Gori j
begins to talk in the public room of his inn
at North Beach, a crowd of workmen at
once began to gather round and listened
eagerly to the words of wisdom that fell
from his lips. When asked whether he
had found any anarchists among, his fol
lowers he said, "No, but I am sowing the
seeds that will raise them."
Although he glories in the name of i
anarchist Gori objects to being considered
the preceptor of Santo Ctesario. "I want
tnat statement denied,'' he said, emphati
cally. "It is doing me the wrong that was
done in Europe. In justice to myself I
beg that the letter of contradiction I have
sent may be published."
The following is a translation of the
letter which Pietro Gori sent to The
Call:
San Francisco, February 14.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir: In
the interview published in yesterday's Call i
speaking of the relations between me and j
Santo Csesario the expression is applied to me
that was adopted by the capitalistic European
press, when, during the trial at Lyons, it be- '
came known that Caesario had attended my dis- I
courses at Milan, that he had been defended !
by me when the Government tried him, both
before the Milanese Tribunal and before the
Court of Appeals. lam called "the preceptor
of Carnot's assassin." Why not call me the
sharpener of the homocidal danger?
I defy any one to prove that in my public or
private discourses, in my articles or in my
. books, I have ever advocated bomb throwing or
blows to solve the social problem.
His the example of the varioas Governments,
of the brigand-like education given by them;
It is the shot fired at the people when they are
starving and raise their voices to menace the
orgie of the surfeited; it is all the panoply of
brutal force, from money to guns, placed at the
disposition of a parasite minority, which teach
the people the leseon ot armed violence.
The privations, the griefs, the persecutions,
the bitter derisions, the provocation offered by
the luxury of the rich flaunted in the faces of
the working classes, all the social hell caused
by the present organized iniquityâ are
what exasperate and madden bo many hearts,
which should have been born to love, instead
of learning to murder.
This inferno of modern conditions makes
from time to time vindicators, sometimes le
gitimately so, of the holiest and most sacred
lights of humanity. -
. The dagger thrusts, these throwing of bombs
which blind society and its rulers attribute to
some plot or taction, are only the lightning
flashes of all the concentrated electricity, of
hate and suffering which compose, and that
by our own fault, the present social atmos
phere.
To the eyes of the calm sociologist these
symptoms may appear grand and tragic sym
bols of a social convulsion. The Vailiands, the
Caserios, the Pallas, the Henevsâ their
own statementsâ they were anarchistic-social
ists without doubt.
But what forced them to protest with howls
and knives? Perhaps it was a doctrine like
anarchy, which rests on an instinctive love of
liberty, on a desire for the well-being of all
men? . . . â  ... y -. .-,-.
No ! their theory was love, but they found
only hatred; the ferocity of the mighty over
shadowed their way. They wanted libertyâ
and the only liberty given them was that of
dying of hunger when they protested en
ergetically, and then the European Govern
ments gagged the mouth of the press.
In Sicily and in Lunigiana they shot by

POOLROOMS DISTRESSED
Five Races Decided Before the
"Dens" Learned; of a Single
Winner.
Business Is Falling Off and There Is
; No Sunshine in Glasgow or
, ' Pauper Alleys.
Instead of a "standing room only" sign
a placard will soon be seen displayed in
front of the poolrooms bearing the in
scription "men wanted." The play in the
barn on Glasgow alley was so light yester
day that no gas was needed for illumina
ting purposes, and it is said the proprietors
seriously think of cutting down wages.
From ' bad the service has gone to worse.
The empty-headed spectators who formerly
poured their loose wealth into these dens
have grown wary lest they put their coin
on a horse that has already been num
bered among the also rans, for the returns
from Ingleside art' : slow, very slow in
I reaching the rooms. The scouts with their
i code of signals that were sent to the track
have stood in all sorts of conceivable po
sitions, blown smoke in the air, twirled
canes and scratched tneir heads â and now
the keepers of the illegal joints are scratch
ing.
The fifth race was decided at Ingleside
â yesterday at 4:39 p. m., and until 4:52,
thirteen minutes later, the poolrooms had
not received the result of a single race. At
this time they managed to get the winners
of the second, third and fifth races, still
being in ignorance as to the placed horses
in the first or fourth events.
They had a sorry smattering (of jockeys
and prices on the opening event. They
first announced Seven Up a winner, but
later this was corrected. At 2:40, just
twenty-three minutes after the race had i
been decided, Billy Vice was scratched, but
at 3:50 an announcement was made "that
: they thought he had started."
The odds were posted ; some minntes be
fore the pencilers at Ingleside began book
ing. Wrong riders were posted on six of
the starters in the second event, including
the first three horses past the wire. Ida
Saver and bobolink, both scratched hordes,
had jockeys up and odds opposite their
names. Artist was quoted at twos with
Doggett up, while at the track he was a 10
to 1 chance, and was â¢ ridden by T. Mc-
Hugh, Bobolink was finally scratched
three hours and fifty minutes after his en
try had been made at the track. Two
hours elapsed before the result of the race
was known. . t
The same conglomeration and mixture
of odds and jockeys was - apparent among
the starters in the third race. Repeater.
Moderocio and Cabrillo were not scratched
until 5:10, one hour and forty-six minutes
after the horses had passed" the finishing
post. On the poolroom , boards Cabrillo
was a 3to 1 chance, with Tod Sloan up.
Doyle was held at '- 12, while -; 300 to 1 was
laid against him on the track. Moderocio
was another 3to 1 chance with Cochran
up. Boreas had McHugh up and was Bto
1. Both horses were scratched during the
forenoon.
The "commission "houses" again beat
the Ingleside pencilers in 'posting their
odds up against the starters in the fourth
race, having their '; prices ; up six minutes
in advance of them. They evidently favor
ed George Miller very strongly, for he was
posted an 8 to 5 chance with Cochran up.
Plenty of 5 to 1 could be had against him
at the track, and 3 Coady landed him a
winner. Mainstay was "held at 4, and 40
to 1 was laid at the track. The result of
this race â  was one' hour in reaching the
rooms. , ~ '
The "grafting factories" were " sadly
amiss on the fifth event. : Rebellion, a
scratched horse, was chalked up a 7 to s
favorite with Sloan up, and the dealers did
not scratch him until one hour and five
minutes after the race was decided. Book
ing on :â  this â  race was also begun before
odds were marked up at Ingleside. .
How much longer these iniquitous dens
will be allowed to continue in their nefari
ous calling is the question â¢ being asked by
all law-abiding citizens. As their business
dwindles away and the "sack" diminishes
they will in all probability be raided and
be dead l for all time. Why, they are al
lowed to run no one seems able to guess.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 1896.
EXPLORING THE
RIVER BOTTOMS
Clever Scheme of a Young
Inventor From San
Jose.
PORTABLE DIVING-BELL.
Calculated to Revolutionize River
Mining in the United
States.
ELATED MINING ENGINEERS.
Millions of Dollars Heretofore Hope
lessly Submerged Will Be Brought
to the Surface.
All the high-priced mining engineers
who are with John Hays Hammond in
Johannesburg cut little figure as compared
to the number of members ; of their pro
fession who assembled yesterday morning
in room 52 at 330 Pine street. They were
there neither under compulsion nor for
play, but purely and simply to look into j
the merits of a mining device which, they
claim, must revolutionize river mining
and prove one of the greatest boons with :
which California has ever been blessed.
The thing, for it has no other name,
unless it might be called a second cousin
to a diving bell, was placed in operation :
Miners at Work in the Diving Bell at the
Bottom of the River.
before the critical audience. It is in -the
shape of a tower of scantlings, placed
crosswise for mutual support, leaving a
square hollow in the center, which is
taken up by a contrivance resembling, an
elevator compartment with the bottom
knocked out of it. The elevator shaft, as
it were, up and down which this compart
ment runs, is supported by a float or * raft,
calculated to rest on the surface of any
body of water, such as a river or lake the
bottom of which is to be explored.
As soon as it; is deemed advisable to
work it the float is anchored and the ele
vator shaft allowed to sink to the bottom.
Next the ..'â . inverted ; elevator compartment
is forced down to a: resting place within
seven feet of the bottom, and, by means
of force pumps, all the water below it is
driven out, allowing ample space ior work
men to investigate the soil or perform
any other duty incidental to river mining.
The miners; are provided with a separate
passage from ; above to reach the diving
bell, . and through this . passage and ' an
other on the further side they can send
up all the heavy material they discover.
It makes: absolutely no difference how
long the workmen â  are under - water, .-: as
the pumps above furnish them with pure
air, and the amount of auriferous matter
they gather is carried to the surface by a
suction pump, the nozzle of which is in
the bell. ' â ; -*;;%:â¢ "â¢:â¢â¢. V-^V " .."'.;;:â .-
The whole thing is made of iron, and in
it is an electric light | and a telephone, by
means of which the desires of the miners
are made known to the men on the float
above. . y '\ :â  s ".".'' *-:,â 
The invention is that of J. Madison
Thorp, a Native Son of the Golden West,
who resides in San Jose. y
The mining! engineers who viewed the
work of the model yesterday claim that it
will be the means of doing more for river
mining, in this State than have the mil
lions of dollars already spent. â¢ â â ;:â " \
â As an instance it was .stated that the
English syndicate that spent over $2,500,000
to develop their property on the: Feather
River < could have saved , more 'â  than half
that amount with such a device as Â« the
youngster 1 from J San Jose has presented.
The new device is simply.a' portable shaft
which can be floated any where? on the
river and the shaft sent down to the bot
tom. This being done" the river bed-can
be examined and worked or abandoned ac
cording to the prospects of success. "There
is but i little - expense ' in â  manipulating it,
and the work is rapid.^^gSsy^g|^^<^
Under the present system 'of â Â» river min
ing it is accepted as ; a matter -of fact -that
all t- river beds * in ". countries where I either
quartz or hydraulic mining has been con
ducted: serves as a natural riffle in J which
fine gold washed I away must have -settled.
To get f; this * gold it has heretofore ' been
necessary to build a -costly, dam and. 'turn
the waters of the river into a flume, to be
deposited back ;in the I bed of â  the t river,"
thousands -\ of , feet 'Â« below. - The inter
mediate ? river., bed ~ being left y waterless
it could jbe -worked.'. But - the expense ; of
such an undertaking and the great chances
of it being a valueless â¢" claim have caused
thousands of miles of waterways to-be un
explored. ",'-"'--.' - '* * ' - * \,
!A The 'a present > patent /_>* of â¢J. Madison
Thorp's will permit the miners to move
along *.=; the i river \ "' surface ; v and . - peep
into every crevice. -It is- to river mining
what the diamond drill is to quartz min
ing, a sure test of what is to be found with
out going to any great financial outlay."

SAN FRANCISCO
WATER IS PURE
Chemists Rendered Reports
% to the Board of
Health.
ONE SINGLE EXCEPTION.
The Spring \ Valley Supply Said
to Be ' Generally of Good
Quality.
MADE A RIGID INVESTIGATION.
The Statements Favorable to the
Companyâ Lake Honda May
Be Condemned.
- San Francisco's water supply is, in the
main, as good 'if not better than . that of
any city of large size in the United States.
Such is the consensus of opinion of the
chemists who were recently furnished by
the Board of Health with samples of water
for the purpose of analysis.
Some months ago Mayor Sutro conceived
the : idea that the fluid supplied by the
Spring Valley:. Company was not fit for
drinking purposes, and he demanded that
the board condemn a number of the com
pany's reservoirs, notably Lake Honda
and Laguna de la Merced. , â -_.*â¢;â ***
The board did not believe the water
should be declared unfit for use unless a
careful investigation proved that such was
the case. In order to put the matter to
the most thorough test possible the board,
in company with the Mayor and a number
of noted chemists and bacteriologists, vis
ited Laguna de la Merced, Lake Pilarcitos,
Lake San Andreas, Crystal Spring Lake,
the pumping station at Belmont, where
water is received from the eastern side of
the bay; the reservoirs at College Hill,
University Mound, Russian Hill, and, in
fact, every storage place whence water is
supplied to the San Francisco public.
With the utmost care large bottles were
lowered into the depths and at a certain
distance, where the best average results
could be obtained, the corks were pulled
and the receptacles allowed to fill. . These
bottles were then carefully sealed and as
carefully marked for identification. ~ .
Half a" dozen or more samples were taken
from each reservoir so that a number of
chemists might undertake simultaneously
the work of making analyses. Those se
lected by the board were Professor W. B.
Rising, the State analyst; Professor W.
F. - Wenzel, the analytical chemist; Pro
fessor E. W. Hilgard of the State Univers
ity, and Dr. J. 0. Spencer, the City bac
teriologist. ,
Mayor Sutro also had Thomas Price Jr.
and Dr. Freund given samples to furnish
analyses for his own information. *
In order that all suspicion of collusion
between the chemists might . be avoided,
the samples, were sent to them simply
labeled with numbers, a : record ,of the
matter being carefully preserved [in the
Health Office." Each chemist received a
sample of water from each of the reser
voirs with instructions to give the matter
his most careful attention and report , to
the board at his earliest convenience.
Those reports are now.securely locked
in the new steel safe at the office of the
board in the new City Hall and will prob
ably be opened at a special meeting of
the ; board that taxes place this morning.
Except in the case of one lake the de
ductions of the chemists resulting from
their investigations will probably not be
very satisfactory, to the Mayor, who is cer
tain in his own mind that the water is im
pure. â¢ A very ; large majority of the
samples that were examined chemically
and microscopically for impurities of all
kinds were found to be of very fair quality
and as free J from disease-producing J ma
terials as the water of any city the analy
sis of which is known ; to the local chem
ists.;
Water which was confidently asserted to
be full of microbes and bacilli ; was found
to be of excellent quality, and one medico
stated that he would be satisfied, with the
exception of the contents of one bottle, to
drink such water all his life and feel sure
of escaping serious consequences.
.The reports of the other chemists tallied
with the one mentioned, each finding one
sample that contained matter which made
it much less desirable than the rest. y Â.
' It is believed : that these samples came
from Lake Honda, the little reservoir near
the Almshouse. In case the reports
clearly state , sufficient grounds for a be
lief that the water is not fit for drinking
purposes the' lake will probably be con
demned by the Board of Health and the
company compelled to stop pumping
water from it.
It is ' expected that the corporation will
be represented at the meeting, and that
any attempt; on the part of the board to
condemn reservoirs will be fought to the
last limit. â 
COMPETITION CRITICIZED
Willis Polk's Ideas on the Two
Contests Among Archi- -^
tects.
He Claims That No Architects
of Standing Have Entered.
Regents Discussed. ,
Willis Polk, the architect, and a promi
nent member of the Arts and Crafts Asso
ciation, is of the opinion that the regents
of A the University r of California made a
mistake when, in- looking for designs for
the affiliated colleges,' they : instigated an
architectural competition.
A. "The regents of the University of Cali
fornia are reaping v the whirlwind of the
wind they sowed," said Mr. 4 Polk yester
day. "In preparing the semblance of an
architectural competition as a* method of
procuring designs for the buildings to be
erected â  for the affiliated collegesâ they
sowed. ;. ..** ;.'*.â .'/'-." * . ;â 
y "Out of the 200 or more architects whose
names appear in the city directory, but
five responded to the alluring invitationâ
they, reaped.
y .."Out of these five not a single one occu
pies a position of prominence in his pro
t fession. Among t the ; more reputable ones
there were a few bold enough to point out
the fallacy cf the programme mapped out
by the regents, one at least being intrepid
enough to suggest; the i proper course to be
pursued." y A.-'AA : : -,.-.- - â ---;-...; *Â..-.-,-â ; >
. ."The regents : in their wisdom saw fit to
ignore or evade i these '} well-intentioned
warnings, jiln; the \ extremity/ of their em
barrassment I they have . now called into
consultation three architects to act as pro
fessional advisers. : :. ::";.* -.-.- -.--"
v "This last act should have been the first
one to be taken. It is an inscrutable fact
that, with but three exceptions, none of
the universities of the United States pos
sess buildings of any architectural impor
tance..;-' 'Â»-*â¢"â ! â .;;; - '.
â¢ "In consideration of the failure of this
competition there seems to be but one
course to be pursued by the regents. That
is to declare none of the designs submitted
to be worthy of execution and to prepare,
with the help -of their - professional ad
visers, a code of competition in accordance
with the accepted mode of legitimate ar
chitectural practice. - This course the re
gents declare to be now impossible for
the reason that the appropriation â¢ act of
the .Legislature requires that a certain sum
of money shall .be expended in building
operations by a certain time. This may
be an unfortunate provision of the law,
but it would pale : into insignificance in
comparison with the misiortune of having
another unsightly group of buildings
added to. the list of public edifices to which
no citizen of taste can refer with pride.
â  If regents were to direct a portion
of their zeal to expend so much money in
so much time to an intelligent effort to
procure designs for their buildings that
would by the dignity of composition and
simplicity of design reflect some credit on
their taste in architecture, they Would in a
measure fulfill their duty as officials ex
alted to a public office.
."In the matter of procuring designs for
the new municipal buildings, the same la
mentable programme has prevailed. It is
true that the number of competitors was
trebled, but their professional standard
was at the same low level.
"The increase in number is accounted
for by the fact that four secondary pre
miums, or prizes, were offered, which was
n 2_i the case in the competition for the
affiliated colleges. But the new muni
cipal buildings are in the hands of the Su
pervisors, and no more, or even as much,
was or could be expected.
â¢- "With- the regents it is, however, a dif
ferent matter > and a more outrageous vio
lation of the artistic . welfare of the com
munity, for the regents are gentlemen of
prominence and influential position in the
State and are supposed to possess a su
perior order of good taste and intelligence.
The r regents or the Board of Supervisors
can neither one plead that proper profes
sional advice was not at hand. We have
in the City a society composed of about
one hundred artists whose avowed pur
pose it is to supply just such information
as the regents and tne Supervisors require
under these ; circumstances. It is called
the Guild of Arts and Crafts." V y
IT CURES CONSUMPTION
Patients at the City and County
Hospital Benefited by the
Lymph.
Dr. Hirschfelder's Treatment for the
Dread Disease Meeting With
Much Success.
There is every promise now that San
Francisco will have the distinction of giv
ing to the world a permanent and effective
cure for the most widespread disease that
civilized human flesh is heir to.
And in the promise is the name of Dr.
Joseph 0. Hirschfelder as the discoverer
of the remedy. The "promise itself is con
tained in the condition of the patients
now undergoing the treatment at the City
and County Hospital, and in the case of
one man who has discontinued the treat
ment because he thought himself cured
entirely. -y^y-lyy^
This is William Carr, a man slightly
under 35 years, who came to the hospital
in quite a feeble condition, and after un
dergoing Dr. Hirschfelder's lymph treat
ment, finally left the hospital, if not
cured at least convinced in his own mind
that he was out of danger,
Carr's coughing had stopped entirely
when he left the hospital. He breathed
quite freely and felt so well that he de
clined to take the treatment any longer.
Of course, it is optional with the patients
whether or. not they will submit to the
injections, and Carr did .not follow the
interne's advice when he left the hospital.
It was thought he should have remained
a few weeks longer under Dr. Hirschfelder's
charge, when there was .every prospect he
would have been discharged a3 a well man.
However, Carr considered himself cured
and was in a hurry to get away. He felt
well and Strong "and thought himself
entirely out of danger, which indeed it
may prove that he is. A week ago he
came back to the hospital suffering from
a rectal disorder and he is now undergo
ing treatment for that, but does not appear
to be suffering in any way from or evince
acute symptoms of his old disease.
The four other patients undergoing the
treatment at present show unmistakable
evidences of improvement. In the case of
Card, who <is being ' treated in X ward,
there is quite an apparent improvement.
Although comparatively a young man
Card was a very great sufferer before the
lymph was administered to him. This
was a little over a month ago. and since
then he has gained twenty-seven pounds
in solid flesh, breathes much better and is
able :to be around and when the weather
will permit to spend a good deal of time
out of doors.
; The three other patients, Roberts," Davis
and Mullen, in J ward,, are much better
now than when they came to the hos
pital. Roberts has only taken the treat
ment a short time, but is now up and
around and in many ways shows consid
erable improvement.
Davis was very low when he began to
take the lymph, but he :is now quite ac
tive and goe3 out of doors in good weather.
Mullen's case is probably the worst of the
four.;. He is an elderly man and was very
low. He has only been under the treat
ment a little I while, _ and, though -he is
still quite weak and may never entirely re
cover, i the lymph has evidently been of
much benefit to him.
.. Dr. 'Rom well,, the interne in charge of
ward J, corroborates the statements of the
patients undergoing; the treatment to the
effect that there are no evil consequences
following the injection of the lymph, ,
neither nausea nor fever ensuing after the
treatment. It may be, in view of this
fact, that Dr.- Hirschfelder has made im
provements iin his lymph since the time
that Patient Willey told of its evil effects
upon him ; or, it may be, as was subse
quently averred, that Willey, did not tell
the entire truth in the premise.. At all
events recent developments : seem to es
tablish beyond doubt two thingsâ that Dr.
Hirschfelder's. anti-consumption: lymph
does greatly benefit the patients who have
taken it, and that there are no unpleasant
effects of its administration.

HYDRANTS FOR OCEAN VIEW.
Improvement Club Will Ask for Them
and Other Relief.
; ,; An enthusiastic; meeting of the prop
erty-owners of Ocean View was held last
evening at Hughes' Hall.V
George Thistleton was in the chair.
He spoke of the necessity of the Board
of : Health taking action in - declaring a
nuisance the frog pond i in the center of
that district. Further action on this sub
ject was referred to the committee having
charge of - the , supervisory work of the
club. _;-. y* -
The question of appealing to the Board
of Supervisors to urge the Spring Valley
Water , Company lto : provide .. better main
facilities > for that portion of the City was â 
discussed. ; It was stated that on Plymouth
street, from j Sagamore Ito I Minerva, a dis- '
tance of > five blocks, there were only five
hydrants, and on Sagamore to Capital, one
block, there 'were but two hydrants, mak- j
ing in ail but seven* hydrants for the entire
district. These with the small mains now
use were considered entirely inadequate
in case of fire.'; A .: committee of I three was
appointed to wait on the , Fire and Water
Committees '.. of the J Supervisors and show I
the necessity cf- better protection in v this
direction. â  |
MRS. SHATTUCK IS FREE
She Has Been Acquitted by a
Jury by Reason Â of
Insanity.
THE PRISONER IS - OVERCOME.
A Herculean â¢ Fight Made 'by the
Prisoner's Friends in the
Jury-Room.
Mrs. Jane Shattuck has been acquitted. .
Twice she was tried for the murder of
Harry Poole; once convicted of murder in
the first degree and sentenced to imprison
ment for life. She secured a new trial
from the Supreme Court and now, on the
second trial,* which has just closed, she
has been acquitted. 7
Judge Belcher charged the jury yester
day morning, and at a quarter to 12 o'clock
the jurymen were ushered out of court un
der the charge of the bailiff.
There was no sign from them during the
afternoon, and the crowd which at first
lingered about the courtroom, gazing at
the prisoner and the single friend who sat
with her during the waiting hours, soon
thinned out. There was a lengthy strug
gle going on, and it was not until after 9
o'clock 1 last night that the jury sent for
Judge Belcher and announced that a ver
dict . had â  been reached. Mrs. Shattuck
shifted nervously in her chair during the
calling of the jury, and when the verdict
was given,. "Not guilty, by reason of insan
ity," she uttered a shriek and fell forward
unconscious.
The jurymen in favor of acquittal had
made a herculean struggle. When the
first ballot was taken the vote stood 8 to 4 â¢
for acquittal. Then after over an hour it
changed to 9to 3. Then came more hours *
of hard talking and once more the vote
changed, this time to 11 to 1. The one man
held his ground stoutly, and it was not
until the others agreed to add "by reason
of insanity" to their verdict that he finally
cast his ballot for "not guilty."
It is some years since Harry Poole was
killed. He was the lover, some say th*
intended husband, of Mrs. Shattuck'*
daughter, "Truly," who was then a chorus
girl in the Tivoli. He received a note
from the girl one day asking him to call
on her, saying furtner that her mother
was very sick, and if he wished to see her
alive again he must come at once. He
went to the house, and there he was con
fronted by Mrs. Shattuck, who demanded
that he promise to marry her daughter.
He refused, and the infuriated mother
shot him dead.
After her conviction Mrs. Shattuck was
sentenced to the State prison lor life. She
was sent over to San Quentin, but in the
meantime an appeal to the Supreme Court
for an order demanding a new trial was
vigorously prosecuted. The Judge had
charged that the jury might look with a
certain degree of suspicion upon the testi
mony which the prisoner cave in her own
behalf, and upon that point a new trial
was granted. . She has been tried again
and Mrs. Shattuck is now free. " She was
sent' in a cab to the home of a friend, by
her attorney, Carroll Cook.
REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE.
A Brief . Members Awaiting &
Decision of the, Supreme Court.
A regular monthly meeting of the Re
publican County Committee was held last
evening at Scottish Hall, 111 Larkin street.
The chairman, Charles W. Manwaring}
presided. HKBI â¢
C. C. Morris, from the special committee
on club organization, reported progress.
In regard to the organization of clubs,
Mr. Manwaring suggested that the best
plan to pursue was to await the decision of
the Supreme Court prescribing the man
ner in which delegates to the convention
shall be elected. Until that decision is
submitted there is nothing much to do.
The organization of Republican clubs and
the enrollment of Repuolicans speaks well
for the party, and the good work should
go on. "There is no great hurry in form
ing official clubs, and we might as well
suspend judgment in this respect until we
know under what method we should pro
ceed," said Mr. Manwaring.
.Under the heading of unfinished busi
ness, the secretary, John Jackson, read a
communication from J. A. Whiteside,
chairman of the Republican Executive
Council, announcing that a sub-committee
of that council had been appointed, to
confer with the Republican County Com
mittee.
Mr. Prendergrast moved a reference of
the communication to the Executive Com
mittee, and the motion prevailed. The
committee then adjourned."
Knocked Down by a Car.
Fred Raskey, 5 years of age, who lives with
his parents at Sixth and Howard streets, was
taken to the Receiving Hospital last evening
suffering from a fracture of the right thigh.
He : and three other hoys were taking in the
sights in Chinatown, and he ran across Sac
ramento street at Dupont in front of a car. He
was not quick enough, and the car struck him
and knocked him down.
