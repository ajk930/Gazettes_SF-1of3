WAR OR A BACKDOWN.
Emperor William Must Abandon His Pur
pose or Draw His Sword Against
Great Britain.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. B.â A Sun
cable from London says: Emperor Wil
liam has not yet made known his decis
ion upon the fate of Europe. It must now
be assumed that he has notified the Brit
ish Government of his intention to recog
nize the independence of the Transvaal
Republic.
We do not know what Great Britain's
reply through diplomatic channels has
been. We know that she is preparing for
war with all the resources and energy at
her command. ; *: :
The issue is perfectly clear. If Germany
lands troops at Deiagoa Bay, or sends a
Minister resident to Pretoria, England
will declare war against her.
There can be no doubt upon that point.
Emperor William II must abandon his
purpose or draw his sword. We shall
know very toon which it is to be.
The gravity of the situation is greatly
increased by the fact which yesterday
came to light, that the Emperor's inten
tion to deny the British proteciorate over
the Transvaal antedates Dr. Jameson's
disastrous raid.
The result of the invasion served to post
pone instead of to cause the execution of
the Kaiser's purpose.
This knowledge changes the whole as
pect of the crisis. It suggests that the
Emperor's action may be a deliberate
provocation of war.
It creates the belief in some quarters
that Germany is not alone in seekine the
humiliation of Great Britain. The idea
has gained pos.-ession of the English popu
lar mind that the Kaiser is counting upon
the support of France in attacking this
country.
This impression is not shared by men
Tvho^e opinion is valuable. The more
table belief is that Russia is Ger
many? real suDporter and that the Czar's
Government has long been preparing, by
its alliance with France, to secure the lat
neutrality in a struggle between her
two enemies.
The Kaisers letter to the Czar, dis
patched by special messenger on iast Sun
day, is expected to have an important
effect in deciding the issue of peace or war.
British South Africa, the latest dis
patches affirm, is in a condition of the
preatett excitement and apprehension.
Not a word has heen received regarding
Mr. Rhodes and his plans.
The release of Dr. Jameson by the Boers
must not be regarded as an act of
clemency. His execution would not only
have plunged Cape Colony into a war of
independence, but would have caused an
n of the republic from all sides.
Sir Hercules Robinson, who is an unu
sually able roan, lias displayed great skill
iling with President Krueger. There
is no doubt that negotiation* are progress
ing hiving, of course, the objer.t on Eng
land's side of securing from the Boers a
fresh acknowledgment of the British
suzerainty and a lefusal to accept a Ger
man minister.
It ia difficult to believe that such conces
sions will be granted by the Boers after
the events of the past week, but there is
no doubt that the price offered by Great
Britaii! will be an enormous one.
notbeliered in naval circles that the
â Iron is going to Delatioa Bay,
two British shipfl from nearer sta
tions have already been ordered. It is cer
tain, a naval authority says, that it is the
purpose of the Government, in case a pos
sible enemy gervis ships to any spot where
there are British interests, to quickly dis
patch a much larger fleet to the same
place.
RUSSIA SHOWS HER HAND.
Emperor William Assured of the Co-opera
tion of the Czar in Checking
England.
NEW YORK. N. Â¥Â Jan. 9.â A special
cnble dibputch to the Herald from Berlin
The San Francisco Call.
says: The Emperor yesterday summoned
to Potsdam the Chancellor, Admiral Knorr,
commander-in-crief of the navy, and Ad
miral yon Hollmann, chief of the Ad
miralty, to concert military measures to
be taken in the event of England landing
troops to occupy the Transvaal. -
The Emperor and the Czar of Russia
yesterday exchanged dispatches regarding
the Kaiser's telegram to President Krueger
and the resulting conflict with England,
and Russia's co-operation with Germany
is already assured. France will regulate
her policy by that of Russia.
The Transvaal representatives herejare
attempting to obtain French support.
Count yon Hatzfeldt has received in
structions to intimate to Lord Salisbury
that Germany will not permit the slightest
lesion of the interests of persons of Ger
man nationality.
The Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha deplores
Dr. Jameson's crime, and the Gothaer
Zeitung warmly supports the idea of im
perial intervention by Germany.
PEACE IN THE TRANSVAAL
Secretary Chamberlain Believes the Crisis
in the Boer Republic Has Been
Passed.
LONDON, Exg., Jan. B.âNotwithstand
ing the report that orders were issued to
nrepare a flying squadron of six vessels to
he in readiness for "navigating duties" on
January 14 has been found to be true, and
that Admiral Harry Kawson, commanding
the Cape and West African squadron, has
been oriiered to proceed with his flagship,
the St. George, to Delagoa Bay, and is al
ready en route from Cape Town to that
place. Mr. Chamberlain, the Colonial Sec
retary, is said to consider the Transvaal
crisis past. In political circles, however,
the formation of the flying squadron is re
garded as an indicatian that the situation
is graver than it has hitherto been thought,
and all of the afternoon papers approve of
the preparations for war. Some of them
urge the revocation of the British Booth
Africa Company's charter, after which
England would be able to fight Germany,
on account of the latter's interference,
with clean hands.
According to a dispatch from Cape
Town, dated January 4, it is reported that
the high court of the Transvaal ordered
that Dr. Jameson be shot, but President
Krueger refused to sign the death warrant.
This report is not continued. Another
dispatch asserts that if Dr. Jameson
should be executed the hostile feeling
would become so greatly aroused that
the British Government forces would
not be able to prevent a race war in South
Africa.
Official advices from Pretoria say that
Dr. Jameson will be released and handed
over, to Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor
of Cape Colony, on the frontier of the
Transvaal, and it i 9 also stated that Sir
Hercules, after consulting with the heads
of the Transvaal Government, informed
the people in the Rand that they would
be allowed twenty-four hours from noon
of January 6 to lay down their arms un
conditionally.
Another Pretoria dispatch, dated Jan
uary 6. says the prisoners of Jameson's I
following are loud in their praise of the
treatment they recemu Ât the nands of
the Boers, while the burgjiers deeply re
sent the action of Dr. Jameson. They
are intensely angry at the necessity of
leaving their farms, and demand a speedy
and final settlement of all the questions
at issue and full and free possession of the
Transvaal country, under the disputed
rule of the Boers.
Of the prisoners, the men were confined
in the racecourse inclosure at Pretoria
and the officers in tbe town jail. Dr.
Jameson, Sir John Wilioughby and the
Messrs. White were deeply dejected at the
result of their movement. Jameson refus
ing to take food for some time after his
imprisonment.
The following statement has been issued
by the Colonial Office:
Governor Robinson of Cape Colony
THE KING OF ALL THE CARNIVAL SPORTS AT TRUCKEE, CALIFORNIA â SKATING ON THE ICE BY MOONLIGHT.
[Sketched on the spot by a "Call" staff artist.]
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, JANUARY 9, 1896.
" "STOXJ T3IFLTIT BOY."
! telegraphed to Mr. Chamberlain from Pre
; toria on January 7:
I communicated to Mr. F. K. Newton, Secre
tary of the colony of British Buchuanaland,
your telegram of the sth and received a reply
j from him that he had been absent from
! Buchuanaland for nearly a fortnight prior to
! the raid into the Transvaal. He arrived at
1 Mafeking on December 29 and heard then,
| after the telegraph had been closed, that Jame
son's force was leaving. That night the wires
j were cut and the first message that got through
on December 30 was yours, directing me to
send Dr. Jameson an order to return.
About one-fifth of Jameson's forces started
J from Mafeking and the rest from Pictsani, the
! British South African new territory. Jameson
I left only ten policemen in the whole of the ;
Hur.'huanaland protf etorate und of them four â 
I were doing customs duty. The whole country ;
i was unpoliced. There was no representative !
;of the British South Africa Company lv
Mafcking, and no magistrate in the company's
territory. There was only one representative
' of the company in the lower protectorate and
he had joined Jameson's forces.
Governor Robinson adds: "Newton will
| come to Pretoria at my invitation to con- j
; fer with me in regard to reducing the pro- \
i tectorate."
Governor Robinson telegraphed Mr.
! Chamberlain on January 7: "Johannes-]
burg surrendered unconditionally this :
; afternoon and gave up arms. President I
Kruecer has intimated his intention to
band over Jameson and the other prison- :
j ers upon the frontier of Natal, i'ou may j
be satisfied that the crisis is over and all
danger of further hostilities ended."
The directors of the British South
Africa Company have held repeated meet
ings during the last week, and since Mon
day have, met twice daily, but have made
no statement to the press. It is under
stood that Mr. Chamberlain has ordered
the directors to obtain from Cccii Rhodes
a detailed statement of his Knowledge of
Dr. Jameson's movements prior to the
latter's raid into the Transvaal, otherwise
the charter of the British South Africa
Company would be revoked. The anxiety
of the direct' frs increases as the days go by
without bringing any statement from
Rhodes, whose only reference to Jameson
was made in a dispatch received here on
January 1, in which he said that Jame
son had acted without authority.
TAUNTING THE GERMANS.
The London Press Ascribes Jhe'fr Silence to
Fear of Great Britain's
Power.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. B.â The editorials
of the leading papers to-morrow will be
unanimous in lauding the generosity of
President Krueger and assuring him that
everything is appreciated at its full
value. All of the papers will praise
Colonial Secretary Chamberlain for his
course throughout the difficulty.
The Daily Chronicle will congratulate
him upon having secured peace with
honor. Sir Hercules Robinson will re
ceive his share of praise.
The Daily News and Daily Chronicle
lead in an emphatic demand for a thor
ough sifting of the British South Africa
Company's liability for the trouble, and
admonish the Government not to shirk its
obligations to the Transvaal and to Eng
land to convict the real authors of the ap
j parent gross conspiracy against the South
African republic.
The lectures to Emperor William are
generally repeated. The marked cessation
of hostilities of the pres3 of Germany
toward England is ascribed to the British
Government's preparations for war, which
are highly commended on all side 3.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â The fol
lowing cablegram from General Martinez
was received at the Spanish legation late
this afternoon:
"The column oi General Navarro yester
day had an engagement lasting three
hours with the main bands of Maceo and
Gomez in Ceiba del Aqua, dispersing them.
Twenty dead have been found and buried
by our soldiers. The Spanish loss was
slight â four officers wounded and twenty
casualties among the men, eitner killed
or badly wounded.
"The troops captured numbers of horses,
arms and ammunition. The column is
reconnoitering the scene and many col- 1
timns are following the insurgents. The
army is in hi^h spirits and Havana is
completely quiet."
Minister Dupuy de Lome also received a
long cablegram from the Government at
Madrid to-day, giving a summary of the
latest official reports received there from
the commander-in-chief in Cuba. These
reports show that it diffi
cult to get a fight with the bands of ma
rauders which are continually galloping
about, burning and pillaging the defense
less plantations and small villages. Gen
eral Echagua, who is in the rear of the in
surgents, has twice succeeded in overtaking
a few of the bands and capturing some
prisoners.
General Campos says the rebels never
stop long enough to be overtaken in any
considerable numbers.
In the invasion of Pinar del Rio, by the
insurgents, small bands of bandits pre- :
cede the main forces of the insurgents,
and cause more damage than Maceo and
Gomez.
Yesterday 1000 men were sent by sea to
Colonia, the port ot Pinar del Rio, to re
enforce the troops there. In the rest of
the entire island of Cuba rotbing of a
revolutionary character is occurring.
Minister Dupuy de Lome expresses his
full confidence that the*-e dispatches give
an exactly truthful statement of affairs,
and he courts the comparison of these dis
patches with news from otner sources
which secure publicity from day to day in
several newspapers which have been proven,
so unreliable recently.

MOUNT PLEASANT, Vi..\., Jan. 8.-
For love of a woman Henry P>. Thomas {
and Albert Stafford fought a duel to the*;
death near here Tuesday afternoon.
Thomas and Stafford up to six months
â¢go were friends. About that time, how
ever, both began to pay attention to the j
young woman, and jealousy soon j
made them deadly enemies.
two months they have gene about!
heavily armed and it was known that ;
when they met a deadly light would fol- '
low.
Thomas and two friends went hunting .
Tuesday, not knowing that Stafford and
three friends had gone on a similar ex- j
cursiuii.
During the afternoon the hunting par- 1
ties met, and it s-eemed that a general right !
would ensue. Thomas, however, ureed
c and Stafford were concerned,
and begged, that they be allowed to light it
out, and tLis was agreed to.
Thomas and Stafford, armed with pis
tols, fac< d each other at thirty yards and '
began firing. Neither was injured by the i
tirst exchange and tbey advanced on each
Other. At the second shot Thomas fell
with a bullet in the bowels.
Stafford still advanced on the prostrate
man, firing, when Thomas staggered to ;
1 his feet and, steadying himself by a small j
tree, took deliberate aim and sent a bullet |
through his foe's heart. Thomas died two
hours later.
In taking the corpses of the young men
home they were borne past the residence i
of the girl for whom they fought. She
showed no emotion, and it has been
learned that she has all along been en
gaged to a man in Georgia.

The Important Question of Torpedo-
Boats to Be Discussed in All
Its Details.
WASHINGTON, D. 0., Jan. 8.-A meet
ing of the Senate Committee on Coast De
fenses was held this morning. General
Craighill, chief of engineers and hia as
sistant, Captain Black of the Engineer
Corps, made important statements.
General Craighill explained to the com
mittee the great need of immediate aildi
| tional appropriations for coast defenses
and stated the amount which could be
economically and profitably expended by
the Buieau of Engineers for that purpose
during the current fiscal year, and the
iarger additional amount for each year
thereafter until the completion of the
project of the Government.
The defenseless condition of the sea
i coast was explained, showing that the
amount proposed in Senator Squire's bill
for coast defenses is not only none too
large but absolutely required. General
Craighill explained that if the bill shall be
passed immediately, the sum of $4,500,000
'â¢ couid be economically expended by the
Bureau of Engineers alone during the pres
ent fiscal year.
The committee then proceeded to in
vestigate the question of torpedoes. The
importance of this matter is such that the
committee will continue its sessions daily
during the present week and next week,
hoping to be able to report a bill at an
' early date.

regular navy, this being the lowest esti
mate of the number needed for the new
ships that have been placed in commis
sion.
The bill aiso gives the Secretary author
ity in any emergency that may arise to en
list the services of the National militia of
the. several States for manning the auxil
iary cruisers, and if this should not .be
sufficient to enlist as many more as may
be sufficient for the purpose.
The bill carries an appropriation of
$308,000 for 1000 men added to the regular
navy.
SAN FRANCISCO'S GUNS
Three Pneumatic Dynamiters
Accepted by the War
Department.
Washington Officials Pleased With the
Excellent Showing Made in
the Tests.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 8.-A Sun
SDecial from Washington says: The
fortifications of San Francisco have been
strengthened in the last week through
the acceptance by the Government of
three of the most powerful pneumatic
guns yet tested, each of which threw 500
pounds of high explosive upward of 500
yanls with precision and terrific effect
upon the water where it struck. Columns
of water were thrown as high into the air
as the Washington monument, and the
aim was so true that there would have
been no difficulty in hitting any ship
which they mieht have been aimed at,
With 500 pounds of gelatine a range of
2100 yards was secured ; explosions oc
curred both on impact with the water and
with a lixed fuse two seconds after the
shot struck, the water in each instance
being tobsed like a geyser spout over 600
feet into the air. With projectiles of the
same explosive and a charge reduced to
100 pounds the guns propelled shells
three miles and it so near the mark aimed
at that a battle-ship would have been easily
blown to pieces had she been the target.
These three guns are similar to those
which are now mounted at Sandy Hook,
but the tests demonstrated that improve
ments have been made which place the
new weapons in advance of those at New
York, boih in accuracy and power of
range. Other euns will be placed at Bos
ton and the important coastwise cities in
cluded in the fortifications plan of the
War Department.
The success attending the trials at San
Francisco has settled to the satisfaction of
ordance experts the value of this type of
weapon as a part of the ordnance for the
country's land defenses, and hereafter
some of these guns will be stationed at
the important cities along the seaboard,
where the department proposes construct
ing defenses invulnerable to attack from
the sea.
Eminent ordnance experts of the army,
including General Flakier, have con
tended that the pneumatic gun will be of
great value in dealing with a large fleet,
and that ships would not dare approach
within its range, knowing that an explo
sion of 500 pounds of gelatine in the vi
cinity of a vessel would have a most dis
astrous result upon those on board. It is
as>ertcd further that one shot from a
dynamite gun would be worth more than
a broadside from a warship, and that the
country can well risk making a true shot
occasionally with results as effective as
those following the impact of a projectile
from a battle-ship.

HERBERT IS ACTIVE.
Urgent Jtiqu 'tries us to the Progress in
fcquijtphiy the Monitors.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan.. 8.-Before
Secretary Herbert left this morning for
New York he set on foot inquiries as to
how quickly the coast-defense monitors
Miantonomoh, Terror and Monadnock
could be prepared for service. Statements
burnished by the bureaus concerned show
that the Miantonomoh, recently placed out
of commission at League Island, could be
recom missioned within two weeks; that
the Monadnock could b" finished by the
Ist of February, and that the completion
of the Terror within sixty days was as
sured. The Monadnock is at Mare Island,
Cal., and the Terror at Brooklyn, N. Y.
The reason for the request made by the
Secretary cannot be ascertained.
Revenue Cutters for This Coast.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8.-Cullom
to-day introduced a bill providing for the
construction and equipment of two steam
revenue cutters of the first class for service
on the Pacific Coast, the cost not to ex
ceed $100,000.
SHORT SESSION IS THE HOUSE.
Jackson Hay Observed by Members of the
Lower Chatnber.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8.-The
House celebrated the anniversary of the
battle of New Orleans, known as Jackson
day, by remaining in session but forty
minutes. Half of that time was occupied
in the reading of the journal.
In the remaining twenty minutes rou
tine matters were considered, and a joint
resolution offered by Spaulding (R.) of
Michigan was read and referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs looking to
the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands.
ARMOR FOR BATTLESHIPS
Unsatisfactory Test of Plates
for the Brooklyn and
lowa.
Shattered at a Single Shot by a
Thousand - Pound Wheeler
Projectile.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. S.-A plate,
representing 415 tons of eight-inch turret
and barbette armor of the battle-ship lowa
and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, was
tested at the Indian Head proving grounds
with results very unsatisfactory to the
manufacturers, the Carnegie Steel Com
pany. Two big ports were cut in the plate
to make it represent as nearly as possible
a port plate of the eight-inch turrets on
theae vessels.
One shot only was necessary to deter
mine that the plate was not up to t^e
standard. A 6-inch armor-piercing prfc
jectile of the Wheeler type, weighing 100b
pounds, was fired at the big steel tareet
with a velocity of 1700 feet a second. The
contract for the group which this plate
represented required tbat the shell should
do no greater damage than to merely
crack it, but after the shot was fired an
examination disclosed that the target had
been broken into three pieces. There was
nothing further to be done, and Captain
Sampson, chief of the Naval Bureau of
Ordnance, and the other officers who
witnessed the test returned to Wash
ington.
The result of the test will cause the
holding-up of this group of armor and its
temporary rejection, but a second test will
be had, which is likely to prove more suc
cessful for the Carnegie Company. The
plate which fared so badly to-day was of
inferior quality, and it is said that it did
not fairly represent the other plates in the
group. It was selected for the test be
cause of its inferiority, in accordance with
the policy of the Ordnance Bureau to
choose for this purpose the specimen
which is believed to be the weakest in a
group, the idea being that if the poorest
plate can stand the severe test prescribed
by the bureau, others must necessarily be
able to withstand a greater striking force.
STATEHOOD FOR OKLAHOMA.
Citizens of the Territory Meet to Frame a
Petition to Congrenti.
DENISON, Tex., Jan. B.â The statehood
convention convened at Oklahoma City,
O. T., to-day. It seems now as if the
Democrats have captured the convention,
and will pass resolutions favoring single
statehood only. There will be nearly 500
delegates present. A hot fight between
the single ana double statehood men is
anticipated.
A draft of the memorial to Congress,
and which will be submitted to the conven
tion, contains, among others, the following
arguments:
"We have a population of nearly
300,000 people. We have wealth suf
ficient to meet the necessary expenstj
of & State government. We are an in
telligent, industrious, progressive, patri
otic people. We have better homes, a bet
ter system of public schools and in many
other respects are far in advance of many
of the States that were admitted into the
Union more than a score of years ago. We
have reduced the fertile acres of Oklahoma
from the state of nature to a high state of
cultivation. We have laid out and con
structed highways. We have builded
cities and towns, schoolhouses and
churches. That we have accomplished all
this in spite of the wrongdoings and num
berless privations which, because of un
friendly legislation we have been forced to
undergo, proves Deyond question our ca
pacity for self-government."
FAMED FOH HIS FLUCK.
Death of Charles C. Bassett, the Xoted
Sporting Mam.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. B.â Charles
C. Bassett, known to the sporting frater
nity all over the country as a prominent
figure in the frontier days of Kansas, is
dead. News of his death at Hot Springs
Sunday was received here yesterday.
The life history of Charlie Bassett, or
"Senator," is closely entwined with that of
"Bat" Mastersonand Luke Short. Bassett
was born in New Bedford about forty-nine
years ago. He came West after the war,
and after drifting about the mining camps
and frontier towns for a time took up his
abode in Dodge City, Kans. The town was
overrun with a lawless element. Finally
"Bat" Masterson was made Marshal. He
chose Bassett as his right-hand man and
chief deputy.
Masterson and Bassett soon established
a record as fearless and desperate officials.
Several of the desperadoes were killed and
the remainder driven from the town. After
ward, in recognition of his services, Bassett
was made Sheriff of the county.

JONES BARS THE WAY
Prospects of a Deadlock in
the Senate Finance
Committee.
TARIFF ON RAW SUGAR.
If It Is Not Imposed the Revised
Schedule May Not Be
Reported.
MR. TELLER THROWS A BOMB.
Declares in the Republican Caucus
for a Free-Coinage Amendment
to the Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8.â I! the
Republican members of the Senate Com
mittee on Finance act in accordance with
the vote of the Republican caucus this
afternoon, and if Jones persists in his
intention to demand that raw sugar shall
be given the 15 per cent of an increase pro
vided by the House in every other sched
ule, there will probably be a deadlock in
the committee and the bill cannot be re
ported. There is a general belief, however,
that Jones will relent and act with the
Republicans.
The resolution introduced yesterday by
Q uay, declaring it to be the sense of the
caucus that the Republicans should report
the tariff bill from the committee as it
came from the House, passed the caucus
this afternoon after an hour and a half of
i debate, without division and by a practi
cally unanimous vole. The chief point in
the discussion was the probable attitude
of the silver Republicans.
Many of these were outspoken in their
desire to have the tariff bill pass and de
clared that it would be unwise to place a
free-coinage rider thereon, especially in
view of the fact that such a bill was now
before the Senate and would be passed be
fore action was had on the tariff bill.
Teller of Colorado threw a bomb among
his associates when he made a vigorous
speech and said that for one he proposed
to assist in placing a free-coinage amend
ment on every tariff bill until such a
measure became a law. He would not
only vote to put one in this bill, but he
declared it to be his intention to en
deavor to assist in having such an amend
ment placed on a tariff bill in the next
Congress if the Republicans controlled
both branches of the Legislature and the
executive.
The statement embarrassed the Repub
licans greatly. Teller diii not only say
that he would offer such an amend
ment, but stated positively if, offered he
would vote for it. Other fdver men ex
pressed the intention of being satisfied
with the free-coinage substitute to '", the
bond bi11.,.. \^l-\ â¢ â¢ : y.
Conservative men will not join him. in
this vote, and the votes .of the sound
money, men. on the other side of the cham
ber are counted upon to defeat such a
proDosition. . t' '
Just as the caucus was about to adjourn
Pettigrew asked when the Republicans pro
posed to consider the question of the
reorganization of the elective offices of
the Senate, and suggested this would be
as good a time as any. Nevertheless,
Mitchell made a motion to adjourn and it
was carried. This left the silver and the
new Senators in the lurch. They are the
ones who have been urging reorganization,
and they were somewhat angered to think
that the adjournment had been carried on
the motion of their own men.
Immediately a request was circulated
for Sherman, chairman of the caucus, to
issue a call for another caucus, and it was
generally signed, the names attached to
it including Eastern men as well as West
ern and silver men. This caucus will be
called probably to-morrow and will deal
with the subject of the further reorganiza
tion of the Senate.
CAN TALK IT TO DEATH.
Senator White's Scheme to Beat
the Funding Bill in the
Senate.
The Californian Not Without Hope
of the Success of the Oppo
sition.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8. â The
Committee on Pacific Railroads will not
begin to give its brief bearings on various
bill 3 for the settlement of the Pacific raii
road debts until February. Meantime the
committee will study up on the subject.
Many of the members btc new and want
to become posted before the hearing. It is
understood that ex-Representative Geary
will be here, among other Cahfornians.
Senator White said to-day that there
was some hope of beating the funding bill
in the Senate. He did not cay what the
tactics of its opponents would be, but
said, "I will fight it tooth and nail." It
is believed that White proposes' to filibus
ter against it. During the last session he
said : "If that bill conies up in the Senate
we can talk it to death."
COJjVSA HAS A &BIEVAKCE.
Charge* Preferred Against a Recently
Appointed JPostmaster.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â On De
cember 16 C. S. Callan was appointed Post
master at Williams, Colusa County, Cal.
The citizens of that town and vicinity
have now preferred charges against him
and want him removed. They are writing
letters charging Callan with inebriety and
immorality. One letter received by Rep
resentative Hilborn charges him with being
grossly immoral.
Senator White and Representative Hil
born have received telegrams asking that
an Inspector of the Postoffice department
Oe sent there. It has not yet been decided
to comply with this lequest, although an
investigation of some kind will possiDly be
held.
SEJXATE FIiOCEEMXGS,
An Effort to Agree Upon Action on the
Tariff Milt.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â The ses
sion of the Senate to-day occupied less than
an hour, the rest of the afternoon being
given to the Senators to agree upon a line
of action on the House .tariff bill. When
Sherman made the motion to adjourn he
gave a hint as to the purpose he had in
view in making it, and assured the Senate
that an early adjournment would expe
dite business. And so the motion was
agreed to without dissent from any Sena
tor except Stewart (Pop.) of Nevada, who
desired the Senate to continue in session
an hour longer in order that he ufifcbt
make a speech in favor of the free coinage
of silver.
The only incidents of note during the
fifty minutes of session were these: The
swearing in of Senator Wolcott (R.) of
Colorado for nis new term; the reporting
of an important bill ironi the Committee
on Naval Affairs for the enlistment of ad
ditional men for the navy, and the notice
by Butler (Pop.) of North Carolina of an
amendment to the House bond bill, with
the free coinage substitute. The amend
ments propose to prohibit any issue of
United States bonds without the authority
of Congress and to require the payment of
greenbacks, treasury nctes and" the in
terest and principal of bonds in either
gold or silver, but 'in the cheaper of either
metais.
The adjournment was until to-morrow.

CO3IPETITIOX DESIRED.
Secretaru Herbert Anmrvrs an Inquiry
a* to li>>ihiin<j y~ew liattle-Ships.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â ln re
sponse to the Quay resolution requiring
information as to whether the Navy De
partment deemed it advisable to build six
battle-ships instead of the two authorized
by the last Congress, on the basis of the
bids submitted for these two, Secretary
Herbert sent to the Senate to-day a long
letter on the subject.
After informing the Senate that con
tracts for both the battleships author
ized have already been awarded to
the Newport News Ship-building and
Drydock Company, the Secretary says
the Department does not deem it advisable
to recommend that any bids received and
not accepted should be further considered,
becau-e it sees no reason why, if other
ships are now authorized, the building of
them shall not also be open to competi
tion. IF an advertisement for new bids for
battle-ships were issued, be says, ten days
from the date thereof for receiving and
opening the bids would give ample time
and opportunity for competition. Under
such an advertisement the department
would also, as iii like cases heretofore, call
for bids upon the plans of the bidders, and
any p'any heretofore prepared by bidders
might be submitted upon the new bids.
INTERESTS THE COAST.
Senator Perkins' Efforts in Be
half of California' Sugar
Producers.
Many Candidates for the Sacramento
Postmastershipâ Bills Affect
ing Seamen.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8.-Se!!3tor
Perkins made a strong effort in the Re
publican Senatorial conference this after
noon to secure a higher tariff on suaar, as
he wished to encourage the beet sugar
planters of California. He explained the
beet sugar industry and its capacity for
development. Senator Thuiston, whose
State (Nebraska) is also greatly interested
in beet sugar, earnestly supported Senator
Perkins, and other Senators indicated
their willingness to afford the protection
asked, but the majority of the Senators
present finally concluded that no amend
ments to thisemenrency bill should be el
lowed, as the}' misrht endanger its passage.
It was thought, however, that many if not
a majority of the Senators werÂ« in full
sympathy with the proposition to .protect
sugar by horizontal increase or specific
duty. Senator Perkins believes that where
the Republicans can secure control of the
Senate protection will be granted by
bounty or increase of duty.
By the direction of the Secretary of War
the board of officers is appointed to meet
at the call of the president thereof at San
Francisco for examination of such officers
of the corps of engineers as may be ordered
before it to determine their fitness for pro
motion.
The detail is: Colonel Charie3 R. Suter,
corps of engineers, Lieutenant-Colonel
Charles R. Greenleaf, deputy snrgeon-gen
eral; Major Charles E. L. B. Davis, corps
of engineers; Captain Walter L. Fisk, corps
of engineers, and First Lieutenant Georee
M. Wells, assistant surgeon. The junior
engineer officer will act as recorder. First
Lieutenant Harry Taylor, corps of engi
neers, will report in person to Colonel
Suter for examination.
Senator White is receiving letters by the
score from friends of various candidates
for the Sacramento postolh'ce, vice Leake,
resigned. He immediately sends them to
the Postoffice Department, and these
Sacramentans could save him considerable
trouble by sending indorsements and
petitions direct to the department, for
White says that before he makes any
recommendations he will examine all the
papers on lile there. Mr. Leake has
written that be will perform the duties of
the office until about March 1, so White
will not make any recommendations until
the last days of February. It is altogether
likely that Stephens will be appointed; in
fact, it is all but assured that he will win.
It is not believed that Congress will
make an appropriation for an outer harbor
at either Santa Monica or San Pedro, as
there is a controversy over these rival
sites, and Congress will be loth to appro
priate $4,000,000 for this purpose. Senator
White believes an appropriation of $390,000
may be secured tor an inner harbor, over
which there is no dispute.
Senator Frye, chairman of the Com
merce Committee, to-day introduced a bill
to amend the Revised Statues by provid
ing that the name of every documented
vessel of the United States shall be
marked upon each boat, and upon the
stern the home port shall also be marked.
These names shall be painted or gilded,
or consist of cut or carved or cast Roman
letters in light color on dark ground, or in
dark color on light ground, plain and dis
tinctly visible. The small letters used
shall not be less than four inches in size.
If any such vessel shall be found with
out these names being so marked the
owners shall be liable to a penalty of $10
for each name omitted. The draft of every
registered vessel shall be marked upon
stem and stern in English feet or deci
meters, either Arabic or Roman numerals.
The bottom of each numeral shall indicate
the draft to that line.
Frye introduced another bill which will
be read with interest py Pacitic Coast (sea
men. It amends Revised Statute, section
4536, so as to read :
No wages due or accruing to any seaman or
apprentice shall be subject to attachment or
arrestment from any court, and every payment
of wages to seamen or apprentices shall be
valid in law, notwithstanding any previous
rate or assignment of wages, or any attach
ment, incunibrance or arrestment thereon;
and assignment or sale of wajre or
salvage niado prior to the accruing thereof
shall bind party making same, except such ad
vance securities as are authorized by this title ;
and provisions of this section shall extend to
and embrace seamen and apprentices in do
mestic or coast trÃde and trade between the
United States and ports in the Dominion of
Canada and Newfoundland and West India
Islands and Mexico, and to eeamen in whale or
other fishing business.
It is hereby f urtber enacted that any writ of
attachment or other paper for enforced collec
tion of seamen's wages in contravention of
this section shall be void, and any officer exe
cuting the same shall be punighe'd, upon con

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â The fol
lowing joint resolution relating to the
Hawaiian Islands, offered by Representa
tive Bpaolding (R.) of Michigan, was read
in the House to-day and referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs:
That Congress doth consent that the terri
tory properly inclutu-d with it aud rightfully
belonging to the Government of Hawaii, and
commonly known as the Sandwich Islands,
may be erected into a new State, to be called
the State of Hawaii, with a republican form of
government to be adopted by the people of
said Government of Hawaii by deputies in
convention assembled, with the consent of the
existing Government, in order that the same
may be admitted as one of the States of this
Union.
Further, that the foregoing consent of Con
gress is given upon the following conditions
and with the following guarantees, to wit:
1. Said State to be formed subject to the ad
justment by this Government of all questions
of boundary or jurisdiction that may urise
with other governments or former govern
ments of Hawaii; nnd the constitution thereof,
with the proper evidence of its adoption ly
the people of the Government of Hawaii, shall
be transmitted to the President of the United
States, to be laid before Congress for its final
action on or before January 1, 1898.
2. Said State, when admitted into the Union,
after ceding to the United States till public
property and means belonging to the Govern
ment of Hawaii, shall retain all public funds
of every kind which may belonp to or be due
said Governments, and also all vacant end un
populuted lands lying within its limits, to be
applied to the payments of the dcots and lia
bilities of said Government of Hawaii, the
residue of said lands to be disposed of as said
State may direct; but in no case are said debts
and liabilities to become a charge upon the
United States.
Further, that if the President of the United
States shall in his judgment deem it most ad
visable instead of proceeding to submit the
foregoing resolution to the Government of
Hawaii as an overture on the pert of the
United States for admission, to negotiate with
that Government, then, resolved, that a State
to be formed out of the present Government of
Hawaii witn one representative in Congress
shall be admitted into the I'nion by virtue of
this act as soon as the terras and conditions of
such admission shall be agreed upon by the
Governments of Hawaii and the United States,
and that $100,000 be appropriated to defray
the exre ses of missions and negotiations
either by treaty or articles as the President
may decide.
SUPREME COURT CASES.
Two Actions in Which the Gov
ernment Figures as Ap
pellant.
Santa Fe's Suit to Gain Possession of
a Public Plaza Argued and
Submitted.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 8.-Litiga
tion to which the United States is a. party
occupied the attention of the Supreme
Court to-day exclusively.
The first" case under argument was
that of the city of Santa *c, N. Mex.,
asainst the United States, appealed by the
latter from the Court of Private Claims.
The city of Santa Fe brought suit before
that tribunal to have confirmed to it a
tract of land of four square leagues, the
center of which was the public plaza. The
claim of the city was founded upon both
direct &rant from the Spanish Government
and the operation of law, the papers of
the grant having been destroyed in the In
dian insurrection in IGBO.
About 1500 heads of families are living
upon the land claimed by the city and
hold title under the grant to the munici
pality. A number of private parties were
made defendants to the suit of the city,
who, it is alleged, claimed lands in the
limit of the grant, and answers were put
in by them settling up their claims. The
court held adversely to them, and they
have taken no appeal in this case. The
brief for the city 01 Santa Fe says:
"The case is here on the appeal of the
United States alone, which insists upon
the court taking notice of the evidence and
claims of the other defendants who have
not appealed, based on alleged Spanish
and Mexican grants, thus not presuming
any grant in Santa Fe."
Argument in the case was made by the
Assistant Attorney-General J. M. Dickin
son and Matt Reynolds, special assistant
to the Attorney-General for the United
States, and T. B. Catron. who formerly was
Delegate to Congress from New Mexico for
the city of Santa Fe.
That" argument having been concluded
the somewhat famous case of the United
States vs. a certain tract of land in Cum
berland, Adams County, Pa., involving
the effort of the War Department officials
acting under an act of Congress to secure
possession by condemnation for use as a
part of the Gettysburg National Park of
certain portions of the battlefield over
which runs the tracks of the Gettysburg
Electric Railway Company. Two tracts
were sought to be obtained, of 7.02 acres
for which the jury assessed the damages
of the railway company at $30,000, aÂ°nd
the other of 3.12 ocres. The petition to
condemn this the lower court ordered to
be quashed, and from the judgments in

TROUBLE IX STORE.
The Armenian Question Promises to \
Cause Much Annoyance.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â The Sen- I
ate Committee on Foreign Relations held \
its first meeting this morning since the ,
reorganization of the Senate. Chief among
the matters referred to this committee
were affairs relating to Cuba. Venezuela
and Armenia. The members of the com
mittee say that the latter one will cause
this Government no end of trouble. Papers
before the committee indicate that half
has not been told. How to effectually in
terfere without violating the National
policy of evading entangling alliances
with foreign powers is a problem of diplo
macy that the State Department alone can
solve. .
The recognition of the belligerent right
of Cuba is also pressing upon the com
mittee. This will be the first thing taken

Ten Kee Sing and Uia Medals Seen in a
Police Court.
NEW YORC, N. V., Jan. B.â Ten Kee
Sing, a Chinese who served in the United
States navy and who has been decorated
by Congress for bravery, v. as a prisoner
yesterday in the Court of General Sessions.
He was arrested on complaint of Chin Sing,
a gambler, who charges that Ten Kee Sing
and five other Shinanien entered his place
last October and knocking him down
robbed him of $7 25.
Ten Kee Sing denied the charge and was
held in $1000 bail to await trial. He claimed
thai he was the victim of a conspiracy on
the part of the Chinese gamblers of Mott
street, who were incensed because he had
testified against them in several trials. As
he stood at the bar of the court Ten Kee
Sing wore two medals pinned to his waist
coat. One of them was of gold and had
been presented to him by the Navy Depart
ment. The other, of silver, bore this in
scription :
"To Charles Tong Sing. In commemo
ration of perils encountered, and in ex
pression of the high esteem in which Con
gress held his services. [Act approved
September 30, 1801.] 1879-1832."
He explained that under the name of
Charles Tong Sing he bad served as a
steward on the ill-fated Jeanette of the
Arctic expedition. He shared the suffer
ings of the party under command of Engi
neer Melville, which traveled 700 miles
over the ice and escaped the fate of the
rest of the expedition. Two other facts in
Ten Kee Sing's career are that he was
born in San Francisco thirty-eight years
ago and served as a policeman in Port
land, Or.

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. B.â Jackson
d:iy, the eiglity-tirst anniversary of the
battle of New Orleans, was celebrated by
: â  Business Men's Democratic Associ
ation to-night at the Savoy Hotel. Theo
dore Myers presided and at hisrightsat
tary of the Navy Herbert, e\-
Governor Flower, ex-GovernorT. M. Wal
ler of Connecticut, Congressman Amos J.
Cumraings and Judge I', li. Degro. At
the chairman's left were Isidore Eaynes,
Comptroller Fitch, Postmaster Dayton, J.
1.. Simmons, Evan Thomas and C. C.
Baldwin.
Chairman Myers arose and congratu
lated those present upon thÂ«> proof afforded
by their member-, who. lie said, were the
Old Guard of D principles, that
had neither died nor turrendered. Mr.
Myers then introdw ed the lion. Hilary U.
Herbert, who spoke on â¢Sound Money
Necessary to Coi â¢â¢ â¢â  â â¢'â  Prosperity."
Mr. Herbert was received with great en
thusiasm and commended the "firm
foreign policy" of Andrew Jackson, which
has caused our country to take a stand
among toe nations of the earth it has
never before occupied. He further claimed
for the Tennessee statesman that he saw
I 5 it can be pointed out to-day
the value of the soundest currency, and in
f a financial crisis, severe and
: prolonged than any this country has
ever witnessed, he brought the currency of
the hind back to a sound basis by an ex
hibition of courage and devotion to prin
Â« hu-h, though it may have its paral
never to be surpassed. With this
minary reference to the hero of the
day Secretary Herbert immediately
.ed off to a discussion of existing
tary conditions.
â¢No man," he said, "who reads Andrew
:i aright can for a moment doubt
where he would stand unon this question, :
is upon record as declaring in the
mist solemn manner that a silver dollar ,
should have in it neither more nor less
than a dollar's worth of silver, reckoned
i-ommercial value. He held no such
ideas a< are now advocated that the
Government can declare a nitio by law
and maintain two metals at par on that
ratio, simply because die law so provides.
Jfe knew that the relative value of gold
iiid silver was a commercial question, to
Le settled by the markets of the world.
lie saw that a difference of 3 cents in the
value of the bullion in a gold and in a
silver dollar had driven gold out of the
country, and he therefore signed a law
that cnanged the ratio of the two metals
from 15)4 to ! to 1(> to !â¢"
Continuing he said: "Our currency sys
tem must be reformed and reformed on
: principles. How shall we ever get
this reform? It can only be effected be
getting a sound-money President and
sound-money Congress at the same time.
It is easy enough to get the House, for the
House represents the people, and the
le of this country will always be for
eound money by a iarge majority. But
the Senate we must have, too."
A telegram from the President was read
and elicited unbounded applause. It was
addressed to the chairman of the com
mittee and said :
In spirit I join your guests to-night in their
applause of every patriotic sentiment which
the occasion inspires and I rejoice with them
in their manifestations of that love for our
National life an<l honor which characterized
â -eat American whose deeds and valor
you commemorate. Grovkr Cleveland.
' hairman Myers introduced ex-Governor
J'lower, who responded to the toast "The
btate of New York." Incidentally he re
ferred to President Cleveland on the Ven
ezuelan question:
"I don't believe that one inch they do
not at present possess on this continent
Should be given to a foreign monarchy. If
a war comesâ and God grant that it may
notâ you will salute Grover Cleveland as
you to-night salute Andrew Jackson, l
â wa .t you to study the Monroe doctrine.
It does not mean war unless England
wains it. Let us stand for the Monroe
doctrine, which is the fundamental prin- ,
ciple of our Government."
Governor Waller was the next
Breaker, and responded to the toast
"Patriotism and Partisanship." He said :
"I have listened and applauded with
Vigor the patriotic utterances of the
fpeakers before me, for I rejoice in the Na
tional feeling that has been set on fire
within the last thirty days. Our 10,000,000
of votersâ sovereigns and rulers, partisans
and politiciansâ are- to-night, without ex
ception, all patriots too, and their patriot
ism is not jingoism ; it is love of country
and not love of war. Tup world never saw
a better illustration of the power of patri
otism and partisanship, when acting to
gether, as our political opponents pre
sented in Congress in their unanimous
Biipport of the chief of our Nation and our
great part}' leader when be raised the
American standard in front of old England
and advanced to the uttermost limit the
doctrine of Monroe."

Secretary J/nke Smith Makes a J'olitical
Sjirrrh.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., ian. 8.- For the
tixteenth year the Young Men's Demo
cratic Association to-night observed the
anniversary of the victory of Andrew
Jackson's- force over the British at New
Orleans by a dinner. About 200 members
of the association were present. The prin
cipal guests of the evening were Vice-
President Stevenson, Secretary Hoke
Bmitli, D. N. Morgan, Treaurer of the
Tinted States; United States Senator
Charles J. Faulkner of West Virginia and
John L. Seymour. Commissioner of Pat
ent?. Attorney-General Harmon was ex
pected to be present to respond to the
toast "The President of the United States,"
"but he was detained in Washington by
Government business before the Supreme
Court.
fcfccretary Smith spoke to the toast, "The
Public Credit/ Mr. Smith's speech was
, in advocacy of a gold standard as opposed
i to free silver.
Secretary Hoke Smith, at the dinner of
the Young Men's Democratic Association
to-niciit, in opening his address declared
that Andrew Jackson was a "sound-money
I Democrat. 1 ' He said the Republicans left
the treasury practically empty, with the
exception of the gold reserve, when tinned
over to the Democrats on March 4, 1803.
He urped that the financial disturbance
bes;an before the revenues had ceased to
! be sufficient to meet the expenses of the
| Government; also that the first deficiency
i was before the passage of new tariff legis
! lation, there having been a deficiency in
i round numbers of $60,000,000 during the
j twelve months immediately preceding the
i repeal of the McKinley bill. He also
showed that since the passage of the Sher
man purchasing act, gold to the amount
of $395,000,000 had been withdrawn from
j the treasury. Concluding his remarks,
the Secretary said:
"No one questions the ability of the
j Government to meet its current expenses.
It is the doubt as to the purpose of the
| Government to maintain gold as a stand
; ard which has created the distrust, which
' has shaken confidence, which has checked
! business and lessened the revenue. He
move this doubt and the increase of the
eeneral prosperity will readily take care of
the question of the revenues.
"Andrew Jackson was distinguished for
his courage and patriotism. Let Demo
crats meet the issue before the country
with the same spirit and Republican ma
jorities will fade before them."
Celebrated at Little Hack.

STANDS BY OLD GLORY.
Manager Rice Resents Insults to
the Flag by Canadian
Audiences.
Intends to Decorate a Montreal Stage
With Several Gross of the
Emblems.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. B.â Many
persons who go to Theatrical Manager
Edward E. Rice's burlesque shows have
noticed ttat the American flag plays a |
prominent part in the productions. One \
of Mr. Rice's productions is called "1492," '
as nearly everybody knows, and it is
thoroughly American. There is an en
trancing Columbian march in one act,
where the pretty girls wear very little
except the stars and stripes, of about the
dimensions usually used to decorate
patriotic Christmas-trees.
Mr. Rice took this entirely American
production to Australia last year. It is
said it would have duplicated there its suc
cesses in New York but for the fact that
Mr. Rice refused to substitute the Union
Jack for Old Glory. Great bitterness was
thereby engendered and Mr. Rice came
home disgusted.
He sent his show to Canada last week.
Everything went well until Monday ni^ht,
when a week's engagement was begun in
the Academy of Music, Montreal. There
Mr. Rice expected the show to do a profit
able business. His amazement therefore
knew no bounds that night when he re
ceived the news that his flaps had been
hissed and he immediately telegraphed to
liis manager, "Give them the American
flag or no show."
Early yesterday morning Mr. Rice
rushed down to the office of Lawyer
Charles S. Hess and instructed Mr. Hess
to draw up an appeal to the Suite Depart
ment and Mr. Hess did it. Mr. Rice next
went out and bought several gross of
American Hags, together with the finest
silk Old Glory he could find. There he
racked in his trunk and at f> o'clock he
boarded a New York Central train for
Montreal.
Before starting Mr. Rice told Mr. Hess
that he intended to decorate the theater
with American Hags to-day, and, more
over, that he would drive from the railway
station to his hotel in a cab festooned
with the American colors. Rice's friends
say he would carry out his threat if he had
to cancel the entire Canadian tour of the
"1492" company.
TORTVREto BY WBITES.
Ruffians Compel an Aged Indian to Sur-
render His Gold.
PARIS, Tex., Jan. B.â ln the mountains
twenty miles east of Tushkahoma, Ind.
T., Jack Battiste, an old Choctaw, was re
ported to have kept money at his house.
Sunday four white men, who had disguised
themselves in various ways, entered the
house and stood around fcr a while warm
ing: themselves. Then they took Battiste
out of the house, and tried by threats to
get him to tell where his money was hid
den, but he refused. This was followed by
an unmerciful lasbine, in which his skin
and flesh were terribly lacerated. Still he
would not tell.
He was then Irauled up by the neck and
handed until life was almost extinct. As
soon as he could speak after being let
down he told them to tell his wife to give
them the money, and she gave them $750.
The bandits then went away.

Captain yon Hugo, from Venice December
11, via Gibraltar December L'o, for Phila
delphia, with the loss of all the blades of

Captain yon Hugo requested to be towed
to New York, but as the Yurumuri bad
scarcely coal enough to enable her to reach
port and tiad a perishable cargo aboard the
latter was nr.able to render assistance.
When the Yurumuri left the disabled
steamer she was about 110 miles off South
Shoat lightship.

[From a night sketch made, on the spot by a "Call" staff artitL]
ment has been begun. It will instantly
create a response in the United States,
and thus the original warlike situation
may prove a preliminary to a great and
noble peace, honorable to the nations con
cerned and a -esson to the world. Half of
the mischief which has desolated man
kind has been due to inability to put our
selves in the point of view of our fancied
enemy. To learn what he thinks is our
first duty and our most vital interest. Let
us realize the American feeling, as Amer
icans should and will realize ours. Let us
provide a method for putting each view
before wise and learned men.
"That the present friction can only be
ended by impartial arbitration is already
certain. Lord Salisbury could not possibly
face Parliament with the statement that lie
had refused to meet the United States on
this ground. The first movement in this
particular issue between the two countries
should have, perhaps, come from our
Government as soon as Secretary Olney's
dispatcli was handed to Lord Salisbury.
"Our conviction is that when Lord Salis
bury shall have replied it will be time for
the English people to speak touching the
necessity for what Kant called 'perpetual
peace.' This would involve the establish
ment of a permanent court of arbitration
between the two countries to discuss,
advise upon and adjudicate all disputes
that may arise. That court, we are able to
say, the American Government desires."
WAR TALK IX JAMAICA.
Sentiment Divided Jletivcen English and
A iner {can Claims.
NEW YORK , N. V.. Jan. 8.-The Times
correspondent in Kingston, Jamaica, writ
ing under date of December 31, says: "A
great deal- of excitement has been occa
sioned here by the attitude of the United
States toward Great Britain relative to the
Venezuelan question. It is popularly be
lieved that nothing can avert a. war be
tween the two great branches of the
English-speaking people, and the idea is
abroad that before the American fleet goes
down to try conclusions with the British
at Venezuela it will stop en route and cap
ture Jamaica.
"The idea is most improbable, but is
believed in, all the same, and a good deal
of brag is the result. To hear people talk
one would think Jamaica was a second
Gibraltar. The oddity of it is that the
very people who are loudest in their
boasts about 'beating off the Yankees' are
those who usually talk the most glibly
about 'the manifest destiny' of the West
Indies to become an integral part of the
great republic and who can best recount
the many advantages, commercial and in
dustrial and even political that such a
destiny would involve. Yet, when there
is the ieast appearance of the transfer beine:
accomplished they talk of resisting it as a
great evil.
"In point of fact, while intelligent Ja
maicans do not really believe that there
will be any war, they do think that it
would be advantageous to all the colonies
could they somehow get their Hag and
allegiance changed and come within the
direct influences of the United States."

FRESNO, Cat,., Jan. B.â Deputy Con
stable Bigelow of the foothill region in
â  Madera County had an experience yester
day which he will not soon forget and
which will, no doubt, teach him a valu
able lesson.
He went up to the North Fork country
and arrested a man named Fred Pierce
on a warrant charging him with disturb
ins the peace. The oliicer had a two
i seated carriage, and placed the prisoner
on the rear seat for the journey to court.
Pierce was not handcuffed.
Everything went well for the first ten
miles. When in the vicinity of the Oneal
postoftice the prisoner took charge of
affairs.
At the opportune moment Pierce threw
his arms about the deputy constable,
pinioning the latter's arms, and then took
the officer's pistol out of his hip pocket.
Coming to the front seat, Pierce took
the reins from the officer and threw him
out of the buggy. Now armed with the
deputy constable's pistol, Pierce drove on
for half a mile, when he unhitched one of
the horses,
He mounted the horse and rode back to
his home. As he passed the officer Pierce
taunted him considerably, but as he had
the pistol Bigelow was powerless to do
anything.
XOKTHERy PACIFIC TANGLE.
Settlement of the Hccrlvrrrhip Affair Is
Thounht to Be Close at llnÂ»l.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. B.â While re
fraining from expressing a positive
opinion. Receiver Burleigh of the North
ern Pacific is not inclined to place very
much credence in the report to the effect
that the receivership matter is to be
handed over to the control of the five
Supreme Court Justices sent out to-day
from Milwaukee.
"As a matter of fact," Mr. Burleigh said,
"the ."Northern Pacific Railroad extends
not through five but three â seventh, eighth
and ninthâUnited States judicial circuits,
though the main officers of the company
are in the New York circuit. If. such a
movement is on foot," Mr. liurleieru con
tinued, "I know nothing of it, for action
would betaken by the lawyersin the case."
As regards what would probably be done
to-morrow at Helena by Circuit Judge
Gilbert, Mr. Burleigh said action would
have no relation to the new phase; that it
was merely more to unify the receive r>.'iip
for the ninth circuit, compiising the States
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Mon
tana.
The final settlement of the Northern
Pacific receivership muddle, Mr. Burleigh
thinks, is near at hand, as "there is a point
beyond which great interests will not per
mit warring parties to go."

before the faculty and students ot Napa
College to-day on "Ideality and Sublim

Dr. Case was extremely happy in the

lesson of the lecture was that the youth of
the country ought to cultivate the faculty
of sublimity, giving breadth and sweep to
their mentality; that they ought to reach
out for trreat thoughts, for high aspira
tions. He said that those of the present
generation have v right to expect much
and that much will be demanded of them.
To stimulate his hearers he quoted the
word 8 of the poet:
Nobly bpjjiu.
If only limo for but ;i line, !>Â«â¢ that sublime!
Not lailure, bin, low aim, the <rime.
Dr. Case was heartily congratulated at

Jack Littlefield's
Murder.
CONFLICTING EVIDENCE.
Baylis Van Horn, John Crow and
Joe Gregory the Men
Charged.
THE STORY TOLD BY VINTON.
A Motion to Discharge the Defendants
on the Ground of Insufficient
Proof Denied.
URIAH, Cat,., Jan. B.â Last Monday
morning at 10 o'clock the preliminary ex
amination of Baylis Van Horn. .John Â«'row
and Joe Gregory, charged with the mur
der of Jack Littlefield at lied Mountain on
the 27th of last September, began befor*
Justice Philbrook.
District Attorney Bartlett appeared for
the people and D. G. Reid for the defense,
: and Frank Woodbury was sworn in aa
stenographer to report the testimony.
The lirst witness called for the prosecn
! tion was John M. Vinton, who testified
: that he had been shot by Littletield two
j days before the date of the alleged mur
j der, while riding on the range. The
! me of Vinton was what led to the hanging
| of Littlefield.
Vinton testified that the man who shot
him had his faoe covered, but he recog
nized Littlefield by his peculiar stoop. It
was late in the afternoon, but there was
light enough to see plainly, [n response
to a question as to where he was shot Vin
ton opened his vest and shirt and showed
a bullet wound in his breast on the right
side and an inch or so lrom the breast
bone. The bullet passed through his
body, breaking a couple of ribs in its
passage.
Following Vinton, George Van Horn,
George Kindred, T. B. Hayden, Dryden
Leacock, better known as "Buck" Lea
cock, and P. R. Kadciiffe testified. Court
then adjourned till Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday the prosecution rested it*
case after the following witnesses were
heard: James Wilburn Jr., who testified
tbat Littlcfield was with him and not near
the scene of the shootins of Vinton; Wil
liam Espy, Frank Potter, John Wathen,
stepson of Yes Palmer, employer of Little
field; Walter Clark, J. A. Box, W. P.
O'Neil, W. Shields, P. G. Potter a:;d Thos.
Steele.
The testimony was of a general charac
ter and followed the events from the shoot
ing of Vinton to the killing of Littlefield,
giving the movements and whereabouts of
the defendant to the best knowledge <>f
the witnesses. There was testimony as
to the gathering at Vjnton's house of a
number of men and of a search being
made for track?, etc. ; of the arrest of Lit
tlelield and of the events subsequent to the
arrest as far as known.
At the close of the testimony counsel
for the defense moved that the defendants
be discharged on the eround that the evi
dence was insufficient to justify holding
them for trial. The motion was then ar
gued and submitted, the court taking th<>
matter under advisement till Wednesday
morning at 10 o'clock, at which time the
motion was denied.
Court then adjourned till 12 o'clock of
the same day, at which time the defense
asked for a continuance until January 20
in order to enable it to produce testimony
in its behalf.
The request was granted, and tho hear
ing was continued till Monday, January
20, at 10 o'clock.

ened by Jlall crashing in the front door of
the house. The butcher ran to the front
room, and there he was confronted by
Hall, who immediately leveled a pistol at
him. Peterson did not know Hall and
immediately came to the conclusion that
he was crazy, and he dodged back into
the bedroom and secured a Winchester
rifle.
Just as he got to the door leading from
the bedroom to the front room Peterson
leveled his ritlo on tlie unceremonious
visitor, intending to make short work of
him.
At this dangerous juncture Hall dropped
his pistol and cried out: "Don't shoot;
don't shoot. lam afraid."
Peterson complied with the earnest re
quest and asked Hall what, he wanted.
The latter replied that he was looking for
his wife, who had left him, and asked per
mission to search the house.
This was granted and failing to find his
better half Hall departed, after apologiz
ing for what he had donr.
He ret iirned 1 about an hour later and
begged Peterson to have him arrested.
Hall said that he was crazy over his wife's
desertion and did not know what he was
doing wi-en he invaded Peterson's house.
No arrests were made.
Mr?. Hall is stopping with a private
family in this city and she says that she
left her husband because she could not en

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1896.
SANTA ROSA'S WATER
Opponents to the Bonds
Achieve a Temporary
Victory.
A DEMURRER SUSTAINED
Judge Daingerfield Makes a Plain
Statement From the
Bench.
EXCHANGE OF BONDS FOR WORK.
"If the Complainant's Allegations Be
True Contract Must Be
Void."
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Jan. B.â ln the
case of Wesley Mock vs. the City of Santa
Rosa Judge Daingeriield of San Francisco,
presiding in Judge Douirherty's depart
ment, made an order sustaining the spe
cial demurrer of the city and allowing the
plaintiff ten days to amend complaint.
This suit was brought in the name of
Wesley .Mock by the opponents to the new
water system to have the bond sale de
clared illegal and the subsequent letting
of the contract void.
In open court to-day the Judge said:
"If the allegations in the complaint were
true I would hold the contract void and a
general demurrer should be overruled."
One cause of action set forth in the com
plaint alleges that the bonds were not
legally sold, but were exchanged for the
work. In referring to this charge the
Judge says there is no impropriety in the
exchange of bonds for work.
Another cause of action set forth in the
complain! alleges that the contract for the
construction of the works is void because
the plan of the work was not in accord
ance with the plans and specifications of
Monjeau which were originally adopted
by the city, and were the plans and speci
fications on which the election was held
and the bonds issued. If this be true the
Judge holds the contract void.
The demurrer, in as far as holding that
the complaint did not state facts sufficient
to constitute a cause of action, was not
sustained by the court.
The Judge's opinion further than has
already been mentioned has not yet been
filed, but the Council claim they nave fol
lowed Monjeau's plans, with such excep
tion? as were allowed by law.
The variations made in the plans and
specitications as adopted by the city con
stitute the strong point in the plaintiff's
complaint. The ruling has been favorably
construed by the attorney? for both sides,
each considering important points won.
SAN DIEGO WATER RATES.
A Rousing Meeting of the Con
sumers Held Last
Night.
The Land and Town Company's Action
Severely Denounced and a Fight
to Come. *
SAN DIEGO, Cat,., Jan. B.â A rousing
mass-meeting of water-consumers under
the Sweetwater system was called to-night
at Chula Vista, and almost every rancher
in the section affected was present.
Originally the meeting was called to
take action against the arbitrary move of
the San Dieeo Land and Town Company
in shutting off the water from the entire
system, but word was received during tbe
day that Judge Ross of the United States
Circuit Court had peremptorily ordered
the water turned on again. The meeting
to-night, therefore, was more temperate,
though it was sufficiently warm to leave
no doubt of the rancher's position in the
matter.
Hon. A. Keen, representative from the
Eightieth District, presided, and speeches
were made by Colonel C. H. Rippey and
Judge M. L. Ward, counsel for the con
sumers.
Colonel Rippey denounced the com
pany's acts as worse than that of Btape
robbers and said he would advise the
ranchers to fight the case to the end
rather than pay double rates after buying
water rights outrieht.
Judge Ward saiti the company had con
ceded that the consumers in purchasing
water rights had become joint owners of
the water with the company, and he also
urged a contest in the courts.
The committee previously appointed to
canvass the ranchers for $1 per acre to
light the case reported that 1250 acres had
been pledged and during the evening $700
cash was raised. The committee was em
powered to employ legal talent and fight
the case to a nnieh.
The company will probably turn on the
water to-morrow, but in the meantime the
bill oi equity in the Federal court will be
heard.
The company alleges that the rate de
manded, $7 per acre, is reasonable and
necessary to yield 6 per cent on its invest
ment: that it has the right to impose it,
and that consumers have no right to enter
separate suits in court to compel the com
pany to furnish water at the old rate of
$3 50 per acre. A decree and injunction is
prayed for accordingly.
The temper of the meeting to-night was
to make concession whether the company
was to contest its right to fix rates at all.
FJtESXO COSTRACTOn GOXJE.
lie Took $2600 With Him and Left Ilia
Men Unpaid,.
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. B.â Charles Good
fellow, who had nearly completed his $7000
contract on the sewer extension work in
tins city, was to have paid off his laborers
this evening at Dick Hedinger's cigar
store. Mr. Goodfeilow had fixed this time
and place for paying the men.
At the appointed hour nearly a hundred
men assembled with claims ranging from
$5 to $75. Mr. Goodfellow did not appear,
and after waiting for several hours the
laborers were startled by the report that
their employer had left town.
Yesterday he drew $2fJOO as partial pay
ment on the contract.
One of Goodfellow's bondsmen, when
seen to-night, said that he was satisfied
that the contractor had left for good with
the $2600. It is thought that he went to
San Francisco.
A warrant was sworn out to-night for
his arrest.
While here he had a woman with him
whom he claimed to be his wife, which
was not the case.

STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. B;â The steamer
J. D. Peters ran on the bank last night at
low water at the first cut on the river,
known as Dutchman's, about seven miles
from Stockton.
The vessel was very heavily loaded, and
when she went on the bank was unnble to
pet off again. She was still in the mud
when the Mary Garratt and Captain
â¢\\ eber passed her this morning.
When the Peters struck the mud bank

with her fantail out in the stream, so- that
there was barely passageway for the
Dauntless when elie reached that place.
The steamer, did not arrive at the wharf
until this afternoon.

The evidence against him is conclusive
so far as has been taken and his chances
for San Quentin are favorable.

A NEW HAMLET IN JAMES.
That Actor's Interpretation of
the Danish Prince Proves
a Revelation.
Notes of Attractions at the Other
Playhousesâ Only Standing Room
at the Columbia.
Louis James' portrayal of Hamlet last
night was a revelation even to his warmest
admirers. This is the lirst season he has
played the role, though it is stated that for
years he has been fired with the ambition
to give his own rendition of the Prince of
Denmark.
During that time James has given much
time ana thought to perfecting his own
conception of the complex character, and
the result, as shown last night, is a Ham
let out of the beaten track, and one that,
for artistic intelligence, as well as for
finished technical skill, can challenge com
parison with such Hamlets as those of
Sliendan, Barry Sullivan, Henry Irvine,
and even the Hamlet of the great Booth
himself.
With regard to the external make-up of
the part. Louis James affects the blonde
or Scandinavian typo, rather than that of
the traditionally dark-haired Dane. His
golden locks add to the youthfulness of
his appearance, thereby giving him about
the Prince's rightful age of 30 years.
From beginning to end of the tragedy
James' portrayal of the Prince of Den
mark waa even and effective. In his
speech and action he followed his own di
rections to the players and never tore a
passion to tatters. His enunciation was
clear and telling, without any trace of
ranting, and his gestures helped to heighten
and emphasize the meaning of his words.
James' conception of the part struck a
medium between madness and sanity,
which was calculated to send the audience
home as puzzled as to whether the Prince
of Denmark were mad or feigning as
Shakespeare probably intended students of
the part should ever be.
He never emphasized the insanity as be
ing a mere cloak to discover his uncle's
guilt. At Ithe same time there was a
method in his madness which gave sym
metry and harmoniousne?s to his interpre
tation.
In the closet scene James was especially
strong. There was a touch of sincerity
and genuine feeling in his reproaches to
the Queen which proclaimed the true
artist. The play scene also he worked up
to a splendidly dramatic climax.
The support was on the whole good.
Miss Alma Kruger was a rather modern
Ophelia in the opening scenes, but she was
admirably natural and effective in the mad
scene. Harris was good as the King, Guy
Lindsley made an impassioned Laertes
and all the other parts were in satisfactory
hands. The scenery was excellent.
"Hamlet" will be repeated to-nipht.
The Frawley company has been more that
repeating this week at the Columbia Theater
its former success. "The Lost Paradise" is a
strong play, and it has evidently pleased the
popular taste, for the sign, "Standing room
only," has been out at most of the perform
ances.
There have been so many requests for "The
Senator" that it has been decided to make that
play the bill for next week.
Marie Wainwrlght and her company are
pleasing good-sized audiences at the Baldwin
Theater with the production of Lancaster and
Maznus' "Daughters of Eve." The clever lead
ing lady has satisfactory support, which helps
to make the drama a success.
Next Monday Marie Waimvright will be seen
in Sheridan Knowles' old play, "The Love
Chase." "Camille" will be put on at the end
01 the week.
It ia some time since Morosco produced a
play better suited to the scenic capabilities of
the Grand and to the company playing there
than "The Fugitive." There are strong situa
tions in the exciting; drama. Miss Maud Edna
Hail, and Coulter Bnnker being especially suc
cessful in rising to them.
The sparkling comicalities of "My Precious
Baby" are affording plenty of amusement for.
the audience at trover's Alcazar this week.
Leonard Orover Jr. Jius made quite a hit as the
"Baby," and the rest of the company are quite
at home iv their various roles.
The Orpheum has several strong acts this
wÂ«ek, particularly that of Newell and Shevetle
on the horizontal bars. The Manhattan Com
edy Four Quartet also does some pleasing
work, and Clifford and Hutu, in their dialect
duets, are thoroughly entertaining.
The spectacular burlesque "Ixion," with its
new specialties, is still proving a popular at
traction at the Tivoli.
Supplies for the Valley Road.
Supplies for the Valley road ore simply pour

SCORED THE GRAND JURY
School Directors' Take Exception
to Its Recently Rendered
Report.
MR. BABCOCE'S STRONG TALK.
An Investigation Is Urgently De
manded at the Hands of the
Present Jury.
"The last Grand Jury, or at least certain
members oi it, were bunkoed by P. A.
Hyde into making the report it did on the
School Department," said Superintendent
Babcock at last night's meeting of the
Board of Education, after the reading of
the report.
Mr. Babcoek was thoroughly in earnest
as he spoke and betrayed far more feeling
than he generally does when talking
before the board.
"Where, in any of the laws defining the
powers of the Grand Jury," he continued,
"will you find anything giving it the
power to interfere with the business of the
Board of Education ? It never would have
interfered, either, had it not been misled
by the statements of a man who has gone
out of his way to besmirch the present
board."
Then Director Clinton took up the cud
gels and said that lie desired to call atten
tion to some glaring errors in the report.
"Some of the statements are absolutely
false," he said, "and we should not rest
under the imputation of bavins committed
acts which we have not. The report, in
speaking of the Normal School, states that
we nave been spending $.5000 on the Nor
mal School, when, as a matter of fact,
during the past year it cost but $2<>Bo to
run the institution."
He closed by moving that the report be
â¢'Hyde bound" and referred to the Suuer
intendent, a course that was adopted.
The board seemed determined not to let
the matter rest, however, for presently
Director Carew introduced the following
resolution, which was adopted:
Whereas, The late Grand Jury has charged
the Board of Education with gro'sa and willful
extravagance, namely, squandering public
funds; and whereas, said charges have been
made without having accorded a full and fair
hearing to the Hoard of Education ; and where
as, said Board of Education and the oJ tizens and
taxpayers of this City "ud County are entitled
to a full and fair hearing of the above charges;
now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Board of Education of
this City and County demimd at the hands of
the present Grand Jury a full and fair hearing
of the above charges, and \ve respectfully in
vite the Grand Jury to meet in conference v.ith
the Board of Education, at their convenience,
so that the said charges may be thoroughly
investigated, and that a copy'of these resolu
tions be' transmitted to the secretary of the
Grand Jury now in session.
Again Superintendent Babcock got in a
word, saying that lie knew that the chair
man of the Grand Jury Committee on
School Department had been wined and
dined by one who seemed anxious to in
jure the present board.
Wen the reports of committees were
called for, Chairman Hawley of the Com
mittee on Supplies read a report in which
he severely criticized the Grand Jury re
port, and cited instances where the state
ments made were erroneous.
Mrs. H. A. St. John, Mrs. M. H. Cur
rier and Miss L. C. Ryder upon their own
request, approved by the Judiciary Com
mittee, were authorized to retire from their
positions as teachers and to avail them
selves of the provisions of the Teachers'
Annuity and Retirement Fund.
The Committee on llules made the fol
lowing recommendations regarding the
school terms for 1896, which were adopted:
That the first term shall begin on the first
Monday in January â the tith inst.â and
end on Friday, June 5. The second term
shall begin on Monday, July 20. and end
on Friday, December 18. There shall be a
vacution during the third week in March,
from the l(3th to the 20th, and during the
second week in October, from the sth to
the 9th.
The Committee on Classification ren
dered a report recommending that Director
Henderson's plan' for the reorganization of
the Normal School be not carried out dur
ing the present term, but on the motion of
the author of the measure the matter was
referred to a committee of the whole for
further consideration.
A resolution offered by Director Carew,
providing that when it shall become neces
sary for a principal to suspend a pupil for
any reason said pupil shall not be re
instated without the consent of the prin
cipal, together with that of the Superin
tendent, was adopted.
The recommendation of the Committee
on Classification that Mrs. Margaret B.
Cooper be appointed a substitute teacher
of cooking to till any vacancies that may
occur by absence of regular teachers, and
to receive compensation only when
actually employed, was adopted.
President Dodge reported that the com
mittees for the ensuing year would be as
follows:
Finance â Ilawley, Murdock, Barrett.

LA RUE STILL FIGHTING.
Another Prickly Affidavit
Filed Before Judge Mo
Kenna.
Railroad Commissioners Wish to Intro
duce the Congressional Com
mittee's Report.
One short affidavit made by Railroad
Commissioner H. M. La Rue was intro
duced yesterday before Judge McKenna in
the injunction suit of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company against the Railroad
Commissioners. It is but a minor docu
ment among five scores of larger ones with
which the defendants intend bombarding
the enemy. Still, it was objected to as
irrelevant, immaterial and not made up of
necessary facts to entitle it to considera
tion.
It took the entire day, barring a short
time while a few witnesses were heard, for
ex- Judge Hayne to lay a foundation before
the court on which he may this morning
build up authorities to satisfy his Honor
that not only this but ail the other affi
davits presented the day previous should
be entertained.
Judge McKenna appears to be in terror
of having to listen to the reading of the
voluminous documents, and before be de
cides on the question of their admissibility
he insists that the material points why
they should be read to him be fully ex
plained.
Should Mr. Hayne gain his point it will
entail the admission as evidence of the
twenty-six volumes ol the reuort of the
Committee on Pacific and Other Aided
Roads. This will place on record the
sworn testimony of the late Senator Stan
ford, Charles Crocker, A. N. Towne and
Messrs. Stubbs, Miller. Gage, C. P. Hunt
ington, JL D. Boruck, I). O. Mills, A. A.
Cohen and many others. It will likewise
furnish evidence that the bonded indebted
ness of the railroad company has been
creatly inflated, and that past and defunct
boards of Kailroad Commissions have been
working as against the interests of the
public.
Mr. Hayne managed to be permitted to
introduce a number of witnesses to estab
lish the admissibility of the public docu
ment by proving the depositions made
before the Congressional committee by
those people who made them and who are
still aiive.
Attorney Bergin, J. C. Stubbs and F. S.
Doutv each told his tale of being examined
by tiie Congressional committee, and that
the report ulod with Congress was correct.
The evidence was admitted, notwith
standing Attorney Herring objection that
the facts which were shown in 138, wÂ«re
not pertinent to the suit dealing with the
fact 3 now existing.
The gist of the affidavit at present under
fire reads as follows: .
Affiant deposes and says, unon his luforma
tionand belief, in tne yearl3B7-83acomrnitu-e,
under an act of Congress, consisting of Messrs.
Pattison, Anderson and Littler, to investigate
the atl'airs of the railroads known as the I acme
THihoads, duly organized and held session-* 111
the City and County ol i^an Francisco pursuant
to said net of Contrress, at various oflices of said
Central Pacific Kailroad and the Southern
Pacific Company, including the president and
members of the board of directors of said com
pany and the heads of departments of the sain
companies. The complainant herein appeared
before said commission and testilied under oath,
and that their testimony was reduced to writ
ing and signed by them respectively , and by the
President of the United States transmitted to
Washington, and are now among the archives
of Congress and of the Government of the
United States; tbat said testimony was printed
under the authority ot the Government of the
United States, and that the books herewith
presented to the court in this cause, to wit:
Volumes 2 to 8 of Senate executive documents,
first session, Fiftieth Congress, 1887-88, con
tained true copies of the testimony and deposi
tions so deposited in the archives of the Gov
ernment at Washington; that at the sessions
of said commission the complainant herein
was represented by counsel, and that the tes
timony aforesaid was voluntarily given by the
saia officers of said companies in their official
capacity and was on behalf of the com
plainant herein; that the testimony of
C. P. Huntington, who was then vice-president
of the complainant, was given before said
commission in the same manner as nbove
stated at the session of said commission made
at Washington, and was reduced to writing,
signed, disposed of and printed, as above set
set forth; and afliaut iurther says, upon infor
mation and belief, that said testimony so
given by said officers of the complainant, so
given in their official capacity and on behalf
of said complainant, and in the transaction of
its business, showed that in the construe tion
of the Central Pacific Kailroad great frauds
occurred, and that said construction was
wasteful and extravagant, and that the said
road could be built now for 70 per cent less
than it then cost, and that large sums of
money were improperly expended by
the officers of said company and
was not accounted for; all of which
goes to increase the bonded indebtedness
which is sought to be made a basis of the ac
tion of the court in this cause; and that
said testimony also explained the relations of
said various companies to each other, and the
relations of the various officers to said com
panies and to each other, and showed the al
leged leases, mentioned in the bill of complaint
herein, were mere pretended leases, and were
not designed or intended to have any force or
effect, and also tends to show improper in
fluences used by the officers ot said com
pany upon previous boards of the Rail
way Commissioners of California; and
affiant further says, that to the best of his
knowledge, information and Delief, the said
testimony going to show said and other facts
important to be heard on behalf of the defend
ants in this cause, are true and correct, and
that affiant has no other means of presenting
the same to this court, except through said
testimony presented ns aforesaid; that Leland
Stanford, then president of said company, and
Charles Crocker, one of the directors of said
company, and A. X. Towne, one of the heads
of departments of said complainant, who testi
lied on behaif of said company, as aforesaid
are now dead, and that C. P. Huntington, then
vice-president of said complainant, is now out
of tne jurisdiction of this court.
And affier.t further says that the said Com
missioners made a majority and minority report
in writing of their proceedings under tlie act
of Congress, and transmitted the snid reports,
together with the said testimony, to the Presi
dent o! the United States, and that the Presi
dent of the United States transmitted the said
report, testimony and depositions to the Con
gress of the United States, accompanied with-M
message from himself, as President, to said
Congress concerning these reports and pro
ceeaings, and the copies of all the same are
printed and contained in the volume aforesaid
herewith presented to the court.

of how far Crescendo would win by, and
such proved the case. Mr. Ferguson met
with better success than with bis fields in
the stakes previously run, dispatching
them in fine order. Mount McGregor II
went to the front with a fine showing of
speed, turning into the stretch with a
commanding lead of two lengths. The
favorite, who had been gradually moving
up from fifth position, was at this juncture
third. He indulged the Burns & Water
house youngster with the lead until well
on toward the wire, when he romped past
him and won easily by a length in the fast
time of 1:11 J^. Argentina, the Santa
Anita stable entry, finished in third place.
The attendance was only fair, and in the
ring the betting was to all appearances
the lightest of the week. Favorites cap
tured but two of the six events.
The opening race for three-year-olds at
| five furlongs was taken in a common can
ter by La Mascota, starting at 4 to 1 in the
betting. The 2U to 1 favorite, Pearson,
finished in the place, with Myrtle H third.
The El Primero stable's black horse
Bueno was backed down from 7 to sto
evens, and took the next event on the
! card, a seven-furlong run, in the easiest
possible fashion, after waiting on the out
sider Hanford until the stretch was
reached. The second choice, Adam, was
a good third.
The big dump of the day occurred in the
! steeplechase. Mestor went into the start
er's hands a 6 to 5 favorite, with Colonel
Weightman almost as heavily a backed sec
j ond choice. The Lark was well played at
' remunerative odds, hut met disaster at the
fourth jump. When the field was sent
1 away Cairns, on the 30 to 1 shot Gold
: Dust, was over the first jump in front, and
â  leading the entire route won handily, four
length's before Colonel Weightman. Mes
tor ran an unaccountably bad race, finish
'â  ing a tired third.
The mile and a sixteenth purse race saw
: old Lopan, the 11 to 10 choice, go down in
defeat before the prowess of Mr. Macdon
outrh's English-bred filly. Miss Brummel.
The latter was a heavily played second
choice, the 2)4 to 1 posted against her be
; ing quickly cut to 2. The filly passed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1896.
Fred Gardner, who was out in front, be
fore half the distance had been covered,
and although Logan was hard ridden
through ths stretch the three-year-old
beat him out a length and a half, in the
fast time of 1:47 W.
The roan mar" Emma D was again made
a hot favorite in the last race of the day, a
short six-furlong sprint. Although such
good sprinters as Don Gara, Hymn, Model
and Empress of Norfolk were starters, they
were overlooked in the rush to back the
roan sprinter. The race apparently sim
mered down to a drive in the stretch be
tween Hiram Argo, Emma D and Don
Gara, who were heads apart forty yards
from the wire, when Lloyd brought Hymn
up on the outside and won handily by a
neck. Hiram Argo was placed second,
with the favorite in third place. The win
ner had 12 to 1 against him at post time.
Track and Paddock Items.
Bookmaker Leo Mayer backed El Pri
mero in the opening race.
Hughes & Co. chalked 4 to 5 against
Crescendo and got a $1000 bet from Ed
Purser.
The horses of D. J. Lynch that were sold
at auction by Killip & Co. yesterday
brought only fair prices. J. C. Humphrey
paid fltO for Contribution. Three Fork's
was knocked down to G. Farrar for $500
and Volt to W. Short for $160. Ollie John
son bid $350 for Red Will and secured him.
Frank Carr, a young man with aspirations
toward the turf, got Riot lor $275- The
others brought lesser prices.
Hanford, who finished second, the sec
ond event of the day, was posted as being
five pounds over weieht. When Baliarrt,
who rode him, weighed in at the conclu
sion of the race he "was found to be eight
pounds over his carded weight of 105
pounds. According to the rule all bets
were paid on the horse as finished, but he
was disqualified, receiving no part of the
purse. Baliard. who unthinkingly had
donne.l a heavy undershirt, which ac
counted for the' increase in weight, was
lined $25 by the judges.
Hymn was attached about half an hour
before the last race in which lie started
was called. T. H. Williams Jr. released
the attachment and the horse went out
and won at ortds of 12 to 1. His owner,
Jockey L. Lloyd, was one of the happiest
men on the track after the race.
RACING AT INGLESIDE
Reopening To-Day of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club's New
Course.
The Fair Sex Will Be Admitted With
out Charge, It Being Popular
Ladies' Day.
The picturesque new course of the Pa
cific Coast Jockay Club at Ingleside will
be thrown open to the public again to-day,
alter a cessation of two weeks' racing, and
racegoers will once more see some high
class fields face the flag.
The occasion will also be ladies' day.
and fair lovers of the "sport of kinds'' be
admitted to the course free of any ad
mission charge.
The programme is an excellent one.
I Not the least attractive feature of the card
is the event for the ' 'leppers," a mile and
a quarter handicap hurdle race, with tne
best jumpers on the track sporting silk.
; During the temporary lull in racing at
the new track many improvements have
been made about the grounds. The exits
to the main entrance have been widened,
to obviate any unnecessary crushing or
jostling in the hurry to pass through the
turnstiles. Additional fencing has beau
tied the outlying ground. A costly gns
plant will furnish the illumination for the
betting ring, restaurant, bar, offices and I
storerooms.
The inner track is also about completed,
Superintendent Allen having expressed
the opinion that by Saturday of the
present week it will be ready to race over.
Professor Huber's band of soloists will
furnish the music, which is a most attrac
tive feature of racing.
Secretary Leake states there will be no
further trouble over the transportation
facilities, the electric railway company
having added two new engines to the
power-house.
Starter James F. Caldwell has entirely
recovered from his late indisposition and
will endeavor to uphold his reputation as
the "Prince of American starters."
FOR A GOOD PAVEMENT.
Residents of Folsom Street to
Ask for Their Appro
priation.
The Street Committee at Last to Con
sider the Advisability of
Using Bitumen.
Residents along Folsom street are wait
ing the result of to-day's session of the
Street Committee of the Board of Super
visors with great anxiety. For months
they have been hold ins mass-meetings
and passing resolutions to convince the
Board of Supervisors that the street should
be repaved with bitumen from end to end.
In this they have partially succeeded.
The members of the board have said they
thought it was advisable to have the street
bituminized. But they have added that
they could not afford the expense. It is to
convince them that the expenditure is not
only necessary but is really due that a
committee of seven goes before the Street
Committee at 10 o'clock to-day.
This committee consists of James D.
Phelan, Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, Harvey Som
era, Georse A. Raabe, Henry D. Russ, A.
B. McGuire, S. Samuels, T. Schwartz and
G. L. Center, who will be accompanied by
their attorney, George D. Shadburne,
who will make the chief plea. The other
gentlemen will add their voices in strength
en insr the arguments.
"Nothing has been done for Folsom
street since it was accepted thirty years
ago," said G. L. Center, one of the com
mitteemen, last night, "It is practically
worn out. It has settled from eight to six
teen inches below the official grade and is
in so bad a condition that repairing will
do no good.
"It must do made over entirely. To re
pave it with bitumen would cost $80,000.
To natch it up with the old materials
would cost $25,000. This would be so much
money thrown away, for in a short period
the pavement would be as bad as ever.
' "This is what we want to convince them
of. The new streetcar track will, of course
be built on the official grade. This will
necessitate the building up of the street
and the Supervisors owe it to this side or
Market street to do the work well.
'â¢Even if the City did not owe the $80,000
to ua for the repairs it has left undone on
Folsom street it ought to grant us what
we ask. Up to date it has given the region
south of Market street practically nothing
for its streets. "We have $80,000,000 worth
of taxable property and half the popula
tion of the City, yet last year we received
practically but $8500. Of this amount
$7000 was for a sewer on Fifteenth street
and $1500 for improving Columbia Square.
"1 am afraid we will meet our Waterloo
though," he added. "The board must re
cognize the practical necessity of what we
ask, but they want to use the money for
something else. In case they decided that
way we will have to wait another year for
a new tax levy."

SCOTTISH RITE MASONRY.
The Annual Communication Was
Begun Yesterday in the
Temple.
GRATIFYING REPORTS MADE.
The Election of Officers to Be Held
To-Day â A Banquet in the
Evening.
The Grand Consistory of Masters of the
Royal Secret Thirty-second degree of the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of
Freemasonry, in and for the State of Cali
fornia held its twenty-sixth annual com
munication at the Masonic Temple in this
City yesterday. The consistory was opened
in full form at 1 p. m. Henry A. Cline.
thirty -third grand master, presiding.
Over 100 were in attendance.
The minutes of the last annual communi
cation and subsequent special communica
tions were read and approved. Petitions
for degrees were received and referred to
the appropriate committees.
Grand Master Henry A. Cline delivered
his annual address, which was received
with much gratification. He said that it
afforded him great pleasure to state that
the Scottish Rite was in a more prosperous

GRAND REGISTRAR.

condition than ever before. This was clue
in part to the great increase in the attend- i
ance and the perfect harmony that has !
prevailed among the members, and among
the lodges.
The grand master on this point re
ported that daring the past year no com- |
plaints have been made by the subordinate \
lodges for the committee of jurispru
dence to work upon. The increase in the
membership has been remarkably large i
and the grand master predicted a most sue- j
cessfal year in 1896. All of the oflicers i
and members he said have made special
i efforts to carry out the work laid out by
i the last conclave and it is to their assist- !
ance that such a gratifying condition of
affairs is due.
Grand Registrar George J. Hobe pre
sented his report, which was as gratifying
as that of the grand master. He has held
the position for twenty-four years and in j
concluding his statement added that at no !
j time had the Scottish Rite been more pros- !
j peroue.
The report of the grand treasurer, Sam
uel Levy, showed the financial statement j
to be as satisfactory as could be desired.
The reports were referred to the com- j
mittee on finance.
direful attention was paid to the read- j
ing of the returns from the subordinate :
bodies.
\V. Frairtv Pierce, thirty-third decree, ;
active inspector-general, reported that
daring the year he had established Lodges
of Perfection, fourteenth degree, in Sacra
mento, Redlands, Pasadenaand San Diego, j
The meeting adjourned to meet this
morning at 10 o'clock, when the reports of
the several committees will be read.
The annual election of officers will be j
held in the afternoon. After conferring '
the thirty-second degree, full form, in the
evening, a banquet will be held.
NO NEWS TO POOLROOMS
Ingleside Track Has Taken a
Determined Stand Against
Them.
Not a Place in the State to Get the
Information by Telephone or
Telegraph.
Not a poolroom in San Francisco or any
other tov/n in the State will get any in
formation direct by wire from the Ingle
side track to-day or after to-day. The Pacific
Coast Jockey Club has taken effective
steps to separate the racing under its
auspices from the unpopular associations
of the downtown poolrooms.
The telegraph wire connecting the track
with the City has been leased by the club
and hereafter it will be private and ope
rated by a man in the employ of the Ingle
side authorities. The telephone, Mission
269, was put in at the track especially f<">r
the club and at no time has it been under
the control of ths telephone company. By
absolute restrictions placed upon these
two means of rapid communication the
association will strike a hard blow at
downtown poolrooms with the accompani
ment of women and youthful gamblers.
Edward Corrigan, one of the directors of
the Pacific Jockey Club, said last night:
The substance of our arrangement is this:
the entries to Ingleside track won't be fur
nished to any poolroom in the State. Heretofore
they have been talcing the information tele
graphed to Stockton and sending it back here
immediately by telephone.
Of course, we could get quite a revenue if
we saw tit to furnish the poolrooms with the
news.
I don't know how long this arrangement may
last. The chances are it will be in effect quit"
a while.
There's one thing, the people are not going
to be cursing the racetrack for what is done in
the dives downtown.
Our object is just to keep the track clean and
free from tne evil effects of poolrooms. When
a man bets at the racetrack he sees the race
and ne understands why he lost his money.
In the poolrooms he may be betting after the
race is over.
A prominent ofticer of the association,
corroborating the information and going
more into details, said:
I want this understood : We are not fighting
anybody; it is simply to protect the racing
business. The association is running the race
track, not only for its own interests, but for the
horsemen, the breeders and the honest sports
men, and it does not purpose to encourage
something that the people of San Francisco
seem to be strongly opposed to.
MORE WARRANTS OUT.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare Says
Pool-Sellers Are Acting in Bad
Faith and Will Be Arrested.
The law seems to have no terrors for
downtown pool-sellers, as they persist in
carrying on their nefarious business. As a
result four warrants were sworn out in
Judge Joacbimsen'scourt yesterday morn
ing, and in the afternoon Policemen Syl
vester and Keys arrested William Jackson,
rooms 9 and 10, 9 Ellis street; Frank C.
Patterson, 9 Ellis street; Ed A. Stillman,
rooms 5 and 6, 9 Ellis street, and Francis
M. Garver, 25 Ellis street. Each gave $300
cash bail.
Stillman and Garver are clerks for pool
sellers, and the police are determined in
future to arrest clerks as well as pro
prietors.
"The pool-sellers," said Prosecuting At
torney Dare yesterday, "are acting in bad
faith in asking for continuances till after
the decision on the Givens appeal case. It
wna only to-day that the appeal in that
case was filed, although Givens was con
victed by a jury and sentenced over two
weeks ago.
"I have asked the pool-sellers to grant
me this concession. If they close "their
places of business till the decision in the
Givens case is reached I will close my cal-
endar in regard to tlieir cases. That is a
fair and equitable proposition, but they
won't agree to it and continue to carry on
their business. The result is that we'will
continue to arrest them and I am prepared
to give tnem a trial every day.
"Ninety or R> per cent of the citizens
want these places closed and only sor 10
per cent want them kept open. It'is there
fore the duty of the police, backed np by
the law. to see that they are kept closed
when it is unlawful to keep them open."
A TRAVELER ROBBED.
The Thrilling Experience of A. H.
Brownley With Footpadsâ Lost
Â«."Â»Â»() in Checks.
A. H. Brownley of Lomion, Canada, ar
rived here last night, after an exciting ex
perience at Santa Monica with footpads,
during which he lost $500 in checks issued
to him by the American Express Com
pany. He had some $3000 more in checks
in his pockets from the same company,
but luckily the thieves did not have time
to secure them.
As for his greenbacks and gold, he ha d a
good lot of both, but he had fortunately
given it into the keeping of his wife a few
moments before. She had gone for a walk
with their little son.
Mr. Brownley is at the Russ House. He
was here a week ago, when he first arrived
from Canada. As he was having his
money and other valuables put in the safe
the first night he noticed a middle-aged
man anxiously watching him. On the
train going south, afterward, the same
man fell into conversation with him. At
Santa Monica he went with Mr. Brown
ley for a stroll on the beach. They fell in
with a tall, gaunt man. who said he was
from Kentucky, and had brought horses
to California to sell. Suddenly he drew a
big revolver and told Brownley to hand
over his money. He had but"ls cents in
cash, and snowed it.
'You've pot more," said the big man.
"Get out that pocketbook."
Brownley had to produce it. The other
man obligingly assisted in handling its
contents. " Ten" checks, each for $50, were
found, and Brownley was compelled to
use a fountain pen which tney saw in
another pocket in signing them. Then
the thieves started to run away with them.
Brownley had a revolver and "was just on
the eve of pulling it when a third man,
evidently a confederate, arrested him.
The latter soon let him go ai;d all escaped.
The checks wore numbered from 611,680 to
fÂ»ll,(M) inclusive. They were issued at
London, in Canada, and Brownley has
notified California authorities and* tele
graphed to Canada stopping their payment.
He has had no clew to the thieves since
he was robbed. He is on his way to New
Zealand.

GOVERNOR JOKES SINKING
The Popular Executive of Nevada
Critically 111 at the
Palace.
PHYSICIANS IN CONSULTATION.
He Is Said to Be Afflicted With Serious
Stomach Disease â Something of
His Record.
Governor John E. Jones of Nevada, who
for many weeks has been ill at the Palace
Hotel, has had a relapse. It is doubtful if
he recovers.
Some ailment only vaguely defined as
stomach trouble was said in the earlier
stages of his sickness to bother him. This
was the Governor's belief himself in talk
ing about it not long ago. He grew better
for a time and was able to be out a day
now and then. Once he thought he would
be able soon to return to Nevada.
But a few apys ago he grew worse again.
The pallor of his countenance, which has
been noticed all along, increased, and he
took to his bed, where he now lies In a
critical condition.
Dr. J. 0. Hirschfelder and Dr. C. M.
Richter are in almost constant attendance.
Other physicians consulted with them in
the Governor's room yesterday. Mrs.
Jones is with the Governor, as she has
been all alon:.'. Strict orders have been
given to admit no one, so ill is the patient.
It is stated now that the ailment is can
cer of the stomach. Whatever it is it is
evident his case is serious. For a time
last night he was said to be very low.
There is much interest in his case among
the Nevada people now here and the many
others who know the Governor.
Governor Jones was the lirst State official
in Nevada in ISH2 to cast his future with
the shyer party when the fight began for
free coinage. He was Slate Surveyor-Gen
eral at the time, finishing his second term.
The silver party raised its standard in the
eastern part of the State, and a call was
made for supporters of the white metal
from all quarters. Governor Jones, who
had lived most of his life in Nevada, im
mediately announced that he was for free
coinage against any party, State or sec
tion; that it was the logical stand for Ne
vadans to take against the old parties, and
that lie wanted to be recognized as a mem
ber of the party that protected the State's
greatest product.
The result was that the silver party, at
the ensuing State Convention, nominated
him for Governor, and he was elected by
an overwhelming majority. The two old
parties (Republican and Democratic) were
buried in an avalanche of votes, and the
State capital was rilled with silver men.
Previous to that Mr. Jones had been a
Republican, but latterly put silver before
everything else, believing it to be the ulti
mate salvation of the Sagebrush State.
His record as a Governor has been of the
conservative and d^liherate order, and his
judgment on all State matters is consid-
Governor John E. Jones of Nevada.

ered safe and diplomatic at the same time.
His reputation lor honesty has been an
object lesson for younger politicians and
his promise? were never broken.
A remarkable thing about Governor
Jones is his practical knowledge of the
earlier training that make men capable
heads of a government.
A. B. FORBES EXPLAINS.
On Behalf of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company He Throws Light on the
Fhinney Appeal.
Agent A. B. Forbes of the Mutual Life
Insurance Company of New York makes
| an explanation which throws considerable
I light on the Phinney appeal according to
his point of view. The Phinney appeal
was mentioned by The Call yesterday. It
involves a verdict for $97,012 84 rendered
by the United States Circuit Court at Seat
tle, Wash., in favor of Mrs. Phinney ou a
$100,000 twenty-year policy.
His explanation is as follows:
The statement that the contention of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company is that the
premiums on a twenty-year contract must be
paid for the full period of twenty years, other
wise no insurance can be collected, is mislead
ing unless properly qualified, and is liable to
be much misunderstood.
In justice to the company I would like you
tossy for me that the obligation of the con
trnct between Guy C. Phinueyand our com
pany called simply for the payment of the
premiums for twenty years provided the policy
holder continued to live At the end of the
twenty years hr> would have gotten the full
amount of the $100,000.
This is the particular phaÂ«e of benefit which
we off er ana guarantee to policy-holders who
continue to live beyond the time limit. It
amounts simply to this: That, after paying
their premiums lor the time limit specified,
they pet the full amount of Insurance their
policy calls for without the element of death
enteritis? in at all. On the other hand, if a person
dies under such a contract, after paying only
one premium, the company pays the insur
ance just the same as if the policy-holder had
lived ami paid premiums for the full period of
the time limit.
The trouble in the Phinney case was that
Mr. Phinney did not have the money to pay
his second premium at the time it was due.
However, the company was willing to carry
Mr. Phinney, provided he did pay the second
premium within a reasonable time and could
present a clear certificate of health. When
our meaieal examiner, Dr. Eagleson. investi
gated his physical condition it was found that
he was a very sick man, and for this reason his
second premium was not accepted, lie hud
forfeited his first premium by not paying the
second on time; but worse than all ne'had be
come too unsafe a risk physically to warrant
the company in stretching any points in his
favor. We did the best thing a business insti
tution could ba expected to do, namely offer
to overlook his delinquency if he made it 'good
provided he could show that he was as healthy
a man as when originally insured.
Z An Overcoat Thief.
C. H. Foster, the sneakthief, who has re

and at the request of the prosecution tlie case
was continued till January 15. Detectives Bee
and Harper havo recovered eight or nineof the

The motion of Senator Lodge to have

there is any law on our statute-books that

interviews with anybody anywhere on any
subject of current interest, then that law
has been a dead letter ever since modern
journalism became alive.
A DELUSIVE SCHEME.
It seems to be taken for granted that a
funding scheme providing for a gradual
repayment by the aided railroads of the
debt which they owe the Government will
accomplish its purpose. The fact that the
railroads themselves desire such a meas
ure is a curious and significant thing. It
must be taken either to mean that the
companies all along have been earning
sufficient to have extinguished the debt,
or that, if they have not, they wish us to
believe that they can raise their tariffs suf
ficiently to produce the increased revenue
required.
If the first of these views be accepted,
then a funding bill would be a condone
ment and perpetuation of a swindle; for
if the companies have earned the money
and have withheld its use in the payment
of an honest debt they have robbed the
Government. In that case they would
deserve no consideration whatever, and
the roads themselves and their accumu
lated earnings, held by their owners as
private property, can be recovered if there
is any justice in the laws and courts of
this country.
If the other view be accepted, that the
companies have not earned sufficient to
pay the debt and will be compelled to in
crease their revenues by raising Iheir
tariffs, the question arises, To what extent
can they raise their charges without de
stroying their traffic and thus making the
payment of their debt impossible, and to
what extent have they the power to raise
their charges at all? An assumption that
they can raise them must mean that they
have the power as monopolies to do so, for
the announcement of such a power means
the absence of competition. Therefore a
funding scheme which contemplates a
raising of tariffs is a provision for encour
aging and perpetuating a monopoly. This
is infamous on its face.
The Southern Pacitic Company, in its
recent announcement of an intention to
advance its east-bound freight charges,
has proclaimed that it is just such a
monopoly and has the power in the ab
sence of competition to make such an
advance at will. Tnose who may regard
this as evidence of that company's ability
and intention to pay its Government debt
by raising its rates in the exercise of its
power as a monopoly" evidently deem the
payment of the debt a more important
matter than the effect which such a raise
would have in retarding the development
of the country and preventing the pros
perity of the people. It is worth while
further to cousider the policy of fostering
a power which experience has shown to be
so dangerous.
But suppose that this power to raise
rates to a point sufficient to cover the
amounts which must be paid to the Gov
ernment under the terms of a funding bill
does not really exist. In that event (if the
companies have not been withholding
earnings that the Government should have
received) it would be impossible for the
companies to pay their debt under a fund
ing scheme. In order to secure the neces
sary revenue from an advance of rates
they would have to put the rates above
a point at which the bulk of the traiiic
could be handled profitably round the
Horn. Our Traffic Association has pledged
itself to meet such a contingency. For
that matter such a raise would invite the
construction of a new competing overland
railroad, btill further, the Panama Rail
way might not be willing to serve as a tool
in such a scheme.
In short, a funding bill would be either
the condonement of a swindle, the perpet
uation of a monopoly, the saddling upon
our industries of a burden which they
could not bear, or a bald and naked sham
which would not secure the payment of
the debt. Those who advocate such a
measure may take their choice amonj;
these four propositions.
DESEEVED OENSUEE.
The Examiner, objecting to our criticism
on the administration for inviting sub
scriptions for 4 per cent bonds without
giving Congress a chance to authorize an
', issue of 3 per cents, calls it "undeserved
censure," and goes on to say:
"The Examiner finds it impossible to
call such a criticism candid. There i 3 no
! bond bill before the Senate. The meas
ure which passed the House as a bond
biil has been transformed by the Senate
Finance Committee into a free-coinage
bill, pure and simple, with no trace of
; bonds in it. It does not provide the means
j for the redemption of notes in anything,
even in silver. * * *
"In view of Mr. Cleveland's well-known
opinions with regard to such legislation as
this, we thinK that our contemporary, on
reflection, will agree with us that he could
hardly be expected to postpone any finan
cial operation he had in mind for the sake
of giving Congress time to present him
such a bill to veto."
In this statement the Examiner does not
give an accurate account of the facts. At
the time Carlisle issued his call foÂ» a 4 per
cent loan, tue Finance Committee had not
reported a silver bill to the Senate. It had
given notice during the previous week
that it would report on the bond bill at
the meeting of the Senate on Tuesday.
Carlisle forestalled this report by publish
ing his call for bonds on Monday morning,
and the Examiner can hardly be serious in
pleading in defense of his action some
thing that took place subsequent to the
i action itself.
Our contemporary i 3 further wrong in
assuming that the report of the silver bill
by a majority of the Finance Committee
disposes of the bond bill. The Senate has
still to act on the report. The bond bill
has not been killed by tne mere fact that
a majority of one in a committee voted
against it, and Cleveland cannot by the
action of the committee be exonerated
from the charge of having practicaliy
nullified the intent of the bill while it is
yet in the hands of Congress.
It must be borne in mind there was
nothing in the condition of the treasury
that compelled an immediate issue of
bonds. Carlisle's report showed money
enough on hand for current expenses,
there had been a surplus of revenues for
the month of December and the gold
reserve was considerably above the dan
ger limit. Moreover Cleveland had asked
Congress to remain in session during the
holidays to pass relief measures and Con
gress had done so. The proposed measure
of relief was in the hands of the Senate

A THIED-TEEM BOOM.
By his latest move to increase the public
debt, Cleveland has strengthened his
chances for a renomination in "two ways.
He lias given the money power added
reasons for desiring his re-election and by
making the chances of Democratic succefc's
more desperate than ever he has weakened
the ardor of any rivals likely 10 contest his
nomination in the convention.
History has many examples of leaders
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1896.
who have sought to rule or ruin, but
Cleveland is the only conspicuous one who
has sought to rule bis party by ruining it.
It is evident that if the Democratic party
were not hopelessly demoralized it would
no more think of renominating Cleveland
than of nominating Van Alen. In its
present condition, however, where is it to
txirn and what is it to do? No prominent
leader of the party cares to undertake the
forlorn hope of the coming campaign,
even if any were willin? to face the people
as an apologist for the Cleveland adminis
tration. It is evident, however, the party
must have a candidate or go to pieces.
The logic of the situation therefore is
either Cleveland or some candidate so ob
scure as to be practically nobody.
It ia clear that by making his policy dis
astrous to his party the President is mak
ing himself necessary to it. He can claim
in the convention the support of a power
ful class of money-lenders and mugwumps,
while no other candidate likely to oppose
him can show a strong support from any
class. It is a fact that at this time Democ
racy has not a single leader of National re
pute who is popular with the people or has
the confidence of any great number of in
telligent men. The Cleveland faction in
the party may be small, but it is stronger
than all other factions put together. It is
more than probable, therefore, the bond
business will have a marked effect upon
the politics as well as the finances of the
country, and that Cleveland will either get
a renomination or split the party in con
vention and send each faction off, as in
1860, to nominate a candidate of its own.
FAEMEES ON HAND.
The executive committee of the State
Grange has decided to take two important
steps. One is to ascertain whether and to
what extent certain commission merchants
have been making improper returns to
farmers, and the other is to seek to es
tablish a free market on the water front of
San Francisco.
A test case is to be maue in the matter
of a return made by a commission mer
chant to a country customer. It is charged
that he reported a Icps price than he re
ceived, and that this is a common practice
where single packages are handled. If, as
is assumed, this is embezzlement, it should
be prosecuted to the full limit of the law.
If it is not, it should be suppressed as a
manifest wrong. The grange is amply able
to handle the matter satisfactorily.
The establishment of a free maiket in
this City would be one of the best things
that the farmers could possibly do, but
there is a serious question as to whether
the water front is the best place. A large
proportion of the produce would be brought
in wagons owned by the farmers them
selves, und the only extra transportation
expense they would encounter would be
the ferry charge across the bay. When
this side is reached it would coa,t nothing
additional to drive the waeons to some
central part of the City, where they would
be easily accessible to a large number of
buyers.
If the water front be selected buyers will
have to pay carfare both ways and lose from
thirty minutes to an hour in travel. As
most of the purchases would be very small
there would be little or no saving in mak
ing the long trip to the water front, and so
tne market would largely fail of its pur
pose. It is not to be denied that the Mar
ket-street Railway would benefit by such a
selection.
The better plan would te to select the
streets surrounding one of the numer
ous public squares in the City, or
it might be possible to obtain the co
operation of the City, or of large capital
ists, and provide a free market on a scale
commensurate with the size and impor
tance of the metropolis. The proposed en
terprise is certainly one that affects the
people of the City as well as of the coun
try, and affords therefore a good ground
for the exertion of the combined efforts of
both in order to accomplish the best re
sults.
VENEZUELA'S ODD RAILWAY.
This is a scene on one of the most remarkable
railroads in tne world. It is the railroad be
tween Caraca3, the capital of Venezuela, and
its port, La Guayra. As the bird flies tne two
towns are only about six miles apart, out the
railroad that joins them is nearly twenty-four
miles lone. Caracas is in a deep valley, but it
is two-thirds of a mile nighcr than La Guayra,
and the mountains between them are nearly
9000 feet high.
So the railroad train, that never exceeds five
or six small and very light cars, winds along
the precipitous flanks of the mountains, puffs
nx> one side of the valley and down the other,
darts through short tunnels, and keeps up Its
The Caracas Railroad.
very sinuons way until finally the glorious
valley of the capital city bursts into view.
Then steam is shut off, Rnd the brakes are
applied, and slowly the train slips down the
inward face of the mountains to iis station in
the city.
The most charming and exhilarating vlaws
are revealed nt every stage of the journey; but
thin short trip is not one of the safest in the
world. We have not heard that nature has
ever bombarded a train with rocks from above,
Lut, says the New York Sun, this is a contin
gency that might happen. Sometimes during
violent storms rocks are detached from the
mass that towers above the roadbed and go
thumping down upon the track. During the
rainy season traffic has sometimes been inter
rupted for more than a week at a time by the
damage done in this way to the track. It' is a
great problem how to obviate this source of
dancer, and no solution has yet been found.
If England were to make war on Venezuela a
few hundred natives with crowbars for looeen
ing rocks, perched high above the track, could
make it very tough traveling for the enemy to
reach the capital by the railroad.
This great work of railroad engineering does
honor to the. energy and initiative talent of ex-
Presldent Guzman Blanco, who conceived the
project and carried it through to success. The
railroad was completed in 1883.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Captain George A. Raabe, the veteran cru
sader against the custom of uncovering the
head at funerals, is still laboring industriously
in his efforts to have religious and benevolent
societies abolish the old rule of removing the
hats while burying the dead.
Several years ago Captain Raabe began writ
ing letters to rhysieians, ministers, boards of
health and officials in the principal cities of
the United States, Europe and Australia. From
all these points he received favorable answers.
The physicians gave their unqualified approval
of the idea and the health boards without
exception recommended the adoption of the
rule of keening the head covered in the open
air upon sanitary grounds.
"You have no idea," said Captain Raabe
yesterday, "how easily people are converted
to this pet idea of mine. It takes only a few
words to convince my hearers that numerous
cases of sickness and death have resulted from
the custom of males removing their hats at
funerals and standing with their heads ex
posed during the long services at the grave.
Since I called the attention of the public to
this matter five years ago almost all the
societies in this City have passed resolutions
that the hat be not removed outside of the
hall. Many ministers of the churches have
promised to advocate the question before their
congregations, but some still cling to the old
custom. A number of times in my life I have
been called upon to act as pall-bearer, and
after walking alongside the hearse tor several
miles, and thereby becoming fatigued and
heated with my long march, was obliged to
stnnd bareheaded during a long interval
around tne grave. I passed through a Ions:
spell ot sickness from that needless exposure
and when I recovered I determined to do all in
my power to have the custom abolished.
"Everywhere I have met with encourage
ment in my endeavors. From Bodenhause, in
Germany, I learned thut my circulars had been
received, and, as a result, all the merchants
hÂ«d posted in their stores that customers wen
requested to keep their hats on while making
purchases. The ladies of Marienburg declared
themselves In favor of my proposition and an
nounced that they requested that gentlemen
should not lift their hats upon meeting them
in the street. The London Lancet, the highest
medical authority in the world, says that the
custom of standing uncovered at funerals,
with the head exposed to the chill air, la pro
ductive of diseases of the respiratory organs.
"The soldier, that highest, type of discipline,
never removes his hat at a funeral or at any
time when on duty. Why should the civilian
be forced to do so? The custom of uncovering
the head originated in ancient Rome, where
slaves were obliged to bare the head when
meeting a freeman to show which was the
slave. Why must we follow the old slavish
custom, especially as we are all freemen, and
particularly when it endangers health?"
Captain Raabe is a retired butcher and an
ex-president of the Butchers' Protective Asso
ciation of this City.

A Weak Commission.

It strikes us that the Venezuelan Commission

Taxing Foreigners.
Stockton Independent.
There is considerable of what is called
Americanism in the Transvaal. The people
there believe in making those who get the
cream of the wealth in the country pay the
Government's expenses. They, therefore,
make transient gold and diamond miners pay
about all the revenues. The amount is but a
trifle compared with what the "outlanders"
carry away with them. It would be a good
plan to pursue in the United States. If those
who come only to acquire wealth and take it
back to their foreign homes were taxed more
heavily than citizens there would be less of a
drain upon the country's money.
Never "Wanted to Arbitrate.

Great Britain does not want to arbitrate in

she seized Aden from a weak State on a flimsy
pretext, nor when she pocketed Mauritius by
a snow of power, nor when she stole Trinidad,
nor when, by deliberate aggression, subsidizing
companies and compulsory annexation she ac
quired the best parts of Africa, nor when she
eayitured Jamaica, nor when she wrested
Ceylon from the helpless Dutch, nor when she
grabbed the Ascension Island, nor when by
conquest she took in British Burmah, Berbice,
Borneo, Hongkong, Heligoland, Gozo and St.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The first week's performances show that the
success of Johann Strauss' new operetta
"Waldmeister" (Asperula) is much greater
than that achieved by his last work, "The
Apple Feast." The Viennese critics find that,
in spite of a rather weak libretto, "Wald
meister" recalls the freshness and originality
ot Strauss' early and his best operetta, "Die
Fledermaus" (generally known in this country
by its original title of "La Tzigane"). For the
first three Derformances of "Waldmeister" the
old master directed the overture himself, after
which he passed the baton to the regular chef

strong enough to stand the strain of directing
the whole performance. Strauss' friends say
that he is already preparing another opera.
He is 71 years of age, and gives every promise
oi retaining as perennial an activity as the
octogenarian Verdi. The critics are beginning
to suggest that, as Verdi wrote a comic opera â
"Falstaff"â at the age of 80, it is not improb
able that when Strauss reaches the same age
he may be ready to come before the public
with a new departure in the shape of an opera
seria.
Le Menestrel tells an amusing story of the
late General .-fir Henry Ponaonby, who was for
many years Queen Victoria's private secretary.
The general was noted for his politeness, and
whenever an artist performed at court he
always telegraphed the following day to
inquire after the performer's health. If a com
plete troupe performed at the castle the general
employed a formula, always the same, which
included the various members of the company.
A short time ago Rogers Prat was sent for to
court to exhibit his educated geese before
Queen Victoria's grandchildren. The day fol
lowing the ''artist" received the traditional
telegram from General Ponsonby, written in
the following immutable terms; "Her gracious
Majesty would be delighted to know if the
members of your troupe are veil and if. they
have had an agreeable journey. For my own
part I beg you to convey to them the expres
sion of my esteem." It is not stated whether
the educated geese replied to the general's
polite message.
Few singers have been more "boomed" dur

localities where Miss Yaw has most loved to
tour, have indorsed her with all the superla
tive adjectives in their verbal repertory. The
Incense offered by these rural critics has ap
peared, along with Miss Yaw's portrait, in
numerous music journals, ajid the public has
frequently marveled why such a phenomenal
diva should prefer the homage of Houston and
San Antonio to the adulation of New York,
Paris and London. It is now announced that
Miss Yaw intends to tour through the princi
pal cities of the Union, so that the public will
at last discover whether she is indeed the most
phenomenal singer of the age or whether she
only has au exceptionally clever press agent.
There is a visible falling off of interest in the
opera performances at the Metropolitan this
winter in New York. The public does not

it come forth, shows no enjoyment in the per
formance. Even Meiba, who was stormed on
her first appearance this season with the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra, met with no explo
sive greeting at her operatic debut in "Romeo
and Juliet," whereby the diva was grumpy,
and when 6he really was applauded for the
waltz song she surveyed the passive expres
sionless lines of boxes, which used to lose their
sanity for her, with a glance which meant,

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Successful Trial Trip of the Tank
Oil Steamer George
Loomis.
ACCIDENTS ON THE BOSTON.
River Steamers Delayed on Account
of the Low Waters of the
. San Joaquin.
The tank steamer George Loomis had
her trial trip on the bay yesterday and it
proved a genuine success. Oil was used as
fuel and ir generated more steam than the
engines could use.
As the steamer is to carry oil between
Ventura and here the insurance men are
naturally interested in her, so the follow
ing went out on the trial trip: Captain
Bruce of the Fireman's Fund, A. Watson
acd E. Alexander of the Canton, Captain
Reid of the New Zealand, H. Durbraw of
La Foncier and Fred Butler of the West
ern i Companies. Captain J. 11.
Metcalf of Lloyds, who supervised the con
st ruction cf the vessel; Ex-Senator Charles
Felton, wno is interested in the oil wells,
and Morris Bates of the Commercial News
were also present.
lUr George Loomis is 175 feet long. 27
feet 6 inches broad and 17 feet deep. Her
gross tonnace is 691, while her net is only
402 tons. Her tanks are all amidship and
divided into six compartments. Coffer
dams are placed at each end of tho tanks
so as to obviate any possibility of danger.
The arrangements are Mich that the \
can be loaded and unloaded in sixteen
hours. She can carry 8000 barrels of oil
and her average speed will be about nine
knots. The insurance men were well
pleased with the trial ol the vessel.
There was a chapter of accidents on the
United States cruiser Boston yesterday.
Three men were over the side touching up
the paint when one of them partly lost his
hold, and in efforts to save himself tipped
himself and companions into the bay.
A Doat was immediately called away, but
in the hurry and excitement another acci
dent happened. One of the davits fell, and
in doing so struck Edward Launders to tiie
deck, breaking his leg just above the knee.
Another boat was ordered away and the
men were rescued.
Launtiers was taken to the sick bay,
where his leg was set, after which lie u;;3
brought ashore and sent to the>farelsl
and Hospital on ths steamer Monticello.
Launders' ies* is very badly broken and
the chances are that he will be a cripple
for life. The Boston has only just pot out
of the drydock, after a thorough overhaul
ing. Just how her davits came to be
o at of order when they were most needed
is therefore a mystery*
The tian Joaquin River is lower than it
has been for years and the steamer cap
tains find it almost impossible to make
time. If they do not stick atone point
they do at another, and when San Fran
cisco i.~ reached the vessel is generally sev
eral hours late. Yesterday it was noon
before the Dauntless got in" and the J. D.
Peters was twelve hours later. The latter
stuck at Croziers Landing, which is only a
short distance from Stockton, so many of
the passengers got ashore and walked back
to the town. They then came on to the
â¢ 'ity by train. At 3 p. m. yesterday the
Peters had only reached Boukien [aland,
so it will be midnight before she gets in.
As there was no steamer of the Califor
nia Navigation and Improvement Com
pany on hand to take the place of the J.
D. Peters the opposition had it all its own
way. The Dauntless went out crowded,
even though quite a number of people pre
ferred to await the Peters. Those who
came down on the latter steamer were well
treated by the company.
Freight carriers for coal are scarce and
consequently charters have advanced 5
cents a ton. Th<; first to secure the ad
vance is the American shij> Levi S. Bur
gess. A number of other ships are being
negotiated for and the chances are that
tho advance rate will rule between here
and the Puget Sound coal mines for the
remainder of the winter.
The British ship City of Florence arrived
at Antwerp yesterday after a very lone
passage. She" left Vancouver. R. C. July
it last, and at one time 9 per cent reinsur
ance was raid on her. The gamblers are
therefore happy over her safe arrival.
The British thip Hollinwood from New
castle, N. S. W., for San Francisco will
have to discharge her cargo. About a
week ago she put into Lyttieton, New
Zealand, with lier cargo heated. Since
then lire has broken out, so the coal will
have to be unloaded to save the ship.
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
American ship Elwell. Bixty-seven days
from Newcastle, N. S. W. When here last
the Elwell was sold to W. Miles and added
to his fleet, composed of the Wilna, Gen
eral Fairchild and others. The chances
are that she will be put in the coasting
trade.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Mexico will only make another trip
to San Diego. On the 18th inst. she
will be succeeded by the Corona, and then
go into retirement at Sausalito.
Owing to the large quantity of freight
offering at the $1 a ton rate the steamer
South Coast will not be able to get away
until to-morrow at 2p. m. On her way to
Portland the will call at Humboldt Bay,
Coos Bay and Astoria. In connection
with this Oregon fight the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company's George W.
Eider left Portland yesterday. She has a
full cargo, the greater portion of which is
oil.
The barkentine Modoc, winch bad such
a rough experience on her trip to San
Francisco, has lost her Shanghai charter.
The repairs to her hull and topharupe,r
wiil take so long that the charterers could
not wait for her. She will accordingly go
to Port Elakeley and load lumber for
Guaymas. While the barkenline was on
her way here Captain Munson, late of the
schooner Annie Lee, bought a live-six
teenths interest in her, and will go out as
master, Captain Uoesch retiring. Munson
is very much chagrined over the fact that
he will have to pay his share of the re
pairs over and above the $3000 he paid for
his interest.
Captain Waliis of the steamer Walla
Walla will not be seen on his tine vessel
for several trips to come. He has been
selected by the California Harbor of
Master Mariners to represent them at the
annual conference of the harbors in the
United States, to be held in the East next
month. Captain Waliis will take his
vessel to the Sound, and from Seattle he
will go overland via the Northern Pacific.
Captain Carrol, who is now in Alaska, will
eventually assume temporary command,
but, as lie may not be ab.'e to join the
steamer on the Hound, Captain Gage, one
of the Port Wardens, will go up with Cap
tain Waliis, and, if necessary, bring the
Walla Walla back to San Francisco. Cap
tain Waliis is one of the most popular
masters sailing in and out of this port, and
he will be missed even during his short
sojourn in the East.
The steamer Washtenaw of the Panama
Railway line is not expected here before the
Ist of next month. Strange to say, she is
calling at all the way ports, and is said to
be loading freight for tho Pacihc Mail. As
the hatchet is now buried, the railroad
company probably thinks there is no harm
in earning an honest penny by means of
the steamer.
AN OFFICER LOST AT SEA.
Washed Overboard From the Rod

Gale-Many Ships Arrive.
The British ship Roderick Dhn, Captain
Howe, arrived last night, 150 days from
Liverpool. In the Atlantic she crossed
the equator September 20, forty days|out,

in longitude 27 deg. west. From latitude
30 deg. south, longitude 40 dog. west, to
latitude 40 deg. south, longitude r>2 deg.
west, for twelve days she had a succession
of furious gales from tho southwest with a
high sea. The ship rolled heavily, shift
ing the cargo between decks, which gave
the vessel a heavy list.
The seas, having a clean sweep against
the submerged bulwarks, damaged them
considerably. The deckhouses were badly
battered by the great waves that incen
saritly broke over them.
The high gales continued clear around
Cape Horn, with thick and exceedingly
cold weather and blinding storms of snow.
On October 28 the Roderick Dhu su-hted
several large icebergs about live miles to
the southward and a number of pieces of
ice awash floating near the ship.
October 30 another furious gale broke
over the ship with tremendous seas. While
the vessel was labonng heavily Second
Officer Gerald Rcott Coney lost bis footing
on the poopdeck and in "an instant was
washed overboard. He was dashed up un
der the ship's counter and apparently had
been injured by striking against the hull.
Lines and a lifebuoy were thrown to him,
but he appeared to be unable to help him
self.
The hapless man was dashed here and
there in tho broken water around the
vessel's counter, every effort being made
for his rescue. Although it was extremely
improbable that a boat could live in that
sea, an attempt was made to launch one
of the cutters. The wild pitching of the
ship made this impossible, ana before the
boat was cut loose from ihe slings, a
heavier aea than usual broke over the
vessel and the unfortunate officer, and he
was seen no more.
He was a native of Warwickshire, Eng
land, aged 20 years, and a member of the
Royal Naval Keserve.
The remainder of the voyage was a suc
cession of fresh gales and light airs.

O'BRIEN ON TRIAL.
The Ex-Tax Collector Appears In. Court
With Jf is ISookÂ«.
The case against Thomas O'Brien, the
Tax Collector, to compel him to account
fora shortage of ?5828 74, was before Judge
Dougherty of Santa Rosa yesterday.
Judge Daingerfield has changed benches
with Judge Dougherty in order to try a
case in which Judge Dougherty is disquali
fied.
The day was consumed in taking testi
mony on the method of keeping the books
in the Tax Collector's office and in tracing
various items from the original payment
by the taxpayer through the hands of the
clerks and into the treasury. The plea of
the defense was that in the system of entry
and checking off many items were marked
paid which, in fact, were never paid, and
as a consequence the amount of money
turned in for the fiscal year of 1892 and
1893 was less by $5828 74 than the amount
the books cailed for, although it did rep
resent the actual amount received.
Three of the Tax Collector's books were
lost during O'Brien's administration, and
this will complicate matters a good deal,
but before the trial is over the court will
have canvassed every item of the year in
which the shortage appeared.
Lust of an Old Company.
J. B. Haggin, Lloyd Tevis and Henry Wads
worth, stockholders of the dissolved c^an Fran
cisco and Point hobos Road Company, have
petitioned the Superior Court for permission
to divide the proceeds of the sale of the com
pany's property among the shareholders. The
land belonging to the company sold for $34 -
--4'2S, and after all expenses and outstanding
claims had been satisfied, there was left $25 -
013 57. This the petitioners wished distrib
uted.
The picture and framing department of San
born, Vail & i'o. were big busy stores in them
selves during December. Medallion pictures,
line photographs ot the latest paintings, new
moldings and pretty frames for card, cabinet
and boudoir pictures were admired by all. The
stock of these xood.s will be kept complete dur

MISS WALDROP TO SUE
She Cannot Get Her Claim Set
tled, She Says, in Any
Other Way.
VICTIM OF A STREETCAR.
Byron Waters' Corrugated Brow and
Severe Words When the Young
Lady Called on Him.
Whether the Southern Pacific Company
will settle an obligation which Miss Oza
Waldrop of Healdsburg and her friends
say is due her is a matter which the
young lady has for some time been wait
ing to see.
Now she has engaged a lawyer.
She was hurt December 12 last by a
Powell-street car at the junction of Powell
and Pine streets. Besides this, and
owing to the injury, she lost her position,
which she had secured after much effort,
with the Golden Rule Bazaar.
Hincc then she has been under continued
expense. Her board and doctor's bills
have been running up, and she cannot
again get a position. So it is very hard,
and the future looks dark for the young
girl, whose parents reside in Healdsburg.
They are not wealthy.
Miss Waldrop is quite prepossessing,
and but 19 years old. She has brothers,
but they are all small.
Byron Waters, the attorney for the
claims department of the Southern Pacific,
looked his savagest when the girl went
into his otlice a day or two ago and re
counted her injury and the trouble that
nad followed. His brow grew corrugated
and he really seemed to feel that if he
made compensation for the injury which
tne ' lady told she had sustained the
Southern Pacific would be in the hands
of a receiver and Mr. HuntingtOD have to
move out of his new marble mansion.
It was a very cloudy day indeed for Mr.
Water?, according to all accounts. There
was not a rift in the lute.
"He told me." said Miss Waldrop, who
is now at the American Exchange Hotel,
"that he didn't believe I was hurt at all;
that I was just trying to make him and
other people believe I was.
"I was hurt though, and very bad. This
scar over my eye, where I fell, has healed,
but my back, which was wrenched severely,
still hurts me. I went to the Southern
Pacific people to see what they would do.
"I came up from my home in Healds
burg, because I had to do something to
maintain myself. After much effort, I
finally got this position with the Golden
Rule Bazaar.
"On December 12, after I had secured it

started to take a Powell-street car from
Pine. As I arrived at the junction there
was no car in sight, and I waited. It was
9:4") a. m. Car 405 phot down the hill
toward me, stopped, and I got on.
"That is, I got one foot on when the car
started, and I was knocked off and dragged
several feet. I was very severely bruised,
being hurt so much that I could not take
my position, and had to put myself under
a doctor's care. Since I have got better I
cannot get a position.
"L must do something. It is very neces
sary.
"I didn't know at first that any one
would come forward and sustain me in my
statements to the Southern Pacific Com
pany, a3 aeainst what the conductor said,
but in the last day or two five or six per
sons, most of the passengers on the car,
have come to me and offered to be wit
nesses for me.
"One of them just left here a few mo

"All these witnesses know the circum
stances of my being hurt, and that it was
owing to the carelessness of the employes.

it appears now, I will be forced to bring. JI

THE KING ESTATE.
A Complication of Contests Seeing to Be
Impending.
Public Administrator Freese has applied
for letters of administration over the estate
of Cornelius King, who died in an insane
asylum leaving .$250,000. By his will the
property was bequeathed to the children
of his deceased brother, but a contest was
begun by some of his step-brothers and
step-sisters in Ireland. They aliened in
sanity as a cause for setting aside the will,
although it was executed lour years before
Kinj; died.
James B. Fargo, the former administra
tor of ttie King estate, died last Sunday,
ami since then" the heirs under the will,
Daniel and Charles King, have petitioned
for letters of administration. The con
testing heirs are opposing this, and so the
put>lic administrator's petition has fol
lowed.
THE FEE BILL OF 1895
Proceedings Instituted to Test
the Application of
the Act.
Peremptory Writ cf Mandate to Compel
County Clerk Curry to File
Certain Papers.
The right under the law for the County
Clerk to exact certain fees for the filing of
papers, as provided lor in what is known
as the fee bill of 1895, will soon be finally
determined.
In a proceeding entitled Henry Miller,
Bernard Horn, diaries E. Chipman, J. G.
James Si Co. and 11. A. Jones vs. Charles
P. Curry, County-Clerk, it is set forth that
on October 31, 1895, in an action pending
in which J>, J. Tally was plaintiff and
the present plaintiffs were defendant.--, the
present plaintiffs delivered to County
Clerk Curry on that day an answer, and
THE LATE CAPTAIN LEVI HANNAH, ONE OF THE BEST - KNOWN AND
BEST â¢ LIKED MASTERS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.
[From a photograph.]
demanded its riling. Prior to that time
they had not filed any papers in the case.
The County Clerk refused to receive and
file the paper unless a tee of $2 was paid.
Plaintiffs refused to pay the fee, and the
paper has nor been filed.
It is contended that it was the duty of
the County Clerk to lile the paper, as the
law prescribed no fee for the filing, and
that no had no authority of Jaw for de
manding a fee. The plaintiffs therefore
ask for a peremptory writ of mandate to
compel County Clerk Curry to tile the
paper.
Argument will be heard next Friday be
fore Judge Seawcll, Department 1 of the
Superior Court. It is contended by the
plaintiffs that the act of ISfJtJ fixing the
fees of County Clerks is still in forÂ©
cept as affected by amendments of 1893
and 1895. The plaintiffs hold that tne law
of 1893 is unconstitutional, and therefore
the main question to be decided is whether
the act of 18t>0 is repealed by the act of
1895. The court will be called upon to
construe the meaning of the constitution
in its reference to counties and cities and
counties.
It is understood that Mr. Curry, the
County Clerk, will not interpose technical
objections, but will consent, through his
counsel, Messrs. Delmas <fc Shortridge. to a
full submission of the cause, to the end
that the controversy may be settled once
and for all.
The County Clerk was advised by the
City and County Attorney that he (Curry)
had no power to pas* upon the constitu
tionality of the act of 189") ; but, on the con
trary, it was his duty to be guided by that
law until otherwise directed by the court.
For the convenience of lawyers and liti
gants, and for the knowledge to guide him
to the proper conduct of the affairs of the
oftice of County Clerk, Mr. Curry desires
that all the points in dispute shall be adju
dicated.

CAPTAIN HANNAH DEAD.
Served Goodall, Perkins & Co.
Almost Continuously for
Twenty-Five Years.
NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT.
He Was a Skillful Navigator and Very
Popular With the Traveling
Public.
Captain Levi Hannah passed away at his
residence, 22(i>Â£ Oak street, at an early
hour yesterday morning. He was one of
the best known and most popular masters
on the Pacific Coast, and he was about the i
only one of whom it could be said that
during his twenty-five years of continual
command in all classes of vessels he never
had an accident.
During his busy life he was master of
vessels in the Alaska and Puget Sound
trade, and ran to every port between Flat
tery and San Francisco. On the southern j
coast he several times took vessels to the
Gulf of California and Mexican ports, and
he knew every bay and inlet from San
Diego up thoroughly. He was a great
favorite with the traveling public, and
any one who once made a passage with
him was eager for another. When Goodall.
Perkins & Co. started running an excur- i
sion steamer to Santa Cruz and Monterey
the steamer Pomona, with Captain Han
nah in command, was chosen for the route.
The venture was a Buccess, and they have
been continued yearly over since.
In the year 1870 Captain Hannah was in
command of Davis & Cowell's schooner
Albert Adams, running in the Santa Cruz |
trade. Lime nearly always formed her i
1 cargo, and there was considerable opposi-
I tion even in those days. Goodall, Nelson
I & Perkins purchased the steamer Liberty
| and offered the command to Hannah, and
he accepted. From that time dated his
connection with the rirni now so well \
known as Goodall, Perkins & Co.
While he was master of the Fidelity the I
United States Government decided to blow i
up Noonday Bock. A jjoud steamer and a
competent man were required to do the '.
j work, and after looking around Hannah
was selected. He blew up the rock with
dynamite ana made an excellent job
of it. "While successful in this in-
Btance, on another occasion the cap- j
tain nearly lost his life by dynamite.
He â was a j avenger on an excursion
steamer that had gone out to the Catalina
Islands. The master of the vessel wanted j
' to show how many fLsh could be killed by i
a discharge of dynamite. He lit the fnse
and prepared to throw the stick into the
water, when it fell out of his hand into
the cabin. The result was a big hole in
her stern and the narrow escape of all on
board.
After leaving the Fidelity Captain Han
nah was in command at different times of
the steamers Eureka, Gypsy, Los Angeles,
Alexander Duncan, Newport (now a
whaler), Senator (now a hulk in Auckland,
N. Z.) and latterly the I'omona. iie was
55 years of age, and leaves a widow and
family. At one time he lived at Santa
Cruz, and he owns some property there.
The funeral service will take place this
morning and the remains will then be
taken to Santa Cruz for interment. The
pall-ljearers will be selected from among
the oldest employes of the Pacilic Coast
Steamship Company.
All the flags along the front, were at half
mast out of rospect to the memory of the
deceased master, and all the vessels of the
fleet will go out with them at halfmast to
morrow.
TRACKING THE FORGER.
Did Dma Register at the Falace Hotel
on December 7 ?
So far as the police are concerned there
arc no new developments in regard to the
big forgery by A. H. Dean on the Nevada
Bank. Captain Lees is keeping the wires
busy, but whether he has got any trace of
the clever forger he will not say.
The forger had seventeen da>'9' clear
start, and by that time he could have
traveled by land and sea to the European
continent if he went in that direction.
On December 7 "Tom 11. Dean, Chicago,"
registered at the Palace Hotel. The hand
writing is larpe and flowing like the "A.
H. Dean" on the forged draft, and last
night Captain Lees ana Detective Seymour
took a tracing of the signatare from the
hotel register.
Detective Seymour said they were not
searching the register with that object, as
Dean had stopped at the Occidental Hotel
winie in the City, but it was significant
that they took a tracing of the Dean signa
ture.
Wheatstone, in K.i, calculated the velo
city of electricity to be 570,000 feet a sec

MISS OVERMAN IS WRITING A STATEMENT
Intimates That She Has a
Great Surprise in
Store.
DISLIKES MRS. DAVIDSON
The Deacons Unanimously Decide
to Stand by the Rev.
Dr. Brown.
THE AGED PRISONER'S RECORD.
Mrs. Tunnell Still Among the Missing.
It Is Denied That She Is in
Kings County.
Miss Overman, accused by Mrs. David
son of improper relations with D.-. Brown,
continues to preserve, in a measure p.t
least, that discreet silence which has char
acterized her course since she became an
inmate of th past* r"s home.
Heretofore she has occasionally burst
the chains which apparently surround
her, though this, has only been to deny in
a general way the many compromising
things that have been said about her. Oa
the one matter, however, in which she is
inÂ«.st keenly interested she has maintained
a most sphinx-like silence.
With a view of securing an admission or
denial relative to the genuineness of the
now famou? "Tunnell letters," as pub
lished in The Call, a reporter called on
her yesterday at Dr. Brown's home, where
she continues to reside. The young lady
was cautious, cool and calculating in every
thing she said. Only once did she prow
excited, and that was when the name of
Mrs. Davidson was mentioned.
"Miss Overman, are you prepared to
make any statement concerning the letters
published yesterday over your signature
and addressed to Mrs. Tunnel!?' was
asked.
"I am not," replied Miss Overman.
"My attorneys wil! not allow me to dis
cuss the matter with outsiders."
"Will you say that you did not write
them? "
"I am not prepared to say anything
about them at all, and, what is more, I
will not. At the proper time, however, ]
will give a statement 'to the public which
will show there are two sides to every
situation. I can only repeat what I have
said before, and that is I have been hor
ribly misrepresented and misquoted since
the beginning of this dreadful affair.
And to think, too. it is all on account of a
design: ng old woman. She posed as a
Christian, yet see what she has done â
brought disgrace on everybody with whom
Bhecamein contact. But I must not dis
cuss this matter. At the proper time I
will tell my story and then leave it for the
public to determine whether I or the
woman on trial for blackmail has toid
the truth."
Miss Overman shows plainly the severe
mental strain which she has undergone
during the pa?t two weeks, fche has a
troubled weary look, that is only relieved
when her face lights up with anger or
hatred. A pparently she is deiiant of pub
lic opinion, though on the other hand she
avows her intention of catering to that
wavering quantity l> at the proper time."
Dr. Brown continues to deny himself to
all visitors, except those directly inter
ested in the case. He said yesterday that
in a few days he would probably make a
statement, but would do nothing in that
direction until after the preliminary hear
ing of the Davidson extortion suit. He is
reasonably cheerful under the heavy strain,
and is confident that the end wiil prove
him free of any wrongdoing.
Mrs. T:.nnell seems to be almost as
elusive as Mrs. Baddin. One day she is in
Oakland, and the next two or three hun
dred miles away. The only absolutely
certain thing about her is that she is in
biding.
Yesterday a telegram was received from
Grangeviile, where it -was reported she
had gone, stating that Mrs. Tunnell was
not there, neither was she known. Mrs.
Horton, 216 Eddy street, declares posi
tively she is there, though she declines to
go into details as to how she secured the
information, except that it came by letter.
"My mother, Mrs. Hayes, lives at
Grangevilie." said Mrs. Horton yesterday,
"and as she and Mrs. Tunnell are quite old
friends, there is no reason why she should
not go there. I can say positively that
she is at my mother's, though I must de
cline to tell how or when I received my
information. It is straight, and that is all
there is to it."
It may be interesting to relate in this
connection that Mrs. Tunnell Jeft Dr.
Brown's house at 11 :30 o'clock on the Sun
day night following the arrest of Mrs.
Davidson. She went direct to the ferry,
reaching there in time to catch the last
boat for Oakland.
Mrs. Davidson continues to evidence a
calm and conlident front. She has not the
tightest fear of the final result, though
â he anticipates a favorable verdict in the
preliminary hearing. She says:
"I have been a Christian for too long to
attempt now to shield myself behind a
tissue of falsehoods. Ail this scandal,
though it is true every word of it, is due to
Dr. Brown, and now he must bear the
consequences of his own rashness."
The deacons and trustees, at a private
meeting beld last night, decided to uphold
Dr. Brown, at least until the Davidson
case ended. They considered it would not
be fair to the pastor or the church to pass
judgment at this time, or even demand an
explanation from Dr. Brown.
The dispatches from Hanford and
Tulare add greater mystery to the already
mysterious movements of Mrs. Tunnell.
There now seems little doubt but that the
important witness is in Kirps County,
though she is carefully concealed by her
friends.
The preliminary hearing of Mrs. David-
son will be resumed before Judge Camp
bell this afternoon at 1 o'clock.
THE DEACONS CONFER.
They Believe Dr. Brown Innocent
and Will Stand by
Him.
After Dr. Brown had received the profuse
congratulation and assurance of his
parishioners ti.at they regarded him as an
upright and innocent man, the deacons of
the church, who had previously arranged
for the meeting, congregated in the upper
study of their pastor, and locked tneru
seives in securely from the outer world,
leaving a numberof anxious and solicitous
friends downstairs waiting to hear the re
sult of the conference.
Those who remained in waiting for
what they supposed would be a verdict
Lad to content themselves with looking
up at the light that struggled through the
blinds from the interior, and many specu
lations were indulged in regarding the
ultimate conclusion of the pillars of the
Congregational church. The anxious ones
wandered around chatting and drawing
conclusions from the evidence that has
appeared in the daily papers of this City.
Suddenly the light went out and there
was a general scramble for the side en
trance, which Mrs. Brown had taken the
precaution to lock after the main body of
the participants in the prayer - meeting
had tiled out previous to the adjournment
of the deacons to the rector's study.
In a moment the deacons came down
stairs, headed by J. J. Yasconeellos, who
was getting down to the ground Hoor at
the rate of three steps at a time. His face
bore the happiest expression, and Dr.
Brown, who followed him, was beaming:
over with contentment. He immediateiy
came to Mrs. Brown's side, took her arm.
pressed it to his side affectionately, and
left the building before his supporters had
all reached the floor from the staircase.
All of these gentlemen showed by their
bearing that something pleasing had oc
curred, and they acted more like a holiday
party than a body of men holding a
session over the scandal that burdens their
minister. It is probable that no more con
tented people ever came from a deacons'
meeting in that house of worship.
They departed from the church indif
ferent directions, and all were ebullient
with joy.
"I have nothing to say of what oc
curred," said Deacon Dexter when ap
proached regarding the result of the meet
ing, "and 1 do not care to discuss it. I
am a good-natured man, and that is the
reason of my apparent happiness. lam
always this way. I car.'t help being good
natured. Yes, it is true that we have great
faith in Dr. Brown, and we will stand by
him to the very last.''
"Did the matter of prime interest in the
doctor's reputation come up, and were
Mrs. Davidson's charges discussed in any
way?"'
"No. Not in the slightest. I hope you
will excuse me. my good and Christian
brother, I cannot talk to you of this mat
ter. We did nothing. We believe in Dr.
Brown. I hope you will permit me to bid
you pood-night." With that Deacon Dex
ter extended his hand and disappeared
down Mason street.
Deacon Vasconcellos was inclined to be a
little more talkative than his associate.
He had gone up to the corner of Post
street with Dr. Brown to chat with the
minister, but was met coming back toward
Market.
"We didn't say a word about this scan
dal in the meeting. I: does not justify
any comment. Dr. Brown, is a persecuted
and maiiened man and the law must take
its course. We can do nothing until the
trial is over."
"What will you do then?"
"There will'be nothing to do. He will
be proven innocent and he will then proba
bly explain the whole matter as he said
to-night in his address at the prayer meet
ing. Not a single member of the Congre
gational church believes him guilty of
these slanders heaped upon him by bad
people. He is upright and holy, and with
the help of God and his own "strong will
he will prove it."
"Did not the deacons express confidence
in him at the meeting to-night?' 1
â¢We have always believed in him and
always will. Did you not see the way ail
received him 0 "
"The doctor appears to be in a very
happy frame of mind."
"Yes, he knows we have faith in him,
and that every member of the church
loves him as a righteous man. How ter
rible it is to have such vile Bla;iders put
upon such a conscientious Christian !
But he is innocentâ he is innocent, and in
time he will rise from the whole affair and
show his troodness. : "
J. EL Hatch said that the sentiment of
the meeting was to stand by Dr. Brown.
He said that no action would be taken
relative to an investieation or a church
trial at present.
J. H. Barnard would not discuss the
matter at all. The other deacons were
equally reticent.
HER EASTERN RECORD.
Captain Lees Receives Information
Regarding Mrs. Davidson's Con-
victlon and Sentence.
Captain Lees yesterday received a letter
from Chief Inspector W. B. Walls of Bos
ton, Mass., inclosing copy of the papers in
the case of the People of the State of!
Massachusetts against Mary A. Davidson.
The papers show that Mrs. Davidson

DR. BROWN PRESiDED.
Prayer Meeting at the Firs' Con
gregational Church and Sym
pathy for the Pastor.
Dr. Brown was the central fieure at the
regular weekly prayer-meeting in the
classroom of the First Congregational
Church last nipht. There was a large at
tendance. The doctor presided over the
meeting. He looked pe.le and careworn.
But there was still the old-time ring in his
voice.
Hymns were sung and prayers were of
fered up.
Deacon Yascon?el)os was the only perÂ«on
present with the courage to speak of the
I Brown-Davidson scandal. He exhorted
: his listeners to withhold their judgment
; until thÂ«-ir pastor saw Jit to make a public
statement.
"There la no doubt a great deal of
i anxiety and query in the hearts of those
! members of the church who are here to
j nielit,' 1 said the deacon, "re-rardinc the
reports which have appeared in th*Â» papers
, lately, and which, you all know, reflect on
! our pastor. These reports have, been the
talk of the street?. You have all beer.
I inquiring about them.
'-Some wise heads have paid that Dr.
Brown 'should make a confession.' So far
; as 1 am concerned. I want to say that I
I have confidence in Dr. Brown. Anyway,
he is not on trial. No charge has been'made
; against him before the tribunal of this
: church; he has not been tried by its
i officers.
"I want to say that if a pastor ever
needed the support of his people Dr.
Brown needs it at this time. The church
and people should uphold him. We are
all human and liable to fall; but I don't
know that Dr. Brown has fallen; but Ido
know that if Dr. Brown has fallen God
knows it. The will of God will be done.
Now is the time we should show our
Christian kindness and feeling;." â¢
Dr. Brown seemed greatly pleased at
what Deacon Vasconcellos had said. He
made a short address to the meeting, but
was silent on the charges that had turned
the tide against him. He read two letters
from former congregations he had served,
Showing that the people to whose spirit
ual welfare he had administered were still
unshaken in their belief of his innocence.
"I cannot tell you," began Dr. Brown
how great my desire is to talk to you
about this matter. I can assure you that
I want to talk to you more than you want
to hear me, but my attorneys 'have ad
vised me to remain silent. They are wise
men, and I must obey them. " I confess
that my desire has often been to break
away from them and tell you my sine.
\Y hen I get their consent I will then break
my silence.
"I have the right to take you into ray
confidence to say that I have received let
ters irom twenty different States since
this trouble began. They came from the
-North, East and the West. Two of them
are of such a nature that I will read them
to you. They are from churches that I
served in the past."
The letters referred to were from the
First Congregational Church of Tacoma,
Wash., and from a church in Kalama
zoo, Mich., both of which Dr. Brown
served as pastor. The doctor entered the
iiitant class of the latter church, grew up
in it and finally became its pastor.
The Tacoma letter was signed by Messrs.
Hallock ana Merrill, trustees of "the First
Congregational Church. It was in the
form of a resolution and read as follows:
WHXRKAB, Our beloved friend and former
pastor, the Rev. lÂ»r. C. O. Brown, has been
made ihe victim of an evil and designing
woman, therefore belt
Reiolvid, Thai we still firmly believe in his
Christian integrity and faith.
The resolution was passed by the trus
tees of the congregation. The Kalnmazoo
letter was from L.' M. Gates, president of
the local hank of the town and a leading
member of Dr. Brown's old church. Dr.
Brown explained that Mr. Gates was the
only member of the church he ever had
any trouble with, and for that reason he
more especially prized the letter. It ro
cited the fact that the doctor had entered
the infant class of the Sunday-school, that
his parents had been members of tha
church, that he hart up in the light
of its sanctuary; that his life had always
been pure and truthful, and that his old
friends in Kaiamazoo felt certain that he
would ultimately vindicate himself.
"I mitiht continue reading such letters
from now until midnight," said Dr.
Brown, "and I can tell you it would be
very sweet for me to do so. Now, if you
think I hnve done any wrong, hoid up
your hands."
No hands were held up and Dr. Brown
adjourned the Drayer-meetinj*.
At the informal reception that followed
a large number of those in attendance
pressed to the platform, clasped the pas
tor's hand and assured him of their sym
pathy and loyalty.
ELUSIVE MRS. TUNNELL.
Har Presence In Kings County Is
Strongly Denied by Mrs.
Hayes.
HANFORD, Cal., Jan. 3.â Just opposite
the village store of Grangeville is tne
twenty-acre fruit farm of Mrs. Allen
Hayes, a widow, 60 years old. On beinj;
informed that The Call wished to see one
Mrs.Tutinell Mrs. Have.* denied all knowl
edge of such a person.
"You are at liberty to search every room
in my house and also to search the farm
building?," she said. On beinp asked, "Is
it not irue that a lady has been stopping
!:ere?" she said, "Yes, Mrs. Ben Fowler of
Tulare."
On being asked. "Do you know the
young lady. Miss Overman," she
answered, "Yes, last faii I was visiting
my daughter, Mrs. Lulu Horton, 216 Eddy
street. San Francisco. One day â I am not
sure of the month, hut it was in Septem
ber or Octoberâ Mi ~s Overman calied to
see my grandson in reference to the school
he was attending, as she was seriously
thinking of taking a course in shorthand.
My opinion of her was pood. Miss Over
man seemed to me to oe a modest and
well-behaved girl. It was the only time I
ever met her before or since. Yes, I have
met Dr. Brown. I attended his church
with friends and was introduced to him
about two years ago. Last fall I attended
bis church with a Miss Fairchild and Dr.
Brown knew me and we shook hands. I
don't know Mrs. Davidson or any of the
other people you ask about. Myd'augmer
may, of course.
"I have been living here for eight years
past and in the fall of the year I visit my
daughter, Mrs. Horton."
Mrs. Hayes is worried that she has been
brought into this and, like Mrs. Tunnell,
will no into hiding if many more reporters
come around.
The following dispatch was received
from Tulare last niuht. It is a flat con
tradiction of Mrs. Haves' statement con
cerning her visitor, and adds greater mys
tery to the affair:
f FLARE, Cal., Jan. B.â To-night's work
reveals more mystery in Mrs. Tunnell's
whereabouts. Mrs. Ben Fowler denied
beiiif: over to Grangevilie. and stated posi
tively that she did not know a Mrs. Gum.
On the Tery mention of that name she ex
cused herself and would not taiK further.
Arriving; to-night at the residence of

Hayes ol Grangeville, your correspondent

she could remember." .She (Mr?. Tunnell)
left Woodland years au'O and went north,
where she married a man named Fowler,

DAGGETT AIL EIGHT.
The Superintendent of the Mint Makes
a Little Kxplaimtion.
In yesterday's issue of the morning
papers the following telegram was pub
lished :
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 7.â The Secretary
of the Treasury to-day sent to the House a lis*t
of officers of the Government coming under
hi< department who are delinquent in render
ing tneir accounts or in the payment of bal
ances due from them for the lnÂ«t fiscal year.
The list includes A. R. Spofford, Librarian of
Congress; Elihn Olund, Collector of Customs,
Duluth, Minn.: Overton C^de, Superintendent
of the Mint at New Orleans, and John Daggett,
Superintendent of the Mint at San Francisco.
"When consulted in reference to the dis
patch Mr. Dapcett declined speakinp about
the other officials mentioned, but pre
sented the lollowing written statement of
his own position:
The Mint of the United States)
at San Francisco, V
Ftterintendent's Office, Jan. 8, 1896.)
To the Editor of the San Fian-ciseo Callâ Sir:
The statement made in this morning's Call
that my accounts in this Mint were short, al
though for ft very small amount, I deem it my
duty to refute with the following letter:
TBEAsnny Department, â )

V.'Asni.voTnN, I). C. Uec. 30. 1695. J
John Dappttt, E.^ , Superintendent U.S. Mint, San

a repayment to the above appropriation to cover
disallowances found by the Auditorof the Treasury
Department. Respectfully yours,
K. K. Preston, Director of the Mint.
In explanation of the Above deficiency I have
to say that for the past twenty years the daily
end other papers have been taken at this Mint
and filed away In its archives and the cost
charged up to the contingent fund. Such was
the case even for the first year of my adminis
j tration, and the amount allowed by the de
partment. Thereafter, the account beln? dis
allowed as unwarranted, the amount was held
out, and correspondence ensued that resulted
i in my paying for the newspapers myself, as the
foregoing letter shows. Kespectfuliy,

TiAGGETT SOT TtKLIXQJJEXT.

(rorernntent.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. B.â Director
of the Mint Preston says the superinten
dent of the mint at San Francisco, John
Dagcett, is not delinquent or behind with
his accounts. Some reports have made
him appear as a defaulter, but he does not
owe ?1 to the Government. It may be he
neglected to render his accounts as soon
as lie should Dave under the Dockery act.
but this is mere technicality.
Tins explanation by Mr. Preston was
made owing to a communication which
tiie Assistant Secretary of Treasury sent to
the House of Representatives yesterday,
mentioning the superintendent as one of
the department officers who had been de
linquent in rendering his accounts.
THORKTON'S FEE.
He Is Allowed Five Ilnmlred Dollars
by Judge Seawell.
Judge Seawell has decided the case of
Crittenden Thornton and Felix Merz
bach against I. G. WiCriersham by allow
ing the plaintiff 1 ? $500. The suit was one
for attorneys' fees.
In IS9I Lippitt it Lippitt, Barclay Henley
and C. J. Swift were retained by I. G.
"Wiekersham to protect his interests as a
stockholder in the San Luis Obispo Bank.
Lippitt <t Lippitt withdrew before the case
was under way and Thornton <fc Merz
bach took their place. The case depended
upon wnether Lippitt & Lippitt or Merz
bach and Thornton, their successors, were
drawn into the case by Wickersham or by
Henley and Swift. If the former they
should look to Heniey and Swift for theiV
fee, it was claimed, and if the latter to
Wickershani.
Thornton sued for $15,000. Mr. Wicker
shani claimed that all the services were
rendered under a written contract, and
was willing to stand by the contract, which
showed that $1000 balance was still due.
The court took this view.
THE INGLESIDE SUSPECTS.
Wiat Were They Doing by
the Olympic Pier at
Ocean Beach ?
STORIES TOLD BY WITNESSES.
Officer Josephs and Clarke, the
Cashier, Are Still Unable to
Appear in Court.
Jiulpe Conlan's courtroom was crowded
to suffocation yesterday afternoon at the
second session of the preliminary examin
ation into the Ingleside electric car rob
bery. Judge Low presided, and at times
was compelled to rap rather sharply upon
the judicial desk in order to make himself
heard.
The first witness placed on the stand was
Charles McLean, bartender at the race
track, who scored a point for the defense
by testifying that the defendant, Welch
came into town with him at 6 o'clock
Christmas afternoon. He further stated
that both Middlemiss and Welch wore in
toxicated that day.
H. M. Russell, keeper of the turnstile at
the Ingleside track, said he thought he
had seen Gardner, or some one resembling
him, at the track Christmas day, but would
not be positive.
William 15. Peck, cashier of the restau
rant at the track, told the story of the rob
bery substantially as related by the other
witnesses. He did not see tho faces of the
robbers, ana said he would not be able to
identify them.
Police Officer Fitzeerald also told the
story of the hold-up and referred to the
shooting of Officer Josephs. He said that
the man who fired the shot was tall and
wore an overcoat. When asked whether
an overcoat would make a man look taller
he responded in the negative.
Police Officer Gibson, the next witness,
was asked by Mr. Mogan whether he
knew anything about the robbery at the
Ingleside track.
"We object, we object," sang out Mr.
Tobin. "We don't ctre what the officer
knows about the robbery. Wliat has to be
shown is that, these defendants are con
nected with the affair."
Judge Lo^v sustained the objection, after
which the witness proceeded to relate that
he and Officer Cody had been summoned
by Engineer Willis to view the leather
money-pouch found by him on the
ocean beach. He then stated tijat he and
a number of other otlicers had watched
the pier near which the money had been
lound. Their vigilance was rewarded by
the discovery of Gardner and Middlemiss
at a little after 8 o'ciock on the evening of
December 28, the day on which the
money was found. The two men
were seen near the ninth post
of the pier. The place on the
beach where the money was found had
been disturbed, as though some one had
been searcning for something. Both men
refused to answer questions. They were
forthwith taken into custody, Middleraiss
complaining that he would have to stand
the whole of the blame, since he had no
friends, as Gardner had. When asked
where he had been the day previous, Mid
dlemiss stated that he had been with the
defendant Welch, who, he said, was a bar
ber at Port costa.
Mr. Mogan asked the witness whether
the pier would be a safe place for a
drunken man to walk on at ni^ht, espe
cially if the night were dark and the man
very'drunk.
"We must object," interposed Mr. To
bin, "there is no reason why farcical and
irrelevant questions should be asked. "
"Well," said Mr. Mogan. '"the samÂ«
questior was asked of Mr, Willis yester
day and nobody objected.'"
"I don't see any reason for objecting,"
remarked Judge Low, mildly. **Let the
witness answerâ â "
"In my opinion," answered Gibson, ''it
would be an unsaie place for a sober man.''
'â¢Well, as to that, remarked the Judge,
meditatively, "a urunken man often can
over places where a sober man is afraid
to venture."
No one disputed his Honor's dictum,
and the examination proceeded. In an
swer to Mr. Gesford's cross-examination
the officer reiterated his lormer statements
with more particularity. He said he had
viewed the pier through a pair of night
glasses, and had noticed one man stooping
near the pier. He believed he was one of
those arrested, but could not say which
one. Th? sand was dug up in the vicinity
of the ninth post of the pier,
Andrew Stork, a motorman on the Mis
sion-street extension electric railway,
testified that the car which he was con
ducting was arriving at the terminus
when the robbery occurred. He told the
conductor to turn out the lights, as there
were "'fireworks ahead." The order was
obeyed, aiid the people in the car left in
great trepidation. He saw the ta;l man
with a rifle, but could not swear that he
was masked. He heard shots and loud
talking, but could not give details. The
police went the next day looking for the
place, but could not find it.
"Oh, well." remarked Mr. Gesford,
"that's characteristic oi a policeman."
â¢'Order, order," thundered tr.e bailiff, as
a burst of laughter resounded through the
courtroom.
Officer E. J. Wrenn was the next wit
ness. Hv said that he and several other
officers had gone under orders to the
Olympic Sait Water Pumping Works at
the ocean beach on the evenintr of Decem
ber 26. He went on guard at the p>ier at 7
o'cloclc with Officer Campbell. About 8
o'clock he noticed two men approaching
the p^er on the beach. They went from
one side of the pier to the other, and thpn
iii?;ip)ieitred from view. He thought they
migtit be biding on the pier. A command
to stand forth was given in a loud voice by
one of the officers, and the defendants,
Gardner and Middieraiss, came in view,
standing upon the uier. feoth were takt.ll
into custody.
Officer Charles J. Cody was the last wit
ness placed on the stand. He repeated the
testimony o^ Officer Gibson regarding the
events subsequent to the finding of' the
money-pouciion the beach. He took charge
of Gardner and placed the "cuffs" upon
him, while one of the oth' r officers
performed the same service for Middle
miss. At the time of the arrest the wit
ness did not notice any disturbance in the
sand near the ninth post of the pier, but
afterward he observed that the sand at
that point had been excavated either by
means of a stick or with the human hand
or foot; not with a spade.
At this juncture Judge Low adjourned
further proceedings in court until to-mor
row afternoon.
It w;is agreed between Judge and coun
sel thar tne examination of Cashier Clarke
and Officer Josephs, both of whom were
wounded at the time of the robbery, should
take place this evening at the houses where
they are staying.
Mr. Mogun asked what conveyances
would be provided for the necessary court
officials and the Judge and attorneys.
"1 think a cable-car will do," responded
his Honor, dryly.
Some of the legal lights concerned not
seeming to relish this ruline, Mr. Tobin
brought the day's proceedings to a gmce
ful and appropriate close by recommend
ing the patrol wagon.

UNION CARPENTERS.
The General Committee of Philadflphia
to Form Organizations All Ion?
the Coast.
The annual election of officers of the
Carpenters' and Joiners' District Council
was held last evening and resulted in the
selection of the following: J. E. BfcVicker,
president; 11. Hageman, vice-president;
L. D. Gordon, recording secretary; F.
Doane, financial secretary; L, N. Vezina,
treasurer; G. Miller, warden.
The District Council has taken a new
departure, which is conceded will be of
great benefit to the craft Arrangements
bare boon made whereby all carpenters in
good standing in their unions mayh'Ve
the services of physicians and secure
medicine at cheaper rates than are char ec
to the workingman. The recent hard
time? left many carpenters deeply ii
to their family physicians and to the drug
stores.
The Plan adopted by tie District Council
is similar to that of the Foresters. Ar
rangements have been -nade with the pro
prietors of four drugstores whereby all
medicines will be furnished at almost cost
opon the presentation of the Carpenters'
working cards. These drugstores are on
Sixth ana Harrison, Fulton and Van Ness,
Market and Stockton and Market stree:
near the cut.
Within the next few days the services of
four physicians will be secured. Three
have offered thoir services to '.he council,
but the selection will not be announced
until all are selected.
Word has been received from the pen
eral executive committee of the Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners of Amer
ica, in Philadelphia, that tliia .-;atc wiH be
reorganized in a substantial way dnring
the year.
Funds will be advanced for the forma
tion of unions in every city in California,
and in fact all over the toast. Work in
this direction wili be bejrun soon.
Before this information was received,
however, ttie local body began this work.
The preliminary steps to t..e formation of
a carpenters' union in S;inta Cruz have
been taken and the officers will be in
stalled by the genera! organizer in a snort
time. Similar steps have been taken t>
ward organizing unions in Sacramento
aiv! Stockton.
The District Council has decided to bold
its annual picnic at Sunset Park, near
Santa Cruz, in April. Arrangements have
been made with the railroad company for
taking out a large excursion train on that
occasion.

The Mayors of Three Cities
Will Formulate a
Call.
SUTRO.DAVIE AND BOGGS
People's Voice to Be Raised to
Congress in No Uncertain
Tones.
MEMORIAL TO CONGRESS READY
Presented at the Meeting of the Com
mittee of Fifty Yesterdayâ
of the Document.
Mayor Sntro's active brain has evolved a
new, original and far-reaching plan for
fighting the funding bill which C. P. Hunt
ington hopes to pass through the present
session of Congress, and he is losing no
time in putting it into execution.
It is nothing less than a great State con
vention to Bend the voice of California's
opponents of the measure to Washington
in tones that cannot be mistaken.
The scheme suggested itself to the
Mayor yesterday afternoon, and he at once
placed himself in communication with
Mayor Davie of Oakland, Mayor Baggs of
Stockton, and Mayor HubbaVd of Sacra
mento, all of whom are firm opponents of
the funding bill.
The first two named officials at once
signified their willingness t<> discuss the
matter, and asrreed to men at r!ie ortice of
Mayor Sutro at 11 o'clock li.is morning,
f .icramento's chief executive stated that
he would use his best endeavors to be on
hand, but did not feel sure that he could
get away from Sacramento in time.
Mayor Sutro's plan is the most compre
hensive that has yet been suggested to
voice the sentiments of the people of this
State. The three Mayors will formulate a
call for a great gathering of the represen
tative men of the State to meet in San
Francisco immediately to protest to the
fullest extent of their ability against the
extension of time asked by the railroad
magnates.
The peop 3e of points so far distant as to
preclude the sending of delegates will be
asked to hold district conventions and to
add the result of their deliberations to the
action taken by the central convention. It
is hoped 07 this means to arouse the State
as it baa never bo ore been aroused and
force the light against the funding bill to a
victorious conclusion.
MEMORIAL mDOPTED.
The Committee of Fifty Calls on
Congress to Defeat the Fund-
Ing Bill.
The committee of fifty mot in the
Mayor's office yesterday forenoon and
unanimously adopted a memorial to Con
press opposing the passage of the funding
bill by which an extension of fifty years
[lowed the Central Pacific Rail
its debts now due to the Gov
ernment. Plans were also outlined for
the speedy collection in California of the
$10,000 necessary to combat at Washington
('. P. Huntingdon's active and persisteut
efforts in behalf of the bill. Mayor Sutro,
who presided at tha meeting, expressing
himself in vigorous language upon the ne
cessity for effective and immediate opposi
tion, was greeted with applause when be
declared, "1 am an old man, but I'll go to
:iÂ«ton myself and I'll bring them to
terms if tLe people will stand by me."
To expedite the collection of funds W.
H. Coward, Oscar Lewis and Joseph
Britton were appointed a special com
mittee with authority, if necessary, to em
ploy energetic collectors. In connection
with tnis work Oscar Lewis moved that
the press of the City be asked to assist in
c electing the $10,000, and the motion was
carried unanimously.
Every member of '.he committee of fifty
will be furnished a subscription-book so
that each one may col'eot $100 for the fund
and aid the sub-committee in raising the
whole amount.
What has been done already and what
remains to be accomplished is expressed
in the words of Mayor who, address
ing the committee, said:
Twenty days ago we first met and organized
In this room the committee of fifty.
I stated at that time that the first step
should be tho raising of ways and means to
send agents to Washington and to defray print
ing and postal expenses.
We raised on the spot $2500. We issued sub-

'1 he memorial as read to the committee
â retary John McÃeynolds grates the
1 tuple's caje in a plain, convincing argu
ment, and ih as follows:
â  i Â« >> " l S! it a> Senate and Home of Ktp-
Tlie undersigned, citizens of Cali
i, respectfully represent that the i*:op!e
of tins State are deeply interested in the settle-
I't-iit of the debts due by the Central and
i. uion Pacific railroad companieH to the United
for subsidy bonds Issued to them, and
tliey bog to be heard in opposition to any
scheme- for refunding or extending the time o"f
payment of said debts.
Our opposition to such Eehemcs la not
prompted by hostility to the debtors, but by
ta"cc Â° nS 01 lhe h 'B hefct Public impor-
I. it is shown in the report of the Pacific
Railway Commission that afl the visible means
ana "fets of these companias have been
*rougful!y appropriated to their own use by
the original stockholders and managers, and
it any of the proposed legislation passes the
companies will have no means from which to
t>a> the. debt in question except their capacity
to earn money by transportation.
.v. The frci K ht s they carry eastward consist of
the products of our soil peeking a market
abroad, in competition with like commodities
produced elsewhere, and we have to pay for
transporting thÂ«m to the general markets of
the world, where we meet our competitors.
lhose carried westward are Eastern or Euro
pean products purchased In the sume general
markets for consumption here. On these also
we have to pay the freight, as an addition to
the price of the goods. Hence, excepting the
insignificant items of westbound pleasure
travel and local freights from .Nevada, I'tah
ana Nebraska, the people of this .State will
have to pay the entire sum the com
panies have to earn in order to pay
these debts, with their accumulated thirty
years' past interest, as well as interest
tor the whole period during: which payment
may be deferred. That Of the Central Pacific
road alone amounts, at maturity, to over
â¢$"7,000,000. That of the Onion Pacific is
about the same amount. To extend these
debts for hfty years at "J per cent per annum is
to double their amount, and to leave them to
be paid out of future transportation is to sad
dle them, tome 6300,000,000 in amount, on
us. and our children for two generations to
come. No conquered Roman province was
ever so grievously taxed.
11. Any extension or time for the payment
ol these debts necessarily involves a condona
tion of the misappropriation of the funds pro
vided by the public for the building of (he
roads, but convened to their own usn by those
who controlled the companies that did the
work.
The "plain, speedy and adequate remedy"
for the recovery of the money due the United
States by these companiesâ that which any
business" iuhii would adopt in like circum-
Btaneesâ is fi n closure of the mortgages, and if
a deficiency arises an action against the guilty

ING BILL.
directors as far as they survive and against their
representatives so far as they .have left assets,
for the restoration of the funds misappropri
ated by them. Foreclosure is^o obviously the
first rational step toward an end of the whole
question that "plain people" are unfible%o un
derstand why it is not resorted to at once.
The only reason assigned to the contrary is
that there is a "first mortgage" on the prop
erty which will swallow up all the proceeds of
sale; but the priority of this so-called "first
mortgage" on the Central Pacific road is chal
lenged, on the strength of facts impossible to
deny, and not easy, if possible! within the line
of adjudged cases* to answer. The amount is
$27,855,080; too large a sum to be deemed in
significant or to be surrendered without a
struggle. The Union Pacific mortgage is per
haps in a similar predicament. Here, there
fore, is a lien of from $27,000,000 to $60,000
000 which every one of the various refunding
and extension schemes so far advanced pro
poses to abandon gratis, and without even an
inquiry as to the rights or equities involved.
The Tkurman act distinctly challenges the
priority of these so-called first mortgage bonds
in its recital that they are, if lawfully issued
and disposed of, a prior lien to that of the Gov
eminent subsidy; but how if they were nat law
fully issued ana disposed of? Plainly in such
case' they have no priority. Now on their face
they evidently do not conform to the require
ments of the act of isti-i, and so were not law
fully issued, and as to the disposal of them
the report of the Railway Commission shows
that the.? were paid out by the directors of the
company to themselves under the thin dis
guise of a construction company, of which
they owned all the stock, end hence were not
lawfully disposed of. Surely this question of
law involving nearly $23,000,000 is worth
the consideration of a court.
111. These refunding schemes all proceed on
the presumption that the Government is with
out remedy against the guilty parties for these
misappropriated millions, although no one of
the private suit* brought against them on sim
ilar grounds has failed to secure a settlement
satisfactory to the plaintiffs. '-Trie allega
tions," cays the report of the commission
(p. 73), "contained in these complaints were
such as would compel men of honor, if these
allegations were false, to defend themselves at
any cost. It appears from the evidence that all
these suits were settled, and that the stock
owned by the plaintiffs was bought at rates I
varying from Â£400 to $1000 per share." Why
should an effort for redress by the United j
States be less eflicient than one of a private in
dividual? That railroad managers and their
partisans should favor an abandonment of
these claims is easily understood; that it should
be advocated by the surviving partner of the
firm that did the vrrong and secured tne fruits
of it is also natural enough; but that legisla
tors looking only at public interest should
even entertain such a proposition before all
all means of collection have been exhausted
passes comprehension.
IV. These railroad corporations are not in
fact so destitute of means to pay as is repre
sented ; on the contrary they have valid claims
of large amounts against persons possessed of
great wealth sufficient to materially reduce
the amount of the debts, and, when added to
the sinking fund in the treasury, perhaps to
extinguish the principal of them. The Central
Pacific Company, for example, has a perfectly
valid claim against its guilty directors lor all |
the millions misappropriated by them; and
even if the estates of the deceased associates
prove beyond the reach of the law Mr. < mils P.
iluntington yet remains. lie is the surviving
pawner of the combination that did the wrong,
and) if not the author of the scheme was un
doubtedly a guilty participant in the proceed
ings. Ho and his millions are directly responsi
ble to the Central Pacific Railroad Company.and
to Us creditors, claiming in proper proceedings,
as such, for all the misappropriated moneys.
He is an active promoter of refunding. He an
nually leaves home to attend the National cap
ital, preparing, art vising and advocating some
refunding bill. Why, at his advanced age and
possessed of wealth beyond his power to spend,
does he assume this toilsome, wearing, expen
sive and odious labor, which his confidential
letters to his associates, published by the Kail
way Commission, show that he hates and de
tests? Not, be assured, because he feels any in
terest in 6eÂ«-ing the Govermentdebt paid, but
because he knows that without the condona
tion involved in refunding he will, in the
mere ordinary course of justice, be called
on to make restitution! His whole interest in
the question is in the condonation that re
funding or extension necessarily involves.
V. All of the Southern Pacific Railroad south
of Gilroy and Alcalde belongs equitably to the
Central Pacific Company. It was built dis
tinctly with the credit of that company, di
verted by unfaithful directors to the construc
tion of a rival road. This tact is of easy proof;
and this asset, with the others above named,
will go far to extinguish the Central Pacific
debt. This also is too valuable an asset to be
surrendered gratis.
VI. But far more important than all other
considerations is the deep shame and dishonor
such legislation as proposed will bring on
our country and the Congress that enacts it.
Consider the simple facts as history will record
them.
The United States advanced for theconstruc-

which it has paid, is paying, and will Day, up

over 26,000,000 acres of land worth at Govern
ment price over .$Â«>5,073,83tJ, in all $243,953,
--595. This advance was made in the midst of
civil war and groat public peril, when every
sentiment ot patriotism and honor demanded
| the strictest fidelity to duty in dealings with
; the public. Yet nearly half of the vast sum
I was misappropriated and diverted to their
| own use by the parties intrusted with the
, work, and the companies in whose names they
j acted are left at the end of thirty years stripped
of all means to pay, while tho individual direc
tora are nil millionaires!
To condone such a shocking malversation of
public funds, especially after publishing to the
i world the particulars and proofs of the facts, as
congress has done in the report of its Railway
: COJamimloit, will be to say to all the world that
i the American Congress considers these tnansac
tlona quite up to its standard of morality in
dealing with public trusts; that mtsaporop'iia
â¢ tion of public moneys, if done on a large BCSIe,
i and by men wealthy from the proceeds of their
! guilt, is but a minor ollense for which a prom
i lse to pay half a century hence will buy for
-1 give;iess. Nay, that Congress will not even
1 wait to be asked for it, but will be fore
: handed with the offenders and offer them an
i unsolicited pardon. What will be the verdict
i of posterity on the Congress which enacted or
i the members who voted for such legislation
may be easily foretold. What will they think of
' them:eives a few years hence, when the man-
I agerss, liaviug secured a condonation of their
! offenses, and entrenched thtir wealth behind
; a new act of Congress, make default (as most
; assuredly they will) on their new promises
I and abandon the roads to the United States,
| subject to a mortgage of undoubted validity
, of two or three hundred millions, with a float
j ing debt of eight or ten millions more, and re
| duced to the physical condition described by
one of their own distinguished lieutenants as
"two streaks of rust and a right of way"!
Your petitioners, therefore, earnestly pro
test against surrendering the first lien'of the
I Government subsidy bouds or any Congres
sional recognition that it has been surren
dered; let the courts decide Hint question;
i and to present it as well as to collect from the
I guilty directors of the roads the sums they

SMART MENZIES ASKS FOR A REHEARING
Police Commission Fight
Again in the Supreme
Court.
TO OUST M. A. GUNST.
The Relator Believes the High
Tribunal Has Slipped
Certain Cogs.
POINTS OF HIS PETITION
A Main Contention Is That Important
Constitutional Questions Were
Overlooked.
The fight between Stewart Men zies and
Moses Gunst, the incumbent, for the po
lice conimissionership lias assumed a new
phase. A petition for rehearing in bank
of the case has been prepared for filing in
the Supreme Court. Its main point is
that the decision in People vs. Hammond
does not apply to this case.
The petition, which is very voluminous,
is signed by Henry N. Clement, of counsel
for the relator, Stewart jilenzies, the title
of the case being "The People of the State
of California, by W. F. Fitzgerald, Attor
ney-General, on the relation of Stewart
Menzies, plaintiffs and appellants, vs.
Moses Gunst, defendant and respondent."
The petition opens as follows :
The counsel for the rolator in this case, Stew
art Menzies, maintains that both he and the
(iovernor of the State of California, Â»vho ap
pointed him to the office of Police Commis
sioner of the City and County of San Francisco,
have a just cause of grievance (using the word
in its legal and not in its personal souse)
against this high tribunal, by reason of the
fact that the decision rendered by the court
on the 16th ult. virtually ignored the impor
tant constitutional questions involved in the
case, which were fully presented by the briefs
of counsel on file; and that the opinion of
.liutice Heiifchaw (which was concurred in by
the court) doen not conform to the spirit of
section *2, article VI. of the organic law of this
Btate, which require! that "the grounds" of
the decision "shall be stated."
The relator therefore asks for a rehearing in
bank in order that his case may be fully dis
cussed upon its merits, and that when a'deci
sion is rendered by the court upon such re
hearing it may be rendered upon the merits.
All we have asked and all wo now ask is that
the court respond to the question:
Did People vs. Hammona decide that the
right to appoint Police Commit, mers was not
given to the tiovernor by section 4, article
XX, of the' institution?
we asser. that the above question was not
raised in People vs. Hammond, was not con
tended for in People vs. Hammond, was not
discussed In People vs. Hammond, and was
not decided in People vs. Hammond, and thai
it has never in any other case thai came before
this court been raised, contended for, discussed
or decided.
* â¦ â¢ * â¦
We therefore ask for a hearing before this
court upon the claims of section 4 of article
XX of the constitution, as being the true
source from which the Governor of the State
of California derives bis poorer to appoint Po
lioe Commissioners. We have not had a hear
ing upon it. Having presented its claims as a
constitutional provision to this court, we dtem
ourselves entitled to the grounds upon which
the court decides that .t is not the source of
the tluvemor'.s Dover.
It will not do to put aside a constitutional
lion without 'lt'bate, nor will it do to as
sume that a constitutional provision was con
sidered in some prior case in which its claims
were not advocated.
We came before this court representing the
itive branch oi the State tovernnient of
California aavocating the claims ot" a constitu
tional provision upon which is based the exer
cise of an important executive function, and
have asked that it be interpreted, construed
and applied.
We nifi answered by a decision of the judicial
branch of the State government of California
that It will not consider tho constitutional
question now presented to it upon tbe ground
thai it will conclusively presume that the ques
tion lif.d been Already adjudicated adversely
to thy executive branch of the government in
n former case, although, in such former case
the claim of the constitutional provisions now
relied upon by the executive ns the source of
his power was not advocated, was not discussed
uiid was not even mentioned by the counsel
whose duty it would have been to advocute it,
was not the subject of discussion before the
court by either counsel as a factor in deter
mining the constitutional issue before the
court, and was not mentioned, discussed, or in
any way alluded to by the court In rendering
its decision.
If fas we claim to have demonstrated) the
questions adjudicated in this etise were not
considered by the court in People vs. Ham
liH'ini, how i;ari a series of subsequent deci
sions following and based upon People vs.
Hammond constitute an adjudication oi the
principles contended for in tiiis case?
lu^'.ue Henshaw refers to People vs. Pond,
8!) Â«Â»!., 1-10: People vs. Edwards, 93 Cal.. 153;
and People vs. Newman, 90 (,'al., 005, as cases
following and based upon the principles of
People vs. Hammond.
In neither of the abo^e cases were the pro
visions of tteorton 4 of article XX of tue 'con
stitution (upon which we rely in this case)
discussed or brought under view.
These cases are then analyzed to prove
the contention, the petitioner thereafter
remarking:
The comments of Justice Paterson, in his
opinion in People vs. Pond, upon the effect
which a decision overruling the former oases
would have upon municipal proceedings in
Snn Francisco are mere dicta and can have no
bearing upon tne case, but inasmuch as they
were deemed worthy of being twice quoted by
Justice Henshaw in his opinion in this case it
is but just that we should have the opportunity
of expressing the sorrow we feel that we cannot
in this petition be permitted to show what the
effect has been, and is now, upon municipal
proceedings in Pan Francisco by what we deem
to be an indiscriminating adherence to the
decision oi the court in People vs. Hammond,
and the failure of the court to distinguish the
present contention from that made in People
vs. Hammond.
After citing authorities for the court
overruling a decision rendered by itself on
an erroneous assumption, the petition con
cludes:
There Is more involved in this case than the
mere question of whether the rolator, Stewart
Menzies, or the respondent, Moses A. Gunat,
shall occupy the ottiee of Police Commissioner.
In ordinary Qtses fas remarked by Justice
McFarland "in People vs. Freeze) "It is not a
matter of much importance who should tem
porarily have the office struggled for"; but
in this case the startling claim is made by the
respondent, Guust (based upon the decision of
this court in People vs. Hammond) that he has
the right to hold the office eternally, or, at least,
as long as his life shall last and his good be
havior continues, and that there is uo power
on earth to remove him. Under a constitu
tional government, the organic law of which
exprenljr limhs the term ot offices to four years,
the claim of Mr. Ciunst challenges our attention
and we are instinctively led to Inquire how
huch an anomalous state of affairs could have
been brought about.
A great principal is involved in this case.
We have earnestly contended that an impor
tant provision of the fundamental law upon
which the Chief Kxecutive Of this State liases
his rifrht to exercise the function of appoint
ing a Police Commissioner has never been con
sidered by this court. As proof of the fact we
refer the court to the record of the cases m
which the question of his power to make such
appointments was at issue, and find that the
constitutional provision upon which he now
bases his right to appoint has never been al
luded to or mentioned, much less commented
upon, in any case. Wo have invoked that
Constitutional provision (section 4, ani
cle XX) in this ease, and have asked that it be
nowconsideredand construed. The court has
rendered a decision in which it declines to con
sider the merits of the executive contention,
and insists upon an assumption or inference
that the constitutional provision relied upon
as the course of the Governor's power to act
(viz.: section 4, article XX), was considered
and construed in the case of People vs. Ham
mond, although it was not cited upon the
point in controversy, its claims were not ad
vocated, and no mention whatever is made of
it in the decision ofthe court.
We respectfully urge that the court has
erred in not vouchsafing to us a hearing upon
the merits of the constitutional provision
which forms the basis of the relator's claim,
and we, therefore, ask that the judgment of
the court be set a-ide and a new hearing
granted. Kespectfullv submitted,

DEATH OF THERESA CORLETTE.
She Wag Well Known as a Writer for the
I.ocui l'l â â â¢-â ..
The many friends of Mrs. Theresa Cor
lette will learn with sincere sorrow that
she died some three weeks ago at Milan,
Italy, where she was superintending the
musical education of her daughter Ethel.
The cause of her decease is stated in a
cablegram as a severe cold settling upon
her lungs. Under direction from her rela
tives here, the body will be cremated, and
the sad duty will devolve upon her daugh
ter of returning at once to this country
bearing the sacred ashes of her mother and
guardian. Miss Ethel had entered upon
her career as an operatic singer, and bad
been received with satisfactory results.
Mrs. Theresa Corlette was for many
years an accepted writer upon the papers
and magazines of this City and a bright
and breezy correspondent of the Eastern
and Australian press over the norn de
plume of "Silver Pen." Her Christmas
offering was always either a story or a
poem in which some heart.touching inci
dent of heroic suffering on one side was
balanced by Christian benevolence and
charity on the other, the entire recital in
citing the reader to helpful assistance to
the distressed.
The deceased lady leaves three daugh

State.
SALVATION FOR CHINESE
The Army Will Soon Open Up
in New Mongolian Head
quarters.
A Number of White Officers Have
Learned Chineseâ Consent of
the Consul Gained.
The Salvation Army is about to open a
branch of its work in Chinatown. The
Consul-Generul, while not contemplating
enrollment under the banner himself, has
expressed sympathy with the scheme, and
so many Chinese merchants have promised
their support that it is expected the new
branch will be entirely self-supporting.
While the fact is not generally known,
there arc a number of Chinese soldiers in
the ar n iy, and these converts have ex
pressed a desire to get in among their
Mongolian brethren and hunt up recruits.
The officers who have worked most in
Chinatown are also anxious to nave a
headquarters, and with this end in view
they have been diligently studying the
language for months. Several of them
can now converse quite easiiv in the
Cantonese dialect, and. what "is harder
still, they can understand everything that
is said to them in the same tongue.
Captain Ma; Jackson has been appointed
head of the new branch. She has hud
considerable experience in Chinatown, and
phe can wrestle with the difficulty of talk
ing to the yellow-skinned denizens of that
quarter better than any of the other mem
bers of the local corps. " All the oflicers at
present detailed for the Chinatown branch
are white and all of them have learned
Chinese expressly for the work. Many of
the soldiers will be Chinese, and it is pos
sible that before long sorno of them will
rise from the ranks.
Several rooms are being considered, but
a definite choice of headqr.arterÃ has not
yet been made. The branch will be sit
uated somewhere in the heart of China
town, however, and as it is to be opened
by the first of next month the selection
will prooably be made within the next few
days. The army intends to make it hot
for the heathen as soon as it begins its
work, and as several of tho converted
Mongolians are musicians the regular
music of the army meetings will be aug
mented in the Chinatown branch by the
dulcet strains of the tomtom and the
moon-faced bunjo.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. B.â Wall street was
quiet to-day and a more confident tone character- â 
ized the dealings. Prices with rare exceptions ad
vanced quickly in response to buying orders and
the supply of stocks offered at the higher quota
tions was so gin all that this feature of the specula- i
tion led to comment. I. on. inn was a buyer of St.
Paul and Louisville and Nashville i" cover shorts. '
Far more important, however, in bringing about !
the restoration of confidence among sock traders
was the general impression that there was a strong
understanding among the nig bankers ami the
Treasury Department whereby the gold reserve
will be strengthened in case of a raid.
No facts were forthcoming to sustain this theory, ;
hut it nevertheless ad a reassuring effect. Minor!
factors at work were the reduction in the posted
rates of sterling exchange of 1._,. the decision of the
Delaware and Hudson to maintain the reaular I
dividend of 7 per cent during lS9t>. the compara- j
live ease of money on call and the llfzlit withdraw
als of ;;ol<l frcm the sub-treasury. The refusal of
the cle:irini:-hoiise banks to open special gold ac
i-ounts with clients also bad some influence in
fnvor of Richer prices.
The opening prices ranged from i 2 to 3 per cent,
and was most marked In the anthracite coalers,
the grangers, industrials, Louisville and Nashville,
Western ITmoti and the southwesterns. .Man-
Italian ruled firm until near the dose, when it
hold down :vÂ»4. to 97. The break was due to a raid.
Speculation closed quiet and firm. Net changes
show advances of %fe@*.2^Â£ per cent, wUh the an
thracites in the Ira.:. Manhattan lost '_'* 2 per cent
on the day. The total sales were 172,600 shares.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 1n.., Jan. B.â The speculative feel-
Ing was charged with nervousness this morning,
and wheat opened Irregular with prices unchanged
to S/kc higher than they closed yesterday under the
unsettled conditions. The English-German ques
tion led in Interest, and figured as an influence In
the marie:. The buying by the outside was not
ably large, commission houses having numerous
orders from their country clients. The demand
was met with free Offering* from professionals,
however, and aft-i â  period 01 indecision the
market exhibited \venknes< from the pressure. The
New York stock market being higher and J-ns;iish
consols unchanged served to calm the fears of the
ira '. â  . and checked the rising Inclination of prices.
Liverpool cables were quiet mid firm. Receipts
at Chicago were 79 cars and 19.804 bushels were
insuecieU from store. Northwestern arrivals were
4 - carj, ami nst 210 a year ago. Continental
markets were higher. Atlantic seaboard clearances
were fair at 870.818 bushels. May wheat opened
frjiTi 63c to 60.y B e, sold between 61VsC and <>OVBc,
closing at â¢;(!â¢ s'".')!!'.*'-. "M'n'-ji- under yesterday.
Kstlmated receipts for to-morrow 65 cars.
COKNâ Was ruled b.- the same irregularity as
wheat, early, the disposition among traders being
jO purchase, an advance ueing deemed probable.
The later action of the leading market was less ;
encouraging and the legitimate situation in corn ,
not being a strong one the early advance was lost.
Liverpool cables were firm. Receipts were 228
cars. There was no corn taken from store. Ex- i â 
port clearances \\Â«re 185,412 bushels. Mavcorn
opened from 29 to 2914 c, advanced 10 29 5/ B e, re
ceded to and closed at 2iti/ B @29Vi.c, Vi&^/sc higher
than yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow,
375 cats.
OATSâ Practically the same action was noted In
oats as in the other grain markets, only there was
less activity, Prices were, firm at the start but
easy later. " Receipts were 88 cars and 356 bushels
were taken from store. May oats closed unchanged
from yesterday. .Estimated receipts for to-morrow,
135 cars.
FLAXâ Was firm, Cash, 92@93c: January,
90c bid ;|May. 95&4 C. Receipts were 20 cars.
PROVISIONSâ A little belter feeling prevailed
in product this morning. The tone of the market
was largely dependent upon the hog trade, and
was also assisted by the early feeling in grain. The
strength was folly sustained throughout the ses
sion, the close being 30c higher than yesterday for
May pork. 5c higher for May lard, and- 12Vic
higher for May ribs.

The circular of the Cutting Packing Company
says: 'â¢There is nothing whatever doing In apri
cots, either export or domestic. There appears to
be more peaches than has been figured on and
some large holdings have been evidently secluded
from public gaze. Pears are undoubtedly in short
supply and win command their own price before j
the new crop is available. Plums are a dead issue, i
nobody â¢is interested In them, and If a buyer ap
pears he can do business at his own Ideas of value.
Pie fruits as a rule are sold at from 25 per cent loss
up to cost. :
â¢â¢We do not look for any Improvement in prices
or demand generally, until at least two months
later, by which time we will probably strike some- i
tning of a spring demand, but this at the Hume time !
is altogether problematical. So far as prospects for i
a new crop are foreshadowed , by climatic intlu- i
encea, everybody unites in prophesying one ot the I
largest ever known in the State. In 1896. Prophets,
however, are at a discount, m dull limes the past
three years have produced a much larger crop of
them than of fruits even, and as most of their pre
dictions failed to materialize, little confidence is i
placed in them." Â«' .

. WOOLâ The market 'Is quieter and easier. A
local circular says: '-The last' week in December
whs an active one in Wool -matters. The talk of
.tariff and a possibility that the Senate would
promptly pass the 'bill that was passed in the
House stimulated speculation, and though prices
were not advanced, yet Wool holders anxiously
met 1 lie changed condition and were free sellers of
any stock that a buyer would- entertain. There
suit was a placing of probably 1000 or 1200 bags,
mostly of inferior, shrinks", defective stock that
previously would not be touched by speculators at
any nrice. The market is well cleaned up, as the
new year starts In. what remains being inferior
low grades of the very poorest type." We quote
Fall as follows: Humboldt and Mendocino, 7@90;

COALâ A circular for Australia says: '-The out- '
going year has been the banner year for low prices,
being the lowest on record, but the present outlook
would intimate that still lower figures will prevail
in 1896, and principally from the Colonies, as the
failure of the wheat crop there locally, and our
wheat shipments must cause a freight accumula
tion which will necessitate low Coal rates in the
absence of other business. Australian grades are
being materially interfered with here by the in
creased consumption of oil and Swansea Anthra
cite as steam and gas producers, and the prices
named for each make them formidable competit
ors. The uncertainty of the oil region's output,
combined with Increased fire insurance, detract
materially from the danger of this as a Coal substi
tute; besides, as a fuel, the black diamond is ap
proximating a standard value, which shows no
economy in favor of oil. Swansea shipments, even
with their freedom from duty, cannot be offered
within 75c <$ ton of approved grades of Newcastle,
which will restrict their sales this year." Welling

140,496 bags, against 165,818. The stock in first
hands January 1. 1896. was 3268 hags, against
5872 January 1, 1895. The world's visible supply
January 1 was 3.562,364 bags, against 2,687,207
January 1, 1896. The circular says: "Although
stocks here are not large in any direction, the re
vival of business anticipated with the new year's
advent has not been realized thus far. With some
pushing a few sales have been effected principally
old-crop remnants of more or less Inferior style,
j but there is no general demand and the lethargic
i condition of this staple during the last 60 to 90
days remains unbroken everywhere. The steamer
City of Panama will arrive about the 12th inst.

Kecorrting a Ship's Course.
A naval engineer of Hamburg, John
Paul, has invented an apparatus record
inc graphically the course of a ship dur
ing the entire voyage. Upon a strip of
paper the angles of the rudder in
relation to the longitudinal axis of the
ship and the relation to the magnetic
needle of the compass to the axis of the
ship are continually recorded. The paper
is moved along by clockwork, while the
recording pencil "receives its motion by
means of electro-magnets connected
by wire with the ship's compass and
steering engine. The recording instru
i merit, working automatically, may be shut
off so as to be inaccessible to any but the
captain, and such a record woiilri'dnubtless
furnish the most satisfactory evidence of
the ship's course during the entire voyage.
With the automatic register of revolu
tions of the propeller and of knots traveled,
previously patented by the same inventor,
the entire" maneuvering of the ship during
a given time or the entire trip may be
critically inspected by the ships owners
or the captain.

DR. HOOD'S DOUBLE LIFE
Gained the First Wife's Con
fidence by Means of the
Civil Code.
LOVED HIS SERVANT GIRL.
A Deposition From Buffalo That Leaves
No Doubt of the Gay Doctor's
Mode of Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Jan. 8. f
A deposition was filed with the County
Clerk this afternoon that supplies the
proof to a strange story of duplicity that
was iirst told when Dr. Hood died at Hay
wards about two years ago. The docu
ment is from Dr. Hood's first wife, and
has been filed for the purpose of substan
tiating her claim 10 the estate of the de
ceased. The tangle arises from the fact
that Hood was posing as the legal bus
baud of two women at the time of his
death.
When Dr. Hood was living at Hay?
lie had a wife known to all as Mrs. Eifie
Hassler Hood. She died a lew months be
fore the doctor and left her property to
him. Before the estate was distributed
Dr. Hood died, and in accordance with
the terms of the will the estate was ordered
to be distributed to A. J. Hassler of Hay
wards. At this staÂ«e the Eastern widow
was heard from. Jn order to establish her
claim the deposition was taken which was [
liled to-day.
Mrs. Hood says that she now lives at
Buffalo. N. V. . and is -SO' years of ape. She
met Dr. Hood in San Francisco when she
was IS years old at the bouse of Mr. and
Mrs. Keycs. In June, IS7B, Dr. Hood
showed her the Civil Code of California, in
which he had marked several passages,
v.hi Cii he said indieiueJ that if they lived
te^ether as husband and wife they were
lust as legally married as though a cere
mony had leen performed. He said his
wife had very recently died near San
Francisco ar:d"he aid not like to make his
mar:. public ?o soon after her death.
Subsequently he gave her a certificate of
marriage, signed by Justice Sbinn of San
RaiaeCtestifying mat on .Tune 24, IS7S, he
had married J. W. H. Hood to Bessie
Anderson. The certificate is attached to
the deposition:
Mrs. Hoods says she lived with Dr.
Hood as his wife for two years and that he
introduced her to many prominent people
whose names are well" known in Oakland
and San Francisco. A child was born at
Upper Bluffs-, Humboldt County, in April,
187!', and named John Paul Hood.
According to Mrs. Hood's story, the
doctor was a passionate and effusive letter
writer, and extracts from these letters
fully establish the relationship between
them. They are all written to "My dear
wife," and tain many allusions to "our
dear boy." The direct story of Mrs. Hood
co:ic!udÂ»s thus:
"I Ja^t saw Dr. Hood on board the
steamship Britannic, in New York harbor,
fts he was leaving for England. I came
East to Chicago from California in<lÃSo, at
the suggest] of Dr. Hood, as my health
was poor and he said that the trip might
benefit me. M> illness was caused by wor
rying over the fact that Dr. Hood was
spending most of his time with a young I
woman named Em"c Mallatratt (nee Has- j
sler), who was once my servant, but whom
1 discharged because of her conduct with
my husband. After she left my house Dr.
Hood took care of herâ supported her â
and 1 knew that they lived together as
man and wife later. It was on her ac
count that he ceased to care for me and
our child."
In one of the letters he says: "I am
pleased you are meeting friends and be- j
ginning to feel at home, but hope that you
will lot get too thick with men. Don't
flirt with or encourage men." At the
time he was giving his wife such counsel
he was introducing his former servant girl I
a3 his wife to his Hay wards friends.
About three years ago the woman with
whom he was living got into trouble on
account of her violent and cruel treatment
of a little girl the doctor had befriended in
London and brought out here. From that
time on the Hoods were notorious, and
when the doctor made his will on his
deathbed he left his curse upon ail who
had pushed the barges of cruelty against
them, and whom he charged with his
wife's death. The contest comes up on
-â¢jih inst.
THE PRESIDENT TALKS.
He KxplaiuÂ« the Present Standing of the
Regimental Band.
OAKLAND, I'm.., Jan. 8. -Much has
recently been published about the split in
the Fifth Regiment band and the row
over the proprietorship of tne music. The
president of the union has furnished the
following statement for publication:
In the first place, the president was not
charged with "v..;. questionable practices
in his official capacity," but with discrim
inating in lavor 01 the Fifth Regiment band.
In the second place, the man who brought
tho .*!,;.â¢, George H. Richardson, is not a
"disaffected" member of the band, but a dis
charged member of the Fifth Regiment band,
X. G. C In the third place, the meeting on
Sunday night was r.ot unsuccessful to the
opposition because of the non-attendance of
the members, but because the said opposition i
did not have sufficient votes to carry its
point.
The true inwardness of the whole matter is
this: President Hall was entirely exonerated '
of the charge of favoritism or discrimination
on the ground that at the time being there was
but one organized band in Oakland, trie Fifth I
Regiment band, and it as recognized that the
move, on the part of the opposition, was maae
solely for the purpose of throwing the presi
dent nnd present board of directors out. Mr. i
Hall, however, is still the president, and, to- I
gether with the board of directors, will remain j
in power till the next annual election.
The statement made that the matter will be
brought up again at the next monthly meeting !
i - also erroneous, ns it has already been fully
settled and cannot be brought forward again.
hr inserting the above you will greatly favor
the union and place the matter in its proper I
light. Very respectfully. J. H. Hall.
President Musicians' Union, Oakland.
STOLE a goat.
Uncle George Hromlcy to Be Tried for
a Misdemeanor.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â novel trial
will be conducted in the Macdonouph
Theater January 17, for the benefit of the
Young People's Unity Club. Uncle George
Bromley is the defendant in the cv- i and
it is alleged that ho stole the gout from
Widow Grady. Judge S. G. Nye will hear
the t. stSniony, which will be presented by
attorneys Fred K. Whitney and i- red 8.
Btratton: Many society people will act as
jurors and witnesses, ana there will un
doubtedly be a full house.
"Trial by Jury," as tr-.is piece is called,
is not exactly a play, because the dialogue
is only partly written, much being left to
the Impromptu fun-making powers of the
participants. Among the latter will be
the goat, who will be in court togged as
'â¢Exhibit A." He will brows* around the
courtroom, wajreing his beard and devour
iii;; choice pieces of clothing of the law
yers and jurymen, ana occasionally taking
a header at somebody rash enough to turn
his back on so important a personage.
Widow Grady describes herself as one
who "be mostly takin' Â«crubbin' for a
livin', and she lives at Lake and Jack
son streets, where a washerwoman would
naturally be expected to reside. The lead
ing witness for thft defense is a rival wash
erwoman, Maud Bvangeliue White, who is 1
black as the ten of spaces. Mrs. White,
who does not take the same view of the
goat question as Mrs. Grady, is a new
woman â an up-to-date washerwoman, who
wears bloomers and rides into he court
room on her bic3'cle, with a wash-basket
fastened on in front.
Mrs. Trowbridge Honored.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â The directors
of the recent Oakland Exposition this
evening presented Mrs. H. 0. Trowbridge
with a beautifully engraved silver service
as a recognition of the interest shown by
her in that enterprise. President J. W.
Nelson, M. J. Keller, G. Roeth, Theodore
Gier, B. T. Bell, F. W. Spears, Craigie
Sharp and Mr. Davis went to her residence
about 8 o'clock taking her completely by
surprise. When all had been made to feel
at home the presentation was made.
The service is an elegant affair of eight
pieces and a magnificent silver tray neatly
engraved. In the bottom of the tray
are the words: "To Mrs. H. 0. Trow
bridge, with the compliments of the ex
ecutive committee of the Oakland Exposi
tion, 1895."
Kew Ordinance Needed.
OAKLAND, Cm.., Jan. B.â lt has been
discovered that the ordinance under which
the city olh'cials have been obtaining their
supplies is illegal, and a new one will have
to be passed by the Council. According
to the present ordinance requisitions
granted by the Mayor may be made for
any sum he may see fit. A short time ago
the Council sought to place the signing of
the requisitions in the hands of the chair
man of the Finance Committee instead of
the Mayor, but the measure failed to pass.
Now that a new ordinance is required the
Council will undoubtedly incorporate the
change. Of course the Mayor will veto it,
so if Brosnahan, Bassett, Watkinson and
Heitman stand together as usual the veto
will prevail. 'â :
Cremation for Garbage.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â The Council
is. now about to settle the garbage question
definitely. Bids have been received from
three parties and one must be accepted-.
Schafier & Swift, who have built a scien
tific garbage crematory, offer to destroy
the garbage for $350 a month for one year.
A.. B. Tennant, who is now getting $535 a
l month to haul it away on cars, offers to do
it for $260 if he can segregate it and put
the ashes on the city marshes. John
Hackett will give $50 bonus if given a
ten-year contract to dispose of it. The
Health Officer favors cremation.
Da Costa Is All Right.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 8.-John Mar
tin denied to Judge Frick this morning
that he had schemed to nave Jose da
Costa declared incompetent. As there was
no evidence except hearsay to refute Mar
tin's statement, Judge Frick shut him off,
; saying he did not want to hear more in
i the matter. The Judge then granted the
I petition restoring Da Costa to capacity.
The suit to collect the money from Wen
ceslaw that was paid to guarantee Da Costa
a home for life will now be pressed.
There Was No Cruelty.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. â A story hav
ing been published that the San Leandro
branch of the Girls' Directory of San
Francisco was not being properly con
ducted, Mrs. Prescott, ascent of the' Chil
dren's Society, investigated the ] lace
yesterday. The agent states that there is
no evidence of cruelty, but as two sisters
have charge of seventeen babies in four
I rooms their task is a hard one. Under the
circumstances, Mrs. Prescott says, the
foundlings are tolerably well cared for.
A Heavily Bonded Road.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â W. S. Ru
dolph, secretary of the Central Railway
Company, tiled a certificate of bonded in
debtedness to-day, showing the creation
of the debt by the stockholders at a special
meeting held last November. The road
was bonded for $120,000, and the purpose
of the bonds was to cay debts and retire
outstanding bonds. The vote for the
bonding was 4190 shares out of a total of
5190 shares. The issue was of 1000 bonds
to run thirty years at (3 per cent.
No Need to Have Run.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. S. â Thomas
Lamb, who was shot by Officer Andrews,
is recovering. The police appear to be sat
isfied that he was not one of the robbers
for whom they were searching and cannot
understand why he should have run off.
The surgeons have as yet been unable to
locate the bullet, but believe it has not
lodged in any very dangerous place.
Kellogg's Bribery Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â G. H. Kel
logg, formerly a railroad detective, was on '
trial to-day for an alleged attempt to secure |
I a bribe to square a case against Edward
| Savage, who was arrested for pocket-pick
j ing. When the case was called the princi
i pal witnesses were missing and cannot be
I located. The opinion has prevailed since
i the indictment was issued that the case
I would not go to trial.
To Help Armenians.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. B.â mass
i meeting will be held at the First Congre
gational Church next Monday night to de
vise some means of providing assistance
for the Armenians. Rev. Drs. McLean,
Kummer, Hobart, Coyle, Wendte and Pal
mer, Rev. Father McSweeney and Rabbi
Friedlander have the affair in charge.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 9, 1896.
DIVIDED THE COMMITTEE
Effort to Oust Chairman Mau
talen to Be Made on
Saturday.
RELIC OF THE LAST CAMPAIGN.
Each Side Claims an Equal Number
of Votes and the Fight Is
Very Keen.
Oakland Office San Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broaaway, Jan. 8. f
Next Saturday the Republican County
Central Committee will meet for the pur- j
pose of deciding whether it shall be reor
ganized or whether it shall remain as it is.
As near as can be ascertained the commit
tee is evenly divided.
The bone of contention is Charles Mau
talen, chairman of the committee. For
over a year he hns been persona non grata
to half of the members and this feeling
was arrived at by a piece of work that at
once stamped Mautalen either as an aa-
CUARLES MAUTALEN, THE .MAN WHO HAS EVENLY i-IVIPED TUE ALAMEDA
COUNTY REPUBLICAN CENTRAL COMMITTEE.
[From a photograph.]
ranced diplomat or as a novice, and
neither his friends nor his foes have been
able to decide which. The trouble occurred
at the time P. G. Hilborn was making his
campaign for Congress. At a meeting
held in this city Mmitalen, as chairman of
the County Committee, appointed Stephen
T. Gage as chairman. As Gage's relations
with the railroaa company were so well
known many considered that Mautalen
had chosen him for the purpose of enabling
hilborn'tj enemies to circulate the cry of
railroad influence being used in his behalf
and thus nelp Warren B. English.
Others concluded that it was a scheme to
help Hilborn and thnt that candidate's re
fusal to go upon the platform at the meet
ing made him hundreds of votes. No sat
isfactory decision of the merits of the sen
sation was ever arrived at, but there has
been since the last election a split in the
committee. After the election the com
mittee met and passed some very strong
resolutions which were never made public.
At this time the tight is over the chair
man, and Mautalen and Evans are the
rivals. The Evans fa'tion assert that
some time ago they were informed by
Mautalfen that he would resign on account
of iil health and tnat they believed him.
Mautalen denies that there is any truth in
the story and that he will not resign.
The Evans wing is known as the reor
ganization party, and claims that Mau
talen is the remaining legacy of the
Vrooman regime, and must go. There are
also ;ome smaller elements figuring in the
unpleasantness, but these are all subor
dinate to the main tight.
As things appear at present the commit
tee will be a deadlock if all turn up at the
meeting. Mautalen claims a majority with
his own vote, and depends upon Walsh,
Bernal, Church, Riley, StriKer and pos
sibly Ford. Evans claims Mitchell, who
wants to be a Supervisor; McPherson,
Armstrong, Flettcr add Hawes. Church
is sick and will probably not be at the
meeting, so the vote to determine the re
organization plan appears to be even.
Each side is trying to capture an extra
vote, but the greatest dUplav of confidence
is being made by the Mautalen party.
WILL BE NO DRIVEWAY.
Reinstein's Plan for Improving
the University Grounds
Opposed.
Professor Hilgard Contended It Would
Be of No Useâ The Campus
Inspected.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. B.â Fiom
present indications it would seem that the
plan of Regent J. B. Reinstein and Super
intendent McLaren of Golden Gate Park
for the construction of a broad entrance
and driveway to the university grounds
from Center street would experience some
difficulty in carrying into execution.
Thin forecast is the result of the decision
which took j>lace thil morning between
Regents Reinstein, Houghton, Martin and
Professor Hilgard.
The three regents mentioned, in com
pany with Professors Hilpard, Soule and
Randall, and Messrs. McLaren, Grunsky
and Rowell, spent the entire morning ii\
looking over the prounds and planning for
the proposed new reservoir and for the
much-talked-of driveway entrance from
the west Ade of the reservation.
From the very be.-iuningof Regent Rein
stein's move for the beautifying of the
grounds it has boon his object "to have a
V-shaped 60-foot approaeb to a 4,5-foot
drive from Center street through Pro
fessor Hilgard's agricultural garden?,
along Strawberry Creek, under the oaks',
to a point near the present footoall prounds.
Bo to the present time the scheme has
met with little apparent opposition, but
to-day Professor iiilgard took a decided
stand against the measure. His views
were concurred in by Recent Houghton of
the building and grounds committee, Re
gent Martin, chairman of that committee,
standing on neutral ground.
As a substitute to the driveway it was
proposed that a broad footwalk be con
structed over about the same territory as
that planned for the driveway.
Professor Hilgard, through whose plan
tation the driveway would pass, gave aa
his reasons for opposing the measure that
the driveway would be little used by vehi
cles excepting those of butchers and
bakers, on account of its location with re
spect to Oakland and the populated por
tion of Berkeley; that the historic oak
trees would necessarily have to be inter

another entrance made from University
avenue as soon as the streetcar line from
the proposed West Berkeley Ferry was
put in ; that the agricultural experimental
gardens would be again disturbed and
much cut up, and that he believed a drive
way and walk for pedestrians through a
place such as the university grounds
should not be. both on account of the dust
and the liability of accidents.
"As for my gardens," said he, "they are

Tuesday.
After considering some of the plans for
laying out walks and drives near the main
buildings, the party went to the site of the
proposed reservoir about 300 yards to the

PLOT TO DESERT A WIFE
A Catalina Island Sailor Wants
Her to Believe He Is
Drowned.
ANXIOUS TO GO EXPLORING.
An Unnatural Husband's Letter to
the Promoter of the Santana
Expedition.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 8. f
The promoters of the bcheme that has
for its object the exploration and possible
conquest of a large portion of Lower Cali
fornia have received a very remarkable let
ter from Avalon, Catalina Island. They
are asked to become parties to a plot that
would sever the family relationship of a
husband and parent in such a manner as
to cause hia nearest kin to think his body
was at the bottom of the deep blue sea.
The strange letter refers to an article
that appeared in The Call several weeks
ago describing the projected voyage of the
Santana. It then procceeds to tell a story
more suggestive of an irresponsible ro
mancer than of the head of a family.
The writer, whose name is suppressed
by Alfred Baroteau, who received the let
ter, because he regards it as a confidential
communication, starts out by raying that
he possesses accurate knowledge of some
valuable mines, and is anxious to join any
expedition that will help to explore tnem.
lie asks the terms on which he can
come in on the deal and then proceeds to
tell of his worldly goods and what he
would be willing to Uo to help the expedi
tion, lie possesses a powerful little gaso
line launch that he says is capable of tow
ing a &niall schooner three miles an hour
in smuoin water, and he suggests that it
would bu a valuaole acquisition to the
owners of the Santana in exploring creeks
ana rivers and la helping the old bark
along in a calm.
ihen comes a little bit of family History.
The writer says he has not the same
opinion of married life that he had when
the experience was new, many years ago.
His domestic relations are, in fact, so
Strained and uncongenial that he is
anxious to separate them entirely. He
does not wish to do so in a manner that
would cause unnecessary anguisn to those
he would leave behind, su he has con
ceived a plan by which he hopes to create
the impression that he is dead.
If the members of the expedition will
stand in the writer asks to know when the
Santana. will be off a certain point on the
coast. Ho wants them to heave-to and
wait till he visits them. He will go off in
his gasoline launch and the little vessel
can then be hoisted on deck and away ttie
whole outfit will sail to the southeast. Of
course, the unhappy writer need not taka
so much trouble to leave Avalon, as ;i mail
is sent lrom the place daily, but by leaving
in the gasoline launch and not returning
the writer sees a way of avoiding much
unnecessary searching and anxiety. He
says that it is a custom ol his to make
frequent trips from Catalina to Clemente
Island and that if he should not return it
will be at once concluded that his gasoline
launch has exploded and that the launch
and owner have gone to the bottom.
In order to prepare the way for the
t credible reception of such a story, the
owner has toid many stories by his fireside
of the numerous little accidents he has
not experienced, and has made frequent,
reference to the final one that may come
unexpectedly and render his wife a widow.
"I've been in many schemes in mv life
time,'' said Baroteau to-night, "but that's
just a little too cold-blooded to suit me. I
can sympathize with a man that is tired
of married life, as I have a lively divorce
suit on ray hands at this time, but 1 think
she ought to know whether she is married,
divorced or deserted. It don't strike me
as quite fair to leave her in the dark. I
don't think we'd take that gasoline launch
with us. If it is as dangerous as repre
sented, it might explode on board, and I
don't appreciate that kind of a judgment. 1 '
HE JUMPED FOR LIBERTY
An Alameda Chicken - Thief
Leaps From a Train in
Motion.
The Rev. Victor Morgan to Reply Next
Sunday to the Rev. Mr.
Bovard.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. B.â Police Officer
Moebus boarded the first local narrow- |
gauge train yesterday morning in the hope 'â â 
of catching the chicken-thief who has been j
robbing the West End henroosts. The j
officer had a theory that the thief took the
earlyjtrain for the City with his booty, get
ting on at one of the last stations.
His theory was right. A man with a
basket of chickens boarded the train at
Second avenue. The officer upon ques
tioning him soon became convinced that
he had found the thief and placed him un
der arrest. The officer rode with his pris
oner down to the mole and siarted back
with the return train. But the train had
not proceeded far from the landing when
the brakeman passed through the car and
leit the door open.
The chicken-thief seized the opportunity
and made a dash for liberty. He ran
through the open door and leaped from
the platform upon the trestle. Whether
he alighted in the water or remained on
the ties is not known. The train was
stopped and backed up, but he was no
where to be found.
Later people at the Bay View House,
near the old lauding, reported to the po
lice that a man bleeding from cuts about
his face and with torn clothes and hat
less, applied for some one to row him
across the estuary to Oakland. He is un
doubtedly the man, but has not yet been
found.
Will Take the Other Side.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. B.â Rev. Henry
Victor Morgan, pastor of the First Chris
tian Church, announces that he will preach

ACCUSED OF STEALING.
Employes of Brown Brothers Charged
With Systematically Robbing the
Finn for a Long Time.
Henry Wetzler, a cutter for Brown
Brothers, was arrested last night on a war
rant charging him with felony embezzle
ment. Tne complaining witness is B.
Sheiddman, one of the salesmen.
Wetzler was. arrested Saturday on a
charge of petty larceny and admitted to
bail in $50. The case came up in Judge
Joachitnsen's court Monday and was con
tinued till January 13.
W. T. Baker, a salesman, was arrested
December 24 on a charge of grand larceny
for having, as alleged in the complaint,

The warrants accuse them of having
systematically stolen clothing from Brown
Brothers and sold it in saloons and other
places around town.
DAMAGES THAT MAY FAIL
Question of Jurisdiction Settled
in the Sampson
Cases.
The Prospect of the Baker and Doolan
Litigants Is Not ' Very
Encouraging.
There is not much prospect of a large
amount of pecuniary realization to be
looked forward to by the claimants in
the schooner Sampson damage cases now
in the Adrniralt}' court.
When the ocean steamer the City of New
; York was wrecked off Point Bonita in the
winter of 1893-94 the Sampson was engaged
in the work of unloading the ill-fated yes
: sel. A3 though fate itself were against
a nything connected with the big ship, the
j little Sampson was blown ashore and
; wrecked on January 5, 1884, and to add
! still more misfortune the lives of George
Baker and Jamea Doolan, seamen, were
lost. The Sampson also caught fire.
Suits were subsequently brought in the
: Superior Court by Lottie Baker, adminis
: tratrix for George Baker, and Mary Krone
and others, heirs of James Doolan. The
; actions were for $50,000 each.
Then a restraining order was obtained
: from the Admiralty Courtâ the Federal
tribunal that has jurisdiction â cutting
short the proceedings in the State court;
| and before the same tribunal a petition
! was made under the act of 1851 (section
i 4H82 of the United States Revised Statutes)
to limit the liability of Thomas P. H.
. Whitelaw and Thomas A. Whitelaw to
! the value of the schooner and nothing
! over.
The schooner has been appraised at
about $tiOO gross and $300 net. United
States District Judge Morrow granted the
petition yesterday, overruling the de
murrer entered by the attorneys for the
; Whitelaws and denying their motion to
\ dissolve the injunction.
Judge Morrow, in his opinion, goes
thoroughly into the question of the juris
i diction of the Federal and State courts re
! spectively. "The only real question pre
| sented by the demurrer and motion to dis- j
' solve,' lie explained, "is whether this J
| court (Admiralty) having original and ex- i
I elusive jurisdiction of limitation of liability j
! proceedings can enjoin the suits in the j
I State court."
In support of their motion counsel for
the Whitelaws cited section 720 of the Re- â 
vised Statutes, which reads: "The writ of !
injunction shall not be granted by any j
f court of the United States to stay proceed
ings in a court of a State except "in cases
; where such injunction may be authorized
by any law relating to any proceeding in
bankruptcy." The court showed that the
original act of March 2, l793, from which
I this section evolved, did not include the
| exception relating to bankruptcy proceed
ings, and he also demonstrates" that even
in its present form section 720 is inappli
cable. A decision of United States Dis
trict Judge Choate. of New York is copied
from as settling the entire question of jur
isdiction, as follows:
The peculiarity of this case is that the suit
stayed la one in which by the express terms of
an act of Congress the State court is absolutely
without jurisdiction to proceed. There are not,
therefore, the same reasons of public policy in
this case as in the cases more particularly pro
vided for In section 720 for prohibiting the
issue of the injunction or restraining order.
It does not interfere with any exercise of
jurisdiction which could otherwise be claimed
by the State court, and Is not likely to lead to
unseemly conflicts between the Federal and
State tribunals, to prevent which is under
stood to have been the original Durpose of this
prohibitory legislation, bo positive is the lan
guage of section 4285 that it may be doubted
whether, after the transfer therein provided
for, the state court could make any order what
ever in the cause, even one restraining the
plaintiff from its further prosecution.
On the whole, therefore, construing the two
sections togetner, I think this court may still
restrain, by its order pending tne suit, parties
who have commenced actions in trio State
court from further proceedings therein.
The suggestion that the court which first olÂ»
--tains jurisdiction in a matter has the right to
go on and determine the cause has no force in
a case where, by a valid statute, a court subse
quently obtaining jurisdiction is vested with
exclusive jurisdiction.
Judge Choate's decision was given in tne
Long Island, etc., Transportation Compa
ny'scase (5, Federal Reporter, 599). The
action of Judge Morrow limits the liability
of the Whitelaws to the mere value of the
schooner.
TRIAL OF THE LUCERO.
George A. Knight Gives Charles lair's
New Yacht a Test Run
Outside.
Charles Fair's gasoline yacht Lucero
was taken outside the harbor by George
A. Knight yesterday for a trial trip. On
board were Captain G. M. .lessen, her
future skipper; Robert Enge'brecht, her
builder, and Captain Hughes, who
brought the vessel down from Seattle re
cently.
She was jpeerled at about nine knots
both head on to the sea and broadside to
the waves, and in every condition behaved
in an excellent manner.
The L-raceful little steamer rode the
swell like a bird, breaking but little water
and with very little rolTin her motion?.
The engines worked without a hitch and
the entire trip was made most satisfac
torily.
Mr. Knight, as the representative of
the young millionaire, declined to state
whether he would accept the vessel, but
he expressed himself as pleased with the
performance of the boat.
In Honor of a Great Victory.
Major W. B. Hooper of the Occidental Hotel

DOCKING HORSES' TAILS
Objected To by the Society for
Preventing Cruelty to
Animals.
TRYING TO MAKE A NEW LAW
Secretary Holbrook Says Docking Is
Vulgar as Well as
Wicked.
War has been declared by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
against the custom of docking horses' tails,
and during the next session of tne Legis
lature the society means, if it has any
power in the land, to have a clause enacted
making docking an offense against the
law.
Secretary Charles Holbrook says that it
is not only cruel to dock a horse's tail, but
that it is also vulgar; and he wants to see
a stop put to California following a fashion
that is completely out of style in the East.
Secretary Holbrook said yesterday:
I regret to say that then is no law against
docking in this State, and in the present con
dition of thiugs â we could only secure a con
viction on the general grounds' oi cruelty. We
are working, however, to get a bill in next
winter, making docking a specific offense.
I should like to get a case and try it, for it is
my belief we could secure a conviction, even,
under the present law.
Docking is another name for torturing a
horse. The tendons of the tail are severed and
the ends are twisted upward and fastened by
pulleys to the roof oi the stall. After a week or
so in this position, when the wound heals, the
tendons retain tbeii upward curve and this
causes me hair of the tai I to bunch out.
The difficulty is to get a test case of docking.
We have been working for months, but we tind
tiint the thing is done in private Btablei by
Eome groom or coachman, and we have not the
power to go in and investigate even if we
suspect that the thing is going on. It's easy for
a loc of people to sit around and say, "Oh, I'd
catch a case." They say thÂ« same thing of dog
tights, but they do not find it so easy when
they set out to locate one. We cannot cet any
body to testify to the dockings that are done in
these private stables and we have no power to
arrest a man for having a docked horse in his
â  ion, he always says he bought it that
way. It's one thing for us to suspect ihat m
man has his horses docked at home and an
other thing to prove it.
Secretary Holbrook is especially dis
gusted with Anglomaniaca, who fondly
imagine that it is "quite English" to dock
their horses' tails. He said when dis
cussing this phase of the cruel practice:
Such nonsense! I suppose some idiot has
come out here from the East with a dook-tailed
horse. All the other idiots at once imagined
that to be in the style they must copy hirr.
They say that we have been wearing pointed
.shoes long after they were discarded Dy New
York, ami it is just the f-fime with docking our
horse*' tails.
In New York and Philadelphia they hava
enacted laws atr: inst docking, so, of course,
the custom it dying out there, and in England
no horse can take a prize at a hor.se show
which has had his tail docked. lam not sure
whether there is a clause against entering
them, but they are entirely disqualified from
taking any kiiid of a prize. Most of the Eng
lish horses hare their tails cut short, but it is
only the hair that is clipped.
Secretary Holbrook says that he hope^
soon to find proof of an actual case of
docking. He thought at one time of send
ing a horse to a groom belonging to a rich
man here, who is suspected of making
money in his leisure moments by docking
horses, and boarding them in his master's
stables till they have recovered from the
operation, but on second thought the sec
retary decided that he would not be justi
fied in allowing the cruelty for the pur
pose of securing a conviction. The officers
of the society are gathering information,
however, and they hold some clews which
lead them to hope that they will soon have
sufficient information to make an arrest.
ABDUCTION CHARGED.
Eugene F. Beams Arresteil on a Warrant
From Delano, Kern County.
Eugene P. Beams, alias De Beers, was
arrested yesterday by Policeman C. M.
Barnes, on a warrant from Kern County
charging him with abduction. He will be
detained at the City Prison till an officer
arrives from Kern County.
The complaining witness 13 Thomas
Cole of Delano, Kern County. Several
weeks ago Beams eloped with Cole's
daughter, Mattie, and the two came to this
City. Beams had been working on a
ranch near Delano for some months where
Mattie was cook, and an acquaintance wa3
formed, ending in their flight to this City.
Matties father wrote to Chief Crowley,
asking the Chief to find his daughter, and
Detective Anthony and Policeman Barnea
located them in a lodging-house on Mar
ket street. They were detained in the City
Prison for two or three days, when Mattie
was taken back to Delano by her former
employer and Beams was released from
custody, as no one would prosecute him.
About two weeks ago the warrant for his
arrest, on the charge of abduction, was re
ceived at police headquarters and Barnes
has been hunting for him since. Beams
is well known on the water front, as he
worked for three or four years or. the
Stockton boats.
At the time of the elopement the citizens
of Delano vowed that if ever Beams re
turned there they would lynch him, and
he may anticipate a warm reception.
NEW TO-DAY.
KNOWLEDGE
Brings comfort and improvement and
tends to personal enjoyment when
rightly used. The many, who live bet-
ter than others and enjoy life more, with
I less expenditure, by more promptly
adapting the world's best products to
I the needs of physical being, will attest
the value to health of the pure liquid
laxative principles embraced in the
remedy, Syrup of Figs.
Its excellence is due to its presenting
; in the form most acceptable and pleas-
I ant to the taste, the refreshing and truly
; beneficial properties of a perfect lax-
! ative; effectually cleansing the system
dispelling colds, headaches and fever*
and permanently curing constipation.
It lias given satisfaction to millions and
met with the approval of the medical
; profession because it acts on the KidÂ«
; neys, Liver and Bowels without weak-
; ening them and it is perfectly free from
! every objectionable substance.
Syrup of Figa is for sale by all drug*
j gists in 50c and 31 bottles, but it is man-
ufactured by the California Fig Syrup

REV. MR. GOODWIN DEFENDS MASSACHUSETTS
Compares Its Present Con

Mexico.
REPLY TO FATHER YCRKE
The Protestant Minister An
swers Some Inquiries
With Sarcasm.
G. A. HUBBELL OX SCHOOLS
Quotes From the "Catholic World" and
Other Sources to Substantiate
His Contentions.
Rev. W. R. Goodwin sends the following
communication to The Cam.:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Mr. r. C. Yorke, who mistakes epithets for
arguments and whose fluidity of language is
only equaled by his tenuity of thought, turns
aside ior a moment in his Hood of words to
allude to me.
Possibly Mexico was not settled by the best
blood of Spain. She was colonized a hundred
yeare before Massachusetts, and by Spaniards
Â«if such stock as Cervantes, Cortez, I'izarro,
lolumbiis. Cordova, Ximlnes and Isabella. If
that was not good blood, what was it? Massa
chusetts was settled by poor I'nritans. Mexico
has a rich soil, adapted to the production of
everything that grows out of the earth, and
-:np every metal used by man, while
Massnchusett.s has a sti-Tiic soil", uncongenial
climate, and no articles of transportation save
ice and ro,k. Mexico has bull-fights, igno
rance, superstition, vice and utter degradation.
Massachusetts has free schools, intelligence,
wealth and worldwide influence.
But Mr. Yorke is not expected to know these
thing?. He is better acquainted with the dark
apes, with papal bulls and with the literature
of the musty past. His tongue and pen are
practical proofs that perpetual motion is pos-
Fible, and Father Bovard, as a ciank, has set
that windmill in motion that will probably
continue until the machinery is worn out.
Mr. Yorke asks me if I know what is the per
centage of pure Indian Dlood and mixed blood
in the Mexican population of to-day? Does he
know how much Indian blood is in the popula
tion of Massachusetts ? Does he know the
composition of the green cheese that is said to
be in the moon? Is he a Yankee or a Jesuit
when he goes to acting the inquisitor? He
ought to know that Mexico is Romanist and
Massachusetts is Protestant.
I hope the readers of The Call will not be
made to suffer at the hands of Mr. Yorke by an
octave "postscripturji" in reply to this. Yours
truly, W. R. Goodwin.
HUBBELL ON SCHOOLS.
He Assails the Roman Catholio Church in
Begard to Them.
G. A. Hubbell of the American Patriot
submits the following letter in reply to
Father Yorke:
AMERICAN PARTIOT OFFICE,
819 Market street. \
Editor San Francisco Call â Dear Sir: In de
fending the Jesuit. Peter C. Yorke found that
he had a very bad job. A Jesuit can't be suc
cessfully defended in any country.
Peter C. Yorke, the foreigner, now wants, to
go off into a strictly religious region and show
by divine authority that, according to the
nintn celebrated sentence of Pope Gregory
VII, "All princes must kiss the feet of the Pope
only." Now. this is Peter C. Yorke's religion.
The A. P. A. does not care if he does kiss the
Tope's toe, nor whether that toe is clean or
not. That is his religion. He is welcome to it.
The A. P. A. does not concern itself about such
matters â cares nothing about it. It is a politi
cal organization. The province of the Ameri
can Protective Association is to defend the i
political institutions of the United States
against Jesuitism.
To show you from Roman Catholic authority
what Jesuitism thinks of our most cherished
Institution, the public school, and the opinion
ot Brownson'a Quarterly Review of Roman
schools, I hereby respectfully submit the lol
lowing:
Thus, the Catholic World for January, 1870,
having spoken in defense of "the public grants
to certain Catholic schools" in New York, says;
Give us either schools to which we can send our
children, or divide the schools equitably between
holies and l*rotestans, and we will solicit no
special grants of the sort. We are opposed to the
common schools as they are, because our church
condemns them; but if Protestants want them for
themselves they can have them. We do not ap
prove the system even for them, any more than we
do heresy and schism, which we account "deadly
Fins"; but if they insist on having godless schools
for their children, they can have tnem; we cannot
hinder them. The system might be modified so
that we could accept it: but it depends on them so
to modify it or not, for they have the power.
The same, in the number for April, 1870.
speaks thus;
The difference between Catholics and Protest
ants is not a difference in details or particulars
only, but a difference in principle. Catholicity
must be taught as a whole, in its unity and its In
tegrity, or not taught at all. It must everywhere
be all or nothing.
The tame, in opposing the plan of National
education advocated by United States Senator
Henry Wilson oi Massachusetts, and others,
Eays, April, 1871:
As there is for t:s Catholics only one church,
there is and can be no proper education for us not
given by or under the direction and control of the
Catholic church.
The New York Tablet of November 20, 1869,
speaking of the vote of the School Board of
Cincinnati "to exclude the Bible and all re
ligious instruction from the public schools of
the city," says:
If this has been done with a view of reconciling
Catholics io the common school system, its pur
pose will not be realized. Jt does not meet nor In
any decree lesaea <>nr Objection to the public school
system, and only proves the impracticability of
i hat system in a mixed community of Catholics and
Protestants: for ii proves that the schools must,
to be snrtf Inffl. become thoroughly godless. But
to us godless schools are st ill !â¢ , i t . than

The same newspaper, tinder date of Novem
-I>H9, proposes that the prevalent sys
tem of public schools for all the children at
the public expense be thus modified in respect
to the Roman Catnolics:
Appropriate t o the support of Catholic schools
the proportion of the public money according to
the number of children they educate! and leave the
of teachers, the studies, the discipline,
the whole interim, manacement, to the Catholic
educational authorities, and yon may, in all other
-. in all prudential matters, let tbem remain
as now. under public control and management, and
fmhlic boards, regents, commissioners and trustees,
f you will.
It says abo December 25, 1869:
We hold education to be a function of the church,
not of the stutc, and In our >hm- we do noi and will
not accept the state as edni not.

The Catholic solution of this muddle about
Bible or no Dibit in schools is, 'Hands off !" No
si ate taxation or donation for any schools. You

Cardinal C'ullen, ivho is Archbishop of Dub
lin, Jroland, issued a pastoral letter to his
clergy before the meeting of the Vaticiin Coun
cil, a f-ynopsis of which is published in The
Pilot of* Boston, June 4, 1870. In this letter
he opposes "common, united and unssecturian
instructions" in schools as "a godless system
of education," and continues:
It in evidently our duty, without interfering
with others, to jus.st on obtaining Catholic (ChooU,
lower and middle, for Catholic children, and also
Catholic colleges and universities for the more ad
vanced stages of youth. While Protestants have
schools and colleges and universities, richly en
dowed by the public, for themselves, we cannot be
satisfied or consider ourselves fairly treated unless
similar privileges are granted to us.
The Catholic World for April, 1871, says:
Education Is the American hobby â regarded, as
uneducated and poorly educated people usually re
gard it, as a sort of panacea for all the ills that
flesh is heir to. We. ourselves, as Catholics, are as
decidedly as any other class of American citizens
In favor of universal education as thorough and
extensive as possibleâ lf Its quality suits us. We
do not, indeed, prize so highly as some of our coun
trymen appear to do the simple ability to read,
write and cipher. Some men are born to be leaders
and the rest are born to be led. The best ordered
and administered state is that In which the few
are well educated and lead, and the many are born
to obedience, are willing to be directed, content to
follow, and do not aspire to he leaders. In extend
ing education and endeavoring to train all to be
leaders we have only extended presumption, con
ceit, indocility, and brought incapacity to the sur
face.
We believe the peasantry In old Catholic coun
tries two centuries ago were better educated,
although for the most part unable to read or write,
than are the great body of the American people to
day. They had faith, they had morality, they had
a sense of religion, they were instructed in the
great principles and essential truths of the Gospel,
were trained to be wise unto salvation. ana they
had the virtues. Without winch wise, stableand
efficient government is impracticable. We henrli
B&Id, or rather read in the journals, that the supe
riority the Prussian troops have shown to tiie
French is due to their superior education. We do
not believe a word of it. We have seen no evi
dence that the French common soldiers are not as
well educated and as intelligent as the Prussian,
The superiority is due to the fact that the Prussian
oftict-rs were hotter educated in their profession,
were less overweening In their confidence of vic
tory, and maintained better and severer discipline
in their armies than the French officers.
The Northern armies In our recent Civil War
had no advantage in the superior education of the
rank and lile over the Southern armies, where
both were equally well officered and commanded.
Hood officers, with an able general at their head,
can make an efficient army out of almost any ma
terials, For the.great, mass of the people the edu
cation needed is not secular education, which
simply sharpens the intellect and generates pride
and presumption, but moral and religious educa
tion, which trains up children in the way they
should go and teaches them to be honest and loyal,
modest and unpretending, docile and respectful to
their superiors, open and Ingenuous, obedient and
submissive to rightful authority, parental or con
jugal, civil and ecclesiastical; to know and keep
the commandments of God and the precepts of the
church and to place the salvation of the soul be
fore all else in life. This sort of education can be
given only by the church or under her direction
and control, and. as there is for us Catholics only
one church, there is and can be no proper educa
tion for us not given by or under the direction and
control of the Catholic church.
Orestes A. Brownson, LL.D., has been a lead
ing champion of the Roman Catholic church
since he joined it in 1844. "Brownson's
Quarterly Review' 1 ably defined the Roman
Catholic doctrine for about twenty years from
1844 onward, was indorsed by all the bishops
and was regularly republished in London. In
the number for January, lStiU, it spoke thus on
the quality of the Roman Catholic schools and
colleges:
They practically fail to recognize human prog
ress. As far as we are able to trace the effect of
tin- most approved Catholic education of our '!.iy,
whether at home or abroad, it tends to repress
rather than quicken the life of the pupil, to untit
rather than to prepare him for the active and
zealous discharge either of his religious or social '
duties. They who are educated in (vir schools j
seem misplaced and mistimed in the world, as if born
and educated for a world that has ceased to exist.
Comparatively few of them (Catholic graduates)
take their stand as scholars or as men on a level
u::h the Catholics of non-Catholic colleges, and
those nho do take that stand do it by throwing
aside nearly all they learned from their alma ma
ter and adopting the ideas and principles, the
modes of thought and action they find in the gen
eral civilization of the country in which they live.
The cause of the failure of what we call Catholic
education is. in our judgment, in the fact that we
educate not for the present or the future, but for
the past. We do not mean that the dogmas are
not scrupulously taught In all oar schools and col
leges, nor that the words of the catechism are not
duly insisted upon. We conceae this, ana that
gives :o our so-called Catholic schools a merit :
which no others have or cun have.
There can be no question that what passes fnr
Catholic education in this, or any other, country ,
has its ideal of perfection in the past, and that ft j
resists as un- 'atholic. irreligious and opposed to'
God the tendencies of modern civilization. The
work I', gives its subjects or prepares them to per
form is not the work of carrying it forward, hut
that of resisting it, driving it back, anatnemlxing
it as war with the gospel and either of neglecting it
altogether or taking refuge in a cioister, in an ex
; c^> rated Bscetlctom, always bordering on immor
ality, or of restoring a former order of civilization, !
no longer a living ord^r. and which humanity Has
evidently left behind and is resolved shall never be
restored.

FRESNO ORANGES.
Dr. E. C. Dunn States Finer Fruit Can
Be Raised There Than in Southern
California.
Dr. E. C. Dunn, one of the leading phy
sicians of Fresno, and a member of the j
joint committee of ten consisting of dele
gates from the Chamber of Commerce and
the Hundred Thousand Club, said last |
evening while speaking of the prosperous j
condition of things in and about that city: j
"The people of Fresno have learned a
great deal during the citrus fair held there, i
We find that we can raise as good oranges i
as are raised in Southern California. Not
only as uood, but we can place them on |
the market at least four days earlier than j
the Southern fruit. The orange of the |
southern part of the State is nearly always j
scale-covered, but our fruit is entirely free !
from scale.
"The citrus fair has proved a remark- ,
able success, far beyond the ideas of the
promoters. It has been a surprise to the !
people of Fresno as well as a source of ed- j
ucation to them. There is no question in
the world but that the citrus fair has come
to stay.
"We believe from the experience of the
past few years that the raisin industry i
will be a success, which at present it must
be confessed it is not.
"The introduction of electric power into
the city win prove a potent factor in in
creasing the city's importance. One com
pany that has the matter in hand expects
to furnish all the illuminating for the city,
and it will only be a short time before the
street cars will obtain their motive power â 
from the same source.
"The poles are being put in now and by
the latter end of this month everything
will been in working order for transmit
ting power.
"The joint committee of ten in the in
terests of tho Valley road has purchased
already over $20,000 worth of property for
depot sites an* l switching yards. Our re
lationswith the railroad board of directors
have been very harmonious and the feeling
is widespread that the road is a bona-fide
competition and that no danger exists of
the Southern Pacific's ever possessing it."
BE-ELECT OFFICERS.
The Butchers' Hoard of Trade Shows Its
Appreciation of Faithfully Per

The old officers of the Butchers' Board
of Trade were unanimously re-elected to
their various offices at the annual meeting
Tuesday night. There were ;512 members
present. President Sam C. Hammond was
not of the number, as he wanted to give
the organization every opportunity to put
another man in the place he has hlled for
the last three years.
The election of officers was no sooner
announced than a dozen men were on their
feet placing Mr. Hammond in nomination.
There was no one else named and he was
declared elected by acclamation. The same

steps were taken with the others. The
officers chosen were:
Sam C. Hammond, president; H. H. Thomp
son, first-vice prcsid-ent; J. \V. Phillips, second
vice-president; S. Silverberg, treasurer; B. J.
Horn, recording secretary; H. C. Flageolot,

ant marshal; K. J. Turner, assistant secre
tary.
Seven new members from Alameda
County were initiated. This leaves only
eleven butchers in that county not in the
association. There are now but thirty-two
butchers in this City who do not belong to
the Butchers' Board of Trade.
It was decided to have a committee of
seven wholesale butchers, to be appointed
by the president, confer with the Board
of Health as to what butchers should ask
of the Supervisors in order to place
Butchertown in a sanitary condition. At
present, the offal from ' the slaughter
houses is dropped into the bay near the
shore and drifts to and fro with the tide,
causing unpleasant odors. They think a
sewer emptying far out in the bay would
remedy this. â

Presiding Justice of the Peace Frank H.
Kerrigan.
[From a photograph.]
Justice of the Peace Frank H. Kerrigan
will preside over the Justice Courts for the
next five months, having been elected yes
terday afternoon by a unanimous vote of
his confreres.
The question of who should receive the
honor and emoluments which have been
held by Justice Barry for the past year
has been the source of acrimonious debate
since January 1, the date on which it was
expected that the incumbent would step |
down. No settlement was reached until
yesterday, when a combination was
reached by which Justice Barry agreed to ;
resign and permit the selection of his suc
cessor.
It was decided that Justice Kerrigan
should receive the office for five months,
at the end of which period the mantle will j
be transferred to the shoulders of Justice 1
Groezinger, who will wear it seven months, ;
or until the end of the term tor which the
present Justices were elected.
An agreement by which the marriage
business â one of the fat plums in a Jus
tice's career â is to be more evenly divided
in the future was also reached, and now
there is peace and a love feast where strife
and discord reigned.
Justice Kerrigan is' popular, and one of
youngest of the Justices. His election to
the office was his first entrance into the
field of politics, in which he bids fair to
become a shining light, as he is prominent
in the bicycle world and an advocate of
good roads.
