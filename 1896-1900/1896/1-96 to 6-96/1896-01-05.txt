Dr. Jameson arrived near Krugersdorp on

The Government I ,1 the fol
lowing dispatch from Cape Town, dated
at noon to-day :
"Jameson surrendered at 2 o'clock on
the afternoon of the 1M inst. The actual
fightine lasted from 3 o'clock in the after
noon of the Ist until 11 at night. Jameson
made three attacks. The men behaved in
the most gallant manner. The Boers at
tacked the an^le of Jameson's forces and
had a fire on his front and flank."
A private me sage received to-day -ays
that President Ivruger of the Hout:
can republic has declared his willii,
to make a satisfactory concession to the
demands of the I'itlanders. The
reports say that eighty of Jameson's fol
lowers were killed. The excitement in
Johannesburg is subsiding and the citi
zens are disarming.
A deputation of merchants interested
in the South African trade to-day visited
Colonial Secretary Chamberlain in con
nection with the troubles m the
Transvaal. Replying to the represen
tations made to him by the depu
tation Mr. Chamberlain saM that the
probability of further disturbances was
remote. The Government, he added, sym
pathized with the undoubted grievances of
the Inlanders, though wJiat had recently
occurred made the situation difficult, f^till
he hoped that friendly representations to
the Transvaal Government would be suc
cessful.
Referring to the invasion of the Trans
vaal by Dr. Jameson, he said the Govern
ment bad done its <luty and nothing more.
The Government would adhere to its obli
gations under the convention of 1884 and
would uphold that convention in all its
provisions. From this position nothing
had occurred to induce the Government to
recede.
The Berlin correspondent of the Central
N'-ws claims to have authority for the
statement that negotiations are in progress
between several powers relative to the
taking of joint steps, especially in the
event of the Transvaal, repudiating the
Anglo-Boer convention. The correspond
ent adds that the Germans interested
will claim damaces from the telegraph

DUPED BY A CLEVER FORGER.
St. Paul and Minneapolis Banks Swindled
Out of Ten Thousand
Dollars.
ST. PAUL, Miss., Jan. 4.â For three
weeks the banks of St. Paul and Minneap
olis have suppressed the fact that a re
markably clover forger lias circulated
among them and has departed hence with
his pocket lined with coin to the extent of
over $10,000. While operating in this city
the forger was known by several names.
The one that he assumed in dealirg with
the Union Bank was Escb. Another one
of his aliases was Charles R. Rhodes. He
made his first appearance in the Twin
Cities something over a month a<ro and
opened small accounts at a number of
banks of both towns. His forgeries were
in the majority of cases accomplished by
means of a bank cashier's certification
stamp. This was the case with the Onion
and Commercial paper. The man had
taken a blank check on the Northern Ex
change, tilled it out as he desired and put
on the stamp of certification with Cashier
Adolph Gallasch's signature. The forged
signature of the maker was that of a de
positor of the Northern Exchange BanK.
The checks were then passed at the Union
and Exchange banks. Esch said he de
sired to place a part of the amount on de
posit. He drew out almost the full amount
of the check, however, and this was his
course at all of the banks.

HAVANA, Ccba, Jan. 4. â It is reported
that a battle was fought to-day near Colon
in which the Spanish troops suffered
heavy loss.
The insurgents gained the position
which commands Havana, and it is said
that they will have the city inside of
twenty-four hours.
The insurgents also captured 3000 Span
ish artillerymen. It is said General Oliver
was killed and General Campos seriously
wounded.
The latest news from the front is that
the Cubans captured GuineÃ last night,
cutting communication between the main
forces of Campos' army and Havana.
The heights around this city are being
hurriedly fortified and new garrisons have
been established at Jesus del Monte, Ma
riana and other stragetic suburban out
posts to prevent the Cubans from cutting
off the water supply.
A strong guard has also been placed to
protect the gas works from the emissaries
of the Cubans, who are suspected of a pur
pose to cripple the plant and leave the
city in darkness.
The track of the Havana and Matanzas
Railway was torn up last night between
Bainao and Aguacate, in the vicinity of
which town 1000 Cuban cavalry were en
camped this morning. Families living in
the country are rushing to this city.
General Arderius to-day sent troops to
fortify Bainao, beyond which point traffic
is suspended. The cane fields in the vi
cinity are all burning.
Fort Victoria, near Sagua La Grande,
yesterday surrendered to the Cuban forces
without, firing a shot.
Intense excitement prevailed in the city
last night. Wild rumors emanating from
the palace were circulated, but the Gov
ernment officials dni I anything
unusual had happened.
It was learned, however, that strict
orders had come from Madrid to suppress
all unfavorable reports, and, as a conse
quence, no messages, even to the Madrid
papers, were allowed tc go out.

at Victor.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Jan. 4.â
News comes from Cripple Creek that there
has been a good deal of trouble near Victor
over the jumping of the Conejos claim.
It seems that in August last certain parties
claimed the assessment work on the prop
erty was not done in 1593 and staked a new
claim on the ground. Ever since Decem
ber 31 100 men armed with Winchesters,
under the command of John Calderwood,
president of the miners' union, and Mar
shall Bell, have held forcible possession of
the property and have'stopped all work on
the part of the owners, who have driven
men off who tried tv do the work.
An injunction will be applied for to
restrain the would-be jumpers. More
trouble will probably occur.

READY FOR BUSINESS
Brewer Elected President
of the Venezuelan
Commission.
FIRST MEETING HELD-
All of the Members Were in
Attendance Except Mr.
White.
GIVEN THEIR CERTIFICATES.
The Investigators Will Proceed With
the Work and Report With
out Delay.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 24.â The
Venezuelan commission met at 11 o'clock
this morning in the diplomatic room of
the Department of State. Messrs. Cou
dert, Brewer, Alvey and Gilman were
in attendance. Mr. White is absent and is
not expected to join the commission until
next week. The four commissioners re
mained with Secretary Olney for half an
hour discussing routine matters pertaining
to their origin. Mr. Olney did not partici
pate in any of the work of the commission,
and when the commissioners emerged
from his office into the diplomatic room he
remained behind.
Each member of the tribunal, with the
exception of Professor Whit", received his
formal certificate of appointment from the
President to-day. The form of this cre
dential is peculiar and extremely explicit,
urging the commissioners to proceed with
out delay, pointing out rules for their
government and noting that the report
must be made to the President. The sub
stance of the credential is as follows:
â¢'You are hereby appointed a member of
the commission to investigate and report
upon the true location of the divisional
line between the territory of the republic
of Venezuela and that of British Guiana.."
It is expected that the commission will
avail itself of all possible sources of infor
mation, will apply to the matter all perti
nent rules of municipal and international
law, and will make a report to the Presi
dent of their conclusions, together with the
evidence and documents submitted to and
i received by them with as little delay as is
compatiDle with the thorough and impar
tial consideration of the subject to be dealt
with.
Upon assembling in the diplomatic room
the commissioners immediately proceeded
| to the selection of a presiding officer, who
I will hereafter be designated as president.
As was expected, Justice Brewer was
chosen unanimously.
President Brewer proceeded to adminis
ter the oath of office to the other commis
sioners, and Commissioner Alvey acted in
a like capacity for the president.
A motion to designate a clerk to act for
the present temporary session of the com
mission was adopted, and J. "Walter Blan
ford, private secretary of the Secretary of
State, was accordingly designated.
Commissioner G-ilman moved that an
inquiry be made as to the best map show
ing the physical characteristics of the
country in question, and whether it could
be reproduced in convenient form for the I
use of the commission. This was adopted
and the committee authorized Commis
sioner Gilman to make such an inquiry.
This concluded all business for the pres
ent, and the commission adjourned to
meet on Saturday next, January 11, unless
the Dresident of the commission chose to
select another date, in tiie diplomatic
room of the Department of State.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 4.â The Her

his views upon English aggression beyond

ERASTUS WIMAIf TAZKS.
T/ie Aged Financier Favors the Monroe
Doctrine.
NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 4.-Erastus
Wiman, who appeared as a public speaker
for the first time since his vindication by
the courts, addressed to-night, the Charles
town Association, a group of West Vir
ginians that yearly dine together at the
"Arena," on Thirty-first street.
Intb"! course of his remarks Wiman re
ferred to the Monroe doctrine and the
Venezuelan boundary question, and said :
"It is on record that before President
Monroe announced his famous postulate
Thomas Jefferson had been consulted, and
in a remarkable letter he had replied that
the adhesion to this principle was the most
momentous which had been offered to his
contemplation since the Declaration of In
dependence."
Mr. Wiman said that as a British sub
ject it was hardly to be expected he could
at first blush advocate it. Yet the sober
second thought, about which we now hear
so much, had brought him to the conclu
sion that there was no principle for which
the United States could more righteously
contend and there was no danger which
these free people might not incur to en
force it. But in encouragement there need
not be conflict with Great Britain. If the
English people were right in their conten
tion England wanted no more than she
was entitled to on the one hand, and on
the other the United States was willing
that all she was entitled to should be
awarded to her.
It may be difficult to justify the bellig
erent attitude of the President in a moment
of profound peace, and it may be almost
as difficult to justify the refusal to settle a
subtle claim in a remote wilderness by the
simple means of referring it to disinter
ested friends. But intelligent and com
prehensive investigation, as proposed by
the United States, was certainly the only
way in which to beget the removal of all
cause of difference between two nations so
bound up together that they could not
light where one only wants what it is en
titled to and the other is ready to grant it.

OF LOBBYISTS.

FOR THE FUNDING BILL.
Fine Manipulation in the Selec*

Pacific Roads.
INFLUENCES THAT ARE BINDING
Representative Maguire Tells How
the Interests of the People
Are Handicapped.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 4.âRepre
sentative Maguire said to The Call corre
spondent to-night:
"It is well understood that there is a
strong force of railroad lobyists here
ostensibly promoting the passage of the
pooling bill which was defeated in tee last
Congress. They are also doing active and
effective work in promoting the passage of
the funding bill. They have thus far suc
ceeded in gaining every point for which
they have contended, namely, the appoint
ment of Pacilic railroad committees
strongly favorable to refunding in both
the Senate and House and the exclusion
of anti-funding men from both committees.
The Senate Committee on Pacific Rail
roads is, if possible, more strongly favor
able to refunding than the House com
mittee. Davis of Minnesota, as haa pre
viously been stated, was the author of the
first and worst of all funding bills. Brice
is a director of the Union Pacific Railroad,
and he has never hesitated on account of
any moral and political consideration to
fight for every possible advantage to the
Pacific railroads, without any regard to the
effect on any public interests.
"Senator Frye has been for years an ad
vocate of refunding and of all other de
mands made by the Pacific railroad com
bine. If Senator Stewart has ever failed
or refused to support any of their schemes
I have not heard of it. With Gear of
lowa, a strong supporter of the Keilly bill
in the last Congress, as chairman, this
committee constitutes a railroad wall of
stone which will be immovable so far aa
the action and influence of the com
mittee is concerned. I do not know
that their report will be unanimously in
favor of the funding bill, but I imagine
that opposition, if any, will be extremely
weak.
"There are all sorts of rumors about
Washington of political promises made by
railroad people to friends of candidates for
the Presidency in consideration of the
'packing' of these committees, and it does
certainly look bad from that point of view
for the men who had the selection of the
committees. The right against refunding
must therefore be made in both houses on
the floor, and practically against the whole
committee in each house.
"My impression is that the railroad peo
ple have overdone their work up to this
time. They have put us in a position to
very conclusively discredit beiore the com
mittee and to destroy their prestige, which
is the greatest force behind a committee
when it presents and supports a measure
on the floor. The presumption is gen
erally that the committee has been honest
and impartial; that it has made a more
thorough investigation of any question
committed to it than other members of
the House can possibly make, and that
the impartial judgment of the majority of
the committee is a safer guide than the
more crudely formed opinions of other
members. These committees will have no
such prestige. They are already branded
as the spawn of conspiracy, in favor of
railroad interests and against public in
terests.
"No investigation or report which either
committee can make will be for a moment
considered impartially or worthy of credit.
I am therefore encouraged to believe that
the railroad successes already won in star
chamber proceedings, out of which the
committees come, do not indicate the
strength of the Pacific Railroad Commis
sion in either the House or Senate, and
that a determined fight in both houses
may defeat their scheme.
"The work of Huntington's men against
an application for San Pedro harbor is
being quietly done, but it is well under
stood that they are determined that tha
application shall De for Santa Monica
harbor or that none shall be made.
"What Mr. Huntington is doing against
the Nicaragua Canaf I don't know. The

committees in both the House and Senate
that have jurisdiction of the Nicaragua
canal matter are understood to be pro-
disposed against it. By a curious coin
cidence it happens that the chairman of
the Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee, which has charge of the
matter in the House, is the second mem
ber of the Pacific Railroads Committee
and a strong advocate of the funding bill;
while the chairma"n of the Committee on
Commerce in the Senate, Mr. Frye, is a
member of the Committee on Pacific
Railroads in that body and is one of the
men relied on by Huntington to make the
light for the funding bill.
"It is a striking circumstance that the
funding bill supporters in both houses are
thus related to other important matters of
legislation in which the Southern Pacific
combination is interested. Of course, an
adverse report of the Committee on Inter
state and Foreign Commerce in the House
or of the Committee on Commerce in the
Senate in the Nicaragua Canal proposition
would be practically conclusive. It would
be impossible to overcome such a report.
The same is true of a report from the Com
mittee on Rivers and Harbors of the House
or of the Committee on Commerce of the
Senate against an application for improve
ment of any harbor or waterway."
Maguire'a observations coincide with
those of others here who have been watch
ing the maneuvers of Huntington and his
lobbyists. The Call correspondent, dur
ing the last Congress, secured a copy of a
telegram which Huntingdon s-cnt to Frye,
opposing an appropriation for a deep har
bor at San Pedro and favoring Santa Mon
ica, where the Southern Pacific has built
wharves.
Senator Jones of Nevada, who, as is
well known in California, has large landed
interests at Santa Monica, was in com
munication with Huntington. Frye and
Jones were both members of the Com
merce Committee, which has bucq pro
jects to report upon, and boili Joues and
Frye were active on the floor of the Sen
ate, milling wires for Santa Monica. Jones
proposed a resolution to send the Commit
tee on Comfherce on a junket to the Pacitic
Coast, and proposed to entertain them at
his Santa Monica ranch. The res-olution
passed, but several members of the com
mittee refused to go, evidently fearing
that a scandal might be attached to their
tup.
Huntington is again working to secure
an appropriation for Santa Monica. His
agent here, John Bovd, has filed with the
Commerce Committee a report of Southern
Pacific Engineer Hood in which he en
deavors to show that Santa Monica is
much better adapted for a. deep harbor
than Sin Pedro. This is an attempt to
counteract the effect of reports made by
two different boards of United States en
gineers in favor of tan Pedro as against
bant* Monica.
The Call correspondent has entrusted
to Maguire evidence tending to show th.it
Huntington, through his Rgenta here, has
brought questionable influence to bear
upon land officials of the Government to
expedite railroad patents. His agents here
have used money to influence subordinates
employed in land ofiice-<. One of the par
ties, who was not paid what he was prom
ised, is willing to offer testimony when the
time comes, which will place Mr. Hunting
ton's men in very bad light.
A resolution will probably be introduced
in Congress calling for an investigation and
directing the Attorney-General to bring a
suit to set aside patents secured by roch
means. The Tail correspondent has in
his possession documents in writing show
ing that, a Land Department clerk made a
proposition t<> the railroad that he would
resign his Government position and accept
money from the railroad to make correc
tions in land selections, which had not
been specified, tract for tract, according to
departmental regulations. This Govern
ment clerk did the work and secured the
assistance of another clerk in the Land
Office by paying him money. They also
paid money to the son of Commissioner
Stone, the former Commissioner of the
Land Office, hoping thereby to secure the
aid of Commissioner Stone himself.
AH?IIKA.L BUXC&a SQUAIiROS.
Much Speculation Concerning Its Future
Sloveinents.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 3.â The de
tention of Admiral Bunce's squadron at
Hampton Roads for the last two weeks,
although it was ready to commence its
cruise promptly on December 21, accord
ing to the programme laid down by Secre
tary Herbert, was at first generally sup
posed to be due to a reluctance on the part
of the administration to permit even the
Implied menace of its presence in the West
Indies during the excitement following the
President's Venezuelan message to Con
gress of December 16. The explanation
was plausible enough to satisfy every one
lor several days. Now even the command
ing officers of the ships forming the fleet
are beginning to be mystified by the pro
longed delay.
Such absence of information about a
squadron's movements is said to be un
precedented in times of peace, and espe
cially when its daily itinerary for the en-
Buing ftve months had been published and
as the wives and other relatives of many
of the officers had made engagements to
meet the vessels at several ports where
they would rendezvous for several days'
stay. There is considerable concern lest
the meetings will be rendered altogether
impossible.
Driven to speculation all sorts of rumors
â¢re in circulation about the ships accord
ing to letters received here, and the latest
of these, which is not wholly without be
lievers even in the Navy Department,
proceeds on the assumption that Admiral
Bunce has sealed orders which may at any
moment send him with his entire fleet to
the Bosphorus.
Even the more conservative officers are
disposed to attach some credence to the
idea, modifying it, however, to the opinion
that Gibraltar or the Azores may be the
lirst stopping place of the squadron after
leaving the Chesapeake, instead of St.
Thomas, West Indies. There are a num
ber of significant facts which, grouped to
gether, seem to give probability to the
rumor.
Admiral Selfridge and Minister Terrell
have been sending a good many cable
grams to Washington in the last three
weeks and the State and Navy depart
ments have spared no expense in cable
bills biuce early in December.
On December 21 it was announced that
a dispatch of general instructions had been
sent to Admiral Self ridge to furnish all
protection and comfort to such mission
aries as might apply, and almost simul
taneously came the press dispatch from
Turkey that Admiral Selfridge had cabled
the Navy Department that he was unable
to carry out his instructions, whatever
they were, because of insufficient force.
The following day Admiral Bunce came to
Washington and had a long interview
with Secretary Herbert, after which the
Secretary said that the time of the fleet's
departure was indefinite. Some of Ad
miral Bunce's subordinates now think that
Secretary Herbert gave the admiral sealed
instructions at the last interview, which
were only to be opened at sea under agreed
conditions. These conditions, if tlm be
go, would, of course, depend upon further
aMvisss fxyfi. 3&fiister Terrell, ,

SALT LAKE, Utah, Jan. 4.â The news
received this morning that President
Cleveland had signed the State proclama
tion for Utah was the occasion of great
demonstrations of joy. Public buildings
and places of business are decorated and
flags and bunting iloat in the breeze every
where. Governor West was the recipient
of numerous congratulatory telegrams
from every quarter of the Nation.
The day was observed as a partial holi
day, and the people smilea and congratu
lated each other as happy as children with
a new toy. Cannons were fired, bells rung
and whistles blown for hours, and similar
demonstrations were made in every town
and village in the State.
On Monday the new State officers will be
inaugurated, arid the Governor has pro
claimed a general holiday. There will be
military displays, children's parade, patri
otic orations, an inaugural address by the
Governor and other exercises, closing with
a grand ball and fireworks in the evening.
The State Legislature is called to meet
in special session and will convene at 2
p. m. on Monday.
The Senatorial fight is growing warmer
daily. Arthur Brown's prospects are im
proving, and C. S. Varian's stock has also
advanced the past few days. A new can
didate, and one who will be quite a factor,
is Philo Farnsworth. Ex-Congreasman
Frank Cannon is generally considered out
of the race, it being conceded that he will
give place to his father, George Q. Can
non, who. without doubt, wants the office,
and anything that George Q. Cannon
wants in Utah he generally gpts. The
other strongest man in the race is Colonel
Isaac Trumbo, who, in addition to a good
share of the Gentile support, has, it is
understood, the support of the leading
Mormon Church officials, including that of
George Q. Cannon, who thinks Trumbo
wonld be a fitting colleague for himself in
the Senate.

PERISHED IN THE SMOKE
Two Persons Met Death and
Four Were Injured Dur
ing a Fire.
Miraculous Escape of Twenty Men
and Six Children From the
Flames.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Jan. 4. -A fire
which swept through a combined store,
hall and tenement four-story brick struct
ure at the corner of Third and Gaskiil
3treets this afternoon resulted in the death
of two men and the serious injury of four
others, all Polish Jews. The escape of at
least twenty men and six children, all of
whom were penned in by the flames, was
little short of miraculous. The money loss
is about $5000.
The dead : Harris Levi, aged 45 years,
suffocated; Marks Feinberg, aeed 30 years,
spine fractured and internally injured,
died at the hospital.
The injured arÂ«: Jacob Venisky, aged 22
years; Lewis Veirkman, *ged 38 years;
David Kolinsky, aged 38; Bernard Baibin
sky, aged 23.
The fire is supposed to have been started
by a lighted match being thrown care
lessly into the cellar by an unknown per
son and which landed among some oil
barrels. In an instant the cellar was a
mass of flames and the tire quickly spread.
A score of tailors had been holding a
meeting on the third floor, and when the
building became enveloped in flames the
men made a wild rush to escape by the
stairway. The smoke forced them "back
and then they ran to the windows.
One of the number jumped from a window
and crashed through a canvas awning.
He landed on the sidewalk but little hurt.
This actuated a dozen others to jump, the
awning also breaking their fall.
By this time the awning was torn so
badly that it offered but little resistance to
the jumpers, and when Jacob Veniaky
plunged downward, head first, he want
through the canvass and struck on the
sidewalK with terrific force. Levi remained
in the center window screaming for help
and apparently afraid to jump. Suddenly
he fell back into the building ana was suf
focated. Feinberg went to a rear room
and hung from a window-sill, begging the
crowd to save him. The crowd tried to
build a pyramid of barrels, but the heat
caused the man to release his hold and he
fell, striking the back of his neck on a bar
rel. The force of the fall wedged his body
in a barrel, and he was breathing his last
when released.
Jennie Sellers, aged 16 years, saved the
life of herself and her five brothers and
sisters by going to the roof and dropping
them to the roofs of adjoining buildings,
ttie children finally reaching the ground.

LONDON, Eng., Jan. 4.â Since England
breathlessly followed the bloody progress
of the British relief expedition up the
Nile toward Khartoum, eleven years ago,
I have witnessed no such universal popu
lar excitement as has reigned in London
in these opening days of the new year.
No matter how deeply opinions may dif
fer on the rights and wrongs of the Trans
vaal business,|there is no doubt that every
body high and low is profoundly stirred
up about it. It would be an easy enough
matter to satirize the English attitude
toward this extraordinary and probably
momentous catastrophe and to give an air
of epigram to numerous commonplaces
about English greed, pertidy and the rest
in which the whole Continental press is
reveling delightedly. But that would be
to beg entirely the true character of the
episode. What is really to be seen in it is
a strange survival of the original processes
by which the British empire was created,
suddenly revealed and expounded to peo
ple five generations removed from the
knowledge of them by the magical opera
tion of modern electrical science. If Eng
land 140 years ago could have followed
Lord Clive with a telegraph wire British
India would have never existed.
Englishmen now, while they curse the
inexplicable block in the communications
which kept thtun for forty-eight hours
without news from Johannesburg, dimly
understand that they are witnessing some
thing to which they are ancestrally related,
but which they thought had been dead
and buried for a century or so. Their
judgment commands that they should dis
approve it sternly, but all the inherited
impulses of their blood impel them to
cheer and wave their hats. It is a genuine
conflict between their respectable modern
civilization and the old Berserker island
instincts in their veins. If they were left
alone there would be no doubt as to the
result of the struggle. The nineteenth
century would win, and in their calmer
mood they would see to it, as in 1880, that
the Boers had scrupulous justice dealt to
them.
But unhappily the German Emperor,
who is too much of an Englishman to
mind his own business and too much ol
a Prussian to understand what tact means,
leaps into the middle of this perplexing
situation with drawn sword and infuriates
everybody.
Yesterday sfven-eighths of thinking
England were against Cecil Rhodes and
his South African dummy company, and
were glad to hear that Dr. Jameson and his
filibusters had been soundly whipped by
the Boers, but last evening when the
terms of the German Emperor's insolent
dispatch reached London this mood began
to change as the newspapers could spread
the news. To-day, while nobody has
altered his mind specifically about l>r.
Jameson's part of the affair, nobody
speaks or thinks of Germany's interference
without an angry glisten in the eye.
Every aspect of this imperial message,
upon examination, reveals a fresh ground
for wratii.
If it were intended to enrage England
on as many sides as possible, it is a
triumph of ingenuity. Its rejoicing that
English blood has been spilled, its refer
ence to friendly powers which would have
intervened if President Krugcr had asked
them, its c*lm denial of England's
suzerain treaty rights, the fact that it was
sent alter an imperial council at the
Foreign Office, in which naval members
ostentatiously predominated â all these
give to it the character of a deliberate, in
tentional affront. No living Englishman
remembers any such other premeditated
slap in the face. What counsels second
thought may bring it is impossible to say,
but England to-night wants to fight Ger
many more passionately than she has de
sired anything else since the time of the
Georges.
To this violent climax has come then all
the last years of anxious and gingerly in
triguing for alliances in the troubled Con
tinental diplomacy. A year ago the Prince
of Wales thought that he had fastened
such hooks into his nephew, the young
and timid Czar, that nothing could shake
England's grip. He came back from St.
Petersburg elated by this belief and took
no pains to dissemble the presence in his
elation of the thought that he had out
witted that other nephew of his in Berlin,
that insufferable nephaw who read him
lectures on how princes should behave, but
he smiled too soon. Germany on the in
stant made overtures to France and
proposed a partnership with Russia as a
third in Chinese waters, which should shut
England out. Then she egged Russia and
France on to make Lord Rosebery's
Armenian intervention an empty sham.
Then when Lord Salisbury came into
power and rinding these two powers
hostile worked to get the triple alliance
also identified with intervention, Germany
took him at his word, came into the
European concert and made it immediately
an anti-English concert. To-day the or
ganization of Europe against England is
practically complete.
Even Italy, despite all its natural lean
ings, has been forced into the significant
step of intrusting the protection of the
Italians in the Transvaal to the German
Consul. These foreign considerations,
however, though recognized as weighty,
are subordinated in the public mind to
wonder at what the next step will be in
the battle royal between Joseph Chamber
lain and Cecil Rhodes.
As I pointed out at the time, Chamber
lain took the Colonial Office largely with
the view of trying a fall with this power
ful person, and in the first round of the
wrestle he has scored an extraordinary
victory, but it is a sort of triumph which
seems more embarrassing than flat
defeat.
k Fresiaent Krucger'a part iv tke buaiucs^.
has been one of uncanny cunning. Ever
since November the gathering of the Brit
ish South Africa Company's forces on the
frontier for a raid on the Transvaal has
been perfectly known at Pretoria, and
Krueger has helped it on by circulating
reports that General Joubertwas in Natal
on a holiday and that there was not a sin
gle Boer undei arms anywhere on the
Veldt. ,
This false news impelled the Johannes
burg crowd to give Jame-on the signal for
a forward rush. They promised to have
the Boers subjugated and the town in his
hands by the time he arrived. Then mys
teriously 2000 Boers rose up in Jameson's
path while a similar force appeared to ter
rorize the cowardly Johannesburg mob,
with the results that Jameson, Wilioughby,
White and all the officials of her ilaiesty
are in a Boer prison, and the flower of the
Rhodes mounted police is dead or in
chains. There is loud talk here of the
necessity of proving that Rhodes knew
what was going on. It may occur later to
somebody to inquire whether Chamberlain
also had not some premonition that when
Jameson made his break the Boers would
be there to meet it.
No one will be surprised to learn that
this flood of fiery excitement ha 3 clean
swept the Venezuelan affair out of public
consciousness. Just as Washington
roughly pushed Constantinople aside as
the center of British interest, so it is in
turn wholly obscured by Pretoria.
Ido not know that this is wholly a mis
fortune, because the sort of information
that Englishmen have been getting from
America did not serve as a basis for any
specially luminous meditation. But it is at
least to be regretted that national pre
occupation in Transvaal matters prevents
Henry Norman's admirable dispatches
from getting the attention tnat they de
serve. His complete, carefully fortified ex
position of the strictly abstract character
of the Scnomburg line has been received
here quite as a revelation. But far more
important, I conceive to be, is his success
in convincing some section of the English
public that the American people as a whole
feel deeply on this whole subject and stand
firm in support of the principle involved.
As I said a week ago, the most aggra
vating, mischievous feature of the entire
business hasbten the practical unanimity
with which the dispatches from New York
sneered at our President, extolled the
timidity of Wall street as an expression of
the best elements of our civilization and
reiterated tirelessly the suggestion that the
whole agitation was deliberately started by
knavish politicians and kept alive only by
the ignorant jingo rabble.
Norman's dispatches come like a burst
of sunshine throughout a fog to dispel this
dangerous, almost criminal delusion. The
effect would, as I have said, have been
vastly greater if everybody were not think
ing of something; but even as it is, you
find the Times to-day for the first time
cautiously admitting that a reopening of
the case, and an arbitration on some such
new basis as that proposed by Carl Schurz
are not wholly impossible. This marks a
notable change in what niay be called
England's official attitude.
Mention ought to be made too of a re
markably wise a:ul intelligent letter in the
Timeafrom Amyas Northcott of Chicago,
a young man who is evidently not a sev
enth son for nothing. It is by far the most
sensible message that any Englishman
among us has yet delivered to his coun
trymen at home, and I should think that
it also had its effect on the Times. At all
events English public opinion has been
fairly started on a new and helpful task.
And there are enough reasons for believing
that official action will be found following
along after it.
The chances that this American compli
cation and others in various parts of the
world will give rise to interesting party
debates and divisions when Parliament
meets next month have been somewhat
ieopardizod by Lord Rosebery's surpris
ingly insincere attackson Lord Salisbury's
conduct of the Armenian business. His
own party papers condemn them, and to
the general public they seem quite outside
the limits of recognized political contro
versy. This is a pity, because Salisbury
and Chamberlain, by calling no Cabinet
council since November, have undoubt
edly invited criticism as taking too much
on themselves through a period of such
difficulty and menace. Very likely this
criticism will find sober, weighty spokes
men in the House of Commons, but Lord
Rosebery's spiteful ineptitude has already
discounted its force with the community
at large.
In the crush and friction of larger events
little attention has been given to the fact
that Hungary is celebrating this year the
thousandth anniversary of the Magyar
conquest and settlement of Pannonia.
The Hungarians themselves began the
festival Wednesday and arc to keep it up
all the year, but the outside world's inter
est is claimed fdr the great exhibition to
be opened shortly at Budapest, which
will be unique in kind and more like a
national monument than a commercial
show. It would be impossible to exagger
ate the earnestness with which the whole
Magyar race have thrown themselves into
making of this exhibition a thing never to
be forgotten, and literally scores of thou
sand of adult Hungarians are working
tbis winter to learn foreign languages,
particularly English, in order to be able to
welcome and entertain the huge con
course of visitors that they fondly ex
pect. Their concentration on this one
idea is curiously shown by the Buda
pest press, which usually makes a
specialty of discussing foreign politics
with utmost freedom and vigor, but now
for months has been as dumb as an oyster
as if in dread to contribute a single hasty
word toward any misunderstanding which
might make mid-Europe available for
tourist traffic next summer.
With New Year's day the law went into
effect here, giving to magistrates sum
mary jurisdiction to grant sepaiation
orders to married women who have fled
from the home of a brutal nusband, with
the result that an inundation of complain
ing wives has quite swamped other busi
ness in the Police courts for the last two
days. The magistrates are already dis
mayed at the tast of winnowing wheat
from chaff in this swarm of appeals, and
are crying out against the imperfections in
the law, which really serves few of the
purposes that it aimed to do. The drunk
enness of wives among the London poor is
even a greater evil, so far as home is con
cerned, than the violence of husbands, but
this is left untouched, and it is evident
that the whole subject will have to be
dealt with in a new law.
In the Royal Academy winter exhibition
of the old masters, which were on private
view to-day, much comment is aroused by
the fact that an exceptional place of honor
has been given to a portrait of George
Washington by Gilbert Stuart, lent by
Lord Rosebery, which fairly dominates the
room.
Trinity House officials are holding an in
quiry to-day at Portsmouth on the conduct
cf the British pilot who ran the Spree on
Warden Ledge, inside the Needles. Tlie
vessel itself has completely recovered and
sailed for Bremen this morning.

JOY OF THE GERMANS.
Emperor William's Message
to Krueger Arouses
Enthusiasm.
HOSTILITY TO ENGLAND.
An Explanation Demanded of the
Bold Invasion of the
Transvaal.
MUST CEASE INTERFERENCE.
Otherwise Great Britain Will Become
Involved in a Collision With
the Fatherland.
BERLIN, Germany. Jan. 4.â The Em
peror's act in sending a message to Presi
dent Krueger of the South African Repub
lic, congratulating him upon the victory
of the Boers over the armed forces led into
the Transvaal by Dr. Jameson, adminis
trator of the British South Africa Com
pany, is hailed with enthusiasm th rough
out Germany, and will add greatly to his
Majesty's popularity, as being a true in
terpretation of the intensity of German
public hostility toward Great Britain.
The message of the Emperor could not
have been a very great surprise to the Eng
lish Government, as tome days prior to
the publication of the message the Em
peror instructed Count yon Hatzfcldt, the
German Emoassador to Great Britain, to
inform Lord Salisbury, with the utmost
frankness, that it was the firm determina
tion of Germany not to allow the Govern
ment of the South African Republic to be
overthrown.
At the same time Count yon Ilatafeldt
was instructed to demand an explanation
of the movements of the authorities of the
British South Africa Company. These
representations were immediately an
swered by the British Foreign Office. The
first replies made by Lord Salisbury were
deemed unsatisfactory ; so much so, in
deed, ttiat the relations of the two Govern
ments on "Wednesday became so strained
as to be on the point of absolute rupture.
The consequence was that a diplomatic
surrender on the part of Lord Salisbury
was the only thing that averted the gravest
climax. Even now, although the situation
is modified, it is not devoid of danger, and
the summaries of the comments of the
English press upon the Emperor's inter
ference in the Transvaal affair which are
published here serve to heighten the popu
lar anger against England, while the anti-
English feeling pervades all classes of the
German press. Every political party and
group, the Socialists included, sides with
the Boers and denounces ihe aggresion of
England.
The North German Gazette quotes with
expressions of approval the declaration of
tbe Cologne Gazette that the Transvaal
republic is an absolutely independent
state, and the Deutsche Tages-Zeitung
says that not only the road to Constanti
nople but also tbe road to Johannesburg
lies through Berlin. Several newspapers
with Government affiliations and inspira
tions concur in these expressions, and add
that the alliance between Russia and
France has been enlarged by the accession
of the Triple Alliance to a concert of Euro
pean powers with anti-English aims. A
number of papers are exulting in the iso
lation of England and predict that her
lonely situation will become an important
factor in the settlement of the Venezuelan
difficulty.
The youth, the brawn and sinew of Ger
many are moved to offer active assistance
to the Boers, while their elders are in
spired to tender moral and financial aid.
Dr. Carl Peters, the explorer, was charged
by the Deutsche Colonial Gesellschaft yes
terday to send a cablegram to President
Krueger of the Boer republic, expressing
the sympathy of the society with him and
his cause and promising active and mate
rial support. A private syndicate has
placed at the disposal of Dr. Peters the
sum of 300,000 marks for the purpose of
organizing a corps of volunteers to go to
the Transvaal, and simiiar offers have
been plentiful. Among other offers is
that of a number of young Americans
studying in Germany, who have expressed
their readiness to accept a chance to right
the British if a conflict in South Africa is
continued.
Trie sum of the position is that Great
Britain must withdraw her pretensions to
a right to interfere in the Transvaal and
pnnist) the leaders of the British South
Africa Company who are responsible for
the invasion of the Boer territory, or she
will inevitably become involved in a col
lision with Germany. A formal German
protectorate over the South African Repub
lic is not designed, but the Government of
Germany will support the Transvaal Re
public in declaring the convention of 1884
void, thus enabling the Boers to obtain
their full independence of Great Britain.
Virtually England's claim to suzerainty
over the Transvaal must in all respects, be
abolished. If the South African Republic
shall ask a reference of the matters in dis
pute between itself and England, the ques
tion will be referred to the European
powers which are interested in Africa, and
Germany will support such a conference.
France can be relied upon to take part,
and if a conference is had it will greatly
disappoint German expectation if the dis
cussion of the questions involved does not
result in recognition of the independence
not only of the Transvaal, but of the Orange
Free State as well.
It is not denied here that reform in the
administration of the internal affairs of
the South African Republic is advisable.but
these must be obtained without the appli
cation of foreign pressure, British or any
other, as strictly questions for internal set
tlement. Little or no sympathy is be
stowed upon Dr. Jameson, and Mr. Cham

berlain's appeal to President Krueger to
deal generously with the British South
African prisoners is derided by the
German press, which declare that a sum
mary trial by court-martial, followed by
the prompt execution of the leaders of the
raid, commends itself to German opinion
as the proper mode of procedure in their
case. A strict application of the law in
volving the sacrifice of the lives of the
rank and file of the prisoners would not
meet approval here, but it is the general
opinion that an example ought to be made
of the leaders.
It has transpired thai the Emperor has
had a serious quarrel with Prince Fred
erick Leopold of Prussia, the husband of
Princess Louise Sophie of Schleswig-
Holstein, sister of the Empress, over the
recent accident to the Princess while
skating near Glenicke Castle, Potsdam,
when the Princess and one of the ladies of
the court, Baroness Comar, broke through
the ice and came very near drowning. It
appears that the Emperor upbraided the
Prince for the indifference of his treat
ment of his wife and the Prince used some
pretty rough words in replying to the
Kaiser's rebuke. The Emperor thereupon
ulaced him under arrest for fourteen days,
with confinement in a room in his castle
for that length of time. The Kaiser im
mediately telegraphed for a detachment of
the First Guards to be sent from Potsdam
to Glenicke Castle to guard the Princt,
and he has since been confined there, not
being permitted to leave his chamber upon
any pretext.
The prospects of an amicable settlement
of the question affecting American insur
ance companies are improving. Baron
yon der liorst, the Prussian Minister of
the Interior, is conducting negotiations in
a most friendly spirit, which leads to the
expectations that an agreement will be
reached for a modification of the laws now
operating against the American insurance
companies.
The Berlin Handels-Zeitung devotes con
siderable space to the publication of com
plaints of the increasing ditliculties and
vexatious treatment which beset importers
of German goods in New York. The paper
says that the American consular authori
ties admit that the treatment shown to
these importers is in retaliation for
measures adopted by Germany which are
impeding imports from New York into
Germany. â ______

received a serious setback to-day by a
cave-in in the Anna Lee mine at Victor,
belonging to the Portland company.
The latest reports place the number of
men who arp buried under thousands of
tonf of rock at ten.
The Anna Lei mine is located near the
â  Mountain and is one of
the : â  â  mines in the State.
I;? working >ha:;. \ hich is down fJOO feet,
]- tin deepest i.: . The shaft is a
double compartment one and vertical,
irom which levels iir-- driven every iifty
to cut the immense ore chimney
which lies forne distance from the shaft
and has an incline of â¢ ,-n degrees.
Ten men, including General Manager
John Harnan and Assistant Superintend
ent Shelden, were caught in the cave-in,
and at this time there does not seem to be
the possibility that any have
cd. \Ye!l-posted miners fay that it
will be a miracle if any are alive.
The excitement at Victor i- intense and
large crowds â¢ >f friends and relatives of the
imprisoned men have surrounded the shaft
house ail <iay, 1 - o i > i 11 g against hope.
The accident occurred at 9:30 this morn
ing. President James Burn? of Colorado
_-s had been down in the mine on a
tour of inspection and had just been
hoisted to the surface, when Assistant Su
perintendent Sheldf-!:, accompanied by a
miner, entered the cage and were being
-d. They had descended about 2tO
feel when the engineer in charge of the
machinery received a signal to
draw up the cage rapidly.
The signal came too late; the great masses
of rock had begun to settle, crusnins the
md its occupants. Eight men were
working in the bottom of the shaft driving
â  tward the ore. chimney, and these
o have been crushed to death.
ue gangs were immediately put to
work from three different direction?, and
ver a miner can be used to advantage
i work. One party of rescuers
are driving a drift from the third lev: of
on mine, and at 8 p. m. it was
Lbey were still fifteen feet from
the â  oint in the Anna Lee shaft, where
the cage v,as supposed to have been caught
by (he cave in.
Ti.e upper workings of tne Anna Lee ''
mine are admitted by the Portland officials
to have been in a very dangerous con- j
dition, but the company had already I
igtben the supports.
The unsafe- cooditfoa of the mine was;
I by it-, former owners gutting the
entire ore chute, leaving the chambers so!
-t impossible to tun- â 
ber then, properly.
The numes of the imprisoned men, as
(learned, are: General Jfanaaer John
Harnan, Assistant Superintendent Bhel
dt-n and George Harnan, a nephew of Gen-
eral Manager Harnan, W. Â£. Lane, fore
man, James Hancock, Patrick May, Joe
Dunsmore, Frank McQuirk and Jack
Maloy.
The rescue gang which has been driving
tlio Scranton level to reach the Anna Lee
shaft cut that shaft at 11 :30 to-night, but
did not Bnd the cage and men, which is
i now believed to be higher up in the shaft.
i Tbe Anna Lee shaft is filled with rock.
Surface indications to-night are that cave
| ins are still taking place in the vacant ore
i chamber.", and this shatter? the last hope
that was had that some of the men might
be stilJ alive and rescued.

CHICAGO, 111-, Jan. 4.â The National
'â  convention of manufacturers, which
was successfully organized in January
last, will hold it- first annual convention
j here this month. The date was lixed for
: a month aeo, but it was decided to post

t he association to give this movement the
lest possible trend, to secure the full
! clearest expressions of the whole
of the manufacturing interests of the
country, and to establish permanent
apencies to be actively and continuously
engaged in promoting the oojects of the
association.
A special train run by the Manufactur

300 or -100 members of that club, and a
special from New York and Boston, carry
ing the Now York and New England con
tingents, sliow the interest taken in the
convention at the commercial centers.
The combined capital represented in the
convention would pay the National debt
several times over.
Among the delegates of prominence who
will attend will be Warner Miller, John B.
Kirk, Colonel A. Pope and Peter E. Stude

LONDON, Exn., Jan. 4.â The corre
spondent of the United Press at Constan

â¢i that a terrible massacre has taken place
at Biridjik, near Aintab, in Asia Minor.
Ihe official report of the occurrence states
0 people were killed.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Jan. 4.â
It is believed here that the massacre at
Biridjik was committed by the Kurds of
the Hamdieh cavalry. The recent mas

Constantinople reports admit that 900
persons were killed, but other accounts
say 2000 were slaughtered.
JIoSTON, Mass., Jan. 4.â Beridjik, where
the latest massacre is reported to have
occurred, is an outstation of Aintab, a sta
tion of the American Board in Central
Turkey. There is one ordained native
preacher and one native teacher and one
place for stated preaching. The average
congregation was eighty-five, with 160 ad

PALACE OF THE ICE KING,)
CLOSE TO ZERO. V
TRUCKEE, Cal., Jan. 4. )
The carnival was inaugurated to-day,
but not auspiciously. There is disappoint-
; ment over the railroad company's delay
i in co-operating, and while there are many
; people and plenty of fun in town the car
nival is practically postponed until early
next week. Truckee is so situated that it
can do nothing without the railroad, and
, the railroad managers have studied their
own convenience in taking advantage of
the transportation opportunities t;>at have
been afforded by the enterprise of the
; Truckee men. The railroad may make as
much money one time as another out of
â  the carnival, but a delay of a week or ten
j days, when everything is ready, means a
' loss to Truckee.
The mountain town, half-buried in a
foot ot Sierra snow, aroused itself this
morning before the sun shone over the
eastern peaks and the Ice King's palace
became the central object of interest. But
there were no excursionists to come, and
the strangers already here scattered about
in pursuit of the natural winter amuse
ments of Truckeeâ sleigh riding to Dormer
Lake, skating on the ponds about town
and sliding on the hill that leads down
from the rocking stone at McGlashan's
tower. Tobogganing was the only feature
at the ice palace, for the carnival skaters
were sent to Henry's Pond, an eighth of a
mile away, to permit the company to make
some improvements in the rink.
There were some exciting scenes at the
toboggan slide. A local business man â
James Goggins â concluded to stop at the
middle point of the descent, so he reached
out and grabbed a post at one side. He
says that he will never do that "some
more." The toboggan, at the rear end of
whic Mie had been stationed, shoton with
out hi m. The experimenter landed in the
other chute, plunged down a few feet,
bounded back into the chute that he had
just left and then finished the slide with
out any toboggan. He was not hurt, but
only a Truckee man could have survived
ihe adventure.
A party of drummers "showed off" a
iittle by roctcing their toboggan while go
ing at the rate ot a mile or two a minute,
and it took three natives to dig them out
of a snowbank.
The longest possible slide from the top
I of the chute is an eighth of a mile, no
j two miles, as has been stated in some of
! the papers.
There was no music at the palace to-day.
The electrical display promised for this
evening was deferred until to-morrow
night, and the opening pyrotechnical shov
is reserved for the arrival of the first large
excursion party. A beautiful scene to
night is the illumination of McGlashan's
tower and the torchlight marking of the
roadway, down which the young people
are coasting from the tower to the railroad
line. The toboggan-slide is also illumi
nated, and the suouts of the happy out
door revelers there are henrd. There is a
boniire at Henry's Pond, and the ice is
covered with skaters.
This afternoon the weather was so mild
that there seemed to be danger of a thaw,
as though the Ice King had become dis
pleased wilh the r .ilroad delay and had
resolved to undo his fantastic work. But
not an icicle fell, and the Truckec people
expect that the framework of the palace
will retain its ice until the Ist of May. The
hotel accommodations are good, for a town
of this size and situation, and there is
room for about 400 more persons than are
here now. In addition there are several
lodging-houses, and the citizens are pre
pared to extend hospitality at their homes.
These carnival guests are registered at the
leading hotels.

FRESNO'S FRUIT FAIR.
Hundreds of Visitors Admire the Array of
Luscious Products of a Sunny
Land. ,
FRESNO, Cal., Jan. 4.â Eipht hundred
people viewed the citrus fair this after
noon, and during the evening the atten
dance was even larger. The display is
much more effective under the electric
lights than in the daytime, and besides in
the evening an excellent musical and
literary programme was rendered. The
managers of the fair have decided to keep
it open until Tuesday night. It wiil he
open to-morrow afternoon, and in the
evening a sacred band concert will be
given.
All exhibits will be passed upon Mon
day afternoon, and the diplomas will be
awarded by a committee consisting of R.
H. McDonald of Portervilie, I. H. Thomas
of Visalia and Superintendent Wyer of
tnis city.
Those who have smiled incredulously at
the representations that have been made
by the citizens of Fresno County concern
ing its adaptabilities for the growing of
citrus fruit have only to visit Armory Hall
and be surprised and convinced. It was
wise in the management to exclude out
siders in the display, as it shuts off any
controversy that could arise in regard to
the products of Fresno County. Every
sample of fruit on exhibition ia the result
of local cultivation and a product of Fres
no County. The citizens of the county
have taken great interest in the success of
the fair, and have vied with each other in
placing the finest yields of their orchards
on exhibition. Members of the Chamber of
Commerce and the One Hundred Thous
and Club, who projected the enterprise,
feel justly proud of the result of their un
dertaking.
The last available space for display was
taken up to-day, five new exhibitors en
tering.

LEADYILLE. Colo., Jan. 4.â Ten thou
sand people attended the formal opening
of the Leadville ice palace to-day. A regi
ment appeared in toboggan costumes, and
there were all kinds of sports and festivi
ties. Ten special trains from different
parts of Colorado and Utah brought tne
crowd and made the opening festivities
decidedly brilliant.

SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Jan. 4.â
When the First National Bank of this city
straided there was supposed to have been
within its vaults $16,000 of the county's
money, and on the Treasurer's books it
has been counted as so much money, when
in reality there was no money there to the
county's credit. During the time the bank
has been in the hands of a receiver County
Treasurer Reeves has been paid between
$4000 and $5000, but this is considered too
little and the county demands that the
balance be placed in the county's vaults at
once so as to balance the Treasurer's books.
Where this money is to come from is
now the question, but the outlook is that
Treasurer .Reeves' bondsmen may be called
upon to make the amount good, as there is
but a small chance of the receiver of the
bank being able to collect the deficit.
Treasurer Reeves is in no way blamed for
the deficiency, as it has always been cus
tomary to divide the county's money
among the treueral city banks, so as to
keep it in circulation.

all diseases, consumption, is a disease of
the blood. The disease shows in the lungs
because of some inherited or acquired weak-
ness there. If the blood were always pure

blood float along through the body until

Disaster on a Railroad
Into the Logging
Camps.
ENGINEER CZAR KILLED
His Locomotive Leaves the Rails
and Plunges Down an
Embankment.
FOLLOWED BY LOADED CARS.
Rescuers Find His Mangled and Life
less Body Beneath the
Debris.
VKiAll. < w.. Jan. L â News reached
here to-day of a disaster on the C
railroad on Wednesday, which cost the life
of Engineer Charles Czar, the injuring of
Brakeman Charles Cassidy, and the total
wrecking of the engine and several of the
.. This railroad i? a
short spur built by the Caspar Lumber
Company into it- timber belt and is used
isively for the transportation of iogs
from ttie company's various camps.
The ill-fated engine, known as No. '2, was
pulling a logging-train from the camps.
The train was on tiie last trip for the day
arid the cars bad a heavy load of logs
aboard, which rere to be transferred to a
train drawn by engine 3 on the Caspar end
of the road. When about nine miles from
Caspar the engine, from some cause at
present unknown, left the rails and rolled
down the embankment. The heavy train
ef lous in the rear crushed tto the de
railed engine with terrible force. The en
gineer had not time to leare the cab before
he wa. caught beneath the load of logs that
shot down upon the engine and crushed
to death. The brakeruan, who was on the
rear end ol the train, was hurled from the
cars, but escaped with slight injuries.
\- - the brakeman har
ried tocamp No. 7 for assistance. When
lie returned to 1 : the wreck with
jine was found in
flami â  however, soon extin
guished. Among the debris was found
the lifeless body of the unfortunate engi
neer.
How tne accident occurred no one knows,
as the only per- â on the train were tne
engineer and the brakeinan. The latter,
however, was on the rear portion of the
train and knew nothing of the smashup
until he was hurled from the car. It is
probable that the train was late, and an
attempt was being made on the part of
the engineer to make up for lost time, and j
that on approaching one of the numerous I
heavy curves on the road, Czar attempted \
to suddtnly lower the t-perd, which caused i
the engine to leave the rails. Xo other
plausible theory for the accident can be
advanced.
Engineer Czar was about 30 years of age.
and had been in the employ of the Caspar
Lumber Company for a number of years.
He leaves a widow and five children.
SUDD ANSWERS SHIPPEE.
The Governor Indignant Over
the Ex-Director's Covert
Accusations.
Light Thrown Upon the Letting of
Pool-Selling Privileges at the
State Fair.
SACRAMENTO, Gai ÂJan. 4. -Governor
Budd is greatly incena published
statements accredited to ex-Director Ship
pee of the State Agricultural Society,
wherein he at he was turned
down because he vetoed the pool-seliing !
privilege? of one firm. When questioned I
on the subject the Governor said :
"I cannot believe Mr. Shippee made the
statements telegraphed to the San Fran
cisco Call, for the records show them to
be incorrect. In his talk it is claimed that
he was turned down because he could not
he controlled by Killip & Co. in his vote
oil the pool privileges. Now, the fact is
that the directors appointed by me voted
against the Killip scheme. This year the
board let the privilege to the highest
and a ?:>OO purse, or
against the sum of $7628 55 r
eceived the previous year under the Ship
pee board from Killip & Co., without op
position, hi other words, my appointees,
whom Bhippee charged were selected in
the i:itere?t of Killip, with Dr. Mathews,
were the ones who for the first time in
years overtnrned this firm and advertised
for bi<K thus getting from the highest
bidder. Qe< double the sum for
the State that the Miippee board did from
Killip.
"Mr. Shippee mi;<l<t tell why, under his
administration, all other privileges were
let to the highest bidder and yet Killip &
Co. always got the pool-selling privilege
without competition; and that privilege
was nut advertised or 1< t to ttie highest
bidder until 1 became (iovernor.
"His other statements are equally un
founded. There were but three meetings
of the board after my appointment of
Land, John Budd and John Maekey pre
vious to the State Fair. Land ami Mackey
attended all the meeting and Budd two
out of the three, although Shippee stated
they attended but one. Mr. Shippee's
record as to the pool-selling privileges
is as follows: J. N. Killip received
them on August 12, 1891, with
out competition or opposition, Shippee
present; August 15, lS9"i, J. N. Killip re
ceived the privileges without competition
or opposition, Shippee present (page 147 of
the minutes of the State board); August
10, 1593, J. N. Kiilip received the pooling
privileges without competition or opposi
tion. Shippee being present ( iiatre 212-216
oi the minutes); August 10, 1894, .1. N.
Killip received the jHjoling privileges
without competition or opposition, -
pee being present (page 27i of the Fame
records). So it will be seen that the only
time Killip did not receive the pool-selling
privileges in the last five years was on
August 10. 1Â»95, under the board appointed
by myself."

SANTA HOSA, Cal,, Jan. 4.â The rela
tivea of Victor Ottmer, the young man
who killed himself near Ilealdsburg a few
days ago, will contest Jennie M. Camp
bell's claim to Ottmer's estate. The young

POLITICS IN SACRAMENTO
Three Aspirants Who Will Get
Offices Under Mayor-
Elect Hubbard.
Certain Democrats Take Offense at a
Recent Appointment by the
Governor.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 4.âMayor
elect Hubbard will assume the duties of
his office on Monday next, and the local
political aspirants are pulling wires in all
directions. As yet Mayor Hubbard has
selected but three candidates for positions
which will become vacant, whose names
1 present to the Board of Trustees for
confirmation or rejection. These are: J.
O. Coleman for Superintendent of Streets,
Hiram Johnson for corporation counsel
and AY. F. Renfro for Mayor's clerk.
It is claimed that the Democratic mem
ber? of the City Board of held a
caucus yesterday and agreed to nominate
Trustee John Leonard for chairman in
place of W. D. Lawton, who retires from
tiie board. A? they are in the majority,
there is no doubt but that his election to
the chair will be encompassed. In the
matter of clerk of the board a lively dis
cussion is said to have ensued. James
Carrol!, a local politician of Democratic
proclivities, has been making a hard fight
for the position, and had the friendship of
a portion of the Trustees, but one of the
party in power would have none of him,
and absolutely refused to enter the caucus
if Carroll's name was to be mentioned.
A- it was deemed very advisable to have
perfect unity in the board, M. J. Des
mond's name was substituted, and he will
probably receive the position. For the
other positions in the gift of the corpora
tion, there are such a host 01. applicants
that there is no possible chance of picking
winners.
The appointment by Governor Budd of
Russ I>. Stephens as a'member of the State
Board of Horticulture, vice J. L. Mosher,
whose term had expired, has aroused the
animosity of the Democratic faction of the
city, with whom Stephens seems to be not
a favorite; not but that every one conceded
his absolute fitness for the position, but
they claim that he has been one of the
strongest adherents of the old-line party,
which battled so fiercely with the reorgan
izes in the last gubernatorial election.
The latter won, but they have never for
given their erstwhile opponents. When
questioned on the subject. Governor Budd
stated that as the office was simply hon
orary, without salary, be did not deem it
one of a political nature, and as he
ardently desired to bring the board to
Sacramento, as this was the central point
of fruit shipment, he believed Mr.
Stephens to be well fitted to forward the
aims of the board, and consequently
selected him.
â¢Without doubt," continued the Gov
ernor, ''the fruit industry will become the
industry of the State, and it is proper that
it receive full recognition. In conversa
tion with Harbor Commissioner Colnon
on the subject we agreed that a certain
portion of the water front in San Fran
cisco should be set aside for the use of the
fruit interests. The lumber, fish, brick
and sundry other industries all have their
allotted portions, and during the coming
season the fruitmen will also be recog
nized." 6
HALFMODN BAY DISASTER
The Identity of the Three Men
Drowned by the Capsizing
of a Boat.
Captain Whitney's Two Companion:
Were Young Men From St.
Louis.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 4.âCap
tain Whitney and two companions, be
lieved to have been George A. Schulze (a
metal-worker, aged 22 years) and Fred C.
Wenige (of about the same age), both
well-connected young men of St. Louis,
prove to have been the men who were
drowned in Half moon Bay several days
ago. The first authentic news of the dis
aster reached this city to-day.
The unfortunate trio came down the
coast in a small boat, and put into Half
moon Bay for repairs. On resuming their
trip the boat was capsized in the surf. The
bodies were not recovered..
T. K. i-'chulze of Oakland, a brother of
one of the young men who were drowned,
was in town tv-day and offered a reward of
$00 to tlie finder* of either or both of the
bodies. This amount will probably be in
creased as soon as the parents can be tele
graphed to.
Both young men were members of Fu
ture Great Lodge No. 276, K. of P., of Bt
lxmis. They were last seen aiive in Oak
land on Thanksgiving day. They were
going to Santa Barbara to seek employ
ment and have not been heard from since.
It is believed they met Captain Whitney,
joined him on his trip down the coast, and
were lost.

LOS ANGELES MYSTERY.
Peter Deville Murdered at His
Roadhouse Near the
City.
His Body Cast Into the Flames of His
Home, Which Had Been
Fired.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 4.â A mys
terious and shocking murder took place
last night about 10 o'clock at Peter De
ville's roadhouse, about four miles east of
this city, on the Whittier road, the pro
prietor being the victim. The last seen of
him alive was about 9 o'clock last evening,
when several parties stopped at his place.
They all left a few moments afterward, as
he was about to shut up the store. Later
the Btructure was seen in flames. It was
thought possible that Peter had escaped,
but he was nowhere to be found.
When the flames had somewhat sub
sided a search was instituted by the
deputy sheriffs who had been summoned,
and in the ruins the charred body of the
proprietor was found. There was no
means of telling, in the examination that
could be made at the time, whether the
unfortunate man had been murdered be
fore he was incinerated or whether he bad
been stunned and his unconscious body
thrown into the fire, which had been
kindled by his slayer.
A further investigation disclosed the fact
that kerosene had been freely used through
the house, and under the floor of the hall
way the earth was found saturated with
blood. As Deville was known to have had
considerable money in an old trunk rob
bery was evidently the motive for the
crime, and the perpetrators of the murder
endeavored to cover it up by setting tire
to the building. The affair has caused
great excitement here, and several deputy
sheriffs are busily engaged in locating the
murderer.
"French Pete" was an old-timer, and
was known all over Southern California
He has always kept a roadside inn, and
was a bachelor. He was about 55 years of
age, and many years ago lost his arm
whiie prospecting. He was always chari
table and kind-hearted, never drank much
and was always friendly with every one.
Those who know him say that he never
turned a tramp from his door. A cousin
who had been visiting him for some time'
only recently returned to hia home in
France.

SAN DIEGO'S MURDER CASE.
The Trial of Joseph Ebanks for a Double
Crime Opens With a Sensa
tion.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 4.-The trial of
Joseph Japhet Ebanks, a West India
negro, for the murder of J. B. Borden and
his daughter, Mrs. Stiles, near Oceanside,
on September 10 last, began to-day in the
Superior Court, after four daya' work se
lecting a jury.
The District Attorney sprang a sensa
tion in outlining the evidence that would
be brought out, which had been sup
pressed in the preliminary examination,
the most important of which was that the
pistol which killed the aged couple, and
which was known to have been in the
possession of Ebanks, had been found in a
canyon not far from the scene of the
crime wrapped in a gunny-sack taken
from the tent. With the pistol was a
shirt marked "Gibson," which Ebanfes had
stolen from a man of that name, and an
other shirt with the same name marked
upon it was found on Ebanks when he
was captured.
All circumstances in this mysterious
case point strongly to the guilt of Ebanks,
ana still there is nothing Beyond circum
stances to connect him with the crime.
The case will be resumed Monday morn
ing and will consume a week.

SAN MATEO TUNNEL
The Southern Pacific to
Pierce the San Pedro
Mountains.
PLANS OF HUNTINGTON.
A Network of Railways That
Will Converge Toward
San Francisco.
PURE WATER FOR THE CITY.
The Spring Valley Company Will As
sist in Tunneling the
Elevations.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Jan. 4.-C. P.
Huntington's recent trip through San Ma
teo County with Charles Webb Howard of
the Spring Valley Water Works may mean
considerable to San Francisco. It again
opens up the question of tunneling
through the mountain at a point back of
Redwood City, so as to connect the ocean
side with the bay side of San Mateo
county. The result would be that a rail
road built up along the coast would escape
the forbidding group of hills terminating
in the San Pedro Mountain, which juts
out into the ocean just below the San
Francisco County line and blocks the way.
Surveys have been made around, over
and through the San Pedro Mountains,
but the obstacles to good railroading are
said to be something immense, while the
tunnel referred to would afford a means of
crossing over to the bay shore and thence
to San Francisco on an almost level grade.
If a railroad tunnel is built, it has been
considered the policy ol the Spring Valley
Water Works to join with the Southern
Pacific Company in its construction. The
Spring Valley folks have extensive in
terests on the coast side of San Mateo
County, and control enough water over
there, which is running to waste into the
ocean, to add millions of gallons to San
Francisco's daily supply. Pescadero
Creek is the principal stream, but there
are several others, and the San Gregorio
and Purissima are very important ones.
Water will be taken from each.
At the present time there is no way of
getting the water over the mountains, and
the Spring Valley Company could use the
railroad tunnel to bring a pipe-line
through, emptying the water into Crystal
Springs reservoir among the hills back of
San Mateo. Thus, from the head waters
of the Pescadero to San Francisco, there
would be a constant supply cf pure moun
tain water by gravity flow.
If the Southern Pacific goes into the
scheme it is safe to Â«ay that enough feed
ers to the main line of railroad will be
operated on the coast side of San Mateo
County to fully occupy or control the
various avenues of approach to San Fran
cisco. These feeders would tap the "big
basin," a vast tract of virgin redwood tim
ber owned by Timothy Hopkins and
others, and lyins: along the border line of
San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. Pes
cadero, San Gregorio, Punssima and
Spanishtown would be on the main line.
Such valleys as the San Greeorio and Pi
larcitos we natural highways between the
mountains, and need only an outlet by
tunnel to command the coast trade.
On one pretext or another the whole
coast side of San Mateo County has been
crossed and recrossed by survey parties,
until every foot of the land and all the
distances and elevations are known and
carefully tabulated. The area of water
shed and record of rainfall have all been
figured out to a nic&ty. The capacity of
the streams to furnish motor-power by the
use of turbine-wheels has been inquired
into, and the generation, local use and
transmission of electric power to San
Francisco have received the attention of
expert?.
It is believed that with the revival of
business the construction of the proposed
tunnel would be one of the first moves
made by the Southern Pacific Company in
order to maintain its control over traffic to
and from San Francisco. At the present
time there is no sale for bonds and actual
railroad construction is languishing, yet
the Southern Pacific Company has not
been idle, but has taken advantage of
every opportunity to strengthen its posi
tion.
When the San Francisco and San Joa
quin Valley Railway Company was incor
porated the Southern Pacific Company
hurried along its work in San Mateo
County. It immediately secured the long
neglected rights of way around the bay
shore, and it looks as though it might soon
spring another surprise by bringing a rail
road in from the coast side as mentioned
above. It is not a new idea. Everything
is ready. Condemnation proceedings
could be commenced almost at a day's
notice.
All the country immediately affected by
any such, a movement was gone over in a
buggy by Mr. Huntington and Mr. How
ard, their route being from San Mateo to
Redwood City, Woodside, Searswille, La
Honda, Hanson's Mill, San Gregorio, Pu
rissiina, Spanishtown, through Pilarcitos
Valley, past Crystal Springs reservoir and
back to San Mateo.
SAN JOSE'S NEW FACTORY.
The City Likely to Secure a
Glass Manufacturing
Plant.
Proposition of a Philadelphia Capi
talist Approved By the Board
of Trade.
SAN JOSE. Cai,., Jan. 4.â W. S. Boody
of Philaaelphia presented a proposition to
the Board of Trade last night to establish
a glass factory in this city, provided a site
of a half acre on a railroad be donated
for the plant. The proposition met with
favor with the board, and A. C. Darby, C.
J. Steeple and A. Greeninger wera ap
pointed a special committeee to report on.
the matter at the next meeting. In mak
ing his proposition to the Board of Trade
Mr. Boody said:
"I have thought of establishing a glass
plant in California, but obstacles have
until recently made it impracticable. The
revolution in the method of manufacture
which will enable us to use oil for luel has
.removed all obstacles, and X wade this
trip for the purpose of making definite ar
rangements for putting up a glass manu
factory. There is no objection commer
cially, as the demand for manufactured
glass in California would support a large
factory. I have talked with prominent
citizens of this city, and they are of the
opinion that such a concern would be of
immense benefit to San Jose.
"The resources of myself and those
whom I represent are entirely adequate to
carry out every agreement which we enter
into. We would undertake the erection of
a plant that would cost anywhere from
$6000 to $10,000. The number of employes
at the start would be from TO to 100, but in
three years we expect that the force would
number 500 men. All we ask is that this
city give us a tract of landâ approximately
half an acre â with railroad facilities. We
intend at first to make all common grades
of glass, such as jars, beer and wine bot
tles, etc., but later we would put in a
special plant and manufacture all the fine
grades of glass."

PORTLAND, Ok., Jan. 4.â ln the North

The fact that Judge Gilbert has made

WRECKAGE ON THE BEACH.
An Indian Woman Discovers a Life
boat Used by Men of the
Strathnevis.
TORT TOWNSEND, Wash.. Jan. 4.â
The steamer Garland arrived here to-day
from Neah Bay, having on board a lifeboat
ging to the steamer Strathnevis anl
a life Luoy from the Cana lian-Australian
steamship Miowera, about which there
lias been so much anxiety in shipping
circles since the report was brought here
I â â  i'a]uaiii I'attie of the Btrathnevis that
~,i suddenly disappeared from
Bight about lifteen miles off Cape Flattery
c morning of December i v - The boat
and buoy were picked up on the beach
pouth of Cape Flattery, ami were brought
to N'eah Bay, and there taken by the <.:ir
land, which carried them to Seattle to-day.
There has been little o:st> miked of here
to-day, and the news brought by tbe Gar
land created intense excitement. It was
at once decided that i< I 'Ked very bad for
the Australian liner, and preparations
were begun to send tugs out to make a
thorough search for more wreckage.
The Miowera came upon the disabled
liner Strathnevis after she had been drift
ing helplessly about in miuocean for sixty
six days, and I â  â â¢â ! ner through a raging
Btorm to a raparative safety near
nd. She arrived there with
the disable 1 steamer at midnight on
December 23, and at that hour the steel
cable - the two vessels broke.
This was- a serions accident on that stormy
n'.ght. but assurance was given that the
rescuer would stand by until daylight in
case of need. An anchor was put out
from the Strathnevis, and then it was dis
covered that the Miowera was nowhere to
:>.. This was at 3 o'clock in the
f December 23, and since then
the Miowera has not been heard from.
Tlie fact of her disappearance was re
: when the Minneola, a Tacoma col
rue back to port with the Strath
no vis.
â¢ c were several members of the Strath
<-rew who expressed a belief that the
Miowera had herseif been wrecked, but
story was not credited, although it
was admitted strange that after towing the
prize several hundred miles through the
roughest kind of weather she should not
only let pass ah chance of securing a
heavy salvage claim, but leave the vessel
. n a place where she was at any
n:oment liable to be dashed to pieces.
Tbe belief that something serious bad
happened has been growing, and to-day,
when a life-preserver from thÂ« vessel was
brought, the belief was materially
strengthened.
S me shipping men hold to the belief
that had the vessel actually gone to the
bottom more wreckage would have come '
ashore, but this argument ia set at naught j
â¢by the fact that the Ivanhoe was wrecked |
"thing but her signboard ever found, I
while only the medicine-chest was dis
covered to reveal the fate of the handsome
collier Montserrat and her brave crew, i
Another vessel, tbe Majestic, disappeared
and never a vestige of her was found.
Accompanying the Miowcra's life pre
server was a boat which is said to have be
longed to the Strathnevis,and which is be
lieved to be the one in which the purser
and two of the vessel's crew left her when
6tie was slowly drifting ashore at Destruc
tion Island, to telegraph for assistance.
The boat was found in a small cove and
had a jagged hole stove in her side. As no
one aboard the Strathnevis can say posi
t.vely that the boat reached the beach, it is
!e that three men werÂ« drowned in
tiie terrible surf which followed in the
waKe of the stom then raging. Thus far
the storm has m.i.!e it impossible for the
I'nited States lighthouse steamer Colum
bine to obey orders B nd go to their rescue.
The reported discovery of wreckage
tending to confirm the belief that the Mi
owera ha 1 been lost was followed this
afternoon by a report that the beach south
of Cape Flattery was strewn with wreck
age and new lumber, an i that two sign
boards from vessels had l.een picked up.
One bore the name "C. F. .Sargent," while
the oth*r, which was broken in twain, had
only "Victoria" carved oa it. As the
Sargent arrived at Adelaide on November
15. there is no fear for her safety. Just
what vessel the Victoria board belonged
to is not known, although it is possible
that it is from the schooner Mary Brown, '>
wrecked two years ago and lost with all
on board during a voyage from Mary
Island, Alaska, to Victoria. All ever i
found of that unfortunate vessel was her '
peak flag and a broken board bearing the
word "Brown."
Instructions have been issued by Cap
tain Libby, manager of the Puget Sound
Tugboat Company, to each of the officers
of the fleet of seven tugs under his control, ;
to cruise close in shore south of the cape
â¢whenever in that vicinity, and he says that i
Within three days he will be absolutely
certain about the Miowera's fate.
A rr irctl at Seattle.
SKATTLE, Wash., Jan. 4.â The steamer
Garland arrived in port at 4 o'clock this
afternoon, Captain Mahan, her master,
having in his possession one of the Mio
wera's buoys, found by an old Indian
woman, along with the Strathnevi-" life
boat, the boat, presumably, in which I'ur-
Bex McDonald, Third Officer Bain and three
Japanese tried to make Destruction Island.
The lifeboat, which the captain says was
badly wrecked and broken, was not
brought to Seattle.

SAXTA CIiVX LITIGATION.
Third Action Against thn Electric Light
and I'mcrr Cotnpnny.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 4.â A com
plaint was tiled in the Superior Court this
morning by Fred \V. Swanton against the
Santa Cruz Electric Light and Power Com-_
pany, which makes the third suit of the
kind be has begun of late. In his com
plaint he prays for judgment for !f.'>soo for
services rendered in floating a loan for
$67,800 in February last.
The Electric Light and Power Company,
prior to February of last year, negotiated
a loan of $40,000 from the City Bank of this
city and for security gave bonds for $^0,000,
with the agreement that should the bonds
not be taken up in one year's time the bank
should become the owner of them, thus
making $50,000 the company owed the
bank instead of $40,000, a loss of $10,000 to
the company. When toe year expired the
company did not have the funds to liqui
date and urued Swanton to float a loan-
In San Francisco Swanton succeeded in bor
rowing $67,800 for the company and placed
bonds to cover tbe amount.
Swanton alleges in his complaint that he
has never received financial consideration
for hi* services, and tixe.s $3500 as a rea
sonable charge, for which amount he sues.

AMADOR COUNTY MINES
The Opening of New Claims a
Daily Occurrence in the
District.
Monster Pumping Gear That Is to
Handle the Water at the
Union Claim.
JACKSON, Cal., Jan. 4.â Mining con
tinues active in Amador County and
nearly every day new claims aie being
opened. J. Ro3s Browne and Mr. Behr of
San Francisco were here this week and
commenced active operations at the
Oneida. The company's boarding-house
is nearly finished and a contract was let
to P. Buell A- Co. of Stockton for 12"),000
feet of shaft timbers. The new shaft will
be 1000 feet east of the old workings and
will be sunk 1700 feet perpendicularly be
fore the vein will be encountered. There
is no doubt that this mine will be a divi
dend-payer.
At the Argonaut the new water hoist
(the largest in the county) was started on
Saturday last and works to perfection. At
the Alma sinking is continued and good
headway is being made. They are still in
green stone, but the slate belt will be met
within sixty feet, when better progress can
be made. A telephone Jine is now hein^
constructed from Jackson to the Union
Consolidated, a distance of eight, miles.
D. Gntmann was here over New Year, and
while here bought the pumping gear at
the Wolverine mine. This gear is one of
tiie larsest on the coast, and when erected
at the Union will be more than able to
handle all the water there. The main
tunnel of the Union is now beins retim
bered and will be finished within six
weeks. By that time the pump will be
erected and the hoisting machinery will be
in position, when sinking wiil be resumed
in the main shaft and the mill started on
ore from the 300 level. There are now
thirty men employed at the Union.
The Watson mine at Butte City has
been bonded by San Francisco parties,
and a 10-stamp mill is to be erected at
once. At the Jackson Gate the shaft is
now down 200 feet, and the quartz is im
proving all the time. This mine shows
up as well as any in the county.

j Defeat of the Zord's-I)ay Alliance in Itt

TORONTO, o>-r., Jan. 4.-The Ontario
Court of Appeals has handed down an im
portant judgment affecting the running of
; Sunday street cars. Some months ago the
j Lords-day Alliance of Hamilton took ac
tion to prevent the running of Sunday
cars in that city on the ground that the
running of street cars on Sunday was a
! nuisance to church-goers and i"hat the
j eanctity of the Lord's day should be pre
j served.
The alliance also laid an information
; with the Ontario Attorney-General against
j the stieet-railway company charging it
: with a breach of the Lords-day act in
1 making their employes work on Sunday.
! The case, after being tried at Hamilton,
was referred to the Court of Appeals,
which yesterday decided every point in
favor of the company. The court, ruled
that the company was a bona fide "carrier
of travelers," and was by law allowed to
continue business on Sunday, and dis
; missed the case.

charge of contempt which may mean a
term in the County Jail.
The difficulty arose out of a dispute over
lands. On October 16, 1895, Kutner &
Huffman of Fresno leased from E. B. Per
rin 7000 acres of the Chowchilla ranch,
ten miles west of Madera. This land is all
under fence and was rented by Kutner &
Huffman as sheep pasture. The lessees
took immediate possession of the premises
and occupied them until a few days ago.
In December, 1895, Perrin contracted the
land to Gordan Griffith, a real estate man
of San Jose, for the purpose of making a
sale, Griffith representing that he could
settle a colony thereon. This he failed to
do, but he did lease the land for one year
beginning January 1, 1896, to the Miller &
Lux.estate. This, it is claimed, was with
out the knowledge of Perrin and presum
ably outside of the agreement between
himself and Griffith.
On December 28 Miller drove 600 head of
cattle to the land, broke down tbe fence
and turned them into the pasture. He
was at once notified by Kutner & Huffman
to remove them, but did not comply,
whereupon Kutner <fe Huffman turned
them out.
The cattle were driven back by Miller
the same day, and armed men were placed
by him along the fence to prevent any
further action by Kutner & Huffman. :
Among these men was "Billy" Morrison, '
a well-known fighting man with a record
of having killed several men. Kutner &
Huffman then had J. F. "Warren, Miller's
foreman, and the vaqueros under his !
charge, arrested, charging them with :
forcible entry and detainer. They were
released on nominal bail.
Suit was brought on January 2 by Kutner
it Huffman against Miller and others, and
an injunction issued to restrain them from
occupying the lands. This injunction was
served the same day upon Miller, but in
disregard of it he again yesterday
caused the fence to be broken down and
his cattle turned into the pasture.
Â±o-d:iy warrants were again issued for
the arrest of Warren and the vaqueros,
but so far no return has been made upon
them.

REFORMERS MAY UNITE
An Interesting Movement Started
for the Coalition of the
Parties.
Various Elements That Would Be
Welcomed Into the Ranks of
the Populists.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 4.â The fact de
veloped this afternoon that an important
move is on foot looking to a rounding up
of representative members of all reform
parties, sucn as the Bimetallic League,
Prohioitionists, Woman Suffragists,
Grangers, Trades Unionists, etc., at the
time and place that may be lixed for the
national convention of the People's party
with the view of forming a coalition of
these elements and the placing in the Held
of a union Presidential ticket.
The National Committee of the Popu
lists meets ut St. Louis a week Irom next
Friday for the purpose of deciding upon
the place and date for holding the conven
tion, and that city, as well as Milwaukee,
Minneapolis, D:Â»l!as, Atlanta, Omaha and
Kansas City are in the field for the privi
lege of entertaining the delegates
The Illinois committee has also been
quietly working to the same end, and
Eugene Smith, the National committee
man from this State, has b en in corre
spondence with leading members of the
party East, West and South. The nu
merous replies that he has received have
developed the existence of v remarkably
strong sentiment in favor of inviting the sil
ver, temperance and other reform elements
lo meet with the Pc pulists for conference a
day or two before the National Conven
tion, and the National Committee at its
forthcoming meeting will be asked either
to so word its cull as to lay the ground
work of such a union, or issue a special in
vitation to all retorm parties to meet at
the time and place for which t tie conven
tion may be set.
Committeeinan Smith said this after
noon that, from the extent of his corre
spondence, ho was satisfied that every
State in the Union would be represented
by its full complement of delegates and al
ternates, and that it would bs one of the
largest National political gatherings of the
year.
AN INSANE MAN MAY HANG.
Complications That Pr vent the Governor of
Nebraska From Interfering With
the Execution.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Jan. 4.â Unless action
by the proper officials is speedily taken
John B. Walker of Lexington, Dawson
County, will be hanged on January 10 for
murder. Walker is insane â at least Gov
ernor Holcomb is now so convinced, as are
r.jany neighbors of the condemned man.
The Governor is interested in the case, and
at the same time worried, inasmuch as he
presided at the trial and sentenced Walker
while he was District Judge. Walker
lived the life of a hermit, and killed a
neighbor who ventured on his land. The
law provides that county officials where
the crime was committed must pass on a
condemned man's sanity; but, possibly
owing to the bitter feeling against him,
this has not been done, and he has no
I friends to intercede. As a last resort the
I Governor may grant a temporary reprieve.
CHANCES OF BLACKBURN.
There Is a Prospect of a Bitter
Struggle for the Kentucky
Senatorship.
As at Present Constituted, the Legisla
ture Is Equally Divided by Demo
crats and Republicans.
FRANKFORT, Ky., .Tan. 4.â The bien
nial session of the Kentucky Legislature
convenes Tuesday. The Senatorial con
test overshadows all other questions, and
there is no talk about legislation. The
Senate is Democratic, and can kill any leg
islation the House and Governor may at
tempt to get through.
The session of the Legislature is limited
to sixty days, and under the law the vot
ing for Senator cannot begin until two
weeks after the first day of the session.
Up to yesterday it was the opinion of
many that there would be no election and
Senator Blackburn's seat would be vacant
from March 4, 1896, until the Legislature
met again In 1888,
On joint ballot, without unseating any
Democrat, the Legislature now stands:
Democrats fis, Republicans GS, Populists 2.
The House Republicans intend to unseat
Kaufman (D.) ot Lexington and perhaps
Tompkins (D.) of Owensboro. The Demo
crats, however, claim tnat there is no evi
dence on which this can be done.
Congressman W. Godfrey Hunter of the
Third District will in all' probability re
ceive the Republican nomination for
United State* Senator. Congressman
"Walter Evans and Augustus E. Wilson,
both of this city, are prominent candi
dates, but Hunter has all the Louisville
Republican votes, so it can be plainly seen
that Evans and Wilson are out of it."
The Democrats have Senator Joe Black
burn, Congressman James B. McCreary
an.i A. S. Berry. Blackburn claims that
he is not only going to get the nomina
tion, but is going to be elected. He cer
tainiy will liave the most votes in the
caucus, but whether or not all the sound
money Democrats will go into it is a ques
tion. If they do it is argued the two
Populists must come over to him.

BUTTE BEAT SEATTLE.
Friends of the Vanquished Players Credit
Their Defeat to Umpire and
Referee.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 4.â Butte won
from the Seattle Athletic Club by a score
of 6 to 2 this afternoon in one of the hard
est fought battles of the season. Mundav,
the umpire, was from Tacoma, and Dygert,
the referee, from Butte. Between them
the victory was taken from the home team.
Donnelly, the best Seattle player, was
early ruled off the field for alleeed slug
ging.
In the first half Balliett was twice declared
off aide and twenty yards given to Butte,
which advantage resulted in their scoring.
In the second ball Seattle played a strong
game and kept the bail continually in
their territory. Butte failed to score and
Seattle earned two points.
The game was played in rain and wind,
but was witnessed by a laru;e audieuce.
The interest was intense throughout, Se
attle being more than proud of the game
put up against the Montana champions,
who admit having been given a hard rub
in what at times seemed' to them a losing
contest. A second game will be required
to settle the superiority of the teams.
The Butte players were entertained at a
theater to-night. Their game with Port
Townsend for Monday has been canceled,
as Butte claims they are "used up."
O-V SASTA BAJWARA'S GRIDIHOX.
High School Football Player* Defeated
by College Men.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 4.â An
exciting contest took Dlace to-day between
the High School athletic team of this
place and a picked eleven of State univer
sity, Stanford and Belmont Academy boys,
at home for their winter vacation, who
joined in a game of football at the Agri
cultural Park grounds. A larg9 number
of spectators witnessed the struggle. â¢
The college team consisted of Messrs.
Davenport, Moore, Bell, Eaton, Broome,
Ealand, Orella, Cooper, Kittredge, Dibblee
and Ransom, with McDuffy and Stow as
substitutes, while the city team was com
posed of Mover, Broughton, Lopez, Friel,
Kiler, Butler, Bodie, Penry, Henderson,
Starr and Lemmon, with Colt and Wright
as substitutes. Although the home team
had been coached for somo time by Joseph ]
Pierce, formerly the famous center rush of !
Berkeley, who umpired the game, it was |
evident from the first that the superior I
years and long training of the college boys !
gave them the advantage. Besides, the
college boys had a raascot â an evil-looking
bulldog by the name of Bowson.
The game was hotly contested. Moyer,
Lopez and Kiler of tne city boys signalized
themselves by their excellent playing.
Had this quartet been better supported
victory for the home team would have been
certain. The team work of the college
boys won for them the game by a score of
28 to 10. Bell made two fine touchdowns
and Kiler another, but the latter plnyer
was obliged to retire from the game later
on, on account of an injury received. No
lives were lost, but one of the local* is said !
to have undertaken ttie unpleasant task of |
digesting hve of his own teeth.

$250 demanded from him as the price for
the jury not indicting him.

It is alleged that the present jury has
a scale of prices from $100 to $oUO, while
the past ones have r>een satisfied with $100

The Hovel Application Made by a \<i
llonal Otwrdstiian.
LINCOLN, Nebb.. Jan. 4. â Icillius John
son, who helped to repel an Indian in
vasion in Nebraska in 1865, has applied to
Adjutant-General Barry for a record of
service on which to base hi.% claim for a
pension. The case seems to hinge on the
question of whether or not Johnson was
ever in the service of ihe United States.
He was a member of Company B, First
Regiment, Second Brigade, Nebraska Na
tional Guard, when the guard was ordered
out to repel attacks of Indians. The case
is considered remarkable and important
and the tirst of the kind on record, though
many others may brinj; like churns, Be
canse the guard was ordered out by a Ter
ritorial Governor, who may be considered
a representative of the General Govern
ment, it is claimed that sucn soldiers were
actually in the service or the Government.
Adjutant-General Barry will probably refer
the matter to Washington.

"The Monroe doctrine is correct as a
principle, but its application in this case
is, in my opinion, not clear. I cannot now

demonstrating that the British are in

woods and in indigo. The mahogany is
finer than I have ever seen elsewhere, and
is destined to be the eource of immense

Vinctor Beat Libertine a Neck
in the Pommery Sec
Handicap.
A COAST RECORD IS BROKEN.
The Winner Covered the Mile in
1:39 14â St. Lee and Sir
Richard Won.
Libertine, the great sprinter, had to
lower his colors to the crack Californian
Vinctor, in the Pommery Sec handicap
decided at the Bay District track yester
day. A great equine contest was ex
pected, and the large crowd was not disap
pointed, for to win the victorious horse
had to cover the distance in the wonder
fully fast time of I :39'i, a new coas^t record.
Five other events were down on the
curd, but were very ordinary affairs, and
:ed but little ice" wijh the big event
of the day. Favorites were successful in
three of them.
;'j After Mt. McGregor II had disposed of a
tie', i of eleven maiden three-years very
handily in the opening rive-furlong dash,
starting at o ids of 6 to 1, and Kamsin, the
1 to 4 favorite for the seven-furlong run
that fo!lowed, had galloped over the top of
his field, the event of the day was called.
>me starters were to face the issue.
Delegated to carry top weight (ll9 pounds)
Libertine was chalked up an 8 to 5 choice
in the opening betting. The Burns <fc
Wiiterhouse pair, Potentate ana Rosebud,
next engrossed attention at 2}4 to 1, but
became a drug cm the market, drifting
back to sixes. Vinctor, weighted next to
the favorite with 111 pounds, and his
stable companion, Installator, had third
call, with threes about tnern. Four to
one was once offered against the two, but
around post time the general price was 2 l {
to 1. Little Cripple had many stanch
mends, who backed him at 8 and 10 to 1
and thf other starters- Perhaps, Thelma
and Oregon Eclipse, the latter the rank
outsiderâ came in for scattering support.
The Libertine money wa3 held off till just
before post time, when a heavy piav cut
his odds down to 6 to 5.
There was a great deal of bumping and
crowding and jamming about at the post.
Frozen up against the outside fence were
Doggett on Vinctor and od Sloane on his
stable companion, Installator. waiting for
the opportune moment. It came. In
despair Ferguson got down oui of the
starters box, mingling with the horses.
The field broke away, or a-t least a portion
of it did, and down went the flag. It may
have looked like an even breakaway to the
starter, but it looked a very ragged' one to
outsiders. Vinctor and installator were
off, flying in front, followed by Perhaps
Potentate and the favorite. At tne quarter
Installator, who was sent out to make the
running, was a head before Perhaps
with Vinctor a . length in front
cf the favorite. At the half Instal
lator was but a head in front of
Libertine, on which Macklin was becoming
impatient and was going out for the lead'!
Into the stretch Libertine was leading
Vinctor, who had passed his stable mate
by half a length. Doggett now began
riding the son oi Imp. Brutus hard, and a
furious from the wire his head was in
front, and Libertine looked a badly beaten
horse. He responded again, however, to
his rider's desperate riding, and in an ex
citing drive was beaten but a neck as the
pair flashed past the winning-post.
When the time, I:39}Â£, wa3 hung out,
the crowd went wild with enthusiasm, and
upon Doggett's return to the stand horse
and rider received a great ovation. It was
unfortunate that the defeated norse did
not get of! on equal terms with his con
queror, thus preventing the creat amount
of grumbling that ensued among Libertine

The short course steeplechase wns taken
by the 13 to 5 favorite. Tom Clarke, who
shook off Malo Diablo in ths run to the
| wire, and won easily by three lengths.
Burmah, who at one stage of the journey
looked a likely candidate for first place
honors, finished a fair third.
The mile and a sixteenth selling ev^nt,
with eleven starters, resulted in another
victory for Garnet Ferguson's good colt St.
Lee, who ruioc 1 a 6 to 5 favorite in the bet
ting. He was. perhaps, fortunate in hav
ing his most likely competitor, Montalvo,
left at tne post. "The youngster was in
front all the wav, and won by a length and
3 ha'.f in I:47 ji. Little Bob, who was
almost left when'the dag fell, made a great
run, nipping the place from Navy Blue by
a short head.
The day's sport was concluded by a most
exciting sprinting dash over the short six
furlong course. Sir Richard, Hymn, Tim
Murphy, Fly. Clacquer and Emma D were
ail in, with feather-weights up, and some
lively batting was indulged in. Opening
at 2J4 to 1, Emma D wns once more
plunged on, her odds speedily being cut to
8 to 5. Very liberal prices were laid
arainst the other starters. When the rl-.ig
fell Tim Murphy, Clacquer and tiymn
were away iirst. but Fly almost immedi- |
ately shoL to the front, leading the first
named trio, who were heads apart, two
lengths at the half. Fly did not stop as
he generally does, but hung on and was
only beaten by a nose on the wire by Sir
Richard, who showed a phenomenal "burst
of speed through the stretch. Tim Mur
phy was a bang-up third. It was a very
last run race, the winner covering the dis

the last race.
Timed separately, outside watches are
said to have caught Libertine from wire to

caught the winner in l:3t> flat. The frac

Official timers, were: Quarter, :25; hull

by Willie Spence.
Billy S made his initial appearance as a

Montalvo was backed from sixes and

money was lost on him' wnen he was left
standing at the post.
Articus was well played to win the mile
and a s-ixteenth event, and the .-<ull:ing

LIVELY BATTLE PROMISED.
Joseph Sham's Ex â¢ Employes
Tell Their Side of
the Story.
THE COLLECTOR'S HEAVY DEBTS.
He Feared the Attorneys for the
Schulken Estateâ Pressed by
His Creditors.
The legal battle between Joseph Sham
and Messrs. C. A. Curtin and C. W. Beala,
Who succeeded to the business of the well
known collector, promises to be a lively
om if the allegations of the defendants are
proven. Sham, after becoming very much
involved financially, left the City suddenly
in June last.
Curtin and Beals were employes of his,
and proceeded to carry on his business and
settle the affairs of the concern to the best
of their ability. On Sham's return he de
clared his intention of resuming the busi
ness, but Curtin and Beals declined to give
up the omce, alleging that Bhain had as
signed his business to them and that they
were the sole proprietors of the agency.
Recently Sham began suit for $15,000
damages, an accounting, and to recover
possession of his oiiice fixtures and ac
counts. He alleged that Curtin and Beals
were simply acting as his agents, and had
no real interest in the business.
Up to the present neither Curtin nor
Beals has made any explanation of the
matters mentioned by Â£bain in his com
plaint, bat, be.ng charged with fraud
ulently withholding his business from
Sham, Curtin yesterday made the follow
ing statemt-nt :"
During the months of May and June last it
became evident to myself and to Mr. Beals
that Mr. Shaln was iiivo!ved. In the begin
ning of June I ascertained that a large sum of
money, over $2000. which had been passed
through the books during the previous month
and had helped to satisfy the most clamorous
of his creditors, was money that had bren col-
Ipced by Mr. ?hain on account of a cntleman
resident in this City, which amcuufMr. S.iain
was absolutely unable to repay. During the
first three weeks of the month of June Mr.
Sham was ab-ent from his office, dodging his
creditors. Toward the end of the month su
arrangement was arrived at by Mr. Sham. Mr.
Beals Rnd myself whereby lie agreed to leava
to us the straightening out of his affairs, and
promised to absent himself from 'he City for
three months, we all thlnkinx that Mr. Beal3
and myself could probably make a better set
tlement for him in his absence than he could
ao personally if r-re ent, to say nothias of the
fact that he trai daily in der.eer of arrest.
I insisted, on my pÂ«rt that Mr. Shaiu should
execute in my favor a power of attorney, irre
vocable for one year: Â«hould transfer all his
assets to me, in consideration of which I
agreed to endeavor to settle with his creditors,
si that at the end of three months he could
return and resume his business.
After the execution Of the power of attorney
ana the transfer of the assets in question Mr.
Sham left the City and stayed away about six
weeks. Durinc his absence" I settled with some
of his mos; pressing creditors, and made a3
thorough an examination into his affairs as
the time at my disposal permitted ; the result
of which investigation was that I ascertained
that bo far from s-hain owing only $-1000, his
liabilities ran up to over s*3i(.ooo,"aud, so far
from hi? assets being of the value represented
to me, they were not worth more than half
that value.
Ma-.ters progressed smoothly cnoueh until
Btept were taken by the attorneys for the credit
ors in the matter of the estate of Julius Schul
kt-n, in which estate Sha;n was the assignee,
to compel him to account for the money col
lected by him. Sham's failure to account for
the money handled in this matter created a
great deal of comment and was vent!la*ed in
the papers. He was subsequently removed
from the assigneeehip, and he looked upon
creditors as his most danger
ous ones.
In his anxiety to secure them he implored
me to disposed certain claims, in which he
had onij aconungeut interest, and would have
sacrificed his other creditors and disposed of
he did not o>vn, had I acted on his en
treaties.
The discovery of the extent of Mr. Sham's
liabilities and of the meas:erness of his in
Ehowed us that it was absolutely impossible to
extricMe him so that he could continue in
business in cccordauce with \ke programme
which had been laid down between us. Mr.
sham, contrary to his promise to absent him
self three month?, returned to the City secretly
about the beginning of August, when Mr.
Beals and mynelf had many and various inter
views with him, the retult'of which was that
we informed him that we could not work for
him any longer; that all we could do was to
endeavor to save him from arrest and wlrfVl up
his affairs and pay the money* recsived there
from to his creditors, and that we should start
in business on our own account as a new part
nership, in all ot which he acquiesced.
When in Aug:u3t, 1595, it becsme apparent
tfcs: there was nothing further we could
do for him. we explained tohira that we would
be obliged to give the matter up, as it was im
possible to extricate him and as the worry on
us was intense. He then transferred the con
tents of the office to Mr. B^als and admitted
that he had no further interest in the prop
erty. Since the transfer of *aid properly to
Mr. Seals I have heard from Sham ale* times,
but ior some three months I have not seen nor
heard of hin until the 31bt ult., when he
called and made a demand that I surrender to
him his books, papers and other property con
tained in our onW, and a'Â«o demanded an ac
counting. I refused to comply with his de
mand, except as to give him an accounting,
which I will do, as I consider he is entitled u>
this, but nothing more. I consider his credi
tors have some voice in his affairs, and until I
am compelled to by order of the court I will
not deliver up his books.

together with an injunction restraining
the defendants from future trespass on

The president of the Sportsmen's Pro

asked if his association would interest
itself in behalf of the defendants, said that
he wonid certainly instruct the attorneys
engaged by the association to defend any
of its members, but that he did not believe
in fighting the battles of sportsmen who
were in no wise connected with the asso

"I have not beard, 11 said Mr. Ahem, "of
any of our members being subponaed as
yet, but I trust that in case they sbouM be
summoned to appear before trie Superior
Court of Contra Costa County they will
give me immediate notice, as our associa

case is exactly similar to the one which
was decided recently in the Superior Conrt

to believe that the Superior Court"of Con

of the case in" question as did Judge
Burkles in an action brought against the
Mallard Clnb by the Teal-Cordelia pre
serve shooting clubs."
THE MONROE DOCTRINE
W. A. Morrison Reads an Ex
haustive Essay on That
Document.
The Doctrine as Understood To-Day
Is More Comprehensive Than
Monroe Declared.
A. F. Morrison, under the auspices of
the Mechanics' Institute, re;id an exhaus
tive and interesting essay on the Monroe
doctrine last evening.
"The Monroe doctrine," said he, "as it
is understood to-day, is something different
from what it was at the time of its declara
tion by President Monroe. The Monroe
declaration, aside from the political events
that calied it forth, was the embodiment
of a National sentiment which had grown
and developed among our people. But
the Monroe doctrine as it is understood to
day is much more comprehensive than
the simple declaration made by Monroe.
It represents a larger growth and a further
development.
"What .hat doctrine is has never been
authoritatively denned. Our understand
ing of what it is and its scope must be
gathered from a history of our country
and the declarations of our Presidents and
other distinguished statesmen as prece
dents.
"As in the case of the 'Balance of Power'
with Europe, we know thai our Nation be
lieves that the maintenance of the Monroe
doctrine is necessary to our safety and
welfare, and like the 'Balance r>f Power'
the doctrine seems to be flexible and elas
tic, and doubtless the scope of the as-er
t'on will, in a large measure, depend upon
the circumstances under which it may Le
invoiced.
"It will be seen, therefore, that an in
telligent understanding of this doctrine
must bs derived from a review of the
events which constitute its history."
The speaker proceeded to five a com
plete and comprehensive history of the
doctrine from its incipiency to the present
day, dwelling upon all those events in
National affairs that have seemed to re
pudiate, abandon or maintain it.
"The declaration of Monroe," continued
he, "did not mark any course of conduct
to be pursued, but merely asserted that
the interposition of the kind mentioned
would De considered as dangerous to our
peace and safety and as a manifestation of
an unfriendly disposition tovrard the
United ijtatesi
'This doctrine has never been indorsed
by any resolution or act of Congress, but
still remains the declaration of a President
and his cabinet.
"Nevertheless it is an eminently proper
and patriotic doctrine, and as such has
been indorsed by the people of the United
States, and needs no other sanction. The
peop'e, not Congress, rale this country.
''What the remedy should be for foreign
interposition the doctrine does not pre
tend to state.
"The doctrine does not contemplate
forcible intervention by the United States
in any legitimate contest, but it will not
permit any such contest to result in the
increase of European power or influence
on this continent, nor in the overthrow of
any existing jiovernment, nor in the estab
lishment of a protectorate over it, nor in
the exercise of any direct control over its
policy or institutions. Further than this
the doctrine does not go."

The Steamer Afridi Brought a
Very Big Cargo From the
Orient.
SHE REPLACED THE BELQIC.
Trouble Brewing Over the Repairing
of the Government Steamer
McDowell.
Amon? the arrivals early yesterday was
the Britisii steamer Afridi, undc-r charter
to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company. She takes the place of the
Belgio for this trip, and on her return to
Hongkong will load for Europe. The
Belfric's repairs will then be completed
and she will resume her regular run. The
Afridi brought no passengers in either
steerage or cÂ» bin, but there was 4718 tons
of central cargo stowed away in her hold.
Amonjr her crew are fourteen Koreans who
have acted as firemen ever since the
steamer went into the oriental trade.
The Afridi is designed for a carrier.
Gnat space and the rapid handling of
cargo seem to have been the main objects
with her builders. Accompanying this
she lias good steaming capacity, ar.cl dur
ing the run of 16 days ani 12 hours from
Yokohama an average of eleven and one
half knots an hour was maintained. She
is owned by the Mogul line and was built
at Neveustle-on-Tyue about twelve
months a^ro.
She is 300 feet long 46 feet wide and 23
feet 4 inches deep. Captain Thomas
Goldinsr, R. N. R., who is in command, is
better known on Pu^et t^ound than he is
in t^an Francisco. He was captain of the
steamer Mogul in the Northern Pacitic
line until that vessel was purchased by
;he Japanese Government to be used as a
transport during the war. The Afridi is
called after a tribe of Hindoos in Northern
Inlia.
The steam schooner SunoJ, which was
bar-bound at Coos Bay, arrived in port
yesterday. Captain Walvig says the
storm encountered during the latter part
of Df-Ct j mber was the heaviest he was over
in. The mouth of Columbia River was
reached all ri^ht, but the bar was break
ing heavily and the steamer was headed
for sea. Then the storm came up, and
the fciunol was swept fore and aft. One of
the boats was washed away, some of
the standing rigging snapped, the bul
warks were stove in and the cabin
was flooded. The steamer was driven
back as far as Coos Bay and Captain Wai
vis ran in there for shelter and repairs.
The vessel was fixed up temporarily and
then she was headed for San Francisco.
She docked at Little Main street and after
discharging will go on the drydock. It
will Drobably l.c a week before she gets
away apain for Ynquina Bay.
The cruisers Philadelphia and Boston
will both be open to the public to-day. At
1 p. m. all the otiicers and men will be
ready to receive their friends and a bij:
crowd of visitors are expected. Henry
Peterson, the oarsman, will run his launch
Amy at regular intervals and pll the boat
men in the bay will be on hand to carry
excursionists.
The British ship Godiva arrived from
Cardiff yesterday after an eventful voyage.
On beptember lb last she was caught in a
hurricane, and considerable damage was
dore. One of the apprentice boys was
washed overboard and drowned. It was
in latitude 34 south, longitude 47 west that
tne fatality happened. A heavy sea swept
the main deck, and before J. Fhidds could
catch a rope he was carried away- He was
17 years of age ana a native of Ireland.
The Fulton Iron Work's and the heart of
the quartermaster's department of the
army are at outs. The trouble is all over
the steamer McDowell, and some one will
be a heavy loser before the matter is
settled. About three months aso the
sternpost of the McDowell showed signs
of weaknebs, and the contract for a new
one and a new Zeiss propeller was let to
the Fulton Iron Works. The first post
made was too small, and the foreman
of the shop was discharged by the com
pany. The mistake was rectified, and a
few days ago the steamer began running
to Angel Island, Alcatraz and the Presidio
again. It did not take the engineer long
to find out that something was wrong.
The shaft does not fit closely into the
sternpoÃt, and in consequence" the wheel
almost floods the ship every trip. Again
the propeller acts splendidly when going
ahead, but in going astern it seems to have
no power over the vessel. In approaching
Clay-street wharf Captain Stoh'n has to
stop the McDowell about three wharves
away in order to gain control of the
steamer.
According to arrangements made by the
general, the McDowell was to have made
a couple of trips to the stations to-day.
These orders were countermanded late
yesterday, and instead the men from the
Fulton Iron Works will spend all day and
all night in trying to rectify the mistakes
made. The steamer has not yet been ac
cepted by the quartermaster.
Captain Allen will not go out in com
mand of the Benjamin F. Packard. He
will remain in San Francisco as the prin
cipal witness in the libel suit against the
tugs Sea Queen and Hercules for running
the ship on Mission Bay rock. Captain
McClune will take tne Packard to Europe
and thtnee to New York.
Darby, Leydon & Co., the contractors,
are busy getting Fair's water-front Jots
ready lor the winter storms. Extra clus
ters of piles are being put down and it is
thought there will be jio landslides. A
great deal of the land is now above high
water mark and the contractors are raak
inc rapid progress with the remainder.
The old steamer Gipsy is again to be put
in commission with Captain Leland in
command. She will take the piace of the
Coos Bay and will run every Tuesday and
Friday to Santa Cruz, Moss Landing, Mon
terey and Soquel.
A queer .looking craft attracted consid
erable attention at Jackson-street wharf
yesterday. She was originally intended
for a stern-wheel steamer, but was pur
chased by George B. Tolman and others
and litted up to work the tailings in the
Sacramento River. The name of the com
pany owning the ntrnnge outfit ia the
Golden Sand Placer Mining Company, and
it expects to make a big haul of paying
debris in the varion* rivers that run into
the Sacramento. The boat will be towed
up to the American River by the steamer
Constance, and there operations will be
begun. A description of how tne boat will
be operated has already appeared in The
Call.
A MOCK QUARREL.
Uow the Meat and Milk Inspectors
Trapped a liutcher Selling
Immature Veal.
The health officials, and particularly the
milk and meat inspectors, are chuckling
over their clever ruse to trap I. S. Soloman,
a butcher, for selling immature veal, and
inchientally over the sensation, a mock
quarrel, which formed a portion of the
play created.
Soloman was taken into custody by Milk
Inspector Dockery soon after he left his
establishment on Friday morning to drive
to the market with his load of calves. "As
it was desired to eaten him in tho act of
selling tho. calvas, Meat Inspector Davi3,
on bcinij: shown the veal at the police sta
tion, said with a great show of indignation
that tho calves were entirely lit for food
and that Inspector : Dockery was over
stepping the bounds of his duty in inter
fen with tho in.-pection of meat.

of the matter, but was taken seriously by
several bystanders who looked for active
hostilities, but were disappointed.
After Soiotnan had delivered his load he
was rearre6ted, and yesterday pleaded
ynilty in the Police Court.
The publicity given the affair was very
displeasing to Health Officer Lovelace,
who called the inspectors before him yes
terday morning and read them a lecture
in a mild way, at the same time giving
them instructions to work in harmony to
gether wnenever possible.
Yesterday the inspectors were hobnob
bing together in company with Veterinary
Sturgeon Creely and calling each other

more like friendship than enmity.

ELECTION COMMISSION
Supreme Court Is Expected to
Pass Upon Its Rights
To-Morrow.
Validity of the Recently Enacted Pri
mary Law Must Stand or Fall
With the Old One.
The Board of Election Commissioners
has not as yet arrived at a decision as to
what action it will take in regard to the
primary elections.
The time is becoming shorter in which
they shall select trom the various pre
cincts of the City thirty names on the last
assessment-roll as nearly as possible from
the several political parties. This selection
must, according to the new law, be made
during the month of January.
It will take a staff of about fifty men for
twenty-five days to accomplish this work,
and as their authority to act is not estab
lished, and as Auditor Broderick refuses to
either pay them any salary or that of any
of their help until their right to act is es
tablished by the Supreme Court, they are
waiting anxiously for a decision.
If the latter be opposed to the validity
of the law then the Mayor and other offi
cers who are ex-officio members of the
Election Commission as provided by the
old law will have to do the clerical work
themselves or volunteer to pay out of their
own pockets the wages of the people they
employ for that purpose.
The mere clerical .services for drawing
these names will cost the City about $5000.
The impression has got abroad that the
general primary law is to stand or fall
with the Election Commission law, but
this is regarded by legal lights as a mis
take. The two laws are claimed to be dis
tinct. The idea has arisen because of the
fact that the same principle is involved in
both cases. One being considered uncon
stitutional the other is likewise, because
they both provide for special legislation
with reference to the carrying on and con
ducting of elections.
Considerable interest is being felt as to
whether or not, in case the Election Com
mission bill be declared unconstitutional,
some public-spirited official will find a
means of having the constitutionality of
the primary law, its sister bill, tested and
save the City the needless expense of pre
paring for primaries which will never be
held should the law ultimately be declared
unconstitutional.
The test case is now before the Supreme
Court and the impression is that a deci
sion wil be reached early this coming weeK.
It is the case of Denman against Auditor
Broderick.
Cliampngne Imports Into San Francisco.

LOSS OF THE ARCTURAS.
Another American Vessel That
Went Down in the Recent
Storm.
THE CARPENTER WAS DROWNED
After the Cables Parted the Bark
Drifted Ashore and Soon Went
to Pieces.
Another wreck has to be added to the al
ready long list of disasters in the recent
storm. One by one the old-timers are
strewing their bones along the shore line
of the Pacific Ocean.
The latest addition to the list of wrecks
is the American bark Arcturas. She was
built in 1866, in Kennebunk, Me., and in
1882 became the property of \V. J. Adams,
the well-known lumber-dealer. She was
one of the be.-t-known traders on the coast,
and in spite of her age was considered per
fectly safe and seaworthy. About two
years ago she was laid up in Oakland
Creek, and when again put in commission
her seams were found to be all open, so a
thorough overhauling was given her.
While lying on the mud flats a sailor
who had made a trip around the Horn on
her in IS'3B was a frequent visitor to the
vessel. He searched the Hull again and
ajrain for $1200, w iich he said had been
stolen from him and secreted in the frame
work of the ship by his messmates. Ac
cording to his story, the money was gained
in a gambling speculation, but tnough
every man on the Arcturas at the time was
searched the money was never found.
After the Arcturas was refitted she went
from here to Puget Sound and entered into
the lumber trade. The last time she was
here a new crew was placed on board and
she sailed for Vancouver Island on Septem
ber 20. Captain James Sloane was in com
mand, and everybody expected a success
ful voyage.
At Vancouver Island the Arcturas loaded
poles for the mines at Santa Rosalia, but
before she could get away H. Cooper, the
carpenter, left her and a new man had to
I be sent from San Francisco. Agent Adams
I applied to the Ship-owners' Association,
which sent a man by the steamer Uma
tilla. No one seems to know this carpen
ter's name, and strange to say he was the
only member of the crew drowned in the
wreck.
On the arrival of the carpenter the
Arcturas got under way. On October 16
last she passed Cape Flattery, and after a
successful run reached Santa Rosalia on
November 21. The cargo of pole s was dis
charged, and, just as Captain Sloano was
preparing to get his ballast aboard, the
storm came up that did ali the damage.
It blew harder and harder until on Decem
ber 30 the cables parted one after another
and the bark went ashore. All of the crew
with the exception of the caipenter were
rescued. The body of the missing man
was never seen again.
As soon as Captain Sloane learned that
bis vessel was a total loss he started for
Guaymas, and from there he telegraphed
to his owners as follows:
Arcturas parted her cables and went ashore
during a Rnlc. Total loss. Carpenter drowned.
Cargo was discharged. What shall 1 do? Ad
dress care of the American Consul at Guay
mas.
The Arcturas was insured for $6000, so
her owners will not lose a great amount
by the wreck. She was 1007 tons net
burthen, 168 feet long, 36 feet 7 inches
broad and 23 feefr 2 inches deep. Captain

OLD, SICK AND POOR.
Suicide of Robert H. Moore, a Member
of the Masonic Fraternity and a
Stranger in the City.
Sixty years old, sick, without money,
and a stranger, was the burden of the rea
son giv-m in two letters by Robert H.
Moore, a civil engineer, for committing
suicide yesterday morning at 1339 Valen
cia street. He shot himself in the ripht
temple with a big revolver.
Moore came here from Denver about two
weeks ago. Since then, being a Mason, he
ceiled on Harry J. Lask, the chairman of
the Masonic board of relief, for assistance,
but incidentally he informed Mr. Lask that
he had $75 in his possession, so nothing
was done for him. The board would nave
taken steps to send him to Denver but for
that.
For over a week Moore had suicide on
his mind. On December 28 he wrote a let
ter, telling of his Masonic record, inti
mating that he might die at any time and
asking the fraternity to look" after his
body. A communication of similar im
nort he penned on the day following. On
Friday night he remarked to his landlady,
Mrs. Elizabeth Potts, that a man in his
condition niisht as well "blow out his
brains," and during the night his 19-year
old son, Georce A. Mcore, awoke and d's
covored his father gloomily handling his
pistol. Ha finally killed himself at 9:30
a. m. Just before the deed of solf-destruc
tion he wrote in pencil on the back of one
of the letters:
I, with my own hand, open the portals of
eternity.
In the two letters he stated that he
became a Mason in this City in 1872, by
initiation into Occidental Lodce No.' 22,
ami the next year became a Royal -Arcli
Mas. in, as a member of California Chapter
No. 5. In 1883 he went to Newport, Rho-le
Island, where lie united with St. John's
Lodge No. 1, and Newport Chapter No. 2.
according to his statements, and was still
in pood standing. For eighteen months
he had been sick, and he had been advised
by his doctors in the East and Denver to
go to California. The following extract is
taken from one of his letters:
I wns 60 years old November 17, nrd am
broken down'in healt'i and spirit*. When a
man of my age is old, poor and sick, and not
able to work, he is better out of the world than
m it. as ha has outlived his usefulnessand a de
pendent. Poverty aud old age are two bad
companions. Robert H. Moore.
He left a request that the fraternity take
care of his son. His son formerly lived
in Oakland.
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR.
The Restaurateurs of This City Must
Henceforth Fay Thoir Bills
la Fall.
The restaurateurs who feel strong in
their ability to meet their bills have re
cently been holding meetings for the pur
pose of protecting the wholesale dealers
with whom they do business, and inci
dentally to arrange matters so that they of
the restaurant calling may henceforth do
business on an equal basis with all com
petitors.
Some twenty of the craft came together
Friday in Washington Hall, on Eddy
street, August E. Drucker presiding. He
explained that there was no desire on the
part of those assembled to press a hard
ship on unsuccessful rivals, hut that it was
desirable that action should be taken to
urge wholesalers to demand full payment
for all goods purchased by restaurant
keepers.
This unique stand is the outcome of a
number of failures which have recently
occurred. First. Manning's oyster-house
on Powell street, conducted by Pike,
failed ; then Gray's place on Market street
went under; following this came the fail
ures of Meyers' place on Ellis street and of
The Palm on Market street.
In speaking of these unfortunate occur
ranceslast nicht Mr. Drucker stated to a
Call reporter:
We, the men who pay dollar for dollar for
the Roods we buy. cannot possibly compete
against men who buy goods and only pay 10
cents on thÂ« dollar, we want to have the
wholesalers stand firm and make these people
pay up or go out of business.
At the meeting heretofore mentioned a
committee of rive, consisting of Messrs.
ZiiiKand, Page, Rustemeyer, Gall and Wil
son, was appointed to interview the
downtown merchants to secure their co
operation. Already yesterday complimen
tary letters were received by Mr. Drucker,
commending the action which the meeting
liad taken. They were signed by such
firms as W. Cluff & Co., Wheaton, Brown
& Co., the Wf-rtheimer Company and ihe
Del Monte Milling Company.
DRIVES HOOK BLAMED.
A. Coroner's Jury I. a; k George W.
Cook's I). :ith in Him.
Two inquests were held by Coroner
Hawkins yesterday. One was on the body
of George W. Cook, whose death on the
31st ult. was the result of being run over
by a wagon driven by Charles Hook on
Market street, near Steuart, and the other
an investigation into the circumstances of
the fate of Charles Dougherty, the sailor,
run over by a train of the bo ft line.
In the Cook case Hook was blamed for
careless driving. Hook has been already
arrested and his case conies up for a hear
ing on Tuesday. With regard to Dough
erty, it was .shown that he was under the
influence of liquor shortly before he was
discovered run over by the train. From
the evidpnee the jury saw it could not at
tach any blame to either the railroad com
pany or Mr. Dougherty.
UNCLE GEORGE'S BOOK
"A Retrospect From the Mizzen
top" to Be the
Title.
George T. Bromley Will Enter the
Field of Literature, Backed as
a Winner.
Uncle George T. Bromley has decided to
settle down to a quiet life and write a
book.
This determination to engage in literary
pursuits was not formed on the impulse of
the moment, but is the result of long and
profound reflection. It does not sisnify,
by any means, that Mr. Bromley's pur
pose is to withdraw from the activities of
life, but he contemplates checking the
pace somewhat and giving attention to
literature as a zest.
His book will be called "A Retrospect
Fsom the Mizzentop," and from that out
look be will view the wake of his life.
Scenes of his early life at sea have left a
lasting impression on his mind, hence it
follows that his book is to bear a marine
title.
In 1831 he made his first voyage from
New London to the coast of Africa, and
was away from home twenty-two months.
He was subsequently a cabin boy on a
Liverpool packet, and still later on the
blockading fleet off Vera Cruz, in the war
with Mexico.
The volume will deal largely in reminis
cences of early times in California. Uncle
George was once mate of a Sacramento
River boat and was nine years conductor
on the first railroad in Californiaâ the line
from Sacramento to Folsom". He began
his service on the rail in 1855. As he says:
"I was a railroad man before the days of
the bellpunch, and during my term as
conductor three of the directors of the
company died poor."
Uncle* George know 3 how to keep hotel.
As a landlord he pained renown in Santa
Cruz, Santa Barbara and San Jose. He
kept a tavern like the inn of which Wil
liam Shenstone wrote on the window:
Whoe'er has traveled life's dull round â
Where'er his stages may have beenâ
May sigh to think he still hes found
The wannest welcome at an inn.
Mr. Bromley has stumped the State in
the Republican cause, along with Timothy
Guy Phc'.ps, E. S. Lippett, George A.
Knight and Judge Joseph McKenna.
On his own account he has made a good
many independent speeches. In the con
sular service he passed four years at Tien
tsin. China, and gained the highest re
gard in diplomatic circles. During his
career in the Orient he never missed a
function or lost the point of a story.
The book ought to be brisht, breezy and
instructive from the first chapter to the
linish. The writer has had ample oppor
tunity to study the social or human phase
of many of the illustrious men of Cali
fornia. His intellect is alert, his memory
bright, and his resolution to engage a
stenographer and write a book is fixed.
His literary work will take much of his
time, but will notcompel him to neglect
his duties as an honorary life member of
the Press Club and the Bohemian Club.

to that time Point Reyes had not been
heard from, but now it proposes to be an
important factor in the milk industry.
All the arrangements for a full supply
have now been perfected, and in a few
weeks the supply of Point Reyes butter
will cease and a line of small gasoline
steamers will do nothing but carry fresh
ruilk to San Francisco in the morning and
supplies back at night.
The little schooner Nettie Low has for
years been known as "the Point Reyes
butterboat." Year in and year out Cap
tain "JarcK" Low has never missed a trip,
ami the quantities of the "gilt edge" that
he has carried would take an accountant
to compute. Since the rise in prices, how
ever, the creameries and dairymen at Point
Reyes have come to the conclusion that it
will pay better to sell the milk in San
Francisco than to make butter and cheese.
They have accordingly decided to build
two sister schooners to the JNettie Low and
run them between this port and Point
Reyes. During the trip 1o San Francisco
a6oline will be used and fast time made.

As the distance is only twenty-five miles,
it i 9 expected that the boats will easily get
lie re by tf o'clock in the morning.
During the afternoon all the empty cans
and stores will be collected, and then by
the aid of canvas Point Reyes can easily
be reached in time lor another trip on the
third day. At present the Nettie Low is
getting a thorough overhauling at Kneass'
shipyards. As soon as her repairs are
completed the new state of affairs will be
inaugurated. The new boat to keep her
company Is now almost completed, and
she will be^in alternating with the Nettie
Ix>w in about a fortnight. When the
third schooner is completed there will be
a milkboat going and coming every day
in the week.
"Point Reyes will be able to send a
schooner load of rnilfc to San Francisco
every morning in the year," said Captain
Jack Low yesterday. "Every ounce of it
will be above the standard arid the chances
are that one of the vessels will be called
Dockery. It is simply a question of bring
ing your poods to the best market. For
years Point Reyes butter has commanded
a better price than any other brand in the
market, and if we can produce Root butter
it is a foregone conclusion that we must
have good milk. Of course the making of
butter will not be discontinued, but the
creat majority of the dairymen will now
send their milk to tSan Francisco. 1 '
The new line of milk schooners wil
dock at Jackson-street wharf, and the car
riers who buy from the country producers
will now have to take in those vessels as
well as the Oakland and Tiburon ferry
boats.

REV. DR. C. O. BROWN DEFINES HIS MOTIVES
As Prosecutor of Mrs. Da
vidson He Is Plied With
Questions.
HIS ANGER IN COURT.
Judge Campbell Quashes All
Efforts to Elicit the Facts
of the Scandal.
CONTINUANCE TILL TUESDAY.
Suspicions as to Mrs. Tunnell's Dis
appearanceâMrs. Davidson's
Serenity.
There were two dramatic scenes in Judge j
Campbell's court yesterday daring the j
hearing of the case of Mrs. Davidson,
charged by Dr. C. O. i'.r. vn with extortion, j
The first came when Attorney Gallagher â¢
asked the reverend gentleman if it v;ere \
true that he had at any time given a drug J
to his wife for purposes named by the
defendant.
The question fell like a thunderbolt, and !
in the mi I I of the buzz of excitement I
which followed, Dr. Brown, quivering with
rage, his face of ashen hue. sprang from
the witness' chair, advanced a step or two,
and shaking his linger in the face of Mr.
Gallagher, said :
"You infernal scoundrel, you would not
dare do tliie outside the protection of the
courtroom."
There was shuffling of feet and a move
ment liKe the prelude of a resounding !
cheer, when the court tapped for order >
and said in his most severe tones:
"Order, order, gentlemen! That will
not be allowed in this court. Mr. Gal
lagher, lestionsof this kind are not ad- 1
niissible, md I warn you not to attempt ;
it again. '' !
The Eecond episode was when M rs. j
Davidson took the stand to tell the story
as already published in The Cam.. Attor
ney Gallagher desired a continuance on I
the ground that his client was worn out
with the day's proceedings and hence not ;
. physically able to stand Mie trying ordeal.
Judge Campbell turned to the aged pris
oner asked if she desired a continuance.
The people did not know what to ex
pect â whether a burst of righteous indig
nation or a ilood of repentant tear?.
Every ear was turned to catch the iirst
word and every eye was iixed on the aged
prisoner, whose face bore no trace of hos
tile feeling, but was wreathed in a peace
ful, happy smile. With her eyes cast
heavenward and speaking in strong, de
liberate tones, Mrs. Davidson said:
"I trust the good Lord, our God, will
protect a poor old lady acting in the cause
of justice. If you wish to go on I will tell
the truth in this case."
Again was there a hum of excitement,
but before an actual demonstration could
be made court was adjourned until 1:30
o'clock Tuesday.
An unusually large crowd was in attend
ance at both morning and afternoon ses
sions, including the friends of the princi
pals implicated in the scandal. Judge
Campbell secured Judge Bahrs' court
room, in order, probably, that the curious
minded could be comfortably accommo
dated.
Just as the interested spectators had
settled back in their seats in anticipation
of something racy, Judge Campbell rose
and, with a merry twinkle in his eye,
said: "I secured this room from Judge
Bahrs, but it seems that the janitor ob
jects, so another migration is necessary.
The proceedings will be held in Judge
Belcher's room, and Iâ"
But the crowd did not wait to hear any
thing more. It made a wild rush for the
new scene, men pushing aside women in
their mad desire to be lirst, and the women,
not less gentle in their movements, pushed
those aside who appeared weaker than
themselves. It was some little time before
the doors were opened, and in the mean
time a squad of police appeared on the
scene and soon quieted the struggling
mass.
Detective Seymour was the first new wit
ness called. He told the story of the arrest
of Mrs. Davidson and how she had acknowl
edged receiving $500 from Dr. Brown for
the purpose of preventing certain things
reflecting on the minister's secret life from
becoming public property. She had acted
eimply as agent for a Mrs. Baddin, who
kept a lodging-house on Sixth and Bryant
streets.
" The prosecuting witness (Dr. Brown) was
then again placed on the stand. The rever
end gentleman showed plainly that the
case was a burden to him. He was pale,
nervous and to a degree haggard, though
he aswered all questions in the same quick
manner that characterized his first days'
presence on the witness-stand.
Dr. Brown commenced by describing
the several vis'ts of Mrs. Davidson. "At
first she was very pleasant," he said, "but
later became menacing. On the eveninz
of November 22 her manner became
very" â
"I object," interruptea Attorney Gal
lagher. "I abandoned the cross-examina
tion in order to move for a dismissal, and
I am opposed to further testimony, which,
at best, is a mere matter of conclusion."
"I am anxious for the truth to appear,"
said the Judge. "The objection is over
ruled."
Dr. Brown was then permitted to go on
with his statement concerning th<Â» atti
tude of Mrs. Davidson on the occasion of
her visits to him, at the conclusion of
which Attorney Gallagher moved for a
dismissal.
"I ask this for the defendant," he said,
"on the ground that the charge is not sus
tained. Mrs. Badden is the only one who
can contradict defendant's statement that
she got the money for Mrs. Badaen. The
prosecution must show that no such per
son as Mrs. Baddin exists. It is not neces
sary for the defendant to show that such a
person exists. The burden of proof falls
on the prosecution."
Judge Campbell held that nothing had
as yet been clearly established, and so de
nied the motion for dismissal.
At the afternoon session, while Dr.
Brown was being cross-examined, quite a
tilt occurred between him and Attorney
Gallagher. The minister grew indignant
at the persistency of the examining coun
| sel to secure a certain answer relating to
i his visit to Captain Lees.
"My reason for hesitating is because I
realize that I am dealing with a tricky
man," said Dr. Brown.
"That is all right," replied Gallagher,
"but don't you at times indulge in a little
trickery yourself?"
Mrs. Gray and MrÂ«. Thurston are firm in
: the belief that the missing witness, Mr?.
Tunnell, has been induced to go into hid
ing, though that she could consent to such
n. scheme is a great shock to them. Mrs.
Cray goes so far as to suggest foul play,
though she is careful not to give any
names as the probable responsible parties.
Mrs. Davidson says she is honestly glad
to be in prison, giving as a reason that she
is in fear of her life. "1 am S3fer here than
anywhere else," she said, "though I am
compelled to be very careful as it is. Only
to-day a lady visitor warned me not to eat
\ anything coming from outside the prison.
i While 1 appreciated the motive of my
friend, the warning was hardly necessary,
for I already knew that my life was not
safe."
Dr. Brown will not occupy the pulpit of
the First Congregational Church to-day.
Ho save as a reason the pending investi
gation.
COURT PROCEEDINGS.
The Case of Mrs. Davidson, Charged
With Extortion, on Trial Befora
Judge Campbell.
As soon as .Fudge Campbell had disposed
of some petty criminal yesterday morning
he announced that the case of Mrs. Mary
A. Davidson, charged with extortion by 0.
0. Brown, pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church, would be resumed in Judge
Bahrs' courtroom. This sent the crowd
that was present in as large numbers as on
Thursday, when the preliminary hearing
began, scampering to the second story of
the New City Hall, headed for the court
room named. After all were comfortably
settled Judge, Campbell, with a smile that
showed he appreciated the humor of the
situation, announced that another migra
tion was in order, and that the goal this
time was the courtroom of Judge Belcher.
Another headlong race followed, and it
was 11:45 a. M. before Judge Campbell
asked :
Gentlemen, are you ready to proceed?
Lloyd- -Doctor, lake the stand, please.
ourtâ Will all the witnesses in the case
please retire?
After the prosecuting witness. Dr. C. O.
Brown, bad taken tiie stand, the last ques
tions of Thursday night's session were read
MRS. C. O. BROWN.
[Sketched in the courtroom yesterday by a "Call" artitt.]
on request of Attorney Gallagher. The
latter then continued his cross-examina
tion of the witness, as follows:
Doctor, I am going to abandon the line of
cross-examination 1 ivns pursuing when you
were lust on the stand, and would ask you
whether or not any part of this moneyâ the
sjCioO â that you rave to Mrs. Davidson was
going to Mis. Baddin.
\\ Itness â I don't know anything about it.
You don't know Mrs. Baddin?
No, sir.
When this money was given to Mrs. David
son, ii was given to her for the purpose of giv
ing it to Mrs. Baddin. us she told you?
It was given to her for the purpose of stop
ping a threatened publication. 1 do not know
of my own knowledge that it was given to Mrs
Baddin.
This ended the cross-examination of the
witness for the time, with the understand
ing tliat he might be recalled by the de
fen3e if denied desirable.
J. F. Seymour, the. officer who served
the warrant on and arrested Mrs. Davidson,
was then called for the prosecution and
sworn. He testified to having served the
warrant on the 28th of December last, and
then Mr. Lloyd asked:
At that time did you have any conversation
With defendaut? If so, what?
Seymourâ l had a conversation with her at
her residence, 225 Geary street.
The courtâ Was the conversation free and
voluntary?
1; was.
Lloydâ What was it?
Seymourâ l called on â¢ Mrs. Davidson, in
formed her who I was and stated 1 hud a war
rani for her arrest and that 1 was a police ofli
cer. She asked me who swor.- the warrant out
and I told her Dr. Brown. She said she knew
Dr. Brown and I told her the charge was ex
lortion. 1 told her Dr. Brown charged her
with blackmailing Jhlm out. of $500. I asked
her if she got the $500 from Dr. Brown. I
aske 1 her what she did with the money. She
said she got it to give to Mrs. Bnddin'. Mrs.
Baddin was a lady who kept a lodging-house at
Sixth and Bryant streets. She said she was never
in that vicinity, in her life. I asked her how
she became acquainted with Mr*. Baddin. She
said Mrs. Baddin called at her place of buslnes-s
and bought a corset, and in tno conversation
that took place the name of Dr. Brown was
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
mentioned; that Mrs. Baddin told her: "I
keep a lodging-houso and you are a church
member. You don't know as much about
preachers as I do." She then told ber she saw
Dr. Brown go to the lodging-house with a lady,
and some few days after Mrs. Baddin called
again and told Mr.". Davidson that the lady she
saw with Dr. Brown was n lady stopping inner
(Mrs. Davidson's) house. Mrs. Davidson said
! the hi'iv was Miss Overman.
Lloydâ That Is all.
The cross-examination of the witness
was then begun by Attorney Gallagher as
follows:
She told you the intent with which she got
j the money for Mrs. Baddin, and she told you
the doctor gave it to her for Mrs. Baddin?
Seymourâ Yes, sir. There was something
I else 1 would like to state.
Gallagherâ l am not asking for it.
Lloydâ Anything farther that yon recollect?
Se\ nioar I had the receipt t-.nd showed it to
Mrs. Davidson r: 1 nsked her if she ever srw
thatpapei bef/vt. She said she had, and said
itwusl-r-;-. -rrrote it iti Dr. Brown's study
the dictation of Dr. Brown at the time she
received the mane; from l>r. Brown.
Gallaghei -That is all, Mr. Seymour.
Lloydâ That is the case for the prosecution.
The courtâ the prosecution rest?
Lloydâ Yes, sir.
Gallagher- -If your Honor please, I desire
now to make a motion to dismiss the charge
against the defendant on the groundâ
The courtâ want to ask Dr. Brown a ques
-1 tion or two more.
j-iloydâ Doctor, take the stand.
When the prosecuting witness resumed
; his place on the stand Judge Campbell
asked :
| At the meeting: in your office on the 21st and
i 22d of November what was the manner of the
â  defendant in addressing you? State whether
i or not she was i>lcasant "or what her manner
was.
<;a!lagherâ Objection on the ground it is
calling for a conclusion.
Toe courtâ Witness may state how defendant
acted.
Brownâ When she first came Into my office
at S o'clock on the 21Â«t her manner was" pleas
ant for a little time until I proceeded to rend
the paper and I told her it was no use to go
further. Then it became menacing until well
nigh the close of the conversation, and she
whs also excited.
Gallagherâ lf your Honor does not wish to
pass on my motion I am willing to go on.
The courtâ l want to Ret a little moro infor
mation. I want to find out whether there was
an actual extortion committed, ami to find out
it there was anything new (addressing the
witness) on the 22d.
Gallagherâ Objection, It would bean opinion
onlyâ a conclusion.
The courtâ Objection overruled.
Brown â When Mrs. Davidson had given me
the document I was absolutely ignorant of the
name of the lodging-house keeper.
Gallagherâ We still desire to have a fuller
cross-examination.
The courtâ The witness has not yet answered
my last question.
Brownâ She appeared to be angry.
Gallagherâ Objection. It is an opinion of
the witness.
The courtâ l deny the motion to dismiss.
(iallagherâ l desire again at tlus stage of the
proceedings to ask your honor 10 dismiss the
charge against the defendant. First, that it
does nol appear here that this defendant is
guilty of the particular act ehareed. It does
not appear here that she levied extortion upon
the doctor. They nave failed to prove that the
for which she claimed she had received
tins money was not true. If there was any
presumption of law to be drawn, the
existence of Mrs. Baddin must be admitted.
They have failed to show thnt Mr.-.
Baddin did not get the money, and the pre
s:-caption is that Mrs. Htiddin* did get the
money. If defendant got the money from the
doctor fur Mrs. Baddin that would not be
called extortion, and if she did not get it for
Mrs. I!mla;ii it would be getting money under
retenses. J must assume that the testi
mony given here is true, and there is no evi
dence here to contradict Mrs. Davidson's story,
that she went to the doctor for any other pur-
i â than to assist him in protecting himself
from the scandal that would result from the
publication of this story, and not for the pur
i of levying blackmail ns one of k con
spiracy. Then she is not guilty of this crime.
Mrs. Baddin is the only one who can contra
dict defendant that sle got the money for Mrs.
Baddin. The prosecution must prove the guilt
defendant beyond a doubt. They must
show that ru 1 such person as Mrs. Baddin ex
ists, it is not necessary for the defend
ant to prove that she" does exist. The
burden of proof rests on the prose
cution. The proposition is: First, lihs
the crime of extortion been committed?
We claim that there is nothing in the evidence
w that the crime of extortion wh>
committed, but that this money was obtained,
] If it was obtained, under false pretenses. The
I doctor gave the money for Mrs. Baddin. If
i there is no Mrs. Baddin it was obtaining
i money under fal*e pretenses, and as the com
! plaint does not charge this crime we ask your
! honor to smut our motion. If they think it is
I securing money under false pretenses let them
bring the proper action.
Attorney Guilfoyle then took up the ar
gument on behalf of the defense along
similar line?, and was followed by Attor
ney Lloyd, who defined the crime of extor
tion according to the statute and in the
light of recent decision?, claiming that the
; present was clearly a case covered by the
statute. In the course of his argument the
latter said: "The existence of Mrs. Bad
â  din is a question of no importance at all.
â  If the defendant is Mrs. Baddin and Mrs.
Badum is a myth, then she induced this
man to part with money by fear and
threats, and if that is not a clear case of
extortion then it is impossible to make
| ont."
it being claimed by the defense that it
; was necessary to show intent on the part
of the defendant in order to establish the
criminality of her act, Attorney Lloyd, in
; controverting this proposition, quoted
; from decisions to show that where an act
i is specifically made a crime intent cuts no
! figure and claimed that the case under dis
cussion was covered by these decisions.
Ex-Judge Louderback followed his col
| league, confining himself more particularly
! to showing the difference between the
crime of extortion :u:d that of obtaining
money under false pretenses. During hia
:ir_-;ii!ient he took occasion to remark that
, the crime of blackmail under the circuru
stances testified to in this case was one to
, which women who had once been con
j victed ot some offense were peculiarly
; addicted when they ran short of money.
| The crime, he said, "was very common in
, this and all large cities of the Union. He
then called attention to that part of Dr.
! Brown's testimony in which Sirs. David
; son claimed to have power over Mrs.
| Baddin from the fact that she was in
' possession of a dark secret in her life.
REV. DR. C. O. BROWN' ON THE WITNESS . STAND.
[Sketched yesterday by a " Call" artist.]
This, he said, was no new proposition. It
was, he said, the course that was fre
quently resorted to by blackmailers.
In his closing argument Attorney Gal
lagher said: ''The receipt he demanded
from Mrs. Davidson to protect him (Dr.
Brown) showed he was afraid of such a
secret. Mrs. Davidson never since tried
to levy further blackmail on him. Does
that show that she had any personal in
terest in the matter so far ns the money is
concerned? This motion is made in char
ity for the protection of the prosecuting
witness. We wish to prevent further pub
lication of this scandal â to prevent de
fendant going on the stand and telling all
she knows regarding this secret of Dr.
Brown's."
At the conclusion of his argument At
torney Gallagher asked the court to take
the matter under advisement, as the de
! fense, and perhaps the prosecution, might
j want to bring further authorities to the
notice of the court. Attorney Lloyd said
j he was willing to have the court take the
j matter under advisement, bat the court
â  stated that he required no time to make
his decision, speaking as follows:
I think that all the facts nnd the testimony
atnl the actions of the defendant in the office
of the prosecuting witness establish in my
mind that she went tnere for the purpose of
j frightening Dr. Brown Into paying her money.
Ber action and manner, as described by the
. prosecuting witness, show this, she did nol
go there in a kind, Christian spirit to protect
him. She went there, 1 think, from the man
ner described, toobtain money irom Dr. Brown
for herself, it seems that way to me. Admit
ting nli these facts to be true, she went there
and became excited, produced this receipt and
refused to give the name of the nameless
woman and said it would be no use for Dr.
Brown to see the woman. The motion is de
nied. Exception noted by defense.
Gallagherâ Take the stand, Dr. Brown.
At this point one of the attorneys an
nounced that he had begun to suffer from
the pangs of hunger and suggested that a
recess be taken. The court was then ad
journed to 2:16.
It was 2:35, however, before the proceed
ings were resumed. Dr. Brown was re
called for further cross-examination and
was asked by Attorney Gallagher regard
ing a paper that he had prepared ami given
to the press of the City immediately after
the arrest of Mrs. Davidson. Dr. Brown
had been instructed by the court to have
this document in court, but confessed that
he had forgotten about it and immediately
dispatched his son, who was present, for
the missing paper.
Attorney Lloyd endeavored to prevent
the introduction of this paper by com
pelling the defense to state the exact pur
port of it; but Mr. Gallagher refused to
commit himself further than to say that
the paper he wanted was the one that ]>r.
Brown had read to the newspaper report
ers in the office of Captain Lees on the
day that Mrs. Davidson was arrested and
which appeared in the morning papers of
the following day, concluding: "I don't
propose to be tricked."
Awaiting the return of Dr. Brown's son
Attorney Gallagher resumed the cross
examination of the witness, us follows:
Doctor, did you have any conversation about
Mrs. Baddin, or about the nameless woman
whom you afterward learned was Mrs. Bad
din, prior to the 21st of November with Mrs.
Davidson ?
Objection on the ground that the ques
tion did not relate to the three occasions
offered in the direct examination of the
witness.
Attorney Gallagherâ l am asking It for the
purpose of contradicting the witness regard
ing matters that occurred on these three occa
sions. If I can show that he lias made a state
ment that at the time he saj"s this conversa
tion was held it was held in her rooms,
and not in the church at all-, I have a right to
ask this question. I want to show that the
action of Mrs. Davidson mid her demand did
not occur in the church, but in her house, and
I want to show it by his own statement. lam
asking him now fi he had any previous meet
ing whore Mrs. Baddeu was mentioned. I want
to fisk this for the purpose of showing the
credibility of witness, and also the intent with
vvhich Mrs. Davidson went to the church and
all her meetings with witness.
Objection sustained.
Gallagherâ Did yon not, In the latter part of
December, 1894, make a confession freely and
as follows to the defendant that you loved a
friend with a love far exceeding that for your
Wife and thnt the woman was Miss Nettie
Overman? Did you make any such confes
sion?
Lloyd (to witness)â Wait a moment. (To
court)â Objection on the ground that it is not
proper cross-examination, ns it does not re
fer i" the three occasions covered in the direct
examinations of the witness.
Brownâ l would like to answer that ques
tion.
Lloydâ Don't you answer any question until
you are permitted.
(inllaghcrâ l protest to the action of the wit
ness and his counsel. They should not be per
mitted to give us these displays, which are
made for the purpose of givingthe public the
impression that the witness is willing to an
swer these questions. (To witness)â Did you
not in the month of August, 1895, tell de
fendant that you had given Mrs. Tunnell $10
to be given to Mattie Overman?
Objection on same ground as before.
Sustained.
(lallagher (to court)â l ask this question for
the purpose of showing the intent with which
the defendant acted. (To witness)â Did you
not in August, 1895. call at the defendant's
house and leave the sum of $3.") with the de
fendant for Miss Overman, saying that you
desired to assist Miss Overman?
Objection on same grounds as before.
Same ruling.
The courtâ l don't see why you Insist on ask
iue these questions.
GpUfoyleâ l will explain why we take this
position. If the witness should die the prose
cution would have the right to read his testi
mony, and we usk these questions so that
when we go to the Superior Court and the wit
ness dies and goes out of the State we may pro
tect the defendant in her right. We want to
be in a position to raise the point of the ad
lnissibihty of the statement of witness.
I.loydâ one question of that kind is enough
lor the Superior Court to base its decision
upon.
Gallagherâ Did not the defendant on the oc
casion last mentioned, August, 1895, ask you
if you still cherished the old unlawful love" for
Miss Overman? And did you not reply: "I do
not wish to have anything more to do with
her, and that she may not hove any reason to
see me I will pay you the money to give to
her?"
Objection on the same ground. Same
ruling.
Did you not call in the month of December,
1805. and remain at the defendant's house and
remain with Mlw Overman and the defendant
two hours, and when you were leaving did you i
not hand Misa Overman .*35 in the presence of
defendant,?
Objection on the same ground. Same
ruling.
Did yon visit Syracuse within the last year?
Brown â I did.
\\ hen did you return?
I think I arrived here on the 7th of Novem
ber, 1 >â¢!<;>.
Soon after your return from Syracuse did you
call (in defendant and hand her $35 for Miss
Overman?
Objection on the same ground. Same
ruling.
Was Deacon Mor?e present at any of the
meetings at the church?
Objection on the same ground. Same
ruling.
At the time when I have asked when Deacon
Morse was present, did Deacon Kerr come into ',
the same room? . SrS
Same objection. Same ruling. .
Did you have any conversation with this de
fendant on the 19th of November when either
Deacon Kerr or Deacon Morse was present?
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did you not at one of those meetings on the
21st or 22d of November, 1895, make a con
fe.-sion to this defendant tnat you had fur
nished some medicineâ ergot â \6 Miss Over
man to effect a certain purpose?
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did yon at any other time make a confession
to Mrs. Davidson that you had furnished ergot
to Miss Overman for this certain purpose?
At this point tlie witness began to show
signs of deeD and suppressed passion and
was about to make a vehenent reply when
he was stopped, and ever alert and "always
calm Mr. Lloyd made the usual objection.
Attorney Guilfoyle then argued the ad
missibiiity of this question as follows:
We offer this evidence for this reason: If it
be true and he did give this woman ergot he
was guilty of a felony, and if he entered into
negotiations with this woman he was guilty
with this woman. If we can prove this there
must be more corroborative evidence to sus
tain this charge against this defendant. We
Wish to prove that this stale of affairs did
exist: that defendant and Brown entered into
a conspiracy to keep from a magistrate the
commission of a felony, and that he is an ac
cessory io the fact. We contend that both par
ties were conspirators to this extent, that they
conspired to keep the facts from the ears of a
magistrate.
Objection sustained.
Gallagherâ Did not the defendant speak to
yon oi the enormity of the crime of giving
ergot to the woman.
Same objection. Same ruling.
Gallagherâ Did you not Eay, "My wife takes
ergot for this purpose?"
This was th* last straw, and the passion
of the witness burst its bounds. He
writhed in his seat for a second or two,
and then blurted out in tones of deepest
linger and indignation: "You are an in
famous man." And with these words he
half rose from his seat, preparatory, ap
parently, to making an attack on the of
fending attorney. He was checked, how
ever, by his watchful attorney.
But his denunciatory remark was not
ignored by Mr. Gallagher, who made a
prompt and almost equally passionate re
ply, as follows:
Inm not so infamous as you are. If I were I
would drown myself. .1 am not. like you, try
ing to shield myself behind the law.
Lloydâ The witness should not be blamed.
I would knock any man down who made any
reference to my wife as was made to that of the
witness.
Gallagherâ He should answer my questions
like a man â an innocent man â and as a
preacher should.
Lloydâ Counsel has no right to insult the
witness under the guise of Keeping the record |
true.
Gallagherâ My client told me these are facts,
and I believe her. No one can run a bluff on
mo. (To witness)â Did defendant tell you that
Miss Overman complained to her that the medi
cine you gave her had made her sick?
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did you use these words to the defend
ant: "i am not such a bud man, and love
Mattie, and trill do right by her, but I don't
wish to liuve her around me any more. In
faoi, she must not come to my office as she did
lo,st week. Mr. Tike may tell" things."
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did defendant call at your office on any Sun
day in December?
Some objection. Same ruling.
Did defendant call at your office on any Sat
urday in December, and did you sty to defenda
nt: "God will keep me now. 1 put myself
wholly in his hands"?
Same objection. Same ruling.
And in the same conversation did you not
say: "I will continue to pay Miss Overman $35
a month, for I have wronged her, but keep this
secret for me"?
Same objection. Same ruling. Excep
tion noted.
I want to ask where it was the defendant
first spoke to you of a threat made by anybody
to expose you?
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did you have a conversation with this de
fendant a few days before the 21st of Novem
ber, when there were no persons present but
yourself and her, about a woman who she told
you had made a threat to expose you?
Same objecVion. Same ruling.
Prior to November 81 did you have any con
versation with defendant at all regarding the
woman who had threatened to expose him,
Mrs. Baddin.
Objection sustained.
At any time in conversation with defendant
about the woman who had threatened to ex
pose you did you say to her, "You might never
see her again, but at any rate keep her away
f rom me. She must not come to my office."
This is in relation to the Baddin woman.
Objection sustained.
At any 01 these interviews or any interviews
you have ever had with Mrs. Davidson in rela
tion to this threat to expose you, was Miss
Overman present?
Objection sustained.
At any of the meetings at which you had a
conversation with Mrs. Davidson, testified to
by you here, was Miss Overman present ?
Witness â She was not present.
Did you ever make any attempt or did you
ever request Mrs. Davidson to procure rooms
ior you over Liebes' store for you and for Miss
Overman?
Objection sustained.
Did you ever ask her to give you a duplicate
key to a room over Liebes' store?
Objection sustained.
Do you know where Miss Overman has been
living for the last week?
Objection sustained.
Did you see Miss Overman on or about the
22d or 23d of December, 1895 ?
Objection sustained.
Do you remember stating anything In your
direct examination to the effect that you had
any conversation at all with Miss Overman
concerning Mrs. Davidson ?
Witnessâ l don't recollect that I made any
statement to Miss Overman about Mrs. David"-
BOn.
Did you have any conversation with Miss
Overman concerning Mrs. Davidson's conduct
and in the presence of Mrs. Davidson?
Objection sustained.
What motive, if any, did you have for hav
ing Mrs. Davidson arrested ?
Lloydâ Wait. The motive has nothing to do
with the offense.
Gallagherâ We claim that the- prosecuting
witness may be expecting to gain the good
opinion of the community by .succeeding in
sending this woman to jail by creating the idea
that her story was not true.
Objection overruled.
Witness âMy motive was to punish tke
woman ior doing a wrong thing in taking my
money. That was my only motive. To rid the
community of a blackmailer.
Have you employed special counsel to prose
cute this case?
Yes.
At this point it was announced that Dr.
Brown's son had returned with the writ
ten statement that Attorney Gallagher had
asked for. After considerable contention
on the part of the opposing attorneys it
was allowed to go in as evidence. Dr.
Brown had shown considerable hesitancy
in acknowledging that this was the paper
that he had read to the newspaper report
ers, but finally did unqualitiedly make the
admission. This led Attorney Gal.agher
to ask him why he had not been frank in
! the matter, and Dr. Brown replied:
Because you're a tricuy man. I realized I
was dealing with a tricky man. That is all.
Gallagherâ It was not because you are a little
tricky yourself?
Objection sustained.
Attorney Gallagher then produced the
statement of Dr. Brown as printed in The
Call, statin? that it was easier for him to
read the print, and began to question the
witness with reference to it. His reason
for this, as explained to the court, was
that he desired to show that the statement
showed that what the witness had said
was done on the 21st or 22d of November
was not done as ho stated. He made
comparisons between the witness' testi
mony on direct examination and that in
the written statement, for the purpose of
showing that the witness had testified
differently from what he had written for
the iniormaiion of the newspapers. These
apparent contradictions were explained by
the prosecution by stating that the \vrit
ten statement was a narrative of all the
circumstances connected with the alleged
blackmailing, written without regard to
specifying time and place, when and where
particular incidents occurred.
Attorney Gallagher finally struck a new
lead. He asked :
Did she iii either of those interviews at the
church refer to the enemies you had made
during the Herron discussion?
I think there was a reference. I am not
absolutely sure about that. There was a refer
ence to my enemies.
You only remember one conversation in
which there was any reference to your enemies?
Objection sustained.
Did she say to you in this conversation at
the church that the young lady herself would
swear that what the lodging-house keeper
stated was true?
She said in the first conversation that the
young lady herself would be one of the three
persons who would sustain the lodging-house
charge. That conversation occurred at S
o'clock in the evening.
That was in the church, was it?
Yes, sir.
Did she in that conversation tell you of the
state of the public mind, etc.? Did she tell
you that the lodging-house keeper demanded
$2000?
No, she did riot.
How many times did Mrs. Davidson tell you
that the lodging-house keeper wanted money?
Objection sustained. Exception taken.
Here Attorney Gallagher went off on
another tack, and in response to his inter
rogatories the witness stated that lie was
born near Battle Creek, Mich., that he was
40 years of age on the 2d of last July, that
he was ordained as a minister nt Grand
Ledge, Mich., in 1575, that his first pas
torate was at Rochester, Mich., that it be
gan in September, IS7G, and continued for
one year, that he next was called to Gales
burg, Mich., where he served for one year,
then he went to Kalamazoo, remaining
five years, thence to Dubuque, lowa, for
the same period, and to Tacoma, Wash.,
five years ago on the 11th of December,
where he remained for a year aad a half.
Gallagherâ Did you get acquainted with
Martha Overman at Tacoma?
Objection on the ground of immaterial
ity, etc., sustained.
Dr. Brown then further testified as
follows:
I left Tacoma the first week in August, 1892.
I have been back several times and returned
there once in the company of Mattie Overman.
Gallagherâ ln what capacity did she go
along? v.:^;;
Objection on the ground of immaterial
ity. Objection sustained.
Did you give the defendant here, before her
conversation about the nameless woman, Mrs.
Badden, any instruction to make any arrange
ment for you on the 21st or 22d of November?
Witnessâ l never made Mrs. Davidson my
agent in any sense w"hatever.
Gallagherâ l move to strike out the answer
of the witness as not being responsive.
So ordered.
On the question being repeated the witness
replied: I did not.
Did. you tell her to see Mrs. Badden and to
keep the thing quiet?
I never did.
When you dictated that receipt you fur
nished all the words used therein, did you not'
I think so. .
Why did you dictate it in the shape it is in?
1 had one main reason in dictating that doc
ument. I wanted to get the name of that
nameless woman.
Did ' you believe that there was such a
wonsÃn?
At the time I did not believe there was.
You wrote that, then, thinking you were fool
ing tier?
1 dictated that in accordance with her state
ment that there was another woman.
Did you insist on putting the woman's name
in the contract for the purpose of inakir.e Mrs
Davidson believe that you believed her storr?
No, I did not. I wanted to get that name for
the police to work upon.
How long after that did the police work
on it?
Two or three weeks. A little more than three
weeks.
Whom did you see when you went to sec the
police?
I first saw Captain Lees.
Was anybody with you?
Deacon Morse.
Did you make any statement to Captain
Lee*?
1 did. It was not in writing tomyknowl
edge.
What did you say to Captain Lees when you
Objection sustained. Exception taken.
How long after you went to Captain Lees
with this statement was the defendant ar
rested, if you remember?
I went to Captain Lees on Monday, and tl.e
defendant was arrested on the following Satur-
Why did you postpone going to the office for
tnr &j \v 0 6 1* > .'
Objection overruled.
I had not yet become absolutely sure In mv
own mind that Mrs. Baddin and her lodcerj
were mythical persons.
Whin has occurred since that time -between
the time you gave this money to MrÂ«. Da>
and the time you saw Captain Leo ? What oe
u"!7-f- tn ri -' ml - v fix this In roar mind ihat Mrs
Baddin was a mythical person?
Objection sustained. Exception taken.
You cay, now, under oath, of your own
knowledge that Mrs. Baddin is a mythical
person ?
Objection overruled.
I don't know that any Mr?. Baddin exists.
Did you not believe the statement o[ Mrs.
Davidson was true, and did you not part with
your I*soo by reason of the Statement made to
you by Mrs. Davidson ?
Objection on the ground that the ques
tion was indefinite and uncertain was sus
tained.
Did you not believe that the statement of
Mrs. Davidson that Mrs. Baddin would expose
you unless you pave her #500, and did you not
give her the $500 for the reason that you be
lieved the statement made by Mrs. Davidson T
Objection on the ground that the truth
or falsity of Mrs. Davidson's story was im
material was sustained.
Did you not believe the statement of Mrs.
Davidson that Mrs. Baddin would expose you
unless she got $500 the next day?
Same objection. Same ruling.
Did you believe fr m Mrs. Davidson's state
ment that Mrs. Baddin would say something
about you that you did not want her to say
whether it was true or false ?
Objection overruled.
Yes, I did believe that this nameless woman
would publish a statement.
Did you not part with your $500 by reason
of the statement made by Mrs. Davidson ?
Yus, sir.
This closed the cross-examination of Dr.
Brown, and Attorney Gallagher's an
nouncement of that faci elicited from Mr.
Lloyd an excited admonition to Dr. Brown,
in a jocular manner, to make haste and
leave the stand, as the defense might
chance its mind.
''Next witness," came from the court,
and this brought Attorney Gallagher to his
feet again to ask the court if he intended
to go on with the case.
The courtâ l want to get through with this
to-nipht.
Gallagherâ l don't think you will get through
with iho defendant if I put her on the stand,
and I shall refuse to allow her to return for
cross-examination.
Louderbnckâ l."t us adjourn to to-night.
Gallagherâ l want to iinish her examination
to-ni^ht.
I,ourierbackâ Let us try.
Lloydâ We will go as far as we can.
Gallagherâ Mrs. Davidson, take the stand.
Before she was sworn. Judge Campbell
asked her: "Madam, do you desire to
testify in your own behalf ?' r
Gallagherâ l must really protest againit
going on with the examination of this witness
hi this time. She informed me it would be im
possible for her to testify fully to-night. She
is an old lady t>o years of age and we protest
against this." She is sick and worn out.
There was some further discussion be
tween the attorney and the court, which
Mr?. Davidson interrupted by saying: "I
am not sick, but very much physically
fatigued, but lam willing to go on. I put
my trust in the good Lord, my God. who I
believe will protect a poor old lady acting
in the cause of justice, and if you want to
go on I will endeavor to speak the truth in
this case."
After Judge Campbell had expressed his
willingness to go on with the case at any
time providing .he could get a suitable
courtroom, as he did not care to sit in his
own uncomfortable quarters, the case
was continued to 1:30 i\ m. Tuesday next.
MRS. GRAY'S BELIEF.
She Thinks That the Disappearance
of Mrs. Tunnell Portends
Evil.
Mrs. Gray, who keeps the lodging-house,
1041 Mission street, where Mrs. Tunnell
roomed, made the following statement to
a Call representative last night:
It is beyond my comprehension whr Mrs.
Tunnell, ii she is the good Christian woman
we all believe her to be, should >v mysteriously
remain in hiding, but I am confident that she
is being influenced by a v, ill stronger than ht-r
own, which prevents hor from coming out and
clearing her>.-!i ol the clond of suspicion in
which she is at present Involved.
It is difficult to believe that a woman who
has been as earnest and faithful in her work
for Christianity as Mrs. Tunnell would lend
her aid to a crime or be guilty of wrongdoing
of any kind.
Tiie" more I think of it the deeper grows the
mystery, and while I would not for a moment
say or hardly aliq-.v myseli to think other than
that Mrs. Tunnell U&< been induced to remain
in biding until this scandal baa quieted down.
I am certain that other people have <j i > m j >-

world for being Implicated In matters ol much
rnificance th â¡ the one in which Mrs.
Tunnell is invoh â 
The last I saw of Mrs. Tunnell was on last
Sunday morning, and upon thinking of the
manner in which she made her departure from
my house, I confess that I am mystified, and
also completely baffled in an endeavor b
my mind regarding her most mysterious dis
appearance.
.Early last Sunday morning, a young man.
whom I should judge to be about 20 years of
age. stylishly dressed arid wearing a startled
expression on his tare, came to the door with
a message addressed to Mrs. Tunnell. At the
time 01 the young man's arrival Mrs. Tunnell
was in bed, but on reading the note she ap
peared to be much disconcerted, and after
hastily dressing she told me that ahe had
been summoned by Dr. Broun, and that she
would be hack later in the evening.
She took none of her clothing with hpr other
than that she had on, and this fact lend! color
to my belief that she intended to return tor
it, but as she has not as yet sent for her
trunk or any other of her effects, herdi-at.
pearance begins to assume a very grave 11 not
startling appearance.
During her stay in the house Mr?. Tunnell
spoke a number of times regarding her friend
snip nnd regard tor Miss overman, and it is
evident that they were very di-ar friends or
else that they had interests in common from
a number of episodes irnich at the time of
their taking place appeared la be common*
place enough, but, on careful study, assume a
murt- important n-.
A week ago last Tuesday M.s-s Overman
called at my house ar.n askeo to see Mrs. Tun
nell, but 1 informed her That the ledv she was
seeking was not in. Snejnade her departure
and, us I informed a Call reporter yesterday,
she returned last Saturday and, meeting my
husband, inquired aa to whether the
procure 11 room in the house, and, being an
swered in the aflirmntive, she selected s
and promised to se:;d her trunk down the next
day at noon and that she would conic Inter in
the day. but she did not do as she promised.
In addition to this fact. Mis. Tunnel! made
her departure, which greatly added to my dis
appointment.
I first met Mrs. TunneH at a lecture given
last May in Golden Rule Hall, under the aus

BROWN'S RESIGNATION.
The Pastor Will Not Occupy the

probably the foundation of the rumor
everywhere heard during the day that
Dr. Brown bad resigned his charge.
Dr. Brown refused to aftirru or deny the

mately renre.
Thc'oilicials of the church will take no
steps toward an investigation of Dr.
Brown's conduct until after the trial of
Mrs. Davidson. Should he resign in the
moan time, a church trial, so iar as the
First Congregational Church is concerned,
will be unnecessary. And in case Dr.
Brown's letters were withheld, it would be
ditncult for him to get another church.
There is a strong element in tne church

Deacon T. 11. Hateli said: "In case

Mr. 1 latch has not seen Dr. Brown since
the unpleasantness in the church began.

Gold Mining and Milling Company, of
which A. J. Bowie of this City is manager
and consulting engineer, has returned to
this City.
Mr. Briggs was for much of the time
over 100 miles from any railroad and 30
miles from the old town of Solomon City.
The only means of transporting supplies
was by pack animals over the narrow trails
into the mountains. The mines of the
companies are in a spur of the Bitter Root*.
The region if rich, and tne indications are
there will be big camps there at some time
in the future.
There is no wilder region in the West
than this part of Idaho. The mountains
are exceedingly rugged and filled with all
kinds of game. Much of the game is big
and calculated to entrance the sportsman.
The country is cut up by fearful gorges, so
that it is no easy matter to get about, es
pecially at this season of the year, when
the snow lies deep, and when it is continu
ing to come down.
Leesburg, the old camp where one of the
properties is situated, is a dead place, but
Mr. Brings has a remarkably interesting
story to tell of it. Said he:
It once had 8000 people. This was when the
Solonion Valley excitement was at its heiirht.
Now it has ten or fifteen white men and about

In a large senae. The miners are mainly old
bachelors, who ccme out from the States from
to forty years ago, have been there
since, and' no longer have any wish to go
back.
A QUinbei of these, beinp far from any bank,
have I. id tht-ir gold an<l rtust in old "tomato
cans, and buried it in various places. In this
way lar^e Boma have been isecreted. The
wood* may be called full of the cans holding

Among these ola miners are Andrew Harra

They both have good placer properties and
they ri t out more money when they work their
claims than they know what to do with, bo
they just bide it away.
A funny thing occurred while I was there
with Hurra. He had a inÂ«n for several nights
sleeping in his cabin, on a bunk near nim.
Harra lir.d a can full of gold secreted under his
bed, and every nlxlu when he came in and jot
iutu li(d he would reach '(own quietly and
heft the can, to see that the gold was all riirht.
He ail ihis right alon? ior several nights
and r.ftur tlie man went away. Finally one day
Harra desired to buy something, and fished
down again for his can. When lie got it out
he w as astonished to find only rocks and other
heavy stuff in it. The visitor ha<l got on to the

of stone and iron in its place and went his
way. Nobody saw him afterward and lie made

bears*evidenee of being on the eve of a mining
revival something like Cripple Creek.
Tnere is an abundance of wild came there.
One can pet mountain sheep, elk, bear and
deer, besides smaller game and fowls. The
mountain sheep are exceedingly hard to kill,
because of their fleetue.-ss and penchant for
staying on the highest nnd ruggedest crags,
but there are plenty of them.
The wild white "ggats which inhabit parts
of the Cascade Mountains may also be seen
in abundance there. Tho Idaho Legislature
has passed a law against killing the elk, but it
doesu't seem to be respected much. The hunt
ers go right on killing them just the same.
I had a number of experiences in going after
wild gume there. It was very exhilarating
sport, and I, escaped without accident.
As for the properties which Mr. Bowie is
managing, and in which a number of San
Francisco people are interested, they are de
veloping handsomely.
Mr. Brings will probably not return to
Idaho. He is a brother of "Kimball Briggs,

MINERS TO RECONSIDER.
Compromise Bill May Be Dropped
by the Executive Com
mittee.
Chairman Merrill of the Montana
State Commission Is Here and
Is to Be Heard.
Already a movement is on foot by. some
of the members of the executive com
mittee of the State Miners' Association to
have reconsidered its action by which the
Ford-Kalston-Singer substitute bill was
agreed to at the December meeting.
re have been three bills before the
Miners' Association for introduction to
Congress on the mineral land question,
i-lnce the efforts began to bring about some
sort of an agreement between it and the
Central Pacific.
As W. H. Mills and the miners failed to
reach a common ground of understanding,
the decision was reached by the latter of
appealing to Congressional action for re
lief, and the first bill proposed was the
Idaho-Montana act as made applicable to
this State. Then Attorney William 11.
Finger of the Southern Pacific drafted a
bill, and it was presented by the miners
for consideration.
Finally a compromise bill â the com
bined product of Mr. Singer, Chairman W.
C. Ralston of the Mineral Lands Commit
tee and Chairman Tirey L. Ford of the
Committee on Leeislation â was adopted as
a substitute for the other two.
John M. Wright, A. H. Ricketts and
Charles G. Yale of the old Mineral Land
Committee have never taken kindly to the
substitute bill and their hostility has been
all the more intensified by the visit to this
City of Chairman Thomas A. Merrill of
the Montana State Mineral Land Commis
sion.
Mr. Merrill drew up the first draft of the
bill whicb ultimately developed into the
Montana and Idaho act, and it is this par
ticular statute for which Messrs. Ricketts,
Wright and Yale have all along been con
tending. Mr. Merrill was a memberof the
Miners' Convention here in 1894, and also
a delegate to the Trans-Mississippi Con
gress of that year. His home ib at Helena
and he has extensive mining interests.
Speaking of the operation of the Montana
and Idaho act he observed yesterday:
Both our miners and the Northern Paciflo
Railroad Company in our State are pleased
with the law's operation. The Northern Pacilic
has between 17,000,000 and 18,000,000 acres
of land in Montana, which is about nine-tenths
of its grant in the two States.
Since May the commissions in the the three
districts constituting our State have examined
| and classified 1,100,000; in tact, they did this
: in live months, and at an expense of a fraction
less than 2 cents per acre. Our appropriation
was only $20,000. There have been no protests
from the miners at all, and all that the railroad
company has protested has been less than 2000
acres. The railroad people like the law so well
, that they assist the Commissioners with sur
veyors in the field.
'ill'- law simply amounts to this: The Gov
ernment says, We have granted so many acresi
I of land to the railroad company, reserving the
I mineral lands; now we propose to go and as -
! certain by means of a commission, d.uasi-ju
dicial In its character, iust what lands we have
granted and what lands we have not. After
the commission has determined their charac
ter, the right of protest by any one to the
Land Oflice is left.
But the substitute bill of the California
] Miners' executive committee is exactly the op-
I posile. Its assumption at the very out
! net is that ail tho lands in the Central
i Pacific grant are non-mineral, and the
burden of proving any of them to
be mineral in character is left on the miner,
which is all very well for the railroad com
pany, but a great hardship for the prospector
and miner. Besides, under your bill, the de
termination of the commission in its classifi
cation of lauds could be made only upou the
application of some one, and even then it
would have only the weight of mere evidence
In the l.'md Otliee, and would be subject to
j the rule of preponderance of testimony.
Mr. Merrill will pay a brief visit to Los
Angeles, and upon his return a meeting of
the executive committee is to be called to
Lear his views formally expressed.
THOSE LOS T SYRIANS
Canon Good, the Famous Mis
sionary, Tells How He Dis
covered Them.
STJBPRISED AND DELIGHTED.
The Details of the Whence and Where
of the Indian Tribes of the
Far West.
Canon Good, the missionary who claims
that northwestern Indians are of Asiatic
origin, gives the following interesting let
ter, stating his views in detail on the sub
ject:
I bave been asked by The Call to add
something more to what it has already
reported in announcing my arrival in this
City as to the foundation of my convic
tions and conclusions that the Indian race,
for whose salvation and general improve
ment I have given the best years of my
ministerial life, as a representative of the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel,
are of Asiatic or more definitely of Taura
nian or Tartaree origin.
I approach the subject with considerable
diflidence in my ability to do full justice
to so difiicult an inquiry.
Far away from books, literary society
and centers of civilization, and dependent
entirely upon his own peculiar modes of
investigation, one is apt to grow self
opinionated and puffed up with his own
supposed findings and knowledge, forget
ting it is but as a drop in the bucket as we
draw water out of the great well of truth,
which, as we all know, lies proverbially low
down, and I trust therefore the numerous
readers of The Call will give me credit for
only wishing to contribute something,
however little, to already acquired facts,
and that what I have to say must be taken
for what it is worth.
Certainly our very learned literati in
Europeâ the giants in comparative phil
ology and anthropology â generalized" too
rapidly on these questions, because they
had not obtained a sufficient auiouut of
data reaching from the east to the ex
treme west to come to safe conclusions
upon such confessedly obscure questions.
Already they have corrected their rapid
assumptions, and if my own researches
while hidden from the world have in auv
way contributed to so desirable a result I
am amply repaid for all the toil and brain
sweat the reduction of one oral tongue of
the natives of this great continent has cost
me.
In respect to the original inhabitants of
this continent from the Arctic Circle to
the Terra del Fuego of South America
and the subsequent colonization by suc
cessive waves of migration sweeping over
it from the east, I do most strongly affirm
that abundant evidence exists of the oc
cupation of this continent by countless
aboriginal races, whose origin is shrouded
in the darkness of primeval ages, and
that just as Europe received wave after
wave'of migratory and predatory bodies of
conquering people, which liowed on ever
I continuously from east to west, bo we
here on this side of the world have had a
repetition of the same overflowing of race
afier race.
Some years after I had become
immersed, I may say, in the meshes of
the Thompson tongue, I had grown deeply
impressed with the multiplicity of faces
that bespoke n foreign origin. I bethought
me that I would open again the tenth and
eleventh chapters of Genesis, which con
tain all the reliable account we possess
concerning the great dispersion of races,
and read it as though I had never seen
it before. The first point of importance
that struck me was that we are told that
the defeated builders of Babel Tower were
mysteriously if not to say miraculously
moved to disperse themselves in divers
directions. They were then scattered over
the face of the earth, according to their
nations and tongues and families, and of
these were the nations divided after the
flood.
These were the representatives of the
historical nations recorded in Holy Writ â
the superior races who were to overcome
not only the earth but the inferior, unhis
torical and indigenous people of a former
creation or origin. Each division that thus
went forth would contain the more highly
civilized and polished, the true nomadics,
and the outer fringe of those who were al
most become as savage as those whom
they were to conquer. They would carry
with them iheir language, customs and
traditions, and at that time they may
have had means of locomotion and trans
portation that were subsequently lost to
view.
In this way we should expect to find on
this continent whither a certain percent
age of the original hosts who spoke at first
but one language before the flood
came and settled down â representatives of
all these grades and classesâ and so we do
find the highly civilized Aztecs, so like
the Egyptians, therefore nomadics and
those ot a decidedly inferior grade. Uur
people were of a nomadic character, and
when I inquired further they had a name
for their nation. They were the Ne-Kla-
Kap-a-Muk nation, and they were divided
up into families or stcts. They spoke the
2se-Kla-K.ap-a-Mufc Cheen language, cog
nate with the languages of two contiguous
tribesâ the Towappa Muk and the Sla-Hea
Muk people.
This seemed to throw a ray of light
certainly upon their origin, and the next
thing was to establish all the connecting
links of the chain winch should bind
them in this far-off land to their as
sumed original home in the center of
Asia.
The points are numerous and deeply in
teresting, which, with your permission, I
will preserve foi a second paper.

OUR UNCHRISTENED OWL
A New Well-Known Bird of the
Night That Has Horns,
but No Name.
Some Pacific Bird Stories That Pro
fessor Loomis Has Told to Ig
norant Ornithologists.
The important discovery has been made
in Washington that the horned owl of
California has no name.
This may be largely due to the retiring
nature of this meditative songster of the
moonlight, which has kept it from intrud
ing itself into the business of ornitholo
gists with double-barreled shotguns, but
the fact remains that the well-known
horned owl of the Sierra forests has just
been discovered. In fact, there is no
horned owl west of the Missouri River that
has a name â that is, a real name besides
the nicknames which vulgar speech has
bestowed.
Ornithologists have always supposed
that California has put up with the same
kind of an ordinary horned owl that has
been given to the rest of America and they
have carelessly called our line bird witn
the peaked tufts behind its ears the Bubo
virginianuÃ tubarcticus. Bui now Califor
nia may boast a horned owl of its own.
More than that, it has been discovered
that there is no such a thing as a Bubo
virginianus subarcticus at all. This is
but another of the mass of things which
constantly show how ignorant ornitholo
gists are when it comes to birds.
It has been known lor a long time that
a white horned owl by the name of Bubo
virginianus arcticus nourishes north of
the Canadian border, and that south of it,
west of the Missouri, other horned owls
live and toot from the plains to the Pacihc
Ocean. Years ago a big bird man named
Hoy shot a horned owl out West, supposed
it to be the regular horned owl of the West,
called it virginianus subarcticus, and ever
since then the specimen, nicely put away in
arsenic in the Smithsonian Institution, has
been the type of authority on Western
horned owls.
It was Ornithologist Leverett M. Loomis
of the Academy of Sciences who discovered
this owlish scientific blunder, while on the
Eastern visit from which he has just re
turned. He had taken two owl skins
along with a lot of other specimens in
tended for comparison and "study in the
great Eastern zoological museums, and on
investigation concerning owls he found
that the Hoy type was a stray Canadian
from the .North for one thing and for
another thing that the California horned
owl has white feet, reddisn dress and
other differences that make it a distinct
type. As it is a discoverer's sole province
to bestow names, he will call the horned
owl of the Rockies and the plains the Bubo
virginianus hoyi, after the man who made
the mistake, but he is still thinking about
what he will call the new owl that he has
given to California.
Of course California is rich in other owls
that the ornithologists have managed to
name correctly. There is the charming
saw-whet, so called because ita song sug
getss saw-sharpening in a sawmill; the
California screech, which belies the rumor
that California birds have no song; the
burrowing owl of the Pacific Coast that
lives with the gophers and chipmunks,
and so on.
Mr. Loomis has also named a new
species of shearwater, an ocean bird, that
he discovered during his months of daily
boating ten miles oft Monterey, and it will
go into the books as the "pufhnus Gil
berti," after Dr. Gilbert of Stanford Uni
versity.
The particular occasion of Mr. Loomis'
trip East was the thirteenth annual con
gress of the American Ornithological
Union at Washington, at which he read -
paper quite paralyzing to the bird sciena
tists there. Loomis has for a great many
years been a special authority on bird mi
gration, and it was the discoveries concern
ing the pelaeic biids of the Pacifac,
made during his relentless boating
trips far oft the shore at Monterey,
that he gave to the science of ornith
ology. The ocean birds of the Pacific
are but very little known, and from three
to ten miles off the Pacific shore anywhere
are millions of ocean birds never seen on
shore. Loomis got out among them daily
for months, gathered many specimens
never reported before in this part of the
world, found species never described any
where and made a special study of migra
tions. He discovered and demonstrated
the fact, new to science, that ocean birds,
in their long migrations between the Arc
tic and the southern regions, are not
guided by instinct, but always keep the
shore line in view, and are guided by it.
Birds that fly high fly farther from shore.
All awing in to follow the bend in the
coast line, and during fogs they fly close to
the surf to be guided by the sound.
During the eighteen months that Pro
fessor Loomis has been here he has in
creased the ornithological collection of the
Academy of Sciences from 2100 to 9000
specimens, and is in a hurry to make it
20,000, though this would be small com
pared with the three or four great collec
tions of the East. The Academy of Sci
ences is doing notable work in the almost
unworked field of the birds of the Pacihc.
MERRY HANDBALL MEN.
First Annual Kauquet of the Occidental
Club in the Court Was a
Success.
The Occidental handball court, on Grove
street, presented a charming appearance
last night. The walls and fronts of the
galleries were draped with banting and the
stars and stripes. Two tables extended
the length of the alley, anil another table
was placed at the top. The occasion was
the Grst annual banquet of the club, and it
was a success in every respect.
Elaborate preparations had been made
by President l). E. Condon and the other
officers of the club, and nothing was want
ing for the enjoyment and comfort of the
guests, who numbered over 100. '
The menu was all that could be desired,
and after the good thingsHhad been done
ample justice to President Condon deliv
ered an address of welcome in which he
took occasion to refer to the progress of
the club since its inception over two years
ago. -V: V;
J. C. Nealon, the popular and veteran
player, one of the coast championship
team, after replying to the toast of the
team in bis usual happy style, performed
the duty of toastmaster.
The other toasts were: "Gaelic Games,"
responded to by Richard C. O'Connor, a
well-known , enthusiast who literally
brought down the house by his peroration
when lie declared, "wherever you find a
first-class athlete you will find an Irish
man"; "Olympic Club," Dr. E. N. Short;
"Occidental Ball Court," Judge M. Cooney,
and "The Ladies," Frank T. Shea.
The toasts w*re interspersed with a vocal
solo by Fred Myrtle; barytone solo by
"W. T. O'Brien; recitation by T, F. Bonnet;
vocal soio by Auditor Broderick; violin
solo, "Irish Melodies," by J. E. O'Meara;
vocal solos, Clarence Howland and George
Broderick. Vita's orchestra played appro
priate airs during the evening.
The officers of the club, to whom the
success of the banquet was due, are:
President, D. E. Condon; vice-president,
Ed Maloney; secretary, C. J. McGlynn;
directorsâ T. F. Bonnet, Dr. Ed E. Hill,
C. A. Sullivan, James J. O'Brien and Ai
Collins.

Of the 4914 sealskins brought into Port
Townsend, Wash., during the season just
closed, 3650 were of female seals, an indi

are being destroyed.

SIGNED THEIR WARRANTS
The Auditor Wins His Contro
versy With the Board of
Supervisors.
Finance Committee Decides Not to Risk
Clogging the Municipal Ma
chinery.
Auditor Broderick sat in an easy chair
in his cozy office yesterday wearing the
peaceful smile of a man who thinks on a j
deed well done.
In the outer office his clerks worked like j
beavers, and the expression on their faces
was so different from the troubled looks j
of the past few days that those who came I
in to transact business felt constrained to â 
ask the reason of tbe evident change.
The cause of the cleared atmosphere j
was that the Finance Committee of the J
Board of Supervisors had decided that j
rather than risk the clogging of the City's
business by holding out the salary de
mands of the employes of the Auditor's
department they would sign the same and
allow the clerks to pursue the even tenor
of their way unhampered by visions of the
wolf at the door.
When the committee met on Friday
evening and Auditor Broderick appeared
to answer the queries by the members re
garding the necessity of the clerks in his
office, and the authority for employing
them, matters looked very much like a
deadjock and a tying up of business that
Ttould seriously impair the efficiency of
the municipal government. Investiga
tions were talked of and the Auditor was
curtly told that his warrants could not be
issued until the matter bad been thor
oughly looked into.
His parting shot as he went through the
doorway apparently had the effect of mak
ing the Supervisors ponder, however.
"Let it go at that,' said the Auditor
"but I must tell you that unless I can be
assured by Monday morning that thoÂ«e
demands will be passed there will be no
clerks in my office on Tuesday. I shall not
ask men to work for nothing."
After he had goni another consultation
took place and the committee decided that
the demands should be passed. It was
also decided that in future years when the
books of the Tax Collector's office are to
be worked up the men who do it will be
paid at the rate of $100 per month.
THE STEAM BEER FIGHT
Many Saloon-Keepers Believe
They Have Been Imposed
Upon.
TOO MANY PRICES FOR THEM.
Certain Brewers Likely to Make the
Break by Recognizing the Work
men's Union.
The article published in yesterday's
Call regarding the war among the brew
ers produced great excitement, not only
among the members of the Brewers' Pro
tective Association, but among hundreds
of saloon-keepers who are handling the
beer of the breweries found guilty of cut
ting the price of the beverage. As stated
in this paper nearly a month ago, charges
were made that the California Brewery on
Seventeenth and Douglass streets, and the
Broadway Brewery on Broadway, had
been cutting the price of beer below the
rate established by the association of $5
per barrel net.
A special committee was appointed by
the association to investigate the charges,
and the members worked for about three
weeks before making their report. Before
the committee was set to work Mr. Fred
ericks of the Jackson Brewery showed that
he was convinced the charges were true by
offering a resolution to cut the price of
beer to $2 from $5, and teach the offenders
a lesson they would not soon forget. The
majority of the body decided that it would
be better to await the findings of the in
vestigating committee.
Their report, which was made on Fri
day, caused a jolly row in the association,
for the committee reported having found
that the accused breweries were guilty as
charged, and they recommended that thr?
cut be met by a bigeer cut. In addition,
the investigators reported that the cut
rate breweries had about three prices for
their steam beer to their customers. To
those whose patronage they were sure of
the price was $5, the standard rate. To
those of whose paironaue they were less
sure they sold beer for $4 a barrel, and in
order to take patronage away from their
rivals in business they offered and sold
beer for $3 50 per barrel.
The first two findings caused lots of
trouble among the brewers at the meeting,
but it was the latter linding that raised a
cloud of dust among the saloon-keeper.-.
Those who are paying $.s and $4 have raised
a howl of inuignation upon learning
through yesterday's Call that their rivals
in the saloon business were getting beer
for as low a price as $3 50. They con
sidered that such a discrimination was
an outrageous imposition upon personal
and business friendship and of a character
that could not be overlooked in fatqre
dealings.
As might be expected, several im
promptu indignation meetings were held
j among the saloon-keepers yesterday, at
I which there was a free comparison of
notes. From what can be learned severaL
I brewers were interviewed as Uo prices, but
the figures given could not be obtained.
Every brewer hesitates about making the
first break, although, there is a general
feeling among them that a general cut will
soon be made in accordance with tne
! recommendation of the association's
j special committee. The fact that the
National, Jackson. Milwaukee and Wash
ington breweries and the San Francisco
Breweries, Limited (five in number),
ruakine a total of nine breweries, all favor
making a big cut makes a general break
almost unavoidable.
It is for this break that the saloon
keepers are waiting in order to determine
what course they will pursue with their
customers. That is, whether they will
make a bid lor patronage also by reducing
the price of beer over the counter to two
glasses for 5 cents or hold to the present
price and take advantage of a cheaper
purchase price. There is considerable sen
timent against the two- for-rive proposition.
One reason is that the lawless class will
imbibe too freely and get many of the
' saloons into disrepute. Should this
; happen there is no doubt in their minds
â  that the Supervisors, License Collector and
j the police would close many of their
places. By holding to the present rate
the saloon-keepers would make a golden
harvest while the beer war would be on.
There is no doubt but that many would
sell at 2>< cents a glass and the other claÂ«s
would make a specialty on putting out
tempting free lunches with their 5 centa a
glass beer.
Among the brewers the feeling of un
certainty prevails. Nearly ail are pre
pared to make a ru9h for business as soon
as the first sign of a general break appears,
j and the action of one brewery would be
; sufficient to cause a stampede.
From what can be learned, the only
thing that held back the members of the
association from making a break at the
meeting on Friday was the form of the
labor union that loomed up in sight just
as the decision was about reached. The
association and its members have spent
and lost many hundred thousand dollars
in fighting the Brewery Workmen's Union
and its allies, the trades unions. To have
an internal tight would be to lay them
selves open to a break in their ranks, by
which the Brewery Workmen's Union
would secure a foothold and compel the
employers to recognize the union as a
body. If this should come to pass, the
lons, bitter, expensive anti-union fight
would come to naught, and the union
would come off victorious.
And this very thing is what is the most
hkely to happen. All of the help in the
Philadelphia Brewery, one of the syndi
cate, are union men, and members of the
union are scattered among nearly all of the
j other breweries.
J Several of the brewers arA in favor of
abandoning the anti-union fight and
I throw their institutions open to the union.
! These contend that the fight i$ too cxpen
j sive in the first place and in the second
place unionism is more of a bugaboo than
I a reality. These further assert that a
I brewer is safer in the lianas of union men
j than he is in the hands of business rival*,
i who, under the cover of a protective asso-
I ciation, practice cutthroat methods lor
the purpose of depriving others of their
patronage.
Jacob Adams, who said that he is one of
the proprietors of the Broadway Brewery,
denies that beer from his brewery has been
I sold for less than the standard price.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. Next week
there will not be a cent in the salary fund
of the city and as all the money that 13
now held'by tl c banks on deposit must be
â withdrawn "anil be put in the city's hired
vault, the employes will no longer be
pble to pet their warrants cashed without
paying discount.
City Auditor Snow said to-day that the
usual discount will henceforth be charged
by the banks for all warrants of city era
ployes. The Luditor said: "During the
last' live years the banks of this City have
cashed without discount warrants calling
for over $1,000,000.
"So far as 1 know no city in the Union
has been so favorably treate \. lam not in
sympathy with any place for the sate keep
ing of the public funds that will withdraw
money from circulation iv our own city.
There have been times and they may recur
when every Qollar is needed for right and
proper business mmodation. The city i
should be a depositor and never hoard
money in vaults.
â¢'I have no patience with the apparent j
desire of some' persona to injure our own '

places for public funds. The city should i
profit by the wisdom an experience of
older cities and amend the charter so as to
permit the deposit of funds with the insti

There will be no money in the Balary
fund for five- months, and the banks will
charge at the rate of 7 per cent per annum
for discounting all warrants in the interval.

cruelly cold and not a ray of sunshine can

It is not known what the report of the

Directors Are Now Considering the
Selection of a Site for the

Oakland Office San Fbabcxsoo Callj
908 Broadway, Jan. 4. |
The first exposition given in this city
has borne good fruit. In a few days the
articles of the Oakland Exposition Insti
tute will be filed with the Secretary of
State.
"We see no reason why Oakland should
not have an institute superior to the Me
chanics' Institute in San Francisco," said
President Keller of the Board of Trade to
day. "The buildine across the bay is an
tiquated. The directors of the new insti
tute have several sites under discussion,
but until the articles are tiled and the in
-titute formally started they do not feel
like acting. Of course we must have a
building of our own. but it will need to be
j very carefully planned so as to make it a
commercial success. "We are confident
' that a large annual exhibit, and possibly a
few minor ones in a spectaJ direction, will
be commendable and safe ventures. The
. will be taken up by any public
is inded citizens, and, of course, the di
rectors will all take a financial interest

The purposes of the institute as out
lined in articles of incorporation are:
To carry on and conduct the business of mr
siituting and giving expositions of arts and
industries of every kind, from time to time
andai such times as the board of directors may
direct; to institute, iau.iir.tiin and conduct
libraries; to lease, buy, erÂ£Ct and construct
halls and buildinzs In which to maintain
libraries and hold &nd conduct expositions oi
arts and industries; to acquire, lease, pur

and conduct of said busfness; and to do and
perform any end all other lawful things "what
soever whicb may be deemed necessary, ex

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
MUHLNER NOT SENTENCED
Judge Frick Objects to the Ver
dict and Grants a New
Trial.
SAYS IT WAS A MURDER.
But the Jury Say It Was Manslaughter
and the Prisoner Is Admitted
to Bail.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
008 Broadway, Jan. 4. f
Louia Muhlner was granted something
to-day by Judge Frick, but whether it waa
a new trial or what may ultimately be de
clared an acquittal by the Supreme Court
remains to be seen.
Louis Muhlner wa? to have been sen
tenced this morning for the manslaughter
of Jennie Lewis, but instead he was ad
mitted to bail in the sum of $15,000. Judge
Frick stated that he was dissatisfied with
the verdict of the jury. Their verdict
should either have been murder or ac
quittal. The evidence did not justify a
verdict of manslaughter. During ihe argu
ments Judge Frick said there was not one
word of testimony to justify the conclu
sion Hint the killing was done without
malice.
When Judge Frick announced his de
cision. District Attorney Church took an
exception and yave notice that an appeal
would bo at once taken to the Supreme
Court. lie says that if the ruling is sus
tained, Muhlner can only be tried a second
time for the charge of manslaughter.
Should the Supreme Court maintain the
opinion that the evidence would not jus
tify a verdict of manslaughter, Muhlner
cannot b:; tried again for murder on tne
plea of twice in jeopardy, and it niay be
found that he is in the peculiar position of
a convicted man against whom no charge
can be made to nold.
Judge Frick concluded that it wa? an
error on the part of the jury to find a- ver
i diet of the lesser degree of homicide where
| the evidence warranted a conviction of the
greater. On this point lie based his de
i cision granting a new trial.
Attorney Nagle, who appeared for
Muhlner. argued that a new trial should
ranted entirely on the proposition that
the evidence was not sufficient to warrant
| a conviction. He claimed that a verdict
of acquittal should have been rendered,
but Judge Frick cast that view aside and
reached the desired end by a very different
process of reasoning.
Phe court stated that the Supreme
Court had never squarely pronounced an
lon on the question of error by a jury
in bringing in a verdict unsatisfactory to
the court, and be desired to have it settled
in the higher tribunal. He said he had
examined all the authorities in California
on the question and had been unable to
find a single instance where the Supreme
I t hail decided the matter. Should
Muhlner be tried for manslaughter and
the jury take the same view as the court
the chance for an acquittal would be very
strong.
One of the jurors who tried the case said
I to-day that tut- evidence was not nearly so
I clear to the twelve men in the box as it
appeared to be to Judge Frick.
â¢ 1 or a long time after we left the court
." said the juror, ">ve were evenly
! divided between acquittal and murder.
, Up to the ballot before the last there were
some votes for acquittal, and in order to
arrive at a verdict we compromised on
manslaughter."
As Muhlner cannot, under the circum
stances, be tried for anything higher than
manslaughter, and as that is a bailable
offense, Judge Frick lixed the bond at
115,000. As Mublner'a folks have a good
Btahding in Oakland it is expected that he
will soon be at liberty.
FOR SCHOOL AND WHARF
Berkeley's Special Elections on
Those Issues to Be Held
February 15.
The Growing Needs of the University
Townâ No License for
John Casey.
BERKELEY, Cm,., Jan. 4.â Berkeley's
special election for voting on the school
and wharf bonding propositions will be
heid on February 13. This date was lixed
last night by ti:e Town Trustees who
passed an ordinance calling the elections
and fixing the precincts and appointing
election officers. The ordinance as passed,
sets forth the facts that the town has a
population of over 10,000; that it is rapidly
growing, and that :i wharf at West Berkeley
and a new high school and grammar
schools in various sections of the town
seem to be jiublic necessities. The board
will hold an adjourned meeting next
Thursday evening, at which the ordinance
will be linally passed upon.
The precincts as fixed for the special
elections are the same as in regular elec
tions, each wardjexfepting Three, con
stituting one precinct, and Ward Three
being divided into 3 A and 38. The poll
ing places will bo. as follows:*
Precinct 1. store in Honer block, Rhat
tnck avenue, between Vine and Cedar
streets.
Precinct 2. on east side of Telegraph
avenue, south of Dwight way.
Precinct 3 A, engine house on Addison
street.
Precinct 3 B, J. J. Mason's office.
Precinct 4, Peralta engine house, Shat
tuck avenue, near Paissell street.
Precinct 5, engine house, south side of
Aleatraz avenue, opposite Ellis street.
Precinct 6, Poseu engine house, Sixth
street and Bancroft way.
Precinct 7, Beacon engine house, east
side of Fifth street, near University
avenue.
Though the two elections are to be held
on the same day they will be separate ami
distinct, so that it may be possible to
defeat or carry one or both independently.
The same onicers and polling places will
serve for both.
Sanitary Movements.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 4.â The forma
tion of the new Adeline sanitary district
on the southern side of Berkeley has just
been completed. The streets to be sewered
are Menlo avenue, Adeline, McKee, Stan
ley, Paradise, Grove, Dover, McCall,
Brown, Shattuck avenue and Mariposa,
Nono and Merced avenues. The work,
when completed, will cost upward of
."fI^.OOO. Connections will be made with
the GoWett Gate sanitary district, the ex
penses of making which are included in
the $13,000 estimate. The success of the
movement to make these new sanitary im
provements is mainly due to the Adeline
Improvement Club, which was formed last
October.
Health Officer's Report.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jau. 4.â Dr. Hubert
N. Kowell, Health Officer of Berkeley,
submitted to the Town Board last evening
a lengthy report reviewing the work of the
Health Oflice during the year of 1895 and
giving statistics of births and aeattis. In
the report it was stated that the enforce
ment of the new sanitary ordinances
passed last Aucust by the Trustees had
resulted in much improvement in the sani
tary condition of many parts of Berkeley.
It was necessary for him to visit a large
number of residences with the view to en
forcing the newly made laws. The inspec
tion of the residences is about completed
with the exception of those in the Sixth
and Seventh wards. In these districts' it
was ditlicult to proceed rapidly by reason
of the lack of water in the West Ena. Al
though West Berkeley is the oldest section
of the town in point of settlement, there
are many streets in which water mains
have never been laid.
Subscriptions Come Slowly.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. The sub
scriptions to the $1000 fund which will be
used for the purpose of providing elec
tric lighting fixtures for the university
grounds according to Regent Reinstein's
plans, are coming in very slowly. The
first $SUO toward the fund was subscribed
two weeks airo yesterday by F. M. Wilson,
and since that date only $130 has been
raiser! in addition. The reason why the
fund has not increased more rapidly is ap
parently due to the fact that no authorized
solicitor, until yesterday, has had the sub
scription list in charge. J. L. Sco'clilerhas
been asked by Regent Reinstein and Trus
tee Richards to make a personal canvass of
the town. Thus far but four of the uni
versity professors have subscribed. The
name of President Kelloeg heads the list
of faculty subscribers with $20. Regent
Reinstein is much surprised that the
movement has not received a more cordial
general reception.
No License for Casey.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 4.â The Board
of Town Trustees have refused to grant
the application of John Casey for a
license to sell liquor. The license com
mittee had no recommendation to make in
their report, but stated that their objec
tion to Casey's proposed saloon was its
location, one-half of his building being
within the mile limit and the other half
without. Had the license been granted it
would have been possible for customers to
purchase their liquor at the bar outside
the limit and then step across the line to
drain their cups.
"Want Better Services.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 4.â The mail
service between East and West Berkeley
is the cause of some dissatisfaction among
the citizens of these respective sections.
Letters mailed at the main office at 1
o'clock in the afternoon for West Berkeley
are sent to San Francisco for assortment,
and from there back to their destination.
This delay in the delivery of the afternoon
mail of this particular part of town is due
I to the fact that there is only one carriers'
i delivery per day between the east and
! west ends. â 
SUIT FOR HEAVY DAMAGES
A Patent Medicine Man Wants
a Large Sum for
Injuries.
What the Alameda Clergymen Will
Preach About To-Day â Acci
dent to a Boy.
ALAMKDA, Cai.., Jan. 4.â D. J. Mc-
Quarrie, a compounder and dispenser of
patent medicines, has sued the Alameda
Electric Railway Company for $25,250
damages for personal injuries. On Octo- I
i ber 28 he was driving on Park street, in
the vicinity of Railroad avenue, when his
j bcrrse, taking fright, became unmanage
able and left the roadway, dashing across
the open space formerly occupied by the
j old depot. The buggy collided with one
I of the iron poles that sustain the electric
trolley wire, which, after the old station
! building was reuuved, stood rather con
spicuously in the open.
MoQuarrie was thrown out and claims
to have been badly injured.
The complainant seems to make a point
through asserting that the municipal
trustees had ordered the pole to be re
moved before the accident occurred.
Themes of Preachers.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 4.â Rev. G. K.
Dodson of the First Unitarian Church will
preach to-day on the subject "How a Lib
-1 eral Faces the World." Henry Victor
Morgan of the Christian Church will
preach in the morning on "Proving God,"
and in the evening on "A Religious View

But One Diseased Cow.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 4.â Veterinary
Inspector Carpenter reported to the Board
of Health on Friday night that he had re
cently inspected all tbe dairies supplying
I milk "to Alameda. Twoof tlie.se he "had
' ordered to correct their sanitary condi
tion. He had found one case of tubercu
losis outside the city limits and had tne
animal killed. He inspected all butcher
and produce shops and found but fifteen
head of game unfit for food. He visited
all the restaurants and found them in
good condition.
I\lrs. McCormick to Remain.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 4. â The an
nouncement by a weekly journal of San
Francisco that Mrs. F. H. McCormick is
about to retire from the choir of the First
Unitarian Church, of which she has been
the mainstay for several years, is denied
by officers of the church, who have had no
such thought, and cannot conceive how
such an announcement could be made.
Mrs. McCormick is in high favor not only
with the congregation, but with the music
loving people generally.
Accidentally Shut.
ALAMKDA, Cal., Jan. 4.â A young son
of School Director Lanktree wa3 firing a
22-caliber pistol yesterday morninc near
his home at I'acific avenue and \Vood
street, when he let the weaoon fall and it
was thus accidentally discharged, the bul
let entering the fleshy part of his left arm.
The wound is not dangerous.
English Reporters.
English reporters are apt to rely too
much on shorthand-writing. They are
not as sprightly as American reporters.
But the great use to which English report
ers put shorthand, and thp wholesome
dread they have of using any but a man's
actual words in reporting his speeches,
tend to give English reporting the
reputation for accuracy which it now
generally enjoys. Accuracy and fair
ness are the first requisites with
an English reporter doing political
work. Consequently, when English people
read a report of a speech in Parliament, an
address of a member to nis constituents,
or a discussion in the City Council, they
know and feel that they are reading what
the speaker actually said, and not what
the reporter thinks he said, or imagines he
should have said. They get the speech
standing quite apart from any opinions
about or comments upon it, and with this
before them tiiey are aole to form their
own judgments of the questions under dis
cussion and of the attitude of the speaker
toward it. Speeches so reported have an
undoubted educational value, and a good
and far-reaching effect on municipal and
national political life.âAtlantic Monthly.
WANT ISLAIS CREEK OPENED TO THE SEA
Congress Has Been Peti
tioned by Property-
Holders.
SEVERAL OBSTRUCTIONS.
Peter Seculovich Claims That It
Is Still a Navigable
Stream.
HOW THE RAILROAD GOT HOLD.
A Stream Two Hundred Feet Wide
Was Entirely Cut Off From the
Commercial World.
While the Southern Pacific Company
has been rounding ud ail the pood things
in California, it has not failed to place
every possible obstruction in the way of
those who are contented with a more
modest existence.
A great many people have been smitten
by the methods of this combination, hail
ing from Kentucky, and a very consid
erable number of them suffer in silence,
but others do not propose to be cut off
entirely, nor will they submit to such
treatment without revolting.
There is one organization, known as the
Is'.ais Creek Property-owners' Association,
of which considerable has appeared in this
paper of late, that is moving on the rail
road batteries with the intention of storm
ing the work 3 and getting something like
justice.
Peter T. Seculovich is president of the
association, and acting in that capacity,
discusses the shutting off of Islais Creek
from the sea, in ail its ins and outs.
"We claim," said the piesident, "that
we have certain rights as property-holders
that should be protected by the United
States, inasmuch as the courts of Califor
nia have decided against us. We have
placed the history of the Islais Creek mat
ter before our Senators and Representa
tives in Washington and expect something
will be done soon that will re-establish our
right and title to be in direct communica
tion witii the sea, a right that was removed
when the Southern Pacific Company built
a stationary bridge across Islais Creek via
Kentucky street.
"We are all owners of land fronting on
and adjacent to Islais Creek, an arm of the
sea into which tide ebbs and flows, having
eight feet of water at ordinary high tide.
When in early days we purchased our land
we were enjoying free commerce and navi
gation. These conditions were kept up
until L 866, when the State Legislature ex
ceeded its trust and let the Po
trero and Bay View Railroad Company,
a feeler of the octopus, obstruct the creek
by placing across Kentucky street a sta
tionary wooden bridge and afterward by
an earthen embankment from one side of
the mainland at Potrero Nuevo over and
across a tidal bay on the line of Kentucky
Btreet eighty feet wide. This embank
ment, which ran clear across the creek to
the mainland, had an aperture in it for
the water to pass in and out as the ebb
and flow requires. This embankment has
stopped all commerce and navigation and
rendered it valueless to us property-own
ers, thus causing us great loss. Before
this obstruction was placed there Sacra
mento River steamers used to come up
and dock far above the bridge, and we
were permitted to do business direct from
our own property. To-day, however, these
steamers are bamd from entering the
creek above the Kentucky-street bridge.
"There is another bridge above the Ken
tucky-street obstruction, and yet one more
at Fifteenth avenue, which was con
structed against our protest. This latter
one consists of a solid embankment with a
Qowgate in it, but it is now out of place.
This creek before these three obstructions
were placed there was a navigable stream
and an arm of the sea, l? 00 feet wide at its
mouth and seventy feet at its upper end.
It is three miles long and ships of a capa
city of about forty tons were able to pass
easily up and down said creek.
"The Kentucky-street bridge was .first
started in the night and piles were driven
to mark its course. Why the local author
ities did not get out an injunction I do not
know. They simply permitted the work
to go on. It was the duty of the United
States District Attorney to take some
steps, but he paid no attention to the mat
ter. Isiais Creek was declared a navigable
arm of the sea by an act of Congress as
early as I"o0, ana part of section 3 of the
act admitting California into the Union
conditionally reads: 'And be it further en
acted, that all the navigable waters within
the said State shall be common highways
and forever free, as well to the inhabitants
of said State, as to the citizens of the
United States, without tax, impost or duty
therefor. 1 In the Statutes of California.
1868, page 350, it reads in section 2, after
section 1 declares the stream open: 'It
shall not be lawful for any person or per
sons to build any dam or bridge across
said creek or channel, or any wiiurf that
will interfere with navigation of the
same.'
"That was and is to-day the law re
garding obstructions, yet in section 3
of the same act it exempts the company to
build a draw in a bridge, but the company,
without authority built a stationary bridge
and afterward an embankment and then a
wagon road.
"One very clever way of getting around
the law was to incorporate in the act these
words: 'Said railroad company shall be
required to construct a draw in said bridge
whenever parties interested shall pay the
expenses of constructing said draw and
provide for maintaining the same.' This
was an unjust act that could not be ful
filled by any other parties but the com
pany. Thirty-five years after the stream
had been declared navigable and seventeen
years after the State of California bad
declared it navigable the California Leg
islature exceeded its trust and dropped it
from the Political Code as a navigable
stream. We carried the matter into the
courts and on the 30th of January, 1832, in
the Superior Court, Department 3. a de
cree was rendered in our favor as against
the Bay View Railroad Company, that the
bridge was a nuisance and the C efendants
were ordered to remove without delay the
bridge, or that part of it which obstructed
Islais Creek, and to immediately abate the
nuisance, but the case was appealed to the
State Supreme Court and reversed on the
ground that the company had the right to
keep the nuisance as a bridge until Con
gress otherwise enacts.
"That is the way the Supreme Court dis
posed of the question, and we are now try
ing to get Congress to correct the error. I
once wrote to Robert Lincoln, who was
Secretary of War, but he put the matter
in the hands of Colonel Mendell and we
got nothing from that source. On one oc
casion the Harbor Commissioners passed
a resolution ordering the railroad to re
move the bridge or place a draw in, with
the result that tbe man who wrote the
order was suddenly dismissed a short
time afterward.
"In 1890 the Harbor Commissioners
offered to construct a drawbridge if the
City would pay for its maintenance after it
was completed. This offer was rejected,
and nothing ever came of it.
"We have petitioned Congress to declare
Islais Creek open for commerce and navi
gation from its mouth in the Day of San
Francisco to its upper end as recorded on
gift map 4, December 31,18 til; in map
book 2 in the Recorder's office, and by the
map of the State Board of Harbor Com
missioners.
"It will require, to complete these re
movals of obstructions, something like
$10,000, which we have asked Congress to
appropriate. The petition is signed by my
self as president of the Islais Creek Prop
erty-owners' Association; Henry Wacken
reuder, execntor of Vistas W. Wacken
reuder's estate: the Fairmount Mission
Improvement Club's president and secre

"If the otlicials of Caliiornia who draw
magnificent salaries from the State can
nor take care of the taxpayers and prop
erty-owners we will see whether or not
the" United States will. Ido not propose
to disarm myself entirely by exposing our
lines of campaign, but there is a great deal
more to come of this matter and we will
fight it out until something in the shape of
justice is delivered the property-owners,
who were here before the Southern Pacific
of Kentucky decided to remove us from
the sea."
ONE SAUSALITO SPOOK
The Apparition Which Dis
turbed the Rest of a
Prominent Citizen.
How W. H. Harrison Discovered
the Danger of Meddling With Old
Cemetery Pickets.
W. H. Harrison of Sausalito, the coal
merchant and journalist, took a drive
over the hills north of town on New Year's
day. Passing the old cemetery Mr. Har
rison remembered that he had lost a picket
from his front fence line, and that one of
those aged pickets at the cemetery
would about tit, and with a coat of paint
would look just as good as new. He is a
gentleman of prompt action, so to trans
fer the picket to his buggy was the work of
a moment. And then he drove home sat
isfied that the first day of the new year
had not passed without prolit.
Mr. Harrison is a light sleeper, and at 12
o'clock was awakened by the striking of
the midnight hour from the clock on his
mantelpiece. He reached forth to draw
the coverlet over his shoulders and com
pose himself again to slumber when the
consciousness of a strange presence in the
room startled him. He opened his eyes
and was considerably alarmed to see the
cemetery picket standing erect at the post
of his bed.
"Why, I'm a Coos Bay lv mperifiti
not the cemetery picket," exclaimed Mr.
Harrison, rubbing his eyes.
'You bet your sweet life it is," rejoined
the picket, which to Mr. Harrison's horror
had assumed human proportions, and was
grinning at him in a most ghastly fashion.
"Say, you're not alive," gasped the Coal
King, sitting up in his bed and shivering
with terror.
"Justus much as you are at the present
moment, Billy," grimly replied the picket.
"But 3'ou're old_ lumber, now, you know
you are," argued .Mr. Harrison, persua
sively.
Here the picket crew profane and swore
so terribiy tuat the expert in anthracite
put his lingers in his ears.
"Who are you, anyhow, and what are
you doing here in the dead of night?"
"bluilingly demanded Mr. Harrison.
".May tSatan roast you in your own sift
ings," shrieked the picket. '"Who brought
me here, any how, and behind the slowest
old horse, too, that ever wore shoes? Who
ami, eh? Why, I was the boatswain of
the Russian brig Petrovski, but now I am
simply a picket, see?"
"I knew there were some Russian sailors
burled on that hillside, but, I assure you,
I had no intention of disturbing you,"
said Mr. Harrison, soothingly.
"Oh, never mind the disturbing," re
torted the picket; "that hillside is a pretty
windy place, and I will be much more
comfortable in your front yard."
"I'll be hanged if you will," muttered
Mr. Harrison.
"I was always fond of society," pursued
the picket, musingly. "I like flowers and
chickens. It was the dream of my life to
own a chicken-ranch when I was at sea.
And say, don't drive me in too hard, Billy,
so I can't get up every night and have. a
social chat with you. I can spin you lots
of good yarns, I can."
The cold perspiration started on Mr.
Harrison's lofty forehead at the idea of a
seance every night with a ghostly boat
swain embodied in a redwood picket. But
he concluded best to conciliate his unwel
come visitor.
"Well, we'll see about it," he said, pleas
antly. "Nothing would pleaso nic better,
I assure you. But don't you think you'd
better turn in now. I've got to be at busi
ness early in the morning, you know."
The picket scowled viciously at the sug
gestion.
"I am just beginning to enjoy myself,
Billy," it said, severely. "Keep a civil
tongue in your head, or by the main brace
pennant I'll hop into that bed and lam the
dickens out ol you."
Here to Mr. Harrison's inexpressible re
lief a tap came to the door and a voice out
side said: "Why, William, who are you
talking to?"
Before he could reply the picket, with a
parting glance of the most threatening im
port, launched itself out of window. Mr.
Harrison sprang from his couch and
steadied hia nerves. That morning, ere
the wintry sun had gilded the lofty hills,
he drove rapidly up the road, and the
picket and a heavy maul lay side by side
in the bottom of ins buggy. It is now
sunk so deeo in the eartli m its old pJace
at the cemetery that nothing less powerful
than a derrick or shears will dislodge it.

FATHER YORKE REPLIES TO DR. BOVARD
Position of the Catholic
Church in America
Defended,
THE OLD PENAL LAWS.
Persecution of Catholics in Eng
land During Elizabeth's
Time.
OBSERVE ALL THE CIVIL LAWS.
First Allegiance of the People Is to
the State â Society Founded
by God.
The Rev. Father York? submits another
letter in answer to the Rev. Dr. Bovard. It
is as follow?:
January 4. L 896.
To the Editor of the Fan Francisco Callâ Dear
Bnt: li;i\ : cleared away the theological
preliminari< I come ow to the reasons nr?nl
by Mr. Bovard to justify suspicion ol the
Catholic chnrch in America. Lot me say that
these reasoni are not new. They have been
put forward tim< out of mind by Intolerant
clergymen and crafty politicians as sufficient
excuse for the ' most violent perseen
tlon of Catholics. They were promul
gated by the ministers of Elizabeth
when tney were hanging, drawing and
quartering men who preferred death
t.> apostacy. They were published by the
authors of the penal laws when Catholics were
despoiled of all civil and political rights; when
their children were denied education; when
their young men were denied a profes
sion; when the faith wife was tempted
to cloak her sin under the mantle ol Protestant
laws and the undutifui son could claim his
father's estate under the sanction of Protestant
legislation; when Catholic I roperty was con
fiscated; when Catholic worship was inter
dicted; when the same price was put on the
head of a friar aa on the head of a wolf; when
the Bishops 01 the church were tracked by
bloodhounds through the marshes, through
the mountains, into the caves and the dens of
the earthâ they of whom the world was not
worthy.
They were republished by that benevolent
gentleman, John Wesley, when the saner tera
per of â tatesmen would lift the yoke and when
his bloodshot vision discerned dangei "from
the amazing growth of Popery," as evidenced
in the erection of Popish chapels, the opening
of Popish schools and the public advertisement
of Popish books, when lie gave testimony to the
strength of his convictions by instigating the
Gordon riots, tamiliar to readers of ' Bar
naby Rudge," which gutted these Popish chap
els, which looted these Popish schools, which
burned these Popish books, and by leaving on
record his broad and charitable sentiments for
all future generations: "No Government, not
Koman Catholic, ought to tolerate men oi the
Roman Catholic persuasion."
In country the same reasons were urged
when the Knownothing excitement brought
the strong men of Boston in the midde of the
night to burn down the Urhuline convent and
filled the streets of Philadelphia and Louis
ville with howling mobs shootingdown Roman
catholics to the accompaniment of blazing
churches and cheers for the Bible and re
ligious freedom. The same arguments are
brought forth now by the modern knownoth
ings, the A. P. A., to arouse a similar frenzy
and to inspire another crusade asainst citizens
of this republic who have witnessed to their
loyalty in the blood of their bravest and their
best.
Mr. i:<iit< r, these arguments of Mr. Bo
vard are not new. They have a long and in
glorious history. It is piainful at this stage of
rld's progress to be compelled 10 devote
serious attention to their refutation. But evi
dently they have not yet lost their noxious vi
tality. Like the germs of the cholera, they
*leep for a time in the -water, or in the soil,
I'iit some accidental disturbance, some evil
temper in the air, pives them uew life and
:hem forth to go the round of the world
Lagne mankind.
The first argument as 6et forth by Mr. Bo
vani toucaes the allegiance of Catholics.
Protestantism tÂ»aches that governments are
free in the exercise of their functions. Rulers
may be just ns close to the throne and know as
much of the will of God as the Pope. Protestants
woold I st as soon see the President praying for
tne safety of the Nation a^ to know that a prayer
hÂ»d been made in the Vatica.i for the same pur
pose. The sources of righteousness and truth are
â¢>a conscientious clean-hear;ed
bailiff a.< tbey are to an ordained priest or minister.
lea of any power being between the ruler and
his God
i he Catholic doctrine, so tar as it be under
stood, teaches that in matters of morals ai
.tie church is above the state. As there can
be no government wit hou morals no morals with
out religion, it pozzies plain-thinking people to
know the boundaries of papal supremacy. The
ProLestant view of a government leaves it not only
free but supreme. -Every soul is subject to the
hleher power." Governments founded on justice
and carried on In righteousness are as direct from
<;od as the church. If Catholics will say as much
the contention ceases and all suspicion dies out.
It Is the claim, or the quasi claim, of the Koman
church that there is a hignly attenuated but n-al
supremacy over the nations of tbe earth, with
headquarters at Rome, that gives rise to suspicion
against that church.
In the course of this controversy, Mr. Editor,
I have at various times asserted "the complete
independence of the civil government; but
either Mr. Bovard has not read my letters or he
has not understood them if he did read them.
I have eaid the very thing which he declares
will end the contention and disarm suspicion,
yet the contention has not ceased and sus
picion still prowls about with erected ears.
There are none so blind as they who will not
see â none so deaf as they who'will not hear.
I am compelled, therefore, in answer to Mr.
Bovard, to set before your readers what the
Catholic church teaches: about civil society
and about our duties to temporal rulers.
I. CIVIL ALLEOIAN' h.
1. Civil society is founded by God. It springs
from human nature, of which Uod is the
author. In its <>\v:i sphere it has received
Kupreme authority, and to that authority men
should bow according to the saying of the
apostle: "Let eveiy soul be subject to the
higher powers, for there is no power but from
<tO'l, and those that are ordained of God.
Therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth
the ordinance of God, and they that resist pur
chase to themselves damnation."
2. God docs not determine the manner in
which civil society may organize this power.
He has eiven no special lorm of civil govern
ment. It belongs to the people to determine
thens t ovcrnmeut which will bt-t
secure to them tneir rights and happiness"
This is the teaching of the Declaration of In
dependence:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal : that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rights: that
umiiii? them are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness. Tbat to .secure these rights govern
ments are instituted among men. deriving their
jus; powers from the consent ol the governed; that
whem r.ny form of povernment b<-coines <!e
--structive of ihfSH ends It is the right of tlie people
to a't'-r or abolish it. fend to institute a new gov
ernment, laying its foundation on euch principles,
and organizing its powers In such form as 10 them
BhÂ»ll seem most .likely to effect their safety and
happiness.
Long before America was discovered or
Protestantism invented these same political
principles wore laid down in almost identical
words by the greatest of the schoolmen
Thomat Aquinas: . â¢
"You will ask me in the second place whether
tin- prince receives this civil lesislative power im
mediately from <;oi. I reply, It Is universally ad
mitted that princes receive this powi r from God.
bat at the same Uxne it is maintained with more
truth that they do not receive it directly, but
through the medium of the people's consent- for
nil rn*"n are naturally equal, and there is no natu
ral distinction of superiority or inferiority. Hince
nature has not Riven any individual power over
another, God has conferred this power on tbecoru
munity, which, as it may think it more proper tobe
ruled hv one or hy many appointed persons,
transfers It tv one or t> many, that by them it may
t>e ruled." (St- Thomas. T'l. 1, 2, ques. 90, art. 3
and 2, Compendium of Salamanca.) "The king
dom is not made for the kijiir, but the king for the
kingdom, for God has constituted kings to rule and
govern and to secure to everyone the possession of
fcis rights. Such is the aim of their institution
but if kings, turning things to their own pront,
should act otherwise, they are no longer kings, but
tyrants." (Of Civil Governments, chap. 11.) â¢
"They are praised wi.o deliver the people from
tyrannical power, bat this cannot easily be aone
without some sedition among the people where one
part of the people tries to retain the tyrant an I the
other to eject him; therefore sedition maybe made
without sin. This is not to excite sedition, but to
cure it." (St. Th. 2, 2, ques. 4^, art. 2to 3.)
3. Once, however, the civil society is organ
ized and accepted by the people all are bound
to obey it. This obedience is a matter of con
science, and no one can refuse it without sin.
In temporal affairs, that is to say, in all these
matters which affect the citizen as a citizen,
nothing can come between the State and God.
li 1 am aiiked what are the matters, which
affect the citizen as a citizen, I can but reply
everything contained in the constitutions and
laws'of this country. There is no duty laid on
a Catholic in America which he cannot
conscientiously fulfill. There is no privilege ac
corded lo the citizen which he is bound by his
religion to refuse to others. Every Catholic
citizen owes full and undivided allegiance to
the flag. No human being can absolve himself
from that allegianceâ no Pope or priest can in
this regard come between the Government of
these United states and God. In v word, to
quote Cardinal Manning, "The civil allegiance
; holies is as undivided as that of all
Christians and of all nun who recognize a
divine or natural moral law."
When Mr. Bovard states "As there can be no
government without morals, no morals with
out religion, it puzzles plain-thinking people
to know the boundaries of papal supremacy,"
he states a problem which Protestants have to
face just as well as Catholics.
All Christians acknowledge the existence of
a moral law. This moral law is an eternal and
unchangeable standard of right or wrong. It
i< the rule of our conduct whether we live un
der a government or no. It does not derive
its force from human legislation or popular
consent. Stealing would be stealing if there
were never a king, and murder would be mur
der wor- there never a government. More
over, human law can never prevail against
this moral law; murder is always criminal,
stealuig always forbidden, adultery always
unlawful. Ido not think that Mr. Bovard, or
any t heist, will deny this proposition.
2. Hie medium by which this moral law is
made known to us is the Intellect. Human
reason is the only natural way we have of
knowing and it is through human reason, we
become cognizant of the naturaflaw. This is
a truism.
3. Human reason, how;ever, is not a perfect
medium. Just as light is refracted when pass
ing through water, so the moral law Is re
fracted when passing through the mind of
man. In some minds this refraction is greater,
;:i gome it is less. But no matter how much
the ray may be bent, it is still the ray, so no
iiiatur how much the moral law may be dis
torted when i>assing through a particular
mind, it is still for that person the moral law.
4. 1 he morHl law as apprehended by a man's
the voice of
aches our ears. Conscience is the
sum <'i our duties, our obligations as we under
stand them. c, in I word, is our
judgment saying to us this action is cor
ned by the law and therefore it must be
mcd or that action Is forbidden by the
law and therefore must be omitted.
6. Hence conscience must be always obeyed.
As long as a man is convinced that a certain
line of duty must be followed he sins if he does
not carry it out. It makes no difference
whether he is right or wrong, he can never act
atrainst his conscience. Others may have the
right oi hindering him from doing what bis
conscience orders, but he can never have the
right oi doing what he conceives i<> (â¢>â¢ wrong
or of omitting what he believes be is bound to
perform. The reason is simple. Conscience is
the moral law to that man, and the moral law
is supreme.
G. 1 rom this it follows that a man's obedience
to the civil law is limited by his conscience.
This limitation holds for the ProtestÃnt as well
as for tne Catholic. If the civil law were to
order ail Method it at mass, Dr. Bo
vard would be the first to break it. If the
â t California should enact the lawagatnst
whose repeal John Wesley foughtâ that every
(. atholic should, under pain of tine, attend the
Anglican serviceâ no Catholic could obey it.
During the anti-slavery agitation many Prot
estant preachers and members of the. Protest
ant churches appealed to this principle under
the name of the "higher law," and yet their
good citizenship is not questioned by Dr. Bo
vard.
7. Hence I may retort the argument on Dr.
Bovard, the Protestant. "Conscience is
supreme in matters 01 morals, out as there can
be no government without morals, no morals
without religion, it puzzles y>lain-thinking
people to know the boundaries of the su
premacy of the Protestant conscience."
mâ FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE.
1. This argument whicn I have just retorted
on Dr. Bovard whs used by im- pagans ag
the Jews and by tbe Jews and pagans a)
the Christians. When the apostles conceived it
to be the-.r duty to preach Christ the â 'â â 
authorities forbade thorn. Then they ap
pealed at once to the supremacy of conscience.
"We must obey God rather than man."
â¢2. When Christianity began to spread through j
the Roman empire it was not attacked 1 â¢
it was a religion. The persecutors of the early I
church from Nero to Diocliiian proclaimed, !
like the preachers of the A. P. A, that they
made no war on any mans religion. They
opposed only disloyai'ty. The worship of the
Emperor's divinity was the great test of alle
giance, and any one who refused that test
should be punished for treason. The Chris- ,
tians protested their loyalty, but it was all in â 
vain. Unless they proved that loyalty In the
precise way the Kmperor wished they were
food for the lions. Now the Christian con
science revolted from the test, nn>i accordingly
old men and tender virgins, youths, soldiers, ;
children went with smiling faces to the steke,
to the block or to the bloody sand of the
arenaâ all giving the tame reason, We must
obey God rather than man.
3. When the insane hatred of the Pope took "â 
possession of the English Government Catho
lics were persecuted â ostensibly not because of .
their religion, but lor treason." Cecil and the j
rest of them assured Europe that they did not
persecute for conscience sake. They only
flayed, burned, boiled, hanged, disemboweled
and quartered those who were traitors to the
Queen. They made a test of loyalty. That test
was to disown the temporal and spiritual j
power of the Pope. The Catholics, were willing
enough to disown the temporal power, but
their conscience forbade them to disown the :
spiritual power, and hence it was that for eon- !
science sake they suffered as the early Chris- ;
tians suffered, because we must obey God
rather than man.
4. All this time there were men who thought
that it was a wrong thing to make a matter" of
conscience a test of loyalty. They reasoned
that men who were so steadfast in standing for
what they conceived to be tlie right would be
the Dest and truest citizens. Hence the thought
arose that it would be for the peace of the
commonwealth if such tests of loyalty were
withdrawn and only those enforced which
could in no way interfere with conscientious
conviction. On this continent it feU to Catho
lics to put this principle for the first time into
operation. Lord Baltimore had obtained a
grant of land in America, unincunibered with
any conditions. He founded the colony of
Maryland, and the laws of that colony
pro video.:
Whereas, The foreln? of the conscience in
matters of religion hath frequently fallen out
to be of dangerous consequence in the common
wealth Where it has been practiced, and for the
more quiet and peaceable government of the
Province, and the better to preserve mutual love
and amity among the inhabitants, no person
within the Province professing to believe In
Jesus Christ shall be anyways troubled, molested
or discountenanced for histir her religion, or in the
free exercise thereof.
5. This glorious example was followed by our
Federal Government, and then by the States.
Now the constitution forbids any religious test
as a qualification for ollice, or, in other words,
forbids the Government to measure the loyalty
of the subject by any action or word w"hich
may be opposed to conscience.
6. However, this liberty of conscience is not
absolute. There are acts of licentiousness,
acts prejudicial to the peace and dignity of the
State which cannot be committed under the
cover of liberty of conscience. Though before
God the man who does these acts is not guilty
of sin, still lor its own preservation the State
may be compelled to restrain him. Thus
polygamy has been forbidden, though intro
duced under a religious sanction, and certain
free love communities established by so-callea
Messiahs have been incontinently broken up.
Now comes the question do the powers claimed
by the Pope interfere with the rights and dig
nity of the State or the natural allegiance of
the subject? This question I am compelled to
defer to another letter. Yours truly,
PETEB C. Yorke.

G. H. HUBBELL AND THE JESUITS.
The Editor of the American Patriot Writes
of Oaths.
G. H. Hubbell of the American Patriot
submits the folowing letter:
Office American Patriot, 810 Market.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir: Once I saw a good riderof the horse place
a saddle upon a wild California cayuse and
jump astride of him. When this cayuse saw
what wns on him he just bucked and bucked,
but at last he tamed. Like unto this cayuse is
Peter C. Yorke, chancellor archdiocese, San
Francisco. He has been a-bucking, attempting
to throw off American suspicion in his effort
to defend the assassins of human liberty, the
men whom all civilized governments but ours
have run out; the men whom this Government,
in self-defense, will have to run oatâ the
Jesuits.
A long time ago in France a civil suit was
brought for moneys lost, against the Jesuits'
Mercantile Mission in Martinico. The Jesuits
were forced to bring their constitution into
court. This constitution was so bad that all
France became greatly excited. The Parlia
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
ment issued a decree abolishing these fellows
from the Nation. That great Nation assigned
these reasons:
The consequences of thPir doctrines destroy the
laws of nature: they break all the bonds of civil so
ciety by aushoriziuir tl.ei't. lyinjt, perjury, tne ut
most licentiousness, murder and all manner of
sins.
These doctrines, moreover, root out all senti
ments of humanity: they overthrow all Govern
ments, excite rebellion and uproot the foundation
and practice of rellclo v
And further, they substitute all sorts of supersti
tion, irreligioii, blasphemy aud idolatry.
That un-American oath binding the man to
a foreign power, that Jesuit oath, born of hell,
which we lately produced before your readers
and which is substantially the same as the
Bishop oath, was also one of the reasons for
the banishment of the Jesuits.
And yet, Bishop Purcell in the great debate
with Alexander Campbell, says on page 318 of
that debate, which I have bei'one me, that :
All the kings and States of Europe, Protestant
and Catholic, know that the Bishops take that,
oath, and yet, In none of them is a Bishop looked
upon with distrust. in Prussia, Sweden, .Denmark
and England, tbe Governments never molest a
Bishop about an oath which Is known to contain
nothing at which the captious statesman could
justly take exception. Is not this sufficient proof
that there is in that oath nothinn of what my
friend attributes to it? I assure him Catholic Bish
ops are not. the enemies that this Kcpublic needs to
(ear. , ; > v {. â¢ - -
Why can't Peter C. Yorke from County Gal
way, Ireland, be as frank? He is a coward.
Hi- knows that Romanism teaches the essence
of these oaths. Here is what his masters say:
Barrouiusâ God ;the Pope) has made the po
litical Government subject to the spiritual.
Bellarniine says: "By reason of the spiritual
power the Pope, at least indirectly, has a su
preme power even in temporal matters."
Here is a portion of a bull bySixtus V against
Henry, Kin^ of Navarre, and the Prince of
Conde: "The authority given to St. Peter and
his successors, by the immense power of the
Eternal Kins;, excels all the powers uf earth by
Kings and Princes. It passes uncontrollable
sentence upon all, and it it finds any of them
resisting God's ordinance it takes a more se
vere vengeance of them, and, casting down
the most powerful of them from their thrones,
tumbles them down into the lowest parts of
the earth as the ministers of the proud Lucifer.'
And yet a Jesuit will make aa affidavit in the
(ace of this. But then this is Jesuitism. And
the church 1b always the same. It never
changes.
Mr. Editor, I was born and bred an American
citizen. I love the name, 1 admire our Ameri
can institutions and wisli to make them bet
ter. I played as a barefooted boy upon the
grass of California and Oregon when Peter C.
Yorke was being horn and bred a foreigner and
learning his billingsgate in the bogsof Ireland.
He uas come here arid Is doing what he can to
papalise and foreignize this country. The dif
ference between he and his kind, and others,
born in a foreign land, is that others become
the best of our American citizens, while they
with citizenship papers in their pockets are
foreigners still,
I earnestly think from reading its own liter
ature that the Koman Catholic political church
was born ana bred of hell, and that the Pope,
bishops and priests are the agents of hell. In
such belief 1 here respectfully submit some
more of the Jesuits' philosophical 6in, etc.,
from their own books:

HOWARD CHURCH EDIFICE
Presbyterians to Have a Place
of Worship at the
Panhandle.
ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE.
Church Organized by Rev. H. S. Willey
and Named in Honor of
W. D. M. Howard.
The members of Howard Presbyterian
Church expect to worship in their new
edifice at the corner of Oalc and Baker
streets in the early spring. The plans of
Percy & Hamilton have been selected, and
the work, begun a few weeks ago, will be
vigorously pushed.
The plan adopted is for a building in !
the Romanesque style of architecture, 100
feet frontage by 100 feet deep, to be of
liedding yellow-brown sandstone, with
brick backing, and slate roof with terracotta

coping. The design is unique in that it is
really a double building, consisting of
main auditorium and chapel under
separate roofs, but joined below the eaves
so as to be thrown together by means of
rolling partitions, thus making one large
audience-room when needed, with seating
capacity for nearly 1200 people. The
building when completed will have all the
modern improvements, social-room, ladies'
parlors, lavatories, pastors study, session
room, janitor's quarters, a conservatory
for plants and palms (to be used in
decorating the church), etc.
The interior finish of the main audi
torium will be in oat and ash, and of the
chapel in Oregon pine; the walls above the
wainscoting to be tinted sand finish
plaster, with wood ceiling in the church
proper. The windows will be of art glass
of approved designs.
The congregation being anxious to
occupy its new field, the contract for the
chapel has been let and the edifice will be
ready for occupancy in April.
The chapel wiil be a complete building
in itself with seating capacity of from 500
t.> KKJ people. The church lot, having a
gentle slope back from Oak street, permits
basement rooms, and the chapel will have
there rooms arranged for social gather
ings, with ladies' parlors, kitchen, pantry,
etc. The main floor of the chapoi will
have a central room, 57x-iO feet, and large
classrooms for Sabbath-school on either
side, which may be thrown into the
central room by rolling nartitions. Over
these classrooms will be similar

be used for the regular church services
until the rest of the building is completed,
which will be as soon as the valuable
property now owned and occupied by the
congregation on Mission street is sold. A
temporary organ-loft will be built on the
east side of the chapel lor the pipe-organ

Howard Church was organized by Rev.
H. S. WilJey in 1850, and the first building
erected on a lot given by W. D. M. How

served it as pastors. The present pastor is
Rev. F. R. Farrand, who assumed charge
in November. 1894, coming from a most
successful work and a church of 650 mem
bers in Piltsburg, Pa. The new Howard
Church will be the first Protestant church
building to be erected in the park district,
and has every prospect for a rapid growth
and great usefulness in that part of the
City.
ARRESTED FOR BURGLARY.
The Two Men Who Bobbed the Pawn
shop of Adolph Oppenbeiin.
Frank Perry and Robert Phillips were
booked at the City Prison last night by
Captain Wittman and Policeman T. Rourke
on the charge of burglary. The police
claim they are the two men who broke
into the pawnshop of Adolph Oppenheim,
405 Dupont street, on New Year's morning.
The front window of the store had been
broken with a pitchfork and about $200
worth of jewelry stolen. Policeman
Rourke was detailed on the case, and on
Thursday morning arrested Phillips in his
room on Pine street. A portion of the
stolen articles were found in his room.
Perry had left the City and was arrested
yesterday afternoon at Palo Alto and was
brought to the City Prison. Perry is 21
years of age and Phillips 29. Phillips is
an ex-convict, having served a term for
burglary.
STAR OF FREEDOM CASES.
I.unriiftch and Newbert Discharged for
Want of Evidence.
For want of sufficient evidence to con
vict, the cases against Alexander Lun
disch and Peter Newbert, indicted for
stealing the schooner Star ot Freedom,
were dismissed by United States District
Judge Morrow, yesterday, on motion of
District Attorney Foote.
The Star of freedom was taken down
the coast to Mexico, and Oscar Bartels,
who assisted in running off with her, was
some time ago sentenced there to five
years in a Mexican prison. An effort by
Mr. Foote to have Bartels extradited
failed. The conviction of Bartels in
Mexico was due to the activity of the
American Consul. The Mexican Govern
ment returned the vessel to its owner,
Captain Johnson.
Miss Bocha'a Debut.
Miss Mabel Rocha made her debut In "A
Celebrated Case" at the Bush-street Theater on
Friday evening. There was a large attend
ance. Miss Rocha made a decided hit as Adri
enne. and Miss Rosclla La Faille was also re
ceived with marked favor. The support was
good.

No one who has visited the particular re

to more than California fame. In fact, the
artists of the West are producing work
that must in time bring recognition from
the â  lassie schools of the Old World. The
West is destined by nature ultimately to
be the favorite abiding place of irt and
i and song.
The peoole, as 8 rule, have no acequate

work v -v often comprehends hard labor
reat expense. Artists in this West

artist is burdened with more baggage than
any trooper carries. He must have his
chair with him, and the sketching um
brella that is indispensable, his easel, color
box and other sketching material, besides
the everyday necessary accou ferments of
travel. He must seek the best view, and
in order to arrive at that important con
clusion, he must do an almost inconceiv
able amount of climbing. The original
sketches are the actual keys to the paint
ings, and artists never like to part with
them, as they are often understood only
by the artist himself. The smallest sketch
is sometimes exceedingly expensive.
Every artist has his hobby, if so it may
;be termed. Knme prefer the mountains,
| some the marines, some the marshlands,
â  some interiors; others have the wild
flowei fancy, and others again mirror
human face and form till the canvas
seems endowed with life.

coast of Monterey ; all fields for the painter
where new fancies continuously arise and
new beauties appear in endless procession.
The wild flowers of this State are no
where equaled for beauty and variety. In
the spring of the year, the country's val
leys and hillsides look as if they had been
carpeted with green and then profusely
covered with flowers of every color and
hue. Mingled with wild grasses and foli
age, one may rind, within a short distance,
flowers thai together would exhibit as
many colors as there are tints in the rain-
Dow.
In some of our valleys, native wild flow
ers may be found at all seasons of the
year.
Flower paintine has been followed, as a
specialty, chiefly by the lady artists, who
take relined pleasure in this species of
work.
Many beautiful California flower paint
ings have won delighted commendation at
the art exhibitions. As in so many other
ways, California vies with all the world in
the richness and charms of her infinitude
of native blooms.
The pen-and-ink sketch by William
Keith treats of one of that well-known art
ist's favorite subjects, "The North Fork of
the American River." In the distance are
what are frequently called the Keith Alps.
Tiie elevation of the highest point is 9000
feet. There are patches of snow all about
the peak and rocks cropping' out here and
there. Cedar and other trees abound.
There is a good deal of glacial action there,
the rocks being: smoothed and polished
over, and then there are chaparral spots
and croppings of lava and conglomerate
rock of sandstone. To the rear of these
mountains, ut the left of t-he sketch, lies
Lake Tah'oe. Near by are Soda Springs,
and the place is much visited in me sum
mer time.
"The greatest impression ever made on
my mind by any scene," declared Hugo
Fisher, the landscape painter, "was re
ceived from a point on the Merced River in
the Yosemite Valley. There is a bend in
the .Merced, not far from El Capican. and
from there, I believe, one obtain* as grand
a picture as eye could desire. A descrip
tion of this scene, that I read in New York
several years ago, led me to take a trip to
the famous valley. There is a curious
coincidence in this regard. In the d?
scription which I read the author said
that, while gazing at the grand panorama,
a half-dozen Indian maidens approactied
the water's edge and plunged into the
Merced's cool tide, enjoying a morning
bath. It was a thoroughly Californian
sight to behold these children of nature,
THE NORTH FORK OF THE AMERICAN RIVER, BY WILLIAM KEITH.
with such a background, and it must have
awakened poetic fancy to hear the care-free
laughter of the maidens, the echoes re
bounding from the cliffs. Singular to
relate, I witnessed with my own eyes the
very same scene of which I read the de
scription in the East. I sketched it, and
painted from that scene a large picture."
The sketch by Mr. Fisher is a reproduc
tion of his favorite scene in the Yosemite.
The falls are seen in the distance thunder
ing over the cliffs from heaven. In the
middle-ground are sugar pines and other
kinds of trees and all sorts of shrubbery,
which reflect themselves in the clear
waters of the river below. The bend in the
Merced referred to is to the right of El
Capitan.
Whoever is at all familiar with sights on
the ocean beach will recognize in the pen
Bketcb by A. Joullin the sanddunes that
lie between Golden Gate Park and the sea.
The monotony of the sandy waste is some
what relieved by patches of weeds and
sagebrush, creeping vines and bunches of
long grass nearly as high as a man. Mr.
Joullin's sketch is a faithful picture of
these sanddunes.
Carl Jonnevold, a marine artist, has
made many paintings of scenery on the
Northern California coast. The sketch
shown by him on this pace represents a
view from the sea of the coast near Mendo
cino. The waves are dashing against
rocks that rise like fortresses from the
deep.
The pen-and-ink sketch of an Indian
family, by Henry Raschen, depicts a char
acteristically Western scene. It is drawn
from lite and the originals are to be found
in Mendocino County. The Indian hut is
made of redwood bark; the boy is playing
with a chipmunk, while his mother looks
on interestedly, and an aged squaw is pre
paring a meal inside the rude habitation.

the ants. When the rainy days came the
grasshopper was compelled to go out in the

"In a hailstorm," observed Mr. Rorphi.ro,
"you do not have to urge norses. The

unmanageable. It is extremely exciting
and the cowboys have their hands full a

Mount Shasta is shown as it, appears
from the immediate vicinity of Castle
Luke, in the sketch made by H. J. Bloomer,
who deems this the best view of the moun
tain obtainable. Mr. Bloomer tells an in
teresting story of the first sight of Shasta.
About twenty-five years ago, being disap
pointed in a professorship on account of
his youth, he started out into the wilder
ness to study nature. He followed a pic
turesque trail through the McCloud and
Pitt River country, and had a narrow es
cape irom hostile red men w!io were then
suspicious of all whites. In fact, the Mo
doc war was only a year in the future at
that time. The Indians mistook Mr.
Bloomer's camera and drawing utensils for
a surveyor's outfit, and the explanation

was made with difficulty. Government sur
veyors were in very bad repute with the red
men.
"My first view of Shasta," said Mr.
Bloomer, "was from Red Bluff. It was a
clear spring day and the mountain seemed
to hang like a wee cloud on the horizon.
Journeying on, it kept looming up over the
trees, growing bigger and bigger every
da}-. It required a week's walking to get
to the foot of Shasta. In company with

the town that bears his name, I went up

sketches and doing other congenial work,
but I never found another view of Shasta
equal to that from Castle Lake. The great
peaK. roseate in the morning sun, made a
sublime effect and the picture composed
perfectly.
"A Cabin in the Redwoods" makes still
another distinctively California!! sketch.
The artist, L. P. Latimer, has spent many
summers among the giant redwoods of the
Santa Cruz Mountains, and has made the
artistic study of redwood scenery a spe
cialty. The sketch published to-day is a
pleasing specimen of work on redwood
scenery.

town of Moro. It is i:i appearance like a
castle, and the waters play all around its
base. It stands in solitary grandeur, and
may be distinctly seen irom a long dis- ;
tance. While C. D. Robinson, the marine i
painter, was in San Luis Obispo County a I
few years ago. he made a sketch of this
rock from Mount Benton, on Baron yon

WE HAVE A NEW SMILE.
Its Origin According to an J-!ngliÂ§h
Authority.
In an age in which so many thines are
new it was not to be supposed that we
should escape the new smile. Like many
other such inventions, it comes across the
Atlantic from America, and, like the baby
pose of ten or twelve years ago, it attacks
all sorts and conditions of women.
The wide and careless smile, more a grin
than a smile, which is the mark of thoso
who let themselves be swayed by an ill
considered mirth to the detriment of their
personal appearance, has quite gone out of
fashion. The new exercise is a slow and
dreamy expansion of the lips. It is poetic,
ami hints at great things, such as a Mfc
not understood by the ordinary run of
folk, a heart yearning for love and other
kindred subjects, and is calculated to lay
low at the first fire all but the most bu
colic and heartless of mon.
And yet the origin of the new smile is by
no means so poetic; it is merely an affair
of dentistry when its springs are analyzed.
In America as we know from books of
travel, women are forever sucking candy,
with the result that their teeth suffer, and,
though the dentists of the States are sec
ond to none, tnere are occasions when
they cannot repair the ravages of the
sweet-stuff shops. Therefore.it is not al
ways safe to smile with effusion, for it may
be that a tooth is imperfect, though not
yet ready for extraction.
The art of theiuew smile consists in con
cealing the affec ed tooth, and only show.
ing those of its companions which will bear
momentary inspection. In fact, the new
smile, like so many of its contemporaries,
is a sham, and the only good thing that
can be said in its favor is that it is not
worn by the new woman. â London Globe.

ARIZONA'S MEW RAILROADS
They Will Soon Connect Her
With the New South
west.
AN EXPENSIVE CONSTRUCTION.
A Master Stroke Made by the Atlantic
and Pacific Railway
System.
PIKES IX, Ariz., Jan. 2.â The railroads
of Arizona will soon connect her with the
new Southwest. Soon will those robust
arms of civilization bring to her feet the
markets of the world, for, while other
States and Territories have been talking of
their rich possessions and what they will
v-> with them, Arizona lias been steadily
forging links of material worth. The work
has been done so quietly that the rest of
the world, scarce suspecting her onward
marcb, is yet calling her a zoological
garden, where rattlesnakes and Gila mon
sters thrive. Little does it know that Ari
zona built more miles of gleaming steel
and sturdy crossties last year than any
other subdivision of the Union. Little
does it know that other and grander enter
prises are now maturing in the brains of
men. Theold "Hassayampers" have been
bard at work, though the sounding of cym
bals and the blare of trumpets nave not
heralded the upward march of their brawny
ranks.
The result has been that in the past year
134 miles of railroad, costing untold thou
sands, have been built, and the end is not
yet. With envious eyes has the Southern
Pacific looked upon that stroke of enter
prise by which the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad, a part of the Atchison, Topeka
-.mta Fe system, secured, through the
Santa Fe, Prescott and Pho nix Railway, a
line which it (the Atlantic and Pacific)
controls, the lion's share of Pho?nix,
and consequently Arizona, passenger
traffic For years has the Southern Pa
cific resisted the encroachments of any
railroad not controlled by it, and the con-
Bequence of this policy, so long pursued,
is that it is now contemplating right-of
way grabs that will startle the people of
Arizona as soon as they awake to the full
significance of recent events.
The preparations for securing Southern
Pacific franchises have been made with
the utmost secrecy, but when Collis P.
Huntingdon condescended to submit to
the discomforts of a long ride over the
Arizona desert, through which his railroad
runs, in order to inspect the work of con
struction upon tne Gila Valley, Globe and
Northern Railroad, those who knew him
knew he was on no pleasure trip, for
Bowie station, where he stopped for two
or three days, is not the most cheerful
spot in the world. It is, however, the
present terminus of the Gila Valley, Globe
and Northern.
To begin at the beginningâ always a
good plan in a one of this kindâ it will be
Been by referring to the map that the Gila
Valley, Globe and Northern Railroad is
only sixty-two miles in length and runs
from Bowie station to Fort Thomas. Its
present prospective terminus is Globe,
which Will make it when tinished 140
miles in length. The last Congress granted
this road right of way through the Han
Carlos Reservation on condition that the
Apaches be paid for their land. Pending
the negotiations construction work is not
being pushed just now. Much is heard of
the fact that the lands should be con
demned, that the Indians should be made
to take what is given them and that the
conditional clause of the right-of-way
franchise should be abrogated, but no one
Beemstoknow to whom the road belongs
and tne company refuses all information.
As a matter of fact, however, it is nothing
more nor less than a ramification of the
Southern Pacific.
About the same time that Mr. Huntins;
ton was visiting Arizona, Bowie station
and the wort of construction on the Qila
Valley. GJobe and Northern, the Phoenix,
Tempe and Mesa City Railroad, just com
pleted, and presumed to be the private
property of N. K. Maaten, Francis Cutting
and Sydney Smith of San Francisco, was,
at a secret meeting of the board of direc
tors, consolidated with tne Maricopa and
Phoenix Railroad, another spur of the
Southern Pacific, which runs from .Mari
copa 10 Phoenix, a distance of thirty-four
miles, uuder the name of the Maricopa
and Phoenix and Salt River Valley Rail- J
road. The recently completed portion of
this consolidation runs from Tempe, a j
station on the line cf the older branch, to
Mesa City, a distance of nine miles, and 11 I
projected to the Goldneld mines, distant
fifty miles east.
A few weeks ago Francis Cutting and
N. K. Masten came to Phoenix and re
mained four days, during which time they
traveled to Globe by way of the most ac
cessible route between that town and
Mesa City, it is a distance of about
seventy miles and a journey that no one
would think of taking for his health.
When I asked Mr. Cutting, however, if
this journey had any significance, he
answered, "Oh no." When I varied my
form of query and asked Mr. Masten if
the Southern Pacific was contemplating a
change of routes so that through trains
would pass through Phoenix, he looked
very wise and said he was not at liberty to
tell. I happened to know, however, that a
party of Southern Pacific surveyors will
go over the route pursued lav these gentle
men in spring. Between Gila Bend and
Bowie station, a distance of 240 miles, the
Southern Pacific has not put in a single
stick or rail of new material for three
years.
A large landholder of Maricopa County
and a citizen of Phoenix has secured for
some railroad, the name of which is not
mentioned in his application, right of way
through this city. >q one knows what he
wants with it, for, while he is a wealthy
man, he has not money enough to build a
railroad. But if all these facts do not
point very stronely to the conclusion that
the Southern Pacific will have all the
southern routes to Phoenix covered by its
own track? before another year is past, all
logical deductions count for naught.
If the deductions are worth anything,
the fate of Tucson is sealed. That thriv
ing city will be abandoned, and thus one
ol the very oldest towns in the Southwest
will sink from its present prosperity, and
decay just as did those other towns along
the line of the Arizona Central when that
road was abandoned years ago. For Ari
zona as a whole, however, it will probably
be just as well, for instead of carrying
I'ha'hix-bound passengers over the desert,
they will be brought through the richest
farming and mining sections of the Terri
tory. It will also pass through the great
San Carlos coal tields, and will make of
Phoenix the greatest manufacturing and
distributing center in the new Southwest.
Aside from this, however, Arizona has
already twelve railroads, aggregating a to
tal length of 1:275 miles, and costing an es
timated aggregate of $6,591,514. This is a
good deal for a "zoological garden," fur
hi- railroads completed run through the
richest portions of Arizona, and those pro
jected tap the best sections of the new
Southwest.
The Atlantic and Pacific, which traverses
the northern portion of the Territory a
distance of 393 miles, has developed all the
lumbering interests of this Territory. On
the line of this road is Williams", from
where only a few days ago some choice
lumber was shipped to the farthest anti
podes. The Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoe
nix, recently completed, is practically con
trolled by the Atlantic and Pacific, for
which road it is a feeder. From Ash Fork,
on the line of the Atlantic and Pacific, to
Phcenix, a distance of li"7 miles, it tra
verses the most picturesque portions of
Arizona, tapping the rich mining districts,
and has already begun to develop the vast
and invaluable quarries of building stone.
In turn, the United Verde and Pacific is a
feeder for this road. Its course is from
Banghart, on the line of the Santa Fe.
Prescott and Phcenix, to the Jerome mines.
At these mines are some of the richest
copper deposits in the world, rivaling if
not surpassing in value the famous Ana
conda and Lake Superior. On this little
road, whose total length is only twenty
seven miles, was done some of the most
wonderful civil engineering the world has
ever known. From Vulture station on the
Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix, the Castle
Creek Hot Springs Railway runs to the
Castle Creek Hot Springs, a distance of
twenty miles. These hot springs have
been pronounced by high medical authori
ty as the finest in the Southwest. The
road has already been surveyed and will
probably be built this year, as N. O. Mur
phy. Territorial Delegate to Congress, is
largely interested in it. From Flagstaff,
on the Atlantic and Pacific, the Flagstaff
and Southern pierces the pine forests a dis
tance of forty-seven miles. When this
road was built it was intended that it
should run down the valley of the Rio
Verde to Tucson, but the Santa Fe, Pres
cott and Phoenix supplanted it.
It is now operated by D. M. Riordan of
the Arizona Lumber Company and is used
for hauling logs from the camp to the
mills. From Prescott Junction, or Selig
man, on the line of the Atlantic and Pa
cific, the Prescott and Arizona Central runs
to Prescott, a distance of seventy-three
miles. It is deserted now. the Santa Fe,
Prescott and Phcenix offering better ac
commodations and a nearer route, so it
I was abandoned &a a non-paying invest
| ment. All of these roads are in the north
; crn and central portions of Arizona.
In the south the most important road is
the New Mexico and Arizona, which runs
from Benson on the line of the Southern
Pacific to Nogales, a distance of 287 miles.
This road is owned by the Atchison, To
peka and Santa Fe system, and is used by
it as a part of its route from Benson to No
gales, on the way to Guaymas, old Mex
ico, reaching this latter point over the
lines of the Southern Pacific, which it
leases from Denring, New Mexico, to Ben
son, Arizona. The Arizona and New
Mexico runs from Clifton, Arizona, to
Lordsburg, New Mexico, a distance of
fifty-six miles.
Its principal traffic comes from the Ari
zona Copper Works at Clifton. The Ari
zona and Southeastern runs from Benson to
Bisbee. seventy-three miles. It is a
feeder for the Southern Pacific, and is op
erated by the Copper Queen Mining Com
pany, from which most of its traffic comes.
The Tuc&on, Globe and Northern runs from
Tucson northerly ten miles to Camp Lowell
an abandoned United States fort, and is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
projected to Globe. It will probably never
be built, however, since the contemplated
change of Southern Pacific route spoken
of above would supplant and make it use
less. Another projected road is an exten
sion of the Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix.
This road contemplates building from
Phoenix, its present terminus, to Cala
basas, via Tucson. This would displace
the lease the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe holds on the Southern Pacitic lines
from Deming. N. Mex., to Benson, Ariz.,
as the first-named road would bring all its
through Mexican traffic via Phoenix.
Verily it seems as in that olden time, all
roads lead to Rome. In other words,
passengers bound for Guaymas or Mexi
ican points would be brought from Albu
querque, N. Mex., over the Atlantic and
Pacific to Ash Fork, Ariz., thence over the
Santa Fe, Prescott and Phoenix, via Pres
cott, Phoenix, Florence and Tucson, and
thence again over the New Mexico and
Arizona to Nogales, and thence over the
Mexican line owned by the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe to Guaymas. This
would materially affect the Southern
Pacific passenger receipts, the latter route
being far shorter and decidedly more
pleasant.
The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad will
also enter Arizona in the near future, the
line having already been surveyed. This
line will run from Durango, Colorado,
through the Moqui and Navajo reserva
tionsâthus securing all Government sup
plies intended for those reservations â to
Flagstaff, Arizona, where it will absorb
the Flagstaff and Southern, running thence
down Tonto Creek, across Tonto through
the Salt River Valley to Phoenix.
From Phoenix the San Dieco, Yuma and
Phoenix Railroad will run via Yuma,
Ariz., to San Diego, Cal. This road
is already an entity, the survey having
been made, $0,000,000 of capital stock hav
ing been subscribed, officers elected and fif
teen miles of road built from the San
Diego end. This will enable the Denver
and Rio Grande to reach the coast. The
full value of this road to Phoenix and Ari
zona can hardly be contemplated, as it
opens the Southern California markets to
the wares of the New Southwest. Truly
the day of the Southern Pacific is over, for
with the competition that will result from
the building of these many roads rates
will go down until monopoly is dead.
A survey has also been made for build
ing the Rio Grande Western from Marys
ville, Utah, to Flagstaff, Ariz. This ex
tension would tapavyst mining country
of untold richness and open a Utah mar
ket. It would also prove a great scenic
route, as the line crosses the Grand Can
yon of the Colorado at Lee's Ferry, the
only place it can be crossed, and its must
picturesque point. In that portion of the
road which runs from Flagstaff to the
Grand Canyon, James A. Fleming, a well
known California capitalist, is largely in
terested.
The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
also contemplates entering Arizona. The
survey for this road has been made from
Liberal, Kans.,via Albuquerque. X.Mex., to
the headwaters of the Salt River, down the
Salt River Valley to Phoenix. The Denver
and Rio Grande, the Rio Grande Western
and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific
have always been friendly roads and these
contemplated extensions mean nothing
more or less than that they are seeking tin
outlet to the Pacific Coast. To further
this end they would use the San Diego,
Yuma and Phoenix, in which projected
road all of them are financially interested.
There is a brilliant future awaiting this
"zoological garden" over here southeast of
the Sierra Nevadas; the bright day of
prosperity has already begun to dawn; the
eastern horizon is already overcast with
the rosy gleam of brighterdays. But, like
all the newer States and Territories, Ari
zona, for her future, must depend largeiy
upon her railroads. Capital should en
counter no obstacles, for when the rails of
gleaming steel thread the mountain gorges
wherein are hid the goodly stofes of
copper and lead, coal anil iron, sil
ver and goldâ when they span the
canyons where the swift waters rush
between the walls of granite and sandstone,
onyx and marbleâ when they traverse the
valleys where the husbandman finds guer
don meet his daiiy toil â where the butter
flies sip the honeyed tide of the altalfa
bloom â where the bearded heads of golden
grain nod with old-fashioned courtesy as
though thanking the fledgling for his
rhyme â where the golden orange gleams in
the eternal sunshine â where the sleek-fed
kine graze in meadows green, this land of
sunshine and lorgotten history will count
onward and upward; and when it does
San Francisco shall have just cause for re
joicing, for the Golden Gate, where the
masts of vessels stand like clean trimmed
: trees, offers a harbor, and the ports of

A CLEVER SWINDLE.
lloyr a Couple Worked an Open-and-
Sl: ut Bank Account.
I was talking to a detectives few days
ago, and he told me of what he termed the
shrewdest swindle he had ever encountered
in his professional experience. "A man
and his wife stopped at a first-class hotel.
They were tourists, they said, traveling
for the husband's health. They ran out
of funds, and, showing a bankbook with a
very large deposit to his credit, they suc
seeded in cashing several good- sized
checks. These were returned un honored
with the information that the funds of the
funds of the drawer had been attached.
There was an ample sum in the bank at
the time the checks were given, but before
they reached it an attachment tied it up
and a subsequent judgment in the attach
ment suit withdrew the money.
After a thorough study of the case,
attorneys all agreed that it was a business
misfortune, and nothing could be done.
The same thing was done by the same

The Colored Church.
Dr. A. K. Carroll, in the Independent,
says that the aggregate of colored church
members in the United States is, in round
numbers, 2,674,000, distributed as follows:
Baptists, 1,403,589; Methodists, 1,1'J0,638;
Presbyterians, 30,000; Disciples of Christ,
18,578, and Protestant Episcopal and Re
formed Episcopal together, somewhat less
than 5000. According to the census fig
ures there has been an increase of 1,150,000
colored church members during the last
thirty years, which Dr. Carroll thinks is
unparalleled in the history of the Chris

These goods are from 36 to 54 inches wide
and are made up of all the broken lines we had
in the honae from 50c to 75c a yard. We also
include a line of 54-inch cloths in solid colors.
Silk and Wool 54-inch Goods, 50c.
46-inch Black and Blue Crepons, 50c.
Every yard of these goods is cheap at sjSl.

Earlier in the season we'd get $1 25 for them.
Silks, fanciesâ 3sc, 40c, 59c, 75c.
Too much cannot be said in praise of these
valuesâ fact the cocoons would never have
opened their shells it they'd known the silks
they were to yield were to be sold at such
ridiculous figures. There is no reason for this
sacrifice save that we want to confront you
with an entire new line of silks this spring.

of the
MAYORS of SAN FRANCISCO
Woman's gentle hand has made ltseif
munii [pal affairs here as eisewhere.
Woman's influence has been an unseen
but palpable power behind the throne of
San Francisco's mayoralty, and to the
â¢ of that invisible power be It said
â¢ â¢ has never been rudely or unwisely
exercised.
â¢â . i lie feminine element in the ad
ministration cf governmental affairs has
appeared to perform only social and be
nevolent functions, but it has operated
quiety in more direct fashion in practical
directions.
"My husband kept me fully acquainted
with City affairs," said one of the bright
est and loveliest of San Francisco's young
matron?. "I always insisted
knowing what had engaged his atten
tion during the day and believe I feit
the Mayor's re^pon>ibilities as a
did."
I'nquestionably in this instance, as in
many others, vifely affecti I with
womanly intuition has fun ied tbe so

masculine mind with its logic and its
slower processes.
Nine ladies have occupied the proud po
sition of counselor-in-chief to the execu
tiv. of t is City. The wives of the former
ra had much is common.
Mrs. H. P. Coon was the pioneer in this
field of honor, her husband succeeding H.
F. Teschemacher, who was a bachelor, the
first Mayor, in 1864 and holding that office
- â¢â  was rarely seen in public
as she was a confirmed invalid. She died
soon after the expiration of Mayor Coon's
second term. Mrs. Coon was a fine type

Mrs. McNutt, wife of Dr. W. F. McNutt,
only daughter â¢ â  Mayor and Mrs.
E ..â  con recall the visit of Queen
Emma of the Hawaiian Islands on her
tour around the world a ,ne of the state
occasions thirty years ago. Frederick 11.
of this City and Henry Irving Coon
of Berkeley are the sons of the then "first
lady of the City."
Next came Mrs. Frank McCoppin, wife
in Francisco's third May., rand pres
ent I'onniaster. The McCop .: residence
was then at the southeast cor;,rrof Va
lencia and Seventeenth street:--. ;y[ rs-
McCoppin was a young wife then .
with no sj ecial concern in affairs of
state. After the lapse of nearly | . : r ty
years she has grown white-haired, but re
tains the kindly face and manner that
made her a favorite in the days gone by.
. Henrietta B< Iby, widow of Th<
H. Selby. Mayor of Ban Fran isco from
I^7o to 1872, was distinguished for her hos
pitality and the magnificence of the vari
ous forms of entertainment at the mansion
on Rincon Hill. None of the wives of the
executives entertained oftener or more
lavishly. Mrs. Selby is a .Southerner and
retains traces of youthful beauty. She
divides her time when in California be-
Q her City residence. 211!) Buchanan
street, and her country seat at Menlo
Park. She is spending the present winter
in New York, where she iÂ« accompanied
by her daughter, Miss Annie SeJby. Mrs.
Faxon Atherton of Menio Park, Percy \V.
Belby of Menlo Park and Mrs. Kempff;
wife of Captain Kempff of the navy, are
her children. Mrs. Jackson Ralston of
Oakland and Prentice Selby of this City
are her step-children.
Mrs. Lucy Otis, widow of Mayor James
Otis, lives at the Occidental Hotel. She i
dispensed hospitality with a lavish hand i
during her husband's term of office from
1874 to 1876. The residence, at 821 Sutter
street, was the scene of a unique social
function at which Mrs. Otis presided with
grace. It was a breakfast to the Japanese
n. Mrs. McAllister and James
Otis Jr. of this City and Charles Otis of
Stockton are her children, and Mrs. S. E.
Bigelow is her niece. Mrs. Otis is a lady of
distinguished bearing and a refined face,
framed with snowy hair.
I The widow of A. J. Bryant resides at
U-l Cjay street with her IS-year-old
dauehter, and between them exists a con
fidence and companionship rare even for
mother and daughter. Mrs. Bryant has a
distinct recollection of the troublous times
of the Band-lot agitation which marked
her husband's administration. To her lot
fell the honor of entertaining many nota
bles who visited San Francisco between
pears 1876 and 1880. Chief among
them were ex-President Grant and party
when making thcit trip around the world,
John Russell Young, Minister to China;
the admiral of the Italian fleet and Mayor
Brown of St. Louis. Mrs. Bryant is a

this City, is the other member of her fam
ily. Throughout his term as Mayor Mr.
Kalloch retained his connection with the
Metropolitan Baptist Church as its pastor,
and his wife was active in church work.
Her aid as counselor was no small factor
in her husband's administration. She was

Mrs. George H. Sanderson, widow of
San Francisco's Mayor during the years
1891-92, now resides at Stockton with her
son, Dr. Harry Sanderson. She was en
titled to do the honors of hostess on the
occasion of President Harrison's visit to
the coast, but owing to her illness at that
time the duties were discharged by her
daughter-in-law, Mrs. George R. Sander

Mrs. E..8. Pond is a gracious, beautiful
woman. She is a native of Ohio, but has
spent her life here since her childhood.
She is not fond of public life, does not care
for the ballot and says sne would be a dire
failure as a politician. Sne was not called
upon to entertain in any special manner
during her husband's term, although their
magnificent home at 1019 California street
is admirably adapted to. such uses. On
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
mst \\ ednesday evening Mrs. Pond gave a
dinner of thirty-two covers in honor of
Miss Grant, the betrothed of her eldest
son. It is in such pleasant home functions
that she finds her greatest pleasure. Mrs.
Pond is one of the board of managers of
the Ladies' Protective and Relief Society.
The youngest of the ladies who have so
acceptably rilled their posts as social as
sistants to the Mayor is Mrs. L. R. Ellert,
whose home is at 1915 Webster street. She
discharged, her duties when ex-President
Harrison and party, Vice-President
Stevenson and party and the Wana
maker9 were the guests of the City in a
charming; manner. Her pleasantest recol
lection of her husband's administration is
the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson. A
picture of the party occupies a place of
honor in Mrs. Ellert's parlor.
Mrs. Ellert is glad her husband is out of
public life. She is a devotee of home, al
though her beauty, intelligence and grace
would make her an ornament of any social
assemblage.
Curiously enough none of San Fran

PLAYISG TOE THE QUEEN.
How Preparations Arc Made for Per
formances at Windsor Castle.
Playing before the Queen by "royal com
mand," says an exchange, is the highest
desire of every English follower of the
j stage who desires to reach the topmost
round in the ladder of fame. The Queen
has had but few performances held before
j her of late years, and the notice in each
] ca^e has Deen very short.
When the manager of a company has
been notilied to appear with his players or
j singers for the royal pleasure, he iinme
i diately hastens to Win dsor with his scenic
; artists and stage mechanics to make ready
! for the performance. The temporary stage
: and theater is constructed and the per
| formers have special rehearsals. The gen
i eral members of the company are also
given a thorough coaching if an onera is to
! be produced, as the Queen is very critical.
The stage is erected at Waterloo chamber
â that being the apartment generally used
for the purpose â the auditorium con
structed, the royal and other seats arranged
according to precise instructions, and the
chamber decorated witb floral and other
adornments. During these preparations
in the castle those ol the Princes, and Prin
cesses who happen to be there frequently
look in and assist â their aid not being lim
ited to suggestions and directions, but
sometimes extending to moving with their
own bands this or that piece of furniture
or decoration to judge how best it should
be placed. The Queen also may "drop in"
â MKS. I. s. KALLOCUâ IBBO<BI.
to inspect progress, much to the trepida
tion of officials and workmen, for all of
whom these preparations are an anxious
operation; for her Majesty has keen judg
ment and a critical and artistic eye, and
without any warning may order all that
has been done to be undone.
Simultaneously with this work numer
ous rooms are being got ready for the
coming company, while the royal chefs
and their assistants are kept busy with
preparations in their department.
At the performance the Queen's chair
faces tne center of the stage, sliirhtlv in
advance of all other seats. Right and left
arecha:rs for the members of the royal
famuy, and behind these are seats for the
ladies and gentlemen of the household and
invited guests.
A rich and beautiful programme is pro
vided for her Majesty; less elaborate but
yet dainty artistic programmes being sup
plied for the rest of the audience. Then
ti.e performance proceeds. The Queen
always leads the applause, and tne others
present take the cue from her action
beginning generally at 10 o'clock after
the late royal dinner, these performances
conclude auout midnight and then there
isarush for the good things bountifully
laid out in the several supper-rooms im
provised for the occasion. The principals,
having been presented to her Majesty, sup
in one apartment with such of the gentle
men of the household as care to join them '
the rest in other rooms, according to the
grades and distinctions preserved.
The special trains for the return home
are to leave at 1 o'clock, even though it be
Sunday morning, as it several times has
been, and for a time the thoroughfares are
alive with the visitors hurrying to the sta
tion in royal carriages or on foot. Many
of the higher oihcials in the castle accom
pany the party, and the leave-taking is al
ways cordia! and sometimes just a trifle hi

SERIOULTUBii IN ENGLAND.
I'.rief History of the Manufacture of Silk
Across tlie Atlantic.
Thirty-five years ago England was manu
facturing six times as much silk as she is
to-day. Last year the total value of the
silk goods manufactured was. roughly,
Â£2,000,000; in 1800 it was Â£12,000,000. Tak
ing into consideration the increase in
population, the increase in the quantity
of silks which must be used, and, more
over, the considerable increase in the num
ber of purposes to which silt is applied,
one is inclined to believe that the English
silk industry at this moment indicates the
healthiest and most promising signs of an
early and total extinction. And, were it
not that during the last few years efforts
for its resuscitarion have been made in
various directions, which have been to
some extent successful, but scant hope
could be entertained of its survival.
Silk manufacture is a thing we ought to
feel we would not willingly lot die without
some strenuous endeavor being made to
avert so untimely a catastrophe? It is one
of our most artistic industries and one of
oar oldest and it has an honorable history.
Ip. the year 1183 it existed in this country;
in France we do not hear of it. until 1480*
and it was not until lul'O that it was intro
duced into Lyons.
In 1585 the influx of refugees from the
religious persecutions in France and Hol
land began and many of the persecuted
were weavers of silk. This resulted in a
quickening of the English tilk manufac
ture and we are indebted to the mis or
tunes of these countries for the good for
tune which then came to our own.
James 1 made excellent endeavors not
only to encourage silk weaving but also to
introduce siik culture, or the production of
raw silk from the cocoon, into the land,
and for this purpose the mulberry trees
that may still be found in various country
parishes were planted. Our climate, how
ever, was not suited for this purpose, for
the silkworm eggs were hatched before the
appearance of the leaves on the mulberry,
and the silkworm died of starvation. This,
however, was no permanent drawback to
the industry, as by far the greater propor
tion of raw "silk has had to be imported by
silk-manufacturing countries.
Another hundred years passed, and a
still fiercer persecution took place in
France when Louis the XIV revoked the
Edict of Nantes, and the Huguenot weav
ers once more found refuge in this coun
try. In thirty years England became an
important producer of silks, which were
chiefly manufactured at London, Nor
wich, Macclesfield and Leek. At Derby,
in 1717, John Loombe established the silk
throwing mills for the manufacture of silk
yarns which became so celebrated, and
the productions of which were sold in
Italy for better prices than Italian-thrown
silks. At the beginning of tiie last cen
tury Coventry began the weaving of rib
bons. Nottingham, in the early years of
the present century, began to make lace,
including silk lace, and eighty years ago
Nottingham was also weaving broad
goods. â National Review.
THE THEONE OF AUSTfiIA.
Emperor Francis Joseph to Choose a
Successor.
Now that the question of altering the or
der of the succession to the throne of Aus
tria-Hungary has become a matter of pub
lic discussion in the semi-official press of
Vienna and in the imperial legislature it
i may be regarded as having passed out of
; the domain of mere court gossip and of
| club rumor into that of practical politics,
, and as such lias become worthy of serious
, attention abroad. It was first mooted at
1 the time of the death of Crown Prince Eu-
MRS. E. B. PONDâ IBB7-88.
dolph, was revived when Archduchess i
Marie Valeric save birth to her eldest boy,
and has now come once more to public at
tention through the severe illness of Arch
duke Francis Ferdinand, who is afflicted
with consumption, and whose days are
consequently numbered. His death will,
unless the order o! succession is altered,
have the effect of rendering his younger
brother, Otto, heir presumptive to the
throne, an eventuality which neither the
Emperor nor yet the nation can contem
plate with equanimity.
For Otro is the black sheep of the reign
ing family and the most universally ex
ecrated member of the house of Hapsburg.
The estimation in which lie is held by his
countrymen may be gathered from the
fact that when some time ago he exhibited
at one of the art shows of Vienna a water
color which he had painted, representing a
wild boar surrounded by its proeeny, it
was the standing joke for people to ask
one another what they thought of "Otto's
letzte Schweinerei"â Otto's last piece of
hoggishness! He is not only a libertine,
but also a drunkard, and his behavior to
his charming wife, a daughter of Prince
George of Saxony, has been of so disgrace
ful a character that on two occasions she
has been compelled to leave him and to re
turn to her famiiy.
Once he disgraced himself by stopping a
peasant's funeral while he was outriding
with some friends in the country around
Prague and by leaping his horse back
ward and forward a number of times over
the cottin. So great was the scandal cre
ated by the incident that it wa3 brought
up for discussion in the Imperial Parlia
ment in Vienna, the well-known Deputy
Pernerstoffer declaring in a most impas
sioned and eloquent speech that it was un
just to reproach the students of the Uni
versity with excesses when the younger
members of the imperial family themselves
set such an example. On the following
day a party of young noblemen, boon com
panions also of Archduke Otto, invaded
the house of the Deputy in question and
administered to him a terrible thrashing,
injuring him so severely that he was
MRS". L. R ELLEKTâ IB93-94.
obliged to keep his bed for some weeks
afterward.
Emperor Francis Joseph not only de
tests his nephew, but is known once to
have struck him in the face in a fit of fury
at some piece of blackguardism that the
Prince bad perpetrated. For he sees re
flected in Prince Otto all the Crown
Prince's worst faults, without a single one
of "Rudi's" many redeeming qualities.
To all this it may be replied by way of
argument that it is not Otto, but his father,
Arckduke Charles Louis, who stands next
to the Emperor in line of succession. But
Charles Louis, although younger than
Francis Joseph, is infinitely more broken
by age and infirmities, and besides, in
spite of his being as respectable as Otto is
the reverse, his ascent of the throne would
present, from a national point of view, al
most as many disadvantages as that of his
son. Indeed, his succession would prob
ably result in a revolution in Austria itself,
and in an insuirectionon the part of Hun
gary against the continuance of Austrian
rule.
Of all the princes in Europe this arch
duke is assuredly the most reactionary,
the most bigoted and the most narrow
minded. Throughout the present reign
Archduke Charles Louis has shown him
self a most uncompromising foe of every
thing in the nature of reform and progress.
Under the circumstances it will be read
ily understood that Emperor Francis Jo
seph, who is a shrewd and remarkably
sensible man, and who has at heart the
welfare of his people and of his dynasty,
should take steps to avoid the disasters
with which both one and the other are
threatened in the event of either his
brother or his nephew succeeding
to the crown. It is understood that
he has now definitely adopted measures to
debar them from the throne and to assure
the inheritance thereof to the eldest son of
his younger and favorite daughter Valeric,
the elder of his two girls having married a
Bavarian prince. No one knows exactly,
save the Emperor and one or two of his
most trusty counselors, what the precise
terms of the law are which govern the suc
cession to the thrones of Austria and Hun
gary, or to what extent they are suscepti
ble of modification by the sovereign of the
day. They are kept a profound secret, the
Minister of the Imperial Household being
compelled on assuming office to take an

oath not to divulge the slightest informa
tion regarding them.
By many it is erroneously supposed
that the succession is governed by the so
called Pragmatic Sanction, which was the
cause of the War of Succession in the early
part of the last century. It is doubtful,
however, whether this epecies of treaty is
still in existence or whether it really re
ceived the assent of the two divisions of
the Dual Empire, for the famous Austrian
historian, Hormayr, explicitly declares
that the signatures and the docu
ments to which they are applied,
bearing the date of 1713, were for
geries, and the ' official Hungarian
papers, in response to the question raised
about the matter a few years ago by Louis
Kossuth, were compelled to admit "thai no
traca of the treaty in question is to be
found either in the Suite archives at
Vienna or Budapest. In fact, according
to the most eminent authorities in Austria
there is nothing to prevent Emperor
Francis Joseph, who has pointedly ab
stained from ever referring to his brother
or nephew as his successor, from nominat
ing as his heir to the throne of Austria-
Hungary his young grandson, Archduke
Franz.â Ex-Attache, in New York Tribune.
CHECKS DKAWN BY WOMEN.
Extent of the Drafts on Bunks That
Cater to Female Custom.
Checks drawn by women and aggre
gating in value more than $100,000 have
been cashed by a few of the banks in this
city and Brooklyn within the last three or
four days. In almost every instance the
money paid out on the demand of these
feminine checks was brand new.
For a number of years the banks that
cater especially to women have made it a
practice at Christmas time to pay out new
bills and new coin only in honoring the
checks of female depositors. Two or three
of the banks use nothing but new money
for this purpose all the year around.
As compared with the drafts of previous
years, the women of New York and Brook
lyn have been quite economical in their use
of Christmas money this year. R. C. Lewis
who is in charge of the "women's depart
ment of the Lincoln National Bant, said
that while not so many checks of large
figures had come under his observation
this year as last, he was of the opinion
that fully as many ladies' checks had been
cashed and he did not know but that the
average might run a little hieher in 1594.
All women's checks are paid with new
money at this bank.
H. C. Dv Val, although busy with Mr.
Deprew's affairs most of the time, is an
active member of the executive commit
tee of the Schermerhorn Bank in Brooklyn
of which institution he wias one of the
organizers. That bank is conspicuously a
woman's, bank, and the fair depositors
have kept the paying tellers busy for the
last ten days. Only new money is paid out
here. Saturday and yesterday were par
ticularly lively days, Mr. da Val said:
"The women have apparently curtailed
their expenditures this year. Although
their checks have been as numerous aa
last year they have averaged smaller in
amount."
Jacob R. Demarest, payinp teller of the
Bauk of New Amsterdam, said that the
woman depositors of that bank had been
active in drawing out money for Christ
mas, but he did not think that the
amounts drawn were so large as last
year's. For instance, where a woman
would have drawn a check for $150 last
year the same woman would be likely to
draw out $100 this year.â New York Times.

1718
The rapidly waning; season growa gayer
toward its close. The past week has had
considerable of incident and interest dur
ing its sevon days, and the one that opens
this morning promises still more of enter
tainment to tne members of the gay world.
The falling of the curtain ou the winter's
gayeties is now announced for February
19. The last act of the drama, or rather
the comedy, how holds the stage and there
is that unmistakable rustle in the audience
which gives evidence that the play is near
ly over.
The week opened, as did both its prede
cessor?, with a number of theater par
ties followed by a numDer of dinners and
dances or ball.*. ]t i* di;tier.lt to always
draw a distinction between the entertain
ments known as a nance and a ball. Tne
latter term, applied indiscriminately to all
events where dancing is a feature, has to
some extent become meaningless, like the
good old names lady and gentleman in
these days, when those terms are applied
to every one no matter what their reputa
tion or profession may be. A ball is really
tt large dance, and properly speaking mean
an assemblage of at least people.
The Terpsichoreans' guests numbered
about this figure, and a? it was given in a !
large hall it may l>e calied a ball. It was i
a somewhat juvenile gathering, most of i
the girls not yet being out in society and j
many of them only thi? season's buds. A i
prettier set of girls ha? never been seen in
this City before or a prettier ball given. |
The supper was served in the usual dining
room. The cotillon \yas danced in the
large canvased ballroom, whose walls,
from base to ceiling, were lined with palms, I
ferns and garlands and draperies. The
music was particularly good, all the selec
tions having been well chosen.
The following nieht came the third
meeting of the Friday Nieht Club, a full
account of which appeared in yesterday's
Call.
Last evening came the annual dinner
and dance given by the guests of the Hotel
Richelieu to their many friends. The din
ner was followed by a very spirited dance,
which kept up until midnight, when the
guests partook of a delicious sapper.
Among those at the several dinners and
dances were: Mr. and Mrs. Peter McG.
McÃean, Miss McÃean, Miss Kip, Miss
Mary Kip, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Elliott,
Morton Gibbons, Miss Ida Gibbons, Mr.
and Mrs. and Miss Emma Butler, Mr. and

Hobaxt, Walter S. Hobart, Phil Tompkins,
Mr. and Mrs. Preston, Mips Preston, Baron
yon Balveron, and a number of others.
Miss Hyde of New York has been spend- I
ing the week here with her friend, Miss '
Genevieve Goad, whose charming house is
a most delightful place to stay. It goe3
without saying that Miss Hyde has en
joyed herself and has been the recipient of j
much attention, fur she is such a favorite I
that she is sure to make friends and have
a good time either at home or abroad. At
the Cotillon Club on Friday she looked re
markably well and wore a becoming and
stunning nown.
Oakland has not often had a more
charming addition to its society than Mrs.
be ward B. McNear (nee Baroll) of Balti
more, who has lately come with her hus
band to live there. !She made her first ap
pearance in San Francisco society at the '
cotillon on Friday last and was very much |
admired. Already many luncheons, teas j
and dinners have been given in their i
honor.
We have now come to the part of the !
year when we can no longer put off any- j
thintt, except, perhaps, a visit to our poor i
relations, which may be safely left for the i
duties after the Lenten season ; but it will I
not do to defer many other things. Our I
visiting list is before us, and tne old re- I
frain of "After Christmas I will do so and
so," "and go here and there" can no more
be said. No, we must face the situation, j
and if we do not intend to give a ''tea" or
an "at home" we must start out and call I
on the "smart set" or else we are "not in
it.''
A tea, however, cancels our visiting ob
ligation, except our party calls for dinners
or luncheons, or when we wish to specially
honor the stranger within our gates.
Some witty woman said lately that "a !
tea was a great clearing-house for cards,"
and it is an unwritten law of society that i
even if we only send our small pasteboard \
representative the most exacting has no
right to say that we "owe" them a visit,
so this in these busy days is decidedly an
advantage. Visiting on old-time methods ,
has entirely gone out. Then one called j

whose doorbell was so religiously rung.
Now all this is done away with. Every
one has days, or, as said just now, gives
some form of tea or Jarge reception, to
which all are bidden, and, therefore, the
social function of visiting is made much
pleasanter, for at least we really meet peo
ple and sometimes strike up an agreeable
intercourse which enables us to be quite
sociable and chatty when we meet in the
summer at the resorts.

the arrival of a party of older persons, coming
as a surprise to Mr. Jones, and consisting of the
members of his German and Spanish classes.
They repaired to the upper rooms, and were
soon engaged at games of cards. At 12 o'clock
refreshments were served in the dining-room,
the children having partaken of theirs earlier
in the evening. While their elders wer<s at

NEXT WOMAN'S CONGRESS
"Woman and Government" Will
Be the General Theme
of Discussion.
Mrs. Ellen M. Henrotin and Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Stetson
Will Participate.
The Woman's Congress of 1896 la
launched.
The executive board of the Woman's
Congress Association of the Pacific Coast
met in the parlor of the Occidental Hotel
yesterday afternoon to arrange details in
relation to the congress, which will open
May 4 and continue one week.
It was announced that in addition to
Miss Susan B. Anthony, Rev. Anna 11.
Shaw and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
whose services had already been engaged,
it was expected that Mr*. Potter Palmer of
World's Fair fame, Mrs. Ellen M. Hen
rotin, president of the General Federation
of Women's Clubs, and Mrs. Charlotte
Perkins Stetson, well knowiron this coast
and at present a resident of Hull House,
Chicago, would attend and participate.
"Woman and Government" was the gen
eral theme chosen for ths consideration of
the Congress.
"We chose this topic," said Mrs. George
T. Gaden, chairman of the programmo
committee, "because of the fact that Cali
fornia will soon be called upon to decide
whether or not women shall be enfran
chised, and we believed it would be wise
to arrange for a presentation of the truths
about government by trained thinkers of
this coast and the East, with a view to the
coining situation. Our aim is comprehen
sive. We want to consider the theme in
its most important phases, for instance,
analysis of povernment as a social func
tion, the birth, growth and latest develop
ment in government, the main lines of
governmental excesses and failure?, the
distinctive features of American govern
ment, and woman in fact and fiction â that
is, woman as she is in fact and woman as
viewed simply in the light of sentiment."
The opening day of fne Woman's Con
gress will be devoted to the consideration
of "Government/ 1 On May 5 "Forms
of Government" will be discussed.
"Woman" will be the theme on May (i,
"An Historic View" on the 7th, "Special
Phases of Government" on the Bth,
"Claims, Special and General," on the 9th,
and on the closing day (Sunday) the "Gen
eral Ethical Side of Government" will bs
discussed.
The programme was arranged by a com
mittee consisting of Mrs. George T. Gaden,
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Mrs. Charlotte Per
kins Stetson and Mrs. John P. Swift. The
board which met yesterday to indorse it
comprised Mrs. Sarah 13. Cooper, Mrs. Ada
Van Pelt, Mrs. George T. Gaden, Mrs.
Nellie .Blessing Eyster, Mrs. John F. Swift
and Mrd. A. A. Sargent.
Sixty-seven papers, whose authors have
not yet been chosen, will be presented at
the congress. Gentlemen will be invited
to participate in the afternoon as well as
the evening sessions. The executive board
will hold frequent meetings to arrange de
tails even to the minutire of the conven
tion.
The committee whose duty it is to select
a place for meeting has been making a
canvass for that purpose, but has as yet
made no choice.|jlt is designed that the
congress shall not be held in a church.
The members of the board express much
exthusiasm and predict that the coming
congress will be greater than any of its
predecessors.
Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw are ex
pected to arrive the latter part of next
month or early in March to assist in the
woman suffrage campaign.
Two Days for Oelrlchs.
Judge Hebbard has granted Herman Oelrichs
two days more In which to file his bill of ex
ceptions to the order of Judge Slack denying
his petition to be appointed guardian of his
Ron. Jud^e Seawell gave him two days from
January 2 because his Rttorney could not find
Judge Slack, and for the same reason Judee
HebDard gave him two days more. He asked
for ten days, but as the case was before Jud*?e
Slack, Judge Hebbard declined to give more
than. two.
BAB ON RINGS AND HANDS
The Jewels and Superstitions of
Some Prominent
Women.
DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BLONDE
A New Idea Said to Be Afloat as to
the Survival of the
Fittest.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 31.â The
woman who is best pleased with her
Christmas gifts is the one who got what
she called "the loveliest of rings." There
is something particularly fascinating
about a ring to a woman. Sometimes 1
think it is because she can look at it;
sometimes, because sh6 believes it makes
her hand look more beautiful. The girl
with a short, plump, dimplea hand ought
to make up her mind to give up every
ring except the one which is put upon her
finger during the marriage service, for
she whose hand is of the stylo described
does not add to its beauty by wearing
rings, but makes it look thick and coarse
when the jeweled bands are upon it. It
is the lady with the long, slender, taper
fingers who can wear rings advantage
ously, and just now fashion permits her to
jewel the third and little fingers of each
hand up to the first knuckle. But she
must be careful in arranging these rings.
If she chooses pointed marquise with a
sapphire or ruby set about with diamonds,
that must be the one ring on the third
finger, while the little finger may have
upon it three bands, two formed of dia
monds and one of rubies. Not to mix
one's gems is a law not only of order but
of fashion.
Bands of sapphires and diamonds are
greatly liked, not only for the real beauty
of the stones, but also because dark
sapphire tends to make the band look
whiter and more dainty. The round tur
quoise framed in a band of dull gold is
counted rather better form than a tur
quoise framed in diamonds, because one
wants to be able to consider the perfect
blueness of the stone, and not to have
this lessened by the glitter of the other
gems.
The smartest men are wearing the en
graved gold ringâ that is, a square or
rouna surface of dull gold, whicli has en
eraved upon it either a crest or a mono
gram, aa if it might be a seal; and it is
used very often for that purpose. Wonder
ful rings of aquamarine have the crest or
initials cut into the stone, but are quite as
often swung on, watchchains as worn on
on the linger. American men, unlike the
Prince of Wale?, have not a great affection
for rines ; and I confess myself to thinking
that, unless a ring is an heirloom, and
essentially a manly ring, it is best off a
man's liuger. As for jewels, they should
be left to women.
A marvelous turquoise, oval in shape,
and quite deep, is set in gold and worn by
Mrs. Langtry, who confesses to the pretty
superstition'that the wearing of turquoises
keeps friends true. A square emer
ald makes whiter, by contrast, the
beautifully shaped hand of Olga Nether
sole, who hopes that it is true that emer
alds bring good health. Fanny Davenport
is seldom seen without a ruby ring, that
flashes with greater brilliancy than any
diamond, and is so deep in color that it
suggests only the oldest and most crimson
of Burgundy wines. This is a jewel with
a history. For hundreds of years it was
in the forehead of an idol in India, but,
unlike the moonshine, it has brought good
luck to its nineteenth century wearer.
Somebody asked me, what" is a beautiful
hand?
First of all, it isn't a fat hand. A beau
tiful hand is slender ai the wrist, broadens
proportionately, has long lingers, that
shape out like tapers, and when the hand
is laid flat the tip of the thumb should
almost touch the very beginning of the
lirst knuckle of the forefinger. A short
thumb is evidence of a lack of brain.
Wasn't it Sir Isaac Newton who said,
"Show me the imx>rirt of a man's thumb
and I will tell you the strength of his
mind"? The nails should be thin, oval

and pink. To give them an extremely
high polish is in very bad taste, and to
make them extremely pointed is to suggest
that they are on incapable hands. Amer
ican women, as a rule, have small hands,
but they do not have beautiful hands.
English women have large hands, but
usually they are well shaped, white and
soft, though firm in grasp. French women
have small hands, well-formed hands, but
dark hands; but it is among the Spanish
and Italian women that the most beautiful
bands are found. In India the hands of
the women are Beautifully formed, ex
quisitely dimpled, indeed, have every at
tribute of beauty ; but they correspond in
color with the slightly dark faces that
belong to their owners.
American men seldom care enough for
their hands to make them anything more
than cleanly. Undoubtedly the climate
here, first hot and then cold, has much to
do with making the skin of the hand dry
and the nails brittle, but if only a little
care is eiven to the hands they respond
quickly, and certainly a beautiful hand is
a joy not only to its possessor, but to all
those who eitner look at it or touch it.
Haven't you shivered with horror as you
shook hands with him of the clammy
hand? Haven't you distrusted her whose
hands were as sbft and fat as a pincu,!i
--i ion? And haven't you felt almost fearful
l as you touched tne hand that was dry, hot
and a bit leathery in its feeling? AY lien
the ideal hand is touched, it is cool, not
cold; it is delicate, not rough, and if one
is conscious of the nail 3 at all, it is as if
one felt the inside of a shell.
Some time ago there was a fad, a very silly
one, for wearing a ring on the thumb. The
women who prefer to be conspicuous in
their get-up adopted this fashion, and a
few actors were also adorned, doubtfully
adorned, by the thumb ring. A little
search has proven that the thumb ring at
one time was dedicated to the slaves alone,
consequently, in wearing it now, one is sim
ply marking oneself as a slave to somebody
or something. First of ail, as a slave to
folly.
The wedding ring is always the same
whether it is worn by the Queen of Eng
land or she who yesterday stood behind
the shop counter, and it is in very bad
taste to have any other for the wedding
but the plain gold circle. In this country
a plain gold ring is occasionally worn by
women who are not married, and this is
questionable taste. In every other coun
try a glance at the left hand of a woman
tells whether she has a right to be ad
dressed "Madame" or "Mademoiselle." A
jeweler here says that in New Yo r k alone
there are enough plain gold rings made in
one year to encircle the entire island of
Manhattan. And somebody else has
started the question of the pins in connec
tion with them â i. c., What becomes of all
the plain gold rings? Among the Ger
mans the husband wears a wedding ring,
and I believe that this custom also ob
tains among some of the Hebrews, but
senerahzing it is the wife only who wears
the gold symbol of marriage.
Speaking of marriage, I see that some
woman has been giving as a reason for the
existence of the new woman the fact that,
by being a new woman and earning money,
she does not have to ask a man for it. Arid
then she went on to say : "The horror of
asking one's husband or father for money
is evident to all feminine minds, even
though all men are not like him who ex
claimed: 'What can a woman possibly
want with $s!'" Bother! The average
mother and daughter must be getting
dreadfully below the average if she nnda it
difficult to ask her mankind for money.
There are no women in the world who
haridle as much money as the American
women â I mean those women who have to
ask their mankind for it. And this is a
constant surprise to the English or the
French women, who get what they wish
and have it charged, but really handle
very little money in absolute cash. I
never go to the theater on Saturday after
noon that I don'tj feel like getting" up and
cheering for the American man, since
through his generosity the American
woman is having a good time. He makes
it possible for her to invite her dearest
woman friend to go out with her, to pre
sent her with a box of candy, to give her a
treat after the performance, and he is sat
isfied if his special womankind has had a
good time. English and French husbands
are not so generous. They take the women
out themselves and they get all the credit
for spending the money. I tell you our
men are fine, but we don't half appreciate
them.
Frenchmen make better sons, but Ameri
cans make better husbands. The French
man's first thought is of his mother. He
expects his wife to be subservient to her,
while the wife finds her greatest happiness
in her sons. Â±fut once an American is
married all his family are secondary to his
wife, and his mother is not of very much
account until she becomes "'Grand

herself by forcing him to give her

There is a new idea afloat in regard to
the survival of the fittest. It is said by
those learned people who know every.
thing that, in both England and America,
blondes are disappearing. This learned
person says that where you found ten
'bionde women five years ago you find one
now, and in fifteen minutes' walk on :Â»
crowded street where 200 women wera
counted of these thirteen only were
blondes, the rest having hair that ranee d
j from light brown to jet black, and skin 3
I and eyea in harmony. Some famous Eng
lishmen who examined the hair of a thou
sand young women carve to this conclu
sion :
That the brunette was preferred to the
blonde in matrimony in the ratio of three
to two. Then he explains the growth of
the brunette in this way : "It is a princi
ple in the law of natural selection that
nature adorns its pet?, the men and women
whom it wishes to survive and continue"
I the race with such allurements as will
prove attractive to the other sex." Now,
I according to this, nature has found thac
men prefer brunettes, choose thtm for
wives, and then, through the hereditary
transmission of traits, the blonde becomes
extinct. This learned gentleman really
says "is becoming extinct, :> and doesn't
say they are extinct, otherwise I couldn't
he alive, but 1 do agree with him that
there are fewer natural blondes.
Poets, however, explain it in another
way; they claim that men love brunettes
because they are more affectionate, that
blondes make intellectual and not lovinjf
wive*, consequently the Dlondes are out o
fashion. lam sorry, but that is of no u^e
for feminine grief against science is a i
nothing against the British army, so all .
can say to the blondes is to be as perky a: \
possible about their wits, and correspond- >
ingly contemptuous of the affectionate bru
nette. The finest combination, mentally
and physically, so says a French doctor, i.<
the bionde hair, the brunette eyes, brows)
and lashes and the semi-blonde skin. Thi^
woman will never make herself unhappy*
by her affection, but she will love discreetly*
and be sufficiently wise to be an agreeable
companion. Learned doctors are great for
citing just what types of women men
ought to marry, and then if they commit
the act themselves they are just as likely
to make mistakes as mere ordinary men,
for after all doctors are no more infallible
than ordinary people who don't know the
names of the bones and the reason why
the nerves act as if controlled by Satan.
Personally, I prefer a blonde baby, a
dark man and a semi-brunette woman!
Babies with black hair always loot iilid
monkeys, while those with either fair on
i perfectly bald heads do suggest angels. Al
, dark man may be no braver than a blondÂ«l
i one, but he looks it, and ttie girl wkhl
I black hair, blue eyes and a fair skin is aft
j thing of beauty and a joy forever, but yora
have got to go to the west of Ireland taj&
find her.
Whenever I sit in front of the lookinJÃ
glass and brush out my golden locks, anÂ«
realize that the scientists say that tb'tfc
blondes are dying out, I chuckle at n3t
reflection and console myself with th/B|
verse: P

Abul Hasan
the Wag
asan the Wag is a character
Lfl little no:e in Persian tradition. The
manner in which he hecameoneof the Khalee
boon-eompanions through a jest
entric ruler of Baghdad played upon
him was related in Ti:k Call of Sunday last.
The present narrative is one of the many
r. mances that center about the name of the
famous wag. The story is in itself admirably
irative of Persian character, winch in
variably chooses to gain its ends by some clev
erly contrived strate^em rather than by
straightforward means. The Persian courtier
is ever a man of ready wit, for this is largely
his means of subsistence, and the modern Per
sian is to-day very like his prototype of the
days ol Harouc-Er-Saschid- clever, witty,
lacious, sanny-natured, ready for any
manner of adventure, and more often an ad
rer than an honest gentleman. T>c
nt for life itself upoi the whims of a
capricious ruler, hold;- Â£Â»d position
by a tenure the most - und subject
to many vicissitudes at ; â â¢ hands of late, he is
â  the art of iving by his wits, an
..is native iondi
readily lend themselves. The jest
'. by Abu-1-Hasan might with equal
.Â»; regard, be practiced
to-day by a favorite boon-companion upon an
id ruler.
In the court of Haroun-Er-Raschid.
Khaleefeh of Baghdad, dwelt a man
Abu-1-Hasan, and ho was a favorite boon
companion of the Prince of the Faithful,
-chid used to take him as a com
panion when he went to pay the visit of
ceremony to the Lady Zubeydeh, that he
might divert her by his wise and witty
â¢ -sation, for he was both a gifted and
an am rson, endowed with graces
killed in those fascinations by which
- are pleased. And the Lady Zubey
d*Â»h noticed that Abu-1-Hasan. when he
â  â  her pre-ence, regarded with
re her favorite slave-iiirl, her female
.er, and the name of the damsel was
i'uad. And whenever Abu-1
. lot his regard fall upon the slave
...het-el-Fuad cast down her eyes and
i, reciting verses so that the Lady
deb perceived ti:at they were enam
the one of the other, and being mind
â  the brevity of youth <he said to the
I'rince of the Faithful: O my Lord, what
harm if we should marry thy favorite,
Abu-1-Hasan ihe Wap, to my female treas
and Er-Kascbid : 'J'his i-s a cap
â iggestion, for in t:me past he made
:. to me his inclination toward mar
aud 1 promised him a wife that
. I <â  agreeable to him, so I perceive
this wife will be none other than
>>'uzhet-el-Fuad.
So the Prince of the Faithful made Abu
1-Hasan magnificent gifts of gold and jew
els of rare i tion, and tbe lady Zubey
deh bestowed upon Nuzbet-el-Fuad, her
_nrl. a marriage portion such as the
: the daughters of kinas, and
-Hasan transferred his own patri
. that had been his inheritance from
hi- father, upon his mother, and the pair
were married. And they lived together
in the most agreeable existence for the
.-race of one year, during which time they
ived an excellent cook, and ate or the
iehcate viands as they were season
mil devoted the nights to diversion,
eating and drinking and accompanying
their voices on toe lute, enjoying a delight
ful life until their money was gone, and
found themselves possessing not
aught.
And Abu-1-Hasan said: O Nuzhet-el-
Fuad, verily this is a most embarrassing
predicament. Hast thou any suggestions
to offer whereby our discomfort may be
eased? And N izhet-el-Fuad said: O my
lord, can 8 1 thou not represent our need to
the Prince of the Faithful? And he said:
Verily I urn ashamed to do this, for the
- which is 8j > nt was triveu to me by
the Prince of the Faithful, and I desire not
that he should know how soon it is ex
hausted. But 0 -\ izhet-el-Fuad, what
tioth hinder thee from -tating the case to
tbe Lady Zubeydeh? She replied: Omy
lord, this would make me to he abashed
before her, for she granted me liberty to
marry thee, and bestowed upon me a
dowry f>uch as is the marriage portion of
LUghters of kings, an l I desire not
ie should know how quickly it hath
And Abu-1-Hasan meditate*! upon their
case, < nsidering a way out of their embar
:icaiuent, for life â¢â  agreeable
:. And when he had recited
some verses he looked toward Nizhet-el-
Fuad i :: There is for it nothing but
that we must each die, and she said: This
O my 1' rd, I will indeed not do, for I am
Dot] [life. llereplied: I meant
this not save for a jest, for 1 have con
trived a strategem by which we shall ob
tain each a hundred pieces of gold and a
piece oi costly cloth which we shall be aide
I for other fifty pieces. And she said :
Jo what thon dearest, only acquaint me
with ttie strategf-m.
Then Abu-I-llasan said: Spread ihou a
sheet upon the floor and I will Jay myself
it, with my feet toward Mecca," and
my eyes, and do thou tie my toes and
put upon my stomach a knife and a little
:read over me a napkin of silk,
and unfold my turhan over me. Then
dishevel thy hair about thy ears and rend
fhy vest and go lamenting to the Lady
Zutjeydeh, and when she shall inquire of
tliee concerning thy grief gay: May thy
life lonj; survive the life of Abu-1-ftasan
the Wag, for he is dead. Thereupon she
â will mourn for me, and weep, and desire
her female treasurer to give thee a .hun
dred pieces of gold; wherewith to bury me,
ami a piece of told brocade to prepare the
corpse for burial. Then when thou return
est I will lay thee along with thy feet
toward Mecca, and will tie thy toes and I
will ro to the Khaleefeh and say: May thy
head Long survive Xnzhc-t-el-Fuad, for she
is dead. And I will rend my vest, and
tear my beard, whereupon the Khalenfeh
will mourn for thee, and will command his
treasurer to u'ive me a piece of gold bro
cade, a;id a hundred pieces of gold. tl:at I
may prepare thee for burial. And Nuzhet
el-Jraad was lilled with delight, and said:
Truly this is an excellent strategen..
Forthwith she closed his eyes and tied
his toes, and did all that he had told her;
;ifter that she went to the Lady Zubeydeh
shrieking and weeping. When the Lady
Zubeydeh beheld her in this condition she
.said: What is this state in wisich I see
thee, and what has happened unto thee?
Ami Nuzhet-el-Fuad said: O my mistress,
jnay thy life long survive Abu-l-Hasan the
Wag, for he is dead. And the Lady Zubey
deh said : Poor Abu-1-Hasan the Wag, that
agreeable, pleasant man. And she wept
-or nim, and commanded her female treas
urer to give Nuzhet-el-Fuad a hundred
pieces of gold and a piece of gold trocade,
and said: Go prepare his body for burial,
and lie comforted in thy affliction, for I will
take care of thec. And Nuzhet-el-I'uad
too* the pieces of sold and the piece of silk
and departed in a state of joy, and went in
to Abu-1-Hasan and acquainted him with
what had happened to her, upon which he
ar.>se and girded his waist and danced, and
took the gold and the brocade and laid
them up.
Then he laid Nuzhet-el-Fuad along, and
did with her as she had done with him,
alter which he tore his vest. and disordered
his turban and ran swiftly to the Khaleefeh
(where he sat in his hall of judgment),
lamenting and beating his bosom. So the
Khaleefeh said: "What hath befallen thee,
0 Abu-1-Hasan? And he wept, and said :
0 my lord, would that thy boon-com
panion never had been, nor his hour came
to pas?! And the Khaleefeh said: Tell
me. He replied: May thy head long sur
vive, O my lord, Nuzhet-el-Fuad ! And
the Khaleefeh said : There is no deity but
God ! and he struck his hands together.
He then consoled Abu-1-Hasan, and said:
Mourn not, for I -will give thee a wife in
her stead. He then commanded his
treasurer to give Abu-1-Hasan a hundred

: pieces of gold and a piece of gold brocade,
! and said: Go and make a handsome
| funeral for her.
And he took what the Khaleefeb had
i given him and went to his abode joyful,
j and Nnzhet-el-Fnaii rejoiced, and they put
â ' these pieces of irold upon the other and the
! piece of brocade upon the other, and sat
j regarding them and laughing at each other.
But when the Khaleefeh had left his hall
; of judgment he went, in to the Lady Zubey
deh, leaning upon Mesroor, his executioner,
. to console the Lady Zubeydeh for the loss
of her slave-girl. He found her, however,
sitting weeping ana waiting for his arrival
that she might console him for the loss of
Abu-1-Hasan the Wa;. He said to her:
May thy head long survive thy slave-girl,
Nuzhet-el-Fnad! But Bhe replied, O, my
lonl, Allah preserve my slave-girl ! Mayest
though long survive thy boon-companxon,
Abu-1-Hasan the \\ng. And the
Khaleefeh smiled and said to his
eumich, Mosroor, O Mesroor, verily
women arc of little sense. By Allah,
was not Abu-l-llasan just now with me?
I'pon this the Lady Zubeydeh laughed,
â¢ from an angry besom, saying: Have done
thy jesting, "is it not enough that Abu-1
, Hasan the Wag is dead, but thou must
â¢ make roy slave-girl to be dead also, as
I though we had Jost them both? And the
I Khaleefeh replied : Verily Nuzhet-el-Fuad
jis the person who is dead. And the lady
I Zubevdeh said : It is Abu-1-Hasan who is
j dead, and none was with me just now but
Nuzhet-el-Fuad, who was mournin: and
weeping, and 1 exhorted her to have pa
tience, and rave her a hundred pieces of
gold and a piece of silk, and i was waiting
for thee, to comfort thee for the loss of thy
boon-companion, Abu-1-Hasan the Wag.
And the Khaleefeh laughed and said: None
lis dead but Nuzhet-el-Fuad ! And the
| Lady Zubeydeh said: No! No! No! My
1 lord! None is dead but Abu-1-Hasan the
I Wag! But the Khaleefeb became enraged,
: and the vein between his eyes, which was
; remarkable in the members of tl>e family
: of Hashim, throbbed, and he called out to
, Mesroor: Go forth and run to (he house of
I Abu-1-Hasan the Wag, and see which of
j the two is dead. Mesroor therefore went
forth, running. And the Khaleefeh said
!to the lady Zubeydeh : 1 will wager you
I niy Garden of Delights against thy pavil
ion, the Pavilion of the Pictures, that
Nuzhet-el-Fuad is dead. And she said: I
take the wager, and I say that Abu-1-Hasan
the Wag, is dead.
Now, as to Mesroor, he ran without
I ceasing until he entered the by-street
j wherein was the house of Abu-1-Hasan the
i Wag. Abu-1-Hasan was sitting in the
i window, and saw Mesroor running. So he
| paid to Nuzhet-el-Fuad: Probably the
i Khaleefeh, when I left him, hath gone
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
j in to the Lady Zubeydeh to console her,
I and she on his entrance hath arisen to
console him, and hath said: May God
largely compensate thee Tor the loss of
Abu-1-Hasan the "Wag! Whereupon the
Khpleefeh hath said: May thy head long
survive Nuzhet-el-Fuad! And they have
pers:sted in these sayiu-js and have be
come obstinate, and "have laid a wager,
and sent Mesroor to learn who of us is
dead. Do thou, therefore, lay thyself
down, that Mesroor may see thee and go
and inform the Khaleefeh, who will then
believe me. K> Nuzhet-el-Fnad laid her
self alonp, and he covered her face with
her izar, and 10, Mesroor the eunuch en
tered and saluted, and saw her stretched
out. "Whereupon he uncovered her face
and exclaimed: There is no deity but
God ! Our sister, Nuzhet-el-Fuad, is dead !
How speedy was the stroke of fate! May
Allah have mercy upon her and acquit
thee of responsibility !
He then returned and informed the Kha
leefeh of what he had seen, and upon this
the Khaleefeh said to the Lady Zubeydeh:
Thou hast lost, thy pavilion in thy play.
And he laughed at Her and bade Mesroor
relate to her what he had seen, but when
the Lady Zubeydeh Heard the words of Mes
roor she was enraged and cried out: None
is deficient in sense save he wiio bc-lieveth
a slave. And Mesroor was displeased and
said to the Khaleefeh: He spoke truth
who said: Women ore deficient in sense
and religion. Then the Lady Zubeydeh
said: O Prince of the Faithful, thou
jestest with me, and this slave deceiveih
me for the purpose of pleasing thef. But
I will send and see which of them is dead.
The Khaleefeh said: Do so.
So she called an old woman, a kahra
maneh, and said to her: Repair quickly
to the house of Nnzhet-el-Fuad and see
who is dead, and delay not thy return.
And the old woman went, running;. The
Khaleefeh and Mesroor remained, laughing.
And Abu-el-Hasan saw the kabramaneh
enter the street, so he said to Nuzhet-el-
Fuad: 0 Nuzhet-el-Fuad, it seemeth
that the Lady Zubeydeh hath not believed
Mesroor when he said to the Khaleefeh it is |
Ahu-1-Hasan who is dead, and she hath j
sent thither her kahramaneh, to see who I
it is that is dead in this house. Now,
therefore, it is best thai I lie along with ]
my fact toward Mecca, that the old woman j
may see that J :vm dead and the Lady i
Zubeydeh will believe thee. So he laid ;
himself upon the sheet and Nuzhet-el- j
Fuad coveted him and sat at his head |
weeping. And the old woman entered the ;
house and saw Abu-1-Hasan laid out. and
the slave - girl sitting at his head,
weeping und shrieking: See what
hath befallen me! Abu -1 - Hasan
hath died and left me solitary. And
she said to the oid woman: O my mother,
how goou -was ho! The old .voman re
plied : Truly, thou art excusable, for thou
wert become habituated to him, and he
was become habituated to thee. And she
added: But the Khaleefeh and the Lady >
Zubeydeh are perplexed concerning thy !
state, for Mesroor hath told them that j
thou wast dead, and the Lady Zubeydeh
declareth that none is dead" but Abu-1-
Hasan. And Nuzhet-ei-Fuad said: Omy
aunt, I was but just now with my lady
and she saw coy affliction for Abu-1-Hasan,
my husband, and she gave me a hundred
pieces of gold, nnd a piece of silk for the
burial. And s-ee thou. my condition, and
what hath befallen me. Would that I had
died, and that lie had lived. And she
wept, and the old woman wept with her,
and consoled her and went forth from
her, and told the Lady Zubeydeh what
she had seen, and the Lady Zubeydeh
said: Tell it to the Khaleefeh, who hath
believed his arrogant slave, who hath lied,
But Mesroor said: Verily this old woman
lieth, for 1 saw Abu-1-Hasan in good health,
and it was Nuzhet-el-Fuad who was lying |
dead. And the old woman said: It i.s thou !
who liest, and thou desireth to excite a I
quarrel between the Khaleefeh and the
Lady Zubeydeh. Mesroor rejoined: None
lieth but thee, O ill-omened old woman,
and thy lady beiieveth thee, for she is of
disordered mind! And upon this the Lady I
Zubeydeh was enraged, and wept.
Then the Khaleefeh smote hand upon
hand and said: I lie and my eunuch
lieth and thou liest and thy femaie slave
lieth. The right opinion is that we four
Â«o and pee who among us speaketh the
truth. And they all four arose, laying
wagers one with another and quarreling,
the Lady Zubeydeh und the oid woman
with Mesroor and the Khaleefeh and
Mesroor with the Lady Zubeydeh.
And they entered the street wherein was
the house of Abu-1-Hasan the Wag, and
when Abu-1-Hasan saw them he said to
Nuzhet-el-Fuad : Truly, everything that j
is slippery is not a pancake, and not every j
time that the jar is struck doth it escape |
unbroken. It seemeth that the old woman !
hath pone and related her story to the
lady Zubeydeh, and she and Mesroor have
contended" together, and so the Khaleefeh
sndthe Lady Zubeydeh and Mesroor and
ttic old woman have all four come to in
quire respecting our death. Now we will
both feign to be dead, and bandage our
eyes and lav ourselves out, holding our j
breath. And she assented to his proposal.
So they stretched themselves and' held
lir breath. lying with their heads toward
Kibleh, and covered themselves with
nd the Khaleefoh and Zubeydeh and
sroorand the old woman entered and saw i
m iying thus, and the Lady Zubeydeh
pt and said: By their assertions they
re killed my slave-girl, for I imagine I
,t she hath actually died because of her
lessive grief for the death of Abu-1- ;
san the Wag. And the Khaleefeh 1
said : Cease thy talk, for Abu-1-Hasan
came to me with his clothes torn
Id his turban disordered, and striking !
i bosom with two clods, and I gave him j
hundred pieces of gold and a piece of j
i, and promised him another wife in i
; place of Nuzhet-ei-Fuad. But it ap
irs that her loss was to him unsupporta
, so he liath died after her. So I have
n from thee thy wager. But the Lady
ueydeli denied, and between him and
â  there arose a great dispure, and be
;en Mesroor and the old woman.
Mien the Khaleefeh seated himself at
â  head of the two corpses and said : By
i tomb of the prophet of Allah! (may
God bless and save him) and by the tomb's
of my ancestors, if any one wi,uld tell me
Which of them di?d before the other I
wouid give him a thousand pieces of gold.
And upon this Abu-1-Hasan sprang up
and said: It was 1 who died first, 0 Prince
of the Faithful, so give to me the thousand
pieces of gold ami acquit thyself of thine
oath. Then Nuzhet-el-Fuad s^at tip and
arose, and the Khaleefeh and the Lady
fbeydeh rejoiced at their safety, but
beydeh chid her slave-girl, saying:
ou shouldst have appealed to me
and not have tortured my heart in
this manner. Omy mistress, replied
Rzhet-el-Fuad, I was ashamed. But as
the Khaleefeh, he was almost senseless
h laughter, and he said to Abu-l-Hasan :
an hast not ceased to be a wag. Abu-1
san said: 0 Prince of the Faithful,
s strategem I practiced because of the
dissipation of my wealth, for I am not
tenacious of wealth, and since thou hast
given me this slave-girl if I possessed all
thy wealth I should make an end of it.
Tnerefore, I practiced this strategem, by
which I obtained as an alms from thee
this hundred pieces of gold and tlie piece
of silk. And now make haste to give me
the thousand pieces of gold and acquit
thyself of thine oath.
And the Khaleefeh said: Thou re
mindest me that I promised to thee a
salary. So they returned to tlie palace,
and the Khaleefeh gave Abu-1-Hasan the
thousand pieces of gold, saying: Receive
these as a gratuity on account of thy
escape from death. And the Lady Zubey
deh gave to Nuzhet-el-Fuad a thousand
pieces, savins to her the same words. And
the Khaleefeli made Abu-1-Hasan an am
ple allowance and gave him abundant sup
plies, and he ceased not to live with his
wife in the most enjoyable existence until
they were visited by the terminator of de
lights and the separator of friends, the
devastator of palaces and homes and the
replenisher of the graves. Extolieci be the
perfection of him who is everlasting and
who dieth not!
A BAEEPOOTED WEDDING.
A Newspaper Correspondent's Experi
ence in West Virginia.
It is not far from Washington to the
mountains where people live in the most
primitive style. J. C. Moffett, the well
known correspondent, went into McDow
ell County, W. Va., on a professional trip,
and among the stories he did not write,
but preserved for private friends, is one too
good to keep out of print.
He stopped at a log cabin and was soon
on good terms with his host, who after
supper said:
"Stranger, I reckon yo' won't hey a good
time to-night."
"What is up?" queried the newspaper
man.
"Goin' ter be a weddin.' Reckon yo' kin
go with me an' the ole ooman."
The invitation was accepted and the
three started for a five-mile walk over the
mountain. When they reached the cab n
that was the center of festivities, a cracked
fiddle could be heard, and several men
hung around the doors and windows, for
none but the dancers could be admitted
inside.
They were met by a rough mountaineer,
to whom the newspaper man's presence
was explained.
"That's all right," said the newcomer,
"but tbar'a one thing. Yo' see the bride
an' groom air po', very po', an* they never
wore no shoes befo : Christmas in thar
! lives an' hain't, got none now, so them as
had shoes didn't wear 'em. Jim, the
groom, is sorter sensitive like, an' high
strung, so ef yo ; go with them shoes on he
might take it as a reflection on him an'
j the bride an' go to shootin'."
The shoes were taken off and ten min
utes later the correspondent and his host
i were dancing with the mountain belles,
i occasionally having to stop to pick splint-
I era out of their feet. â Washington Star.
LTHE HOSTS OF THE PIONEERS
When the whir of the cable is heard no more
And the lamps on the streets burn pale.
And the mist creeps in from the lonely shore
to the sound of the foghorn's wail,
Then, with muffled tread,
Come the old-time deadâ
The ghosts of the Pioneers.
They come from their graves in the gold-veined mines,
From their graves in the snow-filled glen ;
They come from their graves 'neaththe brooding pinesâ
From the rest that is sweet to men.
Like a phantom host
O'er the bleak, long coast
Come the ghosts of the Pioneers.
They carry the shovel, the pick, the pan,
The ax or the trusted gun;
And the city is reached by the ghostly van
When the clock strikes the hour of one.
Then they form in file
And they wait a while
For the rest of the Pioneers.
Then they march by fours to the haunts of old
Through streets that are new of name;
And the stones are proud, as though made of gold,
'Neath the tread of the men of fame;
And the mist falls down
O'er the silent town
to welcome the pioneers.
as they pass each place of the early days
Each face wears a tender smile;
And each right hand, in saluting, strays
to a brow that is free from guile.
And the old-time light
Shines serene and bright
In the eyes of the Pioneers.
And some men think of the gold they gained,
And some of the gold they lost; ,
And some men think how the soil was stained
By the blood that their conquest cost.
But all are sure
That their lives were pureâ -
The lives of the Pioneers.
And some men dream' of the boyhood's love
They lost when they ventured west;
Of her eyes that dazzled God's skies above,
Of her lips they had never pressed ;
And strong men weep
as they onward sweep
In the ranks of the Pioneers.
And some men sigh as they see the signs
Of the premature decay
Of a town on which God's splendor shines
And the great winds blow alway,
And a tinge of pain
Fills the hearts again
Of the rough old Pioneers.
For they hate to think that a weakened race
Should mar California's breast ;
And the Eastland's petty ways debase
The ways of the mighty West,
And some men frown
At the sleep-drugged town
That heeds not its Pioneers.
For THEY were men to the utmost inch,
ay, men e.ike the ancient greeks;
And they grieve to see their children flinch
While the stern voice of Duty speaks,
And calls them back
to the beaten track
Made clear by the Pioneers.
But 10, in the end, their eyes grow kind,
For the faith in their hearts is vast:
And they know that although some men are blind
They will fight for the right at last,
And speech will come
to men now dumbâ
The speech of true Pioneers.
And a vision comes to uplift each man
Of the things that HAVE to beâ
The mighty Westland in the van
With a voice like the thunderous sea
And the mark of God
Upon each sod
Beloved of the Pioneers.
And a race of great-souled men and maidsâ
a thousand fineâ pure gold ;
And fruits and flocks, in fields and glades,
And land, unbought, unsold.
"God speed the day,"
is what they prayâ
The prayer of the Pioneers.
Not a street nor an alley but feels them pass
On their lonely, but much-loved round;
Like the fading film on the face of a glass
They defile without halt or sound.
And the stray curs peer
Through the fog in fear
At the ghosts of the Pioneers.
And when, in the East, the gray-eyed dawn
First sings to each passionless hill,
And the city's life is again reborn,
And the foghorn's voice is still,
Then back to their doom
In the lands of gloom
Pass the ghosts of the Pioneers.

Financial Worry and Physical Exer-
tion Not the Greatest Destroyer
of Human Life.
For Humanity's Sake, After Thirty-Six Year*
of Nerve-Creeping Slavery, He Tells
How He Was et Free.
OALDWELL, N. J., Jan. One of our
prominent citizens, S. J. Gould, who has
suffered terribly from tobacco treruens,
has, in behalf of humanity, made known
his frightful experience. In his written
statement, which is attracting widespread
attention, he says: "I commenced using
tobacco at thirteen. lam now forty-nine,
so for thirty-six years 1 chewed, smoked,
snuffed and rubbed snuff till my skin
turned a tobacco-brown and cold, sticky
perspiration oozed from my skin anil
trickled down my back at the least exer-
tion or excitement. My norre, vigor and
my life were being slowly sapped. ' I made
up my mind that I had to quit tobacco or
die. I tried to stop tobacco time and
again, but could not. I saw doable and
my memory was beyond control, but I still
knew how to chew and smoke, which I did
all day until toward night, when my sys-
tem got tobacco-soaked again. Finally I
cave up in despair, as I thought that I
could not cure myself.
"Now, for suffering humanity, I'll tell
what saved my life. Providence evidcutlv
answered my good wife 9 prayers and
brought to her attention a booklet called
'Don't Tobacco 6pit and Smoke Your Life
Away What a sermon and warning in
these words! Just what I was doing. It
told about a guaranteed cure for the to-
bacco habit called No-To-Bac. I sent to
Druggist Hasler for a box. Without a
grain of faith I spat out my tobacco cud
and put into my mouth a little tablet
upon which was stamped No-To-Bac. I
know it sounds like a lie when I tell you
that. 1 took eight tablets the lirst day,
seven the next, five the third day, and all
the nerve-creeping feeling, restlessness and
mental depression was gone. It was too
good to be true. It seemed like a dream.
I used one box. It cost me $1, and it is
worth a thousand. I gained ten pounds
in weight and lost all desire for tobacco
from the first day. I sleep and eat well,
and I have been benefited in more ways
than I can tell.
"I tirmly believe No-To-Bac will cure
any case of tobacco-using if faithfully
tried, and there are thousands of tobacco
slaves who ought to know how easy it is to
get free. There's happiness in No-To-Bac
for the prematurely old men who think as
I did that they are old and worn out,
when tobacco is the thine that destroys
their vitality and manhood."
"The public should be warned, however,
against the purchase of any of the many
imitations on the market, as the success of
No-To-Bac has brought forth a host of
counterfeiters and imitators. The genuine
No-To-Bac is made by The Sterling Rem-
edy Co.. Chicago, Montreal and New York,
and sold under a guarantee to cure by all
druggists, and every tablet has the word,
No-To-Bac plainly stamped thereon. You,
run no physical or financial risk in pur-
chasing the genuine article."

A LIVELY YEAE.
With the leisure and rest of to-day the
holiday season comes to an end and to-
morrow we begin the work of the year.
All signs known to man from the way the
cuckoo calls to the way the jingo exults
give promise of lively times. It will be a
year of emergencies and ultimatums, of
fights and frolics, of festivals and reforms,
of reviving business and depressed bosses,
and above all a year of the most exciting
Presidential election we have had since
1860.
The election, of course, will be the
salient characteristic of the year. Both
the great parties are in a position to produce
startling surprises. The Republicans have
fort}' candidates for the Presidency and
the Democrats have forty factions for
everything. In each National Convention
there will be sufficient music in the air to
thrill the whole continent. The great
campaign of 1860 when there were four
Presidential candidates with complete
party tickets in the field will be eclipsed.
We shall probably see at loaÂ»t half a dozen
this year and torchlight processions will
be so common that the City will be saved
the expense of lighting lamps to illumi
nate the town.
Next to the Presidential elections will be
the California carnivals. We have had ;
three festivals already, and the year is
not yet a week old. Before the spring time ;
has passed we shall have beauty and gay- j
ety enough to make California a State of ;
beatitude and everybody in it glorified.
Ban Francisco may not hold a carnival,
but she will be in a position to reach a
dozen without trouble, and have no lack
of opportunity to dance while other folks
pay the piper. In these rejoicings we shall
get ready for the elections that come later,
and no matter how many candidates may '
be in the rield, every one of them will be
able to get a floral tloat to serve him as a
campaign wagon.
All through the season of festivals and
tbrough the political campaign to a glori
ons triumph on election day will go the
joint movement of reviving business and
municipal reform. These forces are in
alliance and cannot be separated. This is :
true in every community and especially so
in San Francisco. To improve the busi
ness of this City we must improve the
City itself. To this conclusion every re
flecting business man has lone since come,
and now tlio time has arrived tojx-iss from :
reflection to action. Business will revive
in proportion aÂ° the bosses are depressed,
and it is the determination of the people
that San Francisco shall go forward.
In all the processions of the year those
will be best that hold a straight course.
Straight politics will win in the elections,
straight festivals will have the best parades,
straight business will make the most
money and straight reform will get there
first. All that any man has to do t''is
year is to go straight and ail will be well
With him when Thanksgiving day comes i
round. He can dance at ttie carnivals, j
carry torchlights in the processions, do
business, right bosses and in all the liveli
ness of the times be fully alive without
fear of being lost in the shuffle. Certainly
the year is one we can look forward to
with pleasure, expecting great things of it.
It will not be the year of jubilee, but it is
one year nearer than last year was.
OAMINETTI AND THE PUNDING
BILL.
Among the men who are to ero to Wash
ington as representatives of tlie Commit
tee of Fifty to light the funding bill, ex-
Congressman Caminetti should be in
cluded, if possible.
His experience in the last House of
Representatives when the railroad at
tempted to pass the Reilly funding bill
would be valuable in righting the new
funding bill at this session. He was in
the fight from beginning to end, is posted
on the methods cf the opposition, has
helped to meet and overcome them, and was
prominent and energetic in the first great
fight won by the people in Congress
against railroad aggression.
He has studied the problem in all its
bearings, has an extended acquaintance in
the two houses of Congress and in the
various departments, all of which would
be of great assistance in this emergency.
He introduced various measures bearing
on this question, and succeeded in getting
the attention of the Secretary of the In
terior, as is shown by his annual report
recently submitted.
We do not kno-.v whether Mr. Caminetti's
engagements would permit him to go to
Washington on so sudden a call, but the
effort to obtain his ?ervices for the State
is well worth making.
STEAUGE LOCAL CONDITIONS.
The people of Fresno County are hold
ing a splendid citrus fair, in which are dis
played oranges and lemons grown in what
is called the "thermal belt" of the county.
This calls to mind an extraordinary fact
which constitutes one of the peculiarities
of California, and which has never been
investigated with scientific thoroughness.
It is the existence of "thermal belts" here
and there throughout the State, in which
the climatological conditions are different
from those of the surrounding region.
There is one in San Francisco. It
stretches through the Mission and gives
rise to a climate so radically different from
that say of the Presidio Heights as to ex
cite wonder. Again, one may often look
across the Golden Gate channel from the
heights of the City at the sunshine which
bathes Sausalito while the City is wrapped
in fop. A most remarkable phenomenon
exists at the lower extremity of Clfar Lake.
Here is found an extensive deposit of sul
phur overlying cinnabar, and the heat is
very great. A warm belt extends from
Los Gatos to Saratoga, in the western foot-
hills of Santa Clara County, and there
oranges do fairly well. Numberless other
similar instances exist throughout the
State.
In some cases the cause of the phenom
enon is clearly apparent. The northern
extremities of Napa and Sonoma counties
and the southern end of Lake County em
brace a region of comparatively recent vol
canic activity. In that region hot springs
and steam-spouting vents are common,
and at intervals are found issues of gns.
The latter are forms of eolfataras. The
high temperature of the sulphur bank of
Lake County is explainable on this
ground. It is the evidence of flying vol
canic forces.
The so-called warm belts are likely
ascribable to meteorologfcal peculiarities.
The basis of them all is the constancy of
the direction of our winds. Permanent
atmospheric drifts are thus established.
In some cases the cool wind from the
ocean is heated by passing over an area
warmed by the sun, the soil in such in-
stances having the power to retain the
heat of the day and give it out at night,
when it is taken up by the gentle brepze
and carried along a course which is thus
transformed into a warm belt, where semi
tropical fruits are safe from frost.
Trees also have au effect, and hence for
ests are a prominent factor. Again, water
exerts an influence. Thus, liichardsons
Bay, a larg? and shallow arm of the bay
of San Francisco, is made warmer than
the deeper parts, with the result tbat Sau
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896
salito and Belvedere have climates strik
ingly unlike that of San Francisco, and
this condition is aided by mountains in
tervening between the towns and the
ocean. These strange facts constitute one
of the wonders of the State and they have
never been adequately studied.
A GLITTERING PALACE.
The ice carnival has opened at Truckee
with glorious weather, and as the railroad
company has made a considerable reduc
tion in rates and offered to furnish sleep
ing-cars for the use of excursionists while
staying at Truckee, we may soon expect
large numbers of coast residents to seek
the delights which this unique affair pre
sents. With the most ordinary precau
tions as to clothing, those accustomed to
the bland climate of the coast need have
no fear on the score of the change to a
creat elevation and extreme cold. The al
titude is not sufficiently great to create the
least danger or discomfort, but is great
enough to make possible the pleasures ap
pertaining to cold.
Although Dormer Lake has not yet frozen
over, there is plenty of time for that before
the carnival closes; and as for skating, it
can be found on the extensive ice ponds
which abound thereabout, and besides
there is a large rink within the frost pal
ace, where skilled attendants will be on
hand. Sleighing and tobogganing facil
ities are ample.
The railroad company seems to assume
that most of the excursionists will prefer
to make the trip both ways in the night.
'] I i is overlooking the fact that the
day trip is one of the finest in the State.
The level plains of the Sacramento Valley
are. then seen, and the tortuous winding
of the road through the foothills and
mountains in its laborious climb to the
summ it of the Sierras reveals a constantly
changing panorama of wonders and
beauties. In the vicinity of Gold Hill are
the great desolate fields of the old
hydraulic gold mines; Auburn appears
nestled in the upper foothills surrounded
by orange groves; from Cape Horn one
looks far down upon the shining thread
like waters of the American River, and
then come stupendous mountains with dae
zling fields of snow. In this short trip to
Truckee one may see the best of the natu
ral wonders which have made this route
across the continent famous.
The people of Truckee may be depended
en for an exhibition of that hearty spirit
of hospitality which belongs peculiarly to
California. They have the strength,
rugged ness and freedom characteristic of
their splendid environment- of mountains,
and a.- they are familiar with all the way;;
in which wholesome sport may be ex
tracted from cold weather their guidance
will be as useful as it will be freely given.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A. J. Fisk, the noted Montana editor, is at
the Grand. Mr. Pisk is one of four brothers
who ove r two decades ago went to Helena and
started tho Herald.
The paper occupied the evening field and was
a success from its start. Probably no other
journal on that parallel between the Pacific
Ocean and the Missouri River has approached
it in money-making.
Mr. Fisk is as widely known as his paper. He
has been a powerful factor in developing the
resources of Montana, getting it admitted to
the Union as a State and assisting it to take a
front rank in the galaxy of States.
The Fisk brothers are relatives of the lete

â ** 414, 416 and .418 Front St., S. F.The appointment of Alfred Austin to the
poet laureateship of England has caused
some surprise in American literary cir
cles, and even in the ''tight little island
over the sea" it was certainly not widely
anticipated that the distinguished honor
would be conferred on Mr. Austin. 6ther
I wore freely mentioned, and it now j
- -i range that Austin should not have '
been considered quite early among the
prominent possibilities. If poetical genius
were the real test in the selection of a
b laureate, no one would dispute the j
claim of Algernon Charles Swinburne to j
the title, ior he is estimated the best
rhythmist of the day, and the ablest critics
ede that mapy of Swinburne's lyrics
compare for strength of expression and j
essof rhythm tot; bappy
strains in the language. But Swinburne's
muse is of the "unbridled" kind; moralists
have condemned much of his passionate ,
early verse; and, again, the royal family
rely the keen thrusts of Swin- \
s saber. While ii is true that this;

The gap ihai he I* ft warn he reefcil and dropiea;

Many a fez In the mud was crushed.
Many a throat that cheered was hushed.

Over theirÂ«arpses the llv ng sprung.
And the ridci' with their musket-rattle rang,
Till the faces thui lined the last rvdotibt
Could see their faces and hear their shout.
In the redoubt a fair form towered,

An insight into the feelings and senti
ment of the new poet laureate is furnished
in his poem, "Is Life Worth Living?"
The iast two stanzas are reproduced be
low. The first of these stanzas is brim full
of human sympathy. The concluding one
affords a fair example of Austin's patriotic
expression :
Is life wor.h living? Yes. so long
As there is wrong to rl^h:
Wall of the weak against the btronj
Or tyrannj- to fi h<;
Long as there lingers frloom to chase,
Or streamlÃs; tear to dry.
One kindred woe, one Borrowing face
That smiles as we draw nigh;
Long as a laleol angnish swells
The hart, and lids grow wet.

MACAIRE.
Theannouncement of a drama by Robert
Louis BteveDÃOn and William Ernest Hea
ley aroused a good deal of public interest.
Stevenson was one of the few English
writers of recent years from whom strong
dramatic work was to be expected. His
ability to develop exciting plots, produce
thrilling scenes, create vigorous men and
women and express their thoughts and
emotions in stirring language had been
too often and too forcibly shown in novel*
ior any one to doubt that ho might achieve
a marked success as a dramatist. The
public, therefore, expected of him some
thing more than an ordinary play, and
the appearance of his work was awaited
with eagerness.
The publication of the play has row
oef-n ruade and a disappointment await
every reader of h. It bears the title "Ma
caire, and is announced as a "melodra
mauc farce." The phmse is something of
b Â»Â«rdity. and yet it accurately de
scribes the work. We have all the light

ness, flippancy and improbability of a fare
in the first two acts, and then a sudden
change to the terrors and tragedies of
melodrama in the third act. This gro
> tesque combination shows something of
! Stevenson's genius in conception, but evi
dently it has been worked out by a weaker
band* than his. Instead of the comedy
I growing up by decrees into the melodrama
! me two i arts remain quite distinct. There
l^ nothing in the comic parts that even sug
gests the tragedy that follows, and the re
stilt is so incongruous as to be wholly out
of the domain of art and an absurdity' pure
and simple.
The play is as faulty in detail as in con
struction. The action is not lively, the sit
uations are not novel, the talk is not
bright in the comic portions nor intense
in the tragic. In scarcely a single passage
is there any trace of that vivid and im
pressive style of which Stevenson was so
complete a master. It would be easy to
find in any of his novels conversations far
more dramatic and more brilliant than
any that occur in this avowedly dramatic \
work. It would seem that Stevenson may
have conceived the bold idea of blending
a farce with a melodrama, but in the
weakness of his last days was unable to
carry it out, and therefore made it a part
nership work with Mr. Hawley, ?nd ieft
to that gentleman the task of completing
the design.
About the only interest that can be
taken in the work will grow out of the
question it will raise as to the possiDility
of successfully combining farce and melo
drama on the#sta;:e. Shakespeare did not j
hesitate to introduce comic elements into j
his tragedies, but he never made any one ;
Character both tragic and comic. It is !
Mercutio who makes the jest and it is
Romeo who kills himself. Macaire, how
ever, is both the jorter and the murderer.
He plays icr two acts the light villainy of
a roKue in a comic opera, and then reap
pears as the murderous scoundrel of melo
drama. There are certainly wonderful
possibilities in the development of a 'har
â >f that kind and it yet maybe suc
cessfully portrayed on the stage. It has
not been well done in this instance, but,
perhaps, Stevenson's conception may yet
oe taken up by a master dramatist and a
melodramatic farce become one of the tri
umphs oi our ti eater.
NAPOLEON IN THE FIELD.
The admirable celerity and accuracy of
Napoleon's movements in the held were
'due to the excellent arrangements by
which they were made, say- Sloane in his
".Life of Napoleon" in the January Cen
tury. His two inseparable companions
were tiie Grand Marshal Duroc and Cau
laincourt, master <>t the h >r>e.
The latter had always the map of the
country through which they were driving
or riding ready for instant use. The seats
of :he imperial carriage could be Converted
into a couch for the Emperor'a frequent
night jonrneys, but ordinarily Bert bier
and Marat took turns at sitting at his Bide,
while Caulaincourt rode cioae beside the
door.
Behind, anJ as near the wheels as possi
ble, rode seven adjutants, fourte m ord
nance otticers and lour pages, who must
be ready on the in*tnnt to receive and
carry orders. Two of the officers must be
familiar with the speech of the country.
Kustan, his K.yptian body servant, rode
with them. There were also two mounted
lackeys, each carrying maps, papers and
writing materials.
This escort was protected by a body of
mounted cha^eurs. In case the Emperor
alighted for any purpose, four of these
instantly did likewise, and, surrounding
him with fixed bayonets, or loaded pistols
pointed outward to the four points of the
compass, preserved this relative position
as he moved.
Last of all came the grooms with extra
horses; for the Emperor's personal use
there were from seven to nine. These
were substantially the arrangements still
in vogue during the Prussian campaign.
Thereafter his distrust of those about him
gradually increased, until toward the end
of . is career it became acute, and then, as
a consequence, the numbers of his suite
wer<Â» much diminished.
Whenever there was need of post-haste
the Emperor found relays of nine saddle
horses or six carriajje-horso\Â« prr-pared at
intervals of from seven to ten miles aleag
his route. In this way he often journeyed

at the rate of fourteen miles an hour for
six hours at a time. Similararrangements
on a much smaller scale were made for the
sk'ff- This body was under tho indispens
able Berthier, and was so numerousas to
be practically capable of subdivision into
several. In 1800 there were thirteen adju
tants, three heads of departments with iive
adjutants, thirty-one siaff officers and
thirty engineers. Under the chief of ar
tillery was a personal staff of eighteen offi
cers, under the chief of engineers one of
nineteen, and under the commissary-gen
eral one of forty-three. Arriving at his
night quarters the Emperorfound hisoflice
ready â a tent or room with live tables, one
in the center for himself and one at each
corner for his private secretaries. On his
own was a map, dotted with colored pins
which marked the position of every body \
of his troops. In this campaign lie had
the only one in existence, prepared long in
advance by his own orders.
It is significant of the Prussian over
| confidence and BUpineness that they had |
I none.^ As soon as possible was arranged j
I the Emperor's bedchamber, across the i
! door of which Rustan slept, and adjoining i
it was another for the officers on duty.
Dinner occupied less than twenty minutes,
for in the field Napoleon ate little and that I
rapidly. By 7 in the evening he was
asleep.
At 1 in the morning the commander-in
chief arose, entered his ofiice, where the
secretaries were already at work, found all
reports from the divisions ready at his
hand, and then, pacing the floor, dictated
his dispatches and the orders for the com
ing day. There is an accepted tradition
that ho often simultaneously composed
and uttered in alternate sentences two dif
ferent letters, so that two secretaries were
busy at the same time in writing papers on
different topics. The orders when com
pleted and revised wore handed to Berthier.
By 3 in the morning they were on their
way, and reaciied the separate corps fresh
from headquarters just before the soldiers
set out on their march. It was by such
perfect machinery that accuracy in both
command and obedience was assured.
1,1 FK AT SHUT-IN VALLEY.
This is a volume oi sketches of Pacific
Coast life, by Clara Spalding Brown,
whose name will be familiar to many, as
Mrs. Brown has been quite a prolific
writer for the periodicals of late vcars.
There are twelve sketches in the present
volume, most of them dealing with the
sensations and experiences of women
transported from the East to ranch life in
California and Arizona. Tbere is a good
deal of homely truth in many of the tales,
and they are not lacking in a certain hope
ful note which sounds pleasantly through
what might otherwise l>e the unrelieved
pessimism of the author's view. Clara
Spalding Brown is not a finished writ'-r.
Nowhere does her work reacu any artistir
height, but it is wholesome and not with
out interest. In point of construction
perhaps the best sketch in the collection is
"The Schoohna'am of Mineral Hill." The
stories nearly all have to do with mining
life, and there is a touch of realism about
them that will appeal to many women of
the Pacific Coast who have' tajred the
doubtful sweet? of pioneer existence.
The mechanical part of the book leaves
much to be desired. It might have been
more attractive in shape. [Columbus,

HISTORY OF THE JEWS.
This is the fifth volume of Professor
Graetz's celebrated work, and is in many
respects the most important of the whole
series issued by the Jewish Publication
Society of Philadelphia. It is translated
from the German, though it appears to be
a curious oversight that in no part of the
present work is the name of the trans
lator put forward.
What the late John Richard Green was
to the English people Graetz is to the He
brews. His work exhibits a profundity of
thought and a depth of insight that is
trnly remarkable. Yet the author of the
"History of the Jews" has not endeavored
to act the part of an interpreter for his
people in the same manner as has Ernest
Renan. Professor Graetz rather exhibits
to the world his analytical powers, and
does not appear to be swayed to any great
extent by his natural sympathies.
The present volume opens with some ac
count of the persecution to which the
Jews were subjected in Poland by the
CosÂ«aoks. The characteristics of the Gen
tile Pole and the Hebrew are touched
upon, and a minute description is given
of the ritual part of the faith as it is prac
ticed in the land of the Czar.
As is well known, tnere exists no coun
try in the world where the subtleties of
Talrnudical lore are so often brought into
requisition as in Poland. It would of
necessity be so, in a country overrun by
the spies and hirelings of what is virtually
a foreign Government. Here one would
expect to find the Maggid holding in his
hand the scepter of dominion over the
house of Jacob, adjudicating between a
man and his neighbor, righting wrongs,
and even deciding upon what would ap
pear trivial matters to the occidental
Hebrew. With great force Professor
Graetz puts forward his reasons why the
study of the Talmud was so cultivated in
Poland, and why everything was, as it
were, regarded from a Talmudieal point
of view. And the present-day student is
bound to acknowledge the learned his
torian's remark, "Thus religion sank, not
merely, as among Jews of other countries,
to a mechanical, unintelligent ceremonial,'
but tv a subtle art of interpretation," as
equally correct of the Polish Jew's studies
at the present day.
The settlement' of the Jews in England
during the protectorate of Oliver Crom
well is admirably discussed, and here is
introduced a vast quantity of matter hav
ing reference to the Spanish and Portu
guese Hebrews (Sephardim). Starting
with Manaspeh Ren Israel and his services
to Dutch and English Judea the author
touches upon the life and work of that
master of philosophy, Baruch Spinoza. It
is astonishing to learn that his alleged
apostasy was discovered through nis non
attendance at synagogue. And so much
w;ts the power of his philosophy feared

that he was offered an annual pension ]
conditional upon his undertaking not to j
carry on an active crusade against the j
powers that were. It is gratifying j
that bribes availed nothing and as a con- j
sequence the advocate of free thought was
put under the ban, all persons being for
biiiden to have any communication with
lnni. A strange fact, remarked by Pro
fessor Graetz, is that "against his will he
(Spinoza) has contributed to the giory or
the race which he so unjustly reviled."
Passing over several chapters devoted to
the Jews in Germany, in Spain and in Por
tugal, considerable attention is paid to
their condition in France between the
years 1791-1805. Concerning the French
revolution, Professor Graetz makes use of
the following remarkably language:
The revolution was a judgment which 1n one
day atoned for the sins of a thousand years,
and which hurled into the dust all wlio, at the
expense of justice and religion, had created
new grades of society. â¢ * * l"or the Jews,
too, the moat abject and despised people In
European society, the day of redemption and
liberty was to dawn after their long slavery
among the nations of Europe. â¦ â¢ * What
Mendelssohn had thought possible at some dis
tant time â¢ â¢ * was realized in France with
almost magical rapidity.
It is interesting to note that to France
the world owes tnat clause which linds a
place in the constitution of every civilized
country, th.it "No one shall be' molested
on account of his religious opinions, in so
far as their outward expression does not
disturb public order as established by
law."
The Damascus P.lood Accusation and
its terrible consequences to Hebrews in
the far East is elaborately and minutely
reported. The historian records the step's
that were taken by the British Govern
ment through Lord Palmorston toward
obtaining the freedom of the poor unfor
tunates, and how the Jate Sir Moses Mon
tefiore traveled to Damascus as the repre
sentative of England, linancially backed by
thA Rothschilds.
The last chapter in the fifth volume is
devoted to a review of the rise and prog
ress of reform Judaism, of its birth in Ger
many and its transplantation to the
Unitrd States.
It is with regret that the reader lays
down Professor GraeU's valuable contribu
tion to history, and it is with regret, too,
that the author abandons his pen after
completing his task. It is probably this
idea wnich induced him to add a "retro
spect," at the end of which sounds a last
triumphant note for the cause of the
Hebrewâ *'ln any case, the Jewish nation
is an extraordinary phenomenon, dating
as it does from hoary antiquity, but pos
sessing youthful vigor, having passed
through numberless vicissitudes, yet re
maining ever true to itself." [Philadel

CJrover'n "Alcazar.
Monday will see the first performance
of the French farce-comedy "My Precious
Baby" at Grover's Alcazar.
The story, which is full of comical situa
tions, hinges on the fact that Mr. and Mrs.
BirkeU have a son, Adolphus, who has
been brought up at his mamma's apron
strings, and is still regarded as the
precious baby. With advancing years the
baby takes to the wild ways of youth, and
commences the process of sewing his wild
oats.
The disorders into which the baby falls
with the aid of his tutor and the complica
tions which are brought about through

Oraiul Opern-House.
An old-time English drama, "The Fugi
tive," will be produced at the Grand to
morrow night. It was written by the
veteran playwright Tom Craven, and from
the time of its original production at the
Adelphi Theater in Londonâ where it had
a record runâ the play has been popular.
Its story is of middle class English life in
the eighteenth century, and the plot con
tains strong situations as well as comic
ones. In many respects the drama is the
best of the many productionsof its author.
There is plenty of scope for scenic effect
in "The Fugitive," which Morosco's artists
will take advantage of. Particularly does
this apply to a sea scene in which a ship
wrtck and the hero's rescue occur. The
title role is to be played by H. Coulter
Brinker.

The second edition of the mythological

WORK THA.T PAYS.
Mrs. Kyley and Miss Stone Arc Drawine
Handsome Incomes From I'lays. ' : :.
Play-writing is a profitable profession
: and one in the benefits of which women
i are coming to take their share. It re
quires unswerving effort and a large al
lowance of patience to win success in
writing for the stage, but the artistic
and financial returns are well worth wait
ing and striving for. This is the unani
mous verdict of the women who recently I
; have made admirable additions to dra
i matic literature.
One must hope and study and never ,
â  cense from endeavoring, says Miss Mary j
: Stone, whose dramatization of "A Social
Highwayman" has given her a familiar
name with the theater-going public.
To write a. good play you must have a j
: professional knowledge of the stage, adds i
Mrs. Madeline Lucette Ryley, author of I
that phenomenal little comedy; "Christo
pher Jr." These two clever pen-women
! agree on another important point, namely,
that twelve months' hard work is not a
j bit too much effort to put into a r/lay,
j whether it .be a tragedy or comedy, and
quite as emphatically do both of them de
j clare that the production of a play need
not be the result of inspiration. Every
morning, whether moved by the desire or
no, Mrs. Ryley goes like a'well regulated
business woman to the. desk and there, for
so many hours, she painstakingly and per
sistently composes, until stern discipline
prevails over rebellious brains that settle
| at last to the task in -hand and the happy
; faculty and interest is gained.
, J "My own method," explains Miss btone,
; ! "is simple enough. After 11 o'clock in
, : the evening I get at my desk from then
until 3 o'clock in the morning, and am
i busy getting up what you may call in
: spiration. and writing steadily. I never
i set pen to paper, however, until act,
. | scenes and the major portion of the
dialogue is mapped out clearly in my mind,
', â¢ and, though I've not had "any personal
i connection with the theater, I have
' always, since my earliest youth, studied
, i plays and stage methods a*s faithfully as
' ; an actress from my orchestra chair.
[ I "That knowledge," continued Miss
i Stone, "is simply indispensable and I
\ j practiced first at dramatizing the stories
| I found in books, which is at once
' I very ditiicuit and seemingly easy work.
' After abundant and fruitless writing
j I failed to hit the mark until with a play
, made from Stanley Weyman's 'House of
, the Woli' I earned the notice of a well
; ! known actor, and 'A Social Highwayman'
i ! was put into my hand for adaptation. j
I Now I am at work on a comedy of Ameri
i can life in plot and treatment ail my own,
I and though it has taken years, of course,
j to work up this far in profession, once
, ! the successful vein is reached the return is
j j the richest and readiest a woman can earn.
Once on the stage and attracting good
j audiences one's play literally becomes a
i little automatic money machine, earnintr
j its author's income weekly at the rate of 5 !
; ; per cent on the receipts in a way the most j
popular book can never do."
I It required Jive years of waiting, re
| writing, disappointment and renewed
â  hopes alternating for Mrs. Ryley to per- '
! suade her manager that. "Christopher Jr." j
was at length worth public approval. The |
I five years had been preceded by many I
j others of rather fruitless pen work, and j
j by all the laws governing human nature |
this seemingly would-be dramatist ought :
long ago to have relinquished her am- j
bitions; but since the placing of "Christ- i
opher Jr." have come flattering offers from |
actors and managers to contract for plays, j
Already an elaborate historical drama of :
Richard Savage's life and a comedy of !
American society have been arranged for
production by Mr. Goodwin, and Mrs.
Ryley agrees with Miss Stone that the
woman is yet to appear who will write a
great tragedy, though the highest fame
and n golden fortune await her arrival.â

"Was She Keally Angry?
Miss Katherine ('trey, who played here
last season with the Frawley Company,
was dreadfully put out when she discovered
the other day that the American Baptists
had issued a book entitled "The Tempta
tion of Katherine Grey." She looked upon
the title as a personal insult. Although
"The Temptation of Katherine Grey"
proved to be nothing more than a "power
erful novel" that had nothing whatever to
do with the stage, sue felt that she was too
well known to permit it to pass unnoticed.
â¢She consulted lawyers, and finallyâ ah,
here's the rub!â landed at the olh'cp of her
press agent. This far-seeing gentleman
did not view the matter as an undiluted
calamity. The motto of the press agent is :
"Any mention is better than no mention at
all," and he told Miss Grey that there was
no reason why she should be so agitated;
that, in fact, the book could not possibly
do her any harm whatever.

A newspaper correspondent writing from
Brighton, England, says that Mary Ander
son de Navarro has become almost an in
valid. She is said to have changed from
the slender woman of yore to matronly
proportions.
Hubert Herkomer, the distinguished
English artist, suggests that the proscen

that there may bo a different sized frame
for a scene representing a garret from that
used for an out-of-door picture.
Sarah Bernhardt has turned on the tap

coming over again, and she is not ashamed
of it. She is due at Abbey's Theater this

A curious coincidence occurred while

DID NOT SIGN HIS NAME.
And So He Was Assaulted by
Train Officials, Says M.
C. Meeker.
Interesting Question in a Big Damage
Suit Against the Southern
Pacific.
A question that will be of intrrest to
travelers and ticket agents is involved in
the courts at Portland, in the suit
begun last week by MortC. Meeker against
the Southern Pacific for $10,000 damages
for injuries sustained in being put off the
train at Benicia on the 16th of last month.
The case will be fought largely over the
question whether Meeker was justified in
refusing to sign his name for a conductor,
who doubted that he was riding on his
own ticket.
Meeker, who is in town, spoke of his
case yesterday at the Baldwin :
"The facts of the case are these," he
said. "I purchased a ticket about No
vember 'JO for Kansas City providing for
transportation to Los Angeles and from
there to Portland by way of San Fran
cisco. The only conditions on the ticket
as to sien ing required that at the rethrn
destination, Los Angeles, I should be
identified by writing my signature on the
hack of the ticket. This 1 complied witli
an.i I had no trouble with the ticket until
after I left San Francisco for Portland. On
the Benicia ferry the conductor asked me
to sign my name on a card. I tola him
that my ticket did not require that and re
fused. I told him that if he could show
me that them was anything in the con
tract in the ticket requiring me to sign I
would so. The conductor finally took up
my ticket, giving me a claim check for it.
Later while I was in one of the day
coaches the conductor again appeared ac
comDanied by a companion, who the
conductor said was an agent, of the road,
demanding that I sign my name. I aeain
refused.
"I refused also to give up my claim check
without the return of the ticket. No
t sooner was this done than the bully
I grabbed me by the collar, and said: 'Get
I off the train, or I'll throw you off.' Just
then the conductor also took hold of me,
and the two yanked me about and threw
i me over the arm of the seat. â¢ The passen
| gers in the car then interfered, remon
| stratinir against such brutality, and calling
out for fair piay and not to allow two men
to jump on one. They finally desisted,
but as a result of the rough treatment my
! right thigh has been badly twisted and my
j back severely wrenched.' '
i Meeker stated tliat he had been confined
! to a hospital for several days after his ar
i rival in Portland and is still lame. George
j H. Williams," who wast Attorncv-General
in President Grant's Cabinet, is his attor-
I ney in the case. Meeker states that the
j only question will be the amount of dam
! ages. â

PLANS FOR THE OLD HALL
Architect Shea's General In
structions for Compet
itors.
BUILDINGS TO BE FIREPROOF.
The Total Cost to Be Not Over $295,.
000â Party Walls to Be Removed
at Once.
The fortunate architect whose plans
meet with the approval of the Municipal
Buildings Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors will be employed to supervise the
construction of the buildings which the
City is preparing to erect on the site of the
old City Hall.
The committee, represented by Messrs.
Benjamin, Wagner and King, held a
meeting yesterday, at which Architect
Shea of the new City Hall was in attend
ance to present the general instructions to
men of his profession, which had been
asked by the committee.
After looking over and approving the
instructions the committee decided to ad
vertise for bids during the present week.
In order to bring as many architects as
possible into the competition, the sujzges
tion of Mr. Shea that three prizes, in addi
tion to the position of supervising archi- '
tect. be given, was adopted, and the second
best plan submitted will entitle the de- i
signer to $750, third best to $500 and fourth
best to $250.
The plans will provide for two buildings,
one where the old City Hall stood and i
the other on the site which the Morgue ;
now occupies. Both are to be fireproof,
the main building to be four stories and a J
basement and the smaller two stories.
In the hall proper will be accommoda- !

Chairman Benjamin stated that he had
been unable to ascertain that the board
had ever given the owners of buildings
adjoining the City property on Washing
ton street permission to use walls abutting
on their structures as party walls, and
that as one of these walls encroaches on
the lot it should, in his opinion, come
down whether t:.e property-owners like it
or not.
It was decided on this showing to in
struct the contractor who obtained the
work of removing the old buildings to re
move the wall at once that the matter of
clearing up the lot may be carried out at
the earliest possible moment. It is not
improbable that the committee or the con
tractor will get, into a legal entanglement
over these instructions if carried out, for
an engineer who recently examined the
structure in question reported that through
age and setthnc the building was not as
secure as it might be, and that if the so
called party wall was removed the side of
the house might fall out and thus destroy
the entire structure.
Copies of the instructions will be fur
nished to aspirins architects by the Board
of Supervisors or by Mr. Shea.

A clever capture of a burglar was mado
by Policeman Ed ODea on Market street
about 4 o'clock yesterday morning. While
passing the saloon of Kapp <fc Street, li'o*>
Market 9treet, he heard a noise insiiie. He
tried the door, but found it locked. This
aroused his suspicion that something was
wrong and he forced open the door.
Inside he found Henry Curtis, alias

effected an entrance by forcing open the
door, which he afterward locked, and had
taken $21 30 from a drawer behind the

was warmly and . 'ely welcomed at
Burlingame and thi â  â â ' iry Club on New
Year's day, for laces scores of
bright and cheerful-looking people ex
changed gr. - their friend?.
Some stui ms were seen at Bur
iingame. and almost all were of cloth or
fashio' : â¢ â  ien good?. One stylish lit
tle Jackson-street matron donned a chic
costume oi fine cloth of tobacco color. The
ekirt was cut by the very latest pattern
and had a glace taffeta lining. It had a
Louis XVI jacket, edged with mink, and
resting on the wearer's pretty head was a
velvet toque (exactly matching the cloth
in shade) which had two touches of bright
son, which gave an effective finish.
Another dress commented en was an
absolutely plain black tailor-made one,
l?ned with dull green silk. A black walk
lat and pearl colored gloves stitched
with black completed this costume, which
admirably suited the very stylish young
woman whom it beautified.
â¢he Century Club many were the
toilettes. Among those who re
ceived no one looked handsomer than a
stately woman with snowy hair piled high
on her head, who wore a gown of exceed
ingly rich Justerless black *:lk, made with
a demi-traMi and a vest of white chiffon
bite silk. A wee bit of a woman,
with Boft gray hair and such a sweet tace,
a biack silk skirt richly brocaded,
an annsualiy attractive waist of
Persian silk, with a most marvelous blend
ing of artistic shades, all of which pro
duced a pinkish effect which brought out
all the lovely tints in her complexion. A
lair-haired dame looked well in a decol
lete toilette- of light silk with light amber
colored trimmings, which were embroid
vith golden sequins.
A very looming creation wasof Dresden
Dale blue and pink flowers wandering
; white ground. Excellent Jace edged
-shaped neck, and a splendid opal
surrounded witn diamonds * held it to
gether.
Among the guests many were attired
in exceedingly handsome visiting cos
tumes. I noted one young married woman
in black velvet, the skirt made as usual,
but the jacket, which was lined with black
Â«:itin. had n deep collar of unusually hand
some chinchilla.
A well-known society woman looked j

A dainty <rentlewoman was clad entirely
in black silk witn a yoke of cut jet over

Frenchy affair composed of exquisite point
lace and black jet pins. Her cape of black
velvet had an apnlique of point lace
&"d I hall i that it was lined
with ' ; it had a sensible
lining or black satin, buf oh, how lovely
white satin is.
<>no of the best known members of the
club wore an elegant gov\ n of black silk
only relieved with a stock ollar of green
ish I. hie cloudy Dresden ribbon, and her
h bonnet was delightfully artinic
No wonder there was such a gathering
of young men, for some of the prettiest
girls in the City were present. Most of
them wore black silk skirt.- and pretty
bodices with swell capes.- There was a
dark-h.-vired debutaDte in a waist of dull
crimson silk through which ran str ; pe!> of
dull green, brown, yellow and pink. The
collar was of preen velvet with a stylish
bow at the back, and her sister wore a
waist of silk changing from light gr<-en to
pale blue, veiled with brown chiffon
which produced an excellent and novel
tffect
A waist I especially liked had a yoke of
white satin embroidered in the most deli
cately shaded Persian silks; the rest of the
garment was of a gray silk, which changed
to a rosy pink.
Another debutante with fascinating eyes
looked like a picture in her black velvet
hat and cape of deep^crimson edged with
mink.
Most of the girls had picture hat 9 and
preat capes of black velvet or sealskin, at
which we only cast a passing glance, as
all were deposited in the dressing-room,
>pace being at a premium, but then any
one who does not enjoy a jam should
never attend a tea, and I heard at least a
dozeu men remark that they bad never
funy realized how jolly a tea was until
Wednesday. Now they should return the
compliment and invite us all to a tea at
one of the clubs on Washington's birth
day, which falls on a Saturday. It would
be sucn a novelty for the men to be "at
home," but, as this is leap year, I con
sider thi.i a bright idea.
At one time I had only three people
standing on my dress, but I do not mind
Fuch things in the least. However, a
friend of mine, who is a bloomer bicyclist,
does so. I said to her, "Next time try
wearing your bloomers," and that is a
hideous idea, for fancy a tea under such
circumstances!
, \ have just been reading about the Phila
delphia (Pa.) Century Club, and find that
Vc a i- IKnedbvtbatremarkablewoman .
Mrs. Is. (-.Townsend, all her desires having
been earned out by a practical woman
architect. The library and committee
rooms, etc. are on the first floor, and on
the second floor is a spacious drawing-room
With a wonderfully perfect miniature stage
at one end. Many young women belong to
this club who thoroughly enjoy the private
theatricals.
Tfiere is a third floor where out-of-town
members can be accommodated with de
lightful rooms, and quite at the top of the
building are the kitchens, presided over by
an excellent chef. This club is not only nut ed
for the many intellectual feasts constantly
presented to its members, but also for the
amount of charity done by two commit
tees. One is for the "legal protection of
workingwomen," the other is "the guild
for giving young workingwomen a chance."
At a recent charity bazaar the most suc
cessful counter was called â¢ a ' charing- !
dish" counter. This was arranged quite j
as an ordinary lunch counter, and behind
it, at regular intervals, were lovely looking
I girls, each presiding over a chafing dish
lining the concoction in which she j
excelled. So one had his choice of rarn- i
bit, Scotch woodcock, chicken, terrapie,
lobster a la Xeuberg, oysters a la poulette,
etc., and it was indeed an embarras de rich- j
esse to choose one from so many good
things. Each young woman was gowned
in a white linen skirt and jacket, a dainty i
shirt, and the regulation white cap of the
Cordon Bleu. Their smart frocks, be- I
jeweled ringers and charm of manner, to
gether with the daintiness of the service,
â¢ielighted their patrons to such an extent
that as soon as they had quite finished
testing the contents of one or the other of
these fairy kitchens they were obliged,
however reluctantly, to ?eek the next at
traction to make room for those who were !
waiting to be initiated. I must not fail to
mention that this petite soiree was hold two j
evenings, but not during the afternoons, '
otherwise this "counter" would have been
unappreciated.
We are always pining for something
new, so why not try such a counter at the
next large charity tea or bazaar.
Many people can afford artistic and mas
sive silver, but nowadays the craze is for
old, odd or rare silver. I presume much
such silver is scattered over this City, for
1 recently saw at one home alone not only
some rare pieces that came to this country
during Colonial days, but also specimens
of wonderfully carved silver from India,
most exquisite cruets and spoons from
Norway, a massive ladle from St. Peters
burg and a number of pieces from other
countries, but what a difference there is
when people personally make such collec
tions. If gifted with ordinary taste, they
can find unique and beautiful articles so
entirely unlike most of the things col
lected wholesale with which the country is
flooded.
How many silver trinkets were sent as
gifts this season and bow unusually beau
tiful were many in design!
The two costumes given in this group
were both, as you see, sketched in Paris.
The visiting dress has a skirt of handsome
plain brown cloth, and is lined with the
darkest purple silk, which exactly matches
the velvet of which the waist is made.
The sleeves are covered with beautiful
white and green applique, the yoke effect
being carried out in the same colors. The
yoke i 3 edged with sable. The large satin
bow at the back matches the velvet, as do
also the black feathers at the neck those
on the hat, which is made of the same
velvet as the waist. The buttons are of
handsome green, "white, black and purple
enamel.
The other gown has a skirt of rose pink
taffeta, but the waist is relieved with the
dull green sa tin embroidered in black silk.
The same embroidery apjpears around the
skirt. The sleeves are of white Dresden
silk covered with green and pink blurred
roses. The outstaud frill is of changeable
mousseline de sole.
A chic evening waist is composed of
apple-green satin over which is arranged
rich lace. The immense collar is wonder
fully becoming. Biack satin ribbon en
circles the waist, tying in a large cbou in
the back. Three long pieces extend up
the front, ending in choux with diamond
centers.
Such a waist is-only a success when good
lace is used, otherwise it will be a complete
failure. The lace completely covers the
back and ends in two square little tails.
The chou has a diamond center.
Mnie. Esperi, a noted P^ris dressmaker,
has lately completed a most delightful
evening gown. It is cut en princesse and
is decollete and is composed of rich ivory
white satin, which shows a front of royal
rose pink velvet. Where the two join the
satiu is cut in deep scallops, which are
most exquisitely embroidered in pink
pearls. The very low-cut bodice is held in
place by while satin ribbons, which pass
over the shoulders, the odd sleeves are
rose-colored mousseline de soie. On the
right side, extending from the bust to the
waist, are three choux of rose velvet with
pearl centers.
A very lovely young girl here wore
when receiving lately at a large tea given
on Broadway a gown of pale-green satin,
simply but most artistically designed, the
godeted skirt hung to perfection and tbe
waist with elbow-sleeves fitted equally
well, Satin ribbons, edged deeply with
gold sequins gave a Frenchy touch to the
prettiest frock worn by any of the young
girls present.
Most men fancy that women are never
so nappy as when ordering or having
made new gowns, but the truth is that
unless a woman can go to the best of tail
ors or dressmakers she has, to say the least
an annoying and fatiguing time ; of course
if her patience is rewarded with success,
she is radiant, but only too frequently
when she has every reason to expect a
dainty, pretty frock, she receives an ab
surd affair, which has neither fit nor style,
and 1 will always maintain toat the most
expensive dressmakers like the most
costly silts, arc the cheapest in the eudj^

however, an inteilieent woman who sews
well, frequently docs wonders when she
understands fully what is desired, but so
few know exactly what they wish, so the
result is more often than not unsatisfact
ory.
\\ orth always kept a large number of
birds from all parts of the world and many
rare flowers, and on one occasion he in
formed a patron that when he required
new ideas concerning combinations he
studied his birds ana flowers, and since
then I have hoard that many of our most
successful dressmakers do likewise, for to
have our gowns co-rrect the designers must
not only study the historical descriptions
and Daintinea of bygone periods, but must
be true artihts as well, so as to properly
handle the exquisite shades and colors
now at their command. As a Paris corre
spondent remarks: "During the coming
reason styles belonging to all periods of
French history will be seen, like unto a
kaleidescope of fashion, carrying us in
their rushing swifs.ne.ss from the ponder
ous, .heavy splendor of the Middle Ages to
the more elaborate if perhaps less grand
period of Francois Premier, and gently
gliding to the dainty and exquisitely col
ored modes of the Louis from first to last."
Every one of us may not only find "ser
mons in stones," but many a valuable sug
gestion for our worldly needs from our
feathered friends and "from every flower
that blooms. A few days ago I saiv an
exquisite orchid, the outer leaves of which
were of a clear pinkish mauve, the
trumpet-shaped center being of a deep
shade of ricii pinkish purple lined with
fine lines of black and yellow. Who can
not receive from such a flower the idea for
a Frenchy blending of the snades â the
skirt of mauve satin, the bodice of deep
pinkish purple velvet embroidered in black
and gold sequin-;
A friend of mine had a most successful
fancy dress not long ago, as she went as
"Pretty roily," her gown carrying out in
green, yellow and red polly's bright-hued
feathers, and this costume came from Paris
direct.
We have been hearing so much about
"pink coats" lately that it is interesting to
note that several prominent women in
England, who follow the hounds, are dis
cussing the question as to whether they
shall or shall not adopt the pinK coat.
Many are in favor of doing so, and I see no
reason why they should not, as bright
coats would mate a delightful bit of color
in a hunting field. This, however, is not
intended as a suggestion for a bicycle cos
tume.
A new glove will shortly make its ap
pearance here. It is of black velvet suede,
with unsewn seamless fingers.
Knickerbockers of black "satin chamois,"
with detachable lining, are said to be de
lightful to wear, and I presume comfort
able. Of course, I mean worn under a
skirt when bicycling, as I have never
favored any costume for bicyclists except
ing the strictly tailor one, with jaunty
coat and waistcoat and well-made skirt.
Princess Maude of Wales is soon to be
come a bride. She is especially inter
esting at present and among other things
Bhe is said to ride well and gracefully,
though the daring feats of equestrianism
with which she has been credited are with-
out foundation. She and her sister Vic
toria are also fond of their bicycles.
A new and beautiful buckle for a waist
belt has appeared. It is composed of
enameled bows studded with diamonds on
either side of a center-clasp of diamonds.
This season dear little gold enameled
brooches which look as though tied with a
A Chic Evening Waist.
diamond bow, have been put up as
"Christmas Crackers" in silk and satin
and lace.
A fan just from Paris which I admire
is an Empire one mounted in dainty
mother-of-pearl and covered with exquis
ite Brussels applique lace, while silk
panels display a delicately painted pasto
ral scene.
Another beauty bin black lisse, mounted
on tortoise Bhell. richly inlaid with gold
and decorated by a charming idyl in
color. Yet another I nave heard described
as being of white lace mounted on a rare
and costly species of black mother-of-pearl
carved in relief.
Neck ruffles are so much in vogue that
descriptions of new ones are in order. One
that looks like a thick rope is caught here
and there with fittle frills. It is made en
tirely of white chiffon and edged with
black lace. The long ends are trimmed
with the lace in a wider width. Delightful
collars are made of the Nero black lisse
with white lace appiiqued on it.
An exceptionally handsome sable boa
worn here by a stylish woman has two
heads and ten tails.
It ?s quite a fad of the moment for those
artistically inclined to paint leather
screens. The leather comes prepared for
this purpose in many unusually attractive
art shades.
Straw lamp shades are novelties which
have met with approval.
Tulle shades are very fashionable and
many consider them to be the most beau
tiful devices to soften lamplight. Imagine
ten or fifteen double ruffles of pale-rose
tulle superimposed, the surface un broke a
to the top, for no ribbons or flowers appear
on these shades, which vary in price from
$15 to $35, according to size.' Something
quite new are shades of chameleon or rain
bow gauze. These silk gauzes have a white
ground and are splashed with pink, yel
low, green, blue and other colors. When
drawn together into the double puffs that
compose the shades the effect is extremely
pretty and the light passes through the
opalescent tints with a soft radiance that
is most agreeable. When of large size
shades of this kind cost $25.

A welcome gift is a unique Chippendale

curtains matching the tints in the music
room.
Desiring to cater to thi3 tasle for special
rooms, a well-known firm in London has
purchased in its entirety Rubens' room,
which they are having carefully and ex
quisitely pieced together. Words but
poorly describe the beauties of this de
lightful chamber, the entire wallsof which
are covered with oak, arranged in compar
atively small panels. The doors are double
and elaborately carved. The center and
upper panels are open and barred with
delicately carved and fluted pillars, while
not the least noticeable are the worked
steel bandies which form an effective linish.
What a delightful woman the Princess
de la Tour d'Auvergne must be. An
American writes that she has every talent
ana is equally at ease in dictating the
terms of a treaty or washing her child's
face. She takes an interest in art, politics,
society, and still Dumas says of her. "she
is the typical femme dv foyer," a loving
wife and devoted mother.
Minnie Maddern Fiske is acting in
Brooklyn and causing much enthusiasm,
and, as a critic says, "she has developed
from a clever, intelligent girl actress into
a woman whose emotional powers are un
equaled by any in this country. Let us
hope San Francisco may soon have the
pleasure of welcoming her.
If the cold weather continues we will all
be investing in muffs and muffchains,
which are very charming affairs, being of
many designs; for instance, those of gold
exquisitely embroidered in either blue or
green, or still more beautiful is one show
ing a blending of pinks, greens and blues
in the enamel. Precious stones are much
used, especially in Paris are uncut emer
alds the rage, but all manner of stones are
used, opals being extremely popular at the
present moment.
Silver toilet articles are becoming too
commonplace, so ivory and shell are now
more stylish. They are rather more ex
pensive; one set of the most perfect ivory
snows on the back of the brush and mir
ror a crest in Dale-blue enamel, and a tor
toise-shell set shows a similar ornamenta
tion in dull gold. The tortoise shell is so
very appropriate for men. For children
mother of pearl is very exquisite when the
toilet-table is covered with baby blue and
white lace.
The girls who were at the pink luncheon
all had a lovely time, but then every one
enjoys being entertained at that hospitable
home on Jackson street.
I hear rumors about any number of
lunch and card parties which will be duly
announced in the near future; and no one
wishes you all a happier New Year than
does Marcella.

HOW MEN PEOPOSE.
Some Examples From Recent Magazine
Fiction.
It is said that there are as many ideals
of beauty as there are men. This truism
also applies to other things, which is well,
otherwise we should be bored. Suppose
every lover proposed in precisely the same
way I One effect would be the demolishing
of the business of the story-writer. De
cember authors gallantly vary the inter
esting moment in their talcs. Here is the
way they get around the difficulty :
Mr. Howelk' young lady in Harper's,
after flatly telling the young man that
she guesses she doesn't care for him and
he can go away, says: "Thank you. I
only wished to know the worst. And you're
not going away hating me?"
"No; lovine you more than ever."
She turns her face and averts her eyes.
"Whyâ what are you â going for?"
"Phillippa!" He throws his arms about
her and clasps her to him.
Mr. Howells offers no explanation for her
turnabout propensities. His silence adds
weight to his well-known scorn for vacil
lating woman.
Kate Douglass Wiegin strings out the
proposal in her story to a column, which is
bad â at least for the article. But the lov
ers are 40 and 30, so it does not much mat
ter. And they had been engaged before.
In truth Madge Robertson has a pretty

were tears in the girl's eyes, and she ex
tended her hands. "You'will go and see
the little thing aeain," she said, softly,
"and Iâ l should like to bo with you."
"Always?" ventured the young fellow,
his heat beating painfully.
He kissed her hand. Then he kissed her
arm. Then he looked up into her eyes,
and thenâ he kissed her lips. All this goes
to prove that the way to win a girl is to
find an object of charity and bestow on it
something intended for her.
In Lippincott's Mary E. Stickney's
novel, "The Old Silver Trail,' has a dou
ble-barreled oroposal. The first does not
count, because the silver mine blows up
and kills the girl's father in the midst of
it, and the girl breaks with her lover,
whom her fatbei* hated, because he has
ideas about Providence and its interfer
ence, JHere is the second one :
"Is it really you?" he incredulously
whispered with trembling touch raressing
the little hands. "You here! Why are
you here, Dorothy ?"
"The doctor wrote me that yon were
sick," she faltered, her lingers tightening
on his with a sort of shuddering tender
ness as at a remembered terror.
"And you came for that, Dorothy,
sweetheart? The last time I saw you you
told me that you hated me. It was not
true?"
"I think â I think more of you â than I
thought I did," she murmurpd.
'â¢Ah, the happy thought! God bless
you for it, sweetheartâ mine!"
This is essentially a "Western method of
patching up affairs. There is nothing so
efficacious in the wielding together of two
severed hearts as a case of brain fever and
an understanding' doctor.
Robert Barr's hero is frightfully prosaic
in "The Understudy" in the Cosmopol
itan.
"Oh," answered the girl, "I have no
patience with you."
"I am sorry for that, Mary," said Or
mond, "for if I couid have made a living I
intended to ask you to be my wife."
"Oh," cried the girl, breathlessly, turn
ing her head away, After the usual de
murrer she says ''Yes."
Further search reveals the amazing fact
that the proposalâ in literature at least
is becoming obsolete. Stories there are of
s plenty, but in the English publications
they mostly relate to mysterious disap
pearance of diamonds or are tales of con
spiracy or intrigue, and in the American
product the proposal is all done behind
the scenes â the reader is introduced to the
engaged couple or to the married pair.
The sentimental age is passing, evidently,
and we contemptuously hurry over tha
romantic episodes to reach those dramatics
crises in life which seem to occupy tha
attention of both writers and readers.â^

IN CHILHOODS
REALM
"Booh
On afternoons, when baby boy has had a splenddl
nap,
And sits, like any monarch on his throne, in nurse's
lap,
In some such wise my handkerchief I bold before
my face.
And cautiously and quietly I move about the
place:
Then, with a cry, I suddenly expose my fnce to
view,
And you should bear him laugh and crow when I
say "Booh!"
Sometimes the rascal tries to make believe that he
is scared.
And really, wnen I first began, he stared, and
stjirp.l. and stared;
And then his under lip came out and farther out It
came,
Till tnuinma and the nurs? agreed it was a "cruel
shin:
But now what does that same wee, toddling, lisp
intr baby <io
But ugh and kick his little heels when I say
"Booh!"
He laughs and kicks his little heels In rapturous
gle<?, and then
In shrill, despotic treble bids me "do it all aden!"
And â of course Ido it ; ior. as his progenitor,
It is su h pretty, pleasant play as this that lam
for :
And it is, oh, such fun ! and I am sure that we shall
rue
The time when we are both too old to play the
game of tooh!"
Ecgkne . h.d, Live' Songs of Childhood.
Hurrah for a brand-new year!
Wouldn't it be jolly if everybody in the
world should take a fresh start and not do
one single more naughty thing? It would
be easy enough, too, if everybody began at
the same time.
A shrill little voice over there in the
corner pipes up to say that everybody ex
cept the children is good already.
Now, Brighteyes, it's very kind of you
to think that, and I am going to reward
you by telling you a secret.
It isn't true â that is, that only children
are naughty.
And here is another secret. There are
some very wise and kind men, with gray
hairs in their heads, who believe that chil
dren are not naughty at all.
Here are some of the things that some
of the grown-ups will have to do to make
that best kind of a New Year.
The Sultan of Turkeyâ well, what can
be done with him?
if you children read the newspapers on
weekdays, which 1 almost hope you don't,
you already know that the Sultan is
making bis soldiers kill people just as if it
was the nicest kind of a game to kill
hundreds of people just for fun.
If Turkey and Armenia are too far away
for little folks to worry about, you might
feel sorry because the very bad Apache
Indians are killing settlers right over here
in Arizona again.
Besides that, English people and Ameri
cans, who cuL'ht to be busy sending ships
full of good things and good thoughts to
all the poor benighted heathen nations !
are taking time to call each other bad '
names.
It's funny about these things.
If two boys get to righting 'at school and
really go to work t 0 hurt each other, the

teacher says they are exceedingly naughty,
and very Billy besides. But when two
nations make up their minds to go to war
everybody waves a flag, and even the
schoolma'anis seem to think it is a grand
time.
Quarreling and killing are not the only
bad things in the world, though they are
the most dreadful.
tnebody says we should have a com
mandment against lying, and it would
make all the rest unnecessary. And surely
if everybody told the truth' and nobody
cheated the New Year would seem pretty
clean and bright.
Onlyâ there's something else to learn
first.
It - love.
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy
seii."
If everybody told the truth some people
would be very angry with others, and
would say to those they treated kindiv,
â¢'Go awayâ you are so bad I do not want to
see you."
Bat then we're not to love only our good
neighoors and those that never did wrong.
The sunshine and the rain fall on every
body alike, and that advice about your
neighbors sounds as if love were meant to
do tne same thing.
It might be a Tittle hard, too, if every
body were to begin to be good the same
day, and a little tiresome if everybody got
good exactly alike.
Perhaps, after all, the dear old, stum
bling sinning world that God made is best,
and the New Year that comes to us a bet
ter one than we could make for ourselves.
Two Kmiiiwiiy Mariners.
"You are to turn over a new leaf, young
man."
Bert's father shook an admonishing
finger at his son and heir, and his voice
had a determined ring which rather
frightened that young person.
The boy liked his own way, and the
paternal opinion was that he had en
joyed quite too much freedom.
Mamma and the coddling aunts and
grandmothers thought Bert the dearest
boy in the world and humored all his
whims. The "Governor," as the youne
hopeful half jocosely and half proudly
called his father, said Bert needed disci
pline and undertook to administer the
sun io in judicious doses.
This bright morning of the new year
Bert had been instructed to report at his
father's office.
The suggestions that were there made
to him were distasteful in the extreme.
"You have been tardy at school re
peatedly,'' the governor said, "and you
are not to allow that to occur again.
"You are to rise at 7, when the first bell
rings.
"You are not to shirk your cold

j and you are to present yourself in the I
dining-room at half-past 7 all ready for in- '
sweet ionâ shoes blacked, clothes brushed,
finger nails in order.
"After breakfast you are to look over
i your lessons for half an hour and then you
i may walk to school. Thereby you will
j save both carfare and health. At school i
I you are to apply yourself, and when study
I hours are over you may come to my office". '
Ihere will be errands for you to do and
they will keep you out of mischief until
dinner-time. At dinner 1 wish to see you
freshly washed and brushed, quiet and
I>olite.
"After dinner you can make yourself
agreeable to your mother and sisters If
they wish you to do so you may escort
them abroad: if not, you may perhaps
read aloud or sing with Ruth and Jo
sephine.
"In any event you will retire at 10
o clock, unless it suits your mother's con
venience to keep you with her.
"That is all, sir, for to-day, and I wish
you a Happy New Year."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
Bert took liis father's lecture yery seri
ously indeed. He had gone up to the office
expecting to be offered some jolly sort of
present or outing, a continuation of the
Christmas treats. Perhaps those same
holiday festivities had rather demoralized
the lad, for he was not, even in honor of
the day, particularly good humored.
"The governor expects just a little bit
too much," Bert said to himself sullenly,
as he walked along the street.
"Where on earth does the fun come in,
I'd like to know?
"I'm to walk a chalked mark all the
time, it seems, and I am to think of every
body's pleasure except ray own."
Bert had certainly feasted too gener
ously on holiday sweets. llh temper
grew worse und Worse, and brooding upon
his wrongs and sorrows he soon began to
find them unendurable.
He stalked alonu with head down and a
puckered brow, kicking viciously now and
then at a friendly dog that followed him.
Bert had not thought much about which
way he was goin<r, when suddenly he
found himself face to face with his chum.
W alter Strong.
ihe boys eyed each other darkly like a
" of brigands.
What's t he matter with you?" Walter
mbled after a while.
Nothing; what's got you?"
The same; let's go take a walk."
Without the necessity of word of mouth
lads turned their faces toward the
pretty little vessel was preparing to
pail for the Hawaiian Islands. Bert and
Walter looked matters over with a com
mon interest that needed no words. Per
haps Walter did condescend to jerK nis
thumb toward a little group of Kanakas
Bho were preparing to embark. At any
, these fellows soon absorbed the at
ion of both boys, and were much flat
tered thereby.
Their faces were soon wreathed in
smiles, and hugging their queer musical
instruments, the Hawaiians bejian to sin
and twang the soft melodies that to them
are easier than silence.
They were full of joy at the prospect of
going home, these children of nature.
Their white duck trousers flapped in
ploriously in the stiff sea breeze, but they
were sublimely unconscious.
The sea was" like a mother to them, and
after a week on its bosom they would see
again their beloved islands.
Bert and Walter couldn't understand a
word of the songs, but the tnoughts
within them w r ere easy to read.
"If we could live where they are going
we'd never have to work nor study any
more," Bert ventured after awhile.
"No," Walter responded quickly, "nor
listen to any more beastly New Year's lec
tures.''
Bert scowled sympathetically, and the
chums understood each other better than
tvi-r.
Silence reigned for a long time. Both
boys were thinking hard and there was no
need of Bpeech.
"Yon can just about live in the water
out there," Bert Baid after a while, "and
the wind is as warm as milk. Besides in
some of the i-lands you needn't wear
neckties nor black your shoes, nor any
thing." ' *
The temptation was too great.
_ Together tin.- boys rose, ami without an
instant's hesitation set about finding the
captain of the ship.
That captain cnancea to be a sensible
man, and he only laughed at the would-be
runaway boys.
"I'll lake you out if your fathers will
pay the passage money," he announced
and no amount of dignified urging could
induce him to accept the two impromptu
sailors.
The boys hoped to the last that the cap
tain would relent, and they waited
patiently till the vessel got underway For
the voyage, the hospitable Kanakas'stiil
Bin ging and beckoning on deck.
Walter and Bert roamed about discon
solately, thoroughly convinced that life
had no further interest for them unless
they could go sailing â

Ten thousand miles away.
An English ship, that looked about half
a mile long, was ready for sea except that
she was short of men.

were good stout boys, and that is the next
best thing.
The British captain was in a dire ex
tremity, and quieting his conscience by
some process he took the boys on board.
The youngsters had no chance to repent
after they had inspected their new quar
tersand surveyed the situation generally.
When they attempted to go up on deck
asain they were ordered back in no gentle
tones, and found themselves virtually
prisoners. Two frightened white-faced
lads were Bert and Walter before the
Jo lly Susan had passed the Golden Gate.
B etween terror and seasickness they were
w retched indeed.
Nobody brought tea and toast to the
wretched lumps of humanity that huddled
into most uncomfortable berths; nobody
brougnt hot-water bags when their feet
grew cold and their heads were coals of fire.
Instead coarse sailors laughed brutally,
and the second mate came swearing co-
Diously to kick them up on deck.
\\ here was the sense of freedom the
boys had longed for, had given up their
football games and their mothers to en
joy?
Nobody seemed to have the good taste
even to stay away. There was no rest by
day, no matter what spasms of seasickness
racked the young manners. At night, too
unhappy and too unco-nlortable to sleep,
the boys lay and thought of their troubles,
whispering together when nobody was
near.
Weeks and months wore away, and the
seasickness, at least, abated.
Otherwise their situation, the boys
thought, grew worse and worse.
They were set tasks too large for them,
beaten and tortured when they failed,
treated with uniform unkindness in any
event.
At last Walter, numb with cold and
weariness, fell from the rigging and was
seriously injured.
The Jolly Susan had sailed far in all this
time.
vVhither she was bound, what ports she
entered, these were things the runaway
sailor- boys scarcely knew or cared. They
grew strangely hopeless after awhile, ana
when the ship was in port they were kept
below as at the iirst, helping the cook, and
performing other tasks less to their liking.
When Walter was hurt by his fall his
senses seemed to desert him. Perhaps his
nerves were already overstrained to the
breaking point, and" perhaps it was only
the accident that did the mischief.
At any rate Walter was certainly crazy,
and Bert was so terrified at this "new ca
lamity that ne was not much better off.
Both boys tried to jump overboard in
midocean. The captain, who was nc/t after
all such a bad fellow as sea-captains tro,
wa-s touched at last at tbe sufferings of the
two landsmen.
Giving the boys a little attention at last
the captain learned of the eircumstences
under which they had shipped, observed
that they were boys of good families and
well brought up and felt himself in a di
lemma.
The boys were given comfortable quar
ters at last, and received medical aid.
; Bert was worn to a shadow of his former
plump and rosy self, and the lines in his
lace would have wrung his mother's heart
II She had seen them.
Walter was badly injured, and in his de
hnum he raved of the home he had left
; or babbled happily of other times and
places.
! "Sini: to me, Bert," he would call out in
the middle of the night; "sine, quick
quick!" '
And Bert, not knowing how else to quiet
his friend, would choke back his sobs to
sing the old songs they both loved now.
! One night Walter was more quiet, and
| after a long sleep he remembered every -
I thing. J
"Bert, ".he said in a weak voice, "Bert
do you think we shall ever co home
again?"
Bert thought it extremely doubtful, but
his Bpint rose to the occasion.
"Why, yes/ he answered. "I wouldn't
be a bit surprised if we should start homo
to-morrow.
"Do you remember that New Year's
sermon 1 got so mad at the governor
about ?
'â¢W<ll, I've thought about that and
thought about it, nights ana days too.
"I believe I could repeat the whole
thing, word for word.
"And wasn't it a lecture?
"Rise ai 7 when the bell ringsâ jolly
good breakfast and school, the governors
office, dinner, slay with mother ami the
girlsâ say, how would you like a chance to
do all that?' 1
There were tears in Bert's voice any
way, and the sick boy opposite coughed
and moan i <1. b
"It'a all my fault any way, for gettin"
yon into this scrape. p
".Neither of us would ever have acted so
aloneâ why i 8 it that when two fellows
agree to do a thing it never seema wrong
trll afterward, and then most likely it
seems worse than anything you could
have thought of by yourself?*' The two
lonely boys talked themselves to sleep at
last, and for a lime their troubles were
forgotten.

DONALD SERIES-NO. X.
FOR TINY BOYS.
Here is a story which was told to Donald
not lorn,' ago, and I am sure all the tiny
boys will enjoy it just as much as he did.
Once upon a time, a long while ago,
there lived a great big, big boy, five years
old. "Oh!" (I think 1 hear you say) "a
boy five years old isn't a big, big boy."
N", he was not a very tall boy. and not an
old boy, but he i>lt as if he were as big as
the biggest giant that "Jack the Gjant
i Killer" had ever met ; because at Christ

mas time "Santa Claus" had brought him
something that only big boys had in those
days.
1 know you are anxious to learn what it
was. Well, it was a beautiful slateâ oh!
so big and black and smooth, with a white
pine frame, upon whicn were marked all
the letters of the alphabet, besides won
derful pictures of animals ami shins.
Around the edge of the frame was a strip
of bright red felt, held in place by a piece
of cord, which was twisted in and out of
the little holes which had been bored all
along the edge of the frame.
The little boy took a strong piece o
twine, to one end of which he tied a soi ,
sponge, then, after passing the con
through one of the holes, he tied a nicel '
sharpened siatepencil to the other end
then he was fixed. My, how anxious h
was ;or school to open, so that he cou!<
show all the other boys how much better ,
his wonderful sla'.e was than their old
scratchy tin ones.
When the day came he was so excited he j
could hardly wait for his mother to get
him ready and fix him his nice lunch, but
at last he started with his new slate slung
over one shoulder.
At first he walked alone: quietly enonprh,
but when he came in sight of the little
schoolhouse and saw the boys running to
meet him, eager to find out what Santa
Clau* bad driven him, he kicked up his
heels and commenced to run, too. Ala?k!
Alack! The first time he lifted aphis
sturdy little heels one of them struck his
adored slate behind his buck ami there
was a crash, while pieces of hroken slate
tlew in all directions. The poor disap
pointed little boy looked for a moment in
dismay at the empty frame, and then sat
down by the roadside bemoaning the loss
of his treasure, surrounded by his sym- ,

expected to "crow" that v-tv day.
Ami so. after all, the little boy had to
use his old tin slate all that year just the
same as the other boys.
FIGHTING FOR FREIGHTS
The Oregon Cnmpany'9 Competition for
Way-Port l'.iiHiness May Precipitate
Another Kate War.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company having settled the subject of
passenger rates, for the present at least, is
concentrating its energies on freight busi
ness between San Francisco and Portland.
It intends that no business that can be se
cured by attention to interests of shippers
shall go to competitors, and in following
out this policy the company will hereafter
take and deliver freight, and passengers,
too, at way ports.
To make this possible the South Coast, a
steamer smaller than the company's regu
lar vessels, has been put into service. The
South Coast i 3 expected to arrive in this
port to-day on her first round trip. D. C.
O'Eeilly. assistant general freight agent of
the corporation, is on board, coming to
San Francisco for the purpose of inducing
shippers to patronize his line.
Being a small steamer, the South Coast
can enter way ports and steam from one
wharf to another here and in Portland to
discharge and receive freight. She will
carry passengers to and from Arcata,
Eureka, }lar9hneld, Empire City, Astoria,
Portland and San Francisco, making the
trip m four days. Whenever necessary
sue will stop at salmon canneries between
Astoria and Portland for cargo.
On her first southern trip she has fif
teen passengers and a full cargo of general
freight. The passenger business between
San Francisco and Portland will be con
fined to the repular large steamers of the
Oregon Company.
As freights on the way-port steamer are
low, it is believed that this new competitor
will cause a rate war with the opposition
steamers, and the results will be' awaited
with much interest by thippers all along
the coast.
Tne situation with regard to Southern
Pacific competition to Portland remains
unchanged.

On January 6 of the Gregorian calendar

therewith.
At the conclusion of the liturgy or mass
the Bishop will give the solemn benedic

WEAVER IS INDORSED.
The Associated Charities Pass Resolu
tions Deploring the Efforts Being
_M;iile to Kemove Him.
The friends of Superintendent Weaver
of the Almshouse are rallying to his sup
port and striving to stave off the threat*
ened change which is expected to take
place at the next meeting of the Board of
Health. The Associated Charities have
always taken an active interest in tha
welfare of the establishment, and havo
nothing but good words to say for the
superintendent and Mrs. Weaver.
At a meeting of the organization held
yesterday the following preamble and
resolution indorsing the present manage
ment and deploring the efforts that are
being made to bring about a change were
adopted :
Whereas, It has been publicly stated that
Governor James H. Build has recommended
that the Hoard of Health of San Francisco re
move the present superintendent of the San
Francisco Almshouse; and whereas, the man
agement of the S&u Francisco Almsbouse, un
der the superintendency of Mr. Weaver, has
been a credit to this City at home and abroad,
ranking: second in efficiency and excellence In
all the United States; anil whereas, it is with
in the knowledge of the .Associated Charities
of San Francisco that under Mr. Weaver's man
agement tiiis public charity has been con
ducted in a manner to most benefit the poor
and unfortunate who were obliged to seek its
shelter; and whereas, never before in the his*
tory or this City and' State has the Almshouse
of San Francisco been drawn into partisan
politics and treated as part and parcel of tha
spoils system; therefore be it
Resolvd, That we, the Associated Charities
of San t : tincLseo, do deplore this attempt to de
grade the povernment of this City by turning
its charitable institutions over to the control
of politicians, and then in the sacred name of
charity and in the best interests of the City
we do petition the gentlemen composing tha
Board of Health of San Francisco to be true to
tne reputation- they have always borne in this
community and to refuse to imperil the inter
ests of this City ami the welfare of tne unfor
tunates in the Almshouse by removing an
official whose competency arid worth have
been established by years of successful work.
Be it further,
Resolved, That the secretary is hereby in.

A VICTIM OF MORPHINE.
Jack Shea, an Ex-Convict, Diea in thÂ«
City Prison.
Jack Shea, an ex-convict, died in the City
Prison yesterday morning and his body
was taken to the Morgue. He was arrested
on Sixth street Friday morning for being
drunk. Some hours later he blamed a fel
low-prisoner for stealing his hat and struck
him in the face, drawing blood from his
nose. Clerk Sullivan of Judge Low's court
saw the blow struck and preferred a charge
of battery against Shea.
Shea was 27 years of age and addicted to
the use of morphine and cocaine, which
had reduced him to a mere skeleton.
About 5 o'clock yesterday morning one of
the "trusties" noticed that Shea was rest
less and twenty minutes afterward discov
ered that he was dead.
Shea had been several times arrested,
and in 1883 he was sentenced to five years
in San Qirentin for robbery. His brother
James, about fifteen years ago, was shot
dead by Policeman Fresno, now deceased,

STOPPING A Gr.EAT SHIP.
The Tremendous Momentum That Has
to Ue Arrested.
The motion of a steamship on the At
lantic, when the sea is calm, is so smooth
and steady that the passenger hardly
realizes the tremendous momentum of the
vessel under his feet. A collision, even
after the engines have been slowed down,
gives a startling revelation of the energy
of motion. This energy can also be ac
curately calculated with the aid of mathe
matical formulas, and the time and dis
tance within which the motion can be
totally arrested and the ship be brought
to a stand, may be ascerta.ned in a similar
manner. This calculation has recently
been made for several well-Knovvn shii)s\

sible place, as the bottom of a pond or the
Bea. bounds are produced by the changes
in an electric circuit, due to" variations in
temperature. The electrical resistance of
metals increases with a ri>e in tempera
ture and the rate of increase is different for
| each metal. Two coils, therefore, having
: the same resistance at a particular temper
ature, will vary widely .it any oilier
temperature, so that should they be con

c >mpared. The introduction of a tele

The instrument is located at any point and
may hare a number of coils "connected

I determining the fluctuations in the tem

temperature between the water at the sur

The instrument is extremely sensitive and
accurate, is independent of pressure, quick

The Sun's Heat.
There is no known metal, and perhaps
no substance whatever, which demands so
high a temperature to fuse it as does the
element carbon. A filament of carbon,
and a filament of- carbon alone, will re
main unfused and unbroken when heated
by the electric current to the . dazzling
nrilliance necessary for effective illumina
tion. This is the reason why this particu
lar element is so indispensable for our in
candescent electric lamps. Modern re-
has now taught us that, just as the
electrician has to employ carcon as the
immediate agent in producing the brigÂ»t
est of artificial lights down here, so the
sun in heaven uses precisely the same ele
ment as the immediate agent in the pro- j
duction of its transcendent light and heat, i
Owing to the extraordinary fervor which I
prevails in the interior parts of the sun, j
all substances there present, no matter
how dilticult we may rind their fusion,
would have to submit to be melted, nay,
even to be driven off into vapor. If sub
mitted to the, heat of this appalling solar }
furnace, an iron poker, for instance, would ;
vanish into invisible vapor. â McClure's

In this scene occurs a passage which

whole tragedy of his life is bounded as in
a nutshell. Hamlet exclaims: â¢â¢There is
nothing either good or bad, but thinking

clew to the failure of many a potentially

in life is he who only ?ees one side. The

EXPRESS Or THE FUTURE.
How It Will Seem to Travel Through a
Pneumatic Tube.
"Take care!" cried my conductor,
"there's a step!"
Safely descending the step thus indi
cated to me I entered a vast room, illumi
nated by blinding electric reflectors, the
sound of our feet alone breaking the soli
tude and :-ilence of the pkce.
Where was I? What had I come thoro
to do? Who was my mysterious guide?
Questions unanswered. A long walk in
tne night, iron doors opened and reclosed
with a clang, stairs descending, it seemed
to me, deep into the earthâ that is all I
could remember. I had, nowever, no time
for thinking.
In this way Jules Verne opens a charac
teristic sketch in the Strand Magazine for
January.
"No doubt you are asking yourself who
lam?" said my guide: "Colonel Pierce,
An Express of the Future.
at your service. Where arc you? In
America, at Boston â in a station."
"A station ?''
"Yes, the starting-point of the 'Boston
to Liverpool Pneumatic Tubes Company.' "
And, with an explanatory gesture, the
colonel pointed out to me two ionjr iron
cylinders, about a meter and a half in
diameter, lying upon the ground a few
pac?s off.
I looked at theÂ»e two cylinders, endine
on the right in a mass of masonry, and
closed on the left with heavy metallic
caps, from which a Cluster of tubes were
carried up to the roof; and suddenly i
comprehended the purpose of all this.
Had I not a short time before read in an
American newspaper an article describing
this extraordinary project for linking
Europe with the New A\ odd by means of
two gigantic submarine tubes? An inven
tor had claimed to have accomplished the
task, and that inventor, Colonel Pierce, I
had before me.
In thought I realized the newspaper
article.
ComDlaisantly the journalist entered
into the details of the enterprise. He
stated that more than 3000 miles of iron
tubes, weighing over 13.000,000 tons, were
required, with the number of ships neces
sary for the transport of this materialâ
200 ships of 2000 tons, each making thirty
three voyages. He described this Armada
of science bearing the steel to two special
vessels, on board of which the ends of the
tubes were jojned to each other and in
cased in a triple netting of iron, the whole
covered with a resinous preparation to pre
serve it from the action of the sea water.
Coming at ouce to the question of work
ing, hejiilect the tubesâ transformed into
a sort of pea-shooter of interminable
lengthâ with a series of carriages, to be
carried with their travelers by powerful
currents of air. in the same way that dis
patches are conveyed pneumatically round
Paris.
A parallel with the railways closed the
article, and the author enumerated with
enthusiasm the advantages of the new and
audacious system. According to him,
there would be, in passing through these
tubes, a suppression of all nervous trepida
tion, thanks to the interior surface bein"
of finely polished steel; (.quality of temp
erature secured by means of currents of
air, by which the heat could be modified
according to the seasons; incredibly low
fares, owing to cheapness of construction I
and working expensesâ waving aside all
questions oi gravitation and wear and tear.
As to the possibility of obtaining a cur
rent of air from one end of the tube to the
othetâ Boston to Englandâ Colonel Pierce i
smilingly assured me that all we required
was a treat number of steam fans similar
to those used in I'last-furnaces. The air
was driven by them with a force practically ,
without limit, the speed attainable being
ISOO kilomvttrsâ almost thar of a cannonâ¢ i
ball. Taking into account the difference j
in time, th . traveler from Liverpool would I
reach Boston earlier than he started. The I
speed could be checked en route by turn
ing a handle and letting in the opposing
current of air from the parallel tuba j
wherein a train speeds in the opposite
direction.
Trie colonel pulled sharply a bright brass
Knob projecting from the side of one of the
tubes; a panel slid smoothly in its groovrs,
and in the opening loft by its removal I
perceived a row of seats, on "each of which
two persons might sit comfortably side by
side. J
"The carriage!" excaimeil the colonel.
"Come in and try the things."
By the light ol an electric lamp in the
roof I carefully examined the carriage 1
bad entered.
Nothing could be more simple. A long
cylinder, comfortably upholstered, along
which seme fifty armchairs, in pairs, were
ranged in twenty-five parallel rank*. At
either end a valve regulated the atmos
pberic pressure, that at the further end
allowing breathable air to enter the car
riage; that in front allowing lor the dis
charge of any excess beyond a normal
pressure.
After spending a few moments on this
examination I became impatient.
"Well," I said, ' - are we not going to
start?"
"Going to start?" cried the colonel. "We
have started !"
Startedâ like that â without the least
jerk, was it possible? I listened atten
tively, frying io detect a sound of some
kind that might have guided me.
If wo had rrally scarredâ if the colonel
had not deceived me in talking of a speed
of eighteen hundred kilometers an hour â
we must already bo far from any land,
under the sea; above our heads the huge'
foam-crested waves; even at chat moment,
perhapsâ taking it for a monstrous sea
sprpent of an unknown kirdâ whales were
battering with their powerful tails our
Ions; iron prison !
Plunged in boundless astonishment, un
able t"> beliovpin the reality of all that had
happened to me, I sat silently, allowing
the time to pass.
At tin" end of about an hour a sense of
freshness unon my forehead suddenly
Traveling by Pneumatic Tube.
[Reproduced from the Strand Magazine]
aroused me from the torpor into which I
had sunk by degrees.
I raised my hand to mv brow; it was
moist.
Moist! Why was that? Had the tube
burst under pressure of the watersâ a
pressure that could not but be formidable,
since it increases at the rate of "an atmos
phere" every ten meters of depth? Had
the ocean broken in upon us?
Fear seized me. Terrified. I tried to call
outâ andâ and I found myself in my gar
den, generously sprinkled by a driving
rain, the bigdrops of which had awakened
me. _ I had simply fallen asleep while
reading the article devoted by an Ameri

Colonel Pierce, who also, I 1 much fear, has
only dreamed.
Sound of the Voice.
An inquiry was recently made in London
as to the greatest distance at which a man's
voice could be heard, leaving of course,
the telephone out of consideration. The
reply was most interesting, and was as
follows: Eighteen miles is the longest
distance on record at wbich a man's voice
has been heard. This occurred in the
Grand Canyon of the- Colorado, where one
man shouting the name 'T.ob" at one end.
his voice was plainly heard at the other
end, which is eighteen miles away. Lieu
tenant Foster, on Parry's third Arctic
expedition, found that he could converse
with p. man across the harbor of Port
Bowen, a distance of 6696 feet, or about
one and a quarter miles; and Sir John
I ran Win said that he conversed with ease
at a distance of mom than a mile. Dr.
Young records that at Gibraltar the human
voice has beon heard at a distance of ten
miles. To this we may acid that the cele
brated preacher, Rowland Hilif relates
that once, while walking along a country
road, he saw a gravel bank cave in upon
workmen. He shouted for help, and
was heard a full mile. This, being across
an ordinary English country region, is
perhaps as extraordinary as any of those
mentioned.
Jiyron and tho Critics.
Byron is probably the only instance in
literary history of a critic-made poet. His
"Hours of Idleness" was strictly what it
claimed to be, the production of a yonth
who had nothing special to do and turned
bia attention to poetry as a means of pasÃ
ing the time. Had the critics suffered it
to pass unnoticed, it is quite probablt that
the poet would never have been heard of
again in the world of letters. But the edi
tor of the Edinburgh Review could not
miss an opportunity of "roasting" some
body, and so attacked the modest little
volume with all the virulence of which he
was able. The criticism, most of which
was very unjust, made Byron very niii-ry,
and he turned on the critic with "English
Bards 1 and Scotch Reviewers," and showed
in this powerful satire a degree of manly
force ana vigor oi whicb no one supposed
him rapÂ»bio. It was bis only utUranca of
any consequence against the critics.
When it was followed by the opening
cantos of "Childe Harold' the criticisms
were renewed, but the chorus of praise was
so loud that the dissonant notes were lost.

Mice That "Waltz.
In Japan there is a breed of mice, white
speckled wiih black about the head, neck
and tail, which have a strange habit of
whirling, or as it is called, "waltzing," for
hours at a time with only brief stoppages.
The desire to waltz seizes the mice at the
most unexpected moments, especially at
night, for they tenerally sleep during the
day. Frequently they whirl in couples,
but fÂ»o rapidly that they appear like spin
ning rings of "white and black. Like Giant
Despair's fits, the waltzing paroxysms of
these mice often seise them while they
arc running, and if they attempt to escape
from imprisonment, they do not <ro far
before thep are arrested by the irresistible
desire to whirl. The tendency is heredi
itary, and exhibits itself as soon as the
young mice begin to ran about.â Youths'

SALIBUBY AS HE IS.
Interesting Facts About the English
Prime M'nister.
The present Prime Minister is a man
who would have succeeded in most any
walk of life he had chosen to follow. The
i cad of an historical family, and possessed
of great wealth, his opportunities have no
doubt been great; but for all that it is to
his sreat natural abilities that he mainly
owes his success. It must be remembered
that he had made a ripure in the world
when tie was plain Lord Robert Cecil, and
before there was any likelihood of his com
ing into the family title and estates.
Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyner-Cecil
was born in 1830 and was educated at Eton
and Christ Church, Oxford. At the uni
versity he was a frequent and effective
speaker at the Union Debating Society, and
in 1358 he was elected member of Parlia
ment for the family borough of Stam
ford. Four years Ja'tcr he married Miss
Alderson, daughter of the Judj;e of that
name. Her parents wt-re opposed to the
union, not, considering Lord Robert Cecil
a sufficiently good match. Lord Robert
was then a younger son, and with very
little money at his disposal. Indeed, in
the year of his marriage he took to jour
nalism m order to supnly the deficiency of
a somewhat inadequate allowance.
In that year the Saturday Review was
started, and soon be'eame famous by the
cleverness, wit and daring of its articles.
Lord Jiobert Cecil was one of the earliest
and most valued contributors. It was be
tween 18,39 and 1865 that he made his mark
in the Commons. This was in Lord Palm
erston's second administration. It was in
L 865 that his elder brother died and he be
came Lord Cranborne and heir to the Mar
quinate. In the following year, on the
formation of Lord Derby's third adirfini-
tration, he was appointed Secretary of
State for India. His father died in LÂ«67,
and he came into the title and entered the
House of Lords. He soon established a
reputation as foremost debater in the up
mt house. In 1?74 he took oflice, under
Mr. Disraeli, and in 1576 was sent to Con
stantinople to try and help to settle the
dispute between "Russia and Turkey. He |
also went with Lord Beacon afield "to the i
Berlin Congress, and rendered great assist
ance m that affair.
On the death of Lord Eeaconsfield in
18 80 Lord Salisbury became the recognized
leader of toe Conservative party. He be
came Premier in June, 188i>, on the resig
nation of Mr. Gladstone, and again after
th c general election of 1886. The present

THK TINTOMETER.
A Contrivance for Measuring Colors
Recently luvented in England.
The tintometer, as its name implies, is a
tint or color measure. It is the invention
of J. W. Lovibond, who has devoted some
twenty years of work and thought to the
perfection of the contrivance, which, hav
ing been in use more or less privately for
seven or eight years past in many tech
nical industries, and for various special
purposes, has now been taken over by a
company and placed on the market. To
the man in the street probably the uses
of a contrivance of this nature seem
scarcely very obvious at first sight.
This only shows how little the man
in the street knows about the mat
ter. For the uses of the tintometer are
i believed to be nearly endless. This will
| be realized when it is borne in mind that
in the ease of practically evcrv substance,
natural or manufactured, known to man
color is an absolute index of its quality.
Consequently you have only to ascertain
its color exactly in order to know at once
I the quality of the substance you are deal
ing with. And this is what the tintometer
enables you to do. Take flour. 'Inequality
of Hour can be told to a nicety by its color.
Hence you have only to ascertain the posi
: tion of any given specimen of flour in the
I coior scale to know its value. "But how
â¢ about adulteration?" some one will ask at
| once; "cannot an inferior flour be colored
j by the addition of some foreign substance
to match the shade desired?"" Certainly it
can be, but the tintometer would detect
the fraud at once.
What, then, is the tintometer? Briefly,
it consists of a carefully graded series of
colored glassesâ about the size and shape
of small microscope slidesâ by means of
which, used singly or superimposed one
on top of the other, any desired shade or
color can be matched "with absolute ex
actitude. And wh-n it is realized that
there are just 60,000.000 shades which can
be obtained in this fashion it will be
j understood that the color which cannot
! be matched by the tintometer must be
very hard to find, indeed. In point of
fact, there is no color or tint perceptible to
the ordinary human eye which cannot
be obtained. These slips of glass are
; placed on a slide at the end of a double
parallel-sided wooden tube, something
like an elongated stereoscope to look at,
I with two sm:>.ll apertures at the lower end
and eyepieces to look through at the
upper. The substance to be matched is
placed under the one aperture, and then,
by changing the slips of glaÂ«3 to the re
! quired extent beneath the other, the de
sired tint is readily obtained.âWest

A XEff STYLE OF CRAFT.
Side wheel Pleasure Yacht Propelled by
Gasoline.
A small pleasure craft, constructed on a
new system of propulsion, and intended
for navigation in unusually shallow wa
ters, has just been built for Dr. J. Cutler
of Boston by the Daimler Motor Company,
says the New York Herald. She is a flat
bottomed boat with a wooden hull, built
with a keel so that she may be the more
easily steered. Her length is 39 feet, beam
S feet, and draught It! inches. Sh â¢is a
side-wheeler, the wheels being made of
wrought iron and her paddles of wood.
Placed in the center of tne boat is a
motor, operated by gasoline, which is of
seven horse power, weighs S4U pounds, and
is capable of making 540 revolutions per
minute, producing a speed of between
nine and ten miles per hour.
This little boat is named the Priscilla,
and is intended to be used by Dr. Cutler in
the vicinity of Hey West, Via., where he
frequently passes the winter months. An
awning can be erected in the forward part
of the craft, while there is a cabin aft,
where passengers can iind refuge in wet or
Btormy weather.
The'Priscilla was shipped to Key West
on Saturday by steamer.
STOIIY OF A FIKE-HOKSE.
Kansas City's Dead Veteran <>f the De
partment Is Mounted.
Not a great many years ago a team of
milk-white horses drey: a packing-house
wacon through the streets of Kansas City.
j They were the pride of the driver, a
I brawny Irishman, who had a Kentuck,,
ian's regard for the horse, and they at
tracted the admiration of all who saw
them. Tire Chief Hale was attracted to
the horses, and purchased them in ISS7
for $500. The aorEes were installed at lire
headquarters and named Joe and Dan for
Jo=eph McGuire and Daniel Donovan.
They were inteilisrent animals, and took
to the fire service with remarkable aptitude.
In a comparatively short time they were
by far the swiftest horses in the depart
ment. It was common for them in re
sponding to an alarm to be in their places,
hitcned and away before any of the other
teams had been latched.
When Chief Hale attended the Interna
tional Firemen's Convention in London in
1893 he toot Joe and Dan along to se; the
pace for all the competing companies.
How nobly these animals performed their
taÂ»k has been written in a dozen lan
guages and their incredible time 11-5 sec
onds for hitching, made at this conven
tion, has not been overcome. All Londou
was astounded over the achievement of
Joe and Dan and Chief Hale's firemen.
I Many flattering offers for the team were
! received by thrChief from wealthy British
i ers, but he rejected all offers and would
â  listen to no overtures for their purehaÂ«e.
Joe and Dan's London achievement en
deared them to the hearts of the people of
I Kansas City. Among the objects of inter
est shown to visiting strangers was this
team of horses.
There was an alarm of iire on June 6,
1593, and in a jiffy Joe and Dan were clat
tering over the streets in front of hose
company No. 2. They dashed down
Eleventh street and collided r.t a dead run
with a cable train at Main street. They
struck a gripcar and their momentum
forced them into the car, breaking the
side supports into splinters. The horses
were extricated from the car and returned
to the station. Three days later it was
discovered thit in the collision a splinter
had penetrated Joe's right hind hoof.
Lockjaw resulted and he hud to be shot.
A fund was taken up for the purpose of
mounting his hide.
And noV Joe is at fire headquarters
again. As nnturai as life, he stands in an
upper hallway, wearing iiie same harness
he wore when, with Dan, the world's
record was made in London. Joe was
mounted by Professor E. D. Eames, the tax
idermist, of Lawrence, Kas. He was
brought to the city as a Christmas sur
prise to the firemen. All forenoon and
afternoon people called at the department
I eadquarters to see Joe. Many placed
flowers on him and stroked his sleek hide.
At first sight it is difficult to realize that
Joe 13 not the noble horse of old, waiting
for the firebsll tap to dart beneath the
swinging harness. â Chicago Record.

OTOTYFREE
A Practical Test of the Matchless
Chronic Disease Treatment.
Free to All \Vho Call in Person at the
Offices of the Copeland Medical In-
stitute, 916 Market Street.
To enable all to obtain some definite under-
standing of their new system of chronic dis-
ease treatment and to test its great practical
advantages over all other methods Drs. Cope,
land, Neal and Winn offer to all sufferers from
Catarrh or other curable chronic maladies a
trial treatment free. Kemember, that all who
apply in person will now be cordially welcome
to a careful examination, advice and treat-
ment, upon their first visit, absolutely free of
charge.
Chronic diseases are diseases that have been
allowed to become old or of lone standing be-
cause of carelessness and negligoncc on the
part of the patient, or inability o '.he family
physician to cure in the acute or early stages.
Chronic diseases in themselves, as a general
rule, are not speedily fatal, but they are more
or less insidious, and' if allowed to run on un-
dermine the general health and strenpth of the
patient and produce a liability to take on more
dangerous diseases by exposure to such weather
as we are now experiencing.
Chronic diseases require treatment directly
opposite to that of acute diseases, and the at-
tention of doctors specially trained and spe-
cially equipped for that purpose. Drs. Cope-
land, Neal and Winn have devoted years of ex-
clusive attention to the treatment of this clans
of diseases, and feel that they have attained a
scientific mastery over them. Four years in
one location, during which time they nave
treated over 15,000 patients, is a record to bo
proud of.
POLYPI PAINLESSLY REMOVED.
The Experience of Mrs. A. M. Rudolph
of Oakluud. t
Mrs. A. M. Rudolph, whose portrait is given
beiow, and who lives at 1471 Fifth street, Oak-
land, is a lady who is well and favorably
known in that city. She says:
\ Mrs. A. M. 1U:d01ph,14.71 Fifth st., CaKLAHD.
My trouble commenced some twelve year 3
ago. It began with catarrh, the result ot neg-
lected cold ; this brought on a polypus growth
in my nostrils. My nostrils gradually stopped
up, and for years I could not breathe through
them, compelling me to keep my mouth open
all the time. I lost my appetite; could not
sleep; ran down in flesh and strength, and was
thoroughly miserable. I went to many doc-
tors, but could not obtain relief. Iwas'afrairt
of their barbarous methods of removing tha
tumors. I had read so much of the Oopeland
Medical Institute, and one day read of a case
exactly like mine. I then went to them and
placed my case in their (care. They removed
the tumors painlessly and without loss of
blond ; the relief at once was worth a hundred
times what it cost. I can now breathe through
my nostrils freely and feel better in everyway.
I want every one to know the great good Drs.
Copeland, Neal and Winn have done for me,
and am only too glad to add my testimony in
their favor.
Parties desiring to test the excellence
of the new treatment for chronic dis-
eases are welcome to v trial treatment
without charge on applying in person.
A CARD TO PHYSICIANS.
\ Drs. Copeland, Neal and Winn desire to ex-
press their sincere thanks to the many family
physicians of San Francisco who are in the
habit of turning over to their care such of
their patients as may be suffering from mala-
dies of a chronic character. Deeply sensible of
such manifestation of continued confidence in
their system, they take this means to convey
to them, in return, their assurance of unabated
and untiring effort on behalf of every suffering
invalid committed to their charge, the fee, in
all cases, to continue strictly nominal as here-

THE MONROE DOCTRINE AND
ENGLAND'S PACIFIC TEMPER
by "w. o. */co:r,:r,o"w\
Those gentle Axnericans who are tear- !
fully pleading for peace bring a wide and j
illuminating smile to the grim face of the
British lion. It any question of interna
tional policy between that country and j
the United States could precipitate a war
it would be because England has taken
leave of the ancient sanity that lias en
abled it to plant its flag on the four cor
ners of the earth.
'â¢I rofessors' and "students" of that in
definite thing called "international law"
have been pestering the public ear with
raucous declarations that the Monroe doc
trine is not an element of international
Jaw, but purely an American policy, and
some of us, accepting that silly dictum, are |
aslirmin;: that we can make it interna- I
tional law at the point of the bayonet.
The essence of the- Monroe doctrine is as
old as the division of mankind into sep
arate tribes. It is merely clouded at pres
ent under the shadow of a local name.
Let us give an illustration of its necessity
and universality. Suppose that an English
colony should establish itself in Switzer
land, m time differences between the
colonists and tr:<> Swiss might develop and
England might send an army into the
country t.i " protect the rights" of its citi
eens. What would Europe do? The na
tions would at nr.ee realize the fact that
tzerland wo nquered because
it was weak and that England could
mand a considerable part of the territory
i mnity <>; war. Would the nations
submit? That is the Monroe
doctrine. They would object because such
â¢ would >et a powerful foreigner at
their gatesâ a fureigner whose sole aim
and abiding necessity are conquest and
extension of territory. It is the spirit of
the Monroe doctrine that makes it pos-
Mble for weak nations to exist.
At the time when President Monroe pro
mulgated his so-called doctrine there was
tor it than now. It seems to
- m the presumption that
th of the isthmus of Pan
ama was part of the country which we in
habit, and on the fear that European oc
ition of that territory might prove a
menace to t lie safety of our Government â
that it might render easy an armed inva
sion of our country. Since that time there
come about a strengthening of the
principle that it is the duty of the great
.!>â¢ of the Western Hemisphere to
protect republicanism on the continent.
With the exception of a control of trans
isthmian transportation that is the only
reason to-day for our insistence upon the
Monroe doctrine; and it was after Presi
dent Monroe's declaration that we per
jmtted French capital to secure control ot
a transisthmian railroad and attempt tne
construction of the Panama canal. Those
far mere urgent occasions tor iv.sist
ing upon the enforcement of the doctrine
than that which is presented in tne Ven
ezuelan boundary dispute. Our National
is even now hesitating to foster
the Nicaragua canal, knowing that this
would be the grossest neglect of the Mori
roe doctrine, and would turn over to Eng
land the last hope of our control over isth
mian transportation. The Venezuelan
matter sinks into insignificance when com
pared with the Nicaragua canal.
In a geographical sense, the countries of
Central and South America are no more
'sisters" than are the countries of
Europe. The only thing that mates them
our sisters is the fact that they are repub-
In that sense they are "no more our
sisters than France and* Switzerland. If
the form of government maintained by
those two countries should be threatened
by other powers, it would be just as much
our duty to go to their support as to that
of any Central or South American republic.
Viewed in that light, the Monroe doctrine
takes on the aspect of wisdom ami the
spirit of a noble cause.
If commercial reasons be considered as
elements of the doctrine, we have already
stultified it by permitting England practi
cally to monopolize the commerce of the
southern countries. England's armies in
those countries would be no menace to us
at aIL Her battle-shir>3 in the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans might be a serious
menace. But her merchant ships, which
take the commerce of the southern coun
tries, are the greatest menace of all, and
yet they give us no concern whatever. In
view of our neglect of this aspect of the
we have less reason than any nation
of Europe for insisting on the Monroe
doctrine.
This does not mean to say that we have |
not "the right to insist upon it. but merely
to contend that in Mich insistence we must
be ridiculous it we are not consistent and !
iugb.
The reason for England's aggressiveness j
in extending her empire is the necessity of j
securing control or possession of produc- j
Ing countries. This is explained on the I
id that the soil of England cannot '
support as population. That country is.
constantly reaching out for material which
i lay manufacture and sell to the !
world. The reason why our country lias
no such policy of aggression and acquisi
tion is that it is rich in native resources, '
capable of supporting a population vastly i
greater than that which it has. We oblig- i
mgly forward England's purpose by sup- '
plying it with articles of our production
and then buying them back from England j
in a. manufactured form, thus supplying
England's ribs and ammunition to us
gui>s. Even here in California we are i
crowing apricots and sending them to j
Crosse iV Blackwell, paying transportation '
charges over 12,000 miles and a profit to
the manufacturers, as we use Crossed
Blackwell'B California apricot marmalade
on our tallies. By making American prod
ucta nec< ssary to English prosperity we
are manufacturing reasons why England
would like very much to regain possession
of <>ur own territory. A war with that !
country would cure us of this magnificent \
folly.
Not being essentially a manufacturing
country, as England is, we are not so '
vitally concerned as, is England over the j
control of Central and South American
commerce. Nevertheless we do maiuifac- :
ture for foreign markets. In certain man- :
ufactured products, including the very im
portant one of agricultural implements,
we far surpass England in excellence; and
as the agricultural countries of the world
are rapidly advancing in the art of soil
cultivation the demand for our agricul
tural implements is heavy and increasing.
That is to say, that while the products of
the southern countries are not so vital to :
us as to England our foreign market is ex- i
ccedin.ly important, and would be lost if !
England .should be permitted to have its j
lull way in the south. That is a sufficient |
reason lor us to uphold what we are pleased j
to term the Monroe doctrine.
And we can uphold it without any fear :
of resistance from England. A declara- |
tion of war would mean the rebellion of |
Jreland, French assistance of the Atneri- !
r:iii cause, the spreading of Russian BWaj
over Turkey and India and the consolida
tion of all the republics of the Western !
Hemisphere to resist English (and lor that j
matter Euroj)ean) encroachment. We ;
have the most extensive coast line in the i
world, and in Bpiteof England's splendid
fleet it would not be sufficient, considering
the menaces which exist at home, to over- j
cuiiK- the handful of lighting-ships and j
the popgun forts that 'â¦protect' 1 our coast, i
â \Ve nave no frontier to guard except the!
Canadian, anÂ«l that would not count in I
view of our opportunity to seize Canada â 
ai.d its ports.
For that juatter it might provea blessed j
thing for ne ii the incredible task of sub- j
duinz our coast by any single power I
.should be accomplished. It would drive j
us into the interior, where no earthly force ,
could conquer us, and where we would I
have to develop the splendid resources ;
Which He dormant in both our soil and our I
people. A blockade imposed by England
on our commerce would have almost as
good an effect. Besides compelling us to
<i. veloD our native resources, it would
anneal our people by making them
patriots, and so would elevate to the
loftiest point the standard of American
citizenship. "We might then burn our
criminal codes and turn our penitentiaries
into schools anil factories.
The very fact that a clamor has arisen
on the scorn of danger to American secur
ities held in England in the event of war
presents a deplorable condition of affairs.
< Mi railroad securities alone we are paying
England an interest of $100,000,000 a year,
and that is Only a drop in the big bucket
of the English drain on American re
sources. A war between England and the
United States would take bread out of the
mouths of millions of Englishmen where
it would hurt a score of Americans.
Withdraw from England the products of
American industry and soil, und Russia
and France would know what to do with
India, P^gypt, the Suez canal and the
traflic of the Orient, and they would know
how to fill the vacancies created by the
withdrawal of English warships detailed
to subdue the American coast.
However beneficial the money of Eng
land has been in assisting to develop the
resources of this country, it is none tne
less responsible for much fictitious de
velopment and its accompanying frauds.
England is essentially under the domina
tion of money-lenders. This explains all
vhe features of its policy that make Eng
land the money-lender for the nations.
Its necessary policy is to advance as much
money as possible in the development of
the resources and industries of new coun
tries for the purpose of niakina the inter
ests thus created and stimulated serve as
factors in determining the national policies
of the countries receiving the benefit.
Knowing so well within its own experi
ence the value and power of money, Eng
land wishes this power to be felt in every
country so unwise as to accept its services.
It is a shame that English money is
now talking to Americans in this Venezue
lan controversy. If we admit that this
country's private interests would be in
jured by war with England to the extent
at least that the value of American securi
ties would be depressed and many im
portant American industries ruined, then
we confess that the money barons of Eng
land nave a hand in the direction of our
National policy, and that their influence
is being exerted to fasten upon us the con
ditions under which the hopeless poor of
England are groaning. It would be better
for this country to wipe from its map
every railroad "built with English capital
than have the power of English money
interfering with the destiny of our Nation.
There will be no war unless we open an
eager and aggressive campaign of actual
hostilities. An Englishman will light and
die like a man if he must do so in defense
of his pride, but still he is the sanest mor
tal that walks the earth. And he h*s quit
lighting wars on sentimental grounds. He
has progressed too far in civilization for
that. He will be perfectly satisfied to eat
a little bumble pie while cailing it an ex
cellent article of diet, and declaring that it
was just what his consitution and appe
tite required, so long as he knows that our
fear of losins; iiis money will send us into
a panic, and so long as we are blind to the
enormous power which he exercises over
the vital concerns which we innocently
imagine we are controlling.
CHETWOOD MAKES REPLY
Strikes Back at Soap King
Thomas and at Bank
Agent Stateler.
An Old Resolution of the California
National Bank Directors
Put on Record.
Special Trustee John Chetwood Jr. of
the California National Bank has replied
by affidavits to the strictures made upon
him in the United States Circuit Court
some time ago by Attorney Robert B.
Mitchell, on behalf of himself and Thomas
K. Statele-.
In his answer to Mr. Chetwood's bill of
complaint in the injunction suit against
Stateler the latter made statements re
flecting on the integrity of the complain
ant, and charging him with having
practically misappropriated $0000 of the
$27 â â > judgment obtained fr m Bank
Directors Wilson and Thompson. At
torney Mitchell also informed Judge Me-
Kenna that Mr. Chetwood was Insolvent
and "an unlit man' 1 to have the business
of the bank in charge.
One allegation in particular made by
A . i at StateJer in his affidavit and Attor
ney .Mitchell was that Chetwood was carry
ing on the litigation for the benefit of his
own personal interests, so as to absorb all
the funds in sight, and this they tried to
support by a specific charge that he had
secured $!)000 as attorney's fees.
To meet these statements Mr. Chetwood
has filed reoly affidavits with Clerk Costi
gan. From these documents it would
appear as though Mr. Chetwood had the
corporation and bona-tide stoCKboldera
with him. He sets forth in one of the
documents the following resolution passed
i y the directors after Soap King Thomas
voted Stateler in as a ent :
Whbbeas, R. P. Thomas, late president of
this corporation, la Indebted to it in the sum
of $200,000, or thereabouts, for damages suf
fered by the corporation owing to his gross
negligence and misconduct In administering
its attairs, and is trying to evade payment of
said indebtedness, rh<l i* conducting or in-
Bpirine litigation hostile to the corporation;
and, whereas, one T. K. Stateler claims to be
ftK-T.t i>f the stockholders of the corporation;
but, whereas, said Stateler was unduly and
illegally elected, and has no valid right to the
office of agent, and is aiding said Thomas in
his said litigation against the corporation;
now, therefore, be it
r/rt. That this corporation do oppose the
schemes, BUita and proceedings of said Thomas
and .-ri.teler and those connected with them;
and in particular, be it
Beaolved, That the corporation endeavor to
outt and remove Stateler, and the president of
the corporation is hereby directed to institute
such legal measures to oarry out the object of
this resolution as may be desirable in the
premises.
In answer to the charge that Chetwood's
motives are selfish, and that he has not
taken the stockholders into his contidence
and is not indorsed by them, it is alleged
that all the steps and purposes of the lit
igation have been explained to them, so
far as practicable, and that they have all
expressed their hearty sympathy with the
litigation and some of them have offered
their assistance. The charge of insolvency
is utterly denied.
Stockholders Holt, Noyes and Nigcle
have appended affidavits* to that of Mr.
Chetwood. They state that they are ac
quainted with the various suits against
Thomas Stateler, are convinced that
therein Chetwood has acted for "'the best
interests of the stockholders, and with an
eye to their welfare in every re
spect," and adi that he deserves
"the gratitude and good will of
all the stockholders, especially in
the efforts to collect the original judgment
against Thomas, in face of thi bitter oppo
sition of T. K. Stateler, who claims to be
agent, of the stockholders," but whom,
affiants say, they "believe to be faithless
to their interests and acting wholly con
trary to their wishes." Affiants further
aver that they are advised of the compen
sation which Chetwood expects, and that
THF SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 5, 1896.
it is very moderate and quite satisfactory
to them.
Referring to this compensation and the
$9000 attorneys' fees already received, the
main athdavit recites that the three de
fendants in the original suit owned about
live-sixths of the stock, and cannot get
any of the $27,500. So it is claimed that
the oilier stockholders will receive as much
as if about $70,00U had been collected and
all the stockholders had shared, wherefore
the compensation already received is said
to be extremely reasonable. Chetwood
further declares that his compensation
will be the same whether the litigation
ends to-morrow or lasts ten years, so he
can have no motive to prolong it.
The matter will probably be argued some
time this month.

Between January and June, 1894, Mrs.
Macdonald's residence was entered by
burglars while the family was absent from
the City. About $500 worth of jewelry
was stolen. Since then the police have
been working on the case without success.
A few days ago Mrs. Macdonald alleges
she recognized a diamond pin, one of the
articles stolen, in Franklin's pawnshop on
Market street, hence the application for
the search warrant.
RIFLED HIS TROUSERS
Jeremiah McCormack, a Coal-
Dealer, Lost His Day's
Collections.
k Daring Burglar Entered the Room
Where McCormack Slept and
Made a Big Haul.
A daring burglary was reported at police
headquarters yesterday morning, and as a
good description of the operator has beer,
obtained the detectives expect to have him
under arrest soon.
Between 5 and 6 o'clock the lodging
boose of Mrs. Jennie Handiey, mother of
the late Detective Handiey, was entered.
The burglar apparently had a particular
object in view, as lie made direct for the
room occupied by Jeremiah McCormack,
coal-dealer at 917 O'Farrell street. Mc-
CormacK had collected several large ac
counts the previous day and had the
money, about $230, in the pockets of his
trousers, which lay on a chair near his
bed.
McCormack must be a sound sleeper, as
the noise made by the burglar in entering
his room and abstracting the money from
the pockets of his trousers did not disturb
him.
The burglar effected an entrance by forc
ing open the parlor window, and made his
exit by the same way. He was observed
coming stealthily out of the window and
across the grass plat in front of the bouse
by a passer-by, who gave ciiaso, shouting
as he ran for the i>oiice, but the burglar
was too good a sprinter and effected his
escape.
When McCormack awoke in the morn
ing ami discovered his loss he hurriedly
dressed himself and reported his loss at pol
ice headquarters. The man who cbased
the burglar was able to give a good de
scription of him to McCormack and the
police were notified of it. The description
was read to the different "watches" yester
day and they were asked to kerp a sharp
lookout for the burglar and arrest him.
Et is thought that from the fact that no
other room was entered the burglar must
have known that McCormack had taken
the money home in his pockets.

TO HANDLE LARGE GUNS
How Troops of the National
Guard Should Be In
structed.
HEAVY ARTILLERY PRACTICE.
The Country Needs a Properly Trained
Reserve Force of Artil
lerymen.
A trained reserve to the regular forces
of a country is as necessary to the safety
of that country as are the regular forces
themselves. This axiom, obtaining as it
particularly does in our own country,
where ii is the boast that the maintenance
of a large standing army is not in con
formity with the spirit of American insti
tutions, would seem to indicate the neces
sity of every enersry being directed to the
formation of a trained reserve or, more
properly speaking, support to the heavy
or seacoast artillery arm of the regular ser
vice. lam free to admit that we are en
deavoring to accomplish this with regard
to an infantry, and in a measure cavalry
and field artillery reserve, but does it not
seem that we are somewhat criminally
THL NATIONAL GUARD SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO HANDLE IJKi GU>S.
negligent in our inattention to the great
necessity that exists of training at least a
part of our National Guard in this sea
coast State in a knowledge of coast defense?
In some of the States this is being done,
notably in Connecticut, where the Govern
ment has erected batteries with ordnance
in position for the instruction of the State
troops, and where already a fair measure
of success has been attained. The troops
of Connecticut are not only instructed in
the handling of ordnance and in the use
and care of artillery material, but also in
the use of instruments for sighting and
platting and vessel-tracking and in target
practice, using solid shot and plaster
shells tiiled with light explosive cbartres.
The First Regiment of Massachusetts
Volunteer Militia has recently performed
its animal tour of duty at Fort Warren,
Boston narbor. Out of presumably 10C0
men in three battalions T-'J'i went into
camp at Fort Warren, the field and staff
living in the casemates, line officers and
the men under canvas. During the tour of
six days one battalion was daily assigned
to guard duty, another to infantry drill,
and the third to work at the guns.
The regular officers at the tort were con
stituted a hoard to award prizes for excel
lence in gunnery, one of which was offered
by the Governor oi the State and one by the
field and staff of the First Regiment. That
good results were obtained may be judged
trom the following report of the merit of
the companies at artillery target practice,
the mean absolute deviation from the tar
tret being: P 32.75, X 40, C 13, L .V.. 05, A
56.07, I 62.75, G 73.7,3. E 70.05, B 80.25. M
82.60, D L 05.50, II 173.75 yards. In others
of the seacoast States facilities are afforded
the National Guard of acquiring a knowl
edge oi coast defense that may some day
be of inestimable importance to such sea
coast State*. Here in California we are
(loin- nothing in this direction. Our State
has an extensive coast line, in many parts
vulnerable and all as yet inadequately pro
tected, fchon n the approved project for the
defense oi San Francisco harbor includes
eighty-two guns, ranging from six to
twelve inches in caliber, and lit twelve
inch mortars, besides submarine mines
operated from mining casemates. Now
when all these are in position who is going
to man them in case of war? The artil
lery of the army ?
It has been stated by an eminent artiller
ist that if ail of the heavy artillery of the
army and the National Guard of the
1 nited States were concentrated at New
Yon; City there would still be necessary
5000 more men to properly man the de
fenses of New York harbor alone. No!
though the heavy artillery of the army
will doubtless be largely augmented, it fs
upon the National Guard of the seacoast
Siates that the defense of their State and
country will devolve when the time comes
when we will, fortunately or unfortunately,
be engaged in war. It is, therefore, high
time that we in California were awaken
ing to a realization oi the great responsi
bility, that any time may be ours, so that
when we are tried we may not be found
wanting. Let us therefore hasten to place
some ot our troops in a position to receive
this verj' necessary instruction.
Let us gather together some of the
young men of our guard â of our City â
preferably mechanics, young men who
have an acquaintance with machinery,
with mathematics, young men whose
daily vocations cause them to be familiar
with the different forms of machines, and
the powers of steam and electricity. These
would make an ideal force, and a force
that would be proud and willing to serve
their State in an arm of the service that
would bring into action the intelligence
that they possess in a marked degree, and
which is so necessary to the efficient artil
leryman.
It may have been possible in the past, in
the day of the now obsolete smooth
bore with its simple form of carriage, to
be able, within a few days, to train "State
troops so that they could man and serve
guns; for the day of the smoothbore was
also the day of comparatively slow steam
communication, and there "might have
been time to accomplish the formation of
a reserve, but it is different now.
Immense strides have been made in ord
nance and the science of gunnery; princi
ples are involved to-day that "were not
thought of a few years ago. necessitating
that the personnel of the artillery shall be
superior in intelligence to what is required
of any other branch of the service, with
possibly the exception of the engineers.
The present time of swift steam communi
cation, the declaration of war being almost
immediately followed by the actual open
ing of hostilities, requires that we will
have our reserve ready, and not unformed
entirely or in course of Dreparation. The
necessity of having such a force should
appeal to all having the safety
of the country at heart; it would
seem that even laymen would un
derstand the necessity of having a sec
ond line, unless there be still some among
us imbued with the ancient and hap
piiy now almost exploded idea that be
cause we are Americans and have once
licked somebody we are necessarily in
vincible.
The Government is placing heavy guns
in position to command the approaches to
our harbor, but we have no troops in our
National Guard that could serve and tire
them with the possibility of striking a
stationary, let alone a movable, target. If,
as stated by General Flagler, Ordnance
Department, United States army, the pro
ject for the defense of the country involves
an expenditure of forty-eight millions of
dollars in the purchase and manufacture
of great guns, mortars, torpedoes, etc., is
it well to place in charge of these an un
trained force, which through inexperience
would cause more injury to the appliances
for defense than would the guns of the
enemy?
When war is declared (possibly it may
never be, but sometimes it is well to deal
with remote contingencies) there will be
no time for drill, no time to study even
first principles, no time to select the* young
men of the National Guard who will "be the
best adapted for this work; and when we
shall want our artillery reserve we shall
want them like the * man from Texas
wanted the gun.
in California we are not training our
troops in the nature of defense that is
needed. Do we not know from what is
daily occurring in other parts of the world
and that has occurred thai "a nation un
prepared to defend itself is most exposed
to the encroachment; and aguressions o
i hostile powers?" I think we do. And we
also know or should know that "the surest
i guarantee of peace is the power of a nation
| to resist invasion and punish aggression."'
; Let us see what professional opinion is in
! tliis matter. And should we not defer to
, the. professional soldier, to those who are
! interested in the National Guard and to
I those who know that the National Guard
: is the true standing army of the country?
In the indorsement of the staff of the ar
[ tillery school on Major Tidbali's "Manual
â of Heavy Artillery' it is stated '"that it
; (the manual) is probably invaluable for
; the instruction of militia artillery, upon
j whom in any war the defense of the coun
try will largely devolve, and whose atten
i tion should undoubtedly be directed to
I heavy artillery instruction in time of peace
| and not to held artillery merely, as is now
! the custom."
The report of the general commanding
the army embodies the following with
respect to the reorganization of the regu
lar artillery and infantry : He says: "The
strength of infantry, cavalry and field
artillery forces which might "be required
in war with n foreign power does not ad
mit of a very accurate estimate in advance.
Not so in respect to the seacoast artillery.
War with any considerable maritime na
tion would require that all the seacoast
defenses of this country be fully manned.
The force requisite for this purpose has
been very accurately estimated at &j,OOO
men, while the peace garrisons estimated
as necessary for the care of these defenses
and instruction of th" militia reserves is
only 4200 men, or not more than one-twen
tieth of the war garrisons. Nineteen
twentieth 9 of the war garrisons must be
drawn from the locai militia, Manifestly
a considerable portion of this artillery re
serve should receive some instruction in
time of peace. Hence, attention is again
directed to the importanc â¢ of organizing
in the seacoast States an artillery reserve,
to be instructed annually in connection
with the regular seacoast garrisons.
Measures in this direction have already
been adopted in some of the States, and
these should be extended throughout all
the States bordering on the oceans and the
gulf."
Lieutenant Mclver, late inspector of the
National Guard of California, recom
mends in his report "the maintenance in
i San Francisco of a four-company bat
i talion, to be uniformed and designated as
! artillery, and which in addition to being
drilled as infantry shall receive as far as
practicable instruction in the handling of
: heavy guns. The value of such a force as
lan auxiliary to the regular artillery in
I case of war Is well recognized. The con
i venient proximity of the forts forming the
j defenses of the harbor of San Francisco
I and the excellent material in the City for
I such a force seem to be favorable condi
i tions." General Gay V. Henery, special
I inspector of the National Guard of the
I State of New York, recommends: "One or
I more regiments for service with heavy
j artillery guns should be a part of the
: National Guard."
Many other officers of the army, among
them the officers of the Fifth Artillery,
stationed at the Presidio, have from time
to time urged the necessity of the forma
tion of a reserve to man our defenses in
case the regular garrison be withdrawn
and ordered to other duty or to provide
for casualties occurring to the regular
force.
In conclusion I quote from an article
that appeared in the Western Soidier of
June, IS9I, written by an ex-regular army
artilleryman, which is apropos. He says:
"An artillery soldier's duty does not sim
ply consist of knowing how to load and iire
a big gun. Supposing he is sent to a fort
where the guns are lying about in all direc
tions, their carriages upset and broken; he
must be capable of taking hold, shifting
his guns from broken to serviceable car
riages, dismounting some and mounting
others. All this is not to be learned in an
hour or a day, and the time to prepare for
the contingency above hinted at is not
when it might occur in time of war, but in
time of peace; that is now !"
If the foregoing somewhat loosely con
nected remarks will in any manner cause
authorities to arrange for the early forma
tion of California's artillery reserve I will
be amply repaid. John A. Miller,

Assured.
RAILWAY OFFICIALS ARE SEEN.
Much Enthusiasm Among Local White
Ribboners Regarding the Fu
ture Assemblage.
There is much rejoicing; amonz the mem
bers of the Woman's Christian Temper
ance Union of this City over the announce
ment made in a recent letter from Miss
Frances E. Willard, their honored leader,
that the next annual convention of the
National organization will be held in Cali
fornia.
Miss Willard says:
Our next convention is to be held in Califor
nia, and each State and Territory, I am sure,
will wish to be at its very best when we go to be
the puests o( our brave pioneer workers on the
Pacilic Const.
Continuing, she says in the same com
munication, which is a letter to Mrs. B.
Sturtevant Peet, president of the Califor
nia Woman's Christian Temperance
Union:
The Baltimore convention and my enormous
correspondence indicate that the pulse of our
blessed movement is steadfest and strong as
ever. Indeed, it seems to me to have gained in
momentum, and I expect this to be one of the
best years, if not the beat, in our history thus
far. There is zeal for the increase of our
membership, which must always beâ next to
the indwelling of the Spiritâ the basis of the
progress we so earnestly desire.
The oflicers of local unions will interview
railroad officials soon with a view to se
curing satisfactory rates for visitors to the
convention, which will be held in the early
fall, and in all probability in this City.
FIGHTING THE FAIR WILL.
The Executory of the Lost Testament
Reply to Lute Contests.
W. iS. Gootlfellow, Louis C. Bresse, James
?. Angus and Thomas (i. Crothers have
filed motions to dismiss and demurrers to
the contests of the stolen Fair will filed
recently by Marc Livingston and the
Board of Teachers' Retirement Fund Com
missioners.
It is alleged in both motions and de
murrers ihat the contests filed do not state
facts Millic-ient for cause of action, and
that neither contestant has the legal
capacity to oppose the probate of the will.
In Levingston's case it is also alleged that
he is not a party interested, and against
the fund commissioners it is claimed they
have no legal existence. It is further
alleged that the contests were not filed
within the statutory time.
The motions and demurrers will be heard
before Judge Slack "on January 10.

American securities abroad. Prices here rose

WOOLâ The circular of Jacob Wollner says:
' "The sales of Wool during tlie holiday week were
j very large and over 2,000,000 lbs of Wool were
i so!d, mostly defective. Prices reullzed for defec
tive stock were from ay-tC lo 6c; rree Wool irom
6c to 8c; about 200, 0C0 its of Oregon from Â»yoc to
120 : In fact, we never bad such a market durfiig a
holiday week or tbc last wcelc iv the year. A fair
I amount of scoured Wool was also disposed of on
: Eastern orders, but still the Eastern markets are
; reported quiet with no advaace. The buying here
i was inosly speculative with the exception of one
! local mill, which took abont 1500 Dales of defective
Wool. Holders were ready sellers. According to
i reports prices pÂ«id here would not have becd real
ized in the Eastern markets."

CLOSE OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONVENTION.
Teachers Discuss the Phys

Pupils.
A PLEA FOR FRESH AIR.
Masterly Address by David
Starr Jordan of Stanford
University.
RESOLUTIONS ARE ADOPTED.
All Participants Agree That the Con
gress of Pedagogues Was
a Success.
Not until next year will the Cal
ifornia Teachers' Association meet again
in annual session. The closing ses
sions yesterday were more largely
attended than any of the preced
ing meetings, many of Oakland's fore
most society leaders being present. The
commodious auditorium of the First Con
gregational Church was filled to repletion,
many persons being obliged to stand
throughout the interesting exercises.
The morning session opened with the
reading of an essay by T. I). Wood of Palo
Alto, who took for his subject, "Hygiene
in Education," and displayed much
healthy indignation against that mis
guided spirit of false public economy
which would sacrifice the health and per
haps even the lives of countless school
children rather than spend a small por
tion of the public funds in rendering
schortlbuiidings habitable from a sanitary
point of view.
"Children," he continued, "are sent to
school too young. The hours of school
are too long. Frequently the children are
sent home to do school work at ni<;ht.
There is too littie activity to the elemental
muscles. From one-third to one-fourth of
the time should be devoted to healtn ex
ercises. Gymnastics should be encour
aged. The child should be examined
physically when entering school. The
teacher should understand the method of
growth of the child and understand its
organism. It is not an easy thing to
teach well. Hygienic education means
that a child shall be taught to take care of
itself, ii does not mean that human phy
siology should be taught in the lower
grades. A hi<rb ideal of manhood and
womanhood should be held out to the
â¢youth of both sexes. It should not be for
gotten that any educational system which
practically ignores the health of the child
ib radically defective."
Miss Carrie B. Palmer of the Oakland
High School read an interesting paper on
"The Physical Training of (jirls." She
treated her subject in a most thoughtlul
and comprehensive manner, while the
earnest, convincing tone in which she
pleaded her cause showed plainly that she
was thoroughly imbued with the idea that
the wives and mothers of the future are
more or less neglected under the present
educational systems.
"The more advanced educators," said
Miss Palmer, "are agreed in demanding

I feet health, and hygiene thoroughly taught
I so as to render the child capable of caring
: for itself. Without perfect bodily health
; there can be no perfect mental health.
Teachers should not deceive themselves
| by looking on the gymnasium as illustra
tive of perfect hygiene. By the time the
high school is reached to give girls grym
: nastic training it is nearly impossible to
I do so.
"The girl's time out of school is spent at '
i the piano, sewing or in recreations not '
j always healthful. Under such conditions !
i the girl's physical education must be un
dertaken. \\ hen people are told what the
new system of physical education means
; they are not always able to appreciate it.
lit is claimed by some that the girls can
get all the exercise they need at home, j
Siuh exercise, however, is not physical
training. Others hold that gymnastics
ought to be considered a recreation. Such,
however, is not the case. If good results
are to be obtained they must be got to
work the same as in any other study. The
public school is the o"nly place in which
the scholar could receive perfect education.
When people are made to understand the
necessities, physical as well as mental,
of the child then we shall see the dawning
of the day of perfect education."
Another important paper was read by
J. \V. McClvmonds on "'The Samtarv
Construction of School Buildings." His
remarks were illustrated by diagrams,
Which he sketched on a blackboard as he
spoke.. Among the many old truths in
j new guise which he dwelt upon was the
! necessity for the use of judgment is select
ing grounds for school building?. In trie
; first place the site should be dry and large '
j enough to afford seventy-live square feet of !
l play space to the pupil. It is the first
! Juty of the city to furnish ample school â 
grounds. The school should be located on
j the northwest corner of the lot, where it
will cast the least shadow. The worst
place for location is on the south, because j
it compels the children to play in the \
shade. He had known of ice being for i
i three days in the yard of one of the local !
I schools. Colds were the consequence.
I The school should not exceed two stories
'in height. Primary schools should be of
only one story. Air should pass through
the basement day and night. The build
ing should have only a single row of rooms
along the corridors. The south light is i
I the best light for the schoolroom. The
east rooms are more desirable than those
on the west. The best shape for a school
; room is oblong. The ceiling should be
i 12 feet high, allowing 153 cubic and 15
square feet to each pupil.
Kegarding the furniture of the school
â  room, Mr. McClymonds said that bodily
i defects in children are frequently due to
I poor schooldesks. He believed there would
I some time be used only the adjustable
; desk. The height of the desk should be
) that of the knee. Dangers lurk in the
j sweeping of rooms. Damp sawdust should
| be used in sweeping and the schools could
be kept cleaner with it. Each desk should
be cleaned and varnished when the desk
passed in use from one scholar to another.
when the classrooms are not in use, air
and sunlight should be admitted to them.
Ihe permanent inhalation of impure air
brings on disease. They all knew the
truth of that statement. Any system of
heating the air which does not 'provide for
the renewal of the same is worthless. One
of the best fireplaces was the old-fashioned
fireplace. The London High School is
heated in that way, and a schoolroom with
two or three such lireplaces would be well
heated and well ventilated. A system of
ventilation, to be perfect, must permit a
continued How of pure air. One of the
most important features of the school is
perfect ventilatior.
In conclusion Mr. McCleymonds recom
mended that all light be admitted to
schoolrooms from one side, and that at

Miss Lucy M. Washburn of San Jpse
read a very practical paper on "Hygienic
Improvements Within Reach of Us All."
She referred to the advances latterly made
in the domain of sanitary science and their
important bearing upon the future of hu
manity. "Wheu teachers," she remarked,
"begin to realize that it is a crime to break
the Taws of hygiene, then we shall cease to
have schoolrooms which stifle the mental
activity and undermine the physical well
being of the child."
Before the session adjourned a class of
young ladies gave a charming programme
of calisthenic exercises in the gymnasium.
Miss Palmer directed their evolutions,
which were in very truth a poem of kalei
doscopic grace.
Proceedings at the afternoon session
commenced with the unanimous adoption
of the following resolutions by the as
sembled teachers:
Resolved, Tliat we express our keen apprecia
tion of the hospitality extended to us by the
city ollieials, citizens and teachers of Oakland
and of the continuous successful efforts oÂ£
Superintendent McClymonds and his assist
ants, as well as of all committees who provided
so well for our entertainment.
Resolved, That we recognize with great satis
faction the very general participation on the
part of our elementary curriculum, as inaugu
rated by the State Council of Education. We
believe that the effective prosecution of this
inquiry during the coming year in every
county and city of the State is greatly to be
desired.
Rttolvat, That the council be and hereby is
authorized to print and distribute, gratuti
tously, to-the teachers of the State the reports
of its committees on the course of study, on
high-school certificates and on mutual train
ing, and that the council be authorized to
draw upon the treasury for $200, or such por
tion of that amount as may be required for
necessary printing and postage.
Resolved, That the executive committee be
authorized to pay $25 toward defraying cost

ture in the school curriculum and the neces
sary preparation fox these subjects in the pro
fessional training of the teacher.

on "The Foundations of Belief, or the
Stability of Truth." After reviewing the
present trend of human thought consid
ered in relation to the doctrine of evolu
tion as understood by modern scientists
the learned lecturer said :
Science seta up this test of truth: Can it be
made to work? Can life be trusted to it? This
test the conclusions of philosophy cannot meet.
In .Â«o far as they do meet it they are the conclu
sions of science. As science advances in any
field philosophy is driven out of it. It is a fact
oiten noted that the great conclusions of sci- |
ence have been anticipated by philosoDhy, but
likewise have the various theories which sci
ence has proven inlse. Every conceivable j
guess as to the origin and meaning of familiar
phenomena has been exhausted by philosophy, j
Some of its guesses contain elements of truth, ;
but philosophy cannot determine this, it must
be left to science. Science R* lie gives the true
test of human life. The essence of this test is
experiment.
Philosophy's test is: Is it plausible? Has
It logical continuity? Does it suffice the human
heart? In other words, its tests are subjective,
intellectual or emotional; its data alone are
drawn from the external world. Can we trust j
philosophy to tell us what to believe while we I
must look to science to tell us what we shall I
know? Ii knowledge and belief are of little
rank both must rest upon science. If knowl
edge implies stability and belief does not, the '
latter becomes a word of light meaning, ex
pressive of whim or balance of opinion, and
belief becomes ineffective in human life.
Along its path life cannot march with courage
and success. One ought not to believe where â¢
he cannot trust.
In Professor Ilaeckell's recent address, "The
Confession of Faith of a Man of Science," he
makes an eloquent plea for the acceptance of
the philosophic doctrine of monism as the
fundamental basis of science. According to I
him tin 1 primal conception of monism is that
there lives oik' spirit in all things, that the
whole cognizable world is constituted and has
been developed In accordance with one funda
mental law, this involving the essential oneness
of all tilings, matter and force, object and j
siiirit, God and nature; there is involved in it !
the spontaneous generation of life from inor
ganic matter; the resolution of the vital force
jn all its appearances into properties shown by
certain compounds under certain conditions.
Let us turn for a moment to the positive side
of scientific belief. Not long ago while walk
ing in the garden with my little girl I told her
James Whucomb Riley's story about the "Gob
lins That Get You if You Don't Watch Out."
"But there isn't any suchithing as a goblin,"
said the little girl, "and there isn't ever going
to be any sucii thing." Mindful of the argu
ment of philosophic doubt, I said, "Perhaps
there isn't any such thing as anything, Bar
bara." "Oh, yes there is," said she, looking
about for unquestioned reality, "there is such
a thing as koinething; there is such a thing as
a squash."
In this conclusion of the little girl the real
ity of the objective world, the integrity of
science and the sanity of man are alike bound
up; and for its evidence we must look to the
facts of organic evolution of which man is a
part. Each living being is a link in a contin
uous chain of lite into which death has so far
as we know never entered. Each individual is
in a sense the guardian of this life chain, j
Each link is tested by environment. Those ]
craatnrM unadapted or not adaptable to this '
environment are destroyed. This environ- I
ment is the objective universeâ the world as
it is, not as the creature may imagine it. It is
theworld ol science. Nature is no respecter
of persons and docs not pardon ignorance.
Her laws and penalties consider only what
actually is.
Our senses, our reason, our power of action,
are all concessions to the external world.
Adaptation is in essence obedience. Sense per
ceptions and intellect alike stand as advisers
to the power of choice. The power of choice
involves the need to choose aright. Wrong
choice is punished by death. Death ends the
chain of which each creature is a link. The
life of the world has been continued by those
whose choice has not been fatal. When in
stinct fails reason rises to insure safety. At
last with man reason comes to be the chief
element in guiding the choice of life.
With greater power to know and hence to
choose safely greater complexity of relations
become possible. To those who meet the com
plex demands of civilization the stores of
human wisdom must be open. The mass of
civilized men, to whom right choice under
new conditions is possible only thrjugh fol
lowing the footsteps of others, are saved to life
by instinct of conventionality, helpful im
pulse. Authority is also an important source
of knowledge to {he individual, its value being
proportioned by the power of the individual to
Mat wisely the credentials of authority.
Superstition goes with stupidity and insan
ity. The condition of mind waich is favorable
to mysticism, superstition and reverie is un
favorable to life. If all men sought healing
from the handkerchief of the lunatic or from
contact with old bones, if all physicians used
revealed remedies and business waR conducted
by faith, the folly of these practices would

through sutferance.the weak through altruism.
It Is the strong only that endures. Might does
not make right, but that which is right must
fortify itself by becoming might.
An old parable of life shows man in a light
skiff, in a tortuous channel, beset by rocks,
borne by a falling current to an unknown sea.
He is kept awake by the needs of his situation.
He must keep his craft off the rocks. Contact
with them will mean disaster. If this were
not 6O he would not heed. He has sensation
to warn him, will to choose and freedom to
act, and so in a measure his safety rests in his
own hands. He may choose his own course,
which will not be easy; he may follow the
course of others and attain to some degree of
their safety. But mere impulse will not suf
fice. â
Knowledge is worthy only as a guide to ac
tion, and knowledge being human can only be
approximate ânot reality, but a movement
toward it; so we are brought to the oft-quoted
words of Lessing:
"It is not the truth in man's possession that
makes the worth of man. Possession makea
men selfish, lazy, proud. Not through posses
sion, but through long striving comes the over
growing strength. If God should hold in his
right hand all truth, and in his left hand
only the ceaseless struggle after truth, and
he should say to me Choose, 1 would fall in
humbleness before his left hand and say,
'Father, give; the perfect truth isbutforthee
alone.''"

MEW BILL BY THE ROAD
Southern Pacific Perfects Its
Pleadings for To-mor
row's Battle.
[T IS A MODEL DOCUMENT.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald to Move
to Strike Out All the Com
pany's Affidavits.
So as to be in readiness for the legal
battle of to-morrow the perfected plead
ings of the Southern Pacific in its injunc
tion suit against the State Railroad Com
mission were filed in the United States
Circuit Court yesterday.
It was learned from J. E. Foulds, one of
the attorneys of the railroad company,
that there is nothing in the amended bill
of complaint that is particularly new,
other than its completeness.
It simply embodies in one document,
explained Mr. Foulds, the original bil)
and the subsequent amendments; and
some slight changes have been made in
the railroad's figuresâ changes that do not?
constitute a difference of over $30,000 all
told.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald and his
associate counsel had a consultation over
the new bill yesterday afternoon, but Mr.
Fitzeerald stated late in the day that he
had not at that time given the document
sufficient study to be able to discuss it.
On Monday the particular battle to be
fought by the Southern Pacific, the Kail
road Commission and the Federal Govern
ment Is to be on the order to show cause
and a motion to strike out the railroad
company's affidavits. It will take place
before Judge McKenna.
The new bill is a model in the way of
court pleadings. It contains a statement
of the mileage of the Pacific system; the ;
earnings and expenses of each company i
with the financial status of each, and the !
old allegations that the proposed reduction i
of rates would require the lines in Califor- 'â 
nia to carry freight for less than cost, and
that the rates in this State are lower than
in the other States and Territories through !
which the Southern Pacific system runs i
The resolution of the Democratic State
convention pledging the nominees for ;
Railroad Commissioners to a 25 per cent '
cut is also given. Appended to the bill is
section 22 of article XII of the State con- I
stitution providing for the establishment |
of the Railroad Commission; the act of i
the Legislature approved April 15, 18S0 I
organizing it and defining its powers, and <
the Kentucky acts under which the South- i
crn Pacific was incorporated. The resolu
tions of the Railroad Commission orderinc i
the reduction of rates are included in the |
body of the bill.
The particular points of the bill of in
terest to the general public are: first, that
had tu e reduction of rates now being
fought been in force during the year 189-1,
the bouthern Paciric's revenue from all the
lines of the Pacific system would have been
$1,775,000 less, and a total deficiency of \
$2,051,'2(j2 70 would have resulted ; second,!
that Ijad the proposed reduction been in
force for the first six months of 1895, there
would have resulted a diminution of
revenue amounting to $845,223 28, and a
total deficiency of $2,321,398 87.
For these two years the figures given
are: Year 1894â receipts, |31 ,458.532 64;
expenditures. $31,734.785 34; deficiency,
$276,262 70. First six months of 1895âre

ceipts, $14,836,125 78; expenditures, $16,
--312,302 16; deficiency, $1,476,176 39.
It is evidently the peculiar financial
status of the Southern Pacific's system
that brings about this financial phenom
enon, for its gross earnings from opera
tions alone for 1894 were $31,267,779 16, tnd
its net operating expenses were $20,681,
--905 39; and for the first six months <â :
the gross earnings from operations were
$14,727,319 96 and the net operating ex
penses $10,738,982 95. The difference is al
most accounted for by the payment of $8 -
420,002 87 interest in 1894 on its bonds, and
$4 _i) 9,504 47 interest in the tirst ha f of
1895.
As to the company's payroll, the docu
ment states that for the year ending June
30, 1895, its seventy-one general officers, a*
a daily average of $10 25, received a yearly
compensation amounting in the aggregate
to J36L079 04, and its 15,064 employes/at a
daily average of $2 54, got a total" for the
year of $11,972,667 73.
As compared with the budget of figures
given for the entire Pacific system, it
would appear that the lines in California
were the only paying ones in 1894, though
a different tale is told for the tirst half of
1895. For 1894 the total receipts from the
California roads were 121,001.362 49, and
the total expenditures $20,528 528 97 leav
ing a surplus of $472,833 52. For the first
half of 1895, however, the income waa
$9,932,611 82, and outgo $10,796,303 11 leav
ing a deficiency of $863,691 29, according
to the tables presented to the court.
The claim is made that the opposed re
duction would have made a difference of
11,775,000 to the company for 1894, and
produced a deficiency of $1,303,166 48 in
stead of a surplus of $172,833 52; while for
the first six months of 1895, it is contended,
the difference would have been $^45,223 28,
and the deficiency increased to $1,681, Ml 1 :<:'.
The prediction is ventured that for the
entire year of 1895 the total deficiency
would have been $3,363,820 14. '
During the day Attorney -General Fitz
gerald fifed a notice of his intended motion
to strike from the hies of t .c court al] the
affidavits of the Southern Pacific that wera
made in reply to those of Commissioner
La Hue and Stanton. The motion will bo
made formally in court on Monday. Mr.
Fitzgerald's explanation of his move was:
The ground for the motion is that the
Southern PacifiVs artidavits are not proper,
i'hey seem to anticipate any possible proofs
â¢which the defendant, the Railroad Commis
sion, might make in support of its answer to
the Southern Paciric's bill. They have evi
dently been made to rebut any new matter we
might present as against the 1 plaintiff's in
junction proceedings, but they are really not
in order until the proper time comes. The
proper method of procedure must ue followed
in tiiisas any other controversy in equity.
The entire batch of affidavits served by
the Southern Pacific on the Attorney-
General on Christmas eve is involved in
this motion.
