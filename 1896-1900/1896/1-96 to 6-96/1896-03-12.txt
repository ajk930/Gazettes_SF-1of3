IOWA'S FAVORITE
SON INDORSED
Senator Allison's Race for
the White House Is
Begun.
BACKED BY HIS STATE.
Enthusiasm Marks the Formal
Launching of His Boom at
Dcs Moines.
A MAN FOR THE MASSES.
Has Been Foremost as a Construe
tionist During His Career as
a Statesman.
DES MOINES, lowa, March 11.-The
Republican State Convention met in this
city to-day to select delegate? to the Na
tional Convention at St. Louis and to for
mally inaugurate the candidacy of Senator
William B. Allison of lowa for President.
The convention was one of the largest
ever held in the State, and hundreds of
people were turned away from the Taber
nacle, in which it was held.
The forenoon session was called to order
at 11 o'clock, and Congressman J. P. Pol
liver was named as temporary chairman.
His speech served to arouse the enthu
siasm of Allison's supporters to the high
est point, and it was cheered from first to
last. He did not devote a great deal of
time to the discussion of Allison's claims,
to the Presidency, hut devoted himself
largely to an arraignment of the Demo
cratic party for its incompotency in the
management of Government affairs.
Haid he:
The demand of the hour is for somebody
who understands the every-day business of
the Government of the United States; who
can read the account books on both sidesâ
what we take in and what we pay out. We
have just now a business management that has
neither the energy to save the internal revenue
from the hands of distillers nor the Custom
house tram the ingenuity of importers. With
in a year every shady scheme of undervalua
tion has come forth to enjoy the picnic season
of ad valorem duties, until reputable mer
chants fare already asking the House Commit
tee on Ways and Means 10 exact a peddler's
licnre from the agents of foreign factories In
order thiU/iegitimate merchants may not be
driven f/om the trade. Inadequate and unjust
as the present law is, I do not hesitate to say
that an effectual collection of the revenues
authorize by its terms' would go far toward
covering the current deficit in the receipts.
We need somebody in charge who can tell the

difference between a dollar collected and a
dollar borrowed.
Forone, I want the exact equality of paper
money with coin and of all existing coins of
the same denomination wivh each other in-
violably preserved. That man is a poor
student of the National welfare who would
invite the gold gamblers to bring back their
tables to the centers of American business, that
thieves may again fatten on the fluctuations
of the money of the American people. Without
dispareging other Republican leaders we are
iustified in the conviction that the troubled
interestsof trade and commerce would find a
welcome security in the nomination of the
man who was generously commended to Gar-
field in the letter of Mr. Blame, which is at
once a tribute to Senator Allison's profound
roastervof the problems of National finance
id a memorial of the friendship which began
iv they entered the House of Repre-
sentatives together, and ended only in the val-
lev of the shadow of death.
For months the maintenance of gDecie pay-
ments has been difficult, not by nny fear of
our own people that our paper money is not
Koodâthat is to say, wili not be Daid on de-
mandâbut by a long-stjmding shortage in the
treasury coupled with industrial conditions
t have induced a steady drainage of gold
out of the country, in addition to its usual
movement to pay for goods and merchandise
b'uieht abroad and no longer fully paid for by
the sum total of current exports. The way out
of our misfortunes lies in giving back to the
workinemen of the United States t:ie oppor-
tunitv to do the work of the American people.
The Democratic remedy entirely ignores the
foureosof the trouble. It proposes to keep on
lorrowinc money, exposing the treasury
on the one band to the approach of those
who seen the profits of inking gold out
and leaving it helpless on the other hand

never come, with an enthusiasm that indicates
in the bosom of the Secretary a serene friumph
of hope over experience. The Populist remedy,
a remedy in which an influential group of
other parties unite, is to close matters up by
abandoning the present basis of Americau
business, on which all existing contracts stand,
aud taking refuge, from public and private
creditors alike, in the unlimited issue of silver
dollars gratuitously manufactured for the
owner, out of material worth in the neighbor
hood of 50 cents.
The Republican party, without concealing
its desire to continue the largest practical use
of silver snort of introducing dangerous ele
ments of disturbance and fluctuation into our
coinage, refuses to follow the counsel of either.
The true remedy lies, not in perilous experi
ments in banking, currency and coinage, but
in the prompt provision of an adequate Na
tional revenue. This is the first step, and it
cannot be taken too soon. But the increase of
revenue, in order to be useful, must be brought
into the treasury in such a way as will protect
trie occupations of our own people.
No 1 man has been propose 'l for the nomina
tion whose election would not taring honor to
the chief office of the people, but among all
the illustrious men who are presented for the
favor of the party, in the year of hope and
victory, not one outranks in ripened prepara
tion for its duties the unassuming leader of
Republicanism in lowa, whose name is on the
lips and in the, hearts of ail our people to-day,
William B. Allison.
The gathering of people at both sessions
was perhaps the most representative of
the State ever seen at a State convention.
Several members of Congress had come
home to attend the gathering, and all of
them were given ovations by the conven
tion. The forenoon session did nothing
but listen to the speech of Mr. Dolliver
and name the committees on organization,
resolutions and credentials. In the after
noon the serious work was done. A. B.
Cummins of Dcs Moines was made perma
nent chairman. He made a brief speech,
which added to the enthusiasm.
J. N. Baldwin of Council Bluffs offered a
resolution naming Senator John H. Gear,
Congressman W. P. Hepburn and David
B. Henderson and J. S. C'arkson as dele
gates at large. There had been a move
ment to keep Clarkson off the delegation,
but it was promptly squelched before the
convention came to order, and the resolu
tion carried unanimously.
The following alternates at large were
chosen: H. G. McMillan of Lyon, David
Heimsheimer of Mills, Phil Kchaller of
Sacramento and J. E. Foster of Mahaska.
The resolutions are, in a form, at vari
ance with the ordinary declarations of
State conventions. They are in the na
ture of an address to the country on the
claims of Allison for the Presidential nom
ination. The platform, briefly, is the pub
lic record of Allison, with which alone the
platform deals. They formally present
him to the Nation as a candidate, and call
attention to the part he has taken in Na
tional legislation. The important sections
of the platform are as follows :
Senator Allison has been a conspicuous fig
ure In this beneficent work of the party
throughout its whole existence. No other man
in the Nation more emphatically represents
the constructive and resourceful capacity of
the party to meet, in a practical and success
ful way, the difficult problems of administra
tion. He has been a prominent and indefati
gable laborer In all the dit'icult problems con
nected with the war r.nd the means of sustain-
ing it: reconstruction and the harmonizing of
the sections; the abolition of slavery and the
overthrow of polypamy; the enfranchisement,
education and upbuilding of the negro, sup
plementing in this the work which he did in
i his own State; the raising of revenue to sus
tÃiu the Government, pay pensions and dis
charge thousands of millions ot the public
I debt; the creation of our financial system and
j the return to specie payment; the creation of
: Found currency; the upbuilding of agencies
| for the development of the West;' the reform
| of the civil .service: the National control of
j railroads; the upbuilding of American indus
| trifs; the protection of dairy and agricultural
j products; the prevention of Chinese and pau
j per and criminal immigration, and the crea
j tion of a pension list unequaled In the grati
: tude of nations.
If the dominant issue is to be the tariff, then
no man better represents it, for no man has
been oftener placed in the leadership in the
j 'ormation of Republican tariff than Senator
i Allison. For thirty-nine years he has been
among the foremost in construction and dis
cussion.and always upon the line of that fair
end sufficient protection that is the strength
jot the party policy. He was chairman of the
sub-committee that, after many months of in
j vestiÂ»ration, drafted the administrative pro
j visions of the customs laws accepted under all
j tariff bills since constructed as most efficient
iin their operation. He was chairman of the
Senate committee that drafted the Senate sub-
I stitute for the Democratic bill of 1888, whicn
\ substitute was largely the basis of the Repub
j llcan tariff of 189Â»>. He had the Senate leader
ship again in the perfection of tRÂ« last Re
publican tariff, where it received many of its
important provisions, notably that of reci
j procity. He was again selected by the Senate
Republicans to lead the discussion and assault
upon the free-trade Wilson bill, and his skill
and influence operated largely in saving what
[ ever measure of protection American industry
j secured under that law.
if the financial question is to be the Issue of
the campaign, then Allison is the man first
commended to the Nation by reason of his
reputation for financial resourcefulness and
constructiveness and soundness, a fact con
spicuously recognized by the pressure of Presi-

dents Garfield and Harrison upon him to take
the portfolio of the treasury in their respect
ive administrations. He has been favorable to
a true bimetallism. He has at all times
labored to maintain an abundant currency of
gold, silver and paper, made interconvertible
ami equal to the best currency of the commer
cial world. He has demanded for the business
of the Nation a currency equitable and stable,
free from the oscillations so dangerous to
business Interests and so unjust to the wage
earners of the Nation, whose $3,000,000,000 of
annual wages and many thousand millions
in savings banks and other forms constitute
them the great creditor class of the Nation.
If the foreign policy of the Nation is to be
the issue Senator Allison has held rigidly to
the teachings of Washington and the teach
ings of Monroe â opposing all entangling alli
ances with other countries, assaulting no
established rights of nations upon this conti
nent, but firmly insisting that the political
system of Europe shall not be enlarged and ex
tended in this hemisphere, menacing alike the
integrity of the United States and the republi
can government of the continent.
If experience and familiarity with every de
tail of governmental business is to be the test,
Senator Allison has thirty-two years of Inti
mate knowledge and experience gained as a
member of the great committees of Congress
to emphasize his eminent fitness.
The convention received the announcement
of the twenty-two district delegates who had
been named by the district caucus before the
main convention and adjourned.
THREE SALVATION ORDERS
The American Rescue Army the
Latest to Spring Into
Existence.
Ballington and Maude Booth Will Not
Reply to the General's
Message.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.-Balling
ton and Alaude Booth decided to-day that
they would not reply to the cable message j
of General Booth to his American troops, j
It was intimated, however, that the ex- 1
commanders will have something very
pertinent to say in the near future.
Nearly 200 persons have asked for ad- '
mission to the Defenders' League, and !
that branch of the organization promises
to be an important and successful one.
The number of soldiers who have volun
tarily resigned from the Salvation Army
and been enrolled in the American army
is now about 850, while nearly 1000 have
dfdared their intention of doing so.
In addition to the English organization
and that of the Ballington Booth revolters
a third Salvation Army is in progress of
formation. It is headed by Captain Fred
Rodgler, a well-known rescue mission j
worker in this pity, and will be known as
the American Rescue Army. The scheme
of this new army is broader than that of
the Booths' organization, as it proposes
not only to bring men and women under
relicious influences, but also to furnish
them with food, shelter and work, if
needed.
Those at the head of this new Salvation
Army movement say that with a fund of
$10,000 they can inaugurate an effecting 4
working organization.

i
Uproar Caused by the Unseating
of Members in Senate and
House.
BLOODSHED BARELY AVERTED.
Republicans Oust a Democrat and
Lose Two of Their Men
as a Result.
FRANKFORT, Kt., March 11.â All the
conflicting elements in the Senatorial bat
tle were almost turned Into a bloodthirsty
mob of Senators, members of the House
and their adherents to-day. The com
batants fought far nearer the riotous preci
pice than they have done since the dead*
lock. The Hotise and the lobbies were the
scene of excitement, which needed only an
overt act on the part of a Republican to
provoke the use of knives, revolvers and
clubs.
The Republican House had unseated
Kaufman in spite of Dunlap's withdrawal
of his contest of the seat and refusal to
qualify. Quick with their revengeful
spirit, the Democratic Senators made good
their threat to retaliate and unseated Wal
ton and James. The latter stepped into
the House while he was beintr unseated in
the Senate, but remained a silent spectator
of the partisan battle. Walton refused to
leave the Senate chamber when he saw
the enraged mob rush toward the House.
All of the indications then pointed to a
stormy time of it to-day. The Republicans,
though knocked off their feet temporar
ily by Dunlap's withdrawal of his contest
for the seat of Representative Kaufman
<D.), quickly rallied, and decided to push
the fi^ht against Kaufman regardless of
Dunlap's action. In anticipation of the
excitement which would certainly follow
the expected developments to-day Speaker
Ulandford again enforced the rule exclud
ing from the lobbies and galleries all per
sons except the Jadies, and, in conse
quence, the crowd was kept outside.
In the House there was a preliminary
scrimmage over the distillers' private
brand bill, and the previous question had
already been ordered on the bill and
amendments, when Mr. Howard (R.) o*
Butler County, rose and called up the
Dunlap-Kaufman contest as a matter of
the highest privilege. Mr. Carroll made
the point that the contest had been ended
by the withdrawal of the contestant.
In a minute the wildest excitement pre
vailed all over the State House. Senators
huddled together in the middle of the
Senate chamber, while a mob crowded
every entrance.
The Democratic Senators yelled their
votes, unseating James and Walton (Re
publicans). Three minutes later a mob
was at the door of the House declaring
that James and Walton should never go
in there. In the mob were several men
with their pistols in their pockets, stand
ing at the door daring the Republicans to
attempt to bring the two unseated Sena
tors through. Among them were "Jack"
Chirm, "Jim" Williams, Senator Bron
ston, Senator Martin, Walter Sharp and
Senate Doorkeeper Tyler. Senator Black
burn was in the crowd counseling cool
ness.
The crowd was mad when they learned
that Dr. James had already slipped into
the House and had done so while they
were unseating him in the Senate. Men
and women rushed from the building
when the yells told that the unseating in
the Senate had been clone, fearing a riot.
The Chief of Police had a large body of
patrolmen on hand, however. Dunlap, the
newly seated Representative, attempted to
enter the House but was kept back by the
crowd at the door. The Repnblicans tried
in vain to induce Dr. Walton, the un
seated Republican Senator, to brave the
knives and pistols and force his way into
the House, but he refused to leave the Sen
ate chamber.
Lyons contended that the House still
had control over the Dunlap case, and said
the contestant could not withdraw with
out leave of the House. The effect of the
decision of the Speaker was to sustain this
point, and the House, amid suppressed
excitement proceeded to vote on the
minority report, which was in tavor of
Dunlap. The minority report which seats
Dunlap was adopted by a vote of 48 to 46,
strictly partisan, except that Poor and
Kdrington, Populists, voted with the
Democrats.
Tlie Democrats then rushed from the
hall in a wild stampede and into the
rotunda to break a quorum on the vote on
the report as amended. Fifty-one Repub
licans, however, responded on the roll call,
and Kaufman (D.) was unseated.
Doorkeeper Tyler (D.) and his deputies
stood guard at the joint assembly door for
a half hour Before that body met and
pressed back the surging mob. A fight
was nearly precipitated when Register of
the Land Office Reynolds (R.) demanded
admittance. He and Sergeant-at-Arms
Hommers were about to lock horns when
Senator Goebel and others stepped in and
Reynolds was allo *ed to pass in.
Pistols were brandished several times
and almost a panic was created. The ro
tunda upstairs was filled with the mob,
while downstairs and outside there was a
big, but more orderly, crowd, among
whom were many ladies.
When the Senate was announced at the
door Speaker Blandford refused to recog
nize it, saying the doorkeepers usurped
the authority of the House in keeping out
members entitled to vote.
A hot colloquy ensued between the
Speaker and Uronsion. The Senator
charged that the Speaker had or was at
tempting to usurp powers of the joint as*
sembly and he was proceeding to more
revolutionary methods by moving to or
ganize the joint assembly by electing Sen
ator Goebel President, when through Sen
ators Salyers and others order "Mas re
stored. The Senate tiled in and Speaker
Blandford gave way.
There was a long wrange about
whether the Democratic clerks of the Sen
ate or the Republican clerks of the House
should call the roll, the point, of course,
being that a tight might arise over the
calling of the names of Senators James
and Walton. The Democrats contended
that the Senate clerk (Democrat) was chief
clerk of the joint assembly and had the
right to call the entire roll. Senator
Bronston called attention to rule 2 of
joint assembly, and made the point that
the clerk of the Senate was the clerk
of the joint assembly, and as such
should call the roll of the entire joint
assembly. The presiding officer ruled
against Senator Bronston, and said that
the clerk of the House would call the roll
of the House, while the clerk of the Sen
ate would call the roll of the Senate.
Bronston then arose and said that the
presiding officer should divest himself of
his partisanship and rule according to
law.
"Kentucky's honor is gone," he shouted.
"It has been trampled under foot. I say
not by whom, but there is yet a chance for
you, sir, to rule fairly."
After more wrangling the chair ordered
the call of the roll. The chief clerk in
calling the names of the members of the
Senate omitted to call those of James and
Walton, the two Republican Senators who
had been unseated by the Senate majority
a few minutes before going into the joint
Assembly. The clerk of the House, in
calling the roll of the House members,
omitted to call the name of Kaulman (D.),
who had been unseated. The rollcall
showed 130 members present, with two
pairs.
The roll was then called for a vote for
Senator. The Republicans refused to vote.
The ballot resulted: Blackburn 54; Car
lisle 10; Buckner 1. No quorum voting,
the joint assembly adjourned until noon
to-mcrrow.
After the adjournment, of the joint
assembly, the crowd thinned out some
what, but many still remained, and to
night feeling is at a high tension. It is be
lieveu that Dunlap will refuse to qualify.

COLUMBUS, Ohio, March 11.â The Re.
publican State Convention to-day nomi
nated the following ticket: Secretary of
State, Charles Kinney of Sciotp County;
i Judge of the Supreme Court, Marshall J.
S Williams, the incumbent; Dairy and
| Food Commissioner, Joseph E. Blackburn
! of Belmont County; member of the Board
I of .Public "Works, Frank A. Huffman of

Green of Cleveland and J. W. Taylor of
East Liverpool. Presidential Electors-at-
Largeâ l. F. Mack of Sandusky and Al*
bert Douglas Jr. of Chillicothe.
The programme arranged between the
McKinley and Foraker leaders as to the
i delegates-at-large to the St. Louis conven
i tion was carried out without friction. la
'â¢ the nomination of the State ticket there
! was a sharp right between the Foraker and
; McKinley factions, with the result that
i the Foraker faction was completely de
j feated. The slate prepared by the Foraker
. leaders in the room of Senator-elect For
i aker laÂ«t midnight broke, except as to the
â  candidate for State Food Commissioner.
The Foraker candidate for this position,
j Joseph E. Blackburn of Belmont County,
! was nominated, by the combined strength
1 of the Foraker delegates and the influence
i of the wholesale grocers' trade.
The Foraker leaders evidently supposed
| that Charles Kinney and E. W. Doty, both
I of whom" have been identified with the
' McKinley faction, would divide the vote
i of that element of the convention and tho
1 Foraker strength uniting on Wickoff

mistaken. Kinney's adherents could not
be drawn away from him. "Wickoff simply

ination for Food Commissioner placed
before the State Board of Public "Works.
This was unfriendly to John Stillwell,
who comes from the same county-

the Board of Public Works. The
enemies of McNeal, t!ie Wholesale

friends ioined in trying to have the report
adopted so as to provide for the nomina
tion of the member of the Board of Public

County demanded to be heard, and voices
all over the convention hall demanded an
other vote on the question. With the con-
Bent of the convention. Chairman Foraker
put the question on the amendment offered
by Brigham changing the report, but it
was voted down.
Congressman R. W. Taylor read the re
port of the committee on resolutions from
the stage, and on hi 9 motion it was
adopted as the party platform. The plat
form was largely the regulation party
document with a few new features. It de
nnuncesthe Democratic National admin
istration; ?m'rms the policy of protection,
with incidental reciprocity; denounres
the free-wool provision of the present
tariff as an attack upon an important in
dustry, and stands for bimetallism and
McKinley's candidacy for the Presidency.
The currency plank is as follows:
We contend for honest money; for a cur
oi gold, silver a;ld paper, with which to
ire our exchanges, that shall be as sound
h> the Government, as untarnished as its
honor; and to that end we favor bimetallism
and demand the use of both gold and silver as
standard money, either in accordance with a
ratio to be fixed by an international agree
ment, if that can be obtained, or under such
restrictions and such provisions to be deter
mined by legislation as will secure the main
tenance of the parities of values of the two
metals, *o that the purchasing and debt-paying
power of the dollar, whether of silver, paper
or gold, shall be at all times equal.
McKinley's candidacy is indorsed as
follows:
The people of Ohio take satisfaction in the
expressions coming from every section of our
common country of popular approval of their
distinguished fellow-citizen, William McKin
ley. The great advocate of protection, who
has all his life stood for America, its fac
tories, its farms and its firesides, finds his re
ward in the confidence and affection of the
people, whose interests have been his constant
care.
As their candidate for the Presidency the

Foreign Relations Is
Attacked.
SPANIARDS AS ALLIES.
Oppressors of Cuba Praised as
a Nation Friendly to the
United States.
GOADS SHERMAN AND MORGAN
Angry Responses Called Forth by
Bitter Words â The Argument
Not Concluded.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.âSen
ator Hoar's resolution to postpone the
conference report on the Cuban concur
rent resolutions till Monday, the 6th of
April, was taken up early in the morning
hour to-day, and after a speech by Hoar in
support of it, lost its place in the morning
hour and went to the calendar, from
which there will probably be no
effort to resurrect it. But the
debate in the Senate will go on all the
same to-morrow and until the subject is
disposed of, as the conference report is a
privileged question, at least until 2 o'clock
to-morrow, when it comes into conflict
with the resolution for seating Dupont as
Senator from the State of Delaware, a
question of still higher privilege.
Hoar's speech was largely an arraign
ment of the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions for reporting the concurrent resolu
tion without having any facts to justify
such action. He appealed to Senator
Sherman, whom he placed on the same
pedestal with Lincoln, Grant, Fish, Seward
and his own illustrious brother, General
Sherman, to recede from the position
which he had taken, and the only reason
for which was, he intimated, because a
Presidential election was at hand.
Hoar said some very severe things about
the action of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, and said that when it wrote the
word "concurrent"^ at the head of the reso
lution it meant, it was to be distinctly un
derstood, that this was to be a Pickwickian
resolution. Hoar deplored the idea of
rushing matters through Congress that
properly belonged to the function of the
State Department. He did not agree '-with
Secretary Olney politically, but he knew
him well; he was a generous, square, hon
est, old-fashioned Massachusetts Yankee,
and Hoar said he was not afraid to trust
him in the diplomatic affairs of this Gov
ernment.
Hoar then related a story of one of the
old Emperors who was walking along a
narrow path, accompanied by a fine lady
of his court, when they met a laborer car
rying a heavy burden. The lady refused
to 9tep aside, when the Emperor com
manded her to respect the burden the man
was carrying. Applying this to existing
conditions, Hoar said the people and the
press, in criticizing the President and the
administration in the Venezuelan and
Spanish question, should respect the
burden that rested upon them and the re
sponsibilities that belonged to the Execu
tive alone.
It was to be lamented, Hoar said, that
the youth of the Spanish universities had
been so excited as to offer indignities to
the American flag, and that the Minister
from Spain, a gentleman of great accom
plishments and the representative of a
friendly power, was stung into breaking
over diplomatic propriety and making an
appeal, in an irregular way, to the people
of the United States.
Hoar spoke in tna-t connection of Spain
as the ally and friend of the American
colonies in the war of independence, and
as having exercised a potent influence in
preventing armed intervention by France
and Great Britain in the Civil War.
The Senate, Hoar declared, must do its j
duty with courage and firmness. What
ever the Senate did should be done in a
calm, quiet, dignified spirit, as befitted
the action of a great people. It ought to
imitate not the excitement of mobs; it
ought to indulge not in the impassioned
eloquence of orators and not in the stimu
lant appeals or the love of liberty, or to
any other public passion, good or bad.
This was a time and an occasion for the
judicial faculty.
Hoar said he had authorized his col
league some weeks ago to pair him in favor
of Senator Cameron's resolution asking the
President to use his good offices with Spain
for the recognition of Cuban independ
ence. For that reason he stood to-day and
was prepared to defend it if necessary.
He said that the question of belligerency
was a question of fact, and it was reasona
ble that the usual precauions should be
taken. The Senate should have before it
the "finding of facts by the proper com
mittee charged with the investigation.
T his subject was discussed in the com
mittee for several days and was brought
into the Senate without any report, but
accompanied by a speech from Senator
Morgan, who laid his sword on the tabte
and asked Spain to take it up, and de
clared his belief in the power of Congress
without the President to grant belligerent
rights. The other speech, that of Sher
man, contained quotations from a wort
that was repudiated. Upon these state
ments and without any presentation of
facts Congress was asked to act.
Hoar accused the Foreign Relations
Committee of Dasing its resolution upon a
statement contained in a letter from the
agent of the Cuban Junta. Sherman took
exceptions to this statement, declaring
that the letter came from the State De
partment itself.
Hoar was complaining of the lack of in
formation before the Senate on the Cuban
question when Sherman called his atten
tion to a Drinted document of 200 pages,
containing a message from the President
and all the correspondence conducted by
the State Department.
"This document has been before the
Senate for more than two weeks, and was
open to the Senate all the time," said
Sherman, somewhat petulantly.
"I don't believe anybody ever read it,"
retorted Hoar. "Whether the members of
the committee did I do not know. 1 '
"I quoted from that document in my
speecu liberally, " said Morgan, "and that
speech was in the nature of a report from
the committee."
"Then," said Hoar, with apparent glee,
"you spoke for the committee when you
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1896.
laid the sword on the table and asked
Spain to take it up. Is that not so, and
did you not speak for Jhe committee when
you said there had been 45,000 prisoners
executed in Cuba?"
Morgan said he did not speak for the
committee with regard to the execution of
prisoners. Morgan said the record had
been deliberately misquoted. He gave
that as a quotation from a printed work
and not as a statement of his own. After
reciting the definition of an old Democra
tic judge in Massachusetts in circumstan
tial evidence. Hoar said the recent activity
on the part of the somewhat sleepy Com
mittee on Foreign Relations was circum
stantial evidence, not that war was
approaching, but that an election was
approaching.
During the morning business a joint res
olution was introduced by Allen (Pop ) of
Nebraska and was referred to the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations authorizing and
requesting the President of the United
States to cause a thorough and
rigid investigation to be made into
the manner in which war be
tween Spain and the belligerents in
Cuba is being conducted; whether in
accordance with the established rules of
civilized warfare and whether unusual
and exceptional cruelties, barbarities and
atrocities are and have been perpetrated
by either party toward the other, and par
ticularly toward non-combatants. The
joint resolution appropriates $10,000 for
the expenses of the inquiry.
The resolution heretofore offered by
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire, for an
inquiry by the Committee on Civil Service
into the expenses of the Senate for the
past year, was reported back favorably
and placed on the calendar.
HUNTINGTON'S PLANS.
Favors a Straight-Out Funding Scheme
and Will Oppose the Hubbard
Plan.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.â Collis
P. Huntington to-day disappointed the
House Pacific Roads Committee, which
assembled by appointment at 10:30 o'clock
to hear his testimony. Mr. Huntington
sent word that he was unable to appear,
but would be on hand to-morrow.
Reports have been sent from Washing
ton to the effect that the Union Pacific
and Central Pacific roads had agreed on
the Hubbard plan of settlement, and that
a bill embodying this scheme would prob
ably be reported.
The Call correspondent is able to state
that the roads have reached no agreement
and that Mr. Huntington will to-morrow
say to the House Committee that he pre
fers the bill introduced in the House by
E'epresentative Smith and in the Senate
by Mr. Frye, to the plan favored by the
Union Pacific (the Hubbard plan). This
information coincides with what The
Call correspondent has wired from time
to time, viz.: that Huntington favored a
straight-out funding scheme and that the
Smith and Frye bills would be reported.
RIGHTS OF THE BANNOCKS
Supreme Court to Decide as to
the Killing of Game in
Wyoming.
A Case Growing Out of the Recent
Indian Uprising at Jackson
Hole.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.â The
famous habeas corpus case of .1 ohn H. Ward,
Sheriff of the county of Uintah, Wyo., vs.
Race Horse, was argued in the Supreme
Court to-day. It came to the court on ap
peal from the Circuit Court of Wyoming,
where the case against Race Horse was be
gun after the trouble with the Bannork
Indians at Jackson Hole last sammer )
pursuant to a friendly understanding be
tween the Indian Bureau officials and the
authorities for the purpose of securing a
judicial construction of the treaty rights
pleaded by the Indians in justification of
their killing of game.
The origin of the trouble was the killi ng
of elk by the Indians, which was pro
hibited by the laws of the State of Wyo
ming. The right to hunt game on unoccu
pied public land was reserved to the
Indians in the treaty oy which they were
located in the present reservation.
The State law forbade the killing of
game under the conditions then existing,
ana a conflict between the Indians and
peace officers of the State ensued. Subse
quent to the outbreak Race Horse, a mem
ber of the Bannock Indians, was arrested
on a warrant of the District Court of Uin
tah County, charged with a violation of
State law in the killing of seven elk. He
was released on a writ of habeas corpus is
sued by the Federal court in Wyoming,
and Sheriff Ward appealed to the Supreme
Court of the United States.
The questions before the court are: 1.
does the State statute forbidding the kill
ing of game restrict or annul the rights of
the Indians to hunt under the treaty with
the United States? 2. Do the words "un
occupied lands" used in the treaty mean
lands that have not been surveyed, subdi
vided and platted?
The affirmative of these was argued by
Benjamin F. Fowler, Attorney-General of
Wyoming, and the negative by Attorney-
General Harmon.
CABLE TO MA WAI I,
The Republicans of the Senate Committee
. . favor the Project.'
WASHINGTON, D.C., March 11.â The
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations
to-day considered the two propositions
before it providing for the construction of
a telegraphic cable from San Francisco to
Japan via the island of Hawaii, and from
the same city to Hawaii. No conclusion
has yet been reached by the committee,
but it is believed that one of two com
panies will be granted the right to can
struct the cable, and be given a bonus by
the Government.
Messrs. Gray, Turpie and Mills, Demo
cratic members of the committee, are
opposed to the granting of subsidies, and
will vote against the bill, but the Repub
licans say they have enough votes to make
a favorable report to the Senate.

Errors of the Commissioner of

Out.
PRESENT LAWS INEFFECTIVE.
Prevailing Conditions Are Satisfactory
to the Railroad Companies
Only.
WASiIINGTCN, D. C, March 11.â The
California delegation to-day sent the fol
lowing letter to Hon. Fred T. Dubois,
chairman of the Committee on Public
Lands of the Senate:
Regarding H. B. 5819, and letter 3, from
the honorable Commissioner of the Land Of
fice in relation thereto, dated March 4, we de
sire to say: The criticisms of the Commis
sioner may be briefly indicated as follows:
Firstâ The honorable Commissioner says:
"The lands to be clarified under the bill be
fore me are situated within old and well set
tled communities, are generally surveyed
lands and presumably have been thoroughly
examined and explored by prospectors."
The Commissioner then draws the conclusion
that the lands which have been thus explored
and prospected should not be made the subject
of further examination and classification.
From our personal knowledge of the situation,
we are able to state that the Commissioner has
fallen into error as to the result of former pros
pecting in the mineral regions of California.
The hasty, superficial and methodlessprospect
ing of earlier years in our State iR but now
giving place to scientific and skillful methods.
Abandoned mines are being reopened, more at
tention is being paid to the development of
our mineral resources, and, in short, capital is
being attracted to the mineral regions of Cali
fornia as never before in the history of the
State, since the tirst few years of feverish ex
citement following the discovery of gold on the
American River in 1848.
Furthermore, many small claims in the
mountains are held by men of humble means,
which claims have not yet been patented, but
are held by work and possession under the
Federal mining laws. The owners of these
small mines, living, as they do, in isolated
districts, far removed from populous centers,
frequently have no notice of intended patents
to railroad companies, and their claims are
consequently swallowed up by railroad patent.
It is impossible within rho brief space of a
letter to explain the situation as it exists or to
state all the reasons why the classification
sought for should be made- We may say, how
ever, that it is a well-known fact among the
miners of California that prospecting along
methodical and scientific Hues has just begun
in California, and that it would be a severe
blow to the development of the mining indus
trg as well as a grave financial loss to the
United States to permit any considerable por
tion of the mineral lands of that State to be
patented to railroad companies.
Secondâ The honorable Commissioner says:
"The cost of examination and expenses in the
Idaho district was <5.2 cents (per acre, of
course), the cost in other districts (Montana)
ranging from 1.15 to 2.3 cents per acre." Just
why the classification in Califoruia should
cost 6.2 cents per acre and why Idaho should
be taken as a standard of comparison is not
clear. The contested lands in California lie
mostly in the Central Pacific and California
and Oregon grants. The unpatented lands
within these grants comprise altogether 1,331,
--404 acres, or less than 1,500,000 acres out ot
7,500.000 to be classified. A good many thou
sand acres of Central Pacific and California
and Oregon grants lie in the Sacramento Val
ley, in Butto and Tehama counties, while
other portions thereof are in barren regions of
Lasseu and Modoc counties. Less than a mil
lion acres within the two grants above men
tioned would require careful examination.
Proceeding southward through the San
Joaquin Valley and over the Tehachapi
Mountains into Southern California the work
of the Commissioners will not be difficult.
Ibis matter whs fully explained orally at a
recent meeting of your committee and need
not be repeated here. We can see no reason
why it should cost more in California than in
Montana. On the contrary the very fact, as
stated by the Commissioner, that California is
an older State and her lands better known and
understood would make the task of the Com
missioners for California easier. The evidence
of witnesses would be more easily obtained
and an examination of contested lands more
quickly made.
Thirdâ The honorable Commissioner sug
gests the following amendment to section
3 of the bill under consideration, namely, by
adding to section 3 the following language:
"And provided further that this act shall not
apply to any Innds in which publication has
been made or been ordered made by the Gen
eral Land Office under a circular of the De
partment of the Interior, approved July 9,
1894, and that all such lands so published or
ordered to be published shall proceed to
patent under now existing regulations.
The exclusion of published lands as sug
gested by the Commissioner, while it might
save the Government the small expense of
publication already incurred, would lose to
the United States and to the miners a large
portion of the very lands sought to be saved
by the creation of the proposed commission.
It is apparent that the efficacy ef the proposed
measure would be seriously crippled if the
lands already published but not patented
were excluded from its operation. The min
eral lands within these published lands belong
to the Government and not to railroad com
panies, and the reasons that apply to the set
ting apart of mineral lands in other portions
of the railroad grants apply with equal force
to the published but unpatented lands.
Fourthâ ln speaking of the recent precedure
in the land department, the Commissioner
says: "This procedure has protected the rignts
of mineral elaiments so well that no com
plaints has been made of its action by them."
Has the Commissioner fallen into an error as
to facts? The dissatisfaction with the present
procedure is strong and universal among the
miners of California. The California Miners'
Association, which is composed of leading
mining and business men of that state, ex
ponded over $5000 in the year 1895 in fruit
less efforts to prevent the patenting of mineral
lands to railroad companies. The records in
the office of the Commissioner of the General
Laud Otice have been considerably augmented
by protests, briefs, etc., proceeding from the
California Miners' Association. The associa
tion sent a personal representative to Washing
ton in the summer of 1895 to lay the above
matters before the proper officials. The fact is
the miners of California have been compelled
to ask Congress for the relief which they now
seek.
Referring to the suggestions made by the
members of your committee to the effect that
the proposed inquiry should be limited by the
exclusion of known agricultural lands, we de
sire to say that we know of no feasible way to
accomplish this ontirely desirable result. The
California Miners' Association, through its ap
propriate committees, d<scussed this very
question with a view to modifying the pro
posed bill as above suggested. They discov
ered, however, that it was impracticable to
designate a geographical boundory line that
would properly designate the lands sought to
be classified. A designation of lands by alti
tude was also found impracticable. They also
found it impossible to designate lands by coun
ties, since nearly every county affected by these
land grants lies partially in valleys and par
tially in mountains.
The people of the State of California are just
as anxious to have this work expeditiously
done as are the officers of the Government, for
until these lands are properly classified mineral
titles in California must remain in a large part
in an uncertain condition, and prospecting and
development of our mineral resources corre
spondingly retarded. We feel, however, that
we can safely assure your committee that any
commission that may be appointed by the
President will have no difficulty in segregating
ami setting apart with small expenditure of
time and money large tracts of agricultural
lands that maybe found within the railroad
land grants. The result of the consideration
of this matter by the California Miners' Asso
ciation was that the only safe and practicable
method to be employed was that adopted in
the so-called Idaho-Montana act, with wnich
act your committee is familiar, namely: The
designation of lands by land districts.
No one not familiar with the conditions in
California can appreciate the deep interest
taken in this subject, not only by those directly
interested in mining, but likewise by the peo
ple generally. The criticisms which have been
made, entirely irrespective of party, upon the
plan heretofore adopted for the issuance of
railroad patents, have been emphatic and
practically universal. The laws and regula
tions now in force are utterly ineffective, and
as far as California is concerned, we do not
hesitate to say that no interest disconnected
with a railroad company is satisfied with the
prevailing conditions. Every member of the
California delegation favors this bill, to say
nothing of the representative gentlemen from
that section who are here solely in furtherence
of its enactment. Yours, etc.

Representing the California Miners' Associa
tion.
The Call correspondent learned to-night
that the Senate Committee on Public
Lands expects to report the California
mineral lands bill favorably, with, the fol
lowing amendments :
Firstâ Reducing the compensation of the
Commissioners to $10 per day, without ex
penses.
Secondâ Limiting the time within which
lands are to be classified to four years.
Third â Directing the Commissioners to class
ify large bodies of well-known agricultural
lands upon testimony taken and without per
sonal examination, by legal subdivisions.
This last amendment is intended to ex
pedite the work of the commission and to
enable it to more rapidly classify valley
lands, about which there is no contest.
The committee endeavored to find some
means of eliminating the valley lands of
known agricultural character, but found
ho practicable means of so doing. The
above plan of directing the Commissioners
to thus set apart undisputed agricultural
lands was at last practically agreed upon.
It is understood that Senator Berry of
Arkansas will offer the above amend
ments, and, .their adoption will remove all
further objection in the Senate and insure
executive approval.
Tirey L. Ford has wired to the secretary
of the California Miners' Association for
instruction as to the above amendments
upon the return of the bilf to the House.
If the House refuses to concur in the Sen
ate amendments a conference committee
of the two houses will finally dispose of the
matter.

Object to an Illustration in Which
JX Rays Had Exposed the
Politician's Brain.
PITTSBURG, Pa., March 11.-C. L. Ma-
Bee of the Pittsburg Times and State
Senator William Flynn entered suit before
Alderman McMasters to-day against the
Pittsburg Commercial Gazette for criminal
ibel. The information against thetrazette
alleges that that paper published a false
and defamatory article, which stated that
Magee and Flynn had entered into a deal
with Mark Hanna, the Cleveland million
aire, to boom McKinley for President, and
had received $150,000 for so doing.
Mr. Flynn's action against the Press is
based on the publication of a cut, in which
X-rays turned on his brain showed a bag
of money labeled "McKinley Campaign
Funds," and some having blocks marked
"Popularity."
The time for the hearing of the cases
has not been set. Civil action, claiming
$100,000 damage s in each case, will follow
to-morrow.

McAuliffe's Poor Form Tells Against
Him After the Third
Bout.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â After a
long absence from the roped arena Jack
McAuliffe appeared to-night in a six-round
bout with "Kid" Lavigne at Madison
square Garden. At times the light-weight
champion showed some of his old-time
quickness and cleverness, but he was in no
condition to antagonize the "Kid," who
had the best of the argument. McAuliffe's
poor condition told on him fast and he
was nearly out when the police stopped
the bout.
Owing to the action of the authorities no
referee was appointed and the men
sparred for a popular verdict. McAuliffe
held a warm place in the hearts of the
spectators because of his previous reputa
tion, but there was only one verdict possi
ble, and that was in Lavigne's favor. Fully
3000 persons witnessed the bout.
After the contest McAuliffe challenged
Lavigne to a finish fight within ten weeks,
and negotiations are pending.
Round Iâ McAuliffe was the first to land
with the left and followed up with the
right on the ribs. Lavigne came back and
swung right and left on McAuliffe's head.
The Kid led with the left and caught Jack
on the ear. A moment later the Kid got
right and left from Jack. The righting was
very fast and McAuliffe showed almost his
old-time speed. Lavigne rushed just be
fore time was called aud caught Jack's left
flush in the face.
Round i â McAuliffe shot his ieft into the
Kid's face. The Kid followed up, but was
shoved back on to the ropes. The Kid
sent his left on Jack's nose. Jack tried to
rush, and took another left hander on the
face. McAuliffe was short, and the Kid
crossed the right on the neck, and followed
up on the ribs. A moment after the Kid
put his right on Jack's ribs. The round
ended with the two close together, doing
some hard and fast in-fighting. Lavigne
showed to good advantage. Jack was evi
dently not the McAuliffe of old.
Round 3 â Jack led, but the Kid
ducked and evaded. He swung his left,
but the Kid parried neatly. Jack essayed
another lead, but the Kid again ducked.
Jack swung a hard left on the ear, which
straightened the Kid for a second. Jack
seemed to be tiring a little.
Round 4 â McAuliffe rushed at his man
and put the left lightly on the face. Jack
swung richt and left lightly on the Kid's
face. Lavigne rushed in and Jack caught
him and swung the left on the jaw. Jack
broke away from Lavigne's leads. The
Kid kept after him and rushed him to his
corner. So far it was Lavigne's fight.
Round sâJack5 â Jack led with his left, but was
short. The "Kid" followed Jack into his
corner and landed a left swing on the face.
They clinched, and after breaking away
the "Kid" put both hands hard on the
body. Jack broke ground and the "Kid"
went after him and planted his left
straight on the face.
Round 6â They started at a hot pace.
Lavigne rushed and Jack swung a hard
right on the ribs. They indulged in some

President Cleveland and Party Sail on
the Maple.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 11.â
President Cleveland sailed away from
Washington to-night at 11 o'clock on
another of his duck-hunting trips. His
destination is Widewater, Va., about
forty miles down the Potomac, where
Colonel Richard Waller has several
ducking-blinds. As usual the lightiiouse
tender Maple conveyed the party, which
consisted of Mr. Cleveland, Commander
Lamberton of the navy, who is the light
house inspector for the Potomac River
district, and Dr. Reilly of the army, the
President's physician.
The President and his friends arrived at
the Washington and Norfolk steamboat
wharf at 11 o'clock in the White House
carriage. Immediately after they went on
board the Maple the lines were cast off and
the little vessel steamed down the river.
The weather is of the kind that is sup
posed to delight the duck-hunters' heart,
and the snow had just ceased falling when
the Maple started. The party will prob
ably return to-morrow.

Failure of Former Filibus

A BATTLE AT MONTEGUELO.
Insurgents Reported to Have Been
Defeated in a Five-Hour
Engagement.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 11.âAl
thoueh the report that another big fili
bustering expedition is ready to start for
Cuba could not be confirmed here to-day
with any degree of positiveness, enough
was gathered from different sources to put
the rumor on a pretty solid foundation.
It is said that the steamer which will take
the expedition is ready to sail at any. mo
ment, and it is possible that the men and
arms and ammunition which will form
the vessel's cargo are even now waiting
for the ship at some point on the New
Jersey coast. When the steamer arrives
off this point she will probably lie outside
the three-mile limit and the men and
arms will be taken aboard in boats. If
the expedition was to have started to
night, as rumored, it is likely that the
prevailing gale may delay tne departure.
On one point only would the local Cuban
leaders talk. They assert positively that
General Caliito Garcia will head no more
expeditions. While crediting General
Garcia with all loyalty to the Cuban
cause they say he is not circumspect
enough, and that he was mainly responsi
ble for the failure ol the expeditions that
came to grief under his leadership.

Gathering year Havana to Strike a De
cisive Itlote.
HAVANA., CUBA, March 11, via Key
West, March 11.â Gomez, Maceo, Lacret
and other leaders have united just east
of the Havana line near Nueva Paz. It
is supoosed their intention is to return to
this province. The Spanish troops have
recently made several combinations for the
purpose of crushing Maceo and Gomez
separately, but all failed.
There is considerable uneasiness in offi
cial circles in regard to the move
ments of tne rebel forces. Taken
in connection with rumors that the
main portion of Callaho's expedition
has landed with ammunition and
also that others have just landed, it may
mean that the rebels want to be prepared
to strikegCm effective blow. The news of
tiic lirs/ potion by Congress has already
reached *the rebel camps. The union of
forces aggregating 15,000 may be the result.
All the recent encounters with Somez
and Maceo were nothing but outpost
fights, and the losses were trif
ling on both sides. It is now
learned that the attack upon Sagua
tie Tamino reported as a Government vie
; ry resulted in the rebels capturing the
town and using cannon in the bombard
ment. The insnrgents in this province
also have several field guns, supposed to
have been taken from Spanish troops.
Domingo Betarte, owner of the Oyalite
estate, has filed a claim with the French
consul for the destruction of property by
Spanish troops, and also for insult to the
trench flag. Manager Duarte being shot
while raising the flag. The consul ha 3 ca
bled details to Pans.
Refugees from the interior continue io
arrive. They report great destruction in
all districts. The operations of both
armies have impoverished the country.
The stoppage of cutting and grinding cane
and shipment of other crops is reducing
the peaceable inhabitants to a deplorable
condition.
The Government proclamation declar
ing property absentees liable to confisca
tion is denounced. No one has yet been
banished for the Guatao horror. The
fifteen peaceable citizens taken from their
homes there will remain in Morro Castle.
There is one American among them,
and nearly a dozen American citizens
languish in Spanish dungeons, with no
prospect of an early trial and release, al
though in moft cases there is no evidence
of guilt.

[ From ft Staff Correspondent of the United Press. J
HAVANA, Cuba, March 11.â Bands of

Hernandez, are reported to have had an
engagement which lasted live hours with
Spanish troops at Monteguelo, near ICan

I>E LOME'S OFFEXBE.
railed to Profit by the Experience of Bin
I>redrcessor. :
NEW YORK. N. V., March 11.â A Sun
special from Washington says: ft is under
stood that Senor ' Dupuy de Lome, the
Spanish Minister, is surprised at the severe
criticisms passed on him by the Senate for
his criticism in a newspaper article of the
f-peeches of certain Senators on t: c Cuban
question. The Minister and Senator Hale
and others who defended his conduct ap
parently forgot the circumstances under
which he was appointed to his office.
In the Senate debate yesterday no ref
erence was made to the fact that Dupuy
de Lome's predecessor, Senor Murugua,,
was recalled by his Government a little
less than a year ago for hai'inir talked too
freely to -the newspapers; regarding the
dispute between the United States and
Spain over the Allianca affair. Senor
Murugua did not commit so great an
offense as to criticize speeches of Senators,
but merely cast reflections on certain
phases of the controversy, the actions of
State Department officials and others. He
was recalled by his Government. Senor
Dupuy de Lome, his successor, seems to be
guilty of similar offenses, although he does
not appear to realize the danger of suffer
ing the same punishment.

"I regard it as favorable to the Cubans.
Spain is about to the end of its resources.
It cannot send over another army. This

CANADIAN REVOLT URGED
The Dominion Republican Com
mittee Issues a Stirring
Manifesto.
Declares the Time Has Come to
Change to an Independent
Repoblic.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 11.â A Times
special from Toronto, Ontario, The
Canadian Republican Committee has
issued a manifesto addressed to the Cana
dian people and declaring that the time
has come to change from a colonial de
pendency to a free, prosperous and inde
pendent Canadian republic. Thousands
of copies, printed in French and English,
have been distributed from this city.
"We are to-day governed," declares the
manifesto, "not in the interest of our
selvesâthe people of Canada â but in the
interests of and by an oligarchy composed
of corrupt and needy politicians and
place-hunters in Canada and usurers and
bondholders in England. We are, as you
know only too well, eaten up by taxes, the
greater part of which goes to maintain
and strengthen the position of these para
sites.
'It is estimated tnat every year Canada
has to send out of the country to England
not less than about $30,000,000 to pay the
interest on Government Joans, bonds and
mortgages, debentures. This money comes
out of the earnings of a hard-working and
industrious people. We are in slavery to
these politician* and usurers."
After declaring that an attempt is being
made to draw the dominion into a scheme
of imperial federation with the object of
compelling Canadians to fight England's
foreign wars the manifesto concludes:
''England has by means of titles, decora
tions and other Â«ways, bought over and
corrupted numbers of our political men,
members of the judicature and many
ottiers to serve her purpose. These men
are England's servants and not the ser
vants of the people of Canada. It is to
these that we owe that we are oppressed
with debt and taxation and that hundreds
of thousands of our people have to ex
patriate themselves in order to find a
living denied them orrendered impossible
on ttieir own soil.
"It is time that we freed ourselves and
declared that henceforth Canada and
Canadians should no longer remain vassals
of an alien Government. The monarchical
form of Government has no place on
American soil. It is only as a free and In
dependent republic that Canada can enjoy
her political freedom and deliver herself
from her present condition of vassalage
and subjection."
The manifesto has created great excite
msnt.

NOTES FROM PALO ALTO
The Glee and Mandolin Clubs
Are Preparing for an
Extended Tour.
A Wag Hoaxes One of San Francisco's
Dailiesâ Basket-Bail for
Ladies Only.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cal.,
March 11. â The glee and mandolin clubs
of Stanford are preparing for a long tour
during the spring vacation beginning on
March 20. Both organizations are in bet
ter condition for such an undertaking than
they have ever been before, and, as it is
the first time in her history that the uni
versity has sent out on a Ion;' trip her two
popular musical clubs, the undertaking
will be watched with no little interest. A
forerunner has been sent out to engage
houses, and the clubs will give entertain
ments in Oakland, San Jose, Stockton,
Modesto, Los Angeles, San Diego and
other Southern California cities. The glee
club is well litted with soloists Ihifl season.
Field, Baker, Dillon and Abbott are a
quartet of the best soloists Stanford has
ever had. The chorus is strong, and since
Pasmore, the musical instructor, began his
work here, is much more artistic in its ex
ecution.
A concert is to be given about Thursday
week in San Francisco, and special effort
is being made by the musical talent to ren
der an interesting programme.
There is a ripple of amusement among
students here at the information in a Palo
Alto dispatch to a San Francisco daily,
which gave a startling account of an al
leged injury to coach Lange. The article
stated that he had been hit with a ball so
severely as to break his ankle, all of which
was the veriest lictiou. How the idea
originated is a mystery, but that it should
have been given a half-column space by a
correspondent is stranger still. Lange has
been receiving the condolences of his
friends all <lay over his reported accident.
Miss Keifer, manager of the Stanford
baaket-ball team, has posted the following
answer to the Berkeley girls' acceptance of
the Stunford challenge:
Miss Edith J. Browns rll, Manager University
of â  California Vajkct-ball Team: In reply to
your acceptance of our challenge dated March
5. 1 would say that we are perfectly willing to
play indoors and prefer to play before ladies
only. On account of the liability to accident
we prefer a dirt or tatibark floor to a wooden
one.
We are compelled to ask you to reconsider
the date of the game, since our spring vacation
occurs between Mari-h '21 and 30, and several
members ni the team have arranged to go home
at that time. We would find it most con
venient to have the date set not earlier than
April 3.
We wilj be glad to fend a representative to
confer with you in regard to the details of the
game on any date you may mention. Very
respectfully yours, Miss Keifer, Manager.
XORTHERX CALIFORNIA. TRADE.
Movement to Divert It from Portland to
San Francisco.
PORTLAND, Or., March 11.â The O. R.
& N. Company is cons.derably concerned
over the announcement made this morn
ing that San Francisco commercial or
ganizations intend to request it and the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company to with
draw their service between Portland and
Eureka and intermediate points in the
interest of San Francisco's trade.
As far as the O. R. & N. people are con
cerned their position was made clear to
day when they announced that they did
not intend to relinquish anything in the
shape of business at that port as lone as
they could bold it without antagonizing
their interests in the Bay City. It means
that company will not concede a single
point until it is driven into it. It is stated
that a good trade is being worked up on
the new line and the company feels that it
is justified in taking its share of the freight
business at Eur.-ka. The request is not
likely to receive much attention, unless it
is accompanied by serious threats in the
nature of a combine against the Oregon
company.

SANTA BARBARA. Cal., March 11.â
An unexpected turn to the proceedings
which were attracting wide interest to-day
occurred in Justice Crane's court at the
preliminary examination of Mort Kilcore,
charged with assault with intent to mur

Constable Clarence Kelton last Friday.
An old friend of Kilgore, Thomas Hol

appeared and offered to take Kilgore with
him to Daggett, where he is interested in
an extensive irrigation enterprise, and will
give him a comfortabie home and occupa

generously consented to permit the prose
cution to be indefinitely postponed. His
bondsmen withdrew and Kilgore was per
mitted to depart on his oÂ»'n recognizance,
leaving on the evening train.
This peaceable settlement of a feud
whicn promised a tragical ending is hailed
with satisfaction here, where the Keltons
are generally recognized as law-abiding
citizens of good reputation and as brave
and efficient officers.

CHAMBERS CAUGHT
NEAR WOODLAND
One of the Most Desperate
Criminals in the
Country.
OFFICERS GET THE DROP
When Arrested He Was Engaged
in Carpentering in a
Vineyard.
LETTER TO DETECTIVE HUME.
Maintains a Sullen Reticence, Except
to Claim He Is Not the Man
Wanted.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 11.â Charles
Chambers, alias Lamont, whom Wells,
Fargo & Co. regard as one of the most
desperate criminals, was arrested near
Woodland this afternoon by Sheriff Grif
fin and Deputies Brown and Hughes.
Chamber is wanted for nearly everything
in the category of crime, from stage-rob
bery committed in Alturas County, Idaho,
to attempted murder at Benicia in this
State.
Owing to the desperate character of the
man every precaution possible was taken
to-day to prevent his escape. When ar
rested he was busily engaged in carpenter
ing at the Edgington vineyard and did
not notice the approach of the officers un
til startled by the command, "Throw up
your hands."
Turning suddenly from his work, and
with a hammer in his uplifted right hand,
be assumed a threatening attitude, but it
was only for a second, when he realized
that escape was hopeless and allowed the
hammer to fall to the ground with the re
mark: "Well, gentlemen, what is this all
about?" But before receiving an answer
to his question he continued, "I guess I
know, but I am not the man you want."
On the Ist of March Chambers was
released from San Quentin, his twenty
vear term, less credits, at that place hav
ing expired. He went directly to Sacra
mento and thence to this City, where he
has been since March 7. His arrest was
due to the following letter, written to
Detective J. B. Hume;
Woodland, March 8, 1896.
Mr. J. B. Hume, San Francisco: No doubt
you will be surprised to hear from me, but cir
cumstances alter cases a good many times, so
I thought 1 would let you know where I am.
I am working for Mr. G. Edgington for 50 cunts
a day and board myself, so you see
I can't make much money. I thought you
could help me until I can set something to do,
so will a.Â«k you to do one of three things. You
can send me a few dollars, or you can pay my j
way to St. Louis, Mo., or you can give me em- i
ployment. I can't compel you to do this, but
I will not go hungry iv a land of plenty. lam
known here by the name of Charles Lamont,
so you can address me that way. Yours sin
cerely, Charles Chambers.
Upon receipt of the letter Hume tele
graphed Governor McConnell of Idaho,
who immediately wired Sheriff Griffin as
follows:
Boise City, Idnho, March 11.
Sheriff Griffin: If Charles Chambers, escaped
convict from our penitentiary, is in California,
cause his immediate arrest. >'otily me, so that
1 may send ar. officer.
W. J. McConnell, Governor of Idaho.
An hour after the receipt of the fore
going the following was received :
San Franctsco, March 11.
Sheriff Griffin : Have Chambers arrested at
once. Idaho new.spp.pers have bis whereabouts
and he may be informed and escape.
J. B. Hume, per Governor McConnell.
In 1881 Chambers was convicted in Al
turas County, Idaho, of stage robbery and
sentenced to a term of nine years. A short
time after his incarceration he escaped,
but was recaptured by United States Mar
shal Boblin in Idaho. His second and
successful escaps was made i?i March. 1883.
He came to California and committed a
number of robberies, and was captured at
Bcnioia in August, 18S<>, after wounding
three of his captors. He was sentenced to
a term of twenty years in San Quentin.
The otliciuls followed Chambers into the
postofiice last night and heard the prisoner
inquire and saw him receive a letter
through the open window. This letter
was from Hume. The arrest would have
been made then had the instructions from
Governor McConnell been received. From
the pvstoflice Chambers was shadowed to
the place where the arrest was made.
Chambers acknowledged to Under Sheriff
Brown that he was released from San
Quentin on March 1.
At the jail the prisoner refused to be led
into a conversation, and to all questions
propounded, answered : "I have nothing to
say." The following telegram was received
from Hume, when apprised of the arrest:
San Francisco, March 11â3:30 r. m.
G. W. Griffin, Sheriff, Woodland, Cal.: Have
telegraphed Governor McConnell of the arrest
arid suggested that he communicate with you.
Hold Chambers at all hazards. He is bad.

SEWAGE IN THE RIVERS.
American and Sacramento Choked
With Filth From Towns
Along Their Banks.
Alarming Conditions Reported by Mem
bers of the State Board of
Health.
CHICO, Cal., March 11.â Dr. J. R. Lame
of Sacramento, secretary of the State
Board of Health, and Dr. C. A. Ruggles of
Stockton, arrived in Chico this morning,
investigating the sewage question at Red
Bluff and Kedding and Chico. To a Call
correspondent Dr. Ruegles said there had
been much complaint by the residents of
Sacramento of sewage being dumped into
the Sacramento River, thereby making it
more unfit than naturally for drinking
purpose.
"What started the complaint, and caused
us to decide to look into the question,"
paid the doctor, "was the discovery
that the entire sewage of i'olsom prison
was run into the American River, and con
veyed clown that stream to Sacramento.
When the Board of Health investigated,
the defense was made that Redding, Red
Bluff, Marysville and other cities dumped
their sewage into the Sacramento River,
and the Folsom people did not see why
they should be prohibited from doing the
same. At Red Bluff, one of the prettiest
spots in the State, there is a bad state of
affairs. There are only five or six blocks
sewered at all, and the vile stuff is all
dumped into the Sacramento River."
Dr. Ruggles inquired about the sewage
of Chico. and when told that everything
was carted off in excavators he \yaa sur
prised, and said : "You are far behind the
times. A city like Chico, with such im
portance, should have one of the best
systems in the State. Sewerage is of vast
importance, and the sooner your city
recognizes that fact the better for you all. 1 '
During the conversation Dr. Lame gave
some interesting facts regarding the bene
fit of sewerage. The physicians visited the
normal school, and were well pleased with
the sanitary conditions. They will go to
Marysville to-night.
TRAGEDY AT HEDGES.
One Mexican Kills A nothrr in a Quarrel
Over a Woman,
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 11.â A special
from Hedges, a mining camp on the desert
near Ogilby Station, gives some particulars
of the shooting of a Mexican miner there
Monday night. It says:
The scene of the shooting is Sam Wil
son's saloon and a house of prostitution,
where H. Randolph not long since shot
and killed two brothers named Gonzale3.
A Mexican gambler named W, Serrano
and another Mexican named Carabojoles
qnareled over one of the women, and Ser
rano shot the other man twice, once in the
groin and the other a Mesh wound, near
the abdomen. The wounded man is fa
tally shot.
The gambler, Serrano, immediately
skipped out to parts unknown and
a warrant has been issued by the
Justice here for his arrest. This
feilo.v Serrano is from Colton, or
near there, and is one of the hangers-on at
the Wilson dive. This resort and two
others of similar character were licensed by
the Board of Supervisors of San Diego
County.
There are now five of these saloon dives
surrounding the village and mining camp
of Hedges. These saloons are not all li
censed, but the parties running them feel
sure that they have only to apply for li
cense to get it.
The Board of Supervisors of this county
have been repeatedly urged to be more
strict in the granting of liquor licenses in
such camps and in the punishment of
saloon-keepers doing business without a
license. The population there is rough
and full of fight, and the peace officers are
few.
District Attorney Sweet and Supervisor
Jasper will go there next week and will
try to straighten out matters a little.

Day and Business Generally
Suspended.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., March 11.-The
funeral of ex-Mayor Norman Rideout, who
was accidentally killed at the Magalia
mine, near Oroville, last Sunday, took
place here to-day.
The manner of the young man's death
and the sincere esteem in which he was
held by all who knew mm contributed in
making the day one of sorrow and ex
pressed regret by the wholt* community.
All of the public buildings were closed
during the dajr, and business was generally
suspended throughout the city. The ser
vices were held at the Presbyterian church,
which was crowded to the doors, while the
streets in the neighborhood were lined
with ppople who failed to secure ad
mittance.
The ceremony was conducted by the
pastor. Rev. J. \V. Lundy, who delivered
a brief and touching eulogy* At the re
quest of the family the services were very
short.
The cortege was one of the longest ever
witnessed in this city, many people being
present from the surrounding country and
following the body to the craye. The in
terment was made temporarily in the J. B.
McDonald vault at the city cemetery*
Quite a number of prominent people and
friends of the family of deceased were
present from a distance, those noted from
San Francisco being Captain B. N. Ride
out, J. R. Rideout. Homer A. Crnig, Wil
liam Steel, Daniel T. Cole and H. B. Sie
burt.

Confesses to Having Performed Three
Job* in Sir Hours.
. SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 11.â A
search of the Sweeney residence, in which
Police Sergeant James Plunketc and Patrol
driver Fitzgerald captured the burglar
yesterday afternoon, has resulted in the
discovery of several razors, a 'pistol and
some jewelry, which had. been stolen by
Hart in previous /burglaries of the pre
ceding day, and which he had carefully
yet hurriedly secreted when he found
capture was unavoidable.
The razors were found under the carpet,
behind the bureau where he had crouched
in hopes of escaping observation, and the
pistol and other articles were secreted in
the bed clothing.
At a late hour to-night Hart made a full
confession to three burglaries in six hours
and gave up the plunder.

Commissioner Kilburn's Statement of
the Concern's Resources and
Liabilities.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 11.â At a meet
ing of the board of directors of the Com
mercial and Savings Bank this morning it
was decided to open the bank and resume
business in a few days. The authorized
capital of the bank is $1,000,000, of which
only $300,000 has been paid in, and it was
decided to call in $200,000 and increase the
paid-up capital to $500,000. The full board
was present except Director Whitehurst.
Bank Commissioner Kiiburn said this
afternoon: "The bank is perfectly solvent,
and that there is no need of going through
liquidation. The matter is now in the
hands of the directors, and as soon as a few
minor details can be arranged the bank
will open for business. The Commissioners
are perfectly satisfied with the outlcok.
After throwing out all questionable so
curities there remains a good surplu:-.
The bank will be stronger than ever, and
that is saying a good deal. The trouble
was due to the fact that the bank was tied
up by some large loans."
Commissioner Kiiburn this afternoon
gave out the following statement of the
bank's condition:

Montgomery was re-elected secretary and
treasurer of the board of trustees of the

usual feature of the election is the fact
that the majority of the board is Demo

The re-election of Montgomery is a great
disappointment to local Democratic poli
ticians. The trustees present at to
(lay's meeting were Chairman Carnow
and Trustee White, Democrats, and

TELLTALE PISTOL FOUND
Concealed Under a Bunk Formerly Occupied
by Ratten, Accused of Killing
Two Japs.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., March 11.-Slow
ly yet surely the strands of the rope which
will probably end the mortal career of
Simon Raten are being twisted, and every
day brings to light new evidence that
he killed the two Japanese, for whose
death he is incarcerated in the County Jail.
Yesterday Mrs. Landsbourgh, daughter
of Mr. Rutter, on whose ranch Raten was
arrested, made a search of the bunk which
the latter had occupied while working on
the ranch, and, snuely hidden in toe straw
of the mattress, found an almost new
American bulldog pistol of 38 caliber,
two chambers of which have been lately
discharged, as evidenced by the fresh pow
der marks, and refilled with fresh car
tridges. She also found a small tobacco
sack of 3^-ealioer cartridges lying in the
straw near the weapon.
Katen when confronted with this new
evidence abso utely denied that the weapon
belonged to him and claimed that some
one was attempting to job him.
It will be remembered that both Japs
were shot with a 38-caliber ball and that
each man was shot but once. It is also
claimed that Sheriff Johnson has suc
ceeded in gathering other evid ence which
is even more convincing than this.
LOS ANGELES BIGAMIST,
The Rev. Hiram W. Cummings
Is Declared to Have
Two Families.
Sensational Indictment Returned by a
Grand Juryâ He Has Left the
City.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 11.â A re
vised version of "Minister's Wooing" de
veloped in connection with a Grand Jury
indictment to-day. Tne jury rendered its
final report this afternoon, after being in
session seventy days, and was discharged.
The report filed consists of a review of
municipal affairs and one criminal indict
ment, the crime charged being bigamy.
The name of the culprit is withheld, pend
ing arrest, but it leaked out that the per
son named in the indictment is Howard
W. Ferguson, known here as Rev. Hiram
W. Cummings.
The allegations upon which the indict
ment is based are tnat Ferguson left his
wife somewhere in the East about threw
years ago and came to California, where
he represented himself as Rev. Hiram W.
Cummings. Here he formed the acquaint
ance of Elizabeth Cogswell, whom he
wooed and wed. A child, now over 2 years
ol d, was born as a result of the union."
Cnmmings preached at University. a sub
urb of this city, and peace reigned in his
household until Mrs. Cnmmings learned
of his former marriage and change of
name. On advice of her brother. P. F.
Cogswell, she be can divorce proceedings.
Cumrmngs left for parts unknown, boast
ing, it is asserted, that he was too smart to
be caught.
Mrs. Cummings' brother brought the
matter before the Grand Jury and in
dictment resulted. Warrant for Cumrning's
arrrst was issued, with bail fixed at $2000.
He is believed to be in New York, and it is
doubtful if he will ever be brought back.
That portion of the Grand Jury's report
dealing with municipal affairs compli
ments the majority of the city officers on
the way in which the business of their
offices is conducted. It is especially
laudatory of City Attorney W. E. Dunn.
Very little fault is found with any of the
officers, although several small irregulari
ties are pointed out and suggestions made
for rectification of evils.
It is suggested, in view of the marked
difference in many instances between the
assessed valuation'of personal property on
the county and city assessment rolls, that
city and county assessors make compari
sons of personal property assessed, so as to
make assessments uniform on both rolls.
â¢The jury just discharged is considered
the best the county has ever had, although
some indictments made by it have already
been knocked out in the courts.
BUR I Eli ALIVE IX A SEWER.
Anton Puni yarrotoly Escapes Death by
Sufflcntion*
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 11.â Anton
Pusi was buried alive by the caving of a
sewer pit at the corner of Second
street and Broadway this morning and
was rescued by the efforts of his fellow
laborers. Pusi was at the bottom of a
hole over twelve feet deep when the un
boarded sides of the pit caved, crushing
him to the bottom, face downward, and
covering him two feet deep.
His companion, who was working at tne
surface, jumped down with a shovel and
began heaving out the earth. For eight
minutes PuÂ«i remained underground, not
knowing how ueeply he was interred, and
every moment feeling the scanty supply of
air growing less.
In speaking of sensations while under
ground Pusi said they were something
awful until he felt the shaking of loose dirt
and knew that rescue was close at hand.
His only fear was that he might faint.
Fin.illy the buried man's head was un
covered just in time to save him from suf
focation. Aside from a severe nervous
shock he is all right.
A HIGH-PltlCETi BEKTAAT.
The Spanish Vice. Consul Sued by His
Secretary for $22, 80 H.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 12.â F. C.
Marvella lias begun suit in the United
Btates District Court against Vice-Consul
Gregoriode Amo Gonzales for $22,. r ioo for
services as secretary and companion for
four years.
Marvella alleges that De Amo, as he is
best known in this city, was the represen
tative of Alphonso Xll, Kinn ol" Spain,
on January 1, 1891. On that day De Amo
made a contract with him to be his con
fidant, secretary and advisor for four
years, at a compensation of $10,000 a year
with board and* clothing and perquisites
thrown in.
Marveila admits that he got the board

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1896.
A REPUBLICAN DEADLOCK
The Third Congressional District
Committee Unable to
Agree.
THE QUESTION OF PRIMARIES.
Earl, Taylor and Morrow Determinedly
Arrayed Against Ingler, Mor
rison and Long.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 11.â There is a
deadlock in the Alameda Counto members
of the Republican Third Congres
sional District committee. For two
hours they tried to get a motion through
deciding what they shall recommend to
the committee next Saturday as the ex
pression of the views of this county re
garding the appointment of delegates to
go to the State convention to name dele
gates to St. Louis, and each time tb.9 vote
was even.
The proceeding were somewhat of a sur
| prise to those who had been led to believe
' that the committee stood five to one
! against primaries. It was developed that
; there had been no change in the opinions
| of the members since last Saturday and
i after many vain attempts to arrive at a
recommendation the attempt was aban
\ doned and the members adjourned to the
rail of the chair.
There was some probability of a motion
â  dispensing with primaries prevailing, but
1 just before taking a vote County Clerk
, Jordan handed in a petition asking for
primaries signed by over two hundred
prominent Republicans.
C. L. Ingler attempted to throw discredit
I on the petition by saying he had spoken
to some of the men mentioned and they
j had spoken differently. This somewhat
; nettled Frank Jordan, and after he was
given permission to speak he made a
speech that completely disorganized any
attempt to put through a resolution giving
the committee the power of appointing
the delegates to Sacramento.
"I presume you want to hear both sides
j of this question?" said Jordan, "and I
i represent, I am sure, the opinions of thou
: sands of voters of this county when I say
] that you six gentlemen cannot afford to
' delegate to yourselves the power that be
longs to more than 8000 Republicans of
this county. If you do not call primaries
; you will arouse indignation ana dis
trust, and I tell you candidly you cannot af
! ford to do it. The voters will not peacefully
! and tamely submit to your acting for theni.
This is an important matter, and is one for
the voters to decide. I have tested the
pulse of public feeling and 1 know that
two-thirds of the voters want primaries.
By shutting off the voters you are acting
unwisely. It is just such" actions in the
past that have brought into existence
numerous non-partisan movements that
have helped to disrupt the legitimate Re
publican party of this county. All lam
asking in this matter is fair play. I am
â as desirous of harmony as any one
! and am as good a Republican, and I wish
â  to repeat that you cannot afford to ignore
the rights of the voters on this occasion.
i As a citizen and as a voter I demand fair
! play, and with thousands of others I ob
j ject to your usurping the power that by
j right belongs to us. We want a voice in
I naming the men who shall name our next
! Republican President, and if we are to re
-1 main a united Republican county you
j must do nothing to excite distrust."
y. M. Fisher followed and told the com-
I mittee tnat if they took upon themselves
I the naming of delegates to the State con
j vention to nominate the delegates to the
j St. Louis convention they would be doing
something for which they were not elected.
He deprecated Ingler's suggesion that it
was "a small matter," and said: "Twice
! through such tactics as you propose to
; pursue I have seen the Republican can
didate for Mayor in this strong Republican
: city receive less than 1000 votes. Con
> sider well what you are doing. This is the
i first gun in a big campaign. Fire it
â  honestly and truly. Give the youngest
; Republican a chance to register his vote."
Miles Doody and F. A. Campbell spoke
: against primaries, but it was evident that
j the first speakers had created a powerful
impression. All kinds of attempts were
made to frame a resolution that would at
least convey some idea to the Congression
al committee as to the general desire of
j this county, but they all failed. Tue
rollcall always showed Earl, Taylor and
: Morrow voting against Ingler. Morrison
! and Long. Morrow said that he would
I vote against primaries providing the other
! side would agree to s.-lect the delegates
! from names suggested by the various dis
! trict clubs. This could not be agreed to
I and the only motion passed was one to ad
: journ. The Alameda men will go to the
i meeting of the Third Congressional com
| mittee in San Francisco next Saturday, but
I they will have no report to make.
VICTIMIZED BY A JOKER
Young Men's Christian Associa
tion Presented With a
Bogus Check.
It Was Drawn Up Over the Signature
of Wendell Easton, the Real
Estate Agent.
Wendell Easton, a man prominent in
real-estate circles, is anxious to locate the
heartless practical or criminal joker who
forged his name to a $17,000 check and
then presented it to Secretary McCoy of
the Young Men's Christian Association.
A few months ago the management of
the association started out to raise $100,000,
no pledges to be binding until that Bum
wad secured. The officers worked ardu
ously to that end. Liberal contributions
were made from time to time until they
reached $83,000. A check purporting to
cover the balance was received as stated.
Secretary McCoy immediately went in
search of the supposed benefactor of his
institution, nnd meeting him on the street
thanked him cordially for hi 3 charitable
act.
Mr. McCoy did not mention the $17,000
check, and Mr. Easton, supposing that his
brother had donated some small sum to
the institution, accepted the proffered
thanks and returned to his of
fice. Last evening, however, when
questioned by a Call reporter Mr. Easton
disclaimed having issued the check and
immediately sought Mr. McCoy in order
to disentangle the matter. Upon seeing
the check he pronounced it a forgery,
greatly to the chagrin of the secretary,
who Lad foreseen nothing but smooth
sailing in the association's future. Mr.
Easton is highly indignant at the liberty
taken by the miscreant who signed his
name to the check, and intends to ferret
him out and have him punished for his
ruthless practical joke.
Yesterday's unfortunate affair will in no
way afreet the financial standine of the
institution, and the directors and trustees
are greatly encouraged over the success of
their efforts.
There is but little question that the
balance of the money needed to free the
institution of all indebtedness will come
from a general canvass among business
men of the City, for great interest has. been
aroused, and the association's work in its
varied branches is exceedingly popular.
It is probable that the Grand Jury will
investigate the matter of the forged check.
McDONALD IS ACQUITTED.
The Felony Charge Against Him Was
Not Very Strong.
Dick McDonald has taken one more step
toward freedom, and now he is almost in
sight of his release. He was acquitted of
the charge which has been on trial before
Judge Bahrs for the past three days.
The last charge against McDonald was
one of felony for having falsified the books
of the bank by entering up a check for
$100,000 made by Columbus Waterhouse
and supposed to have been deposited only
to make the apparent assets of the bank
sufficient to carry it over the Bank Com
missioners' inspection.
The check was deposited by Waterhouse.
but it was not proved that Dick McDonald
had accepted it, entered it, or was in any
way a party to the transaction. Upon this
state of facts Carroll Cook argued that Mc-
Donald should be acquitted, and the jury
apparently coincided with this view. It
took only about three minutes for it to
reach a verdict of acquittal.
This morning Mr. Cook will ask for a
dismissal of the other charges against Mc-
Donald, and from remarks made by the
District Attorney it is not unlikely that
his motion to dismiss will be granted. At
any rate the prospects for McDonald's re-

tion on the ground that the teachers and
parents of the pupils had not been con
sulted on the matter, but after Director
Murdock explained that the subject had
been thoroughly discussed in committee
of the whole he withdrew his objection

BOX BVRGLAItIt AT SAXTA CRLZ.
Three inutu/iirrs Who Have Baffled the
Police for Three Months.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 11.â Three
boys, John Weinhurst, Arch Sch<!
neck and Chide Ranger, were ar
rested late to-night charpea with several
small burglaries that have occurred
bere during the past three months,
and the police have been greatly annoyed
at the skillfulness of the burglaries for
such youthful operators. While they
have been satisfied Â«recently of the iden
tity of the boys they did not succeed
till to-night in Becuring. certain evidence.
Weinhurst, 18 years old, is the leader, and
hails from Washington. He is believed to
have planned all the robberies, some seven
or eight in number.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Sturdy Revenue Cutter Bear
Has Shed Her Old Black
Coat.
HER POLAR CUB FIGUREHEAD.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner of the
Naval Battalion Receives the
Comasche.
One of the busiest places on the water
front is in the Main-street slip, where the
revenue service cutters are getting ready
for the coming season in Alaskan waters.
They are the Bear, Rush and Perry, and
when they steam out through the heads
for Bering Sea they will be almost new
vessels, so thoroughly have they been
overhauled and repaired. The Rush and
Perry have had their upper works made
new and new decks put in. A new set of
boats, including a steam launch, has been
built here in the City for the Perry.
The gilt scroll carving, known in marine
parlance as "gingerbread work," has been
taken off the counters and bows of the
cutters and nothing but the vessels' names
in severe gothic text ornament? the hulls.
The Treasury Department, after taking
that nondescript flag, with its vertical
stripes and dusky stars (it was really red,
white and black), from its fleet, finished
up the good work by removing the yacht
ish ornamentation also. Now the cutter 3
look like war vessels with the red, white
and blue at their xnizzens.
But the greatest change has been made
in the Hear â that sturdy steamer which is
only in her element when bucking the
Arctic ice. All her life she has been a
black bear â an animal unknown where
she has summered and occasionally hiber
nated. Now she sails undera truer color â
wnite â like the grim animal king of the
polar zone. Even the little wooden bear
which forms her tigurehead looks more lit
tinc in his fresh snowy coat. So the white
Beur will be more in artistic harmony with
her surroundings when next she is crush
ing the floes with hÂ«r ironclad forefoot.
Regarding the proposed extermination
of the seal herds in Bering Sea'as a prac
tical solution of the pelagic problem the
officers of the revenue cutters concur.
"Notwithstanding the humane efforts of
the department to save them, the destruc
tion of the seals will go on till the last one
is dead,'' said a lieutenant yesterday who
has spent many seasons In the north.
"For just as long as the skins brintr a biji
price skillful hunters will chase the ani
mals. The seizure of 'pelagic vessels only
involves the Government in expense, and
that, added to the expense of maintaining
the patroling fleet around the rookeries,
is a huge burden for the National treasury.
While a cutter is capturing a schooner, a
big fleet of the latter are going on slaugh
tering the seals, male and female, old and
young. The presence of a British cruiser
in Bering waters is a bald-headed farce, as
the English officers are in sympathy with
the Victoria hunters.
"What special use is a sealskin anyway?
Only the rich man's wife can wear one,
and why should the poor man pa\' taxes to
support an institution that brings him no
practical benefit. Even the skins when
stripped from the dead animals are sent to
.London to be prepared for market and are
the means of supporting an industry.
The United States pays out money in its
attemp; to save the seal, then pays out
money for the skin it could not save.
When the seals are gone the Canadian
hunters will go codrishiner."
Another overdue vessel is the bark Enoch
Talbot, which is reported to be nine days
out from San Pedro, bound for this port.
She has a car^'o of fifty carloads of Los
Angeles oil consigned to the Arctic Oil
Company. No information can oeiearned
from her owners regarding her condition
or whereabouts.
Lieutenant-Commander Louis B. Turner,
with a division of the Naval Battalion,
went to the navy-yard yesterday in the
tug Markhiim. Colonel James of the Gov
ernor's staff was also a passenger on board
the tuir, and his mission was to confer
with the commandant at the navy-yard
regarding the monitor Comanche's" de
livery to the state. The party was received
by the yard officials and told that the ves
sel was at their disposal.
The Spreckeis Tug Company will tow
the Comanche to this City next Saturday,
when she will be moored in the bay at
some convenient locality, probably" off
Folsom or Harrison street.' The Markham
towed down a hue steam launch from thÂ«
navy-yard, which will be a part of the
monitor's set of boats.
The Monadnock had a successful trial
trip around the bay and out to sea yester
day. She made an average wpeed of twelve
knots, the machinery working smoothly.
The bark Gatherer, the first of thÂ« can
nery fleet, sailed for the Alaskan waters
yesterday, and the new pretty schooner
Baranoffâ named after an old Russian
Governor of Alaskaâ will sail in a few
days. The whaling bark Lydia sailed for
the Arctic and the ship Roanoke for Hon
olulu yesterday.
Testimonial to Â£. J. Buckley.
The mere announcement of a benefit to the
well-known actor, E. J. Buckley, has brought
his many friends out in droves, and already
the demand for seats is an assurance ot a weli
rilled house. Mr. Buckley is now residing in
Berkeley with relatives, having returned to
California under advice of his physician.
Since his return lie has improved considerably,
although it is doubtful if he will erer again
appear before the footlights.
FOR THE NEW CHARTER.
The Freeholders Will Discuss Their
Document at a Public Sleeting
To-Night.
Two thousand invitations have been
sent out for the quarterly meeting of
the Merchants' Association this evening \
at Beethoven Hall, 336 Post street, near j
Powell. These invitations have been sent j
to all the Judges and officials in the Fed- j
eral, State and municipal departments of j
the government. The Mayor as well as :
the Board of Supervisors, the Board of â 
Education and all the City and County j
officers have also been invited to attend
the meeting. Invitations have also bt en
sent to the various improvement, commer- i
ci:il and charitable organizations of San i
Francisco. All the members of the Mer
chants' Association, comprising 337 bum- ;
ness firms, as well as other prominent tax
payers and citizens, have been requested
to attend this meeting.
The Richmond Improvement Club, the
Van Ness-avenue Improvement Club, the
Folsom-street Improvement Association,
the Highway Improvement Committee,
tmd many other associations of similar
character* have replied that they would
gladly attend the meeting.
Responses have also been received from
all of the Freeholders who framed the
charter that they would attend the meet-
ing and eive their views briefly upon the
merits of the proposed new charter.
Josepli Britton, who was the president of
the Freeholders' convention, will *peak
upon t he charter in general. He is credited
with a thorough knowledge of the ques
tion of municipal government throughout
the United States Â«nd Europe. I. J. Tru
i man, who was the chairman m the Free
holders' convention of the committee upon
the legislative department, will speak
briefly upon that article. The subjects of
iinance, revenue and taxation will be
handled by Colin M. Boyd, who has had
[much experience in these questions. G.
H. Umbsen will speak upon the executive
department. H. N. Clement, who had
charge of the article upon the judiciary,
will speak briefly upon that subject.
Irving M. Scott, who was the chairman
of the committee in the Freeholders' Con
vention upon the article governing public
worKs, will address the meeting upon that
question and refer to the important sub
ject of municipal ownership of pubiic utili
ties. The subject of public schools and
free libraries, as incorporated in the new
charter, will be explained by the author of
that article, William F. Gibson. The in
| teresting article upon the Police Depart
j ment of the City will be ably handled by
j George T. Ma rye Jr., who was the chair
man of that committee in the Freeholders'
Convention. The article upon the Fire
Department will be fully explained by M.
Hi Hecht, who has made a special study
of this subject, and will be of interest to
every member of the department. Dr.
Jerome A. Anderson will explain the
merits of the article upon the
Health Department of the City, and
as Dr. Anderson was elected upon the
Populist ticket he will also take occasion
to explain the special advantages in the
charter to those who believe in the prin
ciples of true socialism. Louis Sloss Jr.,
who was the chairman of the committee in
the Freeholders' Convention upon the
Election Department, is at present sick at
Paso Robles. The very important ques
tion of civil service in the new charter will
be handled by its author, J. J. O'Brien.
Besides these interesting short addresses
upon the various articles of the new char
ter, there will be a brief special report of
the board of directors of the Merchants'
Association, upon the past, present and
future work of the association. The impor
tantquestion of street sweeping and paving
will also be briefly considered, ana it is
expected that some action will be taken
by the meeting in reference to the ques
tion of sprinkling the streets by the City.
The board of directors extends a special
invitation to the public to attend the
meeting, but requests that all who wish to
attend should be at the meeting promptly
at 8 o'clock, a? it is necessary to open the
meeting without delay.
A BLOCK HAS NO SEWERS
An Astonishing Discovery Made
by the Board of
Health.
The Board of Supervisors Will Be
Asked to Remedy the Matter
at Once.
The Health Department has made the
astounding discovery that in an entire
City block in one of the most populous
districts of San Francisco there is not a
single sewer or sanitary arrangement
worthy of the name.
Some time a;o while going through his
district Inspector Duren discovered that in
the block bounded by Market, Valencia,
Hermann and Twelfth streets, there is no
sewer of any kind, though several small
thoroughfares, among them Brady, Stev
enson and Crocker streets, intersect the
tract and sewers had been placed in the
wide .streets surrounding tne tract.
The inspector found that the entire block
waÃ in a bad sa::itary condition, and that
the lack of sanitation had rendered the
tract a veritable nuisance, on a gigantic
scale, in tbe center of one of the most
populous districts, of the City. Health
Officer Lovelace's attention was called to
the matter, and after a careful survey of
the block he decided that nothing bat a
thorough overhauling would ever place
t c block in sanitary condition. Dozens ol
open vaults, which threatened the health
o. the entire neighborhood, were found #
and the jack of sewerage was apparent
from the stench arising from the block.
The property was recently sold by the
Market-strpet Railway Company to pri
vate individuals, and the lack of sanitation
is attributed to the corporation in not
having the sewers put in.
The Board of Health will address the
Board of Supervisors on the subject and
request that the block be resurveyed and
the sewer facilities be placed in good
shape. The tract contains a large num
ber of old and rotting buildings t.iat wiii
probably be condemned by the health
auihorities as a menace to the public.

SUED FOR LIBEL
A. B. Henderson, Ex-Man
aging Editor of the
"Examiner," Plaintiff.
THE BUCKLEY CHARGES.
He Said a Certain Managing
Editor Took $12,000 on
a Job.
NO NAMES WERE MENTIONED.
Broad Inference Drawn by the Late
Editorial Chief, and Neighbors
Are at Outs. *
A. B. Henderson, the former managing
editor of the Examiner, is about to sue
Christopher Buckley, the "Blind Boss,"
for libel.
The papers are now being prepared by
the former's attorney, H. Â£. Highton, and
â¢will be filed in the Superior Court to-mor
row morning.
Mr. Henderson bases his suit on certain
assertions made by Mr. Buckley to a
reporter on December 2'">, 1895. The inter
view with Buckley had reference to certain
political and financial transactions of C. E.
Mayne. TLe latter told Buckley that he
had "fixed" the managing editor of a
rooming paper and that he was to receive
$12,000 for assisting in running the Metro
politan Electric Railway franchise through
the Board of Supervisors, this according to
Mr. Buckley's story.
The exact language used by tne "Blind
Boss" in that interview is given in tne fol
lowing extracts:
Mayne was Introduced to me in 1890 by Attorney
George Berry, Mayne explained his railway ran
chise scheme and wanted me to take an inter.st in
it. 1 sized him upas an adventurer and one in
capable of managing such a scheme, lie said that
he had bonded a great deal of land near the parK
and he appeared to be a professional boomer
anxious 10 carry out a big real estate scheme.
I refused to have any thins; to do with the scheme,
but Mayne persisted, especially in October, 1 POO.
All 1 said to any of the Supervisors was to advise
them 10 let the thing alone, and especially cau
tioned them not to do anything looting like a
"cif an-up" before going out Of office. In November
I went to Kurope and the franchise was given
while I was in London and had nothing to do
with It.
I will say that Mayne told me during a talk
afterward that he had' made a contract with the
managins eduor of a morning paper by which the
paper was to back the measure and pet .Mayor
.Pond to sign it and receive Â§12,000 if the scheme
was successful. The paper, he said, lived up to its
agrei meat, and he said that he bad foolishly sur
rendered the contract.
About four months ago, shortly after he was in
dicted by the i.rand Jury for some fraud in an
other direction, Mayne called on me and said that
home of my â  nemies hud offered to clear him of the
lnd.ctment if I would swear to some statements they
had prepared and on which they wanted to indict
me. He admitted that I had never had any busi
ness transactions with him. He declared that he
was not guilty of the charge against him. and, as
lie had come to me for advice, I advised him to
6tand : .a! openly.
Bucklev also gave his explanation of why a
lential journal is now and has
igorously opposing him. His story m
volvea a certain nail- forgotten electric-Hght
Iraiit'rti^.: â which was not granted in I^9o.
Tbe^ proprietor of that journal came to me in
the fail of 1890 with information that he
wanted a franchise for an electric^light company
end asked me to 150 Â»nd see his business repre
sentative in the Nevada block. This man told
me that the people interested had $20,000 in
vested In the electric-light scheme and couldn't
pet a franchise from the supervisors. Then he
said, '-.Now, you own the Board of supervisors,"
and offered me 2000 shares at $2 a share. I
both declined and resented the offer and left,
but before I went I was told that the newspaper
in -ion would rain me. The attack was soon
begun and bus been kept up ever since.
it will be seen from this that Mr. Hen
derson's name, or that of the paper over
whose news and editorial policy he pre
sided, was not mentioned. It was only by
inference and direct implication therefore
that Mr. Henderson took the remarks of
the "Blind Boss" as a personal reference
to himself.
Mr. Henderson and Mr. Buckley are
neighbors. Their little farms at Livermore
adjoin. Mr. Henderson purchased his
rural retreat about rive years ago, and on
his retirement from the Examiner last
year he sought quiet and seclusion amid
his vines and fig trees.
It is by inference also that the last para
graph in the interview quoted is supposed
to refer to the owner of the same paper.
And Mr. Buckley takes occasion to express
his righteous indignation at the mere sug
gestion that he could be expected to aid in
obtaining a franchise for an electric-light
company.
Mr. Henderson -is no longer a journalist
in the active sense. He has turned farmer,
to quote himself, and rinds life at Liver
more altogether peaceful, healthy and
happy.
"I am an out-and-out rancher, he said
yesterday afternoon, when questioned
about the suit he is about to bring against
the notorious political leader. "There iB
not a fortune in it, to be sure, but there
are peace, health and contentment. What
more can one wish for on earth V"
Mr. Henderson and his attorney were
non-committal when pressed for informa
tion relative to the libel suit.
â¢â¢The complaint will be in shape to-mor
row and will be filed Friday morning,"
paid Mr. Highton.
Mr. Henderson was present, but spoke
not.
"Yes. it is a suit for libel, again re
sponded Mr. Highton, "but I cannot tell
you anything more until the papers are
prepared and the case in proper shape."

The last nigbt's racing of the indoor
amateur bicycle tournament at the
Mechanics' Pavilion drew the usual large
crowd last evening, and before the races
were called standing room even was at a
premium. Last nigbl concluded the
amateur racing as far as the management
had arranged, but the California Associated
Cyclin- Clubs will have charge of the
track this evening, and will give a meet
which promises to eclij.se any of the en
tertainment thus far offered. Besides
special match races between Osen and
Campbell, professionals, Griffiths and
Tantau, and Wells and Edwards, amateurs,
tl era will be a record trial Â»>y Champion
< )Uo Ziegler Jr., a one mile invitation race,
::i which 'all the cracks will ride, ami a.
one mile scratch. This composes a
splendid programme of racinu. and should
.ira.v a large crowd, particularly as It is a
benefit for the association, and all the
iocal clubs will attend en masse to cheer
ior their favorites.
During the week, however, the manage
ment of. the Pavilion tournaments de
cided that as the track will not have to be
removed from the building until the end
of this week it would hold three days'
professional racing â Friday, Saturday
and Sunday afternoons and even
ingsâthe races to be competed in
by the champion women riders of
the world. How Manager Wikidel got
these people out here so quickly and with
out, anyone knowing his intentions seems
a mystery, but it is a fact that they are
here and stopping at the Palace Hotel.
On Monday evening the three star lady
bicyclists of the world arrived. They are
Miss J)ottie Farnsworth of Minneapolis,
Miss Peterson of Chicago and Miss Mack
of New York City. They are under the
management of A. A. Hanson, the world's
long-distance road champion, whose ar
rival here was noted in yesterday's Call.
The ladies hold remarKable records for
both long and short distance riding. Miss
Farnsworth's best record is 300 miles,
made on a seventeen-lap track, In 15
hours 4S minutes, and she also holds the
hour record of twenty-one miles, seven
laps, made on a twelve-lap track.
The management has secured several
local lady riders to compete against these
cracks, and the programme as arranged is
as follows: They will ride for long-dis
tance records each afternoon from 3 to 4:30
o'clock, and in the evenings from 8:30 to
10:30. They will also ride individually
each evening between times for the short
distance records. Hanson, the profes
sional, will also show his endurance and
speed in trials against time.
It is now seven years since lady cyclists
have been seen here on the track. In 1889
Helen Baldwin, Kitty O'Brien and several
others came here and raced on high wheels
at the pavilion. The tournament was very
interesting at the time. Of that aggrega
tion Miss Baldwin is the only one now
connected with the sport, but she is no
longer the champion of old, Miss Farns
worth and the others who are now here
having repeatedly defeated her in the East.
A quartet of prominent wheelmen from
different parts of the country appeared at
the track last night, much to the surprise
of their many friends here. They were R.
C. Lennie of Chicago. E. E. Stoddard of
Cleveland, M. M. Shields of Los Angeles,
and Sanford Plummer, captain of the Bay
City Wheelmen, who has been away for
some little time. They all expressed re
gret at not having reached here sooner
after they had witnessed the splendid
night's sport.
During the evening P. Metcalf of the
Imperial Club tried for the world's half
mile paced record, flying start. He was
paced by J. P. Jaegling and J. S. Egan on
a tandem and covered the half in 1:01,
which is not only the world's indoor
record, but lowers the coast record for
merly held by F. M. Byrne. The tandem
covered the half in 1:00 3-5, and kept on
riding, making the mile in 2:07 3-5.
Sanford Plummer acted as referee of the
races, Mr. Welch resigning his position of
honor for the evening.
During the evening Agnew and Kenna,
Acme Club, tried for the quarter-mile fly
ing-start tandem record, covering the dis
tance in :29 2-5 seconds, which is over the
record of Egan and Jaegling.
This afternoon at 4 o'clock B. D. Blake;
lee of the Chicago Cycling Club will try
for Emil Ulbricht's twenty-rive-mile rec
ord, against time, paced by tandem teams
of the Imperial Cycling <Jlub.
The first race last night was a one-quarter
mile scratch, run in four heats, two semi
finals and a final. The winners of the four
preliminary heats were N. Ackerman, San
Francisco "Road Club; J. E. Edwards,
Olympic; George Tantau, Olympic, and
H.'B.' Freeman, Bay City. Edwards won
his semi-final against Ackerman in 34 1-5
seconds. Tantau beat Freeman in the sec
ond in a pretty finish. Time, :34 2-5.
In the final heat Edwards and Tantau,
both Olympics, competed. The former
won the" race with apparent ease in 35 4-5
seconds, slow time for him.
The-one-mile handicap was run off in
eight preliminary heats, two semi-finals
and a final. The winners of the heats,
their handicaps and riding times were:
A. Thieson, California, 120 yards, 2:15 4-5;
T. Delmas, Garden City, 50, 2:04; M. M.

60, 2:191-5; C. M. Smith, Garden City, 70,
2:17 2-5, and Ed Chapman, Olympic, 85,

Delmas beat Theison, Cook and Day in
the first semi-final in 2:15 3-5 from 50
yards. Cook was second. Chapman, 85
yards, took the second in 2:19 from Smith,
Cushing and Boyden, they finishing in
that order.
Delmas, Garden City, 50 yards, M. M.
Cook, Imperial, 80, and Chapman, Olym
pic, 85, rode out the final heat. Delmas
caught up his handicap in two laps and
won in 2:28 1-5, Cook second. It was a
very pretty race.
The final heat of the ten-mile club. cup
race proved the most interesting and ex
citing event of the evening. The race had
beenrun in five preliminary heats during
previous nights of the tournament, and
those who had qualified for the final last
night were: C. S. Wells, Bay City Wheel
men; H. W. Squires, Acme Club Wheel
men; L. S. Leu'itt, San Francisco Road
Club, and C. Birdsall, California Cycling
Club. They covered the first mile in
2:36 1-5, and increased the pace a little on
the second, making the two miles in
5:05 1-5; three miles, 7:42 2-5; four,
10:18 4-5; five,' l2:s3; six, 15:31 1-5; seven,
18 :07 4-5 ; eight, 20 :43 2-5 ; nine, 23 :27 3-5.
On the last two laps of the tenth mile a
pretty sprint occurred between the four
riders. Wells and Squires drew away
from the other two, the former winning in
25:58 2-5. amid great applause.

ably not since the introduction of "ladies'
day" has such a large crowd filed in
through the gates of the new course. The
grand stand was filled to overflowing with
fair sport-lovers, resplendent in summer
suitings and pretty colors. In fact so
packed did the big stand become that
breathing space was at a premium, and
not a few young ladies sauntered up and
down the asphaluim in front of the stand.
The male portion of the crowd elbowed
one another in the betting ring, many of
them coatlesa in an endeavor to keep
cool. Many faces new to the game were
present, and tne legal turf advisers were
in their element initiating the unsophisti
cated in the elements of placing their dol
lars on the right horse.
The sport was most enjoyable, the seven
different events all being well contested.
Short-priced horses in the betting ring are
not popular with a big crowd, and it hap
pened to be one of those day s that a soli
tary favorite failed to get to the wire in
front. In the way of odds Andy Blakely's
old jumper Bassanio carried off the
laurels, taking the hurdle race with 30 to 1
aeainst him.
The event with the most class about it was
the seven-furlong handicap with six speedy
three-year-olds facing the starter, and a
great contest was looked forward to. In
the betting Kamsin, with top weight 118
pounds, had first call with 11 to 5 about
him. For second-choice honors Benham
and Sir Vaaaar were quoted at the same
figure, -iy % to 1. Sam Leake, at one time
as good as 8 to 1, proved the superior of
the partj'. Maeklin took him out in front
when the barrier was raised and the Dare
bin colt galloped all the way, winning as
he pleased by a couple of lengths. Red
Pike, who ran in second position to the
stretch, was in turn passed by both Ben
ham and Sir Vassar, and they finished
second and third respectively.
Eleven two-year-olds sported silk in the
opening three-and-a-half-furlong smn.
There was a hot tip out on the Aunt
Jane filly named Jane Andrews, causing
her odds to come down from 10 to 5 to 1.
Closely pressed by the 40 to 1 chance,
Viking, she led all the way, beating the
outsider out a nose. Early Notice, the 8
to 5 favorite, finished a close third.
Seventeen selling platers next started in
a five-furlong scramble. Candor, the \%
to 1 third choice, was in front from the
iun:p, and won by two lengths. Road
Warmer, a heavily touted good thing, run
ning in second place all the way, was
beaten out for the place the last few jumps
by the 15 to 1 shot, Hiram Argo.
The mile-and-a-quarter handicap hurdle
affair resulted in a big upset. There was
no pronounced choice, The Lark, Silver
ado, Red Will and Arctic all being well
played. Silverado, The Lark and Red Will
all took a turn at leading over a juim>. T.
Murphy, astride old Bassanio, gradually
edged his way to the front, and taking the
last hurdle in the lead, won in a drive by
a length, with Silverado second, a neck be*
fore the outsider Esperance.
The record-breaking Vinctor cut a sorry
figure in the mile-and-a-quarter selling
event. He remained at evens throughout
the betting, and iiaished a poor third.
Coady, on the 11 to 5 second choice Thorn
hill, took the lead shortly after the field
was pent away, and full of vim, showed the
way to the wire, finishing a length before
Red Root, who ran a remarkably good
race.
The sixth event on the card was a six-fur
long run, with the old-time favorite Felix
Carr seen up on the back of honest-going
Braw Scot. The gray gelding with his
popular rider was a 9 "to 5 favorite in the
ring. Service and Sweet Rose were the
most played of the other starters. Felix
as usual got his mount away first, but was
soon passed by Uncertainty and Sweet
Rose. Service was never headed, winning
by three parts of a length. Carr on tne
gray passed all of the others in the stretch,
and although riding a good finish was un
able to catch the leader.
The last race, a rive-furlong dash witb
ten starters, was captured very easily by
Philomena, one of the second choices in the
bettinir, who led throughout the running.
Model at 25 to 1 beat dalisbury II half a
length for the place.
Track and Paddock Items.
Arctic broke down in the hurdle event.
Eighteen bookmakers cut in yesterday.
Grannan made one of the swell plunges
on Service.
According to actual count, 5266 ladies
passed through the turnstiles yesterday.
R. Stipe, who raced the fast sprinters
Lottie D and Redlight, has been reinstated
by the Board of Stewards of the California
Jockey Club. Stipe was ruled off the Bay
District track about one year ago.
W. Clancy was seen in the saddle yester
day astride The Lark for the first time
since his accident some weeks ago. The
handicapper was too liberal in his allot
ment ol weigtit on J. Talbot Clifton's
horse.
While running in second position in the
hurdle race Red Will fell at the third
jump. His rider. Swift, escaped without
injury.
biarter Caldwell was a trifle previous in
sending away the horses in the Braw Scot
race, and as a consequence Sir Reel, Edge
mount and Walter J were left at the post.
Sweet Rose opened a 6 to 5 favorite for
the sixth event, but receaed in the betting
to 3Vi to 1.
The Gunst selling stake, McLaughlin
handicap, Racing stake, Beverwyck
steeplecuase handicap, Burns handicap,
Pacific stake and the April special will all
be decided at the coming meeting at the
Bay District.
Stole a Bible.
George Russell, a well-known petty larceny
thief, was booked at the City Prison last night
by Detectives Egnn and Silver on a charge of
petty larceny. He went into the store of the
American Tract Company, 735 Market street,
yesterday afternoon and stole a Bible. He was
observed and was chased and captured. He
recently served six months for stealing per
fumery from Wakelee it Co.'s drugstore.

THURSDAY MARCH 12, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Foraker will go for McKinleyâ but how?
The Senate might as well advertise to
recognize Cuban independence whilÂ« you
wait.
While the State committee waits the
confusion increases and the people grow
impatient.
The bicyclers have made up their minds
that wherever they see a record they will
run over it.
Olney'B secret visit to Boston is worth in
vestigating. He may be sprouting a little
boom in his bacK yard.
It is the general opinion that the funding
scheme is aead for this session, but the
thing will bear watching.
Now that Sherman and Hoar have had
a spat there is no reason why Sullivan and
Kilrain shouldn't return to the ring.
Cleveland is said to be worried about
Cuban independence, but he might get it
off his mind if he would take it on his
ha nds.
The Spanish Embassador at Washington
is another of those diplomatists who talk
too much without concealing their
thoughts. *
Santa Rosa is far enough along with her :
festival to start the battle of the ballots j
for the election of a queen, and practically ;
the frolic has begun.
King Humbert may be ri^ht in saying
the Italian^ can vet extract honor from
Abyssinia, but he is more likely to extract
nothing bat a blood red dye.
There is nothing surprising m the dis
covery that Europe is opposed to the Mon
roe doctrine, seeing that the doctrine is
decidedly opposed to Europe.
There have been many new parties
starred in various parts of the country
this year, but in every case the platform
has been made of chestnut planks.
A few more bad breaks like those of
Bayard and De Lome will convince the
world of the advisability of using diplo
macy as an asylum for the Uumb.
Senator Hoar has the honor of being the
first to introduce the cathode ray meta
phor into the Senate, but somehow it did
not seem to lighten up the subject.
It is now reported that a serious conflict
iÂ« expected between the Cubans and the
Spaniards, but it will probably turn out to
be no more than a conflict of dispatches.
Now that the House has begun consid
eration of a return to the reciprocity sys
tem there is a chance for men of all parties
to get together and do some good worn for
the country.
The Cuban planter? who have appealed
to the Captain-General for a suspension of
taxes are right. If laws are to be sus
pended during war the tax laws should be
fiung up with the rest.
It is hardly worth while for Washington
correspondents to contradict the story that
Olney and Cleveland have fallen out. If
they ever get out of the position they are
in they will have to climb out.
As Austria has followed Germany in
placing restrictions upon American insur
ance companies, it seems more evident
than ever that if we cannot have recip
rocity, we must try retaliation.
When Senator Hoar accused Senator
Sherman of saying "an improper thing in
an improper way" he probably intended
hia remark as an illustration of how to say
that kind of thing in a proper way.
Congress has at last incorporated the
National University and given it large
grounds at Washington, but it remains to
be wen whether it will grow as a great en
terprise or languish as a political job.
Havana loyalists denounce Congress,
Congress denounces Spain, Spain de
nounces the Cubans, the Cubans denounce
the Havana loyalists; and so the talk goes
round until the grand revolution of de
nunciation is complete.
The Pittsburg convention, that proposes
to brine together in a new party Populists,
Prohibitionists, Silverites, Woman Suf
fragists, Greenbackers and Single-taxers,
may effect a combination of the kind, but
it will never succeed in getting such a
party composed.
Tiio Sacramento Bee suggests that all
Pacific Coast delegates should go to the
National conventions impartial as to can
didate?, but resolute for free silver coin
age, and the suggestion has sufficient
merit to make it worthy of attentive con
sideration by all friends of genuine bi
metallism.
Expert students of the drift of Republi
can sentiment afsert that Allison is the
second choice of the friend? of all other
Presidential candidates in the East and
leads them all in the West. On the basis
of that estimate it would seem he is pretty
s"re to be the winner in the convention
end before the country.
The report that the admission of New
Mexico a? a State is strongly opposed be
cause it would add two silver advocates to
the Senate shows the extent to which the
roldbu^'s are willing to carry their oppo
sition to bimetallism. They not only
stand in the way of legislation, but even
endeavor to check the development of the
Union itself.
v-: -â 
UNPLEDGED DELEGATES.
Presidential politics this year means Re
publican politics. It is nlmost literally
true that at this time there are no candi
dates for the Presidency except those who
belong to r the Republican party. Num
erous as are the factions into which
democracy is divided not a single one of
them lias a champion who is looked upon
as a Dossible party leader in the campaign.
The Populists, though not so divided as
the Democrats, are equally leaderless, so
far as the Presidential race is concerned.
In consequence of this, all interest in the
choice of the next chief executive of the
Nation is directed to the contest among
Republican leaders, and th<Â»ir relative
chances are being carefully studied by
acute politicians in all parts of the
country.
A significant feature of the situation is
that while every section of the East has
some favorite candidate, the whole of the
Greater West is virtually impartial. The
two great divisions of the country in
this respect present a striking contrast.
Beyond the Missouri there is an incessant
struggle among the friends of the various
favorites to win this or that advantage,
but on this side the continent there
is a calm unbiased scrutiny of the situa
tion, and a careful watch of the drift of
events for the purpose of determining
which candidate, all things considered, is
best fitted to lead the party to victory and
most certain to assure the country au ad
ministration that will advance the welfare
of all.
The advantage which this condition of
affairs gives to Western statesmen cannot
be overlooked. With the East divided and
the West uncommitted to either side, it is
almost a foregone conclusion that the
Western delegates to the St. Louis conven
tion will determine the result of the con
test and name the next President. It 13
too early to speculate as to whom that will
be. It is fairly certain the great majority
of Western delegates will support the man
whose nomination will give the most satis
faction to the country as a whole without
regard to local favorites. Having no local
favorite of their own, they will be in a
position to do that effectively and
promptly and thus prevent anything like
a prolonged deadlock, which would be
sure to result if the Western delegates,
like those of the East, were devoted to some
single candidate to the exclusion of all
others.
It seems clear, therefore, that the policy
of the Western States at this juncture
should be to send unpledged delegates to
the St. Louis convention. However great
may be the admiration in this or that
State for some particular candidate there
should be no attempt to bind the delegates
of the State to the fortunes of the favorite.
All the candidates are able men, well fitted
to hold the high office of President. The
one issue is to have the selection made in
the convention by impartial delegates and
without a heated contest. That can be
done only by leaving the West as free as
she is to-day, to review the whole situation
and name the man who best deserves the
honor.
OAKLAND'S TREE MARKET.
The people of Oakland, inspired by the
earnest movement to secure a free market
in this City, are agitating the question of
such an institution on that side of the bay.
The Oakland Enquirer has exploded the
idea that Oakland really has a free market
and shows how the institution at present
there interferes with the legitimate busi
ness -of the city. A good many years ago
the Council passed an ordinance permit
ting hucksters to sell from cans on Lower
Broadway, with the reservation that the
carts should not block the street. Through
some official mismanagement not ex
plained by our contemporary the tratlic
in the street was so seriously impeded by
the carts that the ordinance was rescinded,
and so the free market perished.
Then there appeared on the scene a
thrifty citizen who leased a vacant block
in the vicinity, built some sheds and let
stalls to the hucksters at a small but
highly profitable rental. He has been
doing a handsome business ev r since, but
the situation is inconvenient, and the
growers have to pay for the privilege.
Hence Oakland has no free market and
does not enjoy the benefits of one.
The movement in San Francisco is
slowly taking shape, but nothing definite
has been a<? yet formulated. An elaborate
suggestion to the Harbor Commissioners
from the fruit-growers of Campbell, in
Santa Clara County, contemplates such a
surveillance by the commission as is not
provided for in the law defining its duties.
Nevertheless the ideas are good, and
might serve as a suggestion to the Legis
lature. It contemplates a strict regulation
of sellers in the interest of honest dealing
and for the protection of purchasers.
The peddlers who cry fruits and vegeta
bles from house to house in the City sorely
try the patience of many residents, for
even the disfiguring sign, "No Peddlers,"
does not prove a safeguard against all in
vaders. The police have just announced
their belief that numerous burglaries re
cently committed in the Western Addition
were the work of professional burglars
taking advantage of the freedom permitted
to peddlers. This has become a serious
menace, and requires correction. To what
extent a free maruet would curÂ« the evil
would have to be determined by experi
ence, but the fact remains that the ped
dlers are not growers and that they antag
onize the interests both of growers and
commission merchants.
COLONY SUPERVISION.
The Stockton Independent, referring to
the Kenwood Colony scandal, near Santa
Rosa, declares that throughout the San
Joaquin Valley land-owners have subdi
vided fertile and inviting tracts, and, by
reason of not having advertised them, are
wondering why strangers are not attracted
to them but are swindled by irresponsible
colony managers. The problem furnishes
its own explanation.
Comparatively few colony schemes in
the State have been conducted on a dis
honest or ;.ncompetent basis, but their
number has been sufficient to work im
measurable damage. The Kenwood Colony
may be used as an illustration. Eastern
agents of the company induced settlers to
come to California and buy homes In the
colony with the assurance that the title
was perfect and would shortly be deliv
ered. After the settlers had established
themselves by the expenditure of consider
able money they were amazed to lind them
selves confronted with ejectment suits
brought by the original owner of the land â
the company had never paid for the prop
erty. That one affair, though not repre
sentative of our colonies in general, will
cost California millions of dollars.
It would seem that in view of such
frauds â perhaps it was merely a case of
mismanagementâ the Lesislature should
provide for a careful supervision of all
colony enterprises. Although it may not
be desirable to increase the number of com
missions, such an institution might be the
best for this case. Whatever the machinery
provided for the supervision, colony com
panies should be required to file a deed
and abstract of titles with the Secretary of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, ISC6,
State, a bond should be given for the pro
tection of buyers and a certificate author
izing the company to do business should
be issued. In addition the company
should be required to file copies of all con
tracts of sales made with purchasers and
to report the exact condition of business
at stated times. No colony should be cer
tified unless it owns a clear and undis
puted title to the land and means should
be provided for recovery by the settlers in
case of misrepresentation or damage.
The earlier colonies of the State, particu
larly those in Fresno County, were
honestly projected and have produced the
most gratifying results. The colony idea
is the best imaginable for inducing settlers
from the East, and as it is the one plan
that offers the strongest inducements to
persons oi s^mall means, it should be sur
rounded with every possible safeguard.
There are many honest new colonies in the
State, but how ia a stranger to distinguish
between them and the others? It is the
duty which the State owes itself to assume
supervision of the practice.
GOLD MINING IN (lALIFOENIA.
The question of bimetallism or free
coinage of silver apart, it cannot escape the
attention of any student of the monetary
situation that there is a renaissance of gold
mining in California which promises not
only remarkable but almost marvelous re
sults. It is an old saying, but a true one,
that only the surface of the ground has
been scratched over in California, and that
placer claims which seemed to have been
worked out with pick, shovel and rocker
are now known to be only surface indica
tions of deposits of auriferous ore beneath
the surface which can be developed only by
patient research and the employment of
scientific methods.
It is idle to make predictions as to the
output of gold for the current year, but it
is permissible to make surmises and con
jectures based on developments already
made and the actual work that is being
done, and, with this as a basis, it is within
the bounds of reason and probability to say
that California within the year 1896 will
add to the world's store of gold from
(20,000,000 to $30,000,000. It must be borne
in mind at all times that there are hun
dreds of gold mint-s held in private owner
ship which never make public their out
put, and so closely is the secret kept that
even the summary made yearly by Wells,
Fargo & Co. does not include the work of
these private holdings.
Englisn papers and reviews have made a
great potter about South African gold
mines, promising all sorts of dividends
and profits to those who have invested
their money on the advice of Barnato and
his friends aud allies; but when the bal
ance sheet is made up at the end of the
present year no one need be surprised to
see California resume her former position
as the great gold-producing section of the
world, and that, too, in spite of the won
derful discoveries and developments in
Colorado. The mountains, hills, valleys
and gorges of the Sierra Nevada and Coast
Range are in reality almost an undiscov
ered country, and, with the aid of modern
anci cheap processes of extraction anu re
duction, gold-bearing ore can be worked at
a prolit which a few years ago would have
been pitched on to the waste dump or used
in a crude way as macadam. We may
look with confidence for the year 1896 to be
a banner year for gold mining in Califor
nia, and to recali the traditions of the "fall
of '49 and the spring of '50."
BEWAKE OF ALASKA.
The warning of an ola resident of Alaska
to all who may be tempted to seek tbeir
fortunes in the gold fields of that region
should be heeded. Ke declares that nearly
half of the men there now are destitute
and unable to secure employment. All
the established mines accessible from the
coast are fully stocked with miners, and
prospecting and developing are all that is
left. As for employment in other voca
tions, there is none to be had.
There is no doubt that much truth exists
in the accounts of rich discoveries that
have been made there, but the hardships
which accompany the industry are too se
vere for any except those sufficiently
equipped. Provisions are necessarily very
dear, and no work of any kind Is possible
during the greater part of the year. The
mines which have secured rich returns are
owned by wealthy corporations enjoying
every facility which a poor man is denied.
The recent reduction in steamer rates to
Alaska, coupled with the fabulous stories
of rich discoveries, has resulted in crowd
ing the boats engaged on the run. Hun
dreds with barely sufficient to pay their
passage are going north. They do not
realize that the conditions are wholly dif
ferent from those in new mining camps
elsewhere. The extreme cold imposes lim
itations which prohibit an ordinary min
ing boom. An evidence of the severity of
the cold is shown in the fact that in pan
washing for gold the quicksilver will not
act as it does in a milder climate, but per
mits all the float gold to escape, retaining
none but coarse gold.
Alaska has great possibilities for wealthy
investors, but not for men who depend on
their daily labor or wno want to take the
chances of making a valuable discovery in
prospecting. It is one thing to find a rich
deposit in that remote and difficult region
and another to obtain a purchaser. As for
depending on what may be secured by
pan-washing in the glacial moraines, con
sidering the very short season during
which that raav be done, it should appall
the hardiest spirit. Besides, the richest
deposits are far inland, to which no one
dare penetrate unless he be amply pro
vided with money and provisions.
ATI INGENIOUS SAFEGUARD.
George A. Fleming, a fruit-grower of
Visalia, has devised so ingenious, simple
and efficacious a scheme for protecting
orchards from frost that it should be
known as widely as possible. It should be
borne in mind that frost occurs only when
the air is still. Hence fires built around
an orchard will send their heat and vapors
straight up into the air, while building
them among the trees would be dangerous.
Mr. Fleming, after various experiments,
hit on the following plan. Pie thus de
scribes it: "We built wire frames on our
low truck wagons, stretching th-em from
four wagon* stakes and heaping wet
manure over them. Dirt was thrown on
the wagon-beds to protect them, and pots
of burning tar were act underneath the
straw roof. A barrel of water on the
wagon was used to keep the straw wet.
The?e wagons were driven about and did
the best work, as they could go wherever
most needed. The smoke and vapor were
carried to the rear as the wagon moved,
and, being at once out of the mine heat,
fell close to the eround in a long white
trail. At daylight our whole 400 acres of
orchard was covered with a white foz ex
tending from the ground about twenty
feet high."
That seems to be a perfect solution of
the problem. The wasrons may be driven
among the trees or anywhere else, and the
blanket of vapor left behind is a sure pro
tection against frost. The idea is econom
ical, the question of fuel being one that
j every grower can answer for himself.
QUINCY ON SINGLE TAX.
Boston's Aristocratic Mayor Surprises and
Delights the Disciples of Henry George.
The single-tax advocates of Massachusetts
consider that they have won a victory by eu.
listing Mayor Josiah Quincy of Boston in their
behalf. Mr. Quincy belongs to the blue-blooded
stock of the old Bay State. At a recent single
tax banquet Mayor Quincy was one of tha
speakers and brought forth great applause by
his sentiments. He declared that it was a
great pleasure to meet with a class of people
who appreciated the definite and vital impor
tance to a community of its tax laws.
"It strikes me as the most important thing
â¢bout this single-tax movement," said Mr,
Quincy, "that you recognize so fully what the
average citizen fails to recognize, uot only the
importance and influence upon a community
of the tax laws, but also that you see the great
benefits that can be wrought out by wise and
intelligent changes in the laws affecting taxa
tion, which will remove tiie burdens from in
dustry, which will give a better field ior busi
ness and which will distribute taxation
equitably and justly throughout the commu
nity.
"bince I have seen the progress of the single
tax, since I have seen the number oi active
and intelligent citizens whom it has enlisted,
and seen the enthusiasm which it has aroused,
I have felt that the single-tax doctrine and the
single-tax movement was something that
would have to be reckoned with.
"It seems to me from the standpoint of the
single tax that you are right in ieeling that
you are supporting a movement for the sim
plification of our present tax system In tnli
commonwealth and for placing the whole
burden of local taxes upon real estate.
"I am a strong believer in one of the ideas
made very prominent in the single-tax move
ment, the Vienefltof a simple system of taxation
as against the mass of complexity which we
labor under to-day.
"I am also in hearty sympathy with the idea
embodied in the principles of the single tax
that the attempt to levy taxes on personal
property ought to be abandoned. If experi
meuts have proven anything, t nev . have
proven the utter futility and impossibility of
collecting taxes upon personal property.
"A tax of that nature must be unequal in its
effect and a penalty upon the man who is hon
est enough to be willing to disclose all his
property, and it must of its very nature give
preference to those who believe that the State
has no business to levy taxes on their personal
property.
"1 feel very strongly in favor of the idea of
leaving a broad field for business and enter
prise, which I understand is one of the cardinal
points of the single-tax doctrine, and trie
moro 1 reflect upon the subject the more I. am
impressed with the great and effective change
which it would make here in the city of Bos
ton, if we could lift the laXHtion off enter
prise and commerce aiul industry and leave as
broad a lieid and as broad a scope as po>Mble
in this metropolis of Is'ew England for the de
velopment of every productive industry find
trade and commerce.
"We have made some progress in this direc
tion, and I think the business men of Boston
very generally are in sympathy with>-the idea
that the general welfare oi the city, its growth
and development, require that some of the
hÂ«'avy burdens thai now rest upon business
and industry and commerce should be re
moved and that there should be a bigger field
ior the enterprise of our citizens and the pro
ductive use of capital, and that means a larger
field for the employment oi labor and higher
wages."

RELIC OF OLDEN TIMES.
Hugo Fisher, the artist, is the owner of a
centes-table that is perhaps the oldest piece of
furniture in San Francisco. It came into his
possession through his deceased wife, who was
a Miss Pond, and it \wis an heirloom in her
family for 200 years. It is now about to pass
into the sixth generation.
When and where the table was ma<le is not
known, but from its Hyppenranee it is of Dutch
origin. The earliest record of the table is that
Center.Table Over 200 Years Old.
[From a sketch.]
it was once the property of Mrs. Van Brooklyn,
wjio resided in Long Island about, tne yenr
1700. She lived to be an old woman and at'her
death left the table to her daughter, who was
then a Mrs. Mead.
For some reason the table always changed
owners on the female side, troni" Mrs. Mead
it went to her daughter, Mrs. LogiÃtron, who
in turn bequeathed it to her daughter, Mrs.
fond. Mrs. Pond left it to her daughter, who
afterwaras became Mrs. Fisher. Not having
any daughter Mrs. Fisher left the table to her
husband, and it will eventually pass to one of
their sons.
The table is a splendid example of the join
ers' art. It is beautiful in form and is made of
solid mahogany and rosewood. The different
pieces are dovetailed together and there is no
sign of glue being used. In spite of its treat
age it is still as good as the day it was made.
The varnish is scratched in places, but every
joint of the woodwork is perfect. Not v single
Diece snows signs of warping. The table is
the regulation height and the ton is abtmt two
and a half feet square. It weighs over sixty
pounds. There are two drawers in front that
have the original locks on them. The key
holes are peculiar, being surrounded by pieces
of inlaid brass that are smoothed off even
with the front of the drawer.
Mr. Fisher does not keep his treasure hidden
away as a curio, but uses it in his studio as a
color stand, for which ii Is admirably adapted.

To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
I have watched with interest the reports sent
out from here regarding the damage done by
frost to the- fruit crop in this district, wnlch '
have been very much exaggerated. At first the
outlook was rather blue or seemed so, as it
was impossible to ascertain the exact extent
of damage*. - The last couple of days I have
taken the trouble to investigate many orchards
on both high and low land, and I am confident
that the output for Newcastle will be fully as
much as last year, and may exceed it.
Ii will be only a few growers that will not be
compelled to thin their peaches. TheKelsey
Japan plum and apricot is probably affected
the most of any fruit, and there wilJbe a good
half crop of them. There la some little com
plaint of Black Oregon cherries, but the tar
tarimi.' are loaded. I might say that there are
but few apricots grown here, so it really does
not effect us much.
From the dispatches published in the San
Francisco paper* the county newspapers are
writing from, and I have already seen a couple
of articles which state that Newcastle is all
frozen m>. Geo. M. BtSBKX.
Newcastle, March 10, 1896.
SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER.
Fresno Watchman.
Under the progressive management of
Charles M. Shortridge the San Francisco Call
lias gone rapidly to the fiout as a rewspaper.
Its system of collecting State news is probably
superior to that oi any other California paper.
Its publication of metropolitan events is in
the most ehoic? form and abreast of the hour.
Telegraphic reports from all over the world are
most elaborate, and are artistically headlined
and attractively presented. Mr. Shortridge il
lustrates in the editorial department the jus
tice with which he has been termed a brilliant
writer.
Of course, we deprecate the tenacity of his
adherence to the Republican party, and while
recognizing his ability and The Call's merit,
we console ourselves with this belief that he i 3
vet young enough to eventually ripen into a
Democrat. ,
A JACKET COSTUME FOR GIRLS.
Jacket offeets are always extremely becoming
to little prirls, and the one shown here is an
unusually graceful cut. The full undetfront
is becoming alike to stout or very slender fig
ures. A stylish addition is the narrow belt,
which may be of lenther, gilt braid or ribbon.
The skirt is simply gathered into the band, a
five-inch band of hair cloth or some stiff inter
lining being set on the bottom to give the
proper flare. Wash dresses are simply
hemmed at the foot, and worn over very full
petticoats.
A dress of cadet hlue had a full vest of blue
end green shot silk. The revers and collar
were likewise of the silK, with preen spangles
net on. The round yo*e at the top of front
had rows of green braid. A dress of dark blue
mohair had a veÂ«t of batiste, crossbarred with
.strides oi many bright colors. The sailor col
lar was oi the same fabric, the revers being of
the mohair.
A white duck dress had a full front of flo
ured white lawn. ThÂ»> collar, revers aud
jacket lining were of dull myrtle-green silk.
The heavy cottons, such as duck, cheviot,
etc., make up beautifully after this model. One
of a blue and white broken cneck had a vest of
white iawn. Therouna fringe of all-over em
broidered cambric. Rows of white braid
edged the sailor collar aud revers.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
There are more ways than one of growing
famous. In these enlightened days greatness
avails a man nothing if he cannot impress the
fact in a new and startling manner on a blase
world. There is Seidl, for instance. Any one
would imagine that he wad great enough to
tour the land, depending on the magic of his
conducting alone; but Seidl knows a trick
worth two of that. His musical lore and his
artistic temperament are all very well in their
way, but the pnblic likes to have something to
stare at and talk about, and Seidl means to
give them what they want. The other day he
and his orchestra of sixty-four musicians went
to Menlo Park, N. J., to visit Edison. La
chaume, the pianist, accompanied them; so
did Sauret and Rivarde, the violin soloists of
Anton Seidl, the Conductor Who Is to Inaugurate on Epoch in Electrical
Advertising.
the Seidl tour. The orchestra pleyed all sorts
of Wagnerian selectionsâ the lire scene from
"Die Walkure," the prelude and glorification
from "Parsifal" and other exalted gemsâ and
mammoth phonographs drauk up the sound?,
while kinetoscopes reproduced Peidl in the
act of conducting. Then Rlrarde played con
certos, so did Sauret, and they were repro
: duced phonogniphically and kinetoscopioally,
' so were Lachaume's performances, and when
the party left Edison he assured them that by
the 2d of May, when, the Metropolitan or
chestra starts on its tour, a number of ma
chines would be ready to send on ahuad of the
artists, which would far surpass the work of
any human press agent. This is not all, how
ever, that the wizard has promised to do for
Seidl. Of course the great man and his solo
ists are to travel in a special car. Inside this
will be a car of the common or garden variety,
but electricity is to be so used in its outward
adornment that at night wondering rustics
will see for miles around the word "Seidl"
written iv letters of lire as the train flashes
through the countryâ all of which shows that
Seidl, in addition to being a conductor, is a
1 mnn who knows the spirit of the times in
I which he lives.
Ambroise Thomas had a pet retreat, where
he retired from the world each year to medi
tate and compose. It was a little island in the
archipelago of St. Gildas, off the deDartment
of Cotes-du-Nord. He bought it over twenty
years ago and built a charming villa there,
close to the little harbor, which was large
enough to shelter his yachts Mignon and
Trecor. M. Arnouin-Duniazet, writing in Le
Temps, has this to say about AmbroiseThomas'
retreat: "Very tiny is this isle of Illiec. It is
composed of three immense rocks, joined by a
strand of pebbles, on which thick grass has
grown up. Between two oi these rocks Am
broise Thomas built his villa, a granite
structure one story high with a gabled roof.
Three of the windows look on a vine-covered
walk, another three command a view of the
terraced lawn, beyond which is the wide ex
panse of the ocean. At the foot of the rocks is
a li t ile garden, and among the crags and cliffs
are pine trees and little paths in which the
celebrated composer loved to wander.
"It was in tin- little kingdom that Ambroise
Thomas composed 'Mignon.' The villa was
furnished by him with odds and ends that lie
had been picking up for years; old curiosities,
beuchcH and cheats that had long served the
peasantry in the "Surrounding country, but
j the living-rooms were fitted up with more
comfortable furniture. His own, room was
very simple, howver; a little iron bed in a
corner and an old chest of drawers inlaid
with copper were all the furniture he used,
but the room was hung with antique Gobelins
tapestry. The island, situated as it is between
the restless ocean and the calm waters of Port
Blanc, is a charming retreat. One quits it
with regret, custing â  lagt look at its horten
sias and yuccas, which fraternize with the
cabbages in its little garden."
In Europe it has hitherto been supposed that ;
Americans possess the monopoly of inventing
patent transformable furniture. tÂ»omo writers
have gone so far as to say that in American j
households if you take up a hand mirror you i
are apt to find that it is a frying-pan on tho |
other side ; that musical boxes are disguised as
armchairs: tea cosies as footstools; and that
neariy ali the window draperies are instantly
transformable into fire escapes. Kuropean in
genuity has lately set itself to work to achieve
.something transformable on Its own account,
and M. J. F. Cuypcrs, a manufacturer of in
struments at The Hague, now proudly an
nounces that he has invented a new type of
harmonium, which can be changed at will into
a writing-desk, a dressing-table and a book
case. The Continental press bestows consider
able praibe upon this latest addition to the
ranks of musical instruments.
German composers continue to employ the
shining hour by composing new works and
sending thent to the theaters subsidized by the
different courts, where the works are carefully
examined 'and form for the most part the
object of a special report. The Royal Opera
house of Dresden received last year no less
than thirty-seven new scores, which were
almost all rejected, and the other theaters have
had equal evidence of the industry of com
posers. Even third-rate theaters in Germany
do not hesitate to produce an entirely new
lyric work, but the production of new operas
&o fur exceeds the consumption that it is im
possible for all to be nroduced.
Le Meneslrel says: "A simple little docu
ment shows the value of Am broise Thomas as
a teacher. It is the list of his pupils who in
the space of fifteen years obtained the grand
prize of Rome at the Paris Conservatory for
composition. This is the list: 1857, Charles
Colin: 1861, Theodore Duboig; 1862, Bour
gault -Ducoudray; 1863, Massenet; 1864,
Victor 61eg; 1865, Charles Leneveu; 1868,
Rabuteau and Wintzweiller; 1870, Charles
Lelebvre; 1871, Gaston Serpette; 1872, Gas
ton Salvayre. One must add that Salome and
Charles Constantine obtained the second prixe
in 1861 and 1863."
The Bayreuth festival this year will last from
July 19 to August 19. A reserved seat for the
whole series of music dramas only fÂ«tss2O,
but of course the expense m unts up in the
cost of living. There will be five representa

VValkeure" on Mondays and "The Dusk of the
Gods" on Tuesdays. "The Rheingold" will be
given without entr'actes and will begin at 5
o'clock in the afternoon. "Parsifal" will not
be performed this year.

At Brussels "Mignon" was being performed
when the news arrived of Ambroise Thomas'
death. Marie Van Zandt. the American prim*

title role, came before the curtain at the end of

THE STRIKE IS
NEARLY ENDED.
Painters Claim That Their
Victory Is Now in
Sight.
BOSSES ARE GIVING IN.
The Master Painters Concede
That the Journeymen Have
Won.
COMMITTEES HARD AT WOEK.
1 Lathers Also Confident of Success.
Warrants Out for the Post-
Street Fighters.
There is every prospect at present of the

and Decorators' unions coming to an end
within a few days, and with success to the

Leader in the Painters' Strike.

strikers. In the case of the lathers, al
though it is a small organization, it is pow
erful, because it controls all but about ten
lathers in the City. Hence it controls the
trade, and no wort can be done un
til the strike is over. Eveu should
non-union men come to the City to take
the place of the strikers the union wouid
be quickly backed by the Building Trades
Council, of which it is a member. With
regard to the unfortunate affair on Post
street, in which several men were hurt in
a free fight, the union states that it was
started by the men assaulting the visiting
committee, and that the latter were not
the aggressors.
The painters' strike seems to be nearly
at an end, for the boss painters have
given in to the demands of the strikers by
the dozen, and now there are hardly a
dozen non-union shops in the City. Even
the prominent master painters acknowl
edge that the strikers hare actually won.
So far there has not been a single overt
act committed by the striking painters,
aDd their conduct has won for them the
respect of the general public.
THE PAINTERS' STRIKE.
The Journeymen Are Confident of
Winning a Victory Very
Soon.
The striking painters believe that they
see victory ahead and that success will
crown tneir efforts for a better condition
of affairs very soon. The master painters
also by word and action have conceded the
victory to the strikers.
Yesterday was productive of gratifying
result 3to the men. Dozens of boss
painters, both great and small, agreed to j
accede to the union's demands, and sev
eral hundred applications for membership j
were presented by non-union men. Even !
one of the Dosses asked to be admitted into
the painters' union. The working-card
system of the Building Trades Council, of
which the painters' union is a member,
still continues to be the stumbling-block,
for the bosses claim that they do not un
derstand its meaning in full." As soon as
it is explained tne bosses find but little
objection to its provisions.
The union has for a longtime past be
lieved the foreign painters to be their
enemies, who would work for less wazes
and longer hours and cut under the union
men on all occasions. Yesterday tney
learned that such was not the case. The
committees visitine the Latin quarter were
received with open arms, and every foreign
painter and boss spoken to ent' usiasti
cally agreed to stand by the union, join
the union ranks and work shoulder to
shoulder in the cause of labor. They will
be oreanized at once and become a part of
the Building Trades Council.
It seems that the fear of painters from
other cities coming to San Francisco to i
take the places of tne strikers was uo- j
fouiided. A committee of twenty-five
waited at the wharf for the arrival of the
steamer from Portland in the belief that
at least fifty painters were coming from I
that city, lliey were agreeably disap
pointed, for but one painter arrived, and
lie was a union man.
Last evening a special relief committee
was appointed to look after any painter
who is suffering for the necessaries of life ;
in consequence of being out on a strike.
THE MORNING MEETING.
Ten Permanent Committees Ap
pointed to Do Missionary
Work
At 8 o'clock yesterday morning the
! committees w ich had been appointed to

those who refused to strike assembled in
the Temple at 115 Turk street and became
\ permanently organized.
The City was laid oat in ten district
| and a committee of ten vras appointed to
look after each district and visit every
shop, job, workman and boss in every dis
trici. This was Mclvor's idea, and
upon the suggestion of President Rose
the committees were made permanent.
The men were directed to use only argu
ments and under no circumstances to resort
to force or use violent language. These

instructions were followed to the letter.
In one or two instances the committees
met men who threatened to use pistols if
interfered with, but they kept their tem

REPORTS OF RESULTS.
But Few Bosses or Painters Refused
to Co-Operate With the
Union.
Snortly after 8 o'clock last evening
President Kose appeared at the striking
painters' meeting in the Temple to hear
the reports of tne committees who nad
been at work. The hall was filled to the
dcors, and, as the chairman gave an ac
count of their stewardship, the reports
were received with cheers.
These reports showed that nearly all of
the more pretentious boss painters had ac
ceded to t!ie union's demands. Many of
the remainder said they would give in if
the others did. A very few declined to
comply with the demands. The recording
secretary had his hands fall for over two
hours entering thp names of the new non
union men who desire to enter the union.

thrilling and interesting. Among the re
ports of jobs and individuals were the fol

waliing to give in to the union demands.
Two men at Washington Hall, Union

Patterson, the boss painter on the Greek
church, said he will stand by the union.
Three other bosses fell into line with
their men. In all, thirteen places were

the terms of the union's demands. Dur

] I cations and seven bosses agreed to the
demands.
Chairman Danielson stated that the
Italian, French, Portuguese and otht-r
> painters of the Latin race joined in the
movement with great zeal, and promised
to be at the meeting in tne evening. Kven
the policemen encouraged the committee
i in its effort?.
Journeyman Painter Gabrelli. who joined
the committee and did great service, said
; that many of his countrymen were in the
: hall and he wanted to "address them in
: taeir native language. He spoke for ten
minutes in Italian and explained the ob
' jeets of the union, the strike and the card
system, and nis address was received with
I cheers by nis countrymen all over tUe call.
The next report came from the Mission
â district. Committee 2 (Parker chairman)
i reported that nothing could be done on

lon Valencia street, near Nineteenth,
I nothing could be done with the men. On
| another of Keefe's jobs four men came

Bradley's job were three old painters who
were "pets" of the boss. They had re
fused to come out. Some one around the
premises oecame scared at the presence
of the committee and rang in for the
patrol wagon. When the police arrived
and found that there was no trouble
they laughed at the timid ones and went
away. The committee called at the Par
rott building to talk with a man and were
ordered away. The committee complied
with the demand. During the rest of the
d;iy the men worked amonc the small
jobs down on the water front and with but
lew exceptions their efforts were crowned
with success.
Coir ruittee No. 5, Bohn chairman â He
said his men went to the Richmond dis
trict. Got one man to leave Cooney Bros.'
job. Two men on the Children's Hospital
â¢ inclined to quit or send in ttieir names.

more work to be done in this district to-
d a v .
Committee 8, Harter chairmanâ He said
the job at 9 Gough street is all right. The
same could be said of Beghule & Son, Jim
Hineman of 715 Fifteenth street and
Charles Abbes of Polk street. White of
Oakland has non-unicn men employed
on a job on Market street, near
Fifteenth. The committee was run
out of the house. Another job on the same
street was worked by a similar crew. G. \
A. McConneli, a carpenter at 3"_'2 Diamond

on the job.

It was reported that one or two of the
striking painters were in need of help, i

Schultz were appointed as a general relief
committee to look after those who are in
want in consequence of the strike. One or j
two men have been substantially helped j
by the union since the strike besan.
Communications were received from the
striking lathers and the District Council of i
Carpenters indorsing the painters' strike I
and promising all the help IB their power, j
Mclvor made a short speech in which he
said that the strike is practically won.
Nearij all of the bosses have given in, and
all that remains is for the men to con
tinue w stand together and show by their
conduct that they are worthy of the re
spect of the public. The fight is for non
union men as well as the union men. A
few more days will see the end, and the
end will be a victory.
Journeyman Falon called attention to
tne unsanitary condition of the majority
of the houses in this City. The Board of
Health should look into the way the paper
hangers and whiteners put layer after layer
of paper and whitening on old walls that
are tilled with the perms of disease.
The striking painters will meet again a.t
3 o'clock to-day in the same place.
THE MASTER PAINTERS.
The Secretary of the Association
Fully Discusses the Strike
Situation.
From all appearances the master painters
have an idea that the striking painters
have virtually won their tight. At least,
as an organization they have taken no
steps in the matter. For a time their
silence was construed by the strikers to be
suspicious, but from the expressions of
several of the master painters they are
now waiting for the journeymen to bring
the obstinate bosses into line and then all
will accede to the union's demands. J. H.
Warner, secretary of the Master Painters'
Association, yesterday spoke freely upon
S the strike and the present situation. He
said:
I consider that the journeymen painters
: have virtually won their fight. I, tor one,
I have acceded to their demands and am p&v
--; ing the wages asked for. The union is too well
| organized and has too much snpjort fr>m the
other unions in the building Trades for the
bosses to mate anything: like a -profitable
fight. With the Building Trades Council at
their back the striking painters can tie up any
job or every job in the City for that matter.
Their demands are not unreasonable, and why
should ihere be a fight? It is the card system
that "sticks," but even this innovation in
> trades unionism need not cause any trouble
! until it has been tried and found to be a
| failure. In the East it has worked all right, so
; I am told.
The trouble with the card system is that the
painters themselves will kill "it. ' To-day I was
told by a boss painter that he had hirad two
union painters who presented their cards. He
told them that he could not afford to p .y $3 a
day, but they told him that that did not make
| any difference, as they would accept Â£2 50.
I They were broke, they said, and had to have
the money, even if it was below the union
rate. It is just such things as this that will
make their demandsâ card system and allâin
operative before they know it. If the journey
men painters win, as I suppose they will, they
will become indifferent ana drift back to the
1 old order of things, as. they have done many
1 times before.
They have taken a strange time to strike,
when business , is so dulL Heretofore they
Btrnck when business was grood, and we had to
use their services. Now only a few of the boss
painters have good contracts, such as Tom
Downing,- for; example, and they, of course,
gave in at once- '"'.'â¢â¢ - â 'â  . and v.c had ib
their services. Now only a few of the boss
ners have good contract*, such as Tom
ning.- for example, aud they, of course,
â¢ in at once-
The strikers hit St. Denis a hard blow, and
theie are many of the boss painters who are
not sorry for it. St. Denis has the habit of
hiring cheap foreign painters or dope-slingers
to do his work and the rest of us have but lit
tle-chance against him. When a man hires
ignorant foreigners who cannot speak the Eng
lish language for .*2O or $25 a month and rinds
their board in cheap foreign boarding-houses
for $15 a month the rest oi us cannot compete
for contracts when we are obliged to pay $3 a
day. â¢
There is or.c thing aDout this strike that I do
not understand, and that is why the Master
Painters' Association has not called a special
meeting to consider and discuss tne situation.
Under our new constitution and by-laws the
president and three members or five members
can call a special meeting. So far there has
been no apparent desire on the part "of the
members of the association to call a meeting,
although I have expected for three days past a
notice from the president to call such a meet
ing. Our regular meetinz will not be held un
til the first week in next month.. v :
It seems to me that the master painters' pur
pose in keeping quiet and not taking an active
part in this strike may explained in this
way: If the striking painters successful
with the bosses who are holding out, then they
will all agree to the terms. If they arc. not
successful, then the members of the associa
tion will not be able to afford to pay higher
wages for shorter hours than their business
rivals, who get men cheaper and -work them
longer hours. ;At the present I do not believe
that the masters are looking around for new
contracts. I are looking until the difficul
racts. I tor one will not until the dlflicul
ties are settled.
LATHERS EXPLAIN.
They Claim That They Ware Not
the Assailants In the Post-
Street Fight.
The situation in the lathers' strike con
tinued unchanged yesterday, and a com
plete cessation of work in their trade was
the result. There are eighty union lathers
in the City at present, and ten non-union
men. They are striking for a rate of 75
cento to $2 a thousand on laths and work
ing hoars not to exceed eight each day ;
also 2 cents to 6 cents a square yard on
iron lathing.
The account of the encounter between
lathers at Post and Larkin streets Tuesday
afternoon, as told by tne men who visited
the place and are implicated in the trouble,
is different from that of the injured work
men. Instead of the '-isiting committee
having been the attacking parties it is
claimed that the men at work were the as
sailants. It was stated yesterday by mem
ber? of the executive committee that the
scaffold under the workmen was not pulled
down, but that in the fracas it fell and in
jured several men.
The story of the invaders is that when
tliey approached the building they were
warnea not to enter.
"If you come in here we hhall meet you
with our hatchets," a lather inside ex
claimed.
To this the crowd replied that they did
not propose to be bluffed by a few men and
would enter anyhow and rea-on with them.
And when this was carried into execution
hatchets and pieces of scantling were freely
used. A right ensued and both sides suf
fered, but the falling scaffold and k the at
tempts to escape caused more injuries Jto
be inflicted than, were actually sustained
in the battle.
The executive committee of the Lathers'
Union was to have met at the Temple. 115
lurk street, but the presence of two police
men in plain clothes, who were supposed
to have warrants, had the effect of prevent
ing the meeting and kept several lathers
iway from the hall.
TO BE ARRESTED.
Warrants Out Aeainst the Striking
Lathers for Battery and As
sault to Murder,
James McCluskey.loso Howard street, has
sworn out warrants for the arrest of Peter
Rivers, Waiter McCoy, William Pettee and
Thomas Devillis on the charge of assault
to murder, and against Walter McCoy and
Thomas Devillis on the charge of battery.
Joseph Trade, 2378 Market street, has
sworn out warrants fcr the arrest of William
Starr, Daniel Dunn and "Oakland JacK '
on the charge of assault to murder, and
his brother, Walter Trade, against James
Holmes, D. J. McCrae and "John Doe"
Perkins, on a similar charge.
Peter Tra.le is contined to his house
from the injuries he received, and was un
able to appear in court and swear out
warrants. The other man assaulted,
Charles Cahill, is also to be heard from
yet.
Charles Mars, 76-5 Harrison street, who
wa3 assaulted by strisers Tuesday after
noon, while at work in the Snirley build
ing, on Fourth and Welsh streets, swore
out warrants in Judge Joachimsen's court
yesterday for the arrest of J. Dunn, P.
Rivers and W. Betteny, on the charge of
battery. His father, C. A. Mars, who was
working with him, was aiso assaulted, but
he was unaDle to leave home, where he is
in an unconscious condition from hem
orrhage of the brain. As soon as he re
covers he will swear out warrants against
the three men for assault to murder.
E. A. DENICKE PRESIDENT
A New Set of Executive Officers
Elected for the Mechanics'
Institute.
Joseph Leggett and Oscar Lewis
Showed an Equal Strengthâ The
New President.
The board of directors of the Mechanics'
Institute at a meeting held yesterday
afternoon at the secretary's office on Post
street elected a new set of officers for the
ensuing year.
Inasmuch as President Hallidie declined
to aeain submit his name to the directors,
and In fact positively declined to serve, it
brought other aspirants into the field.
Among them were E. A. Denicke. Oscar
Lewis and Joseph Leegett. As the day of
election approached Mr. Denicke with
drew his name, thus leaving tne contest
Detween Lewis and LeÂ«cett, both of whom
had an equal number of votes but neither
sufficient to s cure an election. It was in
tit is dilemma that friends of Mr. Denicke
ur?ed him yesterday afternoon to recon-
Ernest A. Denicke. Who Succeeds A. S. Hailidie as President of Mechanics'
Institute.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
sider his declination 3nd permit his name
tn po before the directors.
This he did, with the result of getting
the necessary eight rotes on the first ballot.
Thia vote was eventually made unanimous. ;
Rodney Kenderick was elected vice- '
president, E. P. Heald recording secretary
and Joseph M. Cumming corresponding ;
secretary.
The new president, Ernest A. Demcke, j
was born in Hanover, Germany, tifty-six j
%'ears ago. At the age of 21 years h â  en- !
listed in the Tenth New York Regiment:
on the 27th of April. 1861, and served until
December 21, 18tx>, when he was mustered ;
out.
He arrived in San Francisco the follow
log year and engaged in the cipar-making ;
business. This he followed until the Chi- j
nes â¢ trouble, in which general strikes and j
other labor contentions compelled him to j
discontinue in that line of business.
After giving up the manufacturing of ;
citrars he went into the brewing business, \
and finally retired into private life.
He was* the principal organizer of the ;
San Franci.-co Signal Corp-, and i< much
esteemed hy the rank and rile of that or
ganization. _
RETURN OF THE FORGERS.
A. H. Dean and Joe McClunkejr Krought
Back Km m Minnesota.
A. H. Deon, the man who committed the
clever forgery on the Nevada Bank, and
his companion, Joe McCluakey. the'no
torious bank sneak-thief, are back in the
City after an absence of two months.
They were accompanied by Detectives
Whitaker and Seymour. and reached the
City by last night's overland from the
East. They all expressed themselves as
having enjoyed the journey from St. Paul.
Dean maue no opposition to returning,
but McCluskey, who was under arrest in
Minneapolis, tied instituted habeas corpus
proceedings and the argument was set for
2 o'clock that afternoon. When the de
tectives went to Minneapolis McClus
key, on being informed that the Governor
had signed the warrants, had the habeas
corpus proceedings withdrawn and ex
pressed his willingness to back.
The police and Pinkerton men in the
Twin Cities urged Whitaker and Seymour
to prolong their departure for a few days
till they could show them the suht3, but
thay were desirous of getting back with
their prisoner* as soon as possible and left
for this City on Sunday night, arriving, as
i stated, last'night.

speaker who has made a National reputa
tion by ncr espousal of the cause of
woman's suffrage and the temperance

mitee the New York Herald says:
Her speech was a revelation. There has not
been such an exhibition of cultivated oratori
cal art seen in either house of Congress this
session.
The Woman's Christian Temperance
Unions of the City and State are glad to
secure her services in the lecture tour just
begun. Her itinerary includes Sacramento

Mrs. Eva E. Bates Accepts.
The vexed question of a suitable successor i
for Mrs. Rose M. French as president of the '
Woman's Federation for Public Good has been ;
settled by a caucus of candidatei and mem

E. Bates of the New Woman's Club has con- '
sented to serve on condition tnat Mrs. French i
act as first vice-president, whicn sne has con- j
sentea to. do. In all probability Mrs. Bates |
will be elected next Monday- by a unanimous !
vote.
It was a new bunko game attempted by

pasted them on his latest scheme before

TO ABOLISH GOVERNMENTS.
The Ceremony of Baptizing the Red
Flag of Anarchy Will Occur
on Sunday.
The enthusiasm of the new band of
anarchists in this Cit\ has just about
reached a boiling point, and to-night they
will band themselves together into a fede
ration, which will have the gallows as its
symbol and the red and Dlack flag as its
standard.
The gallows was adopted a? the badge
of American anarchists after five of the
fraternity were handed some years ago in
Chicago. All the members of the new
federation will be expected to wear little
g iid or silver badges bearing tne figure of
the gallows under ihe coat, on the side
which is popularly supposed to be nearest
the heart.
There is great enthusiasm over the
organization, though how many men and
women will actually sign the rollcall to
morrow not an anarchist can be found
rash enough to predict. Pistio Gori will
give his eighth lecture to-morrow in
Apollo Hall, in which he will make a sort
of anarchist declaration of independence.
Afterward the platform will be read, and
all those who wish to join the Italian
Federation of Socialistic Anarchists will
be invited to step on the platform and
append their names to the anarchist roll
call.
Printed copies of the platform will also
be distributed in the hall. The document
begins with an arraignment of capital,
which, it says, keeps ali the riches of the
earth for one privileged class. "Whj
should not the natural riches of the earth
âair, light, waterâ belong to all?" asks
the document, "and why should not the
riches p-roduced by the workmen belong to
the workmen?"
The platform of the anarchist contains
some hard digs at socialism ; for one thing,
it declares that government ownership of
the means of production would bean im
mense peril to liberty, and would probably
result in a tyranny worse than any the
worJd has ever seen.
The anarchists decry the idea of any one
owning anything; tlieir platform demands
equal distribufon of wealth; forbids
the accumulation of property by individ
uals; says no state or government should
be permitted to exist for a moment, and
predicts that when the means oi living
are assured to all crime wiil disappear and
the good sense of the individual will make
it quite unnecessary to have any laws.
"Human laws," says the platform, "are a
violation for the most part of natural laws.
The best means of getting order is to create
well-being for all, then|tbere will be no in
centive to crime." There is a good deal
more to the same effect, and all gocd anar
chists have to pledge themselves not to
vote, as wielding the ballot is tacitly ac
knowledging the power and efficacy of
government, and all forms of government
are supposed to be pernicious and oppres
sive. How the anarchists mean to accom
plish their ends by refraining from voting
is not explained Id the constitution, but it
is one of their doctrines, expressed but not
written, that a great social and industrial
revolution is coming upon the world, and
that when it has passed away the reign of
anarchy, liberty and fraternity will have
begun.
On Sunday the g and crowning cere
mony of the new federation will take
place, when the red and black banner of
the new lodge will be baptized. Pietro
Gori will stand as one sponÂ»or to the
emblem of red-handed anarchy and Mrs.
A. Gaffe will be the other. On Sunday
night two anarchist plays by Pietro Gori
wiil be acted, the chief one being "With
out Country" (Senza Patria). On Mon
day the anarchist orator will take his de
parture to fresh fields and Dastures new.
Organizations similar to tne one about
to De founded in this City already exist in
many of the towns in the United States,
Including Chicago, New York, St. Louis,
Denver and Cleveland, Ohio.
"CAPTAIN IMPUDENCE."
A Drama in Which Some American
Heroes Are Kemeniberod.
Edward Milton Royle's new play, which
has been presented for the last twenty-six
weeks throughout the country under the
NEW FIVE-STORY HOTEL ON MISSION STREET, PROPERTY
OF A. W. WILSON.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.)
title of "Mexico," will be presented at the '
California Theater next Monday under
ttie name of "Captain Impudence." Tlie :
latter name fs mere suggestive of a oontedy <
production than was the former, and Mr. j
Jioyle has decided to present it under that [
title, as it is a romantic comedy and not a
lieavy drama, as the title "Mexico" would
suggest. The piece is founded on the war j
betwecn Mexico and the United States,
and recalls the exciting and glorious
achievements of our heroes in that strug-
vie. Texas, the immediate cause of the
war, declared its independence in 1835, and i
In March of that year the famous defense
of the Alamo occurred at Ban Antonio,
General Santa Anna marched into Texas !
with an army of 10,000 of his choicest
â roops and immediately besieged the j
Alamo, where Colonel Travis, with 250
men, had shut themselves up. They ;
fought until only one man was left. Santa
Anna, enraged at the loss of 1000 troops,
ordered the single prisoner to be shot and
the bodies of the garrison to be burned.
When these heroes saw all was lost, they
sang "Home, Sweet Home" until only
the one man was left.
NO PLANS CHOSEN.
Supervisors Still Listening While Ar
chitects Explain Klaborate Plans
for a Municipal Building.
No decision was reached by the Super
j visors last night in regard to the plans for
the new municipal building on Kearny
and Washington streets. The Committee
on Buildings reported back the plans of
1 flve architects without recommendation.
! These plans were then reconsidered by the
board acting as a committee of the whole,
and on motion of Supervisor King the
board adjourned till next Friday evening,
when any of the other architects who may
desire to explain their plans will be heard.
The five architects whose plans were
chosen as the best were Messrs. Banks,
Mooser^ Shea, Newsom and Smith & Free
man.
T.ere were no more indications of an
agreement than on the last time the board
discussed the plans, and at the very be
diming a question asked of Architect
Banks by Supervisor Hobbs indicated that
8 still fiutuer delay might be desired by
the board. Mr. Hobbs wanted to know if
Mr. Banks would object to putting his
plans an exhibition at the pavilion in a
couple of weeks?
"1 don't me the use of the delay," was
the answer; "the citizens would not go to
see them."
"It would be their own fault then," Mr.
llobbs replred.
Mr. Banks expressed willingness to ex
hibit his plans as long as it might be
deemed necessary.
There was no uiscussion as to the com
parative merits of the plans. The com
mittee of the whole merely reported that
t lie live plans had been examined. The
opinion was expressed that Friday's meet
ing would bring the matter to an issue.

THE NEW WILSON BTJILDING.
A Handsome Structure for Hotel Pur
poses Just Completed.
A handsome new brick building on the
; sonth side of Mission street, near Fourth,
; has just been completed by A. W. Wilson,
j It is a five-story structure, 50x100, with
j basement, and is most substantially built
I throughout. The front is designed in the
i old Spanish Â«tyle of architecture and pre
\ sents a decidedly ornamental appearance.
The ground floor is one larce store, with
| massive plate-glass windows, and thebase
' ment is finished with cement walls and

: the front rooms, of which there are six
i teen, are handsome mantels constructed
of quarter-sawed oak and tiling.
Each floor is supplied with closets and
j bathrooms, the latter being furnished with
I porcelain tubs. The plumbing throughout
; is of the most modern sanitary kind. The
' majority of the rooms are furnished with
stationary wash-stands, with hot and cold
i water connections, while neat combination
gas and electric light fixtures in every
room afford ample lighting facilities.
On the top floor is a large dining-room
and kitchen. The entrance to the upper
j floors, also the stairs, are finished in quar

The locks are all of the Yale make.
They arc arranged in sets, one set to each
i floor, each arranged to master key. All
I the hardware is of hand-some brass" metal
and is also of the Yale make. The build
j ing was constructed under the superin
tendence of William Thomas. It is now
to let and can be inspected at any time.
; The carpenter work was done by Peterson
i & Oisen, the brick work by H. H. Larsen
and the cement work by Gray Brothers.
The plumbing was executed by Richard
Rice, the light fixtures were supplied by
the San Francisco Novelty and Plating
Works, while the wiring of the building
and other electric work was done by Ed
ward F. Henzel. The mantels were fur
nished by Bush & Mallet and the elevator
is from the factory of Cahill & Hall Ele
vator Co. The locks and hardware are
from Dunham, Carrigan Sc Harden Com
pany, and tlie shaded for the windows were
supplied by E. H. Marwedel. The patent
chimneys were furnished by S. E. Clawson
A: Co., who also supplied tlie patent hoods
to the mantels, that prevent smoky chim
neys. The grill cage for the elevator was
manufactured by the Excelsior Wire
Works, while the painting, polishing and
graining throughout the building was ex
ecuted by George J. Smith & Sons.
THE SATS FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1896.
CLAIMS OF BUCKLEYITES
What They Will Demand and
Do Before the State Cen
tral Committee.
I
THE JUNTA CREATING PEACE.
Chris Buckley and Others Talk All
Sorts of Political Wisdom and
Prophecies.
The Democratic war clouds, that are ex
pected to break with tremendous dis
turbance at the meeting of the State
Central Committee next Saturday after
noon, thickened yesterday.
The Buckleyites have about put on the
finishing touches to their war paint, and
they have marshaled the ablest and
bravest of their generals and orators in
preparation for the expected battle over
the question of whether or not Gavin Me-
Xab's Kainey-Daggett organization is to
gain the prestige of recognition by the
State Central Committee.
The Buckley general committee held a
rousing special meeting in Odd Fellows'
Hall last night and adopted fierce resolu
tions declaring the stand of the Buckley
faction. A committee with full dis
cretionary powers was appointed to de
fend the interests of the Buckley side at
their discretion and to any extent of their
war resources, and to concede, treat or re
treat, as they may deem best. Tnis was
the first heavy gun of the battle to be fired.
The Junta's anti-Buckley general com
mittee will meet in Pioneer Hall this
evening. Resolutions will ba adopted and
a committee of some sort appointed. The
chief interest concerns the display of
Kainey's strength, if any such display is
made. As Herculean efforts are being
made to avoid a row with the
Kainey-Dageett forces and lo avoid
any indication that Rainey's strength is
large, it is not likely that the row that has
seemed certain will come off. Concessions
have been made to the Maxwell faction in
the Fourty-fourth to avoid striking on that
rock. Tom Maxwell held a conference
with Chairman Sullivan last nieht, and an
agreement about the delegates from the
Forty-fourth will likely be reached to-day.
Buckley has returned to town, and yes
terday he paid in an interview that it was
all none of the State Central Committee's
business, but if the committee made the
local mess its business it would have to do
something broad and fair or the people
would rise in rebellion and there would be
two delegations to the State convention.
That is the position of the Buckley
element from its top to its bottom. It is
ready with heavy-weight orators, wit
nesses and affidavits to establish and de
fend the right it claims to be "the"
regular local party, but is ready and
anxious for a primary of the whole party.
If this is not conceded it will march
right ahead to the State convention
ignoring everything done to stop it.
Gavin McXab and other representatives
of the Junta have ready fierce and eloquent
speeches denouncing Buckley as every
thing that is vile, *.nd as a traitor to the
party. But then the Junta is so largely
Rainey ana Daggett that there appears no
pru?{>ect of its getting the prestige of ex
clusive recognition from the State Central
Committee or for there being anything
else than a new deal for the local party, at
which Buckley will win. possibly with the
assistance of Rainey when the time comes.
BUCKLEYITES TAKE ACTION.
The General Committee Clears Its Decks for
the Battle.
The Buckley general committee packed
Odd Fellows' Hall last night. There were
present 401 of the 450 members, and the
spectators were many. There was saw
dust on the floor, as usual, and a Demo
cratic air and style to every feature of the
gatherings and proceedings.
Chairman Joseph Rothschild and Secre
tary Daniel M. Gavigan had a big, enthu
siastic and at all times unruly audience
before them.
There vrere* but two important features
to the proceedings. Strong resolutions de
claring the sentiments of the Buckley wing
on the local split were adopted, with some
tart and vigorous discussion, as they were
read by M. J. Donovan. Then a commit
tee of twenty-five, to right the battle before
the State Central Committee, was ap
pointed. The committee on revision of
the constitution, which had prepared an
amendment creating an executive commit
tee of ninety, did not report as it was ex
pected to do.
The resolutions moved by M.J. Donovan
were as follows:
Whereas, In public and private it Is asserted
that the Democratic State Central Committee
at its meeting called for Saturday, March 14.
1806, contemplates recognizing as the local
Democratic party organization of San Fran
cisco a bolting or rump body, known by the
cognomen of the "Junta," whose members
openly claim that the said disorganizeâ¢ have
a majority of the State Central Committee and
proxies of absent members under their control;
and whereas, said action or Interference in
local political affairs if taken, without this
general committee's special request, is revolu
tionary and contrary to all precedent, rights
and time-honored custom of all prior State
Central Committees of the Democratic party;
and whereas, all State Central Committees
have always denied their jurisdiction or right
to interfere in local management of affairs un
less the regular county organization peti
tions them so to do, and all parties in
interest consent to their jurisdiction and
agree to submit to their decision and deter
mination; and whereas, in support of this posi
tion and said precedent, we cite the latest
Democratic ruling in this matter, to wit:
When on or about the 25th day of July, 1892,
the late State Central Committee, of which
several gentlemen of the present State Central
Committee were members, a body known as
the reorganizes of Sacramento submitted a
written communication, and otherwise asked
the State Central Committee to then and there
interpose and interfere in Sacramento local
politics aud award them the management of
the party, but were answered that the State
Central Committee could only obtain jurisdic
tion by consent of ail parties in interest , and
especially the county committee joining in the
request, and all agreeing to submit to ana
abide by their determination, of the question
in dispute as to who should control and man
age matters: and \\ hereas, after such refusal
and denial of jurisdiction, both factious sent
delegates to the next State convention held at
San Francisco in August, 1894, aud the con
vention, being the sole acknowledged judges
in all such matters iv party politics,
awarded the seats to thoso entitled
thereto, and thus acknowledged that side
as the future party managers, and this we
maintain is the only course the present State
Central Committee can now lawfully follow
when jurisdiction is questioned, and" we cite
the work of Winrield J. Davis entitled 'Politi
cal Conventions in Californiaâ lÃ49 to 1892,"
and published by authority of the State of
California, showing repeated instances of Uie
authority of all Democratic State conventions
of California, from the time of holding the
first convention in this State to seat delegates
and recognize local organizations; and we
also refer to the records of past Democratic
State committees to sustain our position; and
whereas, we believe the State convention
alone Is vested with proper authority, when
the jurisdiction of the State Central Commit
tee is questioned, and that the only duty the
present committee can perform on March 14,
IH9O, in this Presidential year, is to follow the
National call issued to ail Democrats of our
country and published on January 24, 189G,
by William F. Harrity, chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, and on March 14,
1896, name the time and place of holding the
State convention, and apportion the delegates
and do such things only as therein required,
giving public notice so that the Democratic
local masses may send their representative
delegates to the State convention and obtain
their seats on the showing that they are en
titled to the same; therefore be it
Resolved, That a committee of twenty-five to
consist of the president and secretary and one
member from each Assembly district as also
five at large of this general committee with
plenary powers take full charge of this matter
and represent this general committee in any
way they may deem proper and appear before
said State Central Committee or not, as they
see tit, and
Firstâ Raise the question of jurisdiction of
said Slate Central Committee in the matter.
Secondâ if said State Central Committee
without showing on our part should decide
said question in iavor of their jusisdiction to
enter a protest and then demand the right and
proceed lo prove that we are the regularly cen
stuuted and legally existing general com
mittee oi the Democratic party of the City and
County of San Francisco. And be it further
Kesotved, That said committee of twenty-five
is especially charged with plenary power to act
m all matters in the interest or the whole
Democratic party and avoid factional ani
mosities and technical disputes detrimental to
our party's welfare and are hereby authorized
in their discretion to waive some of our fixed
rights with the hope of uniting the Democra
tic party.
The following committee was appointed
to appear before the State Central Com
mittee:
Twenty -eighth District, J. H. Goldmeyer;
1 wen ty-ninth District, Thomas Egar ; Thirtieth
District, E. Isaacs; Thirty-second District,
Kiehard Barry ; Thirty-third District, John

CHRIS AND_OTHEEB TALK.
Borne Opinions on What Will Happen Next
Saturday.
Christopher A. Buckley returned to town
from Ravenswuod night before last and
will remain here until next week at least.
Mr. Buckley assured a Call reporter yes
terday that he was in the City on private
business and that he is still "out of poli
tics."
Buckley was quite willing to talk for
publication about the local situation and
the State Central Committee's concern
with it, but it was of course only as a Dem
ocrat at large, having no personal interest
in what is going on. As Mr. Buckley is
likely to gain complete control of the locul
party, what he was pleased to say in his
plenitude of discretion may be of interest.
"I am out of politics, as I have said be
fore, though many people seem loath to
believe it," began Mr. Buckley. "I am a
Democrat, willing to do an y thing I can for
the party, and am willing to give advice
to my friends when it is wanted. There is
a newspaper here that seems <tetermined
to force me into politics, apparently to get
a chance to vilify me. People look at me
and say, 'You're looking first rate,' but
really I am a sick man, and if 1 were to go
into politics I would not laat long.
"I have taken no particular interest in
what the State Central Committee may
do, have met none of the members, anil
am not well informed as to the probabili
ties. I don't propose to do anything with
the matter. In my opinion the State
Central Committee has no right to inter-
I fere in this situation. If it does do so it
! should act in the direction of effecting
some arrangement by which all members
of the party could go out and battle for
| supremacy. Let the majority rule. As a
j Democrat", I would be giad to see some
i thing done to blend all elements of the
party in this City.
"I think that if the State Central Com
mittee should enaeavor to usurp authority
and hand the party over to a small fac
tion, which would be given authority to
name delegates to the State convention
representing the entire party, the people
would repudiate such a thing. There
would be rebellion against any attempt to
take away the rights of the majority and
hand them over to the minority. The
State convention is the highest authority
in any party. The State Central Commit
tee is" but the executive committee of that
body. The State convention is a legisla
tive body and the judge of the qualifica
tions of "its memb?rs. If a minority fac
tinn were recognized as the regulai organ
ization by the State Central Committee
the majority would co right ahead as
though such a thing did not exist and the
State convention would judce which rep
resentatives of the people were rightfully
entitled to seats.
'The regular local organization, as it
utands, is in the hands of good men who
are ablÂ« to map out a platform and
nominate a ticket which will bring snecess
to the party. A few years ago we paid $1
in taxation, where now we pay $2 25, and
1 belie /c that the City government can be
run better than now within the dollar
limit. When the people pay taxes and
cease to pay royalty they can have good
government.
"But the party will come out all right.
There must be more or less strife in all i
parties. Joe Hamilton used to say : 'Boys, i
don't mind these orators who are vilify-!
me you. Why, there's no spirit in a Dem- j
ocratic convention without a fight.' Our j
party is made up of all elements, and the ;
firstprinciple of an Irishman is to hit a |
head when he sees it. But when the polls
are open they all go up and vote the Dem- |
ocratic ticket.
"Of course there are a lot of fellows in !
all parties who will get out and shout, '1 j
wouldn't do what that fellow does' â till;
they get a chance. There are now on deck
a lot of demagogue reformers who vilify'
men instead of attacking or advocating
principles.
"What the party needs here is organiza- j
tion. When it has prepared a platform
and nominated olticers ie needs some or
ganization to look to to see that pledges
and principles are carried out. That was
the way it used to be. Now there is no
organization â no power to look to. Offi
cials are amenable to nobody and they do
as they please and disregard pledges with
impunity.
"I am down here on private business
and I suppose some people will say that I
am trying to run the State Central Com
mittee, but J am not."
Gavin McNab talked, too, and again
about what the State Central Committee
would do about his party machine. He
said:
"The SUte Central Committee wants to
be assured that the organization it recog
nizes is Democratic and that it is not com
posed or brokers who wish to secure the
nomination of men to serve the purposes
of corporations ana of other men whose
throats they can cut. Buckley and Rainey
have been together in this business, and
they are equally obnoxious to the decent
element."
H. B. McAvoy is a member of the State
Central Committee, and has all along been
identified with the Junta. Recently he
has favored a compromise proposition in
stead of fighting lor the recognition of- fhe
Junta, and Gavin McNab has threatened
to "roast" him before the State Central
Committee. Mr. McAvoy said yesterday:
"I do not know whether I will introduce
any measure at the meeting or not. What
I believe in is a square deal, both in poli
tics and business. I believe that the in
terests of the party demand an open
primary that will give everybody a square
deal And let the majority of the people
fay who they want to represent them.
That's Democracy. I favor a primary
under the I'orter law, with inspectors ap
pointed by Registrar Hinton. I have seen
about twenty of the members of the State
Central Committee from out of town, and
while they are all opposed to Buckley, as
I am and always have been, they all seem
to favor some broad uroposition that will
unite the party and favor its success."
Said James H. O'Brien yesterday: "I be
lieve that the State Central Committee wil!
be fair and sensible and look at the ques
tion from the standpoint of justice, Demo
cratic principles and the good of the entire
party. It will do so if the meeting is not
a proxy meeting with Gavin McNab voting
the proxies."
Ills Buggy Wrecked.
John Geides, a bartender at 101 First street,
was driving alone Twenty-second street and
Treat avenue last night, when his horse bolted
and lie was thrown out. His left shoulder was
dislocated and the buggy was wrecked. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
English furniture is becoming fashiona

ROBERT P. PORTER HERE.
The Ex-Supervisor of the Cen
sus Going to Study Japan's
Labor.
EFFECT ON AMERICAN TRADE.
He Is Satisfied That McKinley Will
Be Nominated at the Convention
in St. Louis.
Robert P. Porter, ex-Supervising Inspec
tor of the United States Census and
formerly a member of the Tariff Commis
sion, is at the Palace. He is on his way to
Japan to study the labor question and the
effect of competition of Japanese goods on
the American market.
Mr. Porter was the founder of the New
York Press, which he conducted till about
a year ago, when he sold it and bought
the Cleveland World. This he yet owns.
Mr. Porter has traveled extensively in
Europe hitherto in the investigation of
economical questions. In 1882 he went
abroad for the New York Tribune, and prior
to that he had made investigations of his
own.
There is a resolution of Congress asking
Robert P. Porter, Proprietor of the Cleveland World, Who Is En Route to Japan
to Investigate the Labor Problem.
[Sketched from life by a "Call' artist.]
for a commission to go to Japan to investi
gate the labor problem, but the commission
has not yet been appointed. Mr. Porter's
investigation is personal and unconnected
with it. He proposes remaining in the
land of the chrysanthemum till the last of
May. He wants to get home in time for
the St. Louis convention.
Mr. Porter is a strong believer in the
ultimate nomination of William McKinley
for President. Ke says he has lately been
all through the New "England States and
in New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and
other States of the West. The feeling, he
Bays, is for McKinley first and last. He
thinks Tom Reed h*as no show, nor has
Cullom. As for Mr. All'son, he pays he is
a very good man. but, after all, the greatest j
thing he has done was to pass the inter
state commerce law, and he says every
body knows what that amounts to.
He predicts McKinley will get 400 votes
on the second ballot, and that then he will
win so much enthusiasm that there will be
a general break for him.
"A birdseye view of the Presidential out
look in New York." he said, "reveals a
lukewarm and apoplectic campaign for Mr.
Morton.
"In Pennsylvania Mr. Quay has Irmself
on his hands. He can't hold his own peo
ple from going for McKinley. He will get
the favorite son vote; that is, he will g?t ij
as a compliment the first time, and after I
that he will be nowhere.
"William Perm Nixon, who as editor of j
the Inter Ocean, the powerful newspaper
which has been putting forth^ Cullom's
claims, says it is conceded McKinley will
go into the convention at St. Louis with
more votes than any other man, adds:
'If McKinley is not nominated on the sec
ond ballot, then I shall regard Mr. Cul
lom's chance s as good as those of any
other candidate.'
"The fact is, all over the country Mr.
McKinley's great strength is being fust
conceded. He has been the central figure
in the last three great political campaigns,
and is now the legitimate and logical can
didate.
"It is admitted that the next President
will be iÂ» Republican. Mr. McKinley, as
the able exponent of the tariff, and as
always one of the truest and ablest Repub
licans, will undoubtedly, I believe, be the
man who will be nominated."
Mr. Porter says he doesn't know the
Pacitic Coast because he hasn't been here
long enough. In Southern California,
however, he found an enormous number of
Republicans who were for the Ohio states
man.
Mr. Porter is accompanied by his wife
and children. He will probabiy sail in
about a week.
ARRESTED FOR FORGERY.
Two Charges Preferred Against James
Lull of Berkeley.
James Lull, a man about 40 years of age,
was arrested on Powell street yesterday
afternoon by Detectives Gibson and Wren
and booked at the City Prison on two
charges of forgery.
When Lull's father, who was a wealthy
resident of Berkeley, died, he was left $7">00
to be paid to him in installments by $. B.
Patterson, the executor of the estate. He
overdrew the amount, and the executor
refused to honor any more of his checks.
To get money Lull resorted to forging
the name of S. B. Patterson to several
checks and cashed them in various places.
On February 18 " a forged check lor $45
drawn on the Central Bank, Oakland, was
cashed by S. R. Mount of the Russ House
bar, and on Tuesday night a forged check
for a similar amount was cashed by the
proprietor of Â«*.he Auditorium saloon on
Powell street. Both identified Lull as the
man for whom they cashed the checks,
The police say there are a number of
others.
OCTOPUS BOUND.
The Railroad Commission Meets as
Usual, but Its Hands Are Tied by
the Kail way Suit.
The Railroad Commission met yesterday
in this City, but owing to the illness of
Commissioner Stanton no business was
transacted.
A letter was received from George W.
Reed, attorney for the Oakland, San Le
andro and Haywards Electric Railway
Company, asking an extension of time lor
a reply in the case of the company,
charged with beiuj; accountable to the
commission since it carried freight and
passengers. The caÂ«e was postponed until
the next monthly meeting of the commis
sion. As the company discontinued car
rying freight on March 1, it is likely that
the complexion of the case has been
changed and the matter will be drooped.
The commission is waiting the result of
the Southern Pacific trial in the United
States courts, and, meanwhile, it receives
no recognition as formerly from the rail
way. Indeed none of the transportation
lines in California are paying any atten
tion to the commission, now that its
validity is under judicial consideration.
The Wong Sam Case.
Wong Sam was before United States Commis
sioner Ileacock yesterday in answer to the
charge of unlawfully landing Chinese women
at this port. As thedefense was not prepared
to go on with the ca^e it was continued until
Friday. Wong Sam wns the chief witness
against Interpreter Williams in a similar ex
amination. His life as a highbinder and bad
man geuerally is said to be prolific of transac-
tions that will brood discontent in the treas
ury service. Collector Wise is anxious to have
the case settled at once. He was present in
court yesterday and insisted that the case
should go on next Friday.
FAILURE TO PROVIDE.
Warrant Out for the Arrest of George
Li. Montserrat, an Actor.
Sarah Montserrat swore out a warrant
in Judge Low's court yesterday for the ar
rest of George L. Montserrat, her reputed
husband, on the charge of failure to pro
vide.
She stated that while in the East her
husband deserted her, and she met Mont
serrat, who is an actor. They came to
Sacramento together, where they have
lived as man and wife for over two years.
Two children have been born to them, the
youngest being only about a month old.
Shortly before the birth of her last child
she sued Montserrat for alimony, but she
lost her case, as they had not been legally
married. The case attracted public atten
tion in Sacramento, and Montserrat let
that city and came here. She followed him,
and learning that he had secured an en
gagement at the Alcazar, she yesterday
swore out the warrant for his arrest.
An image impressed upon the retina of
the eye remains there an appreciable time.
This is the reason why a torch swung rap
idly seems to be a circular flame.

FOOLING AWAY TIE,
Another Instance of the Danger of
Procrastination.
An Interesting Story With the
Bright Side-Lights of Truth
Thrown Vividly on It.
"PROCRASTINATION, OR "THE THIEF OF
-L time," as it is proverbially termed, certainly
works as much harm as any of the vices which are
more commonly called to public attention. The â 
man of an inquiring turn of mind Is conscious of
this, but the heedless may think "there Is nothing
much in It." It has caused hundreds of men to
fall to keep business appointments which might
readily have resulted in fortunes that have fallen
to the lot of others who have been more punctual,
and the men who keep criminal statistics say that
those unfortunates who appear to have "drifted"
into vicious habits unintentionally are almost all
of them victims of this pernicious habit. And
even nature verifies the truth of the assertion in a
marked way. If you have a cold and you neglect
it, it will not be surprising if it turns to congestion
of the lungs, in a mild manner at any rate. If you
have a bruised finger and do not keep the air from
it a fester may readily ensue, and so on. And
when we come to the more serious ailments â nerv-
ous diseases, for Instanceâ the danger of delay In
getting . proper help is at times appalling In Its
dreadful consequences to the procrastlnator. There
is. up in Trinity County, a gentleman who has a
very decided opinion on this point, for, to use a
colloquialism, "he has gone through the mill." It
is J. S. Bailey of Weavervllle, who was suffering
from a most severe attack of nervous trouble
when he applied to the great specialists at that
wonderful curative establishmentâ the Hudson
Medical Institute. Mr. Bailey's opinion on pro-
crastination is clearly expressed In the following
letter, which he has seen fit to write:
Weaverville, Cal., August 6, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute, San Francisco, Cal.
Gentlemen: I will now state that after two
months' treatment with yen I feel fully restored
to health ' and wish to express my gratitude to
you for your speedy aid. . I so wish to say that
any person who may "be suffering from any nerv-
ous disorders would be doing themselves actual In-
justice and harm not to consult the Hudson Medi-
cal Institute without delay. Yours in health, _
S. J. BAI LE Y.
That is short, crisp and true. Every one who
consults these wonderful physicians has the same
sort. of praise for them. Just listen:
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles writes: "I now feel
as though I was a cured and a well man."
Frank Minturn of St. Louis, Mo. : "I have not
felt so well in rive years as I do now."
E. W. Fowler of Kamele, Or., says : "I am feeling
as good now as Jt Is possible for a man to feel."
K. C. Taftof Stowe, Cal., writes: "I am feeling
fine, without a sign of a disease now."
Truly the amount of testimony of this nature
which is received at the great "Mecca for all
the sick" would surprise any one. Every mall
brings letters of thanks and appreciation, and It
is now unquestioned that for all curable diseases
nowhere is there so certain a chance for a rapid
and safe cure as at the grandest of disestablish-
ments of its nature on this continent.

REFORM ON TOP
Hale and Norcross Stock
Voted Against Mes
ser's Proxies.
AN EXCITING ELECTION.
Economy Will Be the Watch
word of the New Board
of Directors.
HOW THE FIGHT WAS WON.
New Officers in the Stock Exchange.
No More Assessmentsâ Smaller
Salaries.
Jere Lynch and reform won the day at
the general meeting of Hale it Norcross
yesterday. Me??er"s hosts were gathered
strong. They blocked the entire room
and they tried to block the entire reform
movement.
As the secretary read off each name at
the election yesterday the proxies all cried
"Messer"â and how many proxies there
really were. But stock is better than
proxies. It was stock that carried the day
for Lynch and reform. "When John Doe's
name was called and the proxy answered
"Messer" there was always some one to
call "stock" â "Lynch," at the same time.
Mr. Messer's attorney formally protested
ngainst stock being voted against proxies,
but even the Messer men laughed at the
objection, and the stock was counted.
It took more than two hours to com
plete the vote, but when the result was
announced the successful ones sent up a
rousing cheer that was heard down on the
street, and then the street knew that Jere
and reform had carried the day. The
word was quickly passed along and soon
the rejoicing was general.
JUJT here are 112,000 shares of stock in the
Hale A Norcrosa mine ana 107,000 of them
were voted, either by stock or proxy. The
vote stood: Messer 51. 1" 1 - 1 ; and Lynch 55,
--915%. The result in detail was as follows:
Shares.
For Lynch, Itoek 48,2785/ 8
For Lynch, proxies 7,637'
;; Total 55,91
â  .For Mpsser, stocK 11,113 6-8
For Messer, proxies 40,038 6-8
Total 51,162%
Only a casual glance at these figures will
tell the story of the lon* fight more plainly
than a column of explanation would make
them. Lynch's vote was largely stock.
M>sser's vote was largely proxies.
Two weeks atro Lynch had but 9027
shares to vote, while Messer had proxies
â  amounting to 50,903. The Lynch forces
must have done some hard work. Their
work was clean-cut and above-board, how
ever. They gathered in the actual stock
: and put no faith in proxies.
One of the peculiar things of the election
and the long fight that preceded it was the
action of Dr. M. A. Cachot of the old
â¢ board* He was elected on the reform
tickmjmd all sorts of reforms were prom
ised l|pr him and by him. Yesterday Dr.
Cachyt cast in his lot with the Messer
forces, and now people are wondering just
what kind of a reformer he really is or was.
As to the reforms of the new administra
tion, there appears to be no sort of uncer
tainty. Reform and economy are the
watchwords and the work has begun al
ready. The new president's salary is
$100. The old one received $125 a month.

the Hale & Norcross Company.

K. I*. Collins is the new secretary. His
salary will be $125 a month. His imme
diate predecessor, A. B. Thompson, was
paid $200 for the same amount of work.
Mr. Ta!i'_:erman will become the new
superintendent and foreman of the mine,
at a salary of $175 a month. Heretofore
there has been a superintendent at $2()0 a
month and a foreman at $175 a month.
Mr. Tan gey man's engagement is a hie
saving, but. it is only a starter. Inside of
a month the new board of directors expect
to effect a saving in operating expenses of
fully $l">00. There is also to be a consi'ier
ble "saving in office rent.
In a short time the old quarters in the
Nevada block, which cost $177 a month in
rental will be exchanged for new quarters
in the gtock Exchange at a rental ot f>u.
Heretofore rhp vice-president has received
a salary of *."*> a month. Hereafter the
vice-president will serve for nothing a
month. The new directors, who were
chosen immediately upon the result of the
vote being announced, are: President,
.'eremiah Lynch; A. Krause, Thomas Mc-
Donald, Arthur W. Moore, G. 0. hfneider,
Ed C, Barry and John L. Bradbury.
What is more pleasing to the stockhold
er? than anything else is the probability
that the new board will abide by its pledges
not only to reduce expenses a great deal,
but to do away with the assessments. No
more assessment* ! is the cry, and there
are some good, strong men behind the
Pledge.

THE OVERDUE RIO.
Xo News of the Absenteeâ Reinsurance
on the Vessel lH'gins to
Climb Up.
The Pacific Mail steamship Rio Janeiro
is out thirty-five days from this port bound
for Yokohama and no tidings have come in
from her. The steamship Empress of In
dia, which arrived at Victoria Tuesday
night, reported that February 29, when
one day out from Yokohama, she siehted
a steamer which was supposed to be the
Rio.
However, the Pacific Mail officials do
not believe the vessel seen by the India
wus the missing steamship, and they are
getting more anxious concerning the fate
of the big Pacific liner as the hours go by.
Still, her case cannot be considered hope
less, as several causes might keep her at
sea and prolong her passage even into a
danger length. A break in the machinery
would force Captain Russell to depend on
his small sail power alone, in which case
the clumsy Rio would creep over the
ocean for days unless found and towed in
by some more fortunate steamer. But it
must be considered that she would fare
badly shoiud the usual fierce Asiatic gale
catch her in that disabled condition.
General Agent Center of the Pacific Mail
Company refused to be interviewed regard
ing the overdue vessel, and cannot give
any information whatever. The first offer
for reinsurance on the Rio was made in
London yesterday morning, and 15 per
cent was paid in. The companies have
fought shy of risk so far, but now that a
start has been made it is thought that the
reinsurance will go up to 25 percent, and
even higiier, to-day.
The steamship China, which will sail for
the Orient Saturday, will follow in the
track of the Kio Janeiro and search care
fully for the derelict during the passage
across the Pacific. Tne City of Peking
sailed for Yokohama subsequent to the
Kio, but as she took the southern route it
is not probable that she will see or Dear of
her overdue s : ster till she reaches port.
She should reach Yokohama next Sunday.
THE DRIED FRUIT TRADE.
L. R. Wing, the Chicago Dealer,
on Its Condition in the
East.
Partial Failure of the Yield in France.
Disadvantages of the Position
of Growers.
"The growers of prunes in California
have had this year an opportunity for iho
introduction of their goodÃ in the Eastern
markets that would under ordinary cir
cumstances have cost them thousands of
dollars.
"The partial failure of the French crop
at a time when the market supply was
comparatively light has placed within their
reach the chance for the introduction of
California goods in certain quarters which
would ordinarily have been secured only
after years of repeated and persistent
effort on the part of growers and their
brokers who represent them."
This statement was made last night at
the Palace Hotel by Luman R. Wing of
Chicago, who has for a long time been
prominently identified with the Califor
nia dried-fruit trade in the East.
"Every advantage has been taken of this
opportunity, and the results are just what
were anticipated at the outset of last sea
son's business. California prunes have
come into the market to stay, and the
ground which French shippers have for
feited Dy force of circumstances may be re
carded as peraianently lost; at least, so
long as growers here continue to maintain
the standard whicn has characterized the
consignments of this season.
"Consumers are invariably conservative
and disinclined to change from long and
successfully tried markets, and though
constant and persevering work would have
gradually won for the products of this
State the position which they hold to-day,
it would have only been accomplished
inch by inch and after a siege of years.
"The outlook in the East at the present
time for dried fruits from California is, in
my estimation, most promising; and de
spite the constant report which comes
from this' section as to the loss which the
growers have suffered I feel confident that
if certain conditions relative to the pack
ing, grading and discrimination in ship
ments are observed the losses suffered in
the past will be well worth the experience
which has been gained.
"Of course, we hear in the East about
the general dissatisfaction among growers
here, and the reports of the repeated losses
which it is said they suffer year after year
can be directly traced to causes which can
certainly be remedied.
"A great deal of the harm from which
growers suffer lias been due to their fail
ure to discriminate in shipments. They
nave seemingly failed to realize that the
California dried-fruit trade for the past
few years has been passing through the
stages of its inception, and that the early
impressions formed by consumers have
been the only guide by which they have
been able to base future operations.
"Instead of using care in the making up
of their consignments and in forwarding a
class of goods representing a standard
which this State could easily maintain,
they have adhered to the old penny wise
and pound foolish policy and pent forward
to New York, Chicago and other Eastern
markets, in company with their best
{:oods, a big supply of low-grade material,
the returns for which would hardly defray
the cost of transportation.
"This stuff is, of course, sold. From the
wholesale men it goes into the hands of
the retailers and purchasers, who, in re
sponse to repeated solicitation to try Cali
fornia goods, get hold of it. Their first
experience is unsatisfactory and they in
vuriably form a prejudice which it takes
time to overcome.
"Another disadvantage from which ship
pers suffer is the disposition shown to
place their s;oods in ttie hands of irrespon
sible salesmen, who solicit consignments
by giving promises that under the most
favorable circumstances cannot be fulfilled.
"Absurd as it may seem there are large
numbers of consignors of dried fruits who
to-day are shipping their goods to green
fruit houses and to others who are not
identified with the trade, simply because
their representatives delude them by
promises of returns which reliable com
mission - houses cannot conscientiously
make.
"The results are always the same; the
grower suffers the loss which he has
brought on himself and the reputable com
mission trade is accused of participation in
a combine which has been organized pre I
sumably to swindle producers.
"There are enqUjrn reliable commission
houses to handle- all the goods grown in
this State, and growers can always secure
a guarantee of the character of their sales
by a comparison with current quotations."

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH IÂ« f 1896,
MR. HERRIN`S ARGUMENT
A Familiar Plea in Regard to
Fixing Railroad Freight
Schedules.
AGAINST ARBITRARY RATINGS.
Relying on the Granger Cases for a
Decision Favoring the Southern
Pacific.
Attorney Herrin monopolized nearly all
of yesterday's session of the United States
Circuit Court in presenting, from the
standpoint of the Southern Pacific, a
statement of the case of the Southern Pa
cific against the Railway Commission.
The light for an injunction restraining
the Railway Commission from ordering a
reduction in the transportation rates for
wheat is being kept up with great per
sistency. Proceedings commenced with
MR. HERRIN QUOTES DECISIONS IN FAVOR OF THE RAILROAD.
a petition on the part of ex-Judge Ilayne
requesting the admission in evidence of
certain affidavits and extracts from the
testimony given by C. P. Huntington be
fore the Senate committee, in order to
show that the cost of running a steamship
line between New York and New Orleans
was included in the operating expenses of
the Southern Pacific Company.
Judge McKer.na, after some argument
on both sides, decided to admit the docu
ments in evidence, but no other portions
of Huntington'9 testimony.
Mr. Herrin then commenced the open
ing argument for the company. He de
voted his attention to a consideration of
the law governing the powers of Legisla
tures and Railway Commissions to reduce
rates of transportation. He cited the
Granger case, decided in 1876, wherein a
principle was enunciated which was long
thought to imply that the bodies named
were endowed with unlimited powers in
the direction mentioned. Judge Brewer,
he said, was the first to attack this view
by holding that these powers were to be
reasonably used.
Mr. Herrin contended that the Legisla
ture had the right to order that reasonable
rates of transportation be established, but
had no authority to fix any arbitrary rate
it might choose. It was not easy to esti
mate the value of railway property, and
iience it was hard to fix upon a fair return
for funds invested in the road and its stock.
Aside from the actual value some re
gard, he claimed, should be had for the
sums of money invested in the road, even
though its value might have somewhat
depreciated, it was not fair to expect
that men of wealth should wish to see
their funds become unproductive. He
earnestly contended that those whpse
money had made the railways what they
are should be considered entitled to a fair
rate of interest on their investment.
The feature of this case, he said, was the
fart that there was no legislative provision
for bad years. The Legislature had fixed
a maximum rate, and if the losses of
the company in auy certain year
exceeded its profits the stockholders
would be forced to make up the deficit
from their own pockets without beinc al
lowed to reimburse themselves by tempo
rarily raising the rates. He cited a deci
sion of Justice Brewer in a similar case.
He asked whether schedules established
bj r railway companies might not be con
sidered prima facie reasonable in view of
the points cited in the Granger cases.
However, Justice Brewer's decision in the
Day case would seem to indicate that even
this power of the Legislature had
limitations. It had the right to
fix reasonable rates, but not
any rates reasonable or unreasonable.
The power is limited to the establishment
of reasonable rates. The minute any court
or legislative body transcends thispower
and passes beyond the limits of its legiti
mate exercise its act, he maintained,
would straightway become null and void
and absolute iy of no effect. This right on
the part of Legislatures and courts necessi
tates) a correlative right on the part of the
railways to be exempted from all danger
of being forced to eharse rates so low as to
be unjust to their stockholders.
Mr. Herrin cited a number of cases to
the effect that where rates of transporta
tion were so low as to preclude a railway
making legitimate profit, and prevent its
owners from obtaining a just and fair re
turn for fcbeir invested funds, the courts
should have the right to fix those rates at
a higher figure. There was no question
that the rates should be Inch enough to
enable the owners ot the road to pay for
proper service and meet the running ex
penses. Ordinarily speaking, he said,
courts should allow the directors of a rail
way a certain degree of discretion in the
matter of establishing rate schedules, and
as a ruie, should not interfere except in
cases of evident malfeasance. Courts could
not disregard the cost of a road in
estimating the reasonableness of its rate
charges. This invested capital seemed
to call for a lair return, even though the
present value of a road be less than the
amount expended in its construction. He
cited the case of the Central Pacific road,
which was built at a cost far in excess of
the amount paid for the construction of
any road subsequently put in operation,
since materials for the first-named road
had to be conveyed to places where they
were needed by means of expensive and
cumbrous modes of transportation,
whereas the materials for other roads
were conveyed across the continent over
the lines of the Central Pacific at a cost
which might be called insignificant in
comparison with that which the original
road had been obliged to sustain.
At this point in Mr. Ilerrin's argument
an adjournment was taken for the day.
LAVEAGA'S LEGACY.
Judge Coffey Has Allowed Him the
Full Amount.
Joseph Laveaga has been allowed the
entire amount of the $20,000 left him by
his uncle, Jose Vicente Laveaga. Joseph
Laveaga was the illegitimate son of Jose
Laveaga' s brother.
In his will Jose Laveaga left Eeveral be
quests, which he made chargeable upon
the sale of the Los Aguillas ranch. The
ranch realized only about 40 per cent of
what was expected, however, ana an at
tempt was made to cut down Rll the
legacies in proportion. Joseph Laveaga
demanded his $'20,000 legacy from the gen
eral funds of the estate, and after carefully
examining the will and the numerous
codicils attached Judge Coffey has allowed
this to be done.
Joseph Laveaga is fighting for one
quarter residue of the estate, the share his
father, if living, would take, but it is
claimed that an illegitimate son cannot be
heir to an uncle, even though he has been
acknowledged. This case is still pending.

LIGHT TRUST DELAYED.
Legal Obstacles to the Pooling of
the Electric and Gas
Companies.
THE PROMOTERS VERY SHY.
Edison Plant May Be Duplicated for
Half the Sum the Gas Com
pany Pays.
The news about the formation of a big
trust in light, published in yesterday's
Call, creatod widespread interest in the
City. Inquiries were at once made to
ascertain if the details of the consolidation
of the San Francisco Gas Company and
the Edison Light and Power corporation
had been adjusted.
The promoters of the lk big combine" had
another meeting yesterday afternoon. J.
B. Stetson, who represents the electric
company in the pending negotiations, was
seen yesterday, but positively yet kindly
declined to be interviewed.
"There is nothing to say at present,"
pleaded Mr. Stetson. "I do not want to
withhold information from The Call, and
as soon as- anything is settled I will cheer
fully tell you all about it. So far nothing
definite has been accomplished, and own-
era of stock are excited by the rumors
which have been published. r '
Mr. Stetson was asked to mention the
names of the gentlemen who were con
ducting tbe negotiations, but said he could
not do so in justice to his associates.
Mr. Stetson also declined to express any
opinion as to whether the object of the
trust was to acquire small electric plants
throughout the City and thus consolidate
all the light companies.
P. t B. Cornwall of the Mutual Electric
Company was seen at the Black Diamond
coal office. He said the company with
which he is associated was not a party to
the consolidation. What he knew of the
negotiations was derived from The Call.
Mr. Cornwall said: "I do not know of
any plan to form a trust. Electricity now
is about as free as air, as all the patents for
its use have expired."
"Do you apprehend a monopoly in the
business of supplying light?"
".Not as long as 1 am in the business,"
responded Mr. Cornwall, "and I am in the
business to stay."
The information comes from authentic
sources that the chief cause of delay in
concluding the terms of consolidation is
duo to the deliberation of attorneys in ex
amining the articles of union.
It also transpires that the overtures for
the pooling of interests come from the
Edison Light Company. The leading
stockholders of the gas company have not
exhibited special desire to consolidate.
A capitalist who is well informed on the
subject said to a Call reporter last night
that the gas company cotild duplicate the
electric plant for half "the money which it
is proposed to pay for the property of the
electric company. If the plunt were du
plicated the competing liglit company
would still be in the field.
Stockholders of the gas corporation
seem unable to understand why the Mu
tual Electric Company is not considered
as a dangerous competitor. From all that
can be ascertained no overtures have been
made to bring into the trust this com
pany, of which P. 15. Cornwall is the man
ager and Alviu/.a Hayward the chief
backer.
Tnere is also another gas company to be
considered in the future. Some time ago
the old Central Gaslight Company, now
the Pacilic Light Company, of which Al
bert Miller is president, pooled issues with
the San Francisco Gas Conipany fora term
; of seven years, the basis of agreement
being that four-sevenths of the combined
profits should go to the latter and three
sevenths to the Central.
The other gas company (the Central) has
a plant, mains and the full equipment for
conducting the business or supplying
light. Herein may Jie one of the obstacles
in the path of forming a new trust.
It is regarded as a foregone conclusion
that the negotiations to establish a trust
will be successfully carried out. Some few
days may elapse before announcement of
the fact is officially given to the stock
holders.
After advancing from 81} Â£ to 84VÂ£ Tues
day forenoon San Francisco Gas stock has
since fallen down to 81. There wore large
sales within that range. Yesterday some
stock sold as low as 80.

PROBING HIS
HEART'S MOTIVES
Pastor Brown Subjected to
a Rigid Cross-Exami
nation.
APPEARED ILL AT EASE.
His Attitude Toward Dr. Tenney
Was Defiant and Pleading
by Turns.
NEW WITNESSES INTRODUCED.
Mrs. Barton Makes Damaging Second-
Hand Statementsâ The Case Now
Practically Closed.
The ecclesiastical council has now in its
possession all that Dr. Brown can or will
offer in defense of his manhood and char
acter.
Yesterday in the interests of truth and
justice, unaer the cathode ray as adroitly
manipulated by Dr. Tenney, the accused
man was allowed to repeat the defense of
his alleged misconduct with Martha Over
man and the "Widow Stockton. There
were times when the pastor suffered a
complete lapse of memory, and then there
were occasions when he found it easy to
recall the minutest detail. These little
memory lapses, if such they might be
termed, niched nicely with the intent and
meaning of the questions asked by his
twenty judges.
Dr. Brown was apparently ill At ease
throughout the entire day. He was
haughty and suppliant by turns. Again
his face flushed in anger or paled in ex
citement according to his conception* of
the pertinency of the question. Once or
twice the reverend gentleman became de
cidedlj* combative and incidentally con
tradictory and confused in his answers.
On two occasions the witness gave vivid
exhibitions of personal antagonism to his
interlocutor. Nagle threw oil on the
troubled waters by assuring the excited
pastor that the questioner was forced to
get at the facts, and the only way this
could be done was by seeking information
on seemingly irrelevant, and sometimes
personal, matters.
Dr. Tenney continued his role of special
questioner for the council. He wore that
same cold, impenetrable yet inviting
smile, and not even the most caustic re
joinders of the witness sufficed to kill that
smile. His eye flashed a bit at times, or
assumed a merry twinkle, according to the
humor, but the smile never left his lips.
Next to Dr. Brown and his questi nc r
Dr. Pond was ttie moat noticeable figure
on the platform. This took form, how
ever, in his frequent objections to the
"harsh and cruel" questions asktd by his
fellow -judges.
At the evening session O. W. Bickford
and Mrs. Barton were introduced by the
prosecution. The latter told of the object
of Mrs. Tunnell's visit to Taconia as re
lated to her by Miss Overman's friend.
The witm--^ was not as clever in her dates
as she might have been, but in the main
she told her story in a perfectly straight
forward way. Attorney Nagle tanglt-d her
up considerably on these points, but did
not succeed in confusing her on the main
points at issue.
The case of the defense and prosecution
is now practically closed. It is rumored
that an effort will be made to produce the
Pullman porter in charge of the car on
which Dr. Brown and Miss Overman jour
neyed Tacomaward together. Dr. Ten
ney's question yesterday indicated that |
come startling evidence of this character
was being held in reserve, though mem
bers of the council decline to discuss the
matter at present.
Miss Overman will probably be placed
on the stand again to-day, after which Dr.
Brown's case will be submitted to the wis
dom of his ecclesiastical brethren.
The council will meet at 2 oclock this
afternoon.
BROWN ON THE RACK.
He Took Vigorous Exception to Mr.
Tenney's Soul -Probing
Questions.
The morning session yesterday was for
mally opened with prayer by Rev. W. C.
Pond. In the course of the prayer Mr.
Pond said :
Things puzzle us, and puzzling disturbs us.
and our hearts are burdened, "and there is
no one upon whom we can cast that burden
but thyself, and thou hast invited us to do to,
and we do so in thy name.
Those who know Mr. Pond to be a warm
friend of Dr. Brown during the whole
of these proceedings, and an enthusiastic
defender of the doctor before he (Pond)
was selected as a member of the council,
elbowed one another and exchanged sun
dry winks when Rev. Mr. Pond admitted
to the Almighty in his prayer that the
council was not altogether convinced of
the plausibility of the remarkably well
fitting storie^ of Dr. Brown and Miss
Overman.
The questions put by Dr. Tenner, who !
had been chosen by the council to conduct j
the cross-examination, afforded further
evidence that me council had flavored their
digestion of Miss Overman's story and
that of the doctor with several handfuls of
salt. Those questions were pointed and j
direct, and for the first time during; the
trial they evidenced the keen purpose of a
skilled attorney attempting to tear away
the cloak of falsehood from the bare truth.
Dr. Tenney is one of "the most courteous
of men and it was, no doubt, this inherent
quality which enabled him to bear gently
with the rude charge made more than once
by Dr. Brown in his answers that Dr. Ten
ncv was askine thoi-e disquieting questions
because he, Tenney, believed the doctor to
be guilty of the charges against him.
But Dr. Tenney appeared to have his
case well in hand, and wax not bluffed or I
bullied out of tiie line of action prescribed
to him hy his duty as a conscientious
eroai examiner, and attiioogb, being of a
refined and sensitive disposition, ue raim
have taken to heart the ungracious re
marks of Dr. Brown regarding the motives
lor the questions, Dr. Tenney did not
once show f c least sign of temper or ill
will. This was illustrated when at the
conclusion of the morning proceedings
Dr. Tenney hastened to assure Dr. Brown
that his questions had been prompted
Boielv by a sense of duty, and that the
harder and the more searching the ques
tions w<-re the more complete would be
Dr. Brown's vindication should he pass
througii the ordeal unscathed.
Dr. Brown grasped Dr. Tenney's hand
after this explanation and remarked, "Go
ahead, beloved; go ahead, beloved."
Dr. Brown appeared yesten'ay morning
with his throat bandaged. His voice had
Mrs. Hilda Barton, Who Gave Damaging Testimony Before the Council Last Night.
[Sketched by a '"Call" artist.}
regained much of its normal strength and
clearness, and although he was pale of
face and drawn aud haggard about his
eyes his usual aggressiveness seemed to
have lost none of its robust quality. â¢ It
seemed to have been aroused also more
than once during the examination by the
council's treatment of him in the legal
sense. For the first time since the be
ginning of the trial Dr. Brown was piaced
in the position of the prisoner at the bir
whose testimony was to be weighed very
carefully, because, like that of Miss Over
man, it miidit have been affected by the
intense personal interest of the two in the
result of the trial.
Dr. Brown explainer' at the outset that
after he and his friends had placed the
Davidson matter in the hands of the Police
Department they were subject to the ad
vice of Captain l^ees and Detective Sey
mour, who had been detailed to work up
the matter. After Mrs. Davidson iiad re
turned to her home after several days'
absence Captain Lees and Dr. Brown went
to see Lawyer Lloyd, who had been pre
viously retained by Deacon Morse as Dr.
Brown's attorney. Detective Sevmmir
paid, "Mr. Lloyd* the old bird has re
turned." Lloyd replied: "All riant, Mr.
Seymour; now you go ahead and do what
is to be done. You don't want â  1 rag
riega of trouble with this woman. Sey
mour will unbutton his coat and show his
star, and she will take the next train and
leave the City." Then Dr. Brown took a
hand in the conversation.
I said: "Wait a minute. I want that woman
prosecuted by due forms of law.' Then Mr.
Lloyd laid before me -yith great seriousness
what I must expect if I ever prosecuted a black
mailer in court. He said what Judge Campbell
afterward said in binding Mrs. Davidson to
answer oefore the Superior Court, that the
blackmailer usually had a perfect story made
up of little details. Mr. Lloyd said that my
name would be draped through all the news
papers of the City. I did anticipate that per
haps there would be two or three weeks of
trial and its accompanying newspaper notori
ety, and its sub.-idence. It whs distinctly
placed before my mind that I must expect to
â¢â¢ndure something such as I have bow en
dured, but I did not expect that I should have
to suffer as much as I have. It was pointed out
to us that if there was anything in our lives
that would not bear the scrutiny of the public
and the minutest investigation by the press we
should stop where we were.
From this point Dr. Brown switched off
to Dr. Alien and the Co-operative Society
and alleged that that society and its lead
ers were and had been making a bitter fieht
against him because he reported to Rev.
Mr. Burenell of Port Angeles that the
World's Christian Co-operative Society
was a ftaud. He alleged that because of
this report he had incurred the enmity of
President Wilderman, Mrs. Barton,
Messrs. Pierce. Bickford and others. Dr.
Brown thus described his visit to the com
pany's office:
After two or three days' search I found him
In the second Ktory ot a lodging-house on
Fourth or Fifth street. I didn't find him where
I was directed by Mr. Bun-hell's letter. I found
a saloon there. I found him in the second
story in a dingy, greasy room, ill lighted,
with dilapidated furniture and a center table
at which o tramp-like Individual sat writing.
I talked with him about an hour. Wilderman
said to me: "Dr. Brown, what is the purpose o:
this conversation?" I said then, fruukly,
â¢'Your society in Port Angeles has written to
me for my opinion of you." He said. "What is
your opinion?' and I said, "I can tell you bet
ter at the end of the hour."
i found 'hat the society of which Wilderinan
was president was receiving numerous initia
tion te'.'S from Port Angeles and other places,
and life membership lees of about #100, and
had absolutely no financial basis except some
wild land in Southern California, it was a
visionary, unsatisfactory, dreamy scheme to
get people' 3 money without giving anything
in exchange. I said to him: "if you want me
to tell you the truth frankly, I will say thai I
believe you have a scheme to get initiation
fees without giving anything for them."
He came to me afterward with a letter from
Mr. Burchell, and he sought to remove my un
favorable impressions. I told Wildermari that
1 would write to Mr. Burchell and tell him
what I thought, and Wilderman said that if I
did so he would have me arrested for slander.
I told him that he was mistaken in his rran if
he thoucht to scare me in that way. Dr.
Burchell came to me afterward and said that I
had saved him considerable money.
This President Wilderman swore on the pre
liminary examination of Mrs. Davidson mat
there was a Jane Elizabeth Baddin, when the
name on the certificate was I. E. Badden â
there was no Jane Elizabeth about it aIL
Those are the people who are against me; the
Bartons, the hickfords, the Wiidermans and
the Thurstonsâ they ure all connected with
that World's Christian Co-operative Society.
After Dr. Brown had finished his areu
ment on that point his attorney, Mr.
Nagle, asKeu him to state the date on
which he told Mrs. Brown about Ins hav
ing paid Mrs. Davidson tiie $500. He re
plied that he paid the money or. November
222 and told his wife about it on December
I!)â nearly a month later. Dr. Brown re
sumed :
The answer is very plain and reasonable.
During that month I was trying to ascertain
ns to whether Mrs. Baddm existed. I had been
told by Mrs. Davidson that Miss Overman was
ready to swear with Mrs. ttaddin and her
lodger that I was guilty. U that were the cn.se
any attempt to approach Miss Overman would
precipitate matters. I was afraid that if I toid
Mrs. Brown she would go immediately to Miss
Overman and precipitate a scandal. My every
impulse and ti.e habit of a lifetime made it
very difficult for me to keep this fact from my
wife. 1 informed Mrs. Brows very soon after
the Stockton kissing Incidentâ perhaps too
loisg afier, perhaps four or five weeks, it may
have been two weeks. It was just after Mrs.
Stockton had asked me to forgive iier for what
she hnd done. That happened two years ago
last November. 1 told my wife about it the
next Sunday after Mrs. Stockton had asked
my pardon.
i had a debate in my mind as to what I
should do about it- 1 knew that if I wtis to
continue in the ministry for twenty years
lontjer as I had been for twenty years before
it would be necessary for me in the course
of my duties to see ladies alone iii my study or
elsewhere. My wife has never had a suspicion
of me. effect would this story have up
on her mind.' 1 felt that it would torture her
and would interfere with her future bappi
ness and my future. I made up my mind at
last that it was my duty to tell her and I told
her that Mrs. Stockton nad asked my forgive
ness for what she had done.
For five or six months after that time Mrs.
Stockton conducted herself so well that she
won the confidence of some of the best mem
bers of the church, bhe waa not appointed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1890.
to teach the Sunday-school class at my sugges
tion. Mr. Rea appointed her. Mrs. Stockton
made so good an impression that Mrs. French
had come to sec something lovely in her and
invited her upon her programme to attend the
Turkish tea.
In response to further Questions by Mr.
Tenney the witness said that he had never
received more than two notes from Mrs.
Stockton. The first was the one inviting
him to her house to see her on the oc
casion of the hug and the kiss. That was
sent by her little girl. It was not in an
envelope, but folded ap and turned down
at the corner. "Not the little girl, but
the note," aaued Mr. Brown, with all the
facetiousness of robust health. The sec
ond note was that making a date with him
for 4 o'clock in the afternoon on the cor
ner of Batter Mid Montgomery streets.
He at once handed t!ie second note to his
wife. That was on the next day after he
had visited Mrs. French in relation to the
Turkish tea incident and two or three days
before Mrs. Cooper told him and his wife
a most damaging story about Mrs. Stock
ton. Dr. Brown proceeded to repeat it in
substance as follow*:
Mr-. Cooper detained us at 232 Putter street
on Monday, May 7. and told myself and Mrs.
Hrowu thai she desired t<> have a private IB*
tenriew with us. The conversation was one of
the most painful of my life. It began in a
way that was unosoaL lam nÂ«t In the habit
of being pledged to absolute secrecy by any
one, but Mrs. Cooper pledged us to solemn se
en, w She said: "Mrs. French come to me
yesterday in a perfect Ilame of fury, and raged
about Mrs. S-oekt'>n and tiie Turkish tea, and
I must tell you, my dear pastor and wife, that
lira, Stockton is a bad woman, and I have
known it a good while. It made me fairly
cringe to sen you and Mrs. Brown in ncr com
pany the other day. "
â¢Why," 1 said. "Mrs. Cooper, you introduced
me to that woman!" She said: 'Oh, Dr.
Brown, that much was due to formality. That
â¢n'.m.ui was brought to me by a wealthy man
Of this City â a subscriber to my kindergarten
fund. He waii ted bet educr.ted for kinder
garten work. I complied with his request.
Then he wanted me to give her employment,
and 1 laid thai I had no place for her. He
came to me twice on the matter, and upon my
still relusing he rose and Â«aid: 'Mrs. Cooper,
if yon have no place for Mrs. Stockton in your
kindergarten course you have no longer any
place for my support.' "
lira. Cooper sain: "Against my own judg
ment 1 employed Mrs. Stockton, and I kept her
until I could keep her no longer, because
srorles began to come to me about her, and I
said, 'Mr. Tevisâ ' "
Here Dr. Brown paused abruptly and
said, "Weil, I won't go on; having inad
vertently mentioned that name I will pro
ceed no further."
"Go on, doctor," advised Mr. Nagle
cheerily.
"I will not do it," replied the witness
positively. "1 will take the displeasure of
this council rather than do it. I will con
sider the matter more carefully before I
proceed, and until then I will take another
line."
Dr. Brown then proceeded to put in a
good word for Mr?. Stockton. He said:
I do want to say this before I goon, that I
have made such Investigation into the matter
that I don't believe some of the rumors that
Mrs. Cooper reported to us that day in the old
buiidin- of the Y. M. C. A. 1 don't believe that
any suspicion should attach to the paternity
of Mrs. StOCJCton'i oldest child, for the marriage
records abundantly cover that question" if
the rest of the rumor-, reported by Mrs. Cooper
are as ungrounded as that she e'ertafnlv slan
dered somebody thnt day.
From the bonrol that interview we never
had cdv peaceable relations with Mrs Stock
ton. A friend of mine has sent me from San
Jose, where Mrs. Stockton was married the
records of her marriage. That is since this
trial began. The statement of Mrs. Cooper
with regard to the oldest child, was certainly
and absolutely unfounded.
Mr. N.-igleâ And what was related of Mr
Tevis in connection with that was wrong
Now, after that explanation you can certainly
go on.
Dr. Brownâ Excuse me, I would rather not
It will be remembered by readers of Thk
Call that Mrs. Brown testified that Mrs
Cooper was the worst enemy that she and
Pr. Brown ever had, and it was evident to
those who heard Dr. Brown testify yester
day that he had got even with her by'
breaking the pledge of secrecy which 'he
and Mrs. Brown were alleged to have
made. When Mrs. Cooper was on the
stand a few days ago she positively denied
having told the Browns that Mrs. Stockton
was a bad woman.
Dr. Brown went on to say that it was ab
solutely false that he walked around the
square with Mrs. Davidson on a Saturday
night. He admitted that he walked
atoond the block conversing with her on a
Thursday night.
Dr. Tenney began his cross-examination
by Baking Dr. Brown as to when he be
came acquainted with Mrs. Tunnell. Dr.
Brown said that six months prior to Miss
Overman's visit to this City Mrs. Tunnel 1
introduced herself to him in the church as
a friend of Miss Overman, and asked the
doctor whether he knew where Miss Over
man was, and he told her that the young
woman was in Taeoma. On second thought
the doctor did not think it could have been
more than two months prior to Miss
Overman's visit here. Dr. Brown went on
as follows:
During my journey to the north, and per.
heps after we were in Tacoma, Miss Overman
reierred to her a^e.l friend, Mrs. Tunnel], ami
told me that a small income which she had
been receiving from relatives, or perhaps from
the rent of a house, had been either largely or
altogether cut off, and she wanted to know if
I would interest myself a little in her. Miss
Overman said that she had observed that it
trat my custom to heip people who needed
help, and i said thai I would be very happy to
do so. When 1 got back that came to my
mind that ihe a^ed lady might be somewhere
Jure suffering lor tbe necessaries of life, and I
called on her at Mrs. Eaton's when I had
round out her address. The conversation natur
ally was largely about Miss Overman, because
Mi.-.s Overman had requested me to call on
her. I don't think I stayed more ihau ten
minutes, although I might have remained
longer. 1 satisfied myself upon the point
which I wished to ascertain, and that was that
her physical condition and comfort were
cared for for the present.
The witness then told of a habit he had
had of walking around East Oakland and
other places to rest his brain. On one of
these occasions he found himself near Mrs.
Eaton's house, and he thought he wouid
run in and see Mn. Tunnel!, without the
slightest reference to Miss Overman. He
learned on that second visit that Mrs.
Tunnell was contemplating a journey
northward with Mrs. Ashby, who fur
nished the ticket, Miss Overman being
anxious that Mrs. Tunnell should come up
and make her a visit.
In explanation of his having written a
note to Mrs. Tunnell, as had been testified
to by Mrs. Eaton, Dr. Brown said that Mrs.
A3hby, who was living on this side of the
bay, wanted the doctor to do some errand
for her with Mrs. Tunnell, with reference
to their proposed trip to the north, and
the doctor may have written the note at
Mrs. Ashby's request. But for the life of
him he coulrt not remember what was in
it. The doctor then proceeded to the tÂ»omt
as follows:
I am absolutely sure that no such thing as
has been imputed to me with regard to her
northern journey existed. That woman never
went there to secure criminal results on Miss
Overman s person. I went to the steamer, not
to see Mrs. Tunnell off, but to say good-by to
Professor Joy of Taeoma, who had been visit
ing us at our home for a week. I never
told any of my parishioners thnt I had gone
to the steamer to see the captain. I had
gone to see the captain of the Monowai five
months before thÃt to help some poor person
to get to Australia.
After Mrs. Tunnell's return from the north I
met her on the street and shook hands with
her, but had no conversation with her with
regard to her visit to the north. On the Sun
day on which she disappeared there was some
talk with her about her visit to the north, but
I don't remember what it was. She never said
to me that I was under certain obligations to
Miss Overman and that I ought to be responsi
ble for her education. I did not advance any
money for her trip to the north.
The witness, in reply to questions,
said that he sent money to Mrs.
Tunnel] on one occasion through Mr. Pat
ton. He sent $10 or $15 through Miss
Overman. Patton told the witness that
he had come for the purpose of securing
some of Mrs. Tunneli's things, and he
was there for perhaps three - quarters
of an hour. He never mentioned that
Mrs. Tunnell was in bed.
"He didn't intimate to you," asked Mr.
Teiiney. "that she was getting desperate
and would tell the whole story?"
"That was absolutely and particularly
false," replied the doctor, with great
energy. "Mrs. Tunnell was Miss Over
man's friend, and Miss Overman could
have no peace of mind while sne knew
that her aged friend was down in tde
desert suffering, and that is why I sent her
the money."
He continued to tell the council that he
had made many attempts to secure Mrs.
Tnnnell's presence at the trial. She went
away under the gravest apprehension that
she would be dragged through the courts,
and from the fact that Miss Overman had
made Mrs. Tnnnell a confidant with refer
ence to her feelings toward the doctor.
This fact, he added, came to him after Mrs.
Tunnel! went away.
I said to Mr. Patton in the hallway: "Hand
that to Mrs. Tunnell for me."
By Dr. Tenneyâ Then he didn't tell you that
Mrs. Tunnell WM in noed of money.
You don't believe me, Dr. Tenney.
Dr. Brown made this remark with an
injured air, and before Dr. Tenney could
reply, Lawyer Nagle explained that Dr.
Tenney was obliged to ask Dr. Brown those
questions whether he believed Dr. Brown
or not.
Dr. Brown in reply to the next question,
said that the money was sent to Mrs. Tun
nell since the council met.
The witness said that his wife knew that
he was to occupy the same section in the
sleeping coach with Miss Overman on the
trip to Tacoraa before he started. As a
usual thing a man occupies the upper
berth, and in view of that fact, he and
Mrs. Brown had agreed that it would be
better for Dr. Brown 10 occupy the berth
above Miss Overman's, rather than that a
stranger should do so.
Mr. Tenney then put the following direct
questions :
After you retired was there anything hap
pened that compromised your character?
No, sir.
Or Miss Overman's character?
No, sir.
Or any other person's character!
I won t say.
Or any railway official's character?
I won t say. I don't say. I don't wish to
bring the names of other persons in here.
Or a railway porter's character?
. I won't say. * " .-
There was some particular event that hap
pened during those two nights of the trip to
Tacoma?
Yes. ' -vX;'.i-;-.-i r
Would it not be well to relate that?
I will not cast suspicion upon any one.
Dr. Tenney's next question caused the
audience to prick up their ears:
Did the porter or any other attendant come
to Miss Overman's berth in a way to startle her
during either of these two nighis?
I will not answer that question. You want
to compel me to say something; which in the
public mind might incriminate some one.
Dr. Tenneyâ l understand that there is an
attempt to secure evidence in this line.
Dr. Mooarâ Would it not be better to have Dr.
Brown rebut that if it is presented?
Here the matter was dropped, leaving
the audience mystified. Some of the skep
tical said after they had left the church
that it appeared to be an attempt by innu
endo to establish an alibi for Dr. Brown.
In other words that Mi.ss Overman was
alarmed by a stranger going to her berth,
and this would show that she was in her
own berth and that Dr. Brown was in his.
The witness never showed Miss Over
man's warm letter â the one which he re
buked her forâ to his wite because he did
not want to disturb Mrs. Brown's peace
of mind. Dr. Tenney proceeded on this
point:
Then there have been matters in your expe
rience in which you h ave not confided to your
wife?
1 don't think that is a fair question.
You said you didn't confide in your wife
about the Stockton kiss incident for some
weeks?
It seems to me that Brother Tenney's ques
tions ought not to have a (tins in them. I
would like to asi: if it necessarily involves a
rupiurc oi the confidence between me and my
viie it I threw n letter into the lire that "vould
C&UM her pain?
Dr. Tenneyâ No; because that would be
another evidence ul your confidence in her
and would strengthen her faith in you.
Moderator McLeanâ The object of those ques
tions is to show unusual concealments from
your wife. Those incidental concealments
would be significant in a married life of
nearly thirty years of unbroken confidence be
tween husband and wife.
Dr. Brown explained that Miss Over
man had been an inmate of his house for
months, and he thought that she would
recover from her affection for him, so he
did not think it was incumbent upon him
to disturb his wifs's peace of mind.
Dr. Tenneyâ Let me call your attention to
three times within a comparatively short
period you haii kept things from your wife.
There was the Stockton matter, this letter of
Miss Overman's and the payment of $500 to
Mrs. Davidson.
Dr. Brownâ But you Ignore the reasons,
doctor.
Dr. Tenneyâ l am simply calling your atten
tion to the fact. Your reasons may be good
ones. Did Miss Overman ever tell you or any
body else to your knowledge about her mar
ried experience?
Or. Brownâ Never.
You knew she was a divorced woman?
No, sir. I ink she told Mrs. Brown about
it in the latter part of her visit in 1894. â¢
Dr. Tenney went on to the Davidson '
plot. He asked:
Had you any reason at that time to believe â 
that Mrs. Davidson was not a true friend?
Not the least.
Why didn't you go to Miss Overmau and find |
out whether what Mrs. Davidson said about her
â¢ceasing you of crime was true?
Isecau.se my confidence was instantly shaken ,
when Mrs. Davidson told me in that awful in- â¢
terview that Miss Overman had entered into a
plot against me.
Do you mean to say that that statement !
swept away all your previous confidence in j
Miss Overman?
I didn't say that. I said that after what I '
hud heard from Mrs. Davidson I was in doubt ,
until I had found out that there was no Mr.-, i
Jiadoin. I believed Mrs. Davidson from the |
first.
If you had ascertained from Miss Overman
that she was not a party to the plot that would
have ended the matter?
Yes.
Had you not in your own mind a conviction
of MUs Overman's "rascality?
No. I saw that her staying away fromour
home after her return from Tacoma put a fear
and a suspicion in my mind that Mrs. David
son had told me the truth.
Do you con.sider yourself a very timid man
thai you did not care to go and see Miss Over
man about what Mrs. Davidson told you?
This question caused Dr. Brown to flare
up, and to exhibit to the council ami the
audience that he had the temper of a-Jay
man. â¢ "I don't want you to question my
G. W, BICKFORD, WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE "FOUND" THE TUNNELL LETTERS.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
record on that point," he said, aggressive
ly, "I fougtt for this country probably
before you were born."
After a few more questions Dr. Tenney
remarked: "I cannot but feel, Dr. Brown,
that your confidence in Miss Overman
was shaken by something that you have
nut given us a full explanation oi?"
Dr. Brown retortea quickly: "I don't
thinjc you ought to question the integrity
of your witnesses." Then he went on to
telÂ» that he did not consult Miss Overman
about the Davidson plot because he knew
her "hasty and mercurial disposition" and
feared to precipitate an explosion.
In answer to anotherquestion Dr. Brown
denied that he had paid any part of that
$500 to Mrs. Davidson with the under
standing that it was to go for Miss Over
man's schooling.
The witness became restive under the
searching questions of Dr. Tenney, and
he asked the council why they did not in
quire into the "nuble aspects" of tl c case.
Dr. Tenney. however, kept on inquiring
about the ignoble part of the Davidson plot
and prodded the witness with the question
as to why he had not refused to pay Mrs.
Davidson a dollar and why he had not de
tied her to do her worst. The witness
replied that tin* four women, or the three
women, would be too strong a combination
against him with their testimony in court.
"There was such a state of public opinion
that any minister of the Gospel would not
have dared to defy it."
The inexorable Tenney went on:
Has not your experience taught you that the
payment of money at such a time and under
such a pressure is always considered a tacit
assent to the truth of the chnrge?
No, sir; on the contrary, I have talked with
attorneys in this City, and they have many ex
amples" of innocent men having been
ostracized.
Dr. Trnneyâ While that may be trne, don't
you know that it always raises a question in
the minds o f many that there may be grounds
for the charge?
I don't reason it that way, bnt it may be so.
Dr. Tenneyâ Has not your study of morals
taught you "that the safest way is to do right,
thai happiness may follow?
Yes, in my reasoning moods. For once I was
thrown off my guard.
Should you not have said, "I spurn this
whole business; do your worst?"
I will reply that I was beside myself.
Why?
I have already told you why.
After repeating his reasons, which have
been published before, Dr. Brown pro
ceeded to explain that he wrote the notes
to Mrs. Davidson that were published in
the papers, because of the opposition to
him of Mrs. Mason and a minority of the
Young People's Society of Cnristian En
deavor. Mrs. Davidson was intimately
acquainted with Mrs. Mason, and he had
written the notes In ihe hope that healing
measures might be taken.
Here a recess was taken until 2 p. m.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Dr. Brown Undergoes a Searching
Cross-Examinationâ His Confi
dence In Miss Overman.
Jjr. Brown's further cross-examination
occupied nearly all of the afternoon ses
sion of the council. He was in excellent
spirits and voice throughout the three
hours he was being continually racked with
all kinds of questions.
In the course of his prayer opening the
afternoon session, Rev. Dr. Mooarsaid:
Give strength to all who have any testimony
to brin?, and prepare their mind and will so
that their testimony will be reliable and eiven
us so That we will receive only that which is
true and right.
Dr. Brown was a little dilatory in making
his appearance, and Mr. Nagle took ad
vantage of the period of waiting to ask the
council whether it was to be governed by
the Bible or the State law in the considera
tion to be given evidence. He explained
that the reason for his asking this question
was that he might be asked to close the
case and therefore wished to be prepared.
He admitted that be was not so good a
Bible student as the members of the coun
cil, while he was posted on the State law
governing such matters.
Moderator McLean responded by inform
ing the legal adviser of Dr. Brown before
the council that, the council had not given
the matter any thought, and then sug
gested to Mr. Nagle, in view of his con
fession, that he might devote some of his
time advantageously to the study of the
Bible. This raised a ripple of laughter at
the expense of the attorney.
Rev. Mr. Tenney opened fire on the wit
ness by asking him if the Overman letters
were not published on the 7th of January
of this year. To this Dr. Brown replied
that he could not remember the exact
date, but knew that they were published
sometime in January. The cross-exami
nation then proceeded as follows:
Your attention was called to them at once?
Yes, sir.
Did you read them thoroughly?
No, Kir.
How long a time elapsed bofore you read
them thoroughly?
i did not read them thoroughly until Febru
nry (>. The occasion of my reading them
through then was when I was in Mr. Nagle's
office and he was securing for me files of the
paper containing reports of the case.' He
brought in a copy of the Examiner containing
these letters, and I then read them through.
In the meantime had any steps been taken
by you toward having a committee appointed
before which you wished to make a statement?
I t hi nit so.
Do you recall when that occurred?
It was after the publication of tnose letters.
Was it not the first instance that you spokt
of the matter before the Bay Conference? Did
you not state to them that tney might be of
help to you in this matter and that you would
like to make a statement to them?" And did
you not say that a very brief explanation would
clear away the matter?
1 believe I did; but I find that I overesti
mated the worth of Christian fellowship.
Were steps taken to appoint tnat committee?
Yes, sir.
Did that committee have various meetings?
Yes, sir.
Did you come to one of those meetings ready
to make a statement?
Yes, sir.
How could you have been raady to clear up
that matter when you had not thoroughly read
the Overman letters at that time?
I must leave that entirely t<> Miss Overman.
Knowing my innocence, I was *roinsr to itate
that I knew nothnie: about those letters.
But you Knew what was in those letters?
I had glanced those letters through, but be
came heartily sick of them and did not read
them through carefully until February 6.
When did Miss Overman make a written
statement to you and Mrs. Brown in explana
tion of those letters?
It was two or three days after the appear
ance of the letters in the papers.
Did you feel satislied wiih that statement ?
I cunt say that I felt entirely satisfied
with it.
Without a full knowledge of those letters
and with that unsatisfactory explanation of
them you were ready to go before your
brethren and say you i-ould explain the whole
matter with a Jew sentences?
In explanation of my stand at that time I
wish to relate a certain* occurrence. On Feb
ruary 4 I received a letter signed by one
Samuel Weldshy. In that letter I was asked
to meet the writer at Fruiivale at 4 o'clock on
the sth, and that I would hear something to
my interest in reference to Mrs. Davidson. I
have karned in the progress of this unhappy
affair to trust nobody whom I did not kuow.
I immediately telephoned to Detective Sey
mour and learned that he was able to go v.ith
me. We took the 3 o'clock boat and reached
the Fruitvale station at 4 o'clock, in time to
keep the appointment. We got off the train at
different parts of it so as not to let It be known,
that Mr. Seymour was with me. I looked
around to make it apparent I was expecting
some one to meet me, and a lady of respect
able appearance came up and spoke to me.
She said she was tlr* mother of Samuel Weltis
ley. She said she had known Mrs. Davidson
for many years and that sde formerly resided
at Mulkilteo, Mich. I then told her that a:iy
statement that she might want to make to me ',
would have to be heMrd in the presence of Mr. |
Seymour. She agreed to this, and Mr. Seymour I
heard" every word that was spoken. Her story
was this:
She knew Mrs. Davidson for many years and
used to correspond with her. Her son had
been engaged us a collector for Mrs. Davidson,
and had in gambling lost $185 of Mrs. David
son's money at Portland, besides nearly every
thing of his own that he had with him at the
time and which had any value. Mrs. David
son demanded that this money be paid back to
her, and she had done everything to liquidate
the debt. Mrs. Davidson said she did not care
how long it took to pay her, and that sho did
not care to prosecute the young man, as she
had had similar trouble "of her own. Mrs.
Weldsiey said that after this she returned to
Michigan, and claimed that an agent came to
her and asked her to come to San Francisco
and swear that she was Mrs. Jane Elizabeth
Baddin. She said slie would rather throw her
seif into the bay. This ended our talk. Sub
sequently Mrs. Weldsiey suddenly disappeared,
and I le'ei now that the whole thing was a
swindle, and was unju.st and unfair to Mrs.
Davidson and Attorney Gallagher. I think it
was simply a scheme t<> get the $185 out of me.
I feit that in the light of other circumstances
this story would make clear to every one that
I was an innocent man.
You made two statements previous'to this to
the committee that you could clear ud this
matter in a few sentences?

Is there not a great temptation to Miss Over
man to save her reputation by making this
latest statement?
It does not save her reputation.
Does it not save her reputation for chastity?
Yes, but it does not save her reputation lor
honesty, which is equally important.
Co you know that a woman's reputation for
chastity is cherished above all things? j
Yes, I know that is so.
On the attention of the witness being
called to the fact that he maintained
cordial relations with Mrs. Davidson in
church matters despite the evident aver
sion of Mrs. Brown for her. Dr. Brown ex
plained that his wife's dislike was a mere
impression and he thought that Mrs.
Davidson would aid greatly in building up
the church.
: In response to questions by the same
interlocutor Dr. Brown stated that he was
now convinced that Mrs. Stockton had
deliberately set about to get him in her
power for* the purpose of blackmailing
him/and pave it as his further opinion
that she connived with Mrs. Davidson
toward this end. He denied in detail that
he had ever made any wrongful appoint
ments with her or that she had succeeded
in any way in successfully using her wiles
on him. Among other things he gave
with great elaboration the kissing scene
in Mrs. Stockton's room, asserting tbat
the entire act was played by Mrs. Stockton
alone. He further explained that she ,
afterward asked his forgiveness for this
act and that he gave it, believing on re- .
flection that she had acted under the in
fluence of her illness. and that the act was
not indicative of her being of immoral
propensities. It was owing to this view of
her conduct that he allowed her name to
be propounded in his church, he further
added. Rev. Mr. Tenney resnmed. his
cross-examination as follows:
It seems to me, doctor, that with your
knowledge of women, knowing that this" was
not a girl, it was somewhat strange to receive
the woman into the church at once on her
simple statement made to you?
I did not think there could be anything
wrong in a woman recommended by Sarah B.
Cooper.
Do you think a mature woman is us likely to
be tempted to do sucn a thing as a young girl ?
No, sir. But I feel compelled to state here
that I have knoivu of a similar instance, where
a woman, a member of a church, gave way to
such an impulse on a visit of her pastor. The
matter was investigated by a proper body, and
the result was that the woman and the pastor
came out of the affair without biame.it having
been decided that she acted simply from im
pulse and without any immoral purpose. I
believe that all of us are subject to these unac
countable impulses, but they do not indicate
that there is anything actual immoral in us.
Did you tell your wife about this kissing in
cident?
I told my wife a few weeks later. I ques
tioned at first whether it would be necessary
for me to tell mr wife what would trouble aud
disturb her peace of mind.
Under similar circumstances would you still
withhold such information from your wife?
No, sir; not after what I have experienced.
In the course of his examination Mr.
Tenney elicited the statement from Dr.
Brown that he had never been to a restau
rant with Mrs. Stockton and that he had
never been inside of the Maison Riche at
any time.
At this point the witness demurred to
this line of -questioning, alleging that the
council had already expressed itself as be
lieving chat he had not indulged in any
such doings as these questions would seem
to indicate. He was informed by the mod
erator that the council had >imply in
tended to put itself on record as not desir
ing to hear an}' more testimony tending to
Biiow that Dr. Brown had paraded the strteets
with disreputable women or had Jeen
seen going to or coming irora church Kith
any woman other than his wife. He Ifur
ther credited Dr. Brown with not being ob
tuse enough not to have fully understood
the purport of the council's action in that
matter.
Mrs. French and the Turkish tea again
bobbed up, and Dr. Brown stated that the
reason he nad interceded on behalf of Mrs.
Stockton in that affair was because Mrs.
French had the reputation of forming
hasty judgments, and he thought it possi
ble that.an injustice had been done Mrs.
Stockton. Mrs. French, he said, had
never given him any reason for not desir
ine Mrs. Stockton to take part in the tea,
but had simply said that slie had her rea
sons. He denied that he ha<* ever refused
Mrs. French the use of the church for that
affair, saying that he would never have
thought, of taking so autocratic a stand.
He admitted that the kissing incident oc
curred to him when Mrs. French refused
to allow Mrs. Stockton's name to remain
on the programme of the Turkish tea, buthat he believed that she had sincerely re
en ted.
Rev. Dr. Rader then took up the exami
iation:
What was the immediate cause of the publi
ation of the Stockton affair?
Through a statement made by Mrs. David
on. " ?
Did you ever pay a visit to the editors of the
ity papers in reference to the Stockton mat
er ?
Yes, sir, I did.
The witness then explained that he had
earned that Mrs. Davidson's statement,
riven to the papers after her arrest, con
ained a reference .to the Stockton inci
lent; that he had gone to the City editors
)f all the daily papers and that they had
ill agreed not to mention that matter
n Mrs. Davidson's statement on his
promising to procure an affidavit snow
ng that the matter was not based
)Â» facts, but on an attempt of Mrs.
Stockton to blackmail him. He then
; iatea that Mr. Garret, the City editor
)I the Examiner, a day later decided that
ie would publish it, as it was likely to be
published in the East and then be tele
graphed back here. All the papers were
lien released from their pledges and the
i.atter appeared in all of them on the
same day. In response to a question by
Or. Rader lie denied that he had ever paid
Mrs. Stockton $000 or any other sum of
money.
Deacon Williams aroused the ire of Dr.
Brown somewhat by asking him if he did
not say that for forty-eu-ht hours after the
irrest of Mrs. David"son he did not know
whether there was any foundation under
him. Mr. Williams followed this up by
asking him whether his faith in God and
the Savior had gone from him. The wit
ness admitted that for the time it had, and
quoted Job, who, the Bible says, had also
for a time lost faith in God, for his defense. I
The scene had quite a dramatic element to
it when Dr. Brown began to quote Scrip
ture in his best pulpit manner in justifica
tion of his discouraged feeling following
immediately after the arrest of the alleged
blackmailer.
Mr. McKee took a hand by asking Dr.
Brown if he still refused to pive the de
tails of the conversation with Mrs. Cooper
concerning Mrs. Stockton.
Dr. Brown made answer as follows:
I am willing to say that what my wife said
yesterday afternoon is substantially correct.
Mas. Cooper did *ay that it is believed that he
i- the lather of the oldest child of Mrs. Stock
ton. It was said that it was well understood
that ' She was a well-known man's mistress. I
don't believe it is true because Mrs. Cooper said
it. She said she had known Mrs. Stockton's
character before she introduced her to me.
Rev. Dr. Scudder brought up the matter
of Mrs. Tunnell's disappearance and Dr.
Brown'asserted that he had nothing at all
to do with the mattter.
Mr. Parkinson had a few pointed ques
tions to ask : .
Are you a Christian man?
I believe I am.
If you were to appear before the Great Judge
would you declare you had never committed
adultery with Mrs. Stockton ?
Yes, sir.
Or with Miss Overman ?
Yes, sir.
And that you never had any criminal rela
tions with either of these women?
- Yes, sir.
â¢ Mooarâ When Mrs. Stockton asked your for
giveness did you understand that "she was
conscious of moral wrong?
I believe she was.
Barkerâ Subsequent to the beginning of the
trial of Mrs. Davidson did you write a certain
letter to Judge Campbell?
That is not true.
â¢Tenney â Do you know how Mrs. Davidson
knew of the Stockton affair?
I know only by inference. Miss Overman
Rtates to me that Mrs. Stockton's name was
mentioned by Mrs. Davidson to her. I believe
that the two womenâ Mrs. Davidson and Mrs.
Stockton â were working in co-operation, and
that Mrs. Davidson broke with Mrs. Stockton
because she did not get what she thought was
her proper share of the $2500 obtained by
blackmail from a certain gentleman in this
Ciry, ana that was why she brought Mr.-.
Stockton into public notoriety in this affair.
A question by Dr. Racier started Dr.
Brown to telling of the attempt of a Mr.
Dowling to sell him the now-celebrated
Overman-Tunuell letters and of his refusal
to have anything to do with them.
He acknowledged, in response to a ques
tion by D^lioyt. that he had no idea that
he w.iÂ» ! in Â£-* his reputation when no had
Mrs. -D.-^ueon arrested, and added that
h<; had nil dreamed that his- reputation
would btÂ«,alled into question on the state
ment:- of such women as Mrs. Davidson
ami Mrs. Stockton. Dr. Brown then con
tinued:
Thines have occurred during the progress of
this trUl mat have made me believe otherwise
;ban that the council has acted justly and
fairly toward me. It seems to me that this
council has entertained evidence that I think
it ought not to have received.
Hoytâ Has it ever occurred to you, doctor,
tha; our suspicions of you have only been
can-ed by your apparent suspicions of us?
That may be so. It had not occurred to me in
that way.
Moderator McLean spoke of the letter
E ent by special delivery by Dr. Brown to
Mrs. Eaton after Mr?. Tunnell had gone
there, and Dr. Brown declared that
he could not remember having sent it. ad
mitting, however, that he thought Mrs.
Eaton spoke the truth when she said such
a letter came to her house. He then ex
plained that it was probably written at
the request of her sister, Mrs. Ashby.
This caused Dr. McLean to ask why Mrs.
Ashby should have burdened Dr. Brown,
a busy man, with writing a letter for her !
to hef sister, but Dr. Brown could not give
a satisfactory answer.
Moderator McLeanâ Overman's first ex
planation of those letters, you said, did not
EaUMy you?
No, sir.
Tiatwas the statement that Miss Overman
would have made to the investigating com
mittee? i
Yes. sir.
If it did not satisfy you, why aid you think it
would satisfy the committee?"
I did not think it would. I depended more
upon what I would say than upon her state
ment. .
That was the statement that would have
been given Mis. Cooper?
Yes, sir.
Judge Advocate Woodhams led the wit
ness to deny that he had ever called upon
Mrs. Davidson to take part in the prayer
meetings after he had paid her the $500,
and to state that she had twice after that
time taken part, but without his invita
tion.
He was asked by the same gentleman if
he had ever confessed to Mrs. Davidson
that he loved Miss Overman. The witness
emphatically stated that this was a lie on
the part of Mrs. Davidson, and that the
report of her preliminary trial, as pub
lished in The Call, would show that on
one day during her direct examination she
had made no less than forty-five distinct
false statements, and that on her cross
examination she had lied all the way
through. He refuted the statements that
he had ever promised to pay Miss Over
man $35 a month or that he had promised
to pay her way through college. He said !
that he remarked once in the presence of
bis wife that he wished he could afford to
pay for a university education for Miss
Overman, as she always showed such an
unusual love for books and knowledge.
Woodhamsâ Did you ever make any demand i
on Mrs. Davidson for the return of that â 
money?
1 have, both by letter and verbally. I have
a letter that 1 wrote her on that subject in my
satcnel.
The letter was produced and read. It
tras as follows:
' San Francisco, Dec. 23, 1895.
Mr*. Davidson: I' shall expect to see you
promptly at the stroke of noon in ray office.
X . â  C. O. Brown.
Dr. Brown explained that this note was
written afier he had a conversation with
Mrs. Davidson at her room on the subject
A her returning the money. The note, be
â aid, did not reach Mrs. Davidson until
he day after she left her room to avoid
he police, and that he regained 'possession
>f it through Mrs. Halliffan, the landlady
â¢ ' Mrs. Davidson, who found it among the
inopened correspondence oi her. tenant. ;;
He said, in answer to a question by Mr.
renney, that he thought the: scandal was
irecipitated by his refusal to make a loan
A $30' to Mrs.' Davidson after he had j
it previous times loaned her similar j
imnunts.
On the suggestion of Attorney Nagl? he j
inscribed a visit paid him by a woman
vho said her name was Mrs. Wilson, and
hat she lived at 654 Mission street, where
he kept a lodging-house. This woman
old -i story in the presence of the witness
,nd Miss Overman to the effect that she
had been approached by a man named
Miller, who intimated he had been sent by
Mr. Gallagher, and that she had been of
fered money if she would swear that Dr.
Brown had been seen in a compromising
position in her lodging-house. The wit
ness expressed the opinion that his visitor
simply came to him to jret him to raise
the alleged b ; d of the other side. Before
the woman left Dr. Brown forced her to
admit that she had never seen either him
or Miss Overman before the day of her
visit.
Mrs. Brown was put on the stand at the
request of Mr. Nagle and corrected her
testimony of Tuesday by saying that she
had misunderstood the question which
was asked her as to whether Dr. Brown
had told her of the Stockton kissing inci
dent. She said that she was deaf in the
left ear, and added that Dr. Brown had
told her of that matter shortly after it
occurred.
Tne re was some merry gossip and specu
lation by the audience as to whether Dr.
Brown whispered hi? confession into her
oeaf ear.
TWO STRANGE STORIES.
A Couple of Witnesses Cast Some
New Light Upon the Intricate
Case.
At t.e opening of the evening session
the Rev. Dr. Scudder led in prayer, after
which Dr. Brown was recalled to the stand.
In answer to a question by Dr. Tenney,
the pastor exhibited the fo flowing letter:
Dayton, Wash., March 6, 1896.
Dr. C. O. Btov.ii, i-an Francisco, Cal.â Dear Sir:
The following telegram received from fcan
Francisco Examiner this a. M.
Your brother has publicly announced that you
demanded money irom lÂ»r. Brown for Mrs. Tnn-
I nell. He says that you nift Mrs. Tinmen at Vl
salia? Will you piease telegraph the Examiner
your full story. \\ c will aliuw you space rates.
LIAMIXtR.
I most emphatically deny having told any
one I demanded money from you for Mrs. I
Tunnell or any one else. If anything I know
would be of interest to you before the ecclesi
astical court, please call on me lor affidavit.
Yours truly, M. H. Patton. Dayton, Wash.
The pastor said he had been very favor
ably impressed with Mr. Patlon. but
knew nothing of his antecedents. In an
swer to a question by Mr. Tenney, Dr. â 
Brown said he had received the* letter
after the council had adjourned for the
afternoon, and the envelope was stamped
"1:30 P. m. "
Dr. Brown was then excused from testi- !
fying further.
â¢l. \V. Bickford was the next witness.
He said he had been employed as a detec
tive, and had met Mrs. Tunnell at 132
Tenth street, and had read the originals of
the famous Overman-Tunneil letters. He
had come into possession of the letters i
through Mrs. Tunuell leaving with vim
some of her effects on the eve of her de
parture. Before she left she came to him
exclaiming, "My God! I have lost two im
portant letters !"
"I object," exclaimed Mr. Nagle, Dr.
Brown's attorney, rising in great excite
ment. -'This is mere hearsay testimony.
No representative of Dr. Brown was
present, and this is only second-hand evi
dence."
"1 move we proceed," remarked a mem
ber of the council.
Mr. Bickford proceeded. He said he ;
had sold the letters to tue Examiner for j
$50, and did not know where they were |
now. He had an impression, but did not !
know positively, that some one went to |
Dr. Brown with a proposition to sell him j
the letters. He had loaned the letters to '
an attorney, but with no ulterior motive, j
Tue Rev. Mr. Kader then questioned the !
witness. Mr. Bickford denied having sold
the letters, but admitted having received
: money for their publication. He could j
not say positively that any one had tried j
! to seli the letters "to Dr. Brown.
Mr. Parkinson then took the detective
lin hand. In answer to his inquiries Mr. j
Bickford stated that he found the letters ;
in a valise in a h've-gallon kerosene-oil i
can. The papers were lying loosely amm
a quantity of books and old shoes.
"Had yon any right to open the valise
or look* into the oil can?" asked Mr. j
Parkinson.
â â¢I opened the things because I thought |
if anything wrong was going on it ought 1 (
to come to liynt."
"But had yoM any right to open Mrs. â 
Tunnell's letters?" !
"I had a right like any one else to show j
tip anything wrong that was going on," j
answered Bickford.
"Yes,'" rejoined Mr. Parkinson in a very
caustic tone, "you thought there was
something in it for you, and as soon as
you found it out you sold the letters to the
paper. Isn't that it?"
"No, Ididn't," answered Bickford, hotly. â¢
"But you lost nothing by the transac- !
tiou," remarked Mr. Partinsun, with a j
sneer, which Dr. Brown answered.
Bickfoid then said he had been offered j
money by a morning paper to rind Mrs. 1
Baddin, but had failed.
Interrogated by Dr. Mooar, Bickford j
said he thought he had a riiht to open,
read and publish Mrs. Tunnell's letters.
"By what right,' asked Dr. Mooar.
"By the right of public morality," an
swered Bickford.
"And you consider yourself the custo
dian of the public morality, don't you?"
asked Dr. Mooar, in a winning tone, where
at a laugh arose.
Mr. Nagle then tooK the witness in hand j
and badgered the witness to his heart's j
content. Mr. Nagle involved the ex-detec
tive in a veritable labyrinth of compromis
ing questions, all intending to prove that
the witness was mixed in a deep, dark, and j
perhaps blackmailing conspiracy. Wher
ever the questions became too searching i
and personal he had one stereotyped j
answer, "I don't remember." He ac- I
knowleged that, although a detective, he
was a whitener and kalsominer between
times.
The witness admitted that in the middle j
of last .January he had twice visited Mr.
Dray at 1041 "Mission. Mr. Nagle then
asked him as to his business. He was then
questioned as to where and how he worked ; i
was he a boss or a journeyman, and about a |
I great many more things, until the mod
erator stopped the questions with the in
quiry as to how the evidence thus brought
out bore upon the case.
Mr. Nagie said it was for the council to j
decide. He did not know what was in the j
minds of the councilmen, and to this Dr. J
McLean, the moderator, said they did |
not know what was in Mr. Nagle's mind j
either. The crowd tittered and Mr. Nagle ;
dropped that particular line of examina- j
tion.
Mr. Nagie then asked if he rented the let- ;
ters to the Examiner and if he consider-d
it honorable to rent another man's prop- i
erty and receive an income from it. The;
witness was non-committal, and Mr. Na- I
gle saia, "That's all.'
Dr. Brown then asked leave to put a
I question, and he said:
"Did you ever hear Mrs. Tunnell swear
I upon any other occasion?"
'â Yes, sir. She said 'My God' more than
once."
This seemed to be all that Dr. Brown
wanted, and then Mr. Tenney asked ques- j
tions.
"Are you holding that money for Mrs. |
Tunnell?" he asked.
"I'll have a talt with her when she \
comes back," was the reply.
"Are you holding that money for Mrs. j
Tunnell?" Mr. Tenney repeated.
"I'll tell you when I have a talk with j
her."
*'I ask you again," persisted Mr. Ten- j
ney. "Are you holding that $o0 for Mrs. I i
Tunnell?"
"I decline to answer," replied the wit
ness.
Then Mr. Tenney continued:
â¢Why did you come here to-night?"
"I wanted to come."
"Did you speak to any one before you [
came?" I <
â¢'I spoke to Mrs. Cooper, at her house."
"Did she think it a good idea for you to .
come?"
"Yes; she thought so."
"That will do."
Mrs. Hilda Barton was called then. She j i
said she lived at 16 Graham place. She knew
Dr. Brown and had known Mrs. Tunnell ;
' for so'te time. She used to attend the ;
meetings of Allen's mission in Oakland
and seemed to know more about the Bible i
than any one else, and so she took notice i
of her. Then Mrs. Tunnell called on her. i
The witness knew Miss Overman also, for 1
she was introduced to her the day before | i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 12, 1896.
she went to Tacoma. She met Miss Over- ;
man at Mrs. Tunnell's house.
She used to see Dr. Brown at Allen's
meetings, too, and Mrs. Davidson.
Mrs. Tunnell had called upon her, and
when she complained of hard times Mrs.
Tunnell had told her to trust in God. She
said she had a house and lot in Gait, and
she said she would give them to the wit
ness, but the witness never got them. She
said then that when Mrs. Tunnell left she j
did not see her again, and when Mrs. Tun
nell came again she said she had been in
Tacoma. The witness asked how Mrs.
Tunnell had found the money, and Mrs.
Tunnell told her the fare had been paid
by Dr. Brown, and he had given her $10
spendine money besides.
Mrs. Tunnell "told her at the time that
she had seen Miss Overman in Tacoma,
and that Miss Overman was in a "scrape"
and that she was in love. The witness,
asked what the scrape was. and Mrs. Tun
nell would not tell her; all she could say
was, "Didn't I tell you that Mrs. Brown
was jealous of Dr. Brown?"
Then Mrs. Tunnell told her how she had
put $100 in a company and she cleared I
$100 in cash and said she had $100 more in j
the bank. She would not tell where she j
got the money. When she left she ap
geared to be going in the wrong direction.
She said in explanation that she was going
to see Mrs. Davidson ; that Mrs. Davidson
WU a friend of hers. Mrs Tunnell said ;
she was cominir back to see the witness, '
and that she would bring some letters with
her, but when she did come the witness !
would not let her in.
Then Mr. Tennev questioned the witness I
as to what Mrs. Tunnell had told her of
Miss Overman. The witness said again i
that Mrs. Tunnell had told her Mattie i
Overman was in a scrape and that she was
In love with some one, but the "some i
one's" name was not mentioned to her.
Mr. Nagle objected strenuously to the i
line of cross-examination, but his objec- j
tions were overruled.
When Mrs. Tunnel! left for Tacoma, the
witness continued under Mr. Tenney's
cross-examination, she was so poor and
shabby that the witness was seriously
thinking of asking the mission she be
longed to to help the woman, but when
Mrs. Tunnell returned from Tacoma she
was very well dressed and had plenty of
money.
More questions were asked as to the
money which Mrs. Tunnell had, but all of
these the witness answered satisfactorily.
Mrs. Tunneil had never told her where she
had obtained the money.
The witness proceeded to tell how Mat
tie Overman took Mrs. Tunnell's letters
and clothes, and what she left the witness
took and packed them in a satchel. Mrs.
Tunnell told the witness that Mattie was
going to college, and that Dr. Brown was
paying Matties expenses in the college.
Mrs. Tunnell, Misa Overman 'and Mrs.
Davidson slept at Mrs. Davidson's on the
night before Christmas cve â the evening
of the day on which Mrs. Tunnell said
that she had $100 in the bank. Mrs.
Tunnell sent for her to come to Mrs.
Davidson's that night, because Mrs. Tun
neil, as she said, and Mattie were in a
heap of trouble.
The witness reiterated that Mrs. Tun
nell offered her a house arid an acre of
land and a horse and cart at Gait, because
she wanted the witness to live with her
and a Mrs. Smith there. Before she went
away she told Mrs. Barton that besides
the $10u in bank she had about as mucii
in her coat. She did not tell the witness
that she got the money from Dr. Brown,
but that she got it from the sani" source
as that whence she received the $5 pieces.
On cross-examination by Mr. Parkinson
the witness stated that Mrs. Tunnell told
her that she (Mrs. Tunnell) had gone to
the Overman home in Tacoma for the pur
pose of taking care of Mattie Overman,
who "had cot into a scrape." '
"Was it such a scrape as a woman would
be likely to get into who had fallen in love
with a man?" asked Mr. Parkinson.
Mr. Williams asked whether Mrs. Tun
nell and the witness were not believers in
the second coming of Christ, and whether
it was not because of that belief that Mrs.
Tunnell wanted to make her a present of i
the house and let in Gait.
The witness replied that such was the '
fact; that they believed that the second i
coming of Christ wouid-take place in three
years.
Mr. Natrle on the cross-examination drew j
out of the witness the fact that Miss Over- I
man went bark to Tacoma twice â once in
July, 1894, and the next time in the fall.
"I think it was in the summertime,"
added the witness. "But I can hardly tell j
the difference between winter and summer
in Californiaâ they are so very much i
alike."
The witness Baid that she became ac- !
attainted with Mrs. Cooper four or five
days ago, and was introduced to Mrs.
Cooper by a man whose name she rather ;
tartly refused to divulge
Much merriment, was caused by the an- j
Bwen of the witness. She said that she
saw Dr. Brown in Dr. Allen's church on i
one occasion.
"When was that?" asked Mr. Nagle,
"When he was there" was the very posi
tive reply.
When asked as to what part of the:
church Dr. Brown was in when she saw I
him she said that she could not tell be- j
cause the seats were not numbered. Then, i
when the question was put as to whether !
there were any services in Dr. Allen's |
church last October she replied noâ "a j
preacher did run away with the money."
On the Sunday before Christmas eve,
â¢*the Sunday before she skipped out of '
town," Mrs. Tunnell knocked at her
door, but the witness refused to admit
her. because if she should admit Mrs. Tun
neli her husband would tear up or burn ;
the letters which Mrs. Tunnell wanted to
leave with her.
"How do you know that?" asked Mr. t
Nagle.
"Because." replied the witness with a !
smile, "my husband burns up my letters
and I did not want him to destroy any
body else's property."
In the course of the examination by Mr.
Nagie Mrs. Barton said that she had gone |
to Dr. Brown's house on Monday or Tues- j
day night, on which Mrs. Tunnell was in j
Dr. Brown's house. She did not go into '
the house, but waited outside for the pur- I
pose of seeing Mrs. Tunnell, who was |
wanted at a council of the Christian Co- !
operative Society. A boy went in i
through the door and she thought she saw j
Mrs. Tunnell inside. She could not swear j
positively that it was Mrs. Tunnell, be- I
cause the witness did not have her glasses ]
on, shejaeing very near-sighted.
The witness followed this up with the
Statement that the Co-operative Society
sent i-eyeral people to Dr. Brown's house
to inquire for Mrs. Tunnell, but they got;
no satisfaction. Mrs. Tunnell was an oiti- j
cer of the Society, and her presence was
deaired at a very important meeting. The
other officers thought that she would bet
ter be at the Cooperative Society's meet
ing than in Dr. Brown's house.
The witness also told about having seen j
Dr. Brown at the Hayes-street entrance to \
the park in company with Miss Overman !
one day.
Dr. Brown took the stand and said that
in the month of January he attended the !
Allen mission one night. At that time i
Miss Overman was in Tacoma. She left i
this City in December, 181)4,. and returned j
in August, 1895. He denied that he was ;
ever alone with Miss Overman in the park !
or any other place.
Dr. Brown denied Mrs. Barton's state- i
ment that Mrs. Tunnell was in Dr. Brown's I
house on a Monday night, because she left j
on Sunday night. He told also of a visit j
made to him by Charles Darling, who |
represented that a friend of his had in his j
possession several letters of a very damag- |
ing nature, of which it might be well for !
Dr. Brown to possess himself.
"That means that there is a price on j
them," suggested Dr. Brown to Darling
00 that occasion.
"That's about the size of it," was Dar
ling's remark.
Dr. Brown would have nothing to do
with the matter and the man went away, i
Wben the council had retired into se- I
cret session a Mrs. Friedlander came up
to Dr. Brown in an excited manner and j
asked to be allowed to appear before the
reverend body. Her wish was complied
with and she testified that for some months j
she had lived opposite Dr. Brown's church i
and had never seen him enter the' build
ing in company with any other woman |
than his wife. The council then adjourned I
until this afternoon.

engagement of the happy young couple;
was announced about three months ago, a ;
short while after Mi^sKreenebaum's return ;
from an extended European visit.
In addition to the high standing of the
contracting parties, the wedding last j
evening was all the more interesting on i
account of the delicious little romance con
nected with it.
It is the romance of a love at fi-rst sight, ;
strengthened and nurtured by congenial i

man.

gown ot cream white satin. The jupe, <
elegant in its rich simplicity, was cut en '

to the coiffure with a wreath of orange
blossoms completed the exquisite costume. !

WHAT CAUSES MISERY.
Jordan Says It Is the Degeneration
Resulting From Unearned
Happiness.
All attempts to secure happiness with
out doing something to deserve it ulti
mately result in misery, and misery is an
evidence of degeneration in the individual.
Such was Dr. David Starr Jordan's
theme in his lecture delivered last night in
the hall of the Academy of Sciences be
fore the Stanford Alumni Extension Club.
During his discourse he said:
A person is not really in a condition of
misery because ho is sick. Darwin, the great
est scientist of the century, was, during many
years of hio life, a sick man, and yet he was not
in misery.
Poverty may be a cause of misery, but not
necessarily so; sickness, but not necessarily
so. Instability of character, ignorance, fool
ishness, evil choice, evil environment, adher
ence to conventionality may lead to misery.
Misery is a personal element; a man is'mis
erable because of his degeneration, "l'oor
folks have poor ways," an expression of au old
iady in the Georgia mountains, explains the
existence of much of poverty and misery.
Happiness comes from accomplishing some
thing â from having done something to de
serve it. Jn all animals the process of receiv
ing impressions is essentially the same, and
sensation is received, communicated to the
brain and reflected back to the place re<tiv<<l.
The instinct of lower animals is the automatic
response to the brain reflection; the intellect
of man is the choice of a response. All our
knowledge comes from nerve contact in one
way and another with external things.
A man is degenerated to the degree that he
falls short of what he might have been. In
the long run there is no conflict between what
is be>t for the individual and what is best for
toe race.
Nineteen-twentieths of our thieves and mur-
derers are produced, not by heredity but by
corrosion, because conventionality leads them
to do evil.
The general effect of the stimulant is to de
stroy tho veracity of nerves. It is an attempt
to feel better when you have not done any
thing to feel better for. Perhaps the man who
would accomplish the best results would take
no stimulants whatever.
There are a good many people who try to
receive religious happiness by working them
selves into a series of sentimental thrills, or
by mingling among the enthusiasts, bat this
is not religion. There is no love that ends in
selfishness. .
'. When a student -comes to me, as students
have done;. full of remorse because he has been
on a drunk, I know that he will go off and do
it aeain, for remorse in itself is not a cure.
The great effectiveness of the work of the Sal
vation Army, I think, lies not in their relying
upon the feeling of remorse for wrong, but in
interesting the individual and getting him 10
work doing something-. -
The general end of the double life is that
the lower life will predominate. The best way
is to hold aloof from the lower tendencies
altogether. â  â¢. .
Any condition of life based on being good on
Sunday and bad on Monday is destructive to
the community.
What people generally are talking about in a
city is a pretty good index to the character of
the population, In Havana, Cuba, when I was
there once, the prevalent conversation was
gambling, and the great hero of the place was
the barber, wno hud just won the big prize
with a lottery ticket.
All attempts to secure tho rewards of skill
without having used the skill end in disaster.
The most disagreeable thing that toe chil
dren of San Francisco are subjected to is the
language of suggestion of the bulletin boards.
All these things and the trials that are held
and reported through this City's newspapers
are fatal to love, fatal to life*
The so-called sowing of wild oats results in
injury to the spinal column. When wild oats
grow luxuriantly no other crops can grow.
It is said of Starr King that he did not like
the rotten side of things:
This class of literature that is called realism
is not real, is not true to lite at all. It ought
to be banished . from every decent man's
library. - ' : â  â  â  â â â¢â â¢â . .â : -'*: .-.â  â â¢
AN OPINION MODIFIED.
i Judges Must Be Careful About
Instructing Juries to
Acquit.
â
The Practice Is Dangerous, and to
x Be Invoked Only in the
Clearest Cases.
The Supreme Court has rather modified
; the terms of the opinion in the Knuth
i case by a decision filed in the case of An
i drew J. O'Connor against O. S. Witherby,
I filed yesterday.
In the Knuth case the court said that
whenever, in the opinion of the trial Judge,
I the evidence given to the jury was not suf
ficient to justify the verdict rendered, he
; could, in the exercise of his discretion, set
j the verdict aside.
The decision caused some commen
: among the lawyers of the City, and it was
I generally considered a dangerous theory
i to go by;
In the case just mentioned this theory
|is much modified. A. EL Witherby was
j sued by Andrew J. O'Connor for the
| amount of an assessment on 100 shares of
j stock which he was supposed to hold in
I the Consolidated National Bank. With
t erby contended that be did not own the
j stock. The case was tried before a jury,
I the caÂ«e was submitted and then the
j plaintiff moved that the court instruct the
jury to iind for the plaintiff and the in
struction was granted and the jury
! brought in its verdict accordingly. The
j defenaant appealed and one of the points
made was that the court had no authority
Ito instruct to acquit. The Supreme
j Court sustained the ruling of the lower
: court, and la answering the point made as
to the instruction says:
We do not think that the judgment should
I be reversed because the court instructed the
I jury to find for the plaintiff. Ot course such
' an instruction could not be upheld when there
i was conflicting evidence as to the material
I facts which the jury had a right to pass on,
; but when there is no substantial conflict of
j evidence as to the facts determinative of the
| case, or sueli tacts are adraitU'd, theu the judg
| ment will not be reversed for such an instruc
tion, although the practice is hazardous and
j can be sanctioned only in the clearest cases.
The opinion was written by Justice Me-
Farland. Justices Temple and Henshaw
concurring.
The statistical returns of the various
Methodist bodies give 25,000.000 as the
total membership throughout the world. I

NEW YORK. N. V.. March 11.âWhen it is
said that American tobbaco figured for 230,800
shares out of a grand total of 342,500 shares for
the entire list It about explains the market at the
Stock Exchange to-day. Tobacco opened at 75%,
rose to 828.4, receded to 733/g and then recovered
to -'a 79. All sorts of rumors were afloat to
account for the sensational movements in the
stock and the enormous dealings. It was said that
a movement was on foot to settle the existing dif
ferences with its Western competitors, and that
the company intended to resume dividends on the
common at an early day. Both of these stories
met with semi-official denials, and later in the day
the street finally settled down to the opinion that
the recent wide fluctuations were due to manipu
lation by people alleged to have inside connec
tions.
The rumor was to the effect that a Southern
director or the company, finding the stocK heavily
oversold, inaugurated a campaign against the
Deal â  and bad completed a big Washington inter
est to rover. The tact that a well-known Wash
ington firm was given up as a buyer of 30.000
shares lent color to this theory. In the afternoon
trading the excitement in this specialty abated,
and traders paid more attention to General Elec

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 11.â Wheat prices In
clined downward to-day, the prime cause for
which was found In the Government's report of
yesterday, etving the amount of wheat still in the
farmers' hands at 123,000,000 bushels. Liverpool
cables came out with a decline of 3 farthings, and
explained the loss as being due to the United
States Agricultural Department's report. Prices
', at t he start were Â»,ic under the close of yesterday,
â¢ and later additional fractional depreciation took
place. Holders of "puts," and buying against
i previous short sales by the general trade, sup
ported the market most of the session. There was
scattered "long" sellin g and occasional raids by
I professionals, but the volume of business was not
excessively heavy-
Receipts at Chicago were 73 cars and 209,596
bushels were taken from store. Northwestern
i arrivals were 321 cars, against 434 last Wednes
day and 228 a year ai;o. Closing continental cables
v.-ere irregular Export clearances were light at
191,491 bushels. In the las , half hour a complete
recovery took place, reports of sales of wheat for
export at New York inducing "shorts" to cover
ami prompting some buying for "Ion*;" account.
; May wheat opened from 6414 cto 64V'gC, advanced
to 65VsC, closing at 64y B @6sc, unchanged from
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 75
cars.
CORNâ The Government report on corn had lit
tle bearing on the price of that grain, although me
farm reserve as indicated officially, 1,07-. 000. 000
bushels, was generally acknowledged to be correct
in the main. The trade in this grain of late has
kept the enormous supplies constantly in mind, so
that prices have ruled low in consequence, and
therefore no justification of an extraordinary break
was to be found in the confirmation by the Govern
ment of what was already known. Receipts were
264 cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
Liverpool cables were easier, and Vid lower. Ex
port clearances were 315,948 bushels. May corn
opened at 30c, advanced to and closed at 301./4 C,
unchanged from yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 301 cars.
OATSâ Were steady. There was no news of
direct interest, 'and business was of an unimuort
ant kind. Receipts were 161 cars. There were no
withdrawals from store. May oats closed a shade
under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-mor
row 585 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 89@89VaC; May,
901/ic; July, 91c bid. Receipts 11 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The hog market this morning
'was exactly the reverse of yesterday, large re
ceipts and lower prices being reported. Product
as in duty bound opened weak and declined on the
information. May pork closed 10c under yester
day. May lard a shade lower, and May ribs 2 yÂ«c to
&c lower.

HIDES. TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
HIDES AND SKINS- circular of W. B.
Sunnier A Co. says: "Our Hide and Leather mar
ket continues very quiet and prices remain about
the same. Values, however, are somewhat weaker,
and the general outlook is not particularly encour
aging, r. Wet salted â  Hides remain about the game,
but tanners are rather careful in buying and insist
on a close selection. Less than the usual quanti
ties of wet salted Hides are being received at pres
ent. The dry Hide market remains about the
same. Prices on dry Hides are based on values
obtainable ; in New York and Boston, and quite a
quantity of California dry Hides are now on hand
in the Eastern markets, the price obtainable there
being about 14c. Dry Kips are very dull and rule
at 2 or 3c %i ib less than dry Hides. Wool and
sheep skins rule at low figures, and pullers are not
Inclined to buy unless Sheepskins can be bought at
lower figures than before. Tallow is very quiet
and rules at very low figures. The Deerskin trade
continues nominal. The only, skins which . are
being bandied now are those â  from the adjoining
States and foreign countries. Very good lines of
Deerskins can be bought In the East and at such
low figures that it virtually pays a tanner to im
port rather than to buy in this market. The future
prospect of the Hide and Leather market does not
appear to be encouraging, and it is very doubtful
if any advance in values can be made for some
little tlme."||Heavy sailed steers quotable at 7c:

PASSED BY TEE FATAL CAR.
Thousands of Women and Children
f
Weep Over the Two Prttty
White Coffins.
Oakland Office Sax .Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, March 11. j
West Oakland has never before seen
such an object lesson demonstrating: the
immediate need of adequate car guards as
was witnessed this afternoon.
in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Frank E.
Booth were two little white coffins, each
reposing in a bed of flowers sent by sym
pathetic friends and neighbors. In either
coffin was one of the two only daughters
of the Booths. The work of the cruel car
. wheels was visible on the little, angelic
faces, and as the immense throne passed
through the parlors hardly a dry eye could
-be seen leaving the solemn spectacle.
There were innumerable floral crosses,
crowns, pillows, baskets and bouquets. A
large piece representing the gates ajar
was set above the others. Scores of little
tots with whom the deceased children had
played brought their floral tributes of a
lew roses or early pinks and laid them
against the coffins, with tear-stained faces.
The house was rilled with sympathetic
friends, while the yard and street were
lined with those who could not gain an
entrance. At the curb stood two white
hearses, each with a team of white horses, j
and those whose, bouquets could not be
taken into the house deposited them on
the hearses.
As the little caskets were carried out of
the home that had been so fearfully de
vastated, hundreds of the onlookers burst
into tears. A short funeral service was
conducted by Rev. F. J. Mynard of St.
John's Episcopal Church. A hymn sung
by friends, a brief prayer and a few words
of comfort to the bereaved parents and of
exhortation to the visitors concluded the
ceremonies.
During the service the death-dealing
car, No. 12, that had stricken down the two
little girls passed the house of mourning
twice. The idea was freely expressed that
the superintendent of the line might have
ordered a suspension of the cars for the
few minutes that were occupied with the
services.
The pall-bearers for Ida Emily, aged 6,
were J. P. Heller, b. C. Hawer* H. Clark
and Captain Matthews. Katie Anna's j
white coffin was carried out by Paul
Dorey, Judah Newman, Simon Matthews
and Jay Dewing. These gentlemen are all
business associates of Mr. Booth. The in
terment was at Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
HIS STATEMENT DENIED.
The Car Must Have Been Going More
Thau Four Miles an Hour.
The statement of Motorman John Mc-
Lean that the car when it killed the little
girls was only going four miles an hour is
disc.edited by many practical motormen.
In McLean's signed statement is the fol- I
lowing paragraph: "It is our custom to
run about eight miles an hour. Going at
that speed I calculate that I canaoply the
brakes rind come to a standstill in about
sixty i/jt't. Using the reverse current with
the urines I can scop my car in half the
distanci\ My time-table gives me thirty
seven and a half minutes to make the
round trip from Thirteenth and Franklin
streets to Seventh and Pine streets. Last
night on the 6 o'clock trip, when the acci
dent occurred, we were running easy and
were on time. As we crossed Adeline
street we were running at half-speed, or
four miles an hour."
It is said by all experienced in such mat
ters that a car going at only four miles an !
hour could be stopped almost instantly by
reversing the current. McLean says he
stopped within fifteen feet and yet one of
the girls was under the rear trucks, which
â¢ is about twenty-seven feet from the front
of the car, when it was broughc to a
standstill. These matters will be fully in
vestigated at the inquest to-morrow night.
"There is a mistaken idea abroad that"
our cars have no fenders," said Superin- j
tendent A. K. Grim of the OaKland Con
solidated electric road to-day. "The ordi
nance passed by the Council has been ac
cepted by every road in the city and fen
ders were placed on the cars at once. Each
one has the right to use the fender they
believe to be the best. No guatd or fender
baa yet been invented that will pick peo
ple up and carry them from harm if they
walk or fall in front of a moving car.
There are hundreds of devices, but they
all fail when the test comes.
"Just at present many say the Clark
guard used on the Alameda line is perfect.
It. is not, however. It may save a life once
in a while ; so will the fenders on our cars !
or those of any other line. We have a!
board in front of the truck, some straight .
across and others in V shape. If a person j
is seen in time for the speed of the car to i
be reduced it should roll them out of the '
way and keep them from going under the \
trucks, but it does not always do it, nor j
will any other device yet invented. If the '
Council asks us to use a certain guard we '
will do it, but there is no reason lor chang- i
ing as long as we have one as good as any
in use until one is officially accepted by
the Council."
AS OPIUM COOKERY.
Capture of Two Chiiianiou and Their
Outfit.
OAKLAND, Cat,., March 11.â The rev
enue officers have been satisfied for some
time past that there has been an illicit re
finery of crude opium situated somewhere
in the vicinity of Fruitvale. The arrests ;
of numerous Chinamen by Deputy Sheriff j
Quintan with unstamped opium in their i
possession has oniy confirmed these sus- j
picions. All efforts to locate the plant, i
however, has failed.
When word was sent to the Sheriffs I
office yesterday that Chinamen 'had been j
seen at "j Bay barm Island who evidently
v.-ere engaged in cooking opium it was be
-1 eyed the plant had at last been located.
The revenue officers were notified, and last
evening William Craven, a deputy col- i
lector of revenue, went to the scene of
operations. He overhauled two Chinamen
on the bridge Leading to Lay Farm Island,
who had a quantity of unstamped opium '
with them and some appliances for cook
ing the crude opuini. They were taken
ii.to custody and the outfit: and opium
seized! _
The prisoners were taken to the County
. ail, wiitr.' they were booked shortly before
2 o'clock this morning as Charlie Mo â â â 
and Wong I bin* Wa. They were unpre
' possessing specimens of the lower caste
linen, and one hud lout his queue, in :
ii tating to the officers that be was an ex
cunvict. A thorough search of the island
is being made to nnd, if possible, where
the plant is located.

The Wedflins of Weil-Known Young
Society PÂ«oplÂ«.
OAKLAND, "CaI., March 11.â The nup
tials of Miss Louisa C. Bromweli and
Shelby F. Martin this evening, at the resi
dence of tne v bride's parents, was the
society event of the week. The home was
a veritable fairy bower, the predominating
colors t â .<.'.'. pink and white, although
buiilax, palms and other choice flowers
were used in abundance. Rev. Robert
Kitchie officiated at the ceremony, which
took pkue in the library bay-window
under a floral wedding bell of pink and
white flowers.
The bride was attended by her two
cousins as maids of honor, Miss Lou Wil
liams of Scranton, I'enn., and Miss Ger
trude Allen, who were in costumes of white
tulle. The bridesmaid, Miss Clara Con
verse, another cousin, was attired in pink
and white.
The groom was attended by Thomas Ar
neal. Following the ceremony an
elaborate banquet was served in the dining
room, which was decorated with pink and
white. A striking feature in this room
were three Moral weddiny-bells suspended
over the table.
The bride is the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. L. Bromwell of Ninth and Madi
son streets, ami has been a favorite in local
social circles. Ttie groom is the son of ex-
Mayor J. West Martin, president of the
Union Savings Bank, in which institution
he occupies a responsible position.
FIVK MILLION DOLLARS.
Said to Be Behind the Recently Organ
ized Alaskan Venture.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 11.â While all
those in authority in the Alaskan expedi
tion that left last night still retain secrecy
regarding their plans and movements it
has been learned on what appears to be
reliable authority . that the company is
formed with a capital stock of $5,000,000,
and it is asserted that, of this amount two
thirds is paid up and half of the cash is in
the OaKiand and San Francisco banks.
Among the men on the steamer are com
petent miners, blacksmiths, carpenters,
laborers and executive staff. The steamer
goes equipped with ten giant i ydraulic
nozzles and 10,000 feet of piping. Over fifty
tons of provisions and blankets are on
board. At Tacoma a quarter of a million
feet of lumber will be taken on to be used
in constructing sluices and the necessary
buildings. Forty horses form an import
ant part of the" cargo. These are. safely
encased in "sea stalls" on the upper deck.
When the lumber is taken on, however, it
is expected the animals will have to be
moved below.
The cargo is estimated to be worth $75,
--000, all of which has been purchased of
Oakland and Ban Francisco firms. It is
said the salary and expenses will run up
to $7500 a montn.
The Colored Vote.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 11.â The Ala
meda County Afro-American League, after
a spirited meeting last night, decided to
recommend to the County Central Com
mittee the desirability of j olding a pri
mary election, believing this plan would
more generally meet the approval of the
people. There were vigorous speeches,
and sentiments quite pronounced were
given expression to concerning the atti
tude of some of the city and county
officials in neglecting to give the race rep
resentation in their offices. It was de
cideu to hold a mass-meeting during the
month of April and a committee consist
ing of Messrs. A. A. Collins, J. A. Wilds,
J. B. Wilson, P. W. Moore, George In
graham. James Summers and .lames
Washington was named by Chairman
Holland to arrange for the gathering and
prepare topics for discussion. Some time
ago Mr. Wilds presented the league with a
diagram map oi the county and by it the
location of every colored voter is known.
From the report of the election committee
appointed at the last meeting it is evident
that some good work is being done.

OAKLAND. Cal., March 11.â Michael
Hayden, an old man 72 years of age, was
taken irom his home, 903 Second street, to

he wants to die and go to meet his wife.
He is a native of Ireland, and lived the
early part of his life in England and Scot
land", coming to America over thirty years
ago. He declined to take broth and crack
ers prepared for him and said he would
never again take food. His mind appears
to be affected.

OAKLAND, Cal., March 11.â The dam
age suit of J. J. Corey as administrator of
the estate of Marilla Gay against the
Southern Pacific Kailroad Company was
compromised to-day by the company

Not at All Anxious to Enter the

Miss Eubanks.
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 11. |
President Thomas J. Thompson of the
Associated Law Students of Oakland real
izes that he has a tight on his hands. He
is also cognizant of the fact that he is at
Thomas J. Thomas, President of the Associated Law students, v> no says .ntss
Eubanks Has Libeled Him, and Archie McDonald, Who Opposed the Admis
sion of Women
[Drawn from a photograph. j
once shorn of nearly all his power of de
fense because his antagonist is a woman.
He entered a general denial to-day to all
the allegations of M;.-s Enbank* 5 com
plaint. He starts out by denying all that
part of the complaint that comes under the
"knowledge and belief clause, and then
begins in earnest. He says:
"I will agree that Mis.s Eubanks is 'a
coming woman' and has always been a
faithful student, and so long as she says
so I will agree that 'early in life' she con
cluded that the study of law was her forte.
I will also admit, since she says so, 'that
she made herself conversant with Cooley's
Blackstone and the more complicated
branches of jurisprudence.' I deny that
our organization is a 'boys 1 brigade.' or
that Miss Eubanks applied for admission
that she might 'profit ny the mistakes of
the students.'
"The facts of the case are these: A
clause in our constitution provides that a
person to be eligible to membership in our
association must be a male citizen of good
moral character between 17 and 25 years of
age," said he.
"Ed Gehring proposed the name of Miss
Susie Eubanks for membership. It was
laid on the table for a week. Upon coming
up for discussion last Monday night Archie
McDonald argued that Miss Eubanks was
not eligible, as our constitution stated that
any person wishing to become a member
of our association must be a male, and re
ferred to the clause in the constitution.
"After a long discussion a ruling by the
chair was called for and the chair sus
tained McDonald's 'point of order.' An
appeal was immediately taken. The mem
bers then voted to sustain McDonald and
the president, l'ersonally I was in favor
of admitting Miss EubanKs, and had Mr.
(jehring. in proposing her mime, gone
about it properly â that is, by offering an
amendment to the constitution admitting
ladies â I would have worked for its pas
sage. After seeing that there was no wav
in which to mase her a member Mr.
Gehring withdrew her name.
"It is very possible that the amendment
to the constitution may yet pa*s and then
Jadies will be admitted. I want to have
their refining influence shed on our delib
erations."
Miss Frankie Lane, who was refused
admittance to the Alameda County Law
Association a few months ago, is support
ing MissSnbankl in her tightatrainst mas
culine tyranny.
"Why, I thought they formed this new
organization in order to admit womc-n,"
she said to-day. "The trouble all lies in
the fact that the n.ale students are afraid
of what the newspapers will say in regard '
to the matter. That was whut made the
other association refuse to admit me. The
boys read some sensational article in a j
newspaper, and were so weak-minded as
to allow it to sway their opinions.
"A woman has the right to join any â 
incorporated association for the purpose of
paining letral knowledge, and ie is a shame
when she is refused admittance. All that
I can say of the Associated Law Students
is that as American gentlemen they have
acted in a small-minded way in refusing
to admit ladies in their organization."
ILLICIT OPIUM FACTORY
Two Chinamen Arrested in Ala
meda for Cooking the
Drug.
Senator Stewart's Alameda Real Es
tate â Failure to Provide for
a Child.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March ILâ Charlie
Louie and Wong Chine, two Chineseolam
di^gers, were arrested last night at mid
night .by a Deputy Collector of Revenue,
charged with maintaining an illicit opimn
eookmt* factory. The two Chinamen were
prepar^ug an inferior quality of opium by
mixing the leavings and scrapmtrs of pipes
with crude opium and cooking it over
again. They were not operating largely,
and probably doing a little business with
a few of their countrymen who could only
afford the poorest quality of the drug. The
Deputy Collector put handcuffs on them
and brought them to the jail, when he
found that he did not have the key, and
the irons were perforce permitted to re
main on the prisoners all night. This
morning they were sawed off.
City Hall Chime.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 11.â An effort
is being made to provide a chime of eight
bells for the new City Hall tower. It is
estimated that the ciimes will cost $1600.
A good start toward that sum has been
raised from donations, and it is expected
the patriotic citizens will do something
more' in that line. Besides it is proposed
to give entertainments and to add to the
fund in any legitimate way possible. The
chime will be set to play the National
hymn "America," besides other airs.
There is no other chime like the one pro
posed in any public building in California.
Senator Stewart's Taxes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 11.â The pub
lished accounts of Senator Stewart's de
linquency on his municipal taxes in the
sum of $940 90 recalls that he has been a
holder of very valuable property in this
city, and still retains a very generous slice
of it. He purchased in 1887 all the exten
sive holdings of Horace W. Carpentier. It
was in several parcels, and embraced
nearly 100 acres, and some of it was the
choicest property in Alameda, located
along Central and contiguous avenues.
He held a number of auction sales and
, realized good prices, but of late his prop
erty has not been pushed on the market.
All of it is good, however. He still owns
a fourth of the original purchase. The
original purchase price was $100,000. The
Senator has not been in Alameda to look
alter his interests for live years.
Failure to Provide.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 11.â C. C.
Brock was to-day arrested on a warrant
issued out of the San Francisco Police
Court on a charge of failure to provide for
his minor child. He was immediately re
leased on bonds. He is the second son of
the late Christian Brock, in his life a well
known ship-owner of San Francisco. C. C.
Brock's wife secured a divorce from him
three months ago. With the divorce she
also secured tne custody of their minor
child and $H0 a month for the child's sup
port. This has never been paid and is the
cause of the arrest. Brock was absent in
Alaska while the divorce was being ob
tained, arriving home about the time it
was granted. He is getting ready to go
back again, being connected with a sal
mon-canning industry.
Thp Glorious Fourth.
ALAMEDA. Cal., March 11.â There is
said to be a movement to get up a county
celebration of tbe Fourth ol July and hold
it in Alameda. This city offers uncommon
attractions for such a celebration. Its
streets are unsurpassed for parades. Its
sidewalks are shady from bordering trees.
There is a fine large room in the City Hall
in which to have the speaking, provided
it was not desired to have it in the
public park. Alameda sume years ago
celebrated every anniversary of the Fourth
with groat earnestness and success.

The Supreme Court has decided that
Ah Quay was wrong when he claimed
that Judge Wood had no authority to send
Dim to jail. The decision is the result of
habeas corpus broucht by Attorney Chap
man on behalf of Ah Quay and Attorney
Tom Garrity.
The argument made was that the Oakland
Police Court was created under the Whit
ney net, and that this act was unconstitu
tional; therefore Judge Wood had no
right to order any one to jail. In the case
of Attorney Garrity the Judge bad fined
him $25 or one day's imprisonment for
contempt of court. The case was appealed,
but it was Tiot pressed till the case of the
Chinaman was decided.
This morning Attorney Chapman ap
peared to the Police Court and announced
that he was ready to pnv Ah Quay's line.
He wanted his two weeks' sojourn ia jail
while he was waiting for ihe Supreme
Court's decision to count as part of the
tine, hut this was not allowed, so the full
line of $100 was paid. When Ganity'a
case is taken up he will either have to pay
his fine or f.pend one day in prison.
M. C. Chapman, the attorney lor the ap
plicant, in ipeaJtiOgol the case, said: "I
have expected tiiey wouid deny the writ.
I had a talK with the Chief Justice in
chambers and we argued the matter at
length. There are no legal grounds for de
nying it, yet I believe they feared the con
sequences had they granted it. It would
have overturned so many statutes ana rev
olutionized so much legislation that they
thought it better to rule as they have
done."
The i Yellow River is styied the "Sorrow
of China." During the last century it has
changed its course twenty-two times, and
now (lows info Ihe sea through a mouth
300 miles distant from that of a hundred
years ago. It is estimated that its Hoods
m the present century have cost something
like 11,000,000 of lives.
POLICEMEN TO CONTEST
Oakland's Star-Wearers Think
They Can Out-Shoot San
Franciscans.
THEIR CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
After the First Match a Trophy Will
Be Shot For at Regular
Intervals.
Oakland Office San Francipco Call.)
IX)8 Broadway, March 11. |
The San Francisco Police Department,
by Captain Wittman, has accepted the
challenge of the Oakland department to
shoot off a match at Shell Mound Park
on the 28th. of this month.
For a long tim< there has been a monthly
medal contest between the members of the
Oakland force, and the decoration has
freely changed hands. The men think
they are, on the whole, second to none on
the coast, and many tales of prowess are
told in the little waiting-room where the
officers report on and off. There is as
much interest taken in the monthly shoot
as in the arrest of gold-brick men and boy
burglars, and the efficiency of the police as
regards marksmanship is undoubtedly
good. Consequently the match with the
San Francisco force is being looked for
ward to with great interest, and bets are
being freely made, but always with Oak
land on the long end, as locai confidence
is very great.
The" little neatly sewn leather medal, let
tered in gold, which is the only induce
ment so far offered for excellency, is at
preÂ»entheld by Officer Jacobus. It has been
held by over a dozen men in turn, and
many matches have been made over it in
dependent of the regular monthly shoot.
There is also another medal that no one
will wear. It was manufactured by Jailor
Swain and is made of wood, and is about a
foot in diameter. There is some doubt as
to who it should decorate, but there is
never any demand for it, and it is said
that it is now the property of Officer
Mat key, but he denies it. This modal is
the legitimate property of the man whose
bullets strike nearest the fence surround
ing the bullseye.
Captain Fletcher has not yet named his
team, but it will be taken from the :o.low
ing, all of whom have at one time or
another worn the gilt-lettered medal:
Officers Arnert, Andrews, Banks, Jacobus,
Kingsbury, McCarthy, Sbaul, Shroeder,
Scanlan, Sill, Juiler Swain and Detective
Williams. All of these men have fre
quently made full scores, and will be a
hard team to beat.
The ban Francisco captain has about
200 men to select from, while Captain
Fletcher's entire force does not exceed
fifty men. Trie rifles to be used are 4i
caliber Winchesters.
The local men are taking frequent trips
to the Shell Mound ranges and practicing,
and frequent references are maae to the
turkey and champagne that the defeated
San Franciscans will have to pay for when
the match is over.
It is very probable that after the first
match has been decided a handsome
trophy will be hung up to be shot for at
stated periods.
DUKE OLDENBOURG SAFE.
Berkeley's Missing Royal Stu
dent Has Turned Up
Serenely.
A Bonus for the Extension of the San
Pablo Streetcar Lineâ Students
to Labor.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 11.â Charles
Louis Oldenbourg and his diamond ring
are safe. The prospective heir to a Ger
man dukedom, who was the cause of so
much anxiety on the part of his leilow
students at Berkeley yesterday, by his
long continued and unaccounted for ab
sence, has been located. He has not been
in Berkeley, however, so far as is known,
since the announcement in The Call of
his prospects of succeeding his uncle to
the duchy of Oiuenbourg and the ac
quirement of the vast landed estates which
po with the royal title. Yesterday his
fraternity brothers at the university were
particularly anxious to learn of his where
abouts, for nothing had been lr ard of him j
since last Saturday. To-day, however, he
was seen on the Oakland ooat bound for
San Francisco, by several of his university
associates. When asked where he had
been, he replied that he had been away
from Berkeley, bavins a ploasant time.
When the report reached Berkeley that
Oldenbonrg had been seen a feeling of relief
came over those who had read oHiis mys- j
tenons disappearance and extended ab
sence. Though the theory of his having
met with foul play as advanced by his
fraternity brethren was not generally cred
ited, yet there were many who believed
that on account of the heavy diamond
ring which he wore and the reported large
amount of money in his possession he had
been waylaid by road agents or inveigled
into sonic deadly trap by daring malefac
tors, who lie in "wait for just such oppor
tunities.
The students who have been informed
of his safety are anxious to know why
he does not return to Berkeley and account
for himself. L. 0. Hiltorn stated to-day
that OlQenboarg Intends leaving for Mexico
on the steamer which sails the 18th inst.,
to join his father, who will go with him to
German; for the puruoae of settling pre
liminary maXters connected with his
acquirement of the right of succession to
the dukedom. This, however, was after
Mr. Hilborn had learned of his safety.
Prior to that Mr. liilborn had notified
Chief of I'olice Lloyd of the unaccountable
absence oi his friend, and the Oakland
police spent nearly half a day searching
for him.
The San Pablo Streetcar*.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 11.â The
West Berkeley Progressive Club has se
cured pledges of $11<X) toward a fund of
,s">ikjO to be offered as a bonus for the exten
sion of the San Pablo avenue streetcar line
into "West Berkeley. Charies A. Bailey
will give $ lUOO of the sum offered. 0. M.
Spear, president of the club, has agreed to
give $lUO.
Mr. Bailey, who is one of Berkeley's
largest property-owners, addressed the club
at considerable length last night on the
subject of improvements that are contem
plated as means ol aiding in the develop
ment of the town. In reference to the
wharf for which the club has been agita
ting, Mr. Bailey stated that the expendi
ture of $80,000 on such an enterprise would
beawasteof money and 'ha; if a wharf
would pay returns on capital required for
its construction one would be built by
private capital.
In the course of his address Mr. Bailey
urged that the club endeavor to have San
Pablo avenue improved over the whole
distance to Oakland, thus giving West
Berkeley a direct and wide thorouehfore
to that" city. He also suggested that
efforts be made to change the steam local
service so that trains for West Berkeley
would leave the East Berkeley line at
Golden Gate instead of at Shell Mound as
now. The rejuvenation of the California
and Nevada Railroad, the securing of a
better water supply for West Berkeley and
agitation to make Berkeley an important
point on the line of the San Joaquip
Valley Railroad were other subjects dwelt
upon by Mr. Bailey.
At the conclusion of his address Mr.
Bailey was elected v member of the club,
and Messrs. Spear. Wilkes and Niehaus,
with Mr. Bailey, were chosen to constitute
a committee that is to investigate the
various enterprises that were discussed.
The club also appointed a committee,
consisting of Trustees Hoff C. Durrill and
Mr. Bailey, to wait upon F. K. Shattuck
and endeavor to secure a renewal of his
offer of a site at Dwight way for the Wil
merding School. Mr. Shattuck's offer was
made to the Regents of the university and
was withdrawn, he having received no re
sponse from the Regents acknowledging
his offer.

Students Will Work Again.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 11. â The
student labor brigade will resume its
work on the university campus next Fri
day morning, with the hope of completing
the improvements by Saturday at midday.
Regent Rein-neiii and President Kellogg
held a conference to-day, when it was di
cided to give the students another day and
a half.
The greatest part of the uncompleted
work is that of excavating around North
Hall. It will be the purpose of the student
laborers to rinish what further digging is
found to be necessary in this region, and
then to cover the hard clay through which
they have been cutting with a layer of
sott earth, so that flowers and vines may
be planted around the building.
The half-finished walk through Lovers'
Lane will also be completed. The neces
sary grading and part of the stone laying
has been done on it, but the fine rock and
gravel is yet to be put down. It is under
stood that more implements will be on
hand so that every one who wishes can
work.
President Kellogg, Regent Reinstein and 1
Professors Hiigard and Randall spent
considerable time to-day in looking over
the half-completed work and devising
ways of undertaking the remainder so
that it mignt be entirely finished by Satur
day noon.

WILL MEET AT REDWOOD
The Republican Fifth District
Congressional Committee to
Be Created.
THINGS MOVE IN THE FOURTH
The Mahoney-Kelly Congressional Com
mittee Champions Itself and Gets
Ready for Action.
The Republican political proceedings to
day of greatest interest will be the meeting
at Redwood City this afternoon of the
State Central Committeemen representing
the Fifth District.
Up till yesterday it had remained un
certain whether or not this meeting would
occur according to the somewhat petulant
adjournment taken by Messrs. Ayer, Rosa
and Dawson last week, when they met in
ignorance of the postponement of the
meeting announced by Chairman Corn
wall. It had been supposed that some
arrangement would be effected by which
the meeting would be again postponed in
accordance with the tacit agreement
reached at the last meeting of the execu
tive committee of the State Central Com
mittee that nothing should be done re
garding the affairs of either the Fourtn or
Fifth districts until after the next meeting
of the executive committee, which will
occur to-day. But yesterday it became
certain that the Fifth District meeting
would be held to-day and that all of the
eleven committeemen of the district would
be there in person or represented by proxy.
It is understood also that the meeting will
likely be harmonious. It is pro liable that
the Congressional committee for the Fifth
District will be appointed to-day.
The Mahoney-Kelly Fourth District com
mittee unexpectedly held a meeting yes
terday forenoon and took what is regarded
by many to be snap action. As has been
stated, the leaders of all elements con
cerned with the affair of the Fourth and
Fifth districts agreed last Thursday at the
meeting of the executive committee that
everything should remain in statu quo for
another week. A truce was declared with
a view of bringing about a settlement of
the tangle, if possible.
In disregard of this understanding four
of the seven members of the Fourth Dis
trict Congressional committee appointed
at that snap Saturday night meeting at
the Baldwin Hotel held a meeting yester
day afternoon and made an effort to for
tify their position. This is the committee
that was created by the votes of two of the
eleven State Committeemen, one legiti
mate proxy and two forged proxies.
Those present yesterday were: J. S.
Spear Jr., A. Bernard. A. P. Kearney and
W. P. Howe. There was introduced and
adopted a long resolution reciting a por
tion of the proceedings of the meeting of
the State Central Committee and the pro
ceedings of the Baldwin Hotel meeting
and declaring that committee the only
regular and legal one. The resolution also
stated that the committee had been offi
cially recognized by the executive com
mittee.
It was then decided that the committee
should go riiiht ahead witti the issuance of
the call for a Congressional convention
and the holding of a primary election. A
committee of five to prepare the call and
supervise election proceedings was ap
pointed, consisting of those present and
N. J. Williams. Tiiis committee wiil meet
again this afternoon and proceed to do
something further.
The committee brought forth still more
evidence of its regularity, legality and
purity. It was contained in a lonj: atli
davit" by Martin Kelly. Kelly's affidavit
was devoted to a denial that the proxy of
John Martin, State Central committee
man from the Forty-fifth District, voted
by Senator Mahoney that night, was
forged. It was Kelly who procured the
alleged proxy, according to his story, and
it was Senator Mahoney who voted it.
With the forged proxies of M^Fsrs. Mel
sing and Martin, Mahoney and Kelly were
able to exhibit their majority, and it will
be remembered that Mr. Martin has made
affidavit that he gave nobody his proxy,
verbally or in writing, and ttiat if his
proxy was used it was forged. Kelly's
affidavit states that he met Martin that
night and that Martin verbally gave him
permission to use his name. Kelly used
this proxy by telling Mahoney to use it.
This committee has; endeavored to for
tify itself by conveying to Chairman Corn
wall of the executive comruitte, who is
friendly to it, a formal report of its crea
i tiun and organization, and by receiving
from him "official" acknowledgment ot
the report and his recognition. This is ex
pected to look well and to give the com
mittee a little prestige, but the committee
might as well have received official recog
nition from Governor Budd. The call
adopted by the State committee, provid
ing* for me Congressional committees,
makes them supreme. The executive
committee or its chairman have no juris
diction over them in any degree, and Mr.
Cornwall's "recognition" amounts to noth
ing.
The executive committee of the State
Central Committee will meet this after
noon at 419 California street. There was
yesterday no prospect or promise of just
what would be done or attempted to be
done.
The County comniittee will hold a spe
cial meeting* to-night, which will be de
voted mainly, if not entirely to the elec
tion of a successor to M. J. Donovan, de
ceased.
She Was Not Married.
In last Monday's issue appeared a notice of
the wedding of Mrs. Nora Weilsted at Ocean
View. The notice was sent to the newspapers
by mail in the usual way find was published as
such matters are, there being no reason to be
lieve that it was not true. Yesterday Mr.-.
Nora Weilsted called at the editorial-rooms
and denied that she had been married. She
thinks that the notice was sent in by some one
who had a grudge against her or wanted to
play a practical joke upon her.
A little girl of Metz, 14 years old, named
Louise Fuchs, has Just been condemned to
eight days' imprisonment for having in
sulted the German E:nperor. The insult
consisted in writing a private letter to one
of her little friends in which there was
something disrespectful to his Majesty.
Such sentences are quite common in
Alsace-Lorraine.

It is sain that the Dowager Empress of
Germany contemplates residing perma
nently in EiiÃ'and. As far as the German
Emperor is â¢ oticerned the arrangtment is
saia to he perfectly satisfactory â even
more so. Bat tbe German ''nanceilor has
yet to sive lÂ»is consent, winch is unlikely,
unless the Empress Frederick consent'- to
Kive up part of her (ierman allowances.
Queen Victoria, with her usual thriftii
ne?s, refuses to consent to such an ar
ranpement, and so the matter remains in
BUtuquo. From England the Empress
Frederick rec-eivea an ullowaiv eof |40,000
n year. lint from Germany she receives,
"all told," a larger allowance than comes
into the coffers of Queen Victoria as rei-in-
Ing sovereign of England.

FIFTY IN FEWER
IN BURLINGAME
Half a Hundred Resigna
tions Tendered the
Swell Club.
TWO VIEWS OF PLEASURE
Some Staid Members Disliked
the Horsey Set and
British Ways.
CIRCULAR FROM DIRECTORS.
It Will Explain the Club's Condition.
Members Asked by Others
to Resign. '
Within the charmed circle which con
stitutes Burlingameâ the fashionable, se
lect am! restricted society "set" in the cluh
at San Mateo â all has not been harmony
and complete good-fellowship of late. For
with all the outward appearance of calm
and undisturbed social pleasures it now
transpires that dissatisfaction or some
difference of opinion upon matters usually
considered vital in a club has been making
itself felt among the members of the Bur
lingame Club.
As a rule the gentlemen who have taken
any interest in this aristocratic association
maintain a dignified silence regarding
whatever divergence of views upon club
affairs may have arisen. And the same
can be said of the whole membership, for
it is evidently an unwritten law in
Uurlingame to commit no breach of the
proprieties or to forget that ungentlemanly
lapses are at least bad form. So the club
lived on without ever a sign of social
revolution or startling defection of its
members.
The truth is, however, that the Bur
linpame Club has lost in the last few
months more than forty members, many
of whom actually went out in a body.
"While the names of the disaffected mem
bers could not be made public, it has been
admitted that these gentlemen largely
represent the best element in San Fran
cisco society. They include millionaires,
prominent attorneys, physicians and mer
chants. It is said that they were not alto
gether pleased with the more pronounced
horsey set in the club.
"The staid Californian," explained a
society man yesterday who is familiar
with the Burlinpame Club people and
their little differencesâ "the staid Califor
nian did not rind it at all congenial. That
is, his tastes were not in the same channel
as the ultra set with British tendencies and
a penchant for golf suits and nothing but
horses, you know, and English servants.
"The BurlingameCluo is a country club;
it runs to horses as every one knows â rid-
ing and driving, polo and golf. The
Country Club runs to dogs and game and
is all rieht for sportsmen ; but one can un
derstand that when every conversation is
on horses and British sports, the pleasure
of dropping into a retreat out of town for
a few days was really doubtful. I knew
this was coming, but did not think it
would corae so soon.
"Some time since the club induced many
nice people to become members. The ini
tiation fee was temporarily abolished, and
several parties whom I know were talked
into joining. The proposition was really
a good one and inviting. It cave the new
members a prospect of enjoying them
selves in the country with every luxury of
city life round them and good fellows for
companions. Hut they found it often
livelier in Burlingame than in the Pacific-
Union orjUniversity clubs. The gay set had
their four-in-hands and polo ponies and
swell traps and English servants, and fre
quently English ways.
"That may be the cause for the with
drawals, and it is all I have heard about
the matter. Anyhow, clearly the two sets
had little in common, and consequently
they were not coneenial."
The directors disclaimed all knowledge
of disturbance or dissatisfaction, and were
unanimous in their assertions that the
club was never before so well managed or
on such a sound financial foundation.
Yet they have deemed it prudent at this
time to issue a circular letter to every
member of the club, with a clear and full
statement of the club's present condition
with regard to finances and general status
of membership, management, and a re
view of the changes, etc.
This letter was placed in the printer's
hands yesterday and will be issued to-day.
It is quite a bulky document, covering
several pages of typewriten paper.
The introduction deals with the club in
a genera! way, and further on states that
the club suffered a loss in membership of
over forty since last August. Finances
are explained at length. In 1894 the
club's net assets were something over
$4000; in 1895 they advanced to nearJy
$f>ooo, ana now the estimate places them
between $7000 and $8000. The month of
February was the most prosperous one the
club had experienced. This showing is
made with pardonable pride by the direc
tors, who draw attention to the fact that
"the resignations have caused a loss of
$250 monthly in dues." That, by the
way, at the rate of $5 a month for mem
bership dues would make the number of
reek-nations fifty. Attention is directed

to the fact that under the new manager,
Mr. Brewer, the club stables have been
vastly improved, and ore no longer such a
heavy drag on the treasury.
A director who did not wish to appear
in connection with a discussion of the
club said he did not care if forty more
members resigned, not indeed that he
would not regret losing the company of
the present members, but from a financial
point of view, and solely in the interest of
the club, he believed it would be best. The
club, he said, would be better off with 100
members, for then every man would take
a particular interest in it, and of course the
spirit of comraderie would be strength
ened.
"Several members would go down to the |
club," he added, "and expected to have
tiie same attendance and service as at the
Pacific-Union Club in town. And they i
felt disappointed and disgruntled because j
luncheon could not be served at almost '
any hour. It was not fair to expect so j
much from a country club. I suppose I
these gentlemen have changed their
minds, but that makes little or no dif
ference. The club will continue to live i
and be popular and prosperous."
Harold Wheeler, a member of the board,
stated that when the club increased its
membership at one time by offering spe- i
cial inducements a large number of good
mew joined, thinking they would have
many a pleasant visit to Burlingame. They
rarely went there, however, and had no
inter >st in the club and resigned. That
was all he knew of the cause of the fifty:
resignations, he said.
The fact, however, that at least one very
prominent member of the club was asked
by other clubmen to resign indicates that
a concerted movement has been afoot in ;
Burlingame.
OBJECTS TO THE TRENCH.
An Asgensment of Garrett Bnrke Ques
tioned by Expert Elder.
George W. Elder, the State expert of the
Board of Supervisors, has advised Mayor
Sutro that the assessment asked by Gar
rett Burke for sewerine Eighteenth street
from Ash bury street to its easterly ter
mination is irregular, and that thesigninp
of the assessment should be deferred until
the worK is properly done. His communi
cation is as follows:
I find on examination of the sewer assess
ment Issued to Garrett Burke for a sewer con
structed on Eighteenth street irom Ashburv to
its easterly termination, that the specifications
have not been complied with as follows:
The specifications require that the sewer
trench should l<e refilled in such manner as to
leave the street in proper condition. I find
that the sewer trench has sunk in some places
all the way from one to three feet. I would,
therefore, recommend that your Honor with
hold your signature until the street is put In
proper condition.
THE ONLY SISTER "DEER"
Miss Tillie Morrisey Made an
Honorary Member of the
Order of Elks.
In Recognition of Many Courtesies She
Is Presented With a Handsome
Silver Card.
The members of Golden Gate Lodge Xo.
6, Benevolent Protective Order of Elk?,
believe in gratitude ana never allow an
opportunity to pass when they can show
their appreciation of courtesies.
On many occasions Miss Tillie Morrisey,
a well-known singer, has volunteered when
the lodge gave entertainments for the en
joyment of their many friends, and added
to the attractiveness of the performance
by vocalizations which were always well
received. At the last meeting of the lodge,
after the routine business was over, a com
mittee of three was selected, of which C. W.
Nevin was appointed to call on the lady
and inform her that her presence was
wanted at the lodgeroom, and when it
was announced that she was present act-
Miss Tillie Morrisey, the Only "Deer" of the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks
in California.
ing Exalted Ruler W. V. Schlam declared
the lodge at ease and the members joined
hands and sang "Auld Lang Syne."
The commntee and the lady then en
tered the room and marched to the altar,
where she was formally introduced to each
member, and then the acting exalted
ruler, in a brief SDeech, presented Miss
Morrisey a beautiful wine-colored velvet
case, and on raising the cover the lady dis
covered a heavy silver card, on which was
engraved:
Charity. Justice.
Mis* Tillie Morrisey: Golden Gate Lodge, No.
6, B. P. O. Elks, takes pleasure in presenting
you this card as a token of love and esteem for
courtesies extended.'
J. O. Reis, Exalted Ruler.
Brotherly Love. Fidelity.
The lady was also civen a certificate
showing that she had been elected an hon
orary member of the lodge, and the state
ment was made that she was the only
"sister deer" belonging to the order in Cal
ifornia.
Miss Morrisey thanked "her brothers"
for the honor conferred and for the beauti
ful gift, after which she joined them in
singing "Should Auld Acquaintance be
Foreot."

i property she left to her executors in trust
j for her two minor children. The execu
j tors are Daniel Sullivan and P. H. Meyer.
The contestants will be the older chit
' dren, who have been practically disin
! herited by their mother. They will allege
! undue influence.
The executors say that Mrs. Goodspeed
j has for years intended to divide her prop
â  erty just as she has done, for her divorced
i husband has considerable means of his
I own, and she expected him to help ;the
older children. She was a shrewd woman
and always transacted her own business,
and the executors do not believe the will
can. be broken. To justify her disposal of the
property Mrs. Goodspeed says in her will:
That my motive may not be misunderstood
I here state that I give the most of my property
to my two minor children because of their
tender years ana consequent helplessness. The
other children are of aÂ«e and better able to
take care of themselves in affairs of the world.
SHARKEY AND GREGGAINS.
The Pugilist* Will Meet lv an Kight-
Round Content This Kvenlng.
The much talked-of contest between
Alexander Greggains, the champion of
the tire laddies, and Tom Sharkey, ihe
pride of the American navy, will take
place this evening at the Bush-street Thea
ter.
Sharkey is a favorite at slight odds,
but it is thought that the friend m of Greg
gains will muster at the poolrooms this
evening and bet the supporters of the
hari-hittine Sharkey to a standstill, in
the language of the turfites. Both Shar
key and Gregeains are reported to be in
first-class condition, and it can be safely
predicted that the contest, which is eight
rounds, will be very spirited from atart to
finish.
Following the event of the evening an
eight-round contest will be held between
Phil McGoldrich of Los Angeles and Dal
Hawkins, the pride of the sporting frater
nity who favor local talent. Strange to say,
the Los Angeles man is the favorite in the
betting, notwithstanding the fact that his
opponent can blind him so far as scientific
boxing is concerned
DREAD THE STRANGLER
His Work Has Caused a Panic
Among the Demi-Mond
aines.
The Police Are Unable to Fathom the
Mystery of the Berthe Paradis
Murder.
It has cost the lives of two unfortunate
womenâ May McDermott and Berthe Par
adis â to somewhat relieve the congestion
of bare-faced crime in some of the arteries
ofjvice of this City.
The women of the half-world for whom
the mysterious strangler appears to have a
particular preuilection are terror-stricken,
and are stampeding in all directions.
Three of the American and two of the
Japanese women on St. Mary street va
cated their dens yesterday, but the French
women, who require more time to gather
up their effects, remained over night, and
many of them will to-day put up "to let"
signs on their windows.
Many of these women and their con
sorts own small ranches in the country,
some of which are located in the neigh
borhood of outlying towns in the surround
ing counties. It is their custom each sum
mer to spend a couple of weeks in the
country, and they will take advantage of
the strangler scare to hasten their depar
ture and lengthen their stay.
The detectives, directed by Captain Lees,
have interrogated every habitue and every
resident of St. Mary street and its entour
age, hoping to obtain some clew that
would lead to the identity of the mur
derer. Their researches, however, have so
far proved futile. Those who knew the
woman regarded her as a sickly thing who
should have been sent to the hospital long
since, as the stamp of death had placed it
self on her brow nearly a year a^ro. They
were aware that while her "friend and pro
tector," Cresar Cuabert, was magnanimous
enough to refrain from beating her, he
still insisted that she, broken down and
suffering, continue at her infamous traffic
to earn money for his support.
The males in that sphere of degradation
had little to say about the dead woman.
To their blunted sense of justice and mo
rality the killing assumed tne form of a
dread epidemic that might sooner or later
be visited upon their own bread-winners.
They filled the ears of all listeners with
praises for their fellow-idler, Caesar
Chabert. They regarded it is an outrage
that his belongings in the way of letters,
papers and clothing had been removed
from the dead woman's room, and espe
cially that anybody could believe he had
a hand in the crime. "Why should he kill
her?" they asked, and in the same breath
answered the question themselves, saying:
"Why. he just worshiped the ground she
walked on. Every night he would call and
escort hÂ«Â»r from her room, and at times
when she was sick and too weak to walk
be would pick her up like a child and
carry her to their lodgings at 528 Pine
street."
Captain Lees â  questioned ' Cesar. Cbabert
very closely last Â« night* in ; regard to the
financial condition of the woman. His
statement was -to. the ."effect ; that she had
but little money when he saw her last alive.
She had then bat $2 and a $10 piece he gave
her.'out of which she spent $6 for a wrapper,
$3 for the rent of her room and 50 cents for
face-powder. li The remainder of the money
was found in the dead woman's purse.
. Cesar Chabert on Tuesday night.suc
ceeded in gaining permission to have the
body removed rto an undertaKer's i estab
lishment, whence she will rbe buried to
morrow afternoon. Yesterday afternoon
the body was returned to the morgue for a
few minutes,' where it was viewed by the
jury which is to sit on the case this morn
ing, and it was subsequently sent back Sto
the undertaker.:
