WITH TURKEY.

From This Country.
LONDON. E>:g., Jan. 23.â A dispatch
from Constantinople to the Pall Mall
Gazette says:
An offensive and defensive alliance has
been concluded between Russia and Tur
key. The basis of the treaty is on the
Unkiar-Skelessi agreement. The treaty
has been signed here and ratification has
been exchanged at St. Petersburg between
Aarej Pasha and the Czar.
M. Caiabon, French Embassador to
Turkey, had an audience with the Sultan
on January 21, which lasted two hours.
This tends to show that France is in all
probability a member of the new alliance.
The Gazette's correspondent is believed
to be inside of the British embassy. The
nkiar-Skelessi agreement dates back to
1533 and amounts to a reduction of Turkey
to the position of a vassal state. The
treaty bound the Russian and Turkish
Governments to mutually assist one an
other to resist foreign aggression and to
help each other in case of international
dangers. Turkey was at the time of the
conclusion of the agreement in a state of
collapse.
Russia waives the matter of assistance
promised by Turkey and receives instead
permission in the event of Russia's being
at war to close the Dardanelles to warship*,
of all nations. The Western powers refused
to recognize the treaty, which was soon
tacitly abandoned. The Pall Mall Gazette
guarantees the reliability of the sources of
information of its representative at Con
stantinople. '"/.-ijTfi
The Standard publishes a dispatch from
Constantinople under the date of January
22, which says that the Turkish Ministers
assembled at a meeting Tuesday evening,
the alleged occasion of which was the re
ceipt by the Porte of a telegram from
Shakir Pasha, the imperial Commissioner
appointed to carry out the reforms in
Armenia, reporting tbat the Armenians
are reduced to the last extremity and are
being decimated by hunger and cold and
are committing revolutionary acts out of
cheer despair.
It is reported that the Sultan's favorite
izzet has been directed to formulate a re
ply to the letter written to the Sultan by
Queen Victoria.
The Porte has given out the information
that two Armenians, believed . to be mem
bers of the Armenian revolutionary com
mittee, have murdered the Armenian
Bishop of Boghes.
The correspondent of The United Press
at Constantinople under date of January
22 writes as follows: 'Ay'pA
The United Press is given to understand
that United States Minister Terrell has
not received the assent of the Porte to his
pressing demands for the admission of. the
American Red Cross Society into Asia
Minor for the purpose of distributing re
lief to the â  suffering' Armenians. The

Red Cross Society and the British em

society undertaking the work of relief

A telegram received here to-day from
Aintab says that the foreign Consuls, who
were delegated to' mediate between the
Turks who are besieging Zeitoun and the
Armenians who are holding the town, have
arrived at Aintab. Some of them had all
their baggage stolen en route.
A letter received here from Marash says
that the Turks have been severely beaten
and repulsed. Near the Hot Springs the
commanding officer of the Turkish soldiers
placed the regular men in the front ranks
and ; the . reserves, next. As they were
marching against the Armenians a terrific
explosion - occurred and many of the
soldiers were blown to atoms. It is
probable that dynamite was used. The
Turks say that flames suddenly burst from
the earth.
Other accounts confirm the surmise that
dynamite was used against the Turks.
They were caught in a defile, and a large
number of them were killed. The Turks
afterward succeeded .in capturing the
barracks and cut off the water supply from
the Armenians. Tp..y; -. _**\ Ay./ A

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23. â The
National Armenian Relief Committee has
issued an announcement stating that the
â¢work of raising funds ana of organizing
relief committees throughout the United
States will be pushed with redoubled

methods of organizing and raising funds,
the condition of the sufferers, and so forth.
The Mayors of cities and clergymen and

Seasons for the Belief That a Treaty
Has Been Arranged.
LONDON, Eng.. Jan. 23.â Dispatches re
ceived here show that ignorance is de
clared in official quarters in Paris, Berlin
and Vienna of an offensive and defensive
alliance having been entered upon by Rus
sia and Turkey. In some quarters the re
port is characterized as ridiculous.
' Nevertheless, it is widely admitted that
the recent known exchange of communi
cations between Russia and Turkey justify
the expectation of some agreement be
tween the two powers. A dispatch from
Paris which the Standard will publish to
morrow says that inquiries made in that
city failed to prove knowledge in official
circles of the existence of such an alliance
but brought forth a denial that it was pos
sible for a treaty to be concluded on the
lines of the Unkiar-Skelessi agreement, as
that would imply an inevitable war.
â  The Berlin correspondent of the Daily
News says he linds such an alliance is re
garded as not improbable, which is con
firmed by the Post's Berlin representative.
The Vienna correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph says that the rumor is in no wise
new, it having been in circulation for some
time in Vienna in various forms. This
correspondent adds that inquiries have
resulted in the expression of a con
sensus of opinion that no such
treaty has been concluded, but he further
says that none is needed, as the cordial,
unstipulated agreement between Russia
and Turkey, based upon mutual interests,
is firmer and more complete now than at
any time since the war of 1877.
The Daily Graphic says the report was
received by a London daily paper some
weeks ago from Rome. Inquiries failed to
establish the truth of the dispatch, and it
was therefore suppressed.

A VERY BITTER; DEBATE;
It Was Started at the Washing
ton Conference by the Speech
of Mr. Hatch.
DEFEAT OF JOSEPH BLACKBUBN.
Champions of White Metal Do Not
Relish the Situation in the
Blue Grass State.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. ; 23.-The
morning session of the free-silver confer
ence was wholly given over to an acrimo
nious debate between the Populists and
silver men, the committee on reeolutions
being still occupied with framing its re
port and it being deemed impracticable to
transact any business in its absence.
The discussion was provoked by the
declaration of ex-Congressman Hatch of
Missouri, who has come out squarely as a
candidate for the Presidential nomination
on the silver ticket, and who in an impas
sioned speech has blamed the Populists
for the defeat of that sterling silver candi
date Joseph Blackburn of Kentucky.
Ex-Vice Presidential Candidate Field of
the Populist party vigorously combated
Mr.. Hatch's statements this morning, and
caused considerable excitement and bad
feeling by his pointed references to influ
ences exerted â¢ in the j Kentucky campaign
by President Cleveland, Secretary Carlisle
and others. . .7; y : pypp- .
Amid frequent interruptions and much
enthusiasm Mr. Hatch replied in his own
defense and hotly reiterated his criticisms
of the Populists' action in putting a
ticket in the field which had barely drawn
enough votes from the Democrats" to elect
a single gold standard Republican.
Senator Marion Butler of North Caro
lina repudiated the alleged facts set forth
by Mr. Hatch. He had been present in
Kentucky before the campaign and de
clared that his party had not decided to
enter the contest until after the Demo
crats had up a straddling platform indors
ing a bond-issuing administration, and
until Hardin had interpreted the plat
form directly in opposition to its proper
intent as recognizing metallic parity.
The committee, on organization subse
quently reported on holding a convention
at St. Louis July 227 7 The appointment of
delegates based upon 7 the silver strength

ATTORNEY BOND BEGINS.
Points Out the Unfair. Provisions
of the Law of Irrigation
- â¢ Districts.
ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT JUST.
Lands Not Benefited Heavily Taxed,
While Property Enriched Es
capes Entirely.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23âThere
were few spectators in the United States
I Supreme jj Court to-day; when arguments
commenced in the Wright irrigation case.
The case came up unexpectedly, as it was
believed it would not be reached until
Friday.- There will be a big crowd in at
tendance to-morrow to hear 'ex-President
Harrison's argument.
Thomas H. Bond of Lakeport, Cal.,
made the 'opening argument to-day. He
explained the case thoroughly! and : then,
in; the course of his argument, declared
that â  the Wright act combines, the vices
and- iniquities of all the special assess
ments for ..local i improvements that had
ever fallen under his observation. . It ex
empts mortgages, personal property, or
chards, vineyards and growing crops from
taxation. â â .: V- 7 . . . â  A-
, The 5 very things which are produced by
irrigation are exempt under its provisions,
while jj brick, stone, a lake tract of swamp
land, or other property, including whole
towns j and cities, which by no possibility
can derive any benefit from the system of
irrigation devised by it, may bo taxed for
all they are; worth to construct works of
irrigation j and "charged perpetually to
maintain and to operate them, and to pay
salaries of officials and defray all other ex
penses for irrigating desert lands.
. The, peculiarities of assessment provided
for under the Wright act, he said, are as
follows: It âis. unlimited, the 7 property
must be assessed as a basis for taxation for
its full cash value. It is noi levied accord
ing benefit, but in an inverse propor
tion to benefit, property very valuable pay
ing a large tax,. though ,it can receive no
benefit, and worthless property 'which
might be benefited paying nothing.
. The assessment is .perpetual. It '- not
only ; may but it must be levied for all
time to come upon .propeity.to pay for the
expenses of , the operation of the works and
the paying of . salaries of officers. Ji It is
levied on houses, railroads, churches and
other structures on lands which are as
sessed 7 according to their value and not
according to benefit. : 7 7 -â â Â-., '- ,
The so-called improvements are : not
improvements on ,. or - of . the. property
assessed, which enhances its value. The
dams, ditches and canals, the ? only j works
which a district can construct, are not
improvements '.' on â -' or ; of *â¢ the 7 property,
which necessarily. enhance the value of tbe
property.': 7\7l' '7/ "â¢ ' ' - '.T 7:'y^7^T r 777T7T
."This," Bond continued, "we say, is to
take property without due process of law,
and is repugnant to the fourteenth amend
ment of ; the Federal constitution. Coun
sel on the other side claim that whether
the land is or is not benefited is a question
of fact which we do not deny, but whether
the land which it is conceded by no possi
bility can be benefited may be taxed for all
it is worth for local improvements, and to
maintain and -operate the works-forever
aiterward, is a question of law and a Federal
question â a question whether it' is not
taking property without due process of
law. â 
"To validate the bonds means to de
clare that the assessment providing for
their payment is legal' and constitutional,
for as long as any question remains un
decided as to the only means provided for
payment of bonds, it cannot be said that
the latter are valid. To validate bonds
means more than to adjudge that they
are genuine and perfect in form, for if
there is no means of paying them they
would be valueless and the object of the
statute would not be attained, for the ob
ject of the statute is to give an assurance
to investors that there will be no litigation
in the future, and that no resistance will
be made to the payment of bonds when
they mature, so that they may sell to
greater advantage than they otherwise
would, and therefore to validate bonds is
to determine that the assessment under
the Wright act, the only means provided
for their payment, is constitutional and
legal. Â;-'â¢ 7y, AyPpy
"We insist that the decision of the State
court construing the act which was passed
after the obligation was incurred impairs
the obligation of the people of the district
and is in violation of the constitution of
the United States. By exempting nearly
one-third of the district from taxation it
materially increases the burden of the
remainder. Our contention is that the
people at the bond election incurred an
irrevocable conditional obligation by au
thorizing the board of directors- to con
tract ade bt of $800,000 and pledging all
their land, 108,000 acres, for its payment.
We understand that conditional obligation
is within the inhibition of the constitu
tional provision which denies the right of
a State to impair the obligation of the con
tract. The conditional obligation may
ripen into an absolute one by the affirm
ing of the judgment in this case."
Bond was followed . by A. L. Rhodes for
the bondholders.
Justice Field asked Rhodes many ques
tions in order to arrive at a thorough un
derstanding of the case. Rhodes finishes
his argument to-morrow and will be fol
lowed by General Harrison. George Max
well of San Francisco then argues against
the act. This will probably take up all of
the session.
The court adjourns over until Monday,
when Attorneys Wright, Choate and Dil
lon will deliver their arguments.

Anglo-American situation in the light of
the latest developments. 7
It does not adduce any new views, but
recognizes the efforts of "the Government
at Washington to bring about a peaceful
solution of the question. It sees much
significance in the anger of the jingoes at
their efforts.
It again contends that Lord Salisbury's
dispatch, far from refusing, made a specific
offer to arbitrate the Guiana boundary
dispute and declares it to be no secret that
the Prime Minister is quite prepared to
consider favorably any fair and frank sug
gestion modifying the details.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23.-A Sun
special from Washington says: . The state
ments so repeatedly made' during the past
few days to the effect that Secretary Olney
has been notified of the desire of the Eng
lish Government to recede from its atti
tude on the Venezuelan question, and that
it had found a means of gracefully backing
down, whether true or not. will have little
effect upon the determination of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee to pass
the Davis resolution. v - â¢
In the first place it cannot be learned
that Secretary Olney has received any
such intimation from the English Govern
ment, and the Senators say it would not
affect the action of the Senate if he had.
The members,' of the Foreign Relations
Committee say that the resolution was
framed chiefly for the purpose of meeting
the argument," so persistently {advanced,
that Congress had never given an expres
sion of opinion on the subject of the Mon
roe doctrine and that, therefore, it is high
time to put a declaration on record.
The resolution of the committee is a
concurrent one, requiring the indorsement
of the House of Representatives, but not
the approval of the President. It is in
tended merely as an expression of the
sense of Congress, not as a law to be placed
upon the statute-books. Its authors will,
therefore, press it to a vote whether or not
Lord Salisbury decides to suggest a
method for the settlement of the dispute
with Venezuela by arbitration or other
wise.
A World special from Washington, says:
President Cleveland has authorized Sena
tor Smith of New Jersey to make public
his opinion of the Davis resolution, re
ported by the Senate Commute on For
eign Relations. The President's opinion
is this: â  â  â  _ '/A/4'
"I regard the Davis resolution as mis
chievous, inopportune and unfortunate."
Cleveland believes the policy adopted
by the Senate committee" on strikes at the
heart of the principle of arbitration. Sen
ator Smith has prepared a resolution de
claring the United States does not intend
to establish a protectorate in South Amer
ica, nor to become responsible in any de
gree for the conduct of other American
nations. Hi. discussed the substance of
the resolution with the President yester
day.
Secretary Olney has privately expressed
his disapproval of the action of the Senate
committee.

NEW YORK, N. V.. Jan. 23.-Herman
Ahlwardt, member of the German Reich

anti-Hebrew crusade, opened his campaign
in Jersey City to-night' at Proessers Hall

Several Hebrews asked Chief of Police
Murphy to prevent Ahlwardt from speak

but the Chief said that he would not - in
terfere.
A strong police force under Inspector
Lange was present, however. Their ser
vices were needed, for the Hebrews in the
hall hooted A! ward whenever he referred
to their religion, and finally threatened to
kill him and burn down the hall.
Befora serious consequences . arose, how

Strong Advocacy of a Plan for a New

CHICAGO, 111., Jan. After a busy
session of four hours the National conven
tion of American manufacturers adjourned
sine die this afternoon. The next conven
tion will be held at Philadelphia at a dale
to be fixed by the executive committee.
The majority of the delegates seemed to
favor Nashville, but the nomination of
that city was withdrawn upon the repre
sentation that the prime necessity of inter
esting New England manufacturers could
best be met by holding the convention in
the Quaker City. President Dolan, who
was confined to his hotel by illness, sent
word to the committee on nominations
that he absolutely could not serve the asso
ciation another year, and thereupon Theo
dore C. Search, president of the John B.
Stetson Company of Philadelphia and
founder of tbe Philadelphia Textile
School, was chosen president for 1896.
Robert Laidlaw and E.P.Wilson of Cin
cinnati were re-elected treasurer and sec
retary respectively.
The fellowing, who were nominated for
vice-presidents by the delegations of their
respective States, will with the officers con
stitute the executive committee for the
coming year: Colorado, H. Li; Story; Con

Pennsylvania, John H. Converse; Oreeon,
L. D." Cole: Tennessee, C. D. Mitchell;
Wisconsin, E. W. Sivver.
A number of resolutions were reported
from the committee and adopted, some
without comment and others after brief
discussions. They were as follows:
Whereas, The merchants and manufactur
ers or the country are practically unanimous in
the opinion that a classification of freight
which would be uniform throughout the
United Slates would tend to simplify freight
rates and make them more uniform, just and
staple; and whereas, while this is acknowl
edged to be true by most of the carriers them
selves, the experience of the pest five years
shows that no relief in this direction can be
looked for from them since the adoption of such
a classification arranged by a large committee
of their ablest freightmen, representing all the
different interests, was defeated on account of
the jealousies of some of the leading carriers;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the National Association of
Manufacturers of America respectfully and
earnestly petition the Congress of the United
States to authorize and direct the Interstate
Commerce Commission to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, at the earliest possible time, a
classification of trade which shall be uniform
throughout the United States, and to be put
In effect January 1, 1897, on all the railroads
in the United States engaged in interstate com
merce. ''V-/~.
Wheeeas, One of the primary stated objects
of this association is the promotion of trade
relations with Spanish and Latin-American
Republics; and whereas, a strongly indorsed
movement has been looking to the establish
ment in the City of Mexico, with the co-opera
tion of the Mexican Government, of an Indus
trial Exposition, permanent or otherwise;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the president of this associa
tion be empowered to appoint a committee of
three to investigate the practicability of such
an exposition and to report its decision to the
executive committee at. d with this informa
tion in hand the executive committee shall
take final action regarding the matter.
Resolved, That if it is the sense of this con
vention that a department of manufactures be
established under a secretary of equal rank
with the Secretary of Agriculture, and that the
executive committee be instructed to take
such steps as may speedily accomplish the
object. zxA;
Whereas, Certain Slate laws impose upon
so-called foreign corporations, created by the
authority of other States, conditions some
times severe and often inequitable upon which
the said corporation may do business in the
States having such laws in operation.
Resolved, That the executive committee be
required to consider what action, if any,
should be taken to prevent such obstruction of
traffic business between the States of this
Union.
Whereas, The revenue of the Federal Gov
ernment is not sufficient to meet its necessary
and proper expenditures, therefore,
Resolved, By the National Association of
Manufacturers of the United States, In con
vention assembled, at Chicago, January 22,
1896, that the Senate of the United States
is earnestly requested to pass promptly and
send to the President the emergency revenue
bill which was adopted by the House of Repie
sentatives. ',".'_* 77/ â¢ ,
Upon the Mexican Exposition resolution
Senor Gonzales, special commissioner from
the Mexican Government, made- an ad
dress urging a stronger effort on the part
of the United States to build up trade with
Mexico.
By general consent H. L. Story of Cali
fornia submitted this resolution, which
was unanimously adopted: ,
That we but voice the agricultural sentiment
of the great West, and of the South as well,
when we insist that Congress treat domestic
sugar as it docs wool and all other agricultural
products, and we demand for the beet and cane
sugar industries fair legislation and liberal en
couragement.
- The â  committee on resolutions declined
to report upon the resolutions of sympa
thy with Cuba submitted by Delegate Bar
bour of Detroit, on the ground that the
manuscript declared that the ; war i had
ended, extolled the insurgent generals and
denounced the Spaniards in harsh terms.
Members of the Michigan delegation de
nied this and asked consent to reopen the
matter and have the resolutions ' read.
This request, upon being pot to a vote,
was rejected by a large majority.
Richard H. Edwards, editor of the Manu
facturers' Record of Baltimore, submitted
a strong argument in favor of a new Cabi
net position, to be designated as the De
partment of Manufacture and Commerce,
and after an address upon International
banks by Ulysses D. Eddy ' of ; New York
the convention adjourned. .

FOR RIVER IMPROVEMENT
Representative Barham Deeply
Interested in Streams ot

Provisions of a Bill Which Will Not
Conflict With Johnson's
Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.-Repre
sentative Barham said to The Call corre
spondent to-night: "Representative John
son's river bill is an excellent measure. It
does not go quite as far as I should like,
however, to improve navigation in my dis
trict and in some other parts of California.
Therefore I had a talk with Johnson, and
as a result have prepared- a bill which will
in no wise conflict with his measure, but
will be more satisfactory to my own con
stituents.
"It provides for the creation of a board,
to be known as the California Commission
(instead of the Sacramento River Commis
sion, as in Johnson's bill). It 13 to consist
of three members, to be appointed from
the corps of army engineers by the Presi
dent, to hold office four years. They shall
organize within thirty days after appoint
ment.. No additional compensation is to
be allowed the engineers. Their office
shall be in Sacramento. It shall be the
duty of the commission to prepare and
adopt such plan or plans i from examina
tions and surveys already made, and from
such additional examinations and surreys
as it may consider proper or necessary, as
will improve the navigability of all water
ways in the State of California and
deepen, straighten and dredge their chan
nels. The commission shall cause the
channels of said waterways to be cleared
and improved by removing sandbars, mud,
debris, and other obstructions to naviga
tion by the use of clamshell or other suit
able dredger. They shall remove all snags
and other obstructions from said water
ways and all trees- standing on banks
thereof, from the head of navigation of
such waterways to the mouths thereof,
that may be liable to fall into the same.
â¢ "They shall close up breaks or crevasses
which allow water to escape to the injury
of the navigability of such waterways.
They shall also build and erect other
structures or use any other means that
will improve the navigability of such
waterways and prevent injury thereto
from debris, washings from mines jor
otherwise, and they are hereby, authorized
to enter into such contracts for such ma
terials and work as may be necessary to
complete any plan or project that may be
adopted or approved of by said commis
sion for the improvement of said water
ways, to be paid for as appropriations
may from time to time be made by law,
not to exceed in the aggregate $500,000, ex
clusive of the amount herein and hereto
fore appropriated.
"Said commission shall.take such means
and shall build, construct or preserve such
works as may be necessary to make nav
igable all of said waterways. They may
consult with the Governor and Commis
sioner of Public Works of. California and
may use in and about the works construct
ed by said commission any sum of money
appropriated by the State of California

ever, as several of his most eminent party
associates were also similarly engaged at
about the same time. .-Senators PJatt, Ed

Halstead, who is paying a short visit to his

Immediately after breakfast he began
to arrange the : work on which he
cameâ an argument in the Supreme Court
upon the constitutionality of the Califor
nia irrigation laws. This done b_e paid a
visit of courtesy to the - White House.
He received his friends ail day.
He was very - cordial and seemingly
of great content. His private secre
tary, Mr. Tibbatt, received the callers
without ceremony,, and General Harrison
came out to meet them without passing
judgment upon their cards. There was in
short an evident determination to be pleas
ant with all comers. He has very modest
apartments on the third floor of the hotel
and there was already a littered writing
table in the reception-room with stacks- of
legal-looking papers.
Ex-Secretary of. State Foster came in
while the interview was in progress and
was greeted with a cheery, "How do you
do, Foster," . with an immediate following
inquiry, as . to the health of Mrs. Foster.
This is General Harrison's first appearance
in the irrigation case. It has progressed
through the Federal District Appelate
courts of California and comes here now
for a last hearing. . . T//77.'A?7'!-

Washington I than' I could j â  possibly have

expect to touch upon only several of the
well-defined points involved in the argu
ment, leaving the others to my associates.
I will leave Washington ' just as soon* as I
finish the work. Of course you do not
expect me to come here and engage in
political discussion. I come only as a
lawyer and in "accordance with a well
established rule of mine I cannot let any

never to discuss public matters off-hand.

CHICAGO WAS CUT OFF.
Residents of the Lake City Suf
fered Severely During 7
the Storm.
For a Time Ice and Snow Blocked
Telegraphic Wires in Many
Directions.
CHICAGO, III.; Jan. 23.â a while
this morning Chicago was completely cut
off from telegraphic communication with
other parts of the country. r A storm of
sleet and rain, which froze as it fell, began
early last night and. continued all night.
By morning wires were down in all direc
tions. East, south and southwest the
wreck of wires was particularly bad. To
the north the wires were open only as far
as Milwaukee., Â»
A number of small accidents, due to the
condition of the streets, have been re
ported, but few of them have been serious.
The worst so far was a railroad collision.
The eastbound mail train 'on the Lake
Shore was unable to stop at a crossing
near Sixteenth street and crashed into an
Erie freight, train.. No one was hurt, but
considerable damage was done to'" prop
erty. As telegraphic communication with
various places is resumed its was ; found
that the storm j was j very violent through
out this part of the country.
The Western Union Telegraph Company
reported the wires blockaded in nearly all
directions on account of the rain freezing
on the wires, in many cases breaking them
by the .burden of ice. The Postal Tele
graph Company reported trouble in a Jess
degree from the same ; cause. At 10:30
a. m. their wires were reopened', to New
York and communication with the East in
general was comparatively free. Warmer
rain and winds raised the blockade, which
was heaviest at 4 a. m.** ;Â« : ?>^'7f : hf/pA:I- iA>.
Lines between' Chicago, St. Louis, Pitts
burg and New York were down and South
western communication was almost com
pletely cutoff until nearly noon. The same
trouble extended west to Omaha,* arid was
not much improved by riieht on account
of a colder temperature. 1 In this city pe
destrians experienced much trouble ' arid
danger to life and limb on account of ice

DANIEL ON MONROE- DOCTRINE.
Adoption of a Report Changing the
Rules Relating to the Count
ing of a Quorum.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. After a
lot of routine 7 morning business in the
Senate to-day, Mills (D.) of Texas intro
duced a bill to repeal the act of July 14,
1870, to authorize the refunding of the Na
tional debt, and the act of January 14,
1875, of the resumption of specie pay
ment. He asked that: it be read a first
time to-day, and that it have its second
reading to-morrow, when he hoped to have
a vote upon it.
, Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin reported from
the judiciary committee to prevent -the
carrying of obscene literature and such
things; from one State or Territory into
another State or Territory. Placed on the
calendar. _.
Call (D.) of Florida offered a resolution,
which went over until to-morrow, for the
appointment of , a select committee to in
quire into the imprisonment of E. V. Debs
in connection with the railroad strike. |
Pugh endeavored to call up his resolu
tion declaring ail Government obligations
payable in . silver, but was surprised to
learn that it had gone to the calendar and
declared that he had been "trapped" by
the skillful Senator from New York (Hill).
The resolution heretofore offered by
Warren (R.) of Wyoming, directing the
attention - of the Committee on Agricul
ture to the late unprecedented shrinkage
in * numbers and values of farm animals
throughout the United States, was taken
up and Warren addressed the Senate.
His speech was an argument in favor of
high protective duties, denouncing; the
Wilson tariff bill as "an emblem of benefi
cence to foreign interests and of disaster
to our own." He denied the claim made
in the recent speech of Vest (D.) of Mis
souri that the wool growing and the woolen
manufacturing interests had alike profited
under the Wilson bill.
The House bond bill with the free coin
age substitute was taken up at.2 .p . m.,
and 'Dubois (R.) of Idaho, addressed the
Senate in favor of the unlimited coinage
of gold and silver and such protection to
"raw materials" and the manufactured
products of the United States as would
prevent the ruinous * competition of the
poorly paid labor of foreign countries. He
believed emphatically in silver and protec
tion, and both were absolutely essential to
the prosperity and happiness of the people
of the United States.
At the close of Dubois' speech the bond
bill ; was laid aside and the [ resolution
offered by Sewell (R.) of New Jersey, in
relation to the Monroe doctrine, was laid
before the Senate, Daniel (D.) of Virginia
taking the floor to speak upon it. Daniel,
in the course of his speech, said:
Great Britain could least fitly of all
nations of, the earth object to the assertion
of the Monroe doctrine by the United
States, as it had been announced not
merely with the approval of the British
Minister of Foreign Affairs, â but at his
earnest and oft-repeated solicitation. And
with no better grace could Great Britain
persist in repelling the manifold overtures
made to her ) for arbitration. ' The refusal
of Great Britain to arbitrate a question
nominally one of boundary between British
Guiana and the republic of Venezuela, in
volving many thousand square miles of
territory, ..had led to the controversy
between the British Government and the
United States.
In that correspondence the United States
Government had stood \ for and recom
mended arbitration, but Great Britain has
stood out against it and repelled it. To
all such appeals Great Britain has turned
a deaf ear. The responsibility of the first
Wrong was fixed on Great Britain, and
Congress and the administration stood out
in their appropriate altitude as friends of
justice and friends of peace. ~ '7- >t '.
"This nation," Daniel declared, "cannot
recede from the Monroe doctrine or from
the position ; taken by the President. j All
critics, all friends .of peace, should recog
nize this fact and take their reckoning. It
is not to be expected- of us to speak in
whispers or to start at shadows while the
corridors of the Capitol are ringing with
invectives leveled 4 against those who do
not applaud the aggrandizing spirit of
Great Britain." :â  -y-y . --â¢â¢.

tained by actual count by the Speaker,
and if the House adjourn all proceedings
under this section shall be vacated. But
this section of the rule shall not apply to
the sessions of Friday night until further
orders by the House.
Along discussion followed Henderson's
explanation of the rules. -pp%
Miles (D.) of r Maryland offered an
amendment providing that the result of a
pending proposition shall be decided by
the votes of a majority 'of those members
present. The debate was continued by
Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania and Gibson
(R.) of Tennessee and concluded by Dal
zell (R.) of Pennsylvania, all supporting
the amendment, which was agreed to
after Miles' amendment had been rejected.
Walker (R.) of Massachusetts proposed
an amendment giving to members oldest
in the service the first right to draw for
seats at the beginning of the session. It
wap lost.
Crisp (D.) of Georgia moved to substi
tute for the code of rules the rules of the
Fifty-third Congress. Pending action on
this motion Dolliver (R.) of lowa made a
humorous, semi-sarcastic speech, con
gratulating the House and the country
upon the fact that even the Democratic
was consenting to a return of a reign of
reason in the conduct of affairs.
The events of to-day, he said, demon
strated that the Democratic party knew a
good thing when they had seen it long
enough. ' /
A These remarks drew from Crisp (D.) of
Georgia an earnest defense of the action of
the Democratic members in the Fifty-first
Congress in protesting against what they
deemed then, and which he still deemed, a
revolutionary proceeding on the part of
the Speaker at that * time. * He closed by
reminding Dolliver: that the rule of the
Fifty-third Congress giving the Committee
on Rules the right to report at any time,
which had formed the subject of a part of
Dolliver's remarks, bad been adopted word
for word by the Committee on Rules and
agreed to by the House. "I merely men
tion this," he said, "so that when the
gentleman again assumes to make a speech
he shall base it upon facts and not expose
his ignorance." <7*' A?
Dolliver explained that he had not in
tended when he took the floor to say any
thing that should disturb the serenity of
the Democrats and if any word of his had
tended to do so he regretted his utterance.
He could only account for it. he said, by
the nervous irritation caused by the indul
gence of an afternoon of constitutional
debate. [Laughter.]
Crisp's substitute was rejected and the
rules reported adopted. '
A resolution was agreed to authorizing
the printing of 2000 copies of the digest
and rules of the House.
Speaker Reed announced that Payne (R.)
of New York would act as Speaker pro
tern. at the Friday night session and unani
mous consent was given that at that ses
sion appropriation bills might be reported
for printing only. *"*'"'*""' "

CITED FOR CONTEMPT.
The Award of an Advertising
Contract Caused the
Trouble.
A NEW PAPER GOT THE WORK
Fighting Was Then the Order of the
Day Among the Other News
Sheets.
SAN BERNARDINO; Cal., Jan. 23.â At
the present time the San Bernardino City
Council is in what might be termed hot
water, and all because they have seen fit
to defy the Superior Court.
The cause of all the trouble is the award
ing of contracts for city advertising and
publishing the _, delinquent taxlist. The
bidders were the Sun, ihe Times-Index,
the Weekly Review and the Free Press,
the latter a little weekly paper started
about, three weeks ago. and which got in
the lowest bid, by several cents lower than
any of the others^ .
The managers of the other papers pro
tested against the Free Press getting the
work, and to prevent the Trustees from
awarding the contract they went before j
Judge Campbell aud asked that an injunc
tion be issued forbidding the Council to
act. . ' : ' >
Last evening notice was served on the
Council warning them that an injunction
would be issued. They met immediately
after and awarded the contract to the Free
Press. When this was made known war
was declared by the other papers, and this
morning the injunction itself was served, '
but was met with cool defiance by the
Council, as they had already let the con
tract.
But toward evening the fun passed
away, as Judge Campbell issued an order
citing the members to appear in court
Saturday morning to show cause why they
should not be punished for contempt of
court.
Attorneys are divided as to the con
tempt proceedings, some claiming that the
injunction proper was served too late,
while others claim that the notice served
first foretelling an injunction was suf
ficient, and that the Trustees are in con
tempt in the fullest sense of the word. An
exciting time is looked for next Saturday.

GOVERNOR RYERSON DEAD.
Passed Away in San Diego Yes
terday After an Eventful.
Career.
His Life Full of Excitement,' War,
Romance and Affairs of
State.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 23. â George
Ryerson, late Governor of Lower Cali
; fornia and an. occasional resident of San
: Diego since 1852, died in this city this
: morning. He had been suffering for sev
j eral years from Bright's disease. ( 7
Governor Ryerson was born in St. Louis,
| Mo.. March 10, 1852, and went to Chi
huahua, Mexico, when he was 18 years of
j age. There his love for adventure and
strange and exciting experiences was
, gratified, for he found himself surrounded
'â  by as desperate a lot of men as are often
| gathered together. He remained there â 
two years and came to San Diego in the
fall of 1852 with a large drove of sheep,
brought clear through from Chihuahua.
In 1859 he married Guadaloupe Serrano, '
who, with her brother, owned three square i
leagues of land in the Vallecitos Valley j
and large herds of cattle and sheep. Ryer- I
i son became a Mexican citizen and re- !
mained so until his death. In the early !
'60'?, wh.n the late War of the Rebellion j
was on, ne caught the fever and left for j
New Orleans, where he joined the South- I
crn army and soon became colonel of a i
regiment. He remained to the end of the i
war, his wife in the meantime not know- i
ing anything at all of his whereabouts. i
She finally heard he was dead and married
again. y/'-//;:
With her husband she lived part of the ;
time at her home in Vallecitos and part of
the time near San Bernardino. One night j
six or seven years after his departure, the i
little side-wheel steamer from San Fran- j
Cisco put into San Diego Bay and the next
morning George Ryerson appeared in his
old familiar haunts. Later he proceeded
to Vallecitos, rejoined his wife and re- !
sumed charge of the property there, the
second husband having previously de
parted.
* He then settled down to serious busi- j
ness and become a progressive and pros- i
perous farmer. . His extensive knowledge
of the country, its peculiarities, and his
success in dealing with the Mexicans was
a sufficient reason for the Mexican Presi
dent appointing him Sub-Prefect of the
northern portion of Lower California, the
Governor residing at La Paz. . .
He was also elected' President of the
municipality of Ensenada, which in
cludes the entire territory of the northern
half of the peninsula.
Certain it is that George Ryerson made j
a successful and popular excecutive and i
he held the office until 1887, when Luis
Torres was appointed his successor. Gov- i
ernor Ryerson was a natural leader among i
men. He had perhaps the best knowledge â 
of Mexican law, customs and the people I
of any man on the peninsula. His former !
estate gradually passed from him and he j
died comparatively poor. *

patch to-day reports that the town of
Willows, Glenn County, was startled last
evening by hearing three pistol shots in j
rapid succession.
On investigation it was learned the shots
were fired by Mrs. Emma Longmire to

that last evening about half-past 7 Long
mire, from whom she was recently di
vorced, went to her house on the out
skirts of the town, where she lived with
her two children, and demanded admit
tance, and when she refused he threatened
to kill her and the children and attempted
to break down the door of the house. â 
Being in mortal fear of the man, she
fired the shots ,to frighten him away.
Persons who â  went to the /house imme
diately after the shooting, say that Long
mire was standing near the curbing apply
ing the vilest kind of epithets to Mm.'
Longmire and her children. An effort will
be made to have him placed under bonds

ROBBERY OF A WIDOW.
A Detective Cheats Her Out of Her Hus
band's Life Insurance.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jam 23.-It de
veloped to-day in the case jf Myers vs.
the Life Association of Minneapolis, which
is now on trial in Department 4 of the
Superior Court, that when Mr. Myers died
the physician here advised the company
not to pay the policy until it could be in
vestigated. ,
Detective A. B. Lawson offered the com
pany to settle the business for $2000. The
theory was that the policies had been
fraudulently obtained by the deceased
representing himself as being healthy
when he was in fact afflicted with kidney
trouble. ' , - ._,.. r, _
Lawson gave the company a bond to save '
them from paying an v more, the !
policies amounting to $6000. He got the
$2000, and by frightening the widow got
her to accept $100 and give up the policies.
She now claims that "she was weak and
nervous and was taken advantage of.

A LOS ANGELES FAILURE.
Broadway Department Store Attached by
Several Creditors Yesterday.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 23.â
Broadway Department store was attached
this morning and a keeper placed in
charge. â '."â ' y'T
The firm of L. Dinkelspiel & Son, of San
Francisco, placed the attachment for a
small debt, but late this afternoon other
attachments were placed by the attorneys
of the Los Angeles Board of Trane.
Williams & Co., the proprietors, assert
that the failure is not a bad one, and that
their : creditors will get every dollar due.
It has been suspected for several weeks
past that the failure would take place, as
the firm had failed in many instances to '
meet its obligations.
The store is a big one, but, while includ
ing- many departments, was never fully
stocked. The owners came here last fall,
and the store has only had an existence of
about four months.

THE CODE COMMISSION
Assemblyman Hatfield Says It
Has Accomplished but
Little.
Its Members and Those of the Railroad
Commission Are Roundly
Criticized. /p.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 23.â There
i"* a general provision which requires State
officials and commissions to establish their
headquarters at the State Capitol, and
when the original bill creating the Code
Commission was presented to the late
Legislature Assemblyman Hatfield, intro
duced an amendment to the bill which
distinctly provided that the commission
shall hold its meetings in a room in the
Capitol building, to be furnished by the
Secretary of State.
Now, as a matter of fact, the Code Com
mission has not met in this city since the
summer of last year; on the contrary, it
has been sojourning in San Francisco.
Assemblyman L. T. Hatfield, an attorney
of Sacramento, proposes to see that this
commission, appointed for the revision
and re-form of tbe .'aw, shall comply with
the law, j and if there is . any meaning in
the English language then the amendment
to the act creating the Code Commission
means that it should meet in this city.
Despite this amendment the members
persist in holding their meetings in San
Francisco, wh ere they have been for
months. Hatfield further claims that he
believes that the commission has accom
plished little if anything in the year in
which it has held office. Hatfield said :
. '.'Judge Daly has been assisting in the
Railroad Commission case for several
months. Judge Baldwin of Stockton has
been sick for over a month, and unable to
attend to his duties in San Francisco.
The commission is surrounded by politi
cal and other interests which tend to de
tract from the attention which it should
bestow on tne duties of its office. Each
Commissioner gets $4000 per year, being
the same salary as that paid to a Superior
Judge, and it was unquestionably the in
tention of the Legislature that they should
give their entire time to the work for
which the commission was created.
"The expense of maintaining'this com
mission is over $16,000 per year for salaries
alone. When this bill was introduced
into the Legislature it was a pet bill with
all the attorneys throughout the State
and great things were expected of it, but
unless there is a change between now and
the meeting of the next Legislature the
prospects are that the commission will be
abolished owing to the fact that the work
done has not been commensurate in any
sense with the amount expended. ;
â¢ "The claim of the Commissioners that
they want to be in San Francisco in order
to be in close contact with the attorneys
of the State is the rankest nonsense, for
they certainly must realize that their time
is too valuable to listen to personal argu
ments from attorneys, and that in order to
expedite their work all suggestions should
be mailed to the commission in brief, and
these could' be received fully as well in
Sacramento as in San Francisco."
This was one of the last bills that Gov
ernor Budd signed, and he hesitated long
before signing, fearing that it might be the
creating of a useless commission at a time
when California was more heavily taxed
than any other State in the, Union. It is
said by those who are intimate with the
Governor that this commission has been
one of his - sorest trials. He fears that
through lack of application it will not ac
complish what the people expect, and it is
further rumored that he has demanded
that they come to Sacramento and go to
work.
Governor Budd himself states that he is
so interested in the result of this commis
sion's work that he has accepted the vol
untary offer of his own father, Hon. Judge
Budd of Stockton, who has agreed to de
vote every spare moment of time to assist
ing the Commissioners in the revision of
the codes. .'--'â¢' - ' "'â  4', ' ' r

DEMAND OF THE
ALASKA INDIANS
They Want a White Man
Hanged as a Just
Retribution.

WORK OF PORTLAND ROBBERS.
They Held an Old Man Up in the Day
time and Took His Watch
and Money.
â  . !
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 23. â Horace
Stevens, just, from Alaska, says: "The
action of the Killisnoo Indians in sending
a delegation to Governor Sheakley at
Sitka, demanding the immediate execution
of a man named Mills, charged with the
murder of one of their tribe, is but a result
of the summary treatment accorded them
by this Government during the witchcraft
troubles some years ago. when Commander
Merrimnn with the United States steam
ship Adams landed a force of men and
rounded up the tribe and then treated
them to the sight of their village being
bombarded and their canoes torn into
splinters with Gatiing missiles.
P At the time the lesson was a needed one,
the Killisnoos having caused great trouble
and anxiety among the whites by their
insistence in continuing the barbarous
rites of their religion, if so it may be called,
of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
If a man fell sick some witch must have
caused his illness, and the medicine man
was just as likely to pick out a white
employe of the Northwest Trading Com
pany as being the sorcerer as to select an
Indian.
On tbe occasion of the Adams guns be
ing turned on the village the Killisnoos
had acted in a more than usual high
handed manner. A Siwash had been
killed by the premature discharge of a
bomb in the company's whaleboat, for
which the Indians demanded the life of a
white man. There was an epidemic of
typhoid fever among them which, as it at
tacked one after another of the tribe, they
concluded must come from the whites,
and the salmon were late in running,
which fact they laid to the workings of
the trading company's pile-driver, claim
ing the shock as the hammer fell was car
ried along the bottom of the channel to
the king salmon, who he warned and
turned the fish into some other bay.
The cure for all these troubles, accord
ing to their light, was the securing for
torture and ultimate death of a white. A
big medicine potlash was held and a young
lad .working on the company's steamer
was decided to be the witch. Plans for his
capture were at once laid, but through the
talkativeness of a squaw, living with a
white man, for the time being failed, and
suddenly the lad disappeared.
NEWS OF SANTA BARBARA
Jerry Bruggy Convicted of an
Assault to Murder
_-...â ., â 'â -':

The Philadelphia Returned to Port,
but the Monterey Did Not
Materialize.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 23.â
Jerry Bruggy, who has been on trial on
the charge of attempt to murder preferred
by Judge Thomas Henley of Santa Maria,
was to-day convicted by a jury in the Su
perior Court.
Although a number of witnesses came
down from the northern part of the county
to testify in the case, including the old
gentleman who had so narrow an escape
from death at the hands of the prisoner,
the * trial was rushed through with dis
patch, being given to the jury at sunset
and decided within half an hour.
It was Bruggy's intention to argue his
own case, but as the time for the trial
approached his forensic couraged weak
ened and ex-District Attorney Putnam
undertook the defense. Perhaps the most
curious feature of the case is that not-,
withstanding the months in which Bruggy
has lain in the County Jail and the con
viction of the officers that he is an old
criminal, it has been impossible to ascer
tain his previous record or to learn any
thing whatever concerning his life prior to
his coming to this county. .-:. ..;...- v
WOODLAND PERJURERS FREED.
Cases Not to Be Tried on Account of a
Saving of Expense.
WOODLAND, Cal., Jan. 23. â Rather
than subject the county to the expense of
trying the cases the authorities have de
cided not to prosecute for perjury George
A. and Matthew Miller, two of the princi
pal witnesses for the defense in the case of
Stuart, convicted ,of robbing Postmaster
Morrin of Rumsey. â â â â ;,-.-
The jury that found the robbers guilty
practically decided that the two men men
tioned had sworn falsely. The authorities
believe that the Millers, who live in Colusa
County, will not again inflict their \ pres
ence upon Yolo County, and while it is
not desired: to foster .the too prevalent
crime of perjury, it is argued that it is not
incumbent upon Yolo County to pose as a
moral monitor for her neighbors. -.:
However, it is. possible that the matter
may be called to the , attention of the

their arrest. These men, though, are not

Inspector Flint arrived here this morning
to investigate a theft and forgery of a

another charge under the alias of Smith.
He with Gyle and Harp were examined
before Commissioner Maude this after
noon, and were held for trial. The evi
dence was very direct and convincing.
They will be taken to Los Angeles for
trial. It developed that Gyle stole the
order and forged the signature, then gave
it to Harp, who "blew it in" in a dive for
wine with a waiter girl. Gyle never got a
cent or even a drink out of the steal.
MORE OIL IN SAN DIEGO
Promising Indications on the
Mesa Twelve Miles From
the City.
Company of Denver Capitalists Or
ganized lo Operate Copper Mines
and Oil Wells.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Jan. 23.â Indications
of heavy oil strata have been found on
the Otay Mesa, twelve miles from this
I city, on the Mexican boundary, and a com
pany is now being formed to place ma
chinery and prospect on a large scale.
Deposits of mineral paint have been
found which are so strongly impregnated
with oil that the stuff will burn. Otay
Mesa is six or eight miles long by three
wide and is several hundred feet above the
valley. Geologists say that the surround
ings and the character of the ground give
every indication of an abundance of oil at
no great depth. "- ''*7 p:
Operations are continued at Point Loma
without abatement and the drill is now
down over 400 feet. The company ex
pects to find oil at 900 feet, though some
irregularities in the strata have discon
certed the geologists.
Boring is also going on aiDelmar, where
oil was accidentally found by a rancher
digging a well. The oil was so strong that
the well was useless for water and it was
continued as an oil well. The oil stream
is supposed to be the same as that under
Point Loma and a continuance of that of
Los Angeles.
Tbe iron and copper country in the
vicinity of San Isidro, Lower California,
has been found to be promising in oil and
the Woods Investment Company of Den
ver is said to be about to prospect for it.
A member of the company is expected to
arrive to-morrow from the City of Mexico,
where he went to secure concessions from
the Mexican Government for erecting
smelters at San Isidro and San Fernando
for the handling of copper ores.
The company has acquired the largest
copper mines on the peninsula outside of
Santa Rosalia, and a large amount of
money is about to be invested. A schooner
is now off that coast gathering a cargo -of
copper ore to be taken to San Francisco.

THE LATE NEWS
OF SAN JOSE
Absconding Contractor M.
Clinton Is Now Very-
Repentant.
SAYS HE WAS GOING BACK
All but About Seven Hundred
Dollars He Took Was
Recovered.
A BASEBALL PLAYER'S PLIGHT.
Kchn, Who Swindled the Russ House
on a Forged Check, Is in
â¢ Custody.
SAN JOSE, Cai... Jan. 23.â Menzo Clin
ton, the absconding contractor who left
this city five weeks ago with some $3000
belonging to a number of sub-contractors,
and who was arrested in San Francisco
last evening by Sheriff Lyndon on a charge
of felony-embezzlement, was brought back
to this city this morning and lodged in
the County Jail.
It seems likely that Clinton will make a
satisfactory settlement with his bonds
men, as it is not believed he could be con
victed of embezzlement, as in appropri-
ating the money to his own use it was
simply a breach of trust.
Clinton said to-day that be was thor
oughly repentant and was on his way to
San Jose to settle up when arrested.
When arrested Clinton had $2259 in his
possession, winch was taken charge of by
Sheriff Lyndon. At noon to-day J. J.
Cherrie, one of Clinton's bondsmen, began
an attachment suit against Clinton, and
the money in the Sheriff's hands was lev
ied upon. He alleges in his complaint
that the defendant became indebted to his
firm in the sum of Â§2665, the amount of
their liability on the bond of David Jacks,
the owner of the building which Clinton
was erecting when he left. An attachment
was served on the $2259 in the hands of the
Sheriff.
W. A. Bowden, attorney for Clinton,
said this afternoon that he had practically
arranged a settlement that was satisfactory
to all. He said Clinton ordered the Sheriff
to pay $2259 to Cherrie & Co., his bonds
men, and when this was done Mr. Cherrie
would have the complaint dismissed.
Late yesterday aiternoon Clinton was
examined before Justice Cass on the charge
of felony embezzlement.
J. J. Cherry, who swore to the complaint
which caused a warrant to be issued for
Clinton's arrest on the charge of embezzle
ment, was the only witness examined. He
testified as to his connection with the ac
cused and to the payment of $2500 on the
contract by Clayton & Co. for David Jacks,
which should have been applied to the
payment of sub-contractors and for
material, but stated that Clinton had em
bezzled no money from him. After hear
ing this testimony it was apparent that
there was no evidence to convict on the
charge, and the District Attorney moved
that the complaint be dismissed, which
was granted by the Justice.

A VICTIM OF MORPHINE.
Garcia, the Baseball Player, Is Losing
His Mind.
SAN JOSE, Cal,. Jan. 23. Andreas
Garcia, an old-time baseball player, who
is confined in the branch jail on the Bol
linger road, is rapidly losing his mind,
and in all probability he will be brought
into the County Jail and examined as to
his sanity. Garcia is a morphine fiend,
and at his own solicitation was given a
six months' term for vagrancy in the
hopes that he could break away from the
habit. For the past four days Garcia has
imagined that his fellow-prisoners are
crazy, and that he is a physician who can
cure them.
Garcia was one of the finest baseball
players on coast about four years ago. He
was a pitcher who attracted the attention
of many baseball managers and they made
him some flattering offers. Garcia, how
ever, was then keeping bad company and
soon degenerated from bad to worse. The
craving appetite for morphine got a strong
hold on him and he soon became a slave.

swore on the recent trial had been given
him by John Brown, a roustabout at Ba
den, it now being charged that Potter paid
this money to Mrs. Sadie Young, the pro
prietress at that time of a house at 205

QUEER HONDO ISLANDERS
: â 
Had Never Seen a Caucasian and
ij Viewed Miss Suthon With
Surprise.
DIFFICULT MISSIONARY WORK
Miss Suthon's Story of a Strange
Murder in Her House Which Yet
Remains a Mystery.
Miss G. Suthon, who for seventy ears past
has been engaged in missionary work on
the curious out of the '". way island of
Hondo, belonging to Japan, and situated
500 miles from Tokio, is in the City.
Miss Suthon is from New Orleans and is
of the American Episcopal Missionary So
ciety. _. --V â  j ; ;
bhe was the first foreigner who was ever
in this queer island, and was the only
European there for two years afterward.
Even now there are almost no Europeans
in that part of the Mikado's realm.
The lady says that when she went there
and for months afterward the natives in
spected her ' with wide-eyed wonder, as
though she were some strange being who
had dropped from the clouds. The chil
dren threw snowballs at her a good deal at
first, for it snows to a great depth there,
but otherwise she was not disturbed. . â  ;
She was living and doing mission work
in the town of Aomo, of 25,000 inhabitants,
at the extreme northern part of the island,
where there is a fine harbor and a military
station. At the station are about 3000
soldiers. â¢ â *" 'â â¢. ..;: y/p\y/.
One day, so she tells, one of the princes
of the blood royal came up to take com
mand of the troops. There was an enor
mous crowd to greet the prince, and she
Miss Suthon.
went forth with one or two of her newly
acquired Japanese friends, not thinking
much about anything, but expecting to
see the prince. She got into the crowd,
but soon became cognizant tnat she was
the observed of all observers. *'"'-".?
The sensation which the prince was ex
pected to cause was nothing compared
with that which the lone missionary cre
ated among the little brown islanders.
They manifested j their astonishment in
many strange ways, and the situation be
came very embarrassing. She was finally
enabled to get back to her home, a great
crowd following meanwhile, however, and
once there the lady locked and barred her
door and did not venture forth again ex
cept for short distances for a long while.
The country about Aomo on the island
is half wild, though in general it is pretty
thickly settled, Miss Sufhon says. Back
from the bay are large areas of rice lands,
and back of these the country is rugged.
"The bay and rivers fairly swarm with
fish," said she. "They are the finest fish
in all Japan. Many of them are much like
our trout in this country. Among the
fine fish is tbe tai, which is in taste very
much like the mountain trout.
"The province of Mutsu, of which the
island of Hondo is a part, has nearly 12,
--000,000 people.
"As for the people of Hondo they are
less educated and less modern, so far as
civilization is concerned, than those of any
other part of Japan. The railroad was
only completed there four years ago.
"There are no modern inventions used
there of any kind. You see almost noth
ing to remind you of America. However,
a company has lately been organized to
put an electric-light plant in the town of
Aomo.
"1 had a remarkable experience befall
me in this town last September which
caused my friends a good deal of anxiety.
"A Japanese student was murdered In
my house one night, and no one knew who
did it, and it has never yet been found out.
It was done with a sword, the man being
killed while he lay asleep in bed.
"I slept upstairs and the Japanese be
low; and there was ; nobody else in the
house except the cook and his wife.

THREE SHOOTING SCRAPES
One Man Killed and Three
Wounded at an Early Hour
This Morning.
Deadly Encounter at a Feast in
Chinatown Gave Bullets
7/7: for a Drink.
" There was an epidemic of shooting
scrapes this morning. After midnight
there were three deadly encounters, in
which one Chinaman was killed, and two
white men and one Chinaman wounded.
J. Herveau and Albert Calm were hav
ing a quiet talk in the saloon at 2208 Sut
ter street, when a stranger entered and
demanded a drink.
Herveau, the barkeeper, refused, and the
intruder pulled a pistol. Calm seized the
weapon, when it was discharged, the ball
going through the calf of Calm's left leg. â 
The man then shot Herveau, the bullet
penetrating the left side of the abdomen
and passing out at the back.
The wounded men were taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where they were
treated by Dr. Fitzgibbous. Both will
recover. ".<>*.>_
There was a Chinese feast at 4 Bartlett
alley at 2 o'clock thi3 morning, at which
Lee : Ah Wong and another Chinaman en
gaged in a quarrel, and both were shot.
W ong's left knee was shattered, but he
will recover. The other man, whose name
is unknown, was fatally wounded: He died
an hour later at the Receiving Hospital.
How They Love Us I
Englishmen admire Americans; they
have for many years invested much of
their saving in American enterprises.
They always listen with incredulity when
they hear how the Yankee dislikes
the Britisher. They do not under
stand this feeling. They have only
met the traveled American; they do not
know the native Chicagoan, the ignorant
Westerners or the spiteful Southerners.
Yet these exist, and they form the major
ity. It is this that lends a serious aspect
to a situation that would otherwise be
simply grotesque. England would never
go to war over Venezuela. But the Ameri
can rabble may force us to defend our
selves, in which case it will possibly be
bad for the American rabble. They have
little enough money nowâ tbey will have
less when we have finished with them.â

GIVES ANSWER
San Francisco and North
Pacific Affairs Are
Elucidated.
VOTING POWER OF STOCK
If President Foster Is Defeated
a Consolidation May
Follow
WITH NORTH PACIFIC COAST.
Defendant Says He Never Entered
Into a Compact With Foster
and Markham.
Sidney V. Smith, who is a defendant in
a suit brought by A. W. Foster, president
of the .-'an Francisco and North Pacific
Railway, and others, growing out of the
attempted consolidation of that railway
with the North Pacific Coast road, filed
his answer yesterday in the Superior Court
of Marin County.
In his answer Mr. Smith is joined by
other defendants, all having the same
cause. He denies the various allegations
of the plaintiffs, and in presenting his side
gives an interesting view of private affairs
of both railroad companies. The docu
ment begins abruptly with the statement
that the narrow-gauge line does not now
earn or lias ever earned its fixed charges;
that earnings of that line south of San
Anselmo are confined chiefly to forest
products.; that the greater portion of its
revenue had been derived from stumpage
or from freight on forest products from
land owned by the company; that the
freight revenue hereafter to be derived
from the line north of San Anselmo will
not be sufficient to pay expenses of opera
tion, and in many other particulars he
claims that the narrow-gauge road is not
the unprofitable property that Mr. Foster
and his friends would have it appear.
It is also denied that the defendant on
or before February, 1603, or ever, was de
sirous of organizing a syndicate to pur
<. i.a.- 42,000 shares of the stock of the
Donahue road, or that he had requested
the plaintiffs and the late Mr. Hitcncock
to join with him in this purchase from the
executors of the late James M. Donahue's
estate; and, furthermore, that the defend
ant had endeavored to have these 42,000
shares voted as a unit during five years
after date of making the agreement,
whereby Smith and his friends would con
trol the Donahue line. Smith also denies
that he and Foster on behalf of themselves
and other members of the alleged syndi
cate had ever made a bid in writing to buy
the 12,000 shares for (800,000 in the Supe
rior Court of Marin County. He repudi
ates the claim that the plaintiffs confided
to him as an attorney-at-law the prepara
tion of this agreement or the adoption of
such or any legal measures as would fulfill
.the preliminary or any agreements or
promises stated in the complaint relative
to the voting of these shares, or that as an
attorney he ever assumed th* duty of pre
paring spell agreement or adopting the
legal measures stated In complaint.
Mr. Smith adds that the plaintiffs, Mark
ham, Overton and Hitchcock, did seek the
advice of protection of other counsel. He
denies that they, afterforming a syndicate
of their own, have lived up to the terms of
their agreeefnent; that the management
of the directors of the Donahue road has
been very successful or prosperous in its
business, and that the earnings of the
road have been largely increased by them.
On the contrary, he "shows that the earn
ings of the broad-gauge line have fallen
off, and that the net earnings for the year
ending June 30, 1596, will be $30,000,
whereas for the year ending June 30, 1893,
they were $61,745 17.
Mr. Smith admits that he is under pe
cuniary obligations to Antoine Borel, the
banker, and a stockholder of the narrow
gauge road, but denies the insinuation of
plaintiffs, that his relations to Borel have
in any way induced him to do any of the
acts charged against him, and he denies
that his intention to vote his stock with
Borel and his associates, owners of the
North Pacific Coast Railway, at the next
annual meeting of the other line, is so that
the Donahue road shall be operated in the
interests of the narrow-gauge road, or in
view of a consolidation intended by him
(Smith) or the stockholders of the narrow
gauge line.
The statements of a scheme whereby the
broad-gauge property would be injured
through connivance with the rival road
are denied in detail and at great length.
Continuing, Mr. Smith avers that he never
sought to form a combination before the
sale of the Donahue stocK and that the
sale was not made to a syndicate other
than Foster and Markham. After the sale
Foster asked the defendant (Smith) to
draw a pooling agreement for this stock,
and was told that it was not possible to
make such a compact legal and binding;
but on Foster insisting Smith did draft
the pooling agreement and signed it March
22, 1893. This document Smith claims was
merely a, mutual promise.
It is set forth that the rival roads can be
made to pay handsomely by a combination
of the management, because in that way
great savings could be effected. As mat
ters have stood for some time distrust has
been engendered among the stockholders,
it being averred that Foster has been sus
picious of Markham, and Markham of
Foster, each that the other might sell out
his stock to parties owning 18,000
shares. And therefore Smith, himself,
had valid reasons for becoming alarmed,
and under these conditions he was and is
justified in morals, as well as in Jaw, in re
tiring from the pooling agreement, since
that compact has lost whatever cohesive
quality it ever had based on mutual con
sideration. He goes on to say that he un
derstands tbat Markham and Foster in
tend to vote his stock, claiming the right
to do so through the agreement being in
effect a power of attorney and proxy to
vote the stock, and that unless restrained
by the court they will vote his stock, with
the result that a board inimical to Smith's
interests will be elected. In conclusion he
a sic
Wherefore this defendant prays the judg
ment of this court that the agreement of March
22, 1893, is and always was void and invalid;
that the plaintiffs, Foster and Markham, be
decreed to give up the same to be canceled;
that the restraining order heretofore made
herein preventing this defendant from voting
his stock be vacated and set aside; that the
prayer of said complaint for an injunction
against this defendant and the defendant cor
poration be denied, that the writ of injunction
of this court issue herein restraining the
plaintiffs, Foster and Markham, from voting or
attempting to vote this defendant's stock.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
"Will Organize a Building Trades Coun
cilâ Cooper*' Strike Has
Been Settled.
The Building Trades Council, a project
that has been under continuation for sev
eral months, will soon be a reality. Thurs
day evening, February 6, it will be organ
ized for the mutual benefit and protection
of ail members connected with the build
ing trades. The movement was started by
tne carpenters six months ago, and invita- ;
tions were sent to the plumbers', stone-'
cutters', lathers', painters', brickraasons'
and similar unions to join in the work of
forming a central council. Nearly all re
ponded and sent delegates, and nearly
every delegate declared in favor of the
movement. It was also generally consid
ered advisable to find a suitable building
to be used as a headquarters.
Last evening the general committee met
and several of the active workers reported
having sent to several building trades
councils in the Eastern cities for their
plans of organization. All of those pres
ent, and the meeting was well attended,
decided that it would be the best to organ
ize, and without further delay.
So far the four carpenters' and joiners'
unions, the sandstone cutters, plasterers,
cornice-workers and painters have declared
in favor of a central council. It is be
lieved that the other unions of the build
ing trades will fall into line as soon as
they see the project fairly started. At any
rate the unions mentioned decided to go
ahead and form a building trades council.
Notice will be sent out at once to all
unions in this line to send their delegates
to the meeting that will be held on Febru
ary 6, and it was announced that if not
over four unions be represented they will
organize and draw the others in as oppor
tunities present themselves.
During* the discussion the question was
raised whether or not the Ironmolders'
Union is entitled to a representation in
the Building Trades Council, most of
the niolders' work being that of making
machinery and heavy castings. It was
decided that as the ironmolders construct
a large amount of ironwork for buildings
that union is clearly entitled to be repre
sented. An invitation will be sent to this
union to send delegates to the meeting
when the Building Trades Council will be
organized.
The strike of the coopers in the Pacific
"Woodenware and Cooperage Company has
I been settled to the satisfaction of all per
; sons interested. A week ago the company
decided to make a reduction of from 10 to
] 20 per cent on their millwonc in tne mill
near the foot of Sixth street, and about
twenty men walked out rather than sub
mit to a reduction, and their strike was ap
proved by the Journeymen Coopers' Union.
j Tuesday night the men and the employ
ers held a conference, and the latter de
cided to restore the coopers' wages to the
old rate. Wednesday morning the men
went back to work and the best of feeling
prevails in the mill.
OWNERSHIP OF RAILROADS
A Mass-Meeting Adopts Resolu-
tions in Favor of Govern-
ment Control.
Congressman Maguire Asked to Under
take the Task of Accomplishing
This Object.
In response to the call for a mass
meeting of all in favor of Government
ownership of railroads, a couple of hun
dred people gathered at Metropolitan Hall
last night.
Rev. J. E. Scott, in calling the meeting
to order, said :
The only protection from private monopoly
â¢ is Government ownership. The railroad mo-
I nopoly is the head center, out of which all
: other monopoly oppression flows. There is no
, class that does not contribute to the revenue
; of this monopoly, and every man pays a tax to
! the railroad monopolies that no king on earth
would be allowed to impose. And the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad is one of the most oppres
| sive of these monopolies.
J. M. Reynolds spoke on the subject of
"Government Ownership and Operation of
Railroads." He said it had been reported
that the agitation for Government owner
ship had been suggested by the railroad
people in order to secure votes for the
lunoing biiJ. Continuing he said:
These rich monopolists are the real anarch
ists of this country. This is the only class that
has the means to corrupt our legislators.
Though I knew that men under the influence
of the railroad had called this meeting, 1 yet
felt it my duty to come here and express my
convictions in favor of Government ownership
of railroads.
There is a remedy for not only the railroad
monopoly but all similar monopolies. It lies
in the people, who should jointly undertake
the work of production, manufacture and dis
tribution. This would do away with the pres
ent methods of business, which are largely of
the nature of gambling.
He then introduced the following reso
lutions:
The people of California have repeatedly de
manded by petition, resolutions and tnroogh
their representatives in Congress, that the
Pacific railroads, which have become in
debted to the Nation and been given ample
time to provide for the full payment, should
be compelled to pay the debt now due the Gov
ernment.
Whereas, We, as citizens of the United
States who will De most vitally affected by
the final settlement of the Central and Union
Pacific railroads' debt, deem it- proper to im
press upon Congress as strongly as possible
our views concerning this important matter;
whereas, our representative from this district,
the Hon. James G. Maguire, we believe to be
fully informed as to the almost unanimous
sentiment existing in this State against the
refunding of the debts of the Pacific railroads
and in favor of the foreclosure of the Govern
ment's mortgage on these railroads, and in
iavor of their being placed under the direct
control of the Government and operated by it
in the interests of the people of the whole
Nation; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we confide to the Hon. James
G. Maguire especially the specific duty to draft
a bill providing for the foreclosure of tho lien
now held by the United States against the
Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroad, for
the acquiring of said railroads by the Govern
ment and the perpetual operation of them as
a public highway.
Resolved, further, that a copy of these resolu
tions be forwarded to the Hon. James G. Ma
guire with our request that he comply with
these instructions, and that a copy be sent also
to each member of Congress.
Dennis Kearney then asked permission
to speak to the resolution. In introducing
him the chairman stated that he believed
that Kearney was the man referred to by
the last speaker as being under the influ
ence of the railroad, and that the audience
would no doubt be pleased to hear from
him on this point as well as the advisabil
ity of Government ownership.
Kearney after denying connection with
the railroad corporation denounced Hunt
ington and Mayor Sutro â the former as be
ing a despoiier of the people and the other
for having, as claimed by the speaker, gone
back on a pledge to advocate Government
ownership of railroads.
Morrison I. Swift, a socialist from Chi
cago, stated that the people of the east do
not any longer believe in millionaires;
that they looked upon them all as no more
than convicts out of jail. He said that all
millionaires should be abolished and a pol
icy of nationalization adopted. â 
After R. E. Shannon had spoken in favor
of Government ownership of all public
functions the resolutions were - adopted
and the meeting adjourned.
PIKE, BASS AND PERCH.
| Soon to Be Placed In- Clear .Lake and
the Big Kivers.
In 1892 the Fish Commissioners planted
; in Lake Cuyamaca, fifty miles from San
! Diego, four varieties of fish from the in
land lakes and rivers of the East. They
i were the pike or pickerel, the bi_.-mouth
black bass, the war-mouth bass and the
i yellow perch. Deputy Commissioner A. G.
Fletcher of the Southern district was re
cently instructed to see how these fish
were getting along. He did so, and has
sent an encouraging report to the com
mission. The fish are doing well and mul
tiplyinc rapidly.
The Commissioners were so encouraged
that they decided to distribute a lot of the
fish in the Lower .Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers and in Clear Lake, Lake
County.
At present this lake is filled with carp
which are of poor, flavor and bony. The
bass and pike are beautiful, gamy fish and
are excellent food. These will supplant
the earn in a . few years, as they live on
other fish instead of on **_vÂ»d, grass and â ,
fish spawn. I
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1896.
THE HENRY HOOK INQUEST
Evidence That the Union League
Club Man Fell. From the
â¢ Oakland Boat.
NO INDICATION OF SUICIDE.
The Funeral Will Be Held To-Day at
the Family Residence on Jack
son Street, Oakland.
The cause of Henry Hook's death is
still unknown. At the Coroner's inquest
held in Oakland yesterday the jury found
only that Mr. Hook "came to his death by.
drowning in the San Francisco Bay on or
about January 14." The watch found on
the body bad stopped at 1:15 o'clock. This
seemed to serve as evidence that Hook
had taken the last boat from the City to
Oakland on the night of the 14th. . No
THE LATE HON. HENRY HOOK.
one, however, has been found who remem
bers having seen him after he left the
rooms of the Union League Club.
Vincent Hook stated that he saw his
brother last alive a week ago Tuesday
during a visit made to Vincent's ranch,
near Martinez.
Last Monday he came to see his brother,
but found him not at home, his daughter
saying that her father had been away
nearly a week and that she had begun to
become uneasy. On the night of the
Union League election Mr. Hook took $20
with him, and it was subsequently learned
that, lie bad paid $17 50 of this for dues at
the club. He left the club about 10
o'clock.
"My brother," said Vincent Hook, "was
' afflicted with rheumatism and asthma, but
was always of a jovial disposition and was
rarely despondent. "I do not think he
had an enemy in the world except himself
' and I never heard him say a word about
; taking his own life. lam of the opinion
that after leaving the club he took a late
boat, and feeling ill went to the railing of
the boat and fell overboard. As soon as I
; learned from my niece of her father's ab
| sence I immediately began a search in San
i Francisco. I do not for a moment believe
he committed suicide, because he has gone
through very severe attacks of asthma and
rheumatism in the past."
"W. T. Hemstead, who, together with
Robert Wainwright, Ed Cosgrove and
; Ernest Head, found the body of Mr.
i Hook, stated at the inquest that they first
I discovered â  the body about 9 o'clock
j Wednesday morning lying imbedded in
the mud at the foot of Castro street, about
sixty feet from the shore, and nearly
where the scow schooner Young America
was anchored. There was no mark of in
jury apparent.
William P. Hook, a nephew of the dead
i man, said his uncle was subject to frequent
! attacks of asthma, and that these attacks
came more often at night and without
warning.
The funeral of Mr. Hook will take place
to-day from the family residence, 1016
Jackson street, Oakland. The interment
will be private, at Mountain View Ceme
tery. The Rev. John Badewell will con
duct the services.
Mr. Hook was born in Arrow Rock, Mo.,
on October 1, 1848, and came to California
with his parents in 1850. The family, on
arriving in this City, departed imme
diately for the g.oldlields of Hangtown,
now Placerville, and they remained there
until 1851. They then moved to Sacra
mento and engaged in the merchandise
business. In this city they carried on a
very large business until driven out by
fire in 1852. Afterward the father of Mr.
Hook began a mercantile business in Mar
tinez, Contra Costa County, and Martinez
has continued to be the homestead of the
family.
Mr. Hook amassed a large fortune and
invested his money in farms throughout
the county.
Mr. Hook was given an excellent educa
tion. He attended the Contra Costa school
until 1865, when he entered the Benicia
College, graduating in 1867. At 20 years of
age he was appointed abstract clerk in the
Naval Oflice of the United States Custom
house. He remained in that position un
til 1875. Then he accepted a clerkship in
the furniture-store of his uncle, Elijah
Hook of Oakland, and after ten years in
that house he made a tour of the United
States, during which trip he was the guest
of President Hayes at Columbus, Ohio.
He was nominated for Treasurer of Con
tra Costa County in 1886 and was afterward
nominated for the Assembly by the Re

HER VICTORY COMPLETE
An Interesting Case Involving a
Precedent in Fraternal
Legislation.
Mrs. Osterman Secures Her Endowment
and Vindicates the Good Name
of Her Husband.
Aside from the personal interest that at
taches to the decision of the Supreme
Court just handed down in the case of
Mrs. Sarah Osterman vs. District Grand
Lodge No. 4, I. O. B. 8., an important pre
cedent is established in connection with
fraternal society legislation.
Monroe Osterman died on May 29, 1891,
and at the time of his death was a mem
ber and secretary of Ophir Lodge No. 21,
I. O. B. B.
His widow, after his death, in due time
made application for the $2000 to which
she claimed to be entitled by virtue of her
husband at the time of his death being a
member of the endowment branch of the
order. She was informed, however, by
Trustees D'Ancona and Saalburg of Ophir
Lodge that not only had her husband been
delinquent in his dues and assessments at
the time of bis death, but that he was a
defaulter.
During the trial of the case Trustee Saal
burg testified on direct examination that
Osterman'a defalcation was between $3100
and $3500, but on cross-examination he
modified this so as to bring the amount
down to about $900, but it was later shown
that the actual shortage was less than $300.
It was also shown that there was due
Osterman from Ophir Lodge at the time of
his death more than the amount of his
shortage and the dues and assessments
which had become delinquent.
The claim set up by the defense, how
ever, rested mainly upon the allegation
that the deceased had been delinquent and
liable to suspension, but had been able to
keep the matter of his delinquency from
the lodge by virtue of being its secretary.
But the Supreme Court holds that the
laws of the order expressly provide that a
member must be formally suspended by
hi 3 lodge before his heirs lose their right
to the endowment, and that a mere delin
quency did not abrogate the rights of the
member's beneficiaries.
Another peculiar development that was
part of the proceedings in the trial court
was the testimony of the plaintiff that she
had been induced by Trustee William
Saalburg to sign the following document
before they would consent to pay her the
endowment:
You are hereby authorized to pay to Ophir
Lodge No. 21 all moneys in the hands of mv
late husband, Monroe Osterman, belonging to
said lodge, and to deduct the same from the
endowment of $2000 which you hold for me
under the laws of District Grand Lodge No. .4.
This order the Supreme Court holds to
be of no value, as the endowment in ques
tion could not be made liable for her hus
band's debts.
Many of the members of the order were
surprised that the plaintiff should have
been able to secure the services of Joseph
Rothschild, as he is not only the attorney
for the order, but is also a member of the
supreme tribunal of the organization the
International Court of Appeals. * Speaking
of his action in taking the case Mr. Roths
child said that it appeared; to him to be
so flagrant an attempt at injustice to a
widow that h3 felt it his duty, as a mem
ber of the order, whose pride it is to look
after the widows and orphans of deceased
members, to assist Mrs. Osterman to se
cure her endowment. ;
JAPAN'S CHEAP LABORERS
How They Learn by "Looking
At" the Operatives of
Other Nations.
THREE YEARS' MATCH EXPORTS
The Japanese Cotton-Goods Exporters
Driving English Products Out
of Asia.
The joint committee of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association and
Chamber of Commerce met yesterday in
the Mills building to consider the Japan
ese cheap-goods question. There were
present: Hugh Craig (chairman), Fred H.
Dingle (secretary), Julian Sonntag, Pro
fessor George Davidson, Wakefield Baker,
W. F, Bowers, George H. Collins, W. B.
Curtis, William Rutherford and A. Sbar
boro. :;/7^
The following report was received from
Wakefield Baker of the firm of Baker &
Hamilton, relative to the metal products
of Japan:
With the limited means of information at
hand it would seem as though they had an
ample supply of coal, iron and copper. Their
wire, however, is not in the most desirable
shape for working, and from the fact that
freight forms such a high percentage on goods
of this class it may safely be relied upon for the
present, at least, that no shipments of prod
ucts of iron will be made to this country.
â  In this connection it may be positively
stated that notwithstanding their present
cheap labor nearly all the by-products of
iron which they are at present using are im
ported into that country, and while they may
be able in the future to supply their home con
sumption, there is but little fear from their
present resources that they will enter this
market, . especially after considering the
present protective duties.
Native copper, has always been sold so
cheaply there that it would seem as tnough it
might be possible for the products of this
metal to be shipped to this market whenever
they may have machinery to make such com
modities economically.
It has not been possible to obtain figures as
to the possible output of native copper, but it
is known that there is and has been an over
supply rather than a scarcity. -
They are very large producers of coal, and
from the best information at hand it would
seem as though the average price of 'this for
local consumption would not exceed the cost
of similar coals in this and other cheap coal
producing countries.
This committee has not gone further into
their general resources on metals from the
fact that freights and import duties as at pres
ent existing would make imports from that
country almost if not absolutely prohibiting,
and, further, because labor in the manufac
ture of metals forms such a small percentage
of the cost. Wakefield Baker,
For the committee.
W. F. Bowers, for the committee, re
ported upon the manufacture of Japanese
rubber goods as follows:
Your committee is unable to learn that they
are operating any rubber factories at present,
but they doubtless will be at an early day, be
cause they are already making the cotton
duck which is a large factor in the production
of mechanical rubber. They can easily obtain
crude gum direct from the rubber forests of
India and machinery from this country. With
such low-priced material and labor they could
easily undersell the American manufacturer if
their product was allowed to enter this coun
try free. W. F. Bo webs.
Horace J. Dunn, who was formerly con
nected with the Japanese Consular
service, and who bad been requested by
the committee to give some information
upon the labor status of that country, was
present. He said that the daily wages of
laborers had lately gone up in the empire
on an average of from 10 to 17 sen, or from
0 to 9 cents, their value here. In 1872
Japan exported 9,242,035 cross of boxes of
matches, valued at 2,202,041 silver yen (a
yen is about 54 cents, United States coin,
here). In 1893 the export was 13.541,287
gross boxes, at 3,537,974 silver yen, and in
lS94the match export was 13,843,022 gross
at 3,795,634 silver yen. The United State 3
received in 1892 about 150 gross, in 1893,
1300 gross, and in 1894, 5285 gross.
Mr. Dunn stated that it would be impos
sible for the operatives of any country to
compete with the Japanese. Workmen on
watches now being made in that country
were being paid an equivalent to 9 cents a
day for the same labor that $2 75 and $3 50
is paid in this country.
Manager William Rutherford of the
California Cotton Mills at Oakland made
an address so full of facts and figures per
taining to the incoming waves of Japanese
cheap-labor products that the committee
was aghast at the impending peril.
He read the following extract from a
letter requesting him to remove the mills
to Japan as an illustration of the marvel
ouslv cheap resources of that pushing em
pire:
The price of coal here Is IV to I% yen; cost
of ground for a site (200,000 square feetâ
aimost tive acres), 10,000 to 25,000 yen; cost of
male labor per day, twelve hours, 0.25 to 0.75
yen; female labor per day, 0.14 to 0.35 yen.
The taxes will be about 75 per cent of what
they are in California, and are payable in sil
ver yen, or about 50 per cent. There is no duty
oo importing raw cotton Irom anywhere. Tex
tiles of any kind manufactured in Japan pay
no duty when exported. Cost of the building
would be about one-third of cost in the United
States.
Mr. Rutherford here stated to the com
mittee that he could remove his entire
plant to Japan, pay $7 50 per ton freight
on raw cotton and export cotton goods at
a profit of 20 per cent.
The Japanese writer advised his Oakland
correspondent to take inNi native partner,
as then "the interior and exterior com
mercial field of Japan and China would be
accessible to the new firm, as by the peace
treaty between those two countries a large
new territory of China has been opened
commercially to Japanese only." After ad
vising Mr. Rutherford to locate his mills
near Yokohama, which is within an hour's
railroad ride of Tokio and nearer the great
market of the capital city than the many
mills of Osaka, which is now beginning to
compete with the world, the writer says:
We have a native partner for you, Mr. â -,
who has in Japan high and influential social
and commercial connections. He is a gradu
ate of several United States colleges and is
thoroughly acquainted - with the American
and Asiatic markets as well as his own.
After stating that capital was no object,
that money could be procured for the
building of as large a plant as desired, the
writer gives this following bit of informa
tion:
As regards the starting of the mill, it would
only be necessary to take to Japan a; few ex
perienced hands from the United States for a
time not exceeding one month. We have In
Japan all the help necessary, including the
moat skillful in textile manufactures, so that
a few days of looking at the United States help
would be sufficient to enable our Japanese
hands to pick up the thread and to finish each
particular kind of goods quite to perfection.
Mr. Rutherford stated that the incessant
activity of the Japanese is carrying him
ahead at a prodigious rate. He is taking
the British Indian markets away from
Great Britain himself. ' English and even
German trade journals are sounding the
alarm. "As the Japanese took our " arms
and beat the Chinese they are taking our
commercial methods to beat us. They
are advancing against us armed with our
own weapons. They are always imitating,
imitating, imitating."
Speaking of the readiness with which
Japan has adopted foreign methods Mr.
Rutherford said :
English and American methods were in
stituted in the commercial, postal, naval
and military departments of the Government,
and her inquiring and energetic song can be
found in the dockyards, machine-shops,
laboratories, workshops and the schools of the
most: advanced, nations, and the l recent re
markable military and naval supremacy in the
war with China was the result of her careful
preparation and .raining along these lines. ; -
Japan's industrial and; commercial progress
is just as real and true as her "naval and mili
tary, and it is as certain as her national exist
ence ! Her people ? are patriotic, brave and law
abiding, and there are 40,000,000 waiting and
ready to be led into â¢ the - peaceful pursuits of
manufacturing, trade, commerce and agricul
ture. ,
Labor and fuel are so cheap that neither
Europe nor the United States can stand out
against her in the open field of competition,
and Japan has no patent laws and no inter
national restraints on her citizens, utilizing
any and all inventions and improvements
found by her industrious sons in every pro
gressive country they are in.
Japanese agents are selling in our markets
to-day chemicals, textiles and metal goods at
prices the American manufacturer and pro
ducer cannot touch. You will find chemicals
in our drugstores, metals in hardware-stores
and metal-workshops, and textiles in our dry
goods houses which are of Japanese make.
As a representative of textile manufacturers
on this coast I am in a, position to know that
, Japanese manufacturers have already taken
some from our trade, and in time, if sufficient
protection is not afforded by National legisla
tion, every textile factory will be affected, aDd
it won't be long before we all feel it. The evil
effect will be the same uDon our laboring
classes whether we permit the importation of
cheap labor goods or let in Japanese and
Chinese immigration. Indeed, the evil least
serious and objectionable would be the admis
sion of the laborer. Better tnat he produce his
stock and manufacture in this country than
do so in another county, and then sell his prod
ucts here; and those who champion the cause
of the exclusion of Asiatics should consider
this view of the question.
Every month large shipments of cotton pass
through this City in transit to the cotton mills
of Japan, chiefly, to Osaka, the Manchester of
that nation. Every bale shipped abroad to be
manufactured represents a loss to the American
laborer of $30 a bale in wages.
In 1883 Japan was erecting at Osaka her two
first modern mills, equipped with the latest
and best makes of machinery. To-day she is
erecting her fifty-sixth mill, and all the mills
erected in that time are managed entirely by
Japanese, and the financial results far exceed
to the capitalists and investors their most san
guine expectations. No alien can in Japan
own real estate, therefore all those mills are
built for and under the control of
Japanese citizens. They are well managed,
and economical methods prevail, and a large
percentage of profit paid to stockholders, and
the products of 700,000 spindles are sold in
foreign lands. The wages paid married cotton
mill help in Osaka, Japan, i 3as follows:
Women, for twelve hours' work, 14 to 35 sen;
men, lor twelve hours' work, 25 to 75 sen.
.. If it costs in this country $50,000 in
wages to produce from 4000 bales of
cotton plain salable cotton products
the- same can be produced in Japan
for about $17,500. The "freight on these goods
to and from Japan would not be more than
$15,000, which leaves a balance in favor of
Japan of $17,500, not taking into account the
greater difference in favor of Japan arising
from the payment of everything on a silver
basis. .
Mr. Sonntag moved that the joint com
mittees urge their respective associations
to request our representatives in Congress
to urge the appointment of a committee to
investigate the Japanese import and ex
port trade; also that a mass-meeting be
held in the Chamber of Commerce at the
very earliest day possible to further discuss
and take action upon the subject of the
cheap Japanese products invasion.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT.
The British Ship Falls of Halla
dale Makes a Record for
Herself.
A Seaman Lost From the General
Faircliild and the Homer
Disabled.
The British ship Falls of Halladale.
which arrived from Swansea yesterday,
has made the quickest run in years, and if
the time was reckoned from land to land
it would be the quickest on record. Cap
tain Fordyce says his ship made the run
in ninety-nine days, and that is only
twenty-four hours behind the voyage of the
Eudora two years ago and two days behind
the record made by the Merioneth five
years ago. The Halladale had a remark
able streak of luck from the Horn to San
Francisco, as she was only thirty-nine
days getting here, which is equal to
steamer time. From 50 deg. latitude in
the Atlantic to 50 in the Pacific only occu
pied ten days, so that the ship had all her
bad weather in the Atlantic.
The day the Falls of Halladale sailed
Charles Anderson, a seaman, reported for
duty. He was then slightly under the in
fluence of liquor, and was told to go to
bed. When the watch was called next
morning Anderson was missing, and the
chances are that during the night he went
on the forecastle and fell overboard.
Captain Fordyce of the Falls of Halla
dale is an old-time shipmaster, having
been a master in the "County" line of
ships for over twenty-live years. The last
time he was in San Francisco was in 1869,
when he was master of the famous tea
clipper Singapore.
The recent southeaster kept a Dig fleet
of grain-laden vessels in port. As the storm
seems to have passed all the vessels seized
the opportunity and went to sea. The
Celtic Bard sailed for London, the Os
borne for Hull, the GlenSnart for Queens
town, the LauristonforNewcasle, N.S. \V.,
the Hospodar for Ipswich, the Falls of
Clyde for Hull, the Copley for Queens
town, the Marie Hackfeld for Queenstown,
and the Glendale for the Sound. The
schooner-yacht Jessie, which was recently
purchased by the Columbia River pilots,
also sailed for Astoria, and on her arrival
there will immediately be put in commis
sion. A-'4p.
The Tahiti Island trader City of Papeete
has just completed unloading 110,000 co
coanuts for L. J. Schresovich & Co., and
will sail again on the Ist of next month,
carrying the French mail to the islands.
Almost every vessel that arrives in port
has a tale of disaster to tell. If it has not
been a battle with the elements it is one
of a man or men lost overboard or killed
by falling from aloft. The steam schooner
Alcazar was caught in Sunday's south
easter, and the captain says henever had
such a terrible time of it. Toe vessel was
several times in danger, but finally man
aged to weather the storm and reach port
in safety.
The bark General Faircliild was also
caught in the storm. While the crew was
aloit furling sail Thomas Bradburn fell
from the main topsail yard to the deck
and was instantly killed. He was buried
at sea.
The steamer Areata got in yesterday and
reports that the steamer Homer wa3

dition. The Homer is twenty-f our hours

shipped fresh from the
factory in such lots that the
smoker gets them while they are
still moist. The leaf is grown,
cured and selected with the one
idea in view of producing a mild,
sweet smoke, uniform and free-
burning. Their ever-increasing
popularity proves that this extra
care is not in vain. Made in
new sizes to suit your ideas
overdue and fears are entertained for her.
Should she not get in by noon to-day a
tup will be sent out to look for her. The
Areata sighted the Homer at 10:30 a. m. on
the 21st inst. and at that time she was
making slow headway against the heavy
seas. The captain signaled that a portion
of the machinery had given away, but that
he was not in need of assistance. The
steamer at that time was making about 3
knots an hour, but if another accident
had happened during the storms of the
last day or so she would be in a serious
predicament. The Homer is a good, stout
shin, however, and her owners have no
fears for her safety.
CRUELTY AT SEA.
First Mate Orr of the Ship John McDon-
aid Arrested.
Charles W. Orr, first mate of the ship
John McDonald, for whom a warrant has
been out for some time on the charge of
cruel treatment of sailors at sea, was ar
rested yesterday by a Deputy United States
Marshal. The officers have been looking
for Orr for some time, but have heretofore
been unable to locate him. Orr was taken
before Commissioner Heacock, gave bail
and was released.
Philip Ratz Convicted.
Philip "Ratz, who was on trial before Judge
Wallace for a felonious assault upon little Julia
Christiansen, was convicted after six minutes'
deliberation by the jury yesterday. There
was no defense submitted to the case of the
prosecution, and the arguments and charge
took but a short time. There is another
charge of the same character pending against
Ratz. He will be sentenced next Friday.

"Wheat goes upâ the revival is here.
Every grain field in the State is on rising
ground now.
Nothing goes against the grain in Calfor*
nia this year.
"We started the San Joaquin Railroad in
the nick of time.
It is going to be a Republican year all
the way through.
In these days all wheat is spring wheat,
and right on the jump.
When the prosperity ol the farmer begins
to rise, it lifts everything.
Now is the time to sing "we will all be
happy in this wheat by and by."
Nobody would object if some one in
authority should give Vining a transfer.
Salisbury is still unwilling to arbitrate,
but he is willing to grant a few conces
sions.
The Senate does not advertise to legis
late while you wait, but you must wait all
the same.
Golden days in the grain fields as well as
in the mines will mal>e California feel like
herself again.
The wheat-growing districts can afford
to get into line with the procession of
festival counties.
Olney should ask Krueger the simple
Question: "If Jameson is released why is
Hammond held?"
There is many a key to the present gov
ernmental situation, but none of them can
open the deadlock.
Huntington will soon have to take his
hands off the State, for he will need both
of them at Washington.
People who undertake to fill the bill as
reformers shouldn't fill their bills with
unconstitutional provisions.
In point of length, breadth and thick
ness, every Senatorial debate is equal to an
elaborate campaign of education.
Since Krueger asserts that hiÂ» American
prisoners must stand trial, Mr. Olney must
see to it that the trial is a fair one.
The new Election Beard is ousted, but
there are plenty of means left for straight
politics to bring about municipal reform.
California can defeat the funding billf if
she can prevent the railroad from con
fusing the contest by mixing other issues
with it.
If Tom Reed has anythirg of an itching
palm at all it must itch sometimes to get
hold of the gavel of the President of the
Senate.
Despite the Sultan's announcement that
he would not allow it Miss Barton has
sailed for Armenia, and the Sultan won't
stop her.
We were a nation of fools to elect Cleve
land, but Providence has taken care
of us and we will be able to pay those
bonds yet.
Sherman may have been right in calling
the silver question "an old, worn issue,"
but it is a great deal better than Cleve
land's new issue.
The Kaiser's letter to Krueger seems to
have been directed mainly at the mem
bers of the Reichstag who oppose an in
crease in the army.
Wheat rises in price, and the competing
road will give the farmers of California the
means of keeping the monopoly from
grabbing all the profits.
Sherman says the silver Senators know
their bill cannot pass, and Teller retorts
that Sherman knows the bond bill cannot
pass, and there you have it.
From the present outlook there will be
no legislation of importance this winter,

THE EISE IN WHEAT.
The rise in the price of wheat is un
doubtedly the most important event that
has happened in the new year. It will
affect society so widely that hardly any in
dustry will fail to feel its influence. The
effect, moreover, will be wholly beneficial.
Our commercial and industrial activities
are so closely associated with one another
and all are so largely dependent upon the
conditions of agricultural industries that
the prosperity now seemingly assured to
the farmers will be felt as a stimulus in
all departments of work and trade, lead
ing to an upward movement in tho prices
of products of all kinas.
It is significant that nearly all the busi
ness men who were interviewed by The
Call on the subject yesterday spoke more
of the effect of the rise upon the fina ncial
situation than upon any other point. . It
is believed that it will at once make the
money market easier and start into brisker
circulation that golden current which is
the life blood of the social organism of
every civilized people. If this should
prove to be the case there will at once re
sult between wheat and gold an action and
reaction mutually beneficial. If the rise
in wheat prices gives confidence to bankers
and makes loans easier that will in turn
add to the industry and consuming power
of the country and tend to a further ad
vance in wheat, so that the outlook prom
ises even better prices than now prevail.
"While every portion of the United States
will be more or less benefited by the im
proved outlook the prospects for Cali
fornia are exceptionally good. Our wheat
is worth in the world's market 10 cents
per cental more than that of any other
section of the Union. Moreover in our
climate it is not yet too late for farmers to
plant wheat for the crop of the coming
season, and the recent rains have put the
soil in most excellent condition for that
purpose. This last a dvantage is one of
great value, and if promptly made use of
may enable many a farmer to have a much
larger harvest and more abundant profit
than he would otherwise have.
It 13 in the highest degree gratifying at
this juncture to know that the San Joa
quin Railroad is well under way and will
be ready for business over a considerable
territory by the time the wheat crop is
ready for the market. Without the com
petition afforded by that road the grain
growers of the valley would gain little
from the rise in prices. The monopoly
would absorb it all if the new road were
not there to afford relief. Fortunately it
is there, and the farmers of the San Joa
quin can count on the getting for them
selves the profit which is justly theirs.
A REPUBLICAN NEED.
The Supreme Court decision declaring
the new Election Commission of San Fran
cisco unconstitutional throws the election
machinery back into the hands of the old
board, which contains a Democratic ma
jority. At the same time the Superior
Court of Los Angeles renders a decision
against the constitutionality of the pri
njary election law, but this is not final
until the Supreme Court passes on the
question. The appeal from Los Angeles
will doubtless be pushed forward with all
possible speed.
Whatever may be the final decision in
the matter Charles W. Manwaring, chair
man of the Republican County Commit
tee, in a card published in Thursday's
Call, earnestly urges the committee,
either as a body or individually, "to make
an effort to secure the choice by the Elec
tion Commission of good, efficient Repub
licans to represent the party in the pre
cinct boards." He insists that none but
"unquestionable Republicans" be selected.
The urgency for this is very great. The
shameful position in which the City has
been placed by permitting unscrupulous
bosses of both parties to manipulate pre
cinct boards by corrupt combinations and
to control the conventions should be
remedied as quickly and thoroughly as
possible. Had it not been for this kind of
politics such a disgraceful thing a3 a Solid
Eight in the Board of Supervisors would
have been impossible, and the need of
Grand Jury disclosures of scandalous prac
tices in the Street Department would never
have arisen.
The increasing power of Christopher
Buckley, the Democratic boss, in reorgan
izing his scattered forces and thus present
ing a fair prospect of being able to over
whelm the decent element of that party
in the City, adds to the necessity for ener
getic action on the part of the Republicans
to keep their own house clean and make it
inviting to the respectable elements of all
parties. The success of a corrupt boss in
one party is an encouragement for the ad
vent of a corrupt boss in the other, for it is
by combinations that they thrive best. A
Solid Eight, composed of Republicans and
Democrats, means simply a combination
between the bosses who elected and con
trol them.
The Republicans of -the City have now
the best opportunity that has ever been
offered them to organize on a high plane
and purge San Francisco of political ras
cality. The people are tired of boss rule.
If the Republicans succeed in suppressing
the advent of a boss of the Buckley type
in their ranks and place only decent and
responsible citizens on guard they can
sweep the City. The consternation fol
lowing Buckley's reappearance has cre
ated an extraordinary opportunity for the
Republicans, but they can lose all its pos
sible benefits by failure to appreciate its
value. â  '
BRING THEM UNDER CONTROL.
The people of the town of San Leandro,
in Alameda County, through their public
officers, have been compelled to resort to
violence in the protection of what they
deem to be their rights against the aggres
sions of the electric railway which runs
between Oakland and Haywards. The
town authorities take the ground that cer
tain privileges, granted years ago to the
railway company, have lapsed by reason
of a failure on the part of the company to
avail itself of them at the proper time.
Hence when the company sought forcibly
to assert its privileges the ; authorities re
sisted, the townspeople lent a hand and
a small riot ensued. The company, once
a favorite with the people, has incurred
their bitter animosity by pursuing what
they think is a selfish and high-handed
policy.
It is not within the province of The
Call to deal with the legal phase of this
case, but the privilege remains of saying
that, had the company acted differently,
it would have kept the good will' of the
people, would have enjoyed a larger busi
ness and would have made its road a more
valuable property than it is. If it had
been actuated by wisdom and a regard for
public rights it would have gone openly
before the authorities, announced its in
tention of making the contemplated mi
provement, and, in case of a question of
legal right, would have proceeded decor
ously in one or morr. of the numerous
proper ways open to it. It seems to have
preferred the methods of the Southern
Pacific Company and its offspring, the
Market-street Railway Company, and, as a
result, it has incurred the popular hatred
in which these companies are held."
An .'; end must come to all such aggres-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1896.
sions. Even the Market-street Railway
Company, which has been lording it over
this City with the same imperious disre
gard of public right which the Southern
Pacific has always displayed, is being
called to terms, for a suit has been brought
to dispossess it of a number of streets over
which it holds franchises secured under
terms which have been openly and defi
antly violated. The way in which the
Metropolitan road has beer, managed by
the Market-street Company has virtually
checked the progress which the region
south of the park had begun, and property
values there have suffered accordingly.
Persons who built homes in the section
served by that road did so under the natu
ral presumption that the conditions ob
taining at the time of their building and
required by law would continue. The in
convenience which they have suffered has
been annoying and serious.
It is time that these matters should re
ceive a thorough overhauling and the fact
be definitely ascertained if tbe railway
companies are really stronger than the
people, the laws which they enact and the
officers whom they elect.
THE MONEY DIVERTED.
As M. G. Upton pointed out in a com
munication published in Thursday's Call
the money which the Central Pacific
earned by taxing the industries of Califor
nia was sufficient to pay the debt to the
Government, but instead of being applied
to that use, as was understood between the
Government and the company, it was di
verted to the pockets of the company's
members. Hence the private fortunes of
these persons in reality belong to the Gov
ernment. The people have already paid
sufficient money to the company to extin
guish its debt, but Mr. Huntington asks
that he be given the opportunity to make
them pay it a second time. This is mon
strous on its face. '**.*-.,
Not only would the people have to raise
this amount of money a second time if a
funding bill were passed, but the burdens
which have borne so heavily upon them in
the shape of railroad extortion would be
largely increased, for we may be sure that
the company will never be willing to re
duce the amount of its profits, and that in
raising the extra large sum required by a
funding bill it will increase its tariffs.
Even that, however, is not so serious a
matter as the perpetuation of the power
ful monopoly which holds the welfare of
California in its grasp. We in this State
are familiar with the many ways in which
this power has been exercised.
Undoubtedly the desperate eagerness
with which Mr. Huntington is seeking to
secure the passage of a funding bill is, in
art. explainable on the ground of his fear
that if he is forced to settle with the Gov
ernment his private fortune may be en
dangered. This is the property which he
should have paid to the Government in
stead of putting it into his own pocket.
There are "equities" besides those which
be is urging as a reason for an extension
of his debt.
The establishing of such a precedent as
that for which the railroad companies are
contending would be an exceedingly un
wise policy for this Goverrment to adopt.
It would be going contrary to every busi
ness principle, and would be subversive of
the wise and fixed financial relations ex
isting between the Government and its
citizens. The whole proposition is so dan
gerous, absurd and unjust tbat the won
der is it should be gravely considered for a
moment by the Nation's representatives
at Washington.
UTILIZING^ THE ISLAND.
The bill introduced by Senator Perkins
for the establishment of a naval training
station on Goat Island has the hearty in
dorsement of Secretary Herbert of the
navy and the ardent support of the Cali
fornia delegation in the House. As the
Secretary points out. not only does the in
crease in the number of war vessels create
a great demand for trained seamen in the
absence of a merchant marine, but such
training schools encourage the intro
duction of American citizens into the ser
vice of the country. /â 
. No place in the Nation is more admir
ably adapted for this purpose than Goat
Island. Although a land station, it is
sufficiently far removed from the main
land to make its efficiency and discipline
perfectly effective, and while this end is
being served all the facilities of a large
city immediately at hand can be enjoyed.
The climate is excellent, and diseases of
local origin could be rendered impossible,
as the island is high and the drainage
perfect. Tne bay offers a perfect practice
ground, and there is ample room on the
island for land drill.
The putting of the island to some such
use would effectually extinguish the dan
ger of its being secured by some great pri
vate corporation which may happen to
enjoy the special favor of the Govern
ment. If Congress passes a funding bill
the act would be a betrayal of such a
spirit of friendliness to the Southern Pa
cilic as would endanger Goat Island. Had
it not been for the vigorous fight which
San Francisco made against the proposi
tion some years ago to turn over the isl
and to the Southern Pacific for terminal
purposes its usefulness to Government
would have come to an end. It might be
well, by the way, to keep in mind the ex
cellent results which that opposition pro
duced, in view of the necessity for an
equally vigorous campaign against the far
more important proposition of the funding
bill.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
F. L.' Erickson, one of the heaviest railroad
contractors in the country, is at the Grand.'
Mr. Erickson and his associates have been en
gaged on the line of the Pacific Coast Railway
in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.
Just now the gentleman is taking a vacation,
as the Southern Pacific Company has stopped
building for a time. '".*.â 
Mr. Erickson was, witn his father before
him, for twelve years at work on the Canadian
Pacific. They built 360 miles of that road.
They also built the Duluth and Iron Range
and the retaining wall of Superior street in
Duluth.
The Canadian Pacific work took twelve years
and the latter two and a half years. Five years
were also devoted to the building of the Chi
cago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha road.
Besides all this, they did pretty much all the
work on the St. Paul and Duluth.
Mr. Erickson's extensive outfit is now lying
idle in Shannon Canyon, Santa Barbara. With
the outfit are 285 horses and an enormous
amount of apparatus, consisting of wagons,
plows, scrapers, rock drills and the scores of
F. L. Erickson, One of the Leading Railroad Contractors in the Country, Now at
the Grand.
appliances of different kinds used in modern
railroad building. The whole thing, he says,
cost $72,000, and five years ago would have
cost fully $125,000.
Mr. Erickson says horses which used to
be worth from $400 to $500 a span can now be
bought readily for from $30 to $125.. The
latter sum will buy a smashing team of big
1400- pound horses.
The ages he selects are from four or five to
ten years. Under four the horses are too soft,
work too freely and soon strain themselves and
use themselves up. Beyond ten the horses are
too old. Ai/Ty
"It takes an enormous amount of feed to
supply our horses," he said. They use of hay
alone from 300 to 500 tons every three or four
months. Of the grain there is also a tremend
ous amount. When any of our horses get too
old we kill them at once. It don't pay to keep
them. The cost is too great.
"The bicycle and electricity has immeasur
ably decreased the demand for horses. I
wouldn't think of paying more than $40 now
for a horse that a few years ago would have
readily commanded $200.
"In regard to railroad building I think Cali
fornia is more promising as a future field of
operations than any other State I know of. I
wouldn't be surprised if the Southern Pacific
would get in now soon and build a lot of road.
"From what I can see, too, I rather think
work will begin before long on the Salt Lake
road. Mayor W. H. Carlson of San Diego has
interested himself a good deal in road-building.
He built six miles some time ago by popular
dollar subscriptions."
Mr. Erickson will leave this evening for Og
den on a short visit.
Malcolm D. Calkins of the Amador Record is
a guest at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. His son,
Thomas Do tin Calkins, and the latter's wife are
at the same house registered from Sutter Creek.
The son Is editor of the Record. The elder
gentleman, or Colonel Calkins, as ho is com
monly known, has been a newspaper and min
ing man for the major portion of his three score
and ten years.
'â¢I came from a race of journalists," he re
marked as he sat before a comfortable fire,
and I believe that I have turned out a race of
newspaper men."
"What do you mean by that, Colonel?" was
asked.
"I mean simply that I am the father of more
live newspaper men than any man living," he
replied with a smile. "Here is my son Thomas,
editor of the Record, who is a pretty lively
specimen; and there is L. S. Calkins, Post
master at Nevada City and editor of the
Nevada Transcript; Willard P. is of the
Truckee Republican, and Charles L. is of the
Siskiyou Reporter, published at Fort Jones.
"You want to know something about our
mining boom, do you? Well, it has come to
stay, and don't you forget it. Thomas can tell
you all about it."
."Yes," responded the young man. "Things
are booming at Sutter Creek. We have some
of the greatest gold mines in the world. Many
mines that have been idle for years are now
being worked Profitably in consequence of
modern appliances for taking out and reducing
ore. â â  * â  .
"The mother lode runs directly through
Amador County and on it is located such
mines as the Hay ward, Eureka, Central
Eureka, or Summit, South Eureka/Oneida,
Kennedy, Clyde, Volunteer, Jackson, Argo
naut, Hoffman and Alma. These all lie be
tween Sutter Creek and Jackson. The Oneida
Is a great mine, owned by the Rothschilds and
Seligmanns. It has a three-compartment
shaft. New machinery is being erected and
the output is expected to be very heavy.
Aside from this property nearly all the mines
are conducted by local capital. New claims
are being located every day.
"The Central Eureka mine, formerly known
as the Summit, lies jin the southern outskirts
of the town of Sutter Creek, occupying some
GOO feet in width by 1500 in length, lying be
tween the old Eureka or Hay.ward mine and
the well-known South Eureka. Some twenty
years ago it was operated, but , the machinery
was Inadequate, and there was trouble among
the managers. Now C. W. Randall of San Fran
cisco and his associates have possession of it
through a forced sale. Last week a contract
was let to build a complete plant, similar to
that now on the Gwin mine, and with sufficient
power to sink any depth the mine will reach.
It is expected to sink -at least 1200 feet before
any cross-cutting is done.
"Yes, sir; I tell you the Amador has got the
boom of her life on."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
MR. VINING AND THE NEWSBOYS.
The Railroad Magnate's Appeal to the Mer
.'.;- chants' Association.
While Mr. Vining has succeeded in a large
measure in subjugating the mature and adult
portion of his subjects, he is severely exercised
by the Indifference and insolence of the im
mature newsboys, and has been obliged to ap
peal to the Merchants' Association to aid him
in suppressing their handling transfers and
depleting the revenues of the monopoly. Mr.
Vining thinks it is getting money under false
pretenses for a newsboy to sell a newspaper to
any person with a transfer as a premium. Mr.
Vining contemplates petitioning the Super
visors to make it a misdemeanor to traffic in
transfers. Mr. Vining was astonished on a
rainy day at seeing a lady cross Powell street
from the west to the east side to give a news
boy a transfer.
But all the anxiety and agony of Mr. Vining
may be caused because out of 350,000 inhabit
ants possibly not more than 200,000 daily
| patronize his combine, and one in a thousand
â  may get a transfer through a newsboy under
Mr. Vining's interpretation of fraudulent pre
tenses. Mr. Vining ought to know that one
third of his 200.000 daily patrons ride from
force of habit and not of necessity, and when
the facts are brought to their notice and com
prehension (as they will be) that the combine
is following in the footsteps of its illustrious
predecessor, the notorious "octopus," by con
tinuing "to charge all the traffic will bear," !
these 67,000 patrons will discontinue riding,
save more than $3000 a day, keep the nickels,
increase the contents of their pockets and im
prove their health by walking.

HOW THE SCANDAL
WILL BE HEARD
Dr. Brown First and Then
the Story of Miss
Overman.
MRS. DAVIDSON FOLLOWS
The Disappearance of Mrs. Tun
nell Looked After by the
Committee.
THE MINISTER MUCH IMPROVED
Will Not Preach Again, However,
Until the Investigation Is En
tirely Concluded.
Rev. Dr. Brown is declared to be conva
lescent.
"While I have not seen Dr. Brown to
day," said Deacon Dexter, "I learn from
his family that he is greatly improved,
and will unquestionably be on hand when
the committee next convenes. He has
been advised by his physician to take
short walks during the day, and this will
no doubt be beneficial to him.
"The. statement published in a morning
paper to the effect'that the standing com
mittee held a secret conference about the
case after prayer-meeting last night is un
true. "We did meet, but only to transact
routine business, and Dr. Brown's name
was not mentioned."
Dr. Brown has a double.
Tbat there is a man that looks very
much like Dr. Brown seems to admit of
no further doubt. It was stated yester
day that this mysterious person, as elusive
as Elizabeth Jane Baddin, was likely to
cut fn important figure in the case. Dr.
Williams has seen the pastor's double,
and is prepared to affirm that such a char
acter exists.
"Twenty-five yards away," he said, "it
is practically impossible to tell the man
from Dr. Brown. I saw him across Mar
ket street a few days ago, and I exclaimed
to a friend, 'Why, there is Dr. Brown.' As
the man drew nearer, however, I saw my
mistake. He is slightly taller than the
pastor and less stooped, but it would be an
easy matter to mistake one for the other."
It will be recalled that some time ago
Mrs. Gillie, who runs a lodging-house on
Sixth street, near Howard, claimed to have
seen Dr. Brown enter a similar place just
across the way. It has been stated, since
this mysterious double came into exist
ence, that an effort will be made before
the investigating committee to show that
it was this man and not Dr. Brown who
was seen on Sixth street.
The members of the committee decline
to discuss this new phase of the case, say
ing that as yet the}* have no knowledge of
the evidence that is to be introduced.
Rev. Mr. Wikoff has finally decided to
act as a member of the investigating
committee. He addressed a letter to Dr.
Williams to that effect yesterday, asking
to be formally notified of the time and
place of the next meeting.
This practically assures a full meeting of
the committee as originally appointed,
with the exception of Deacon I. H. Morse,
who is still in Boston, looking up the
record of Dr. Brown's alleged blackmailer.
While the final policy of the committee
concerning the order in which the investi
gation is to be conducted has not been
agreed onâ fact, eren ' formally dis
cussed â the inquiry, according to a promi
nent member, will be substantially as
given below. "This idea 13 gathered,"
said the gentleman, "from remarks that
have been made at different times by
members during the three informal
meetings. Of course this programme may
be varied some little, but in the main it
will be closely followed.
"First, Dr. Brown will give his version
of the charges that have been brought
against him by Mrs. Davidson and Mrs.
Stockton. The minister has admitted
that he paid Mrs. Stockton $000, but he
will be asked to explain why this was
necessary if he was innocent of all wrong
doing. Dr. Brown will also be asked tne
direct question if he was the cause of Mrs.
Tunnell seeking a temporary hiding-place.
The fact that he sent for her the day fol
lowing the arrest of Mrs. Davidson and
that she remained at his house until
11:30 o'clock that night and then went to
Oakland, and later to Tulare County, in
stead of returning to her lodging-house on
Mission street is all well known to the
committee. Dr. Brown will be asked to
throw light on these matters.
"Miss Overman will then be given an op
portunity to explain not only the un
pleasant manner in which her name has
been coupled with that of Dr. Brown, but
also the charges that have been made
connecting her with several unpleasant
event's which are alleged to have occurred
in Tacoma, Spokane and other northern
cities.".
It is not thought probable by the com
mittee that Miss Overman will attempt to
deny the genuineness of the Tunnell
letters. "It is; barely possible," says one
member, "that she will acknowledge them
as hers, but in explanation will show that
they form a part of a general plot to first
extort money from Dr. Brown and then
bring about his ruin. How the committee
would receive such a confession as this
would depend altogether on the evidence
which she has to support it."*'
When Miss Overman and Dr. Brown
have completed their statements, Mrs.
Davidson will be invited from the branch
County Jail and given an opportunity to
tell what she knows of the affair. Mrs.
Thurston will then be called on and she
will be asked . to tell how and where she
got her information. This, it is thought,
will implicate Mrs. Tunnell again and
necessitate her presence before the com
mittee, if she can be found.
THE MADDEN DIVORCE.
It Came to an Abrupt .Ending Before
Judge Seaweil Yesterday.
The case of Madden against Madden
came to an abrupt termination before
Judge Seaweil yesterday. There was going
to be a default entered in the case of Henry
A. Madden, the defendant, and everything
was prepared for a speedy trial. Judge
Seaweil took his seat on the bench when
just then Walter Gallagher, attorney for
Mrs. Mary Madden, came into the court
room, took the papers in the case from the
table and vanished.
Then Martin Stevens. ". Maddens attor
ney, said" he would go and look for him,'
and then the plain tiff herself left the court

room in a hurry, and when the case was
called there was no one to answer. The
case was dropped from the calendar.
POLICE COURT CLERKS.
Their Position Under Argument in the
Superior Court.
The case of Alfred Morgenstern against
Ambrose Watson, to secure possession of
the office of clerk to Police Court 2 came
before Judge Troutt yesterday on a de
murrer filed by H. E. Higjiton to Morgen
stern's petition. The demurrer was argued
and submitted.
Mr. Highton contended that the Super
visors had no right to remove a man from
office except for cause and after a hearing.
He stud the Supervisors had power to fill
a vacancy but had not the power to make
one, and upon that ground he demanded
that Morten stern be not allowed to pro
ceed further against his client.
General Dickinson appeared for Morgan*
stern. He argued that the appointing
nower in filling a vacancy under existing
laws had the power to fill it at pleasure,
and the man so appointed could be re
moved when the appointing power saw fit.
He agreed with all Mr. Highton said about
the existing condition of politics, and that
was not a little, but he argued that under
the law in removing Watson and appoint
ing Morgenstern the Supervisors had done
no more than was right.
PAGE BROWN'S FUNERAL
The Last Service Wns Held Yesterday
at the Burlingame Home of
the Architect.
The funeral of A. Page Brown took place

CAPTAIN HEALY ON TRIAL.
Three Witnesses for the Prosecu-
tion Heard by the Court
of Inquiry.
Officers Assert That No Conspiracy
Exists to Down the Accused
Captain.
The court of inquiry appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury to investigate
the charges against Captain Healy of the
Bear convened at the Appraisers' building
at 10 o'clock a. si. yesterday and adjourned
at 4p. m. Twenty officers in undress uni
form awaited the pleasure of the court.
They had been called as witnesses lor the
prosecution, mainly.
The court is conducted with closed
doors, and the greatest secrecy is enjoined
on members of the court, counsel and wit
nesses. The . first business in hand
yesterday was to consider the objections
raised by counsel for Captain Healy that
the charges were not sufficiently set forth.
The court overruled the objections and de
cided to proceed to the examination of
witnesses.
The first witness called was Engineer
Jones of the Grant. He was followed on
the witness-sta-nd by Lieutenant Daniels
and Lieutenant Emery of the Bear. As
witnesses for the prosecution they adhered
to the charges promulgated, but it is not
known to wnat extent the cross-examina
tion weakened the force of direct testi
mony. It was the outside opinion of of
ficers generally that the force of direct
testimony could not be broken. The
theory that a conspiracy exists among the
officers to deprive Captain Healy of his
command and drive him from the service
is vigorously combated.
One officer remarked to a reporter:
"Look there at that group of a dozen offi
cers. Do they look like men who would
conspire against an old officer to bring
him into trouble? No ; they are honora
ble, upright men, who have at heart the
good of the service, and in this affair many
of tfiem have been misrepresented and
maligned. One officer, against whom
charges were preferred by the crew, was
the subject of inquiry and acquitted. It
was alleged and so published that he
was drunk for three days, but when the
inquiry established the fact that he was
sober and on duty and he was acquitted
and vindicated, only a line or two an
nounced the result."
Many of the officers present are from the
Grant, Corwin, Rush and Bern*. These
vessels were in Bering Sea last summer
when the Bear was in the Arctic, and all
are familiar, more or less, with the occur
rences of the summer cruise.
The cutters now in the Pacific service
are commanded as follows: Bear, Captain
Buhner; Grant, Captain Tozier ; Perry,
Captain H. D. Smith; Corwin, CaiMain
Munger; Wolcott, Captain Phillips; and
Rush, Captain Wadsworth.
The present court of inquiry is of special
interest to the officers of the fleet, because
it is the first one on the Pacific Coast to be
conducted according to the new regula
tions of the Treasury Department, which
went into effect two years ago. The regu
lations prescribe the form of hearing and
allow the accused to be represented by
counsel, who may cross-examine the wit
nesses for the prosecution and introduce
evidence in rebuttal. Civilians may be
called as witnesses, but they cannot be
compelled by any process of the court
to testify, and evidence so given by re
quest must be considered. An officer re
fusing to testify when called as a witness
may be punished by revocation of his com
mission.
At 4. o'clock, with due formality, the
court announced its adjournment until 10
a. m. to-day. Thereupon the officers in
waiting donned the attire of ordinary mor
tals and vanished.
A Surprise to Everybody.
What surprised the public most in con
nection with the Oakland Poultry 7 Show
was the fact that ex-Mayor Pierce, who
raises poulty, not as a business but as one
of his pastimes, should carry off the
honors and have his birds pronounced by
the most competent judgesâ such men as
L. K. Felch of Massachusettsâ the best
collection in the world. Especial reference
was made to the buff leghorns, a com
paratively new breed in this country. The
following was the list of prizes won'bv Mr.
Pierce: For buff leghorn pullets, "first,
second and third prizes; hens, lirst and
third; breeding pen, first; best ten buff
leghorns, first; special silver cup for best
cockerel; gold medal for best ten birds;
cold medal for best breeding pen. This
makes four out of five possible first prizes
and every special for which he competed.
A Forty-Third Anniversary.
Next Sunday afternoon at 3 o'clock in the
auditorium of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation, Mason and Ellis streets, the forty
third anniversary of the institution will be ob
served. Several of the City pastors will parti
cipate. The anniversary address will be de
livered by Rev. Bishop D. A. Goodscll of the

tet will sing, andthere will be orchestral
music to assist in the sacred song service pre
ceding the anniversary exercises. The ser
vice will be free to men and women, and the
public is Invited to attend. J. J. Valentine,
president of the association, will preside.
Presidio Guard Mounts.
There will be a guard mount, with concert,
at the J Presidio every day, including Sunday,
until further notice, beginning at 1 o'clock
each day.

JUST ARRIVED FROM MUNICH;
A Work 'of Art That Has Been
Modeled by Rupert
Schmid.
The entrance hall of the Red Men's j
building, on Post street, facing Union j
square, is about to be handsomely deco- I
rated in mahogany and adorned with a '
heroic bronze bust of Adam Smith, who
was the first great sachem of the Great
Council of California.
The bust, which was modeled by Rupert
Schmid, arrived a few days ago from
Munich, where the sculptor left it to be
cast during his recent visit to Eurone. The
order was given him soon after Adam
Smith's death, which occurred over a year
ago. The work of art has been pronounced
an excellent likeness by friends of the man
RUPERT SCHMID'S BUST OF ADAM SMITH.
". [Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
â 
who is regarded as the father of the Im
proved Order of Red Men in this State.
From 1870, when the plans for the build
ing on Post street were accepted, till the
time of his death, Adam Smith was presi
dent of the association and all the mem
bers looked upon him as a personal friend.
A little over a year ago, when he died, a
movement was at once started for per
petuating his memory. At first a monu
ment was thought of, but finally it was
decided that the best way to honor him
was to place his bust in the building over
which he had so long presided.
A committee of over fifty members,
which had been appointed from all the
tribes in the City and a few interior tribes,
having resolved that the memorial should
take the form of a bust, appointed the fol
lowing sub-committee to carry out the de
tails of the work: Dr. B. P. Josslyn, A.
Jackson, F. Brandt and H. S. Winn. The
latter gentleman, who was chosen presi
dent of the committee, assisted by Dr.
Josslyn and A. Jackson, assisted the
sculptor by advice and suggestions in ob
taining a good likeness, as Rupert Schmid
had never seen Adam Smith and had to
depend upon a photograph and the criti
cisms of friends of the late great sachem.
It is expected that the unveiling of the
bust will take place in about two weeks.
It will be placed at the end of the hall,
facing the entrance and close to the main
staircase. The wall behind the bust will
be paneled almost up to the ceiling with
polished mahogany. Over this will be a
mahogany arch, and in the niche the
bronze bust will be placed. The eyes will
be at a height of eight feet from the
ground, and to raise it to this elevation the
bronze bust will stand upon a shaft of dark
tinted veined marbie. The end of the hall
will be ornamented in unison with the
artistic commemorative design.
Elaborate ceremonies will be performed
at the unveiling, and it is expected not
only that the proceedings will be public
but that invitations will be extended to as
many visitors as the building is capable of
accommodating. -*â¢-,,-
STAMP INVESTIGATION.
Tho Postoffice Department -Exercised
Over the Presence of â¢â¢Duos" and
'â¢Periodicals" In Collections.
The Postoffice Department is much ex
ercised just at present over the large num
ber of due newspaper and periodical
stamps that have been discovered in the
collections of philatelists throughout the
country, and an investigation has been set
on foot to learn where the leak is and the
extent of the traffic in stamps. These
stamps are issued by the Postoffice De
partment to Postmasters only, and 'their
sale to the public is absolutely prohibited..
Therefore, their existence in the hands of
others than Postmasters can only be ac
counted for in an irregular way.
One thing that the department would
particularly like to know is how the com
plete unused sets of periodical stamps, not
only of the former issues but of tho pres
ent, are so common abroad. That a few
scattered ones should find their way into
the hands of collectors is not considered
strange, but it is a well-known fact among
the dealers of Paris and London that sets
can be obtained with the greatest ease, and
the source from which these come is what
the department is looking for.
It . has been learned that a Parisian
dealer recently, purchased three sets of
periodicals from an attache of a "Washing-'
ington legation, and from this" fact it is
believed that the leak is in the National
capital. ' " p
.'.-The fact 7 that these stamps are very
scarce among the smaller collections, of
which there are thousands throughout the
country, has made them valuable, the
price often being live, and even ten, times
the face value, and it is believed that some
Government employe has been feathering
his nest by selling them- at a premium to
dealers, who have in their turn made
handsome profits out of the collectors.
A- collector in this City, when asked
where he got some fine unused specimens
in his possession, stated that it was an
easy matter to obtain them if care was
taken to watch the appointments of new
Postmasters in country towns.
"As a general thing," he said, "all you
have to do is to go to a new country Post
master, who seldom has read the regula
tions and knows little of his duties, and
plank down your money with a demand
for the stamps. He usually gives them
up without a murmur. Then, of course,
the dealers have plenty of them, obtained
nobody knows how."
MUST REGISTER BIRTHS.
The Board of Health Will -Enforce the
State Law More Strictly Here
after. .
The poor showing made by San Fran
cisco in the comparative statement of the
births and deaths in the principal cities of
the United States compiled recently by
the Board of Health has led the health
officers to take strong measures to compel
physicians and mid wives to register births
according to law. The statutes provide
for the registration with , a penalty as
follows:
Section 2. Any person violating any of the
provisions of this order shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor, and be punished by a fine
not exceeding $100, or imprisonment not ex
ceeding ninety days, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
According to Secretary Godchaux of the
board, it is due entirely to the carelessness
of physicians and niidwives in failing to
comply with the law that the death rate
of this City is so large compared with the
number of registered births.
In the future the law will be more
strictly enforced, and those who persist in
disregarding its provisions will be brought
before the courts to explain their derelic
tion. y.-y-:p-:--'-y-4y/. L "-
WORK WILL NOW BEGIN
Contracts for the Construction of
the New Ferry Depot
Signed.
Bateman Bros. Ordered to Begin Work
at Once and Make a Test
Case of It.
The Harbor Commissioners had a very
quiet session yesterday, and came to an
amicable settlement with all the contrac
tors save two. These were theÃisdon Iron
Works and William Cronan, the former
being the lowest bidder for the ironwork
and the latter for the roofing. The direc
tors of the iron works are afraid that
freights will take a jump to-day, and that
as considerable of their material will have
to come from the East, they will lose
money. They want to be sure how the
railroad companies are going to treat
them before they enter into the contract.
Cronan is in the same box in regard to the
roofing, and he also asked for a delay of
twenty-four hours. f.*7.
Bateman Bros., who are to do the car
pentering, plastering and glazing, were
the first to file their bond. It is in the
sum of $'.'4,000, and C.S.Holmes and C.
Hanson "are the sureties. The firm was
instructed to begin work at once, and their
first bill will be the subject of a test case
to the Supreme Court. 'ypzzAyPppy
James Duffy, who has the contract for
the plumbing and gas-fitting, gave a bond
for $5500, with the American Surety Com
pany on his bond. George J. Smith <fc Co.,
$6500, painting,, had John and James
Tread well as sureties, while C. F. Mc-
Carthy. & Co. (the Pacific Bridge Com
pany), who are to do the stone and ma
sonry work, gave a bond in the sura of
$115,000, with R. W. Gorrill and A. M.
Simpson as sureties. The work on the
building will now begin at once and will
be pushed ahead. ~ ';_'â..
During the recent storm the steam
schooner Point Arena ran into Mission
street wharf and damaged it to the extent
of $51 60. It was decided to send a bill to
the owners for the amount.
The bill of $25 20 which had been charged
to W. It. Larzelere & Co. for the wharfage
on potatoes stored on Jackson-street
wharf, the Commissioners decided not to
rebate. As Larzelere has squared his
accounts 'with the farmers he wiil be the
amount of the wharfage out of pocket.
McNab & Smith again sought to recover
$60 for d-.n_.a__e done to one of their trucks
by an engine on the belt road running into
it. McNab's foreman insisted that the en
gineer to blame and the foreman of
the State's freight depot was equally con
fident that it was the driver of the truck
who was in fault. As the State had no
lights on the crossing and no brakeman on
the end of the freight train it was decided
to take the advice of the board's attorney
before doing anything in the matter. 'â â¢:.'

SEVEN YEARS AND A HERO
A Romance of Natoma Street
and the Children's
Hospital.
FLAYED FOR A BABY SISTER.
Little Elnor Moore, a Black â¢ Eyed
Rogue, Bravely Beats the Skin.
Grafting Record.
The Children's Hospital away out on
California street has woven as beautiful a
little story of childish heroism and nobility
as ever charmed a human ear or bettered
a human heart.
The hero is little Elnor Moore, aged 7
years, who lies in one of the snowy cots in
one of the clean white wards out there,
because he volunteered to let the doctors
cut great strips of skin eight inches in
length from down the front of both his
vigorous little legs, that his baby sister,
who was terribly scalded a few weeks ago,
might stop crying at the pain of her
almost hopeless wounds and not be a
cripple for life.
It's down on Natoma street between
Sixth and Seventh that the Moores live.
Since nine years ago four children have
come to Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Moore.
Next to tbe oldest is Elnor, and next to
the youngest is Josie, who will be 4 years
old in May.
Josie is the thin, wan, wasted little
thing that now lies in one position week
after week in the hospital, wearily crying
when her wounds are dressed, and often
between times. Three months ago she
was a chubby baby, nearly as tall and as
heavy as her 9-year-old sister, and as full
of gay romping as any baby.
Ten weeks ago she was suddenly taken
ill. There was the usual excitement. The
baby was put in a little bathtub, but some
body, in the excitement, picked up the
wrong kettle and pouted boiling water over
the child. Its side and a portion of the
back, including one leg, were terribly
scalded. For two or three weeks a doctor
attended the case at the home, but the
burns healed slowly and other complica
tions set in, including symptoms of pneu
monia. The doctor pronounced the case
hopeless unless it was taken to the Chil
dren's Hospital, and a few weeks ago little
Josie went there, with small prospect of
reaching her fourth birthday.
A large portion of the scalded surface
refused to heal.
Skin grafting was the only remedy, but
the baby was so sick otherwise that it
could not be safely resorted to until ten
days ago.
The mother, who walked out to see her
baby on visitors' days, was told that some
body would have to be found to supply
the needed skin, and she offered herself,
but she was told that it should be a
younger person. They wore talking about
it at home without any thought of the
children there when Elnor said:
"Why, mamma, they can have me. I
aint afraid."
The boy is a black-eyed little fellow
with a roguish style, and at school, at
home a. id among the neighbors he is ever
lastingly getting into trouble. He
often makes the women scowl with
despairing impatience., and he has to
endure being called a "holy terror" some
timesâbut he went out to the Children's
Hospital ten days ago.
He eagerly went in to see his little sister,
who brightened up a bit, and then they
took him away, kept him out of mischief
for a day and gave him three baths. The
operation was performed a week ago yes
terday. One of the nurses picked upthe
frail little sufferer from her cot and car
ried her into an operating-room and laid
her down on a leather-covered operating
table, with queer cranks and things about it.
Then little Elnor came in and they un
dressed him and fixed him on another
operating- The mother was not al
lowed to be present.
But Elnor Moore was manly, serious
and obedient, and there was not a hesita
tion or a whimper. They were honest
with him, and explained just how big
would be the patches of skin they would
cut from his legs, and he understood what
it was for, and that he would not know
what was going on after he breathed some
thing that smelt funny, and if he had
wanted to back out at the last moment he
could have done so.
The nurse that had been taking care of
little Jessie for weeks stayed in the ward.
They told the boy hero that if he would
just shut his eyes and breathe through
the sponge he would go to sleep and sleep
until it was all over, and he composedly
shut his eyes and resigned himself" to the
sacrifice for the little sister near his side,
When the operation was over they had
deftly shaved from the front of the boy's
legs several strips of skin one inch wide
and eight inches long, and when the boy
woke up he was a patient himself and he
lay on his back, with bandages and sooth
ing preparations where the knife had
been. The baby girl was a long time re
covering consciousness, but several hours
later she opened her eyes feebly.
She faced her brother as she lay, and
she seemed pleased and quieted at'seeing
him so near.
Little Elnor was delighted at the report
that everything was all right and that bis
sister would get well now. Two or three
days ago he heard that, it was possible that
a little more skin might be needed for his
sister's wound and he promptly said that
if they wanted more he would go through
it again. Ap/A.
The doctors who know all about the case
say that little Josie will get well and that
she will be able to walk before a great
many weeks.
Elnor is so nearly well that it is hard to
keep him in his cot now ana he expects to
go home on Sunday. His legs don't hurt
him now and he is a trifle irrepressible in
his anxiety to get a little fun out of his
ward while staying at the hospital.
DEATH OF MRS. DEMING.
The Wife of H. V. Doming Dies In Paris
From the Effects of Roman
-Fever.
The news of the death of Mrs. Mary
Deming in Paris has been received in this

BOWMAN WRITES
AGAINST ROME.
From the Standpoint of the
American Protective
Association.
"ROME A NATIONAL FOE."
Further Comparisons Between
the Pilgrims and Monte
zuma's Conquerors.
REV. YORKE TO J. S. HITTELL.
The Priest Replies to the Historian.
Regarding the Authenticity of
Quotations.
W. H. Bowman, editor of the American
Patriot, submits the following* communi
cation to the religious controver sy :
Office of the axeiucan Patriot, (
8 19 Market .street. J
To the Editor of the San FuatciSCO -Callâ Dear.
Sir: There is no use disguising the> fact that
Romanism is our National foe. Priest Pnelan
says; "1 frankly confess that the Catholics
stand before the country as the enemies of the
public schools." An enemy of free education
is an enemy of the Nation. lie is a base
traitor and an unsafe citizen. He who would
undermine our school system has not the wel
fare of the country at heart.
Education is Indispensable in a republican
form of government. Ignorance and Roman
ism go hand in hand. They flourish in loving
compact. Romanism can no more exist In
the light than can darkness. The golaen age
of Romanism was the dark age of history.
And the zenith of her power was in the dark
est age of the dark ages. Like the owls that
screech and hoot in the darkness, against the
light, the Papal priests cry out against real ed
ucationthe enlightenment of our public
school system. When Rome claims the rigot
to ignore the teaching of children in the Eng
lish languageâ and thus insulating them from
our American press, platform and pulpitâ and
allowing those who are to become our future
citizens and voters to grow up in ignorance of
the great principles of Americanism she vio
lates both the written and unwritten law of
our country which requires all our citizens to
be loyal Americans.
Americans, remember this: In encouraging
the Papacy in its educational policy the Roman
Catholic youth of the Nation are subjected to
the heartless tyranny of superstition and
trained in disloyalty. The Papal expectation
Is that Romish education will raise up a gener
ation that shall he ready for revolution
against all rights, civil, social and personal, to
be found resisting the supremacy of Rome.
Rome is the foe of civilization. Romanism
blocks the wheels of civilization, muzzles the
press, gags the mouth of free speech, obstructs
the free circulation of the Bible, seeks to pre
vent all systematic provision for general edu
cation, and keeps her masses in darkness and
superstition. The fact that so many nations
have dated their social and political decline in
the scale of civilization and moral grandeur
from the maintenance of Romish error and the
dissemination of Papal principles ought to be
a warning to America. It would be a case of
political suicide to allow it to gain the ascend
ency here.
Modern civilization must consent to abandon
the career oi advancement which has given it
so much power and happiness, or meet Roman
ism 1:1 a conflict tor supremacy. To Romanize
America would be to ruin America. It would
be to telescoDe the nineteenth century into the
tenth. Its civilization would be modeled after
the semi-barbarism, the ignorance aud super
stition of the middle ages.
Shame on the cringing coward who would
submit to the dictation of a power which
blocked the wheels of progress in Europe for
many centuries, by ferociously suppressing by
the stake and sword every new thought, every
progressive idea, and every reformatory utter
ance! The old humbug of the Tiber claims
divine authority, yet can present no adequate
credentials of his office.
For years Rome has been using all of her gi
gantic machinery as a brake on the heels of
modern progress. She would handicap sci
ence, blindfold reason and benumb conscience.
Shall we ahow her to banish public education,
put a stop to the reading of the Bible, and to
muzzle the press? To control all the agencies
of civilization is her chief ambition. Home is
the foe of civil liberty, hence a menace to our
Republic. Civil liberty takes the individual
out from under the control of the priest and
the Pope. It grants the right of private judg
ment to all. But Kome cannot tolerate such a
privilege. To do so would ruin her whole
system. The temporal power of the Pope is in
compatible with republican liberty. Kome
has strangled freedom at its birth when she
could and murdered it wherever she has had
the opportunity. There can be no civil free
dom without meutal freedom, and the dogmas
of Rome make her devotees mental slaves. The
confessional-box is the sepuicher of liberty.
The slave of the Vatican is not a free man.
Kome is the foe of civic virtue. Romanism
Is ecclesiastical anarchism. .She opposes all
moral reforms. She never advocates the pur
ity of the ballot, the necessity of clean politics.
Her very sytem of political intrigue and
Jesuitical plotting makes her the friend of po
litical immorality and the foe of good citizen
ship. She uses the saloon as her ally in gain
ing power. Hence when you fight Kome you
fight rum. and when you fight rum you light
Rome. They are Siamese twins of evil. Rome
is a crafty foe. She curses in secret and blesses
in public. She hurls her anathemas from her
altars at heretics, but behaves like a weaned
child before her critics. When weak she is
tolerant; when strong she" is tyrannical. She
persuades as- a friend before she curses as a
toe. She deludes or devours. She professes
friendship, while an enemy at heart. She
plots in secret and smiles in public.
Rome Is loud }n her professions of loyalty,
and yet seeks to train our future citizens in
ignorance a.id disloyalty. With satanic cun
ning and educated hypocrisy her minions
cover up their abominable work and seek to
divert attention and allay suspicion. They '
will accept toleration when they cannot get
more. They will claim equality where it is
possible, and assert supremacy where they
dare. Rome will betray with a Judas kiss.
Like Joab she will give the friendly greeting
and then plunge her dagger into the heart of
liberty. Friendship is only a mask, and reli
gion a cloak to cover up her base designs. â¢ Her
history has been one long catalogue of in
triguing and plotting, of craity tricks and cun
ning schemes. â¢ It is an act of folly to trust her
pretensions of friendship for our country.
Rome is a dishonest foe. There is honor
among thieves, but none in Romanism. They
are ruled by policy instead of principle.
Truth is a stranger to the whole system. It is
a system of deception. It is founded on false
hood and reared by fraud. It is an arsenal of
lies. Lying explanations given to God's word,
dishonest reports about men who have leit her
filthy embrace, incredulous miracles and lying
legendsâ such as men sailing in the air and
picking up their heads after they were decapi
tated and carrying them under their armsâ
with all the fraud and swindle of purgatory
and transsubstantiation, all prove that Rome
should have the belt as champion prevari
cator. By the doctrine of mental reservation,
â¢which justifies the lie on the lip by the truth
in the intellect, she stands condemned as dis
honest before the world.
Romish priests pose as the friends of educa
tion; but they mean education in Romish doc
trines by Romish instructors. It is the ability
to repeat tne catechism and say Aye Marias
and Hail Marys that they consider a true edu
cation. IV hen a Papal prelate waxes eloquent
over "freedom of conscience," "he is speak
ing of the 'right to embrace, profess and prac
tice the Catholic religion.*" "Chastity,' in a
bishop, priest or nun, means the license of lust
under the guise of celibate abstinence. To
"tell lies for the glory of God" is what they re
gard as speaking the truth. To steal for the
benefit of the church is pure honesty and
Faintly virtue. In fact, lying is a fine art and
dishonesty a science in the Romish church
Priestly justification for lying is an indisputa
ble fact. Romanism may have some truth
about it, but it is madness to put a viper in
your bosom because of its gay coat.
Rome is now trying to hide her dark history
by fraudulent and dishonest methods. She'
has established a censorship over the press to
conceal facts. She has forced publishers to
alter the truths of history, to garble diction
ary definitions, remodel articles in cyclo
pedias and lessons In scboolbooks under threat
of the dreaded boycott. Some one may ask the
question, What has their dishonesty got to do
with their citizenship? Just this much: The
privileges of citizenship carry with them the
duties of the citizen. But Romanists are un
able to render the duties they owe to the Gov
ernment. The Romish priesthood, whose theo
logical training consists in learning the art of
falsehood and deception, teach them that they
may perjure themselves for the glory of God,
and that their duty to the Pope severs their
obligation to the President. Under such in
struction it Is no Bin to be a tractor to' their
country. At a banquet in Wasnington the
toast "The Pope!' came first on the programme
and tnat of "Our President" second.
Rome Is a sleepless foe. She is wideawake to
her interests. She watches her chances. While
Uncle Sam slept she wound the threads of ec
clesiastical despotism around him, like the
Liliputians did to Gulliver of old. Rome keeps
her eve open and watches current events.
She keeps her linger on Uncle Sam's pulse so as
to be aware of any symptom of patriotic fever.
Her priestly buzzards feed on political carrion.
They swoop down on cities that revel in politi
cal tilth. Rome watches with unceasing vigi
lance the bills that are introduced in Congress.
No legislation inimical to her interests can
pass if she can help it. very measure to aid
â¢ her she pushes to the front. She is constantly
working to increase her power. To meet her
we must wake up. We must be as vigilant in
the interests of America as she is of Rome.
Rome is an unreasoning foe. She is In
trenched in ignorance. If we could meet and
calmly discuss the merits of the question with
our Romanist citizens, and they had the priv
ilege to abide by the dictates of reason and
common-sense, it would soon be decided in
our favor. But they are not allowed to use
their reason. The use of reason is religious
treason with them. It is the fact of the ig
norance of the great mass of Papists that
makes them so formidable. Stones would
answer argument, bullets discount logic and
truth be silenced by brute force. In the broad
arena of thought Rome would stand no chance
to win.' To reason with a Papal mob is casting
pearl before swine. It is their ignorance that
â makes them foes. Give them a chance to
think for themselves aud they would cease to
be the dupes of priests.
Rome is an impudent foe. The brazen au
dacity and superlative impudence of Romanism
stagger belief. Fraudulent claims, assumed
power and unjustifiable encroachments on
other's rights stamp Romanism as the incarna
tion of impudence. For hypocritical preten
sions it cannot be beaten. Priestly bluster it
can always muster. For depth of gall the Pope
beats them all.
We intend calling attention to some of the
malicious and audacious utterances of Ro
manists concerning America's best people.
The Catholic Sentinel of Philadelphia, com
menting some years since upon the sermon of
Mr. MeCalla, an eminent Presbyterian minis
ter, who eulogized New England, thus reflected
upon that great people:
-'Their minds are warped by fanaticism,
darkness and bigotry, and vitiated by the
abhorred and atrocious principles inculcated
by the vice of sanguinary wretches called the
Pilgrim Fathers."
When we consider the fact that the Roman
ists who first settled in America drenched its
soil in Mood, we can gather a faint idea of such
an Impudent assertion. The Pilgrim Fathers
sought this land that they might have "the free
dom to worship God," while Rome colonized
for weaLth and plunder. Mexico settled by
Romanists land of sunshine and flowers, of
rich mines and tropical beauty â cursed and
blighted. While the bleak, barren and sterile
coasts of New England, colonized by Puritans,
has molded the destiny of the United States and
produced men whose names adorn history's
scrol' . New England, overrun by foreign im
migrants, -while Mexico has to offer $50 a head,
and not get hardly any.
Take the vile slanders relative to our public
.school system,. such as that they are "pits of
corruption," "nurseries of hell," "and have
' produced nothing but a godless generation of
thieves and blackguards." Considering the
fact that the largest per cent of our criminal
classes are Romanists the papal gall is at once
manifest in the utterance of such a slanderous
charge against the public school system. If
our schools nursed Romanism they would have
told the truth when charging them with being
the "nurseries of hell," but seeing they do not
we brand the statement as a falsehood.
The Pilot, a Romish sheet printed in Boston,
calls the Americans "common liars, detainers
and vagabonds." Charity might suggest that
it was giving a pen picture or" the members of
its own communion, but as the word Ameri
can is used to denote the native Protestant
element we will have to let the charge stand
as written. Impudence is part 01 a- priest's
stock in trade. Without it he would be lost.
The superlative height of impudence is
reached in claiming absolute power in earth,
heaven and hell for the Pope. Such an absurd
idea can only be maintained by the audacious
assumptions and the Jesuitical conniving of
men whose brazen cheek would shame a Gov
ernment mule. 11. W. Bowman.
FATHER YORKE ON HITTELL.
Concerning: Some of Those Quota
tions Made by Dr. Wendte From
the Historian.
Father Yorke contributes the following
brief letter in answer to Mr. Hittell, the
historian :
January 23, 1896.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dsab Sir: Mr. John
P. Hittell evidently cultivates a grateful spirit.
He wrote this morning:
I than-. Father Yorice for proving that I com
mitted forgery by quoting Doeliiuger correctly, by
understanding Doeliinger to hold Aquinas respon
sible lor the Linus written by his partner In a book
which the two composed conjointly, ami by bri fly
and indirectly asserting that responsibility, which
I supposed 1 could assert safely since the idea is
one implied in many passages of the writings of
Aquinas.
For the benefit of those of your readers who
may have no memory for dates permit me to
remark.
Thomas Aquinas died on March 7.
1274.
Secondâ ln the place quoted by Hittell Doel
iinger says that Tolomeo did not' begin to write
until after 1298.
Thirdâ he could have "composed con
jointly" with a man who had been dead a
quarter of a century Mr. Hittell does not ex
plain.
And this is the accurate, fair, judicial, "Prot
estant scholarship" to which Dr. Wendte pins
his faith. Did 1 say too much when I de
nominated John S. Hittell, historian, as the
greatest humbug of this or any other age?
Yours truly, P. C. Yokke.
A TRIUMPH OVER ART
Lithographer Bosqui Walks
Away With a Prize Offered
to Painters.
Result of the Competition Over the
Design for a Mardi Gras Invi
tation Ticket.
Lithography has triumphed over art,
and the knights of the brush are pretty
much stirred up over it.
Had it not been for the generosity* of the
Art Association it might never have hap-
pened; but the glad hand went forth only
to be grabbed by the man who engages in
the occupation of lithographing designs as
well as creating them.
The whole affair began by the Art Asso
ciation offering a prize of. $20 to the artist
who would make the best design for an in
vitation ticket to the mardi-gras ball to be
given at the Hopkins mansion on Califor
nia street in the near future..
The artists who were invited to submit
designs, of, rather, who were â¢ expected to
offer something, were Arthur Mathews, J.
A. Stanton, Amadee Joullin, Emile Pissis,
Ernest Peixotto and some others. Strangely
enough, Mr. Stanton and Mr. Pissis, be
ing busy with the Arts and Crafts Exhibi
tion, made no attempt to carry off the
cash, but the others mentioned X sat up
nights and had colorful nightmares over
the matter. , y / P/tp
After considerable thinking and mental
eruption all three cot down to work and
turned out something that was guaranteed
to unhorse the committee on award and
establish a ; new school of design. The
products are said to nave been exception
ally.high grade and commensurate with
the magnificence of the Mardi Gras.
In the meantime Mr. Bosqui, one of the
directors of the association and incident
ally a well-known lithographer of this
City, 1 was preparing his designers with
ideas that were intended to overcome any
thing turned out by the artists. He made
very little noise about it, but when the
specimens were handed in Mr. Bosqui
was right in the thick of the . bunch and
laid his little exhibit carefully before the
committee. .
He had nothing particular to say and
the specimen or design spoke for itself.
After reasonable deliberation and some
thought it was announced that the litho
graphic design had won the $20 and that
Mr. Bosom was the lucky gentleman. .
Mr. Mathews, Mr. Joullin and Mr. Piex
otto saidâ it is not known definitely
just what they did sayâ but whatever it
was they said it in about the same man
ner that Mr. Whistler adopts when he re
fers to the author of "Trilby." '/â â 
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1896.
A PHILOSOPHIC BURGLAR
The Capture of George Paul
Debuss a Very Important
One.
ROOM FILLED WITH PLUNDER.
Five Burglaries Already Traced to
Him and There Is Suspicion
About Several More.
George Paul Debuss, alias George Paul,
alias Charles Miller, who was at first be
lieved to be an amateur burglar, has
turned out to be one of the most daring
and accomplished in the profession.
Early Thursday morning of last week he
entered the residence of General Dimond
on Taylor and Washington streets, but
was scared away before taking any plunder
by Mrs. Paul Jarboe, who was awakened
by the noise he made in her bedroom.
Policeman Amos Williams happened to
be close by at the time and arrested the
burglar. A "jimmy" and a revolver were
found in the prisoner's pockets.
On Monday Debuss was booked for at-

tempt at burglary and for having burglars'
tools in his possession* Since then Police
men Williams and E.J. Wren have been
working on the case and they have found
that Debuss had for" the past year been
living in a house on Dupont street, be
tween Pacific and Broadway. They
searched his room, and in two large
valises and trunks they found a large
quantity of silverware, clothing and other
articles, the proceeds of numerous bur
glaries.
The articles were taken to police head
quarters, and among those who identified
property were Mrs. Samuel Ostroski, 11.14
Geary street; Mrs. A. M. Parrott, 517 .Sut
ter street; Colonel E. A. Denicke, south
west corner of Sacramento and Mason
streets, and Captain Samuel Blair, 1315
Van Ness avenue.
Mrs. Ostroski's residence was entered on
December 21, Mrs. Parrott's on December
20, Colonel Denicke's on December 21, and
Captain Blair's on November 25. There is
still a lot of silverware unidentified.
At the lodging-house on Dupont street
Debuss was looked upon as a quiet, indus
trious and honest man, and the landlady
was very much surprised and indignant
when told that he "was a burglar. The
police think he is the lone burglar who
has given them so much annoyance of
late. lie is 41 years of age, short and
stoutly built and a native of Germany.
Several addresses of houses, apparently
for future use, were written on a pocket
slate found among the papers. Some
have been partly. obliterated, but there are
three distinguishable. They are 1..17 Ellis
street, 291tT Sacramento street, 827 Fell
street.
Debuss is a bit of a philosopher. Among
his papers was found the following effu
sion, which very much resembles the kind
of literature that Murderer Fredericks was
so fond of writing:
December 31, 1894.
Three vices I have had in my life past. They
are well known to me, never to be forgotten.
They have kept me in chains and these chains
I am about to throw off and free myself for
ever. Mv parents who brought me into this
world forced the first and most serious on to
me, about the same time nature forced the
second on to me, ana the third my own vanity
and a corrupt world to give the first two a
mate, I suppose, done the rest. I am like a
being coming from another planet to this cor
rupt world with different ideas, manners, etc.;
in short, I am just the opposite what these
creatures are, for I have never found one ideal
among the millions I have met. _>
I will not let my plans be known to any one
for the simple reason they are not understood,
hence I must be the silent man. But they
shall feel me so much the more. Ido not ac
knowledge any religion; they are all frands.
But
There Is an eternal God
Whose presence bright
All space does occupy,
All motions guide
Unchanged through time's
All devastating flightâ
An only God -. there is no
God beside.
Philosophers in their sublime research may
measure out the ocean deep, may count the
sands or rise of sun, but God, for thee there is
no weigh or measure. None can mount up to
thee, mystery's Reasons, bright est spark; Being
above all Beings, Mighty One, whom none can
compare and none explore â who forms exist
ence with Himself alone.
The following, headed "resolution," was
also found among his papers:
September 29, 1895.
I will from this day work and save every
cent I have to labor for. It must be my iron
bound duty to meet all expenses from sale of
clothes or whatever I can convert into money.
After I am completely out I must manage to
live from the interest of my money, which I
will pat in bank as soon as I get it. O. P. D.
Debuss refuses to talk about his arrest.
He says he has been twelve years in this
City, working sometimes as a cook and
sometimes as a waiter. The police so far
know nothing of his past history, but are
making inquiries.
LOCATING LAND LINES.
Agent T. Y. Gendine of Washington
Struggling With a Kelic of the
.Benson' Frauds.
Thomas Y. Gendine, special agent of
the Interior Department, Washington, D.
C, is at the Occidental.
He has been traveling in California for
some time, and making investigations in
connection with the Benson land frauds.
He has lately come from Los Angeles
County, where some of these . lands are,
and where he has been examining into the
subject of land grants. He says that ac
cording to the Benson surveys the tracts
of land did not come out right, bounda
ries in many cases being, yet matters of
dispute. The United States courts took a
hand at settling them, and made certain
declarations and delivered decisions in re
gard to them. v#Sg^^6*i'-- ;..'â "
Still the matter keeps bobbing up. It is
constantly being shown that the premises
on which the court based its decisions were
wrong. ......
Though the Benson indictments have
been settled, the lands are therefore still
subject to adjudication, so * far as the
boundaries are concerned, by the depart
ment.. . ... *
The land which Agent Gendine has ex
amined is in the foothills of Los Angeles
County. Agent Gendine is from Georgia.
CONGRESS AND ROADS.
Our Representatives at Washington
Urged to Aid a Bill for a National
Commission on Highways.
A bill to create a special commission on
highways has recently been read in the
House of Representatives and has been re
ferred to the Committee on Appropria
tions.
The local highway improvement com
mittee, L. A. \V\, has just received a copy
of the bill from the office of the State Bu
reau of Highways and the result is that
both organizations have decided to urge by
personal letters to each of California's Rep
resentatives, in Congress that efforts be
made to have the bill adopted.
In addition to a proposed appropriation
of $10,000 to the use of the National Com
mission for the first year and a provision
by which the commission is empowered to
meet in different States in conjunction
with the existing State road organizations
the substance of the bill reads as follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of Amer
ica in Congress assembled, that a special com
mission on highways is hereby created, which
shall be composed of one Senator of the United
States, to be appointed as the Senate may pro
vide; two members of the House of Represen-
tatives, appointed by the Speaker; the chief of
engineers of the army; the director of the geo
logical survey, and the chief of road inquiry of
the Department of Agriculture.
This commission to report irom time to time,
by bill or otherwise, and to continue until
final report is made, but not beyond the pres
ent Congress.
It shall be the duty of this commission to
inquire generally how the Government may
further promote the improvement of highways,
and among other things to consider the ex
pediency of and best methods of providing for,
(1) The scientific location of highways on the
public domain. (2) The employment of the
Geological Survey in the discovery of road
materials. (3) The frey testing of all road
materials offered. (4) Construction of model
roads aid instruction in road making at agri
cultural colleges and experiment stations.
(5) The same at the military academy and
when practicable at all institutions having a
military instructor.
The commission shall confer with tho Inter
state Commerce Commission and with leading
railway officials concerning a general reduc
tion of transportation rates on road materials.
MAYOR ASKED TO VETO
Cemetery Associations JArgue
Against the Burial Lot
Ordinance.
Mr. Sutro Will Give the Matter Careful
Attention Before Affixing His
Signature.
A large delegation of representatives of
the Cemetery Associations called on Mayor
Sutro yesterday and ur_;ed him to veto the
ordinance recently passed by the Board of
Supervisors prohibiting the sale of burial
lots within the limits of the City and
County.
Messrs. Gray, Burling, Gunnison and
Crowell appeared for the Laurel Hill Asso
ciation, Messrs. Cowdery, Bohen, and
Fletcher for the Odd Fellows', and Messrs.
Davis, Sumner, Stetson and Wliittier for
the other associations.
They declared that the ordinance was a
farce on its face, as it would not accom
plish the object for which it was intended,
and would at the same time work a hard
ship on the associations. They declared
that the prohibiting of the sale of burial
lots would not stop burials within the
City limits, as the ground already disposed
of would accommodate 80,000 graves if not
another foot was sold. At the same time
the cemeteries would be deprived of the
source of revenue which keeps them in
good condition, it was contended that
legislation of this character was invalid,
and would not stand in the courts.
Attention was called to the cemeteries
at the Presidio, and the Mayor was asked
whether he was willing to precipitate a
clash with the National authorities by
signing the order. Messrs. Gray and Sum*
ner argued that the cemeteries were not
'injurious to the public health; that the
mortality in the districts, in which they
are situated is less than in other sections
of the City, and that many poor people are
in the habit of visiting them for the pur
pose of resting and breathing purer air
than is to be found in the crowded streets.
Mayor Sutro intimated that while he
considered the cemeteries a menace to the
public health and favored burials outside
of the City limits he thought the associa
tions should not be crowded in the matter,
and that they might be given further time
to hunt other locations before their reven
ues are cut off.
The cemetery, representatives called at
tention to the fact that people living west
of the burial grounds the ones Who are
advocating the ordinanceâ bought their
property with the full knowledge that the
cemeteries would be located where they
are. They stated in their defense that the
associations had paid the City $25,000 for a
deed to the land in 1871. It was shown
that the Odd Fellows have thirty-four lots
left unsold, Masonic Cemetery twenty
seven and Laurel Hill sixty. f. V- â¢-'
The Mayor, after hearing all the argu
ments, said the associations might have
vested rights which the Supervisors could
not overlook, and that ;â¢ he would look
carefully into the- matter' before deciding
whether or not to veto the ordinance.
Moved Their. Advertising -Department.
Owing to the increase of the work devolving
upon the advertising department of the South
ern Pacific Company, which is in - charge of A.
C. Jackson, it has been removed from the sec
ond floor of the building at the corner of Mar
ket and Montgomery streets to some of the
unoccupied rooms in the old building at the
corner of fourth and Townsend streets. *
IN HAMMOND'S BEHALF
The Gold Mining Exchange Calls
for a Mass Meeting
To-Morrow.
THE GENEROSITY OF CURTIS.
The Imprisoned Californian's Friends
Kept the Wires Hot Demand
ing a Fair Trial.
The Gold Mining Exchange of San Fran
cisco held a special meeting in the assem
bly-room of the Mills building yesterday
afternoon and took formal action looking
to the proper administration of justice in
the case of John Hays Hammond and
other American citizens now in prison as
a result of the Transvaal invasion.
The Curtis cablegram, published in The
Call yesterday, bad much to do with
arousing the California friends of Mr.
Hammond to immediate and definite ac
tion.
The meeting yesterday was largely at
tended, and the liveliest interest was dis
played in tbe proceedings. President
Walter Turnbull presided.
Geneial Harris, who is an uncle of John
Hays Hammond, set forth the condition
of affairs which surrounds the accused.
He said that it was impossible to get any
direct communication with Hammond, as
the Transvaal Government had doubtless
applied the censorship. . :.,:â ':;.
M. F. Tarpey offered the following reso
lution :
Whereas, A number of American citizens of
California have been arrested and imprisoned
by the authorities of the South African republic,
charged with complicity in the recent armed
invasion of that country; and
Whereas, from our Knowledge of the men
so charged, their high character, their educa
tion and standing, we do not believe that they
are guilty of the grave offense for which they
have been arrested, arid for which they are to
be tried ; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the Gold Mining Exchange of
San Francisco at a called meeting at the City
of San Francisco on this 23d day of January,
1890, that our Senators and Representatives
in Congress be urged to take immediate action
in behalf of our imperiled citizens, and that if
they are to be tried in a foreign land under
such grave charges, it De urged upon the au
thorities at Washington that this Government
be represented at such trial or trials by a rep
resentative learned in tne law who will de
mand a lair and impartial hearing for each of
the accused ; and be it further
Resolved, ".That the secretary of this meeting
telegraph copies of the resolutions to each of
our Senators and Representatives at Washing
ton.';â¢â¢:. â 
The resolution was unanimously
adopted, as was the following, offered by
Colonel Smedberg:
Whereas, the Gold Mining Exchange of San
Francisco desires to express its sympathy in
behalf of John Hays Hammond and other
American citizens, who, we are informed, are
detained in prison in South Africa. Therefore
be it
Resolved, That the Gold Mining Exchange of
San Francisco requests the Governor of our
State and th* Mayor and all citizens of our
City to assemble In the rooms of the Chamber
of Commerce of San Francisco on Saturday,
January 25, 1890, at 2 o'clock v. M., to con
sider tne matter in question and to take such
steps as may be deemed wise and proper toward
ameliorating the condition of Mr. Hammond
and other fellow-citizens who- are imprisoned
in the Transvaal.
The chair was empowered to appoint a
committee of three to take the subject
matter of these resolutions in hand, and
call the meeting if the necessity of the
case demanded such action.
The committee appointed consists of W.
R. Smedberg (chairman), P. T. Dickinson
and Louis Glass. ,' "4/ V.

REALTY SOLD AT AUCTION.
Baldwin & Hammond Hold a
Successful Sale of City
Property.
Pacific Improvement Company's Lands
Brought Fair Pricesâ A Large
Sum Realized.
The auction sale of property belonging
to the Pacific Improvement Company at
tracted a large crowd yesterday to the
salesroom of Baldwin & Hammond. The
result of the sale was eminently satisfac
tory to the auctioneers and the owners of
the property, the prices, inmost instances,
being ve.'y good. .
Before commencing the sale of the Pa
cific Improvement property, there were
sold, under order of court, twelve houses
on Stevenson street, between Seventh and
Eighth, renting for $292 a month, for
$28,000. 7
After this property was disposed of, the
sale of the lots belonging to the Pacific
Improvement Company began, the first
lot offered being the southwest corner of
Fifteenth and Valencia streets, 40x137:6,
which started at $10,000, and quickly ran
up to $13,250, at which price it was sold.
Lots 4 and 5 on Valencia street, 90 feet
south of Fifteenth street, were sold for
$4600 each. Lot 2 on Valencia street, 25x
137:6, adjoining the corner, was sold for
$4525, and lot 3, same size, brought $4400.
A largo lot on Fifteenth street, 53:4x150
feet, was sold for $5800, with the improve
ments, which rent for $33 per month. The
lot on the southeast corner of Fifteenth
street and : Albion avenue, 104:8x108,
brought $8900. . On Albion avenue the lot
62x104:8 brought $4000. Three other
lots on Valencia street, two of them
25x90 feet each, brought $3900 apiece
and one lot, 22:6x90 feet, sold
for $3600.. On. the northeast corner of
Valencia and Hermann '. streets the lot
49:10^x71:6 brought $19,250. Immediate
ly in the rear of this lot two lots, each
42:8x49:10>-:, sold for $3000 and $3200 re
spectively. The lot 28:6x124 on the south
side of Market street, between Brady and
Hermann, went for $14,250. The lot 75x
124, southwest corner of Market and
Brady, brought , $55,250. Two lots, each
25x124 feet, on the south side of Mark.
75 feet west of Brady, sold for $17,500
each. 'u-^^^^^^^^fe^SgSS-^S-Mt'- \ â 
The remainder of -the Market-street
property . was withdrawn, as â  it appeared
rom the survey that there was some en
croachment on the property of adjoining
owners. This matter, however, it is stated,
will be straightened out in a short while
and the property offered at private sale.
All the interior lots in Mission blocks 13
and 14 were in great demand and many of
them were purchased by the present ten
ants. These lots ranged in price all the
way from $625 up to $3000 each, the differ
ence in price being due entirely to the. size
of the lots, some of which were only 20
feet front while others were 80 feet.
After the sale of these lots five lots on
the north side of Waller street, east of
Stanyan, were put up and sold at prices
ranging from $1175 to $1275 each, the lots
being 27:0x85 feet in size.
Taking everything into consideration,
the owners and auctioneers are to be con
gratulated upon the success of the sale,
which is an indication of the return of
better times. The total amount of the
sale was $281,115, exclusive of an offer of
$8200, which was made for the lot on the
northwest corner of Castro and Seven
teenth streets, which will probably not be
accepted.
The following is a list of the principal
purchasers: T. Mahoney, E. L. Reese,

Opposed to the City Making a Fifty-
Year Contract on a Garbage
Crematory.
The board of directors of the Merchants'
Association held a meeting last evening
and decided to submit to the Board of
Supervisors at its next meetinc the plan

only $125. This will include sixteen hall
directories, lettering the doors, naming
the several floors, etc.
The Supervisors will be petitioned for
the repaying of several of the downtown
streets, principally Geary, Post and Mont
gomery, the latter as soon as the railroad
company decides upon what kind of car
service it will give the public.
The matter of lighting the downtown
portions of the City was postponed until
after the Supervisors let the street-lighting
contract on July 1.
The widening of Lombard avenue to the
Presidio was discussed.
The association voted $25 toward defray
ine the expenses of the committee that is
going to Washington in the interests of
improving the rivers and harbors of this
coast.
The matter of a free market was intro
duced by the special committee's report.
After stating what was said and done at
the two recent committee meetings, the
report said :
T.our committee respectfully submits the fol
lowing conclusions as the present result of its
deliberations: First, the free public market
system is successful and beneficial in other
cities of the United States and Europe; sec
ond, there appears to be a general demand
among the smaller producers and consumers
for a free public market in the City of San
Francisco; third, a free public market in this
City is not only necessary, but would prove of
decided advantage to the City; fourth, the
otter from the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners of a location at the water front should
be accepted as a beginning of the project and
a step in the right direction; fifth, there
should be established at least two more free
public markets in the neighborhood where
they would prove most useful to consumers
and most convenient to producers.
Edward F. Adams of the California
Fruit Exchange presented a long commu
nication upon the same subject.
Letters upon the subject of selecting a
site in San Francisco for the Wilmerding
School were read.
"Secretary J. R. Freud reported that he
has nearly finished compiling the synop
sis of the proposed new charter, which
will be ready for publication within a few
days. The principal points in the charter
will be summarized in ten pages. The
Merchants' Association has declared in
favor of the proposed charter and will in
stitute a vigorous campaign to secure its
adoption.
The subject of the means of disposing of
the City's garbage was discussed, and it
was decided that a petition be sent to the
Board of Supervisors asking it not to take
any action in regard to the awarding of
the contract for building a crematory for
garbage until a report by the engineer of
the association can be submitted. It is
believed that the engineer's report will
show that it would be woll for the City to
own its own plant, and that it would not
be wise to let a contract under any condi
tion for so long a period as fifty years.
The following new members were

VIEWS OF BUSINESS MEW
Probable Influence of the Ad*
vance on Finance and
Trade.
GOLDEN DAYS ARE LOOKED FOR
Facts, Figures and Fancies Galore in
Reference to the Expected
New Regime.
Things downtown had a more cheerful
asDect yesterday than they have worn for
some time past. A vague, indefinable
something flitting airily through the busi
ness streets, seemed to stop now and then
in its capricious career and whisper a word
of comfort and encouragement into the
ear of some would-be money king, making
his step lighter and his glance brighter.
It was at the Produce Exchange, how
ever, that the financial fairy was busiest.
All through the day men thronged the
bare, dingy hall, and it was interesting to
the last degree to observe the lightning
change for the better which overspread
the countenances of some of the habitues
of that institution as they drank in golden
tales of better times.
"There's no use talKing," said a tall,
elderly gentleman, dogmatically, "this
rise in wheat means a great deal. It
means, in fact, everything, financially
speaking, for California."
"I guess that old fellow's about right,"
observed a man who could not have been
so very young himself, since he had iron
gray whiskers. "There is going to be a
change in things, and no mistake. The
hard times have lasted long enough."
"I wish you gentlemen wouldn't talk so
loud," peevishly protested a snowy-haired
financial patriarch, who had dropped into
the^ exchange to see the lay of the land.
"When there's such a racket going on, a
man can't keep track of the market, par
ticularly when he's hard of hearing. This
morning May wheat opened at $1 13%,
and then dropped to $1 13%, but I hear
it's on the rise again. This means some
thing.
"After all," continued the ancient mem
ber, plainly gratified to notice that the
others had ceased speaking in order to
listen to his views, "we old Californians
believe in wheat. When wheat's up the
country's a-booming, and when wheat's
down the State is flat on her back. This
may not be the most reasonable view to
take, but it is the general one. and cannot
be ignored. Tbis idea, be it true or false,
has an influence peculiar to itself on all
departmen-ts of trade and finance through i
the West."
â¢â¢But listen to that bidding, will you."int
erposed a clerk from one of the grain
brokers' offices. "And they're all buying,
too. If the market should take a flop now,
I know some people that would wail like
keeners at a wake. It's up to $1 14 al
ready. Just get onto that old gent with
the gold eyeglasses. If anybody knows
the markets it's he; and he seems to be
buying right and left. There are no
sellers, anyhow, at least there don't seem
to be."
At tbis point a steady rise by eighths
commenced, and as it advanced great ex
citement was manifest. The highest point
reached was $1 14"'.;, after which the price
declined to $1143-2, closing firm at that
figure. Spot wheat for milling purposes
closed at $1 25, which price was firmly held,
while prospects of a rise are said to be
more than fair.
Like other members of the Produce Ex
change, L. W. McGlaurtin was more or less
affected by the prevailing buoyancy. He
refused, however, to allow himself to be
altogether carried away by the tidal wave
of enthusiasm, and stuck to figures, which
he claimed, with no attempt at originality,
"wouldn't lie."
''Now listen to these figures," said Mc-
Glauflin: "lne amount of wheat which
will be required which will have to be pro
duced in this Stat*- during the interval
which commenced on the first of last De
cember and will terminate at the begin
ning of the coming July will be at least
30,000 tons monthly. This, be it under
stood, means the amount necessary within
the State for seed, for milling purposes and
for feeding domestic animals. This
seems to me a very conservative estimate
if not a low one. The Sperry Mills alone
require 14,000 tons every month and the
other mills nearly as. much more, so it
looks as though my estimate was far be
low the mark.
"However, let us assume this estimate
to be somewhere near correct. The in
terval to which I have referred comprises
seven full months, during which time
210,000 tons of wheat will have to be pro
duced for use and consumption within the
borders of this State alone. This leaves
the matter of exports altogether out of
calculation. But now let us look for a
moment at the outside market. The latest
advices from Australia give a most for
lorn picture of this year's wheat crop in
tne colonies. At last accounts the yield
was fully 8,650,000 bushels short. This
amount is about equal to 209,500 tons of
our measure. The drought of last October
practically ruined the Australian wheat
crop. This year's yield represents per
haps a fourth, or may be less, of the usual
harvest.
"Now, the demand in Australia must be
met, and met at once. Nothing can be
more reasonable than to believe that the
colonial wheat-dealers will continue en
deavoring to replenish their depleted mar
let from California's abundance. Already,
since the beginning of last December,
46,863 tons of wheat nave been shipped to
Australia and Africa from San Francisco.
Over 162,000 tons will have to be shipped
to Australia alone during the coming five
months in order to meet the normal de
mand in that country.
. "In this connection the question of
transportation must be considered. It
would be of little avail that a promising
market were opened if carrying facilities
were unduly limited or excessively, ex
pensive. But such, happily, is hot the
case. We have here in port disengaged
vessels with a carrying capacity of 76,761
tons. The ships now on. the way to this
port, and which will unload here, have a
carrying capacity of fully 365,700 tons,
making the total ; freight facilities
444,461 tons. From these figures it will
easily be percieved â¢ that the shipping of
wheat to Australia will be a matter of
great facility. With these two great fac
tors, urgency of the demand in Australia
and facility for transportation thither, I
can only conclude that the California
wheat trade in that quarter will be most
brilliant.
"In the East orr wheat has been rather
low, but there is commencing to be quite a
demand for it, and this demand I am in
formed is liable to assume much greater
proportions. In Chicago the winter wheat
is almost gone, and by the end of Febru
ary there will in all probability be little or
none of it left. The millers in and about
Chicago require from 50,000 to 150,000 tons
daily to keep their mills going, and at the
present rate a call will soon be made for
the Californian wheat, which, after all, is
far superior to anything of the kind that
can be produced in the East.
"Looking at the matter calmly," con
cluded Mr. McGlauflin, "weighing sound
facts and straight figures. which are the only
safe guides in matters of this kind, I have
come to the conclusion that the best thing
we can do here is to raise all the wheat we
can, and have it available as soon as pos
sible. There is no reason, there can be no
reason, why Californian wheat should now
go begging for a market. The demand
being so extensive and imperative, prices
must come up, and I trust in the near
future that the expression 'hard times
will cease to be used in California by all
except historians and others of that ilk
who deal in antiquated reminiscences of
the dead and buried past."
E. L. Atkinson of the grain brokerage
house of T. T. Atkinson & Co. had much
the same story to tell.
"Some people," he observed, "are will
ing and apparently anxious to be fooled
all the time. Then there are other times
when sudden crazes seem to take general
possession of the financial world. But
when we see solid, sensible men preparing
for a reign of prosperity we have a right
to conclude that something is going to
turn up. That seems to be the case at
present. The rise in wheat which is now
raising the wind in the market has come
to stay for a while. This is no scheme of
the brokers, but the legitimate outcome of
a palpable fact. While Chicago markets
have not yet reached our figures, they are
bound to advance m the natural sequence
of events and do their part toward the
augmentation of the general prosperity.
"Tne failure of the Australian crop and
the present low freight standard will both
contribute in no small degree to the suc
cess of Californian wheat in Eastern and
foreign markets. It is said that one large
dealer has bought up most of the A No. 1
milling wheat on the market and is at
present selling it to the mills at $1 20 and
clamoring for more, but I cannot speak
with any degree of certainty regarding the
accuracy or inaccuracy of the statement.
At any rate grain speculators are jubilant,
since the present indications promise bet
ter things for them and their clients in the
near future." j' J. *Â£â '..
George D. Toy of Bovee, Toy & Co. had a
few views to express from a real estate
man's standpoint. â 
"It is necessary," he observed, "for a
man to keep himself in a calm and con
servative disposition of mind while con
sidering situations like the present. There
have been sudden rises in wheat before,
and the dazzling castle in the air has
flopped flatter than a flapjack, ruining the
hopes and fortunes of multitudes in its
collapse. However, this late rise seems to
be of a different order. The facts which
caused the advance are patent to all, and
the rise in prices of wheat seems to me
nothing but the normal effect of a given
cause. A singular feature of life in Cali
fornia is that many Californians, particu
larly the old stagers, literally swear by
wheat. Yon can't interest them in or
chards or in manufactures to any great
extent, and while they seem to wake up a
little when grapes are mentioned, still the
subject does not move them as it might.
But speak to them of wheat, and they
glow with enthusiasm or groan in utter
depression of spirit, according to the
status of the market. Funny, isn't it?
"Still in the real estate business, and in
every business for that matter, we must
deal witb people and ideas as well as with
facts and figures. Taking this for granted,
I think we may predict a great financial
revival if this rise in wheat is permanent.
As things look now the wheat market is
on the verge ot a most prosperous epoch.
Now since wheat (whether rightfully or not
I leave to wiser beads) is so notable a factor
in the industrial and financial life of the
State, a rise in the wheat market if per
manent and bona fide must exercise a most
beneficial effect upon the material welfare
of tho State in every department."
A NOVEL JOUBNEY.
Traveling by London's Electric Under-
ground Railway.
District and metropolitan railways keep
mostly to the north side of the Thames.
But South London has its electric under
ground, the only one of the kind, I be
lieve, in existence, though there are
electric trains almost everywhere now, ex
cept in London, and probably Liverpool is
not alone in : its electric elevated. I my
self have never had occasion to use it, but
curiosity led me once to make a journey
along its entire length.
The trip is made in a quarter of an hour,
and trains run every three minutes. I be
lieve as yet there are but ten trains in all,
but as each makes the round trip in half
an hour, a larger number could hardly be
managed. The journey for the unaccus
tomed has an element of novelty. You
are carried down to the platform and up
again to the street level in an elevetor.
There is no division of classes, and the
cars arc built, somewhat on the model of
streetcars; three are attached to each en
gine. I found the lightâ though it may
have been a chance that one dayâatro
ciously bad, the jolting dreadful j and the
stations clean and dull compared to those
on the ordinary underground. For, of
course, there is no smoke, .and the tiled
walls are immaculately clean; as up and
down lines have, each a separate tube or
tunnel there is a platform 'but to one side,
and it is made as narrow and contracted
may be, while it is the one place I know
where London is as silent as M. Daudet so
recently found it.
The absence of smoke is an advantage in
a way. The atmosphere may savor of the
cellar, but there is no danger of being
stifled and suffocated by foul air. London
being the most conservative place in the
world, naturally the electric railway has
not yet achieved so great a popularity as
to warrant the creation : of rivals. The
Londoner must have time to make up his
mind about it; he is still in that stage of
uncertainty when he will pay his penny or
twopence to go below and inspect the
platform. The wonder really is that this
one line happened to be built in the me
tropolis, which has been most backward in
accepting the modern applications of elec
tricity. Do not London streets, 1 except
here and there, still wait for the electric
light?â Harper's Magazine.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, ; JANUARY 24, 1896.
THEY FAILED TO OPEN.
Downtown Poolrooms Cannot
Get Any Telegraphic
Service.
THE NEW MONTE CARLO.
Gambling to Be Conducted in Annie
Alleyâ News. From Cripple
Creek.
, Contrary to the general expectation the
downtown poolrooms failed to open up for
business yesterday.
â¢ As a consequence the service of the
district messenger oflice was unimpaired
and no new cases of theft or misappropri
ation of employers' funds were reported at
police headquarters.
President Thomas H. Williams of the
California Jockey Club has set his foot
down in earnest against allowing the
poolmen telegraphic service from the Bay
District track.
The poolmen, therefore, are in such a
position that they do not feel justified in
doing business over the grapevine route
they used from the Ingieside track,
JOE HARVEY'S NEW GAMBLING GAME AT THE BAY DISTRICT TRACK.
although in this case they know it would
be much easier to get the news than it was
from the new course. _-.-_-
Their inaction yesterday was greatly
due, too, to the fact that the Driscoil case
is now before Judge Wallace. Driscoil
was arrested on a charge of violating the
Ellert ordinance prohibiting the conduct
ing of pool-selling outside of a racetrack.
The defendant was fouad guilty in ths
Police Court and the case was appealed.
On Wednesday last Judge Wallace stated
that he saw nothing more in the case than
was in the messenger case which he tried
months ago on the same charge and in
which he awarded an acquittal. The Dis
trict Attorney asked to be- allowed to file
briefs, which was granted, and the case
now is pending. In the meantime the
poolmen are mapping out some scheme
try which they may get prompt telegraphic
service, ana they feel confident of success
by to-morrow.
The firms doing business on Ellis street
have all closed their doors to the public
and have secured Quarters in a place less
conspicuous. Henceforth Hallinan & Co.,
Levy & Co. and Harry E. Corbett & Co.
will transact their business in Annie alley,
a narrow thoroughfare running from Eddy
street to Ellis, betmeen Powell and Mason.
They have secured a big abandoned stable.
This has been fitted up with the necessary
stalls and boxes wherein to makes books.
"Billy" Kennedy, one of the speculators
from the recently closed "Belfry," who
went to Cripple Creek, has been heard
from. He writes that the camp is more
than overrun by gamblers and sure-thing
men. Penniless men are reaching the
place by the hundreds every day. There
is nothing doing and the death rate from
pneumonia alone is one each hour of the
day and night.
Kennedy is very bitter against his old
partner, Joe Harvey, who, he claims, is the
cause of his having to leave California.
Tbey were associated in the wheel of for
tune at the Bay District track until Har
vey decided he preferred to be unasso
ciated. That wheel earned, according to
Kennedy, over $101,000 in six months dur
ing which it ran steadily at the Bay Dis
trict track.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club refused to
permit Harvey to run his game at the
Ingieside track.
GOLDEN GATE BOULEVARD.
The Prayer of Property Owners
Answered by the Super
visors.
Refusal to Accept Basalt-Paved Fol
som-Street Blocksâ No Railroad
Tracks.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to grant the
prayer of the residents along Golden Gate
avenue and recommend an order declar
ing that thoroughfare a public boulevard
throughout its full length, thus forever
shutting out street â¢ railroads from laying
their tracks thereon, and making the ave
nue '* the pleasure driveway for, wbich it
was orignally intended.
. The matter was decided upon some time
ago, but as the time was not considered
ripe no definite steps were taken. Yester
day, however, the matter was brought up
for discussion and the committee con
cluded that there was no use of fur
ther delay and instructed Clerk Russell to
draw up an order covering the ground,
which he did in the following words:
Section 1. That certain street in the City
and County of San Francisco known as Golden
Gate avenue, throughout its entire length
from Market street to Masonic avenue, .is
hereby declared - to be and s dedicated as an
open boulevard upon and along which no rail
road franchise shall : ever be granted and on
which no railroad tracks shall ever be laid.
Sec. 2. No permit shall ever be issued allow
ing the moving of any house along said street
for ; any - distance whatever, and no .; house
moving shall, ever., be done on said street,
either along, upon or across the same. â¢
See. 3.' No wagon, truck or dray, . cart or
other vehicle carrying or regularly employed
in carrying goods, merchandise, coal, manure,
sand, lumber or other articles of commerce or
trade, shall travel *. upon said : boulevard . or
street lor any purpose or in any matter what
ever, provided that this article shall not apply
to vehicles carryinz. goods, wares and mer
chandise to or from the residents on said ave
nue. . "i-ilM&gillS-iSsgPS-^V
USec. 4. Any person who shall violate any of
the provisions of this order shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, on convic
tion thereof, be punished by a fine of not less
than $5 or more than $50, or by imprisonment
in the County Jail for not less than five days or
more than six months.
A report was decided upon in favor of
having artificial stone sidewalks laid on
the south side of "Jackson street, between
Steiner and Scott, in front of Alta plaza.
The Superintendent of Streets was in
structed to investigate the matter of sew
ers on Prescott street, near Vallejo, and
recommended the construction of a proper
outlet for sewage in that district as soon
as practicable, as the School Department
has prohibited the further use of the sewer
through the Irving-street school lot.
The committee recommended the re
jection of the petitions of Caroline H.
Kobinson and James D. Pheian, executor
of the estate of James Pheian, for the ac
ceptance of Folsom street, between Ninth
and Tenth. Tne report of the committee
is as follows:
As the citizens of this district have been en
ergetically endeavoring to have a boulevard
on Folsom street by having the same paved
with bituminous rock, the City and County
having appropriated the sum of $35,000 for
this purpose to pave the accepted blocks and
crossings, the balance to complete the entire
street to be appropriated by the City and
County during the next fiscal year, no author
ity can be found to accept the block paved
with basalt blocks years ago, as the same is
not in good condition, and your committee
regards that this apparent omission of a pre
vious Superintendent of Streets to recommend
the acceptance of this block imposes upon the
property-owners the additional expense of re
paying said street with bitumen.
The committee decided that in view of
the opinion rendered by City and County
Attorney Creswell regarding the much
mooted Crocker fence in the rear of the
Nob Hili mansion it would be unwise to
proceed further in the matter, and ordered
the ordinance to remove it placed on file.
This shelves the matter for the present, at
least.
It was decided to instruct the Superin
tendent of Streets to recommend the con
struction of sewers on California street,
from Central avenue to First avenue, in
order to complete the sewerage facilities
thereon. It was also decided to request
the eas and water companies to lay mains
on the street, as it is the intention of the
board to bituminize tbe blocks mentioned.
TALLOW SOLO FOR WAX
A Clever Game Operated by a
Recent Arrival From
Seattle.
Phil Unger Arrested on a Charge of
Having Obtained Money Under
False Pretenses,
Through the efforts of the Morse De
tective Agency of this City Phil Unger,
who is suspected of being a clever swin
dler, was arrested last night on a charge
of obtaining money under false pretenses.
As far as could be gathered from Morse's
men, Unger came to this City from Seattle
about two weeks ago, accompanied by J.
A. Brown and a lad, who claims to be a
nephew of the latter, and who gives 'the
name of Fred Brown.
It is supposed the men have been carry
ing on their operations in a most sys
tematic manner and on a considerable
scale, their victims being merchants along
Front and other downtown streets who
deal in beeswax.
Unger called on Charles Jacobson & Co.,
423 Front street, on January 10, and ex
hibiting a sample of beeswax, worth from
25 cents to 27 cents a pound, stated he had
about a thousand pounds for sale. A bar
gain was struck at 23 cents a pound, and
on the delivery of five barrels, the net con
tents of which weighed 975 pounds, Unger
was given a check for $224 25 and gave the
firm a receipt signed J. A. Baum.
A few days ago the firm sold these five
barrels of supposed beeswax and was about
to ship them to Europe, when it was dis
covered that instead of beeswax the barrels
contained a composition of tallow and
parafflne colored to resemble beeswax, and
worth about 4 cents a pound at most.
The firm at once placed the case in the

landed his man behind the prison bars.
Unger and the two Browns were found at
the Winchester House [on Third street,
but there being no evidence against either
of the Browns they were released.
The detectives discovered that they were
running a factory for the wholesale manu

number of firms have been duped by the
game. . Â
The House of .Lords.
Probably the House of Lords is the least
sentimental assembly in the world, yet it
is peculiarly susceptible to the authority
and magic of a strong personality. On a
celebrated ; occasion Lord Lyndhurst â¢ re
cited at enormous length all ; the black
letter authorities on a subject. Lord Lvnd
hurst got his : way, not. by the weight
of his black-letter â  citations, which' the
pastoral peers who A swell out : full-dress
debates could hardly be expected to
appreciate, but by the 7 accustomed, yet
ever vivid, impression of Lord Lyndhurst
on his legs. Thus, when Lord Salisbury
rises to recommend a perilous success to
the cohorts he .controls, when the House
"gives : audience : and attention still as
night" to the sequence of clear-cut argu
ment and illustration, every phrase poised
to a hair, every point piercing to the quick,
the whole speech acting; like oxygen on
the languid air of the House of Lords, it is
easy to realize. the burden of responsibility
which personal ascendancy lays, upon the
leader of the Conservative party in the
House of Lords.â Nineteenth Century. . .
",:â â  According to a Paris paper the crown of
the King of; Portugal, which was recently
repaired by a jeweller, is the most costly

ANTI-BUCKLEY PRIMARY
The Junta Decided Last Night to
Hold One Within Two
Weeks.
ONLY GOOD MEN FOR JUDGES.
Ex-Election Commissioners James Den
man and P. M. Wellin Will
Name the Officers.
The anti-Buckley primary is now more
clearly in view. The primary committee
of the Junta met last night and decided to
hold a primary for the election of a new
general committee within about two
weeks, the date to be fixed soon in the
course of the frequent meetings the. com
mittee will hold from now on. 7/ 'm' 7-'::.
The Junta people have changed their
minds about holding it according to the
postal primary plan. Chairman W. P.
Sullivan stated last night that the primary
would be an open club election of the
usual sort j and . according to the regular
plan followed by the Buckley faction two
weeks ago.. After favorably considering
the postal j primary plan for a while it was
decided that the value to the faction of
pursuing regular party methods would be
superior to the Increased showing of
strength that would be secured by letting
every voter deposit his ballot in a mail box.
This move on the part of the Junta is a
consequence of the decision of the Su
preme Court Knocking out the new Elec
tion Commission. The Junta has been
waiting to see if its plan of having the
commission appoint the primary election
officers could be carried out.
Last night the primary ; committee de
cided to ask James Denman and P. H.
Wellin, the Democratic members of the
commission that is no more, to personally
name the election officers, of which there
will be five in each of the eighteen dis
tricts.- This will be an evidence of good
faith, at least, and will be supposed to im
part to the election the full degree of re
spectability with which the appointors are
credited. . ...";../,
"We are going, right ahead now," said
Chairman Sullivan last night, "and we an
ticipate a large and successful primary
election. The" issue is squarely Buckley
and' anti-Buckley, and we have with us
the decent elements of the party, who will
turn out at this primary if they have
never voted at a primary before. We are
having copies of the original rolls made
in ; proper and convenient form for the
use of the election officers. Further de
tails will be decided on during the next
few days."
. Samuel Braunbart says that in the
Twenty-ninth District there are 700 anti-
Buckleyites on the Junta rolls which jare
open for inspection, and that that is a
sample of the strength that is arrayed
against Buckley. Meanwhile the Buckley
ities smile and .predict that the coming
primary will be nipped by a frost.
The Ghirardelli Case.
Some important testimony was given in the
Ghirardelli case yesterday in reference to the
parentage of Mrs. Dominga Barbagellata, the
heir who is contesting the will. She was al
lowed' $2000 under the will, but she claims
she is entitled to an equal one-seventh.
Wong Sam Says He Was Slandered.
Wong Sam, a Chinatown merchant, declares
that he has had nothing to do with the Wong
Sing Hong case, and that his name has been
brought Into it by enemies. He made a state
ment of the case yesterday to Commissioner
Seacock. â¢â ,-â¢â¢â

NEW YORK MARKETS.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 23.â railway and
miscellaneous market was quiet a^-ain to-day and
the general run of active issues were lower. A few
stocks, notably Manhattan and Sugar, were strong
and closed with net gains. The other prominent is
sues were inclined to weakness throughout and
lacked support. In the early trading London,
which had been a buyer on previous days of the
week, turned up as a seller of St. Paul and Louis
vilie and Nashville, the result of rumors current
abroad of an alliance between Russia and Turkey,
which complicates the European political situa

case exceeded a point. Manhattan was stronger
than for a long time past, and on covering of slior.

CHICAGO â¢ MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. Telegraph service
was in a disabled condition this morning, and the
wheat market showed its dependence on it by dis
playing extreme dullness. Prices opened firm,
strength being carried over from yesterday, and'
the crowd showing a bullish sentiment. The open
ing and half hour Immediately following were
noted for liberal buying by * local scalper whose
purchasers were doubtless for an interest other
than his own. Liverpool cables were firm and
high, continental markets also reported gains.
The Cincinnati Price Currant summary had a bull
ish trend. Receipts at Chicago were 108. cars,
most of which represented transfers between ele
vators. Withdrawals from .store. were 29,285
bushels. Northwestern arrivals were 436 cars
against 423 las: Thursday, and 167 a year ago.

THE NEW BONO ISSUE.
Henry Clews, the well-known New York banker,
thus speaks of the new bond Issue: "The an
nouncement of the dissolution of the syndicate re
veals the fact that the syndicate had received sub
scriptions amounting to 8200,000,000, which
amount was pledged to |be paid into the United
States Treasury as required, thus showing the sup
ply Of gold in this country ready to go into Gov
ernment bonds at a remunerative ' rate, and which
must be a surprise not, only at home but abroad.
After this exhibition of gold strength It will
scarcely be fair for European bankers and others
to continue their predictions that . the United
Stales Government will be unab'e to maintain gold
payments.. If any further evidence Is wanting to
show the great financial strength of this country
as compared with others, the following. facts will
be conclusive:

NOTKS. '
Nat T. Messer, president of the Hale <fc Nor
cross mine, said to a reporter to-day: "There was
on hand at the mine up to Friday evening last an
accumulation of 416 tons of ore, the average car
sample assay of which was $77 per ton. On Satur
day the mine yielded three carload . of ore, assay
ing $118 per ton. on Sunday the yield was five
carloads, averaging $98 99 per ton : .on Monday it
was live carloads, averaging $88 65, and on Tues
day it was six carloads, the assay of which we
nave not yet received. The yield of the mine for
Saturday. Sunday and Monday, however, was
equal to thirteen tons of ore, ihe average surface!
car sample of which was $99 36" per ton, Which
amount of ore was added to the 4] ii tons previously
accumulated. By the end of the current week we
shall have probably in the neighborhood of 450
tons Of ore on hand, and .hall ship the ore to the
Brunswick mill for reduction. The prospects are
that the company will make a good profit on the

the part of the Brunswick lode which the company
owns is also good." .;.:.-::â¢â -

"iVettstein's Damage Suit.
OAKLAND, Cat,., Jan. 23.â The suit of
Andrew Wettstein against the Southern
Pacific Company for $25,000 damages
would have caused no interest to court
room loungers were it not for the fact that
Dr. Woolsey was one of the witnesses. Dr.
Woolsey has been in charge of all the rail
road surgical work for years, but about a
year aeo the company gave their work to
Fabiola Hospital. In the Wettstein case
Dr. Woolsey appears on the side of the
prosecution, a role he has never before
taken in damage suits in this county,
always having appeared for the railroad
company. His evidence is purely of a
technical nature.
The .Reliance Benefit.
I OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 23.â T0-morrow
evening the Charity Company will give its
initial performance of "7-20-8" at the Mac
donough Theater for the benefit of the
Reliance Club. The final touches are now
being put on by the company and every
thing is in readiness for a successful first
performance. This will be the last ap
pearance of Miss Maude Morrell as an
amateur, as she appears next week with
the Frawley Company in San Francisco.
The house is completely sold out for Fri
day night. There are not many seats left
for Saturday night.
The Garbage Crematory Successful.
I OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 23.â A public
exhibition of the new gurbage crematory '
erected by Louis Schalfer, was given this j
afternoon. Many officials were present, |
including Health Officer Mayon, Sanitary ;
Inspectors Smith and Ott, City Attorney I
Peirsol, Chief of Police Lloyd, Dr. Shuey, |
Councilman Bassett and Secretary Schaf- j
fer. Crude petroleum was used for fuel,
and the garbage was satisfactorily handled.
v The health officer will make a report to
**-" the City Council.
Bernal Held to Answer.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 23.â John Ber
nal, the man who is charged with Having
shot Richard Foley at Pieasanton two
months ago, was held to answer at the
Justice Court at Pieasanton to-day on a
charge of shooting with intent to kill.
There was some argument about the
bullet, but District Attorney Church said
it could not be put in evidence, as it was
still in Foley's body. No defense was at
tempted, and the prisoner was admitted
to bail in $2500 bonds.
Quiet at_;San Leandro.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 23.â The man
agers of the San Leandro Railroad nad an
informal meeting this afternoon and
agreed on some plan to present to tho
Trustees of that town to-morrow night. i
It is likely that the loop around San j

which the difference will be adjusted. !
Everything was quiet at San Leandro this i
afternoon and the pile of rocks that caused !
yesterday's riot was the object of much !
curiosity.

DAVIE NOT READ OUT
Chairman Gardner's Compliment
to Chief Lloyd Had
a Motive.
The Friends of the Mayor Analyze the
Recent Document Which
Was Not Official.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Jan. 23. f
C. E. Gardner, chairman of the City
Populist Committee, says that Mayor
Davie was not read out of the party, as a
document signed by him and published
two days ago in a San Francisco paper
made it appear. According to Mr. Gard
ner the Mayor was not read out of the
party and the paper signed by him and
two others was merely a personal opinion,
and was signed and written at the earnest
solicitation of some one who was anxious
to get up a little political controversy on
his own account.
"The whole of the communication was
not printed," said Mr. Gardner to-day,
"or it would have had a different appear
ance. We did not read Mayor Davie out
of the party, because we have no power to
do so. There was no meeting of the city
central committee to either authorize or
ratify that expression of opinion. It was
signed by James Hopkirk, J. F. Paulk and
myself. Although it may represent the
opinion of the party it was not done with
its sanction and was purely a personal
matter. We should not have written it
had we not been solicited and promised
tbat whatever we wrote would be printed."
Mayor Davie's friends have a different .,
story to tell of the "read ing out" docu- !
ment. The compliment paid to Chief of
Police Lloyd is robbed somewhat of its
value when it is known that Gardner is
clerk of the Chief of Police, which posi
tion he holds solely by the grace of Mr.
Lloyd.
James Hopkirk, another of the signers
who "read the Mayor out of the party," is
the man wnom Davie appointed as an ex
pert to examine the new Grant school
house in the Third Ward. Mr. Hopkirk
went out and made a thorough examina
tion of the school and compared every de
tail with the specifications. He found
some startling delinquencies, and his re
port created great excitement about three
months ago. There was a special meeting
of the Board of Education called and the
Mayor advised immediate proceedings
against the contractors.
Superintendent McClymonds of the
School Department then made the aston
ishing discovery that Mr. Hopkirk had
inspected the Grant School with the plans
of the Sixth Ward school. As the latter
building is three times the size of the
Grant School the differences in the tim
bers and supports were all explained away.
"These things are not bothering me at
all," said the Mayor to-day. "I do not
have time to pay attention to them. Any
insignificant little coterie of disgruntled
politicians can write what they please, but
it is only wasting their ink. Of course, it is
a great pitty that these fellows cannot all
get soft jobs where their most arduous duty
would be to draw their salary. Until such
a happy state of affairs exists there will be
grumbling. I think if I were Hopkirk I
would not be very anxious to rush into
print, though, for the next few years."
NOT ORDERED TO ENGLAND
Newspaper Reports Concerning
Ballington Booth Officially
Denied.
Soldiers Are Warned Not to Believe in
Salvationist Stories That Are
Not Authentic.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 23. J
Brigadier J. J. Keppel, commander of
the Pacific Coast division of the Salvation
Army, says that there is no truth in the
telegraphic reports that Commander and
Mrs. Ballington Booth, who command the
Salvation Army in the United State*-, have
been recalled to London by General Booth
because they were making the American
work too American..
So much publicity was given to the
story 'and so many editorial comments,
favorable and unfavorable, were made
upon it that an official denial has been
published. Coming at a time when the
air is so rife with war news and possible
and impossible international complica
tions, the publication of the supposed
withdrawal of the National leaders caused
great interest, and was calculated to hurt
the work of the Salvation Army at large.
Commander Ballington Booth is a natural
ized citizen of this ; country. The official
denial is as follows:
The appearance of telegraphic dispatches in
many of the coast papers on the morning of
January 15 stating that Commander and Mrs.
Booth were under farewell orders caused much
consternation to officers -. and soldiers all
through the division. We can forgive any pa
per which In its eager search for news seizes
upon any statement that has the slightest ap
pearance of truth, and that sends it broadcast
over the country: but when statements that
we know to be false are made therein, and
when such statements are of a character that
directly reflect upon our beloved veteran gen
eral's attitude toward America and Americans.
and also upon the loyally of our faithful com
manders, we cannot help but oelieve that the
news must have been gathered from an un
friendly source. '...--.

CHARITY REGISTRATION.
The Supreme Court Destroys
the Last Hope of
Relief. ;
DULL PROSPECT FOR WORKERS.
Many Deputies to Be Sworn in Who
Will Register Voters With
out Pay.
... , ...
Oakland Office Pax Francisco Call,)
SOS Broadway, Jan. 23. J
The new great register of Alameda
County will be prepared in a great meas
ure on charity. The decree of the Supreme
Court declaring the Election Commission
act unconstitutional has removed the last
hope that the Supervisors might be able
to make an appropriation to pay deputy
clerks for conducting the re-registration.
Now, there is no possibility of help from
that quarter, and County Clerk Jordan
will have to prepare the great register out
of the regular appropriation of his office.
As the annual cost of getting out a great
register has been about $10,000, the ex
periment of it being prepared without any
special fund will be watched with great
| interest.
At the present time Clerk Jordan is
swearing in scores of deputy clerks all
over the county, who will work without
pay. They will mostly be keepers of
stores of known good reputation, who are
glad to attend to registration for the bene
lit that they may derive from running a
registration office. Those deputies are
now being sworn in and the county has
been carefully gone over, so that as soon
as the necessary, redisricting has been
done by the Supervisors the work of regis
tration can commence in every town and
city in Alameda County;
"Of course it is not very dignified for a
rich county like this to appoint a lot of
deputies without pay," .aid Clerk Jordan
to-day, "but there is no alternative. The
whole appropriation for this office would
not get out a great register without a
resort to extraordinary means, and I have
begun this early so that all my regular
deputies can put in as much time as possi
ble. The position is a very uncomfortable
one, but I see no help for it."
The getting out of a great register has
always been regarded as a harvest field for
the regular political workers of the "in"
party. It usually meant that 100 or so of
ward-workers would be employed at $4
per day for one, two or three months, and
have nothing more to do than sit in an
office and make about half a dozen regis
trations a day. When the prospect of ob
taining the periodical soft snap was offered
scores of applicants appeared, and when
the situation was made known there was
a loud howl from "de push." Now the
progress of the registration will be watched
with much interest and there will be many
thousands of dollars saved that has been
usually spent on a small army of deputies.
CARNOT DEBATERS READY.
Principals Selected for the Great
Intercollegiate Contest
Next Month.
The Young Men Who Will Represent
the State University and Stan

BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 23.â The battle
THEODORE DE LAOUNA. . M. C.FLAHERTY. R.S.WHEELER.
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DEBATERS.
between the representatives of the Uni
versity of California and. Stanford for the
Carnot gold medal, to be held on February
7, gives promise of being a hotly contested
one. A letter was received by Speaker
Dam of the Students' Congress to-day
from Benjamin F. Bledsoe, a Stanford
member of , the intercollegiate committee,
in which it was stated, with reference to
the coming debate: "We have girded up
our loins and are ready for the fray."
Stanford's trio was chosen some time
ago, while Berkeley's men, consisting of M.
C. Flaherty, '90, Theodore de Laguna. '9!,
and R. S. Wheeler, '96, with Charles A.
Fryer as substitute, were selected at the
H.D. SHELDON. A. M. CATHCART. J. M. ROSS.
THE THREE i STANFORD DEBATERS.
final of the preliminaries last evening.
The three tirst-named men are all members
of the senior class, while the substitute
Fryer is a freshman. The fact that a
freshman has even secured the place of a
substitute is considered quite remarkable
in college debating circles, as ho is thelirst
one who has ever even had the place of a
second on any of the intercollegiate
speaking contests.
Fryer is tne son of Or. John Fryer, the
newly elected professor of Oriental lan
guages at the university, who is at present
in .Shanghai, China, in the Government
employ. The young debater prepared for
college at the Oakland -high school and
was editor of the _3Egis during his senior
year. He made the address in behalf of
the scholars at the dedication of the new
high school building. Fryer is at present
in his nineteenth year.
The debate this year is at Stiles Hall, in
Berkeley. The medal went to Stanford
last year, but the new University of Cali
fornia team say that they will give the
wearers of the cardinal a hard fight for it
this season. - 'â â¢/: v.
THE STANFORD DEBATERS.
Cathcart, Sheldon and Ross Will
Uphold the Cardinal in the
Carnot Contest.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
23.â -The following facts may be interest
ing concerning the debaters who have
been selected to represent Stanford in
the regular annual debate against Berke
ley.
A. M. Cathcart has long been connected
here with debating societies, and made
a mark in his sophomore year as a power
ful debater. He possesses a peculiarly in
dividual knack for driving his facts
through all opposition. In taking up a
subject he goes at it without glovesâ know
ing he understands it himself he simply
forces it on the minds of listeners. His
delivery is not particularly noticeable for
elegance, but rather force. He leaves the
facts, clearly stated, to answer for them
selves.
H. D. Sheldon learned the rudiments of
the debate before coming to the university.
While here, however, he has increased in
skill and in reputation as a good strong
speaker. His utterance is .rapid, for the
points seem to come on his mind faster
than he can state them; yet he is not pre
cipitate. He leaves no bridges behind,
but covers his retreat well. He is shrewd
in selecting nis defenses and skillful in
protecting himself from attack. He is
vigorous, clear and practical, thinks rap
idly and talks fluently.
J. M. Boss is no novice in the college
forum. He has taken part in all the
society' debates and differs from Stanford's
otheriepresentatives in the fact that he is
slower an.i possibly more calculating. He
goes at his subject deliberately and deter
minedly. Every step he takes is taken
with caution. His presence is much in
his favor, his enunciation clear and dis
tinct. Mr. Ross has never yet taken part
in an intercollegiate debate, but ho is
thoroughly well fitted for the position of
honor and will prove a source of strength
to Stanford's trio.
DANIEL TEETER'S NUGGET
After Sixteen Years It Was
. Found to Be Not Worth
a Nickel.
Arthur Feidler's Cruel Persistency
Results in an Unpleasant
Discovery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 23. J
Arthur Feidler, the well-known Liver
i more politician, made a discovery a few
! days ago that resulted in his old friend
j Dan Teeter now regarding him with a
glassy eye.
Lan Teeter is a prominent man of Liver
more, and has been for over a score of
years. For the past sixteen years he has
been the possessor of a very large gold
nugget. It has always adorned his shirt
front and has been greatly admired. Hun
dreds of times he has been compelled to
give a history of the chunk of gold. He
still owns it, but he is not so proud of it as
of yore. Arthur Feidler has made the un
pleasant discovery that all that glitters is
not gold.
One day last week while Teeter was tell
ing a number of eager listeners how he
gave a poor fellow $5 for the nugget many
years ago, Arthur Feidler interposed with
the remark, "But suppose after all, Da ll
that it is not gold."
"No doubt of it," said Teeter. "I've ex
hibited it for sixteen years and its value
has never been questioned."
"But it is possible that it may. be a
fraud," said Feidler. "Suppose we go in
here into Berais' and have it tested." -
Teeter was more than willing, and into
the jewelry-store went the little party.
The jeweler examined _ the nugget suspi
ciously and placed it in a pair of scales,
which required nearly every pennyweight
in the house to bring' about the required
balance. Next it was put under a nitric
acid test and no sooner did the fluid touch
it than it turned a pretty bluish-green. But
so confident was Teeter that his nugget
was valuable that he asked innocently:
"Well, how, much is it worth?"
"Oh, about 3or 4 cents, '[ said the jew
eler. Then there was silence for the space
of two minutes, out of regard for the feel
ings of Teeter. t/'/./p
Mail-carriers in Morocco are said to
avoid the risk of losing their places by
oversleeping by tying a string to one foot
and setting .the end, of it on fire before
going to sleep. The string, ; they know
from experience, will burn so long, arid
when the fire reaches their foot it is time
for them to get up.

treasurer of the Managers' Association of
Life Insurance Companies of San Fran

For many years Mr. Archibald was ac
tive in the Methodist ministry and after

of good and bad literature and kindred
subjects. Having to abandon public speak

books he contributed largely to magazines.
His literary work was recognized by
Eastern colleges as entitling him to several
honors. The degrees of doctor of divinity,
master of arts and doctor of laws were all
bestowed upon him. He was one of the
founders and prime movers in the great
Chautauaua of New York.
Mr. Archibald was born at Troy, N. V.,

HENRY RODGERS' STORY.
Professor Hayne Says the Ac
cused Students Were Per
â¢ fectly Sober.
Practice Work Commenced for the
University Baseball Season.
Burglars at Work.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 23.â Harry
Rodgers, the academy student who was
given a shaking up the other night by a
party of university boys for an alleged in
sult offered to an unprotected young lady,
seems to have placed himself in rather a
peculiar predicament. One of the main
points in Rodgers'- testimony against the
accused students is that they were in an
intoxicated condition. This they flatly
deny. In 'support" of their denial they
have the statement of A. P. Hayne, an in
structor at the university, that the entire
party was in a state of perfect sobriety.
Rodgers says that he can produce proof
that he did not insult any lady or ladies,
and that there- were no grounds what
soever for the assault other than personal
enmity. .-.-.. -v-*v 'â¢â 7/77-
The three students on whom John Doe
warrants were sworn out appeared before
Judge James this morning to be identified
by Rodgers, but as the accuser did not ap
pear the trial was set for Friday, Jan
uary 31. â¢â â .â '.
Upon the advice of their attorney, the
arrested students refuse to make any state
ment, further than that , Rodgers will be
shown up in his true light at the trial.
First Work on the Diamond.
The first practice work of the baseball
season by the university students was done
this afternoon. Captain Johnson and
about twenty other men spent an hour on
the held batting and: catching, and other
wise getting their muscles I into trim. As
soon as tho ground is sufficiently dry regu
lar training will be commenced. The
teams are not as yet fully organized, but
it is understood that the freshman class
contains a number of men who will fur
nish several surprises before the season is
over.
"After Carpenter's Tools.
BERKELEY, Cal.,' Jan. About $100
worth of carpenter's tools belonging to W.
C Morser and T. 0. Sprague, two Oakland
craftsmen, were stolen' last : ni_rht from a
, house ; which is being built at the foot of
Chapel street. ; A crowbar ;. and . pickax
were also stolen from the house which

No Challenge From Tale. r >^7
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. The foun
dation for the report of a challenge from
the Yale track athletic team. to the Berke
leyfchampions for a track and field contest
was a private letter received from Captain
Sheldon of Yale by Arthur North last
term expressing hope that if Berkeley sent
another team East a contest could be ar
ranged. The letter has been the means of
arousing much interest among the stu
dents, and the prospect of a match with
Yale will do much to add support to the
project of sending another team across the
Rockies.
Plunkett Will Play Again.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 23.â There is
general rejoicing at the university over
the fact that Plunkett, the star guard of
theJVarsity, has decided to enter the law
department of tne university, since by so
doing he will be enabled to play football
under the blue and gold for another sea
son. Plunkett graduated from Berkeley
in May and it was supposed that his
services for tho U. C. would then be lost,
but his entrance to the law department
will qualify him for another season's work
on the California gridiron.
;'â :/ j Professor Hudson to Speak.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 23.â Professor
William H. Hudson of Stanford University
will speak to-morrow evening under the
auspices of the Unitarian Society at Stiles
Hall on "Walt Whitman." This will bo
the first ol a series ef six lectures by
eminent men, to be given under the
direction of the Unitarians within the next
three months.

Was It "Will or Note?
Nora Comba is endeavoring to have pro-
bated what she claims was the will of Mrs.
Mary Kelly. She claims that Mary Kelly, who
lived with her .some time, made a will, in
which she left her landlady $2000. This was
left in the hands of Father John Nugent of St
Rose's parish, and was burned in the Brannan
street tire of last June. 'â¢'.:â¢
The counter claim is made that the paper
was not a will, but was in the nature of a
promissory note for rent, etc. Of this sum
Â£1000 had been paid.it was claimed, and upon
the question whether the document was a
will or a promise to pay the case rested. There
was no decision. .â¢ _â¢ ; â  / -

Bank of Alameda went out of existence

PHffiNIX MIDWINTER CARNIVAL
Some of ; the Attractions Described by
Passenger Agent Goodman.
General Passenger Agent Goodman has
sent the following circular to all passenger
agents of the Southern Pacific company:
The progressive citizens of Phoenix, Ariz.,
have fixed on February 10, 20, 21 and 22,
189G, for their second annual midwinter car
nival. " .-v.
The programme includes Indian and cowboy
sports, baseball, football, cricket, tennis, fire
men's tournament, trotting and running race?,
gun club trap shooting, good music, grand
Mardi Gras pageant, magnificent trades' pa
rade of costly float*, competitive militia drill
and unrivaled wild west and Indian exhibi
tions. For these last, in startling perfection,
Phoenix can distance the field.
To see the city of Phoenix, resting in its re
fined wealth and beauty on the ruins of an
empire so ancient that 'it has left no written
record or tradition of its glories, surrounded
by limitless fields of fragrant clover and by
vineyards, graves of citrus and orchards of
deciduous fruits, is of itself a sufficient motive
for a transcontinental trip; but with a super
added gala-week under such a programme,
and railway rates, and conditions of the most
inviting character, a large attendance should
be assured.
An agreeable surprise awaits any who may
anticipate want of reasonable metropolitan
luxuries.
It is true, Indians, In barbaric-colored rai
ment, will be seen in large numbers upon the
streets, but in pleasant contrast with electric
| cars, and other evidences of a dominant civili
zation. --Â.â¢- . .
In many aspects Phoenix is a living tableau
of the transition stage between the picturesque
past and the esthetic future.
The red man who is untamable by inheri
tance, and the cowboy who is so by choice,
are becoming legendary, and soon will be
known only on the theatrical stage. Whoso
attends the Phanix. midwinter carnival will
see them in native, realistic beauty.

fleece, a new and more gayly decorated in
vention now occupies the old stand. In
this new catch-penny arrangement di
minutive horses, worked by means of a
crank, race around an imaginary track,
and the unwary are expected to bet their
money in an endeavor to call them, 1 â 2 â 3.
The* racing was decidedly mixed. Fa
vorites and the mud clashed. AlO to 1
shot captured the opening dash, and a 40
to 1 chance galloped away from his field in
the following event. Old Toano demon
strated that he could run just as fast at 4
to sas he could at 30 to 1, being the - lone
favorite to show in front.
Fourteen maidens furnished a rare guess
ing proposition in the opening five-and
a-half-furlong run. Yo El Bey, the
8 to 5 favorite, could do no better than
finish third. The 10 to 1 shot, Fijian, toot
the lead in the stretch and won with little
to spare from Peixotto, another outsider.
The same stable made another coup in
the following race. Backed down from 40
to 25 to 1 New Moon was in front all the
way and won by five lengths from Sam
Leake, the top-heavy 9 to 10 favorite.
There were but seven starters in the
Quinlan selling stake over seven furlongs,
worth $900 to the winner. Imported Miss
Brummel, carrying Pi pounds, ruled an 8
to 5 favorite in the betting, with the Burns
A: Waterhouse pair, Bosebud and Poten
tate, next in demand. Potentate was sent
out to kill the favorite off. and he accom
plished the feat before the stretch was
reached. Bosebud then came on and in a
drive won from Highland by half a length.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JAKCJAK^T 24, IS"-.
Potentate was a close third, with tho oth
ers beaten away off. The winner's run
was a remarkably good one, covering the
distance in 1:30^.
All Over was a 4 to 5 choice for the mile
dash, but probably McHugh did not do
him the justice a Doggett or a Willie
Martin might, and he brought up in third
place. The second choice, Hidago, took
the lead in the stretch and won handily
rom Hy Dy, who was quoted at 20 to 1 in
the ring.
Backed from 6 to 5 to 4 to 5, old Toano
disposed of his field in the fifth event over
the short six-furlong course like breaking
sticks. Doggett sent him to the front, and
he won pulling up, eight lengths before
Bed Will. Sea Spray was third.
The last event on the card, over the
same distance as the race preceding, went
to the 8 to 1 chance, Hueneme, who as
sumed command in the stretch and beat
the 8 to 5 favorite, Zoolein, out two
lengths. Miss Buth fin ished a good third.
The Two-Tear-Old Stakes.
The six stakes for two-year-olds to be
run this spring at Bay District under the
auspices of the California Jockey Club,
closed on January 15, with a total of 337
nominations, an average for each stake of
62. The fixtures and the number of nomi
nations to each are
Pacific stakes, half mi1e.......... . 71
Racing stakes, lor fillies, half mile 52
P.ancho del Paso stakes, five-eighth* of a mi1e.. .75
Bitter Root handicap, live-eighths of a mile 66
Bay District handicap, three-quarters of a mile. .57
Flying stakes, selling, nine-sixteenths of a mile. 62
On breeding lines the class is of the best
quality and all the leading stables are rep
resented. The heaviest nominations are:
Almona stable, Atkins & Lottridge, Burns
& Waterhouse, Cambridge stable, Colum
bia stable, Eimwood stock farm, El Pri
mero stable. Del Monte stable, W. 08.
Maedonough, Neil & Coney, Pueblo stable,
John Bobbins, Santa Anita stable, John H.
Shields, Westchester stable and Woodlawn
stable.
Track and Paddock Items.
The Montana plunger took $10,000 out of
the ring over Fijian's victory. /.7
Secretary Edwin F. Smith of the State
Agricultural Society is much elated over
the large number of nominations for the
new stakes erected by the society. For the
Nursery stake of 1897 there were 113 en
tries, and for the Futurity of 1898 203.
Green B. Morris has made the necessary
amends for his hasty words concerning the
officials in the stand at the Bay District,
and the decision passed refusing his en
tries has been rescinded.
Hueneme, winner of the last race, en
tered to be sold for $200, was bid up to
$700 by John Howard, at which figure his
owner, C. L. McDonald, was obliged to
let the horse go. It is rumored, however,
the run-up money was not made good,
and the brown sprinter may not change
hands.
Servian Benevolent Society.

following recently elected officers: Lazar Jovo-
vich, president; John Giavinovich, vice-presi

A MONSTER IS
IN THE CITY.
Twenty-Two Draft Horses
Poisoned in Their
Stalls.
MISCREANT UNKNOWN.
Ten Horses Owned by the Arctic
Oil Company Died Since
Sunday.
POISON GIVEN IN WATER.
Supposed to Be the Work of the Fiend
Who Mutilated the Horse on
Jessie Street.
Twenty-two horses belonging to the
Arctic Oil "Works have been poisoned in
their stalls within the past few days, and
ten of them have died since Sunday. The
others are still suffering, and some of
them*may die. Three veterinary surgeons
are in attendance, but they are entirely
mystified as to the character of the poison
ing.
The officers of the Arctic Oil Company
declare themselves to be wholly in the I
dark as to how the poisoning was done. |
If some one has done the thing with in
tent they say they cannot guess who that
some one is or what the provocation.
The police have been informed and yes
terday visited the works and made an
investigation, but they could get no clew.
There has been considerable gossip in
the neighborhood of the works, since the ;
horses began dying, that a young man re- j
cently employed about the stable, but who ;
got into trouble with his bosses and was
discharged a few days ago, is under suspi- i
cion. That, however, is denied by the I
officials of the company. One of them said !
last night:
"We have had no trouble with any of j
our employes that I know of, but I do not i
care to say all I think about this matter ;
just now. It might be premature."
Following so close upon the atrocious j
mutilation of a horse in the stable of j
Thomas Harkins, 43 Jessie street, the
police are inclined to believe that some I
monster who finds fiendish pleasure in in- !
flicting pain upon the horse has developed j
in the City.
This seems the more probable from the
fact that the Jessie-street outrage is still a
mystery so far as the perpetrator is con
cerned. In neither case has any motive
for wreaking vengeance upon the owners
of the animals been made apparent.
Dr. Masoero, who is the chief surgeon in
attendance at the stable of the oil works, i
is of the opinion that the poison has been
administered to the horses in the water.
He intimates, although he does not di
rectly declare, his belief that the horses I
have been deliberately poisoned.
"This, is another of those strange hap
penings'that I met with once or twice be
fore in n**y experience,'' said Dr. Masoero
last everting. "The mutilation of the
horse in Jessie street is something beyond
my understanding.
"With all my experience it makes me
shudder to witness the sufferings of these
horses. lam inclined to believe that the
poison was given them in the water. I
cannot say just what the poison is. The
symptoms were somewhat peculiar. I was
first called to attend these horses early
Sunday morning. Th* re was then thought
to be Out one horse afSected. I found him
suffering great pain. The roof of his
month and his lips were quite white. He
died on Monday, but by that time six or
seven others had taken sick, exhibiting
the same symptoms. They died in quick
succession. Three died yesterday. Two
others died to-day. lam afraid another
will follow, but I hope that the others will
recover, as I find them somewhat better
to-night.
"Three horses belonging to Captain
Griffiths, secretary of the company, were
in the stable on Sunday and were taken
sick with the others. They were two
handsome' carriage horses and a saddle
horse. They were removed to the cap
tain's private stable on Rincon Hill.
They are better and will recover.
"No, there need be no fear of an epi
demic of disease among horses,'' contin
ued the doctor. "There is no mistaking
this as being a case of poisoning. When
, I saw the serious nature of the case I in
sisted upon the company calling in some
other veterinary surgeons, as I did not
wish to bear the responsibility alone. Dr.
Archibald and Dr. Robbins were sum
moned, and we nave consulted over the
case. I also sent portions of the stomach
â  ana intestines to a chemist for analysis,
.'hut can get no report upon it for a week
-yet. There are nine horses in the stable
mow, all suffering more or less. One and
| perhaps more may die."
The Arctic Oil Works are located on
/Illinois street in the Potrero. At night
! the buildings are tightly locked up, and
: It would require some ingenuity to get
into the yards ana much more to get into
the stable after dark.
The watchman at the place responded
last night to an energetic hammering upon
the gate, and in answer to questioning
said:
"The stable is very carefully guarded by
a special watchman all the time, and it
would be next to impossible for any one
to get at the horses without detection in
he night. In theday, however, it is quite
different, as the stable is open and em
ployes have access to it. Since the horses
began to die the force of watchmen has
been increased until there are now five.
The loss is considerableâ the horses that
have already died could not be replaced
for less than $2000. Ido not know of any
men having been discharged lately or
there being any trouble with them."

ARTS AND CRAFTS.
The Antique Exhibit on Pine Street Is
Provinc Â» Most Gratifying
Success.
There is no abatement in the interest
being manifested by the general public, in
the exhibition of all that pertains to the
art and craft of printing at 424 Pine street,
and the financial success of the enterprise
is now assured. Each day since the open
ing large numbers have been in attendance.
A first and casual glance gives little idea
of the fascinating character of the display,
as there has been no attempt to give it the
orderly characteristics of an art exhibit.
In consequence the first impression is one
of confusion.
The design is to make a display that in
its variety will appeal- to every one en
gaged in any of the diversified branches of
the art and handicraft of printing. In
fact, it is a show intended to appeal more
directly to those engaged in these depart
ments, and in order that all who are kept
by their employment from visiting the ex
hibit during "working hours may have an
opportunity to examine the display, the
guild has decided to open the same, free
of charge, on Sunday -from 10 a. m. to 5
p.m. This will be the last day of the ex
hibition, i P.//.,
On Friday evening K." P. Garnett will
talk informally about book plates and
posters, and on Saturday evening Messrs.
Bendix, l.andsberger and yon der Mehden
will in turn render musical selections.
It. is the hope of the guild that this en
terprise will prove but the forerunner of a
series touching on various special branches
of handicraft and industrial art; such as
metal work, Japanese art. wood work, etc.
Subscribing members of the guild pay
$5 a year, which entitles them to admission
to all exhibitions held under the manage
ment of the guild. This is a new fea
ture of this unique organization, which
comprises men actively engaged in the
different arts and handicrafts connected
with the arts.
STABBED BY REEL TERRY.
E. V. Phillips Slightly Wounded
in a Brawl on the
Street.
A Midnight Encounter in Which a
Knife Was Used Without Seri
ous Effect.
E. -V. Phillips was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital last night suffering from
three knife wounds inflicted by Reel B.
Terry.
The cutting occurred at the corner of
Stockton and Market streets at about
11:45 o'clock, and was the result of a
row. 7
Phillips was at one time a newspaper
reporter. Later he became secretary of
the Pilot Commissioners. Terry is an at
torney and a son of the late Judge David
B. Terry.
Mr. Terry is said to have been the
aggressor in the trouble of last night.
Both men had been drinking and they
came out of a saloon on tbe corner of Ellis
street together, each surrounded by friends.
Phillips made some remark that Terry re
sented.
Terry jumped at Phillips with an open
knife in his hand. His first blow cut
open Phillips' temple. The wounded man
struck Terry, who staggered back and
rushed at Phillips again, cutting him on
the shoulder.
The two men clinched at this. They
were in a tight embrace for a second. Then
Phillips threw Terry heavily to the ground
and began pummeling him when friends
interferred.
Phillips was bleeding profusely, and his
friends advised him to quit. He slowly
relinquished his grip on Terry's throat,
saying - /yp/p-p/y/p : 7
"Get up, you coward. I'll give you
your life."
Then he was taken to a drugstore on
the corner.
Terry was led by his friends to the back
room of a neighboring saloon, but soo
left there. ";:7r>-
Phillips' friends rang for the patrol
wagon. Before it arrived they boarded a
streetcar with him and went to the Receiv
ing Hospital. There it was found that he
had received three wounds which were
only superficial. .
Phillips' friends declared to the sur
geons that the wounded man had fallen
down in the street and hurt himself.
The Old louvre Sign.
The Supreme Court has decided that theO Id
Louvre need not take down its sign until the
appeal now pending on the question is settled.
Suit was brought to have it compelled to do so,
and judgment was rendered in favor of the
plaintiff, the proprietors of the Louvre on
Powell and Eddy streets. -As the Old Louvre
sign was not taken down, they had the
proprietors cited for contempt, but the
contempt proceedings have been dismissed,
as the appeal is still pending," and the removal
of tha sign cannot be procured indirectly by
contempt proceedings while direct proceed

THE SAN FK CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 24, 1896.
STARVED FOWLS
IN THE MARKET
Charges of Cruelty in a
Poulterer's on Clay
Street.
OREGON CONSIGNMENTS.
Delayed by Washouts, the
Starving Birds Ate Each
Other.
TO BE SOLD FOR HUMAN FOOD.
Secretary Holbrook Says the Health
Department Grossly Neglects
Its Duty.
Arrests for cruelty of an unusual nature
are to be made at the instigation of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. Chickens that had , partially
eaten each other alive had been offered for
sale in a Clay-street market. Secretary
Holbrook accuses the Health Department
of gross negligence, as iv addition to the
cruelty the case involves the sale for hu
man food of what he considers little better
than carrion.
As M. McCurray, assistant secretary of
| the society, was passing the Clay-street
market yesterday afternoon he noticed a
\ number of coons of chickens being deliv
| ered from a wagon at the stall of 11. Fo
j dera. The condition of the birds was such
' that he thought at first of arresting Jacob
i son, the teamster who was delivering the
; consignment, but, deciding that it was
better to have a witness, he telephoned
for Secretary Holbrook, "who was soon at
the place. Speaking of it afterward Mr.
j Holbrook said :
"It was the worst sight I ever saw. The
j chickens were wounded, dead and dying
i in the coops, many of them crushed and
! choked to death. . Some of them had been
j so crushed that the bones were shattered
j and distorted out of all shape, but they
were still alive, and others had had the
: skin torn off their backs and necks, and
i though they were breathing the other
famished chickens were pecking and eat
j ing their live flesh. Some of the coops
I were upside down, with the -brushed heads
; hanging through the bars. It was a case
! of the survival of the fittest, for some of
the birds that were crushed out of all sem-
I blance to a chicken in shape were still
alive.' â â '*â¢Â£-â  .Vf
"And that was intended for human
; food. There was not a bird there, alive or
' dead, that was fit to eat. The chickens
, that were not mutilated were parched and
i famished, and they had been so bruised
and terrified that they were all sick and
! feverish and liable to make any one sick
who ate them. There were about fifteen
coops and they were heaping the chickens
out of them, dead and dying, on the side
walk. I made them kill those that were
alive to end their sufferings.
"The man at Fodera's stand said he had
: not to pay for the mutilated chickens that
â  were dead. He had taken the consignment
I as it had come in from Oregon and would
' only have to take the live ones. 'Throw
; the dead chickens in a hole,' he said to the
i boy. I don't know what kind of a bole lie
meant tamale hole, probably, for I no-
I ticed he gathered them up, dead and dying,
all the same. You may be sure that he
1 did not throw them away. People will eat
those chickens, and it's a shame that the
i Board of Health permits it, for they are
I not fit for human food.
'The chickens arrived at Fourth and
! Townsend from Oregon in a palace car,
which holds about 4000 of them. They
i were consigned to a firm on Battery street,
I the name of which we do not know, but
we can easily discover that to-morrow.
j The man Jacobson, who was delivering
them, claims that the car was delayed in
j Oregon by a washout and that the chick
ens, in their hunger and thirst, trampled
j on and crushed one another, but they
| must have been too tightly packed. There
is supposed to be a trough of water run
i ning beside- each tray in the palace
; chicken-cars, but half the time the men in
\ attendance are too negligent to turn the
! water on. We have often found cases of
! coops of chickens arriving here with their
I throats as parched as a bit of dry leather.
"At Fourth and Townsend streets these
particular chickens were bundled out of
! the palace car into coops. Jacobson said
j to me, 'Every one of the trainmen last
| night wanted a chicken when they found
! the state they were in.' 'What did they
] want them for?' I asked. 'They were not
! fit for food.' It seems, though, that the
i trainmen were willing to risk eating them.
"Fodera had apparently bought fifteen
coops of the consignment from the com
mission agent, and as the business houses
! were closed by the time we had got
I through killing the wounded chickens, we
' were obliged to defer further search till to
| morrow. We mean, however, to make a
i test case of this chicken business and see
if we cannot make the men at this end re
sponsible."
It is Secretary Holbrook's opinion,
based on previous experience, that any
convictions the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals can secure will
never put an end to the evil. "It is the
business of the Health Department," said
Mr. Holbrook. "If it would take charge of
that kind of thing and appoint a market
inspector like Dockery we should have no
more of these cases of cruelty and carrion.
The Board of Health does not pay any
attention to what is oold in the markets.
In tbe whole department there is but one
man who does his duty, ana that is the
milk inspector. If the Health Department
would 'Dockery' the markets we shou-d
not have any more barbarities of the kind
we discovered to-day."

Mr. Magee delivered an eloquent ad
dress, that was received with frequent ap
plause. He said, in part:
Montaigne, in one of his essays, said that he
had a grievance against time, because he was
by It prevented from meeting Julius Ca?sar,
Socrates and many of the other great men of
antiquity. Many of us feel similarly about
the lew great immortals. Think of meeting
and talking with the mightiest Julius Caesar,
â"death having no conquest over that con
queror'âor to meet the contemplative and se
vere Milton, the Titanic Eschyl us;. the moral
ami kingly poet, Sophocles; the blind Homer,
Pericles, the old Grecians and others like In
kind, the flames of whose acts or works will
never cease to illuminate the world.

really know them better? If in the body and

again alive, and you could engage these men
in ordinary conversation, would you thus
know them best? No, their works as authors,
or their deeds as men, either as soldiers, scien
tists, philosophers, painters, sculptors, archi
tects, or what not, are the immortal part of
them; their bodies were as those of other men.
We uncover our heads when we get into ordi
nary company. How reverently ought we to
uncover when we enter a library which has
become, from its contents, however humble its
architecture, a temple of the mighty dead. No
riches are so permanent as those you can
acquire through the mind and soul; thieves
cannot break into or steal this wealth.
And I here call attention to a point which I
have never seen discussed, and that is that
mental appetites are the analogue of physical
appetites in this respect; that, if you cultivate
a taste (and the young are constantly doing
this) for tongue-tickling but indigestible mix
tures, that please the taste but yield no
nourishment or a minimum of that only to the
body, such appetites will Increase, and the
result will be that good but plain materials of
which the best physical and mental structures
are built, are finally left wholly out of the bill
of fare, flabby muscles, pale complexions,
shriveled skins, bad livers and bad hearts
succeeding where there should be healthy
bodies, clear complexions and vigorous circula
tion. The mind is similarly starved by the
constant perusal of weak novels or other poor
literature. -
1 have always been a subscriber to the Mer
cantile Library and I always will. It is not a
great library, measured by libraries in great
cities elsewhere. I ask for many books that 1
do not rind either in it or the -Mechanics'
Library, but it is, as a library, all that San
Francisco will allow it to be. It has not by
any means allâ or nearly allâ of the books its
best friends desire it to have, yet the stores of
books in it are still magnificent, and I here
assert that every member who really desired
to acquire solid intellectual wealth of, any
kind has carried away from this library {j>2o
mentally for every dollar he has spent on his
membership pecuniarily.
The library is in debt fTO.OOO. The board of
direotors and myself propose this year to make
a large hole in that debt, and thereby, instead
of having its receipts swallowed largely by in
terest, to add an/I add largely to its stock of
good books, which are as faithful, ever hope
ful, uncomplaining, elevating companions as
man or woman can find in the world.
The evening's exercises were closed with
a short address by Lovell White, one of
the oldest members and an ex-president,
who gave an interesting account of the
library in times gone by, when it wielded
a great influence in a social and literary
way. i - -'.
SET HIS CLOTHES AFIRE
Samuel B. . Thompson _Is Still
Willing to Be Declared
Insane.
He Keeps Up the Supposed Imposition,
but the Police Insist That He
Is Shamming*.
Samuel B. Thompson, securely manacled
and confined in a steel cell , in the Receiv
ing Hospital, succeeded in starting a fire
early yesterday morning and burned up a
portion of his clothing as well as destroy
ing r a heavy pair of ; shoes. 7 Before being
placed in the cell his clothing was thor
oughly searched and nothing was found in
his pockets. , ;
. Thompson declared that he had slipped
one hand out of the irons x and by rubbing
two-sticks of wood together he caused
sufficient friction to start the fire. Where
he could have oDtained f the wood is a
mystery, which he refused to divulge. .'_-
Police Surgeon Weil, who has observed
Thompson closely, does not believe the
man is insane, and his opinion is borne
out by , Bailiff Kelly of Judge Conlan's
court, who said yesterday that Thompson
admitted to him he was acting a part so as
to be sent to an insane : asylum instead of
to the penilentiary.v Thompson ; said jhe
had been in an asylum three times before
and knew just how to fool people. ;
At 12 r- o'clock yesterday Judge Sander
son, who had considered the matter of
Thompson's sanity, ordered him remanded
into the custody of the Sheriff. '--?â¢
Thompson has , already 7 been $ held on
three charges of an attempt to commit a
felonious assault, but he has yet to stand
his preliminary examination on the more
serious charges of " felonious assault. ; He
will, therefore, have to be kept in the City
Prison for some days yet. Captain Robin
son - ; declares that" he -will be so ?; closely
guarded that- no further attempts at sui
cide will be possible. .
Thompson told Bailiff Kelly that if the
police would rest ; , satisfied on holding him
on the three charges of attempt he would
be willing to be tried in tbe Superior Court
because he would get a light sentence.

DISASTERS AND DEATHS.
Sixteen of the Crew of the Ameri
can Ship ; Roanoke Were ,
Disabled.
BATTERED ROUNDING THE HORN
Two Sailors Fell From Aloft and Were
Killed and One Was Lost
Overboard.
Death and disaster seem'to have followed
the American ship Roanoke from the mo
ment she left New York on June 20, 1895.
The following is the captain's short but
graphic description of the voyage:
Sailed from New York June 20, 1805.
June 29, G. XV. Dobbins, a native of the
nited States, fell from the .mizzen royal yard
and was killed instantly. :
Was forty days to the "equator. Got the south
east trades in SN. and lost them in 18 S. , and
from there to 44 S. had very hard gales and
heavy seas.
August 26. latitude 42 8., shipped a heavy
sea which disabled eight of the watch on deck.
August 28, Oscar Spennet, a native of Fin-
land, fell from the foretopsail yard to the deck
and was killed.
August 28, B. G. Palm, a native of Denmark,
fell from the. foretopsail yard overboard and
was lost. S&SMSI?
August 29, kept the ship off for Montevideo,
having but eight men on deck. Could not
fetch that port, so kept on for Rio de Janeiro.
Arrived at Rio September 10 and put sixteen
of the crew in the hospital, and sailed again
I October 28.
Had strong easterly gales to 40 south. From
thence to Cape Horn had variable winds and
line weather. Was thirty days from 50 to 50.
Had strong westerly gales west of Cape Horn.
Got the southeast trades in 33 south and 96
west and had them strong and carried them to
3 north. , . . '../.A-.-.
Was nineteen days from 50 south 80 west to.
the equator. _ Crossed the equator in the Pa
cific January 4in 117 west. Got the northeast
trades in 3:10 north and carried them to 22
north 128 west. From there |to the Farallon
Rocks had southerly winds and "fine .weather,
with a very heavy swell from the southwest.
Sighted Farallon Rocks January 21, 87 days
from Rio and 213 days from New York.
When the Roanoke was reported there
was a flutter in the quarantine office, and
Dr. Chalmers at once notified the Board of
Health. The vessel was known to have
been in Rio de Janeiro, and in that port
both yellow fever and smallpox were
epidemic. Dr. Williamson responded to
the quarantine officer's call, and together
they visited the ship. Not a single case of
sickness was found on board, ana in spite
of the troublous times and the storms she
had passed through the vessel looked
more like a yacht than the biggest
American merchantman afloat. Captain
Hamilton reported that while he lay in
Rio de Janeiro there had been six deaths
from yellow fever and 141 from small
pox, but as the vessel had been eighty
seven days on the way here and there was
i no sign of disease aboard it was decided to
j allow her to enter.
The Koanoke took in no cargo at Rio,
and as nearly all that she has aboard is
railroad iron for the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad there could be no fear of infec
tion from that source. The entire crew
was also revaccinated before the ship
sailed again.
From the day we left New York until we
reached Rio de Janeiro we had nothing but
hard luck, said Harry Jones, one of * the orig
inal crew, yesterday. .
When Dobbins fed from the mlszen-royal a
few days after we were at sea all the old
timers said the ship was going to have bad
luck. I For a couple of months, however, there
was nothing to bear out the assertion, and
then by all mat's glorious if it did not come on
us in aheap. ' " â¢ "
; It was along in August and the ship was
making heavy weather ' of it. We were under
snug canvas, but wave after wave was break
ing aboard, and the watch on deck had hard
work of it dodging the 5 water .'. as it swept from
stem to stern. Suddenly a, heavier one than
usual came rolling along, and just as the warn
ing cry came from aft it broke aboard, and the
entire starboard watch was washed into the
scuppers. When the watch below had been
called and the disabled men cared for it was
found 1 that only three out of the eight were
able to get around. Even those three had to
take to their bunks next day, and they had to
be left behind at Rio.
. Our troubles seemed to have only just begun,
however, as two days later Spennert and Palm
were lost from the foretopsail yard. Spennert
tell to the deck and was killed instantly, while
Palm fell overboard and was never seen again.
After that we ran into a succession of gales,
and when we did finally reach Rio de Janeiro
sixteen of the men had to be sent to the
hospital. A . more - battered, disconsolate look
ing set of men I never saw leave a ship. The
captain and the American Consul did every
thing possible for them, and they will reach
home all right, It was the most disastrous
and hardest voyage I ever made j around the
Horn, and I don't want another one like it.
Strange to say the ship was damaged very
little, but the crew made up for her escape.
' The Roanoke is " built on * exactly the
same lines as the Shenandoah, and is the
largest American merchantman afloat.
She is 3539 tons gross register, and can
carry over. sooo â¢ tons : dead weight. Her
length is 311 feet 2 inches, breadth 49 feet
2 inches and : depth 20 feet 2 inches. She
was; built in 1802 in Bath, Me., and is
owned by Sewell & Co. of that port. .

ITALIAN NEWSPAPER ROW
A Jury of Four Has at Last
Been Appointed to End
the War.
Now the Waiting Public Will Be
Informed Who Slew the
Abyssinians.
The lively exchange of compliments be
tween L'ltalia and La Voce del Popolo
over the question of who slew the 10,000
Abyssinians, has at 'last resulted in the
formation of a jury to decide which news
paper must enrich the poor of the Italian
colony with the sum of $100.
To defend the statement that its tele
gram came from a reliable source, L'ltalia
has named .as its judges G. F. Cavalli
and P. C. Rossi. The former edits L'Elve
zia and is an able newspaper man. La
Voce del Popolo has secured two well
known members of the colony. A. Sbar
boro and P. Barbieri to uphold its chal
lenge: that L'ltalia's telegram narrating
the deaths of 10,000 Abyssinians before
Makalle was a pleasing figment of the
editorial brains which sway that news-
paper. .
During the week that the controversy
has raged about the authenticity of the
telegram, the two journals have said some
very pretty things of one another. -
La Voce, in the course of some honeyed
remarks relative to its loathed contem
porary, insinuated that the acting editors,
Signori Almagia and Patrizi, were in
danger of having their ears pulled by the
management of their paper, for excess of
zeal in fabricating the .telegram and after
ward backing it up by a bet of $100. This
inuendo brought forth the following pro
test from the management of L'ltalia: .
"As the magnates of the management
never poke their noses into the editorial
department of L'ltalia, and the ear-pull
ings to which the Swiss-Italian journal al
ludes will perhaps be the order of the day
on Montgomery street, but not at 627
Washington street, so we think it well to
draw the attention of the public to the fact
that Signori Almagia and Patrizi. who
bear the editorial responsibility of L'ltalia.
have bet thesloo out of their own pockets."
" The decision of the jury is looked for
ward to with deep interest by every one at
North Beach who is conversant with the
Italian language. The four gentlemen
who have been selected are all well known
to the readers of the two papers and they
all inspire perfect confidence. If they fail to
come to a decision they are empowered to
name a fifth juryman who shall have the
casting vote.

the space into a lounging-room. The lot
adjoining the building on the west side
will be leased for a terra of ten yearsâthat !
is, if the club can arrive at a - satisfactory I
agreement with the owner of the property
which is now quite probable. . '
A magnificent handball court, which

petent instructor will be engaged to teach I

cording to the latest and most approved i
style, a la Jack Mallon.
..." The roof will ; be of glass, with netting
underneath so as to prevent any possible
damage being done by the high-toned ball
strikers. The court at night will present a
decidedly brilliant appearance, as the
most powerful electric lights will shine
down upon the athletes when they are at
play. . , â  .*; ,
â¢ A grand boxing tournament open to the
amateurs of the Pacific Coast will be held
at the Mechanics' Pavilion under the aus

this tournament the grandest feature in
the way of fisticuffs that has ever been in
troduced west of the Rocky Mountains.

TWO COLLEGES TO UNITE
University of the Pacific to Cen
tralize Its Schools at
San Jose.
TO REMOVE THE NAPA COLLEGE
Trustees Take Definite Action at a
Meeting Yesterdayâ An Enter
tainment.
The board of directors of- the Univer
sity of the' Pacific held a meeting at the
Y. M. C. A. building yesterday.
The future policy of the university re
specting its educational department was
discussed at length and it was decided to
consolidate the Napa and San Jose schools
at the latter place. The college at Napa
will be closed at the end of this term.
The reasons for this change are that
the new conditions of education on the
coast, such as the opening of tbe Stanford
University, somewhat reducing patronage,
and. a conviction on the part of the trus
tees that one school of college grade would
serve the requirements of the denomina
tion. . .'Ap/yAAT 'r
The school at San Jose known as the
San jose College, and located at College
Park, will henceforth be known as the
University ol the Pacific, with its affiliated
schools, . the conservatory of music and
the school of art, also located at College
Park. " â  ' t
By this arrangement all graduates of
Napa College and all degrees issued by the
institution will be recognized by the new
university. â¢*-.-;/
The Napa property, consisting of college
buildings, halls and about twelve acres of
land, will bo put on the market at once.
By .a condition of the consolidation
the endowments of Napa College are to
be held in special trust to establish a
Methodist 7 theological seminary in T San
Francisco when the time shall be deemed
advisable. When the- present subscrip
tions are collected the entire debt on both
institutions will be. wiped out, and the
new university will thus have an endow
ment of $50,000. ,
In connection with the readjustment,
Dr. J. N. Beard, who has been president
of the combined institutions, presented
his resignation, to follow out a plan of
study abroad. He will leave next week. .

NEW TO-DAY.
fj Centuries ago, peo-
/W*v- // A pie used to fear what
vwW^/^jL A they called the pes-
\^7ivllii tilence. "Black
jJ&ifi-tp^^Jiffm Death ' ' was the
xtU Eg ie*Jiili most terrible thing
' AWt WW iwHÃin the world to them.
ax\aWv^a\wa\ ffijpr^They feared it as
Bars JB^- l 1 people now fear the
Â¥ JmWT'^l. ! Cholera and Yellow
I mr ff>- ML Fever. And yet
smmmm* v(wW there is a more terri-
/^TVsg- D * e thing than any
â ^ (rf Br' of these. There is
vr M a thing that causes
A more misery aud
more, deaths than
any of these. It is the commonest trouble
that human beings suffer from. It is so
common that nine-tenths of all the sickness
in the world is traceable to it. It is merely
that simple,, common thingâ constipation.
There is no telling what it may.lead to, but
it is sure to lead to something bad. j Its im-
mediate effects are .unpleasant in the ex-
treme. It makes people listless, gives
them headaches, makes the digestion poor,
causes dizziness, loss of appetite, loss of
sleep, foul breath and distress after eating.
All this merely because Nature has been
imposed upc>n, and has been refused the
little help she needed.
This little help is furnished by Doctor
Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. . One pill is a
gentle laxative and two a mild cathartic.
There are two remarkable things about the
"Pellets." One is that they never gripe;
the other that they cure permanently.
There is no other medicine that does cure
permanently. You can take any othrr
medicine you like, as long as you like, .'.3d
if you stop, your trouble will come back
quickly, and the chances are the trouble
will be worse than it was before. This
isn't true of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets.
You take them until you get yourself into
perfect working order, and then you stop.
You don't have to take any more ' Pellets "
unless after a while you do something that
deranges your digestive system again. We
are not guessing about these facts, and we
don't ask you to take our unsupported word
for it. Thousands of people have found
that they are true, and have ; testified to
them. Let the druggist who says that some-
thing else is "just as good " sell that some-
thing else to somebody else. Don't let him
trifle with your health for the sake of a
little more profit to himself.
