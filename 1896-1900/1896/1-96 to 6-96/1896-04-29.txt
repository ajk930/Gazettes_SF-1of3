PRETORIA, Sooth Africa, April 23.â
Five of the leaders of the National Reform
Committee who pleaded guilty of high
treason yesterday were condemned to
death to-day at the sitting of the court.
They are: Colonel Francis Rhodes,
brother of Cecil Rhodes, ex-Premier of the
tape Colony ; Lionel Phillips, George
Farrar, Charles Leonard and John Hays
Hammond, the American mining en
gineer.
Phillips, Rhodes and Farrar pleaded
guilty of high treason on Friday last, and
Hammond, who was ill and- not in court
that day, made a similar plea. This
couise, it was thought, would have an
effect to mitigate severity of their sen
tence. " . <-"'"â *?-
In view of the plea of guilty entered by
the defendants, there was nothing in the
way of cross-examination to elicit testi
mony on the question of the ultimate re
sponsibility for the Jameson movement.
But counsel for the defense read a statement
which was signed by John Hays Ham
mond, Lionel Phillips, George Farrar and
Colonel Francis Rhodes, the leaders of
the Reform Committee, who hare pleaded
guilty of high treason.
Tins statement reviews the recent his
tory of the futile agitation for redress of
the alleged Uitlander grievances in the
Transvaal. The statement admits that in
the face of rumors current that the Boers
were going to attack Johannesburg the
signers had asked Dr. Jameson to come,
but that they deplored the mistake he had
made in coming when there was no urgent
need for his presence. They maintained
thai their action had not been hostile to '
the republic, its officials'- having been pro
tected and life and property having, been
generally' preserved. They sent officers
on December 27, the statement says, to
forbid the movement on Dr. Jameson's
part. '"*- ;.3_3 â ,: :3^~ . â ' â¢ \.'y
In addition to this signed statement
telegrams were rend which passed between
Mr. Belt of the Chartered South African
Company and Dr. Jameson, Colonel Fran
cis Rhodes and others, but not Cecil
Rhodes, the then Premeir of Cape Colony.
Following the presentation of the docu
ments counsel made a speech of two hours'
duration in behalf of the defense, conclud
ing as follows: 3V-.3
"If the edge of the sword is to be used it
will cause eternal misery in the republic,
but should the flat site be employed it
would usher in peace and good will."
Among other members of the reform
committee who were sentenced to-day are
four Americans â Captain Mem, chief en
gineer of the Robinson Gold Mining Com
pany, Victoria; B. Clement, assistant con
sulting engineer of the Consolidated Gold
Fields Mining Company; J. S. Curtis, a
wealthy mining . engineer who is well
known in New York, and a Mr. Lawley.
They were sentenced to pay a fine of $10,
--000 each, to undergo two years' imprison
ment and then be banished from the Trans
vaal for three years.
STRING ON THE SENTENCE.
Kruger Will Abrogate the Penalty
of Death.
LONDON, Exg., April 28.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day Chamberlain, Secre
tary of State for the Colonies, said: "1
have received a private telegram saying
that five of the leaders of -the so-called
National Reform Committee at Johannes
burg have been condemned to death. ~ I
thereupon cabled to Sir Hercules Robin
son at Cape Town instructions to commu
nicate the following to President Krueger:
â¢The Government has just learned that
sentence of death has been imposed upon
the chief leaders of the reform committee.
The Government has' no doubt that your
Honor will commute the sentences." In
deed the Government has assured Parlia
ment that this is your Honor's intention.' "
A report was circulated and generally
credited in the lobby of the House of
Commons that Colonial Secretary Cham
berlain advised the surrender of Colonel
Rhodes and his comrades to the legal
authorities at Pretoria, and also advised
them to enter a j plea of guilty upon the
assurance that the Pretoria authorities
would treat them with leniency. The op
position are framing a series of questions
to be propounded to the Government with
the object of forcing them to make revela
tions showing precisely what part the
English Government . has played 'in . the
affair.
The Globe, in an article jon '. the con
damnation of Rhodes, Hammond and the
others to death, says : This j news absorbs
the entire interest of the House of Com
mons. The consensus of opinion is that
the condemned men are in no real danger,
but the feeling is unanimous that in the
event of the contrary there must be in
stant war.3, It will be impossible for even
the present Government" to hold office for
a day if any other course were taken.
Though the news of the ; death sentence
passed on the five leaders of the Johan
nesburg Government was a {surprise and
shock to those here who have watched the
case," politicians inside and outside of
Parliament admit that the sentence is the
natural complement of, the plea of
guilty. Nobody here believes the sen-,
tence will be - executed. It is â¢ thought
that under the law under which ' the

accused were tried there was no
course open to the court but to impose the
death penalty. It is believed 1 now that
the arrangement between the ... prisoners
and the Transvaal authorities provided
for the passage of the {death sentence,
while at the same time the five' men knew
that the President would exercise the
power with which he is invested, and later
commute the sentences. 3333
What the general feeling among; the
Boers is toward the prisoners is a matter
of doubt. Before the trouble at Johannes
burg they were all very popular, but there
was a significant incident in connection
with their arrest that is not generally
Known.:
Shortly after they were lodged in the
jail at Pretoria a number of Boers took to
that city a beam on which some years pre
viously the ; British had Â£ hanged several
Boers for treason. "When the attention of
the Government was called to this fact a
prompt disclaimer of any implied threat
to hang the prisoners was made and it was
asserted that the beam had been taken to
Pretoria to be us jd for building purposes.

tion to Dr. Jameson to go to the relief of

nation is given in the dispatch, of the in

lesser members of the committee who were
condemned to fine/ imprisonment and ban

poned was erroneous. 'â  * <-:
The Morning Post will say that the sen
tences will stir 'racial feeling and undo all

immediately. aggravate the situation. -33

mentary alarm is causeless and adduces
its reasons for the assumption. It thinks
that the prisoners are likely to eventually
escape with punishments in proportion to
the gravity of their offense. ; â¢ * /
The Standard holds that whether or not
the extravagant and 'vindictive penalties
were intended to *be effected they ought
not to have been passed..

tences are regarded /with equanimity .-. here
solely, because 3it is â¢; perceived that they

rank/and file of the* committee. The pub-
does f not rely on President' Kruger's
magnanimity, but common - sense. To
carry out the sentences would be a politi
cal blunder as well as a crime. â¢* I
This fact, is so obvious that it must suf
fice to induce a man much more fanatical
and' less humane than President {Kruger to
commute the penalties without delay.
:; The Time's and other papers dwell upon
the likelihood of a revulsion of the feeling
against, the Afrikanders everywhere in fa
vor of the Uitlanders, if the penalties are en
forced. >s Mere than half of the sixty lesser,
members of the committee are Africanders
and most of them were \ proved guilty of
little more than sympathy with the objects
of the reformers. .'..

AN INVESTIGATION
OF ARMOR PLATE
Secret Testimony of the
Senate Committee Made
Public.
FOLGER BADLY SCORED.
While a Commander in the
Navy He Took a Salary
From a Corporation.
MR. CARNEGIE'S PHILANTHROPY
Merely Went Into the Business to
Help Out the Unite
' " States.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 28.-The
Senate Committee on Naval Affairs this
morning made public the testimony re
cently taken by it in secret sessions on the
subject of armor plate, the prices paid
therefor and the ownership of patented
processes of manufacture, under the reso
lution of Senator Chandler of December
13 last. The testimony comprises 421
printed pages. ;3 VV''33':-:-'.\
In the specifications laid before the com
mittee by Mr. Chandler was one referring
to Commander Folger, stating that while
chief of the Ordnance Bureau in the navy
he had induced the trial of the Harvey
patent and the adoption of the process in
the manufacture of armor by reason of an
understanding that he should be employed
in the company organized by Mr. Harvey
and have an interest therein; that he re
signed his position in the bureau, and
while continuing to be a commander in
the navy accepted employment from the
Harvey Company for a salary of $5000 per
year and a bonus of 200 shares of stock in
the company and went abroad to negotiate
contracts with foreign governments for the
use of the Harvey process. *j-
Commodore Foiger, in his testimony,
says no offer of any description of shares
or other remuneration was made prior to
his leaving the department January 1,
1893.
The Harvey matter had, Mr. . Folger
said, nothing to do with his resignation.
He was with that, company only five
months out of his two years' leave of ab
sence.
At one stage in the examination Mr.
Folger said that with his "present light
and the notoriety of things" he believed
he should not have cone into the Harvey
matter. He did not, however, think he
had done any wrong. Much of Comman
der Folger's testimony under cross-exami
nation by Senator Chandler related to the
various companies by whicn he had been
employed during his various leaves of ab
scence. '.y.7 : -777c7i7. -'..7-y--.
Commander Folger, in one part of j his
examination, said the cost of production
of armor plate was much less than the
Government paid for it. It would be prac
ticable, he thought, for the Government
to manufacture plate, but the question
was, could the Government employ its
plant at times when there would be no de
mand for armor plate ; if not, would there
not be a deterioration ?
He thought there had been an under
standing between the Carnegie and Beth
lehem people with relation to the bids
they had made. During the investigation
into the making of the plate Mr. Wharton
of the Bethlehem Company indicated that
the two concerns in this countryâBethle
hem and Carnegieâ hot permit the
proposed plant of the Government to be
successful. On this line he said : "If the
Government should compete by setting up
a plant I think human nature is such that
the establishments now existing would
try to see that they were not going to be
injured by the construction of the Govern
ment plant."
Mr. Carnegie said he would never have
gone into the manufacture of armor plate
had not Secretary Tracy and President
Harrison requested him to do so as a duty
to help the United States out of its diffi
culty when its ships were in the stocks
and it could not get armor.
. In reply to a further question as to why
he went into the business, Mr. Carnegie
said to the committee: "Because the
President of the United States and Secre
tary of the Navy had told us that the
United States Government was in a diffi
culty, and if the President of the United
States were to ask me to-day to double our
armor plant I would do it. If he were to
ask me to go to Kamschatka for . the
United States, I would do - it. I never
went into this business for money. I know
better." ' -*_

Naval Appropriation Bill
Discussed by the

Retired Officers Prohibited From
Working for Corporations

GORMAN RIDICULES HERBERT.
Sneers at the Pretensions of the Sec
retary to Become a Great
Admiral.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 28.â The
whole of to-day's session in the Senate
was occupied in the consideration of the
naval appropriation bill. The first two
hours passed in the discussion of- the
amendments offered on Monday from the
Committee on Naval Affairs prohibiting
officers of the navy or marine corps on the
retired list from taking employment in the
service of the persons or corporations
having contracts with the Government for
the supply of material. The amendment
was finally agreed toâ ayes 45, noes 11.
The remainder of the day's session was
occupied by a speech of Gorman of Mary
land on an amendment offered by him t
reduce the number of battle-ships provided
for in the bill from four to two.
The speech was almost entirely on polit
ical lines, although Gorman did not spare
members of his own party, especially the
Secretary of the Navy, whom be ridiculed
for his pretensions to become a great
admiral. .
Senators Sherman of Ohio and Hale of
Maine took part in the discussion, which
had assumed quite an animated character.
The amendment went over without action,
and the Senate adjourned until to-morrow.

Debates on the Law to Regulate . Bank
ruptcy.
WASHINGTON, D. C., April After
passing the general pension bill by a vote
of 187 to 54 the House entered upon a five
days' consideration of the bankruptcy bill.
The pension bill was supported by. the
votes of the Republicans and Cummings
and Walsh of New .' â  Yortc,''-. Lay ton _ and
Sorg of Ohio, FitzpatricK. Marr and Down
ing of Illinois, Democrats.
General debate on the bankruptcy bill
will continue to-morrow and Thursday,
and on Friday and Saturday it will be con
sidered under the five-minute rule for
amendments until 4 o'clock on the latter
day, when a vote will be taken on the
passage. Notice was given by Bailey (D.)
of Texas that one or two . substitutes for
the pending bill will be offered for the
action of the House ;by friends of volun
tary bankruptcy only. The 3 opening
speech of the debate was made by General
Henderson (R.) of lowa in support 3of the
bill, which is practically the Torrey bill,
providing for both voluntary and involun
tary bankruptcy. 3 * '.
Some miscellaneous business was trans
acted, including the passage of a bill :to
place John N. Quackenbush on the retired
list of the navy by a vote of 161 to 49. This
bill was intended to cure what has bean
considered by 3 the 3 beneficiary and : ; his

.3 Bartlett asked Mahany if he was a mem
ber of the Foreign Affairs Committee. :
"No, sir," t said the New York ; represen
tative, "but I am a member of this House
and have a right to seek the protection of
an American citizen anywhere on the
globe." [Applause.] ;
Representative Hill of Connecticut in
terrupted and said:
' "My constituents some time ago re
quested me to intercede with the State
Department in behalf of these prisoners
and I addressed a communication to the
Secretary of . State concerning the matter,
and received the usual American ; reply
'that the interests of American citizens in
the Transvaal were being guarded by the
English Government.' y. .
"I think it is high time," he continued
emphatically "that the American Govern
ment protected the interest of their own
citizens." 3 â â * 7 .{./.-
Loud and prolonged applause greeted this
utterance, whereupon McCreary of Ken
tucky/formerly chairman of the Foreign
Affairs committee and now a member of
that body, said he thought the State De
partment would afford ample protection
for all American interests in the Trans
vaal. He thought the committee could be
relied upon to promptly act (if Congres
sional action was necessary at all). He
therefore entered an objection. Mahany
said he had no desire to reflect upon the
State Department. #
At this juncture Hitt, Chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, came into the
hall; and Mahany requested him to ex
press his view 3, but beiore Hitt could re
ply the Speaker ruled that McCreary's ob
jection prevailed, arid further discussion
was brought to a close.
The resolution was then referred to the
Foreign Affairs Committee at the request
of Mahany. . 33 â¢
The news of Hammond's sentence was
received on the Senate side at about the
same time and Senators Stewart and
Jones of Nevada immediately circulated
the following petition among their col
leagues in the chamber:
To President Kruger, Transvaal Government,
South Africaâ Sib: The undersigned members
ol the Senate of the House of Representatives
of the United States of America respectively
represent that John Hays Hammond is a
citizen of the United States and a man of high
character connected with one of the best
families of the country and an engineer of
ability. We regret exceedingly his unfort
unate connection with the troubles in your
country, for which all our people entertain
feelings Of kindness and respect-
In view of the unimpeachable character of
Mr. Hammond in his own country and the
high standing of his friends and relations we
earnestly ask for him your most kindly consid
eration. If your Excellency would extend to
him a pardon for his offenses against your
Government we would esteem it an especial
compliment to us as well as to the people of
the United States. Hoping Mr. Hammond
will be relieved from the penalty of his asso
ciations we are your most obedient servants.
The petition was signed by every Sen
ator who was then in the chamber. It
will be forwarded through the State De
partment.
Immediately after this petition had been
circulated Senator Perkins received a tele
phone message from the State Department
conveying the ; information that a cable
gram had been received . from Consul
Knight at Cape Town to the effect that it
was the Consul's understanding that the
sentence of death would be commuted and
only a nominal fine imposed. This was
welcome news to Senators Perkins, White,
Jones and Stewart. 333 -* :
Senator Perkins to-night received the
following telegram from San Francisco :-, .
Please have the California delegation cail in
a body on President , Cleveland and ask his
immediate intervention in behalf ,of John
Hays - Hammond, under sentence in South
Africa. William H. Crocker, William . Alvord,
Thomas Brown and many others.
Senator Perkins said to the Call .cor
respondent to-night: 33^3 3,3-3 'â¢ ' " '/ . .
"The California "delegation will call on
President Cleveland: and Secretary Olney
to-morrow in response to the. request. I
feel sure that Mr. Hammond would never
have' pleaded guilty had he not received
an assurance beforehand that his punish
ment would be light. When I read the
telegram to-day announcing . that Ham
mond had been sentenced to death I was
greatly shocked, but as I reflected about
ihe matter I was firmly impressed with
the belief that before : Mr. Hammond
entered his plea he had received assurance
that his punishment would be light.
â¢' A few minutes later we received a tele
phone message from Secretary Olney
stating that news had been received from
Cape Town to the effect that '. Hammond'*
sentence would probable be commuted to
a nominal fine. I cannot understand how,
or why j Hammond should have pleaded
guilty to 3* high treason as the dispatches
state. He was an American, and as such
could not have been guilty of treason.'
He might have been guilty of ''con
spiracy,' but my understanding of ' trea
son' implies an offense of a citizen against
his own country. This is the understand
ing of Secretary Olney also, who stated to
me some mouths ago that he thought
Hammond must have been accused of
'conspiracy' and not 'treason.' How
ever, whether the accusation is one or the
other, we must leave no stone unturned to
protect Our fellow-citizen. I feel sure his
sentence will be commuted, but we must
make assurance doubly sure."
Senator White to-night expressed the
same views. as Perkins. The belief is
general that Hammond and his fellow
prisoners will only receive light sentences.

received from the State Department offi

Hammond was safe, and the cablegram

MRS. HAMMOND'S SISTER'
Seriously 111, but Her Husband Gets
Cheering News.
BOSTON, Mass., April 28.â John
T. â¢ Roderick, a sister of Mrs. John Hays
Hammond, is confined to her home on
Custer street, Jamaica Plain, with nerv
ous prostration. Her condition is ' ex
tremely serious. Her husband received a
telegram from Washington to-night ad
vising him that the sentence of Mr. Ham
mond would probably be commuted to
exile from the Transvaal.
PRESIDENT KRUGER'S REPLY.
Confirms the Statements . Made by
Chamberlain.
LONDON, Esq., April 28. -The full text
or the reply of President Kruger of the
Transvaal Republic to the invitation to
him by Colonial Secretary Chamberlain to
visit London and discuss Transvaal mat
ters is published, to-day. The letter con
firms the statements made by Mr. Cham
berlain in the House of Commons yester
day, as well as the statements of the Times
in regard to the character of the reply,
though it denies the so-called admitted
grievances of the Uitlanders with a view of
promoting friendly relations. It says Presi
dent Kruger is willing to postpone the
question of the revision of the London
convention of 1884. . 33!
RELATIVES ARE 'HOPEFUL.
General Harris Speaks of the Efforts
to Save Hammond.
General N. H. Harris, uncle of Mrs.
John Hays Hammond, could offer no ex
planation of the startling dispatch from
South Africa. All through the difficulty
between Hammond and the Boer Govern
ment and the subsequent trial it was Gen
eral Harris who corresponded quietly
with his niece's husband and who figured :
most prominently as a mediator v and
friend of the imprisoned mining engineer.
In the present crisis, however, he has re
ceived not the slightest notification from
the Transvaal..
''All I know about the matter is what I
can glean from the press dispatches," said
he. "I have received no message direct,
nor has any of our friends in town that I
know of. Yet this fact is no reason why
we should build hopes that something
wholly unexpected had happened. Mrs.
Hammond is with her husband. She has
never left him during this trouble. I. am
inclined to think that she would send a
dispatch direct, although possibly they all
know there that the press dispatches
reach us as quickly as private ones, and
that the press accounts are longer and, of
course, correct. On that account Mrs.
Hammond may have decided not to send
me a cablegram. ' *3.
"Have you taken any steps in the mat
ter?" he was asked.
"None," was the- reply of General
Harris. "What could Ido under the cir
cumstances? I am waiting 'to hear
further details, but have not the faintest
idea as to when they may come, or what
they may be. I may get news to-night.
. "While the news is alarming it is hard
to believe it is correct. We have assur
ances from the Secretary of State that
Mr. Hammond's life was not in danger.
The law of the case is now well known
here. The penalty prescribed by the Boer
constitution for treason was stated to be
banishment and confiscation of personal
property. And yet in time of war, when
martial law obtains,, things might- be dif
lerent in the event of a court-martial. -:
R. P. HAMMOND'S SORROW.
Overcome by the News of His
Brother's Sentence.
Richard P. Hammond, the brother of
John Hayes Hammond, was overcome by
the news from the Transvaal, and left his
office at 26 O'Farrell street early in the
day. He left instructions that he was
going home and did not wish to be dis
turbed by anybody, as he wanted to be
left alone. Soon afterward a second dis
patch arrived bearing the pleasant news
that Hammond's sentence of death had
been commuted. This was a great relief
to Richard, who spent the afternoon and
evening in his residence receiving friends.
"I don't know what to make of it," he
said. "I have no private information from
my brother. In fact, the only news we
have of this is from the newspaper cable
grams. I can't say whether it is true, but
as my brother has committed no serious
offense I cannot believe he was ' con
demned to death.
'"1 have nothing to say about the mat
ter, but if our Government was not so lax
about this difficulty the whole dispute
would have been settled long ago and my
brother would be a free man to-day. Dr.
Jameson, the leader, is enjoying himself
at liberty, while my brother is said to be
convicted of treason and sentenced to
death, and then his sentence was com
mutedâl don't know to what."
'â¢It is incredible to me how this oc
curred," continued Mr. Hammond. "My
brother is '*' the victim of circumstances.
He should not have been imprisoned even,
let alone being sentenced to death.
â¢-He knows very little about politics and
cares little. He is a student and a great
mining engineer. The testimony as pub
lished showed that be was only one among
thirty or forty who signed the call.
"How is it that they didn't sentence
Jameson in this way? frhey thought that
he was the arch schemjer, because he was
â¢connected with Cecil> Rhodes. But the
fact is he was associated with him purely
in a mining -way:*" He was not in politics.
"If he had been /an Englishman he
would have been 'enjoying his liberty in
England now, but being an American he
has to suffer, and being a Californian he
has to suffer so much the more.
"Our Government has been too busy at
tending to other things and has neglected
the Americans, of whom there are 167 in
jail, and has allowed one man to become a
martyr.
"Not for four months have I been able
to get a word by letter or cable from my
brother, and not even a word from his
wife. .
"1 will tell you this, too: E. M. Pres
ton of Nevada City, who is the Master
Mason of California and the coast, asked
as a favor two months ago to communicate
with Jack, who is a Mason, through Presi
dent Cleveland, and has not been yet able
to do it.
"I was one of the Presidential electors
during tbe last national campaign, and
was president of the California electoral
delegation that cast the first vote for the
nomination of President Cleveland. I had
a great deal to do in helping to elect Mr.
Cleveland in California.
v. "I never expected to have to appeal to
him. I wish sincerely when I did that he
had helped me." â¢

Getting Ready for the

BIG RALLY IN ILLINOIS.
At Springfield the Forces of
McKinley and Cullom Are
Arrayed.
BOLD STAND OF THE SENATOR.
Adherents Who Will Battle Against
Giving Instructions to the
Delegates.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 28.â 0n the
eve of what will be the largest and prom
ises to be the most stormy convention in
the history of the Republicans of Illinois,
the situation is decidedly chaotic. From
the most conservative estimates, based
upon the counties that have instructed for
or indorsed ex-Governor McKinley, the
friends of the Ohio candidate up to this
morning lacked but a few score delegates
out of a total accredited to the convention
of 1335 to secure the adoption of ironclad
instructions. But the McKinleyites, while
having the delegates, the sympathy and
enthusiasm, have lacked organization, co
hesiveness and, above all, a tactful and
resourceful leader. -â¢ - ."
On the other hand, the managers of the
State machine, all of them adroit politi
cians, have brought to their aid some of
the most skillful manipulators to be gath
ered from all parts of the State, and have
brought into play all their influence, au-
thority, artifice and argument to a two
fold purpose â one to. convince the dele-
gates whose conventions indorsed McKin
ley that indorsements are not instructions,
and the other to stem the threatened tidal
wave to McKinley from the ranks of the
uninstructed delegates.
It has been a day of fine work rather
than of excitement and noisy enthusiasm,
and while the McKinley element claims
not only to have held its own but to have
secured enough additional pledges to make
its victory certain, the opposition is ap
parently more confident and certainly
more defiant than twenty-four hours ago.
The bringing of Senator Cullom from
â¢Washington is conceded by both sides to
have been a master-stroKe on the part of
the State managers. -The senior Senator
has held forth at his headquarters with
scarcely an intermission for refreshment
or conference since an early hour this
morning, and hundreds of country dele
gates have been piloted to his immediate
neighborhood by his lieutenants. Never,
even in the most of the exciting and closely
fought contests for his own preferment to
high office, has Senator Cullom been more j
tactful or earnest than to-day. State pride,
old acquaintanceship, past friendship and
favors, his own record as a stalwart Re
publican, have been urged, and appeals
were made to keep the uninstructed ones
from aiding iv sending to St. Louis four
leleeates-at-large implicitly instructed for
the Ohioan. <r^77.
That the Senator's arguments and plead
ings have had their weight with a large
number of delegates is to-night admitted
.by McKinley's followers. Neither side is
jiving out figures. The tug of war will
come just as socn as the permanent or
ganization has been effected.
The State Central Committee baa se
lected Alderman M. B. Madden of Chicago
is temporary chairman, while its choice
for the regular presiding officer, Senator
Drville F. Berry, will be accepted by the
.ommittee on permanent organization.
Both of these selections are satisfactory to
;he McKinley leaders. Speaker W. T.
Calhoun of Danville, a skilled parlia
mentarian, aggressive and courageous,
has been selected to lead the McKinley
onslaught and his efforts will be seconded
5v the venerable ex-Governor "Uncle
Dick" Oglesby, who is now en route from
ais country home.
The candidates of the managers for dele
gates are ex-Governor Fifer of Blooming
ion. William Perm Nixon and R. W. Pat
terson of Chicago and David Littler of
this city. .. * -* . .
The McKinleyites have not agreed upon
a ticket beyond the names of ex-Governor
Dglesby and â¢ Mayor Swift of j Chicago.
Patterson and Fifer, however, would be
satisfactory to them, provided instructions
ire voted. , - .
Outside of Captain Lanner for Governor
and H. L. Hertz of Chicago for State
Treasurer, it is a free-for-all race for the
State ticket. The Presidential question
svershadows all others, and the head
quarters of the legion of candidates were
.linost deserted to-day. Emissaries of the
machine were busy to-day endeavoring to
â¢ffect deals with some of the country dele
gations who have favorite sons for State
>fficers and are also instructed for McKin
ley, by which their support would be
â¢brown to such candidates on the con
iition that the delegations reject their
instructions. In every case reported, how
ever, the overtures were rejected. :3;3;
The convention has brought to the city
i throng estimated at from lb, COO to 15,000,
md the brass bands, glee clubs, street
;rowds, curbstone debaters, and other
lide lights, give the atmosphere a sugges
tion of a National rather than a State con
vention.
With the view of avoiding a tempestuous
icene on the threshold of the convention
10-morrow. Slate Chairman Jamieson to
night made a compromise offer to the Mc-
Kinley committee that the matter of in
structions be voted upon after the nomi
sation of Tanner for Governor. The
:ommittee made a counter proposition
hat the question be the special order after
he nomination, for Attorney-General.
This was accepted. The McKinley leaders
â¢aye out to-night a table claiming 820
ielcgntes for McKinley instructions to 515
â gainst. 3:3:-. ... .7777
ON TBE â M ON II V QUESTION.
lively Struggle Among Michigan's Demo-
cratic Pactions.
DETROIT, Mich., April 28. â There
jromises to be an interesting time in the
Democratic State Convention to-morrow
n this city, held to choose delegates to the
National Democratic Convention.
The controversy which has been waged
n.thls. State for some years between the
idministration and anti-administration
Democrats has broken out anew, with
the difference that the adminlstrationists
are all gold standard men while anti
ad ministration ists are free silverites. The
latter have brought to their support no
small number of representatives of the
free silver doctrine, which is undoubtedly
strong in Michigan.
Tbe battle in the convention, while
really between the administration and its
opponent**, takes the form of a struggle
over the money question. To-night all
the delegates have arrived and the two
sets of opponents held caucuses in the
various hotels and indulged in wordy
debates in the lobbies. So far as the re
turns have been received the convention
promises to be evenly divided between the
advocates of a single gold standard and the
16 to 1 silverites.
In anticipation thereof the gold men
have agreed to accept a plank for the plat
form declaring in favor of free silver at a
16 to 1 ratio, the same to be appliable to
all future contracts. ' The silver party,
however, declares that the convention
shall decide "for 16 to 1 or bust."
The free-silver people had intended to
have a mass-meeting here to-night, but
their opponents stole a march on them by
hiring the only meeting place large enough
to accommodate a great crowd for the
evening for the sake of keeping it dark.
The silver people had invited Don M.
Dickinson to bring Secretary Carlisle on to
have a joint debate with Senator Tillman,
who was to have been imported for the
purpose of the occasion, but Mr. Dickinson
did not notice the invitation.

JOHN HAYS HAMMOND'S CASE.
A Committee Appointed to Work in
His Behalfâ The Annual
Parade.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cat,., April 28.â
After a long and hard contest this after
noon and evening the Native Sons decided
to hold their next Grand Parlor conven-
tion in Redwood City. The final ballot
stood as follows: Redwood City 132. San
Francisco 79. -Â» '
... In this matter the old fight of San
Francisco against the rest of the State was
brought up, the usual amend to
make San Francisco the permanent meet
ing place being offered, for consideration
next year, by Charles W. Belshaw of
Antioch. The orators who spoke for San
Francisco in the long debate were Dele
gates Belshaw and A. E. Miller of Sacra
mento, District Attorney R. C. Rust of
Amador County and Judge Prewett of
Auburn. Redwood City's champions were
Edwin A. Meserve or Los Angeles; Carroll
Cook, John T. Greany and Joseph Cum
ming of San Francisco; Thomas P. Boyd
of San Rafael, Arthur N. Hill of Eureka
and Delegates Wooster of San Jose and
Russell of Menlo Park, with especially
J. W. Cook, Grand Marshal of the Native Sons' Parade at San Luis Obispo.
[From a photograph.]
energetic work , by. Delegates -, F. W. Gien
non and Guy P. Hull of Redwood City.
A point dwelt upon by Mi*. Meserve
was that the Native Sons were a power
which would operate against the division
of the State of California whenever a ques
tion of division might be brought up. Mr.
Greany's address was an especially elo
quent and witty one, and Delegates Cum
min and Boyd distinguished themselves
as orators. The Redwood City representa
tives are jubilant over their victory, and
they are already talking over the plans of
celebration.
San Francisco.is to have the Admission
day celebration in the year 1900, and that
is consolation for the delegates who
worked for the metropolis to-day. At any
rate a vote was passed declaring it to be
the sense of this convention that the great
celebration of the first 9th or September in
the new century should be at San Fran
cisco.
Another subject of interest in the line of
future celebrations was introduced by
Frederick T. Duhring of Sonoma. Mr.
Duhring announced that the citizens of
his city were preparing to observe the
fiftieth anniversary of the raising of the
bear flag. That celebration would take
place on June 14, 1897. Sonoma had the
original llagpole, Mr. Duhring stated, and
the original hag with the misshapen bear
would be hoisted by the surviving mem
bers of the bear-flag party. .'"3 ;.>V
A matter of immediate and practical in
terest to the Native Sons was presented in
a telegram introduced by Delegate Brady of
Grass Valley. This was in relation to the
sentence of John Hays Hammond, who is
a member of Quartz Parlor. The telegram
was as follows :
Advices received here that John Hays Ham
mond has been sentenced to death. Use all
possible means to have Grand Parlor Intercede
in his behalf. "* 3* t ;'â¢'",. ~y77;j7"7;
Carroll Cook read the telegram to the
convention, by request of Air. Brady, and
made a brief statement of the case, with a
plea that every -possible effort of the order
be used to aid the political . prisoner
in Johannesburg. The only thing that
could now be done, however, would be to
urpe the California Senators to prompt,
energetic effort. A committee, to remain
in force and take whatever . action may be
at any time deemed advisable, was ap
pointed. It is composed of Frank Coombs,
M. A. Dorn, the incoming president, the
vice-president and the secretary. 33 >^>;
. The annual election for grand officers
will be held on Thursday. For grand ora
tor the contest is between Louis F. Bying
ton of San Francisco, Edwin A. Meserve
of Los Angeles and Frank Mattison of
Santa Cruz. Two strong candidates for
grand trustee are " Milton D. Garratt â  and
Milk Inspector James P. Dockery -of \ San
Francisco. Senator Eugene F. Bert is
working: in the interest of - Mr. Garratt,
arid it is believed that the latter and Mr.
Dockery will be among the seven mem
bers of the new board. Other, prominent
candidates are A. F. Brady of Grass Val
ley, P. E. Zabola of Salinas, Charles M.
Cassin of Watsonville, Dr. A. T. Hyde of
Merced and R. 17. Rust of Amador. J. B.
Blake of San Luis Obispo is a candidate
and he will \be elected according to the
custom of extending such a courtesy to
the town in which each convention is
held.
The next grand marshal will be a Stock
ton man, and delegates Nutter and Catts
are mentioned. George N. Van Or den is a
candidate for grand inside sentinel and
Joseph Norris of Centerville for grand
outside sentinel. Grand Secretary Lun
stedt and Grand Treasurer Martin will
have no opposition in the election.
Tne barbecue will take place to-morrow
forenoon at Sycamore Springs and the an
nual ball will be held in the evening at
Hotel Ramona.
The street parade this forenoon was elab
orate, the line stretching over' more than
a half-mile of streets. Some of the
features would have been quite in place at
the Santa Barbara floral display. There
were several artistic floats, and in arrang
ing for these the San Luis Obispo people
displayed the enthusiasm and enterprise
that has characterized the entire reception
of the Native Sons.
The procession was headed by Grand
Marshal James W. Cook and aids. Fol
lowing came Fred Steele Post, G. A. R., in 3
carriages; Veterans of the Mexican War,
and Veteran Firemen on foot. The First
Artillery band followed the firemen and
rendered excellent music. Chorro Lodge
I. O. 0. F., came ne_:t with a large num
ber of members, 'followed by Higuera
Lodge, A. 0. U. W. The "Days of '49"
float attracted as much attention as any,
excepting the poppy float of States, which
was adorned by many of the pretty girls
of this place. The old miners were hard
at work with rocker and pan, and one of
the scenes was of a pioneer gambling-table.
The local lodge of Elks was in the pro
cession and had a large float representing
a wildwood scene, the topping fixture of
which was an elk. * Delay in starting this
float was caused by a pair of balky horses,
and during the march some of the trees
on the wagon were raked by a low tele
phone wire.
The City Councilmen and the County
Supervisors were in carriages. . The Grand
officers of the Native Sons had the place of
honor, and each of their carriages was
drawn by four horses. Four beautiful
young women in a carriage profusely deco
rated with snowballs were Miss de la
Guerra, Miss Jack, Miss Sinsheimer and
Mi 68 Hays. The Young Men's Institute
had about fifty members in the line. A
glorious white float covered with poppies
was occupied by the native princess of the
occasion. Miss Maude Scott, and girls who
represented various States.
Another float had some pretty girls, par
tially disguised as butterflies. The stal
wart Native Sons made an imposing ap
pearance, following; the float that repre
sented California. The carriage containing
Grand President Frank 11. Dunne, Grand
Vice-President H. C. Gesford, Grand Sec
retary H. Lunsted and Grand Treasurer
H. S. Martin, drawn by four black horses,
attracted much attention. Los Osos Par
lor of this city displayed a beautiful new
banner and had all its members in the
line.
The Fire Department brought up the
rear. : The hose companies led with their
carts, upon one of which sat a tiny maiden
couched in flowers. The engine was beau-;
tifully decorated. Pretty Georgie Kelley,
7 years old, held the throttle. The hook
and ladder truck was surmounted by a big
bear. Mr. Huyck, an old pioneer, 3 also
rode upon it. He was "panning" in the
olden mining style!
, The procession was on the streets nearly
two hours. The delegates say it was one
of the most pleasant demonstrations of the
kind they have ever had. About 5000
people witnessed the march.

CONTEST SUIT IS ON TO-DAY.
American Protective Association Ad
visory Board Accused of Forming
the Compact
SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 28.â
election contest of D. W. Cozad against
John McMinn will come up for hearing
before Judge Crawford of the Superior
Court to-morrow, and public interest will
be divided between the courthouse and
the carnival. Local politicians were being
subpenaed to-day to tell what they know
of "dark-lantern" politics, and the whole
town is agog over the promised revela
tions. 33*3
The contest is over the office of Street
Commissioner of this city, to which John
McMinn was elected on the Democratic
ticket at the recent election. The oppo
nents of the successful office-seeker were
John Carleton, the Republican candidate,
and D. W. Cozad, independent. On elec
tion day Cozad declared that he was being
"jobbed" by the other two candidates, and
announced his intention of remaining in
the office, which he had then held for two
terms, and contesting in the courts the
election of the successful candidate. '
The reason given by Cozad for his early
announcement of hostilities was that both
of his opponents belonged to the Ameri
can Protective Association and that they
had agreed to abide by the decision of the
advisory board of the association as to
which should make the fight to defeat
him. The winner, he claimed, was to de
fray the expenses of election for both and
give the loser the preference in all street
work.
The election resulted in Cozad's defeat
by several hundred votes, and he at once
filed a complaint, setting forth his side
of the case. That there was no attempt
made to enjoin the council from issuing a
certificate of election to McMinn led many
to believe that the contest would not be
carried to the courts, and the assertion of
Cozad that he had in his possession a con
tract in writing, signed by all of the
parties, was laughed at by the leading
members of the American Protective Asso
ciation. 3 3:* *
To-day Mr. Cozad produced the follow
ing contract, which he declares to be an
exact copy of the original document:
contract.
This contract between John ' McMinn and
John Carleton and the advisory board of Coun
cil No. 93 of the A. P. A. of Santa Rosa, Cal.
Witnesseth: That the said parties do hereby
agree to abide the decision of the said advisory
board in the matter of selecting a candidate to
be indorsed by the A. P. A. for Street Commis
sioner in the coming city election of the city
of Santa Kosa, Cal., and do further bind them
selves that from the time they shall be informed
of the decision of said board that the candidate
not selected shall use all honorable means to
procure the election of the candidate selected
and chosen, in consideration of which the
indorsee of said board, in the event of his
election at the polls, agrees to give his unsuc
cessful competitor the preference of any and
all streetwork, and shall also refund to.him by
installments all campaign expenses.
J. McMinn.
J. Cableton.
The plaintiff will call into court to
morrow the members of the advisory
board, whom he alleges to be W. Conger,
chairman, and Frank Rhodes, Dave Kidd,
A. D. Laughlin, R. M. Miller, N. R. Shaw,
C. F. French, J. M. Streining and G. A.
Strongren. Cozad says that Attorney A.
D. Laughlin, who is retained by the de
fense, was the author of the alleged con
tract, which, he declares, was made in the
presence of Chairman Conger of the ad
visory board, and signed by McMinn in
the presence of Laughlin and Conger. He
will call these two gentlemen to the wit
ness-stand to-morrow to prove his asser
tions. : ' ' - ' ' -

the Lynching of "Jack"
Littlefield.

Captors Fled in Terror When
Bullets Whirred About
Them.
WOUNDED AND THEN HANGSD.
The Accused Officer Unable to Rec
ogniz** the Slayers of
the Vaquero.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal.. April 28.âDeD
uty Constable John Crow to-day described
in detail the lynching of "Jack" Little
field in Round Valley on September 27,
1895. It was a romantic tale. The man
who is accused of having assisted in hoist
ing the daring vaquero into the air at the
end of a rope pictured in studied phrase
the narrow escape himself had had from
the borderland vigilantes. He and Van
Horn, his superior officer, had been set
upon by a mob while returning with their
captive. Bullets rained upon them. He
saw Littlefield reel and fall after having
sprung from his horse to escape the
avengers. Then Van Horn ordered a
flight; they put spurs to their steeds and
the cowboy was left to his fate.
Darkness was settling down over the
realm of "King" George White, according
to Crow when "Jack" Littlefield died with
his boots on. There were many men in the
mob â denizens of Round Valley, where he
had lived for years â but he could recog
nize none of them in the darkness. He
had not even a faint suspicion that
silhouetted in his mind's eye the form of
any of his neighbors as among those pres
ent when Littlefield was shot. If Crow's
tale is true, Littlefield was wounded by a
bullet and then hanged. It is the opinion
of the Lone Riders that he was handed
and then riddled. At any rate the lynch
ing of the vaquero was not made as pleas
ant for the principal as it might have been.
When the taking of testimony began
this forenoon, the defense l<?d off with an
attempt to impeach the evidence of Walter
Clark, one of the strongest witnesses for
the prosecution. Clark had sworn that he
heard the shots that killed Littlefield.
Only three were fired. He was at the Red
Mountain House at the time. James J.
Carner, William Bonce, J. W. Grist, P. K.
O'Farrel and A. C. Perry, farmers and
stockraiscrs living in or near Covelo, testi
fied that they were well acquainted with
Clark and his reputation for truth, hon
esty and integrity was bad.
In the cross-examination the prosecution
endeavored -to bring in the White feud,
asking many questions tending to show
that these witnesses were friendly to
"King" George E. White and were not on
friendly terms with Sylvester Palmer, who
is at the head of the anti-White faction.
Portions of Potter's testimony, taken at
the preliminary examination in December
last, were offered in evidence, and the jury
was instructed to take notice of the fact
that the sun set at 5:30 o'clock on Septem
ber 27, 1895, the day "Jack" Littlefield was
lynched.
The courtroom was thronged at the after
noon session as it was rumored around
town during the noon recess that the de
fendants were to go uoon the stand. The
first witness called was John Crow. The
constable is a medium-sized man, with an
intelligent face. He was questioned by
Attorney Reid. Crow said that he went to
Haydon's house on the forenoon of Sept
ember 26. He was told John M. Vinton
had been shot and went into the house
and offered his assistance to Vinton. The
wounded man asked him to get Officer
Bayles Van Horn as he wished to see him.
On that same nieht Crow rode over to Van
Horn's place, a distance of thirteen miles,
and acquainted Van Horn with Vinton's
request.
He returued the next day with the con
stable to the Haydon place. They had din
ner there and left about 3 o'clock in the
afternoon. While there Vinton told of the
alleged meeting with Littlefield, and how
Palmer's vaquero bad shot him without
givine him a chance to defend his life.
Van Horn deputized Crow as his assistant
in arresting Littlefield. The witness told
of the arrest of Littlefield after a struggle,
and their return on their* way to Van
Horn's place. In the Red Mountain tim
ber, in the dusk of the evening, they were
met by a mob. Before noticing the "lynch
ers he saw Littlefield jump from his horse
and partly raised his gun, believing Little
field was trying to escape.
At that moment a shot was fired. Other
shots followed. He saw one man stand
ing in front of a bush close to the trail,
and six or seven men in the immediate
vicinity, while others were discernible
fnrther back. They poured in a volley of
bullets upon officers and captive. Van
Horn ordered a retreat. Crow set spurs
to his horse and rode on fast. He saw
Littlefield clutch his breast after the first
shot was fired, and partly turning his
head as he rode by saw the vaquero
stretched on his back on the ground, with
his arms extended by his side.
Crow testified that he had no intimation
or knowledge of the persons who made up
the mob or who were concerned .in the
lynching, and did not know "who did the
shooting. Before detailing the meeting
of the mob the witness swore that Little
field/on setting his watch, which had run
down, fixed the time at 5 o'clock.
Crow said his rifle was of . a 40-caliber
Winchester, and he always carried it with
him in the mountains.
â¢Deputy Attorney-General Post began
a cross-examinatiou of the witness, which
had not proceeded more that, five minutes
when one of the jurymen was seen to be
in a nearly fainting condition, caused by
a sickness from which he had been suffer
ing for two days. A short recess was
ordered, and the juror not improving a
continuance was taken until Wednesday
morning at 10 o'clock. 3 ! 3 3.3
COR ON A D HO TEL THIEVES.
Guests Robbed of J heir Valuables by a
Quartet of Heltboys.
LOb ANGELES, Cal., April 28.â The
police to-night arrested one of a gang of
four bellboys who were discharged from
the employ of the Coronado Hotel a few
days ago on suspicion of having robbed
the rooms of guests. Many articles of
value were missed by people at the famous
caravansary, but when the suspects were
searched nothing of an incriminating
nature was found upon them, and they
were dismissed.
They all left San Diego and after their
departure positive -evidence of their guilt
was discovered. The police here were no
tified to look out for them and Officers
Reynolds this evening captured one of the
quartette. Upon his person was found a
diamond pin worth $50, several rings and
a diamond stud, which were stolen from
guests. He admitted his guilt and said the
rest of the gang left for San Francisco
Monday.
DUTCH HARBOR CHANDLERS LOSE.
Judge Bellinger Decides That a Govern
ment Lien Against a Vessel Abro
gates All Others.
PORTLAND, Or., April 23.â Judge Bel
linger, in the United States District Court,
handed down a decision to-day which is of
considerable importance to ship chandlers
and suppliers and will cause them to be
careful in advancing credit to vessels about
j which there is any taint of poaching or
j probability of seizure.
During the voyage in which the schooner
j Louise Olsen was seized for illegal sealing
j the vessel put into the port of Dutch Har
| bor and purchased from the North Ameri
! can Company provisions and gear to the
! amount of '$400, the bill being charged
against the vessel, to be settled thereafter.
Before returning to port the Olsen was
seized by a revenue cutter, libeled by the
Government and sold. The North Amer
ican Company brought suit in intervenor
against the United States, claiming a lien
i against the vessel superior to that of the
j United States. The Government objected
j to the lien of j the Norta American Com
| pany, claiming that the Government's
I seizure and the libeling of the vessel abro
i gated all former liens that the schooner
i incurred. 3-3 'â  <',
i Judge Bellinger referred to the ruling
j made in the case of the Kaytian Republic,
I and while admitting that, in the reconsid
â¢ eration given the matter through . the
j Olson libel, he felt that his first' decision
j might have been not entirely proper, still
! he could not find sufficient grounds to
t warrant his changing the ruling in the
Olsen case, and therefore wouid sustain
the exceptions filed by the United States.
OVERDUE ALASKA VESSELS
Growing Anxiety for the Safety
of the Lakme and the
Utopia.
Stranded Miners at Juneau in Desper
ate Straitsâ Seal Hunters Picked
Up at S a.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 28. â The
steamships Al-Ki and Willapa arrived in
port this morning, bringing the latest
Alaska advices, but which contain not a
word of news concerning any of the Cooks
Inlet expeditions that sailed from the port
of Seattle. The Utopia is three days
overdue. Leaving Sitka on April 9, it was
expected to land passengers and freight
without the aid of lighters at the inlet,
and to make the run directly back, reach
ing this port on April 25.
Definite information concerning the
Lakme and other vessels is expected to
morrow upon the arrival of the steamer
Mexico.
Its agents say the Lakme should have
reached Sitka, for which port it cleared,
by April 10 at the latest. It was under
contract to deliver freight and passengers
at or near Six-mile Creek, 120 miles up
Cooks Inlet. The Lakme, at the time of
its departure on April o, expected to re
turn to this port by May 1 or earlier.
All Yukon-bound miners are still en
camped at Sheep Camp waiting tor the
snow to melt in order to cross the divide.
Private letters received by those at Juneau
say there is already much suffering, as
many miners are running short of provi
sions and that "if the weather does not
change pretty soon we shall have to do
something desperate."
T. C. Healey, manager of the Yukon
Transportation Company, which had
charge of the British-Yukon mail that
was lost last winter, was a passenger down
on the Al-Ki.
He says the mail has not yet been found,
but that it will probably be recovered with
the opening of spring.
Fifty- two men are under indictment and
being tried before Judge Delaney in the
Territorial Court at Juneau for selling
liquor without a license. *33*3
The Al-Ki had as passengers August
Peterson and an Indian seal hunter, who
were lost at sea from the schooner City of
San Diego, from Victoria, while off Mount
St. Elias. They were separated from the
vessel, being in a canoe, when a terrible
storm overtook them. For six da} s they
were tossed at the mercy of wind and
wave, having nothing to eat except raw
salt meat. On the morning of the seventh
day they were picked up, nearer dead than
alive, by the steamer Lacy and taken to
Juneau. ' ( i -; ,*;^
LOS ANGELES TRAGEDY.
Crazed by Cigarette Smoking,
Clark Anderson Attempts
Suicide.
A Message Sent to His Mother Is the
Means of Saving His
Life.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 28.â The
deplorable effects of cigarette smoking
were illustrated this forenoon by an at
tempt of Clark Anderson, a 19-year-old
youth, who came within an ace of com
mitingsuicide at West Lake park. Young
Anderson has been the pride and hope of
his mother, now weighed down with sor
row over the sad plight of her son, who is
apparently hopelessly demented and will
probably be sent to an asylum. Before go
ing to the lake to end his life, he left the
following note, to be handed to his
mother: â¢
Dear Mamma: I will now bid you good-by. I
am on my nay to West Lake, where you will
never see me again. Don't worry, poor mamma,
for you know that J am crazy. Tell Mabel
good-by for me, and you will find a note in my
pocket for Mabel. Your son, Clark. "
The messenger who delivered this note
to Clark's i mother, Mrs. J. Stover of 513^
South Spring street, in response to frantic
appeals reached the police station in time
to send an officer after Anderson. The offi
cer found him in a clump of bushes with"
a drawn razor, with which he was about to
cut his throat. The officer secured the
weapon and returned with the would-be
suicide, -whom he placed in the County
Jail. Anderson will be examined by the
lunacy commission to-morrow morning.

FATAL LANDSLIDE
AT FORBESTOWN
Section of a Miners' Bunk-
House Hurled Into a
River.
ONE SLEEPER DROWNED
Inmates Awaken to Find Their
Shelter Submerged in the
Stream.
ALL BUT ONE BEACH SHORE.
He Is Borne Down by the Current
and His Body Cannot Be â¢
Founl.
FORBESTOWN, Cal., April 28.â An in
significant landslide, in which not more
than sixty cubic yards of earth was de
tached, caused the death of William
Wolze during the rainstorm Sunday night,
and five companions had narrow escapes
with their lives. The body of the unfor
tunate man is at the bottom of the south
fork of the Feather River, efforts to re
cover it having been unsuccessful.
Wolze and his companions were asleep
in the bunkhouse of the Carlisle quartz
mine on the bank of the stream, about
fifty feet from the water. Without warn
ing a section of their sleeping apartments
was swept into the river and the miners
awoKe to find themselves in the water.
Five succeeded in getting out of the sub
merged building and reaching the shore,
though two were injured. Wolze was
never seen again. Whether he was car
ried down by the " treacherous current
while striving to reach the shore, or had
been knocked senseless by something mov
able when the bunks slid into the water will
never be known. The search for the
man's body was diligent, but it ended in
failure. ,V.Ji. '"â¢'
Heavy rains had turned each ditch in
this vicinity into a torrent, and one of
these streams, entering the south fork
near the bunkhouse, had eaten into the
little elevation on which the building
stood. But a small section of the struc
ture was carried down by the slide, else
the loss of life would have been very great.
As it was, not enough earth was cast
into the stream to check the torrent for
even a moment.
William Wolze, the victim of the dis
aster, was 35 years of age and a native,
of Missouri.
STANFORD NOT TO ENTER
Will Send No Team to Compete
; in the Track Events at
San Francisco.
Individual Athletes Will Sport the
Cardinal in Several of the
Contests.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cai,.,
April 28.â Stanford will enter no team in
the Saturday track meet at San Francisco.
Such was the decision arrived at by the
management last evening. This was the
original idea, but a number of athletes,
who could spare the time, were anxious to
have the whole team entered, and so for a
time the matter was left undecided. Now
it is settled. Track Manager Brown said:
"It would simply be impossible to enter
all the men next Saturday. Several of
them have given up all the time they can
afford to track athletics. We are willing
to train hard down here for three months
to get -a team in shape to beat Berkeley,
but we can't spend extra time the whole
semester keeping in condition for all
coast track events. With us college work
is the chief thing and athletics is subor
dinate to that. Our track season is practi
cally closed here with the end of the inter
collegiate contest, as the football season
is closed witn the great annual game."
When asked what chance Stanford
would have against Eastern college teams,
Captain Toombs said: "We are not think
ing of an Eastern trip. Our team is good
enough to defeat Berkeley, but we don't
believe ourselves superior to the big col
lege teams East, nor will we make a tour
for some time to test our prowess. When
Stanford does go East her team will be as
good as the best; until then we stay at
home."
The only men who will enter next Sat
urday from Stanford â and they, will enter
as individuals â are Dole '98, in the pole
vault, Wilbur '99, in the shot put, Fickert
'98, in the hammer throw, and Toombs
'96, in the sprints. The rest of the ath
letes, with the exception of Reynolds,
have gone out of training. During the
Rose Carnival at San Jose several Stan
ford men will probably enter the races.
In the baseball contest Saturday, be
tween Berkeley and Stanford, the cardinal
wearers anticipate another victory. The
game is to take place on the home diamond,
and as Pitcher McLaine has recovered
from his recent illness he is expected to
put up his . oldtime game from start to
finish. The entire team resumed practice
yesterday afternoon and will continue
training until the game comes off.

AT AN UNLAWFUL SPEED
A Market-Street Cable Company
* Is Charged With Vio'ating
the Code. .'.-
Evidence to Show That the Mission
Cars Exceed Sixteen Miles an
Hour.
The. suit for $50,000 damages filed last
Monday by Louis D. and Margarette Fri
chette, the parents of James A. Frichette,
who died from injuries received while at
tempting to board a Mission car on the
evening of September 24, 1894, excites con
siderable interest by reason of the peculiar
wording of the complaint.
The point is made that cars are run at a
speed greatly in excess of that fixed by the
statutes, and that athletic young men are
expected to give evidence of their agility
by jumping on or off, as occasion might
demand. '>"*"-'
In this particular case the complainants
set forth the fact that "James A. Frichelte
was 21 years of age and an athlete, and
was accustomed to comply with the invi
tation and such requirements of the corpo
ration to get on and off the defendant's
cars while in motion and in perfect safety,
and could have done so in perfect safety in
the present instance if tbe corporation had
complied with the law and had not ex
ceeded the customary and lawful rate of
speed in running its cars."
In addition to this the complaint says:'
On September 25, 1894, the defendant was a
street-railway corporation running a line of
cars propelled by electric power on Mission
street, from Twenty-ninth street to the ferry,
and was limited by section .501 of the Civil
Code of California to a speed of not exceeding
eight miles an hour. The rules and time table
of the defendant required its conductors and
motormen having charge of the running of its
cars to make the run between Twenty-ninth
street and the ferry, a distance of four and a
half miles, in thirty-fiyc minutes; and in order
to accomplish that distance In that time It
was the custom of the defendant to invite and
require young and athletic male passengers to
get on and off its cars while in motion.
The new point Of law made by the com
plainants is certainly novel if nothing
more. Patrons of electric lines know that
it is the custom of niotormen to rattle
down to a crossing at a lively rate. If a
woman or an old man is to get on or off .
the car stops; otherwise the speed is only
slightly diminished.
The distance from the ferries to Twenty
ninth and Mission streets is a fraction
over four and a half miles. g Yesterday a
Call representative made; the round trip,
starting from the ferries. Including the
wait for the incoming car the time con
sumed was exactly seventy-two minutes.
On tho outward journey eleven "dead",
stops were made, and in addition to this
there was a slight letting up sin the speed
as the car approached the -various cross
ings. On the return trip thirteen stops
were made. In order to have accomplished
the round-trip in the time named, to
gether _ with the twenty-four stops and
"Blow downs,'* the actual speed could not
have been short of sixteen miles an hour.
i Â«' ous crossings passengers i got "on
and off the car while it was still in motion.
James H. Frichette; on account of whose
death the suit is brought, was a popular
young man in the Mission, and a promi
nent member of the Native : Sons of the
kÂ° .Â»S n^nf _ 0n the evening of Septem
ber _.-_, 18D4, he was returning home, and
attempted to board the car while it was in
motion. He missed his footing, and was
thrown unuer the car, sustaining injuries
which resulted in his death on October 3

SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 28.â Santa
Rosa began to put on her carnival dress
to-day, the warm, pleasant weather inject
ing the carnival spirit into even the
silurlan and the calamity howler. Early
this morning the framework of a half
dozen huge arches spanned tho principal
streets, and as if by magic put on a garb
of green, which will serve for a back
ground for the gay flowers and bright
bunting that are to follow. During the
forenoon a crew of men was busy on the
dome of the Courthouse, which is now
resplendent in â¢ red, green and yellow,
while the statue of Minerva from her
dizzy height of 200 feet waves Old Glory
in her right hand, and, like the rest of her
sex in Santa Rosa, is happy in the pos
session of a new dress of bright colors.
The Santa Rosa Bank was the first busi
ness house to decorate this year, a huge
fan of the prevailing colors ornamenting
the front entrance, with the rest of the
building garbed to match. The Grand
Hotel will be covered with moss and ferns,
with flowers and carnival bunting inter
mingled, and it already presents a holiday
front.
One of the handsomest and most unique
features of the decorations will be that of
the merchants doing business in the
Hahman block. They will erect an arbor
eighty feet long and twenty feet wide over
the sidewalk in front of their shops and
stores, which will be covered with redwood
boughs, mosses and ferns. The inside
will be a mass of red and white roses,
lighted by dozens of incandescent lights.
A force of thirty decorators, under the
direction of Dr. E. G. Griffith, has been at
work on the Athenreum for two days, pre
paring the big theater for the coronation
exercises. The interior of the building
will be beautiful beyond the powers of de
scription, as myriads of the choicest flow
ers from the fairest gardens have been do
nated for use in its decoration.
The local militia company is making
great preparations for entertaining the
visiting military. companies that will take
part in the parade. The directors of the
carnival have made a liberal appropria
tion toward paying the expense of a spread
for the boys in blue to make war upon.
Company Eof Santa Rosa can be relied
upon to handsomely entertain its guests.
Profiting largely by the experience of
the past two years, the directors have this
year made commendable preparations for
the reception of strangers. Tiers of seats
are being constructed on Fourth street,
just above the theater, which will be re
served for visitors only. All of the avail
able rooms in town have been listed by
the committee, and good quarters at
reasonable rates can be secured by address
ing Chairman T. A.. Proctor of the rooms
committee. Eating-houses will be located
in every available building, and those con
templating a visit to the rose carnival can
be assured of a reserved seat from which
the magnificent parade can be witnessed,
a "square" meal at a reasonable price
when hungry, and, when fatigued by the
continual round of pleasure of the day and
night, a comfortable bed to sleep in.
SAN JOSE DECORATIONS.
Tons of Flowers and Evergreens Used on
the Electric Tower.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 28.â work
of decorating the electric tower for the
Carnival of Roses began this morning.
Over 1500 yards of van-colored bunting
and tons and tons of evergreens will be
used and when completed it will present '
a grand and magnificent view. The im
mense structure, over 200 feet in height,
will be entirely covered by evergreens and
bunting. The ironwork will be entwined
with foliage, with carnival flags every few
feet. - From the first crossbars of the tower
streamers of red, white and blue bunting
will be festooned to the top landing. The
cap over the lights will be covered by
evergreens and a largo carnival flag will
â¢ float from the pole surmounting the
tower. In the center of the structure,
about twenty-five feet from the ground, an
immense "horn, of plenty" will.be sus
pended.
Work :on the arches is being rushed.

WOODLAND, Cal., April 28.â Not long
ago there was more or less talk about the
quality of the Woodland water. There
were sensational rumors afloat, to the ef
fect that th ere were holes in the pipes and
that in consequence surface water was be
ing distributed. With a view of ascertain
ing the facts, Superintendent Masters for
warded a sample to Professor E. W. Hil
gard of Berkeley University for analysis
and in reply received a report of the
analysis. Commenting on the result, the
professor said :
"The water contains a large amount of
mineral matter. This is not of such a char
acter as to affect at all its value for domes
tic use. It is remarkably free from all or
ganic contamination. As for the saline
ingredients, they are not such as to be
likely to interfere with any one's digestion ;
they are peculiar to the formation from
which the water is derived and nowise
point to any contamination."
MURPHYS GOLD STRIKE
Rich Returns From the Recent
Find on the Ponte
. Ranch.
Years Ago a Copper Company Had
Refused to Work the
Claim.
MURPHYS, Cal., April 28.â ex
citement caused by the rich gold strike at
Ponte's ranch a few days ago has not
abated. A man who was on the ground
yesterday says he saw more gold than he
ever saw before in its virgin state. He was
shown several tomato cans full of glitter
ing specimens. 3;3
Years ago a copper claim was worked
just a few yards from the present find and*
in making excavations at that time a large
bowlder containing much free gold was
found. The copper company was notified,
but returned the peculiar reply that it was
not hunting for gold, but intended to pay
careful attention to its copper possessions.
The lode now attracting attention runs
from east to west. It is about six feet in
width and is on a straight line with the
old Gambling mine, which . years ago
yielded a succession of pockets netting its
owner over $30,000. The Gambling mine is
at present beine worked by William Har
per of Murphy's Grade, who on Monday
last came to a chute in. his tunnel that
promises to open another large pocket. '
Rail Fatality at Reno.
RENO, Nev., April 28.â William Biggs,

the car ran upon him, cutting him almost

ONE FRAUD WAS SUCCESSFUL.
_____ .
Decision, a Heavily Played Favorite
on Friday, Was Beaten Through
: . This Sort of Treatment.
Perhaps for boldness and daring a
dirtier job was never attempted on a Cali
fornia race course than the one that was
tried at the Bay District track yesterday,
and which in its results was a failure.
Marjorie. a plunger on favorite, was to
have been "stopped" and the race-going
public robbed of thousands of dollars.
The filly, a daughter of the grand race
horse Iroquois, was a good performer in
the West previous to. being brought to
California by her present owner. Frank
Phillips, a well-known bookmaker and
turfman. On Tuesday of last week the
filly won a five and a half furlong dash in
spread-eagle fashion.
Opposed to a moderate field yesterday
she looked a "moral," and the jobbers saw
their opportunity. The event in which
Bhe was a starter was the last on the card.
'In the opening betting one or two of the
books laid 7 to 5 against the speedy
daughter of Iroquois, but from the flood of
coin that poured in upon them' quickly
rubbed to 6 to 5, the prevailing market
price.
In grand condition in the morning, Mr.
Phillips' trainer was surprised to see the
lavorite warm up greatly distressed. The
officials in the stand were immediately
apprised of her condition, and, after some
deliberation, all bets were declared off,
and Marjorie was scratched. A veterinary
surgeon was called into requisition, and,
after an examination, it was thought she
had been "doped." The pupils of the eyes
were distended; the membrane of the nos
trils showed signs of irritation, and the
filly acted cranky.
A slight abrasion in one of the nostrils
looked as though it might have been made
by the puncture of a hypodermic syringe.
Thus the matter stood as the crowd left
the track. -
Not satisfied, Owner Phillips again had
Dr. Roweil make a more thorough exami
nation of the fast sprinter when the crowd
had departed for home, and with startling
results. â¢- v"el ; >-'3;>"3-- â¢â  ?â -*- 1.7. -7- â â â¢â /â â 
Noticing a watery condition of one of the
eyes the veterinary inserted a probe in the
nostril and was rewarded by withdrawing
a fine silken sponge that had been skill
fully inserted therein, and which was the
cause of the filly's heavy breathing and
attendant discomfort The cat was now
out of the bass. . v; 3* >
The curiosity of the veterinary was now
aroused. On Friday of last week the de
cidedly warm favorite Decision, in a seven
furlong run decided over the inner course,
flattered her backers by showing some of
her accustomed speed the first part of the
journey and then winding up at the tail
end of the processior, a disgusting last.
The filly seemed to be afflicted with symp
toms similar to those of Marjorie, and up
to yesterday was still "under the weather."
Both racers stabled in the same row,
down in the hollow. Decisic it was brought
out, and continuing his researches, Dr.
Rowell, after much trouble, removed a
sponge much saturated with mucous from
the nostril of the distressed animal, who
gave vent to a sign of relief at its extrac
tion.
Now those sponges were not placed there
for fun. It was not the trick of frolicsome
boys. The vile acts were instigated by

some member or members of the book
making fraternity.
The linger of gossip, points at one or
two, but that is only Haphazard guessing.
Mr. Phillips stated to a fellow-turfman â â 
that he thought he could place his linger
on the guilty one. For the benefit of the
turf it is hoped that he will. During the
betting on the Decision race Ed Purser,
the well-known plunger, backed the ani
mal, but thought one or two members of
the ring overzealous in laying against the
mare, and mounting a prominent book
maker's stand finally laid odds against the
mare himself. He was not an "angel" on
the turf and was wise. .
Marjorie was brought over from Ingle
side track yesterday morning. â¢ Mr. Phil
lips says he is confident the colored boy
who had charge of the racer had no hand
in the job and it seems as though the per
petrator of the outrage might be appre
hended. ..77y
Let the stewards call for the sheets. No
matter how large the bank rolls, very few
members of the bookmaking fraternity
now doing business at the track are taking
any big chances. Do not rule off a poor
stable boy, who, tempted by the promise
of a new suit of clothes, does wrong.
Pull down off the block some of the
suave, polished magnates of all that is
dark in racing, who sit up late at nights
thinking out plots to deceive the public
and yearly grow fat in purse. The turf
should play no favorites. The officials of
the Bay District track have a â let
them act. The laundry work on a cuff
once led to the detection of a noted stage
robber. â¢â . *;
Outside of this one occurrence the rac- (
ing was uneventful. Favorites took but
three of the races on the. programme and
the bookmakers have the best of the argu
ment. 7777* â â ': ' "'",','."".
In the betting on the opening six-fur
long run the' Burns & Waterhouse en
try, Montgomery, was made a 6 to 5
chance, but in a drive the last furlong was
beaten out by the 5 to 1 shot Governor
Bndd, ridden by Piggott. 3 ; f . v
The four-lurlong dash for two-year-olds
was captured very handily by Fig Leaf,
I who went to the post at 9 to 5, equal
favorite with Greyhuast. The latter young
ster was slow to get in motion and coming
from the rear was beaten but a neck for
the place by Viking, a 25 to 1 shot.
The mile and a sixteenth run, decided
underselling conditions, was easily gath
ered in by the 9 to 10 favorite Palomacita,
who took tbe lead before the stretch was
reached and passed the wire the handiest
of winners over Uncle Giles in 1:50"*-''.
Little Cripple, the second choice, was 1
third, '
According to the betting on the six-fur- j
I long purse event that followed, the issue ;
| seemed to lie between Mt. McGregor II
and Bellicoso, both going to the post at 9
to 5, The two first-choices in the betting
killed themselves off by racing off in the
lead at a great clip, and Pryce on the sec
ond choice, Ferrier, overtaking Mt. Mc-
Gregor in the stretch, beat him out hand
ily by three-parts of a length, in the fast
time of 1:14*4. Beilicoso ended up a poor
third. 777777 â â 3"3---3-3-
After having the mile and a quarter
hurdle event won with Bellringer. a 4 to 1
chance in the betting "yesterday," Willie
Spence grew gay and was naobed and
beaten out the last forty yards by George
Cochran astride the 'i to 5 favorite, Mon
talvo. Arundel, with Hennessy, up was a
good third. 3 ,
With Marjorie scratched out of the last
race, the result was much more of a prob
lem. Rebellion went out a 9 to 5 choice
but could do no better than finish third.
By a clever ride, Snider got the 15 to 1 shot

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29, 1896.
MARTIN AND JERRY
ARE DESPERATE.
They See That Their Farci
cal Game of Fraud
Is Lost.
Â ...
WANT LONGER GRASS.
The Kelly-Mahoney Fraud Shows
What It Is Made Of
Inside.
THEIR ONE PROSPECT FADES.
Republicans of the State Hold Their
Noses as the Kelly-Mahoney
Contest Nears.
Martin Kelly and Jerry. Mahoney have
grown desperate within the last day or two,
since they have seen fade away the possi
bility of their getting their fake delegation
from the Fourth District on the temporary
roll of the Republican State Convention. \
The fortunes of the State Convention do
not worry Kelly and Mahoney at all.
They would seek to make the State Con
vention but a stepping-stone to the sewers
of municipal politics. This may seem a
remarkable metaphor, but it is a legiti
mate one, politically considered.
From the time that Kelly came from a
part of the world that , no man but Chief
of Detectives Lees knows, and started a
junkshop where the thieving water rats
sold their old brass, and then mounted
into south-of- Market Democratic politics,
where he remained a short time . until
Chris Buckley kicked him out of the busi
ness, his interest in politics has wholly
concerned .its commercial . features, and
his ways in politics have always been
through the lowest depths of vileness
which the rotten places in City politics
could provide. ]! 33. 3 :-;â â 
Kelly has always" looked for something
political to sell, to trade, to tax or to steal.
He has, by the arts of , a small political
boss whose power was wielded in Tar
Flat, ever got as close as* possible to 'the
patronage offices of this City, and while
there has done but one good â pro
vide decent people with further good rea
sons for municipal reform.
_ Through a long succession of years Mar
tin Kelly's name has been connected with
the stealing of lumber from the School
Department ; with petty salary and other
thefts from the Street Department; with
a succession of Grand Jury indictments,
which were dodged by technicalities, and

with stories about his corrupt doings in
the Fire Department.^ Â.- . . ,â¢
Then as Martin 0 Kelly rose higher as a
boss came bigger stories about corporation
sacks that had something to do, with Su
pervisors and about all the mass of things
that a corrupt political boss will '. get : him-!
self tarred with. â¢ â¢' â â¢
Kelly's last political; play was to beat
the Republican i candidate -;â¢ for Governor,
partly in behalf of the railroad, it is cur
rently said, and parti v because Dan Burns
didn't give him a sufficiently; large show
at the taxable things of politics. -.*-
If the depths of municipal corruption'
have ever brought forth a ward rounder
that has developed into a boss who knows
no . party and knows * no. principle higher
than that which swells vulture's heart,
it is well known to the people of San Fran
cisco that Martin Kelly is the one. ..
Martin Kelly is now. financially and po
litically "busted," as he is morally. His
last saloon has passed to other hands, his
"push" has dwindled to a small coterie of
water-front characters, past fortunes which
made him partner in a saloon on Third
street, have given ! him such high ideas
that he 'doesn't want" to go into, the junk
business again, and then he is a victim of
that fascination by which practical poli
tics enslaves forever so many victims.
: When .: the present political campaign
opened Kelly found himself out in the
cold. It was natural that with nothing to
lose and all to gain he should make a
desperate play for a foothold in local poli
tics where lie might again flourish in some
degree as a political debauchee.
Thus it is that this Martin Kelly is at
the head of an alleged "Republican"
movement in the Fourth District.
Its success would give him a prestige by
which he might work things so that he
could nominate somebody and . get the
"recognition" which to one like him would
mean that he could dictate some appoint
ments, draw down percentages on some
salaries, and otherwise pursue the business
of a small boss again.
â¢ It was, the most natural thing in the
world that Kelly should form a partner
ship j with Jerry Mahoney. Mahoney is
rather in the cold, too, since Dan Burns
went to his mines. .
That Mahoney's political record 'is as
infamous as that of Martin Kelly is known
to most people of California. Mahoney's
political record began about the time that
his old political partner, Sam Rainey,
gave him a small job at the House of Cor
rection ten or twelve years ago, and it is
just now coterminous by coincidence with
the political career of Louis Sternberg.who
has gone to San Quentin for steering
illegal registration iv Senator Mahoney's
district. -33:*;33333:V"3:. \
The sweetness and light of J. H. Ma
honey's political record would illumine a
long story. 33; 7y 7-M
That Kelly and Mahoney were the sole
authors of the contesting movement in the
Fourth District is as well known as the ex
istence of the movement. -~-\ r
That they have controlled and manipu
lated it throughout is well known to all
who know the inside of the affairs of the
Kelly-Maboney contest.
An exposition in detail of the small
collection of political workers who are
supporting Kelly and Mahoney would
show that nine-tenths of them" are old
political associates of Kelly or Mahoney,
bound to them by special ties, and that
the other tenth, is principally composed
of chronic kickers ' who have always
been found trying to force more recogni
tion than the party was willing to give
them; a few people new to politics, friends
of Kelly and Mahoney, who have thought
they saw a way to fame by holding Mar
tin Kelly's hat while he tries to break in
by a back window.. There are some gentle
men who have been misled by these two
fakers in politics.
The Kelly-Mahoney contest rests on two
forged proxies. The contesting delega
tion is going to . Sacramento representing
in fact but Kelly and Mahoney, and each
member of the delegation .who- loyally
stands g up at : the 3 backs ?of jjj Kelly .. and
Mahoney must give as his warrant 7300
fraudulent votes with which the returns
of the farcical Kellv-Mahoney primary
were stuffed.' -
Three hundred of Kellv and Mahoney's
"push" and 37300 stuffed ballots are the
authorization which the Republicans of
San Francisco have given the Kelly-Ma
honey delegation to stand forth and pre
tend to represent them at the State Con-,
vention. .-.. -. â â ',-,- ',. , ,;.,
But with a contest born in fraud and
trickery and with a delegation that repre
sents the 7300 'â¢ *** tallies fraudulently and
laboriously marked, against the name of
each delegate, Kelly and Mahoney are go
ing to Sacramento with a brass band and
wiil make the best play of , which they are
capable, hoping to get the recognition they'
seek. *'â¢*'â  7^777,7.- 777':
The prospect that the State Convention
will : turn down ; the entire Republican
party of the Fourth District, represented
by a delegation nominated ;by.the people
and honestly, elected at an open and fair
primary.under the auspices of the regular
party organization, is so impossible that
Kelly and Mahoney are losing heart.
Up to a day. or two ago *<* Kelly and
Mahoney banked everything on getting a
friendly assistant secretary, to put their
delegation on the temporary roll. Within
the past day or two this prospect has dis
appeared.
While Kelly and Mahoney were talking
noisily about their advantages in praying
this trick the local party looked on with
silent amusement or unconcern. Now
that the convention has drawn near and
the fact has clearly appeared that the
regular delegation, which represents the
party, will not have to step aside at the
door for Martin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney,
these freebooters have grown desperate.
In their desperation, Kelly and Ma
honey, through two, or three of their
allies, who are .so thoughtless that they
are not ashamed to stand , beside them,
yesterday sent ' to The Call a scurrilous
letter, in which they brazenly talk of
their representing "the party,"* claiming
with humorous effrontery that their dele
gation was elected by "7000 votes," and
even asserting that opposition to Kelly
and Mahoney was doing "great damage to
the Republican party."
The rump Kelly-Mahoney contest has
now but its false pretensions and its brass
band, which will drain its resources. .
As most ills bring something in the way
of compensation the Kelly-Mahoney sore
in the Fourth District will leave the party
in a more healthy condition by getting
Kelly and Mahoney out of its blood. : -
â¢ The executive committee of the State
Central Committee will meet this evening
to transact business of importance, and at
11 a. m. to-day the Fifth District Congres
sional Committee will meet at the office of
John E. Richards in the Crocker building
to finally pass upon the returns from that
district. â  y::'-777y;-
THE HOWARD CLUB.
Denounces Kelly and Mahoney and
Votes for an Unpledged
Delegation.
At a meeting of. the Howard Club last
evening at Pythian Hall . Judge A. B.
Tread well denounced Kelly and Mahoney
as the most "corrupt and scheming myr
mydons" of the metropolis. He said:
"It was only two years ago that I
worked for this â¢ man Mahoney for State
Senator, and I never did anything in my
life for which lam half so ashamed. .* 3n
"This Mahoney, together with his ras
cally colleague, has tried harder to place
the Republican party of San Francisco on
the pedestal of scorn and vituperation
than any other man in this City. %
'â¢These two consummate boodlers have
not a following of twenty-five good and
honest citizens in their district, and these
few are imposed upon. We will show these
men when the proper time comes that the
people by the Golden Gate are not to be
trifled with.? â¢
It was resolved by unanimous vote that
the action of Supervisor Joe King in
voting with the Democratic members of
the board to give the plans of ; tlie new
municipal building to : Shea & , Shea in
stead of W. O. -Banks, whose plans are
deemed better and whose figures are lower,
should be condemned. It was, believed
that, other things being equal, he should
affiliate with the members of his own
party. - .
The speakers of the evening were Wil
liam E. Bates, Fred Krey and George A.
Wentworth. Their speeches were devoted
to a consideration of the general issues be
fore the Republican party in the coming
campaign. To a man they *. were in favor
of unpledged delegations.
"I believe,',' said Bates, "that it is for the
best interests of the Republican party to
send an unpledged delegation to St. Louis,
and it is the duty of the members of this
club to use every means that lie in their
power to further this desirable end."
Said Frey: "There is not a doubt that
the sentiment of the party is for an un

A STRIKE ON THE OREGON
Union Painters Ordered Off
the Big Battle-Ship
Yesterday.
Early yesterday morning, the union
painters at work at Hunter's dry-dock
scraping and painting the battle-ship Ore
gon were called out on a strike by Busi
ness Agent Mclvor of the Building Trades
Council. The reason was that the paint
ing contractor, a man named Thomas of
20 Jessie street, is working the force nine
hours when the Federal law states that
eight hours shall constitute a day's work.
The strike was ordered by the Painters'
Union. ' ' '
.In deciding upon this course it was not
with any expectation of . tieing up the job.
In the first place the union painters were
sadly in the minority in the gang and sec
ond, their places; could be easily filled by
roustabouts and common; laborers. The
purpose was to " have " the eight- hour Fed
eral law ' tested. " The painters and other
union men claim that, this law is being
continually violated, particularly by the
proprietors of â  the Union -, Iron Works,
wheie the men: in' all departments are
obliged to labor nine â¢ hours .* and twenty
minutes.
This strike is a slap at the Union Iron
Works as much as at Contractor Thomas,
who is said to perform all of this foundry's
ship-painting. '33
;"<A few days "ago Foreman Murphy of
Thomas' 3 shop* asked the union Ito â  send
him a number of men to work nine hours
on the Oregon. .[He offered *. to pay time
and a halt for the overtime, but: the union
refused to furnish the men for several rea
sons. It was suggested that Thomas put
more men to work and work 3 them all
eight hours, but this he refused . to do, â as
he is running a nine-hour shop and it was
evident that he had no intention of con-
forming to union rules. , i- "-'" I.
" When the tug .started from the foot of
Mission street, with ten pain ters on board,
Mclvor ordered the union men ashore and
all responded, while the others went to the
drydock. 3; Mclvor ; at once went to Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald, who i promised
to do all in his " power as an official and a
citizen {to ; have: the \ eight-hour J law en
forced. Â§ Deputy Greene was dispatched to
see United States Â« District Attorney H. S.
Foote, with a view ** of interesting him in
maintaining the eight-hour law. Later in
the 'i day Mclvor, - Fitzgerald and â¢ Deputy
Dam held Â£ another conference. Deputy
Greece returned during the interview with
the report that United States District At
torney Foote seemed : to consider that the
Labor Commissioner as a State officer was
going outside of his duties in taking up a
matter that properly belongs to the Fed
eral courts, and that if he does intend to
interest himself in the Oregon matter, he
(Foote) would like to see Mr. Fitzgerald
personally. â *.-.â  :'â â â .'"-â . 3 â  {
He stated in addition that he would like
to see Business Agent Mclvor. The Labor
Commissioner evidently considers -that
Mclvor will receive but "little satisfaction
from the United States Attorney, and. his
conclusions are . based upon the position
taken by Mr. Foota upon a similar case at
the Presidio investigated several months
ago. In the correspondence on that occa
sion Mr. Foote sent a letter to the Labor
Commissioner, in which occurs the ex
pression. .'.-â â .''â .â -â â -.â¢.â  7;- :i .:....\
Section 3738, U. S. R. S., provides that eight
hours shall constitute a day'Â» work, but there
is nothing in this section which prohibits an
employer from requiring the laborers under
him to work more than eight hours a day, pro
vided he pays them for the extra time.
â  The letter goes on to say that the sec
tion refers more to compensation than to
a prohibitory limit as to time and that in
cases of emergency longer 'hours may be
required of the laborers, and the extra
time paid for. .*...*..,,. ...
Mclvor will to-day call upon Mr. Foote
to see what can be done in the case. It
has been suggested that the payee's be en
ijoined from paying for work not done ac
cording to the provisions of the Federal
law, as set forth in all Government con
tracts. . In the event of Mr. Foote not de
ciding to take hold of the case and prose
cute * the offenders, the matter will be
placed ; in the hands of ; the Building
Trades Council, and by that body placed
before the : United States Grand Jury
where it will at least have a hearing.

cheerful, healthful face of William My-

for a few moments and told me what he
thought of the great California herb
remedy, JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSA-

suffering from a liver trouble, then pains
in his back, how he kept awake at night
scratching, scratching always scratching;
how he toot, a medicine with iodide of
potash ; how the scratching became worse ;
then he used the California herb remedy,
JOY'S VEGETABLE SARSAPARILLA.
He mended from the first week. He pot
better and better; was now well. He said;
"I am glad I.insisted upon, getting . JOY'S

TO ALL/ REPUBLICANS.
Thk Call has received a communication
signed by the chairman and secretary of
the Mahoney and Kelly combination in the
Fourth District, charging that gross frauds
were committed at the regular primaries
held in that district, and claiming that
the Kelly-Mahoney - delegation is right
fully entitled to seats in the State Conven
tion.
A copy of the communication was un
doubtedly sent to the other papers of the
City. The object of the authors is plain.
The State Executive Committee meets to
day and the Kelly-Mahoney combination
seeing its chances are desperate has re-
sorted to the publication of these charges in
the hope that they will have some effect
upon the committee and be instrumental
to some extent in determining its action.
Thk Call is not in the least surprised by
the attack nor by the form in which it
comes. When we undertook to maintain
the >â¢ cause .of pure politics and honest
primaries in this City we were well aware
that we would have to fight all those
whose interests lay in corruption and
fraud. We knew also beforehand whaf
that fight meant. That all forms of abuse,
misrepresentation and deliberate â¢ lying
would be resorted to by the gangs, was
foreseen. In the interest of reputable
politics and of the great mass of Repub
lican voters we were willing to face that
fight. We meet it now without hesitation
and it shall be conducted to a finish.
The charges made by the tools of Kelly
and Mahoney' will be investigated 'by the
executive committee at its meeting to-day,
but the investigation will not stop with
those charges. ; It will include all the pro
ceedings of the gang from the time Kelly
and Mahoney held their midnight meet
ing, and, by forged proxies, attempted to
get control of the party machinery, down
to the time when they held their farce
primaries and selected a bogus delegation
to the State Convention. The results of
that investigation will be made public, and
the people can then judge for themselves
what action loyal Republicans should take
in the matter. ,
In conclusion, we have but one thing to
say. We have never made charges against
the men who compose the so-called Kelly-
Mahoney delegation. We have admitted
that many of them are honest men who
have been deluded into a false position.
We repeat as much now. We desire the
harmony of all good Republicans in the
general interests of the party and have no
fight against any man who is honest. Our
fight is against corruption and against all
who practice it.
THE MINORITY REPORT.
j Except Senator Morgan's resolution of
I instruction, which has hot yet been con
sidered, the first direct attack upon the
railroad funding proposition has been
made in the form of a minority report
presented by Representative Hubbard of
the House Committee on Pacific Roads.
The fight is now formally opened. Hub
bard's essential points are that the fund
ing bill presented by the majority of the
committee offers more than the rail
roads, asked for; that in the .hear
ing the railroad side was more fully
represented than the Government's; that
i the bill would strengthen and J J cx
l tend the monopoly ; already existing,
and that it runs contrary to the pro
visions of the California constitution limit
ing the life of corporations to fifty years.
In place of the bill the report recommends
the passage of the Morgan-Brice bill,
which provides that the hen shall be
placed for collection by foreclosure in the
hands of the Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia.
An incidental suggestion in the report
is that; a commission be appointed to
ascertain the exact status of the debtor
companies and report to the next Con
gress. It intimates that the provision in'
the Morgan-Brice bill for the separate sale
of the roads under foreclosure is hardly
advisable in view of the fact that if sold as
one they would be far more valuable as
properties and more tempting to bidders,
especially when we take into account the
assertion of one of the Government di
rectors of the Union Pacific that abundant
capital stands ready to bid on the Union
and Central Pacific as a whole in order to
secure a continuous line from the Missouri
River to the Pacific Ocean. ***'
The issues for and against funding are
now clearly defined as a simple business
proposition. As yet certain ethical ques
tions, involving the condonement of a
policy pursued many years for the pur
pose of defrauding the Government and
evading the discharge of just obligations,
have not entered into the matter, nor has
the question of the general welfare affected
by the perpetuation of a gigantic trans
portation monopoly which rules the des
tinies of millions of people been consid
ered. As a matter of fact, these are of far
greater importance than any question of
the settlement of a delayed debt, for they
lie at the very root of National integrity
and the rights and interests of the people.
These questions will likely be raised in
the discussions that must occur over the
conflicting measures now before Congress.
There are certain 1 indications that the
pendency of a Presidential election has
induced a sense of caution that was not
observable at the beginning of the strug
gle. It is very likely that Representative
Hubbard's suggestion for the appointment
of a commission to report to the next
Congress is a slyly made opening through
which the advocates of funding are in
vited to escape. The issue will be riper
for the next Congress than for the present.
The opponents of funding will miss a great
opportunity, however, if they fail to pre
sent their views in general session, where
they will be a. part of the record and can
not be mislaid, stolen or forgotten.
SANTA EOSA'S â  CARNIVAL.
The next of the flower festivals held in
California this year will be the one at
Santa Rosa, which opens to-morrow and

ago as the result of differences of opinion
concerning : certain public , affairs. It is
gratifying to learn not only that these
disagreements have been forgotten in a
united desire to make this festival an ex
ceptionally brilliant affair, but â¢ also that
the effort will produce a lasting effect in
solidifying popular . endeavor to j advance
the best interests of the city. This spirit
of cordial co-operation has gone so far as
to cause groups of merchants occupying
adjoining houses to employ their buildings
collectively in the development of a single
decorative design on an imposing scale.
The idea, so far as we are informed^ is
entirely new and will undoubtedly be
productive of splendid results. The im
portant consideration, apart from the
large decorative effects to be secured by
this plan instead of a bewildering kaleido
scope of individual and inharmotiious
house decorations, is that festivals of this
kind bring the people into close relations
of sympathy and t purpose and enable
them all the more effectively to work
intelligently for the good of the com
munity.
; Santa Rosa is specially fortunate in sev
eral ways. Its situation on the floor of a
smiling valley, backed on either side by
handsome mountains, gives a rare oppor
tunity for panoramic effects, and these su
perior natural conditions are made perfect
by a climate which in itself is a perpetual
luxury. Â But of a value equally great is
the superior quality of its settlement.
Where to perfect natural conditions are
added social attractions of the highest
order we find everything good that life can
offer. :_
NEEDLESSLY ALARMED.
The leaders of the Democratic party are
apprehensive that there will be a split on
the silver, question at the Chicago conven
tion , which ' may jeopardize . the party's
chances to remain. in power, but -they can
rest their souls in peace. 3lt matters not
whether there is a split or not, the people
decided long ago that they had quite
enough of Democratic rule. ; The country
has had a good deal of very expensive
experience , with Democratic ways and
methods since 1593, and the people are not
at all disposed to longer dwell upon the
edge of bankruptcy as they have been
dwelling since Cleveland's panic was sent
over the country to devastate and devour.
The people will not forget that the
administration now running . things at
Washington has already saddled them
with an additional interest-bearing debt of
considerable over $200,000,000 and that it
has succeeded in piling up a current
expense shortage of an amount equal to
about one-third of the sum of the new
bond debt. A total deficit of nearly $300,
--000,000 in three years, which is a debt that
the people have to pay, is not well calcu
lated to commend the Democratic party to
the country. In fact the people have lost
all faith in the honesty, integrity and
business sense of the leaders of the party,
and no one is heaping condemnation upon
them more than the intelligent rank and
file Democrat.
But enormous as is the sum total of the
bond issue and expense account deficit it
is a very small matter in comparison to
the losses to the people by the operation
of the Wilson tariff law and other at
tempts of the leaders of the Democratic
party to establish their economic and
financial theories as the basis for National
legislation. The importation of foreign
manufactures has been enormous since the
new tariff took effect, but it has been,
mainly at the expense of our own manu
facturing enterprises and their employes.'
How much this amounts to in dollars -no
one knows, nor coula one know, for when
hundreds of thousands of working men
and women are thrown into . enforced idle
ness for more than two years and thus de
prived of opportunity to earn wages, in
order to compute the losses one must con
sider the farmer, the storekeeper and the
other producers and dealers who have been
deprived of the trade of these armies of
working people because they have had no
work, hence no money to spend.
There is scarcely an industry that has
not suffered seriously in the last two and
a half years because of Democratic efforts
to fasten free trade and gold monometal
lism upon the country. Of course, Atlan
tic Coast commission importers and Wall
stre-ftt dealers in foreign bills of exchange

"THE WEEKLY CALL."
The Call is in all its departments rep
resentative of the West. It believes in up
holding the West and its industries. It
labors for the West in the broadest sense
of the word and knows no sectional lines.
In addition to the telegraphic news of
the world in a condensed form, the Weekly
contains full reports of the mining in
dustry and gives to agricultural and horti
cultural interests extended space and care
ful consideration. 3 .3 3v
The Weekly Call of to-day is not only
a paper for the miner and the farmer, but
covers so thoroughly a field so wide that it
proves interesting to all classes of readers.
THE GOOD SHIP BERMUDA.
The steamer Bermuda might as well ad
vertise herself as a regular liner for the
transportation of troops and war material
from the United States to Cuba. Yester
day she left Jacksonville, Fla., loaded
down with men and , arms * for Pinar del
Rio, and if her usual good luck attends
her she will have landed her cargo and re
turned for another load by next Saturday.
The daring of this craft is drawing all eyes
to her. She makes trip after trip with ap
parently as much ease and comfort as any
of the trans-Atlantic liners. '"
3 The point and interesting fact about
the Bermuda's 3 business is the per
fect ease â  with which she delivers cargo
after cargo to the insurgents. General
Weyler has plenty of . Spanish warships of
various styles and shapes in Cuban waters,
and he says himself that he has driven the
insurgent * armies into the â ' mountains,
nevertheless the rebels have little if any
more difficulty in \ finding a landing arid
unloading place for the - Bermuda than if
she sailed into the harbor of Havana and
, Weyler, himself " helped ito discbarge her
cargo into Maceo' s ordnance wagons.
It would seem that Weyler is as power
less to prevent the landing of arms and re
enforcements for the insurgent armies as
he is to prevent the rebels marching up
and down th e *, island at , will. In ; other \
words, Spain has utterly failed thus far to
even weaken the lines of the insurgents at
a single point, and not only so, ; : but
Weyler,' as \ was â¢; Campos, has 3 been â¢out
generaled in -every effort to hedge in the
whole or any part of the rebel forces. -If
this sort of thing is kept up much longer
the question of " the j belligerency of the
Cubans will resolve "; itself into a question
of the breadth, length arid depth of Cleve
land's blindness to the inevitable. Aside
from right and . justice the commercial j
necessity of Recognizing the belligerency
of .Cuba is pressing. % The nation â  that is
first to do that is sure to obtain great and
valuable trad % advantages with- the new
republic. But Cleveland appears to be
wholly incapable of appreciating the situ
ation and foreseeing the benefit that would
accrue to this country by. openly and
frankly telling the Cubans that the
United States is their friend in fact as well
as in name. Meanwhile the good ship
Bermuda will t continue her regular * trips
between Florida and ports in Cuba.

CALIFORNIA STILL THE BANNER
STATE IN GOLD.
From the Argonaut.
The latest official figures on the bullion pro
duction of California are at band. jj The Mint
statistician shows that this State, in 1895, pro
duced $15,334,317 69 in gold and $599,789 70
in silver, as against $13,863,281 89, gold, and
$297,351 55, silver, in 1894. The gold increase
of 1895 was $1,471,035 80 and the silver
$302,458 15, a total of $1,773,493 95. .We thus
see that as a gold-yielder California maintains
her lead. Considering the noise made by the
Cripple Creek excitement and the other dis
coveries of note in Colorado, it was to have
been expected that that State would excel
California by many millions. But, as a matter
of fact, Colorado falls behind us, with an "esti
mated" $15,000,000 as her gold product and
"estimates" rarely fall below the mark.
Colorado has made a splendid advance, and
tbe activity of her citizens in advertising and
developing her natural wealth promise to do
great things for her. But we have the ad
vantage of resources. Relatively to the known
riches of California those of Colorado are insig
nificant. Mining engineers and other experts
the world over are aware of California's nat
ural opulence. They admit it, talk of it freely
if asked, but have grown into the habit of tak
ing it for granted that interest cannot as
readily be aroused in California mines as in
those of comparatively new regions. Novelty
and imagination form a powerful combina
tion. There is a tradition, too, that the in
vestor here takes unusual risk of falling into
the hands of sharpers. This we owe largely to
the history of the Comstock lode, which is sim
ply the history of one long swindle.
The Comstock Lode is in Nevada, and its
product has been mostly silver, but in the
world's mind it has come to figure as a repre
sentative California gold-field. That is our
misfortune and one that only gradually is be
ing overcome. Writing will not make the
truth known to moneyed men with coin to
place, but the mines of California themselves
are doing the good work of enlightenment.
One good mine is worth more than 10,000
newspaper articles and all the mining con
ventions that could be held in twenty years.
The kind of information that goes to capitalists
and is believed by them is the news of divi
dends. The sort of activity noticeable at
Angels Camp and at Coulterville tells the
story of what is being done and has in it the
prophecy of what is soon to be.
The Utica's enormous output has made
capitalists everywhere envious, and the work
of development, now in progress on an exten
sive scale on the mother lode at Coulterville,
has every prospect of being rewarded as richly.
If that shall happen, capital will come to Cali
fornia plentifully. We cannot have too much
of it, no matter where it hails from. Of course
it would be preferable were home capital to
appropriate the dividends, but home capital is
timid and sluggish and will only follow at the
heels of foreign courage. Consequently the
more foreign capital there shall De invested in
our mines, the more home capital will seek
them. Hence a double reason for welcoming
foreign money.
A State that, since 1849 up to and including
1895, has yielded $1,269,115,604 in gold, by
official record, with many millions more that
went away through channels no account of
which could be kept has a right to claim
primacy in the mining world. Vast as has
been the product, is but an indication of
what is left for money and brains and muscle
to get. : The opening of new mines and the in
coming of capital have sent out the prospect
ors and brought from neglect many properties
that have long lain dormant. New processes
have reduced the cost of mining and corrected
waste, as well as made practicable the opera
tion of mines that under old methods would
have been unprofitable. Hydraulic mining
will be resumed. Enterprise, stimulated by
success, will venture experiments and take
chances. The dazzling nature of the prizes
that are sure to be drawn by the more fortu
nate will do their part in spurring to emula
tion. A great mining boom is in prospect. - j
The boom may not come this year or the j
next, but it is not very far off. - California,
mineralized in nearly all her counties, pre
sents a domain for exploitation beside which
all others now known, including Colorado and
South Africa, are distinctly inferior. ' It is a
field in which, considering it as a whole,
little has been done, notwithstanding its
colossal yield. There are a hundred veins un
touched for each that has been tapped. The
mountains are reservoirs of I wealth watiing
for capital. ' Experts, as we have said, know
this. , Capitalists are â *. certain to - learn the
truth presently. They are learning it now,
and their agents who come to make inquiries
and investigate reports are increasing in num
ber. -, This sort of thing grows in geometrical
proportion. Heace our confidence that a min
ing boom such as California never saw .. before
is impending. It will be one accompanied by
stock speculation, *of 'â â  course, but it will be
grounded on mines and not on wildcats. . . ..'
There are not many in California who are
aware of the growth of interest in mining
properties in this State which has taken place
within a period of three years. Companies in
London; New York and Chicago, composed of
men of wealth, have been quietly organized to
make investments and their representatives
are looking for producing mines regardless of
cost. . Efforts have I been made to purchase the
Utica and other great producers, but â¢ the own
ers very naturally decline to sell. It is not too
much Jto say that | six gold . mines, large * and
small, are being worked now in California j for
one in 1893. * Three . years hence, if signs 1 can
be relied on, there will "be a dozen worked for
every being operated in 1896. That will
be the boom, and when we have it, California
will renew her acquaintance ; with i that I pros
perity which is her birthright. -
A COWARDLY ACT.

A DECIDED IMPROVEMENT.
l '-7>7>77-7 Stockton Graphic.
Very few metropolitan papers are served to
their patrons in convenient form. It is disa
greeable to purchase a great big daily at a
news stand or of a newsboy, and the moment
you open it have a half dozen or \ more sheets
blown : sky-west and crooked. The San Fran
cisco Call has obviated this trouble, and its
large edition of thirty- two pages comes in only
two parts. It is a decided improvement and
should be adopted by other large papers.
GROWING IN POPULARITY.
Eureka Standard.
The Call of the 20th inst. contains a well
written article on the overland mail service
between San Francisco and Eureka, in which
it quotes with approval an article from the
Standard on the , same subject. | The Call of
late has paid much attention to Humboldt
County, and its subscription list in this county
is on the increase. It is a live paper and is in
the field for California's best interestsâ not for
one section, but for all sections. The paper is
growing in popularity, and it deserves it.
AN INDEPENDENT VIEW.
Guadalupe Standard. .3 V '3
The San Francisco Call j in a recent issue
asked for the opinion of the Republican press
01 this State on the subject of whether Cali
, fornia" should send; a pledged or unpledged
delegation to tne National Convention. Al
though we do not come under the Republican
banner, as we are independent In j politics, we
believe It would always be to the best interests
of any State to send an unpledged delegation
to the National Presidential Convention, as a
pledged delegation is always a dead weight in
such a place. .*'.'.*...-"- â¢' â¢ â¢â ' .â¢ ; .- : *
BROAD AND LIBERAL.
Western Watchman.
Several months alter. The Morning Call
passed under the present management, and
when the announcement of the intended con
struction of its splendid new building j was
given to the public, the Watchman took occa
sion to commend the broad and liberal gauge
upon which the new management was run
ning the paper, building it up and giving it a
prestige that it had never before attained. We
feel that The Call is still further broadening
its sphere and ground for public appreciation
in the course it is pursuing politically, for,
while it is openly a Republican paper, it is
admitting in its department "Letters From the
People," articles treating of reform principles
from the Populist standpointâ well
directed articles from that well-known Popu
list writer and erstwhite editor, J. A. Johnson,
Esq. . - .
The articles are not partisan, treating rather
of principles, but those principles are the very
core of the reform movement, and The Call
cannot be too highly commended for its
marked liberality in this direction, for while
it expresses its own opinions editorially, it
gives the people who subscribe for and read
its columns for the news they contain a chance
to express their opinion. The broader the
gauge of a great metropolitan newspaper the
more people it is calculated to reach, and The
Call is certainly molding its course to reach a
very large proportion of the people. While the
conservative and Republican element will un
doubtedly take pleasure in reading The Call's
editorial as well as news columns, the Watch
man urges its Populist readers to make a point
of reading the most excellent and instructive
letters from the pen of J.A.Johnston. The
Call deserves the recognition of the people.
IN APRIL.
All the world is young again;
Tenderly and sweet
Birds sound forth the old refrain
Where the brunches meet.
Every heart must have a mate
In such days as these,
Swinging from the garden gate.
Or swinging in the trees.
Madrigals that fill the air
. Rise from shore to shore;
Every Â»>elng mocks at care,
Turning troubadour.
Trustingly they question fate
With their melodies,
Swinging on the garden gate,
Or swinging in the trees.

AN EIGHT-GORED SKIRT.
This design is very desirable for making up
any of the wool materials, as it retains its
shape better than any other cut. The back
folds and the five gores comprised in the front
and sides may be lined ' with hair cloth at the
bottom only, either one-third the skirt length
or even less.
The lining of silk or cambric should be cut
exactly like the material, but should be sewed
up separate. The edges of the hair cloth
should be bound and overlapped, and all the
seams in front and sides should be pressed flat
both in the lining and the skirt. Then lay the
seams together and the finish in the inside is
the neatest possible. Turn up the edge of the
skirt and cat-stitch it to the interlining of
hair cloth, and then turn in the silk and blind
stitch it to the material. To save the edge, run
a braid or cord of mohair, on either of which is
preferred to velveteen for this wide skirt. The
back is gathered at the top or laid in three
box-pleats. The four seams are tacked to two
pieces of elastic to hold the forms together in
godet or cup-shaped folds, one piece being
tacked at the bottom |of the placket and an
other about half way down the skirt length
The neatest way to finish the placket is to
turn in the edges of outside and lining just the
depth of the seam and blind stitch them
together, tacking a strip four inches wide for a
flap on one side, and hooking it to the belt on
the other side. A placket finished in this way
will not gap. . â  *
Dresses of wash goods are made up very satis
factorily in this shape, and striped goods can
be cut so that the stripes will form points at
the seams by cutting all the forms with the
stripes straight up and down the center, which
brings both sides of each piece bias.

one of the dailies the other day he had no no
tion that he possessed as many friends as he

from various well-known commercial houses,
and these were accompanied in many instances
by substantial presents. There were about a
dozen different kinds of soap, nine samples of
various infant foods, three bottles of beef ex
tracts, a powder puff and seven boxes of violet
powder, lour or five different kinds of night
lights, eight babies' bottles, three elaborate
works on how to bring up young children,
specimens of linen and flannel for infant at
tire and advertisements innumerable of every
thing that a baby could possible need. Besides
these there came proposals from a dozen in
surance companies to insure the life of the
baby and the whole family on especially ad
vantageous terms, prospectuses from a Califor

The Oregon-C. W., City- The steamer Or
egon arrived in San Francisco for the first time
on the 31st of March, 1849. She was one of a
trio of steamers belonging to the Pacific Mall
Steamship Companyâ the California, the Pan
ama and the Oregon, used by that company
to fulfill its contract with the United States
Government to carry, for $200,000. the mails
semi-monthly between Panama and Astoria
via San Francisco. The California was the
first of the vessels to make the trip, and sne
was followed by the Oregon. The last named
left New York City and -teamed around the
Horn without passengers, reac *^sf Q Pa ,SÂ£â¢ a

in his "Memoirs." says: "Captain Robert â¢â¢

Depth of Cceanâ F. G., Home of Rest, Beu
lah, CaL As yet no experiment made has
proved that there is a limit to which a weight
will sink in the ocean. A weight dropped in
the water will decrease in rapidity of descent
according to the density of the water through
which it passes in its downward course. The
deepest water of which there is any record Is
near to the east coast of Japan. In 1875 the
officers of the United States steamer Tuscorora
took soundings there to the depth of five and
a quarter miles, the lead taking over an hour
to reach bottom. A trial was made with a
heavy sounding weight in a chasm near the
Japan current, but the lead did not fetch
up at all. As the depth of the ocean has not
been fathomed, it is impossible to tell to what
depth a sounding lead will go. Some of the
deepest soundings are as follows: North At
lantic Ocean, 4651 fathoms; South Atlantic
Ocean, 3284; North Sea, 442; Baltic Sea, 233;
Mediterranean Sea, 2405; Black Sea, 1431;

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Leaking American Bark Patched
Up by South Sea Island
Divers.
WORK DONE UNDER WATER.
Coal for the Oregon Now Ready.
Will Be Placed on the Battle
ship Friday.
The American bark Seminole will go
back to Australia. California redwood is
now called cedar nearly all over the world
and vessels are in demand to take It to
Europe, Asia, Africa and Australasia
besides the southern part of America. The
Seminole is not the ! first vessel by any
means that has taken lumber to Melbourne
and Sydney, but she pioneers the way for
a fleet that is now up and loading for all
points of the compass.
During her trip from Newcastle, N. S.
W., to this port with coal, the Seminole
had a remarkable experience. As stated
in The Call she sprang a leak and
Captain Weeden ran for one of the South
Sea Islands. Fifty tons of the cargo was
jettisoned, but nevertheless the leak could
not be reached. Finally it was decided
that the leak was due to a butt that had
started in the lower hold and that repairs
would have to be made. Two pearl-divers
were engaged and it took them just an
hour to repair the damage. They made
no preparations, but simply dived into the
water and located the leak. On their
return they took a piece of sheet lead, a
hammer and some nails and went down
again. The hole was covered but not
made watertight, so another descent had
to be made. On this occasion the men
stayed down nearly two minutes and made
a thorough success of the operation.
â¢'lt was the cheapest and best job I ever
saw performed in my life," said Captain
Weeden yesterday. "The men went down
perfectly naked, and as the wafer in the
southern seas is as clear as glass we could
see all their movements. They moved
around like fish, and after locating the
leak came to the surface just as fresh
as though they had been in the open
air all the time. After nailing on the lead
they came up and drew a long breath,
came up the ship's sides like monkeys,
and I'll swear you couldn't see a quiver
in their nostrils or a heave in their flanks,
even though they had. been .under water
nearly two minutes." 77 33
The Seminole is now at Oakland, dis
charging, and from there she will goon
the drydock for repairs, and thence to
Pueet Sound to load lumber for Australia.

There is trouble on the schooner J. M.
Coleman. She is now almost loaded for
the Amoor River, and a crew was signed
yesterday at $16. As this is $4 below the
regular rate, the shipping masters are
complaining and late in the afternoon
four of the men were missing. The vessel
has the machinery and supplies for a
stern wheel steamer aboard, but the
chances are that it will be several days be
fore she gets away, as more men are ex
pected to desert to-day.
The Oregon is expected to get out of the
drydock to-night or at high tide to-morrow
at the latest. She will then be towed to
the buoy off the Union Iron Works, and
there 800 tons of coal will be put in her.
Piper, Aden, Goodall Company's schoon
ers, will be used, and A. E. Pryor, the
superintendent, thinks the work can be
accomplished before Saturday. In that
event the Oregon will have her trial trip
next week. :"â *"
WILL PASTOR BROWN WIN?
His Friends Claim That He
Has More Than a Majority
of the Members.
The Opposition Will Vote for the
Adoption of the Bay Confer
ence Report.
The leaders in the strong fight that is
now being made to officially dispose of
Pastor Brown met at Dr. Jonathan T. Mc-
Donald's office, room 63, Columbia build
ing, last night. As usual the meeting was
held behind closed doors. Dr. McDonald
guarding the entrance with the utmost
vigilance. George Gaden, the custodian
of the list containing the names of those
who oppose Brown, was on hand. 3-3;.
Af*er- two hours' earnest discussion' it
was decided to vote for the adoption of the
Bay Conference report. Should they fail
to carry the point then they will resort to
legal measures. 33 >3{;
While Dr. Brown's enemies have been
at work bis friends have not by any means
been idle. They claim to be able to mus
ter nearly 300 votes, which is 50 or 60 more
than the opposition has so far been able
to bring to its standard.
i.The first matter to be considered to
night is the report of the Bay Conference,
adopted at the special meeting held April
21. i This report has been officially pre
sented to the church by Rev. Mr. Hatch,
registrar of the conference, and Brown's
friends will move that the report be laid
on the table. If this motion is sustained
it means that Brown will remain in the
First Church until legally displaced.
. It is possible, of course, that the oppo
sition will spring some sort of a surprise
not down on the programme. In that
event Deacon Morse may find his present
scheme permanently thwarted.
In the meantime the statement is made
that Brown's name has been removed from
the Congregational year book, soon to be
issued in Boston. This is equivalent to
saying that he is without the pale of Con
gregationalism all over the world.
A rumor was current yesterday that
Mrs. Cooper intended to resign from the
First Church, In explanation of this she
said last night:
â¢"It has been suggested to me time and
again by my friends that I could do a
better and greater work 3 outside , the
church. 'â '< Had this idea came to me years
ago I might bave adopted it, but at my
time of life I could do very little before
the final end came. I shall continue with
the church as long as I live."

thing else. No bones were broken, and after
remaining in the hospital for an hour or so he
was able to go to his home, 1807 Union street.

HOME PRODUCTS ONLY.
Manufacturers Aver This Coast
Can Easily Fill One
Pavilion.
ARRANGING FOR EXHIBITS.
Believe That Eastern Novelties Would
Impair the Flavor of Local
Products.
The board of directors of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association held a
special meeting yesterday afternoon to dis
cuss the results of the meeting of their
conference committee with the conference
committee of the Mechanics' Institute,
held for the purpose of arranging for an
exposition in the Mechanics' Pavilion dur
ing the ensuing fall.
The meeting developed the fact that the
manufacturers had full faith in the ability
of this Coast to fill not only one pavilion
with home-made articles, but three or four
pavilions, as the case might be, should
such a necessity exist. They wanted, in
other words, to be all California or
nothing.
The following gentlemen were present:
A. M. McLaughlin, W. F. Bowers, M. J.
Keller (first vice-president and chairman),
M. McGlynn, J. W. Kerr, A. Sbarboro, L.
R. Mead (secretary), Fred H. Dingle (as
sistant secretary) 'and S. H. Tacy (man
ager). " v
In the previous joint committee meeting
the following resolutions, framed by the
Board of Trustees of the Mechanics' Insti
tute, were adopted:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this commit
tee that the exposition be confined to manu
factures and products of the Paciiic Coast States
(except as to such articles of manufacture
which are not manufactured on the Pacific
Coast, or which may be novelties).
Volea that the exposition be held under the
auspices of the Mechanics* Institute and the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association of
California.
Voted that the management be vested in a
board, consisting of the Board of Trustees of
the Mechanics' Institnte and three directors of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion, the latter as an advisory committee with
the committees on exhibits and management
of the Mechanics' lnstitute. .
Voted that the price of single admission be
_.*"> cents for adults or eveningâ 15
cents for children under 14 years, "fi
It was also stated at that meeting that
space and power to exhibitors would be
free and that after deducting for the Me
chanics' Institute 10.000 from the net re
ceipts of the exposition, the balance
should be' divided equally between the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion and the Mechanics' Institute.
During the meeting of the manufactur
ers yesterday there was much discussion
over the provision for dividing the net
receipts and also the matter of bringing
into the exposition for exhibit what is
designated as novelties and other articles
not manufactured on this coast.
Chairman Keller pointed out the great
success that was accorded the product ex
position held in Oakland and was oi the
opinion that . San Francisco alone could
fill two pavilions with articles, of its own
manufacture.
"Articles of Eastern manufacture," said
W. P. Bowers, "will impair the flavor of
our own products; people should leave
filled with the importance of home produc
tion."
It was finally ; resolved that home
products only be admitted at the exposi
tion, the committee resolution reading:
Resolved, That It Is the sense of this commit
tee that the exposition be confined to manu
factures and products of the Pacific States.
It was further resolved that the confer
ence committee ,be hereafter clothed with
full authority in the matter of arranging
for the exposition, but that it should con
sider the home-product proposition as
final, and confer with the Mechanics' In
stitute committee with a view to- lowering
the stipulated $10,000 to $7500, above which
sum an, equal division should be made
with the exception, however, of all rental
charges. 3 3-33
WILL BE ARRESTED AGAIN.
Warrant Out for James Iredale on the
Charge of Burglary.
The tailor-shop of Samuel Darner at 216
O'Farrell street was entered by three
burglars on the night of December 14 last
and a quantity of cloth was stolen. One
of the men, J. Maloney, was arrested and
sent to Folsom penitentiary.
The two _thers,3 Danny Johnston and
James Iredale, left the City and turned up
in Oakland. Johnston; under the name of
Wilkinson, ; was arrested V for burglary in
Oakland and' got fifteen years in Folsom;
Iredale, under * tne / name of Kilburn, got
five' months for petty larceny. While in
the - Oakland jail Iredale made an unsuc
cessful attempt to escape. He has served
three terms in San Quentin.
Iredale's sentence !of five months will
expire In a day or two, and yesterday
Policeman Jerry Dinan swore out a war
rant in Judge Jonchimsen's court for his
arrest for the Darner burglary. The war
rant will be served upon Iredale as he
leaves the Oakland jail.
FIRE IN THE OLD COLLEGE.
The Westminster School on Haight
Street Saved by Prompt Firemen.
A fire broke out in the old Westminster
School on Haight street, near Octavia,
yesterday morning. It was discovered by
firemen of Engine Company 19 on "Waller
street, immediately in the rear, and be
fore the flames got much of a start they
were subdued by. l 9 engine. .
A worn-out line at the back of the build
ing communicated fire to the roof. Little
danger was done, however, except to a few
square feet of shingles and plaster.
The loss is estimated at $100 and is cov
ered by insurance.
The building was occupied in the upper
story as a dwelling by Mrs. Matthews, its
owner. It was formerly the City College
at Stockton and Geary streets, whence it
was removed about twenty years ago.

to take preliminary steps toward prepar
ing for the building of the new roof, Act
ing Mayor Taylor occupied the chair in the
absence of Mayor Sutro.
Auditor Broderick expressed an entire
willingness to go ahead with the prepara
tions for building the new hall, but said
he was not sure that the bonds given by
Mayor Sutro as a City Hall Commissioner
would be applicable to the acting Mayor
and asked information from the other
Commissioners on the subject.
Acting Mayor Taylor said that he had
not given the matter any thought, and
City and County Attorney Creswell stated
that he had not consulted the law, so that
the matter was allowed to drop until an
examination of the authorities could de
termine whether bonds given -by the
Mayor as City Hall Commissioner could
be made to cover tbe latter office when
held by his acting successor in the former
office. ",. ;:^3~-3-3g*;33 \--7ti:, : :333-*3 : 3:->.
City and County Attorney . Creswell
called attention to the fact that the elec
tric light wires that are attached to the
roof oi the hall must be removed before
the new roof could be put on.
Architect Shea stated that he had been
in consultation with the electric-light
company, and that the managers had
claimed that it was the duty of the City to
remove the wires. 3333 i
"The City will not stand one dollar of
the expense," said Commissioner Cres
well. "It was through our courtesy that
the company was permitted to put its
wires over the roof, and it should be re
quired to take them down, without one
cent of expense to the municipality."
Mr. Creswell moved that the corporation
be given thirty days to remove the wires,
and the measure carried unanimously.' r â 
On the advice of the City Hall plumber,
who called the attention of the Commis
sioners to the fact that the supply pipes to
the tanks on the roof were not so large as
the pipes carrying water out of the reser
voirs, and that the tanks were frequently
empty from the cause mentioned, it was
decided to overhaul the pipes and remedy
the difficulty. -3- :

IMBER AND A GLASSY EYE
He Finds the Gates of the
Temple Closed Against
Him.
RABBI FRYER IS NON EST.
Rahbi Nieto Passes By Looking Due
East With the Cabbala Pro
fessor in the West.
Professor Naphtaly Herz Imber went
round to the Temple. Emanu-El yesterday
afternoon with his Bible under his arm for
the purpose of meeting Rabbi Fryer, ac
cording to the conditions set forth in his
challenge. . _ . â¢
The professor had said there were cer
tain words in the Hebrew Bible that he
was sure Rabbi Fryer could not correctly
translate, and in the confidence of his be
lief challenged the rabbi to meet him in
the vestry of the Temple Emanu-El at 3
o'clock. â -*'*'â 
The professor was on hand with a follow
ing of four friends. One of the iron gates
was open and they entered and met a large
robust man who inquired their business.
The professor stated it. The robust man
said that he was in charge of the property
for the time being ; this was the first he
had heard of any meeting to take place
there, and that no such meeting would
take place there if he knew it. "Further
more," he said, "Mr. Imber has no author
ity to use the name of the Temple Emanu-
El in his controversy. We have nothing
to do with it here."
So the professor and his little party re
turned, protesting, to the sidewalk. As
they reached the gate Rabbi Nieto and a
friend walked up the street and passed on,
giving the entire party the glassy eye.
Professor Imber submitted the follow
ing last evening for publication :
To the Editor of The Call: The reason given
to me Iby the Emanu-El people for not allow
ing the place for the word duel is, as they
know, that Fryer will not stand the test, and
then it will be a "chilul hashem" fa disgrace
for the holy name). The opinions of the rab
bis here are that Fryer cannot now go back,
after he has accepted my challenge through
the public press, and he will be regarded as
unfit to occupy a rabbinical position until he
will stand the challenge. *--'.
A reporter of the Examiner called yesterday
upon me with a clear question, namely, "What
relation has the. Cabbala to the Jewish re
ligion?" I replied to him in a very clear, ex
plainable way. The question asked is of a
very important matter, and in the next Sun
day Call I ill give an extract from my un
published book, "Tne Battles of Jehovaha," to
that effect, with the following features: \ f3v;
1. Abraham's hegira. 7y-:77
2. Abraham elected as an Elohistic prince by

3. Difference between the religion of the

ALBERT PIKE IS MISSING
Disappearance of a Favorite
Employe of the Bella
Vista.
AN ALLEGED CHECK FORGER.
Borrowed Articles From Guests Before
He Leftâ On His Way
South,
Albert Pike, a 19-year-old youth who for
a year past has been employed as a bell
boy at the Hotel Bella Vista, is missing
from the establishment, and Mrs. Volney
Spalding, the proprietress, mourns the
loss of $30, drawn on a forged check, whiie
guests of the hotel anxiously await the
return of sundry articles borrowed by the
suave boy. '- \-*3 '>3::};
Pike was quite a favorite with the male
as well as female guests of the Bella Vista,
and when his needs in the way of dress
and entertainment caused him to lack
money he had little trouble in borrowing
all he asked. 333 - -L"-.* â **
' He â  frequently borrowed $20 from the
young men who boarded at the house, but
almost invariably repaid the money within
a short period, and was considered a model
boy by those who tolerated a certain de
gree of familiarity from him.
On numerous occasions Mrs. Spaldine
trusted him to cash checks for small
amounts at a neighboring drugstore, and
it was through his acquaintance with the
druggist that he was able to perpetrate the
forgery. ;.-.â¢
Pike was last seen Saturday. On that
day he borrowed a dress-suit case from a
guest named F. V. Brooks, saying that he
was going away for a few days and that
he would not like to have the other boys
in the hotel know it.
On the same day he presented a check,
drawn by Peter Dean in favor of Mrs.
Spalding and indorsed by the latter, at
the drugstore and received the face
value, $30.
The check was on the Sather Banking
Company and when presented was pro
nounced a foreery. This led to an investi
gation and a discovery of the fact that
young Pike was missing.
He was seen by a son of one of the guests
of the hotel going on board the Los Ange
les train at the Oakland mole Sunday
night and it is presumed that he is now in
the City of the Angels.
The police have been notified of bis acts
and sudden departure, but those who are
losers by his peculations are not sure that
they will prosecute if he be captured.

DELIGHT OF ARCHITECTS
Regents of the University Meet
to Discuss Permanent
Plans.
FAME OF. THE LANDSCAPE.
Renowned Architects cf the World
May Be Invited to Enter the Field
of Competition.
The Board of Regents of the University
of California met at the Mark Hopkins In
stitute of Art yesterday afternoon to con
sider a harmonious and' comprehensive
scheme for the future construction of uni-
versify buildings at Berkeley.
The proposition is not altogether new,
as Regents Martin, Hallidie, Wallace,
Houghton, Rodgers and others have had
it in mind for many years, and a resolu
tion was adopted some years ago holding
that future buildings should be grouped
in harmony about a grand central struc
ture.
In this particular line of duty J. B.
Reinstein has been exceedingly active since
his appointment to -the position of regent
and his fellow-members on the board com
mend his enterprise. He suggested some
weeks ago that the board hold ii special
session to consider this subject and accord
ingly the meeting was appointed for Tues
day, April 23.
The members present yesterday were
Regents Phelps, John E. Budd, Marye.
Hallidie, Miller, Denicke, Martin, Wallace.
Houghton, Kellogg, Rodgers, Reinstein
and Secretary Bonte.
At the beginning of the session an offi
cial communication was read, stating that
C. M. Chase had been re-elected president
of the State Agricultural Society for the
ensuing year. By virtue of this office Mr.
Chase is a regent of the University.
.President Kellogg announced that Mr.
Howe, professor of botany, had resigned.
The resignation, to take effect May 15,
was accepted.
R. H. Sherman resigned bis oflice as
clerk of the recorder, and H. H. Overstreet
was appointed to fill the vacancy.
W. M. Hart, instructor of English, was
granted leave of absence without loss of
pay. The time limit of his railroad ticket
is about to expire, and he must travel now
or never.
When Mr. Bernstein began to speak of
the future glory and possible grandeur of
the university, Regent Phelps, who had
been called to the chair as the presiding
officer, looked with dismay at the formida
ble documentary works behind which the
new Regent was so strongly intrenched.
Other Regents assumed attitudes of re
pose, and Mr. Reinstein began. Nothing
disturbed the serenity of the session in
the slightest manner until 2:50 p. m., when
a quick tremor of the earth shook the
Mark Hopkins building. The shock did
not disconcert Mr. Reinstein to the degree
of a punctuationg point
Unmoved by the seismic disturbance he
spoke eloquently of glorious architectural
piles and read letters from renowned
architects and high-salaried college presi
dents to show how exalting to the human
mind and how necessary to the formation
of human character were visible examples
of great achievements in architecture.
Mr. Reinstein made his advance on
three lines:
Firstâ ls a grand plan desirable?
Second ls the time ripe?
Thirdâ Are the means available?
Mr. R>instein held that failure at the
present time to adopt a general plan would
be serious. The enormous growth of the
university within the past few years had
made actual house-room necessary. The
last Legislature recognized this fact, and
surely the next Legislature would grant
an appropriation equal to that allowed at
the last session. He said:
"We have been building up the univer
sity on the hand-to-mouth principle. It
is high time that we should abandon this
policy and provide a permanent system of
expansion because the greatness of the
university is now foreshadowed."
Mr. Reinstein took the broad ground
that the architectural plans should be the
subject of international competition. Not
only the leading architects of America,
but the leaders in that profession of Eng
land, France and Germany should be
invited to enter the field. For example
$10,000 should be set aside for obtaining
plans; ten architects invited to send in
preliminary plans should each receive
$500. When a plan is accepted the arc i
tects should plan for buildines as the
structures are desired. To what extent
existing buildings could be utilized and
preserved in a general harmonious plan
was yet an open stion.
Charles Elliott Norton of Harvard was
quoted as saying that it might become
advisable to tear down all the buildings
now on the ground.
Mr. Reinstein also quoted from Presi
dent Elliott of Harvard, who had said that
wit in the lifetime of people to whom he
was then talking there would be but three
great universities in the United States
one at Cambridge, one in Chicago and one
in California.
The regent said nothing about President
Elliott's well-known habit of talking
through his, tile. Perhaps, he assumed
that his fellow-regents knew of Eiliott's
performances in . orally perforating a
chapeau.
Architect Howe of World, Fair celebrity
was quoted. Howe is helping the Ameri
can Episcopal University to -spend $10,
--000,000 on a college scheme in Washing
ton. He thought for a" time that the
Washington site was the grandest on the
globe for a display of architectural genius,
but when he came to California and saw
the glory of the Berkeley landscape he
threw up his hands "and said this was
surely the most beautiful site on earth.
Mr. -Reinstein read letters from a great
many collene lights. â¢ Among his : cor
respondents were the presidents respec
tively of Yale, Michigan, Cornell, Virginia,
Johns Hopkins, Colombia and other uni
versities.
About 4 o'clock in the afternoon Judge
Wallace asked if it would not be necessary
for architects to understand what build
ines would be first required;
Mr. Reinstein explained that Mr. May
rick, the teacher of architectural drawing
at Berkeley, was an exceptional! v capable
man in his line, and he would consult the
heads of departments and ascertain what
buildings would be first required. This
general plan would be submitted to all the
architects as a guide for planning the
scheme of the future. * '33 3
Judge Wallace doubted if any building
scheme could be carried out if the resents
attempted to follow the State law regard
ing the construction of public buildings.
He thought it might be advisable for the
regents to assert their rights under the
constitution and construct their buildings
without reference to the law relating to
other public buildings. ''The delay in the
Affiliated Colleges work has been caused
by our efforts to work under conflicting
State laws. No doubt some people, noting
this delay, may think that we are incom
petent to manage this trust. Yet the law
has caused the delay."
A further discussion ensued, in which
Regents Hall-die, Miller, Houghton, Rodd
ers and Martin participated, and in which
a sentiment was expressed against tearing
down any of the existing buildings at
Berkeley. 33*
Mr. Reinstein, to test the sense of the
regents, introduced a resolution directing
that the committee on buildings and
grounds, acting in connection with the
teacher of architectural -rawing, the
president of the university and the aca
demic council, prepare a programme for a
general permanent plan of grounds and
buildings at Berkeley. ;â  .; \
Regent Budd moved the adoption of the
resolution.
Regent Houghton asked Regent Martin
to explain what had been done in the past
in the same direction.
J. West Martin said a landscape en
gineer had been authorized to present a
ground pian, and architects had been in
vited to give their opinions as to the
grouping of buildings.
The resolution was adopted without a
dissenting vote. In the course of the dis
cussion mention was made that the funds
of the university were exhausted and that
the institution would be in debt at the
close of the year.
Judge Wallace regarded the condition as
cause for congratulation. The university
had properly expended all the money al
lowed, and now having 2000 students was
in debt. Had the number of students
diminished and money accumulated in
the treasury there would have been cause
for discouragement.
HE SMUGGLED OPIUM
Dennis Gallagher Arrested With
Many Cans in His
Possession.
He Was a Fireman on the Steamship
Australiaâ Two Companions
Escape.
Dennis Gallagher, a fireman on the
Oceanic steamship Australia, was arrested
by Custom-house officials early yesterday
morning and charged with smuggling
opium.
Inspector Ferguson, who was stationed
at the Oceanic dock, having special in
structions to keep a sharp lookout for
smugglers, saw three men board the Aus
tralia at an early hour yesterday morning.*
Calling Customs Inspector Halpin to
his assistance the men were followed to the
firemen's forecastle, where eleven tins of
unstamped opium were found in Gal
lagher's bunk, and twelve tins in a bundle
of clothing -which one of the strangers
carried.
The two men who were with Gallagher
made their escape.
The Custom-house searchers made a
thorough inspection of the steamer and
found a large quantity of unlawful opium
scattered among numberless tins of the
lawful article which the Goverment could
not seize. ,
The customs authorities have been fol
lowing the unlawful opium dealers for
some time and the apprehesion of yester
day is the first practical return from their
efforts. 7777\
The Australia sailed at 10 a. m., but an
other fireman was at Gallagher's post.
A MOTHER'S MISTAKE.
Mrs. Wilson Gives Her Little Daughter
Carbolic Acid Instead of
Iron.
Mrs. Wilson, 565 Stevenson street, made
an unfortunate mistake yesterday after
noon which might have caused the death
of her little daughter, Viola, 2 years and 6
months old.
The child has been under treatment by
the doctors at the polyclinic on Ellis
street for a ssin disease on her face. Mrs.
Wilson had a bottle of iron to be given to
the child in doses and a bottle of carbolic
acid and glycerine mixed for external
treatment. 7-7-77:
She made a mistake in tne bottles yes
terday afternoon and gave the little girl a
teaspoonful of the carbolic acid and gly
cerine mixture. The little thing swallowed
a portion of it and cried with the pain.
Mrs. Wilson saw her mistake and became
frantic with grief, thinking she had poi
soned the child. Accompanied by a lady
friend she hurried with the child to the
Receiving Hospital and Dr. Fitzgibbon
promptly applied the usual remedies.
It was fortunate that the carbolic acid
was largely mixed with the glycerine, oth
erwise the child would have died.
YOUNG'S LAST BRIEF.
M. M. Estee's Argument on the School
Superintendent Appointment.
M. M. Estee has filed his final brief in
the appeal of C. S. Young from Judge
Troutt's decision refusine to appoint him
Superintendent of Schools in the place of
Madison Babcock.
Mr. Estee's main point is that if the Su
pervisor's cannot appoint the Superintend
ent of Schools, as provided in the general
law passed at the last Legislature, the con
stitution is meaningless, because it declares
that general laws must apply everywhere,
in San Francisco as well as elsewhere.
And if it be declared that the law does not
apply to San Francisco, then it cannot be
general, and so it is unconstitutional.
A SEAMAN SUFFOCATED.
Captain Hoben Found Dead In Bed at
the Prescott House.
Captain Henry Hoben, formerly captain
of the steamer Mare Island, who lived
with his family in Berkeley, was suffocated
by gas at the Prescott House on Kearny
street Monday night. -
When the room which Hoben occupied
was entered yesterday morning the cause
of death was at once observed. Gas flowed
from an open burner and Hoben was dead
in bed. When he retired, it is said, he was
in a state of intoxication.
' The body was removed to the Morgue.
It is believed that Hoben's death was acci
dental.
Moeller's Fickle Bride.
Henry Moeller is suing for a divorce from his
wife of a few months â â  for desertion. Six
months ago he sent'for her to come out from
Germany and on her way she met Z. U. Dodge,
one of the officers of the steamship. They fell
in love with each other, but as he was already
married she, came out nere and married
Moeller. Now he says she has deserted him
and ne think*, she ha** gone East again.

â â¢-.--â . 77:.-y7' â : 74. 7---- y-7..:7- â :â â .â â â  -7 yu. .-. ,
the greatest volume of transfer business
in the City is transacted, and will also
place all the Third and Market street trans
fer business on the same basis. Heretofore
only the transfer business from the Third
street northbound cars to the cars of the
Market-street line has been handled by the
transfer agent.
I Ever since .the success of the plan was
fully demonstrated at Market and Third
streets preparations have been made for
the extension of the system, which is to go
into operation on the Ist of May at the
points named. Speaking of the matter
yesterday, General Manager Vining said :
"We have had this matter tested at
Third and Market streets with most re
markable and satisfactory results. It will
scarcely be believed, but ever since this in
novation the daily collection of transfers
given out on the northbound Third-street
cars and collected on the Market-street
line has fallen off GOO, while the number of
cash fares collected has increased the same
amount. Now this means $30 a day, or
very close to $11,000 a year, of which the
company had previously been unfairly, if
not dishonestly, deprived.
"It is strange how little thought people
give to matters of this kind. Five cents
appears to be a very small amount, and it
really is, but our whole business is made
up of these small amounts. No one, of
course, would think of prosecuting any
one for wrongly obtaining 5 cents, but if a
person were to steal $10,000 from the com
pany, every one would naturally expect
to see him prosecuted and punished. But'
the correct view to take of this is to see
that in the case of the $10,000 theft the
moral turpitude of only one person is in
volved, while the practice of petty pur
loining of transfers, in which the news
boys are often encouraged by * unthinking
men and women who believe they are per
forming a charitable act when they give
their ; transfers to the lads, involves and
affects the character of a hundred or more
. boys. 3 This easy way '- of earning money
without giving something in return is apt
to encourage in the growing youth the
propensity to make a living by his wits
rather than by honest and legitimate
labor. ""...*** â¢' - *'â 
"I do not think the people give their
transfers to the boys with any thought of
defrauding the company, but under the
idea that they are benefiting the, lads. It
is astonishing to what an extent the news
boys have educated the patrons of ?. the
cars in this matter. I speak now from
personal observation, for I have many
opportunities of seeing these things for
nyself. v *
"I remember one striking instance. It
was a dreary,. rainy day. s A lady left a
Powell-streetcar at -the corner of Market
street, s. taking a transfer 1 from the con
ductor. When she reached the sidewalk
she looked about as if in search of some
one she expected to meet. For a moment
a look of disappointment came over her
countenance. Then she evidently saw the
object of her quest, for she hurried across
the muddy street in the pouring rain, and
to my surprise tapped a newsboy on the
back, handed him her transfer, recrossed
the street in the storm and then went about
her business.
"Another practice that I know is in
dulged in is confined to some of those who
are in business near Powell and Market
streets. A man will ride downtown, take
his transfer and give it to a newsboy.
When he starts for home in the evening
he goes to the same boy and secures a
transfer that will carry him home, thus
making the round trip for 5 cents. The
gain of the newsboy comes from the occa
sional sale of a newspaper to these people.
"As I have stated before, I would be
glad to extend rather than curtail the con
veniences of our patrons, and would be
pleased to arrange our transfer system so
that any part of the City could be reached
from any other part of the City for a single
fare, but in sheer self-protection we have
been compelled to take the present, course.
It may cause a little inconvenience at first,
but the people will eventually get used to
it." ?7y-#X:777,
Here are the various circulars giving the
particulars of the changed transfer system
that will be introduced on the Ist of May:

- On and after May l, 1896, transfers will not
be given to or received from Powell-street cars.
Transfers will be issued and received by the
Turk, Eddy and Devisadero streets line. 3 Com
mencing May 1"1896, transfers will be given
only to passengers who ask the conductor for
them when settling for their fare. : ;",.
; Passengers traveling upon transfer tickets is
sued by a cross line will not be given transfers
to the cars of another cross line bound in the
opposite direction. Subject to the; above con
ditions, transfers will be issued and received

mento and Devisadero streets.

fers received from eastbound Page and Ellis
streets cars, and for such passengers only,
transfers will be issued to eastbound Jackson
streetcars at corner of Jackson and Devisadero

receive transfers from westbound Jackson
streetcars at corner of Jackson and Devisadero

Commencing May 1, '1806, the line of cars
formerly running from the corner of Devisa
dero and Jackson streets to the corner of Fill
more and Page streets will be withdrawn.
On week days, on and after that date, a car
will leave the corner of Page and Devisadero
streets at 6 _. m., and at intervals of twelve
minutes thereafter, up to midnight, running
via Page street to Fillmore street and return
ing via Oak street. At Fillmore street trans
fers will be issued to southbound Fillmore
street cars, and, subject to the rules of that
line, will be received from north-bound Fill
more-street cars. At Devisadero street trans
fers will be issued to the cars of the Ellis and
O'Farrell street line, bound in either direc
tion, and, subject to the rules of that line, will
be received from said cars.
The plan of giving checks to passengers
who desire to be transferred to another
line, which checks are to be exchanged by
the transfer agent for a transfer, is de
signed to put a stop to what the cohipany
considers an illegitimate traffic in their
transfers. The transfers now given out
give a margin of twenty minutes to
passengers who make a change from one
car to another. The new system is ex
pected to result in compelling the passen
ger to make a continuous trip, and to
afford no chance whatever to the newsboys
to profit from gifts of the rectangular
pasteboards. 7 3/3
The details of the scheme show that
they engaged considerable mental travail
in their perfection. The check given the
passenger will be very much like the pres
ent transfer. Instead, however, of having
the hours and minutes indicated on it, the
figures displayed permit of the punching
of the particular run and trip of the con
ductor issuing it. These figures will be a
complete mystery to the public, but to the
transfer agent who will give a transfer in
exchange for it it will tell the exact minute
when the passenger received it, as the
agent will have a memorandum of the
time every car passes his station during
the entire day.
He will thus be enabled to tell at once
whether a check, according to the rule es
tablished by the company, is good or void.
If the latter, he of course will decline to
make the exchange. There being nothing
on the check to inform the ordinary indi
vidual whether it is serviceable or not, it
is calculated that he will be chary of using
checks, except those regularly issued to
him.
A change will also be made in the trans
fers. They will allow of the time being
punched on them, so as to show five-min
ute intervals, instead of twenty minutes,
as now, and to further prevent any possi
bility of the transfer being manipulated
for the benefit of any one except the per
son to whom it is issued, it will not be
given out until the car it is to be service
able for is approaching the transfer agent.
The present agent at Third and Market
streets will continue to handle all the busi
ness at that point, but at Powell and Mar
ket streets two agents will be stationed.

Charles Lloyd's Suit Against
Easton & Eldridge and
Others.
He Claims That Fraud Was Prao ;
ticed Upon Him in a Land
Deal.
Charles R. Lloyd has commenced suit
for damages against Easton, Eldridge &
Co. and- Peter Kehl for a deal in real
estate by which the plaintiff says he was
defrauded. 333
Lloyd, with a man named . Cartwright,
in September, 1882, purchased from the
defendants some land with certain water
rights in San Bernardino County, near
Warm Creek. The defendants, so the
complaint alleges, assured the . purchasers
that sixty-five effective horsepower could
be secured from the creek, and, by the
construction of a new flume, 175 effective
horsepower could easily be secured. They
said the creek ran continuously over 2500
miners' inches of water. .
The plaintiffs and others then formed
the San Bernardino Electric Company and
fifty shares of the stock were issued as
partial security for the purchase price of
the land. It was soon discovered,
ever, that the creek would develop no
more than 45 horsepower, and that there
were no more than 1250 miners' inches in
it at low water. As a consequence, the
machinery set up was too powerful to be
economically worked, and nearly $20,000
was unnecessarily expended.
Upon learning of tho state of affairs, the
plaintiff says, he withdrew at once from
bis agreement. The defendants threaten
to sell the stock, pledged as security for
the purchase price, and ho wishes them
enjoined from such proceeding. He asks
further for $30,000 damages, the damages
to be considered as an offset to the pur
chase price, and he asks that his promis
sory notes be canceled. 3Â«II

MR. HAYNE HAS FINISHED
And Has Been Encored by a
Regular San Francisco
Earthquake.
MR. FOOTE WILL TAKE AD
Next Tuesday Mr. Garber Will Go
Tooting Down the Track on
Express Time.
In the words of the immortal Victor
Hugo, the unexpected has happened.
Mr. Hayne has finished his argument in
the railroad case.
That startling event occurred at 2:50
p. m. yesterday, and just as Mr. Hayne
had concluded by remarking that he really
didn't think he had anything more to say
on any phase of the case and that if in the
fervor of his argument he had said any
thing that might have rankled in the
breasts of the legal gentlemen composing
the Supreme Court of the Southern Pacific
Company he was sorry for it and would
ask that the words might be considered as
the idle winds that blew whither no man
wotted, there was a sharp shock of an
earthquake.
The shock was preceded by a noise, as of
the slamming of a door, and immediately
the brick building shuddered just for a
second, as the skin of a horse may be seen
to shudder with the bite of a bluebottle
fly.
Mr. Hayne was congratulated by every
one present on the powerful effect his
argument had on the mighty forces of
nature. It is not every man, not even the
eloquent Edmund Burke at the conclusion
of his speech on the impeachment of War
ren Hastings, who has had the honor to
be encored by an earthquake.
But Mr. Burke did not make his great
speech in San Francisco, and that is the
difference between him and Mr. Hayne.
Mr. Hayne spent the greater part of the
day in citing authorities to corroborate
his argument that under the constitution
Congress had not power over commerce
within a State. Its power was simply
with reference to interstate commerce;
domestic, commerce, or that within the
boundaries of a State, being solely within
t he power of the State.
This being the case, Congress could not
override the Federal constitution by cre
ating corporations and reserving certain

He went on to argue that the mere fact
that a State's regulation in domestic com
merce may incidentally affect interstate
commerce does not, by any means, allow
a State to regulate interstate commerce.
"If the United States has no power to
interfere with State commerce, what be
comes of your argument that we have not
the consent of Conttress to lease when the
statute of the State gives you no author
ity?" asked Mr. Pillsbury.
"-'What becomes of my argument?" re
plied Mr. Hayne, 'Why, that has abso
lutely no connection with it at all. it
does not affect my argument in the least.
The only power to intervene is in the cas*
of a lien upon the income."
"Suppose," asked Mr. Hayne, ignoring
the question, "that the Federal Govern
ment should now make a donation or a
loan to the Southern Pacific, and should
say: 'Now, I give you so much, and you
will pay me 10 per cent of your net earn
ings. Would that take away the power
of the State to regulate freights and fares
within its boundaries?" 3 *- 3
After a few more citations Mr. Hayne
closed. <--3
District Attorney Foote informed the
court that he had not had an opportunity
of looking over the authorities cited by
Mr. Hayne, and it was thereupon agreed
that Mr. Foote should begin bis argument
next Thursday. He said that he would
not occupy more than a day.
Mr. Garber will begin his argument next
Tuesday, and the case will be closed. So
it may be reasonably expected that the
case will be submitted in about three
weeks. . --

AND THE ARMY.
Emma Booth-Tucker Meets
the Soldiers at Metro
politan Temple.
A GREAT GATHERING.
The Leader Was Too 111 to
Make an Extended
Address.
NO DOUBT AS TO LOYALTY.
Only Slight Reference Made to the
Recent Ballington Booth
Incident.
Metropolitan Temple has been standing
on Fifth street a good many years, but it
has never seen such a sight as it witnessed
last night when the poke bonnet of Consul
Consul Emma Booth-Tucker at Metropolitan Templeâ Acclamations of the Enthusiastic Army.
Emma Booth-Tucker appeared beneath I
the Hags that framed the stage.
Brigadier Keppel had his army on its j
feet at the time singing hallelujahs. The
army was banked in a solid mass from the j
line of the stage to the roof. The poke â 
bonnets and the red shirts were in such |
evidence a3 gave an unusual warmth to !
this picture that is not unusual in Metro
politan Temple. The balconies were
draped in the colors of the army. From
the roof, in the center, above the stage,
swung down on each side of the big organ
the American flag.
At the end of the balcony to the left of
the stage was stationed a brass band that
was adding its timbre and tempo to the
cry of "Tear down the forts of Satan."
In the midst' of a fortissimo descent upon
the "forts of Satan" tbe majors and cap
tains and ensigns that form the directing
energy of headquarters, who were massed
upon the stage, made way and the red
banned, poke-bonnet of the consul came
through.
The trombone lifted up its voice two
octaves, the brass band developed its last
possibility of rolling thunder, and the lads
and lasses of the army broke into such
hallelujahs as left no doubt that the forts
of Satan had come down.
The consul simply smiled and waved
her Handkerchief.
When it had died down and Brigadier
Keppel could be heard, he said, "i wonder
what they think of this in heaven?"
Brigadier Keppel explained that the J
consul was really a very sick woman and '
had risen from a sick bed to come, to this
meeting. He hoped that she might not
be too severely taxed; said he himself had
advised her against coming here, but he
could not prevail. The extraordinary ex
ertions that this journey had demanded
of her, the constant traveling and speak
ing had overtaxed her physical resources,
and she was now suffering from a -severe
attack of the grip, for her speedy release
from the effects of which every soldier of
the army would join praying. "
Major Halpln, editor of the War Cry.
led in an eloquent prayer in behalf of the
consul, and Major : Malan, one of the
famous singers of the army, an Italian,
sang one of the specially applicable salva
tion-songs. :
Then the consul came forward and placed
her hand upon the flag-covered rail at the
edge of the stage. But with another burst
of greeting the great congregation recog
nized her "as her father's daughter.
She is not what the world would call
beautiful. Tall and straight of stature, her
features are large and sharply outlined;
large mouth large, straight, sharp nose;
eyes confident and commanding, rather
than appealing. Just so were her father's.
"It is a difficult matter to tie a true Sal
vationist down;" she began. Her voice
was not smooth, but vibrant and some
what sharp and unmusical, but, as she
warmed to her address, it was soon dis
covered she had the gift of words, which,
in her earnestness, grew to be eloquence.
Just so was her father.
She did not sneak long, but said she
hoped to be fully equal to such an occa
sion as this great audience presented, by
to-morrow night; "and Brigadier," she
said, turning to the commander of the
Pacific Coast division, "we mils', hear this
place filled with the glad cries of those
who feel the Redeemer within them."
She then told something of the story of
the work of the army, "that has enabled
us to plant the blood-and-fire flag in forty
two colonies ana almost entirely round
the world."
She had been using the simile of the en
gine and the train of cars to illustrate the
speeding progress of the army and its
work. "I wish to say one word more be
fore I sit down," she said. "I wish to say
that the engine-driver must have the light.
If he may not surely there must be acci
dent, wreck, disaster, if he does not."
She tola a story of "one of those poor
priests of India, who, hoping to get nearer
to God by renouncing the things of earth,
spent his life in a little cave in the moun
tain side. His end drawing nigh, he
prayed constantly that be might be al
lowed to die in the lightâ in the light of
the sun.
"Daily he climbed to a little knoll and
awaited the end, but one day his strength
was not equal to the task, and his dog
dragged him up where the light of the set- !
ting sun reached him and his own light!
went out. Unlike this poor creature, the :
Salvation leader lives among the people I
whom he labors to bring into the light I
with himself, but he, too, must have the
light. Sometimes there are storms and
winds that appear to hinder the progress
of the train, but God can make them
winds of assistance rather than hindrance,
and surely he will do so."
Only in this brief fashion did she touch
upon the recent dissension in the army led
by her brother, Ballington Booth. After
speaking some fifteen minutes she said her
strength was fast failing her, and she
closed and retired from the stage.
Major Lewis, a young English woman
who is the consul's chief assistant on this
tour, made a short address, explaining
something of the army and navy league of '
the Salvation Army, of which she is more !
especially at the head, and the work of
which is to be inaugurated during her stay
hereâ a work especially directed toward
the saving of seafaring men.
After some more singing and exhorta
tion by Major Malan the meeting closed
with the tiring of several volleys in behalf
of the consul.
The meeting was preceded by the great
est street parade in the history . of the
army in this City. The Chinese corps was
a distinct feature, there being no less than
thirty Chinamen in the line.
There will bi another meeting to-night
and still another to-morrow night. On
Thursday afternoon there will be a special
meeting, to which the auxiliary members j
of the army are invited. '.

"BLUE AND GOLD"
MAKES ITS BOW
Handsome Annual of the
Berkeley University
Juniors.
A FINE PIECE OF WORK
Number of Artistic Illustra
tions Adorn the
Volume.
SOME FEW BITS OF SATIBE
Professorial Censorship Prevents the
Publication of Hits at the .'
Faculty.
One of the neatest and most elegant
specimens of bookmaking yet produced
on this coast is the new "Blue and Gold"
book of the University of California. The
I volume is a large quarto, daintily bound
in light blue linen with gold lettering, and
I printed on the finest quality of thick cream
tinted, hot-pressed paper. This work con
; sists of 208 reading pages, each of which
is a gem of the typographer's art, while
the large number of illustrations with
which the volume is embellished render it
even more attractive.
Every effort has bean made to confine
the work of compiling the volume to col
lege talent. As the editors observe, the
contributions from outside sources have
been few, and for the most part necessi
tated by the pressure of time. Among
those who have lent their aid and advice
to the work are E. L. Steele, W. S. Wright
and Messrs. Sydney, Armour and Watson
I of the Art School and Miss Watson and
I Mr. Tebbs, to whom are due many of the
illustrations, vignettes and tailpieces with
! which the book abounds.
The fine photographic views of the uni
versity grounds were taken by Miss Jessie
Trowbridge. O. V. Lange fathers the ex-
I cellent photograph of the cadet officers,
while the headpiece to the freshman his
tory is the work, of Mr. Webster of Oak
land. The remainder of the illustrating
was done for the most part by H. B.
Quinn, the staff artist, and certainly re
flects much credit upon his ability and
judgment as an artist.
The book will "come out" this afternoon
I during the maneuvers of the student
j cadets on the university campus, and its
I advent, is most: eagerly looked for. The
| students have received vague hints that
j within its covers are . to be found all the
j college jokes of the. year; they have been
; led to believe that the hits and digs occa
sionally have for their object, some 'grave
I professor of the university, hence curiosity
lis rife. A peculiar feature is the gayly
I incisive * fashion in 3 which Â the idiosyn
i cracies of some of the college "freaks", and
the _ am bitious aspirations of the â¢ juniors
are noted.: All these little ways and foibles
are depicted in sarcastic doggerel and cut
ting rhyme, illustrated' by fantastic and
sometimes hideous caricatures.

its work subjected to a sort of censorship.
Still the students look for some neat, sharp
thrusts at the faculty, and the editors say
they are willing to abide by any conse
quences which may be brought about by
any personal allusions.
The frontispiece of the work is very ar
tistic. The bear of California is repre
sented stalking through his native forests,
on his back a little junior bearing a banner
on which appears emblazoned the title,
"The Blue and Gold," and on a fancy
background lower down, are the words,
"Published by the junior class, University
of California, 1896. ' Another interesting
feature is the roll of the faculty, or "aca
demic senate," with photogravures of * the
principal professors, the likenesess of Pro
fessors LeConte, Soule and Hilgard, being
particularly lifelike.
In the "History of Ninety-Six" there is
â  a touch of grim humor which will prob
i ably seem far from humorous to the par
| ties against whom the daintily-veiled
I arrow is directed. The "Chronicles of
i Ninety-Seven" also display much wit and
j originality though, perhaps, of a less
I pungent type. Long lists of the students,
with their likenesses, are given, the art
I work being specially deserving of men
tion. , . ,/v v-
Two "Freshmen's .Diaries," presumably
genuine, are given and provide interesting
reading. Then follow lists of the college
fraternities with lifelike photographs of
the officers of each; similar lists of the
ath'etic, social and sporting clubs of the
university, and other data of like charac
ter, with programmes of the various stu
dent fetes during the year.
A farce in one act entitled "Behind the
Shutters" makes delightful reading, save
for a few typographical errors which dis
tract the peruser's attention. A number
of poems, gay and serious, and of various
degrees of merit are sprinkled through the
work and add much to its interest. The
remainder of the book is taken up by
humorous sketches, personal notes and
jokes, which will not fail to be appreciated
by the initiated. As a whole the work
reflects much credit upon the skillful and
painstaking designers and will doubtless
find an honored place in many a library.
A committee has been formed in Liver
pool for the purpose of raising funds for

His Attitude Regarding the
A. P. A. He Says Is
Consistent.
GIVES ' A CAUSTIC CRITICISM.
The Rector of St. Patrick's Tells of
His Acquaintance With County
Clerk Jordan.
The following communication addressed
to The Call is self-explanatory:
Oakland, Cal., April 28, 1896.
Editor Call: Yesterday in correspondence or
news from Oakland The Call informed its
readers tnat Mayor Davie and County Clerk
'â "rank Jordan say that the facts upon which
Father Yorke made his assertions last Sunday
night in St. Francis de Sales* Church were mis
represented to him, and therefore they would
not reply to Father Yorke. it Is further stated
ln the same news item that Father McNally
commended the remarks of Clerk Jordan, on
the occasion of his presiding at an A. P. A.
meeting, and that Father McNally said if such
were the belief of the order he could say
nothing against It. I never knew Mayor Davie
in all my life up to date, and for the remaining
portion I never want to know him as long as
he continues "Davie, the renegade."
I never of course, spoke to Davie, and there
fore my conversation must have been to
County Clerk Jordan. No man knows better
than Frank Jordan what I think of A. P. A.
ism. He drew for me the sweetest and mildest
picture of his words above alluded to, which
words as* enunciated to me by the ever-smiling
Frank were indeed harmless and without
guile. I told him that if such were the prin
ciples and aims of the A. P. A. it could let in
everybody. Meanwhile I asked what of the
oaths, bigotry, rampant preacher tirades, lies,
and infamous language against the Catholic
churchâ in violation of all constitutional
order and divine charityâ their going
around to oust Catholics out of their positions,
etc. All such ho condemned as utterly abom
inable and distasteful to him. This" was all
private conversation. Everyone understands
the nature of private and friendly conversa
sation, and Frank must remember my words of
censure and advice. lam surprised at his in
troducing my name evidently to shield him
self. He seems to think that even in Oakland
an A. P. A. is pretty safe if he can get within the
shadow of my name. Frank Jordan is person
ally childlike and bland. He is, as he frankly

admitted, in the A.- P. A. for what's in it in
politics. No man living to-day would believe
Frank Jordan saying otherwise. I absolutely
and unqualifiedly deny that I ever gave Frank
Jordan credit for being broad-minded. I should
be convinced that Frank had a man's mind
before I could think of qualifying it so sweep
ingly. Did he not with one hand on the Bible
and the other on the image of the crucified
Saviorâ with one hand hiding the volume of
truth and the other covering up the outward
expression and emphasis of the God of love
and charityâ not Frank Jordan swear that
he'd deny to the Catholic the rights of a citi
zen? Did he not swear that he'd deny exist
ence or the means of living to Catholics by not
employing them while he could get a Protes
tant to till the bill, and so on and so on, in
utter violation of the constitution of our glori
ous country and of the constitution of heaven,
which is God's own sweet charity? Now, Mr.
Editor, if any of my acquaintances, and they
are numerous among the A. P. A., think that
they can shield themselves behind my name
by softening in words the harsh and hellish
monstrosity of A. P. A. -Ism they are certainly
mistaken. I have more to say if lam called
out. â¢!.-â¢::
I heartily indorse Father Yorke, who ar
raigned and censured Davie and Jordan for
presiding at A. P. A. meetings without at least
apologizing to the devil. Sir, I condemn any
and every man who joins any society or will
be found on the roll of any society or in the
companionship of any persons, and especially
every member of the A. P. A., whose oath
would oblige them to tear into shreds our con
stitution of civil and religious liberty and vio
late the laws of charity, engendering hate and
bad feeling among fellow-citizens, setting man
against man, neighbor against neighbor, filling
the "Home of the Brave" with religious dis
sensions and domestic strife. Here is where I
am side by side with Father Yorke in strongest
condemnation of citizens who claim to be
broad-minded and who have not at all a
citizen's mind, who for the sake of pelf and
political gain sell the birthright of their
American manhood. Out on such people!
Shame on those itinerant preachers who pro
mulgate such infamous teaching! Personally,
Frank Jordan and other such Franks are
socially pleasant, but, : being A. P. A.'s, are
devoid of principle ana are in manhood small
and dwarfed and withered caricatures on
American citizenship.

A TOWN OF CELEBRITIES.
The Stranger "Wanted to Find a Few
Common People.
Ex-Governor Perham, one of . Maine's
best preserved and happiest "ex's" enjoys
telling a story of a stranger's visit to a
little Maine Hill town of fragrant mem
ories, where one of the natives took pleas
ure in politely pointing out the local ob
jects of interest. ..,-.
"There," said the villager, pointing to
a handsome old-style house, "lived a
former member of Congress; yonder on
that street you see that big square house**
where one of Maine's most distinguished
sons was born, who was successively mem
ber of the Legislature, House of Represen
tatives in Congress, United States Senator
for a generation and Vice-President; right
down there is the modest printing office
where one of our boys used to works
whence he graduated to become a leading
political editor and afterward Postmaster-
General." .
As the promenade continued around the
village the native directed the attention
of the visitor to other old residences.
"There," said he, "is the former home of
another member. of Congress/Governor of
the State, etc., and over across there is
where another M. C. once resided. Right
down the street there is the old home of
Judge C. and over there is where Judge
E. used â¢to live years ago. We've got a
good lot of pretty famous lawyers, editors
and colonels besides that I haven't men
tioned." â

to get decidedly interested and burst forth

A FREE MARKET
MORE IN FAVOR
But the Question Remains
for the Present Un
solved.
SOME SNAGS IN TEE WAY
Harbor Commissioners, Railway
Men and Fruit-Growers
in Council.
VARYING VIEWS ARE AIRED.
Indications That It May Be Some
Time Before the Project Can
Be Realized.
The free market project seems to be
taking shape. On Monday an informal
conference took place at the rooms of the
State Board of Horticulture, which was
attended by representatives from the Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange, the Fruit-growers'
Association, the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the Board of State Harbor Com
missioners. It was there decided to bring
matters to some decisive issue at a formal
conference to be held on the day following.
Accordingly, at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning the meeting opened in the offices
of the State Board of Harbor Commission
ers. *
Among those present were members of
the Board of Harbor Commissioners, the
Chief Wharfinger, Frederick S. Stratton,
the board's attorney, B. F. Walton of Yuba
City, John Markley of Healdsburg, An
drew Reiter of San Jose, D. F. Fowler of
Fresno, Edward F. Aaams of Santa Clara
and John Merritt of Sonoma, all of the
California Fruit Exchange, and Senator
William Johnston of Courtland, \V. L.
Oberheiser of San Joaquin, I. H. Bergier of
San leandro, J. A. Filcher, of the State
Board of Trade, and J. B. Meacbam of
Petaluma, being the committee of five ap
pointed at the free market convention held
at the Chamber of Commerce on the 16th
inst., besides a number of gentlemen repre
senting various transportation agencies.
President Coinon oi the Board of Har
bor Commissioners called the meeting to
order. He said the commissioners were in
favor of the free market project.
"We will give you all that we can give."
continued Mr. Colnon. "and that is a free
space, which would ordinarily represent a
monthly rental of $ISOO. We will also pro
vide lighting facilities for the sheds and
wharves. Beyond this our powers do not
go. We have consulted the attorney of
this board in order to find exactly what we
could do. It seems that we cannot impose
any extra tolls, and what caarces are made
beyond those fixed by authority of the
State must be levied by the management
of the market."
This called forth much discussion. The
commissioners were in favor of granting
shippers of iruit the same privileges now
accorded to shippers of wheat, namely, to
allow the shipments to remain on the
premises for five days free of chaige, and
after that time to make them subject to a
small rental.- ;, .V*.,. *'.;* . '34^
John Markley, secretary of the State
Board of Examiners, and a prominent
fruit-grower of Healdsburg, asked a num
ber of questions as to the practical work
ings of the market. He expressed a fear
that a complicated system of management
and a multiplicity. of small tolls might op
erate so as to deter shippers from sending
their produce thither. He recommended
that the plan be well thought out, and its
probable workings carefully weighed be
fore any action were taken. **--*â 
Attorney Stratton, the' board's legal ad
viser, said he feared that unless the pro
ject were carefully matured, there might
be danger of litigation. He reminded the
commissioners that they were not free to
do as they pleased. Their powers in the
premises were regulated by law, and
though they might desire to give up all
control of that portion of the water front
to be devoted to the uses of the free mar
ket, the law creating the board would not
permit any such relinquishment.
Mr. Adams switched off from the legal
aspects of the case and returned to a con
sideration of the practical working meth
ods of the market. He recommended the
employment of two managers, one to com
mence work at 2 o'clock in the morning
and the other to have charge during the
forenoon and afternoon. One man, he
said, would not be able to endure the
worlc
Mr. Stratton answered that the board
would not have power to appoint and pay
a market superintendent, nor to manage a
market, both matters being beyond its
province. It might, however, appoint a
wharfinger and collector, who would have
charge of the premises. .
"But I understand the California Fruit
Exchange wants men of its own selec
tion,", interposed Mr. Colnon.
"That offers no difficulty," rejoined the
attorney, "The exchange could recom
mend men for the positions and the board
then appoint them at the exchange's
recommendation."
Captain Nelson, representing the Cali
fornia Transportation Company, said he
had been carrying fruit for forty- five years,
and thought fruit-growers could not have
a freer market than they now have at
Jackson street.
Captain Leal of the river steamer Caro
line took the same view. Both captains
said it would be impossible to make two
separate discharges of cargo in San, Fran
cisco, as the time for unloading was too
short. â  . Â .7.7.777.7: . . â i.
â¢-Well," rejoined Mr. Oberheiser, testily,
"if you can't do it somebody else can."
"But we have some interest in the mat
ter." said Captain Leal, with some warmth.
"This thing is altogether out of order,"
said Mr. Colnon, "and we are losing valu
able time. The proposition is that we
offer you either section, 4 or Lombard
street wharf, and the attorney of the board
recommends that your decision on the
matter be couched in the form of a written

"How about. Mr. Smurr's tramway
idea?" asked^lr. Markley.
"It is impracticable." answered Mr. Col
non. "We haven't money enough for its
utilization, and if we had we wouldn't
permit the streets to be ripped up for any
6uch purpose." : a .-^Â«^jgr***jji|j| | yi ÃtattÃ
-â¢Well, said Mr. Adams, "before we go
any farther it would be well for the fruit
growers to have a short talk among them
selves." r's '.' .'-. *
This was agreed to, and the office of the
State Board of Horticulture designated as
a proper place. ... Thither, accordingly, the
fruit men repaired and remained closeted
until lunch time. 3
In the afternoon the conference recon
vened, Mr. Smurr of the Southern Pacific
Company being also present. The follow
ing report from the directors of the Cali
fornia Fruit Exchange was read : .
To the Honorable Board of State Harbor Com
missionersâGentlemen: The California Fruit
Exchange respectfully represents to your hon
orable body as follows: â *-.
The river-steamer :* fruit now delivered to
Jackson-street wharf, as a matter of fact is
largely now bold on that wharf substantially
as proposed for the free market, except with
no regulation ; ana such fruit, by reason of its
convenient point of delivery and by escaping
drayage and consequent jamming, has a great
advantage over all other fruit delivered to this
City.. We respectfully submit that the produce
from all sections should be accorded equal
privileges on the water front, and that these
products should, ior that purpose, be concen
trated at the most convenient and available
point.' *.". '
It appears to us that In the assignment of
water-tront privileges the first thing to be con
sidered is the convenience of the rassenger
service. Immediately following that is the
convenient and economical delivery, to con
sumers of those perishable food products
which are delivered to the City each day, of
which family supplies are purchased day by
day. ;.:-,. , : .^_-
If this oe true, public convenience would be
best served by the establishment of the free
market immediately to the north of Jackson
street, extending so far in that direction as
may be necessary for the handling and sale of
the flowers, lruit, vegetables, poultry and fish
required for the City. Â»'..
We understand, however, that your honor
able body does not at present see its way clear
to assigning to this purpose such space at this
point as would be necessary, but propose to as
sign section 4 or pier 27. The latter, we are
advised by river men, can never be used for
this purpose by reason of its exposed position.
Section 4 could doubtless be made available
for iliat Durpose by additional pier construc
tion. ' - â¢ /f â 
We do not believe that a market on section 4
would ever attract customers who could be
served at substantially the same prices on
Jackson-street wharf or at the location of the
present commission houses onthe streets de
voted to that trade. Customers would go to
section 4 only when they could not be served
elsewhere. Ii all the produce could be con
centrated at Section 4 of course customers
would go there, as they must have the goods.
If a majority can be delivered there it would
in time attract the rest.
As stated in the resolutions of the conven
tion which referred the subject to us, we regard
it as essential to the success of the market that
it shall be the common terminal of all tr im
portation lines. We have no wish to establish
a small opposition market, and especially in a
locality less convenient than others enjoy. Un
less we can look ultimately to a general con
centration of the produce we do not think the
matter worth pursuing.
At the same time we are at present of the
opinion that it will be well to make a begin
ning on section 4, providing that arrange
ments can be made for a delivery there of a
majority of the perishable products not sold
in carload lots, with the understanding that
ways shall be constantly studied by which all
Five of the Young "Wharf Rats " Arrested for Robbery and Locked Up in the City Prison.
goods of that class shall be brought to that
market. '
We therefore accept the proposal to devote
section 4 to the free market, provided that we
shall become satisfied that a majority of the
produce not sold in carload lots will be de
livered from car or steamer to such market
without drayagc. In the prosecution of such
further inquiries Messrs. B.F.Walton, W. L.
Oberheiser end I. H. Bergier are authorized to
represent this exchange.
By order of the board of directors. .
San Francisco, Cal., April 28, 1896.
The reading of the report was followed
by much discussion.
Mr. Walton said he had heard one of
the transportation magnates say that
rather than allow his vessels to lie beside
Lombard-street wharf he would see them
sink.
To this. the Chief Wharfinger replied
that wheat was unloaded at pier 27 with
out difficulty. The pier, being unpro
tected, was of course more or less exposed
to the force of the various currents, but he
thought in the event of anoiber pier being
erected north of it it would be easy to
land cargoes there in all weathers. At the
same time, even under present conditions,
he said landings were easily effected at
Lombard street, at all times. He consid
ered that the difficulty in landing ship
ments had been unduly magnified.
Mr. Colnon seemed in favor of Lombard
street wharf.
"What we want to know is," said Mr.
Adams, '-whether the Southern Pacific
Company will deliver its freight there."
"Before the Southern Pacific Company
can engage to so enlarge its business, ob
served Mr. Smurr. " we must have better
facilities accorded us. The. free market
will be one among scores of consignees,
and it will make much extra work for us
if we are to be obliged to segregate our
cargoes and ship a part. of them by water
to Lombard street." /
"The people of the San Joaquin Valley,"
said Mr. Oberheiser. "are most' anxious
for the success of this market. We have
two opposition boat lines, and one of them
will surely transport our products whither
we desire. <If the railway company cannot
or will not accord us its aid, we must do
the best we can without it. All, we have
to do is to get to work, arid we will suc
ceed in shaping matters in accord with
our purposes." : .', 3": >-
Others spoke in a eimiliar strain. The
difficulties in the way of the undertaking
were fully recognized and the necessity of
concerted and harmonious endeavor
dwelt upon. It appeared to be the general
idea that the best course would be to make
a trial of Lombard-street wharf as a loca
tion for the market aud see how the thing
would work. Meanwhile the offer of the
Harbor Commissioners remains in abey
ance until next Thursday.
President Colnon, when spoken to on
the matter, abstained from- detailed com
ment on the affair, but could not refrain
from remarking ;
- "Weil, well, these free market people
don't seem to be very backward in asking
favors. However, our offer remains open
for a while, and perhaps they may see in
time that it is well worth their acceptance."
W. W. Stuw's Estate.
The executor's of the estate of W. W. Stow

ity were equal. â¢

"WHARF RATS"
UNDER ARREST
Police Bag a Characteristic
Gang of Young
Pests.
SIX ARE IMPLICATED.
John Lundquist, Carpenter of the
Ship Eversham Abbey,
the Victim.
V. 7 ,- .
LOSES HIS WATCH AND CHAIN.
Four of Them Deny Their Guilt, but
One Has Made a Confession to
the Police.
The police on the water front have more
trouble with thieving boys, who are
familiarly known as "wharf rats," than all
other classes of criminals.
In the daytime they prowl around the
vicinity of the wharves and steal whatever
they can lay their hands upon and at
night they frequent the gallery of a cheap
theater and then return to the wharves,
where they sleep covered with an old sail.
It is difficult for the police to find any
evidence against the boys owing to their
watchfulness and natural shrewdness.
Some of them have been sent to the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society, and after spending
some months there have been . released
and have immediately returned to their
old haunts.
Six of these boys ab^ut 5 o'clock Sunday
morning committed a robbery on Union
and Front streets, and five of them are
now in the City Prison. Their names are
Frank Marshall, 15 years of age: Daniel
McEvoy, 15; Charles Bona, 15;. Willie
Latimore, 14, and Louis Uphouse, 14. The
four first named were booked yesterday
morning for robbery and Uphouse is being
held as a material witness. The sixth,
Frank McEvoy, has not yet been arrested.
John Lundquist, . carpenter on the ship
Eversham Abbey, had taken too much
water-front whisky on Saturday night and
on his way to the vessel he fell at the cor
ner of Union and Front streets and fell
asleep. "*- 33*3 333,. â¢-;
The six boys were prowling around and
came upon the prostrate form of Lund
quist. They immediately proceeded to
"roll" him, as it is termed in police cir
cles, and the only things they got were his
watch and chain.
: Policeman Dwyer saw the boys robbing
Lundquist and , hurried to the scene. As
soon as they observed him they ran away,
with the exception of Uphouse, who was
arrested by Dwyer.
Dwyer and Policeman George Brown
were detailed on ; the case and Monday
night they arrested ; Marshall in his
father's house on Green street. A few
hours later they found McEvoy, Bond and
Latimore asleep under an old sail on Fish
erman's wharf and took them to the City
Prison. *"3:-. â -:-â * ;.,.
| Marshall is apparently the leader of the
gang and according to the police it was
he that took the watch and chain from
Lundquist. His elder brother, "Black"
Marshall, who was in the same line of
business, is now serving a six years' sen
tence is San Quentin for grand larceny.
About seven months ago he stole a box of
opium, valued >at $500, ; from an express
wagon on "Battery street. 3' 3
\Detectives Egan ana Silvey made the
arrest, and when they were searching for
him his father, who is a longshoreman,
told them that his boys were too smart to
be caught by any policemen.
Marshall, when spoken ,to yesterday,
denied any knowledge of the robbery. "I
was arrested in bed in my father's house,"
he said, "and don't know what for. I was
at home Sunday morning and know noth
ing about a ship's carpenter being robbed.
"Why. I've worked for a living in George
Tav's T tinshop on Battery street. Yes, I
know some of the other boys, but I wasn't
with them Saturday night."
. Eva, Latimore and Bora made a similar
denial, but unlike Marshall, they smiled
when they made it. Latimore ' said his
father was dead and his mother,* who lives
on Vallejo street, had tried to get work for
him, but had failed. -:'
He is an innocent looking boy with big
blue eyes. Bona : said he nad been em
ployed \in the Columbia fish market on
Ninth street. He had never gone to school.
McEvoy ? was"; surly > and did not care to
say anything. He is a hard -looking boy.
Latimore, Bond and McEvoy have served
terms in the Boys', and Girls Aid Society.
The four did not seem to bother about
their 3 arrest : arid 3 laughed " and 7 chatted
among themselves while --Marshall occa
sionally gave them a -.warning look when
they seemed inclined to talk too much.
The boy Uphouse -told a different story
from the others. "The six of us," he said,
"had been at the Alcazar and after leav
ing the theater we walked around for hours
till we saw the man lying drunk on Union
and Front streets. "Marshall shook him
and as he didn't wake up Marshall took
his watch and chain from his pockets.
"The policeman then came along, and
they all ran. I . stood round the corner,
and the policeman arrested me. I didn't
run. because I had done nothing wrong.
"I had been with the boys for about a
week. I knew McEvoy in the . Boys' and
Girls' Society, and met him on the street.
He got me to go with them. I was sent to
the society for six months, because I hap
pened to be with a boy who stole a bicycle.
"1 have been living with my married
sister on Natoma street. My father and
mother are both dead. I worked for some
time in a tobacco faetorv, but had to leave,
as the smell of the tobacco made me sick.
"We always went at night to the the
ater, and slept on the wharves. I didn't
like the life, and would be glad to get
something to do."
Uphouse is a delicate-looking boy, and
more intelligent than the others. He
will be used as a witness by the prosecution.
COLONEL BARNES IS DEAD.

THAT BROWNING BABY
The Police Not Quite Sure That
Flynn Is the Mur- 3'
derer.
CONTRADICTORY STATEMENTS
T. J. Clyne Claims Mrs. Samuel Shane
Knew Flynn Well Prior to
the Killing.
It is quite likely the police authorities
would, if they could, v. erase .'the charge of
murder recently booked against the name
of J. T. Flynn, pending further develop
ments. It is not that Flynn looks less
guilty at this time than he did a few days
ago, but that a cloud of suspicion has
risen over others who may be the princi
pals or accessories in the murder of little
baby Browning.
The detectives have been going over the
testimony given at the Coroner's inquest,
and, in the statements made by the Benja
min lad, son of the landlady at 130"^ Ninth
street, where Mrs. Browning lives, they
find that another man besides Flynn was
admitted to the house on the day the baby
was carried away in a valise and thrown
into an empty lot.
The Benjamin boy's description of the
unknown man has been closely followed
and applied in the way of comparison to
every male individual who is known, to
have* called on Mrs. Browning at her room
within the recollection of her successive
landladies.
In one case only does the description fit,
and young Benjamin will be brought into
the presence of Edward Dellix to-day to
see if he can be identified as the missing
man. -333
Dellix is a hackman, whose stand is at
the gore of Market and O'Farrell streets.
He has been acquainted with Mrs. Brown
ing for nearly fifteen years, and was a
constant visitor at her apartments in Mrs.
Woods' lodging-house at 1135 Mission
street, where the lady lived prior to her
removal some little time ago to Ninth
street.
Dellix lives in rooms on Mission street,
but after the arduous duties of his busi
ness he generally makes his bed and takes
his daily rest in a hay-bunker at the Olym
pic Club stables, where he cares for his
team. It was there he was found yester
day by a Call representative, and where,
his hand on his heart, he avowed the
greatest regard for Mrs. Browning, in the
Platonic sense already developed by J. T.
Flynn, who is in jail.
Dellix is sure that he was not in the
Browning residence on the 13th of this
month, when the little baby was murdered,
but, strange to say, while his name was
never mentioned as the man most sought
for, he drew himself up with considerable
hauteur when criticizing young Benja
min's testimony before the Coroner's
jury. .777-7"
"I was surprised, he said, "that the lad
should have said I was in that house on
thel3th." 77;::
"Did he say you were there?"
"Well, he said," stammeringâ "he said
a man who answers my description was
there; that's enough."
Dellix denies all knowledge of Mrs.
Browning's delicate condition. He believed
her statement that she was simply suffer
ing from a pain in the side. Now that the
child has been born and killed he, like
Mrs. Shane, places the murder at the door
of J. T. Flynn. .
: The investigation instituted by the au
thorities in regard to the conflicting state
ments made by Mrs. Shane, the sister of
Mrs. Browning, is developing rapidly.
That little lady, who acknowledged
shutting the baby up in a bureau drawer
immediately after its birth, is impulsive
to say the least, and on that ground, per
HEW TO-DAY.

Interview With Prominent Druggists
Upon Two Notable Successesâ Pub-
lic Warned Against imitations.
There has of late been a kind of moral wave
showing its influence among our male popula-
tion. Many men bave realized that they were
smoking and tobacco-spitting their lives away,
and they have preferred a condition of manly
vigor and robust health. Skinny men have
quit smoking vile cigars; drieo-up nicotine-
soaks have fired their pipes; hardened old
chaws have suit out their quids, and pallid
cigarette-suckers have thrown away the deadly
colli tack. You can tell them by the new
brightness in their eyes, the new elasticity in
their step, the fine color in their faces and the
visible increase in their weight, not to speak of
a new cheerfulness of disposition which tells
that they are enjoying the good things of life,
and if you ask one of them what did it, he
always says: "It is No-To-Bac, and I got it at
Joy's Baldwin Pharmacy, corner of Powell and
Market streets." . â 
An essential in every community is the reli-
able drugstore, where nothing is sold that is
not vouched for; where no fatal mistakes are
â¢made. Such a one is the well-known estab-
lishment mentioned aboveâ a thoroughly reli-
able drugstore. The best prescription in. the
world is not of benefit unless properly com-
pounded. Every day we read in the paper
warning against buying from those who sub-
stitute fakes and . imitations for standard
preparations because it pays a larger profit.
Accuracy, honesty, wide-awake attention
being the foundation of the success in Joy's
Pharmacy, the manager was asked about the
remarkable boom in the sale of No-To-Bac. *
"My boy," he said to the reporter, " the suc-
cess of a preparation lies in what it does, not
what it's advertised to do. Merit counts,
nothing else. You can advertise from now till
doomsday and if the article does not possess
merit it will not achieve success. That is why
No-To-Bac with comparatively little advertis-
ing has had so remarkable a sale. It cures the
tobacco-habit and restores the vital functions.
One man tries it and his success causes | others
to likewise. t" Just to show you how . much
faith can be placed in No-To-Bac's merit, I
need only mention that the makers, the Ster-
ling Remedy Co., Chicago, Montreal and New
York, authorize us and every other druggist
to sell their preparations under absolute guar-
antee to cure, or refund the purchase money.
They know that any honest man who honestly
uses No-To-Bac according to directions will be
cured." / . â  'â Â-â '.,'-:
.' "You spoke, of preparations," said the re-
porter. " What else do they make ?" .
: " Cascarets, Candy Cathartic, the ideal lax-
ative, an elegant preparation, pleasant to eat,
never fail to act, never grip nor gripe, and enre
constipation, no matter how often other remi-
dies have failed.' Here's a box; try a Cascaret
to-night. It Is a pleasure to handle such goods,
because ; they , advertise ' themselves through
merit, and bring big business with them. It
will certainly be to your interest to write the
Sterling Remedy Co 3 They will take pleasure
in sending you their famous booklets and free

haps, her declarations may be reconciled.
When confronted with Flynn, the pris
oner charged with murder, in the office of
Captain Lees, she opened wide her black
eyes and stared the man full in the face
saying: ""â *''-'.
"I never saw him before."
In view of the fact that Flynn himself
declares that Mrs. Shane is fabricating on
this score; that Mrs. Browning and her
little daughter also know that Flynn and
Mrs. Shane are acquainted, and that
Thomas J. Clyne of the New England Life
Insurance Company was present when Mr.
Flynn was presented to Mrs. Shane by
Mrs. Browning in the latter's rooms, some
time before the present scandal cropped
up, Mrs. Shane's disclaimer of the ac
quaintanceship of Mr. Flynn is regarded
as very strange by the police, who are in
vestigating it.
Mr. Clyne was seen at his office at the
Mills building yesterday regarding his
connection with the Brownings.
'.'I have known Mrs. Browning and Mrs.
Shane for some time, probably a year or
more. From the judgment I had form ed
they were quite proper people, and the re
cent disclosures in tbe newspapers have
astonished me much.
. "My judgment of these ladies, 1 based
on the very sharp lookout they kept on
Mrs. Browning's daughter, Tessie, whose
acquaintance I made at the skating rink.
I called quite frequently on that young
lady, and as often as I could we would
either go to one place of amusement or
another. : 3-*"3v
"I cannot exactly settle the date when,
in my presence and that of her daughter,
Mrs. Browning introduced Flynn to Mrs.
Shane. It was some weeks, however, be
fore this affair occurred, and the two were
well acquainted when they met again a
few days ago in Captain Lees' office.
"There is * one* thing I remember,
though, and that is, Mrs. Shane may not
have known Flynn by that name, as Mrs.
Browning, to our utter amazement, intro
duced him as Mr. Jones. But his facial
expression and general appearance must
have made her remember him, whether as
Jones or Flynn.
"When Tessie and I heard Flynn intro
duced as Jones we looked at each other,
and on our way to the theater that night
we commented upon it without being able
to solve its reason."

SUNSET CLUB JOINS IN
The Question .of Reduced r Car
,3 Fares Fully Discussed hy
Its Champions.
The Federation of Clubs to Be Held in
B'nai Brith Hall in the
Near Future.
. A special meeting of the members of the
southern quarter, Ninth avenue and H
street, assembled last night to discuss the
2^-cent fare, as also to send delegates to
represent the club at the proposed Federa
tion of Clubs.
Richard Keller, president of the Sunset
Improvement Club, invited George R.
Fletcher, president of the Point Lobos Im
provement Club, to give his views on the
reduction of car fares. Mr. Fletcher said:
"I am not fighting the railroad because
it is a corporation, but I am fighting for
what I consider the people's rights against
a corporation that carries things pretty
much its own way."
John Conklin was not sure how the pro
posed reduction would work in view of the
complicated system of transfers.
Charles Cushman was in favor of Mr.
Fletcher's proposed reduction, but was'
not quite clear on the transfer system.
William Jones was of a similar opinion.
Herman Morris wanted things left
alone. He was satisfied as it was at
present.
T. F. Taylor suggested leaving the whole
subject to the Federation of Clubs about
to meet.
J. J. Walsh, who was at one time an
employe of the railroad company, favored
high fares, v high wages, high taxes and
everything high.
On motion of William QuigJey, the
president was instructed to send five dele
gates to the meeting of the Federation of
Clubs.
A vote of thanks was tendered to Mr.
Fletcher for his attendance and the intelli
gent manner in which he had explained
his reasons for advocating a redaction in
carfares. 7. 7

TROUBLE AT PRESIDIO.
Colonel Young Went His Rounds
on the Wheel and Met
General Graham.
HE RIDES HIS HORSE NOW.
The Question Now Agitates the Post,
What Place Has the Bicycle
in the Army?
A nice question has arisen at the Pre
sidio army post, which, while settled on
the principle that might makes right as
prevails in the idea of military discipline
is yet far from bein-r settled in the ethical
considerations of resident officers.
This peculiar point does not appear in
the time-honored manuals of tactics, etc.,
or in the articles of war. So, what are the
officers to do?
What the bloomer has been in the ad
vancement of the new woman that is, as
a subject of general and tireless debate
this question is to military ethics. Al
though on the very face of it nothing
could be more simple. It is:
"What place has the bicycle in the
army?"
To be sure, the wheel has forced itself
upon men of arms and demanded recog
nition as a valuable adjunct to the gen
eral military scheme of doin g things.
Beyond that, however, there are grave
doubts as to the proper place of the wheel
in the army. Even officers of high rank
and consequently elevated in authority
cannot agree upon the knotty problem.
At the Presidio there has arisen a differ
ence of opinion on the question, ' and the
whole post is split into two factions
thereby.
As the general in command of the post
has set his face against the popular wheel,
opposition to his views is decidedly timid.
Indeed, as the story goes round among
the officers and enlisted men, the bicycle
is virtually tabooed within the Presidio
reservation. The trouble came about in
an unlooked-for way.
Colonel Young, who has command of
the Fourth Cavalry, stationed at the Pre
sidio, is a votary of the bike. To such an
extent did his new fancy lead him, the
sleek and spirited steed he rides in the
field was consigned to hours of meditation
in the stable .and the tender mercies of a
groom for exercise. Meanwhile the colonel
flitted through the beautiful avenues and
picturesque drives of the reservation. He
even forsook his horse to go his ''rounds"
on the wheel. Now this created no par- j
ticular comment among the staff and line
officers, for Colonel Young was voted a
good fellow, and his comrades saw no
breach of etiquette in a cavalry officer
taking to the wheel. All that remained in
the world at the end of this iconoclast cen
tury of the romantic knight of the olden
time was gone. In his place sat the
stooped cyclist on his spider wheel.
Only the other day Colonel Young was
going his rounds on the wheel when at a
turn in the avenue he rode full up to Gen
eral Graham. The general has his own
opinion of the colonel," as is well known,
and the colonel has his own opinion of
the general. Whatever bearing that may
have upon the matter is another story.
Anyhow General Graham appeared hor
rified at the sight of a cavalry colonel
flying through the sentries and along the
lines on a bicycle. The general's ideal
was apparently higher than that of his
comrade, though he is but a colonel of the
Fifth Artillery, being a general by brevet.
"Halt!" he commanded.
The colonel's gloved hand flashed from
the handle-bar to his cap, and an instant
later he was standing beside his wheel fac
ing the commanding officer.
What passed between the two colonels
is reserved for gossip in the officers' quart
ers, but some of it found its way to the can
teen. .It must have been a terrible ex
change of angry words, for Colonel Young
was ordered to take his wheel to his quart
ers and never again appear on duty as a
cyclist. The merits or demerits, of . the
order are agitating the high circles of the
post, and has almost brought about a war.
between cavalrymen and artillerymen in
the barracks.
Colonel Young has taken to his hand
some horse again, but the two high offi
cers never speak as they pass by. Their
military salutes are examples of iciest mili
tary etiquette.
SAYS SHE WAS MISTAKEN.
Mn, tillie Wood, Sister of Alice Jones,
Makes Strong Denial.
Mrs. Lillie Wood, the sister of the young
girl, Alice Jones, who attempted to com
mit suicide early Monday morning by
jumping into tne ocean, is incensed that
she should have been referred to as a
"woman who had gone astray." Accord
ing to her story, it seems that the excited
young sister told a good many things
which were not true.
"There is absolutely no truth whatever,"
she said, "in the statement made by Alice,
in which Bessieâ she is the next oldest
sister, and myself made to appear as
young women of bad character. The only
thing that can be said against me is that I
married seven years ago and at the end of
twelve months was forced to leave my hus
band because he treated me cruelly.
Some other women have had to do the
same thing.
"I am janitress of the Ocean House
School, and anything of this kind natur
ally hurts me. Kittie, the other sister
mentioned, has worked for ' the . Electric
Laundry for the last four years. â¢ She comes
home every Saturday night, remaining
until Monday morning. We . have two
brothers in the City, Howard and Harry
Jones. ""* The former has been living with
us right along. I can't imagine why Alice
said such cruel things, for there is not a
word of truth in anything she said. Bes
sie, the youngest sister, lives with us also.
She will graduate this year."
Kittie Jones called on her sister at the
Training Home yesterday morning. From
all accounts the meeting was not a pleas
ant ; one. * Alice, \ the young would-be sui
cide, will for, the present remain at the
home. PÂ£__i-_n^nÃHÃÃÃS_iÃ9S_i

ARE CORSETS BARBAROUS?
Mrs. Mabel Jenness Venter
Absolutely Interdicts ;
3 Their Use./
AN INTERESTING DISQUISITION.
" What Holds Me Straight? My Bones,
of Course! That Is -What They
Were Made For."
â ;â - Â ,'-7.7.. â 
"As a correct carriage is the basis of all
physical perfection, I shall begin my lec
ture this afternoon by describing a correct
method of carrying the body."
Such were the introductory words .of
Mrs. Mabel Jenness Venter in her lecture
on "Artistic Dress and the Vulgarisms We
See in Society," delivered at the Columbia
Theater yesterday. The lady ; had just
made her entry upon the stage in a morn
ing dress, and waited for the ripple of ap
proval that disturbed the calm of her
feminine audience to subside ere she spoke.
"Now," she continued, "the method of
standing with the spine stiffened is not
only detrimental to the health, but it is
undignified, uncomfortable and ungrace
ful. The proper method is to stand with
the weight upon the ball of the foot and
the chest well expanded. This throws the
body into a natural position, but it is not
so easy as it looks."
The next point discussed by the lecturer
was the art of walking, for she classed it as
such. In illustrating the improper ways
of walking the lady proved so thorough a
mimic that the audience was kept con
stantly convulsed.
"There, Georgie, look there," whispered
a well-dressed lady in the audience to her
daughter, "that is the very manner of
jumping along that 1 had such a time of
(breaking you.''
"Well," answered the daughter, indig
nantly, as she became aware that* several
persons in the circumjacent region had
Deen moved to mirth by her mother's ex
cited tone, "I don't walk that way any
longer."
"Don't go ambling along with your
shoulders tied up in a bowknot or your
body as stiff as a pole, with the arms held
rigidly at the sides," said Mrs. Venter;
"let the arms swing loosely at the sides
and in harmony with th-e. motion of the
body. You see" tripping lightly across
the stage â "this does not jar your brain
every time you put your feet down, as
happens when you walk upon your heels."
The lady then stated that so far as ex
ternal appearances go a lady should not
have any shoulder-blades. And *. she
added that thin women would do some
thing migntily conducive to their peace of
mind. if they would learn-to walk iv a
proper and graceful manner, thus avoid
ing the awkward protuberance of the
shoulder-blades that accompanies an in
correct carriage. 3*3 -.-..-
--"Now," she continued, "let me talk to
you a little while on tbe subject of sitting
gracefully. In this a great 'deal ' depends
on the time, the place and | the j humor of
the speaker; but always avoid angularity.
In bending forward, do so from the hips;
most women do so from the shoulders.
And pay some attention to the place where
you happen to be. Do you really know"
this with a slight arching of the brows and
the faintest perceptible suspicion of sar
casm in her voice â I .have seen
women sitting in the parlors of an hotel
with one leg carelessly thrown over the
other in a way that exposed their draper
ies who would have been utterly shocked
at the sight of a woman in a rainy-day
dress?" * - .*- 7 .7.
", 'She next turned her attention to show
ing some "of the improper ways people
have of ascending and descending stairs.
The way , schoolgirls have of bouncing
down a stairway was described as one of
the most rash practices that are in vogue
among the thoughtless.
"I don't want any of you to think I take
you for schoolgirls," she added, "but
"many of you may have girls that do this
very thing, and my advice to you is to get
them to stop it at once."
The lady retired from _ the stage at this
juncture, and when she reappeared was
robed in a natty street dress. All through
the rest of her lecture she changed her ap
parel to i suit the subject on which she
happened to be discoursing, | appearing
successively in a home dinner dress, an
afternoon reception dress, an evening and
a rainy day dress. * ;3 \77<
"Let me say right here," she remarked,
twisting herself lithely in the , region of
the waist, "I have never worn a corset in
my life. . I deem it barbarous. A natural
waist is a large waist, and any woman
ought to have sense enough to know that
when she compresses her vital organs she
is slowly committing suicide." .
* "Well, then," queried one of her audi
tors, "what keeps you so straight?"
"My bones,'** was the laughing answer.
"That's what they were made for, isn't
it?" â ;
The remainder of the lecture was de
voted largely to a discussion of the utility
and modesty of the rainy day dress,
which comes down to the ankles and un
derneath which are ' worn bloomers and
leggings. - -' â ' â â * â  â¢â --
GENERAL STRIKE AHEAD
The Building Trades Unions
Organizing for Decisive
Action.
Providing an Emergency Fund for
Men Who May Be Ordered
Out on Strike.
That the unions of the building trades
are preparing to take radical steps to en
force â¢ a strict observance of ) the working
card system and union rules in general, is
apparent from certain movements now on
foot. Last November, the carpenters'
unions decided to demand $3 a day mini
mum as the rate of wages, but the enforce
ment of the edict was : very slack owing to
hard times, little work' and a flooded labor
market. It was also decided to put the
Building Trades Council's working card
into effect on April 1, and insist \ that no
union work m an .;' in the ' affiliated * unions â¢
should work on a job with non-union men.
To some extent the card has been a suc
cess, but ; not wholly. This has caused
many union men to lose confidence in the
whole scheme, and to not live up to union
rules with reference to working with non
union men. â¢
This ; apathy â ; has been noticed by the
leaders,', who are about to resort to j radical
measures to uphold the standing and dig
nity of organized labor. _ ' 3 333
As an evidence of this, ; measures have
been 3 taken -which ' look very much like
providing : for â â¢' a bitter and determined
strike if necessary. ' ; *. ;;.
13 All of the next union gatherings will be
special meetings for the purpose of decid
ing upon the ; amount lof $ a per capita tax
to be levied upon 3 all f members who have
employment;. This tax will be ; to ; form v a
strike relief fund. ; This fund is only to be
drawn upon for the maintenance of union
men who have been ordered out : on strike.
In this way only. can a strike be carried to
a successful issue, for the union cannot de
pend upon the \ loyalty of t union strikers
whose families are in want. V-*'s-:. , t
-".* At the last meeting of ;. Carpenters' ''â . and
Joiners' Union "483 is was ; proposed that
each man having employment be assessed
15 cents a week, and at the special meeting
this proposition i will be i discussed. This
union's delegates to the council will, how
ever, advocate that the tax be 50 cents * a
week. 3 {Similar action will be taken by the
other twelve or Â« fifteen unions affiliated
with the council. *â â¢-.* .::-.â â 
:-*lt is not unlikely that the first break in
the shape of trouble will be ' made on * or
about May 1 and be started ; by the car
penters. * 33
Two months ago these unions sent noti
fications to all ; contractors that â¢on and
after May 1 $3 a day would be the mini
mum rate of wages and for the contract
ors to remember this in figuring upon all
future contracts. Resolutions recently
passed show that the | carpenters are deter
mined to stand by their colors.
Still another incident points to decided
measures. At least two-thirds of the
unions have instructed their delegates to
the Building Trades Council to demand
that the working-card be enforced by the
business agents and that no exceptions be
made in favor of any contractor or job.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
Barbers' Associations to Amalga
mateâThe Italian Car
penters.
The Italian and French Union of Car
penters -and Joiners received its char
ter last evening from the United Brother
hood of America. District Organizer C. F.
Schadt installed 3 the following officers:
President, Joseph Maccono; vice-presi
dent, E. Picasso treasurer, G. B. Pine;
recording ' secretary, J. Cavallo; financial
secretary, V. Maggio ; conductor, F. Bar
gon; warden, F. Postiglione. - 333-
After the installation the new union and
many representatives of the other carpen
ters' unions enjoyed a banquet in an ad
joining hall. -â¢--*-'.-,. -â¢< i- :
In. all probability the three barbers'
unions of this City will amalgamate into
one large union. This step is under con
sideration, and the purpose is to be able
to combat their * common enemies with
more effect than each union could by
itself. 3 777.7.; ....-â 'â 
At the meeting of the Barbers' Associa
tion of California last evening committees
from the Barbers' Association of San Fran
cisco and the Barbers' Protective Associa
tion met and discussed the proposition.
The matter of closing Sundays, on week
day evenings and similar subjects were
discussed. Efforts will be made to have
the Supervisors ' pass an ordinance com
pelling barber- shops to be closed at 12
o'clock on Sundays. . -.';.: ~ -Â3-" -\ ' J '
Mines and
Mining
The Argonaut ; mine, Jackson, the shaft
of which is 1220 feet deep and still going
down, is the only one in Amador County
that was ever sunk .so deep without sta
tions, crosscuts or drifts. . It is not yet
determined when they will begin to cut a
station.
Most of the sulphurets obtained from
the mines in, Amador County are now
being shipped to the Selby Smelting
Works, where they are being treated. for
$11 a ton. ... -
The mines around Murphys, Calaveras
County, would do much better if a good
water supply could be assured. .
The Johnnie mine, Nye County, Nevada,
is now giving employment to fifty men.
This is the mine which is supposed to be
the old lost Breyf ogle property.
The Lowry gravel property near Pine
Grove, Amador County, is under bond to
A. Mackintosh and is being tested.
The increased capitalization of the Good
Hope mine, Jackson, Amador County, will
furnish the money to commence the work
of reopening the mine.
Cinnabar ore is reported as having been'
discovered by L. J. Cook on a spur of the
Coast Range, about forty miles south of
Winnemucca, Nev.
Recent mining sales in Trinity County
will make lively times this summer. at
Lewiston and Lowden Ranch.
The group of ' mines located on October
last at Macedonia, San Bernardino County,
have made a poor showing since develop
ment work was commenced. The camp,
which is twenty-eight miles from Fenner,
on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, was
worked for copper as far back as 1861, but
afterward abandoned. -;..- The new ledges are
being worked for silver and gold.
".' The mill of the Golden Cross mine at
Hedges, San Diego, is running to full ca
pacity and crushing 300 tons of ore per
clay, which -is probably more than any
other mill in the State is doing.
It is reported that good miners are scarce
in the mines at Alamo, Lower California,
where considerable work is now going on.
A number of mining sales have recently
been made in the Piacho mining district,
San Diego County.
North :of Murphys, , Calaveras County,'
are a number of mines awaiting the ad
vent of capital. The whole region around
that town would be greatly benefited by
an electric plant to ' supply power to the
mines.
The machinery for the ; new mill of the
Red -* Banks mines, Mariposa County,; is
now being made in this City. -
: The Holland r mine, about â  two miles

two years for $30,000. . *
The recent annual 'â  assessment work at
the Eagle Borax Marsh, Death Valley,
Inyo County, has .. shown up very large
deposits of borate of lime. V :
; The recent gold strikes ;at Randsburg,
Kern County, give the greatest encourage

About 200 men are now at work there. ;,..
3 It is thought that water can â be found
almost anywhere by sinking on the great
waste between Toler and Randsburg, Kern
County. The greatest need of that whole
region seems to be water.
The miners who have gone ;to West
Australia are suffering from intense heat
and lack of water. Those who have gone
to Alaska} are suffering from intense cold
and too much ice. Still, these things will
not deter others from going ' to the same
places, when there is gold in sight. â¢:.., 1

The Slocan Star mine, 8.C., has made a
contract with the Canadian Pacific to take
16,000 * tons -. of < ore ' and concentrates this
summer to the smelters at \ Omaha. The
ore is to be loaded on the cars at Sandow,

an undeveloped mine. .
3- It is expected that ; there will be greater
activity this : summer Â£ around â  tne old
camp of Florence, Idaho, than has been
the case for years.
It |is expected that there will be a big
movement of prospectors and mining men
this spring into the Lardo and Duncan
River countries, 30 miles east of Ratio, B.
C. :; There is too much snow for prospect
in just a t present. 3
The Slocan country, British Columbia,
is said to be a pretty good one for a poor
man, as many of the mines pay from the
grass roots. : .
-Advices from Ainsworth, B. C, say there
is some talk of a large smelter being built
by American capitalists on Cedar Creek to
smelt the ore from the many claims which
have ore on the dumps waiting for some
plant of this kind to start.
The mines at Cat Creek, Nev., are
said to be looking very well and consider
able ore is ready for shipment to the mills.
The Spragg & Martin mill in Mason

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature, 'the
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pre; sure is high in the interloi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vlcinitv of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California" coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
Weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

fluence. In the late trailing business picked up,
but tne Increase was at the expense of values.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO,- 111., April 28.â wheat market
lacked energy and vivacity to-day. Through the
greater part of the session prices were confined
within a quarter of a cent range, the absence of
anything like Importance in the trade being very
marked. The influences ' controlling the feeling
and sentiment were' principally the -Liverpool
cables, which were lower; the weather, which was
all that could be aeslred for winter wheat and the
Northwestern receipts, which were large. Outside
orders were prominent by their absence and local
operators were disposed to await delivery day.
May 1, before attempting more than light scalping
business. The. Northwestern arrivals were 642
cars, against 320 last Tuesday and 540 a year ago.
Chicago received 26 cars and 70,798 bushels were
withdrawn ' from store. Export clearances were
fair at 278, bushels. Paris closing cables
quoted 6 centimes; decline for. flour futures, with

CORNâ With wheat in a neglected state It was
difficult to conceive of activity in corn. The same
dull feeling permeated this market, and prices
were almost stationary. The opening was easy In
sympathy with wheat and on large receipts â 403
cars. Upon a slight rally taking place in wheat
there was also a moderate recovery In corn. Liver- |
pool cables were quiet. Withdrawals from store
amounted to 164,320 bushels. Export clearances
amounted to 421,636 bushels. Bradstreet's re
ported a decrease In available stocks of 1,403,000
bushels. July corn opened a: 30% c, sold at 30%@
30*'.4C, closing at 303/gC, 8 c under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 205 cars.
OATSâ No motive for activity or strength devel
oped in oats, and, following the conclusions of the
other grains, prices were easy. Trade was dull
and inactive. Receipts were 454 cars, and 66,1 25
bushels were taken from store. Bradstreet's gave
an Increase in stocks of 442,000 bushels. July
oats closed %@%c lower. Estimated receipts for

weak-, as evidenced by the recent decline in sundry

COFFEEâ E. Blckford's circular says: "The
interest of the trade is still mostly centered in Sal
vadors. which have sold freely on the. basis of
3 6-*4 c for good unwashed, the demand being suffi
cient to pra-'ttcally absorb all offerings. No actual
advance is quotable but the market is buoyant and
healthy. Washed Salvadors. to the contrary, re
main neglected, although perhaps relatively
cheaper than any other variety. Of other kinds
there Is not much to be said, business having been
rather slow. Prime and fancy Guatemalas are be
coming scarce at 111 unusually early time, and the
outside quotations given for. these have been
readily. obtainable for desirable styles. The over
land demand continues good. To-day's stock is

LEATHERâ The Eastern -markets are thus re
flected by the Shoe and Leather Review: '"Under"
the stimulus of the fine spring weather there is a
stronger feeling in all the Leather markets. The
United States Leather Company and other buyers
have bought Hides freely during the last few days.
In our mid-week review . we noted sales of about
18,000 Hides, and perhaps 50,000 have been sold
since. These figures, with 10.000 to 20,000 sold at
Kansas City, make a little short of 100,000 j Hides
disposed of this week. The big Leather company
is buying Hides freely, and > while a good deal of
secrecy and mystery are thrown around the trades
made, In striking contrast to the brass-band meth
ods that were adopted a year ago, the fact remains
that the company has its dragnet out and is gath

90S Broadway, April 28. J
The executive committee of the Fabiola
fete completed their programme this
morning, and a floral fete, decorated pa
rade and interesting bicycle races are as
sured that will eclipse the fiestas recently
held in the southern part of the State.
Â» There are over eighty entries in the
wheel races, and the large number neces
sitates the running off of the trial heats
early in the day. They will therefore be
commenced at 10:30 o'clock and it is ex
pected they will be completed by noon.
A fine band will be present at the park,
and the bicycle race will evidently be one
of the features of the day.
At noon there will be a recess for lunch,
and at 12:30 the great donkey race will be
run. Walter Hackett has full charge of
the burro race, and on Thursday afternoon
he will go to Marin County and bring over
twelve burros that would not break away
from each other if prodded with red-hot
irons. "Walter is charged with the job of
making the pace and he has the entries in
his pocket-book, and he has promised not
to make them public till they are weighed
in.
At 1 p. m. the floral parade will com
mence. There are several entries since
the last published list, and it is now cer
tain that the pageant will greatly eclipse
that of last year.
Avery desirable arrangement has been
made in regard to the decorated wheel
parade. When the wheelmen succeed the
carriages they meet with great incon
venience on account of the frequent stop
pages, and are unable to show off to the
best advantage. On Mayday the decorated
. wheel parade will commence at 3 o'clock,
and some of the most unique designs in
decorated "vheels will oe seen. There will
canopies built on wheels and arches of
flowers and platforms built on wheels, on
which will be floats, and some of the wheel
men have promised to do something that
as vet exists only in their brains.
The Burlineame steeplechase will be run
off at 3:30. Eleven trained ponies have
been brought to the track and some of the
best-known members will enter the com
petition. There will be half a dozen
hurdles to jump and the crack riders of
the club will show how it is done at the
country club. The members of the club
i will come over with their tally-ho coaches
ami prepare for the race in the -jockeys'
quarters. -â¢; -'. yy.7.
The finals of the bicycle races will be run
off at 4 o'clock and the National circuit
wiil be opened.
Very elaborate preparations have been
made to arouse enthusiasm for the fete.
On Wednesday a band will go out with
the decorated car and cover Berkeley, Ala
meda and Elmhurst and at midday reach
Haywards. It will give concerts en route,
and a representative of the fete will be on
hand to sell tickets. It will then go
around the City. In the evening there
will be the lantern parade of decorated
wheels.
All day Thursday the decorated car and
band will tour the City and give concerts.
The Exempt Firemen will land at the
foot of Broadway pier, San Francisco, at
The Loving-Cup Prize for the Winner
of the Burlingame Hurdle Race at
the Fete.
7 o'clock and will have a short parade. At
2:30 the men will leave the grounds and
proceed to the residence of ex-Mayor E.
H. Pardee, who is confined to his home by
illness, and serenade him. From there
they go to the residence of Fred M. Camp
bell for the purposes set forth in the fol
lowing letter:
Dear Sir: It is our desire to recall old times
by tendering to the ex-Mayors and ex-City

teer days of the old lire department a sere
nade on the afternoon of that day at 3 o'clock,
at the residence of the Hon. Fred.M. Campbell,
1203 Webster street. There are only five ex-
Mayors living to-day, and . only 17 ex-City
Councllmen. This number will never grow
larger and will grow less as the years pass
along.' We want to keep up this custom each
year, and we hope you will make an effort to

An Old Wharf.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 28.â City
Council passed a resolution to the effect
".hat the License Inspector be and is
hereby directed to collect forthwith licenses
from September 30, 1893. to date,, from
persons owning, controlling or conducting
the private wharf east of Webster 'street
and south of Harrison street produced."
* The wharf referred to was that built Ibv
J. L. Davie, but was transferred to otbe'r
parlies some time ago. License Inspector

Oriison Whipple Kemoved.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 28.â Some sur
prise was caused in 'political circles to
night when it became known that Orrison
Whipple, who has been for main' years
deputy "in the County Treasurer's office,
had been removed. Treasurer Sanford says
that [here is no political significance at
tached to the change, but as Whipple is a
Republican and Sanford a Populist it is at
tributed to the clamor of 'the Populists for
recognition. Mr. Sanford said to-night
that he did not know whom he would ap
point, but said it would not be his wife.
Board of Works Worked Up.
OAKLAND, Cal, April 28.â The Board,
of Works held a stormy meeting to-night
and the Mayor openly charged his two
colleagues with voting away public money
needlessly for the purpose of creating a
deficit. The trouble arose over the pur
chase of a chemical engine. There was a
very excited exchange of opinions and a
police officer stood at the door, but City
Engineer Wilson and City Attorney Peir
sol listened till the Mayor was through
and then adjourned. Owing to the strained
feeling the usual farce of trying to elect a
chairman to succeed the Mayor was not
performed.
Will It Work '!
OAKLAND. Cal., April 28.â Milk In
spector Pierce is ..wondering if the local
milkmen have been working a scheme
â¢whereby their milk will stand his test and
at the same time water their milk. Re
cently a milkman's team ran away, scat
tering milkcans all along the street. Sev
eral cans retained their covers, and by
standers in gathering them up opened
several. One was found to contain water.
Now the question is, Is the water turned in
as it is being taken to the door?

of many costly presents from friends.
They left on the southern overland train at
5:30 for the East, expecting to be gone
until the latter part of June. They will

EMMA PROPOSED.
Now Her Husband Is in Jail. Charged
"With Perjury.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 28.â The officers
brought E. Marinell to the City Prison
this morning, and, in the Police Court he
pleaded not guilty and had the case con
tinued so that he could have an attorney.
He is charged with perjury by his wife's
sister, in swearing that she was over 18 In
securing a marriage license. He is a
hunchback, and is not prepossessing. In
speaking of the matter the messenger-boy
said :
"My wife proposed to me and then she
did tbe swearing at the County Clerk's
office. I guess her sister, though, does not
know all of the facts in the case or she
would have insisted on our immediate
union instead of complaining; for you see
Emma and I were very intimate, to an ex
tent that marriage was necessary to pre
serve her good name. The girl's mother is
dead and their father don't seem to care if
Emma is my wife. 1 told him a week ago
of our marriace, and he only said, 'To hâ
with the girl, I don't care.'
"I don't see what Helen means." he
continued, meditatively. "I have always
been good to her and the family. I j:ot
their brother a job as messenger with me,
and both he and Helen seemed to encour
age my going with Emma. Whenever
she and I would have a quarrel they would
try to make us friends again. I remember
once when we did not speak that Helen
took a quarter and Emma and I guessed
the date, with the understanding that the
one who came farthest from it should
speak first. From things like these I
thought she wanted us to marry.
"What kind of a girl is Helen? Oh, she
is one of these high-rollers who want to be
society. When*, my wife was working at
one place for a year Helen took all of her
wages to buy clothes for herself and the
woman Emma worked for had to buy her
a dress to keep her looking decent. Helen
is right in line, goes to all of the parties
and drinks everything in sight. I know
of two occasions wnen they had to take
her home from swell parties in Frisco
because she got so drunk, but she can't
separate my wife and me."
THE NEXT MOVE.
Primary Republicans Will Appeal to
the State Central Committee. â¢
OAKLAND, Cal., April 28.â The Re
publican delegates to the State Conven
tion selected by the primary convention
are losing no opportunity to press their
claim for : recognition. At a meeting of
the delegates last evening it was decided
that a delegation should attend the meet
ing of the State Central Committee to
morrow (Wednesday) afternoon and again
present their claim to seats in the State
and Congressional District conventions.
It is anticipated that such action may
brine on the chief contest for recognition
in the committee in advance of the con
ventions. ; Whether they are successful or
not, it is known that they will select a
delegate, to St." Louis , and carry the con
test to the National Convention. An Il
linois delegation was seated under similar j
circumstances 'â¢ in 1880, and \ they believe j
the precedent would be followed for them. j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 29. 1896.
EVOLUTION OF A CHEVRON
Oakland's Chief of Police Wants
Emblems of Rank for
His Men.
THE MAYOR OBJECTS TO IT.
Does Not Wish to See the Finest
Look Like Dollsâ -Peirsol Is
Conservative.
Oakland Office San Francisco -Call,)
â¢908 Broadway, April 28. f
Chief of Police Lloyd is positive. So is
Mayor Davie. The Police Commissioners
are in doubt.
The Chief has reached the conclusion
that the Oakland bobby is altogether too
plain an individual. He does not refer to
his features, for Sergeant Hodgkins and
Officer Greenwald are acknowledged to be
Beau Brummells of officialdom, but Chief
Lloyd refers to tbe uniforms. He is posi
tive that the officers should wear chevrons.
The number of chevrons shall denote the
length of time the wearer has been in the
service. All well-regulated police forces
are addicted to chevrons and chevronels
and epaulettes and gold lace and stars and
big buttons and visible clubs ana tassels,
and yet the Oakland force, which Chief
Lloyd believes to be second to none, and
which has proved its ability to shoot all
around Chief Crowley's men, is as plain as
a bulletin board after a heavy shower.
The Chief has given vent to his griev
ance in a communication sent to the Board
of Police Commissioners in which he
warmly advocates the use of chevrons. He
greatly regrets the poor showing made by
his men when on parade and longs to
command a body of men whose gold lace
shall reflect the rays of the sun and inci
dentally reflect credit to the department.
When the Commissioners read the com
munication from the Chief Messrs. Wilson
and Pehsol moved that the matter be
taken under advisement. They wanted
some time to look at a dictionary, not be-
Mayor Davie's Nightmare.
ing quite sure what a chevron might mean.
Mr. Peirsol looked with suspicion on the
request and was not sure at first that it
was not a covert plan to increase the sal
aries of the officials, and that on a dollar
limit would be worse than disastrous.
Mayor Davie saw a vision of the future
when the evolution of the chevron should
be so pronounced that a policeman's use
fulness would be at an end, while as a
muncipal ornament he would be a howl-
ing success.
"1 do not see why we should make dolls
of the officers," said the Mayor to-night.
"The City has no money with which to
buy folderols and I am sure .the men do
not want to buy ornaments. The plain
uniforms have been good enough for past
chiefs to command and it does not become
a Populist Chief of Police to want his men
to look like mixtures of Li Hung Chang
and a German lieutenant. If we order
chevrons now where are we going to stop?
We shall probably be given reasons in the
end for hiding the officer entirely from
sight, with decorations. It fills me with
horror to contemplate the future of such
innovations."
"All 1 want," said Chief Lloyd, "is a
force that will look dignified and well
dressed. The Mayor is opposed to any
thing that indicates progress, although I
venture to suggest that if ever an ordi
nance were introduced providing for a
drum-major's uniform for the Mayor, it
would not be vetoed. Marks of rank are
recognized as proper in all organizations,
and certainly in the Police Department
they would not be out of place."
The matter was very warmly discussed
at the meeting of the Commissioners this
afternoon. Mr. Peirsol had satisfied him
self that the chevron was not dangerous to
either person or property and he and Mr.
Wilson voted for the decorations. The
Mayor's opinion had not changed.
A MILITARY INSPECTION.
State University Cadets Will Be

BERKELEY, Cal., April 28. âThe

ond assembly of the day will be sounded,
after which will occur the battalion drill
in honor of Colonel Burton. Succeeding
the : drill will be extended order move
ments, followed *by ;â  the % sham ! battle.
Around , the 3 battle will center the chief
interest of the day, as the cadets are much
more numerous this year than ever, before,
and a special outline' of attack has i been
prepared by Captain Bush, who was re
cently chosen an aid-de-camp on Governor
Buud's staff. The first battalion will oc
cupy the lower section of the campus,
while the second battalion will be stationed
behind the trees and to the rear of the
library building. The advance will be
made by the second battalion, and the
first battalion, instead of seeking an
ambuscade, will proceed by platoons until
the battleground in front of North Hall
has been reached, where hostilities will be
commenced.
In the meantime the unmounted cav
alry company, known as saber company
G, will attempt to dislodge the artillery.
A special hospital detachment will be on
hand with stretchers and biers to look
after the dead, wounded, exhausted and
frightened.
The entire grass plat in front of the
building was mowed to-day in preparation
for the drill and battle. * .

FAMILY AN OBJECT OF CHARITY
The Children Have B.en Placed in
Homes and the Father in a
Hospital.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 28. j
John Stymel, who was injured last Janu
ary by an electric car on Sixteenth street,
is greatly regretting that he signed a re
ceipt in full for damages for $25 immedi
ately after the accident. At this time it
was thought the only injury caused by the
smash-up was to the dilapidated wagon
and injured horse, by which the junkman
managed to earn a respectable living for
himself, wife and six children, the oldest
less than 14 years ol age.
Immediately after the accident a mes
senger from the railroad hastened to the
injured man's home to learn the extent of
the damage.' Stymel, not being of a spec
ulative or grasping turn of mind, and sup
posing himself to be only bruised and
shaken up by the accident, permitted the
messenger to reckon the damage at $25,
which he accepted, giving a receipt to the
man for the sum. The messenger evi
dently knew his business, for the receipt
was so shrewdly worded as to cover all dam
ages that would likely develop later on.
Now the Stymel family weep bitterly as
they think of this mistake.
Since the day of the accident Mr.
Stymel has never been able to earn a dol
lar, and is now a helpless cripple lor life.
The slight injuries to his body turned out
to be an injured hip and knee.
But the worst of all was to his skull,
where a portion presses on the brain,
causing at times mental aberration and
epileptic fits.
Mrs. Prescott of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children heard of
the case, and upon investigation found it
to be far more sad than even represented.
Medical aid was provided, but the case of
the lather was one that required trepan
ning the skull, and Stymel had no means
to pay. Groceries were provided for the
destitute family by Supervisor Church.
Mrs. Stymel, in desperation at thÂ» situa
ation, consulted Attorney Foote to learn
if a suit could be brought against the rail
road for the purpose of getting money to
partly repay for the terrible calamity and
make the crippled father and her little
ones as comfortable at least a3 circum
stances would permit.
Mr. Foote read the document signed by
Stymel after the ; accident" and candidly
acknowledged that with such a receipt
there was no chance to win a suit against
the railroad. *
Mr. Foote, however, promised, to place
the matter before the directors, and Mrs.
Stymel, with hopeful spirits and lightened
heart, returned to land. The result of
Foote's appeal of the distressed case was a
â¢'donation" of $50.
To-morrow will be the last day. Mr.
Stymel will spend with his family. After
hearing the pathetic situation of Mr.
Btymei's case Dr. A. Miles Taylor has
generously offered, in response to Mrs.
Prescott's appeal, to take the sufferer into
his new sanitarium, on Telegraph avenue,
free of all charge, and to treat him to the
best of his ability, hoping to restore his
mind to its normal condition, as his poor
crippled body is past human aid.
Oi the family of little ones two have
been placed in the Temescal Home, one in
the Beulah Orphanage, one in a San Fran
cisco asylum. leaving the mother with the
two eldest. ...-,=, ?, .â -.-..â 
Not many years ago Stymel was a pros
perous merchant. He met loss after loss
until he was compelled to keep a junkstore
to support his family, which he did until
the fatal day of last January, when he met
with the accident that has ruined his fam
ily and home.

A NEW ELECTRIC PLANT
Alameda Is to Have a New
Light, Heat and Power
Company.
The City Authorities Ridicule the
Ideaâ Alameda Cyclers'
Anniversary.
ALAMEDA, Cat,., April 28.â sen
sation of the day occurred when F. N.
Delanoy, representing the Fort Wayne
Company, came down Park street this
morning "like a wolf on the fold," and
displayed a paper which he said was the
charter of the Alameda Electric-light,
Heat and Power Company. . Wnen ques
tioned as to whence the franchise ema
nated, he replied by sayini? that no fran
chise was necessary from the City Trus
tees, as section 19 of the State constitution
gave the company due powers to com
mence operations, and only required it to
enter into necessary stipulations with the
city to conserve its streets and- pay pre
scribed damages for any injury com
mitted. Mr. Delanoy said that rive promi
nent Park-street merchants were deeply
interested In the scheme. Who these gen
tlemen are is not ascertainable at present,
but as the company will be incorporated
in a few days, with a capital of $100,000.
fully paid up, according to the same
authority, the withholding of the names
does not cut any figure. The purposes of
the enfant terrible will be:
1. To manufacture, purchase and sell light,
heat and power.
2. To construct and operate wire lines, with
necessary poles and appliances. .
3. To buy, own and sell real estate.
The city authorities take little stock in
the affair, and with an incredulous smile
say Delanoy is out drawing to an ace in an
already opened jackpot. The expression
may not be tasteful, but is thought ex
pressive.
Coming Events.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 28.â dele

ALAMEDA, Cal., April 28.â Ninety

â¢ A Female Flower Stealer.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 28.â elderly
woman hailing, so she says, from the pur
lieus of San Francisco, named Mary
Eaton, was lodged in the city tombs this
moraine. The private gardens of the city
are now showing such a wealth of bloom
and color that the temptation proved too
strong for Mary. She was in the neigh
borhood of Santa Clara avenue and Sher
man street and must needs pull some of
the choicest roses off the bushes and root
up smaller plants to carry back with her.
The officer hove in sight and now she is
ruminating.
The Alameda Bed.
ALAMEDA, Cal., AprU 28.â The net
proceeds of the performance of "The Rival
Queens" for the endowment of the Ala
meda bed in the Children's Hospital, San
Francisco, amounted to $358 39.
A Church Built of Soil.
3 In Smith County stands a church built
of sod taken from the prairies surround
iiii*-, which was dedicated to-day by
the presiding elder of the Methodist
Episcopal church. People traveled
eight miles to witness the Easter ser
vices. It is the only church * built of
sod in Kansas. A month ago the people
of all denominations met, and, with their
own hands, built a place of worship out of
the only material which nature afforded.
When it was completed yesterday, and
ready for Easter dedication, every item of
expense in its erection had been paid. The
people who contributed in labor and
money agreed that denominational ser
mons should -be . barred, . and that only
"Christ and Him 3 Crucified" should be
preached from the sod church pulpit.

THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
TO CONSULT THE GREAT CLAIRVOYANT
AND MEDIUM PROF. F. EUGENE
1728 MARKET ST.
The professor during his long residence in san
Francisco has met with unprecedented success.
He could refer you to people all * over the world for
testimonials as to his worth, but it Is not neces-
sary to search the extremeties of the earth
when be can refer you to thousands in your mids:
who have been made prosperous and happy-
through his wise advice; ask your prosperous
neighbor who started him aright. Investigate and
you will find that your business rival is one of his
many patrons.
â '-Nothing succeeds like success," and if you
would be successful call on him without delay: it
costs practically nothing: ftOc and $1, 50 c and $1,
50c and $1. 60c and $1, SOc and $1 is his price
atpresent.no more than you would pay an un-
known clairvoyant or a partially developed
medium. *v :-.- *-.;â â¢ -
His readings astonish the most skeptical. All
are satisfied. The professor . gives advice on all
matters that are of interest to humanity. Busi-
ness, speculation, investments, insurance, love,
courtship, marriage and divorce; settles lovers'
quarrels and causes speedy and happy marriages.
He locates mines and buried treasures, finds 103",
or stolen property, interprets dreams, cures bad
habits and destroys evil influences in half the
time required by the best of the : other mediums.
Remember, there are but few mediums in the
world that can work theso wonders, and none out-
side of the eminent professor in San Francisco.
Remember PROF. EUGENE'S communications
come direct from- the Spirit World, hence his in-
ability to be mistaken in any matter.
Remember also that the Professor is perma-
nently located in San Francisco: he is here tostay.
Hours 10 A. M. to 8 p m. Letters containing
stamps answered. PROF. EUGENE,

TARTLING! T- i 'â  l
BEWITCHING! BEWILDERING!
- MARVELOUS!
Multitudes dally visit the sumptuous parlors of
PROFESSOR M. L. CARNELLE, 220 EDDY ST.
And why is It? The record made by this greatest
of mediums 7 years ago is reproduced unon his re-
turn, and the grand truths he then expounded left
Indelible imprints on the minds of studious people.
During the years of absence from our great city
the professor has visited every city of importance,
and has been consulted by the most eminent ex-
ponents of every art and science. He at all times
Invites skeptics to call on nim, and he will con-
vince them that he Is sincere and truthful in all
that be claims to do. The professor believes that
"Honesty Is the best policy," and desires your con-
fidence on all matters incidental to humanity. If
your existence possesses the many intricacies
which need unraveling he Is prepared to show
you the way. If false friends surround or beset
your path you will find his marvelous powers of
'he utmost avail. His vast experience in giving
advice on business, mines, speculations of any
kind, games of chance, changes, lawsuits, wills
old estates, lost or stolen property, interpreting
dreams, caring bad habits, and guiding you <
from ail troubles or dangers; also. India- ensable
advice on love, marriage and how to choose a
wife or husband for future happiness or success.
This, together with the work he performs in re-
uniting tbe separated, causing a speedy marriage
with the one you dearly love, healing family
troubles, removing evil influences.- etc., is the
safest guarantee that he is once and for all the
most brilliant medium and clairvoyant of modern
times. Thus it is that professional men and so-
ciety leaders seek his advice; thus it is that a
heavy mail Is dally his. The grandest test of a'l
is to seek him personally and you will find bim to
be the magnetic medium of the people. Letters
with stamps promptly "answered. Hours, 9 to 9

NOT OUT FOR
ANY OFFICE
Mr. Spreckels Clearly De
fines His Position
in Politics.
FOR THE PARTY ONLY.
The Good of Republicanism and
of California His Sole
Desire.
THE KELLY-MAHONEY BACKER.
M. H. De Young Appears to Be the
Man, Because His Paper Is Assist*
ing the Fakirs.
Much has been said in the newspapers
from time to time concerning the political
plans and purposes and the supposed
hopes and ambitions of John D. Spreckels.
He himself has said but little upon the
subject beyond emphatically and un
equivocally denying that he was a candi
date for high office or that he had had
aspirations for political preferment in any
capacity.
Mr. Spreckels was interviewed last night
as to his position in politics. He said :
"I desire first to be understood as being
for the Republican party and for no other
party. I believe in, its principles, and I
am satisfied if they are honestly carried
into effect that great good would come to
the . country and particularly to Cali
fornia. !
"It has been repeatedly announced that
I am in favor of Mr. Allison of lowa for
President and opposed to Mr. McKinley.
This is not true. However, in justice to
Mr. Allison, I will say that I am not op
posed to him, and sincerely state that I
am not opposed to Mr. McKinley, or any
of the other great leaders of the Repub
lican party. I might go along the list of
candidates and say as much, out as these
two gentlemen have been brought into
prominence on this coast 1 answer par
ticularly as to them.
"What I have asked, however, and shall
continue to plead for is that a delegation,
representing the leading .Republicans of
California, be sent to St. Louis with a com
mission to vote for the most available Re
publican candidate, having in view at all
times the great benefits which might and
should come to California. It cannot be
denied that California has heretofore frit
tered away her political power in every
National Convention. It is not my pur
pose to defeat Mr. McKinley or Mr. Al
lison, but it is my purpose to help Califor
nia into a commanding position in the
councils of the Republican party.
"I ask the Republicans of California to
consider well their own interests; I ask
them to reflect well before they act, and
when ready to make a decision not to
overlook their own interests. This view
of the matter should not be and cannot be
honestly interpreted as being opposed
to any man. I am pleased to
note that I have a number of
the most distinguished members of the
Republican party of California fully agree
ing with me in this position. lam also of
the opinion that every merchant and
every farmer and fruit-grower and laborer
in California will indorse my position if he
stops to consider . my real purposes. I
affirm now, and have heretofore affirmed,
that my political purposes are not selfish,
but they are in a broad sense to aid Cali
fornia and to bring to the front the deserv
ing members of the party who could, and
would, fill high and exalted positions with
fidelity and distinguished ability. Any
other motive assigned to me is absolutely
false and unauthorized.
"I shall not ask the delegation, or if 1 be
a member of it I will not exercise my
privilege to vote against a man unless
firmly convinced that I am serving the
best interests of the party and the people
of my State. Therefore, any effort to place
me in the attitude of antagonism to any of
the distinguished leaders of the party is
unwarranted, and I call upon the rank and
file of the Republican party of California
to note carefully what I here say."
Mr. Spreckels' attention . was called to
rumors that persons in his interest had
been attempting to make a compromise
with Kelly and Mahoney regarding the
membership of the delegates from the
Fourth Congressional District. Mr. Spreck
els replied: . ; ; 3-r
"I must say that I regret exceedingly to be
called upon to answer such foolish charges,
but for fear some of my friends might
misunderstand the situation, I will an
swer your question. In the first place,
there is only one, and can be only one,
legitimate set of delegates from that dis
trict. j If the facts leading up to the selec
tion of delegates are well considered, there
will be no misapprehension as to my po
sition. The State Central Committee met
and ordered that Congressional commit
tees of the various districts take general
charge of th c election of delegates.
"The meeting of tbe committee was held
in the afternoon of February 29. 3 On that
very evening Kelly and Mahoney held an
alleged meeting of the members of the
State Central Committee from the Fourth
District and * undertook to select a com
mittee to supervise t'.e primaries. It has
been shown, and can be shown, that no

regular or legal meeting was held. â¢ It is
charged that forged proxies were used at
this meeting, and fraud was practiced
upon the voters of 3' that district. i I
charge that proxies were there . voted
which were never given, and I have in my
possession the affidavit of two gentlemen
purporting to \ be represented, affirming
the correctness of this statement.
"At a later date a regular meeting was
called, with a majority present and duly
authorized to act, and preparations for the
primaries were made in due form and the
action widely and extensively published.
A committee of seven well-known and
honorable Republicans were chosen to act
for the party. A fair, open and honest
primary was held, and one set of delegates
was elected, and no more; and so far as the
alleged delegates . represented by Mahoney
and Kelly are concerned, they should not
be considered for one moment. The dele
gates themselves: are not to blame and
should not be censured, but it is a well
authenticated fact that they have been de
ceived and their names have been used by
designing men, and not for the interests of
the Republican party.
"I do not desire to indulge in any harsh
phrases regarding these gentlemen, par
ticularly the persons whose names have
been used as delegates, but I do desire to
record tbe fact that I consider the so-called
primary engineered by Kelly and Ma
honey a farce and a fraud, and to give it as
my deliberate judgment that any recogni
tion shown to such political trickery will
lead to the disgrace if not the defeat of the
party. It is to rid the party of just such
political actions and control that I have
consented to take an interest in the man
agement of party affairs. .
"I propose that the issue does not be
come involved. It is not a test between
Mr. Allison and Mr. McKinley. It is a
test as to whether or not a lot of machine
politicians shall control the Republican
party. The hue and cry going up
regarding Major McKinley is no
thing more than stealing the livery
of heaven to serve the devil with. It is
most remarkable that these gentlemen
should so suddenly come tb a realization
of the g:eat merits of Major McKinley and
should appear upon the field as his cham
pion and defender. :
"I ask that the Republicans of Califor
nia do not permit this great tried and
trusted leader to be dragged into the mire
by any such political mismanagement.
Surely he is not a party to it and should
not suffer by the actions of these scheming
politicians.
"In taking this stand for an unpledged
delegation. I am confident that I repre
sent the best interests of the entire party
without regard to faction, -and I am
equally confident that when the conven
tion meets, there will be no hesitancy
upon assuming this course of action.
"I am for the whole Republican party of
California. I represent and seek to repre
sent no faction. The party is broad enough
to include within its ranks all the worthy
and ambitious men in the State. My only
purpose is to advance the party's interest
and through its success the interests of
the people of California, of whom I am
one. All my interests, business and oth
erwise, are centered here.
"I believe with the ereat body of
thoughtful men in the State that the very
life of California and the Union demands
the restoration of the Republican party to
power. I believe in the principles of that
party and I ara not wedded to any partic
ular man for the Presidency. All that I
desire is that the party shall cnoose the
man who can harmonize the party from
Maine to California and sweep this coun
try next November."
"Whose hand do you believe to be be
hind this Kelly-Mahoney movement in
the Fourth Congressional District?" was
asked.
"It seems to be aided and abetted by M.
H. de Young," replied Mr. Spreckels. "I
should judge so, from the articles in the
Chronicle, which resort to lying to help
out Mahoney and Kelly. They seem to
show that such is the case. The proposi
tion that I had anything to do with Chris
Buckley is absurd and preposterous, or
that I would have anything to do with a
Democrat in politics,' especially when one
remembers Mr. Burns' alliance with Mr.
Buckley two years ago.
"I know that the Republican party is
large enough and strong enough to win
without tbe assistance of Mr. Buckley or
any other Democrat. As a matter of fact,
1 have not spoken with Mr. Buckley for
nearly two years."
CARE OF THE INSANE.
The Oft-Becurring Question of Keeping
Patients at the Receiving Hos
pital Again to the fore.
Judge Hebbard is making another on
slaught upon the Receiving Hospital in
regard to insane patients. It was caused
by the treatment of John Fitzpatrick, who
was taken to the hospital late. Sunday
night. 333: *33*3
'. All the cells for insane patients were
occupied and there was no room for Fitz
patrick, so he had to be taken to the City
Prison, where he was strapped down in a
cell by. himself. 3
When Fitzpatrick appeared before the
Insanity Commissioners on Monday, and
when it came out that he -, had. to be
strapped down in the City Prison, Judge
Hebbard was indignant. "He; went to the
office of the Board of Health and told the
secretary* that the board must provide ac
commodation for insane patients, conclud
ing with the intimation that within the
next twenty-four hours they must do so or
other steps would be necessary on his part.
Dr. Weil, the head surgeon at the hos
pital, has repeatedly asked the board to
have the insane patients taken to some
other building. "The cells," said the doc
tor yesterday,. "are not fit for a dog to live
in, much less a human being. The lining
of the padded ceils is torn, the: steel cells
are damaged, and the Â» wooden floors are
torn up. When those' that are in condi
tion for the reception of patients are filled,
we have no alternative but to refuse to
take any more." 3 3-~.
TO RESCUE A BABY.
Policeman Morrow's Experience in a
â¢ Channel-Street
| Sewer.* '
The baby scare has thoroughly seized
upon the public and it gave rise to a. scene
of the wildest excitement in the Mission
yesterday afternoon.
Between 43 and 5 o'clock a woman
thought she heard the screams of a baby
coming from the sewer on Channel street,
between Seventeenth and Eighteenth
streets. The. hews * spread like wild fire
and soon a large V crowd of excited men,
women and boys gathered to -listen to the
shrieks of the drowning baby. â¢:.>--'. -
Â Policeman Morrow .was , sent to investi
gate. When he reached Channel street the
crowd had assumed immense proportions
The men formed ia; solid circle round
Morrow, who stood near the manhole
while he disrobed.
Morrow boldly jumped through the
manhole â * and alternately crawling "and
swimming he made his way along the
sewer for; nearly a ; block till : . 'he reached
the 3 supposed 3 drowning baby. He 'i dis
tinctly heard the cries j above the din of
the rushing waters and groping in the
dark he clutched something ; warm, which
gave a i miaou. It was . a ?â  five kitten. * He
heard another -sound and ? groped in that
direction and caught * another [ live kitten.
3- The crowd 'quickly. dispersed, laughing
over their fears for the supposed baby.

household is visible only to such people !
as chance to be familiar with the name as
first given. '
Mrs. Rayward, while not exactly a
native daughter, has long been a resident
of California, though at various times dur
ing the past twelve years she 3has toured
the globe in a not altogether vain effort
to gather in the schekels of those who
cared to see the "parachute act" as ac
complished by a beautiful and well-formed
womar. * At different times she has made
ascensions before the uncrowned native i
sons of darkest Africa, and then, voyag- !
ing to Asia, has awakened the sleeping I
intellects of the Chinese by her daring
leaps. The dirty vagabonds as well as the !
nobility of sunny Italy have seen her at
different times, while ia the antipodes she

Mrs. Rayward was born in the Lone
WAGONS AGAINST RAILS
Big Horse-Haul of Wool From
Lower Fresno County to
, " This City. '
Saving of Twenty-Five Per Cent Over
Southern Pacific Freight
Rates.
The first ; large shipment of wool ever
brought to this City by team from a'dis
.a nee of nearly 200 miles, in . competition
with the Southern j Pacific ; Railroad Com
pany, arrived yesterday afternoon. 3
* This immense load of wool was hauled
by two six-horse teams, each team being
attached .to two fourteen-foot wagons
from Fresno County, near the Tulare line.
It was consigned to Hulme & Hart by M.
J.Velladao of Panoche. 3.3 .3. !
E. J. Ames was the freighter, assisted
by two drivers. They were eight days in
making the trip, but Mr. Ames says it
One of the Six^orse Loa_. of Wool Hauled by E. Ames Nearly Two Hundred
Miles to This City. ; â¢ â¢-- - V * : ': â¢
Star State ' twenty-three years ago.
Circumstances compelled her 3at an
early age to seek ' some means of
earning , a livelihood 3 and when but
in short '*' frocks -made 3 her .*' first balloon
ascension. /Coming to San Francisco, with
her mother and bisters, she later made a
tour of the State always chaperoned by her
mother. Her success as an aeronaut was
such as to warrant her going abroad, which
she did some six or seven years ago. In
quick, succession she visited Africa. Asia
Europe and Australia, returning to this
country two years later. .* ..â *.-* â â â â  --
In 1891 she returned to Australia, mar
rying the same year the only son of a gen
tleman of | the English nobility. She re
tired from the profession for a time, going
to England with her husband, where the
latter died some - two years ae*o. ; Fond
ness for the "parachute" caused* her to re
turn to Australia, where, until her return
to San Francisco, two weeks ago, she fol
lowed the sport with that same zeal and
earnestness which she evidenced when
necessity forced her to the occupation.
_â : Mrs.* Rayward is ' now bacK in her old
home for a long rest. -She has ho inten
tion of following her chosen vocation in
this country, first because she is not forced
to and second because r people who co up
in balloons are not appreciated. :
She is an aeronautist and a scientific
one at that, and does not care to be classed
with the followers of ; hot-air bags who go
up a few hundred feet and call themselves j
"artists." : . , *
"How many times have I been up in a
balloon?" she said yesterday. "Oh,
hundredsâ four or five hundred, I guess,
and though I have had some very narrow
escapes from death was never seriously in
jured. I was only 14 when I made my
first ascension. It was with Van Tassell,
who was afterward killed in a parachute
descent. Of course I have had some very
funny experiences, none more so than the
arrest of my manager for manslaughter.
On this occasion my balloon was 'carried
some â¢ sixty miles â¢ aÂ»vay. Of. course. I re
turned ' safe and j sound, but I had to go
bail for my manager before the officials
would release him.
1 may say with pardonable pride that I
I enjoy the distinction of making the high
est parachute jump (8000 feet) on record.
j I never think of cutting loose until my
i balloon is at least a mile high. Anything
| short of that is mere 'ballooning.' My ex
perience, of course, is not materially dif
ferent from that of other people who go
up into the air. f" I have fallen into rivers
and bays and even > into .the briny deep,
but I always take good care to have a boat
or tug on hand to fish me out.
"I shall; probably remain at home for a
long certainly I shall do no 'balloon
ing' in America."
Mrs. Rayward is a young and pretty
woman of , the blonde type, with a figure
which in aerial costume shows to excel
lent advantage. Her "up in the air"
flights have bereft her. of all ordinary
nervousness, though she confesses that
she would not like to see. the smallest bit
of a rodent in the top of a parachute the
moment after that important safety, valve
had been cut loose. ' "
could. have been done in seven had they
not stopped over one day in Santa Cruz
County on account of the rains.
The distance from .the starting point,
seventy-five miles * below Panoche, is
nearly 200 miles, . and Messrs. Hulme &
Hart say they can safely estimate on sav
ing 25 per : cent . over the : freight rates
charged by the railway company. 3 /".
The wool arrived in as good condition as
though it - had been housed in boxcars
despite the frequent rains which occurred
during the journey. 3 -33* Â
- Mr. Ames said to a Call reporter yester
day.afternoon that the only opposition he
met to his teams and men camping by the
roadsides was in Santa Cruz County
"and," he concluded, "l think it was due
to Southern Pacific influence. I certainly
cannot conceive of any other reason." If
other reasons existed they would most cer
tainly have been manifested in the other
counties through which we had to pass."
Mr. Ames \is an intelligent i and enter
prising man and be leels certain of being
able to compete with the railway in long
distance : freightin-., as he ; has been doing
with success in shorter hauls. -3- -
"â â  He started back with . a large load of
freight for San Juan last night. Careful
computation shows the saving to shippers
to be at least 25 per cent.
HOT SHOT FOR
COLLECTOR WISE
Major Moore Forcing the
Issue With His
Opponent.
GAINED MANY POINTS.
Inspector Richard Williams Held
for Trial and Wong Sam â  / : ;
Discharged.

NAMING A NEW INTERPRETER
Charley Ah Him, an Alleged H gh
binder, Said to Have Been Selected
for the Place.
Special Agent of the Treasury Moore
has gained several points lately in his bat
tle with Collector of the Port Wise. For
months the bitterest kind of conflict has
been maintained by these j a.ents .of the
Government, and the opinion is general
in Federal circles that it can only end with
the downfall of one or the other.
The fact that Judge Morrow of the
United States District Court yesterday
overruled the demurrer which "Williams
entered to the indictment was a victory
for Moore over Wise, and the dismissal of
the charges against Wong Sam by the
United States Grand Jury was another
and even more pronounced triumph for
the treasury agent. 7y 7:7
Williams will now have to stand trial
and the whole story of his alleged wrong
doing under the very eyes of the Collector
of the Port will be told in court. His trial
has been set for May 5. 3He has engaged
eminent counsel to defend him.
The fact that the United States Grand
Jury has failed to indict Wong Sam has
given new hope to Special Agent Moore in
his fight against the Collector.
Wong Sam, a notorious highbinder and
alleged murderer, was held for trial on the
preliminary examination by. United States
Commissioner Heacock. He was charged
with the unlawful landing of Dong Sun
Yet, a pretty Chinese girl, fo** " noral
purposes. "7^--7
. She was rescued by the mission people,
and . immediately, when the treasury
agents showed active hostility toward In
spector Williams, the arrest of Wong Sam,
who was the chief witness against Wil
liams, was ; ordered. . This was done to
checkmate Major Moore and to break the
force of Wong Sam's testimony against
Williams. --*Â..,.
The Chinese girl swore positively that
Wong Sam had met her at the steamer
and had arranged for Per landing. The
girl, however, was never allowed to land
by the customs authorities. She is still in
the mission home. '
There is a rumor in customs circles that
Quan Ah Him, alias Charley Ah Him,
has been appointed by Collector Wise to
succeed. Dick Williams as interpreter to
the Custom-house. This position has long
been filled by Williams, who is considered
an expert in the various Chinese dialects.
Louis Quong, who is attached to the Chi
nese bureau, is also a special interpreter
of the Custom-house. It is understood he,
too, is under investigation by the United
States Grand Jury *on charges similar Ito
those that brought about the indictment
of Dick Williams. Louis is a very shifty
youth, but, like Williams, always enjoyed
the confidence of the Collector, and stands
well among the reputable merchants of
Chinatown.- / .-_â *--_**â  -- - *â ;
As for Quan Ah Him, he is known as a
highbinder and gambler. It will be re
called that a few years ago A. E. T.Worley,
in charge of the Chinese Congregational
Mission, had Quan Ah Him arrested for
bigamy. He married a Chinese girl of the
mission, Rev. Dr. Masters performing the
ceremony. .He had one child by this wife,
a girl, who is now 12 years of age and lives
with her mother at the Presbyterian Mis
sion. After disposing of this wife, Quan
Ah Him, who, up to this time, pretended
great Christian devotion, married another
girl and lived with her up to the time that
proceedings were brought against him for
bigamy. ;.' *. *;* ;
Then she disappeared and has not been
seen nor heard of since. Her friends say,
however, she is now in Portland.
The prosecution was unable to secure a
conviction and the case was finally
dropped. '
Quan Ah Him reputation is alleged to
be i bad. *_ He was well, known at Los An
geles and Bakersfield, where his business
was principally that- of a slave-dealer. He
is now a resident of Chinatown, in this
City,- and â  the '-, report that Collector Wise
had made him interpreter, that was cur
rent on the street yesterday, created con
siderable amazement among those ac
quainted with ' the details of his life and
the .uncertainty of his character.

GOING AFTER THEM SOON.
He Will Visit Arizona and New
Mexico and Scour the High
'" Sierras and Coast.
George W. Dunn, who is widely known
on - the Pacific Coast, and especially in
California and this City as a naturalist of
wide experience, has received a commis
sion from Baron Walter Rothschild, and
will start collecting for him on Saturday
next.
â¢ He will first go to Arizona and New
Mexico. One man will be taken witli him,
probably from Yuma. Mr. Dunn usually
travels about in a light wagon, drawn by
one or two horses. The wagon contains
his nets, provisions, blankets, materials
and apparatus for caring for his specimens
of birds, reptiles and insects, and other
things necessary for the trip. 3-33;
The one person he takes with him is an
all-around man who can attend to the
horses, provide camp and do the cooking.
Mr. Dunn sometimes spends a whole sum
mer on the deserts, mountain, and jungles.
He has collected' for : many persons and
institutions during * the last forty-seven
years i since he came to California.
I He also has ' 10,000 specimens of insects
of his own, beside, fully 10,000 specimens
of shells and plants. .3
Mr. Dunn will collect plants, seeds and
butterflies for Baron de Rothschild. The
Baron has a five-story building erected for
rare natural history specimens and wants
to fill it.
The letter received by Mr. Dunn is
signed by Dr. K. Jordan, the Baron's cura
tor. It is in part as follows:
