DEMOCRACY SORELY DIVIDED
Leaders Grow Alarmed by
the Cheers Coming
From Canton.
WARNINGS ARE GIVEN
IN VAIN.
The Delegates to the National
Convention Breathe Threats
of Fury.
STRIFE AND DISRUPTION NOW
FACE THE PARTY.
Silver and Gold Not the Only Conten
tions Upon Which Factions Will
Clash at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., June 27.â The Demo
cratic leaders are alarmed because of the
cheers and shoutings coming from Canton
and Paterson for McKinley and Hobart
and protection. The people seem to have
risen enmasse to voioe the sentiment of
protection to home industries. The
Democracy is divided against itself and is
a riotous mob rather than an army pre
paring for a decisive battle.
Hill, the bald-headed war ea?le, shrieks a
warning from Manhattan, Cleveland is
denounced in Democratic councils as a
â¢.raitor to his party and to the people, and
the delegates now gathering from all parts
cf tbÂ« Nation for the great war talk are
breathing threats of fury that bode inter
riecu'e strife and disruption.
Hoy the mighty have fallen! It was
only afew days aco that Ruben Turney in
the Onto Democratic State Convention de
mandeJ that Cleveland's portrait should
be throvn out of the hall, and referred to
the Preiident as 'That arch traitor; that
Benedic Arnold of the Democratic party."
And amd all the shouting of this dis
organize! army we hear the thunder of
the captains, Whitney and Hill of New
York, in be far East, and in the Middle
West the voice of Boss Altgeld is heard
rallying tlÂ« panic-stricken host. They
have fallen back on that old Democratic
utopianism.a tariff for revenue only. I
saw an oldapple-woman sitting by her
stand, barehiaded in the rain in Park Row,
New York, last Thursday morning,
and I askd her what she thought
of the Democratic doctrine of a tariff
for r.<:<renne Â«nly, and she replied that she
iktn . . to get any revenue out
of it and she wouldn't swap her apple
carl for the vbole Democratic party. 1
asked a Hunfarian woman who was sell
ing papers onthe Bowery, bareheaded in
the pelting s*rm, and her reply was that
the tariff had:'t given her enough revenue
to buy a two-tt straw hat or an umbrella.
Yet the Demcracy having nothing left to
shout for, iiftjup its voice and has the old
song. The Dmocratic organs are in a
quandary all <ver the country. They are
seizing every tile sop that seems to prom
ise them the aast comfort. The Detroit
Free Pre?s sa;s:
"Illinois, ajectedly as it has surren
dered to Repolican and Populist notions
of fiatism, clngs to tariff reform with
commendabletenacity. 'We favor tariff
for revenue orty,' the platform reads, and
declares tha' the Government should
collect no moe taxes than are necessary
to defray tbe xpenses of the Government
honestly and economically administered.
This has the ight ring. There is no prin
ciple that wil inspire the Democracy with
greater zeal nd enthusiasm than this."
True it bas he right ring of Democracy,
and I opine hat should there be any lack
of orators to p upon the stump to extol
tne virtues i Democratic tariff in the
East the wqj-growers and raisin-pro
ducers of California will furnish an army
of speakers. jo doubt Collector of the
Port John H. VisÂ» of San Francisco will
gladly take a vicaiion and explain to the
Easterners and tbe Westerners how the
wool-raisers an waxing fat under the
Wilson bill, and how after they have
sheared their fl-.jks they kill them for
mutton and doni have to pay so much
for the Worceiershire sauce which
Johnny Bull sefls over to flavor them
with. Then, if tfr. Wise should not be
enough, the Austalian wool-erowers, who
are getting rich uider the Wilson bill, will
raise a snbscripion to send a hundred
speakers over her if needs be. The man
ufacturers in Sheffield, Manchester, Bris
tol, Liverpool anl Glasgow will also send
their quota, for they are all true-blue
Democrats and jelieve in an American
tariff for Britia revenue only. The
raisin-grower mÂ£f dig up his vines and
plant corn and Waters, as they do out
West and East, bcause he can buy all the
Spanish raisins ft wants cheaper than he
can grow them. The cheap-goods shibbo
leth of cheap-Jthn Democracy means
cheap labor, and >oth are the logical out
come of ihe doctme of a tariff for revenue
only. Then witha solemnity that is side
splitting the Prds winds up its editorial
with the folio wiri:
'Temporary detractions, like the cheap
money madness.tnay arise, but there is
no danger that tie Democratic party will
veer very far frofr the course that has led
to its notable fiumpbs the past twelve
years."
"Its notable tiumphs during the past
twelve years" is hinny.
The New Yor: Journal correspondent
says of the New fork convention:
"Nothing abou the convention is likely
to create any glowing hope of the
success of the Kw York delegates in the
fight they propose making at Chicago.
Enthusiasm wa9Svholly lacking. A plat
form, which in ts essentials was strong
and commenda' c, was heard by the dele
gates almost in ilence, and adopted by a
vote which was s perfunctory as it was
unanimous."
In another pi cc tbe same writer says
that the domimr.t sentiment of the con
vention was deuair. Many of tbe dele
gates left withut waiting for the after
noon session, 'hose who remained ap

dispersed, sayijg to each other that the
The San Francisco Call.
fight they were undertaking was almost
lost already.
In the manufacturing centers of the
East and West and in the farming dis
tricts the people are clamoring for protec
tion. It means bread and butter to them,
and when a man makes up his mind to
vote for bread and butter it is a very dif
ficult matter to change him. That is the
Key note of the McKinley boom. That is
why his plaster bust is given a place of
honor in every business house, restaurant,
shop and saloon in Canton and Niles, and
why his portrait can be seen in every pub
lic place in the country. It is business
that the peopie want and they mean busi
ness, so that there is an element of bur
lesque in the reiteration of the Democratic
State conventions of the old tariff doctrines,
the very thing against which the people
j are most resentful. The Democracy can
get no consolation out of the silver sword.
It cuts the band that wields it The tariff
will be the issue in tbe coming campaign,
and protection will be the battle-cry. An
ger glows in the ranks of the silver Dem
ocrats and they will come to Chicago
frothing at the mouth. The two-thirds
rule which was artfully contrived to choke
them off will be thrown to the winds, for
silver has the majority, and a body such
as a National convention is the sole judge
of the qualifications of its own members
and it is the sole maker of its own rules.
This requires the silver men to furnish 620
delegates. The following list shows that
they have but 584, or thirty-six short of
two-thiras.

and adopted the unit rule, so that the
entire delegation would be compelled to
veto as the majority willed. But the sil
ver men have started contests in two
districts now represented by gold mci.
By unseating two gold delegates the silver
men will have a majority of the whole
delegation and Michigan's twenty-eight
votes would then change the silver col
umn. The silver men may thus obtain
by force two- thirds of tbe National Con
vention.
The numerous contests in this and
other States will provoke much bitterness
of feeling and will help to hopelessly
widen that little Democratic rift within the
lute. If the National Committee should
adopt high-handed measures and give the
contested seats to the gold delegates there
will arise a roar beside which that of the
bull of Bashan will be as gentle as the
cooing of a dove. Exciting scenes are
looked for when the convention meets
and when the Democratic yell startles
Lake Michigan into a spasm of squalls.
The cloud with a silver lining is funnel
shaped, and there will be a political tor
nado. Every one here is expecting it.
Although but few of the delegates are yet
on the ground, letters have been received
by prominent Democrats here which fore
shadow the storm. The feeling is one of
vindictivenessâ of desperation. Governor
Altgeld, which name, strange to say,
means "high money," will be the promi
nent figure of the convention. His bands
already grasp the reins of control. He is
a millionaire two or three times over, is
abused twice a day by the press, but is
idolized by the people. He is rhinoceros
hided as to criticism, and instead of fol
lowing Mr. Vanderbilt's example and
damning the people, he damns the news
papers.' His hold on the Democratic ma
chine is strong, and he will not take any
dictation from Hill, Whitney or any of
the rest. He says that the tail has been
wagging tbe dog for more than thirty
years, and that he proposes to give the
dog a chance. His complaint is that the
people of the East have heretofore domi
nated Democratic National conventions in
the interest of the East and of its indus
tries, and that it is time the West
and the South should have a voice in Na
tional affairs.
To show the desperate straits to which
the Democracy is driven I will refer to a
resolution offered by ex-Governor Flower
of New York in the Saratoga convention:
Whereas, Party division at Chicago on the
silver question will endanger Democratic suc
cess at the polls; and, whereas, Republican
ascendency in the Nation would undoubtedly
be followed by another attempt to establish
minority rule in the Democratic Southern
States by means of a force bill; therefore, be it
Besolved, That the Democrats of New York
appeal to the Democrats of the South, in the
name of their political liberty and their
BRAWNY BRITISH LADS HAVE AN OUTING
properties, to avert the possibility of a force
bill by uniting with tho Democrats of the East
and West in framing a platform on which we
Democrats Can stand and the united support of
which will lead to a glorious Democratic vic
tory.
And this in tbe year 1896, prolific in free
schools, intelligence and civilization ! Ex-
Governor Flower seems to have a very
poor opinion of the intelligence of the
people of the South when he thinks that
they can be scared by a bugaboo of that
kind. A force bilL to force election officers
to fulfill their oaths nnd count the ballots
correctly is no bucbear to honest citizens,
but it shows at what slender straws the
desperate Democracy is clutching in order
to save itself out of the present whirpool.
The Illinois delegation will meet and
organize in this city next Tuesday. Gov
ernor Altgeld will bo with them, and they
will decide upon a plan of action.

ALTGELD IS DICTATOR.
May Name the Nominee of the
Chicago Convention for the
Presidency.
CHICAGO, 111., June 27.â Senator John
M. Palmer came into town to-day. The
Senator came not on a political mission,
but for the purpose of attending the fun
eral of his life-long friend, Lyman Trum
bull. He and the late jurist had been as
sociated in politics in Illinois from an
early date, and the Senator felt it incum
bent upon himself to follow the remains
of his old friend to the grave. Senator
Palmer was adverse to discussing politics.
He deplores the drift, however, of the
Democracy, at least the Western wing of
the party, to the free-silver cause. He
realizes, however, that it will be next to
impossible to check the stampede of West
ern delegates into the ranks of the silver
ites. He does not believe that Senator
Teller's candidacy will be indorsed by the
Democratic Convention. Personally he is
opposed to Teller; not only upon
the grounds of the Colorado man's
liking of tne white metal, but
he is one of those hard-headed Democrats
who believes that there is Presidential
timber enough within the party without
inviting an outsider, especially a Republi
can of tbe Teller stripe, to the premiership
of the organization.
"This silver wave," said Senator Palmer,
"is nothing more than a drift toward Pop
ulism. It is much like the greenback
craze, and, like that financial epidemic,
will react in the course of time. During
the hard time of the last few years the
people have grasped at most every fallacy
that promised relief."
Senator Palmer will return to Spring
field to-night.
Governor Altgeld is a very much talked
of man these days. He is an active ag
gressive person, and his devotion to the
silver cause inspires the hatred of the
gold men as pronouncedly as it does the
love of those Democrats who believe in bi
metallism. The Governor has been resting
quietly at Springfield since the Peoria
convention, which he controlled abso
lutely. He dictated the nominations and
wrote the platform. Every delegate in
the convention-hall bowed to his absolute
will. He is a man of strong character,
great determination, and thoroughly in
formed upon all political movements in so
far as his party is concerned. The Gov
ernor's popularity in Illinois is phenom
enal. It will be remembered that when
he pardoned the anarchists the people
generally were amazed at his conduct and
censured him severely. A wave of derision
swept' over the whole State. Altgeld for
the time being was politically dead. But
he rose again, and is to-day the silver god
of the Democratic party.
His friends declare that he will come
pretty near dictating the Presidential
nominee of the convention. It is said of
him in Chicago to-day that he is piannine
a coup to secure the nomination of ex-
Congressman William R. Morrison for the
head of the ticket, but the Governor denies
this story. Anyway Morrison is a gold
man. Altgeld has sent out an emphatic
protest from Bpringfield declaring that
any statement to the effect that he is
working for any particular candidate has
no foundation. He denies having had a
secret conference with Colonel Morrison
at Pontiac, as stated in some of the Chi
cago papers. He is also credited by a
Chicago paper with being in collusion
with certain other party leaders to secure
the nomination of Judge Samuel P. Mc-
Connell of Chicago for the Presidency.
This story the Governor also denies. There
is no question, however, that in addition ;o
his determination to have the silver plank
adopted in the platform he is woruinK in the
interests of candidates who will be accept
able to that faction of the party, but
whether it is Bland, Boies, Matthews or
Stevenson no one seems to be able to fore
tell. The Governor is a secretive man, a
shrewd politician and keeps his own coun
sel, but it is thought in certain quarters
that he will come out for Stevenson in
order to aid in pulling himself through in
this State. The Governor will be here
early next week and will open up head
quarters. He has directed Chairman Hin
riensen to call the members of the Illinois
delegation to a conference at the Sherman
House on June 30 to outline the plan of
campaign.
Fred Dnbois, United States Senator of
Idaho, and first lieutenant of the Teller
silver brigade, arrived in town late to
night. He had been over at Springfield
visiting relatives and quietly building
silver fences. He will open up head
McKINLEY HONORED AT HOME
quarters here and will make a strong effort
to secure the indorsement of Teller by the
Democratic convention. He realizes that
the Democrats will adopt a silver platform,
ana is anxious to have it a silver conven
tion. In case the gold men should bolt
the convention, he would be much better
pleased, as it would then be a battle
between the old parties upon the lines
which the people of his kidney most
desire â that of gold and silver.
Colonel John I. Martin, sergeant-at-arms
of the Democratic National Convention, is
a picturesque character. He comes from
Missouri, and it is an old story that the
man from Missouri is different irom other
people. The colonel was born in St. Louis
May 24, 1848. He attended the public
schools of that city in his youth, but only
had gathered the crumbs of an education
when his father, who was a boss teamster,
drafted the boy into his service as a dray
man ; but young Martin was ambitious;
he was brainy, too, and so while he drove
a dray about the city of St. Louis during
the daytime he studied at nieht. Finally
he became a clerk, later a saleman and
then a merchant. But being of a philo
sophical turn of mind he read law and in
1878 was admitted to the bar, and as he
passes down the streets of his native city
his admirers point him out as one of the
most capable lawyers of his day. He
has been a prosecnting attorney and
a Judge of the Court of Crim
inal Correction. This is the man who
will marshal the forces at the great Coli
seum in Jackson Park on Tuesday week.
The Coliseum is splendidly equipped
for convention purposes. This is espe
cially true as regards the facilities for the
correspondents. Secretary Sheerin, who
has charge of press accommodations, has
already received some hundred applica
tions for seats in the press circle. The
space underneath the platform has been
allotted to the telegraph companies, and
bulletins and news matter can be rushed
through rapidly. There will be 906 dele
gates in the convention. The hall proper
is 250 feet wide by 335 feet long. The seats
will be arranged in rectangular instead of
in semi-circular form, as was at first
planned. The speakers' stand will be
at the north end of the hall. Below and
immediately in front of this will be 1000
seats for the delegates and alternates.
The press seats will flank the platform
and behind it will be the section reserved
for the members of the National Commit
tee and for distinguished guests. In pro
viding for all these something like 3000
seats in all are taken up. Twelve thou
sand chairs will remain for the spectators.
These seats will rise in tiers on three sides
of the building â the north, south and
west â to a height of forty feet. A gallery
thiny-rive feet wide will encircle the entire
building. The seating arrangements on
the three sides mentioned will be carried
up into this gallery. There is still another
gallery ten feet wide, higher up, for the
use oi which no plans have been made.
The acoustic properties -^re perfect.
The Bland headquar;Â«rs will be opened
up next Monday at liie Auditorium annex.
The Miasourians will occupy a row of
rooms within earshot of the apartments
reserved for W. C. Whitney, the leader of
the gold element.
Colonel Nicholas M. Bell, Colonel Joseph
J. Lickey, Colonel George W. Allen and
several other colonels who will manage
the Bland boom will reach Chicago on
Monday morning and open up the cam
paign for Silver Dick, who is now quietly
cutting hay and sawing wood on his Mis
souri l'arm and saying nothing.
The Matthews headquarters wilt be
opened up at the Palmer House on Mon
day.
With the Bland, Boies and Matthews
"roosters'* in the field, the Democratic
powwow of 1896 may virtually be consid
ered on. E. E. Wall, National Committee
man from Wisconsin, and John G. Pra
ther, National Committeeman from Mis
souri, came into town to-day. F. W. Har
rity, chairman of the National Committee,
will arrive on July 1.
There are persons in Chicago bold
enough to predict that the convention
will eclipse Donnybrook in every respect.
Certainly the elements are not lacking to
make it intensely spectacular. There are
gold Democrats, silver Democrats, free
trade Democrats, Cleveland and anti-
Cleveland Democrats, Democrats who are
Populists and Populists who are Demo
crats â all chasing phantoms and worship
ing strange gods. There is talk of a bolt
among some of the gold men, should they
fail in drafting the platform and thus di
recting the destiny of the party for the
next four years. Others again favor a
compromise measure, while not a few
would be willing to straddle the issue; but
the silver forces, with determined and un
compromising men in command, de
clare they will win their spurs upon
the battlefield on lines of action orig
inally mapped out. They will accept
no half-way treaty. It will be the free
and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio
of 16 to lor nothing, and this independ
ently of all the other nations of the world.
Already they claim 642 delegates, and
laugh with derision at the efforts of the
gold men to curb their sway. On the
other hand, the gold men are equally
confident.
National Committeeman Sherley of
Kentucky â and. like the other delegates
from the Blue Grass State, "A colonel,
sir"â sends The Call this statement:
"I have heard a great d<al of talk and
have given the National situation consid
erable study, and I have come to the con
clusion, personally, that a goid platform
will be adopted, I believe that the plat
form will be just as pronounced on the
money question as is the plank of the
Republican party. I think there will
be a practically unanimous agree
ment on the New York platform. I
will venture to predict that there will
be almost entire harmony in the Demo
cratic convention. There will be no bolt,
and tbe one question of currency will be
adjusted in a manner satisfactory to all.
I am not familiar with tne local situation,
and speak only from my knowledge of the
National one. I expect Illinois to play an
important part in the proceedings, but in
order to do so it will have to put a candi
date in the field who is a man of National
reputation. It will not do to try to come
out with some local silverite like McCbn
neli, or whatever his name is. I never
heard of him before. With a man like
Stevenson or Morrison Illinois might still
be able to dictate the Presidential nomi

CANTON, Ohio, June 27.â The nomina
tion of McKinley was ratified witn pomp
and ceremony this afternoon. The out
pouring of people from Cleveland and
other cities of Eastern Ohio wai very large.
All day long crowds hung about the Mc-
Kinley residence and a lively stream of
callers poured in at the gate.
The speaking this afternoon was from a
stand erected at one end of a large vacant
lot. The meeting was presided over by
Judge W. R. Day of Canton, who made a
pleasant speech and introduced President
Walcott of the Tippecanoe Club of Cleve
land, who made an address. Mr. Wolcott,
who is a brother of Senator Wolcott of
Colorado, said :
To-day as we have assembled to ratify the
nomination of our Republican standard-bearer,
I am reminded of a story about one of my
nephews. He was trying to tell the story of
the good Samaritan. He started in ail right
about the man going down the Jericho road
and how he fell among thieves, who stripped
him of his raiment and wounded him and
departed, leaving him half dead, and how a
Levite who came along looked at the poor fel
low and then passed by on the other side. Then
when it came to the Samaritan my nephew got
a little confused. He did not know anything
about Samaria, but he did know something
about America, and so in telliug the story my
nephew said: "A good American came along
who took pity on the poor fellow^ and bound
up his wounds and took care of him."
I can see a very evident application of this
story as my nephew told it. ' Four years ago
this country did, perhaps we might literally
say, fall among political thieves, who robbed
her of her prosperity, wounded her and left
her for dead. Then the Fifty-fourth Congress
came along and it looked at the sad condition
of this countiy, and then passed by on the
other side and wouldn't even pass any tariff
law or any currency law. But now we can
take courage, for there is coming along a good
American, or a good Samaritan, whichever
you want to call himâ most people call him
"Bill McKinley." He is the man we've been
looking for. He will heal up our National
wounds and send our country on its way re
jo icing.
As president of the Tippecanoe Club the
pleasant duty falls upon me of expressing the
joy which the members of the club ieel over
the work of the St. Louis convention, and no
better place for doing so could be found than
right here in Canton. Here Major McKinley
has received the loving congratulations of
wife and parents, blessed and hallowed as we
know they must be by kisses and tears of joy
and affection; here mends and neighbors have
grAsped his hand as they have poured forth
their hearty and sincere gratulations; here
congratulatory messages have been received
from all parts of the Unionâ from the East and
West and from both sides of Mason and Dixon's
line and from all kinds and conditions of men,
from political friends and political foes, from
those great in power, and, better still, from

the plain people, and all this spoutaneous
outpouring has been but a well-deserved trib
"ute to the sterling manhood of William
McKinley.
Now, to this mighty chorus the Tippecanoe
Club wishes to add its gladsome iiote of
praise and thanksgiving over the triumph
of our political idol. We are a club largely
composed of young .men at that formative
period of life when they are wont to select
tome one as a model and a guide, and several
years ago William McKinley was, by common
consent, selected by us all as that model. The
great occasions in our club's history have been
the banquets Ht which William McKinley Jr. j
was present and addressed us. We have lived
near Governor McKinley, have often seen him
and heard him speak, and with fond admira
tion have followed his private and public life
and'have a profound love and respect for him.
We look to him as our leader, and have ever
been ready to go where he sent or follow
where he led us. We cannot but love a mau
who has never been led by political rainbows
to follow strange gods, but has ever been true
to his political faith and always kept incense i
burning at the altar of protection, through
whose favors alone can a sure and lasting
prosperity come to our country. Had victory
not been given at St. Louis we should still have
loved and admired Major McKiuley, but as he
was triumphant tbere we now feel called upon
for renewed efforts to make secure, if possible,
that the triumph at St. Louis may be followed
by an equally sweeping victory in November.
As President of the United States William Mc-
Kinley will walk into a broader life, bat we
know he will still be guided by the same noble
alms and high purposes which have controlled
him hitherto.
As he has been an inspiration to the young i
men of the Tippecanoe Club so will he be an j
inspiration to the young men of the Nation, j
both those now living and those who shall
read the story of his life, They will find him a
good and upright citizen in every-day life, a
careful, faithful, industrious man, a loyal sol
dier in times of war, a profound statesman in
times of peace, devoted to principle, a believer
in America for Americans and a champion of
protection more persevering and successful |
than any of our great leaders iiving or dead, j
We of the Tippecanoe Club love him and long j
for the day when we can greet him as Presi
dent William McKinley.
Mr. Wolcott was followed by General C.
H. Grosvenor. General Grosvenor's fame
as a MaKinley worker had gone before
him and he was given a cordial welcome.
The chairman introduced him as the rec
ognized leader of the Republican House
of Representatives. Speaking of the is
sues of the campaign General Grosvenor
eaid:
"The Republican Convention at St.
Louis did not abandon any of the tenets
of its ancient political faith. Nor did it
announce any new doctrine. It stands to
day, as shown by its platform, where it
stood from 1861, all along the shining path- !
way it has journeyed.
"Bear in mir.d, it was the Republican
party which enacted the law authorizing
the issue of the greenback dollar and pro
claimed as the solemn purpose of the
country that the greenback should be a
demand upon the treasury for a dollar as
good as tbe dollar of the best and richest
country on earth. It was the Republican
party which redeemed that promise and
gave a dollar in gold to the holders of each
dollar of their money.
"The silver question now soon to be a
National issue between the men of sound
money ideas and the Populistic fifty-cent
dollar advocates is a convenient mark to
hide behind by the party which, coming
into power in 1893, proceeded to destroy
the industiies of the country and plunge
the treasury into insolvency. That is the
real issue of this campaign. The answer
to this question and issue will come from
the people. The people always settle the
real issues. The people have decreed that
we shall raise money sufficient to main
tain our treasury, and that we shall not
borrow it from Europe."
Hon. James H. Hoyt of Cleveland fol
lowed General Grosvenor. His speech was
the most humorous of the day, and was
heartily applauded.
Charles Emery Smith was most heartily
greeted when the chairman introduced
him as the friend of Blame. Garfield, Har
rison and McKinley. Mr. Smith, among
oth^r things, said:
"I congratulate you upon the supreme
honor which comes to the man whom you
in your love and faith have given to pub
lic life, and I congratulate him upon the
personal devotion and long and loyal sup
port of such people as I see before me. No
man can hold the continued fidelity of
such a people without being worthy of the
broadest trust. This earnest and high
minded community represents and reflects
the intelligence, judgment and patriotism
of the great American people. To preserve
the full and constantly growing confidence
of such a constituency requires service of
the highest standard, and is itself* the
pathway and the title to the confidence of
the whole country. The rulers of the
Republic have for the most part sprung
from such communities. The Lincolns,
the Grants, the Garfields, the Blames, the
Harrisons have met the highest demands
of the Nation because they have grown up
with the flavor of the soil and in close
touch with the plain people.
"To this immortal roll of people's leaders.
Major McKinley comes by the right of a
popular choice and anointment unsur
passed in all our history. The future
years will look back to the convention of
1896 with admiration and gratitude for its
courage, its high spirit and its unflinching
action. It was the bravest of all conven
tions in the history of the party and the
truest in its direct reflection of the peo
ple's will."
The last speaker, save McKinley, was
the brilliant young orator who has suc
ceeded him in Congress, Hon. Robert W.
Taylor. Mr. Taylor declared that the
Democrats are trying to direct attention
from the real issue by talk about an im
aginary one. We had, he maintained, the
same currency and currency legislation in
1890, 1891 and 1892, and we were prosper
ous then. McKinley represented the anti
thesis of all the legislation and principle
the people complain of. He was the peo
ple's candidate.
A glee club sang a campaign song and
before the song was finished Major Mc-
Kinley came upon the platform. In a
moment there was an outburst of applause
and cheering and when he arose to
speat the noise was deafening. Major
McKinley looked well and his voice was
strong. He said :
"My fellow-citizens: I thank you for
this magnificent demonstration. I think
I know just what it means. It is in no
sense personal, but it is the assurance of
the interest which you feel in the great
questions which are to be considered in
the great campaign and which are to be
settled by the American people at the
ensuing election. It means, my fellow
citizens, that you are attached by every tie
of fealty and affection to the fundamental
doctrines of the Republican party. Re
publican principles do not perish; they
have not suffered by defeat; they have not
suffered by their temporary rejection by
the people.
"They are brighter and more glorious to
day than they have ever been before.
[Cries of 'That's right.'] They are en
deared to every American citizen and en
shrined in every American heart. [Loud
applause.] Their defeat before the Amer
ican people has never brought good to any
American interest and their triumph has
brought only good to the American peo
ple. [Applause.] And, my fellow-citizens,
those principles are to be tried before you
this year. What will your answer be in
November? [a voice â 'The election of
McKinley,' and loud cheering, which
lasted several moments before the Gover
nor could resume his speech.]
"What are those principle?, my country
men? A protective tariff that takes care
of every American interest and secures
the highest good of American labor.
[Great cheering.] A principle that in
sists that our wort shall be done at home
and not abroad. [Loud yelling and ap
plause.] A reciprocity that, while seeking
the world's markets for our surplus prod
ucts, will neveryieidupa single day's work
that belongs to the American working
man. [Vociferous cheering.] And then,
a sound dollarâ as sound as the Govern
ment and as untarnished as its flag.
[Loud cheering.] A dollar that is
good, not only at home, but good
whererer trade goes; a dollar that
is as cood in the hands of the
farmer and workingman as in the hands
of the manufacturer or the capitalist.
[Cheers.] Thes* great principles em
blazoned as they will be upon the banners
of the Republican party, are bound to
bring triumph in November and, as I
firmly believe, will carry messages of
sweetness and of happiness to every
American home and every American fire
side. [Continuous applause.] I thank
you, my countrymen, for this manifesta
tion of your good will. We are all proud
to have you here to-day, and my advice to
the Mayor is to have the census taken at
this time." [Laughter and applause.]
The evening parade which Major Mc-
Kinley reviewed was elaborate, and closed
the demonstration iv a satisfactory and
picturesque manner.

ticket the platform and money legislation

The Kentuckian intimated that Steven
son would be the most acceptable to the
South. The fact is the friends of the Vice-
President, who has all alone been in tbe
field for the Presidential nomination, are
working quietly but effectively in his in
terests.
But Bland, who is weeding his garden
in Missouri, and Boies, who is hoeing com
in lowa, seem to be at the head of the
Presidential procession , to-day. The
former leads with 106 votes, claiming
Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Ari
zona, Indian Territory and Oklahoma.
Massachusetts with thirty vote 3 and New
Hampshire with eight will go for ex-Gov
ernor RuÂ«sell. New York will back Wil
liam C. Whitney with seventy-two and
California will support its brilliant native
son, Stephen M. White, with eighteen
votes. Of course, Boies will be loyally
backed by lowa with twenty-six votes and
Matthews with Indiana's solid thirty.
Kentucky will present Blackburn to the
convention, Pennsylvania is pledged to
Patterson, Ohio has ils McLean and South
Carolina its Tillman, while Illinois, though
unpledged to any candidate, may swing
in line for Stevenson. With such an array
of Democratic talent representing all sec
tions of the country and all phases of
Democracy, and with so many conflicting,
it would be a reckless person who would
attempt to pick a winner.

NO CHANCE AT CHICAGO.
Whitney Does Not Think That a
Compromise Will Be Made at
the Convention.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 27.â A repre
sentative of the United Press called upon
Hon. W. C. Whitney at his residence, 52
W st P'ifty-seventh street, and had the
following interview with him as to the
coming campaign:
"How is the campaign progressing?"
asked the reporter.
"Like 1860, the truth must be told,"
replied Mr. Whitney.
"What are the chances of sound money
in Chicago?"
"Unless t:e situation changes, and our
Southern and Western friends are dis
posed to reason with us, no chance what
ever."
"What do you hear in the Souih and
West?"
"Judging by the letters I receive there
is no apparent disposition to discuss the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
matter at issue. I fear it has gone beyond
that point."
"Have you asked Senators Gorman and
Brice to attend the convention as a party
duty?"
"No; they have no reason to believe
that they could accomplish anything.
None of us has."
"If a free-coinage candidate is named
on a free-coinage platform what will be the
result?"
"Practically it will disrupt the Demo
cratic party. No power on earth can
either coerce or persuade sound-money
Democrats to forsake the fundamental
principle of Democracy. They do not re
gard this question as either factional,
sectional or political. The main
tenance of National credit â¢ia a
matter of National honor. The
Saratoga platform emphasizes this fact.
It says the rigid maintenance of the pres
ent gold standard at the present time is
essential to the preservation of our Na
tional credit, the redemption of our pub
lic pledges and the keeping inviolate of
our country's honor. That is New York s
position. It is as positive as words can ex
press; and it cannot be changed."
"Then you do pot Jook for a compro
mise?"
"Compromise is impossible. Debase
ment of the currency would be more than
monstrous in effect. It would be aban
donment of principle. It would disgrace
every citizen. It would be not merely dis
honest, but dishonorable. Ana you can
not compromise a question of honor."
"What do you expect todo in Chicago?"
"Do everything in our power to save
the party and protect the country. That
is the plain duty of every Democrat who
goes to Cuicago, and it is none the less the
duty of those who stay at home not to
hamper the efforts of those who so. And
by those who stay at home, I mean not
merely Democrats. I mean to include
every good citizen regardless of politics or
prejudices. The crisis which has come
upon us is the most serious menace to
National prosperity and to the welfare of
the people since 18G0. This is the time
when all men who love their country must
stand together to avert, if possible, public
disgrace and the wreck of hundreds of
thousands of homes throughout the coun
try."
"Do you not despair of success, then?"
"No; we cannot tell whether the knowl
edge of the attitude of Eastern Democrats
will affect the determination of the South-
em and Western Democrats who have not
known until -within the oast week how
strong the feeling here is. The vigorous
expression- of our position may cause hesi
tation, especially among the rank and file
of the Democracy, who I cannot believe
want to drive all Eastern Democrats out
of the party. I know some of the leaders
of the movement assume that attitude,
but I am not yet convinced that the peo
ple behind them do. If not, they will
make their wishes known and felt."
THURMAN'S STATEMENT.
Says That Such Interviews as
Whitney's Will Not Frighten
Any One.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 27.â After read
ing an interview given by ex-Secretary
Whitney in New York to-day, in which
Mr. Whitney said there seemed to be no
hope of saving the Democratic party from
disruption unless thÃ Southern and West
ern Democrats would listen to reason on
the coinage question, Allen W Thurman
gave out the following statement to-night:
There is now going on in this country an ir
repressible conflict between the British stand
ard (gold) on tne one side and the American
6tÂ»ndard (gold and silver), the money guar
anteed by the Constitution, on the other. Shall
the Democratic party declare in Its platform
that it favors a violation of the Constitution;
that the people shall not obey it unless the
Governments of Europe give them permission
to do so?
This is what all the talk about an Inter
national agreement really means; this is what
the Republican party said at St. Louis. Shall
the Democratic party merely re-echo the voice
of the Republican party on a question that
cannot be suppressed and which will over
shadow all others in tbe coming campaign? If
so, why should we go to Chicago at all?
Such interviews as Mr. Whitney's will
frighten no one. On the contrary, they only
intensify tbe issue, and his writing about the
dishonesty of those who differ with him will
only make them more determined. The silver
men of tbe West and South have long known
that the Democrats of Mr. Whitney's school
would much prefer seeing a gold Republican
President rather than a silver Democrat in the
Presidential chair. Mr. Whitney's interview
will maket this perfectly clear to every delegate
who will be at Chicago, and while all will re
gret that Mr. Whitney has determined to ieave
the party they will bear it rather than to pui
their principles into his keeping.

BLAND AND HIS BOOMERS
They Will Invade Chicago and Cer-
talnly Be Heard During the
Convention.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., June 27.âEx-Congress
man R. P. Bland, Governor William J.
Stone and several other free- silver Demo
crats of prominence arrived here to-day
from Lebanon, Mo., the home of Mr.
Bland. On the uubject of his personal
connection with the work of the Chicago
convention Mr. Bland declined to talk.
He was confident a free-silver platform
would be adopted. He gave his opinion
of the New York platform as follows: "It
is as good as any Republican platform. It
simply uses the old international bimetal
lism theory to cover up the tracks of the
gold bugs."
Mr. Bland would not venture an opin
ion as to the location of the real battle.
He even thought Democratic chances good
in New York.
Governor Stone was more communica
tive. He was asked if the two-thirds rule
would be abrogated at Chicago.
"I don't know as to that. lam of the
opinion that two things must be carried
through, the 16 to 1 platform and the
nomination of Bland, and whatever ought
to be done to bring that about should be
done."
The Governor leaves for Chicago Mon
day night. The Bland headquarters at
the Auditorium, Chicago, will be opened
Monday by Colonel Nick Bell.
Bland's boom for the nomination will
be reinforced by 2000 Missourians, mem
bfcrs of different Bland clubs. A special
train will carry them north on July 5.
These clubs are uniformed and drilled and
in the matter of shouting and music will
surely be heard.
COOK COUNTY POPULISTS.
They Give an Ovation to National
Chairman Taubeneck and
Elect Delegates.
CHICAGO, 111., June 27.â Three hun
dred delegates, representing the People's
party of Cook County, assembled in con
vention here to-day. H. E. Taubeneck,
chairman of the National Committee, was
one of the diotinpuished Populists en the
platform. He not only took away with
him to St. Louis to-night the pleasant
memory of tributes paid to his fidelity by
other party leaders, but he received the
hilarious plaudits of the delegates and a
unanimous vote of confidence by resolu
tion. Every mention of his name and his
acts as a Populist evoked the enthusiasm
of the convention.
When Mr. Taubeneck rose to respond he
expressed his confidence, but he made no
direct reference to the St. Louis Teller in
cident, in approval of which the demon
strations were made. He said a crisis was
on the party at the present time, and the
party was lacing it. There was enough
generalship and enough statesmanship in
the ranks of the party to steer it through
to safety, no matter how many rocks it
might encounter.
"Tne bolt of the silver Republicans at
St. Louis," continued the National chair
man, amid an outburst of applause,
"practically assures us of the vote of every
Presidential elector west of the Mississippi
River. It insures us of the success of all
of our legislative, Congressional and State
tickets, and that section of the country
from henceforth bfeiOiigs to the Populist
column.
"When the DernociaM'c convention ad
journs in Chicago next month the result of
their action will be that the territory south
of the Ohio River will also belong to the
People's party. A.t our convention in St.
Louis there will be no surrender of party
rights, of party name or party principles."
Dr. Howard S. Taylor, chairman oi the
County Central Committee, who was also
chosen permanent chairman of the con
vention, was the object of a demonstration
as flattering as that accorded to Mr. Tau
beneck.
By unanimous resolution the twenty
two delegates were chosen to represent
the county at the St. Louis convention,
and are also requested to use all their ef
forts with the Illinois delegates to obtain
for Dr. Taylor the second place on the
National ticket.
Dr. Taylor is a Chicago lawyer, who has
been an active leader of the party since its
birth, and Chairman Taubeneck in his
speech expressed the hope that the con
vention's choice would be nominated and
elected.
Dr. Taylor and Christopher O'Brien
were tne two chosen delegates at large.
The sentiment of all the speeches was for
independent action at St. Louis.
TELLER NOT TALKATIVE.
Says He Is in No Sense of the
Word a Candidate for the
Presidency.
MORRISON, 111., June 27.â Senator
Teller has been quietly resting here since
the day after tha St. Louis convention.
His aged mother, one brother, several sis
ters and any number of relatives reside at
Morrison and in Whiteside County. A
heavy mail has followed Teller. He ad
mits that many of the epistles received
speak of him in connection with the Pres
idency. This was in answer to a question
put to him : "I am in no sense of the
word a candidate."
"But you could not refuse a nomination
were it tendered?"
"It has not been offered," was tho
answer. "No man has a right to say he
will accept or decline an honor before it is
offered."
"You must know that your friends are
working to have you nominated at Chicago,
and with the ultimate hope that all the
silver forces may combine on you before
the end of July."
"My good friends are enthusiastic for
me, and I have had intimations that a
movement is on foot to present my name,
but I prefer not to discuss the matter in
the papers. You can readily see that in
my position it would be indelicate for me
10 express opinions personal to myself."

ST. LOUIB, Mo., June 27.â J. H. Mc-
Dowell, who will be sergeant-at-arms of

Mr. McDowell says he expects 30,000 Pop
ulists in the city during tbe convention,
besides many silver men who are not al
lied with the party. There will be 1375
delegates present.

OMAHA, Nebr., June 27.â The World-

STRUCK A SUNKEN BARGE
The Big Cunarder Umbria
Meets With a Peculiar
Mishap.
But the Vessel Is Soon Cleared and
Being Uninjured Proceeds on
the Voyage.
QUARANTINE. S. 1., June 27.â The big
Cunarder Umbria, Captain Dutton, which
left her pier in New York city at 9 o'clock
this morning with over 700 "first and sec
ond class passengers, met with a mishap
before she had cleared the bar at Sandy
Hook which delayed her twelve hours.
The steamer had swung from her pier on
the first ebb tide and had made a quick
trip down the bay, passing this place
three-quarters of an hour sfter leaving her
dock. She proceeded rapidly along the
channel under the guidance of Pilot Jo
siah John and had reached a point about
two miles off Sandy Hook when she struck
a snag in the shape of a sunken coal barge
in the middle of Gedney's channel aud was
soon hard aground.
There was much confusion for a time on
the decks of the liner, which were crowded
with passengers taking a lajt look at the
receding shores, but Captain Dutton and
his officers quickly reassured them aud
they philosophically accepted the situa
tion.
The vessel struck the sunken barge at
10:15 o'clock this morning when the tide
was pretty near at the full, so there was
nothing to do but to wait for the high tide
this evening. The wreckers bad every
thing in readiness by 8 o'clock and it was
then decided to try to eet the vessel off.
The tugs got in position, and, aided by the
steamer's own screws, the work was
begun.
After half an hour of tugging and pull
ing the steamer slid off the barge on which
she had been resting in deep water and
immediately started for the open sea. The
vessel proceeded just outside the bar and
at 9 :33 dropped anchor.
The wrecking tugs followed her out to
sea and Captain Everett, the diver, was
sent down to examine her hull. After a
careful examination, lasting over an hour,
he reported that the ship had sustained no
damage. Aa the shin was making no
water it was evidently decided on to con
tinue the voyage, for shortly after 10:30
o'clock the anchors were hauled in, the
ship headed due east and the voyage to
the other side beeran.
TWO BURGLARS SHOT.
Surprised by the Police They , Fought
IV\th Revolver*.
CHICAGO, 111., June 27.â Two burglars
were shot and perhaps fatally wounded
to-night while at work in a house at 2C5
Chestnui street. At a late hour word was
received at the East Chicago avenue sta- 1
tion that burglars were breaking into a j
Chestnut-street house and that the occu- j
pants were out attending some entertain- j
ment. Officers were dispatched to tne j
scene and surprised the burglars at work, j
A great number of shots were exchangea.
No officers were hurt, but both burglars
were wounded and sent to the hospital.
Chestnut street is a fashionable residence
district.
One of the burglars was recognized as
Dan Carey, a well-known thief. He will
die. The other is a tough character by the
name of Brown. It is believed he will
recover.

rcoryrlght 1896 by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Ehg., June 27. â Poor Mr.
Balf ur, having been forced to exhibit
hirr-elf in the penitential sheet, candle in
hard, for a sufficient period to enable his
whole party and the public generally to
digest the fact of his unfitness for the
command, it is now smart Mr. Chamber
lain's turn to claim popular attention
and show what a different sort of person
he is.
To-day's announcement that the Char
tered Company directors have finally been
squeezed into dismissing Rhodes, Belt and
Harris furnishes an effective overture for
next week's performance, in wnich the
Brummagem star will have the limelight
all to himself. Labouchere's question, â 
put down for Monday, as to what steps the
Government has taken to insure itself
against financial loss in South Africa,
may Dring on a big disclosure of Cham
berlain's policy or the revelation may
come a little later. The question is a
most pertinent one, because the com
pany's liabilities are by its charter limited
to the amount of its paid-up capital,
whereas it purports to be assuming re
jponsibility, not only for the Transvaal
indemnities, but for the enormous outlay
involved in righting the revolted blacks
in Rhodesia, which must amount to a
great deal more than the company can
pay.
Even before these troubles began experts
beid that the Chartered Company's
finances were in a very queer state, and it
is foreseen now that bankrnptcy is in
evitable unless the Government comes to
tbe aid of the company. Presumably
there will be a loud and strenuous appeal
for this from the interested parties, who
possess immense social and political in
fluence; but it is certain that the demand
will be vehemently resisted by the Lib
erals, who would have an overwhelming
popular majority with them. This pro
vides a situation just after Chamberlain's
own t cart, one in which dexterity of
movement and a high order of cunning
a/c more iur^jrtant than the soiider quali
ties, and he is said to believe that he is go
me to emerge from the ordeal with colors
flying, at least that is what his backers at
Birmingham all believe.
They are saying, too, without conceal
ment, that the time is close at hand for
Balfour to make a graceful withdrawal
from the scene which is too rough and exi
gent for his delicate nerves, and to let
Chamberlain come into his own. Tnis
talk is now so loud that the Tories can no
longer profess not to hear it, and it puts
them in- a perplex'ng quandary. They
themselves say in almost so many words
that Balfour is "no good" as a leader, but
the alternative of Chamberlain, which
they now see is imperative, frightens
them. They ail say they would not serve
under him, and probably this is true of
at least enough of them to destroy the
present Ministerial majority. On the
other hand it is manifest that Balfour is
the only Tory in the House of Commons
whom Chamberlain would consent to re
gard as his leader. If Balfour goes Cham
berlain must come, and the perception of
this fact is rendered doubly bitter by the
knowledge that Chamberlain is all the
while undermining Balfour, weakening
nim and prying him out of his place. It
is a very curious situation, all things con
sidered.
It is expected that next week we shall
learn what the Government, that is to say,
Chamberlain, proposes to do in the way of
preparing for the trial and punishment of
Rhodes and his confederates. A variety
of methods of procedure are open, but the
London Times predicts that the one
adopted will be a commission of both
houses nominated by the Lord Chancellor
and the Speaker, with Chamberlain as
chairman. Tie objections to this will be
that the Lords are open to a good deal of
suspicion of prejudice in the Chartered
Company's favor, and there is also the
difficulty about finishing the inquiry
before the session comes to an end. The
general House of Commons opinion is
that there will be a royal commission of
three Judges, as in the Parnell case, and
it is understood that they will be Russell,
Hawkins and Pollock. There is the fur
ther complication of the Jameson trial,
which ougiit to be finished before the
other inquiry is begun. It is now under
stood, however, that if their technical ob
jection to the jurisdiction of the London
court fails, Jameson and his colleagues
will at once plead guilty, thus obviating
the necessity for a long trial.
The conflagration which threatent the
existence of the Ottoman empire con
tinues to be smothered in one place only
to break out in another. The Cretan re
volt for the moment seems to be under
partial control, but there are new and
threatening outbursts of disorder in the
Van district of Anatolia and among the
Druses of Lebanon. By the time these are
stamped out it looks as if Macedonia
would be on fire. Vienna is getting re
ports of outrages and revolts in various
parts of Macedonia, which point to the
conciusion that the general rising which
has been organized so long can hardly be
restrained now. Besides, although every
body says that Russia is intent upon
restraining it, nobody can prove tbe state
ment.
Prince Nicholas of Montenegro began a
visit to the King of feervia at Belgrade to
day. It is to be returned next month, and
ail the other small courts of Eastern Eu
rope are agog with rumors of an impend
ing Balkan confederation under the aetute
leadership of Ferdinand of Bulgaiia
which shall do all sorts of wonderful
things under the patronage of Russia.
M. de Blowitz records from Paris the
discovery that Russia has about decided
to come to the assistance of France in the
Egyptian business and try to secure the
consent of all the Continental powers to a
plan for neutralizing the Kbedive's terri
tory, which would have the effect of driv
ing England out. What basis the story
has there is no means of judging, but it
does not sound unlikely.
One of the nicest things about the
Prince of Wales has always been his pub
lic attitude of admiration and affection for
Gladstone. Even in the hottest stage of
the swell mob's fury against that states
man when they called Gladstone "the
murderer of Gordon" and "a traitor to the
union," the Prince kept his head and
found numerous graceful little ways to let
it be seen that he had no sympathy with
this violent discourtesy. Tnere used to be
stories afloat of his sharply rebuking the
men of his set, who imagined that he would
be pleased to hear them insult the "G.
O. M."
Of course, this was always open to the
explanation that the Prince merely obeyed
the law, which impels heirs to thrones to
be in opposition to the crown, and that he
made a show of a great liking for Glad
stone chiefly because his royal mother
made no secret of her loathing and hatred
of the Liberal leader, but those who know
best always insist that the Prince's ex
pressions of feeling on this subject are
genuine and profound, and certainly his
fervent eulogy of Gladstone and his wife,
made in their presence at the great Welsh
university gathering at Aberystwith yester
day seemed to come from the heart. It
was greeted with wild and prolonged
cheering by the Welshmen, and every
where to-day, even in the Tory papers, it
is alluded to as a very timely and popular
performance on th^ part of the Prince.
Gladstone himself appeared with his right
eye covered and leaning heavily on a
stick, but he spoke fluently and with much
of his old voice.
The statement from Washington that
the British Embaasador had asked Secre
tary Olney's intervention to secure riarri
son's release by the Venezuelans was re
ceived here with quite general approba
tion. 'I have seen no adverse comment
in any quarter, but on the other hand
many expressions of the opinion that this
is the way matters should stand between
the two great English-speaKing peoples
when the affairs of the New World are in
volved. This is practical proof of what
these dispatches always insisted on: that
nothing would de'ight the English more
than formally to concede our primacy in
the Western Hemisphere if they could be
sure that they would then be treate 1 like
blood relations and friends, instead of as
hated rivals.
Nobody here is really sorry for the
smashup of the old Conservative gang in
Canada. Some of the more zealous Tory
journals profess conventional regret, but
it is palpably perfunctory. Canada for a
lons time has been a source of much dis
appointment to Englishmen.
Tney have resented its narrowness, its
mental sterility and its ingrained provin
cialism all the more because comparisons
with the States suggested themselves con
tinually and almost invariably to the pre
judices of the Dominion. Hence Laurier's
triumph is hopefully laid hold upon as a
promise of new blood and new ideas in
Canada. The average Briton would really
prefer, I believe, a restive or even a muti
nous Canada, which produced the effect of
animation and brain power, than the kind
of apathetic, backward, Orange-ndden
community he fancies the real Canr.da to
be.
The success of the deceased wife's sister
bill on second reading in the House of
Lords possesses only an abstract interest.
It cannot possibly get to a vote in the
Commons, even if the Bishops do not suc
ceed in drumming: up a majority to kill it
in the House of Lords on third reading.
The debate on it this year was much less
entertaining than usual, and the reason
ing of its opponents certainly much more
difficult to understand.
After reading carefully all their speeches
one's mind remains quite blank as to why
they really object to the change. The
nearest approach to a practical argument
continues to be the old point: if the pro
hibition is lifted single women will come
to live with their married sisters and
poison them in order to secure the hus
bands for themselves. This theory is
stated now with less bluntness than for
merly. But it is evidently still enter
tained, and even the Archbishop of Can
terbury allows it to be understood that he
holds it.
Many interesting reports are coming by
mail from Russia about the big strike in
the cotton and woolen mills in and about
St. Petersburg. At one time it is said
40,000 workmen were out, and apparently
half that number are still obdurately idle.
The censorship will allow nothing to be
telegraphed about it or to be printed in
the Russian papers, which fact, perhaps,
prompts the correspondents and others to
exaggerate the importance of the thing.
It seems, however, that many secret proc
lamations of nihilistic orders have been
circulated among the strikers, and that
this discovery of a way by which the police
can be defied by the organized proletariat
has created a great impression in Russia.
The strikers, simply by keeping away
from the mills and even declining to go
and get the wages due them, have baffled
the authorities. The latter would have
known well enough how to deal with any
assemblage of the people by turning loose
on it the mounted Cossacks with their
whips, but they are powerless to deal with
a moujik who merely stays at home. The
plan is to send all the strikers back to
their native villages with their personal
rights to travel in the empire abridged,
but this will only spread the story of a
successful labor demonstration all over
the country and put a swarm of new ideas
in the heads of the rural peasantry.
There has also come from tne Russian
capital reflections of vague rumors that
Nicholas II is in a state of physical col
lapse, due to the terrible strain of the
Moscow fortnight and that there is some
occasion for thÂ« fear that he is not going
to get strong again. An official dispatch
says that he is suffering from jaundice,
but gossip hints that this malady was se
lected for the bulletins in order to explain
the changes in the Czar's personal aspect
"which can no longer be concealed.
Sir Augustus Harris was really one of
London's most noted public men, and it
was quite fitting that he should have had
a funeral to-day exceeding in display and
numbers anything the metropolis had
seen for a long time. It may be
said with literal truth that he killed
himself by overwork. It had grown
to be a mania with him to accumulate
responsibilities wherever opportunity
offered, and toward the end he did this
with hardly any reference as to whether
there was profit in tbem or not. Thus he
finally piled up a burden so huge that no
human being could live under it. Yet I
bear that it is a matter of profound uncer
tainty whether he leaves a penny of per
soDal fortune. He made a deed of gift to
his wife a while ago, however, represent
ing a considerable sum, and probably the
public will never know just where he
stood financially.

MINSTRELL RY MAN'S SUICIDE.
Closes an Eventful Career by Inhaling the
Gas Through a Rubber Tube.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 27.-Edward,
better known as "Ad" Ryman, the minstrel
and negro delineator, who was well known
in the theatrical profession and all over tbe
country as "Governor Ad Ryman," was
found dead to-day in his room at his
boarding-house, 242 East Sixtieth street.
He had committed suicide by inhaling gas
through a rubber tube attached to a gas
jet.
Ryman was 55 years oi age and was one
of the old-time negro minstrels. He had
been on the stage at least thirty years. He
was born in Ohio, At one time he was
connected with the old San Francisco
minstrels. His principal specialty was
making stump speeches and he was a
great favorite on the variety stage. His
last engagement was at Tony Pastor's dur
ing the week beginning May 4.
DEATH IN A COLLISION
Shocking Accident at a Colorado
Railway Water Tank
Station.
One Engineer Killedâ The Other, With
the Two Firemen, Seriously
Injured.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., June 27.â
The Union Pacific and Denver and Gulf
passenger, which left Denver this after
noon at 3:20 o'clock, collided with a stand
ing switch engine at Bierstadt, a watering
tank station, twelve miles east of this city.
Engineer Michael Shannon of the passen
ger train was instantly killed and Fireman
Collins and Baggageman Davis seriously,
if not fatally injured. Engineer O'Rourke
and the fireman of the switch engine were
seriously injured by the water tank col
lapsing.
The Denver passenger train was reported
eleven minutes late and as a consequence
Engineer O'Rourke of the switch engine
stopped his engine at the tank and began
taking water. There is a heavy curve just
behind the water tank which completely
hides it from the southbound trains. The
accident was caused by either the switch
engine overstaying its time at the tank or
the passenger making up lost time.
The passenger train was running at the
rate of thirty miles an hour. Engineer
Shannon did not see the standing switch
engine until he was almost upon it.
He quickly reversed the engine, but it
was too late to prevent an awful head-on
collision. Shannon was instantly killed,
while his fireman received probably fatal
wounds. Engineer O'Rourke and his fire
man saw tr.e flying passenger train just in
time and jumped under the water-tank,
which collapsed from the force of the col
lision. The passenger cars were badly
broken, but fortunately none of the thirty
passengers on board received more than a
severe shaking up. The body of Engineer
Shannon was brought to this city. He
lived in Denver and leaves a family. The
injured trainmen were brought to this
city.
SANTA TERESA'S POPULARITY.
The Banished Maiden Positively Declines
President Diaz's Invitation to
Return to Mexico.
EL PASO, Tex., June 27.â Santa Teresa
is still the center of attraction in El Paso.
Yesterday morning ex-Governor Lauro
Carrillo of Chihuahua, now a Mexican
Senator, arrived in this city from Mexico's
capital, the bearer of a message from Presi
dent Diaz to Teresa. The Senator, in com
pany with Francisco Mallen, Mexican Con
sul at El Paso, the Federal Judge and Pre
fect of Police from Juarez, Mexico, called
on Santa Teresa and had a long chat with
her.
- It was learned that the purport of the
message of Senator Carrillo was that
President Diaz, realizing the great
power and popularity of Teresa with
the masses of Mexico, and fearing that
the lower classes might hatch up a
revolution through the impression that
Teresa is expatriated by the authorities,
extends a cordial invitation to Teresa and
her father to come to Mexico, under the
guarantee of full personal liberty and the
protection of the Government.
After hearing the President's message
through, the banished maiden replied
courteously that she would never again
enter Mexico while President Diaz was in
power.
There is no denying that she has effected
some wonderful cures. Inquiries are pour
ing in from afflicted persons in California,
Louisiana, New Mexico and Colorado.
Captain Isaiah Weston is reported to have
been cored of paralysis by Teresa.

GOOD PROGRESS
IN THE REICHSTAG.
Certain That the New Code
Bill Will Become
a Law.
AS TO CIVIL MARRIAGE.
German Statesmen Now Propose
to Make the Action
Compulsory.
HERBERT BISMARCK BOLTS.
Follows the Diiections of His Vener
able Father and Causes a
Sensation.
BEKLIN, Germany, June 27.âThrough
jut the week the Reichstag has made good
progress in its consideration of the Gov-
ernment's civil code bill, and the measure,
which passed its second reading this after
noon, is now certain to pass all of the
itages necessary for it to become a law be-
fore the end of the present session. The
only debates that have attracted even a
partly full house this week have been upon
those clauses of the civil code bill relating
to civil marriage and the property rights
of married women and the game laws.
The bill proposes to make civil marriages
compulsory, and in opposing this provi
sion Dr. Lieber, the leader of the Centrists,
expressed regret that the committee to
which the bill was referred had not treated
marriage as a sacrament to which the
assent of the civil authorities was neces
sary.
Other Centrist deputies as well as Gen
eral yon Roen and several other Conserva
tives supported the view of Dr. Lieber,
holding that tbe civil marriage clause was
derogatory to the ollice of the clergy.
Herr Niberling. Imperial Minister of Jus
tice, denied that the Government had any
desire to place a mere civil marriage upon
an equal footing with a religious ceremony,
nor did they wish to come into conflict
with the churches; yet for many reasons,
ho said, it was desirable that the clause
should be maintained. The clause finally j
passed.
The Centrists afterward scored a vic
tory, however, by succeeding in having
eliminated from the bill the provision
making incurable insanity a ground for
divorce. A motion offered by Herr
Bebel, socialist, giving married women
control over their own property, was re
jected, but another socialist amendment
fixing twenty-one years as the limit of
age, beyond which parental consent to
marry was not required, was adopted.
Prince B-smurck is of opinion that the
civil code ought to have received more
mature consideration, and as a protest
against the hurried munner in which the
iill was handled the ex-Chancellor di-
rected Count Herbert Bismarck, his
eldest son, to leave the House when the
f first vote upon the measure was taken in
fetie Reichstag. This direction was obeyed,
I und Count Herbert's demonstration in
leaving the chamber, followed by ten
Conservative Deputies, created a mo
mentary sensation.
Prince Hohenlohe's parliamentary din
ner, which was given by the Chancellor
Tuesday evening, is still being talked
about as having been sparsely attended in
contrast to the ministerial dinners given
during the period of Prince Bismarck's
occupancy of the office of Imperial Chan
celler, at which the fate of Parliamentary
measures was wont to De decided. The
presence of Dr. Stocker, ex-court chap
lain, bearing very lightly his fall from
court and political party favor, was also
noticed and commented upon. Another
subject of comment upon the occasion was
the attendance of Baron Riedel, Finance
Minister of the kingdom of Bavaria, who
is associated with a project for the conver
sion of the imperial securities, a fact
which is most remarkable in that the
scheme has hitherto been strongly op
posed by the Bavarian Government.
Prince Hohenlohe la conversation at the
dinner expressed his satisfaction at the
prospects of the passage of the civil code
bill, and also at the general condition of
Germany and the pacific aspect of tnings
abroad.
The Chancellor, however, could not be
drawn into any expression of opinion, or
indeed any reference whatever to the re
ported negotiations on the part of Ger
many with France and England upon the
question of the summoning of an inter
national monetary conference. Neverthe
less, it is reported in official circles that
overtures have been made throug h Count
yon Hatzfeldt, German Embassador to
Great Britain, to induce Lord Salisbury to
send delegates to such a convention. The
fact that the Emperor has ordered from
London a small collection of books on the
subject of the currency, which it is his
Majesty's purpose to study during his
coming Nordland tour, has lent color to
the prevailing rumors that the Govern
ment is now making an effort to satisfy
the demand of the bimetallists for a
conference.
The decision of the international com
mission upon agriculture, sitting in France,
reauesting the French Government to con
voke an international monetary confer
ence, has creatly strengthened the hopes
of tlte German bimetallists that the pres
ent negotiations to that end will be suc
cessful.
The Emperor will start from Kiel on
July f, on board the imperial yacht Hohen
zollern, upon a voyage in northern Nor
way seas. The yacht will be accompanied
by the German cruiser Geflon, and the trip
will last six weeks. King Oscar of Swe
den-Norway will meet bis Majesty at
Christiania.
The United States Consuls and Vice-
Consuis in Germany will hold a business
meeting at the United States consulate in
Berlin ou July 4, after which they will at
tend the official reception which will ,be
given by United States Embassador Uh!.
The American pnysicians and dentists
in Berlin will celebrate the day by holding
a picnic at Grunau after attending Mr.
Uhl's reception.

p. m. to-day, the tin plate workers and
makers were unable to agree, and on
Tuesday night of next week all of the tin
mills will close, pending- a settlement. The
manufacturers have asked for another

TIDAL WAVES
VISIT HAWAII
Much Damage to Property,
but No Loss of
Life.
DEEP EBBS AND FLOWS.
Convulsions Thought to Have

Japan.
THE LEGISLATURE ADJOURNS.
Grape Wines Will Enter Free, While
Japanese Rice Wines Are
Heavily Taxed.
HONOLULU, Hawaii. June 20.â A
succession of heavy tidal waves struck
the western side of the island of Hawaii
on the 15th, doing much damage to prop
erty, but causing no loss of life. The first
wave struck Xawaihae at 8:15 a. m., de
molishing the wharf, and Kailua, thirty
miles south, at 8:30, destroying lumber
yards and flooding the lower floor of Miss
Paris' hotel.
After damaeing various wharves and
landings on the Kona coast the tides
rounded the south point, striking the Kau
landings at 9:40 a. m., but doing little
damage. Hilo was reached at 10 a. m., the
water rising only eight feet and doing no
serious damage.
In bays on the Kona coast the sea came
up to points twenty and thirty feet above
mean tide. The tides continued to come
in all day at half-hour intervals of ebb
and flow.
Although the indications are that these
waves came from the northwest, Honolulu
harbor experienced but slight effect. Our
tide-gauge records fourteen small tidal
waves of about one foot in height, lasting
from 7A.M.t02 p. m. of the 15th. At ihe
narrow head of tne I. arbor there was an
alarming succession of deep ebbs and
flows every half hour.
At harbors on the east side of Kauai the
sea ebbed and flowed so as seriously to
molest vessels and boats, and fishpond
walls are reported to have been broken
away at the southwest point of Maui.
No satisfactory theory is advanced as to
the location of the terrestrial convulsion
causing these waves. It is supposed to lie
in a northwest direction, possibly in Japan.
The Hawaiian Legislature adjourned on
the 15th. The President vetoed the sake
bill which raised to 60 cents a gallon the
duty upon still wines made of materials
other tt an grapejuice of under 14 per cent
alcoholic strength, and to $1 for all be
tween 14 and 21 per cent. This law was
intended to affect Japanese sake or rice
wine. This is now imported Jn immense
quantities at very low prices and contains
a large amount of poisonous methylic
alcohol, which is especially injurious to
the native Hawaiians.
Both Houses immediately passed the
bill over the President's veto, with but one
dissenting vote, and grape wines accord
ingly enter free, while sake has a heavy
duty.
The reason alleged for the President's
veto was "rhe serious hardship to Japan
ese of small means of increasing the cost
of their accustomed stimulant."
The President was believed to have been
influenced by strong protests from [the
Japanese Consul and merchants. He is
naturally anxious to avoid any cause of
collision with Japan, whose attitude to
ward Hawaii is covertly menacing.
The Legislature has repealed the regis
tration act, which had been passed two
months before without serious opposition.
On putting it into execution a popular
clamor arose against the thumb-marks as
an indignity, and against all registration
as belonging to despotism. The natives
were also taught that the measure was s
covert means of compelling them to sup
port the republic and became much agi
tated. It was thought best, therefore, to
repeal the act.

HAVANA, Cuba, June 27. â Advicei
have been received here to the effect that
Brigadier-General Melquizo will positively
be promoted to major-general.
The Farnesio squadron, while operatine
near Capellanis, province of Havana, met
a large rebel force under Cullazo. A tierce
engagement followed, in which the rebels
lost twenty-one killed and many wounded.
The troops lost seven wounded.
General Melquizo is at present in com
mand of the troops in the southern part of
the province of Pinar del Rio. He has
gained most unenviable notoriety through
his killing of inoffensive paciflcos â men,
women and children.
It was by his orders that Dr. Delgado
was shot, and he was also responsible for
the Camp Florida massacre. Many tales
have been told of his lust and, the charge
that tie had butchered hundreds of per

beyond a shadow of a douDt. He is to be
honored by promotion on the recommen

THE CAPTURED FILIBUSTERS.
lirouyht Back to Key West, but ->o
C'finrge Made Against Them.
KEY WEST, Fla., June 27.â The reve
nue cutter Winona on Thursday afternoon
sighted the steamer City of Richmond
coming out of Biscayne Bay. The Rich
mond had been into Miami and landed
several hundred crates of freight, and was
on her way to Key West. The cutter sig
naled the steamer to heave to. Lieuten
ant Hay was then sent on board, and ex
amined her papers, and found that she
had no license. Her passenger list was
defective,. and he also found 449 cases of
ammunition on board. Hay returned to
the cutter and reported the fact to Captain
Gooding, who ordered Lieutenant Hay
and a prize crew from the cutter to seize
the Richmond and proceed to Key West.
Yesterday the Richmond started on her
way to Key West, and when off Alligator
Light a small steamer was sighted.
Changing the course of the Richmond,
they came within hailing distance of the
vessel, which proved to be the Three
Friends. A small boat put off from the
Three Friends and started toward the
Richmond, when some one on the latter
vessel gave warning and the boat put
back. Lieutenant Hay signaled the Rich
mond to be stopped and went on board
the Three Friends. After examining her
papers he informed Captain Broward he
was under arrest.
The cutter coming up later, Lieutenant
Myrick was sent on board the Three
Friends and the three vessels started for
Key West. On board the Three Friends
was Dr. Castillo, surgeon of the Jeanette
expedition and prominently identified
with the Cuban cause, being secretary of
the Cuban Junta. At a hearing to-day
before the United States Commissioner
there was no charge made against either
vessel.
WILL INVESTIGATE
The Treasury Department to Look Into
the Matter.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 27.â The
Treasury Department to-day was officially
advised that the steamers Three Friends
and City of Richmond were detained at
Key West, Fla., on the ground that they
were about to engage in a filibustering
expedition to Cuba. The vessels were
overhauled at sea by the revenue cutter
Winona last evening. On the City of
Richmond were 400 cases of arms and am
munition and on the Three Friends a party
of forty men, among whom was Secretary
Castillo of the Cuban Junta in this coun
try. The United States District Attorney
will investigate the matter and decide
whether they should be prosecuted for
violating the neutrality laws.

CHICAGO, 111,, June 27.â An assembly
of notable men, principally Judges, law
yers and statesmen, gathered at the late
residence of Lyman Trumbull this after
noon to pay the last, tribute of respect to
tbe dead jurist and statesman. All the
Circuit and Superior Court Judges ad
journed their courts at noon as a tofcen of
respect and attended the obsequies. The
Chicago Bar Asssociation sent a large
delegation. Many of the men and women
present were of advanced years and bad
lived through the times the departed had
helped to make famous.
Rev. H. W. Thomas, who was his pas
tor, delivered a tender and poetic eu
logy, calling the Senator the greatest of
Chicago's citizens, whose name was writ
ten high on the roll of honor in his life
time by deeds as well as words â the ideal
American statesman, whose sole purpose
was to serve the people.

CHICAGO'S HOLD ROBBERS.
The Thirteenth of a Series of Successful
Hold- Vps.
CHICAGO, 111., June 27. â The thir
teenth of a series of hold-ups which have
been taking place here at regular intervals
for the past few weeks was accomplished
this evening within a half-block of the
Harrison-atmet police station ana the
police ara still looking for the men who 3O
openly defy them. Tne same tactics were
used rrt in the other twelve cases.
Two men at 10 o'clock to-night entered
the slioestore of A. Ruppert, at U36 Harri
son street, and with two revolvers each
compelled the cashier to empty his cash
drawer and hand out its contents. Fortu
nately the day's receipts were in the vault,
and only $20 was secured by the robbers.
As soon" as the two men got possession of
their plunder they ran out and down an
alley, and their whereabqutÃ is at present
unk-nown. The description of the men
tallies with that of the men who have
been systematically robbing stores for the
past few weeks.

NEWS OF LOS ANGELES
Decorator Adams Sues the City
Clerk to Obtain Fiesta
Finery.
Heavy Crop of Oranges Throughout
the Countyâ Mrs. Forbes Keeps
Her Children.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 27.â The
fiesta decorations used on the City Hall
are causing tne City Clerk no end of
trouble. Sam Adams, the decorator,
claims that a part of the lumber and bunt
ing is his private property. When Clerk
Charles Luckenbach put the aforemen
tioned property away under lock and key
to-day Adams got out a search warrant
charging Luckenbach, Beena and John
Roe with secreting hia property.
The City Clerk laughs at the affair, arid
says that Adams is disappointed because
he failed to get the contract for decorating
the City Hall for the Fourth of July.
He claims that the city owned all the
lumber and that he offered to let Adams
take off such bunting that he had tacked
onto the lumber, but Adams demanded
all. He told Adams he would not get it
and the decorator swore that he would.
Luckenbach bad Mr. Bena lock up what
he believed to be the city property.
Adams says that he is not chagrined at
the loss of a contract. He merely wants
his property, which he values at ?100 or
$150.
THAT TOILED IN VAIN
Tunneling Bank Robbers Misjudged the
Location of the Vault.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 27.â The at
tempted robbery of the First National
Bank is still the topic of conversion.
Numerous residents on Commercial street
state that they were watching the move
ments of the detectives night after nieht,
so it is no wonder that the attempted rob
bery was made public property. The true
reason why the robbers pave up the job
was that they believed the vault extended
to the floor of the cellar, instead of rest
ing on the arch. When they discovered
their mistake they quit.
It is stated upon good authority that J.
Stevens, the man now in custody on sus
picion of being implicated in the at
tempted robbery, bag been confined to his
bed for the past two months from the ef
fects of an operation. It is believed he
will be released when the evidence is heard.
HEAVY CROP OF ORANGES.
Dealers in Fruit Pleased With the Pros-
pects for the Coming Season.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 27.â The
prospects for the coming year's orange
crop are exceedingly bright, and several
leading commission merchants and fruit
men have said that it is likely to be larger
than usual. In many parts of the citrus
belt the trees are blooming more pro
fusely than has been the case in twelve
years. There nas been more dropping of
fruit than usual at this time of year; on
the contrary the percentage which re
mains on tne trees is greater. The drop
ping is always large when the crop is a big
one. Mediterranean sweets and navels
are tne greatest sufferers. This rather un
usual condition has been caused by tbe
extremes of the weather which have
occurred during the last six months.

Mrs. Forbes Is Awarded the Custody of
Her Offspring.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 27.â Judge
Clark to-day awarded Mrs. Forbes tbe
custody of her two children. The woman's
mother, Mrs. Scott, and the latter's
brother had attempted to secure the
guardianship of the children, claiming
that Mrs. Forbes was an unsuitable person
to have charge of them. The mother said
that she had repeatedly seen Mrs. Forbes
sitting in the Jap of J. Quigley, hugging
and kissing him. The latter admitted all
this, but denied that anything improper
had occurred.
Judge Clarke decided that these little in
discretions were not of such a nature as to
prove that the morals of the children
would be injured by their being in the
custody of the mother.

TWO COAST RECORDS BROKEN
Herbert Greenland Bests Krelling of
San Francisco in a Wrest
ling Bout.
PORTLAND, Ob., Jane 27. â By a score
of 57 points to 44, the Multnomah Athletic
Club this afternoon defeated the Olympics
of San Francisco, after the most exciting
field contests that have ever been seen on
an athletic field in the Northwest. Tbe
Olympics were under some slight disad
vantages. Phil Wand, one of their best
men, was unable to take part in the con
test, his shoulder having been sprained in
a rough and tumble wrestling bout with
Krelling.
The Multnomah team failed to win the
events which had been conceded to the
California visitors. Edgren, the Berkeley
man, proved to be a wonder to the local
athletes in the throws, Flannagan, the
Multnomah man, going down before him
after a very stubborn contest.
Captain Len Gill's men fell down in the
sprints and gained but four victories out
of the thirteen events, with second place
in most of the others. It was in the
weight-putting and shot-tossing that they
prevented being taken into camp.
It was an iaeai day for cracking records.
A slight shower last evening had laid the
dust and the track was in first-class con
dition. It was hot enough to draw out the
athletes' best efforts.
Multomah field presented a pretty sight.
The field was a riot of colors, and over
2000 people passed through the gates. The
wildest enthusiasm prevailed. Charles
Dillon, an ex-Stanford man, led the ex-
Stanford and California contingent in the
chorus ot "rooters" for tho visitors.
Two coast records were broken. They
were the high jump and the mile run, the
championship for which is now held in
the North. The Mnltnomah phenomenon,
little Bert Kerrigan, broke his own record
made two weeks ago, by raising the run
ning high jump to 6 feet 2 inches.
The Pacific Northwest Association
records in the mile, the high jump, broad
jump and the weights â hammer and
shot â were smashed. The contest was
memorable for the remarkable perform
ances of the day, for even the local men
surprised themselves. William E. Tal
lant, the Astorian, broke the coast record
for a mile in the hottest race for the dis
tance ever seen on Multnomah field. The
time was reduced from 4:40 to 4:81 2-5.
Brown of the Olympics was beaten out by
seven yards in a magnificent spurt on the
stretch.
R. W. Edgren, tbe Olympic champion,
took the 16-pound hammer throw, the 16
-pound sbotput and the 56-pound weight
tossing. In this last event his opponent,
Flannagan, stopped at 25 feet 2% inches,
and Edgren put the weight 26 feet 6\4
inches, fairly outdoing himself.
In the 16-pound hammer throw Flan
nagan was beaten by a foul and the event
was given to Edgren. Flannagan threw
the hammer 129 feet 5% inches, btit It was
not allowed because his toe was pushed
over the mark. Edgreu's distance was
127 feet d% inches. Collins did not com
pete.
Edgren won the shotput on his sixth
and last throw, beating Flannagan, who
had it at 36 feet 5 inches. Edgren in his
last trial put the shot 36 feet 9 inches.
Patterson of the Olympics withdrew
from the 220-yard hurdle event, and Mor
gan took it in :26 3-5. There was no sec
ond. Patterson skipped the second Hurdle
and this threw him out of the race.
Brunton of California withdrew from
the pole event, leaving the contest to Ker
rigan and Watkins. Kerrigan won at 9
feet 4 inches.
In the 880-yard run, Tallant of the
Multnomahs and Dave Brown of the
Olympics ran together to the last lap. It
was a very pretty race. At the end of the
stretch Tallant spurted and beat by three
yards in 2:o4>Â£.
In the opening event, the running high
jump, Kerrigan and Patterson tied at 6
feet 2 inches. Patterson refused to jump
off the tie and left the field, and the event
was given to Kerrican.
The summary follows:
Running high jumpâ Bert Kerrigan, M. A.

FINED FOR RONDYISM
Five Players of the Cleveland Ball Team
Punished.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., June 27. â Five
players of the Cleveland ball team were
found guilty of breach of the peace In the
City Court this afternoon for their action
in yesterday's game with Louisville. Cap
tain Tebeau was fined $100, McKean and
McAleer $75 each and Burkett $60.
Dr. Thomas H. Btuckey, president of
the Louisville club, indignant over the
rowdyism of yesterday, this afternoon
swore out warrants against McKean, Mc-
Aleer, Burkett, Childs, O'Connor, Tebeau,
McGarr, Blake and Cuppy, who took part
in yesterday's game, charging them with
breach of the peace, with the intention of
having them arrested after the game. At
3 o'clock the Clevelands appeared at the
ball park.
It wag raining, and as it soon began to
pour down in torrents the game was called
off and the police presented warrants for
the Cleveland players.
With their uniforms on the players were
hustled â  into a bus and taken to the City
Court, where Judge R. H. Thompson was
in waiting. Judge Aaron Kohn, chairman
of the Board of Public. Works, conducted
the prosecution and the Cleveland play
ers were represented by Attorney Allen
Kinney. The testimony of the prosecution
showed that McAleer, Tebeau, McKean
and Burkett had heaped insults on Um
pire Weidman and that McAleer had
struck him.
Weidman testified that no one hit him,
but that lie was insulted and knocked
about, but he did not know by whom.
. The Cleveland players denied using vio
lence or offering insults, but Judge Thomp
son held that the testimony showed that
Tebeau, McAleer, McKean and Burkett
were guilty as charged in the warrants
and he assessed the fines mentioned, the
other players being dismissed without trial
except as to O'Connor, who was found not
guilty.
The attorney for the defense took an ap
peal to the Circuit Court, and after some
delay the Cleveland quartet gave bonds for
their appearance when required.
BASEBALL AT SANTA CRUZ.
Electrics Defeat the Cruiser Philadel-
phia's Svhe.re-Tossers.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 27. - All
Santa Cruz went to the ball game this
afternoon at Vue de l'Eau Park, for the
bluejackets from the war ships have be
come such favorites with Santa Cruzans
and the summer visitors that to have not
seen the Philadelphia's baseball team at
the national game would have been to
miss one of the biggest events of the pres
ent season.
The Philadelphia's boys, however, were
rather disappointing at baseball, scoring
only 3 runs to 12 by the Electrics, yet they
played an interesting game, and the
splendid music by the Philadelphia's bund
made up for their shortage of runs. The
Electrics, while proud of their victory,
would have graciously submitted to defeat
in deference to tbe desire of the big audi
ence of ladies to applaud the bluejackets.
Roberts for the Electrics pitched a fine
game, only four safe hits being made off
him. Babin. for the Phi!adelpiiias,
proved his skillfulness in the pitcher's
box, too, though he was not so successful
as Roberts. The Phiiadeiphias had some
excellent ball players in their team, but
some of their crack players were detained
at duty aboard ship. Tueir center fielder,
White, did excellent work, and their in
field playef3 were above the average.

ROMANCE OF PORTLAND
Rich Louie Thanhauser Sued for
Refusing to Wed Marie
Fately.
Fifty Thousand Dollars Demanded as
a Balm for Lacerated Affec*
tions.
PORTLAND, Or., June 27.â A sensa
tional lawsuit, with sensational testi
mony, will be heard in tbe Circuit Court
on Monday. Marie Fatly (nee Waters)
is the complainant, and Louie Than
hauser, a prominent merchant, is the de
fendant. Mrs. Fately wants $50,000 to heal
her lacerated heart.
For a number of years, the woman al
leges, she and Thauhauser lived together
as man and wife, though there was no
marriage ceremony. She asserts that
Thanhauser induced her to wed one
Thomas Fately of Sacramento, and after
ward persuaded her to procure a divorce
from her husband. After having been di
vorced she returned to Portland and again
began living with Thanhauser.
This state of affairs continued un
til the merchant became enamoured of
the wife of a San Francisco com
mercial traveler, and Marie was turned
out upon the cold world.
Thanhauser has numerous depositions
from men in Sacramento who claim that
Mrs. Fately's reputation there was unen
viable. Her attorney, George W. P.
Joseph, asserts that they are not at all
anxious on this score, as he has evidence
to prove that the men irom whom these
depositions were procured are unworthy
of belief.
The parties to this suit, which will be
contested inch by inch, are extensively
known here, and Thanhauser las a large
circle of acquaintances in San Francisco.

SAD ACCIDENT
AT SANTA CRUZ.
Jackson Crooks of Oakland
Receives a Dangerous
Wound.
STRUCK BY A BULLET.
He Lets a Revolver Fall to the
Floor and the Weapon Is
Discharged.
HAS SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LIFE.
The Pleasures of a S;a Beach Hotel
Ball Marred by a Singular
Misfortun\
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 27.â Jackson
Crooks of Oakland, who, with his wife and
child, has been visiting here for a week,
was accidentally shot to-night and may
die. He was changing his street dress for
ballroom garb in his apartments at the
Sea Beach Hotel, when a pistol fell from
one of his pockets and was discharged.
The bullet struck him on the left side,
just under the heart, passed upward
around a rib and came out in tbe center
of the left side of the back, at a point above
the line of entrance.
Within a few moments after the acci
dent the rumor that Crooks had attempted
suicide spread over the town. Dr3. Bailey
and Morgan were called and dressed the
wound, pivi:ig Mrs. Crooks considerable
hope for bis recovery. As soon as Crooks
was made comfortable and allowed to talk
he soon convinced those about him that
the suicide theory was ill-founded.
Crooks said that he bad just gone to his
room from the dining-table and begun to
change his dress. When he removed a
pair of trousers from a chair the pistol fell
from a pocket, discharging tbe ball into
his body. James Doyle, barkeeper of the
Sea Beach, was tbe first to hear the shot,
and ran in the direction of ttie sound.
Crooks was found prostrate on the floor.
He said to Doyle: ''I've had an accident,
Jimmy, and I guess I'm gone."
Mrs. Crooks was summoned and mes
sengers immediately dispatched for physi
cians. There was intense excitement
about the hotel. Tae guests were gather
ing for the dance and everybody was
startled by the sad news, for Mr. Crooks
and his wife are so well known and kindly
considered here, that they have friends in
almost every household. Mrs. Crooks is
the eldest daughter of County Treasurer
William H. Bias. Mr. Bias is known fa
miliarly as "Uncle Billy" and he and his
family are loved by the whole town.
When Mr. Crooks married Flora Bias and
removed to Oakland, Santa Cruz lost one
of its most charming and lovable girls,
and any sorrow that befalls Flora Bias-
Crooks is the sorrow of the community.
Jackson Crooks is well known in San
Francisco and Oakland as one of the heirs
of the Crooks estate, of which he is the
administrator and the affairs of which he
is just closing up. Matthew Crooks, his
father, was a California pioneer who
amassed a fortune of $2,000,000, which
fell to his widow and eight children when
he died twelve years ago. Mrs. Susan
Crooks, the widow, died about a year ago
in San Francisco and since then Jackson
has been engaged in settling the estate.
He and Mrs. Crooks and their baby came
to Santa Cruz to attend the carnival and
visit Mrs. Crooks' parents and friends
and were stopping at the Sea Beach Hotel,
where they intended to remain for a part
of the season.
Crooks was on the street this afternoon
and among his associates, whom he left
just before going to dinner, he was in his
usual cheerful mood. If the wound does
not prove fatal it will cause him to be
under careful surgical treatment for some
time, though he says that he is not much
hurt, and believes i.c was more frightened
than injured when the shot struck him.
Late to-night the surgeons could give
but little hope of his recovery.
PACIFIC GROVE'S SCHOOL.
Need of a More General Observance of
the Sabbath Urged by Christian
Men and Women.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., June 27.â The
morninc session of the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union School of Methods was
devoted to the department of Sabbath
observance. Rev. M. C. Briggs, D.D., of
San Jose, Rev. N. R. Johnston of Oakland,
Rev. John Kimball of San Francisco, Rev.
Mr. Kyle of Salinas and Rev. Mr. Peck
were present from the Sabbath Asso
ciation.
Mrs-. Sturtevant Peet delivered the open
ing address, emphasizing the point that
Sabbath desecration led to criminality.
Mrs. Christine Armstrong presented an
impre sive paper, entitled "The Sabbath
Was Made for Man." Rev. Mr. Kyie dis
cussed the question from the standpoint
of physical considerations alone, claiming
that more and better work could be ex
pected from man and beast when one day's
rest was given in each week, and that man
would derive incalculable benefit, morally
and physically, from the weekly day of
worship.
Rev. N. R. Johnston spoke on the duty
of the church to the Sabbath. The church
was the teacher of the people, and to it be
longed the responsibility of teaching in
the name of the Lord. The duty of rulers
and legislators was not alone to do the
will of the people, but the higher duty â
the will of God.
Dr. Briggs held that the whole Sabbath
question was embodied in the law of love
as taught by the Savior, declaring that he
who broke the fourth commandment broke
the whole decalogue.
He demanded of Christian people more
sacrifices for the sanctity of the Sabbath ;
more self-denial and less self-indulgence';
more responsibility for their own prac
tices and example.
Mrs. Mary Frank Brown narrated some
striking instances of mistaken efforts
which had resulted in valuable lessons in
Sabbath observance. Ms. Eyster, Mrs.
Gove and Mrs. Greene engaged in a gen
eral discussion of how far Sunday travel
ing was justified.
A reception at the El Carmelo was ten
dered the visitors to-night.
Puget Sound Fruit Blighted.
TACOMA, Wash., June 27.âFruit-grow
ers report that crop prospects on the
sound are not flattering. Orchards situ
ated in close proximity to salt water are
seldom affected by spring frosts; but the
cold, dry freeze" in April was more than
the trees could stand. This year's crop on
all the islands in and around the sound
have been blighted, and will prove almost
a total failure.

PowerfulâH ow It Was Dis-
covered.
IT IS HARMLESS.
Positive Cures Have Been Made end
Years Allowed for Relapse, So It
Is Now an Assured Factâ lnterested
Parties Should Investigate.
â¢ There is no gainsaying the fact that I
am always in search of the novel, the new,
and for this very reason I went up to the
big white building on Market street to
talk about the wonder worker of wh'.ch so
much has been said lately. The scientific
gentleman with whom I conversed tried to
carry me into thin air and dropped me on
a star, but as 1 proposed only to glean
facts and tangibility, whenever he dis-
coursed on the possibilities I politely
listened but brought him back to the
point, to the point of fact. Indeed, he
bristled with facts and figures when it wan
stuck to him. Said the doctor: "We have
been us'ng the Hudyan remedio-treatment
in the Hudson Medical Institute for five
years, and we are now prepared to say that
it is the greatest wonder-worker in the
world. Our statistics prove that ninety-
eigfit out of every one hundred cases that
we have undertaken were entirely cured in
a given time, and the two per cent lost were
cases that it was impossible for any one
to do anything with. It is a certain thing
that the great Hudyan remedio-treatment
is the first discovery of the age. It is â 
boon to man. Young men when suffering
from failing manhood, bad dreams, melan-
cholia and nervous troubles brought on by
dissipation, abuse, etc., can be speedily
cured if they bat follow the advice that
goes with the remedio-treatment.
"You want to see some testimonials,"
said the doctor to me. Of coarse I did,
and I minutely inspected four hugÂ«
volumes of testimonials, and I can truth-
fully say that these testimonials con-
vinced me that the Hudyan remedio-
treatment is a great boon to man. 1
asked the doctor if Hudyan was procurable
in any place outside of this institution and
he replied, "that the great Hudyan could
not be procured in any part of the world
except at the Hudson Medical Institute."
So any one who wished information con*
cerning the great Hudyan must eithei
write or call to the Hudson Medical In-
atitnta for . : i^-JU 'i;'s'/y-4&ll\?;- â .

!.:..... i . V. ........... X .'.... ................ ....!
As it is well known the Hudson Medical
Institute occupies the white building at
the junction of Stockton, Market and Ellis
streets. The private entrance for this in-
stitution is No. 5 Stockton street.
All curable disorders are treated at the
Hudson Medical Institute, although it is a
fact that the specific remedio-treatment,
Hudyan, is used more often than any
other treatment, because the doctors of the
Hudson Medical Institute are especially

doctor what was the greatest trouble with
which he bad to combat in these cases,
and be told me that many men had a false
pride, a false modesty, and waited and
waited until it was almost too lato before
they made application for the Hudyan
treatment. Said the doctor: "It-is a fact
that the Hudson Medical Institute is not a
charitable institution, nevertheless hun-
dreds and hundreds have been cured at no
Â«ost to themselves. In many cases mothers
pay for their son's treatment unknown to
the son." Any one wishing further in-

GILLETT FOR STATE SENATOR.
The St. Louis Platform Indorsed and
Hearty Support Pledged to the
Nominees.
FUREKA, Cal.. June 27.â The Repub
lican County Convention met at Grand
Army Hall to-day to elect delegates to the
J irst Congressional Convention, which
trill meet in San Francisco on Tuesday to
nominate a candidate for Congress. The
call from the County Committee included
the nomination of candidate for State Sen
ator from the First Senatorial District.
J. M. Melendy, chairman of the execu
tive committee, called the convention to
order. C. A. Eastman was chosen tem
porary c airman and W. T. S. Hadley
temporary secretary. The following reso
lution was unanimously adopted:
Be it resolved, That this convention proceed
to take a vote on various candidates for Con
gressman and Slate Senator for the purpose of
determin'nK this convention's choice of can
didates for these offices; aud be It lurther
Uraoivfi, That delegate? chosen at this con
vention to participate in the Conjrressional
and Senatorial conventions of the First Con
gressional and First Senatoriul districts, to be
held in the City of ban Fra.ncisco on Tuesday,
June 30, 1896, or as soon thereafter as said
convention can convene, be and they are here
by instructed to cast 'heir voles for persons
reeeivinz the largest number of votes in con
vention for such offices.
A motion to go into Assembly district
convention was lost, and the convention
proceeded to vote on a choice for Con
gressional candidate. When it was learned
Senator Frank MoGowan was the almost
unanimous choice of the convention the
applause was prolonged and enthusiastic.
It was some moments before the chair
man could again bring the convention to
order.
The vote for preference as to the Sena
torial candidate was very close. J. N.
Gillett received 48 votes and J. H. G.
Weaver 42 votes. Each faction had been
diligently working the county for sup
porters, as the Humboldt delegation con
trols the nomination.
The following delegates to the Congres-
Eional convention were elected: William
Carson, J. C. Bull, William Wallace. John
S. Connick, Tnomas Selvage. Dr. F. R.
Horel, Frank Eileriy Sr., A. Putnam,
Frank Luther, John M. Vance, Rev. C. P.
Cone, George W. Williams.
The convention again pledged its dele
gation to McCJowan, adopted the St. Louis
platform and resolved to earnesMy sup
port the ReDublican nominees. When a
picture of McKintey was presented to the
convention by S. A. Campbell the dele
gates arose in a body arid cheered. The
campaign cry has become "McKinley and

Washington delegation to the National
Democratic Convention, left this morning

an ardent advocate of the free coinage of

STANFORD CALVERNITS HOP
hummer School Student* Attend a Dance
in Boble Gymnasium.'
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., June
27. â The monotony of summer school
work was pleasantly broken into last
evening by some of the more energetic
students; giving a dance in Roble Gym
nasium. The invitation was a general
one to student;, and many took advantage
of the opportunity to attend the only social
event during the summer-school session.
The walls of the gymnasium were dec
orated with evergreens, artistically ar
tistically Arranged, while in each corner of
the dancing floor booths made themselves
conspicuous, not only because of the
handiwork, but also for the reason that
refresh hie nts were within, awaiting the
pleasure of the dancers.
An orchestra. from San Jose furnished
the music, and when the first number on
tb<- programme was called about twenty
rive couples took the floor. Waltzes and
two-steps were the favorites of the evening.
TURKS FRIVENS ESCAPE
Armenians â  Cannot Leave the Eastern
Land of Bloodshed.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 27.â 1n a third
letter received by -Phillips, an Armenian
merchant of this , city, from hi.Â« mother,
five members of whose family have been
murdered by Turks, the writer states that
the hatcheries continue with no sign of
abatement. Replying to her son's advice
to leave and come to this country, she
says:
"If I only could leave this terrible land !
But no one can go without a pass from the
Turkish Government, and that is imp ssi
hie to get. As the mountains are all
guarded, it would not be possible to escape
that way. No business is being done, and
starvation stares all in the face, and it is
but a question of time, unless assistance
comes, until we perish."
The writer is endeavoring to care for six
of her grandchildren, representing three
families whose parents were shot down by
Turks. '

VALUE Â«*Â» MONEY. j
The Climax of Value Giving now. No other store in ttfe West dare attempt such prices as we quote this week. The h
I absolute necessity of reducing our immense stocks, the selling of which was unavoidably delayed for many weeks, explains the price- J
L cutting below and a thousand similar bargains, which will be found in the World's Grandest Store. %
Selling every kind of merchandise in one vast establishment as we do means a great saving in expense, and consequently ffjj
the ability at all times to sell goods at a closer margin of profit than they could possibly be sold for in separate stores. But as cheap
as our modern methods enable us to sell every day, prices such as we quote you this week would mean irretrievable ruin if continued *
1 for any length of time. J
To maintain the prestige which is already ours stocks must be kept fresh, clean and strictly up-to-date. So rather than have X
the goods now in our store grow "stale" and "unprofitable" on our hands we cut prices as prices were never cut before in San J
Francisco. Â«

Value of Vast Tracts to Be Enhanced
a Hundred-Fold by Libaral
Irrigation.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., June 27.â This city
was to-night in tne possession of a howl
ing mob, and cheers for E. S. Babcock and
John D. Spreckels rent the air for hours.
The election held to-day resulted in a
crushing defeat of Silurians and the tri
umph of progressive men, who are build
ing up this country.
San Diego voted by a large majority
over the necessary two-thirdsâ a stupen
dous handicap â to build a new water sys
tem at a cost of $1,500,000, giving the city
1000 inches of water from the mountains
and a new distributing system. The
voting of bonds in this amount means the
construction of a system in addition to
that of the city, but auxiliary to it, for the
irrigation of 75,000 acres of land in the
country adjacent to the city â the finest
lemon land in the United States, and
which will jump in value from $1 per acre
in its present sagebrush state to $100 per
acre with water. The total cost of the
system, including the city's share, is esti
mated at $3,000,000 and over 7000 inches of
water will be developed. The city gets
the sole ownership of the magnificent
Morena dam, the finest m Southern Cali
fornia, the conduit to the city ana the
distributing system in the city.
E. S. Babcock, the founder of Coronado
and partner of John D. Spreckels and A.
B. Sprectels, is the moving spirit of this
great enterprise. The populace has go n
wild and bonfires, bombs and brass bands
held forth on the plaza both last night
and to-night.
At the Hotel del Coronado, which
Babcock built, the employes met him and
carried him on their shoulders, while fire
works and music drew the whole popula
tion of tbe beach to the spot. The citi
zens generally regard this as the turning
point in San Diego's career and are simply
beside themselves. The fight lasted four
years and was bitterly fought by the San
Diego Flume Company, owner of the
water system now supplying the city. All
sorts of corruption was alleged on the part
of the flume company and money was
Bpent like water. The city now cuts loose
from a monopoly and gains a water sys
tem of its own from fountain-head to
kitchen faucet.
SUED BY SPOKANE CITY.
Action Against a Corporation in Which
Prominent Men Are Named as
Defendants.
SPOKANE, Wash., June 27.â The city
of Spokane to-day began suit against the
Northwest Milling and Power Company,
together with a long list of other defend
ants, to recover $80,000 which it alleges is
due from the company. The suit promises
to be a sensational one. It involves a
number of prominent men and ex-city
officials.
J. H. Eardly, a former City Treasurer,
deposited city money to the extent of $35,
-000 in the Bank of Spokane Fall?. The
bank failed. An Eastern bank held $65,000
of stock in the Spokane Water Power
Company as collateral for $35,000 due it by
the Bank of Spofcane Falls. In order tb
save the $35,000 which the Treasurer lost
by the failure he advanced the other
amount to the Eastern bank and secured
stock.
Afterward the Spokane Water Power
Company sold all its property to the
Northwest MillinT and Power Com
pany and, it is claimed, without consent
of tbe city interest.
The property was then mortgaged by the
Mortgage Company cf Amsterdam for
$300,000. Solomon Oppenheimer, who was
the promoter, ran the company in debt
and left the country. The mortgage com
pany then commenced foreclosure pro
ceedings, and the city now comes in to
claim its interest and set the original sales
end mortgage aside.
The attorneys for the city say that prom
inent officials are involved and that the
transactions were fraudulent.
SANTA ROSA ELECTION ROW
Jeiters Induce a Unman to Insist Upon
Voting.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., June 27.â Mrs.
Williams of this city created a ereat deal
of^ excitement and no end of merriment
by attempting to vote at the election of
School Trustees to-day. Cherishing
strong political convictions, Mrs. Wil
liams was anxious to cast her first ballot,
having been led by a party of wags to be
lieve that she was entitled to that privi
lege. Upon being refused permission to
deposit her ballot, the lady returned to
thoÂ«e who had first urged her to
make the attempt and was told by
them that her ballot had been rejected
on account of her known sympathy for
the American Protective ' Association.
She was told by the would-be funny men
to try again aud if refused to make a
grand uproar. rheÂ«e instructions were
curried out to the letter, and it was with
great difficulty that the woman was in
duced to desist and go to her home.
SANTA ROSA'S AGED SUITOR.
Seventy-two Tear Old Joaiah Piatt
Mould. Hed a Girl of fourteen.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., June 27.â Josiah
Paxton Piatt, aged 72, applied for a mar
riage license to-day, to wed Mary Burns,
aged 14. The would-be bridegroom was
informed by County Clerk Fulton that the
girl was' too young and that he could not
issue the license. The undaunted Mr.
Piatt said he would remedy that all right,
and the girl's mother soon appeared be
fore the clerk to pive her consent. The
clerk thereupon produced the statutes and
read a little cold law on the subject of
matrimony, from which the fatherly look
ing Piatt learned that he had yet a year to
â¢wait before he could wed Mary according
to law.

MISSING FROM FORTLING
Real Estate Agent Jcvcett Said to II tie
Defrauded Several Hanks.
PORTLAND, Or., June 27.â The Wel
come this evening saya that Clarence F.
Jewett, for several years in the real estate
business here, has absconded after de
frauding several banks out of $25,000. His
victims are very reticent about the affair
and positively refuse to give any definite
information. District Attorney Hurce is
interesting himself in the case and is
making strong efforts to apprehend Jewett,
with no present indications of success.
It is said that Jewett defrauded indivi
duals also, but in mat cases the sums
were small, and those who lost by their
dealings with him will not go to any ex
pense to bring him back. But the banks
are determined that he shall not escape
and will spare no expense in bringing him
to justice.
Jewett is a nephew of the founder of the
Forearm Arms Manufacturing Company
in Springfield, Mass. This ancle is a multi
millionaire, and to-night it is said that the
alleged absconder has gone East to obiain
funds to square himself heie. His family
is yet in the city.

PORTLAND, Ok., June 27.â George W.
Baxter, the wife murderer who was con
victed of manslaughter, was to-day sen
tenced by Judge Stephens to fifteen years
of penal servitude and to pay a $500 fine.
Baxter takes his sentence quite philo
sophically. He had stated beforehand
that he did not think Judge Stephens
would give him more tnan ten years. The
courtroom was crowded with people,
many of whom thought the defendant
should havo been convicted ot murder in
the first degree and sentenced to the gal
lows. It is said that Baxter has friends
who will try and effect his pardon in a few
years. _______^_____
WAS KNOWN IN SEATTLE
Albert Peck a Divorced Husband
of Murdered Mrs. Cora
Borden.
She Was Granted a Separation Be
cause Their Temperaments
Were Antagonistic.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 27.â Mrs. Cora
Borden, murdered on Tuesday morning
in San Francisco by George Stutz, had a
divorced husband, Albert F. Peck, resid
ing in tnis city. He is treasurer for the
Washington Shoe Manufacturing Com
pany. The divorce was obtained in tan
Francisco over two years ago by Mrs.
Peck, but upon what grounds Peck says
he does not know, as he made no defense.
He presumes it was incompatibility of
temper, as their differences were never of
a more serious nature.
He met the late Mrs. Borden through
the instrumentality of his sister, who was
her bosom friend at New Bedford, Mass.,
where they were married in 1888.
The couple at once removed to jSan
Francisco, which city had been Peck's
home for many years, and remained there
until their separation.
Cora M. Lewis was Mrs. Borden's maiden
name. She was born at Plymouth, Mass.,
and was the daughter of Benjamin Lewis,
a blacksmith. Her near relatives are all
dead. In the early eighties she married
Arthur Borden, who was lost by the
wrecking of a small steamer near Nan
tucket in 1887.
Borden. Mr. Peck says, was a cousin of
Lizzie Borden, who was defendant in the
famous Borden murder trial at Fall River,
Mass., several yearg ago, Lizzie being ac
cused of the murder of her father and
mother, but acquitteJ. Mrs. Borden
piaye'i for two weeks in this city with the
Pyke Opera Company, and while here met
and conversed with Peck, who is now mar
ried again.

Agent Anderson and His Tax Lists
Abroad in the Silvsr
Country.
VIRGINIA CITY, Nev., June 27.â J. W.
Anderson, about 55 years old, sleek, well
fed ana with a bunch of iron-gray whiskers
on his chin, blew into Nevada lately on a
peculiar mission. He is pleasing and
suave, and carried letters of introduction
not to the vulgar public, but to Feaeral
office-holders great and small. He has
them on a list, with their names, ad
dresses, at what particular stall of the
public crib they feed and wnat the oats are
worth.
Anderson hails from Sprague. Wash.,
and his credentials are signed by Chauncey
P. Black, president of the National Asso
ciation of Democratic Clubs, Charles J.
Faulkner, chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Committee, and Lawrence
Gardner, secretary. Anderson is one of
three agents alleged to have been author
ized to assess Federal office-holders to
raise funds for the Democratic campaign
of 1896. He was evidently picked out of a
horde on account of his peculiar fitness
for the work.
He is an adept at the business, and has
methods to suit all occasions. He could
draw tears from a Sphinx; or cause "de
push" to cnuckle.
Anderson's assessments are rated at $25
on $750 per annum situations; $30 on
$1000 postmasters, soon to be in the civil
service; $75 on $1000 appointments; $125
on $1500; $300 on $4000. He approaches
the guileless with austerity, winds up by
asking how many dollars' worth they
love Democracy and their official necks,
and leaves after giving a printed receipt
in blue ink and parchment. From the
center of the parchment beams a likeness
of the father of his country.
Anderson carries numberless stub-books,
showing that he has been remarkably suc
cessful. He has traversed Montana and
Idaho, is now "doing" Nevada, and in
tends to touch the Califoruians next.

A CYCLIST'S FATAL FALL.
While Making a Tour of Mexico He Goes
Over a Cliff-
GUADALAJARA, Mex., June 27.â D. C.
Edwards, an American who had been
making a bicycle tour through Mexico and
left here a few days ago to cross the Sierre
Madre on his way to Manzanlllo, was ac
cidentally killed by falling over a cliff
eighty miles distant from here. His
mangled body and broken bicycle were
found at the foot of the cliff.
The mountain trail at that point is very
narrow and dangerous, and it is supposed
that Edwards was carrying his wheel,
when his foot slipoed and he was dashed
over the precipice. His place of residence
in the- United States is not known here.

Duration of Victoria's Kcign.
Tbe statement made in our columns the
other day that the Victorian reign will "in
a month or so" have lasted longer than
that of any other English sovereign is, a
correspondent points out, not quite ac
curate. George 111 ascended the throne
October 25, 1780, and died January 29,1820,
his reisn having lasted fiftv-mne years
and ninety-six days. The Queen's reign
began on June 20, 1837, and will reach the
equal period of fifty-nine years and
ninety-six days on Thursday. Septem
ber 24. The 25th will therefore (for
perhaps preferably Saturday, the 26tb) be
the appropriate day for celebrating, as we
hope to do, a reign which will then have
exceeded all others in duration, as it has
already done in glory and importance.
This calculation is correct if we take all
years as equal. If we reckon the number
of days the term would be reached two
days earlier, since the extra 29th of Febru
ary only occurred thirteen times in the
reign of George 111, he having commenced
it after that dale in 1760, and died before
it in 1820, while he missed one of the >cries
owing to the occurrence of the century
year 1800. In the present reign the extra
day has occurred fifteen times. â West

Low Wagesâ J. 8., Tacoma, Wash. It is as
serted that the reason that wages are low in

The leually appointed KUurdian of a ward is
bound to look after the comfort, education and
moral welfare of his ward, and as such it
snould be his duty to ascertain all that his
ward is doing, and he would have a right to
ascertain what kind of correspondents be has.
A ward who would have "private correspon

see," can certainly not be very proud of such
corresDondence.

Rapid Ship-Bcildingâ E. G., City. England
has built first-class war vessels In the shortest
space oÂ£ time. The keel of the Magnificent
was laid down at Chatham December 18, 1893,
and the vessel was floated December 19, 1894;
weight 6100 tons. The keel of the Majectic,
weight 7300 tons, was laid at Portsmouth
February 4, 1894, and was floated January 4,
1895. Lord Brassey, m his work on war ves
sels of all nations, says: "This rate of con
struction is absolutely unprecedented."
A Soldiee's Voteâ A. O. S., City. The mere
fact that a man is a soldier in the army of the
United States does not prevent him from
voting in the State of California, but he can
not vote unless he has been a citizen of the
State and of the county in which he offers his
vote for the constitutional period. The act of
April 4, 1864, which gave soldiers the right to
vote no matter where they were, was declared
unconstitutional.
You Can Voteâ D. C. H., City. In your com

on the 11th of next August, but registration
closes on the Bth. Is there any way of my vot

can vote at the coming election. All you have
to do is to go to the office of the Registrar and
have your name registered. The law does not
say that the applicant for registration shall be
21 years of age at the time he applies for regis
tration, but that he mast be 21 years of age at
the time that he offers to vote.
Bunkeb Hill Dayâ A. S., City. The Ameri
cans celebrate the 17th of June (Bunker Hiil
day) in commemoration of one of the fiercest
battles of the Revolutionary War, fought on
the 17th of June, 1775, when the Americans
with 3000 men resisted the attack of 4000
British soldiers for lour hours and were forced
to retire because they ran out of powdpr and
ammunition. During that struggle 800 British
were killed and only 100 Americans laid down
their lives in the cause of liberty. One of the
number was General Warren.
Polish fop. Canesâ s. McM., City. In the
polishing of woods and canes the following
process is said to be the most satisfactory and
gives the hardest finished surface: Fill with
best, filler or with shellac, dry by heat, rub
down with pumice; then put on three coats of
clear spirit copal varnish, hardening each in
an oven at a tempemture fts hot as the wood
and the gum will safely stand. For extra work
the first two coals may be rubbed down and
the last allowed a flowing coat.
Vauihall Gardensâ H. S., City. Vauxhall
Gardens in Lambeth, London, date back to
1730. Tney derive their title from the hall or
manor-house of Jane Vaux, which they dis
placed. Vauxhall is described in a document
as tbe manor of Faukeshall, but as this manor
wus originally held by Fulke de Breante goon
after the Conquest, it is highly probable the
designation was more correctly "Fulke's
Hall," afterward corrupted into Faukeghall.
The present spelling ha* been traced back to
1615, when the hall or manor-house was occu
pied by Jane Vaux. There is a tradition that
Vauxhall was at one time the property of Guy
Fawkes, hence the name corrupted to Vaux
hall, but this has been traced and ascertained
to be without foundation.
Debtsâ L. P., City. This department is al
ways willing and ready to state the law, but it
cannot decide questions of law. The law of
this State declares that a deed of gift other
than one made in view of death cannot be re
voked. A deed of gilt of a piece of property
by a husband to a wife, if made by the husband
when not in fear of death, cannot be revoked,
and it becomes the separate property of the
wife. The separate property of the wife is not
liable for the debts of the husband. All prop
erty acquired by either husband or wife, or
both, is community property, but whenever
any property is conveyed to a'married woman
by an instrument in writing the presumption
is that the title is thereby vested in her, as her
separate property. The wife has the right to
will her separate property as she desires.

tention to become citizens have a right to vote

exercising that privilege. Such is the rule in
Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Louisi
ana, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota and
Wisconsin. In those States there is no limit as

limit is fixed. The States that require full citi
zenship before an individual can vote are:
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Illinois, lowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachu

The Largest Fortâ Country Subscriber. The
largest fort in the United States is Fortrens
Monroe. There 16 no other fortification like
it in this country. It is at Old Point Comfort,
Va., and commands the water approach to
Norfolk and 'Josport Navy-yard. It is the
only fortification in this country designated as
a fortress, it covers eighty acres of ground,
and the distance around its exterior to the
ditches and redoubts is one and six-tenths
miles. It was begun in 1817, is irregular
heiagon in shape, has three channel fronts, is
bastioned, has a water ditch 8 feet deep at
high water and a scarp wall rising seventeen
feet above high water. It has cost about
$3,000,000 and was designed by General Si
mon Bernard, a French lieutenant of engi
neers, who, under a resolution of Congress in
1816, was commissioned by President Madi
son as brevet brigadier-general of engineers of
the United States army. His orignal plan was
to accommodate 371 jruns exclusive of
mortars, howitzers and fieldpieoes, but his
plans were considerably modified. After the
civil war the fortress was arranged to mount
118 guns, eighteen flankincr howitzers in case
mates and fifty-one guns in barbette. Since
1893 the work of fitting it up with modern
steel-rifled canon and mortars has been going
on, and it is also being provided with a sys
tem of submarine mines. Tbe plans for the
present include four 16-lnch guns, ten each of
12 and 10-inch guns and thirty-two 12-inch
mortars, exclusive of guns already in position.

Memorial Dayâ Ladies of the G. A. R., San
Jose, Cal. Memorial day, or Decoration day a3
it was formerly called, had Its origin from a
custom that prevailed in the South before the
war. Early in the spring the women, of the
South were in the habit of decorating the
graves of the dead, as has been the custom in
Franco for ages. After the war the women of the
South placed flowers on the graves of the sol
diers who fell during the war, and an unwrit
ten law fixed the 30th of May of each year
the day of observance. Similar observances
haa been inaugurated in the North without
special unanimity. On the sth of May, 1868
General John A. Logan, then eominander-i;i
chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, is
sued an, order fixing the 30th of May of that
year for strewing the groves of the dead sol
diers of the Union with flowers and since that
time the custom has been kept up.

Argonâ E.G. S., Livermore, Cal. Argon is
a new element, which owes its discovery to In
vestigations by Professor William Ramsey and
Lord Bayleigh. They found that nitrogen lib
erated from chemical compounds was lighter
than atmospheric nitrogen. Their work led to
the conclusion that there was an undiscovered
element in the air. It is separated by acting
on air with red-hot copper flyings :o separate
the oxygen. The residual As is dried and
passed over white-hot magnesium tilings. The
magnesium combines with the nitrogen, pro
ducing a solid nitrate and leaving argon as a
gas. The argon amounts to about 4 per cent
of the nitrogen. It is treated repeatedly by a
substantial duplication of tbe process de
scribed, several days being required to dispose
of all the nitrogen. Another method is to pass
electric sparks, preferably from platinum ter
minals, through the nitrogen mixed with oxy
gen. Its oxide can be absorbed by caustic
alkali, leaving argon aa a gas. Argon has a
characteristic spectrum. Its specific gravity
(H-I) is between 19 and 21. It is two ami a
half times as soluble in water as niti >gen. Its
critical temperature (âl2l degrees C.) and boil
ing point (âlB7 degrees C.) are lower than those
of oxygen. Professor Olszewiski succeeded
in solidifying it to white crystals, melt
ing at 189.6 degrees C. "It sÂ«ems to
be incapable of combining with anything,"
says one authority. It has beeii found in
clevelte and in meieorite. From the fact that
no aigon is found in the nitrogen which can
be extracted from Bessemer-blown steel, Pro
fessor Roberts-Austen holds that argon may
have possibly united with the iron and given
it some of its peculiar properties. It is fur
ther supposed by some that argon may con
tribute to the nourishment ana growth of
plants. But these and other thaortes as to the
functions of argon in nature's processes ace
rather Indications of lines to bo followed in
investigation than established inductions.
There is still much doubt concerning its true
status. Professor Kysen of Bonn claims that
he has found helium associated in small quan
tities with argon and nitrogen issuing freely as
a stream into the air in the rases of Wildbad
in the 31ack Forest. ProfeJ-sor Humsey says
that two uf the lines in the spectra of argon

NOTED MORMON LEADERS
Joseph F. Smith and Abram H.
Cannon Arrive From
Salt Lake.
Smith Is One of the Presidency and i
j Cannon One of the Twelve
. Apostles.
Two prominent leaders in the Mormon
church arrived in this City yesterday from
Salt Lake City. They are Joseph F.
Smith, one of the three members of the
. presidency who have general supervision I
of the whole Mormon church, and Abram
H. Cannon, one of the Twelve Apostles
who are directly under the presidency,
and who have charge of the missionary
work of the church.
Both the gentlemen are stopping with
Henry S. Tanner, the president of the
California Mormon Mission, which meets
every Sunday morning and evening at
â¢ Pythian Castle*- The local branch of the
church consists of about 150 members.
Messrs. Smith and Cannon, who are
fine speakers, are visiting this City both j
for pleasure and in ' connection with
church work as. well. To-day they will
apeak at Pythian Castle, 90y Market street, '
in tlje morning at 11 and in the evening :
at 7:45. Their stay here will 'be very
brief, as they will probably leave on Mon- |
day or Tuesoay.
.Most of the time of the distinguished j
leaders now visiting the City is taken up [
with church workâ preaching and travel
ing between, the various missions. Like ;
all officers of the Mormon church they j
receive no salary whatsoever and pay I
their own expenses.
â¢ "The officers of the Mormon church
work for the love of truth as they under- ]
stand it," said Elder J. R. Sheppard; who \
has been working in the interests of the j
church at San Jose. â¢ "There are 1000 Mor
mon elders in the world and twenty-three
in California, all of r whom work without :
any compensation. We have met with ;
very good success in this State and al- j
though we have been laboring here less
than two years we have branches in San
Francisco, Sacramento. Stockton, . San
Jose, Los Angeles and other cities.
"The recent visit of the â¢ Tabernacle
choir to this Coast has causes many per
sons to inquire into our church and people. i
We have always bad .to meet considerable
prejudice against us, which is cased mostly I
upon lack of information and malicious
reports circulated atrainst us. â  As people
get to know us better, however, their
prejudices in great part disappear."
BENJAMIN MUST
PAY THE DUTY
The Imported Leprosy Rem
edy Is Not on the Free
List.
PUZZLED THE OFFICERS.
Collector Wise Has His Memory
Refreshed by a Very Old
Decision.
BELIEF OF THE SUPERVISOR.
Dr. Goto's Japanese Remedy Is Said
to Ba Miraculous in Its
Effectiveness.
Collector Wise, after two or three day 9
of exquisite agony, determined yesterday
that the Japanese specific for leprosy im
ported by Supervisor Benjamin in the
Supervisor Benjamin Views With Pride Uis Imported Leprosy Cure.
hope of helping the fourteen leper in
mates of the pesthouse, was subject to
duty, and further that the same must be
paid t>rior to its removal from the Custom
house.
Mr. "Wise's decision, however, was
prompted by the accidental discovery of a
ruling made by the General Appraisers
twelve months ago in practically a similar
case. The Collector had about agreed with
Mr. Benjamin that the specific was enti
tled to free entry when one of bis clerks
brought to light a decision by General Ap
praiser Summerville, rendered June 6,
1895, which reads as follows:
The merchandise covered by the protest Jn
this case consists of twenty bottles of a
medicinal preparation known as "antitoxine,"
which was imported under the tariff act of
August, 1894, ana was assessed for duty at 25
per cent ad valorem under paragraph 59
of said act as a medicinal preparation
not especially provided for therein.
The article is claimed to be free of duty
under paragraph 585 of said tariff act as
a scientific preparation specially imported in
eood faith for the use of a society or institu
tion incorporated or established for religious,
philosophical, educational or scientific or lit
erary purposes, and not intended for sale.
We find as a matter of fact that the mer
chandise in question was imported by the
city of Chicago, a municipal corporation in
the State of Illinois, for free distribution by
the health department of said city to certain
hospitals.
We hold that Â« municipal corporation like
the city of Chicago is not a society or institu
tion of the kind described in said paragraph
585, and that the importation is therefore cot
free of duty. The protest is overruled and the
Collector's'decioion affirmed.
The contention of Mr. Benjamin was
founded on section 585 of the Wilson tariff
bill, which says:
Philosophical and scientific apoaratus, uten
sils, instruments and preparations, including
bottles and boxes containing the same; stat
uary, casts of marble, bronze, alabaster or
plaster of paris; paintings, drawings and
etchings, specially imported in good faith for
the u=e of any society or institution incor
porated or established for religious, philo
sophical, educational, scientific or literary
purposes, or for encouragement of the fine
arts, and not intended for sale.
The Supervisor held that the remedj
was a "scientific preparation," and as it
was imported for charitable purposes,
came well within the law. Collector Wise
entertained similar ideas and was on the
eve of ordering the goods delivered to Mr.
Benjamin, when Summervilie's decision
was discovered. The Collector was sorry
that this thing had been unearthed and
readily admitted to the philanthropic
Supervisor that San Francisco, consider
ing the tax levy and the hundreds of extra
men drawing fat salaries, was certainly a
charitable institution, put the law was
plain and must be enforced.
The value of the importation is hardly
$200, the duty amounting to $40 25. This
will be paid next Tuesday.
Among the Japanese and others who
have had indirect experience with Dr.
Goto's leprosy cure there is an abiding
faith as to its efficacy. Mr. Benjamin has
paid particular attention to the unhappy
inmates of the PftsthoUM and in many
ways endeavored to assist them. Some
time ago he heard of the G >to remedy and
immediately determined to secure a sun
ply for ihe local sufferers. In a short time
some $200 was collected and an order for
warded to the Japanese physician for
"such a quantity as the inclosed would
buy."
The last steamer from the Orient'
brought the remedy, and incidentally a
surprise to the Supervisors. Instead of a
convenient package such as could be
easily carried there came to the address of
Mr. Benjamin four large cases weighing
fully a ton. In the Appraisers' building
one of the cases was opened, and then
more than a hundred little square boxes
were seen. There are three remedies in
one â two to be taken internally and the
third in the form of a bath.
In the latter case the patient is in
structed to place the herb in a linen bag.
which is then to be deposited in a bath
tub in water 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
The water mnst cover well the shoulders
of the bather, and this operation muH be
gone through with twice between the
hours of 9 a. m. and 4 p. m. Every five days
a rest must be taken. In the second box
was found packages of finely powdered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
matter, the directions being to "mix one
in five teacups of water, eighteen ounces,
condense into two-thirds and drink every
morning." In the smaller box a Jot of
bullet-shaped pellets were seen and the
alllicted person is instructed to take one
each morning. "If loss of appetite is felt
taue it little" is Dr. Goto's closing instruc
tion.
Supervisor Benjamin will have the
remedy out next Tuesday. He has an
abiding faith in its powers and believes
that the next six months will witness a
wonderful change in the condition of those
for whom it is intended. There is a young
man at the Pesthouse who took the cure
once in Honolulu and it arrested the prog
ress of the leprosy. He declares that ne
has witnessed actual cures from the con
tinued use of the Japanese savant's
specific.
THE CHUTES TO-DAY.
Kgilo Viola, the Young- Aeronaut,
Will Make a Balloon Ascension
and Parachute Jump.
The Chutes as they now stand will be
ODened to-day for the last time from 10
o'clock in the morning until 11 at night.
At half- past 4 Essie Viola, the nervy
young aeronaut, will make a balloon as

formances are always successful and she
hopes to make a long leap to-day.

AFFLICTED FOR YEARS
Mrs. Pearson Alter Long Suffer
ing Finds Relief From
Her Troubles.
A Wonderful Cure Effected by the
Remedies of W. H. Druhe, a
Native Son.
Any one who has ever been a victim of
rheumatism and has suffered the tortures
that an aggravated and long-standing at-
I tack of this ailment brings feels, do doubt,
! when cuied, a degree of thankfulness that
jis with d&iculty put into words. These
j were the sentiments to which Mrs. M. E.
I Pearson gave utterance when seen yester
: day at her home, 119 Fifth street, in this
j City. The lady is a prominent member of
| the Daughters of Rebekah, being a mem
ber of Amity Lodge. She formerly lived
at Sacramento, ana prior to that time was
! a resident of Salem, Or.
She said in response to a request for a
statement regarding her suffering from
rheumatism and how she was cured that
her affliction dated back over six years.
During all that time she suffered terribly
from an aggravated form of rheumatic
gout that affected hâ¬r whole system, prin
: cipaliy her feet, hands and shoulders.
j She tried all sorts of remedies and con
; suited many capable doctors, who pre
; scribed for her, but among them all she
! failed to find relief. She stated that she
j was unable to rest nights, could not eat
J or sleep, had no ambition and was very
j much discouraged over her condition.
I Not long ago she was induced to try the
[ Herbal Remedies of William H. Druhe.
! This she did, taking in ad litlon thereto
i two electro-magnetic treatments daily,
} administered by Mr. Druhe, and used also
his Red Star Rheumatic Salve.
This treatment she pursued for eleven
weeks and now she says she is fully cured,
and that the pains and swellings have all
disappeared. Her appetite is restored, she
sleeps soundly and is gaining in strength
daily.
Mr. Druhe. who is an electro-magnetic
healer and herbalist and whose offices are at
1026 Market street, feels very much pleased
over the cure effected in the case of Mrs.
Pearson and says that she is but one
among many that he has treated with
equal success. Mr. Druhe is a native son,
having been born in this City thirty-seven
years ago. He is the son of J. H.'Drube,
a weli-known capitalist of San Francisco
who died in 1890. He was educated in Con
cord ia College, Fort Wayne, lnd., and has
for years made a study of herbs and their
medicinal properties.

M'NAB AND RAINEY
SAVED THE DAY
A Municipal Convention
Coup Failed by Three
Votes.
M'NAB NEARLY DOWNED
The Junta Campaign Committee
Wrestles With a Remark
able Scheme.
"DECENCY" AND "DEMOCRACY."
A Brilliant Plan to Make the General
Committee the Municipal
Convention.
Gavin McNab combined with Ed Lani
gan and Sara Kainey Friday night in a mo
ment of great emereency and for the time
saved himself and his lieutenant, Chair
man Sullivan, from utter rout in the
Junta.
By this combination in a meeting of the
Junta's campaign committee a remarkable
political coup, by which the Junta General
Committee of 450 with the addition of 150
Buckley ites was to be declared the mu
nicipal nominating convention, was de
feated by three votes.
The situation, as it developed, showed
that in the campaign commit cc at least
twelve of the twenty are ready to dump
McNab and Sullivan, but they can't eet to
jether to do it.
The sen me that was suddenly sprung
;hat night was the most wonderful of all
the wonderful schemes which this pic
turesque political aggregation has yielded,
[t illustrates vividly the condition of this
'anti-boss' organization which McNab has
led into the wilderness, carrying the ban
ner of "decency." It shows how
thoroughly the Junta is racked with dis
sensions and boss-ridden.
The scheme was hatched mainly by
Samuel Braunhart, Port Warden, and
Dr. W. J. Gayigan. Gavigan has split
away from Lanigan, has no use for Mc-
Nab and occupies an independent posi
i'Â»n. Brauntiart has long been scorned
tnd reviled by McNab and Sullivan.
Braunhart, Gavigan and others in the
ganization constitute an element opposed
to both the Rainey-Daggett-Lanigan com
bination, which now has secured a major
ity of the General Committee, and to Mc-
Nab, who with Sullivan and Hassett runs
things without much consultation with
others.
This element wants to beat out Sam
Rainey, but it is also "leery" o.' that reor
ganization scheme which McNab has up
his sleeve, and about which he says, "Sa
sh!" and "Wait! wait!" They know that
McNab' 8 scheme is to got the State execu
tive committee which Frank Gould is to
appoint soon to appoint a committee of
fifty at his suggestion to reorganize the
party into hi? hands.
It was also known that the Rainey pro
â¢â rarame is to force soon a meeting of tho
General Committee to abolish tne present
campaign committee and from these
premises it was figured out that ii the
present campaign committee could ap
point the municipal convention to meet
in September the wo rk would be done and
the thing settled before Rainey got the
committee abolished.
The easiest way to create a convention
was to appoint tYxe whole General Com
mittee and overcome Rainey's small
majority by adding 150 more. For
these representative Buckleyites would
be largely selected, and this, it was
figured out, would sufficiently weaken
the Buckley side.
A large majority of the campaign com
mittee was secured for this a day or two
aco, but it reached McNab's ears. When
he and Chairman Sullivan got over the
hysteric^ they pulled down enough to de
feat it. Braunhart and Gavigan knew that
they had eicbt votes sure, noped for one
or two more and that some oi the opposi
tion would not attend. But McNab saw
that every member was on hand.
McNab's only hope lay with the Rainey- i
ites, and just before the meeting he easily i
arranged that the four Rainey and Lani
gan votes should go against the scheme.
Routine tmsiness was disposed of, and
then R. L. Mann, the member from the
Thirty- fourth Dislrict, rose to offer a reso
lution. At McNab's prompting James
Butler moved io adjourn, and Chairman
Sullivan recognized Butler to choke off
what he knew was coming. An adjourn
ment was declared and then Braunhart
rose in wrath with an eloquent protest.
Then followed a half hour's wrangie in
executive session, during which the pro
ceedings were rather hot and informal.
Ihe resolution was not formally offered,
but the subject was discussed.
McNab eloquently urged that the thing
was premature. Braunhart swore that it
was the only way to keep the works out of
Rainey's claws, and that if R&lney did
succeed in abolishing the campaign com
mttee the convention would be already
:reatÂ«d.
He threw in some intimations that the
committee was not, in fact, composed of
McNab's dummies.
Dr. Gavigan and R. L. Mann joined in
supporting the proposition, and M. C.
Hassett helped McNab oppose it. There
were exchanges of tart compliments, and
finally the meeting broke up without a
rote being taken on the proposition or the
â¢esolution read. Braunhart and others
'aid that another meeting would be held
soon and the resolution adopted.
The proposition illustrates the extent to
[vhich McNab had absolute sovereignty
rested in the campaign committee, which
tie expected to be able to control. The
anpruage of the constitution vesting this
sower is quoted in the resolution, which
was as follows:
Whereas, Section 7 of article 111 of the con
stitution provides that "The campaign com
mittee shall be intrusted with the care and
proper management of e.W preliminary cum
i>nign work, ami shall rletermine and establish
;he sume ior the best interests of the Demo
â ratic party"; and where**, the best in
terests â of the Democratic party now
iemand that the campaign commit
tee shall forthwith determine and estab
;ish as preliminary to a successful cam
paign the number of delegate' to comprise the
3onvention to be held for the rJurpose of nomi
nating municipal an<J legislative officers; also
to provide for the selection of such delegates
md to fix the time for their meeting In con
vention ; therefore, and by virtue of the afore
said constitutional power vested in the cam
paign committee, be it
Resolved, That the number of the member
ship of the nominating convention be and it
is hereby fixed at 600 delegates;
Resolved, That all the eligible members of
the General Committee be and they are hereby
Jeciared members of and appointed delegates
to said nominating convention.
Resolved, That the campaign committee
lesicnate and appoint 100 delegates at large
to such nominating convention.
Resolved, That said nominating convention
(hull assemble on Monday evening:. September
14, 189ti, at 8:30 p. M.
Resolvtd, Thai any member of the General
Committee who Is not eligible to a in the
convention by reason of holding a public office
be and is hereby authorized to appoint a suit
able man to act as delegate in his place.
The eight general anti-boss votes ready
to adopt this resolution were the
following: Secretary J. F. McGovern,
Iff. Tierney, Samuel Braunhart, George H.
Love, John O'Donnell, R. L. Mann, Dr.
W. J. Gavigan and Peter Quinn.
The four Rainey-Lanigan votes were:
Edward Lanigan, James Haskina, John
Fitzpatrick and Jo.Â«eDh Hayes.
McNab has but five votes close to him
selfâGavin McNab, W. P. Sullivan, M. C.
Hassett, Timothy Donovan and James
Butler. Besides these five votes and the
Rainey strength there stood opposed to
the proposition that night P. J. Harney,
George T. Marye and A. A. Watkins, who
maintain an independent position.
It is possible that enough of those with
the opposition last night will vote for the
measure to carry it soon and that the
Junta will seek to maintain the purity
and dignity of the party and achieve its
success by this programme.
This or some other picturesque develop
ment is likely to furnish further entertain
ment within a few days. Mr. Rainey is
quite busy and Mr. McNab will not be
affected with ennui for some time.
Ed Lanigan resigned as a member of the
campaign committee, and his friend, John
N. Much, was appointed in his stead.
Action was taken to stimulate registra
tion. A committee was appointed to ask
Registrar Hinton to keep his office open
three evenings a week. A committee to
arrange for a ratification was ordered ap
pointed, and Chairman Sullivan was au
thorized to engage new headquarters,
which will probably be in the Emporium
building.

DENOUNCE THE CHARTER
The American Women's Liberal
League Replies to J. Rich
ard Freud.
Resolutions Condemning It as Reac
tionary, Bi;oted, Illiberal and
Unjust.
At a meeting of the American Women's
Liberal League, held yesterday at their
heaJquarters, Nucleus building, the fol
lowing resolutions were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, J. Richard Freud, secretary of the
Merchants' Association, has "no intention of
discouraging the ladies of the American
j Women's Liberal League in their commend-
I able enthusiasm in the public welfare" ; and
whereas, all enthusiasm commendable or
otherwise in the public welfare is dampened
by finding public men defending public meas
ures by mlsrepresi ntation and misstatements;
and whereas, J. Richard Freud defends the
clause in the charter requiring teachers in the
primary classes of our public schools to be
educated in the school system of this State
by saying that it refers only to teach
j ers to be engaged hereafter, etc.; and
' whereas, the real objection to this
â  feature is an objection of principle,
namely in the first place that every mother
knows that the requirements for teachers in
the. primary and grammar classes are far
1 higher, far more exacting than the require
ments for teachers in more advanced grades,
because not only is the schooling of the vast
majority of children confined to those grades,
i but also because the management of children
at the acre they frpquent those grades demands
the highest teaching ability; and in the sec
ond place that it is the right of American
parents to secure the best teachers, no matter
where educated, for their children; and in
the third place that it is unjust to our fellow
citizens from other States and other schools
to brand them with a mark of inferiority in
' our school system; and in the fourth place
thut this clause was inserted to carry out the
ends- of the A. P. A., which (like the coward
who inserted this clause Jn the charter) is
aftraid to say out before the people what it
really wants; and whereas, J. Richard Freud
states that this is a principle ot patronizing
home production ; and whereas, there 1s no
monopoly in brains and no tar. ff in learning:
and whereas, the schools of the people should
be open to all the children of the people,
whether as teachers or scholars; and whereas,
it is un-American, barbarous and absurd to
recognize in teaching any test but moral and
intel!eÂ«tual fitness; and whereas, J. Richard
Freud stites that if this principle is not found
a det-irable feature it can be amended; and
whereas, the charter can be amended only
within not less than two years and by a three
fifths vote of the electors and with the ap
proval of both houses of the State Legislature;
and whereas, it would be under these circum
stances about as easy to amend the charter as
for Mr. Freud to look graceful in a strait
jacket; andwhereas.it is dishonest to speak
of amending a charter which in all human
probability can never be amended; and where
as, it only befits babes and sucklings to build
up a structure in order to pull it down at once;
and whereas, sensible men, and women, too,
have learned to decline Grecian gifts or Trojan
horses and to have a reasonable dresd of
Chinese charters; therefore be it
Resolved, That we condemn Richard J.
Freud's letter as impertinent in its inception,
supercilious in its tone, fallacious in its reason
ing, sophistical in its deductions, misleading
in its insinuations and vitiated with untruth;
and be it further

its secretary to defend a bad clause in a worse

to say that it only acts on future teachers, or

"PROTECTION" IS THE
MANUFACTURERS' SLOGAN
"The Call" Canvasses This
City to Glean Local
Opinion.
ONE LIFE-LONG DEMOCRAT
NOW FOR McKINLEY.
Cogent, Concise and Scholarly Article on
This Grave Subject by Irving M. Scott,
President of the Union Iron Works.
"Protection" is the battle cry of the Re
publican party in California for the com
ing campaign. The contest is on in real
earnest, and this State has fallen into line
with those numerous Eastern States that
have subordinated every other issue to
that of protection to American .labor and
American industry.
From hill and vale, metropolis and vil
lage, farmer and manufacturer, comes a
shout for protection.
"We must have it," says the fruit
grower; "the Wilson bill has been our
ruin."
The cry is echoed by allâ raisers,
tobacco-growers, iron foundrymen, car
riage builders, shoe manufacturers, cutlery
manufacturers, and all who are looking
forward to the inauguration of McKinley
as the beginning of a brighter era, from
the closing years of which the country can
look back with a shudder at the calamities
and misfortunes incident to the Cleveland
administration.
The Call haa just made a canvass of the
leading manufacturers and producers of
this City, and the results may be briefly
summarized in one paragraph.
The opinion is almost unanimously
prevalent that so far as the fortunes of the
Golden State are concerned there is only
one issue on which the stanch Republi
can man-of-war should sail forth to con
quer the foe, and that is protection. Pro
tection is both her defensive armor and
her weapon of attack, the "Big Betsy" of
the campaign.
The money question, it will be found by
reading the following thoughts of those
who were seen on the subject, men who
are extensively engaged in the manufac
ture and production of Caliiornian ar
ticles and should certainly know whereof
they speak, is generally regarded as vital,
but in few instances is it considered the
living, breathing issue of the coming
campaign. That honor is accorded
â wholly and solely to the doctrine of a pro
tective tariff.
"What matters it," said an extensive
manufacturer, "whether monometallism or
bimetallism prevails when a man's pockets
are a stranger to both gold and silver?
Let us revive Californian industries, and
with plenty of money in circulation we
shall soon find the question easy of solu
tion." â¢
The whole situation in a nutshell is
given by Irving M. Scott in an able and
{scholarly review. Though the language
varies with the man, it will be found that
the general consensus of opinion may be
discerned in that article.
Porter Brothers.
A. W. Porter of the well-known fruit
shippers and packers was as enthusiastic
in his indorsement of The Call's policy as
he was emphatic in his denunciation of the
pernicious Wilson tariff. "First, last and
for always is protection the issue for Cali
fornians." he said. "What will become of
our orchards and vineyards unless we can
chut off the inflowing of foreign fruits from
the cheap-labor countries?
"The Call has sounded the battle-cry
for the Republicans of the State. We must
have protection. If we don't we will have
devilish little use or care for the money
question. Yes, lean see a great difference
in our business since the Wilson bill be
came a law. To any one of at. least a mod
erate degree of intelligence it must be ob
vious that the present depression and the
tight-bound times of the last three years
are due to the pernicious Democratic tariff.
Look at the depreciation Jn our real-estate
values! It can be traced directly to the
commercial gloom spread over the country
by the Wilson bill. I think we need go no
further. Protection should be the i3sue
throughout the Union, but particularly is
it the paramount question here."
HUnt Bros. Si Co.
â¢ One of the largest packing estab
lishments in Central California is that of
Hunt Bros. & Co. in Santa Rosa, Sonoma
County. The company employs between
700 and 800 hands, and its business aggre
gates hundreds of thousands of dollars.
J. H. Hunt, the founder and head of the
company, was in the city yesterday and
expressed himself strongly. He has been
a Democrat from the casting of his initial
vote. "Yes, 1 have been a Democrat all
my life, and am a Democrat still, but I
fear 1 shall have to vote for McKinley. Of
course, as a Democrat who came from a
race of Democrats, I hesitate about an
nouncing such a decision, but it is a
solemn fact nevertheless. There has been
a gradual decline amont; the manufactur
ing industries under the late tariff â or
during the last two years and a half â and
it amounts to the same thing, whoever
considers the situation. I concur most
heartily that the tariff is the issue in Cali
fornia above all others. Silver can take
care of itself until after we place our in
dustries on a prosperous and permanent
basis. It is not alone the manufacturers
and those engaged in the various depart
ments of commerce who are affected. The
farmers feel the pressure. Their products
are worth less to them during such times,
and in our business we hear their com
plaints on every hand. California must
battle for a protective tariff."
S. Koshland.
"Speaking as a wool merchant I must
confess that the Wilson bill was not as
harmful in its effect on the wool industry
as we all expected it would be. But there
is no cause for gratulation in that. An
evil is an evil, whether it is small or large.
I believe in the early adjustment of this
money question, bui I think the leading
issue in California is the tariff. By way of
illustration, here is a sample of cloth
which I received from a tailor friend this .
morning. It emphasizes the pernicious
effects of the Wilson tariff." Stripping
the edges between his fingers, he con
tinued: "It is apparently a piece of gray
striped woolen goods, and the average
â¢person would accept it for what it appears
to be. Row, look at this. A few threads I
of wool on the face and the rest is all
shoddy. Yes, that *c one of the effects of
the tariff. As to California? Yes, I think
the money question is of secondary im
portance. Protection is first. To be sure,
we want good money, but what use will
any money be to us if the industries are
not fostered? We want a market, and we
can't get our goods into any market with
a fair show unless we have protection."
J. H. Davis.
The San Francisco and Pacific Glass
Works are operated by a firm of three.
Every member of the firm is unqualifiedly
for protection. This is what J. H. Davis
has to say:
"I presume that our industry, more par
ticularly than any other, needs protec
tion. There is a great amount of ware
imported here; beer and wine bottles, and
demijohns, for instance.
"With the proper protection these can all
be made on this coast, and we are at this
time mating evtensive preparations to
put up a large concern for the manufac
ture of these various products. We fully
believe that we are {:oing to have protec
tion, and if we believed otherwise would
not dare to embark upon this enterprise.
Our hope of success lies with the Repub
lican party and protection.
â¢â¢There is no question in thlsrratter;
we simply find it impossible to compete
with the pauper labor of Europe in our
line. Under the McKinley bill we were
extremely prosperous, there was no lost
time and the men worked all the year
round. As soon as the Wilson bill came
into operation all the glass works in the
United States were forced to shut down at
some period or another, and some were
forced to ghat down entirely.
"Some of the members of our firm have
been East several times during the last
year to look up the latest improvements
in order to perfect the plant we intend
putting in. We are entering on these ex
tensive improvements with the full confi
dence that the Republican party will be
victorious November next."
G. H. Newman.
Newman, another member of the firm
that operates the San Francisco and Paci
fic Glass Works, is equally emphatic in his
advocacy of protection.
"Four years ago," he said, "glass-blow
ers in this establishment, as a rule, were
Democrats, but out of the 160 men em
ployed here it would be difficult â nay, im
possible â to find anything but a Republi
can now. The men are whooping it up
for McKinley. No more Democratic glass
blowers.
"You see, when the Wilson tariff bill
went into operation the most of them
thought that a& the price of beer bottles
would be cheaper beer would be cheaper.
But there they made a sad mistake. The
beer remained the same in price, but the
money to buy it with is missing.
"The money question is a secondary
issue. So far as we are concerned we are
willing to take either gold or silver in the
payment of bills, but taainly, we want our
men to work all the year round and we
cannot employ them without protection.
"Under the McKinley tariff we were
working all the time, but under the Wil
son tariff we have been able to work only
about two-thirds the time. This is the
general experience of glass manufacturers
all over the country."
George Palmer.
Palmer is another member* of the firm
which controls the San Francisco and
Pacific Glass Works. Like Ms colleagues,
he was ready and willing to express him
self fully on the question of protection.
"The laboring men in this line," he
said, "havo suffered a reduction of 14
per cent in wages since the inauguration
of the Wilson tariff bill. This is true of
the country at large.
"Since that time beer bottles have been
imported, both into this State and the
East, at prices less than they can be manu
factured in either place.
"i don't think the money question
should be taken into consideration at all.
There is nothing the matter with money.
What trouble we are having can bÂ«
amicably settled in due time by inter
national agreement, but protection is a
living, breathing issue, especially for Cali
fornia, and we must have it.
"Manufacturers all over the country are
now thinking more of protection than of
anything else, and we look to the Repub
lican party for our salvation. If we are
disappointed, farewell to Pacific Coast in
dustries."
George W. SlcXear.
"It is protection before silver in Califor
nia, by all means," said the great shipper
and now flour manufacturer, when asked
for an opinion. "Our industries are cer
tainly of the first importance and must be
protected. After that we can regulate the
money. But first we must have some
thing to sell and something with which to
buy before we can consider the medium of
barter and exchange. Our industries,
largely developed though they are, caa be
considered only in their infancy. They
need protection and The Call is right in
assuming that tariff protection is the par
amount issue in the coming campaign so
far as California is concerned. It would
be difficult to draw a forcible local com
parison between the effect of the McKinley
and Wilson bills. We import no flour, as
you know, but in other liney of trade one
must close one' 3 eyes to fail to seethe
cause of the depression. We are all natu
rally anxious to have a sound money
basis, but California is less interested in
the two metals than shn is in a tariff law
which shall enable us to do business with
the world on an equal footing."
J. I). Cnlp.
The largest amount of land owned by
one person and used for tobacco-raising in
California is that of J. D. Culp, Santa Clara
County.
"With proper protection," Baid Cnlp, "I
would have 500 acres devoted to the raising
of tobacco. All that is necessary is to pro
tect us growers of tobacco from foreign
competition. With that safeguard Cali
fornia could supply the world.
"During the civil war, when very little
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
l^t^/?^W^JM/ j^wi^/.
Editor of the "Call," San Francisco â Dear Sir:
In reply to your inquiry as to which I consider to be the
paramount issue in the coming Presidential contest I unhesitatingly
say, Protective tariff.
There never has been any trouble in obtaining money for all
the needed purposes of carrying on a manufacturing establishment
provided the establishment has business, and there has always been
a difficulty in raising money of any kind where the establishment
had but little business; not enough to keep itself fully occupied.
The relations between gold and silver now existing in the
country are as much a benefit to the workingman as they are to the
capitalist, and the relations of gold and silver are of no value
whatever to a workingman who is out of employment. The only way
to obtain either gold or silver is by working, and there is no con
dition of affairs that can be brought about by any political party
whatever that will enable a man to obtain money without giving its
equivalent in labor. But the direst distress Dccurs all over the
country where the industries are not in a healthy condition. Hap
piness, enterprise, expansion and advancement follow the line of
prosperity.
From the beginning of the settlement of America in 1620 up to
the present date, every period of protection to American industries!
has resulted in prosperous times, and every period of the absence j
of protection or low protection has always resulted in a depressed
condition of affairs with much suffering and trouble.
As the Government is for all the people, it seems to me that
to have the entire population profitably and permanently employed
must be of greater importance than any other issue that can be
presented, and I earnestly believe that if our fellow-citizens
will vote straight for McKinley and protection, upon the platform
adopted at St. Louis, all the results wished for will be realized
before his administration is ended. The very fact of his election
will be the spur to greater expansion, more confidence with capi
tal, greater chances of employment for all kinds of labor, and will j
start such an era which all have devoutly wished for during the j
last four years, and which will bring prosperity and the oppor
tunity of occupation to more people in the United States than any
other issue named by any party of any shade of political opinion.
Yours respectfully,
tobacco was grown in the South, I supplied j
the Eastern market with smoking and ;
chewing tobacco and cigars. If necessary, j
I could do vastly better than that.
'â¢I am of the opinion that even the Me- j
Kinley tariff was not high enough. We j
are anxiously looking to the Republican i
party for assistance as a drowning man
clutching at a straw, and if it gives the
necessary aid by enacting a high pro
tective tariff California is all right so far
as tobacco is concerned."
Jr.cob Brandt.
All the tobacco raised by Culp is manu
factured into cigars by Jacob Brandt at his
factory on Battery street, near Merchant.
Brandt is strong in his advocacy of protec
tion, and would subordinate every other
issue to it.
"I am a manufacturer, a California man
ufacturer," he said, "and from the stand
point of experience in my business I can
say that we need protection, and need it
badly.
"I don't believe the money question
should cut any figure in the coming cam
paign aa compared with protection. I re- I
gard this especially true of California.
"I am obliged every year to import I
many thousands of pounds of Havana to- j
bacco to satisfy the wants of consumers, ,
and it sends a large sum of money away
from the coast annually. It we could keep
that money in circulation in this State we
would have so much of it that the parity
or disparity in the value of silver and lold
would make little difference.
"Since the Wilson bill reduced the duty
on tobacco we have been forced to compete
with the coolie labor of the island of Sn
matra. What can a manufacturer do in a
case like that? Those coolies work for 8
and 10 cents a day and purchase all their
supplies from their employers.
"The only way we stand any chance at
all is in being properly protected. We are
hoping for the day to come when the Re
publicans will give it to us."
Sperry Milling Company.
Horace Davis, president of this promi
nent flour firm, said : "The Call is indis
putably right. Where will our orchards,
vineyards and other departments of agri
cuiture be if they are not protected? The
tariff is by far a more important issue /
to Californians than silver. What do we
care about money if we have to use it only
to pay debts? Look at our orchards. |
They are in their infancy comparatively. !
They mast be protected, and I should '
think that every man in California who i
has any connecaoi with her industries :
must see that protection is infinitely more i
important than the settlement of the i
money question. Tariff, and not silver, is I
our issue."
Fulton Iron WovkÂ».
James Spiers, the president of the Ful- '
ton Iron Works, proved a strong advocate ;
of protection. "It 13 certainly the lead- I
ing issue for California," he said, "and
the money question must taue a second j
place. Our industries are in the fostering j
stage, and protection should be the watch- i
word of all loyal Californians. Of course I
we cannot ignore the importance of the
financial question. We want sound
money, but the fight between gold and !
silver is secondary in importance to the
people of this State. Some time when I
am at leisure I would like to give you a
few facts bearing on the subject of a
protective tariff for Caiilornia."
Joshua Hendy.
Joshua Hendy, piesirfent and manager
of the Joshua Hendy Machine Works, is
unqualifiedly for the protective issue as
taking precedence over the money ques
tion.
"What would this State be without the
farmer?" he asked.
"Yet we are fast driving them to the
wall. Look at the wool and raisin indus
triesâwhat they used to be. What are
they now? I tell you the Wilson bill is
what broke California's back.
"Protection is what California needs,
and the monetary question can be con
sidered later.
"Then there is the Nicaragua canal. It
will give an outlet for all our products to
England and ottier European countries.
Why, the amount of lumber exported
would be enormous. I think San Fran
cisco should be the main harbor for all
the trade of the Pacific Coast.
"The farmers to-day are bankrupt.
What I mean by farmer is not only the
farmer proper but the fruit-grower, the
wool-raiser and all tillers of the soil.
"Nearly all the farms to-day are mort
gaged to banks, and the interest not being
paid, the banks will not foreclose on them,
because if they did they would rind the
property a useless incumbrance on their
hands.
"I have just returned from the East, and
I find that all the people I have met,
especially in ray business, talK tariff as
much as anything else."
Hawley Bros.
This firm is extensively engaged in the
wholesale and importing hardware busi
ness. The senior member of the firm
spoke intelligently of the business de
pression of the last two or three years, and
agreed with the Call that to this State the
prime issue is protection. "We cannot
gloss over the fact that there has been a
great business depression during the last
three years, " he said, "and the Demo
cratic tariff must bear the blame. Tne
finance issue does not affect us. That is,
it is not near so important â vitally im
portant â as that of a protective tariff.
On those lines the campaign should be
made by the Republican party in this
State. After the adoption of a policy
which will promote the prosperity of our
manufactories and build up our com
mercial interests, it will be time enough to
consider the money question. I could
almost say that it would then regulate
itself. The Call's theory is sound. With
out prospering industries we would have
little care or bother about money."
Wellman, Peck & Co.
This firm of wholesale grocers deals
largely in imported articles and should be
in a position to judge of the effect of dif
ferent tariffs on the business of the coun
try, and particularly California. Mr,
Wellman said: "The Call- has mapped
out the only safe policy for the Republi
can party in Californin. The tariff and
protection to our industries and commer
cinl interests is certainly paramount to all
other issues. At the East the money ques
tion will probably giva the impetus to pop
ular political enthusiasm in all tho parties
with iree silver as the jimcrack catchword.
But let them shout. The tariff I believe ab
solutely is of far greater importance to the
business â to all interests in this State and
'on the Pacific Coast."
Columbno CairiHge Company.
Mr. Glenn of this one of the leading car
riage manufacturing firms of the United
S :ites was very frank to admit that he
could not grasp all the intricacies and
subtleties of the tariff and finance ques
tions. "But," hecontinued, "l agree with
The Call that the first and foremost issue
for this State is tariff and protection to
our industries. Our company does a large
foreign trade, and naturally the tariff cuts
a large figure. I have always thought my
f-elf a McKinley man, but I am free to
confess 1 do not know just how I shall
vote until I see what the other party does,
i We all seem to be so badly mixed up on
the problem that it 13 difficult for one to
i get one's bearing. But as to California
! her chief need is the fostering of her in
; dustries. After that is accomplished to
j the satisfaction of all concerned it will be
! time enough to think about money. 1 '
W. T. *arratt & Co.
Benjamin Garratt expressed himself
strongly on the subject of protection.
"It is certainly the paramount issue in
California. I would like to see a sound
money, and I think silver should be a
legal tender, but for California protection
should be the first consideration. Unless
we have a protective tariff I cannot place
my goods on the market in competition
with the product of foreign manufac
turers. We are still in the embryonic
state so far as our manufactures are con
cerned, and we should have the fullest
protection. As to the comparison between
the McKinley and Wilson bills, or tariff
laws, I think it must he obvious to tne
most casual observer that the country has
suffered great loss under the present tariff
laws. California has been a great sufferer,
and our great need is protection."
W. W. Montague.
W. W. Montague of the firm of W. W.
Montague and Co. spoke very strongly in
favor of the protective tariff as being
paramount to all other issues.
"The main issue in this campaign," he
said, "is the protective tariff, and lhat
only.
"In the first place silver should not be
made a subject of discussion, as it is of
June S6, 1896.
/ >
too much importance to be understood
thoroughly and voted upon intelligently
by the masses without an educational cam- ;
paign.
'â¢Personally I believe that if the Repub- i
lican party should be successful at the i
coming electionâ which it undoubtedly i
willâ it would be only one or two years I
before an international agreement would j
finally settle the moiipy question.
"Protection is the groat issue in this j
campaign and the only one of singular lm- j
portance to California at present. I do !
not admit the existence of any side issues
at all. Upon protection we either stand or
fall."
W. Hinckley.
"I don't speak for the Fulton Iron |
Works or as a member of the firm," said
Mr. Hinckley, "but individually I must
say that all the silver men and money i
alarmists ore away ofl so far as California j
is concerned. The issue here is not coin â j
silver or gol<l â but protection to our man- i
ufactures. We cannot hope to cope with !
the foreign producer under the Wilson j
tariff, and of what good is gold or silver '
coin to us unless we can finger some of it '
and get an even toss up on the value of
our goods? Protection we must have, and
â¢silver may come afterward. Local indus
tries are the first consideration in the
coming campaign."
W. F. titzlus.
The cutlery side of the question is ably j
presented by W. F. Litzius of the Will & I
Finck Company.
"I think," he said, "that protection is
first and the money question can follow.
We want to keep as much of our money i
at home as we can. Entirely too much of
it goes to Europe now.
"Let the tariff be as high as it can be. It
will compel us to keep our money at home
and start our own manufactories, which
will put men into employment.
"What good does it do us when goods i
are cheap if we have nothing in our j
pockets to buy them with? For the last j
three years we have found that there has '
been a reduction of 25 i>er cent in our
sales. I think this (â¢tagnation is due en
tirely to the Wilson bill. Under the Mc-
Kinley bill we had an excellent trade, and
though everything perhaps was a trifle
higher everybody had money.
"As regards the money question I be- !
lieve it will find a solutionfor itself in good I
time, but what California needs now
wors>e than anytuinir else is protection."
Bisdon Iron Works.
'â The issue is protection and nothing
else in California," said Mr. Howard.
"For example, say our gold output is $25.
-000,000 a year. It may be less and it may
be more and silver may cut a figure. But,
however that may be.it does not cut a|
figure in contrast with the great problem
of protection. If the 6 or 8 cents a day
that our people spend for goods and arti
cles of foreign manufacture were kept at
home and devoted to the development of
home manufacture â right here in Califor
nia, to localize the illustrationâ the money
I saved the country would equal the output
lof our gold and silver mines. It is not dif-
I ficult to comprehend tlie eloquent mean
ing of these, figures. California of all
States is in need of protection. Our posi
tion is suet, that we are more in need than
almost any other State of the Union of \
those equalizing breastworks thrown up
between us and foreign cheap-labor com
j petition by protection. That is the issue â
money can come afterwards. To be sure,
we want all we can get, but devilish
little good it will give us until we have
something to sell at a profit."
Wales Palmer.
"I do not see how any one can confound
the political issues in this State," said
President Palmer of the Golden State Iron
Works. "California is surely in need of
protection. We are brought into constant
competition with foreign producers, and
there are only two ways in which we can
meet that competition with any possible
chance of selling our goods in open mar
ket at a profit. Yes, there are absolutely
but two ways. We must reduce the wages
of onr laboring men, artisans and skilled
mechanics to a level with those of the for
eign countries, or else place a tariff on
the manufactured article equivalent to
the extra cost of labor, freight ex
pense on raw material, etc. i have
asked many prominent Democrats,
many of them my close friends, to tell me
how we could compete with the foreign
cheap labor without reducing wages or

checking importations by a protective
tariff. None of them could unswer. Grover
himself had to acknowledge that the alter
native was a reduction in labor hire. That
was a nice statement to go before the la
boring classes. The Call is certainly
right in its conclusion. Protection is the
primal issue in this State. Money will
take care of itself, but under a Wilson
tariff our industries are defenseless. Apart
from what the issue may be in the East,
there can be but one vital question in Cali
fornia. Silver or gold money cuts no figure
until we have secured a profitable market
for our products. Protection is most de
cidedly the issue in California."
H. T. Scott.
My views may be put in a nutshell, so to
speak. The Pacific Coast wants protec
tion, and after that the coin can take care
of itself. I believe in protection and a
tariff that shall be sufficient to meet the
revenue requirements. The money ques
tion in all of its phases appeals to the best
intelligence of the country, but I do not
think it is the issue in California. We |
have to look to our home industries; and
a squabble over silver and gold cannot
protect them. Ido not wish to pose as an
advocate of any political policy, but I
have no hesitancy in announcing myself
as a protectionist â a protection just
enough to meet the just expenses of the
country. lam not extreme in my pro
tection ideas as you may surmise, though
I believe ti>e tariff rather than silver is
the issue in California.
Albert Derham.
The shoe manufacturers' side of the
problem is presented by Albert Derham
of the firm of Buckingham & Hecnt. He
said:
"I believe the question of protection to
I be of vital importance to California, where
! all our industries are in need of it, what
j we produce as well as what we manufac

KENNEDY, THE MARKSMAN
Startling Allegations Contained
in His Wife's Divorce
Complaint.
Why the Lumbar â¢ Dealer Tried to
Throw His Better Half Out
of a Winiow.
Albert W. Kennedy, son of John F.
Kennedy, of the lumber firm of Kennedy
& Shaw, and himself an official and stock
holder of the San Francisco Lumber Com
pany, is being sued for divorce by his wife,
Hattie E. Kennedy.
The Kennedys were married about seven
J years ago, but of late have not gotten
along as well as could be desired. In fact,
judging from the complaint filed yester
day, Mrs. Kennedy is fortunate in having
escaped death at the hands of him who
promised to love and protect her.
The complaint is a long one and includes
many specific charges of cruelty. Among
others, there is one telling how a warm,
palatable, recently-purcnased oyster-loaf,
which Mr. Kennedy had probably brought
home as a peace offering, was hurled at
the unprotected head of his spouse. As
might be inferred from the foregoing, Mr.
Kennedy was not at all particular in bis
choice of missiles, and is accused of
throwing almost every sort of liftable
household implement at his wife. Shoes,
hats and various other a; tides of wearinc
apparel are included in the list.
On one exciting occasion the lumber*
i dealer, presumably tired of throwing
I things at Mrs. Kennedy, reversed the or
i der of business. He tried to throw Mrs.
Kennedy at a hard, rocky piece of ground,
visible to him through an open window.
The distance the lady would have had
to fall before becoming a part j-yf thia bit
i of landscape is not mentioned in the com-
I plaint, but, however, that is unimportant,
I lor, owing to his lack of training in the
| castine of heavy weights, the versatile
i gentleman failed in his design.
Once and again he changed his marks
manship practices and, so the complaint
I says, lent more or less variety to his
cruelty by beating her. Occasions when
Mrs. Kennedy found it necessary to flee to
'â¢ the protecting arms of other ladies are
; mentioned.
A certain Trixey Marshall's name is also
dragged into the case, Mr. Kennedy being
i charged with bein^ too fond of her com-
I pany. Others besides Trixey are accused
but hers is the only name given.
Mrs. Kennedy asks for an absolute di
yorce and the custody of her child.

dore Sloat, and on the 9th of the month
there will be a celebration in this
City on Portsmouth square in honor of the
raising of the American ild^ over Yerba
Bnenaâ as San Francisco fiftj years ago
was known â and at the request of Major E.
A. Sherman and the Veterans of the Mex
ican war the members of the Exempt Fire
Company will have charge ol the raising
of th j flap on that day.
Ont he9th of September, 1846, the United
States sloop of war Portsmouth entered
the bay of San Francisco and in a short
time came to anchor in a cove formed by a
jutting of land which became known as
ClarKs Point and which is now the corner
of Broadway and San some street, and an
other jutting vrhieb is now the corner of
Sansome nud Lush streets. The point at
which she lay was between Merchant and
Sacramento, Montgomery and Sansonie
streets, at a point best indicated at this
time by the Clay-street msirket. The ves
sel, in command of Captain Montgomery,
lay broadside to the town of Yerba Buena,
having just came up from Monterey.
What occurred was told in the follow
ing language by C. E. B. Howe thirty-fire
years ago in giving his personal recollec
tions of early Ban Francisco:
The sloop-of-war Portsmouth lay broadside
to the town, and her open ports and waving
bunting to.d of some unusual ac ion. Pres
ently two boats, laden with seventy marines,
pushed off from the strlc of the vessel. In the
bow of tbe foremost bout stood the comman
der, and as the toat's keel grate 1 on the'
beach he sprang on shore and climbed the
bank that was a few feet above the landing.
The sergeant, with the colors, followed, the
men were drawn up in '.inc. and as they formed
a partial curve the lieutenant, W. A. Bartlett,
cried out: "Fell back on the left; keep your
line straight as a street"; then, after a pause,
with a comic leer at the captain, "straight as
Montgomery street," at which the marines
were disposed to cheer. Captain Mont
gomery cried out, "Silence!" as firmly as he
could, the while his face profuse with blushes.
The captain took the lead, while the
lieutenant commanded ; the band struck up
"Hail, Columbia," and the word "forward"
vu given. They marched straight forward
until they came in a line with the adobe Cus
tom-house on the Plaza, when the major again
gave the order: "Right Hank â march! up
Washington street." Several laughed, for they
were in extremely good humor, und as they
got opposite the flagstaff on the Plaza, again
he gave the order: -Comcany! by the right
flankâ march! to the flagstaff on Portsmouth
square." Then the company;did laugh; they
took tho town with smiles. The Sub- Prefect
protested in the name of the Mexican Govern
ment against tne invasion, but, as he spoke in
Spanish, his remarks were taken for congratu
lations.
The American flag was made fast to the hal
yards, and Captain Montgomery raised it to
the peak. All the town wm present, and two
thirds of the people cheered lustily as the
Btars and stripes floated out on the morning
breeze. Then followed thirteen volleys from
the guns of the marines, and an answering re
sponse lrom the Portsmouth. Captain Mont
gomery read Stoat's proclamation declaring
the surrounding country under American
jurisdiction.
That night a patrol guarded the town, and
all the neighborhood gathered at the puebla
of Yerba Buena to see the flag and gaze into j
the open doors of the Consul's cssa. The joy- j
ousness was contagious, lor the Mexicans got i
up an impromptu festival of their own, and all
uight long they kept up dancing and drinking.
When the morning dawned the postriders
from Monterey bad to wake them up from
their blankets to tell them the wonderful j
news; thet California was taken, and that the;
Americans were conquering Mexico, and soon
would move the seat of the American Govern
ment to the anoien t capital of the Aztecs.
The little sketch telia how Montgomery
and Washington streets and Portsmouth
square were named.
: 'Tbat was a great event," said James
o'Donneli, a prominent member of the
gallant band of firemenâ and there are
only a few of them left who will celebrate
the raising of the flagâ "farther reaching
from a political and commercial point
than those who took possession of the
country ever dreamed of. The develop
ments of half a century prove this. Cap
tain Montgomery had no idea of the wealth
of gold California irould produce, neither
did Commodore Sloat, who detached the
Portsmouth from his fleet to go north and
seize Yerba Buena.
"But there is one thing that Mr. Howe
neglected to tell. It was something that
happened on board the sloop after the
marines returned to the sloop. After the
ceremony and salute to the flag, the ma
rines, somewhat thirsty, drained their
canteen?, and before going aboard st;ip
again they wanted water to quench (heir
thirst. They all drank water from a small
stream that flowed into the bay near the
point of embarkation. When on the ves
sel the men were all seized with cramps,
and for a time it was thought there was a
visitation of cholera, but under the treat
ment of the ship's surgeon, who pro
nounced each case a severe attack o! colic,
caused by the water that the men had
partaken of, they all recovered in a short
time.
"O.t the 9th, which will fall on a Thurs
dayâand, strange to say, it was on a
Thursday that the flag was hoisted â this
10 San Francisco great historical cv ent, or
rather the fiftieth anniversary therao f, will
be celebrated, and the honor of raising the
flag has been given to the exempts. While
we highly appreciate this, we prefer to as
sist rather than take the lead in this mat
ter, and for that reason have add ressed
communications to Admiral Beardslee and
' General Forsyth asking each to taKe part
| in the matter, as the seizure was the work
of the United States forces.
"Still, the exempts will do all they can
Ito make the celebration. There will prob
' ably be the firing of a salute, music and
oratory, but as the boys are few in num
ber â less than a hundredâ and their treas
ury is very low, they cannot afford to get
up a feast such as they could do when they
[ had 1200 names on their roll.
â¢'There is one thing to which I would
like" to draw the attention of our mer
chants. The old exempts will, like tho
marines in '46, have work to do that will
make t era thirsty, and they are afraid
that if they are forced to drink the water
that flows from the faucets they and those
who will assist then may, like the marines,
be affected with colic. A. P. Hotalinc,
himself an old-time exempt, has assured
us that so far as he is concernea the boys
need not fear colic, as he will provide an
antidote, and if others in the same line of
business will help him there will not be a
colicky exempt, soldier or marine on the
ground on that day."
HE HELD UP HIS HANDS.
A. E Buckman, the Well-Known
Contractor, Robbed on
Ellis Street
i A Revolver in the Hands of a Foot
pad Was Too Convincing for
Any Resistan:c.
Jast how many hold-ups have occurred
since June 16, when the fool policy of the
Board of Supervisors of shotting off the
street lights was inaugurated, will never
be known.
Several have been published, but there
are a large number that are known only to
the "upper office" at police headquarters,
those reporting them having received
specific instructions to keep the affair out
of the newspapers.
Amone the number thus enjoined was
A. E. Buckman, the well-known con
tractor. About 2 o'clock Thursday morn
ing he was walking along Ellis street on
his way home. The moon was shining,
but he happened to be on the dark side of
the street.
When between Hyde and Leavenworth
streets a man jumped out of a doorway'
behind Buckman and startled him by say
i ing menacingly, "Hold on; I want you!"
Buckman wheeled round and was
| startled by sreing the muzzle of a revolver
in front of liis nose, it was so dark that
he could not distinguish the features of
the man, and he believes the man's face
was partially covered.
'Throw up your hands, and be quick
about it! ' was the next command. Buck
: man promptly obeyed, and the footpad.
| in a way that showed he was an old hand
at the business, soon relieved him of all
the money lie had in his jocketsâ s36 in
gold and silver â his gold watch and chain
' and other valuables.
Buckman and the footpad did not ex
change a word while the operation wns
going on, but after the footpad satisfied
i himself he had got everything of value
he said, "Now you can go," and disap
peared in tbe darkness.
The police were notified of the robbery,
| but the bold footpad is still at large. 1

MADE CHEAPER.
Position of the Railroad
Commission Relative to
Street Railways.
NEAR A CRUCIAL POINT.
Decided Steps to Be Taken at
the Next Session of
the Board.
MAY PUNISH FOE CONTEMPT.
Certain Wa'er Transportation Lines
Declared to B; Under Control
of the Commission.
At the next meeting of the Railroad
Commission, July 8, decided steps will be
taken to bring about a settlement of the
question of the board's jurisdiction in re
lation to street railways, with a view to
reducing streetcar fares in thi3 City.
Since the last meeting of the commis
sion letters have been received from various
street-railway companies, refusing to ac
knowledge the authority ot the board.
These companies had been requested to
make a report of their financial standing
and operations to the commission, but
positively declined to do so.
Meanwhile, the board had asked At
torney-General Fitzgerald to give it his
opinion on the matter of jurisdiction over
street railways and also over steamship
transportation companies, several of the
latter Having also declined to recognize
the power of the board to regulate their
charges for passengers and freight.
In a communication directed to the
commission yesterday the Attorney-Gen
eral gave it as his opinion that the board's
jurisdiction extended ovar all steamship
companies operating within the State,
providing the vessels of such companies
did not go outside of the marine league
limit from snore in traveling from port to
port.
This practically exempts the line of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company plying
between here and San Diego and the
steamers running between Humboldt Bay
and this City from the jurisdiction of tne
commission.
Suggestions are made by the Attorney-
General to the board as to the course to be
pursued to properly exercise its authority
over the water transportation companies.
In the matter of street railways, ttie At
torney-General refrained from expressing
an opinion, but suggested that the com
mission take snch action as would lay the
"proper legal foundation for a test case."
His communication in full is as follows:
I am in rtceipt oÂ£ your favor of recent date
relative to the "notice and order" sent by
your board to rertain steamship companies
and owners of steamers requiriug them to file
with your board reports containing certain
enumerated matters, and nulling my attention
to the fuet thai "vu 1 Wilmington Trangporta
tton Company has complied with the orders
and filed its report; ttie remainder have even
failed t Â» acknowledge receipt of the same, ex
cept the Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
which denies the jurisdiction of the board
over its affair?," and requesting me to take
such action as I may deem proper; also
inclosing copy of "resolution adopted by
the board In reference to street railways." I
am also in receipt of your communication rela
tive to your rignt to regulute the fares charged
for the transportation of passengers by street
railways wit mn cities and towns or between
two towns in this Stnte.
In reply I desire to state:
Fir-.t -As to steamship companies and own
ers of steamers, I hih of tne opinion that your
hoard has no jurisdiction "to regulate or in
terfere with the transportation of persons or
merchandise between points within the State,
if â¢ â¢ â¢ the transportation involves a voy
age upon the ocean," and that, therefore,
where the vessels .of such companies or own
ers "in making their voyages navigate the Pa
cific Ocean mere than a marine league from
shore," even though they touch at no ports
whi';h are not within this State, you have no
control over them whatever. (See I'ncilic
Coast Bteuubil) Company vs. Railroad Com
missioners. 18 Fed. Rep., 10; Lord vs. Steam
ship Company, 102 U. S.. 544; Cowden VÂ«. Pa
cilie Coast Steamship Company, 94 Cal., 470.)
If, however, th'j vessels of any of these com
panies or owners Uo noi go upon the high seas
in transporting passengers Â«nd merchandise
between points wholly within this State, 1 am
of the opinion that as to such transportation
between such points you have lhe power and
it is your duty "to establish rates of Charges"
therefor; that, for this purpose, you are
authorised by law to exsnhM the "book?,
records nnd papers" of the Â«'mn panics or per
sons owning such vessels and that you may
'â¢issue subpenas and other necessary process r
to compel the production of such of their
"books, records and paper- as you consider
it necessary lo examine. (â¢ onstiiuticn ol Cal
ifornia, suction 22, article XII.)
1 am further of the opinion that for the pur
pose of regulating the rates of tiny such com
panies or owners of steamers as are within
your jurisdiction, you had better proceed in
the manner authorized by the constitution,
and issue Mibpcnas duces tecum to the officers
of the companies or the owners of the steam
ers, nquiring them to appear before you with
such books as you wish to examine.
Therefore, if there are any such within your
jurisdiction, and it is your intention topro
ceed further against them. I will, if \ou de
sire, upon a written requaat from you naming
them and specifying what books, etc., you
wish brought before you, prepare the neces
sary subpenas.
Secondâ ln view of the resolution adopted
by your board at your last meeting, requesting
me" to take snen steps as may be necessary to
test your right to regulate the fares charged by
street railways for the transportation of pas
sengers, it becomes unnecessary for me to
answer your former letter uquesiing an
opinion upon that subject. I will, however,
comply with the request contained in your
resolution, whenever you lay the proper lesnl
foundation for a test c&se. This, in my opinion,
you have not as yet dove, and I will, if you so
desire, prepare such papers, to be served by
you as I deem essential for that purpo? o.
Railroad Commissioner James 1. Stan
ton declared yesterday that the sugges
tion of the Attorney-General would be
followed out at the next session of tho
board, which will be held on July Bâ a
week from next Wednesday.
He said the method pursued in the mat
ter of the street railways would, in all
probability, be the same as that recom
mended in reference to tho steamship
companies. Subpenas duces tecum will be
issued requiring the officers of the com
panies or the owners of the streetcar line 3
to appear before the commission with
such cooks, papers, etc., as may be neces
sary in the opinion of the board to arrive
at an intelligent idea of the investment,
revenue and profits of the company.
Commissioner Stanton is inclined to
exercise the full power of the board,
which, he says, is given the right to pun
ish for contempt the same as a court of
record.
He is of the opinion that any official
who refuses to obey the subpenas of the
commission should be punished for con
tempt, cither by fine or imprisonment, or
both. A more conservative method fa
vored by others is tl.at a refusal to obey a
subpena should be followed by an applica
tion for a writ of mandate to tbe State Su
preme Court, directed against the recalci
trant company or officer. The latter
course, it is claimed, wou'd raise the ques
tion of jurisdiction and settle the powers
of the commission in this regard for all
time.
In view of these developments the next
session of the commission promises to be
}f more than usual interest.

of Nervous Debility fll'Bii^Jj^^^p^^
when there is a cure ,Jf iM Q^^^^wK %
IT IS PITIABLE to think of the vast number of men who go on
from day to day suffering mental and physical torture as a
result of their weakness, while right at their doors other men are
being cured of the same disease. One who has not known it
himself cannot realize the feelings of the man in an advanced
stage of Nervous Debility, nor does he hear of it, for these men
do not talk of their troubles. Even when they are fortunately
led to use the remedy which is now so well known â Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt â and are cured by it, they do not mention it to
j their closest friends; hence the prevalence of this trouble and i
the means of cure are appreciated only by those who have had
experience.
Considering these points, it is worth while to note how many
men throw aside all feelings of delicacy and give to the world,
for the benefit of fellow-sufferers, the fact of their cure by Dr. j
Sanden's Electric Belt.
"I could dance with joy when I consider that I have been I
saved from the necessity of living the rest of my life in that
miserable condition," says J. A. J. Morse, Los Gatos, Cal., after
using Dr. Sanden's Belt one month.
Such gratitude must give vent to words of praise. Mr. Morse
is a man past his prime and was given up by Dr. Urquhart of Los
Gatos. He was in the last stages of Nervous Debility and is now
fast recovering his strength.
Mr. L. L. Jaccard, one of the best known and most respected
i men in Alameda County, in the jewelry business at San Leandrc,
was cured by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt over a year ago. Last week
he said: "I have no. delicacy in raakingthis statement. Your Belt
has cured me of a varicocele and weakness that has been slowly
destroying me for twenty-six years, and now that I am cured I
think it is no more than right to tell the rest of the poor suffer-
ers of it. A thing that is really good ought to be spoken of."
Mr. Jaccard is now one of the best specimens of physical man-
hood in Alameda County. He is fifty years of age, five feet nine I
inches in height, weighs 210 pounds and does not carry an ;
ounce of superfluous flesh. His form is a mass of muscle.
Strength of manhood is not dependent upon flesh. Fat men
are seldom vigorous. This strength : is in the nerves', and the
life is electricity. This explains the reason for the inevitable
failure of drugs and the success of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt in
restoring the lost power.
Applied for three to six hours in the twenty-four, at any j
time during the v day or night that is most convenient to the
patient, it , saturates the system with Electric energy (animal
magnetism), and this energy slowly; builds up the forces of all
vital parts. The vigor of manhood expands and becomes perfect
in two or three months.
"I received your Belt on February 9 last, and wore it for two
or three hours every night for about two months. lam cured,
and my partner, Henry Mauvis, used the same belt for vital I
weakness and it has cured him," says Julius Jahn, Silver Star,
Montana, May 17.
No remedy is so easy to use as Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
None gives such quick results. It has a patented regulator,which I
enables the wearer to turn the current on mild or strong at will !
while the Belt is on the body. It is warranted to last and give a
strong Electric current for. one year. It is by all means the
surest cure for any weakness. .
Young, middle-aged and old men should send for Dr. San-
den's famous work, "Three Classes of Men," which will be sent,
closely sealed, without marks, free. It gives full information,
and hundreds of letters from people cured. It may save you a
great deal of suffering. Get it. Address or call,

C Ã¼b.
Herbert P. Tyson believes that his char

a suit filed in the Justices' Court that
irmnihnn rnrtis defamed it. The damage
caused by this defamation is placed at the
modest sum of $299, obviously for the rea
son that a Justice of the Feace cannot al

this gives no assurance' that the trial will

Francisco Whist Club, and while the elec
tion was pending Defendant Curtis did
say in the presence of the directors of the
aforesaid San Francisco Whist Club that
"he (Tyson) was excelled from the Me
chanics' Institute for the use of profane
and vulgar language in the rooms of the
institute, and this charge caused the ap
plication for membership to be rejected."
In the complaint the aggrieved plaintiff
pays this tribute of esteem to the club
whose directors denied him admission:
'â¢The club is a social organization", and its
members are ladies and gentlemen of re

his application for membership was re

to a large circle of readers some observa

between profanity and whist.
Primarily it may be admitted that a re

the kind of profanity which the plaintiff,

mony that Tyson did swear himself out of
the institution.
The librarian recollects that a Mr.
Tyson, a young man of 30, accomplished
at whist and clever at che9s, did belong to
the institute about five years ago, but he
had no recollection or record that Tyson
had been expelled.
The librarian was not able to define the
degree or volume of profanity that would
be tolerated by the directors before a repri
mand was offered or what kind of un
abridged cussing would impel the board
to suspend or exr>el a member.
It is known that in the Pacific Union
Club a member may swear if Judge Wal
lace does not complain; in the Bohemian
Club if the mummy does not murmur,
and in the Press Club if the "kitty" is
wronged.
The librarian of the Mechanics' Insti
tute is not sure that there is any ironclad
rule about profanity upstairs in the room
where chess and checkers are piayed and
cigars are smoked. It is said that Mr.
Tyson's habitat was the room upstairs.
It is possible that an unexpected "check
mate" in chess may have caused him to
burst forth in profanity. Good men,
worthy of the companionship of noble
women like Anna Shaw and Susan B.
Anthony, have oeen known to swear under
the stress of sudden anger mixed with
surprise. Indeed, it is averred that as
good a man as General John Hewston did
swear when the artists in the redwoods
painted the general's dog to resemble a
zebra. A triumph in art was then
achieved, for the dog was painted so ar
tistically that the general did not recog
nize him.
Going back to ancient records it may be
recalled that Uncle Toby swore strongly,
and that Ethan Allen made his remarks
at Ticonderoga historic by saying that he
demanded surrender in the name of the
Great Jehovah and the Continental Con
gress.
Diligent inquiry has established the fact
that Mr. Tyson did not leave the institute
under a cloud of profanity, or, at least,
that is the recollection of the librarian.
What the rules are regarding profanity in
the Ban Francisco Whist Club cannot be
stated. In general terms the rules of the
American Whist League eoverning players
is silent on the subject of profanity, but
George Washington Beaver holds that
swearing is justifiable when one partner
asks twice in the playing of one hand
what the trump is. Lieutenant Carlin of
the United States navy holds that the
mere incident of having Ciittenden Thorn
ton for a partner is sufficient cause for an
explosion of profanity.
In citing these incident? it is not the
purpose of The Call to Drejudse the case.
The directors of the Progressive Whist
Club, located on Post street, between the
Pacific Union Club and the Savoy Hotel,
will probably go into court and tell to
what extent they were in fluenced by the
alleged words of Jonathan Curtis. In
many respects the cause promises to be
come celebrated, as all the social clubs
will note the trial with the deepest interest.

TROTTERS HAVE A DAY
A Large Crowd Attends the
Opening of the Season at
Ingleside.
HOMEWARD A SHIFTY HORSE.
After Winning Two Heats, Tog^'es Is
Beaten by Stain Râ Prince Bis
marck a Gam One.
The light harness horse had his inning
at Ingleside track yesterday, and it is
quite evident he is not a thing of the past.
It was the opening day of the Pacific Coast
Trotting - horse Breeders' Association's
summer meeting, and the adherents of the
trotting-horse and the "wiggler" were out
in large numbers, a conservative estimate
of the attendance placing the number of
people present at 3500. To be sure the la
dies were admitted without charge at the
gate and figured very prominently in the
grand stand. Two bookmakers and an
auction pool stand attended to the wants
of those who desired to speculate â and
they were many. The weather was not
the most propitious for racing, on account
of a stiff westerly breeze, and the track
was not as fast as that at Terre Haute;
but notwithstanding these setbacks some
splendid racing was furnished.
The races were judged by Messrs. A. H.
Cohen, J. W. Wilson and F. W. Covey,
and their decisions met with the approval
of all. The "clocking" was done by Dick
Havey and John Rogers. President E.
P, Heald was here, there and everywhere,
attending to the wants of the horsemen,
and his efforts were grently appreciated.
What the Australian starting-gate is to
the running turf Starter W. P. McNair is a
like improvement to the trotting turf.
The tedious, tiresome scorine that tended
so much to throw trotting events into dis
favor with spectators was noticeably in
frequent yesterday. The man from Wich
ita sent nis fields away with littie delay
and in fine order, many of the starts
coming in for deserved roqnds of applause.
Three events were apwn for decisionâ the
2:30 trot, the 2:15 trot and a purse for the
2 :25-class pacers. In the latter event the
new innovation of making each heat a
race was tried, and, as it was a hotly con
tested affair from end to end, is evidently
a success. Three heats were paced, the
purse given being $450. At the conclusion
of a heat one-third of this amount was di
vided between the first four horses at a
ratio of 50, 25, 15 and 10 per cent, accord
ing as the horses finished. Prince Bis
marck won three straight heats, and thus
secured $225 of the gross amount hung up.
The sport opened with a $1000 purse, for
trotters of the 2:30 class, best three in five
heats. When pool selling began on the
seven starters there was a lull. Auctioneer
Al Lieach vainly exhorted the crowd to
"start her a-going." It was quite evident
that something was going to be uncovered,
and some one was waiting for aomeoody
else to show his hand. Finally a little
man with a weak voice bid $10 for the
field, and a sedate looking gentleman
said $7 for another choice and took Medico.
A rather wise looking wayfarer tnen said
he guessed he'd have Homeward and got
him for $10.
Tnis latter speculator was evidently a
good guesser, for very soon Homeward
was in great demand. Homeward, who
hails from Fresno and was handled by his j

owner, C. E. Clarke, jogged around the
first heat in 2:21^. He then Drought $10
against a song tor all of the others. The
following two heats were repetitions of the
first, the Frasno gelding finishing eased up
in 2:23%; 2:23. He is a son of Strath way,
and as he appears to be the sort of laorse
to keep an eye on "as he waits along the
line," his name is now pinned in the hat
of all the circuit-followers. Medico, driven
by Charles Durfee, made a good showing
in the first heat, but the cuppy track was
apparently not to his liking, and he was
not a dangerous contender thereafter.
Auditor, wtio exhibited game staying qual
ities, took short money.
The 2:15 trot called out a field of six,
and was the sensational race of the day.
In the opening pools Stam B brought $20,
against $16 for the field, consisting of Tog
gles, Native State, Bruno, Chico and Jas
per Ayers. Tne favorite over which Jim
Dustin handled the feins was very un
steady the first heat, and cut but' little
figure. After passing the halfpole Tog
gles, who, by the way, is another son of
Strathway in the string of Owner Clarke, I
passed Jasper Ayers and Bruno and passed
the wire in a jog, three lengths in advance I
of Jasper Ayers, in 2:20%. After this ex- j
hibition Toggles was just the thing, and j
sold for $10, against $9 tor the entire field. \
Taking the pole from Bruno at the far I
turn the favorite placed another easy heat |
to his credit, finishing three lengths be- i
fore Jasper Ayres in 2:20%. In this heat j
Stam B again evinced a desire to go in the i
air.
But the next heat brought sorrow to the I
cainpof the Togsleses. Selling for $10, with
the field bringing but $4, he was cut off by j
Stam 8., who had now got down to work, j
at the half, and made a disastrous break.
Finally getting his liorse down, Driver |
Clarke decideu to go for the heat, and,
although the son of Strathway made up a
marvelous lot of lost ground, Stara B j
headed him out a length and a half at the
stand, in 2:18 V. Toggles still sold favor
ite, however, bringing $20, with Stam B
fetching $12 and the field $5. The hard
heat had not been without its effect, and
Stara B took the next two heats and race
in 2:19, 2:21%. In each of these two last
heats Toggles finished third, behind Chico,
driven by the clever reinsman "Jimmy"
Sullivan.
The 2:25 pace went to a ranK outsider in '<
the bettingâ Prince Bismarck, driven with i
exceile it judgment by A. McDonald.
T ere were five starters for the $450 purse, j
Before the first heat F. W. brought $10,
Bstella WilKes $7, the field $7. Nearly all !
of the "side-winders," with the exception
of Prince Bismarck, found too many egg
snells to step on, and iv a very exciting
finish the Prince landed the heat by a i
neck from Estella Wilkes. Still Prince ;
Bismarck found little favor and was an
outsider in the betting on the second heat, ;
the books laying sto 1 against him. Go
ing like clockwork he passed one after an- j
other of his more unsteady opponents and j
in a very close thing took the heat from I
Gladys W by three parts of a length in
2:24%. With 2to 1 against him taking !
the last heat, the Prince collared Ed Laf- ;
ferty, who left his feet fifty yards from the j
wire, and beat Diablo's brother a head i
in 2:25 amid great cheering.

NOTES.
The close finishes pleased the fair sex
immensely. They were all sorry to See
Toggles beaten, he had such a cunning
name.
Solo showed much improvement in the
third heat of the opening event.
A. B. Spreckels, president of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, who is as ardent an
admirer of the trotter as he is of the run
ning horse, was an interested spectator at
the races yesterday.
Estella Wiikes finished fourth in the
second heat, but was placed last for run
ning.
Stam B is owned by the Tuttle Brothers
of Auburn, one of whom was present at
the track and was highly elated to see his
horse win.
Harlan <fe Co. and J. C. Humphrey were
the firms booking on the tro f ,s.
The association is endeavoring to ar
range a special race for the pacers for next
week that will bring W. Wood, Waldo J
and some of the other fast ones together.
This would draw a big crowd.
Stam B finished fifth in thÂ» first heat of
his race, but was set back for breaking.
There will be no racing to-i lorrow. The
sport will be continued on Tuesday.
Homeward is said to have put in several
heats in the neighborhood of 2:15 before

Easy Punishment of Baron Kotz.
Baron Kotze, the slayer of Baron Schra
der in a recent sensational duel, has just
been sentenced to a two years' confine
ment in a fortress â the minimum possible
under the law against dueling. The Em
peror, following a custom, will pardon
Kotz after he has spent two months or six
weeks in one of the picturesquely situated
fortresses on the Rihne. That is the
atonement for a duel whose terms were
such as to make it virtually a murder.
Still the days of the duel in Germany are
are nearly over. All signs point that way.
Here is a funny story:
Two gentlemen in Strassburg, a small
town in West Prussia, began quarreling in
a hotel. The owner of the hotel finally
interfered, at which one of the belligerents
felt offended and sent a challenge for mor
tal combat to the hotel keeper. The latter,
however, smiled and said:
"I have no time to waste now, as I must
tap a keg of beer." ;

HINTON`S PARTISANSHIP
The Republican County Commit
tee Wants Representation
in His Office.
A Special Meeting at Which Expert
George E Lews Was Urged
for Appointment.
Registrar Hinton has displayed an un
precedented determination to make his
office a part of the Democratic machine,
and has so far accorded the opposite party
less representation and consideration than
any of his predecessors, either Democratic
or Republican.
The leading parties are equally inter
ested in the important work of registra
tion, in the canvass of the names regis
tered and in seeing that in the whole pro
cess of registration no jobs are worked in
by tricksters. It has been the custom to
give at least a quarter of the appoint
ment of registration clerks to the opposite
party and to afford the proper party rep
resentatives free facilities for checking up
the work of registration.
Members of the Republican committee,
Assistant Secretary Ricard and others
who have registration in hand complain
that Registrar Hinton will not allow
access to the affidavits of those registered.
He has also refused so far to appoint more
than three Republicans, and one of the3e
was given his place on Governor Budd's
recommendation.
The County Committee wisheÃ Hinton
to appoint George E. Lewis, who was long
chief deputy in that office, and who is
familiar with the work of registration.
But Mr. Hinton says that Lewis knows too
much, and he doesn't want him in his
office.
It was in view of this condition of af
fairs that a special meeting of the Repub
lican County Committee was held at Re
publican headquarters last evening, with
fourteen of the members present.
Chairman Man waring briefly announced
the purpose of the meeting and offered the
following resolution :
Wheeeas, It is our opinion that the Repub
lican party has inadequate representation in
the Registration Office of this City nnd County,
and believing that the party is entitled to
a representation which will thoroughly pro
tect its interests; and, whereas our party when
in control of the Registration Office has always
given due representation to the Democratic
party,
Therefore, we respectfully urge upon the
Registrar to grant us such representation and
Â«t would recommend as a competent man,
than whom there is none better informed as to
the details of registration and one whose in
tegrity this committee vouches for, George E.
Lewis, and we would herewith most earnestly
urge his appointment.
We would further reserve the privilege of
making further recommendations whenever
additional necessary help in the administra
tion of the office may entitle us to more repre
sentation. We fully believe that the Registrar
will manage his office honestly and fairly, b.ut
suggest that a compliance with our request
will materially assist in convincing the public
at large of this fact.
On motion of J. M. Chretien the resolu
tion was adopted unanimously and a cer
tified copy was ordered sent to Registrar
Hinton and to each member of the Elec
tion Commission.
No other business was transacted. Be
fore adjournment Cnairman Manwaring
urged the importance of every committee
man doing all he could to promote early
registration.

UNDER A GLASS
The Opponents of Mrs.
Craven Searching for
Flaws.
A MICROSCOPE IN USE.
Members of the Board of Educa
tion Talk About the
Teacher.
MRS. CRAVEN IS STILL ILL.
No. New Move Made by Either Side to
the Controversy Yesterday.
All Busy.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven was too ill to be
seen yesterday, but her daughter Mar
garet, speaking in Her behalf, said:
'Mamma does not fear the attacks of
her enemies and those who are paid to op
pose uer in this matter of the deeds. Sne
is perfectly secure in her position and her
legul counsel will do the rest."
"What about this move in regard to dis
placing her in the Sctiool Department?"
"Nothing. Mamma does not believe
there will be any such move, whatever
may be the unguarded utterances of some
individual on the Grand Jury, or even on
the Board of School Directors itself.
Mamma has been in the department for a
number of years now, and her record is
one of nard work and great benefit to the
City. She will not discuss the question at
ail, except to characterize the suggested
movement as a cowardly and underhanded
attempt by some one with a grievance to ao
her an injury at this time. It cannot,
however, succeed."
Concerning the marriage Miss "Birdie"
said : "The marriage contract will be made
public in court just as soon after its arrival
here as it is demanded. Tuere is no dispo
sition now on mamma's part to keep back
anything that is in regard to this affair,
only that she is advised by her attorneys
to say nothing, and as they are in com
mand of the s;up now she must obey or
ders. Besides, she is ill to-day and could
not see anybody."
So far as the attempt to remove Mrs.
Craven from ncr position as principal of
the Mission Grammar School is concerned,
Mrs. Craven seems to have been speaking
by the card. A poli of the members of
tne school board made yesterday by Call
reporters discovered only two of the entire
number who were disposed to look with
any severity upon Mrs. Craven as a result
of her recent disclosure of her relation
ship to Senator Fair.
These' two â and Murdock â
expressed the opinion that Mrs. Craven's
usefulness in tue department was at an
end and that she thouid resign. Failing
to do that, the board should remove
her. Otners were disposed to quality their
censure, but a majority cried "nands off,"
aim a fair trial. That the matter will
cume before the board there is no doubt,
:;i.u it is possible tuat a special meeting
ariti be called to consider it..^^ --'^^
In the meantime the eyes of the army of
lawyers opposing the claim of the teacher
are bulging out with an eagerness for the
discovery of flaws in the wills submitted to
their inspection Friday night and yester
day. Yesterday representatives of both
sides were present when photographic
copies were made of the documents.
The lawyers in opposition to Mrs. Craven
declared tney had found yesterday a vital
flaw in the deeds, such as was calculated
to head off a few threatened and premature
wrinkles and to permit them to sleep again
at nights.
The n"aw was the omission in the de
scription oi the property of the words
"the City and County of San Francisco."
This, they say, is sufficient in itself to in
validate the wills.
"The Supreme Court," said George
Knight, ''has decided in so many words
that for the same reason â for a similar
omissionâ it could not recognize judicially
the location of Golden Gate Par*. There
may be Golden Gate parks in any city on
earth. Likewise there may be Sansome
streets and Mission streets and Fine streets
in New Orleans or Borneo.
"These deeds greatly simplify our case,"
continued Knight. "The question of com
promising with Mrs. Craven does not now
enter into it. We shall fight her on every
proposition. We are in position to prove
the biggest kind of a conspiracy, partially
carried out in forgery. We have the data,
and it will be forthcoming to show thai
this plot has been long and carefully pre
pared and deliberately carried out."
R. B. Mitchell conversed along the same
lines, and Charles Hegjrerty went away on
a vacation.
Reuben Lloyd was equally sanguine of
being able to prove the deeds to be forger
ies. He said that the signature of James
G. Fair on one of the deeds was written, to
all appearances, over an erasure, also the
date, September 8, 1894. He thought that
something more might be revealed under
the microscope.
On the other hand the attorneys for Mrs.
Fair are as entirely and quietly confident
as the others are boisterous.
VIEWS OF DIRECTORS.
What They Have to Say Regarding
Mrs. Craven and Her Relation
ship to the School.
The views of the School Directors con
cerning the propriety of Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven retaining her position in the de
partment, since the puolicity ehe has at
tained in the matter of the Fair will and
its attendant developments, are to an ex
tent divided. A few of the directors are
avowedly hostile to the lady, and say
that if not willing to resign steps should
be taken for her removal, but in the
opinion of the majority there exists no
sufficient reason for any such action.
President H. T. Scott of the Board of
Education, while unwilling to discuss the
topic, expresses the opinion that Mrs.
Craven should at least be suspended from
duty pending me decision of the court in
the Pair will case.
"Her continued presence in the depart
ment under the existing circumstances,"
Baid Director C. A. Murdock, the chairman
of the classification committee, "is very
demoralizing and ought not to be toler
ated. The interest of a school is always
of greater importance than the personal
interests of any principal or teacher. It
is immaterial, in my judgment, whether
Mrs. Craven be right or wrong in her con
test over the Fair estate. In either case
phe should resign from the school depart
ment. Ido not know yet what we can do
about it, but shall look into the circum
stances at my earliest convenience and
recommend some definite line of action."
"The professional reputation borne by
Mrs. Craven," said Director H. C. Hender
son, "is deservedly high and second to
that of nobody in the department. She is
a fine principal, popular alike with her
teachers and pupils, and tier school, the
Mission Grammar, is not surpassed by
any other school in the City for its ex
cellence of scholarship and discipline.
There is not now an tr an ti -marriage rule in
existence, and if there were it would
undoubtedly be declared unconstitutional
by the courts. At this time we have
literally no grounds upon whicti to base
any action against the lady. Let us wait
until the end of the litigation over the
Fair estate in which she is now so actively
engaged, and then, if she be proved to be
an immoral woman, why that's a horse of
another color. In the meantime, I think
it is wrong for us to cast any aspersions
upon her character."
"There is no better principal in the
School Department than Mrs. Craven,"
said Director T. R. Knox, chairman of the
rules committee, and I know of nothing
against her character. The Board of Edu
cation is a semi-judicial tribunal and un
til charges against her have been regularly
sworn to and filed according to our rules I
don't see that we are warranted in insti
tuting any proceedings against her."
Director W. F. Ambrose shared the
views of Director Knox, but Director An
drew McElroy was inclined to look rather
unfavorably upon the role played by Mrs.
Craven in the Fair will case, although he
admitted that he was unaware of any Haw
in her previous record as a teacher.
Dr. J. H. Soper, who was recently elected
to rill the vacancy for the unexpired term,
caused by the resignation of H. L. Dodge,
thought that if many of the things which
have Deen said about Mrs. Craven and the
late Senator Fair were true she ought not
to be permitted to remain in the Public
School Department.
"In view of the developments of the
past few days," said Director E. P. Barrett,
"1 should say that Mrs. Craven was not a
fit person to remain as teacher in the
School Department. If she had lived
openly with Fair it would have been all
right. Otherwise, however, her conduct
would seem to be very questionable. As
to dismissing her from the department,
the board has not that power until she has
been tried on specific charges and found
guilty. The rigut of demanding a trial,
having the benefit of counsel and calling
witnesses was given by a law passed not
long ago, which also provides that specitic
charges should .first be filed.
"Fault has been found with Mrs. Craven
before this for going East and n glecting
her duties at the Mission Grammar School,
of wiiich she is principal at the salary of
$17j a mouth. A year ago last December,
just before this board came in, Mrs. Craven
was expecting that steps would be taken
to remove her. Accordingly she obtained
an injunction against the old board, re
straining it from taking steps to oust her.
The next regular meeting wiii be held iv
July, but President Scott may call one
sooner. In fact, I understand he is going
to call one for next Tuesday. Until actual
charges are riled I believe and have advo
cated that Mrs. Craven should be tempo
rarily suspended."
Director Tuomas R. Carew said: "It
seems to me that the rule of the
board which was in effect at the time of
Mrs. Craven's marriage to Senator Fair,
and which allows no teacher to remain in
the department after marrying, would
furnish sufficient grounds for taking ac
tion against her. I believe that if the mat
ter were properly brought to her attention
she would probably resign. Mrs. Craven
certainly must have known of tfie rule,
which was and had been in effect for a
long time, and was only recently re
scinded. I believe that without a doubt
Mrs. Craven is one of the finest teachers
in the department, and I am personally
friendly toward her. I shall, however, do
my duty in the matter without any regard
for personal considerations."
"Mrs. Craven is one of the brainiest an!
ablest teachers in the department," de
clared Dr. C. A. Clinton, "and I should be
very sorry indeed to see anything arise
whereby we should lose her valuable ser
vices. As to dismissing her, the board has
not power to do so, unless she should be
found guilty, after due trial by the board,
on one of tne following specified charges :
Violation of rules, incompetency, insubor
dination, profanity, intemperance, un
professional or immoral conduct.
"Although at the time of Mrs. Craven's
marriage to Fair there was a rule which
retired teachers when they married I do
not believe sbe could be removed on that
ground. The Board of Education has no
moral and I believe no legal right to pass
sucn a rule, and my opinion is that it
would be held invalid in a court of law."
Director C. A. Hawiey was non-commit
tal, declining to say more tban that before
Mr-. Craven could be dismissed charges
would have to be filed and an investiga
tion Held by the board.
A PEOPLE'S PARTY ROAR
Populists Jump on Taubeneck for
Hinting at Fusion With
Democrats.
The County Executive Committee
Speaks the Local Party's Mini
on Alliances.
,
Ihe leading California Populists with
few exceptions condemn their National
chairman (Taubeneck) for his recent efforts
to get his party to abandon the graded por
tion of the road in making silver alliances,
and especially his talk which encourages
the hope that the Populists and Democratsa ts
may unite in behalf "ol silver.
The universal sentiment here is that the
Populists must be true to their party and
principles; tnat union with the Demo
crats would kill the People's party and be
absurd and impossible; that the only
union will be one with the Silver party,
which has renounced the old parties, and
that their National Convention can nom
inate nobody but a straight-out Populist. |
The People's party men think for them
selves and refuse to be bossed, and if
many of the delegates are of the mind of
those who will go from California Mr.
Taubeneck may cet a trimming down at
St. Louis wuen the National Convention
meets.
The first formal expression of disap
proval made here was made last night by
the executive committee of the County
Committee, and this expression is about
the sentiment of the State Committee.
The following resolutions, offered by Sec
retary George D. Giliespie, who is a mem
ber of the State Committee, also were dis
cussed with approval and unanimously
adopted :
Whereas, The People's party is a National
party, whose platform declares for the abo
lition of monopoly in all its heinous forms;
and whereas, the formation of this grand new
party has cost years of patient toil and great
personal sacrifices; and whereas, we
reel from the depths of our hearts that
unless the People's party principles are
put into practice and. the Government
returned to the- hands of the common
people, that despotism will rule tho lana and
tne Kepubiic be destroyed; and whereas, it is
apparent by recent publications that tue Na
tional chairmon of the People's party, H. B.
Taubeneck, has seen fit to convey the
impression that the People's party
would be willing to cast aside the
cardinal principle of anti-monopoly and di
rect legislation and assume ihe humiliating
position of being a tail to the Democratic
party kite, If the l)emocratk; pany would only
nominate a free-silver man for President of
the United States and adopt a free-silver plat
form as its pretentious creed.
Resolvtd, That we deprecate the thought thht
the National Convention of the People's party
would be willing to fuse with the Democratic
party, and its confused conglomeration of
theories of how to run the Government in the
interest of the people of these United States
and at the same time in the interest of foreign
capitalists.
Resolved, That we believe that the present
boom for free silver In the Democratic party is
based upon thj false assumption that the Pop
uh.-ts would indorse their candidate, and
nothing else.
Resolved, That we deem it entirely unwar
ranted and wnolly at variance with the true

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
PREPARING FOR
THE FINISH FIGHT
Mr. Corbett Will Go to
Bartlett Springs for
Recuperation.
SHARKEY AS AN ACTOR.
The Sailor Lad Will Train in
the Climate Chosen for
the Fight.
IN MEXICO OR ELSEWHERE.
Th 9 Adventurous Career of Thomas
Sharkey From Ireland to the
Golden Gate.
The sporting world, with its ear to the
ground, is listening for no other news tban
that of the coming Corbett-Sharkey tight,
and from day to day the sailor (they call
him commodore now) gathers impor
tance. Th-re is talk and talk and talk
over the "finish" to take place six months
hence but stripped of its verbiage the
nude fact stands out that both men must
"build" for the event.
Sharkey must {ret some science to back
his wind, and Coroett must get wind to
| back his science.
En passant, what a composite man the
Corbett-Sharkey man is! "Well, the "Com
modore" and the "Pompado ur" will have
it out and the end will be known. In the
meantime there will be more talk and
talk and talk.
THE SAILOR LAD'S FUTURE.
Will Train In Mexico or Any Other
Place Where Ha Can Be
Acclimated.
Speaking for Sharkey Dan Lynch, his
manager, said last night tnat it had not
yet been determined where Sharkey would
begin training or when for his tight with
Corbett. In one of the underground pas
sages of the Alcazar Manager Lynch said
last night that Sharkey 's training ground
would not be chosen till it was settled, as
near as could be, where the big battle
would take place.
If it was in Mexico Sharkey would go to
some point in that country to train, where
he could become acciimatea and get into
the best condition for the contest.
In the event that the territory of the
tattle is located in salubrious Mexico,
instead of the United States, Sharkey will
t-ngage at least one Mexican sport to in
struct him through all his practice.
If the place of the contest finally appears
to be Mexico, Sharkey will devote about
live of the remaining six months to trav
eling around the country in theatricals.
He says: "It requires only from five
days to three weeks for me to get into
condition, for I am in condition nearly
all the time. I have been training for sev
eral years now, and I desire a little rest,
so that I may regain my natural energy if
I have lost an}'."
Sharkey has numerous theatrical offers
from Js'ew York, Philadelphia and Chi
cago, but he does not yet know which one,
if any, he will accept. Offers of from $100
to $.500 a week are coming his way almost
as fast as the wire;- can carry the news.
He will not accej.t any pugilistic chal
lenges, however, till the Sharkey-Corbett
fight to the finish is a thing of history.
At the theater Sharkey appeared in
green tights, and thouuh the "bouts are
friendly, he gives Needham, his trainer,
all the work he wants.
Sharkey has no time which is exclusively
his own now except in bed. Eight hours
out of the twenty-four are divided up be
tween business and visitors. It does not
make any difference whether Sharkey is
engaged in an important business proposi
tion or is on the street witn friends, his
time is fully occupied. He is inclined to
complain that he has no time to himself.
SHARKEY'S CAREER.
It Is a Panorama, and It Extends
From tha Antarctic Around
the World.
Life has its commas, its dashes, its ex
clamation points and its iuil stops. Tom
Sharkey is now at that point best ex
press d by the period or tne semi-colon,
which mean the grand divisions of things.
He has been a wanderer all the days of his
life uu to the present. He is now at the
velvet period of his career. He has had
his ups and downs, but he now poses as a
pugilistic "wonder before the glare of the
iootlights, and when off the stace and out
of sight reclines, with the purses and the
"glory" he has won, like the Caliph of
} Bagdad, on soft cushions at his case.
| hharkey's thoughts are uo more poetical
than the Equator is like the North Pole,
but after the years of storm the sunshine
has burst from the clouds, and he may
now say with the poet:
The night Rhall b" filled with music,
And tlie caics tliiu infest the day
Slml tola their tents, like the Ara'os,
And as silently steal away.
This sailor lad, without even a common
school education, is now a for him
self and lor theatrical managers. Be
tween the acts yesterday, when the lights
were low, the music hustied and the stage
in a shadow, the man who came out
grammatically and comparatively better
but pugilisticaily and superlatively best in
a four-round go with "Pompadour Jim,"
the world's champion pugilist, related
some incidents of his career.
Sharkey has been shipwrecked, frozen
at the south pole, hungry, desperate and
self-dependent, and he has, which he con
siders of greater credit than anything else,
"licked" every man and boy whom he
ever faced from Dundalk, County Loutb,
Ireiand, where he was born in November,
1872, to San Francisco and June 23, 1896.
The sailor lad ran away from his home
in Dundalk when he was 10 years old. He
kissed his mother one night more af
fectionately than usual, and his share of
the peat piled up on the hearth was a
little larger than usual, and that night
whiie the moon shone full on the green
isle's "Jakes and rills" the boy slipped
quietly from his couch and the next morn
ing was a seaman's appientice aboard the
good ship Madeline Ann, bound across
the stormy English Channel. He was as
wet with dashing foam as he was full of
ambition before the end of his first voyage.
"The sailor lad" was eighteen montns
in the coastwise trade around the British
isles. Then he sailed away for Calcutta,
and before he finally returned to the
mouth of the Tharufes he had touched at
Hongkong and Nagasaki. Sharkey has
been around the world. Port Said, Syd
ney, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn and the
Cape of Good Hope are as familiar to him
as the Golden Gate.
Sharkey is one of fifteen children. His
father, mother and the whole family are
all aliv. He has been back home only
once since he left it in the moonlight
fourteen years ago, but he said yesterday
tli ut if he heated Corbett in the coming
contest, which means at least $40,000 in
pocket, ne would be homeward bound
again, and, in addition to his presence,
otherwise cheer his parents' declining
years. Even in the bloodiest battles of
life there is some pathos and some
affection.
Klboard the XJTT i'hila-l
delphia, on which ho first sailed into San
Francisco harbor in 1894, Sharkey was
"master of arms." That means a sort of
policeman. Among other things it is the
duty of the master of arms to see that no
man leaves the ship without leave and
that no whisky is smuggled aboard in
canteens or oilcans. This is a responsible
position, and, while Sharkev says he was
hot hard on the boys, the official record of
his department show that he did his whole
duty.
Men aboard a man-of-war love no other
tune so well as a nianial one. The waltz
thrills, but the time, the tone and spirit of
battle and the march enthuse. The true
soldier does not shun battle in any form.
Accordingly it is related of Admiral
Beardslee that when he heard of Sbarkey's
first battle with Allen, he said: "They
are in the navy to fight. If they want to
fight let them." This increased "the saiior
lad's admiration for his admiral.
When Sharkey spoke of Quartermaster
Hermann, now at Santa Cruz with the
Philadelphia, he did so with a smile. He
says Hermann is a friend of his, and is a
good sport as well as a good soldier. From
Sharkey it was learned, though he was
unable to furnish any of the particulars,
that Hermann has a patent ou a gun for
which he was offered $10,000, a patent on
a bicycle for which be was offered $5000,
an invention on puncbing-bascs and their
platforms, which is a good thing, and that
Hermann is not only, in the language of
Mark Twain, an "ingenious cuss," but a
man who has the $10,000 to back Sharkey
that he said he had and would put up.
The future "coming champion, be
sides cutting ice off the rigging of the
ship George Howes in latitude 64 south, in
which latitude they found themselves be
cause the captain had not been able to see
the sun for a week, had his hands, feet,
nose and ears frozen in the work. He
took a course of treatment for frozen flesh
from the ship's medicine chest when he
got north into warmer air.
Sharkey was never licked at school. He
conquered all comers, and by so doing ex
cited not only the envy but the designing
strategy of his schoolmates and of the
other boys of the village. Once or twice
the boy who is to go ud against the cham
pion of the world in the next six months
was decoyed intÂ« a field, he says, and set
upon by four or five boys whom he had
licked singly. Sharkey said: "They did
not job me a bit. 1 licked them all. Pretty
soo:i they gave up tryine to lick me."
Sharkey was in a shipwreck off Sydney
Heads, Australia, in 1887. Then he went
into tbe Australian uold mines in their
excitinc time. He did not make his for
tune there and again took to the sea. He
was wrecked again off St. Johns, New
Brunswick, anu was four days adrift on a
lumber-laden Dutch ship bound frona
Quebec for London. They had to throw
the deck lumber overboard to save them
selves and the ship's stores were soaked
with the briny.
Once, when coming across the Atlantic,
Sharkey was pitched from a boat in tbe
davits to the deck and, plunging head
long against a steam windlass, broke his
jaw. >*o fist has ever done the same.
Having ieasted on yellow-back litera
ture Sharkey started out in the East Indies
to hunt Indians. "When askea for the par
ticulars of the expedition Sharkey laughed,
looked foolish and declined to relate them,
from which it is inferred that the sailor
lad is more successful in making sparring
matches for $10,000 a side than he is in
BOklping Indians in foreign pans under a
torrid sun. His trainer, Danny Xeedham,
could not be prevailed upon to relate the
story either. Sharkey gave him the other
eye.
CORBETT'S PLANS.
He Will Go to Bartlett Springs and
Regain Strenftth and Condition
Speedily.
Mr. and Mrs. Corbett went out to
spend last evening with friends. .Realiz
ing the importance of getting into con
dition early, the chaniDion went to bed
last night as early as 11:30 o'clock. He
will leave next Tuesday morning for
Bartlett Springs and begin getting into
condition at once. Mrs. Curbett m*y ac
company him to the Sr' r t n KS, but beyond
that period the champion will have the
most of the time to himself and get into
the best possible condition.
The champion knows that the scientific
degree of his sparring is all right, but he
recognizes that his stamina requires some
cultivation. If Corbett does not put Shar
key out in their finish fight for $10,000 a
side there will be much money and more
confidence lost on the champion pugilist
oi the worid.
After Corbett visits the springs and
amoii|; California friends a fewÂ»SweelÂ£3
more he may go back to Asbury Park,
N. J-, to go into training. The champion
recognizes that he will require much good
food and rest, in addition to his training,
and that the actual hard work of getting
into condition may be accomplished in a
coupJe of months.
NEARING FINANCIAL FREEDOM.
Good "Work Accomplished by the Ofll-
rials uf the V. ML C. A.
Largely througn depreciation of assets
relied upon in the erection of the new
building of the Young Men' 3 Christian As
sociation the board of management found
themselves about a year ago subject to an
indebtedness of $150,000. In order to raise
this amount they organized an aggressive
canvass, soliciting subscriptions for the
| cancellation of the floating indebtedness
| and the balance due on the new building.
The solicitation lor funds was made with
the condition that no [.ledges would be
binding or collectible until at leastsloo,ooo
of the $150,000 was secured.
On Monday evening, June 15, it was
announced to the board of directors of
the association that this amount had been
| pledged wljicli * - oul'i make the $100,000
collectible; and, in fact, nearly $50,000 of
the amount has boen paid in during the
past week and the balance will be forth
coming immediately. The institution will
need at least $60,000 more in order to can
cel all indebtedness and dedicate the
building entirely free of lncumbrance,
and the efforts of the trustees and di
rectors will not be relaxe 1 until the entire
amount is wiped out. The following cir
cular ietter, signed by J. J. Valentine,
president, and H. J. McCoy, general becre
tary, has been sent every member of the
association :
To the Mevibers of the Toting Men's ChriHian
Association, San Francisco, Cal.: In June. 1895,
the hoard ot management of the association
undertook to raise Dy subscription $150,000
to meet the indebtedness then outstanding
against the institution, jledges payable on
condition that no money would be called for
until #100,000 was subscribed. On Monday
evening, June 15, It was announced at the
meeting of the boards of directors a::d trustees
that the latver sum had been i ledged, leaving
a balance of $50,000 (with accumulated iuter
est) yet to be secured.
Taking a retrospective view of the situation
we realize that the raising of the remainder
will be ii harder task even than the securing of
the $100,000, which is now collectible, yet ihe
board o! management will not cease their ef
forts until the entire indebtedness Ik paid and
the property of the association and the wel
fare of the work assureu. Until this result is
reached it has been unanimously decided that
under no circumstances shall lurther debt be
incur red ,/and that the current expenses of the
association must be met by revenues derived
from rentals within the building, membership
fees and such special donations as may be ex
pecied from interested friends.
In order to do this each month the member
ship of the association should and must be
greatly increased, as this is one of the princi
pal sources of necessary regular income. We
urge every member to assist us immediately
by bringing into the Association at least one
new member. We believo this can be done,
and ii accomplished, as it certainly ought to
b", it will place the association, so far as
ordinary expenses are concerned, in fairly
easy circumstances. We trust every member
will heed this appeal and Lestir himsalf now
to assist In doubling the membership of the
association.
A grand ma3s-meeting of members will
take place at the association parlors next
Tuesday evening, June 30, for the purpose
of arousing new interest and largely in
creasing the membership.

THE CONTRACTORS
ARE CONDEMNED
Verdict of Coroner's Jury
in the Fifth - Street
Fatality.
THEY WERE CARELESS.
The Architect and Original Con
tractor Especially at
Fault.
THE EVIDENCE CONFLICTING.
Employes of the Various Con
tractors Hear Things
Differently.
Coroner Hawkins commenced an in
vestigation into the disaster on Fifth
street by which four lives were lost
through the collapse of a building last
Monday.
S. Kelly, owner of the collapsed build
ing, testified as to letting the contract for
its repair to Sibley & Gleason, and that
Sibley bad charge of the excavation.
A. 0. Lutgens, an expert, testified that
he was a contractor and had considerable
experience in that line of business. He
was of the opinion that gross carelessness
had been displayed in the bracing of the
building.
He explained that from all appearances
the jackscrews supporting the building had
slipped to one side, thus allowing the
bu<lding to fall.
On the Bouth side, facing Mint avenue,
laterai braces bad been placed, resting
against the cradles. In the opinion of the
witness such braces were wrongly placed
and not sufficient to fulfill the work re
quired of them.
John Sullivan and M. S. Stratton cor
roborated Lutgens.
L. B. Sibley, the grader who made the
excavation under the building, was called.
He did not commence work, he said, until
the house had been raised by Contractor
Gieason. Tnen he excavated around the
old foundation, bracing the basement wall
as he proceeded. Several braces were put
in, he said, from the wall to the cribs
with the permission of the house-mover.
These braces, he believed, were safe
and strong enough to hold much more
weight then was placed upon them. "The
sand," said Mr. Sibley, "was damp and
should have been held up by its own con
sistency. I don't think there was force
enough on these braces to upset the equi
librium of the building. The height of
the building itseif was great enough to
overcome any tendency of the sand to
crowd the wall inward. Besides these
braces there were several supports from
the ground to the wall.
The Coroner subjected the witness to a
close cross-examination on this point, but
he stated positively that the braces were ;
in place and that be had seen them since
the disaster.
Here Sibley was excused, and Engineer
Fhaughnessey being called flatly contra
dicted Sibley on the position ot tlie an
gular braces.
This contradiction led to the jury pay
ing a visit to the premises.
On their return Architect Koliofrath,
being examined as to the weight of the
chimney on the south side, said it would
be between five and six tons. This, how
ever, was supported by three shores or
needles.
Sibley was again called and asked as to
the height of the cellar and the manner in
which the bulkhead was braced.
He said the timbers used were 2x12 and
ten feet long, while the braces were GxG
and braced from both ends.
He did not notice any braces under the
chimney. The sills were sufficiently strong
to support the building.
Matthew Kelleher, houae-raiser, was ex
amined.
He observed one brace from the lateral
to the shoe. He could not say if the brac
ing was ail that was necessary, because
conditions might alter and no two cases
would be alike.
His opinion was that the brick wall
which was being set on the north side of
the basement had a good deal to do with
the accident, and to his mind this was the
cause, as the water washed away the sand
upon which the cradle rested.
Ellis Davis, a colored man. who was
Sibley's foreman, was examined. He was
under the building at the time of the col
lapse. He described how the bracing was
done aeain^t ;he rustic and not aga nst
the studding. He considered ir, to be
Glcason's business to see that the building
was properly braced up from the outside.
Y. Gleason, who had the sub-contract to
support the house on silts during the
time that the brick foundation whs being
put in, explained how he secured the
building, which was on the same principle
as houses are moved along the streets, and
in this condition he said it was perfectly
safe.
He attributed the accident to the care
lessness of Sibley in placing t;e braces
which supported the bulkhead on the
Mint-avenue side against the cradles upon
which the weight of the building rested.
Those braces tripped the house, so to
sp"ak, nnd caused it to fall.
He ha i caut oned Davis acainst putting
the brnces in that position, and, in fact, he
was so an^ry that he 9wore at him and
told him to brace his bulkhead wi h slant
ing timbers and when he had it secured to
take those that were against the cradles
away. He was positive that that was what
caused the disaster.
The Coroner nail Davis recalled to ques
tion him on this conversation, but the
man of color denied it point blank. This
brought Gleason to the witness - chair
airain, when he positively affirmed his
previous testimony.
Arthur Miller and Michael Howard, who
worked for Sibley, were examined as to
their conversation, but they heard noth
ing.
Harvey McGowan and Dennis Sullivan,
both of wLoni worked for Gieason, corrob
orated their employer in his testimony re
garding nis statement about Davis and the
braces.
E. Jewett was one of the men who was
under the building at the time of its col
lapse. His attention was attracted by
hearing one of the juckscrews fall from
its position on top of the cradle on the
side next to Mint avenue. When he saw
it fall he ran and sav*d his life.
Florin Bailey corroborated the last wit
ness on seeing the screw fall, and he, too,
ran out.
Cornelius Cronin, a brick-cleaner, said
that the braces put between the bulkhead
and the cradles knocked the pinnins from
under the house and caused it to fall.
This ended the testimony, and after
some hours' deliberation a verdict was re
turned which, after stating the situation
in legal form, condemned the contractors
in the following language:
We further lind that the architect, E. Kolio
frath, and the original contractor of the build
ing, Adam Miller, while said building was un
dergoing repairs and alteration;, were clearly
at fault and In error for allowing the bracing
to be done in what we consider a dangerous
and faulty manner, and in not ordering said
faulty bracing removed, and properly and
safely replaced by other and more effective
bracing.
We also consider that the house-mover. P.
Gleasou, was at fault, for the reason of allow
ing what he considered unsafe bracing placed
against his work.
We further hold that the excavator, L. B.
Sibley, was negligent and careless in placing
brae, s against the cribs, sills and hoes, and
should have made all his braces independent
of them.
We fina that the above parties are guilty of
blame for exercising undue negligence and
carelessness in pursuance of their wort, and
we believe that with proper care and judg
ment the accident could have been
avoided by all the parties interested in the re
pairs to the premises and we hereby charge
the above parties with gross carelessness.

A Reactionary Play.
The long-threatened reaction seems to
be setting in against the problem piay in
London. "Rosemary," a play which
Charles Windham ha 3 just produced, is an
idyl, an exact opposite to the problem
play; it is full of roses and sentiment, and
the old-time picturesquenessof sixty years
ago. "Rosemary" has achieved a great
success.
For three acts it is June of 1837, a time
of sliort-waisted coats of green and blue
and brown, with shiny buttons and white
waistcoats much in evidence, of red-lined
cloaks, white bats, and snuff-boxes for the
men, and for the women mid-parted hair
and ringlets, sleeves exuberantly topped
and bonnets almost â if it is to be con
ceivedâmore Hideous than the present.
And the story fits its setting; it is slight
and in a way old-fashioned and very
simple and all its characters the oldest
friends.
This one begins with an elopement and
NEW TO-DAY.
DOCTOR SWEANY
The Old Doctor, the Skilled Surgeon,
The Conqueror of All Chronic, Nervous and Special Diseases.
The Greatest Boon on Earth to Man
and Woman is Health.
The Glory of Man is His The Ambition of Woman
Strength. is Her Beauty.
Both Conditions Can Be Acquired.
The same foundation must be laid to build upon to reach the two conditions, viz.:
Strength and Beauty; and tnat foundation is health; with health the mind teems
with vivacity and freshness, the body is active and strong, ana both the physical and
mental being are alive to and in touch with everything which makes life bright, joy-
ous and happy.
Alarming Facts.
It is an alarming fact that three-fourths
of the men are lost to ail the attributes
which make the strong, brave ai.d noble
man. They are prematurely old and dis-
eased throueh excesses or unnatural i
strains which sap the fountains of life, de- I
stroy the health and strength, and finally ;
result in physical wreck. These poor vic-
tims, loaded with disease, remorse and
humiliation, silently suffer on, going from
bad to worse, until death closes the sad
scene. Muscular strength and manly
power are both based upon the one condi-
tion, and that condition is health. With
health all tbe essential organs of the body i
are capable of performing their functions
properly, producing mental brightness,
manly vigor and muscular Dower. Disease
robs the blood of its richness, tears down
the constitution ana destroys the mental
as well as the physical man.
But the Noble Work of Doctor Sweany, the World's Greatest Specialist,
Has convinced the greater part of the people of the civilized world that nine-tenths
of the chronic or lingerin : diseases of both men and women can be thoroughly and per-
manently cured. In :is treatment of tne following ailments, as well as ail special

the breakdown of the inevitable postchaise.
The lovers are sheltered for the night by a
hospitable, scatter-brained baronet, who is
nearing middle age; and who. by the odd
est coincidence, gives a like shelter that
same night to the father and motberof the
lady runaway. Then the baronet falls in
love with the bright and teasing girl, wbo
tills his bachelor ball with youth and color
and music; she is a desperate little fl.rt,
and makes her boy lover even more furious
than his wont when their gallant host,
having won the consent of the old people
to this runaway match, does his best to
break It off by making violent love on the
box seat as he drives the whole party to
see the coronation.
In London there is a lovers' quarrel; but
the older man â for whom, indeed, the girl
cares nothing â Lives up the fight at the
urging of an honest old friend, and goes
back to his loneliness.
This ends the play proper, but an epi
logue, charmingly conceived, shows us the
bachelor of 90 come to the same innroom
to see the rejoicing of the jubilee year of
1887, dimly rememberine the past across
this long half tentury. It is a sad scene,
of necessity recalling one of those dismal
tontine dinners to which groups of club
men of grewsome fancy were wont to
doom themselves â a scene which gives to
the whole play something of a wearied and
half-cynical moral; but it has an idea,
wnich is much, and its idea, its contrast
with the idyl that has gone before, is true
drama â which is more and rarer.
The terrible exposures made by Gordon
in 1879 of the cruelties practiced in the
Egpptian slave caravans aroused all
Europe, and compelled the dealers to be

Distressing Thoughts.
It is a distressing thousrht to learn from
medical statistics that seven-tenths of the
women of this vast country are suffering
from some chronic ailment, and in most
cases that ailment is peculiar to her sex.
With that fortitude wiiich oniy the true
woman possesses, she uncomplainingly
suffers on day after day, ye-, year after
year, with the false hope that nature will
some time remedy her trouble and restore
her health. With tbe great love for beauty
which every woman desires, she, with
paints, powders and lotions, tries in vain
to cover up the lines and defects which the
cruel work of disease has wrought in her
once beautiful face. There is but one foun-
dation for beauty, and that is heaith.
Health produces a mind teeming with wit,
the bright, sparkling eye, the rosy cheek
and the plump and well-rounded form.
With heaith the whole world is a world of
sunshine. With disease it is a dark,
gloomy, prison-like abode.
VTAMiriF Catarrh, ulceration and' acid
vlTlittil. dyspepsia, indigestion, pain and
fullness after eating, heartburn, water brash
and difficulty in swallowing.
HTTP SPI WX All diseases of the liver,
LllLll, 01 LFiL.I. spleen, bowels, all nerv-
ousness and reflex disorders, rheumatism and

worm, hip-joint disease,' old soreÂ«, fever sores,
stiff join;, bare !ip, spinal irritation, nervous

RI PTI Piles, fistula and all swellings
IIIJI I LIIL. and tendencies quickly cured
without pain or. detention from business.
HEART, BRAIX AND SERVES. ?â?Â»
dizziness of the head and palpitation of the
heart, difficult' breathing and suffocating feel-
ing, fullness of the head, a tired, irritable, dis-
contented feeling and fear of impending dan-
ger or death, a dread of being alone, or the re-
verseâdesire to be alone; if your' memory is
failing and you are gloomy and despondent, or
if you dream much and often and feel an aver-
sion to society, you are suffering from a serious
disease of the nerves, brain and heart. You
have no time to lose. Call at once and COX-
SULT THIS EMINENT SPECIALIST.

l'l I JIJ.-l>ilit3 \fl llU.ilLii. ing from any of
the diseases peculiar to your sex, such a* jail-

OUTING OF BRITISHERS.
A Rowing Regatta Held
Among the Vessels at
Sausalito
The Crew of a Head Boat Goes to the
Rescue of a Capsized Craft
and Loses.
Yesterday the British sailor boys in
port had a, picnic at Sausalito, an aquatic
picnic as befitting the profession. The
sturdy young fellows rowed boats, paddled
tubs, walked greased spars and did other
comical thines for cash prizes.
It was the occasion of a play-day given
by the captains of the English vessels here
and at Sausalito to their crews. Several j
hundred dollars was collected among the |
masters and given as prizes to the victors
in the boating contests and different games.
The following ships, which are mostly
all anchored off Sauaalito, sent their crews
to compete in the races: Orion, Hydera
bad, Wynnstay, Morven, Almora, Kil
meny, Ditton, Brabloch, Lyndhurst, Ec
clefechan, Verajean, Leyland Brothers,
Beechbank, Hahnemann, Hollinwood,
Iverna, Loch Broom and Primrose Hill.
All of the vessels, especially the flagship
Orion, were handsomely decorated with
bunting. The title of "flagship" was given
her out of regard to the iact that her skip
per, Captain Croudace, was masterof cere
monies.
The big Orion was aflame with her sig
nal colors, from tlying boom end to peak
and from yard to yard. Three or four
hundred visitors were assembled on her
decks, with a brass band to keep them
company.
One of the most interesting contests was
a race between the captains of ships lying
at Sausalito and the skippers of vessels at
San Francisco. The former were: Crcudace
of the Orion as cockswain, Kiddy of the
Frabloch, Walker of the Falklaridbank,
Newson of the Hahnemann and McÃryde
of the Wynnstay. The San Francisco
team were : Boyd of the Doon as cock
swain, Garrock of the EUisland, Buchanon
of the Beechbank, Morrill of the Vereiean
and Bailey ot the Leyland Brothers.
The boats started away with the eight
British captains tearing up the water with
their oars. On the second 100 yards of the
course an oar in the Sausalito boat
snapped in two pieces. This left three
rowers to contend against the other boat's
four. The luckless rower instantly faced
forward on his thwart and put his strength
on the single oar that was pulling against
the other bank.
However, the loss of the oar handi
capped the boat, and it would have been
beaten but for a blunder on me pan; oi
their competitors, who mistook the coirse
and were declared out of the contest, giv
ing the race to the crippled boat.
A number of other odd and amu ing
things occurred. During a race in wticii
the boats were being pulled backvHrd
with the rudder unshipped a small saiHoat
handled by one man capsized and the
leading craft in the race went out of ,he
course and rescued the person flouncer
ing in the water. In their generosity tley
lost the race.
There were several tub races, in wheh
the rowers made the most grotesque effots
to urge their bobbing, whirling, clucuy
craft through the water. The winner dg
tanced his competitors by reaching oat
ahead of his lub with his broad paddle
and pulling the water toward him.
Several of the races were contests whee
shovels were used instead of oars, aid
Indian canoe-fashion the tough-armed
lads paddled their heavy boats along.
There were a number of swimming con.
tests in which the boys acquitted them,
selves quite creditably; also punt scullim
and greasy spar walking, in the last of
which the competitors quite often tum
bled into the bay.
Among the guests on the Orion were:
Commodore C. H. and Mrs. Harrison, Mrs.
J. W. Harrison, the Misses Harrison,
Miss Flood. Miss Zarr, Herbert Martin,
Mr. Newhall and two sons, Ed Zook, J. C.
Beedy, Miss Bosqui, Miss Jessie Beedy,
Miss Rose Miller, Miss Bennett, Mis 9
Hamilton, the Misses Ludolph, H. and W.
Haley, the Misses Wasser, Miss Nobman,
Miss Nightengale.
GRAIN RATES REDUCED
Competition Accomplished What
the Railroad Commission
Was Unable to Do.
Old and New Figures Showing the
Reductions â Further Changes Ex
p?cted in the Future.
It is now but a little more than a year
since the Valley roaa began active con
struction work, yet it hÂ»s already become
an important factor in rate-making in the
section through wnich it ;is designed to
operate.
Relief was promised the farmers in at
least a portion of the San Joaquin Valley
this year, and that promise has been kept
by the directors of the competing road. A
schedule of grain rates was put in the
other day, making considerable reductions
from those in operation on the lines of the
Southern Pacific Company, and this
action of the Valley road has now been
met by a cut on the part of the Southern
Pacific Company, which up to the present
time has had an absolute monopoly of the
carrying business throughout the Sao.
Joaquin Valley.
When the attention of Charles F. Smurr,
the general freight agent of the Southern
Pacific Company, was called to the reduced
rates of tbe competing line, and he was
asked what his company proposed to do in
the matter, he remarked:
"We are a transportation company and
our business is to carry freight. We shall
simply have to meet any cut made by the
opposition, as we do not propose to be
driven out ot business."
In accordance with this policy, a new and
reduced urain schedule has been put into
operation by the Southern Pacific Com
pany. In the following table the new and
old rates are given, the figures being in
cents per ton of 2000 pounds. The rates
are for carloads of a minimum weight of
24,000 pounds, and apply only to the points
mentioned in the schedule. This is the
table:
llflHiiFsffiflrfH
This is designed simply to cover the ter
ritory from which the Valley road expects
t> haul grain this season.
No notice of the new rates was sent to
the office of the Railroad Commission, nor
was a copy of the schedule filed with that
body, as had been the custom previous to
the beginning of the suit now pending in
the Federal court to test the powers of the
commission.
Similar reductions throughout the valley
will follow as fast as . the Valley road is
completed to important points, for its rates
will in evÂ«sy instance be lower than those
prevailing, and the Southern Pacific Com
pany will be in self-protection bound to
follow tbe lead of its enterprising com
petitor. .
It will be a fight between a corporation
free from watered stock and inflated issues
of bonds, and one top-heavy with interest
and dividend bearing liabilities.

STAYING WITH MRS. TUNNELL.
Not Seeking for Dr. Brown, but May
Meet Hm Some Day
Casually.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
. 908 Broad way, June 27. :
Miss Mattie Overman and Mrs. Tunnel!
are stopr' n g a 1 the Victoria House, wnere
they will remain until Mattie is rested
' sufficiently to return to her parents in
TacomJ.
They came to Oakland after being turned
out of a lodging-house at Stockton and
carefully avoided going near Mrs. Baton,
who had previously announced that she
would not shelter them.
Mra. Tunnell says she is tired of the
Brown case, but Miss Overman still finds
satisfaction in discussing it.
"I was never treated so badly in my life
as I was at Stockton," said Mattie to-day,
"Dut I have not yet become accustomed to
my position in society. I suppose the.
world thinks I am 'a very naughty girl and
ought to be punished, and Dr. Brown
thinks fo, too, I guess. I placed a preat
social gulf between Dr. Brown and myself
when I made that confession to the coun
cil. I realize it perfectly, and so dues he.
He has to remember the barrier and live
accordingly. 1 shall never force myself
upon him and never try to see him, but
we are likely to meet casually.
"We were surrounded by churches and
church people in Stockton and we were
requested to leave the boarding-house. It
was a newsna^or man who invited us out
to lunch after we were turned out and he
said he would be glad to have us come and
Ftop at his house. I don't go to church
now and am not particularly enamored of
them. I would not go into a private house
nnless I was very decidedly ureed to do so
and my past was known. Mrs. Eaton,
dear Christian lady, was altogether too
premature when she said she would not
allow me in her house. She must appreci
ate cheap notoriety.
"Stockton is a stupid place anyhow.
When we were there we made no effort to
conceal our identity, and our landlady
lied about us, too. And she was a good
churchwoman.
"I t^ink after I am rested that I shall be
come a reporter. Men treat me better than
women do, aud I ihiiik I'U get along all
right. I will have to do something that
will not throw me with women much, be
cause they treat me so horridly. I don't
know just when I shall start on my
new career. I am trying to be a better
girl now, but society won't forgive me for
my past. Men don't think of such things;
they are more generous and broad-minded
than women. But there is one thing that
surprised me, and that is the way the

ALAMEDA TRAINS COLLIDE
An Electric Car Runs Into the
Narrow â¢ Gauge Road
Sprinkler.
Brakes Refused to Work and the Grip
man Is Cut and Eruised While
Saving a Lady.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 27.â Car No. 16,
belonging to the Alameda, Oakland and
Piedmont Electric Railway, while running
northward along McPherson 6treet this
afternoon, ran into the narrow-gauee
sprinkling train where McPherson street
crosses Central Avenue.
The car was in charge of Motorman
Pullman and Conductor Brooks, and the
watering train, consisting of two cars and
engine, bad Conductor Davis and Engi
neer Simons on board.
The train was struck with such force
that all the front part of the electric car
was shattered. The impact also threw it
off the line.
Only one passenger was on board, the
widow of the late Matthew Schneider.
Fortunately she was uninjured. The con
ductor received a cut and bruise under bis
left eye by the shattered glass while pro
tecting the lfidy, and was also severely
shaken.
How the accident occurred is not clear.
One person says the car did not stop before
reaching the crossing. The conductor
says he jumped off as usual before the car
had come to a dead stop, and he went to
to see if the line were clear. He turned
round and found the car coming on. The
motorman shouted he could not get the
brake to act. It was the motorman's firÃt
day on this branch line, and it is pre
sumed he was not conversant with his car
and the crossings.

COUNTY FRUIT.
Although Some Varieties Are Scarce
the Prices In M*ny Cases Are
Very IJow.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 27.â The Hay
wards Journal to-day publishes the fol
lowing:
This has been a peculiar fruit season.
Not to our recollection has there been such
a short Royal Anne cherry crop, and
naturally the price has ben gilt edged.
Black cherries have also been scarce, and
apricots are now reported at about half a
crop, bnt strance to say at present are not
exceeding $20 per ton. But an advance
may be expected any time. Quite a num
ber of our frnitmen made a ten strike on
currants this year. It has been several
years tince currants broucht from $5 to $8
per chest. This was caused in a great
measure by the mildew destroying a large
portion of the crop.
Now that the cherries are cleaned up the
next in season will be apricots. The re
cent hot spell of weather has greatly has
tened the "ripening of 'cots, and in a few
un hards we learn some fruit is already
ripe, but it will be over a week yet before
picking will commence. The fruit prom
ises to be exceptionally fine this year.
Hunt Bros.' cannery a? the depot fin
ished up on Royal Anne cherries Wednes

PULTON'S LARGE SEIZURE
Assessor Takes Charge of the
Pacific Postal Ccmpany's
Property.
The Right to Ra ; se a Corporation's
Statement of Valuation to Ba
Tested in Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 27. f
County Assessor H. i\ Dalton now has
on his hands Ihe local office of the Pacific
Postal Telegraph Cable Company and all
the poles, wires, submarine cables, bat
teries and other property of the company
in Alameda County. It was just noon
when he walked into thÃ local office with
Assistant District Attorney H. A. Melvin
and served notice of the seizure upon the
operator in charge, Miss L. Thompson.
The seizure is made under authority of
the statutes of the State, in default of pay
ment of the company's personal property
tax for the fiscal year ending July 30.
L. W. Storrer, superintendent of the com
pany, was present, and it was agreed that
Miss Thompson should act as receiver
and hold all receipts, subject to the order
of Assessor Dalton. Monday, July 6, has
been set as the day to sell the property, as
provided by law.
This afternoon W. S. W T ood, counsel for
the Postal Company, filed a suit against
Assessor Dalton to have a restraining
order issued to prevent him from seizing
and selling their property for an alleged
delinquency in the payment of their per
sonal property tax. Tne company claims
that it presented a correct valuation of its'
property at $9000, and that he raised it to
$22,350, "which makes the takss |3U2 25.
They pray for a decree ordering the
Assessor to accept $113 45 in full satisfac
tion for all State and county taxes, and
also to be restored to full possession of all
their property which he now holds.
Efforts were made to secure a temporary
restraining order, but all efforts to secure
a Judge to sign it were futile, and the mat
ter had to go over until Monday at 10 a. m.,
when it will come up before Judge Ogden.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
FROM SLAVERY
TO THE ASSEMBLY
Thomas Pearson Aspires
to Be Elected a
Legislator.
A REPUBLICAN ORATOR.
Declares a Colored Man's Chances
Are Good From His
District.
MAY GET THE NOMINATION.
At Present He Is Landscape Gardener
to th 3 City of Oak
land.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.'
908 Broadway, June 27. f
A man who was born a legal slave has
announced his aspiration to represent the
Thomas Pearson, Who Was Born in Slavery, and Now Desires to Be Fleeted
Assemblyman From the Forty- Eighth District.
Forty-eighth Assembly District in the
Legislature of 1897.
The declaration of Thomas Pearson,
! municipal landscape gardener of Oakland,
I to become an Assemblyman has caused
general surpr : se, and has caused many to
consider what chance a colored man has
to carry a district in Alameda County. A
few weeks ago a colored Republican uni
formed club was organized, and its mem
bership is rapidly growing. In the Re
publican ranks the Afro-Americans of this
; city will cut quite a figure during the pres
i ent campaign, and it will not be surpris
i ing if Mr. Pearson should receive the
nomination.
Thomas Pearson is an orator of repute.
He stumped the State on behalf of Estee,
and had that gentleman been successful
Mr. Pearson would have been happy for
four years.
He was born in slavery in Warrentown,
N. C, in 1856. in 1867" Pearson's father,
| who was then at the Mare Island navy
j yard, brought out his family and located
at Vallejo. In this place little Thomas
learned his alphabet and made his debut
in politics. Since coming to Oakland Mr.
Pearson has been very active in politics
and is very popular with his people. He is
prominently identified with the Colored
Old Ladies' Home and has been mainly
interested in raising funds for it. Person
j ally, he is very quiet and reticent, but his
1 ability to speak iv jublic has not been
overrated.
"I know of no reason why it should be
considered presumptuous for a man of my
race to aspire to the Legislature," said
Pearson this afternoon. "We have many
naturalized foreigners arnotu- our office
holders and legislators, and surely they
have no more right there than I have. In
California, and especially in this county,
there is less feeling in regard to color than
in any other part of the country. Ido
not believe that the unpleasantness re
garding the hotel accommodations for the
colored delegates to the St. Louis conven
tion would ever have occurred on this
coast. So long as a man is a gentleman
and pays his way he is a man. I don't
think that my constituency would oppose
my election simply because of an accident
of birth. I am out and that settles it;
defeat and I are well acquainted."
COHEN SURRENDERS.
Gave Himself Into the Custody of
Sheriff Knight of Balem,
Oregon.
OAKLAND, Cal.. June 27.â Chief of
Police Charles E. Lloyd received a tele
gram to-day that was a surprise to him
and to many others when it became
known. It was from Bhenff John Knight
of Salem, Or., and read as follows:
"I have got Meyer Cohen. Do you want
him? Gave himself up and will waive ex
tradition."
Word was at once sent back tbat he was
wanted and that an officer would be sent
for him at once. An officer will co after
him and bring him to this city to answer
the charge of forgery placed against him
by M. Greenberg of San Jose.
Cohen is the erratic newspaper man who
skipped out on the eve of his wedding with
Miss Greenberg. Ha had provided him
self with cash by having checks cashed
bearing the signatures ot his father-in-law
to-be. It was when these showed up that
the reason for his sudden departure be
came known. It is supposed his money
gave out and he decided to lake his
chances by returning. Many believe
Greenberg will not push the case.
McKINLEY IN OAKLAND.
Yistied His Brother, Who Waa a Coal
Merchant at the
Time.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 27.â David H.
McKinley, a brother of the Republican
Presidential nominee, was a resident of
Oakland for nearly ten years and kept a
coal office on the southeast corner of Tenth
and Washington streets. Mayor J. L. Davie
was successor to the business. Afterward
David McKinley went to the Hawaiian
islands as Consul and died on his return
a few years ago.
William McKinley, the center of all at
traction in the Republican and gold stan
dard ranks, in 1880 had just been elected
to Congress, but his health was such as to
make his friends feel worried concerning
hiVn. His physicians advised a change of
climate and he came to California. He
was then the guest of bis brother for nearly
a month. There are many who remember
him and his genial ways.
Near the coal office was Polk Gray's, and
during McKinley's presence in the city
they became quite well acquainted. Gray
describes McKinley as a most interesting
conversationalist and a man possessing
pleasing manners to a marvelous degree.
"I think," said Mr. Gray to-day, "that
he commanded more attention when he
spoke than any man I ever saw. He was
a very approachable man and made
friends easily. When he came into the
store there would always be several who
would drop in, and the moment he started
to tell a story or rej/ite an anecdote there
was perfect stillness, as his conversation
seemed to charm all."

Attorney Crittenden has developed a
habit in the cross-examination of the de
fendant in the Ash ley- Baldwin suit of
commencing proceedings each morning
with an excursion into the personal his
tory of the witness. This habit was not
departed from yesterday, and as a so rt of
appetizer Baldwin was called upon to
state from how many of his wives he had
been divorced. He said he had been di
vorced from only two. One of these he
lived wit'i twelve or fourteen years. An
other of his wives died after he had lived
with her about five or six years.
From this delving into ancient history
Crittenden brousht the case up sharply to |
the matters decidedly modern. After re- '
ceiving from the witness an acknowledg
ment that Mr. Unruh, hia first wife's first
cousin, had been rendering him assistance
in matters referring to the case, Mr. Crit
tenden asked: "Has Unruh been endeav
oring since last night to see a witness who
is under subpena for the plaintiff?"
Baldwin said he had no knowledge to
that effect.
"Have you sent any one- to see Mr. An
derson since you were asked Â«ibout him on
the stand? 1 ' asked Crittenten.
"I have not," was the reply. "I
wouldn't give (ive cents to keep liim off
the stand. I'd rather have him here."
The witness was asked if he knew a man
named Carl R. A. yon Arenholdt. After
hia Honor, the attorneys and the stenog
rapher had successfully struggled with
the orthography of the name, Baldwin said
he had met such a person.
"Did you send Carl yon Arenholdt to
Pasadena on business connected with this
case?' queried the examining attorney.
Baldwin said he understood that Aren
holdt was there on some such errand, but
he had no knowledge of it except the
man's own statement.
"Don't you know," insisted Crittenden,
"that Arer.holdt was employed to go to Los
Angeles to endeavor to get Miss Ashley
to compromise herself by some improper
act?"
"I don't know it," answered the de
fendant; "I heard so."
At this point Judje SlacK gave evidence
of an unusual interest in the proceed
ings. "Is this man the one who is said to
have carried stories to Miss Ashley con
cerning me?" he asked. Crittenden said
it was not, but he would reach him in a
moment. "I am very desirous that you
do so," remarked his Honor.
Mr. Crittenden then commenced upon
the tack indicated. In answer to ques
tions, Baldwin had admitted that lie Had
known a man named N. C. Carter, who
had been his friend for fifteen or eighteen
years.
"Did you ever have any conversation
with him about this suit?" he was asked.
Baldwin answered that he told him it
was a blackmail suit, but this was ordered
stricken out.
"Did you tell him to state to Miss Ash
ley that you had the Judge and the law
years all fixed in this case?"
Hardly had the question escaped Crit
tenden's lips when Baldwin exclaimed ex
citedly, "I did not, and he won't testify
so." He was warned by tne court to
answer directly.
"Didn't you send Carter to see Miss Ash
ler?" asked Crittenden.
"I did not," replied the defendant. "He
said he was going and I told him not to go
for me. I never received any report from
him and he had no authority to act for
me."
Judge SlacK expressed a desire to have
Carter in court and asked Baldwin where
be was. Baldwin said he was in Santa
Anita. "If you would iike to have him
here it would be no trouble to get him,"
be said.
"Can you get him here?" asked Crit
tenden.
"I don't want him," was Baldwin's
reply.
The circumstances ot Miss Ashley's j
alleged downfall at the Baldwin Hotel and I
the subsequent occurrences at Hotel Coro
naiio were then gone into at length.
Miss Ashley's visit to Hotel Oakwood
waa also exploited at length. Several
references were made to Andrew Ander
son, a former employe of Baldwin, and
from the manner in which the aged de
fendant answered it was evident Anderson
was persona non grata to the witness.
"Did you say to Anderson," asked Crit
tenden, "'I hear Miss Ashley has a baby
and there is apt to be trouble. If there is
I want you to help me lay it on Falvy.
It would be a good joke on Falvy.' "
Baldwin said he did not make such a
statement to any human being, and An
derson was the last man in the world he
would tell such a thing.
The witness was shown a cardboard
badge with a string attached. He was
asked if he recognized it. He paid it was
a badge of admission to the grand stand of
the St. Louis racetrack. 'That is not a
lady's ticket." he declared. "No lady
could be admitted to the stand on that
ticket."
Asked to explain the difference in price
between tickets for ladies and those for
gentlemen Baldwin said the former cost
$1 and the latter $1 50. When it was shown

that the ticket in evidence was marked $1
he said tbat he was thinking of tickets ad
mitting the bearer to the padaock as well
as the grand stand.
A race card of the Bt. Lonis track was
introduced in evidence. In each race
there were marks opposite the names of
horses. An effort was made to ascertain
if these were horses Baldwin had bet on,
but be declared he was unable to r mem
ber. "I very seldom bet on any but my
own horses," he declared, "and no one
bui myself would know what horses I did
bet on. I always keep my own counsels
about such matters." He denied that he
bad given the card as marked to Miss
Ashley.
The name of Colonel Pope, the bicycle
manufacturer, which has been allowed to
rest for several days, was again called into
the case. Crittenden wanted to know
when Baldwin had seen Pope. Baldwin
said he and Mr. Lloyd called on the
Colonel, accomparied by James R. Wood,
in April of last year.
Crittenden called on Baldwin to explain
a number of passages in letters written
and received by him. At 5 o'clock be an
nounced that he had finished with the
witness.
Judge Slack announced that he must
close the case in three days, even if night
sessions were required.
Reference was made by Attorney High
ton to the alleged statement of Carter,
tbat the Judge and lawyers had been
"fixed." Judpe Slack said he would like
very much to have Carter in court in order
that he might ask him some questions.
Baldwin said he thought ne would come if
requested, and Mr. Lloyd said that he
would bring him to court if possible.
Baldwin assured his Honor that he bad
too much sense to make the remarks al
leged to have come from him.
The case will continue Monday morning.

BURGLARS STEAL
WEDDING GIFTS
Ransack the Residence
of the Rev. John
Stephens.
RICH PLUNDER TAKEN.
The Pastor and His Wife Were
at Prayer- Meeting at
. the Time.
A BOLDLY EXECUTED BTJRGLABY
Entrance Was Effected Through a
Window and Escape Was Hade
by the Rear.
While the Rev. John Stephens, pastor of
Simpson Memorial Church, was advocat
ing the amassing of spiritual wealth at
prayer-meeting last Wednesday night
divera jimmy-wielders were ransacking
the reverend gentleman's humble cottage
at 309 Haight street with a view of laying
up a little earthly treasure in the shape of
numerous wedding gifts, which the doctor
and his wife had received upon their mar
riage day some six months ago.
The prayer-meeting concluded about 9
o'clock, and as the parsonage is less than
five blocks from the church it could not
have been more than a quarter past 9 when
the pastor and his wife reached home.
As he opened the aoor the doctor saw
one of the gas jets burning brilliantly.
The burglars, like the wise virgins in the
parable, had heeded the warning to "be
ready when the bridegroom comes," for
they evidently fled precipitately through
the already opened back door and gate lead
ing out into a little street or alley that
runs back from Buchanan street, just op
posite the Protestant Orphan Asylum.
Like the wise virgins again, their lamps
were bright, even if not trimmed, and the
flaming jet certainly "sent forth a radiant
lighc."
Seeing the light the unsuspecting I
preacher, who innocently thought that j
nobody would stoop to such depths of folly
and wickedness as to rob a poor Methodist
parson, asked his wife why she had left
the light burning. She was positive she
had put out the light. Then he noticed
that the door into the bedroom was un
locked, and when he asked his wife why
she had not locked the door she again was
certain she had done so, By this time
their suspicious were aroused and they be
gan to examine their belongings.
Mrs. Stephens' black silk dress was
missing, as were the doctor's overcoat and
a silver watch, which bad been presented
to him as a "pulpit monitor."
The bureau drawers had been ransacked
and all the wedding presents of the couple
were rnissintr. Mrs. Stet)hens usually kept
the gifts hidden in a secret place in the
house, but on the day before the burglary
she bad taken them out to show a friend
and had pushed them under the bed, in
stead of replacing them in their hiding
place.
When they made these startling discov
eries Dr. and Mrs. Stephens hastened out
into the street and told the story to some
of their friends who were coming up i
Buchanan street from the prayer-meeting.
One of them, C. B. Perkins, quickly noti
fied the police, who are now actively work- j
ing on the case.
Mrs. Stephens feels very bad over the i
loss, as the sentimental value of the wed
ding gifts, which had been given by
various friends, was much greater than
their actual vaiue, which, however, was
considerable, amounting to a couple of
hundred dollars.
The burglary of the house was a particu
larly bold undertaking, for the neighbor
hood is thickly built up and cars were con
stantly passing. Entrance to the house
had been effected by climbing up on a ,
fence and prying open the side window |
with a jimmy, breaking the catch by i
which the window was locked. The
burglars had then evidently opened the
back door and gate in order to escape read
ily in case the occupants returned.
Dr. Stephens believes that they were
busy ransacking the dining-room when
they heard the noise of bis key opening
the front door ana that they then immed
iately fled with their booty.
The empty Doxes in which the presents
had been packed were left scattered about
the bedroom. The silverware, which con
stituted much of the booty, was marked
with the owner's name, but if, as is prob
able, the burglars were professionals, this
mark of identification has doubtless been
obliterated.
Although the thieves were evidently
somewhat familiar with the house and
custom of the occupants to be absent at
prayer-meeting on Wednesday evenings,
Dr. Stephens and his wife have scarcely
any suspicions as to who the burglars
were.
The only one the doctor can think of is
a tramp who applied at the house at
various times, and wnom the doctor
gave work in the garden in return for
meals and other assistance. However,
the doctor has no further reason for sus
pecting him to be the guilty person.
Inasmuch as the police were almost im
mediately notified and Detective Dillon
was at the house a few moments after the
burglary, it is hoped that the thieves may
be captured.
PROF, HINRICHS` RETURN
He Comes to Conduct a Season
of Grand Opera at the
Tivoli.
His Views on Some Modern Com
posersâShocked at tne Dark
Streets.
Gustav Hinrichs, the well-known ope
ratic conductor, arrived here yesterday
evening to begin the rehearsal for his sea
son of grand opera at the Tivoli.
"It is ten years since I was in San Fran
cisco professionally. That was with Theo
dore Thomas of the American Opera Com
pany,'' said Mr. Hinrichs, when asked
about his recent movements. Although
he has been so prominently connected with
music in Philadelphia for the last decade,
Gustav Hinrichs has never ceased to look
upon San Francisco as his home.
Hi's family have continued to reside at
his house in the 2100 block on Pine street,
and whenever he has been able to steal a
month or two from his Eastern engage
ments, he has come to this city. It was
hrre that he composed his opera "Anti-
Ora, " for which Mrs. Toland made the
libretto, though the work was produced
in Philadelphia, where it proved a com
plete success.
Speaking of his earlier days in San
Franoignn, Oustav Hinrichs said: "It
was here that I first conducted at the old
California Theater, on July 23, 1871. so I
shall celebrate my twenty-fifth anniver
sary as a conductor next month," and in
reply to a remark that he did not look like
a man who had worked for a quarter of
a century as a chef d'orchestra he replied
laughingly, "I was 20 years old at the
time, and in the daylight look my 45
years."
For the last ten years Gustav Hinrichs
has conducted a season of grand opera
every year in Philadelphia. He is very
enthusiastic about the season just ended.
"Financially it was not a success; all
over the East the season was a disastrous
one, as the failure of Abbey and Grail
shows. We had a $50,000 guarantee fund
to start with, and were able to engage good
artists. I went to Paris and brought five
artists from the Grand Opera-house, as
well as Mme. Emma Nevada, and she is a
charminc: singer, a host in herself.
"Among the operas new to Philadelphia
that we gave were Ernest Reyer's
'Sigurd,' a magnificent work, and ttie
German version of 'Hansel and Gretel.'
The latter is very pretty and took splen
didly."
Speaking of new operas and composers,
Gustav Hinrichs expressed the most in
tense admiration for Puccini's "Manon
Lescaut," a work to which he gave the
first American production. "Compared
to Massenet's 'Manon' it is like a glass of
champagne compared to a glass of soda
water. Puccini is the most modern and the
most talented of all the young Italian
composers, and I consider that he has a
great future before him." That Mr. Hin
richs knows a good deal about modern
Italian composers is proved by the fact
that he was the musician who first intro
duced to America "Cavalleria Rusticana,"
"L'Amico Fritz" and "I Pagliacci."
The conductor was utterly astonished to
find the San Francisco streets in darkness.
"I did not know what to matte of it when
we got out of the business streets and
found no street-lamps," he said. "I re
member we had one experience of the sort
years ago, under Denis Kearney, but in
'96 it is incredible that such a thing should
be tolerated. I believe this is the only city
on earth that is in such a condition."
A number of the members of the new
troupe arrived from the East with Mr.
Hinrichs.

The St. George Club is rapidly acquiring
a greater membership and a greater
dignity. Plans for its new building have
already been approved, and the structure
will be commenced as soon as the contract
is awarded. The building will be par
ticularly handsome and complete. Much

thought has been given to the athletic j
rooms. They will be equipped probably
as finely as any in the world. In fact, the
St. George Club aspires, and with good
! pround, to be the Manhattan Athletic Club
of San Francisco.
The building will be two stories in
height, facing on Mason street, and will I
contain many commodious rooms besides
the large hall lor athletic exhibitions.
i This hall will contain every instrnment
for athletic recreation and education that
the mind of a muscle-making, sport-loving
man could conceive or devise. As the pro
nosed additions will cost a large amount
of money the members appeal to all Brit- j
ishers to assist them in establishing the !
recognized British headquarters of the
State.
The completed list, of officers of the club
reads now as follows:
William Greer Harrison, honorary president;
Percy Beamish. William Doxey, F. L>. Brandon,
\V. J. Field, Colonel a. Andrews, Charles
I LyonÃ, vice-presidents; N. W. Bolton, honor
ary chaplain; Edward Oliver, secretary; Frank
Winterburn, treasurer; W. G. Pope, sergeant-at
arms; executive committee â A. H. Rae-Brown,
F. S. Kemp, A. H. Tnrnbull ; boxing instructor,
Jimmie Carroll; wrestling instructor, Joe Ac
ton; musical director, Alfred Wilkie.
The fencing-master has not yet been de
cided upon, but will probably be Captain
Martin, late fencing-master of the Olym
pic Club.
The St. George Club has grow,n out of
the old organization, the Sons of St.
George. This drew the lines of member
ship strictly to "Englishmen, sons of
Englishmen or grandsons of Englishmen,
wherever born," but the present club has
taken down this barrier and considers
eligible to membership any gentlemen,
whether he be British or American.
The club now has on the roll more than '
300 members. It desires to emphasize the
fact that it is not a purely pugilistic club,
but one intended solely for the physical
development of its members.
There will be only occasionat athletic
exhibitions. The tirst of these is a match
be; ween Jimmy Carroll, the boxing in
structor of tne club, and James McAuliffe.
The time of this match will be somewhere
about July 27. A dispatch has been sent
to McAuliffe and the club is awaiting a
reply.
The St. George Club is affiliated with
clubs of like name in England, Africa,
Australia and in all the different States of
the Union.
Anti- Suffrage Club.
Ten ladies and two gentlemen were
present at the anti-suffrage meeting, held
under the auspices of Mrs. Carrie Murray,
yesterday afternoon n the Mills building.
Mrs. Murray made an opening address,
saying that to give women the ballot
would make them equal to men and de
stroy the home. T. Case said he thought
it was the proper thing to recognize
woman'j right to labor, but he did not be
lieve in giving her the ballot.
In intellect woman was man's equal, but
physically she was not strong enough to
stump the State.
Approbation was expressed for this
speech by several of the ladies present,
though strange to say, it was afterward
resolved to appoint two lady orators to
stump the State, in order to found anti
suffrage clubs. The selection of these
speakers was left to the president, and the
meeting adjourned, to assemble again ut
her call.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, tTUINIS : as, 1896.
YOUNG PIONEERS
TO OLD PIONEERS
A Progressive Element in
the Society Declares
Itself.
DEPRECATES "DRY ROT"
Parsimony in Policy Scored and
Liberality to the Needy
Advocated.
OPPOSITION IN THE ELECTION
The Younger Members Determined to
Stir Up the Society and Make
It a Center of Life.
The Society of California Pioneers will
hold its annual election on the 7th prox.,
and already there are unmiaiakable indi
cations of a lively if brief campaign.
The present reeime will apply prac
tically for re-election, but will be met by
an opposition ticket. The latter will bear
the names and indorsements of what is
known as the "young, progressive ele
ment." This element has declared itself
in a printed circular which will be issued
shortly under the auspices of a nominating
committee of the opposition stalwarts.
The circular reads :
San Francisco, June 27, 1896.
To the Members of the Society of California
Pioneer*â Fbllow-MSNBKBs: Our society, so
munificently endowed, seems to have struck
a "dry rot." The policy of the majority
of the present board of directors is re
sponsible for the state of affairs. In
stead, therefore, of permitting them to per
petuate themselves in office, we believe it is
high time ths society should elect a board
more in sympathy with their own views, and
one that will not ignore their wishes when ex
pressed at the monthly meeUiiK*.
We believe that the system of hereditary
oflice-holdin? under the parentage and patron
age ot" a board of directors who undertake to
decree from year to year who shall he the
president and who shall be the other officers oi
the society is an insult to the intelligence of
every old pioneer possessed of a modicum of
intelligence and self-respect; that it should
now be brought to an end by a vote of such
emphatic condemnation as will for years to
come set tbe seal of condemnation upon this
auiocratic mode of procedure.
We believe that it is time for the society as
! such to take the reins info its own hands, o<"
else acknowledge the in competency of the
general body of men who compose it to govern
themselves, and make over in perpetuity to
the few who are now running the institution,
so to speak, the power to act for indefinite
time to come and be content to drift with aim
less purpose, and so fairly earn that which
now seems generally to prevail in the public
I mindâ public indifference for the name of
I pioneer, if not public contempt at its mention.
A parsimonious policy seems to prevail in
the present board, and they fear to make
proper investments of the funds of the society
looking toward placing it in the front rank
of the leading clubs, associations or societies of
our City.
While not advocating extravagant expendi
tures, we submit to you that it is a sound
| business policy to place our society upon such
nn advanced basis that it will lead our mem
bers to gather oftener and in greater numbers
than they now do at our hall.
We submit that a reasonable percentage of
the magnificent endowment made to this so
ciety by James Lick should be so apportioned
and expended that old pioneers shall receive
substantial benefit from it while Jiving, in en
larged comforts, attractions, social opportuni
ty sand entertainment in the Pioneer build
ing, than the gloomy, forbidding and unat
tractive conditions which now prevail.
Willing as we are that the young men who
are to succeed us shall be Â«o well endowed as
to make them proud of and grateful for their
inheritance, we consider at the same time the
welfare, happiness and pleasure of the old
men, now far down toward the foot of the hill
of life, an object paramount to this and in
keeping with the wishes and intentions of
James Lick, to whose beneficence we in fact
owe our existence as an association.
The present dreary loneliness reminds us
that there is but little that interests our large
society sufficiently to bring them to its own
apartments.
.We therefore submit the ticket which we
shall hereafter inclose to members and ask you
to see that it is elected at the poll on the com
ing 7th of July, pledging our candidates to tne
following advanced platiorm:
â¢ Firstâ A sound linanciul policy that, whiie
it does not propose to belittle by the niggardly
plan so characteristic of the. present board of
directors, does not on the other hand propose
to spend our funds extravagantly, but by mak
ing our rooms attractive and offering a pleas
ant place for meeting for our members, old and
young, will actually increase our revenue and
make us nn "up-to-date" institution.
Secondâ A liberal policy to be pursued
relative to the relief ottered our members. We
pledge ourselves to do what we can to help
those of our members who really need it, ana
to do this in such a manner that no old
pioneer shall feel a sense of shame and humili
ation when he comes to the relief committee
for needed aid in his closing days; bur. father
that he asks, as he has a perfect." right to Â»sk,
substantial aid from the common inheritance
that was left and exists for the good ol us all;
that is not to De doled out by the unsympa
thetic and unpitying hand of rich men
to whom fortune has been so kind that it has
placed them beyond the conception of what
real want is, and beyond the pale of consider
ation for those who feel the relentless sting of
its torture. The time has come when worthy
old pioneers mast not be compelled to go. hat
in hand, "to the powers that be," to beg in
humble supplication for relief, but on making
known their need shall be graciounly and
kindly made to share a portion of the common
wealth of the association, and be made also to
feel no sense of moral or social degradation in
doing so.
Too often in the past favoritism has charac
terized our benefactions, and not a few have
had their last moments saddened by cold dis
regard on the part of those who should have
relieved and comforted them.
We are assured that it is the almost unani
mous sentiment of our junior members that
they have no desire to accept the magnificent
bequest this society will leave to James Lick's
generosity at the expense ot denying while liv
ing a reasonable amount of help to a senior
member or a decent burial at death.
We by no means mean to convey the idea
that we intend to waste our resources; but it
must be patent to many that some improve
ment is possible in the system of relief which
now prevails and has caused so much dissatis
faction among our members, and that improve
ment we propose now to accomplish.
Thirdâ We believe that there is as much for
the pioneer to do in 189ti as half a century ago,
and that we have still vigor and enterprise left
to continue to take the lead as then. We
believe in progress now as much as in the days
of 1849. We therefore confidently appeal to you
to discriminate in favor of the ticket we shall
hereafter present to you. Two of the present
board are upon it as" well as two others who
have been directors heretofore. These mem
bers are familiar enough with the affairs of the
society to properly inform tne new members,
and if you elect them we predict for our
society a new era of prosperity unparalleled
in any previous time in our history.
This society should stand unequaled by any
other. It remains for your vote whether we
shall have progress or continued "Dry Rot."
A quick, earnest, active and efficient campaign
of a week among your friends will settle the
question in favor of all we pledge. Our head
quarters will be made known in due season
and ample opportunity offered to all who
desire to do so to participate in this movement.

FOR THE NEW CHARTER.
Mission Defense l<nion Elects Delegates
to the Campaign Convention.
The Mission Defense Union held its reg
ular meeting last night at the corner of
Twentieth and Guerrero streets and dis
cussed the new charter. The union is
strongly in its favor, and a number of the
members spoke advocating its adoption.
They did not hold that the proposed
charter was perfect, but was an improve
ment on the old, and it would not do to
reject it.
Judge A. W. Thompson and Alfred Wal
com were elected delegates to the conven
tion of improvement clubs, which will
work in the interests of the charter.
Judge Thompson was requested to ad
dress the union at the meeting next Satur
day evening.
Popular Koute and Popular Kates.
The San Francisco and North Pacific Rail*
way is always to the front with popular rates.
It realizes that it traverses a section of country
which is unrivaled for beauty of scenery and
unexcelled for climate. It believes in a busi
ness policy of making people acquainted with
the country through which it runs, and ac
cords very low rates in order that they may
do so.
This year they will sell from July 1 to 3, in
clusive, round-trip tickets to Ukiah, its
terminus, with return limit July 6, at only $5
for the round trip. This gives an idea of the
low basis of rates established for the Fourth of
July holidays to all other points of its line.
On July 4 and 5 you can buy tickets to all
points above San Rafael at one single fare for
the ronod trip, good to return on either of
those days and also on July 6.
There are some people who can get away
only at this time to visit the resorts of Sonoma,
Mendocino and Lake counties, and in order
that all may embrace the opportunity greatly
reduced rates are offered. The tickets will be
on sale for the resorts from July 1 to 4, in
clusive, with return limit July 13.
A great many of our people who take their
two weeks' vacation about the 4th of July
now have an opportunity to make the trip and
save money. This line has thrown the coun
try through which it passes wide open to the
public, and we have no doubt many will take
advantage of this opportunity to have a pleas
ant time and renew their health. â¢

HORSE-SENSE IN
JUDICIAL DOUBT
How Mr. Dominick Roberts'
Steed Lost His
Mind.
FRACTURED HIS SKULL.
Collided With a Wooden Stool
on the Market-Street
Railway.
NOW A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES.
Railroad Company Suedâ Experts May
Be Called on the Horse's Men
tal Condition-
Dominick Roberts had a horse, a large
horse, a good horse. One day while Rob
erts was driving along Ninth street, com
ing into Market, the horse collided with a
wooden stool. The horse did not see the
wooden stooi, but as proof that human in
telligence far surpasses brute instinct, it
may be said that the street-railroad man
stationed by the railway company for
duty at tnat point never loses sight of the
stool.
Anyhow, Roberts' horse stu m bled over
the stool, and falling hit his head hard.
Roberts, in a suit which he has brought
in the Justices' Court to recover damages
from the Market street Railway Company,
avers that the horse has lost his mindjin
consequence of the accident and is no
longer of any value or use. Therefore, he
wants the company to pay the value of the
horse â that is to say, the value when the
horse was rational and sound minaed.
This suit is one that cannot be decided
in an off-hand manner. It will be the
duty of the court, perhaps, to call for ex
pert testimony on the subject of equine
sanity. It is just possible that a horse,
like a human being, may be sane on a mul
tiplicity of topics ana hopelessly "off " on
some single subject.
At the St. Lawrence stable the horse
people aamit that the trial must present
some new and profoundly interesting ques
tions on "equine jurisprudence,' ' or at
least when that language was used to the
boss stableman he did not dissent.
Another horseman present said he knew
that horses went crazy from eating rattie
weed, and that durine one year live horses
killed themselves by jumping over a preci
pice near Livermore. it was supposed by
the men at the St. Lawrence that both
sides would call veterinary surgeons on
the questions of the horse's mental condi
tion before and after the fall.
Barry Coleman of the United Carriage
Company was of the opinion that, if the
expert testimony should prove that the
horse was crazy, then it would be proved
that the horse had a mind, and having a
mind it would follow in the natural order
ot existence that the horse had a soul.
Dr. Chismure was sure that a horse had
a mind, something superior to instinct,
and cited as proof the intelligence of
trained horses. Instinct was not devel
oped by training, but mental powers were.
Mr. Coleman cited many instances of
horses getting 'Tattled" lioni eating rat
tleweed, and remarked that he never
heard of that weed in Kentucky and Mis
souri. He thought it possible that a
horse's brain could be injured so that the
animal would be worthless for general
work. One of the carriage company's
horses broke away once and ran his head
against a spike in a telegraph pole. The
horse lived a year, but Mr. Coleman did
not sue the Western Union Telegraph
Company for damages.
The case will surely call many expert
horsemen to the court, for it is admitted
by all of them that the question presented
is new.

ALL LATHEWORJO^^^^FDR TWO YEARS.
. A.L.BANCROFT & CO. 324 POST ST.SÂ£The initial appearance of the Youthful
Prodigy on a public platform made an im
portant event with patronizing society
folk and people who worship at the shrine
of art. The occasion was a notable one,
partaking in a measure of the nature of a
social function. The affair, being invita
tional, waÃ rather select. We may as well
follow the rule and remark that the audi
ence was "large, intelligent and apprecia
tive." The band played, the curtain rose,
and the manager indulged in a few pre
liminary remarks.
"My cultured friends," said he in his
blandest way, "it affords me unqualified
pleasure to welcome you here this evening.
The Golden West has given many a genius
to the country â in painting, sculpture,
music, literature and the dramatic art â
but never before has it been our privilege
to witness the appearance on a public
stage of a child so precocious, so brilliant,
so old tor his years, with a memory so
perfect and retentive of details, and
a faculty of illustration so highly
developed as the Youthful Prodigy
whom I now take sincere de
light in presenting to you. I have
journeyed with him from one end of the
country to the other, and he has met
thousands of people more or less dis
tinguished, yet if you will but mention
the name of one of the parties we chanced
to become acquainted with this child will
immediately recall some of that person's
characteristics, and will without any delay
sketch the features of that party in profile
with a fidelity to the original that will fill
you with wonder and admiration.
"The Youthful Prodigy will illustrate in
public to-night a number of people with
whose faces the majority of you are famil
iar. To increase your interest and aug
ment your enjoyment the various profile
sketches to be made here to-night will be
exhibited for what they are worth, artist
ically considered, and the intellectual
audience, it is supposed, will silently sup
ply the name as the features on each can
vass are recognized. The Prodigy will
I mention no names; but he will, neverthe
less, refer to the different likenesses in a
way that will convey to you an idea of his
remarkable scope of observation."
The Prodigy bowed ; polite applause
followed, and the youngster, seemingly
about 10 years of age. turned on his hpel
and quickly proceeded to the tall canvas
on an easel in the rear center of the stage.
Selecting a black crayon, he outlined a
head in amazingly short time, and then,
dipping a brush in an ebony fluid, painted
j the space bounded by the outlines, and
j with beaming countenance bore to the
front of the platform the canvas marked â
No. 1. Enthusiastic cheers gave ample
evidence of the fact that the assemblage
knew full well those classic features, and
was as eager to testify its devotion to ihe
I ideal hero represented there as to the mar
i velous skill of the Youthful Prodigy.
I Wiien quiet reigned once more the artist
in knickerbockers spoke: "Ladies and
gentlemen," he began, "our first profile
sketch, I am happy to say, has not been
made in vain. It is a far higher encomium
for whatever skill I may possess that your
cheers were not for me, but for the cham
pion of a cause that lies nearest your pa
triotic hearts, and I am proud to be able
to so faithfully picture his features to your
eye that your mind is instantaneously
dwelling on the virtues of his character
and the grandeur of his principles. Per
haps it would be appropriate to label this
canvas 'Protection.' But let us continue."
No. 2 was completed in a few minutes and
held up to the general gaze. A few shouts
were drowned in a chorus of groans. "As
much as to say," the Prodigy exclaimed,
"that four years of financial wreck and
ruin, low wages and free-trade competi
tion, industrial depression and costly gov
ernmental blundering have left their im
press so deep on tne popular mind that
the figurehead of the whole bad business
can hardly be forgiven."
No. 3 received quite an ovation, and the
child-artist said: "The Northwest loves
this man, and the Nation in whose halls
he has so long been fighting the good fight
of the common people may some day re
ward his splendid services, as it is about to
do in the case of the Napoleonic statesman
from Ohio."
No. 4 â Everybody Knew this face and a
smile overspread the face of the audien<e
as the Prodigy said: "This curly head
belongs to one whose fame-birth dates back
to a. minstrel show in what is to-day the
railway center of the San Joaquin. It be
longs to a fireman hrave and bold and
without a peer, and not afraid to say so.
We must, however, do unto him as he has
done by so many of the old-liners of the
Andrew Jackson camp â pass him by."
No. sâ "Ha! The audiencp cannot mis
take thÂ«se erratic features. Who, in faith,
can boast of such mustachios or of such a
goatee? They belong to an apostle of an
elder school of Pacific Coast journalism; to
a free lance of newspaper chivalry; to a
character so purely literary that commer
cial instincts have been crowded out of it.
Of course you know himâ every body knows
him. There is only one of his kind."
No. &â "The fair sex has Jong shown
something akin to partiality for the sil
very-haired and Bide* whiskered No. 6. As
hard as he battles against his uncompro
mising foe, ti.e Octopus, he still has a soft
side to his nature, and is, by common re
port, decidedly averse to the idea of 'un
kissed kisses and songs never sung.' "
NÂ©. 7â The Prodigy rushed out another
silhouette. "Here is a man who was born
with a gold spoon in his mouth. A jolly
good fellow he is, and who will blame him
for taking a jolly good time? He has a
number of little worries, though, in the
matter of strange wills and stranger deeds

WHO ARE THEY?
of transfer; but then, nobody has a per
petual picnic. Many a man would laugh
all petty trials to scorn if he could, like
this one, be assured of at least a bottle and
a bird every day."
No. Bâ"The8 â "The railroad corporations know
this man well." said the child-wonder.
"They know from sad experience, for he
has fought them in an hundred courts of
law. His oratory has thrilled peopie in
every part of the State, and he has won
his way to the top of his profession. His
Napoleon curl cannot be distinguished in
this inky sketch, but you can imagine it
is here.
"No. 9 recalls some of the heaviest con
flicts in the history of the Ban Francisco
bar. The frosc of age is on his brow, but
be is still in harness. The old pioneers
swear by him." The Youthful Prodigy
now placed three sheets of canvas on
easels side by si'le and earned applause by
a surprising variation in his method of
work. First he penciled a nose on each
sheet, then 'brows above them respectively
and lips below, and when he had the trio
of profiles finished the assemblage was
loud in its praise.
"Xo. 10," said the prodigy, "is the ack
nowledged leader of his party in the
Golden State; chosen as such because his
object is the general welfare rather than

"No. 11 is an orator who, on great occa
sions, never fails to rise equal to the re
quirements; an ex-militiaman whom a
courtier of a Scandinavian king once de
clared quite equal as a commander to the
immortal Grant; a rival in eloquence to
the prince of after-dinner speakers.
"No. 12 âNobody who has sipped pleasure
at the feast of flowers in perfume-breath
ing Santa Barbara can have forgotten him.
He is not only a society leader there,
but a leader among citizens, and he keeps
in his pocket the keys that opened the
way to the freedom of the lovely old
town." Three more profiles were dashed I
off.
"No. 13â The features are known to you
all," went on the Prodigy. "His learned
brow is always visible in the strong court
| scenes of a ca.se of too many wills and too
i much handwriting.
"No. 14 belongK to the land of orange

"No. 17 is the profile of a scholarâ a
scientist who carries more geological
i Knowledge of the Pacific Slope under his
hat than anybody else â a man of brilliant
parts, courted in circles where intellect is
king.
"No. 18â Here we have an impression

tbispoint the youthful Prodigy announced
that the entertainment would be divided
into two parts and that the orchestra would
discourse a few operatic airs while the
canvases were turned and the stage placed I
in readiness for the other half of the pro- I
gramme. Applause followed the child j

music yielded pleasure and then the lec
ture was resumed. Three fresh profiles
wf re soon being discussed.
"No. 19â Humboldt County istheatrong
hold of the original of these features," I
said the Prodigy. "All along the Klarnath,
too, he is known as a terror to evil-doers,
and it is related that every brainy rogue
who flees northward gets a description of
him in order to risk no chances when a
man with this stout profile calls 'Halt!'

"No. 21 â The processes of the court of

individual whose facial shadow you see
bere. You may not be able to detect any
of his analytical shrewdness in the shadow,
but he lias more than a little of it, and his
hair has grown hoary in many decades of
service." Regarding the next three the
Prodigy said:
"No. 22 is the man who recently opined
that 'the Athens of the Pacific seemed
tired of the administration of an honest
Mayor' â you have a glimpse of him here.
When he was an everyday citizen, strug
gling for a slice of the bay shore, people
flocked to his standard; but his elevation
put an end to these relations.
"No. 23 is a placid countenance that
graces the United States District Court
and has been seen in the halls of Con
gress. The smile of No. 23 is charming.
The smile is there when the decision
means fortune for you. It is there when
you are undone by the decree.
"No. 23 can't help it. He was made
that way.
"No. 24â Who doesn't know him? His
virile eloquence, his legal fighting quali
ties, his purse that cheerfully yields to
courts the tax of ungovernable impetu
osity, his pungent wit at the festive board, I
his potent voice in a political cause that
he vainly strives to bolster, his fearless- ;
ness everywhere â what you haven't heard
of these things you have probably read
about, and yet he has a brother who is
just as serene as a summer day, who
speaks in beautiful metaphors and who
writes poetry while you wait.
"No. 25" â The Prodigy chuckled as he
daubed the black mixture. "The breezes
of the bay," said he, "love no better frolic
than to play among the wealth of tangled,
grizzly strings that depend from the chin
appertaining to the face in front of which
the unfortunate victims of overindulgence
in one of the unnecessaries of life daily
shiver and shake. But those whiskers are
not registered in Berkeley." The trio
plan was taken up again.
"No. 26 â This legal cut puts you in
mind of the legal adviser of our common
wealth.
"No. 27 â Down in Los Angeles every
body knows the Solon of the police courts
whose profile is seen here.
"No. 28 â Here you must certainly find a
resemblance to the man who built himself
a name by his brilliant and successful con
tention for justice in the case of 'The
Crime of a Century.'
"No. 29 can mean none other than a
San Francisco dreamer who finds beautiful
images imprisoned in clay.
"No. 30 wears the highest honors in the
gift of his State, and al: hough he started
in active life as a sailor lad and has always
been interested in ships and shipping, he
boasts that even in his retirement from
seafaring be has never been called captain.
But his name will forever be associated
with the naval station that will be planted
on Goat Island.
"No. 31 own? a military title ttat puts
him up in the front rank, and, further
more, he owns a name and personality
popular and influential in the U L
C , and in the politics of California.
Now for the last trio:
"No. 32 has only recently bean wedded
to fame. I may as well add that he is the
discoverer of the physical basis of life.
"No. 33 represents a favored appointee
of the Stocktonian chief executive. He is
one of thP few men in public life who
doesn't have to remove his hat to get a
hair-cut. The bristles on the top there are
not the sproutings of a new crop; they are
merely the dry remains of old stubble.
"No. 34 is a financier who dwells in
M-rc-d and who had the nerve to say
that Californians are an expensive people
and waste too much money on their liv
ing. Well, our way of living suits us and
what's the odds?" The hour was late and
the audience was assured that only one
more canvas remained. The profile was
soon painted and no sooner was it done
than a hearty-voiced man near the door
burst into a healthy laugh and cried, "Gol
darned, if there ain't Ole Bill!" And so
it was.
"No. 35," concluded the Prodigy, "is one
of the old war-horses. He has carried the
Jacksonian banner through thick and thin
and no office Â«a< ever too high or too fat
salaried to dumfound him in the hour
when proffer waited on acceptance. What
would the cohorts of Democracy in the I
West be without Ole Bill? It is quite j
fitting that we should close with Ole Bill.
The curtain will soon ring down on Oie
Bill's party and then O!e Bill will be a j
has-been â just like our show, which, I }
trust, you have all enjoyed."
The manager advanced to the footlights
ana gracefully thanked the audience, ac
cording to the time-honored system, .for
"its kind attention and worthy interest"
during the evening; for its "generous ap
probation" and for its "strong encourage
ment of budding genius."

An Exciting
Experience With a Jewfish at
Catalina Island.
Told by Hiss H. B. Freeman.
Not a sportsman in all Los Angeles County
has won larger success or displayed more
enthusiasm in jewfishing than Professor
Charles Frederick Holder of Pasadena, To
hear him tell how he hauled in a jewfish sets
one's blood a-tingling.
"Mexican Joe," he says, "one of the oldest
fishermen ot Santa Catalina, was my oarsman.
We tossed the anchor over, the rope ran mer
rily out, and the hook, baited with a^ix-pound
white fish, went hissing down. I sat silent for
half an hour, holding the throbbing line, when
suddenly I became aware that Its tension had
increased to a steady pull; then came a jerk
that carried my hand in the water. 'Jewfish,
sure,' whispered Joe. I paid out the line while
he seized the anchor-line ready to haul up.
When about six feet had gone over the gun
wale I stopped, and when the hne came taut
jerked the hook into the fish.
"For a single second there was no response;
then came a Jerk that almost lifted me from
the boat, and the line went hissing over the
rail like a living thins:. Nothing could stop
such a rush and I simply waited while Joe
pulled up the anchor, when I grasped the line
and braced back for the fight. The light boat
whirle"d around like a top and away we went,
an ominous wave of foam rising high around
the bow.
"A ten-foot shark never pulled harder than
this gamy flsh, and for five minutes it was a
question who was master. I took it in with
the greatest difficulty, gaining ten feet, only
to have the flsh rush toward me and then dash
away with an impetus that was more than
irresistible. Occasionaly it would turn and
dash to the bottom, making everything hum
and sing. After giving and taking and haul
ing and easing off for twenty minutes, sud
denly the flsh rushed up, and with a final
effort I brought the black giant to the surface.
For a moment I saw a pair of eyes as large as
those of an ox, a rich chestnut back, and
then, with a tremendous heave, the fish threw
itself over, deluging me with water and half
capsizing the boat. It was the last struggle
and with another haul I had the king of the
Pacific Coast fishes at hands' length, where it
rolled and tossed, its huge tail bathing us with
spray, protesting against its capture."
The flerced
Salmon Trout That Was Gamy
to the Last Degree.
The Experience of Matthew Hamilton.
A novel aud exciting experience befell me
during my last vacation, down on the Mereed
River. For some time we were camped in the
immediate vicinity of the falls, and fish of all
kinds, seemingly, from homely cats to the
dainty trout, had been biting in a manner
dear to the heart of the most exacting. We
lived in an atmosphere of fishy odors and
glistening scales.
One warm morning, long before sunrise, I
was off to an untried pool which had previ
ously attracted my attention, with a can full
of big grasshoppers for bait.which I had easily
stripped in their stupefied state at that early
hour from the branches of the young willows,
where they clustered at night.
For once the finny tribe refused to bite, and
I began to think of removing. But seating
myself upon the spreading roots of a great oak
over the water, I was nearly asleep when with
out a second's warning the pole shot from my
drowsy gr\p and started down the river at a
lively gait\while I lost my balance and
tumbled into \- deep hole. That thoroughly
awakened me,\id scrambling ashore I re

clothing which clungSv^lassic folds of drip

doing a lively overhand in pursuit . ' "" "ifee
ing pole and whatever might, be the cause of
its departure.
Finally it ceased in its race, and I thought
the fish had escaped, but grasping the pole a
strong jerk at the end of the line convinced
me otherwise, and from the manner in which
his fishship yanked and sawed, first this way,
then in another, now behind me, now in front,
and again straight downward, I had an oppor
tunity of estimating his size, which I thought
must be in the neighborhood of a good-sized
whale. How he did tug and pull!
I mentally blessed the happy thought which
induced me to bring the big line that morn
ing, but here was a pretty quandary. Here
was tne big fellow nearly twenty feet below
the surface firmly tangled among the snags
and I rapidly tiring. An idea. Reaching shore
I took a brief breathing spell and grasping an
open knife in one hand soon reached the an
chorage. Looking down through the clear,
still water I caught a glimpse of my prey and
the sight made me all the more eager to have
him. Down I went, down, down, until the
surface looked dark and green. The big beauty
saw me and he darted so frantically that I ex
pected to see the line snap, but luck favored
me. Reaching the snags I wound the line
about my left hand several times, then cut the
cord above and made for the surface fairly
breathless, the big fish in tow.
He was still game, but I drew him up and
jabbed him with the knife, which speedily
took all the fight and dash out of him. Reach
ine shore I had an opportunity to look him
over and found him to be a fine salmon. The
scales told the weight to be 11 pounds.
A String of
Trout That Got Mixed With
a String of Catfish.
Told by Jack Sims.
Jack Sims of Chico tells a fish story on W. H.
Peacock, his fellow-citizen, that will bear re
peating. Mr. Peacock has the reputation of
being one of the luckiest and most skillful dis
ciples of Walton in Butte County, but this
story would seem to show the evil side of a
good reputation, the dangers that beset one in
an honest effort to live up to his reputation.
Recently Peacock. Sims and Colonel Mcln
tosh went to Mud Creek on a fair Sunday with
rod and reel in hand. It was their avowed
purpose to catch fish, ana Peacockâ with gen
erous anticipationâ promised all his friends in
Chico that he would bring them back one or
more fine mountain trout apiece. When they
reached the canyon the trio separated. Sims
and the colonel went one way and Peacock
sought out his own favorite nooks.
Evidently the gods of the waters had not
been properly propitiated. The trout did not
bite â or if they bit at all took tiny nibbles and
declined to swallow the hooks of any of the
three. Sims and the colonel turned their at
tention then to catfish â after exchanging
winks and nodsâ which, of course, bit freely
enough, and they soon had a big mess of these
worthless fish.
But Peacock was not easily discouraged.
He went on up the stream and tried and tried,
but in vain. As he was coming back to the
rendezvous very much digusted he met an
Indian boy who sold him a beautiful string of
trout for $4â a mighty big price for even so
great a reputation as Mr. Peacock's. But the
boy saw his chance and Peacock paid the
cash. Sims and the colonel had an idea where
the fine string of tront came from, but they
said nothing â only when Peacock's back was
turned the catfish chanced places in Peacock's
basket with the trout
Mr. Peacock talked wisely and gave his two
friends much sage advice about how to catch
trout as the three wended homeward. Of
course, when Peacock bade his friends adieu
and strode proudly up Main street, everybody
asked, "Well, what luck?" Peacock answered
with becoming modesty, albeit not underesti
mating the size and number of the string he
thought was in hi 3 basket. At last he met
Colonel Park Henshaw, Major Nichols and
General J. W. B. Montgomery, who insisted
upon inspecting the fine catch. Mr. Peacock
stopped, opened his basket and drew forth !
Can you not imagine the rest of it better than
I could tell it? He drew forth that string of
catfish.

strangers sat opposite me at the table, and they
were talking of the subject so dear to the heart
of Ike Wslton. â  The younger man was either a
wonderful fisher or an unmitigated liar. Bis
story run in this fashion:
- " 'Last summer 1 was up in Lake County for
an outing. I had taken with me a common
three-pronged gig, although why I took it I
am at a loss to tell, as I never threw a gig in
my life before. One morning, gig in hand, I
went down to the lake, and to ascertain the
depth of the water I ran my gig down. It had
hardly reached the bottom until I felt a ter
rific tugging, and I immediately drew it out to
find that I had an Immense carp on each
prong.
" 'I kept this lick up for two hours and a
! half, as* fast us I could put the gig in the
I water and pull it up. I had three^/ ââv

"About â  this time I naturally asked the
speaker what he did .with the fish., j
â¢' 'Do with them? I couldn't do anything
with them. 1 came back.to camp and reported
my catch. The next morals*, realizing the
necessity for immediate action, the Sheriff of
Lake County sent two drays and an express
wagon to gather up the dead fish and haul
them off to a hog ranch.'"

similar experiences in days gone by. They j
\ assert that a marine giant inhabits the waters

(.alucchi had put over his codlines well out
side, near the Marin County shore, and made
all fast about his little boat. The heat, of the
sun, or perhaps lack of rest the night previous,
had made him a little sleepy, and while wait

stretched himself out on the thwarts and dozed
into dreamland.

the fisherman could not turn the unknown
thing from its course, and in fear he finally
broke them loose singly and made for home

was not that of a fish, but more like that of a

thinks it must have wandered about among
his lines and taken the bait on several before
turning seaward^
Trout That Were
So Hungry They Snapped at
the Bare Hooks.
lold by Ueor<re Van Gorden
George Van Gorden, the well-known horse
man of San Luis Obispo County, tells a re
markable story of a fishing experience on San
Simeon Creek near his ranch, which is v few
miles from the town of Cumbria. This creek,
like many others on the Pacific Coast, is a
raging torrent in the rainy season, and in the
dry season it is as dry as a country Judge. It
rises in the Santa Lucia Mountains, about
fifteen miles from the ocean, pursues a wind
ing course down the San Simeon Valley and
I empties into a big, deep lagoon, which is di
i vldad from the ocean by a sandbar, which
I breaks open every Winter.
This break in the bar affords hundreds of
I salmon an opportunity to enter the stream
during the spawning season, and every year
the lagoon is filled with salmon-trout which
run upstream almost to the mountain tops
when the water in the creek is high.
"A few years ago," said Van Gorlen, "there
had been a wet spell followed by a long period
in which no rain fell at all. The creek was at
first bank full, but after a few weeks of pleas
i ant weather it subsided until only deep pools
J remained hero and there where the current
had struck the toot of the hills. There was
plenty of water running under the coarse
gravel-bed, but fish can't swim through gravel,
or at least no fish that I have ever seen. One
day when my younger brother, Gilbert, was
hunting cattle he ran across one of these pools
well up the creek, and it did not take him long
to discover that it was literally swarming with
fine salmon-trout that were likely to starve to
death, as they could not get down to the la
' goon, and they had devoured everything in
the pool that fish could eat.
'â¢The next day we started out for that pool
well provided with bait. We used common
angle worms, ordinary lines and hooks and
willow poles. None of your fancy fly-casting
rigs. The first worm had hardly got wet be
fore it was down a big trout's throat, nook and
all. The next fared the same, and the splash
ing of the hooked iish did not scare the others
a little bit. Gil and I varied the monotony of
pulling fish out of the water by holding the
impaled worms a little above the water and
seeing the fish jump for the bait.
"Well, it was great sport. Sometimes half a
dozen big fellows would leap dear out of the
water for the worms, and not a few were
actually caught on the fly. Hooking fish in
the air is amusement that sportsmen don't
have every day, but we got lots of them that
way. We stayed by that pool until we got all
we could carry and our bait gave out. Then,
just for fun, we fished with bare hooks, and da
you believe it the hungry beggars actually
would get caught on the naked hooks. It was
most too good a snap to give to the neighbors,
so Gil stocked the pool with a few chuuks of
stale meat and we kept the remainder from
starving until we cleaned out the hole, which
we did about the time it dried up. How many
fish did we take out of that pool ? I'll never
tell you. You would put me down for a man
who has no regard for his word, and that
might interfere with me selling you a horse
some day."
A Cutthroat
Trout That Swallowed a
Flask of Whisky.
As William RttwlUon Tells It.
"Talking about fish," said Billy Rawlison,
the well-known expert fisherman of Truck e'e,'
"I guess the cutthroat trout has the most un
! common appetite of any member of that fam
ily. You take a three or four pounder, and he
can give an ostrich or billy-goat cards and
spades and then swallow the whole jack-pot.
â¢'I have seen them with woodrats, water
snakes, cigar stumps and buckskin crackers
from whips stored away in their insides. â¢ But
what particularly brings this subject to mind
is a thing that happened on Dormer Lake re
j cently.
"We had made a rather poor catch in the
"~Tu>cinK and were just setting out again, after
i having"~>^2jlinner at the head of the lake,
I when old AlKv^Rnve us a nice flask to bring
j luck. We troneO^x^n to about Darronville's
j place and caught se>S^Â«il line fish. Then,
upon celebrating, we fou><l the contents of
Albert's flask rather warm, i>\ft stout line was
I tied to its neck and the bott\thrown over
! board to cool off. \^
"We then headed over toward \* ho rock,
j and had not been there more thau\half an
I hour when* we saw a whopping big tnVt just
j a-playing horse on top of the water. HeVould

! and over and then shoot about like ft strea\ of
i lightning. We could not guess the caustVf
| his hilarity until one of the crowd went iV
j pull up the 'bottle and found only its neck]>
We then concluded that Mr. Trout had nailed
the bottle and got clean drunk on its contents.
j "Alter trying unsuccessfully all the ways we
j knew of to catch that fish, we had an inspira-
t ion. We steamed back to Albert's, got an
i other flask and tied a heavy line with three
| treble hooks on to it. When we got back our

! flask, but the second one and a corkscrew,
j with which we opened the bottle and drank
I to our success from its undamaged contents.
"The bottle and corkscrew ate now on exhi
bition in Truckee."
The Perils of
Jewfishing at Catalina and
A Lucky Accident.
Told by W. R. AJ.clntosh.
Taking jewfish at Santa Catalina Island has
always been attended with more or less risk to
fishermen. These fish are ready takers of
hooks properly baited, and are "gamy" to
the last degree. A jewfish to attract any at
tention at Catalina now must weigh at least
100 pounds, and there have been plenty of
I them landed which nave weighed 200 pounas.
One of the most thrilling adventures ever ex
perienced in this exciting sport happened to
B. Macready of the Los Angeles Journal and F.
V. Pendeerton, a retired capitalist of this City.
| These gentlemen in a rowboat one afternoon
I hooked an enormous jewfish, which towed
them about three miles out to sea and around
to the lower point oi the island, which is bare
and rocky. While near the shore the great fish
! was brought to the surface la what was sup
| posed to be an exhausted condition. Just as
j they were about to lift the monster into the
rather frail craft the fish gave a tremendous
jump and overturned the boat. The men had
fastened the line to the craft so that, notwith
standing their inability to pay any further at
tention to Mr. Fish, he was still held by the
line.
But now they became seriously alarmed as
to their own fate. Their best efforts were em
ployed to regain a handhold on the boat, then
too far from shore for the best swimmer to
consider himself safe. And to add to their
consternation, they soon discovered that their
"catch" was towing the overturned boaÂ£>
farther out to sea, where the breakers wer^TtC
eorui':g very troublesome. Every ef/rt to
! stop the onward pulling of the fish pi/ved un
j availing. In this dilemma thoiVnts of a
watery grave began flitting throng their dis
tressed minds. They were perclyM upon ihe
bottom of the upturned boat, -and were in
trepidation lest by a sudden ynrik they should
lose their balance and fall into t c sea.
They were almost in the agi ny of despair
when with joy inexpressible they observed
that the sea monster had turned toward the
shore. This course was pursued until shallow
water wns reached when anot' er turn was
made in the direction of deep waVer. In a mo
ment the fishermen agreed to \bandon the
helpless craft and swim for theirVives, leav
ing fish and boat behind. >^
With nerve and fortitude they botliNached
the rocky point, greatly exhausted, but iS^Qh
gratified that they were alive. After a lout>
tramp they reached Avalon Bay and recounted
their adventure to a few intimate friends, who
on the following day took a sailboat ana went
in searcti of the overturned skirl', but so far as
known it was never recovered. An incident of
the trip across the islanu on the return is that
these gentlemen found the cropping of a lead
mine, which, being reported to ona Benson,
mrs afterward located and worked with great
success.
Remarkable
Fish That Are Found in the
Stockton Baths.
Told by John Craig.
There are some queer fish in Jackson's
baths, just south of Stockton. No one, not
even the most expert of those who handle the
rod, seems to be able to tell just what the fish
are. They look something like a pike, and
some of the knowing ones say they resemble a
"split-tail." The queer part of the whole
thing is how the fish ever got into the big
swimming-tank. Several years ago some cat
fish were placed ia the tank, but they died off
as fast as they were placed in the water. Some
carp were tried and they fared a little better,
but did not seem to thrive as they do else
where. The water is full of minerals and is of
a peculiar greenish color.
It was finally decided to keep ail fish out of
the big ;auk, and wire netting with fine mesh
ings was placed over the outlet of the tank
where the water runs off and into the adjacent
sloughs, and thence on into the Sau Joaquin
River. The stream outside is always filled
with minnows and small fish, but they never
get through the fine wire netting. Several
months ago, however, some small fish began
to make their appearance in the tank. They
were a trifle larger than the ordinary minnow,
and when they first made their appearance
they acted so strangely that Tom Towle, the
custodian of the batning suits, called the at
tention of Frank Hopkins, who was then man
aging the place for Mr. Pearson, to the strange
antics of the fish. Their eyeballs protruded,
and they swam about as though blinded and
dazed. In a few days they seemed more at
home in the water, and their eyeballs receded
until the heuda of the little fellows looked like
those of other fish.
They grew rapidly and now many are as
much as a foot long, and there are hundreds
of them in the large tank, though none appear
in tne smaller covered tanks. The attaches of
tho place cannot account fur the presence of
the fish, except that they came from some
subterranean passage with the water that is
constantly flowing from the gas wells. The
water at the batns conies from three large gas
wells that are bored to a great depth and
bring up an immense volume of water all the
time. The men at the baths are firm in their
belief that they come up from the wells, as
they say there ia absolutely no other way for
them to get into the tank. The fine netting is
so arranged that no fish can get into the baths
from outside streams to deposit tneir spnwn.
The other night Donald MeÃae of The Call
business office, while swimming in the tank,
caught one of the larger fish and threw it up
on the bridge that crosses the tank. He was
vory anxious to see what sort of fish it was,
but before he could clamber out it had flopped
back into the water.
A Fish That
Grew in a Human Skull and
Became Circular.
Told by ilary W. Edwards.
\ "The strangest fish story I ever heard was au
eVierlence I had myself," said Judge Scudder
ulVtnluina, as he settled himself back in his
big tS^richair, while a reflective look passed
over hiNsopen countenance.
"It was\i the summer of '82, I think, that
an Easter!i\^-nd and myself started out on
the warpath ?\^r flsh. Salmon Creek afforded
line fighi.ig tor is\rnon, trout and salmon-trout
as well, and many were the stories of mam
moth fishes caught t\sre which were wafted to
our ears when our frk-\ls learned of our des
tination; to fill of whiOv my friend from the
East listened incredulous/^
'â¢This stream, as you knoOy flows through a
narrow defile, with precipit\is sides, and
winding around considerably Vter leaving
Freestone finally empties into the pacific, and
right near there we had our headqiV rtersâ at
the Ocean View Houseâtramping upVhe nar
row canyon each morning with bait iV our
selves as well as the fishes. \
"We had good sport â fine luck, in fact\?or
two days, and on the third day I chose a v\ v
wild spot and seated myself on a large roi\
overhanging the creek. I fished with a linei
and rod, using the same old-fashioned sort of
worm I did as a boy. There was no need to
use the more scientific fly when fish were so
easily caught.
"The Easterner was down stream a little way,
and everything was intensely solemn and
quiet. When I felt a fierce pull on the line I
roused up at once and pulling up, what should
I see come bobbing to the surface but a human
skull, which, to all appearances, had swal
lowed the bait through its eyes. Naturally
my otherwise steady nerves were considerably
shaken, and with a sort of howl I started
back suddenly, which motion swung the grew
some thing rather sharply against a rock,
whereat it cracked apart and the several
piecesâ to my reliefâ slid off into the stream,
leaving dangling on my line a most peculiar
looking fish, almost white and forming au
almost perfect ring.
"I quickly jerked the hook out of its gi'y^
and let it drop into the clear water, whr^i it
went through the strangest rnotirytf, still
keeping its circular shape. It was^-tinable to
swim, but twisted around iryfie water, or
moved with a wheel-like iry<ion. My friend,
who had been attracted>Â»7 my howl, arrived
just in time to seej><Te of the eccentric gyra
tioas, and I r^^y believe, if he hadn't actu
ally seen ]>^Te would always have said it was
a Cni^fiiift yarn.
afterward came to the conclusion that
-''the fish, when small, had strayed Into the
skull and probably through foine motion of its
own had turned the ruin over and so closed
its mode of egress, though it could easily sur
vive and grow on the food which came floating
by, and there It continued to grow, only in a
ring, till the worm, falling through one of the
eye-sockets, provided a mode of relief from its
cramped quarters.
'â¢We quit fishing for that day, and it was
some time before I could eat fish without a
thought of this strangely imprisoned curio."
The Man Who
Hooked a Fish That Ran
Up the Tree.
Told by W. I*. Robertson.
â *"Did I ever tell you of the fishing experience
T>r>^T. â¢p^i-ii^orrrgpir a couple of years ago?"
asked W. L. Roberts?>Â»4prnierly of Santa Rosa.
"There were several ofJN^amping there and i
all were expert flyeasters. of the party
returned to camp with his fishS^- tackle all
out of kilter and said that ami i\Â«o up the
stream he had dropped his line into auVp pool
and hooked the largest trout he ever j fanned
on to. He tried to play his prize, but the r/V*al
tore the tackle all to pieces. The ; next (\v
another cast for the monarch of the pool ai\
met with no better success, he too returning 1
minus some of his outfit. For several days
the sly old * fellow would not rise to anything
we could throw to him. I made up my mind
to have that fish or stay there all year.
I rigged ,my tackle and , cautiously ap
proached the hole. The pool is about twenty
feet across and it narrowed down to three feet
where the creek passed under ' a : fallen tree to
a riffle beyond. , The water was about eight
feet deep near the bank w here I stood, and
trees and underbrush surrounded the water
hole. With great care so as not to make any
noise I ad jus ted my rod and cautiously ex
tended it, so as to drop my fly close to the
ledge of rocks where the big fish raaae his
home. I had hardly done so when there was
a "swish" and the water broke, revealing a
beautiful trout, but not the one I was atter.
In a second my reel was spinning, for the fel
low had been well hooked. Here and there he
darted and I was kept pretty busy for a min
ute playing him away from the dangerous
root that extended into the pool. In my ex
citement my foot slipped a little and before I
could recover fully thirty feet of line had
been ruu off the reel and the gamy little fel
low was down the stream, having darted
under the body of the fallen tree. He had
gained the riffle below. Then came a splash
and a jerk on the line that I could not ac
count for, as I cculd not see beyond the tree
for the brush, followed by a steady hard pull.
I kept my line taut, but it was of no use.
Foot by foot the line was taken from meâ fifty,
sixty, seventy-five feetâ still I could not stop
it. When the end was reached I was amazed,
for the strain was terrific, but I held on until
the line snapped, or rather the knot slipped
trom the reel. Away went the line down
stream. I dropped the rod and ran around the
pool hoping to catch up with the fish some
where down the creek. Fifty feet below the
log I was fairly paralyzed to sco my line cut
ting across the path and up the hillside I
wondered if that fish had legs and was escap
ing over the hills, for I heard the underbrush
crackling some distance ahead. Seizing the
line I followed, pulling as I scrambled through
the brush. Suddenly the strain ceased and I
worked my way along to the foot of a small
sycamore tree. The line ran up the trunk, and
glancing upward I saw what I had on my hook.
There on a limb sat a terrified coon with the
hook firmly fastened in the tough hide on the
corner of his mouth.
Tame Fish
That Would Come When the
Boys Whistled.
V Told by H. B. Pendergast.
truth of this stoy can be vouched for by
suc\reliable citizens of Yolo County as Judge
E. T.\ampton, Professor Barr, George W. Rup
ley, DrUieorge H. Jackson, and the old veteran
fisheriA n, Hon. Jason Watkins.
A few yammers ago the canal in the eastern
part of tl\e county was full of salmon that had
come in tX the tule waters early in the spring,
and were l\ft in the canal after the water had
subsided in the Sacramento River. Some men
and boys cctaceived the idea of putting wire
screens acnys the canal, a mile or so apart,
then by formXig Â» line of persons and wading
from one screwy to the other, driving the fish
before them, t\:y would catch wagon-loads of
big, fine salmoy Some boys, while engaged
in this sport, ctAght one day a huge salmon,
at least four feetXong, that had been injured
by running agaii\i a snag, or in some other
manner, so they turned him loose.
ThU happened seWeral times until the fish
became quite gentii and would come to the
water's edge whenever the boys whistled to
him, and would be fed by them with bread,
worms, etc. One of Ihe boys became possessed
with the idea that t/ey could have some sport
with old "Sam," f/id, carrying the idea into
execution, he oVfe day cuught the fish, and
fas'eniug a strr/Tg cord around the fore part
of Mr. sSalmon/ie mounted astride of him, and
away he weyt down the canal at more than
railroad .yOed. As soon as one of the screens
was rePy/fed the fish stopped aud another boy
bestrr/e, and away they went for the other
scrr/a. The fish seemed to enjoy tho sport,
fl/1 would flop his tail and jump around in
/ac water, while the boys were snouting with
lauffhter. This sport continued through the
spring, until the poor old fish died, on account
of the water getting so low and so warm in the
canal, and the boys buried him with all the
honors he deserved.
The Wonderful
Luck of Two Fishermen in
Mendocino County.
Upon the authority of Joseph Allen.
A. V. Phillips, an employe of the Southern
Pacific Company, now living in Tulare, went'
fishing some time ago on the Bell River./n
Mendocino County. Far up in the hills, wVere
the trout prevail, the stream courses alofig a
comparatively level strip of country for\the
distance of something like half a mile. \Vth
a friend he drove to this spot, having pre\i
ously arranged bait and lines and hooks. m\
Phillips had thoughtfully collected an oyster
can full of grasshoppers to be used as bait in
case the trout declined to accept the fly. He
cast in his fiyhook, but the wily gamester 3 did
not appear to be hungry. To wake up the fish
he drove the horse into the bit of the stream,
the water being about knee-deep, and cast in
his line with a live hopper on the hook. No
sooner had the hook struck the water than a
trout seized it and was quickly landed in the
buggy.
The sport was continued driving up the
stream, landing the trout in the buggy, until
the stock of hoppers was exhausted. When
they ceased fishing they found they had 150
trout in the buggy, varying in length from 6
to 10 inches.
This, Mr. Phillips says, was the best sport he
ever enjoyed fishing, and as the fishing season
is at hand again he is going to take a layoff
and hunt that same trout spot again.
It Had a
Miscellaneous Conglomeration
In Its Stomach.
Caught by John Hamlln.
The pig has always been held up to scorn
and contumely as the greediest and least to be
emulated of all the living creatures of the
world, but it can't hold a candle to a fish of the
scuipin family that is common in the waters
of the' bay, and, in fact, all along the coast.
This creature is called by the fishermen
capisori, and by those who are unfamiliar with
piscatorial nomenclature plain "hog" fish.
There seems to be no limit to its capacity,
and one caught off the Bay Farm Island
bridge at Alameda by John Hamlin, the bridge
tender, a few days ago, puts it in the front
rank of the gluttons. The fish took a large and
succulent worm impaled for the undoing 01 a
porgie.
His bite was voracious and determined, and
when hauled up his stomach was found to
contain three crabs, each about the size of a
silver dollai, a fish fully three inches long,
several barnacles and a piece of liver the size
of a walnut The fish itself was not over ten
inches long. The stomach was so distended at
to make a lump the size of an egg on the
under side of the fish. |
Â«,
How a Ukiah
Trio Gained Waltonesque
Reputations.
Divulged by Frank L. Perkius.
There is an incident in connection with a
fishing expedition in which I engaged in Men
docino County that will ever remain greon in
my memory. By it the reputations of Attorney
J. A. Cooper, a local sportsman named Fitz- "1
gerald and myself were firmly established. "
Cooper, Fitzgerald and myself set forth in a
buggy for Walker Creek, which flows through
Walker Valley about twelve miles north of
Ukiah. Arrived at the fishing ground, the two
proceeded to whip the stream towards its
source for a miie or two and then returned.
Fitzgerald returned first. When I inquired
his luck, he opened his basket and sadly gazed
upon fifty-three small fish. When the attor
ney returned he also developed a marked re
luctance to showing the contents of his basket,
but finally admitted that his luck was limited
to thirty-seven.
"Our reputations are ruined," groaned the
disciple of Blackstone.
â¢ 'We will have to sneak into town by an un
frequented road," said Fitzgerald.
Suddenly a bright idea flashed into the se
date attorney's mind, and he astonished us by '
jumping into the air and cracking his heels
together. "I have it," he fairly shouted ; "get
in and help me and we are all right."
He speedily unfolded his plan and we went
to work. *PB^fc;ring plenty of moss and ferns,
we stuffe/l botLSj-.askets and a large bucket
with thc/e materi\^ nearly to the top. Then
the fisly were carefu^r laid on top, the largest
neai th^e surface, anove were ready.
Whyi we drove int^town that night and
stored in front of theNGrand Hotel all our
fj/Tnds crowded round tcjsee the result of tho.
rratch. It was about 8 ojjlock in the evening
and the light was dim. .
"Gaze on these beautiffl," exclaimed Fitz
gerald, dragging a baskejj into view. "There
are just 563 beauties yi there. Look at
Cooper's basket here. He has 672 more. And
even Perkins stayed witli the team and man
aged to catch a whole bucketful â over 300."WHAT THE
DOCTOR SAYS ABOUT THOSE
DOTTED VEILS
Hurt tlie Eyes and Bring Premature Wrinkles
Dropping In the other day for a chat
vkh my friend, the doctor, I found her
stting at her desk gazing, *Uh a frown
leiween her brows, at the door through
vhith an outgoing patient had just passed.
What is going to become of our
ffomen?" she asked by war of greeting.
"Easily answered," I replied, as I took
a stethoscope from a chair and seated
myself. "They are going to vote. Alter
thatâ the deluge."
The doctor's frown deepened. My levity
was evidently ill timed. "If they're not
careiul," she said, "they will have neither
eyes to read the bafot nor brains to under
stand its meaning."
I understood then that the doctor
wanted to ta.k, so I waited, and presently
she continued:
"That woman who just went out is the
eighth who has come to me this week
with practic.iily the same set of symp
toms. She complained of feeling sleepy
all the time, of a slight â very slight â dizzi
ness. As one of the eight expressed it,
'She wae-i't exactly dizzy, but she seemed as
if she vould be if she made a quick move.'
They bU have something of this sensation
andal complain of a peculiar headach
'way back inside the head,' and all have
pair, with a tendency to tearfulness in
the eyes. Every last one of them is de
ve'jping a tiny, vertical wrinkle just
at jvc the nose and a bunch of little fine
c;ies at the corners of the eyes."
"It all sounds alarming," I commented,
seing something in that line was expected
of me. "How do you account for all these
symptoms?"
"By this," and she reached across to
where her bonnet lay upon a table and
plucked therefrom a bit of net studded
with occasional round, black dots.
"We're all wearing these things and
they're putting our eyes out." "Why do
you do it?" I replied, full ol conscious
rectitude, for my veil had no dots. "Have
to wear this. The girls do my shopping.
I take what they bring me, for I've no
time to do anything else. But you have j
no such excuse." "Oh, yes" â as I began to i
demur â ''but that coarse mesh you have
before your eyes is nearly as bad as the
dots."
The doctor was fairly launched now.
"Has it ever occurred to you," sbe
asked, "to wonder why you meet so many
nice womeu than men who are wearing
glasses?"
I murmured something about the well- j
known studiouÃ tendencies of the new
woman, and the doctor lapsed into inele
gance. "Studious grandmothers!" she !
biiapped. "It isu't study; 'tis folly that j
perches spectacles upon the noses of our |
women. If men covered their faces with
black, or white, or red, green or blue net,
speckled all over with dots, dancing in j
front of the eyes,, they would soon be com- ;
ing to the doctors with the same chain ol i
symptoms these women describe. The |
dot need not be directly in front of the
eye to do the mischief. In fa;t, it does
almost less harm there than on the side
of the nose, for instance. Euch an object,
visible, yet not directly within the range
of vision, is always a distracting object to
ihe tight. Not only the eye on the side
where the dot is is strained in the
effort to see the thing, but the one on the
opposite side partakes of the effort. This
is a peculiarity growing out of the con-
truction of the eyes. Tne probability is
that man was once a one-eyed creature,
and the anatomical sympathy between
the two eyes is still so perfect that they
act together always. Thus, a blind eye.
though it sees nothing, works just as hard
in its vain effort to see as does its perfect
mate. It 'looks' just as constantly, even
when shut,, as the good eye, and needs
rest at night ju3t as much. The constant
strain upon eyes distracted and teased by
such an object as an occasional dot on a
light veil is an active brain irritant, suffi
cient to produce marked mental effects. I
might tell you ti:Â« exact effect if I thought
you would remember it, but it has grown
bo fashionable of late for physicians to
hurl big technical phrases at their pa
tient- that our pet terms are beginning to
run off the chronic cases like water off a
cluck's back. It is the truth, though, that
we women are nurting our brains and our
ryes, and lining our faces with premature
wrinkles by wearing dotted vmls."
"Wrinkles" is always a dread word in
feminine ears, and it remained in my
mind as I went forth, balf-doubting, but
determined to make a note of the veils
worn by my sister women. It was hardly
possible that these trifles light as air could
be productive of such serious mischief.
The first woman I met was veiled with a
wonderful creation in delicate white illu
sion, edged with lace and dotted with a
black pattern of the conventionalized
fleur-de-lis, cash design more than half
an mdi long. It was striking in effect,
but I felt sure I should not have noticed it
but for the doctor's little lecturs.
Curiously enough there was the redoubt
able vertical wrinkle between her brows,
and at the corners of her eyes were faint
crowsfeet. Palpably, the lady was squint
ing, and, equally, it was apparent that the
cause of her visual obliquity was a par
ticuiarly fetching Beur-de-lis exactly upon
Ihe ridge of her nose, where both
pyes could catch tantalizing half-
Klimpses of its beauty. A few mo
ments later I met a friend, full
jf enthusiasm over a new. movement for
the elevation of the race. She was earnest,
lignilied, eloquent, and the subject upon
which she at once began to talk was fu'l
of interest for me. But alas for my pow
ers of attention. Just before one eye, as
she gazed at me, appeared a large and
wholly irrelevant ball of chenille, like a
sort of supernumerary pupil, trom behind
which the actual one peeped, giving my
dignified friend such a wayward appear
ance that I fell to wondering the while she
discoursed upon the highest human
rights whether if I tipped a wink
at that dubious - looking, black - spot
ted eye its owner would not instantly
reply: "Thanks; I don't mind if I do."
Entering a streetcar I noted a staid, el
derly matron, upon the tip of whose nose
appeared a particularly wicked little
sprawl of threads, outlining a shamrock
in the meshes of her veil. One did not
need to be a mem: er of the A. P. A. to
feel that the design was hideously unbe
coming and out of place. Beside her sat a
pretty golden-haired girl, whose face was
disfigured by an arrangement in purple,
with white spots, and in the corner were
two middle-aged women wearing sailor
hats and veils, one white with huge black
spots, the other black with big blobs of
white spattered here and there over its
surface. The effect was such as to make
both ladies appear decidedly rakish.
In the course of the day I saw blue veils,
red ones, gray, green, pink and yellow,
with dots of all shapes and sizes, from the
big, fluffy balls, nearly the size of my
thumb's end, to the minute specks that
gave the wearer an appearance of being
dreadfully freckled. There were veils
with borders and veils without; veils com
ing to the chin and veils making a wad
beneath it, but in nearly every instance
the wearer sported, as well as her veil, a
troubled frown between her brows, and I
wondered if the doctor was ri^Lt, after all,
in attributing feminine wrinkles to the
omnipresent veil.
But the veil, particularly in this cli
mate and when our summer winds do
blow, is an absolute essential to the street
toilet of a woman who does not wish to
look like the witch of Endor and scare the
school children when nhe takes her walks
abroad. Hair will blow and straggle in
the merry breeze, and comfort and tidi
ness alike demand the veil. Moreover,
there are very few women to whom a
veil is not becoming. Some of them
even look well despite the dots.
Every one of them looks well wearing
one of the numerous sorts of plain
veils that are made for and worn by the
sensible few. Plain; soft, dainty tulle,
â¢thin, delicate illusion make light, com
fortable veils that shade the eyes, keep
the hair in order, do not interfere with
vision and impart a pleasing softness to !
every complexion. Tulle, in fact, plain, i
inexpensive tulle, makes the most becom- 'â 
ing of all veils. It may be as fine as one
chooses, edged with lace and rendered a |
thing of costliness and fashion, but, un- j
marred by the obnoxious, sight-destroying,
mirth-provoking dots that make it ugly.
But wrinkles, weak, red-rimmed eyes,
dizzy heads, impaired brains! These are
a terrible price to pay for the fashionable
folly of a summer season. What if the
doctor's prediction should prove true, and
the ne *â¢ woman, when the ballot is placed
in her hand, should find herself without
ey?s to read it or brains to comprehend its
meaning? Penelope Powelson.
HOW
A TULARE
WOMAN OVERCAME
THE WOLF
Mrs. C. C. Christy of Tulare has blue
eyes and strongly marked features which
I indicate courage and force. Four years
< ago her husband aied, leaving her with
| six small children and little money. All
at once, therefore, the problem of how to
support a large family was thrust upon
the widow. The young Christys had lusty
appetites and a strongly marked propen
sity to wear out shoes and clothes, and in
them also inhered the certainty of outgoes
for schoolbooks, for doctors' bills and the
J thousand and one miscellaneous expenses
which aggregate a considerable annual
total.
"They who face battle bravely," says an
old proverb, "have the spirit of conquerors
within them." Mrs. Christy did not
bother with proverbial sayings of course,
but immediately went to work in a practi
cal way. The skill which had enabled
j her to turn things to the best advantage
in her family when Mr. Christy lived
speedily was applied on broader lines.
There was some life insurance money
i coming in, but not a very large amount,
: from the policy, upon which her husband
had paid premiums. Her first invest
ment, made after a lot of careful consider-
I ation, was in a home in a pleasant quarter
lof the town. Her new home was not
palatial nor very pretentious, but it was
comfortable and Mrs. Christy saw that it
could be so improved that it would be also
very attractive to !he eye.
There was a cellar to be dug. What
money remained was not to be expe nded
for paying for help. No, prudence
prompted that this should be reserved as
far as possible, for a "rainy day" might
come when ready money would be indis
-1 pen sable. But there was the pressing
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
AM I DRESSED CONSPICUOUSLY?
/
need of a cellar. There was no way to |
dodge that. The oldest child, Otto, aged ;
9 when his father died, could help some,
but was not strong enough to accomplish
much. Very well, then, the mother would
dig the cellar herself. Seizing the pick j
and shovel and barrow she went at the '
work with a will, and the dirt Hew in such ;
way that the neighbors from pity turned
to admiration, and the talk of that part of
the town began to be about "plucky Mrs.
Christy."
Attached to Mrs. Christy's home is suffi
cient land- to make up a good-sized garden.
She did not permit this land to lie idle, j
but dug it up, raked and hoed it over with
her own hands, planted seeds and raised
her own vegetables, instead of buying
them from the Chinese peddlers, as so
many others do. The prophetic poet who
told about "tickling the soil with a hoe,"'
that the land might "laugh into harvest,"
could not have imagined any one better
calculated to wield the hoe faithfully than
the brave lady who is the subject of
this article. What she has put her hands
to has been done with all her might. The
thoroughness which has characterized her
in one enterprise lias made her successful
in all. Her earden patch is not only
pleasing to the eye because of its thrifty
looks but also it is very productive.
Thrift and economy suggested that soap

could all be made at home, and Mrs.
Christy knew how to manufacture that
necessary article. It was necessary to haul \
ashes for leaching from the water works, I
and Mrs. Christy did this. When the soap ;,
was made there was no stint in its use. i
Floors, windows and lintels were made to j
shine with the additional aid of "elbow j
grease" stoutly and skillfully applied.
During these enterprises Mrs. Christy j
put in much of her well-directed time
working for others. She is laundress,
housecleaner, cook or nurse, and good at
all. These various occupations bring her'
an income which is fully utilized by her
thrift. She has not been satisfied to dwell
amid unsightly surroundings. Some time
ago slie wanted her house painted. That
was something new for her to attempt,
and she turned over the problem in her
mind as to how she could get the work
done at least cost. She finally decided
that she would buy the paint and hire
some one who was out of work to put the
paint on the sides of the house.
It will probably please and amuse the
disciples of the "new woman," relf-reliant
and competent, to learn that Mrs. Christy,
driven by the force of circumstances, dem
onstrated that a woman of the present
day can do this sort of work. She hired a
man who applied for employment to do
the painting. The price she offered him
was very low, but it was all that she could
then afford to pay, for even with economy
the demands upon her purse were consid
erable considering her resources. The
man started in on the hou se-painting job.
At the end of the second day he took his
pay, Mrs. Christy insisting upon paying
him daily, and went away not to return.
He assigned no reason.
This left the house in a condition where
Mrs. Christy was compelled to go ahead.
She saw no reason why a woman should
fall from a ladder. She had no idea that
a woman's muscles were incompetent or
that her eye for colors was poor. More
over, she was aware that if she personally
applied the paint it would be well rubbed
into the wood. Perhaps it was just as
well, she reflected, that she should do the 1
work. Anyhow there was no otner way
out of the dilemma. Mrs. Christy put on
old clothes and w^pt for that house in
dead earnest. She applied more than one
color, for pleasing effects, and then stood
off and admired the contrast. When she
had finished the job and the ladder was
put away she had the proud distinction of
being the only woman in Tulare who had
furnished ocular demonstration that she

ARE THE
MEN OF SAN FRANCISCO
RUDE TO WOMEN?
Is tfye Modish Woman Dressed Conspicuously?
James A. Maloney, commercial traveler, ap
peared In Judge Conlan's court yesterday to
answer the charge of battery preferred against
him by Alice Hendricks, who Is employed in a
candy-store on Kearny street.
She Is a pretty girl, 16 years of age, anS Monday
evening, while walking along Market street on
her way to her home on Turk, Mai bney accosted
her and asked her to have dinner with Mm. She
walked on, when he fo.'owed ho r, grabbed her by
the arm and again asked her vo dine with him.
Phe notified Policeman Coleman ixnd Maloney was
arrested.â From The Call of. Friday, June 17.
If strange men ever followed me or
spoke to me on the street, instead of bunt
ing a policeman I would hunt a looking
glass and study myself to find the reason.
Long ago, in my schooldays, when the
snow was on the ground, the girls used to
cluster near the door and as soon as they
had thrown a bail with effect or washed
some luckless urchin's face they woulu
run into the house, where the boys were
not allowed to bring snow. If the girl was
caught out and bad her face washed in re
turn she was very likely to take it amiss
and tell nn the boy.
There is a parallel between this little re
miniscence and the stories of some of the
women and girls of this City who cannot
walk down a crowded street in a bright
light without being followed and accosted.
They, too, throw snow and run, and if
they are followed they tell the teacher.
Some of the glamor thrown over the
girl world wears off during years of labor
in that world. Girls are plain flesh and
blood, with faults and vanities a-plenty.
They are not angeis here, nor shall be.
This sacred mantle of womanhood is too
often laid on and off like a suit of armor.
Let a woman be ever so unwomanly,
flirt ever so desperately, use her eyes ever
so promiscuously, invite remark ever so
boldly, the instant some great, horrid man
takes up the gauntlet she has thrown
down she drapes herself in her mantle of
helpless innocence, climbs up on her ped
estal and cries, "I ara a woman."
Of course she is a woman. None other
would crawfish so.
New woman? No, sir. That much criti
cized mortal isn't in this game at all. She
doesn't devote her thoughts and her eyes
wholly to the other sex.
It is the- dainty bits of femininity who
think it is horrible to want to vote, and
who have no patience with the bold crea
tures who can speak from a platform. It
is the tendrils of ivy that ask no other lot
than to cling to some tall oak who are con
stantly finding themselves insulted.
I have made a study of the women who
tell me that men are insulting and not
chivalrous. 1 shouldn't wonder some
times.
There are men and men; there are
women and women and women; also,
there are insults and insults.
Perhaps I do not see them as plainly as
I ought; certainly I never go about with a
lantern searching for them.
I know once an old white-headed man
spoke to me as 1 waited for a car. He said
my face took him back to the face of a dear
friend, and wouid I wear the rose he of
fered me? I took the flower with a few as
kind words as I ever speak and went my
way. What was my astonishment to find
out later lhat I had been insulted. Maybe
so, but I can bear up under it, though I
much prefer to believe that my face did
remind grandpa of one beneath the sod.
1 I always bow to him as we pass, and he j
raises his hat with a grace some much |
younger men would do well to cultivate.
There is a young matron who, like my- j
self, is often compelled to be on the street
late, sometimes to cross the bay at mid
night. I asked her one day if she had
found the men of San Francisco rude.
"No," she said, "I have always gone on
my way unmolested, but only yesterday
Mrs. X. and her sister complained to me
that they are shadowed every time they
go out together in the evening. Don't you
think they imagine some of it?"
Knowing Mrs. X. and her sister I opined
that it might be true and yet be no evi
dence of rudeness in the men.
"Once something happened that dis
turbed me," went on the young matron.
"It was in Oakland one night; a very tall
negro smiled familiarly and raised his
hat."
I laughed as 1 pictured Major Waters
going from a successful cake-walk, full of
the milk-punch of human kindness, scat
tering smiles and bows like blessings right
and left. When I explained, the young j
matron laughed too. "I am so glad you i
told me. I was afraid I had somehow
made myself conspicuous."
Conspicuous.
That is the key to half of it.
if we make it the study of life to look
striking how can we hope to escape com
ment? Given a cause, an effect must !
follow.
I know by sight a girl. I call her the
black and yellow girl. I pick her out in a
crowd, meet her on this side of the bay
and the other, in the center and in the
suburbs, and I never mistake her. She
may be a good, modest girl. If she is she
should sue her clothes lor libel.
There is one "woman's right" that is
not yet taken advantage of by the masses,
though it i 3 conceded even by the Demo
cratsâthe right to dress quietly, modestly,
naturally.
A woman is going down the street in a
dark diess with vivid plaid sleeves, which
mane by far a larger hole in the atmos
phere than the person herself, and which
would drive into frenzy any naturally
peaceful bovine. Prom the expanse of her
shoulders her waist slopes- in, to the en
tire exclusion of her liverâ a liver is not
good form nowadays; she either strides or
tiptoes along, carrying on her dome of
reason (?) a fluff of impossible crinkled
hair, and perched on one side of it a mass
of dead birds and feathers that might be
taken for a taxidermist's sign.
Some male cynic dares to gaze at her in
sneering wonder as to which extreme of
society she belongs. He is a rude sftarer
and should be given a barred window to
stare through.
Circus posters are put up to be stared at.
Are respectable women never wantonly
insulted?
They are. There are men whose very
glance is pollution. The only way to
purify them is by fire, and that is prohib
ited, at least in this world. They are of a
feather with the females whose existence
we ignore; and with eyes that see not we
may pass these male animals by. They
have no smirk for the woman who never
knows they are near. An angry look is as
much satisfaction to them as an answer
ing smile, but complete oblivion is a frost
that kills them.'
There is always the possibility of a little
encounter with the youth tottering uruder
a too heavy load of the rosy. He is too
imbecile to be taken tragically. It one
could only take him to a nice clean pig
pen !
There is a golden mean between a smile
and a slap in the face or a police court. A
few quiet words or a grave glance of pity
does mere than all the publicity and scan- I
dal of an arrest.
Something in the face and the air of a
girl or the lack of that something deter
mines the attitude of men and other ani
mals toward her. What it is I will not
undertake to explain; it is an ineffable
something that resides in the personality,
not put on and off to suit the occasion.
Thousands of bright, busy working-girls
daily and nightly pass up and down our
streets in perfect freedom and immunity
from danger, while a few are "insulted"
time after time.
Draw your inference.
The men of San Francisco are civil.
For such a motley company gathered
from the corners of the earth thery are
more than civil. In the frequented streets
a woman is just as safe as in the boeom of
her family ; in the darkness of the Super
visors' intelligence she is at least as safe
as her young Drother; more so.
I know whereof I write. At 18 a girl
just out of school came alone to the big
city and, with a lively curiosity and a
rustic independence, showed herself the
sights, stadying all sorts of queer places
and people, knowing no chaperon but
self-respect, no limit but her own judg
ment.
Expecting neither worship nor persecu
tion from men â in fact not considering
them at allâ she received what she ex
pected. Growing older, year after year
she has traveled the streets of San Fran
cisco at seemly and unseemly hours with
a face that never yet stopped a clock, and
the first rudeness has yet to be offered.
When you want a helping-nand, a bit of
information or a direction, to whom do
you turn? The nearest man.
And you get what you ask for.
I have been answered tersely, even
gruffly. Well! Before I accost a woman
I must take her measure â classify her.
The stately, well-dressed lady of quality
may distrust me. The equally well
dressed hanging-on-to-the-edge-of-society
person is likely to snub me. The keen
eyed woman with a purpose in life will
answer me with the same business man
ner she has for men. The kindly middle
class woman has a sweet, motherly way
that is oh. so comfortable. I'll ask her first.
Women are being slowly educated up to
the fact that they are simply human beings
walking among other human beings called
men, meeting the same dangers, pro
tected by the same laws, subject to the
same conditions. That there are those
who rail at the advanced woman and
cling to the days when "She trembled and
burst into teari as his eyes fell upon her"
proves that we still need teaching.
It all reminds me of a paragraph in the
funny column.
Two south-of-Markets were gazing at a
bloomer girl, one of the dashing kind.
The first one cried, "Get onto de
bloomers, Jimmy; ain't dey loud enough,
to make a feller deef ?"
"Aw, go on!" answered the other,
"'Taint de bloomers, it's de gal."

GAYETY OVER THE

Water Parties a Popular
and Fashionable Amuse
ment.
Dancing Aboard ?h ; p in Natty
Outing Suits Voted Great
Sport.
Marine Yacht Club Enjoys a Cruise
to Vallejoâ Aboard the White
Wings.
As the season advances the water party
grows in favor. All the numerous yacht clubs
have planned excursions, for which invita
tions are being eagerly sought. Dancing in
natty yachting costume aboard ship is voted
great fun, and society during the past few
weeks has developed a remarkable number of
good sailors.
A joily party, consisting of several members
of the Marine Yacht Club and their lady
friends, had a pleasant cruise to Vallejo last
Sunday on the club flagship, the Volunteer.
Shortly after leaving the City a kodak fiend
was discovered amonjr the yachtsmen, and the
surreptitious manner he employed to obtain
snapshots of picturesque but unconscious
groups furnished a source of constant amuse
ment for the rest of the trio. During the sail
One of the members improvised some verses,
which were sung to the tunes of some of the
latest popular melodies. The songs contained
many good-natured hits on those present, and
were received with much laughter and ap
plause. The Volunteer Quartet, consisting of
Messrs. Moyce, Morse, Petty and Brooks, the
four benedicts of the club, rendered several
selections very creditably, and the musical
efforts of Morris and Pless were greatly appre
ciated. Every one had a good time, and a mer
rier lot of excursionists never returned to this
City than the party from the yacht Volunteer
late Sunday evening.
Among those present were: Mr. and Mrs. G.
W. Morse, Mr. and Mrs. D. D. Lowney, Mr. and
Mrs. Al Brooks, Mr, and Mrs. H. C. Moyce,
Miss Price, Miss Gudmunsen,Miss Carver, Miss
T. McCrosÃor., Miss Sheean, Miss Gardiner,
Miss J. Swendsen, Miss Swendsen, Miss Moyce,

Carthy, Harry Pless, George Engel, Arthur
Moyce, C. G. Larson, E. Gudmunsen, G. A.
Koch, Walter Johnson, Frank Martin, James
Buscelle and Mr. Morris.
On Wednesday last Miss Helen Chittenden
of Alameda entertained a number of her
friends on the yacht White Wings, Captain
Charles Chittenden in command.
The party left the pier at 9 o'clock with a
fine breeze; visited the wrecked ship Blair*
more and other points of interest on the bay.
At noon the anchor was dropped in a pretty
little cove near El Campo, and all hands as
sembled at the picnic grounds, where a boun
tiful lunch was spread. A cruise out to the
Heads and return rounded out the day, which
was most heartily enjoyed by all.

Can Be Taken From

Gotham Hotel-Keepers Complain

Ella Sterling Cummins.
Gossip From the Eastern Metropolis
About Men and Women of the
Golden Coast.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 23.-New
York has a mining exchange with a Caii
fornian at tbe head of it I refer to the
Mining and Industrial Exchange at 45
New street and to Stephen H. Emmens,
its preside it. This newly organized in
stitution. 'iaving a membership already of
nearly :<"", has been organized on the plan
of mofi all stock exchanges, but its presi
dent, having large mining interests in
Calif rnia, proposes to push California
proi erties to the front.
â  have," said he, "been associated with
tin great mother lode mining belt of CaJi
f< nia ior several years past and it is my
i tea don so far as I am able to boom the
: tents of that wonderful gold-bearing
ode to the utmost. There are eight valu
able mines in Amador County of which I
have the honor to be president, and 1
have had them thoroughly investigated,
as have others, with the result that such
men and authorities as Clarence King,
ex-head of the United States Geological
Survey, and Professor Penrose, the pro
fessor of geology at the Chicago Univers
ity, pronounce the mother lode of Cali
fornia as the greatest gold-bearing min
eral section in the United States.
"Mining men all over California con
cede that the mother lode is far and
away ahead of any similar deposit known.
It is 110 miles long and covers five coun
ties. That is to say, it is visible from
croppings for that distance. How much
farther it extends it is hard to say, but for
that distance its existence is certain.
Clarence King and Professor Penrose were
acting at the time of their investigations
for Ferdinand W. Peck of the Chicaco
Auditorium. Mr. Peck is at the present
time associated with John W. Mackay,
' John P. Jones, J. B. Haggin and other
millionaires who are preparing and are at
the present time at work on a gigantic
mining scheme on the Fremont Grant in
Mnriposa County, founded for the purpose
of developing the mother lode. Mr. Peck
told me when last in New York, and you
are at liberty to quote me with the state
ment, that John Mackay believed it was
possible to take out $500,000,000, and that
he expected to do it with the aid of his
associates. Of course I represent but a
small section of the great lode, but I use
these facts to show those who are not fa
miliar with the case that it is the logical
gold-producing center of the United
States. I read not long ago, in The Call,
I believe, that the annual output of gold
for the fiscal year would be 25 per cent
over the record of last year dosing in July,
1896. lam of the impression that it will
be more than that, but those figures are at
least safe."
Mr. Emmens further stated that it was
the purpose of the exchange to appoint
agents in California to further promote
the sale of mines listed from that State,
and that every effort would be made to
do business with the European markets.
That Jir. Emmens stands well it will be
sufficiently convincing to state that he is
the inventor of Emmensite, the new ex
plosive recently adopted by the Govern
ment, and aside from being president of
the Amador Kaiiroad, he stands on a firm
personal and financial footing at Washing
ton. He has only recently returned from
California, where he has been for the last
two years pushing matters to a close for
the purpose of getting good mining deals
before the public.
Charles M. Maxwell of San Francisco
has been at the Holland House ior the
last few days aad will shortly return to
the coast, having closed a deal for some
gold mining properties in Yuba County.
A syndicate has been formed and an
eight-stamp mill is now in construction.
A force of twenty-five men will be put to
work immediately on his return, and by
the middle of the summer it is expected
that some unusual developments will be
made, as the indications thus far point to
rock that will go high in the assay era
crucible.
Mining appears to be- picking up from
all appearances and New York seems to
be full of buyers.
Mrs. Orrin Black arrived in this city last
week and is staying with friends at 23 West
Thirty-second street. Mrs. Black is here
for the purpose of doing some special work
on the Journal and will return to San
Francisco in about two months, preferring
it, a's she Fays, to "overgrown New York."
The wedding of Phillip Mi^hels and

Mr. Gunst is a stickler for style.
I met an old Comstocker down on Wall
Btreet recently. He was holding forth to
a bevy of Easterners, and trying his best
to convince them that the West was the
only part of the earth that a young man
could find any real encouragement in.
"Why," said be, swinging his arm over
bis head, and bringing his fist down on
the paling of the Treasury steps, "I used
to get $90 a month in Gold Hill clerking in
a store in 1*7.:."
"Ninety dollars is no wages," ventured
a bystander.
"No wages?" inquired the Westerner,
leaning forward and looking knowingly at
the doubtfui one. "No wages? What?
Ninety dollars a month and a chance to
steal?"
Gold was pretty thick in those days.

This summer in New York has been par
ticularly barren for the hotels. Some of
the big institutions claim to be losing
from three to five hundred dollars a day.
One would suppose that they would tire of
that kind of an occupation, but me
managers only wink knowingly and say
they will mane it all up and more too in
the winter. This coming season will be
very fruitful, owing to the campaign and
the existence of a sack, which will oc
casionally be deposited in the hotels.
Robert H. Davis..
A Terrier
That Can Kill His Weight
In Hawks.
Barney isn't pretty to look at and his
parentage is a matter of the purest con
jecture, but he is a terror to hawks, and in
consequence his master â for Barney is a
dog â prizes him more highly than the
most aristocratic St. Bernard ever whelped.
Mr. Murphy, Barney's owner, lives out
on Bernal Heights and conducts an estab
lishment where hens of high and low de
gree vie with each other in producing eggs
for the market and where succulent broil
ers may be obtained for a consideration.
Previous to his acquisition of Barney Mr.
Murphy's life was not a path of roses,
owing to the hawks that infest the
Heights.
Just as some particularly promising pul
let had reached marketable form and age
a sharp-eyed denizen of the upper air
would swoop down â a squawk, a whistle
of wings and another marauder had
dined at Mr. Murphy's expense. The
chicken rancher had about made up his
mind to give up the business when one
day a heated argument between a game
cock and a nondescript terrier about the
place gave him an idea.
"I'll give the lad as brings me a wounded
hawk a dollar," announced Mr. Murphy
that evening while at the neighboring gro
cery, and when the news got abroad he
soon had a collection of maimed hawks to
choose from.
A big red fellow with a broken wing
suited his purpose and that afternoon a
battle royal between the terrier and the
haw.k took place in Mr. Murphy's chicken
yard.
Of course the dog finally killed the
hawk, but not until he was badly cut by
the hawk's talons and beak. That was
three months ago, and since then Barney
has lived for nothing, apparently, but to
take a fall out of the entire hawk tribe. A
speck high up in tbe sky is sufficient to
make the bristles of his buck rise, and he
fairly beams as the bird nears the earth in
search of a chicken dinner.
Barney crawls along on his belly in the
direction of the unsuspecting chickens,
and just about the time the hawk stoops
for his prey he is quite certain to meet, in
stead, a chunky terrier with snapping
jaws, springine into the air in an effort to
catch him, and with an air that plainly
says:
"Just hold up a moment. Oh, I won't
do a thing to you."
Mr. Murphy has not lost a chicken by
hawks since Barney completed his educa
tion. Neighbors have learned of Barney's
accomplishments, and have tried to pur
chase and even steal him, but he is the
pride of Mr. Murphy's heart, and money
will not buy him.
The Legless
Man Who Coasts Down
The Grades.
A man entirely minus legs would be
about the last one to be picked out as lia
ble to entertain a desire to "coast" down
the steep hills of San Francisco, yet the
spectacle of such a man speeding on pre
cipitous grades is not unusual. There is
everything in use, and the man who turns
hillside pavements into a toboggan-slide
has come around to it by slow degrees.
He has only a few inches of the stumps of
his legs remaining. He moves around on
a very small and very low four-wheeled
contrivance, to which he is securely
strapped, and he has been here long
enough to be a familiar figure. On a level
he propels himself by semi-circular
affairs to which are affixed handles.
His progress on a levei is slow. On a grade
the propellers are used as brakes. Firmly
held down on the pavement, they make a
hissing sound as the wheels of the cart re
volve rapidly. Faster and faster spin the
wheels, until the lower part of the grade is
reached. Then the crippled man, who
has been gifted with a cool head and
stout arms, "puts on brakes" in earnest.
Horrified spectators, seeing him in the
middle of the grade, expect that he will be
dashed to pieces. Not he. On the con
trary, he handles his brakes with coolness
and certainly and never makes a miss in
stopping when he wishes.
The Lombard -
Street Man Who Placards
All the Trees.
Jacob Engle lives on the northeast cor
ner of Lombard and Flllmore streets.
Rose bushes are trained upon the sides of
his house. A smooth sward like a broad
ribbon of green lies between his house and
his boundary fences. On the south and
west of his home are growing hardy shade
trees of the evergreen variety. These were
set out by Mr. Engle personally, and lie
holds them in high recard. In fact, he
has for them a sort of Druidic attachment.
"They did not cost much and they would
not sell for much," he said when talking
about them, "but if you should ask me
how much they are worth to me I would
respond by asking what price you think I
would place on my wife and children. I
simply don't want to part with them.'*
But there may be some danger that the
trees on Lombard street will be cut down.
Mr. Engle has heard that the street may
be widened and ne has placed placards on
the trees warning every one to leave them
alone. These placards are read by all
passers. Mr. Engle thinks that the or
dinance concerning trees is sufficient to
protect his vegetable pet? against even the
Street Department, and he explains that
the Street Department is included in the
warning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
One of the greatest beauties of whist is
the drawing of inferences from the cards
played by your partner or adversary. To
win as many tricks as possible is always
good whist and laudable; to win more
than others playing the same hands is
satisfactory to the player and shows men
tal ability; but the keenest enjoyment
comes not from the number of tricks made,
but from a study of the motives that actu
ate a player, his reasoning and the work
ing of his mind, the locating of the un
played cards in the three unseen hands,
and then playing your own cards so as to
win a trict thai could not have been made
had the cards remaining unplayed not
been properly located. This is one ot the
reasons why good players prefer to play
against Btrong opponents. Every card
dropped on tne table by an expert is
played for some reason, and the other
players at once try to ascertain the mo
tive for the play. The novice is constantly
at a loss what to do and decides to "play
the card his thumb is on" for luck.
In the hands of good players every lead
or follow is in the nature of a puzzle which
the piayer offers for a solution and which
the other) work out according to their
ability. Naturally the player endeavors
to make the puzzle easy of solution for hia
partner and difficult for the adversaries.
But to do so players of the first class do
not play false cards when the only object
is to deceive. They can win without re
course to such play.
False cards played without a reason
that is, played simply as false cards â have
no place in whist, and rob the other play
ers at the table of their enjoyment. You
should remember that you have no more
right to deprive your associates of their
pleasure at whist than you would have to
mar their pleasure at a dinner by acting
in an uncouth and unseemly manner. Po
lite society requires you to conduct your
self conventionally, or you will not be tol
erated. Whist etiquette asks the same.
Many players advocate the study of the
rules, the leads and the follows, and insist
that all the recognized conventions shall
be respected, but if they happen to have a
partner who is not well posted they aban
don all their prin cirl-es at once because
their partner cannot understand the play
and they want to "fool the opponents."
Touching such players Pettis says: "He
lowers himself andinjures his reputation
who falsities his hand to the opponents
merely because his whilom partner may
not understand what is correct. What
would be thought of any one of three men
who took an ambitious fourth into occa
sional business council and who changed
his cherished policy of right to the delib
erate doing of wrong merely to keep pace
with the action of the uninstructed new
comer."
None of the fine endings, brilliant coups,
remarkable finesse and other good plays
by bright whist minds which are con
stantly published would have been possi
ble had the players at the table indulged
in false carding.
Take any of the hands illustrated show
ing some particular brilliant play; suosti
tute a false card or two in the early part of
the earne and see the result. These plays
which excite our keen admiration would
never take place. Hamilton says on this
subject:
"It is not in harmony with modern
scientific whist to play a false card under
any circumstances, not even when it de
ceives the adversaries only. If you, sec
ond hand, holding queen, knave and one
small, play queen, and if on thÂ« return of
the suit the leader finesses the 10, reading
that you cannot have the knave, and your
knave wins, and if by that false play you
gain a trick, you have a tricK that byright
does not belong to you.
"There is no strategy, no merit, in the
play. You have practiced a cheap deceit
and nothing more. * * *
"If the piay of one false card is sanc
tioned so may the play of two, or you
may play one card conventionally and the
other not, and the integrity of the game is
gone. * * *
"If the right to play false is recognized
then there is no limit to the pernicious
and disintegrating practice. Besides, the
privilege to play false goes around the
table, and in the end you have been de
ceived as often as you have deceived
others. You may not hope to Decome
more adept in the play of false cards than
your opponents, for such play is devoid of
strategy, and the novice will outdo you."
False cards and irregular plays and
leads must not be confounded. The lat
ter are the spice of the game and prevent
it from becoming unpalatable. To divine
the reason for an irregular play is a pleas
ure, but there must be a reason beyond
mere deception. Ti;e better the player
the less can he afford to play false cards,
because he is always quoted as authority.
The poorer his partner the more rigidly
should he adhere to the rules, otherwise
the poor player, seem < the false leads and
follows, will imitate him at once, and the
game is ruined for all.
The world loves a good fighter â if he
puts up a clean, "square fight. So we love
a hard fighting wnist opponent. But we
demand a clean whist tighter. Elect the
class you wish to play in â bumblepuppy
or whist. If you enter the whist class
leave the puppy outdoors. Do not enter
the whist arena as a whist fighter and after
you are in use bumblepuppy tactics. If
] bumblepuppy is your choice, remain in
; your own class. Considerable discussion
j is going on about the play of second hand
I holding king and one small. Below is
I given a hand played last week with a va
riation of six tricks, depending upon i
whether second hand plays the king or
not on the first round.
King diamonds trump. East to lead.
TABLE 1.
(The winning card Is underscored )
Score: N. and & 2, E. Rn<l W. 11.
COMMENT.
East at each table opens with the fourth
besi club, holding A, J and three small.
Perhaps the absence of re-entry cards
justifies the play. We give the hand as
played. Whetlier the low lead is a trick
winner in this case depends on the play of
second hand. At table 1 it gained. If
East had opened with ace clubs and con
tinued with small on second round the
subsequent play would have been similar
to table 2.
Trick 2â West tries to lead through the
turned king. North has no good reason
â¢
WHIST
for covering what looks like a strengthen
ing card. East plays the green signal.
Trick 3â West chuckles.
Trick 5-^East cannot finesse as X is
marked with South.
Trick 9. It is not clear why South plays
his ace.
TABLE 2.
Score: N. and S. 3, E. and W. 5.
Trick Iâ West does not begin a call, as
he does not want trumps led through him.
Trick 4 â North must discontinue the
spades, as one opponent will trump and
the. other discard.
Trick 6 â West n akes an effort to obtain
the lead. He evidently located the X
hearts with his partner.
Trick 7 â North I as no choice but to lead
through the strong club suit. W r est must
take his partner'-* trick, as the ace clubs
is marked with East.
Trick BâThe8 â The 10 0 is only a variation of
the tactics used at table 1, to lead through
the kins;. North, however, plays the king
and gains two tricks by the play. North
noted that East had not asked for trumps,
although he had opportunities to do so in
both spades and hearts.
WHISTLETS.
George L. Bunn, in the St. Paul Globe,
thus describes a pretty trump play:
"Another pretty point in trump play
arose in a practice game the other night;
a small club is turned by West; North
1> ads ace of trumps; East plays five: South
has the following hand: Spades, jack, 3;
hearts. 6, 5; clubs, X, 7; diamonds, A, X,
Q, J, 7, 6. 4. What should South play on
his partner's ace oi trump? Clearly the
King, for in all probability North has
both queen and jack of trumps, as with
out them he would not lead ace unless
he had seven trumps at least;
by throwing the king, South gets
out of the way and enables North to get
three swings and thereby probably to ex
haust all the adversaries' trumps. South
meanwhile indicating his great diamond
suit by his discards, while if South plays
his small trump his king wins the next
trick and he must either lead his diamonds
and have the suit shut out by an adverse
trump or he must lead one "of the other
suits, taking the chance of losing several
tricks in those suits by the attempt to put
his partner in. In the hand mentioned
four tricks are gained by throwing the
king, as North held six trumps with ace,
queen, jack and was thus enabled to draw
all the trumps b fore his singleton dia
mond was taken away from him."
The question of a woman's whist league
is being discussed. The Philadelphia Tel
egraph thus comments on the subject:
The large number of women whisters
from Philadelphia and other cities that
will attend the Brooklyn congress fur
nishes most conclusive evidence of the in
terest taken by the fair sex in the game,
and proves beyond doubt that in the future
women's whisi is a question that must be
seriously considered by all interested in the
game. * * â¦ Women in whist must
therefore be recognized either by giving
them co-equal rights with men in the
American Whist League or by the forma
tion of an associate' organization, which
will act in conjunction and harmony with
the A. W. L. upon all subjects of legisla
tion, and which will hold its own tourna
| ments, awarding the women's champion
ship of America to its champions.
For many reasons the latter plan appears
to be by far the more feasible and advan
tageous; that it snouid be got under
! way few will question, and that the time
I for launching it is the Brooklyn coneress
there can also be but little do;'bt.
"The following end situation occurred
in a practice game the past week: Three
cards are in each hand and trumps are
out; North has king, nine and five of dia
monds, East queen and six of diamonds
and jack of hearts; South seven and three
jof diamonds and queen of hearts; West
ten and eight of diamonds and the thir
teenth spade; North leads king of dia
monds and East throws queen of dia
monds, enabling West to win the next
I trick with the ten of diamonds and make
the thirteenth spade; whereas, by playing
low, West would win the next trick and
would be compelled to lose his heart to
Souths queen."
All the writers of whist news in the
Eastern papers say that in local whist cir
cles matters are very quiet just at present.
I All the "stars" are in Brooklyn, and many
j other players have gone to the country on
outing trips.
Hereafter the Tuesday, Thursday and
'â  Saturday night games at the Trist Dupli
cate Whist Club will be started promptly
'at 8:15 o'clock. The contest committee
i propose to enforce this rule strictly if it i 3
I possible to do so, and players arriving at
the clubrooms after that time will not be
given a chance to play if the tables have
been made up.
"You cannot favorably impress gentle
men with your game by thumping the
table upon the delivery of certain winning
cards that you happen to hold. You add
nothing to the score. The cards will win
just as surely if thrown with quiet dig
nity. C. D. P. H."
The Newark Call has this advice to
players training for a match :
"The whist brain of a player should
have complete rest for at least ten days
I previous to the game; in that time no
whist should be played; no debatable or
knotty questions shouKi be entertained ;
no study nor solving of problems should
be indulged in. In this manner one com
mences with a fresh, vigorous mind, and
is much better able to retain his powers
longer than when he is ' whist stale.' "
The whist editor-in-chief of The Call
started lor the Brooklyn congress, but has
not been heard of since he met President
Schwab, and report has it that he is lost in
RoDinson County.
To students: In the middle of a hand
South leads the 6 of spades, second hand
plays 7; North, holding X, 9, 8,4. plays X,
and the trick is taken by fourth hand witti
the A. Five better than the 6 are ac
counted for. If you were North and strong
in trumps would you exhaust trumps and
give your partner a spade?
If you hold A, Q, 10 and 3 of trumps and
y our partner leads the 9 of trumps, second
hand plays 2, what would you do?
If a player leads the ace and follows
with the 10 how many cards has he in
suit; what does he show and what does he
deny?
If" he leads the king and it win 3 and
he follows with the knave what does he
show and deny?
If he leads the ace and follows with 9
what has he and how many cards in suit?
If he leads the knave and" follows it with
the ace how many cards in suit has he?
If he leads the knave and follows it with
the queen what has he?
If you are second hand holding A, X
and 10 of a plain suit what would you
play on a 7 led?
Holding X, Q, 10 and 4 what would you
play second hand on 7 led?
Holding X J only, what would you play
second hand on an 8 led?
An ending for students.
A trick is often lost by careless play at
the end of a hand. Here is an illustration
of an ending which came in local play last
week. It is simple, but illustrates how
easily careless or thoughtless play can
lo se.
There are two cards remaining in each
and. South has the lead and holds the
best trump and a losing twelfth card of a
plain suit, the best being with one of the
opponents. North is marked with a
trump, but its size is not known to South.
There is also a trump with each of the
opponents.
The thoughtless player will lead the
best trump to draw the remaining trump
of the adversaries and then lay down the
losing plain suit card. A very little re
flection will show that the only chance to
make both tricks is to lead the plain suit
card. If North has a better trump than
the opponent, who has none of the suit led,
he will win and the best trump must make
the last trick. If North has not a better
trump than the opponents nothing is lost,
! as in that case North and South can make
but one trick.
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
A. B. Câ There is no direct penalty for
saying to your partner "You call a lead."
It is only a breach of etiquette. A "breach
of etiquette" is not punishable under the
rules. The only remedy is to cease to play
with those who habitually disregard the
etiquette of the game.
L. S. M. â If fourth hand draws a card
before second hand plays, intimating by
his manner that he can take the trick, or
if a player leads a card and before all have
played draws another, intimating that the
card led will win and that he will have
another lead, no penalty can be exacted.
It is only a violation of whist etiquette.
It is playing "signs," not signals.
S. S. â Tbe answer to problem No. 6 will
not be published until the solution is given
in "Whist" in the June number.
Several queries remain unanswered,
awaiting the return of the Whist editor
from the Brooklyn congress.
PRIZE PROBLEM.
The problem given below is from Pro
fessor C. Harold Howard. It is unique in
that all the cards can be placed after the
fourth round.
A prize of a dozen packs of playing cards

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Composite Lighter Renown
Has a Successful Trial
Trip.
Loss of the Scottish Dales on One of
the Islands of the Fiji
Group.
Stewart Menzies & Co.'s new boat, the
Renown, had her trial trip on the bay
yesterday. Her machinery stood all tbe
j strain of a first trip, and, with the excep
j tion of a hot journal, there was not a
j hitch from start to finish. The Renown is
a flat-bottomed lighter.
Since the loading: and unloading of ves
sels at Sausalito and Port Costa have grown
to large proportions the stevedores have
been put to great straits on occasions to
discharge and load them. Captain Men
zies determined to do away with this
difficulty, so he had the Renown built. By
means of a simple contrivance her hoist
ing machinery can be connected with the
| propeller, and under full steam the strange
craft can make about six knots an hour.
The machinery was built by Murray Bros.,
and yesterday, without any preliminary
work in order to get the bearings into good
working shape, the Renown made the trip
to Sausalito and back in good time. Cap
tain Menzies is not satisfied, however, and
intends putting a large propeller in the
strange-looking craft in order to make
better time.
In making the trip across the bay Fred
G. Wilson acted as master, and to do so he
had to pass an examination and get out a
pilot's license. The Renown was steered
by means of ropes and Captain Wilson
showed his thorough knowledge of the
tide rip :in the bay by the manner in
which he eot his vessel inshore, and took
adiMintaKe of every eddy and current.
The Renown towed to Sausalito the
boats of the British ships Verejean, Ley
land Brothers, Beechbar.k and Almora, all
of which took part in the regatta.
The war between the Southern Pacific
and the river pilots has only just begun
and the latter are determined to have
damages. In its answer to the complaint
filed by the pilots, the railroad company
says that R. A. Paul was never employed
as a pilot on the steamer Apache, but only
as a wheelman, and that, therefore, no law
was violated. This statement is supported
by the affidavits of Cbarles Tnompson, F.
A. Fish, K. A. White and R. A. Paul.
The pilots say that they will prove that
the Modoc and Apache have always been
steered with steam gear and that for years
past there never has been anybody in the
Eilot-house save the captain and the pilot,
v this way they expect to prove their case
and make the railroad company pay dam
ages.
The yachts of the various clubs started
on an excursion to Vallejo yesterday
afternoon. The San Francisco, Corinthian
and California clubs were well represented,
and with a wet sheet and a flowing sea
all should have made good passages. The
boats will lie off Vallejo all day and the
passengers and crews will visit the pretty
town and also Mare Island. A start for
home will be made this afternoon and
both visitors and men will probably be
back in time for supper.
The pumps on the Blairmore gave out
again at the critical moment yesterday,
and the work of raising the sunken ship
had to be abandoned for another twenty
four hours.
The steamer Portland, which left here
on the 20th inst. for Seattle, has been in
trouble. She was caught in the recent
gale that has done so much damage on the
coast, and was unable to make headway
against it. She ran out of coal and some
of the woodwork had to be burned up in
order to get the vessel into Astoria. There
she took on board a fresh supply of fuel
and resumed her voyage to-day.
News reached the Merchants' Exchange
yesterday that the British ship Scottish
Dales, well known in this port, had gone
on one of tbe islands of the Fijian group
and had become a total loss. The crew
escaped and were landed at Suva, the capi
tal of Fiji, from which point they will be
sent to Melbourne or Sydney, Australia,
and thence to England. The Scottish Dales
went from here to the Sound and at
Tacoma loaded wheat for Port JtMrie, in
South Australia. She was not heard
from until to-day, when the news arrived
that she was a total wreck on the island of
Vatoa. She was a 1998-ton craft, built for
W. H. Ross <fe Co. in 1883.
The Pacific Mail Company's Rio de Jan
eiro and Acapuico both sailed to-day, the
former for the Orient and the latter for
Central American ports. Among the Rio's
passengers was George Wise, son of the
Collector of the Port, and in consequence
there was a ;big crowd of Federal officials
at the dock to see him off. Both vessels
went away with full cargoes, but very few
passengers.

They Climb
Many Miles of Stairs
Every Year.
Two passengers on a Union-street cable
car were discussing stair-climbing as a
fairly steady occupation. Their remarks
led to an investigation concerning the
family who climb the most stairs of any
one in San Francisco to reach their front
door from the street level It is believed
that the occupants of a house on Union
street, on the south side, just above Tay
lor, have this distinction. They climb
sixty stairs, In three flights, every time
they pass between the street and their
home. This, of course, does not place
them in competition with the residents of
Telegraph Hill who climb from Sansome
street up to the summit of that hill. They
are in another class, for their steps are
practically up a literal ''air line" from one
block to another. Allowing that any per
son passes over sixty stairs three times
each way per diem, and that the steps
are 8 inches high on the averaee, this in
volves stair climbing and descending to
the amount of 87,600 feet per annum.

tection to raise prices.

Among other ways of giving Grover a

Prominent Democrats will go to the

The New Yorkers are great on the in

Many a cautious old Democrat will talk

Tolstoi says the coming generation will

It is reported in New York that Warner

It is believed ex-Governor Hogg of Texas
has permanently retired from politics, not
because he has said so, but because he
has been overheard calling the bicycle a

a crooked-back generation."
The New York Sun declares it is Cleve

that has driven the Democratic party into

HISTORIC CONTINUITY.
The campaign before us. it is universally
conceded, marks an epoch when old things
terminate and new commence. The long
antagonism between the South and the
llepublican party, which made the South
ern States and their electoral votes solid
for Democracy, is over. The Southern
people have learned that Republicans are
not their enemies but their friends; that
protection does not injure them but
benefits them, and as a consequence they
are now turning aside from their preju
dices to consider their interests. This
change in the attitude of the South
changes the appearance of the whole po
litical situation, and it would seem that
new parties as well as new issues were
about to emerge from tbe crisis.
It is most fortunate at this juncture
that the Republican party has a candidate
whose personal record shows the historic
continuity of the party and attests the
truth that the party of protection, which
so many stalwart Southerners will sup
port this year, is the identical party
which they opposed under the leadership
of Lincoln and of Grant. Many things
have changed, but the llepublican party
has not changed. It tipholds to-day the
principles it asserted in ISGO and stands
steadfast for them, because those prin
ciples which were for the welfare of the
country then are for tbe welfare of the
country now and will be to the end of time.
The beginning of McKinley'a career car
ries us back to the war period and revives
ihe sacrei memories of the heroes who
died in defense of the Union and for tbe
liberty of the slave. As a boy of 18 he
entered the volunteer army and served
with distinguished merit during the whole
course of the war, emerging with the rank
of major, which he had won by arduous
service. By this war record he connects
us with the great days of Lincoln and
Grant and Sheridan and recalls to the
public mind the aspirations, the heroisms
and the patriotisms of those i'lustrious
men and of the party that sustained them
in power and strengthened their hands in
hours of danger and difficulty.
Entering public life almost immediately
at the close of the war Major McKinley
took part in the establishment of those
measures of reconstruction which secured
tbe maintenance by law of all that had
been gained by the sword. He was also a
leader in that wise Republican policy of
conciliation to tbe better class of the
Southern people which has made this a
Union of universal loyalty a3 well as of
law. By his services during this period
he brings the Republicanism of 18G5 into
unbroken connection with the Republi
canism of a period when there is no longer
a Southern question before the people or
any sectional issue to disturb the country.
It has been no accident of circumstance
that has brought this soldier boy of 1860,
this hpro statesman of the reconstruction
period, to the leadership of the Republi
can party at this crisis, when the intelli
gent and conservative men of North and
South will vote together for the restora
tion of the prosperity of their common
country. His leadership has come through
his genius, his integrity and his patriot
ism, acting in accord with the natural de
velopment of our National history. No
man in the whole Union is better fitted to
hold the high office of President of the
Nation as the country passes from the old
order to the new. Southern men as well
a3 Northern may delight to honor the
soldier candidate, whose record repre
sents the historic continuity of the Re
publican party, and wbo3e policy is a
pledge of patriotism, protection and pros
perity.
THE VOICE OF BUSINESS MEN.
The position of The Call, that because
of the wreck and ruin which the operation
of the Wilson-Gorman tariff has inflicted
upon the country the question of re
storing the McKinley schedule is naturally
and necessarily tne paramount issue, is
indorsed by manufacturers, fruit and to
bacco growers and business men of all
lines of trade. On another page will be
found interviews with many of the most
substantial manufacturers of and dealers
in special and general lines of commer
cial commodities, aud if any one has a
doubt as to these representative men
of California's industrial and commercial
interests feel, let him read the opinions of
these gentlemen. But whether the reader
believes or does not believe that protection
should be made the paramount issue, let
him read these interviews, for the informa
tion they furnish will be found an in
structive recital of facts.
It has been clear to the minds of the
business men of California for nearly three
years that a schedule of import taxes as high
if not higher than was provided for in what
is known as the McKinley act of 1890 is
needed to give proper encouragement to
the several lines of industry in this
State. The material, the energy and the
capital are now and have been waiting
for assurances that they can rely upon
the needed protection from business
wrecking competition of other countries.
Scarcely a manufacturer or exporter, so
far as The Call has been able to ascer
tain, thinks it would be wise to divert
public attention from the tariff question
by giving undue prominence to other is
sues. Not that the money question, a
manly foreign policy and reciprocal trade
relations with other countries are not mat
ters of great concern, but let us first look
to the foundation of the edifice and
strengthen it in all its parts. No
thinking man would say that the
country could be put upon a sound
business footing while such a law as the
present tariff act was operative, for both
experience and observation say it could
not. If the tariff question transcends all
others in importance it is because of the
demand of the trade and industries of the
country that it be given preference. It is
the cry for help from struggling mills,
factories and wage-earners that makes
protection the central thought.
FALSE PROPERTY APPRAISEMENT
It is a matter of very little consequence
whether tbe appraisement of property is
the full or the one-tenth of its value. It
is. uniformity of appraisement that ,is
wanted, and that is what are called small
taxpayers should demand and keep on de
manding until such a system of assessing
values is established as would be equita
ble. The spirit of California's revenue
laws intends that there shall be perfect
equality and fair appraisement, but cor
porations are permitted to undervalue

erty-holders that some kind of a
remedy should be applied. But the rich
corporations are not the only ones that
are favored. There are very many pri
vate individuals who appear to know bow
to have their property greatly under
valued. There is no doubt at all that
were all property assessed in ratio to its
selling value taxes could be reduced enor
mously, and that is exactly what should
be done.
Some people do not seem to realize that
it is just as much of a crime to rob the
community as an organized government
as it is to rob a citizen by lying him out of
his money, but there is no difference, ex
cept that in lying tbe community out of
its just dues the perjurer robs the poor.
The position of some of our property
holders and the corporations generally is
that the original cost should be the basis
of appraisement, but it is not at all-ten
able. The earning power and oppor
tunity of property represent its true
value. The land upon which a very large
percentage of American towns and cities
stand was sold originally for $1 25
per acre, and it would be just as much
sense to appraise its value on that basis as
it would be to appraise the Market-street
Railway's property at the first cost of con
struction. If there is one feature of our
system of government that needs to be re
adjusted more than another it is tbe
method of appraisement of property
values.
THE FIELD OF ECONOMICS.
The story of the philosophy of eco
nomics is very much more interesting and
entertaining when the subject is partially
freed from political and ethical environ
ment. The field of the practical play of
economics reaches from producer to con
sumer, and between these two lie all the
machinery, appliances and agencies of
commerce. Between these two points,
producer and consumer, the entire oper
ation of cause and effect is confined, hence
if one epot is touched, whether in rudeness
or sympathy, an effect is produced which
is felt by producer and consumer, and all
that is between. The bounds of the com
ine; and going of every one are set, and be
tween them he is free to come and go, but
they interlace with the bounds of another
at some point, as does that one's interlace
with still another, hence there is no such
thing in existence as entire separateness.
Commerce strains and groans in effort
to reach the consumer, but the expense of
it all is charged to him. He carries, in
deed, tbe burden of cost of production and
transportation, including the expense of
all the intermediary agencies, commonly
called middlemen. The consumer is
separated from the producer by two, to
him, unsurmountable obstructionsâ time
and distance. But the rail or water com
merce-carrier undertakes to remove in
part these obstructions, and in ratio to the
carrier's ability to remove them is the
burden of the consumer lightened, and it
is right here that the importance of public
supervision of the charges of the com
mon carrier for the use of his transporta
tion facilities is made manifest. We say
public supervision because it is a matter
in which every participant in the move
ment from the producer's fields, to illus
trate, to the provision closet of the con
sumer has personal interest, which in turn
involves the business connection of every
intermediary factor and agency.
The farmer is free to sow or not that a
surplus may be left after supplying his own
| needs, but if he does restrict his product to
i his own needs he cripples the threshing
j machine, the elevator, the railway agencies
I and the distributor to consumers from
the final point of accumulation and dis
tribution, by causing a scarcity. As aeon
sequence, the consumer is loaded with an
extra burden which is likely to include in
creased charges by tbe elevator, railway
and all other intermediary agencies.
There is a point, of course, beyond which
the consumer trill not go. He will restrict
his expenditure by consuming coarser
food and wearing apparel when the bur
den becomes too great, and that is, in
fact, the only protection he has against
combinations to advance the cost of his
living beyond what his income justifies
his paying. In any event, however, the
farmer will have plenty for his own con
sumption.
If the product of the consumer (we mean
by consumer the industrial operative who
has to buy every article of consumption)
advances materially upon a permanent
basis his wages are likely to be advanced,
thus widening the difference between in
crease and expenditure and leaving him a
greater net difference. Now, assuming
that the farmer's products do not advance
in the same proportion, he is still fetter
circumstanced than the operative. The
smallest outlay of the farmer is for manu
factured goods; naturally so because the
very expensive items of consumption, such
as breadstuffs, meat and vegetables, to
gether with house rent, fuel and lighting,
cost him practically nothing at all. On
the other hand the largest expenditure of
the operative is for the very things the
farmer gets free, so in any event the
farmer could not have tha cause to com
plain that the operative would have.
The study of the philosophy of ap
plied economics could not help convincine
any fair-minded man that it is the first
duty of the Government to lighten the
burden of operatives by equalization, so to
speak. That is to say, conditions should
be so that there would be a reasonable and
just difference between expenditure and
income of the frugal and industrious
opeiative so as to leave him a net surplus.
When that is done, conditions should be
such that would make the farmer the
operative's only source of provisions and
breadstuffs supplies at prices full up to
where another advance would be checked
by outside competition, or, in other words,
up to where the farmsr had gone beyond
the protection which the Government
gives him, which should of course be
ample to leave him a margin of profit as
is secured to the industrial operative. The
application of the principles of protection
upon these lines would provide sufficient
encouragement to steady and sure wealth
expansion, and at the same lime prevent
an unjust distribution of wealth's in
creases. It is this kind of protection that
tbe Republican party has obligated itself
to give to the country.
THE WAY OF AN ENGLISH JUDGE.
The difference between the methods of
English and American courts when deal
ing with criminals is very marked. Annie
Dyer, the "baby-farmer" and child-mur
derer, whose awful crimes shocked the
civilized world a month ago, was convicted
after a trial lasting only two days, and two
weeks later she was hanged. An Ameri
can lawyer was present during the trial
and he came away thoroughly convinced
that the criminal court methods of Eng
land are very far superior to ours. He
was surprised to see a jury impaneled,
sworn and in the jury-box in less than
twenty minutes. Upon inquiry he found
that the court would not allow such ques
tion to be propounded as our courts per
mit. Tbe Judge simply wanted to know
that a man was of sound mind and good
habits. As to what his private opinion
might be or how much he might have
read about the case the court cared,
nothing. The Judge assumed as a matter
of course that an Englishman would be
true to his oathâ that is, to divest his
mind of all prejudice and try the case on
its merits. That certainly was a high
compliment to the loyalty of Englishmen
to the written law of the land. It made
no difference to the court whether a juror
was or was not opposed to capital punish
ment. There was the law and that was
enough. The jury was not Impaneled to
moralize, but to vindicate the law of the
land.
The question of the sex of the prisoner
did not enter into the proceeding before the
court. The Judge wanted and would allow
nothing but clear, cold, hard facts to be
presented. He would allow no spread
eagle appeals to the sentimental side of
the jurors. He not only gave the prisoner
every possible opportunity to prove her in
nocence, but questioned the witnesses him
self to see if something in her favor could
not be revealed. The Judge sat there ap
parently indifferent to Great Britain, the
public or the prisoner. He represented
the law and was there to administer it. It
mattered not to him whether the prisoner
was a man or a woman, of noble or humble
birth. It was charged that the law had
been grossly violated. Naturally ne did
not believe it had been when the trial
opened. He could not, in his official capa
city, any more understand how a citizen of
England could violate a law of England
than a juror could fail to observe his oath to
try the case according to the law. But when
the evidence was all in, the case summed
up by the attorney? and the most had
been made of all extenuating circum
stances, the jury said the prisoner was
guilty, the Judere believed so, too. The
guilty one must be punished in the same
degree that she violated the law, and the
Judge, seeing nothing but an insulted and
outraged law, sent the prisoner away to
be hanged in a fortnight. How very much
there is need of such a Judge and jury in
San Francisco.
TROUBLE FOR THE DEMOCRACY
The latest from Governor Altgeld is that
he proposes to throw the Illinois delega
tion's vote to a man by the name of Sam
uel P. McConnell for President, and if he
fails to win on that line he will insist that
his friend McConnell be given the other
end of the ticket. That is all right, but
who discovered McConnell and what
about him? There was no man by that
name prominently mixed up in the Hay
market riots, but he must have done some
thing some time to have endeared him to
Altgeld. The Governor does everything
for a purpose, and there is a meaning in
springing the man McConnell, whoever he
may be, at the last hour before the Chi
cago nomination.
For some time the signs of the times
have pointed to a rupture between Altgeld
and the Boies and the Bland combina
tions, and at the State Convention the
other day Altgeld would not permit either
Boies' or Bland's agents to work up a
boom for their principal. Just what the
trouble is does not appear, but it is safe to
say that Altgeld is manipulating to have
himself re-elected Governor of Illinois. It
is very certain that Illinois will return a
McKinley electoral vote, but that does not
necessarily mean a Republican Governor.
So if Altgeld can give his man, McConnell,
the compliment, of the vote of the State
delegation for President or Vice- President
it may be that McConnel) will return the
compliment by securing to Altgeld in his
race for Governor such votes of the Chi
cago tough element as he does not already
own.
But however that may be, it means a
split in the silver wing of the Democracy
unless Altgeld has things pretty much his
own way. Altgeld hates Cleveland as he
never hated any other man. By ordering
troops toChicago during the Pullman strike
the President destroyed a good many feath
ers that Altgeld was getting ready to don.
The strike was the opportunity of Altgeld's
lifetime, and he knew it. He would have
gone to Chicago in his official capacity as
Governor, and made a life friend and
worker of every striker. It was a wonder
ful opportunity to play his kind of politics,
but Cleveland got in first, and since then
Altgeld has lived for the one purpose of
putting down the President and covering
him with thecontemptof every man whom
he could control. Aside from their poli
tico, Boies and Bland are men of high
character, and that being exactly what
Altgeld does not want in his campaign, no
doubt he has formed an alliance with the
McConnell ring. But in any event it will
make more trouble for the Chicago con
vention.
A BOX-PLEATED SKIRT.
The new skirts are cut with two gores in the
back, which form box-pleats. The one shown
here has in all seven gores, the two side gores
flowing wide at the foot and close fitted over
the hips. The great advantage gained by two
side gores is the permanent good shape, for
these gores do not stretch out of shape as a
wider and necessarily more bias gore would.
All fabrics are cut in this way, and the side
gores are usually cut straight at the front
edge; but if striped goods are used they may be
cut straight through the center, thus lining
the edges both bias aud making the stripes
meet at the seams. The back gores are cut with
the straight thread through the center in any
Black satin is etill as much used as any
other fabric for skirts to be worn with fancy
blouse waists or coat basques for full dress oc
casions. The latest thing is the lining of white
silk, finished with a plain binding of velveteen
or braid, the balayeuse ruffle being quite out of
date. The only stiffening now used is a band
of haircloth about six inches wide at the foot,
and even this is omitted in many skirts, the
flare depending on the proper cut and on the
body of the silk usea for lining.
Dresden silks are much used for separate
skirts, and recommefld themselves because
two or three different colors will generally har
monize with them, and so a great variety in
waist is possible. One of brown with black
satin threads, the flowera being indefinite
tones of violet, had a brown velvet coat basque,
a black satin waist and a waist of violet chiffon
trimmed with sable for evening wear.
The death is reported from London of Thomas
Charles Scott, fifth Earl of Clonmell, in the
peerage of Ireland. He was born in 1840, and
succeeded his brother in the earldom in 1891.

and was retired from the army as honorary

A LIVING LANDMARK OF SAN
FRANCISCO.
The gradual but sure obliteration and ex
tinction of the landmarks of San Francisco
impresses the pioneer with a feeling of sad
ness that none but a pioneer can realize. As
he witnesses the destruction or demolition of
some time-honored structure, upon â¢which his
mind throngs with memories of the past, to
make room for some modern edifice, he is re
minded of the fact that he himself constitutes
one of the few human landmarks that are
rapidly passing and disappearing to make
place for a newer if not a better generation,
and as his gaze roams about him, scarcely able
to recognize a featnre of nature or of human
ity, a feeling of isolation, almost of desola
tion, oppresses him.
These reflections were evoked while the
writer, himself a pioneer, was visiting an aged
invalid a short time since, and prompts this
sketch of the career of a man who can justly
claim to be one of the pioneer founders of San
Francisco.
As a rule the lives of the early comers to
California are more replete witl. romantic and
dramatic incident than the lives of those
passed in the older-settled communities for a
like number of years. The life and career of
the subject of this sketch cannot fail to prove
interesting to the general reader, but espe
cially to those conversant with the political
history of the State from its origin, both as to
men and measures.
Ezekiel Wilson was born in Warner, N. 11.,
October 7, 1810. He is of honorable Scotch
and Irish descent. He arrived in California
in February, 1850. He mined at Murphys
Camp, in Calaveras County, for a short time,
but finding- tne life of a miner uncongenial,
he removed to San Francisco, and shortly after
Ezekicl Wilson.
[From a daguerrotypc taken in this City forty
years ago.]
opp nod a restaurant near the corner of Clay
aud Pike streets, in which he was quite suc
cessful. It was near the Postoflice at that
time. On the removal of the Postoffice, in
1851, he sought another location and ob
tained from Captain J. L. Folsom the
lot on the northwest corner of Rangome
and llalleck streets, upon which he erected a
building afterward kuown as "Wilson's Ex
change," it being the second brick building
erected upon Sausome street. It soon became
one of the most Doted hotels in San Francisco.
It was opened In December, 1851, and became
the popular resort for people all over the State,
especially for those connected with politics.
Its receipts uveraged from $17,000 to #20,000 a
inoiitti. It has more recently been known as
the "American Exchange." When the panic
of 1555-00 ensued, Mr. Wilson became the
proprietor of the Railroad House on Clay
street, running through to Commercial. By
this vocation he became extensively and popu
larly known.
In ISSD he joined the American party, by
whom he was elected a State Prison Di
rector, Mr. Wilson running ahead of his ticket
At this time the prison contained above 500
prisoners, but the extravagance and waste in
its management so disgusted him that upon
the meeting of the Legislature he went to Sac
ramento and consulting H. S. Foote and H. A.
Crab, noted members of the party, he suc
ceeded In having a bill passed that recon
structed the State prison management and
legislated himself and colleagues out of office
after haviug served some three months.
He was among the llrst to go to Nevada when
the mining excitement commenced there, but
not meeting with much success he soon
returned to San Francisco, and took an active
part in politics. His extensive and intimate
acquaintance with the politicians throughout
the State, and his universal popularity with
them, soon made him an important factor in
all political affairs, both as to men and
measures, which importance is recognized and
continues up to the present time, and to im
portant legislation and individual aspiration
alike he has been considered a political neces
sity ; and success in either case has been due in
numerous instances to his personal influence
an-1 advocacy. He has been identified politi
cally with the most noted measures and men
of nis time. He was a warm personal friend of
Broderick and Baker. He was allied with
Stanford, Sargent, Phelps, Low and the other
prominent men in affiliation with the Republi
can party la their political contests from the
origin of the party to the present time.
The passing of the Dill authorizing the Mer
cantile Library to cancel its debt of $190,000
by aid of a lottery was greatly due to his
personal influence and management Few
characters have wielded so great, and it may
be justly said, a better influence in the politics
of the State for the last forty years than old
uncle "Zeke" Wilson, as his numerous friends
affectionately term him.
Mr. Wilson was married in early life before
coming to California to Miss Shumway, a
most estimable lady of noted and honorable
Huguenot descent, who, it is sad to state, has
been stricken with grievous sickness in recent
years. They have had issue two children, one
ouly of whom survives, Miss Clara L., a charm
ing and accomplished youne lady, who is the
sunlight and joy of her lovin? parents.
Early in the sixties Mr. Wilson acquired
some eighty acres of land in what is now
known as the Richmond district in San Fran
cisco, a great portion of which, now laid out
in city lots, is still retained by him, aud which
it is gratifying to his friends to know, enables
him to pÂ»ss the remainder of his days in his
lovely rural home almost in the heart of the
great city that he has seen grow up around
him, with his loved ones, and surrounded with
all the comfort and luxury that their hearts
can desire.
Although "Uncle Zeke" is now in age and
feebleness, his mind still remains clear and
lucid, and to sit with him and listen to his
reminiscences of the past, embellished with
anecdote and dramatic incident, and enhanced
by the genial, cordial hospitality of himself
and daughter in their beautiful home, is a rare
treat, and historically entertaining.
Among all of his contemporaries in the po
litical arena not an enemy exists, and there is
not one who has known him in all these years
who does not sincerely and heartily wish him
many continued years of life, comfort and
happiness. W. F. Swasky.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
POPULIST VANTAGE-GROUND.
United, Aggressive, Terribly ix Earnest,
Populists Win Their Way.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
Superficial observers have a ludicrously in
adequate conception of the supreme vantage
ground held by the Populists in the present
campaign, failing, as they do, to note and con
sider the radical change in the political condi
tions which give a unique character to the
great contest now at hand. Such observers
will smile derisively over the claim that Popu
lists will win their way in the struggle now
fairly begun. Perhaps it would be unkind to
destroy their illusions. This letter, however,
is written for men who look beneath the sur
face and are not won or led by exploding pow
der, brass bands and lurid lights. It is written
with the full knowledge that there are such
men in large numbers at this time.
Such men are beginning to become impressed
with the surprising growth of the People's
party and the notable victories it has won
under such inauspicious conditions, finding
these results thus achieved full of significance
as compared with the present situation.
Adullamites they might well be called four
short years ago; unorganized, almost total
strangers to each other, lamentably deficient
in leadership, not free from lurking distrust
where clear confidence is essential, they never
theless went to battle against two great
National parties, well organized, thoroughly
disciplinea, full of confidence, bound by party
fealty, inspired and commanded by great
leaders, supplied with ample campaign funds,
the united lions eager foT victory, and it is
little wonder that the poverty-stricken Popu
lists were despised ana ridiculed till their
votes were reluctantly counted.
It need not be written down here that all
this is now changed. United, aggressive, ter
ribly in earnest, with trusted leaders and con
fidence in each other, aroused by impending
dauger and growing poorer and more depend
ent by harder times and constantly augment
ing burdens aud hardships, their rights more
ruthlessly invaded and their liberties in peril,
these once despised Populists, greatly in
creased and constantly increasing in numbers,
are now arrayed against divided, demoralized
and spiritless foes who are contending with
disorder and mutiny in their own ranks, their
old leaders discredited or given over to bitter
contention with each other, and it will indeed
be a marvelous thing if these Cromwell reform
ers shall fail to achieve great and durable vic
tories at the ballot-box in November.
But there is a mighty stir abroad in the
land and great States are aroused to enthusi
asm and deeds of moral heroism in one grand
rally lor free coinage of silver, and these gath
ering hosts are coming up to the help of the |
Populists as their allies and co-workers
in the cause of liberty and prosperity
and it now appears that the Popu
lists are not to fight the great battles of
this campaign alone. With these two great
forces combined and united on the same can
didates, with separate and distinct but not an
tagonistic platforms, and with daily and rap
idly increasing desertions from the silver
ranks of the Republican party, with the cer
tainty of like desertion of such silver Demo
crats as place the welfare of the country above
party and know that they cannot trust the old
disintegrating and decrepit party of their
former allegiance, ft does begin to look as if a
union party is about to arise at the great con
ventions in St. Louis July 22 which will over
throw the merciless and oppressive money
power and bring liberty and prosperity to our
country.
I believe that such a union of forces will be
consummated at St. Louis, but not by the in
dorsement of any Democratic candidates, and
that the union will not require the surrender
by the Populists of any of their cherished prin
ciples, for it must be remembered that Popu
lists are no longer loaded with obloquy and
confronted with the blind prejudice and dense
ignorance of the former Presidential cam
paign. At last the country begins to under
stand what Populists propose to do, and multi
tudes are finding out with great surprise that
they, too, desire the same things done and will
"vote for a change."
Perhaps the reader would like a few of the
specific facts on which the foregoing declara
tions are based, not so much to deepen his
convictions as to satisfy his desire for informa
tion. One of the most significant indications
of a serious rupture in the Republican party is
the defection of the Detroit Tribune, a leading
paper of the Middle and Western States and
the most influential journal in Michigan.
In leaving the old party it has served so well
it pronounces the surrender of the National
Convention at St. Louis to the gold men as
"damnably unpatriotic and un-Kepublican,"
and exhorts all silver men to repudiate the
party and join the silver forces, but not the
Democratic forces at Chicago. This action of
the Tribune will be sustained by the silver
men and Populists of Michigan, which will
insure the electoral vote of that State for the
Silver-Populist union candidate, while its bold
and patriotic example will influence other
journsls of like character. The Philadelphia
Item (Republican) with an average daily cir
culation of 193,290, issue June SSI, referring
to the financial plank of the Republican plat
form, says: "Republicans are now expected to
vote for the very thing that has ruined Demo
cratic prospects. Is it any wonder that Sen
ator Teller and other friends of the people left
the convention? The chief wonder is that
there remained a man in it."
Indeed, coming nearer home, one may look
long and far to find such a superb example of
"damning with faint praise" as that of the
Sacramento Bee's editorial June 22 on "A
June-time Frost," designating the Republican
ratification meeting by these chilling words.
Space may be given for the first sentence:
"Not all the roar of cannon, nor all the
blandishments of a brass band, could work up
Sacramento to anything like enthusiasm over
the nomination of McKinley." All who still
feel an interest in the dying Democratic party
will mourn over the death-mask of its ap
proaching dissolution, seeu in the failure of
its New York convention to name Presidential
electors in order that the party may vote the
Republican ticket. Connecticut proposes to
take the same course if silver controls the
Chicago convention. Other Democratic gold
States will doubtless withdraw their Presi
dential electors and vote with the Repuplicans.
The burial of the Democray will take place
on election day in November.

SAYS ALEXANDER HAMILTON WAS
WISER THAT JEFFERSON
"Democracy and Liberty," a History of Our Ovv'rx Time
In his recent book, "Democracy and Lib
erty," Mr. Lecky, who establ^hed his fame as
a historian of the eighteenth century, has
undertaken an elaborate and exhaustive re
view of the political and social conditions of
our own time. The work has been carried out
on an extensive scale arui forms two octavo
volumes oi 000 pages esch. The number of
subjects treated is almos equal to the number
of factors and forces in modern life, and the
variety includes every tiding from the consti
tutions of nations to the minutiae of recent
legislation and the strength and the weak
nesses of the new woman.
The work is not ii tended as a mere descrip
tion of existing eruditions nor a formal sum
mary of contemporary developments. It is not
written in the c:eÂ«r, white light of impartial i
history. Mr. Leiky has a philosophy to pro
pound and a cause to uphold, and as a conse
quence every i of bis treatise is colored
by the light wiich radiates from his philoso
phy, and every event and tendency of the age
is exhibited under the aspect which most ac
cords with :he cause he has set up to defend.
This characteristic of the work must not be
regarded as a defect. Mr. Lecky' s philosophy I
is always well reasoned, and in his treat
ment ci them the facts of history, however he
may cJlor. them with lighter or darker shades,
are rever misrepresented. We may in fact re.
gÃrd the coloring and the philosophy as valu
abl qualities of the work, inasmuch as they
enable us to see how the developments of our
m dern life are regarded by one of the most
sudious, reflecting and penetrating intellects
ft the time.
One advantage resulting from giving the
wdkK the color of a particular cause and the
form of an argument for a particular creed is
that this mode of treating current events
arouses antagonism and provokes criticism.
Even the most indifferent reader will hardly
read this work with indifference. He will find
in every chapter and on almost every page j
something that will set his own ideas in mo
tion and make him a reflecting as well as an
interested reader. Whether he agrees or dis
agrees with tne writer, he will feel himself
moved by the book, as if it were a campaign
document. Indeed, in a broad sense of the j
phrase, it is a campaign document, and was
undoubtedly designed to influence the minds, {
and indirectly the votes, of men in the per- j
petual struggle going on in every civilized na- |
tion between democracy and all other forms j
Of government 'whatever.
Whenever a man says Alexander Hamilton j
was the greatest statesman and wisest thinker '
among those who founded our Republic and i
framed its constitution we know at once what I
his attitude is toward democracy and what he |
is going to say about the effects and the ten- \
dencies of universal suffrage. Mr. Lecky is a j
Hamiltouian. He says: "Hamilton, who was |
the greatest political thinker America has j
produced, was in the essentials of his political j
thought quite as conservative as Burke, but he i
never concealed his preference for monarch- \
ical institutions. Democratic government he :
believed must end in despotism, and be in the j
meantime destructive ot public morality and ;
to the security of private property." Whether j
this is a true statement or not of Hamilton's â 
political philosophy it is the conception Lecky [
has of it, and we can form a fair judgment of
Lecky's philosophy from the fact that with
this conception in his mind he considers Ham
ilton wiser than Jefferson.
A salient feature of the argument of the
book is the proposition put forward, with great
emphasis and wealth of illustration, that
governments cease to be "representative" ex
actly in proportion as they become popular.
He cites the conditions of politics and society
in many countries to prove this, but his chief !
illustration is drawn from our own country.
We have a nearer approach to absolute uni
versal suffrage than any other people, and
there is also, he says, a greater contrast be
tween our society and our government than
is to be found in any other nation. American
society, broadly speaking, is about the most
intelligent, the purest and most honest in the
world, but our politicians are tne most ignor
ant, the least honest and the most corrupt to
be found in any country that can be said to
have anything like an enlightened govern
ment.
By overlooking this feature of Lecky's argu
ment, John Morley, who is at once the most
eminent and most aggressive of his critics.
Jails into an obvious blunder. He points out
that Lecky shows in his book that the national
character of all civilized peoples is improving,
that the welfare of the poorer classes is more
abundantly provided for than ever, that men
tally, morally and physically, modern society
in Europe and America is belter than ever be
fore; and yet at the same time asserts that the
tone of politics has been lowered, the strength
of parliaments weakened and governments
everywhere conducted with iess honesty, less
firmness and less wisdom than in the days
which preceded universal suffrage.
Mr. Morley declares this to be "a tissue of
incoherence and inconsequence." The critic,
however, is wrong. So iar from being incon
sistent, the contrast between the improvements
guiug on in society at large and the deteriora
tion going on in parliamentary governments
is the strongest argument that could be pos
sibly urged In support of the theory that gov
ernments cease to represent the better and
improving elements of the social organism j
when they are composed of delegates elected J
by the majority, that vote being mainly com
posed of the worst and least improving class
oi people.
Starting then with the theory that govern
ment by universal suffrage is not a truly rep
resentative government Mr. Lecky reviews at
great length the tendencies of democratic gov
ernment in our time and finds that these are
everywhere adverse to the true liberty of the
citizen and the just rights of property. The
aggressions made on liberty and property have
as yet nowhere gone far enough to justify re
volt; but in one or two European countries
this is sufficiently imminent to occasion no
little anxiety. America he regards as virtually
safe from danger by reason of the wise pro
visions of our constitution which, in his judg
ment, are sufficient to prevent unjust laws
from being enacted or enforced so long as the
Supreme Court stands to declare unconstitu
tional any Jaw which violates the rights of
any class of citizens.
The admiration which Lecky has for our
constitution is not given to everything Ameri
can, nor is it our politicians only that come in
for condemnation. The American millionaire
as well as the mob is regarded as one of the
evils of the country and of the time. Mr.
Lecky says:
Of all forms that great wealth can take I know
of none that gives greater opportunities of or
temptations to abuse than that of tne railway king
who controls for his own selfish purposes the chief
lines of communication in the country. In no
other country has this class of men been so prorni
jieut as in America, and in no other has their
power been more hideously abused. Nowhere
else have there been such scandalous examples of
colossal, ostentations fortunes, built up by the
acquisition of gigantic monopolies, by a deadly
and unscrupulous competition, bringing ruin in:o
countless honu-s. by a systematic subordination of
public to privnr* interests, by enormous political
and municipal corruption.
These evils are certainly not unconnected with
political conditions, in a country where there is
no rank ana where political eminence gives litt â¢
or no dignity, the thirst for wealth acquires a
maddening power. Corrupt political organizations
come in constant contact with great railway and
industrial corporal ions and each can do much to
assist and to demoralize the other. Even inde
pendently of the.-it; mutual services there is an
analogy between the two things. To run a com
pany is very like running the machine, and the
low standard which public opinion aimUs in the
one is not unnaturally extended to the other.
Among the changes for wor-,e in parlia
mentary government brought about by the
extension of suffrage, Mr. Lecky notes the
change in the attitude of representatives
toward taxation and the public purse. The
old idea that the representative chamber is
pre-eminently a check n;>on extravagance, a
jealous guardian of the people's money,
seems, he says, to have almost vanished In
democratic countries; and he quotes approvÂ«
ingly the words of Leon Say that the modern
representative is hardly anything more than
"an agent for instigating expense." Esch
wishes to get an appropriation for his district,
and to enable an increasing number of his
constituents to secure a livelihood out of the
public taxes. Governments are thus led into
extravagance and wasteiulness of the national
resources, and corruptiou in official life in
variably follows.
Another feature of government by universal
suffrage, which is noted as already tending to
the danger point, is that of multiplying re
strictions upon various forms of human action.
This means an increase of bureaucracy, or in
other words, of the number and power of state
officials. It means also a constant increase of
taxation, which is itself a constant restriction
of liberty. One of the first forms of liberty,
Bays Mr. Lecky, is the right of every man to
dispose of his own property and earnings, and
if taxes are multiplied for the purpose of
carrying out a crowd of objects in which he
has no interest, and with many of which he
has no sympathy, his liberty is proportionately
restricted.
Speaking generally of democracy and liberty,
Mr. Lecky says:
To place the chief power In the most Ignorant
classes is to place it in the hands of those who
naturally care least for political liberty and who
are most likely to follow with devotion some
stroug leader. The sentiment of nationality
penetrates very deeply into all classes, but in all
countries and ages it is the upper and middle
classes who have chiefly valued constitutional
liberty, and those classes it is the work of
democracy to dethrone. At the same time
democracy does much to weaken among them
also the love of liberty. The instability and in
security of democratic politics, the spectacle of
dishonest and predatory adventurers climb
ing by popular suffrage into positions of
great power in the state, the alarm
wfcich attacks on property seldom fall
to produce among those who have something to
lose, may easily scare to the side of despotism
larve classes who under other circumstances would
have been steady supporters of liberty. A despot
ism which secures order, property and Industry,
which leaves the liberty of religion and private
life unimpaired, and which enables quiet and in
dustrious men to pass through life untroubled and
unmolested, will always appear to many very
preferable to a democratic republic which is con
stantly menacing, disturbing or plundering them.
Mr. Lecky is not v.-hat is generally known as
a pessimist. He has faith in society. He sees
that it is continually improving and he has
confidence that these improvements will grow
from more to more. In his judgment, how
ever, under government by universal suffrage
these imDrovements must be made not
through the government, but in spite of it.
Little by little the chasm will widen between
the real governing element of the community
and the politicians, until at last parliaments
will no longer be regarded as the true repre
sentative of the nation. He does not despair
of what will happen then, nor does he believe
that despotism or anarchy are the only pos
sible outcome. He suggests a remedy for
England, at any rate, and strangely enough it
is a limited form of the referendum. He would
allow an appeal to society at large in order
to save society from the representatives of its
lower elements. [For sale by Doxey; price $5.]

A Connecticut Yankee in King Ar

The publication of a new library edition of
Mark Twain's clever story, "A Connecticut j
Yankee iv King Arthur's Court," affords the |
American public a first-class antidote for the
excitements and passions of the political cam
paign to those who stay in town, and for the
dullness and inanities of summer re
sort life to those who go into the
country. The work is one of the best
of Twain's later books, both in concep- â¢
tion and in execution, and even those who
read it when first published can find enjoy
ment in rereading it in this attractive new
edition, which is enriched with a photogravure
portrait of the author and many other illustra

The story, while written in a strain of humor
so broad as to be farcical, has none the less an
under-current of truth running through it j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
MARIGOLD LANE
I KNOW of a street on the edge of the town
Where blithely the sunshine of spring-time looks down
And lilacs lean over, all purple and white,
To make for the passing a path of delight â
Though Fashion ignores with profoundest disdain
The very existence of Marigold Lane.
So dreaming and hoping, I'm biding the day
When 'round flies the news that there's raising of pay;
And then in the gloaming when Nellie and I,
Arm over, arm under, go loitering by â
It may be the sign will not hang out in vain
On the cottage I covet in Marigold Lane.
that renders it almost as instructive as amus
ing. Hank Morgan, a Connecticut machinist
and inventor, with all the knowledge of the f
nineteenth century and with the mechanical j
ability to construct all kinds of modern
mechanism, finds himself suddenly trans
ferred to England in the days when King Ar
thur ruled at Camelot and led the Knights of â 
the Round Table in feats of chivalry.
The contrast between the conditions of life !
in those days and in our own is strongly â 
brought out, and in the descriptions of those I
contrasts Twain finds abundant opportunities :
for serious writing as well as for humorous j
extravagance. To most readers the serious :
passages will be found fully as entertaining as j
those which were designed to be funny. In
fact, the fun is more like that of a farce
than that of a comedy, and not in
frequently seems strained and overdone.
Still, as a rule, the most grotesque absurdities
pass as excellent fooling when the mind is in
the humor tor them, and if there is any man j
living who can put the public mind into that
humor Mark Twain is the one to do it.
The first impression of the Connecticut man
on his arrival at Camelot is one of disgust for |
the whole concern. Circumstances force him.
to assume the role of a magician in order to !
save his life, and by predicting an eclipse he j
wins such success as to completely discredit j
Merlin at court and become the chief Counselor
of the King. Raised to power and distressed j
by the wretchedness of the people, and exas- \
perated by the folly and the superstition of the â 
nobility, he sets himself to the task of civil
izing the people with the intention of reform- I
ing the country and establishing a repuolic.
The story proceeds upon the broadest lines
The following remarkable verses, bold in metaphor, deep and mystical in meaning, jagged
and uneven in rhetorical properties, are written by a protege of Joaquln Miller, a young Jap
anese who works and thinks on Miller's ranch. They are reprinted from the Lark, the editor
of which, Gillette Burgess, thus describes their author:
"I would have you think of him as I know him, alone on the heights, in his Cabin â 'even
yellow-jackets abandoned Iâlistening1 â listening to the 'tireless songs of the crickets on the lean, gray
haired hill, in the sober-faced evening.'
"An exile from his native land, a stranger in a new civilizationâ a mystic by temperament,
race and religion."

Without hesitation, they kill themselves in an instant on
the earth, lifting their single-noted chants â o tragedy !â
chants? Nay, the clapping sound of earth-lips.

Mr. Allen takes occasion, in a somewhat
lengthy preface, to criticize the decadent lit

in no uncertain terms, the morbid suggestive- i

recently appeared. "We know too well," says
Mr. Allen, "what exposures of the eternally

Of songs that my heart sings in Marigold Lane.
In fancy sometimes at the window I see
Her curly head nodding a welcome to me,
And sometimes at twilight she stands by the gate,
Half-hid by the shadows, to listen and wait
For footsteps she loves â Ah, the castles in Spain

grovel in the mud ior its ideals.
"Summer in Arcady" is, as we have said, a
pastoral. It treats of the love of Daphne, a
farmer's daughter, for Hilary, a farmer's son.
The book closes with the marriage of the two
against the wish of Daphne's father, whose
main objection to the union appears to be the
fact that Hilary once indulged in the sinful
pastime of dancing. It is a simple story, but
told in a manner that holds the reader's atten
tion from the first page to the last. [New

ANOTHER EROTIC
NOVEL BY ELLA WHEELER WILCOX
"AN AMBITIOUS MAN"
"Lindsay's Qirl," b\j J^irs Herbert Martirv
Ella Wheeler Wilcoz has undertaken a char
acter study under the guise of a novel, but
character study alone cannot very well carry a
story that is positively lacking in vivid inter
est. "An Ambitious Man," it may be said, is
an endeavor in prose to maintain that attitude
of eroticism exhibited in Ella's "Poems of Pas
sion," published a few years ago. The ex
ploitation of amorous sins and blunders seems
to be to the liking of Mrs. Wilcox. Her novel
ends in chaos, and the lot of everybody in it
is untimely death or lingering misery. And
yet Mrs. Wilcox writes well ; better, in fact,
than many who write better stories. Here are
a few sentences from the book of "Impres
sions," in which one of her characters makes
daily entrances which reflect the changes
that take place in the complexion of her
mind:
People talk about following a divine law of love,
when they wish to excuse their brute impulses
and break social and civil codes.
No love is sanctioned by God which shatters
human hearts.
Fathers are only distantly related to their chil
dren: love for the male parent Is a matter of edu
cation.
Love Is a mushroom, and lust is Its poisonous
counterpart.
It is a ptiy that people who despise civilization
should be so uncivil as to stay in it. There is
always darkest Africa.
The extent of a man's gallantry depends on the
goal. He follows the good woman to the borders
of Paradise and leaves her with a polite bow; but
he follows the bad woman to the depths of hell.
An envious woman is a spark from purgatory.
When the fruit must apologize for the tree, we
do not care to save the seed.
It Is only when God and man have formed a
syndicate and agreed upon their laws that mar
riage is a safe inves ment.
When we say of people what we would not say to
them, we are either liars or cowards.
The enmity of some people Is the greatest com
plimrnt they can pay us.

Lindsay's Girl.
Here is another fresh novel for the girls by
the seaside or in the mountain resorts. Its
author is Mrs. Herbert Martin and its heroine
is a Scotchman's daughter, Valentine Lindsay, j
who is a little wild in her ways and creates
talk among the gossips. Fate throws Lord St.
George and Valentine together and they marry
against the wishes of the man's noble family.
The country place is dull and the couple take
up Quarters in London, where Valentine
dances and enjoys herself more than she ever
did in her unmarried days. The lord goes back
to hiÂ« bachelor pleasures. Valentine is much
sought after by an old lover, and their com
panionship arouses more talk. A coldness
growl between lord and lady. They quit the
dissipations of London, and on their arrival in
the country an accident happens to St. George.
He lies for weeks on the brink of death, and
then it is that the wife finds her abiding love
for him. St. George recovers as if by a miracle,
and after that they are the happiest couole in
England. In fact, Lady St. George became
such an exceptionally ideal wife ana adorable
mother and such an esteemed member of the
highest society that people who knew some of
the old tales shook their heads and exclaimed,
"Who would have ever expected it of that girl
ol Lindsay's?" [New York: R. T. Fenno & Co.,

The Victory of Ez"a Gardner.
Miss Imoeen Clark has given us a charming
idyl, the scene of wnich is laid in one of New
England's quaint islands. Ezra Gardner is a
finely drawn character. His only companion
and friend is his pet pony, "Baby," and the
affection between the two is touchingly por
trayed. Ezra has suffered with humility the
scorn of the world ever since the war. It was in
war time that he got the name of being a cow
ard, and he admitted that he was afraid of
going to the front, and that when be went he
was "choked up with the fear through every
thing." But when Ezra Gardner braved a
monstrous sea while others stood appalled and
whiteâ when Ezra Gardner saved from death a
"college professor" in spite of tremendous
1 odds of death against life, battling like a giant
with the awful breakers, but holding up the
drowning man with a strength like iron, when
I the twain were pulled ashore unconscious,
after a struggle that for heroism was never
surpassedâ then came "The Victory of Ezra
Gardner." All the island was proud to honor
him, and everywhere he was received with ex
pressions of kindness, admiration and love.
The rescue scene is highly dramatic, ana the
volume is replete with pictures of unaffected j
realism. [New York and Boston: T. Y. !

Magaznes for July.
hakper's.
The July number of Harper's Magazine opens
with a paper on General Washington and the j
period of the Revolution, by Wooclrow Wilson. ,
Rarely has a historic personage been made so |
real and human as Washington here appears,
in camp and on the battlefield no less than in
the Virptinia House of Burgesses or at his
Mount Vernon plantation. In commemora- !
tion of the centenary of the settlement of j
Cleveland the number contains an illustrated |
paper on the distinctive characteristics of i
Ohio, as shown in the development of the
State, by President Charles F. Thwing of the
Western Reserve University. A piquant
description of English elections, by Hon.
Henry Cabot Lodge, gives the result of some |
personal observations in England last sum- !
mer. showing that the United States is not J
alone in its need of political reforms. Laurence
Hutton will contribute an attractive article
on "Literary Landmarks of Venice," with
illustrations by Frank V. Dv Mond, including
the houses in which Byron, Browning and Pe
trarch lived. There is presented the opening
chapters of "Two Mormons From Muddlety," a
three-part novelette, by Langdon Elwyn
Mitchell, whose scene is laid among the West
Virginia hills and whose characters are the
rude population of a primitive community,
enlivened by the visits of two Latter-Day
Saints engaged in proselyting. The story will
be illustrated by Gilbert Gaul.
John Kendrick Bangs' humorous romance,
"A Rebellious Heroine," is concluded. Archi
bald Lampraan contributes an essay on "Hap
piness," and Charles Dudley Warner in the
Editor's Study discusses a popular belief that
everybody is an undeveloped author. The
Editor's Drawer opens with an amusing lecture
by Kate Douglas Wiggin on a supposedly new
Wagnerian opera, with examples of the music.
LIPPINCOTT'B.
The complete novel in the July issue of Lip- j
pincott's is "A Judicial Error" by Marion j
Manvilie Pope. It is a strong story based on a
murder for which the wrong man was con
victed and hanged. He has a friend who de
termines to prove his innocence and does it.
"A Twenty-Doliar Bill," by Algernon Tassin,
is a pathetic tale of honesty among the very
poor and in the face of the strongest possible
temptationâ to save a sister's life. Giilam W. !
Ford tells about '"The Rector's Game- j
cock," which came to the minister in
a singular way and was thenceforth j
a bird of peace. Jean Wright relates
briefly "An Old Story"â which is not a
familiar or commonplace one at allâ of the
army. A Russian, who for various reasons with
holds his name, writes forcibly on the "Decad
ence of Modern Russian Literature." His array
of facts shows clearly the benumbing effect of
despotism when vigorously exercised through
a censorship of the press. "Pennsylvania and
Her Public Men," by Sydney G. Fisher, is an
other startling article, presenting facts which,
though common property, are enough to set
one thinking. "My Rural Experiences" is one
of the last papers which the lamented Profes
sor Boyeson wrote, and one of the best. He
loved his summer home on Long Island,
reveled in his peaceful vacations there, and
enjoyed to the full his communion with
Nature, escaping from the man-made town.
John Sheridan Zelie supplies a little essay, "On
Being Fond of One's Thoughts." "With the
Trade" instances some of the unadvised efforts,
requests and woes of beginners in literature.
The poetry of the number is by Florence Earle
Coates, Margaret Gilman George, Jenny TerriU
Ruprecht and Grace F. Pennypacker.
m'clube's.
In the opening paper in McClure's Magazine
for July E. Kay Robinson, with whom Kip
iing was intimately associated in the editor
ship of a newspaper in India, gives a wealth of
interesting personal facts about Rudyard Kip
ling. But perhaps surpassing this in abundance
of new personal detail is a paper of recollec
tions of Longfellow, Whittier and Holmes, by
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. Wnittier was, in his
lust years, much oppressed by loneliness; and
Holmes, outwardly so merry a man, was at
heart grave almost to melancholy. Both
papers are fully illustrated with por
traits and other pictures ; and, form
ing an independent article, is a comprehensive
series of portraits of Longfellow. A woman's
account of her own experience in climbing to
the very top of the Matterhornâ a feat which
very few women have proved equal to; an
illustrated article by Cleveland Moffett, indi
cating the revolution that is already beginning
to be wrought in truvel, trcffia and war by the
horseless carriage; a paper of reminiscences
and anecdotes from personal associates of
Abraham Lincoln at the bar, showing Lincoln's
1 ife and methods as a lawyer; and a paper by
W. H. Low on the present state of painting in
Germany, with reproductions of recent cele
brated German paintingsâ are other note
worthy features.
GODEY'S.
Godey's Magazine for July begins the one
hundred and thirty-third volume of the well
known publication and is a good specimen of
the pioneer in modern form. The initial
article is from the pen of a traveler in Persia,
and describes; with the aid of numerous pic
tures, some of the characteristics of that
country, which is always an important factor
in the Eastern question, and has recently
come into particular promirence on account
of the assassination of tne Shah ; while no less
interesting is a description of the training
and the life in the New York Fire Department.
There are continuations of the reminiscences
of operatic singers by Albert L. Parkes, and
the critical series of "Music in America" by
Rupert Hughes, the subject of the latter being
"The Manuscript Society and Its President,
Gerrit Smith." That Godey's has not lost its
individuality as a lady's book is shown by the
articles on "The Silk Industry of Japan" and
"Elizabeth Cady Stanton," number VII of
"TalKs by Successful Women," and the usual
fashion department.
SCRIBNER'B.
The July number of Scribner's is one of un
usual excellence. The place of honor is ac
corded to an article by Julian Ralph on Coney
Island, which is a peculiar New York product.
Mr. Ralph cails i; "our sunbath and icebox
combined, our ex era lung, our private, gigan
tic fan." He sketches its development irom
the early seventies down to its present com
plex and impressive charmsâ a resort which
8,000,000 people have visited in one year.
Brander Matthews also shows a picturesque
American element for the use of the literary
man in his discussion "On the Poetry of Place
Names." He quotes the criticism of Matthew
Arnold on the ugliness of our place names, and
the entirely opposite opinion expressed by
Robert Louis Stevenson that "there is no part
of the wor d where nomenclature is so rich,
poetical, humorous, and picturesque as the
United States of America."
In fiction this number is made notable by
one of the last short stories of the late H. H.
Boyesen, entitled, "In Collusion With Fate."
It is the charming love story of an ocean voy
age. There is also a short story of the Ameri
can Revolution, by Clinton Ross, entitled "The
Confession of Colonel Sylvester." Mr. Ross
has made a study of '-his period for purposes
ot fiction. Among the other articles are: "A
Thousand Miles Through the Alps," by Sir W.
Martin Conwuy; "Sentimental Tommyâ The
Story of His Boyhood," by J. M. Barrie; "Ars
et Vita," by T. R. Sullivan; "A New Art," by
J. Carter Beard, with illustrations of the work
of American taxidermists from drawings by
the author; some portraits of J. M. W. Turner;
and "A French Friend of Browningâ Joseph
Milsand, by Th. Bentzon (Mme. Blanc).
Among the poetry isabitof verse by Charles
Edwin Markham, entitled "The Hidden Val
ley." The various departments are as com
plete and interesting as usual.
BT. NICHOLAS.
Calif ornians have frequently read In Thb
Call notices of the remarkable traveling dog
"Owney," the pet of the United States Postal
Department. A description of "Owney's" trip
around the world by Charles Frederick Holder
of Pasadena is publishad in the July number
of St. Nicholas, and a right good narrative it
makes. "Owney" has more medals than a
modern rifle expert or a bicycle champion of
the amateur class. Charles Henry Webb speaks
in verse "A Few Words For the Old Fourth."
suggesting what so many of us have been
thinking, namely, that the drums used to
sound louder and that firecrackers had a more
vicious snap in the days gone by. Boys of the
present will have similar views of the current
events twenty years liencu. "Toby Hinkle,
Patriot" is a story apropros of the month. The
articles in St. Nicholas are artistically illus
trated.
LADIES' HOME JOURNAL.
Mark Twain's "Personal Recollections of
Joan of Arc" may not prove a success from a
business standpoint, but the volume has at
least aroused renewed interest in the marvelous
Maid of Orleans, the Ladies' Home Journal for
July devoting two pases to that heroine's his
tory. The text is by Emma Asbrand Hopkins.
John Gilmer Speed has a dull article on "Feed
ing a City Like New York." The subject is un
interesting except to readers of market re
ports and the like. Ex-President .Benjamin
Harrison continues his essays on the working!
of our National Government. "The Wife of
Ben Bow" is a strong psychological sketch by
Hezekiah Butterworth. Arthur Warren de
votes a chapter to the beautiful side of the
character of Robert Burns, the Ayrshire poet,
whose fame grows and mellows with the yean.
LITERARY NOTES.
Ex-President Harrison will discuss our Na
tional finances in an article on "The Secretary
of the Treasury" which will appear in the
August issue of The Ladies' Home Journal.
He will tell briefly of the origin of our finan
cial system; its expansion or development;
how the Nation raises its revenues and dis
burses its moneys, and detail the faults of our
system of financiering.
"The Landlord at Lion's Head," a new novel
by W. D. Howelis, will be begun in the issue of
Harper's Weekly dated July 4. Illustrations
for this story have been made by W. T. Smedley.
In Harper's Round Table, published June 28,
an article appears by W. J. Henderson, en
titled "Blind-man's Buff at Sea." Mr. Hender
son describes the difficulties and the methods
of ascer taiuing positions at sea during foggy
weather. In the same number is an excellent
story by James Barnes, entitled "The Hidden
Treasure of King Oban," and the second part
of a humorous story by R. K. Munkittrick,
entitled "SlambangHree." "A Virginia Cava
lier," the new serial by Molly Elliott Seawell,
grows more interesting.
The Outlook's seventh annual recreation
number contains nearly a hundred pages and
scores of illustrations. Nearly all of the
special articles relate to outdoor life, sport,
recreation and vacation possibilities. Among
the writers are lan Muclaren, the Rev. Dr.
Henry Van Dyke, the Rev. Dr. Charles H.
Parkhurst, Kirk Monroe, General A. W. Greely,
Poultney Bigelow, and many others.
Mr. Gladstone has suspended for a while his
philosophical studies, in order to give to the
public in greater detail, through the Nine
teenth Century, what he has stated privately
about Fraser Rao's biography of Sheridan and
about Sheridan himself, *n whom he hat al
ways taken a keen interest.

THE SALON
IN THE CHAMPS
AKYSEES
Odd Titles of French
Pictures
"Woman to the Fire," "In the
Park of Oysters" and the
"Brush PoWder" â The
Old Salon
PARIS, Fbascx. June 10.â There are
902 numbers in the catalogue of the old
salon of the Champs Elysees; there are
1794 paintings alone in the new salon.
The amount of work done is appalling,
especially when we take into account the
fact that these two exhibitions are re- j
peated yearly and that the same picture
or sculpture can be exhibited but once.
This year we have a general exhibition in
Berlin; in Vienna, in Prague, in Munich j
large and important picture shows. Add j
to these the paintings at Burlington
House, at the new and the Graf ton gal
leries, and the imagination refuses to go ;
further abroad.
What becomes of all the pictures! I i
have wandered between miles of land
scape peopled with strange allegorical or
mythological figures; the portraits of !
celebrities that stared blankly from under i
ponderous gold frames would have made '
the fortune of a dealer in wax works. And i
still the landscapes continue to unfold j
their purple and green, or gray and dun,
or brown and yellow charms, and still the i
inanimate figures frown violently, or smile !
insipidly.
The art of to-day is a colossal experi- |
went, and originality is the aim of the j
whole painting world. Originality at all !
costs, even if it be eccentricity or flagrant j
vulgarity hardly disguised. If the techni
cal gymnastic? which distinguish so many !
pictures exhaust and bewilder the artist,
the sincere and tireless student, in what
â unenviable frame of mind must they i
leave the art amateur, the amiably cul- !
tured traveler with a thirst for knowledge
and a desire to express pleasure about the
right things?
"Blank,' he asks of one artist, "Blank
is undoubtedly a great painter?"
"Blank," says Blank's disciple, "is the
coming man. What power, what deli
cacy, what a marvelous way of hiding
his technique under a form of complete
naivete or by means of this marvelous
light, which is so bright that nothing is
visible !" and so on, with praise and care
ful dissection of transcendent merits ad
nauseam.
"And so Blank is your coming man?"
says the honest traveler to a painter of
another school.
"Coming!" he replies. "You mean eo
ing! Why all that trickery he practices
is not art â in medicine you call a man
who experiments on his patients a quack.
1 think an artist who experiments on the
public fully as much of a charlatan. And
that is what Blank is. He paints a pic
ture, then rubs it all off with his coat
sleeve and calls it a nocturne. Only one
man ever could paint a nocturne!"
"Whistler?" demands the humbled and
patient listener, making a note of the re
mare for future use.
"No, Chopin!" and he plunges his
hands into the pockets of his velveteen
coat and congratulates himself on the
neat annihilation he has accomplished.
In the Champ de Mars we have every
form of Monets and Whistlerites â impres
sionism and unimpressionism, a return to
the Byzantine or early Florentine ideal in
cadaverous shapes of unearthly pallor, in
which even the cathode ray could not dis
cover a trace of human anatomy â but
we have them all well hung, with
Epace between each picture, and
no sacrifice of one artist to
another. In the Champs Elysees the
frames are almost dovetailed ; the hanging
Beems indiscriminate, a delicate little
Btudy dependent entirely upon a quiet and
normal light, painted for values and a care
fnl regard for half tones is extinguished,
absolutely put out of existence by the can
vas above or beneath or beside it, which
may be a symphony in white paint with
faint blue and pink streaks and most reck
less abandon in the prosaic questions of
well-modeled earth and the preservation
of certain scales of distance.
If in the Champs Elysees we see the good
end the bad of the old school and not a
little of the new; in the Champ de Mars
we see even worse and even better work â
and with the distinct advantage of the
most intelligent arrangement. In discuss
ing an exhibition or two exhibitions of
such enormous proportions, a criticism
must be merely a selection and a compari
son. It must be at once personal and
generous, or it degenerates into an enu
meration of Dictures and sculptures al
most as entertaining as the catalogue it
self.
The comparison of the illustrated cata
logue is not flattering to the old salon.
The reproductions are suiprisingly poor,
and in turning the leaves the choice of
pictures seems remarkable chiefly for a
pecyiiiar in appropriateness. A picture in
which color is the predominant quality is
reproduced in a line, and vice versa. The
catalogue is hopelessly commonplace and
entirely without interest.
The Champ de Mars uses a photo
graphic process, in which delicate values
are frequently sacrificed, but, as a whole,
is as satisfactory as cheap reproductions
can ever be, and in turning the pages
there is at least a suggestion to spur the
treacherous memory or to awaken the de
sire to see. In one question alone there is
room for great improvement. It seems
Impossible in this enlightened age that
such translations of titles can be printed.
They add not a little unexpected enter
;ainment. Hero are a few examples for
:he delectation of those who have not yet
itudied this new language:
Le Pavilion de Floreâ The Flag of Flore.
Femme gui se chauffeeâ Woman to the
ire.
Marchandea de pots â Pot's trades
women.
Jeune fille en blancâ Young girl in
right.
Idealâ Country.
La Pensee gui s'eveilleâ The thought
twakening.
Jeune Baigneuse â Young batting eirl.
La Houpe â The brush-powder.
Dans les pares aux huitresâ ln the park
if oysters.
In walking through the great rooms of
he Palace of Industry, or the equally
lignified halls of the newer exhibition,
here is more than a suggestion of mo
notony in the long rows of square or ob
long canvases. The thrill of delight with
which we come suddenly upon a work of a
master, or catch a glimpse, at some dis
tance, of two or three remarkable portraits
âthese pleasant experiences are rare.
The work that will excite the most in
terest is undoubtedly that of the president
of the National Society of the Beaux Arts,
Puvis de Chavannes â five panels for the
decoration of the public library at Boston.
Puvis de Chavannes has metamorphosed
the decorative art of the century and his
late labors only add to and complete all
that he has hitherto accomplished. The
simple and candid methods employed by
Puvis de Chavannes make the decorations
of less talented men seem oily and thick â
paint, paint, paint!
"The Chaldean Shepherds Observing the
Movements of the Planets" is exactly
what the title expresses. Chaldean shep
herds of a primitive age, expressing with
the greatest simplicity of movement and
Portrait by Jean Boldini.
gesture, surprise and delight at a discovery
which was of moment enough to have
given rise to a greater extravagance of ex
pression.
The Eschylus and the Oceanides is the
most successful of all, not only from the
popular standpoint of being more easily
understood, but for the singular beauty of
color and line. How magnificently this
great sky, so bright and so soft, will till
the panel to which it is destined, and the
figure of Eschylu?, that suggests a passion
ate face sternly subdued, has an almost
monumental grandeur. And around the
sublime sufferer the peace of this trans
figured landscape! It may not be true to
an actual comparison of a Greek country,
but it is the landscape of a student of
mythology, large and serene, where the
gods may descend and walk.
A picture that has been the subject of
more discussion, is Dagnau Bouveret's
"Last Supper." Critics cannot agree; ac
cording to some, it is a marvelâ according
to others, it is a pity that M. Dagnau
Bouveret should depart from his old tra
ditions. The picture is very large, the
figures are placed with that regard to the
conventions that Leonardo and Raphael
have made simply a question of respectful
deference. The light streams through
something that has turned it golden, it is
not a radiance from within.
The composition is a little cold for a
Portrait of the Dancer, Otero, by William T. Dannat.
picture that is not intended for a decora
tion, and the figures are painted with a
suggestion of having been carefully placed
and posed. The pale heads have all the
delicate brushwork Dagnau Bouveret alone
is the master of. The figure of Christ,
with the long ray of light denning it, the
radiance around the finely drawa head,
that is of a tragic pallor but seems part of
the whole harmony of gold and white, is
slightly but unavoidably theatrical. The
figures of the disciples have a certain
statuesque rigidity of form and drapery
that adds not a little to the general im
| preseion that the entire company of guests
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
have arrived at the request of the painter.
Of the French painters M. Vidal has a
most charming study â a woman with
beautiful eyes, in a simple attitude, her
remarkably well drawn hands crossed in
her lap. Everything M. Vidal exhibits is
distinguished by the same almost caress
ing use of the orusb, the profile in clear,
light shadow, the figure of the woman
stretching her blowing linen' on the line,
how careful and yet how free, how the air
blows about the figure of the woman, who
has a look of impatience, as though, when
her work is ended, she will leave the can
vas at once.
Carolus Duran has a number of por
traits. It has become almost a duty for
young painters to shake their lira is and
look melancholy when speaking of Carolus
Duran. "How have the mighty fallen!"
they seem to say.
However much he may have fallen, he
is still at an elevation to which few of his
critics will be able to climb.
The portrait of "Simone," the little
granddaughter of Mme. Sara Bernhardt,
is distinguished enough to give decided
pleasure. The child has a little dark face,
around which the hair, that is so black
and lustrous, hanes closely. She sways
forward in her gold-brocaded, unchildish
gown with a most childlike air ol solem
nity and importance.
And yet, the background is no back
eround at all, only grayish, brown paint.
The shadows are brown spots and the head
is slightly out of drawing and only re
deemed by the richness of the color and
the quaint beauty of the subject. In spite
of all this the portrait is a fine picturesque
rendition of a charming child.
The little Helene is even more delicate
and more carefully observed. She has
big, clear eyes and a little scarlet mouth
and an almost Venetian color in this small
three-year-old baby.
The portrait of M. Leygues, ex- Minister,
is broadly managed and painted with so
much spirit that it makes the full length
convention of the woman in white satin as
lifeless as a doll.
M. Roll has an unfinished portrait of
Dumas. The portrait was not interrupted
by the death of the author of so many
plays, but is a living monument of the
vanity of greatness. It is painted as M.
Roll will paint, with absolute, if somewhat
brutal, frankness. The big coarse head,
somewhat Jewish in type and still strongly
suggestive of thÂ« halfbreed physiognomy,
the big loose clothes hanjring on the cor
pulent figure, all this was too much for
M. Dumas, who considered it too much
in "the dressing gown and slipper style."
He refused to sit lonsrer on the plea that
"an academician should not be intro
duced to the public in such deshabille."
Ot the work of Boldini and Bernard
and Armand Poiret and Gervex and the
landscapists of the American and English
and Scotch schools it will be necessary to
speak in another article.

which made the 'Oliver Optic" books and
magazines so welcome to boys, girls and ,
grown people in many lands.
He introduces the story of the trip by
saying: "I have visited every country in
Europe, from Ireland to Kazan, in Russia,
and from Norway and Sweden to the
southern part of Italy, and I have been to
about all the islands of the West Indies.
I have been in all the States of my own
country except nine, though I have not
traveled all over them. I have been
through the Dominion of Canada, from
New Brunswick to its western boundary,
in Lake Superior. It seemed to me time
to go around the world. My friends re
monstrated with me, principally because I
intended to go alone; but their protests
were not vigorous â were rather mild. They
thought I was too old to go alone, but 1
insisted that I was some months short of
74, and was as able as ever to take care of
myself. The objections were withdrawn.
"I went to the office of Messrs. Henry
Gaze & Sons, in charge of \V. H. Eaves,
for my tickets for the entire trip from
Boston to Boston. I paid for them $620,
including only steamer and railway fares,
though I was 'found' on all the steamers,
which included the greater part of the
trip. I paid for my sleepers and for my
board at the hotels, fees on the steamers,
jinrickishas, guide, carriages in Colombo,
Gibraltar and London $541, making the
total expenses $1161.
"Thus armed with pasteboards for the
trip I left Boston December 14, for Chi
cago, and at 6 o'clock for Minneapolis,
where I intended to spend what time I
could with my son-in-law (Sol Smith Rus
sell), daughter and two grandchildren.
* * â¢ We made a very jolly Christmas
of it, and the head of the family escorted
me to the station of the Northwestern ,
Railroad and saw me comfortably in
stalled in the sleeper lor San Francisco."
Impressions of San Francisco are thus
recorded in the brochure:
"If there is any better hotel in San
Francisco than the Baldwin, 1 don't know
which it is. With a gentleman from To
ronto, whose acquaintance I had made
on the train and found to be a pleasant
companion, we were shown to a suite of :
rooms on a principal street, ap one flight,
having two large sleeping apartments, a
parlor and bathroom. We were charged j
four dollars a day each. The table was i
excellent and I greatly enjoyed the hotel.
J. walked about the streets of the City. It
looked like a busy place, and has many I
elegant buildings.
"On Monday I toon a carriage and rode
over some of it with my room-mate, James
E. Walker. After exchanging my order
for a ticket to Yokohama we visited the j
China, the largest and finest of the Pacific i
Mail line, in which my passage was en- I
gaged. I was somewhat surprised wtfen j
we came to her to see on her stern that 'â 
she bailed from Glasgow, for I had sup- !
posed that all the ships of this line, like
the City of Peking, in which I had once
sailed from Boston to New YorK, were
built in the United States. * â¦ â¢ She
looked like a solid vessel and one that
would be entirely at home in a heavy sea,
and this ability is vastly better than gin
gerbread work in the cabins.
"In the train I had the pleasure of meet
ing Harry Francis, and his kind offices
gave me the entree of the Bohemian Club,
which I visited. Its apartments were spa
cious and elegant, with nothing gaudy
about them, and its large library indi
cated that it had been selected by men
who knew books. I was received in the
most genial and cordial manner by two of
the members, though I am sorry that I
have lost their names. I met there Hugh
M. Burke of The Call. I was also very
fortunate in meeting Dr. Beach, the sur
geon of the China. I had a very pleasant
visit, though I am afraid I did not fully
comprehend the 'high' jinks' and the
"low jinks" which are so peculiar to the
Bohemian Club.
"Another day was spent in walking and ;
riding about the City; and I went aboard j
the China after luncheon, December 31, !
and sailed at 3 o'clock. At first as the
itMUMI sailed down the bay I had enough
to do to observe this noted sheet of water.
I recognized some of the points and
places of which I had read. As the ship
went out to sea I repaired to my state
room, where I found my little Japanese
steward putting things to right. He had
turned up and secured the upper berth, so
that I had no excuse for bumping my
head against it. The electric light was
so placed that I could read after I had
'turned in,' as lam in the habit of doing.
I found an excellent and well-selected
library in the warm cabin of which I
made use during the voyage.
"The number of passengers was small.
I made the acquaintance of most of them,
and found them very pleasant people.
Five ladies were missionaries, one of
them being a doctor from Portland, Or.
Captain Seabury was a high-toned gentle
man, always pleasant, and I considered
him a model sea-captain. I became quite
intimate with J. W. Saunders, the first
officer, with whom I spent pleasant hours.
"The Weather the first two days of the
voyage was mild and pleasant, with very
little wind. Then came a savage gale
which had hardly moderated before an
other came. We had what the first officer
called 'cross-seas,' and the ship pitched,
rolled and twisted, and it was not an easy
matter to stay in one's berth at night or
on the sofa during the day. But I have
been in gales less tortuous than those on
the Pacific, and have been wrenched and
twisted vastly more than at any time on
board of the China. I regarded her as
one of the ablest ships in which I ever
sailed, and I have crossed the Atlantic
twenty one times."
"On the wharf at Yokohama I obtained
my first view of a jinrickisha, and I
thought it must be a very nice vehicle, but
I changed my opinion in the course of a
week. I went in one of them to the Grand
Hotel, and the charge for it was 10 cents â
Japanese sen.
"The value in our money of a yen and
its decimal parts is an unknown quantity
depending upon the rate of exchange and
the worth of Mexican dollars silver.
Reckoning from the amount I received
in yen on my letter of credit one yen
equals 55 cents in American money. lam
aware that this estimate differs widely
from what is written in ?ome of the books,
but the value of silver has depreciat"d in
the East nearly half. The value of a rupee
in India is nominally two shillings, but
when I was there it was quoted at one
shilling and a quarter of a penny."
Mention is made of visits to Tokio,
Kobe and of the voyage to Shanghai,
Hongkong and Singapore. The hot
weather as the ship neared Singapore
produced the greatest discomfort of the

voyage around the world. British gold
was needed at Singapore and Oliver Optic
had a time of his own in finding the
banker. "My rickshaw man said he could
speak English, but any decently educated
parrot could outdo him in the language.
He intimated by a nod that he knew
where to find the banker named, but. I
soon discovered that he knew no better
than I did."
This incident is mentioned as having
occurred on the Peking while nearing Pe
nang, after leaving Singapore: "I was in
my cabin as the steamer approached. I
sat with my coat off. I happened to see
the land through the port, and I hastened
on deck to see the shore and the town. I
did not think to put on my coat, and not
realizing the enormity of tlie offense, I
was observing the shore, when the first
officer came to me, with the captain's
compliments, that it was offensive to the
sensibilities of English ladies for a gentle
man to appear on the quarterdeck with
out his coat. 1 always submit to authority

on board ship and I sent my apology to
the commander.
"I put on my coat and returned to the
deck, where I thought the matter over,
for I did not yet realize the heinousness of
the transgression. I had no thin coat
with me, for I never wear them at home.
I wondered if I was so ignorant as not to
comprehend the proprieties of social life
on board ship, and 1 ventured to mention
the affair to an officer of the British army,
for they are all gentlemen and well versed
in the usages of society. He said I ought
to have sent word to the captain to mind
his own business. I should not have fol
lowed that advice if I had received it in
season; and the politeness of the first
officer quite disarmed me. I was inclined
to believe that this officer had put his un
pleasant duty into his own language, for
I did not regard his superior as competent
to do it so handsomely.
"I could not help wondering what effect
the march of over 100 Chinamen, almost
in a state of nature, in coaling the vessel
had upon the 'sensibilities of English
ladies,' to say nothing of the Malays in
the same natural costume, of whom they
bought trinketa. Within a few days I had
seen the captain on the quarterdeck bare
footed and with hia trousers turned up
nearly to his knees. He was going to take
or had just taken his bath. I ought to
add that Captain Jephson was regarded as
an especially skillful captain, to whom
the command of one of the new steamers
of 8000 tons, then building, might be given.
I think the P. and O Company could do
better and might select a gentleman as
well as an accomplished navigator."
It is mentioned in the narrative that
the voyage across the Arabian Sea, about
2100 nautical miles, was accomplished in
seven days. After the ship was fairly
within the Red Sea only a few islands
were to be seen, and she was out of sight
of land most of the time. When the ship
entered the gulf of Suez the traveler had a
view of the peninsula of Sinai, though he
could not make out the mountain on which
Moses received the commandments.
"Many passengers embarKed at Port
Said for Brindisi. Among them was his
Royal Highnes3 the Duke of Cambridge,
field marshal and late commander-in
chief of the British army. He is a grand
son of George 111 and a cousin of Queen
Victoria. He was plainly dressed and
seemed to be a very pleasant gentleman,
not above speaking to a common sort of
person like myself. I had a little talk with
him on deck as we went into the harbor of
Brindisi, and, speaking of ages, I gave
mine and he said that ho was seventy-
seven, or a couple of months older than
her Majesty."
Oliver Optic had been in London more
than a dozen times, and it was an old
story to him. Baring Bros. & Co. pro
vided him with a ticket by the Catalonia
from Liverpool to Boston. The surgeon of
the ship was a great hunter of elephants
and tigers in India, and his adventures
were extremely interesting. The narrative
closes with this record: "I sailed March
26, and came to the dock at East Boston
early on the morning of April 7, extremely
pleased that I had finished my trip around
I the world."
BE SURE
YOU DRINK PURE
WATER
Mineral Springs Are
Qermless
to Test Water â Some Qood
by the Doctor for
Jhose Who Qo on
Vacations
It would be manifestly improper for onÂ«
to attempt such a thing as a series of in
structions for determining the character
of water supplied for drinking considering
the fact that complex and elaborate an
alyses are required for that purpose.
One might perhaps mention a chemical
test which would show the presence of
certain impurities, while other and possibly
very injurious foreign ingredients in the
water might exist without detection.
A celebrated authority once stated that
"absolutely pure water, consisting of a
I chemical union with condensation of two
j volumes of hydrogen and one oxygen, is a
; chemical curiosity."
The impurities of water are usually
i placed under two" heads, organic and mi
i organic. Of the first class the impurit^s
may be in the form of bacteria, or they
may consist of particles of organic sub
: stances, such as decomposing animal or
' vegetable matter.
Of the latter class the chemist usually
' finds such things as nitrates and nitrites,
â  free ammonia, chlorine and various other
1 chemical substances. The nitrates are
\ usually the product of decomposition, fol
! lowing the contamination of water with
| sewage.
Water is usually spoken of as either
j hard or soft. Hard waters contain lime
1 and magnesium salts, or other chemical
; substances which curdle soap. The im
! purities usually found in soft water are
â  inconsiderable.
A simple and convenient method of de
; termining whether a water is hard or soft
iis by means of tincture of soap. This
| preparation produces no effect when added
|to pure distilled water. When combined
i with soft water it causes a slight opales
cence, while with hard water a milky
| appearance i 3 produced, which latter is
i due to the formation of an insoluble com
pound through the combination of the
! fatty acids oi the soap with the lime or
magnesium salts existing in the water as
impurities.
Pure water is transparent, colorless,
! tasteless and odorless. Any water that is
| turbid, with an odor and unpleasant taste,
i may be condemned as unfit for consump
tion.
In order to be fit for cookine ana drink
ing, water need not be chemically pure.
Natural water is seldom if ever free from
foreign ingredients.
On the other hand, water may meet all
the other requirements given above and
yet be dangerous because it is contami
nated with disease germs, such as the
bacilli of typhoid and malarial fevers.
Bacteria may be found in all well waters.
When a well is frequently pumped out
and allowed to refill the number of bac
teria is always greatly diminished. The
bacteria usually found in well water are
comparatively harmless. It is only when
the water becomes contaminated with
sewage containing the dangerous varieties
that use of the water becomes perilous.
In water from a well-protected spring
the number of bacteria is usually very
small. In the water of lakes bacteria are
abundant near the shore, while very few
are found in the water obtained from the
middle of the lake.
Water is said to be improved by storing
for a time. As there is not sufficient sus
tenance in the water a sort of starvation
process is carried out and the bacteria per
ish and fall to the bottom.
The idea that freezing destroys bacteria
! is still entertained by many. Repeated
: experiments have proved that freezing
, merely renders them inactive, and that
j they multiply with great rapidity as soon
as the ice is melted and the conditions are
favorable.
Mineral springs are, as a rule, more or
less free from bacteria. This freedom is
attributed to the carbonic acid gas with
which the water is impregnated.
There is no simple method of ascertain
ing the presence of bacteria in water.
The microscope is usually employed for
: that purpose. There is a 'preparation
; known as Pasteur's solution that is some
; times used. This solution consists of ten
; parts of candy sugar, one part of tartrate
| of ammonia, one hundred parts of water
and the ash of one part of yeast.
The solution is mixed with suspected
i water in a flask. If the solution remains
| clear it is an indication that the water is
; free from bacteria. If it becomes subse
; quently turbid it means that bacteria are
j present.
Although there is no simple method of
determining the presence of impurities in
water, there is a very simple way of ren
dering it fit for use, at least so far as bac
teria are concerned. Boiling will destroy
them, one and all.
It is only necessary to boil the water
five minutes, but it is better to boil it ten
or even fifteen minutes when there is rea
son to suspect contamination of a serious
character.
Many people believe that by mixing an
equal quantity of wine with water contain
ing bacteria a harmless drink may be
made. This impression is erroneous. It
is true that some bacteria perish in the
mixture, but the majority do not.
People entertaining such an idea would
better follow the Biblical injunction and
"drink no longer water, but use a little
wine for thy stomach's sake."

THE STRANGE
BIRD THAT IS UNKNOWN
TO ORNITHOLOGISTS.
remmy Harvey of Soncma Has an
Uncouth Pet That Has No
Standing in the Natural
History Books.
Tommy Harvey, a boy of 10, living on
the outskirts of Sonoma, has the strangest j
bird pet of any boy in the State. It may >
be, of course, that some great ornithologist
might find an ur pronounceable name for j
the creature, but men who have lived in I
the vicinity for :tiirty years and done con- !
sidera'ole huntng say they never saw its !
like before, ani most of them never want
to again, for the shock to their nervous
systems by rue first sight of it was most j
severe. Nor can they be blamed, for the ,
appearance of Tommy Harvey's bird is i
enough to make a man drink water ex
clusively for the rest of his life.
Tom:ny found this out and it furnished
him with great amusement. The first
man who saw the bird came upon it sud- |
den!y while Tommy was playing with it in
the road. He gave a jump and a howl and
ran away so fast he looked like a whole j
regiment of soldiers. Almost anybody !
fse would have done the same thing. In j
fact, Tommy Harvey's bird looks like the j
torrid memory of an attack of delirium j
tremens, and any drinking man would I
momentarily expect to see a countless i
multitude just like it come suddenly out of
space.
IfcTommy Harvey caught his bird about
ten days ago. He was out hunting for
frogs in a marsh not far from town, and
was having a good time, as boys will, i
Suddenly he heard a sound, between a I
screech and a whistle, that made him
jump. He started to run and saw the
strange bird directly in front of him. Of
course it did not frighten him as badly as
it did some people who have seen it since,
but for several moments he thought there
was a sledge-hammer inside of him where
his heart ought to be. As boys have a
powerful habit cf doing, Tommy got over j
that feeling and started to investigate the
bird. It was not the least bit afraid of
him. He used a long stick at first, for the
bird to exercise its beak on, until he saw j
that it could not bite very hard. Gradually ;
he got nearer and nearer, arxl braver and
braver as he assured himself of the queer
bird's harmlessness.
In a short time Tommy mustered up
courage enough to stroke the bird's back. |
This seemed to please it and it humped
itself in delight. Tommy was delighted
also and was not long in making up his I
mind to take the bird home. He had for
gotten all about the frogs and they
croaked and croaked in unmolested glee.
When Tommy reached home with his
prize he first showed it to his mother.
But that good woman did not want to
look at it. She simply gave a shriek and
fled from the house the moment Tommy
set it on the floor. The bird, of course,
did not mind the shriek and proceeded to j
make itself at home. Tommy fed it the j
best there was in the house, and also all
there was in the house, and still it was
hungry. It ate and ate, and Tommy's
mother, who by this lime had recovered
enough to sneak around the side of the
bouse and peep in a window, was willing
that it should have all it wanted.
Tommy then took his bird out on the
street and created great consternation j
among the men and envy among the other j
boys because it did not belong to them.
The first night Tommy owned the bird he
wanted to take it to bed with him. His
mother allowed him to do this, but boy
and bird both slept in the woodshed.
Tommy has since made up his mind that
the bird can sleep by itself in the wood
shed. He said he was not afraidâ of
course notâ but it was lonesome out there,
and his pet wanted to play with him and
wouldn't let him sleep 4
There ere a great many peculiar things |
about the appearance of Tommy's bird. It
looks like a combination of ostrich, eagle
and owl. It is very young, not more than
three weeks old, and yet it is at least
eighteen inches high, or larger than a baby
ostrich of the same age. It is covered with
a soft, white fuzz like a young duck, and
has feet that look to be about twice the
size they ought to be. Passing down the
sides of the creature are a series of stripes
of brown color like a zebra; and its head â
it's a nightmare. ' Projecting from a dark
circle on its face is the beak of a vulture,
while the eyes are small and wicked- !
looking. The bird's wings are dark in |
color, and most of the time hang down at
its sides. It cannot fly yet and is not able
to walk much. The size of the bird is
most deceiving in regard to its weight. It
looks as heavy as a .big turkey, but really
doeÂ» not weigh more than tnree pounds.
A WONDERFUL
DOG THAT PLAYS THE PART
OF PEDAGOGUE.
Born in Liverpool, but Now Delights
and Astonishes Those Who Fre
quent the Clay-Street
Market.
Jack is the name of the smartest dog in
Clay-street Market, and there are lots of
dogs with big brain-pans in that establish
ment. The peculiarity of Jack, however,
is that he is most desirous of imparting
his knowledge to the rest of his breed.
Not only is Jack a smart dog but he is a
trained doe, which is further proof to the
adace that "a rolling stone gets polished."
Jack first saw the light of day in Liver
pool, about five years ago, in a little saloon
near the monster floating dock; but of
course he don't want everybody to know
this. As the saloon-keeper had a good
many more just like him he cave Jack to
a ship's captain, who took him on many
long voyages.
Jack caw a great many strange
lands, but did not take a liking to
any of them until he struck California.
He had no sooner got inside the Golden
Gate than he knew that he had struck the
best part of the world. Home ties were
strong, though, and Jack was undecided
about staying Here, until one day he wan
dered up Clay street into the market.
That settled it. No more England and
free trade for Jack and no more sailing
the stormy seas. Clay street was a good
deal better than Lime street when the
meat question was considered.
Jack is really the property of Uri & Co.,
although he makes his home in any of the
stalls he pleases. He was not in the mar
ket very long before it was known that he
could perform many tricks the sailors had
taught him. For awhile he had all of the
glory of this to himself, and then sud
denly made up his mind to impart some of
his knowledge to his fellows.
It was no trouble for Jack to get pupils,
as he is on friendly terms with all the
dogs in town, and many of them showed
a Btrong disposition to gain some of his
accomplishments. The trouble was that
they could not learn. It was as easy as
fun for Jack to stand on his head, but
most of those he tried to teach generally
succeeded only in breaking their noses.
He tried many simpler tricks, but to the
same end â failure.
It was then that Jack hit on the idea of
taking his pupila when they were quHe
young, and his efforts have been crowned
with success. He now has a class every
day at such hours as he can find a puppy
willing to go through instruction.
Those who believe that animals are un
able to communicate ideas to one another
should watch Jack and one of his pupils.
He will first do a certain thing himself,
and then appears to explain it to the
puppy. The youngster is attentive, and
then tries to imitate his master.
Of course, the puppies learn some things
quicker than others. Rat killing, for in
stance, they pick up very rapidly. Jack's
method of doing this is to catch the rat,
gently at first, and throw it into the air.
When the squealing rodent is descending,
he gives it one rap across its spinal column
and the rat has nothing more to say. The
puppies enjoy learning this trick, but don't
always do it as gracefully as Jack. They
kill the rat, though, before they get
through, or Jack finds out the reason why.
During the three years he has been in the
market Jack has taught many dozen
puppies to become proficient ratters. He
is the best of teachers, because he holds
the coast record of 115 rats in a single
night. Knowing this, it is easy to account
for the scarcity of rats in the Clay-street
market.
Jack has taught many puppies to stand
on their heads and to stand on their hind
legs, as well as jumping over high obstacles |
and other similar feats. He has tried in j
vain, however, to teach any of them to
climb a ladder or turn a back handspring,
both of which he does easily and grace
fully himself. But he never gets tired,
and still hopes to accomplish his purpose.
Almost every day he can be seen hard at
work. He gets one or more puppies and
makes them watch him climb a ladder.
The puppies, however, are satisfied to lei
him do it, and refuse to make the attempt
themselves. In such cases Jack is likely
to take a squealing youngster by the bacic
of the neck and try to boost him up the
ladder.
It occasionally happens that Jack's lad
der-climbing gets him into trouble. He
can go up all right, but cannot turn
around and come down. He has to jump,
and Bhould he in his enthusiasm climb too
high for this must wait for some of the
men to take him down. This is not al
ways convenient, and Jack often has to
wait a long time before relief comes.
The men in the market are quite proud
of all of Jack's accomplishments. But
the)' are still prouder of his attempts to
impart them to his friends. They think,
therefore, that San Francisco can boast ot
the only dog pedagogue in the world.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
THE BIGGEST
BRANDY STILL IN ALL THE
WIDE WORLD.
Greatest in Size and Capacity and
Located on the El Pinal Vine
yard in San Joaquin
County.
California is a big State, and most of the
things within its borders are in compari
son. This is true particularly as concerns
horticultural and viticultural matters. It
known that the Lucerne vineyard in Kings
County is the largest acreage in the world
devoted to the growing of raisin grapes.
A few weeks ago The Call published a
picture of the largest wine vat in the
world and this week is able to produce a
drawing of the largest brandy still in the
world.
When the word "largest" is used in this
instance it does not mean largest in point
of the size of the machine, but in point of
! capacity. To explain this it is necessary
to state that distilling apparatus has been
constantly improving within the last ten
years. The process virtually remains the
same, but the machinery has been made
to occupy less space. One of the old-fash
ioned stills, such as are in general use
throughout the East and in Europe, with
the same capacity of the largest in the
world, would occupy about ten times the
space in cubic measure.
The largest brandy still in the world is
on the El Pinal vineyard in San Joaquin
County, not far from Stockton. It is the
property of George West, and part of it
has been built about four years and the
other part was finished only a short time
ago. As is well known, the El Pinal vine
yard has always made a specialty of brandy
and sweet wines. It was the intention of
the proprietors to do this when they went
into business, and for that reason they had
the largest still built that was ever put up.
That was, as has been stated, about four
years ago, and even then it was ahead of
anything cisc in existence. It could pro
duce more brandy in twenty-four hours
than any other still in the worid, and it
has not been surpassed since. But even
that was not enough to supply all of the
alcohol needed in their business, so an
other still was built and made to work in
connection with the original one. The
j two are really one still as they are used,
and have about three times the capacity
of any other still in the world.
This enormous machine is located in a
building by itself, and part of the year is
kept running day and night. It is very
complicated in its workings, so that a de
scription of that part of it cannot be at
tempted here. It will be sufficient to state
that the grapejuice or wine is pumped
from the vats to a tank on top of the still.
From there it simply passes through a
series of heated chambers in the form of a
vapor and comes out in the shape of
brandy. It can be tested in the different
chambers and the change noted. In the
In the first chamber it is little more than
warm wine, and it gradually gets stronger
and stronger, until it is sharp to taste.
From the time the wine leaves the tank
until it comes out as grape brandy only
ten minutes is occupied. In the old meth
od of distilling it used to take about three
hours.
In appearance the largest brandy still in
the world is simply a conglomeration of
tanks, pipes and boilers. The accompany
ing drawing shows only a portion of the ap
paratus, as it i 9 impossible to show all of
it in one picture, owing to the way it is
placed in the building.
Tne capacity of this still is enough to
make a person wonder what becomes of
all of its products. When running full
time it can convert 15,000 gallons of wine
into brandy a day. This will make about
4000 gallons every twenty-four hours, or
enough to keep about 40,000 men in a state
of intoxication during that time. In a
month there would be enough cf brandy
on hand to intoxicate 1,200,000 men, or
about tne entire population of New York.
But as it happens, very little of this
brandy is sold as brandy. It is used to
"fortify" sweet wines so that they will be
in condition to keep until ready to send to
market. The alcohol acts as a preserva
tive of the grape juice the same as it would
of anything else. It keeps it from turn
ing sour.
THE CURIOUS
MARKING OF ARROWHEAD
MOUNTAIN.
Strange Freak of Nature Plain'y
Visible on the Side of a Great
Eminence in Sonoma
County.
Who is not interested in the strange
forms that can often be seen in the rock
formations of mountain sides? People
will travel hundreds of miles to see some
combination of rocks that has accident
ally taken the shape of a man's head.
They will stand, almost in awe, before a
cliff on the side of which groups of figures
can be seen, by a good stretch of the imag
ination, when the same work done by a
human being would not arrest their atten
tion for a moment. All of which shows
that nearly everybody has some admira
tion for nature and are even inclined to
give ber a shade the best of it when judg
ing her efforts at reproducing herself.
Down in San Bernardino County them
is a spot on a mountain-side that has
taken very much the formation of an
Indian arrowhead. Ever since it was dis
covered it has been a sort of show place
for tourists in the vicinity, many of them
traveling many miles to see it. It proved
to be such an attraction that a big hotel
was built near by, and there were often
hundreds of visitors in a day. And yet it
took considerable imagination to see the
arrowhead, even after one had it located,
which was not easy to do, as the whole
mountain side was nearly the same color,
the curious effect being produced by a
smooth gray rock that was surrounded by
rough ones a little darker, and the dull
grasses and weeds that grew between them.
People were so interested in the curiosity
that it was almost impossible for some
time to keep enough photographs on hand
to supply the demand. All guide-books of
the southern part of the State contain pic
tures of it, so that its fame is world-wide.
While this freak of nature has been prov
ing such an attraction one of the same
kind in Sonoma County has scarcely been
heard of, and it is really a great deal more
remarkable. It is on the western slope of
a mountain, just to the northward of Vine
yard station and can be seen for many
miles. It requires no imagination to see
it, as it is of a much lighter color than the
rest of the mountain and always standÃ
out in strong relief. In fact the contrast
is almost equal to black and white.
This freak ot nature has not only been
a curiosity to white people, but it is known
that the Indians had some Â«ort of resrard
for it. When it first came into existence
is not known. It was there when the
Mexicans came and they were told by
their Indian predecessors that it had been
referred to in the legends of their tribes
for a thousand moons or more.
Tue Mexicans paid little attention to
the Arrowhead further than to think it
queer. Many of them went up to it but of
course it then lost its curious aspect
and became a patch of bare mountain land.
It was difficult to get the Indians to talk
of the Arrowhead, but the. cause of this
aversion has never been ascertained.
About twenty years ago a number of the
residents of Sonoma determined to make
an exploration of the peak and started to
work with pick and shovel. In less than
five hours they had found a whole wagon
load of Indian pottery. In a few months
the whole surface of the Arrowhead had
been dug over and hundreds of curious
objects found, totally different from
those In use by the Indians of the present
day. All efforts to find out what they
were proved failures. The Indians abso
lutely refused to talk about them and from
the day the groui;d was first broken it has
been impossible to get an Indian within a
mile of the locality.
The Sonoma County Arrowhead lies with
its tip pointing uphill and towards the
north. It is perfect In form and has
shaft that shows plainly. The arrowhead
itself Is of a sort of a light clay color, ana
the surroundings are very dark green. It
was evidently caused by a landslide. Aside
from the strange shape the landslide took
it is stranger stijl that nothing has since
grown on the spot. The land is of a good
quality, and in the many years it has been
exposed to the action of the rains should
have become fertile.
THE LARGEST
GROWTH OF CACTUS HEDGE
IN THE WORLD.
A Remarkable Prickly Pear Tree
That Flourishes Wonderfully
Though Far From Its
Native Soil.
One of the most puzzling things to botan
ists is the fact that plants can occasionally
be found growing to perfection, and even
abnormally, under conditions directly op
posite to what is generally accepted as
needful to them.
One of the most pronounced examples of
this can be seen in the big cactus hedge at
Sonoma. Under any circumstances this
vegetable growth would be a curiosity, as
it is undoubtedly one of the largest, if not
the largest, in ths world.
It is said to have been planted about
sixty years ago by the good padres who
founded the mission of Sonoma. They
were all men who had spent their lives
farther south, and the sight of a cactus
tree was almost as necessary to them as
their daily food. To be sure a few tiny
examples of the prickly pear could be
found on the hills, but those were not
what the padres wanted. They wanted
the kind that grows in Southern Califor
nia and on the deserts of Arizona.
So they obtained a few roots from San
Diego, it is said, and soon had their gar
den under way. They expected to have
something grand, but it is safe to say that
in their wildest dreams they never con
jured up anything like the hedge now
growing.
This giant prickly pear hedge is just
back of the old mission and close to the
church General Vallejo built for his sol
diers. It is one of the sights of Sonoma,
and at present looks its best, because it is
in bloom.
The most striking thing about the hedge
is its great height, although it covers
nearly 600 square feet of land. It grows
in a sort of row over 100 feet long and
about ten feet wide at the widest point. It
tapers to the end 9or it would cover 1000
feat.
The accompanying picture only shows !
a portion of the hedge at the widest point,
but is enough to give an idea of the height
of the tallest tree. To measure this ex- '
actly is, of course, a difficult matter, as !
the tallest tree is in the center of a thick
growth of stickers. A few weeks ago a ;
rough "sight" measurement was made
with a level and a pole and the result
showed thirty-two feet.
This is nearly correct, as the picture
shows the tree to be about rive times the j
height of a lady, which would be twenty- j
five feet. Allowing for the fact that the
lady is about fifteen feet nearer the camera !
than the tallest prickly pear would just !
about make it, according to perspective
measurement.
The prickly pear is not generally con
sidered beautiful, but the hedge at Sonoma I
is really pleasing to look at. The large j
blue-green leaves that look so thick and j
clumsy here produce an artistic effect.
There are so many of them, and they have
a way of being thrown into strong relief
against the dark shadows of the interior
of the hedge, that is almost uncanny, as it j
makes them seem to be suspended in air.
Of course, the hedge being in bloom now,
it looks better than usual, as the bright
red flowers lend an additional charm. One
of the peculiar effects to be observed in
this hedge is that it is not swayed by the
wind except when a gale is blowing.
Grass, weeds and other trees near by are
tossed about gracefully, but the prickly
pear, on account of being so heavy, re
mains as rigid as if cut out of stone.
This remarkable hedge has been of al
most its present size for many years. As
fast as new leaves form old ones fall off.
A CITY THAT
IS BUILT ON THE BAY OF
SAN FRANCISCO.
Houses and Thoroughfares That Pro
ject From the Lsnl Far Out
Over the Mission Mud
Flats.
The people of San Francisco do not re
ally know just how many interesting and
unusual things there are around about j
them. Or is it that there are so many
strange and curious things*on every hand
that one grows callous and passes them j
by without notice?
Down on the Mission mud flats, just off
the mouth of the channel, there is a little
city on the water that in almost any other
part of the world would be a sight to show
all visitors. Thousands of people pass it
daily and never give it notice. Some
patriotic citizens may explain this by say
ing that there are so many interesting
things here that the one in question is of
no importance, which may be all very
true. But there is no denying the fact I
that it is worthy of a great deal more at- |
tention than it has received in the past.
The commencement of this city's build- j
ing dates back about ten yeirs. It was at I
the time the pier was built out toward ;
Mission Rouk. This naturally made work
for a great many people in the immediate
vicinity, and the pier became a central \
point for doing business.
As the business of Mission Rock grew so
grew the pier, and soon a number of boat
builders were located there. At first they
had only their workshops there, but soon
moved their household effects also. Houses
were built on the pier, and the main pas- !
sapeway became like a street.
Later on a time came when there was no
longer room on the pier for houses. Such
a trifle did not interfere with the prospec
| tive builders, however. It was a little
I more work, but they drove piles in the
j mud as near the pier as was necessary for
i their purpose and let some of the houses
j hang over. This has been going on for a
j long time and at present the city covers
many acres.
It is certainly one of the most pictur
esque places in the State. The buildings
| are constructed on easy lines and in such
| positions as best suited the builders. The
| result is a conglomeration of sky-lines,
; broken here and there with flagpoles and
i chimneys. Many of the buildings are in
I the form of a balcony and hang over the
water in the most threatening manner.
But they are most likely safe enough and
i nobody has ever heard of anybody loosing
; sleep through fear of taking a plunge into
i the waters of the bay.
In this little city on the water there are
J about 150 people living. Most of them are
engaged in some sort of maritime business,
such as fishing or boat-building, and the
others are there to supply their wants.
I There are no large dry-goods stores in this
i town, and one will searcli in vain for a j
i church. But a first-class saloon has been
prosperous for many years. One man
keeps a sort of general store and his wife
i takes in boarders. At least, she did for a
long time.
They are a happy lot ot people, these
San Francisco Venetians. None of them
work themselves to death and they have
plenty to eat and drink. They also have
time to entertain the few visitors they
may have. In other respects the town is
j like any other. Babies are born there and
old people die occasionally, just the same
as in any other part of the world.
When seen from any direction this curi- j
ous town presents a picturesque and artistic
I appearance. The piles on which it is built
are not in the best of repair and are cov
ered with barnacles that give them a rich
gray-green color.
IKE TONDRICK,
THE INFANT SANDOW OF
BUSH STREET.
A Wonderful San Francisco Child of
Three Years That Can Lift
and Carry More Than
Forty Pounds.
It is only within the last year, however,
that Ike has taken to "showing off" what
he could do. He was able to walk when
only a few months old, but his mother did
not allow him out on the street. When he
was two years old, however, it became im
possible to restrain him. Ropes to tie him
we're snapped like bits of string, and he
would seize anything within reach to
break down a door so that he could get
out of a room.
Ike Tondrick is only a child of three,
but he has more strength than most of 10.
And he delights in it to such an extent
that he puts in most of his time testing it.
Little Ike's home is on Bush street, near
Taylor, and his parents are both strong
healthy people in tne prime of life, so the
boy comes by his phenomenal strength
honestly. He always was strong, and
when only a baby showed great vigor in
many ways.
Mrs. Tondrick attempted to combat
this propensity for some time, but at â  last
it became monotonous and the boy was
allowed to have his way. And he has had
it. No boy of twice his years dare cross
him and he makes it lively for any young
ster that annoys him, no matter what his
age.
As a fighter Ike is in a class by himself,
but he shows his strength more markedly
in his act of carrying heavy articles.
Twenty-five pounds is nothing to him.
Thirty he can carry easy and when he
tries he can transport it for a distance of a
block, which is a good deal for anybody.
The other morning Ike and a number of
boys were at play and it seems that a
large block of wood was needed to hold
up a certain corner of the stage. Some
repairs are being; made to the schoolhouse
fence on the corner of Bush and Taylor
streets, and Ike concluded that the desired
object could be obtained there. He found
ju&t the thing that was wanted â a beam
four feet long and seven inches thick both
ways.
To have even lifted this would have
taxed the strength of most boys, but the
young Sandow picked it up as if it was a
chip. He held it in his arms and walked
all the way to where the other boys were
without resting. When he got there it
took two of them to move it to where it
was wanted. Ike's great feat, though, it
to carry another boy. He will pick up
one larger than himself and carry him a
great distance. He carried a stone from
one end of the block to tne other a few
days ago, and when it was weighed at the
grocery it tipped the beam at forty pounds.
In appearance Ike is a good-looking boy,
although a little heavy. But he is solid.
No superfluous fat about him. He is all
muscle and bone. His complexion is a
beautiful cream and pink in spite of the
fact that he is out in the sun most of the
time. And how he can eat; anything â no
matter what â disappears like magic when
placed on a plate in front of him. He was
never sick a day in his life and from his
&ppparance is not likely to be.
His disposition is remarkably good, con
sidering the opportunities he has to play
the bully. He is ready to help anybody in
trouble and is not afraid of getting into it
himself. In fact he likes trouble, particu
larly if it is of a lively kind, with plenty
of kicking and scratching.
There is only one thing that mars Ike's
happiness in life, and that is the fact that
he has to wear dresses. He says he is a
boy, but his mother thinks he looks bet
ter in girls' clothes, and that good lady
is a person that Ike don't trifle with, ex
cept she tries to keep him in the bouse.
It is all right if he can get away, but if he
tears his clothes often she is sure to find it
out and he has to pay for it.
To see this child carrying a heavy load
is an almost grotesque sight. Forty
pounds of wood is as large as he is. lie
certainly has a great future before him.

Keep in This Position When You Fall Overboard and You Will
Not Drown.
HOW NOT TO DROWN
There is no need of drowning simply be
cause you happen to fali overboard. Keep
cool, have a little confidence in yourself,
follow these few and simple directions, and
you may float safely till help arrives, no
matter how long the coming. All this,
within reason, of course. Ii assistance
does not come to you before you die of
starvation, certainly you will not be saved.
A collateral truth is that you must be
gifted with enough physical endurance to
remain in this natural and easy position
until tlie help arrives. If you lose your
wits, however, and be^in to struggle, you
will drown as sure as the law of gravity
prevails.
Not Ion:: ago, in New York, the body of
a man was hshed out of East River and
taken to the morgue as dead. Evidently
the body had been in the water for many
hours, and you can imagine the astonish
ment of every one when the apparent
corpse showed signs of returning conscious
ness and eventually sat up and began to
talk. This remarkable occurrence led the
Pittsburg Dispatch to take up the matter
and treat it from a scientific standpoint.
Samuel Cockran was the name of tbe
man who so miraculously escaped drown
ing. One of the authorities cited in the
matter says:
"Cockran's case is by no means as
peculiar as it would seem ai first thought,
and is in no wav mysterious when a few
scientific principles are understood.
There is no manner of calculating how
soon a body will sink, and no absolute
certainty of telling how long a body has
been in the water. It is all a matter of j
guesswork. As a general rule a human
body is of about the same weight as the i
water of the river. In other words, the
specific gravity of the body is equal to the i
bulk of water which it displaces. I say
about equal, for there are conditions i
which make this otherwise â the tide at :
times affects the water of the river, while
stout people, with small bones, are rruch j
lighter than lean, large-boned people.
Taking the general rule without the con
ditions, then, a body will rarely ever sink
of its own accord."
"How is It, then, that people who fall i
into the water are usually drowned ?"
"That is entirely due to the struggles of ;
the person in the water. The bulk of i
water displacement and the gravity of :
bodies are so nicely balanced that the i
MY MIDNIGHT VISITOR
The midhour of night, as a rule, is the
accepted time and a dimly lighted top
floor back room in a gloomy tenement a
favorite place for uncanny happenings.
These essential elements were present.
Time, place and occurrence were in keep
ing one with another. Hues, the artist,
occupied a top-floor rear apartment. He
â¢was crippled with rheumatism, doubled
up in a manner painful to behold ; bound
hand and foot as it were by the malady
which bad made him its victim. He was
alone, moreover, and I had given bis
sorry plight many a thought during the
day. My last sketch for the nipht fin
ished I hastened away from the artroom
of the morning newspaper and was soon
afterward in the presence of my friend
Hues.
"Great God, I'm starved!" he cried as
I entered the door after feeling my way
through blactcness up three flights of
stairs. "Here lam chained up by this ac
cursed ailment, can't move a limb and
haven't touched food for a day."
"Too bad, old boy," said I, "and I'll
rush up a supper for you."
"Just coffee now, please,'' was the sick
man's request. Stumbling blindly down
the dark stairway, I was soon in the res
taurant A stimulant, I thought, couldn't
be a bad thing for Hues; so I purchased a
quart-bottle of whisky, which 1 buried in
an Inside pocket of my greatcoat, and,
being supplied with a steaming cup of
coffee, wended my way carefully back to
the sufferer. Hues sipped the hot bever
age and seemed much relieved. Then I
drew out the whisky.
"Ah! thanks," said Hues, "a ruboing
with gome of that liquor will benefit my
limbs, I believe."
Hark ! wasn't that a groan of agony from
Ihe hallway? I grasped the candie.-tick
from the table and started for the door;
but I stopped like one shot, as a ghostly
form swelled up out of the shadow and
confronted me.
"Oh, my heart!" gasped the form. It
was the great, tall frame of a man. He
had a knotted grizzly beard and long gray
Lair pushed back from his forehead. Hi 9
mouth was wide open as if to draw into j
his lunes all the air possible, and his look '
of dire distress is indelibly stamped on my
memory.
Trembling, I stood with the oandle in
one ha:id; the bottle of whisky in the
other. The ghastly figure caught sight of
the bottle. He seemed to have lost his
speech. His eyes rolled, his jaws moved
from side to side; he extended a hand
toward the bottle, while with the other
hand he motioned in the direction of his
chasm-like mouth.
Setting down the candle I uncorked the j
most trivial thing will cause one to out
weigh the other. The proper position for
a man in the water who seeks to prevent
himself from sinking is to maintain an up- â 
ri<:ht position, his head thrown back so |
that the entire body is submerged, with I
only the mouth and nostrils above the '
surface of the water. There is a great deal
of sense in the saying that a drowning
man will catch at a straw, for the smallest
bit of wood will give such assistance to
the body as to permit a man in the water
to raise his entire head from the water,
and so look about him. Without the aid
of this straw of help, a hand or even a
finger raised above the water will make
the advantage against the man, and his
head must be forced below the surface."
"Once a man is under water his body
must sink to the bottom, must it not ?"
"Not necessarily. The man will be
drowned, but his body may stay on the
surface. Once a man's head is under
water, in his attempt to breathe he will
take in a quantity of water. This, enter
ins the ftomach, takes the place of the air
which was there, makes the body heavier
than it is naturally and so affects the
body's gravity that it will sink. But in
the case of fleshy persons that I have men
tioned, the amount of water taken in is
not always sufficient to outbalance the
water displacement, and so the body will
not sink."
"But you speak only of persons who are
conscious when they fall in ti>e water.
This man Cockran, from the nature of the
wounds on his head, must have been un
conscious when he fell into the river."
"Just so. I was coming to that. Strange
as it may seem, Cocsran by falling into
the water when unconscious stood a better
chance of remaining on the surface than if
he had been conscious. Being uncon- <
scious, he did not struggle to save himself 'â 
in a way that would have surely sent him '
to the bottom of the river. There was no :
gasp for breath, and consequently no
water entered the stomach to take the
place of air there.
"His body, then, equally balancing the
water which it took the place of. remained i
on the surface, and would have remained
there until he became conscious and strug
gled or until he died. On the same prin
ciple, a man who is dead when he falls or
is thrown into the river rarely sinfcs at all,
or not for a long time." >
whisky in an instant and dashed a power
ful dose of it into a handy glass, which
was snatched from me in a twinkling and
tossed without a swallow, down the throat
of <he midnight visitor.
"Tortures!" he yelled, as he beat his
head with one hand, while with the other
he pushed back the j;lass for another in
stallment. "Racking pains! Killing me!"
No sooner was the glass filled a second
time than the contents followed the pre
ceding measure. Another and still an
other glasstul I poured out. It disappeared
in the same way. I was growing weak
from the strain ; a cold perspiration was
over me. Glass after glass I filled, until
the bottle had shed its last drop. Even
then tne weird stranger motioned for
more. The formation of his throat must
have been peculiar. He didn't swallow â
he tossed the liquor down, and it seemed
to be precipitated directly, without any
semblance of any intervening operation,
into the deeps of his organism.
Meantime Hues had risen up in bed, his
eyes riveted on the figure in white, throw
ing strong liquor into himself without any
apparent effect. The sudden and unex
pected ghostly comlne. the unearthly
looks and actions, the dim light, the hour,
were all calculated to cliill the blood and
make the hair stand on end like quills
upon the fretful porcupine.
Noiselessly the figure shrunk back
toward the door. Unconsciously I fol
lowed. Now I was peering out into the
dark hallway. Tne ghostly visitor was
gone ! I turned to attend to my patient,
who had been out of my thoughts
for a time, when, to my amazement, I en
countered him at my elbow. Hues walked
the length of the room, dressed himself
and marveled much at the aiscovery that
his rheumatism had passed away. He
was feeling like a new man, and at 2 a. m.
ate supper in the cafe below. We told the
story of the night's bogie to another occu
pant of tne house, which, by the way, is
not 1000 feet distant from the corner of
Clay and Montgomery streets.
The new party laughed heartily. "Same
old trick!" he cried. "Harry Siegfried
has been playing that same game here for
years. His stomach is copper-lined. His
throat is simply a straight pipe-line to his
stomach from his funnel of a mouth.
That man would make a great pantomime
artixt, wouldn't he! He tackles only new
comers, and generally has to shriek for
the stimulants, which stranters hasten to
procure in onler to save a life. Some
times he frightens the wits out of people.
But you are fortunate in the premises, my
boys for Siegfried appears to have fright
ened the rheumatism out of one of you,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
"DOWN THE THROAT OF THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR."
THE MODERN CUMULATIVE STORY
The evolution of the modern cumula
tive newspaper story is easy. All that is
necessary is a unit of any sort, an air of
plausibility and a rudimentary knowledge
of the multiplication table. For instance,
a man eats one and three-fourths pounds
of solid matter for lunch and drinks one
fourth of a pound of liquids. There is
nothing unusual about that; but suppose
he should lay inside of his stomach one
year's provisions at one meal? Of course,
he could not do that, but it is easy for a
space-writer to assume that there is some
where a gentleman with insides of indefi
nite elasticity and expansive ability and
then the story is made. The process is
represented by this mathematical formula:
Two pounds x 3 (meals) x 365 (days)
equals 1 year's supply.
It then easily appears that the man has
consumed, all at one sitting, 2190 pounds
of food and drink, or a little over one ton.
Naturally the public smiles at one man's
exploits, but when it appears that some
anonymous scientist has discovered a fluid
which will make all men equally elastic
and the possibilities for San Francisco,
for instance, run like this:
As 1 man is to 320,000 so are 2190 pounds
eaten by 1 man at 1 meal to 710,800,000
pounds eaten by San Francisco at 1 break
fast.
Tbe enraptured public having followed
this story through to this bewildering re
sult, sympathizes unanimously with the
coarse male voice which breaks in at this
point, saying:
"Well, I'll be ; what will these news
paper fellows get next to till up with? 1 '
Tne truth is that the "cumulative freak
story writer" has been too modest hereto
fore. He has fondly rattled the chinks in
hii pocket on the basis of local calcula
ion. He has permitted some "pent-up
Utica" to restrain his powers, regardless
of the true statement of the poet that "the
whole boundless universe is ours." What
the public want is the best and most com
prehensive. It does well enough to esti
mate bow far the elbows of all the band
organ grinders of San Francisco travel in
a year or a lifetime; possibly well enough
to give us the facts possessing intrinsic in- j
terest concerning the cumulative energy
of all the boys who "shoot craps"
around Lotta's fountain; not neces
sarily bad to inform us with what
a resounding thwack some mythical horse
on the "bob-car" street lines could knock
the driver from the platform if all the
power wasted by other horses around town
in the brushing away of flies were concen
trated in one blow to be dealt by his tail
at the unlucKy driver. These are live
topics, the lack of due discussion of which
would hurt; but the fact is that the field is
not wide enough.
Hark to the tramp of the multitudes in all
climes and all countries! Their rhythmic
footfalls truly "echo around the globe."
By tens of thousands and millions, the
cadence never ceasing, as the sun alter
nately shines on one part or another of
the earth's pleasing circumference, this
multitudinous army marches forever.
Toddling with feeble steps from the
cradle; running with nimble feet toward
the schooihouse; walking with dignified
tread to the academic stage; firmly press
ing the earth in the advance toward ma
turity; poised and equable in the dayÂ«j
when silver hairs are multiplied; S3date
and slow, with halting footfall toward the
setting sun.
The measured step of millions of sol
diers; the airy ascent of millions of sail
ors aloft in the rigging ; the dizzy whirling
or the waltzers; the ponderous concussion I
of the policemen's feet upon the pave- I
ment; the uncertain passage of the inebri- !
ates; Lhe shuffling gait of the professional
tramps ; the weary mileage of njiliious of
fond fathers, babies in their arms,
throughout the silent (?) watches of the
night.
' It is respectfully submitted that the true
"freak story" has in these steps, if they
could be piled one upon another, a yarn
which could reach so high tbat no one can
easily surpass it and that is the ultimate
aim of tne "freak story," to go so far that
no one can possibly go further. The sub
ject of piled up footsteps cannot be ex
hausted in one article, but in limited space
some hints may be thrown out to meas
urably guide the insatiable seeker for the
unusual in some slight degree.
First, concerning the people on the
earth who are qualified to take steps of
differing lengths. There are 5,684.600 in

Asia, 11,170 in the polar regions. The
grand total is 1,479,717,981. The exactness '
of these figures is vouched for by a statis
tical publication. Of these, according to
popular belief, there is only one nation on
the earth whose footsteps can be approxi
mately measured. The notable exception
is in Spain, where there are 28,911.609 per
sons (including the Spanish colonies), who
havo been taught to "walk Spanish."
The most lively men on earth are bill
collectors, and the number of these may
be estimated only approximately. They
can, however, be safely placed at 3,000,000,
who are dodged and told to "call again"
by at least 120,000,000. The steadiest trav
elers are the letter-carriers, who are all the
world over at least 500,000. The great
army of men and women walking with
crying babies number at least 10.000,000,
who step more according to circumstances
than by fixed rule. The messenger
boys vary; the cash boys ditto; the fire
men walk up anc down ladders more than
on a level perhaps, the policemen make it
difficult to estimate their mileage by walk
ing around so many corners, soldiers vary
according to the digestion of the Emperor
or Czar or other ruler.
Poets who are not "doing time" in a
treadmill are an uncertain quantity.
Schoolboys also befog the calculation by
the celerity with which they run around
bases at baseball and the comparative
slowness with which they "ao erramls."
The professional tramps have their sched

Shall kicks count as steps? That is to
be discussed by the accurate freak-story
writer. There are in the Uniled States
84,4:34,000 milking cows which have to
be kicked at least once per day on an
average. There are ballet girls who make
a variable record kicking at chandeliers or
silk hats. Then tke football players and
the suburban committees.
To show how difficult it will be to make
out a mathematically accurate freak-story
on these lines the following facts are
quoted: ,

Thomas Bard of Mumfordville, Ky.,
stepped from the Green River railroad
bridge, a distance to the water below of
130 feet, in 1881, and Steve Brodie made an
equally phenomenal step at the East River
bridge, in New York. This does not affect
the general averaee of the people who
dwell on "the Steppes.''
It is an open question whether bicycle
riding consists of steps or pushes; also
whether a "slide" between bases is a step.

While the width of sidewalks at Mil
waukee is twenty-seven feet the town is

along the edges of the walks.
However, it is best to sweep aside all
difficulties and make bold estimates, for
the reader will like it jusi as well, and it is
easier to do that way. Here is the result:
There are 739,868,990 of the female sex
!on earth. These figures are reached by
dividing the total population by two, the
idea being to give the women an equal
chance with men. Of these, 10 per cent
may be babies unable to walk, but they
have to be walked with, and so they keep
up the average. The Chinese women
number about .200,000,000 and the Turks
20,000,000, and they don't walk much, but
their civilized sisters "window shop"
enough to offset the Mongolian and Mo
hammedan inactivity. Moreover, the
women in many parts of the earth still do
all the "hustling" for the family, and that
surely squares the account. There are
739,858,990 men, including mandarins and
street-corner "statues." Their mileage
will also be averaged on the basis of the
activity of a fair type. Here is a rough
computation per diem:
WOMEN. MEN.
Got breakfast, % mile. ; Walked to breakfast, 25
Forenoon work, 4 miles, feet. i
Afternoon calls, 2 miles. Walked to streetcar, 200
Window shopped, 11 feet.

Got dinner, 1 mile. I headquarters, 160 feet.
Walked with baby, 1 rod. Walked during forenoon,
Total for day, 16 Vs miles 1 1 00 ice

Walked from streetcar
to house, 'JOO feet.
Bicycle ride. 10 miles.

Total for day, about 27

Here is a fine field for the cumulative
story-teller, for the difference in the length
of steps varies much. In China the Ji
(small) is .486 inches, and the small-footed
woman's pedal ic exploits can be individu
ally described with not more than ten lis.
In Cochin China the women may step
one throe, or 19.2 inches, at one time. In
Denmark the woman who can step off
three fods, or 3.06 feet, is a wonder. The
Abyssinian woman strides about one pic,
or 28.6 inches. In Baden a step means two
fusses, the fuss being 11.81 inches long.
At the Cape of Good Hope the foot is only
11.616 inches long. Estimating the aver
age length of women's steps all over toe
globe at , two . feet ana men's at two and
a half feet, the figures for one day run like
this :
739,858,990 women take 1,993,270,683,100
steps.
739,858,990 men take 2,989,906,024,650
steps.
Total daily steps, 983,176,707,750.
. Allowing that each step means a rise of
the sole three inches, the total mle of
daily footsteps would amount ;to 14,949,
-530.133,250 inches, or 1,245.795,010,254 feet,
or 235,945,835 miles. Pile up these steps for
thirty years, an average life, , and they
would reach a distance of 2,593,139,393,250
miles. This reminds one that it is just as
well to tell a good story while about it.
Mrs. Lovey Aldrich of San Diego, Who Knew Washingtoi
[From a photograph by Frank B. Schutz.]
SHE WAS BORN IN 1800
There Is a woman in San Diego whose
memory takes her back to the days when
this Nation was young â when Jefferson
and Hamilton and Adams and Lafayette
were at the pinnacle of their greatness,
and when the Father of His Country was
talked ab ut as just having gone to his
eternal rest. She is Mrs. Lovey Aldrich,
who was 96 years old on March 29 last.
With her youngest son, Edwin C. Aldrich,
who is a gray-haired man of 56, and his
wife, Mrs. Aldrich, she lives at 918 E
street.
Mrs. Aldrich is the widow of a Revolu

records of the Government at Washington
be is set down as having been "a private
of the Rhode Island Line of War, 1776."
He fought against the British under Wash
ington, and there is caught to show that
he was not a valiant warrior.
Mr. Aldrich was born in 1762 and had
buried three wives when he married the
present Mrs. Aldrich in 1833. She was
then 33 years old and had four little chil

whom she was married in 1821. Mr. Clark
was a private in the New Hampshire "line
of infantry and fought in the war of 1812.
After his marriage to Mrs. Clark he lived
at Sanbornton, N. H., until 1828, when he
died. Alter her marriage in 1833 to Caleb

A CURIOUS SCIENCE
Among the curious sciences of the day
psychometry holds quite a prominent posi
tion. According to the students of oc
cultism, there is nothing called into ex
istence without making a permanent
record of its presence, even such an in
tangible thing as a thought or a posture
leaving such an impress on nature that it
can be recognized thousands of years aft
rerwad. It is asserted that surrounding
the earth there is a vast tenacious mass of
substance, invisible to ordinary sight,
known as the astral light. This is
said to become visible when there
is a certain psychic development
in the observer. It appears as a
white or starry light, hence it is termed
astral. The statement is made that this
light preserves a photographic character,
and that every event that occurs on earth
is caught on this sensitive plate of na
ture and recorded there, so that it may be
observed and read by those abie to explore
that plane. Not only are objects and
events recorded here, but also all thoughts
and ideas.
Every one who is at all clairvoyant
makes his psychic observations in this
astral light, but tor the psychometer there
is a still further process, for he asserts that
the astral light also rephotographs the
pictures within every molecule of physical
matter that happens to be in the neigh
borhood. Whether this theory can be
scientifically veriried at the present time,
it at least offers a reasonable working
hypothesis for the experiments made by
psychometers.
A psychometer will take a piece of stone,
for instance, and placing it to his forehead
will see and describe all the event", cover
ing thousands of years, that occurred in
the vicinity of that stone. Or by fixing
his mind on a certain place he can come
en rapport with it and trace the past his
tory of that locality to an almost illimita
ble extent.
Unfortunately the psychometer some
times gets mixed up in his surroundings,
so unless collateral testimony can be ob
tained his observations are not always
trustworthy. Nevertheless, it seems an
important branch of study for those who
possess the peculiar fitness for its pursuit,
and many curious facts have been gleaned
by it regarding the past.
A Chicago psychometer in 1867 took a
piece of rock that had been picked up at
Columbia, Tuolumne County, CaL, near
tne Stanislaus River, and placing it to his
forehead he saw a herd of twenty large
elephants running along a path in the
woods occasionally twining their trunks
around small trees and pulling them ud
by the roots. The psychometer gave the
following description: "Now they are at
the water drinking. A great alligator
comes out of the water and with open
mouth runs at one of the elephants. The
elephant hits him on the head with his
trunk and the alligator crawls off. Now I
see Indians sticking spears into the ele
phants. They have killed a number now,
but the elephants are still running.
'â¢Why! there was a tremendous noise
just then underground! The trees bend
over; the elephants run; the ground is
cracking. I see it heave nearly like the
ocean. A good many trees have fallenâ
the rotten ones. Now another s^ockâ a
hard one. One elephant fell down. The
band Simon, aged 62, a resident of Illinois,
is the only surviving one.
Mrs. Aldrich, although lacking less
than four years of being a centenarian,
appears to be s-carcely more than 80. She
was of medium size in her younger years,
but old age has somewhat withered her
form, but without leaving many wrinkles
on her clear-cut face. Her mind is won
derfully clear and her sight and hearing
good.
Her statements in conversation are ex
ceedingly clear.and a witty remark dropped
by the venerable woman now and then
brings a smile to the face of her son and
surprise to the interviewer,
"Yes, I remember the war of 1812," she
said. "My brother was dratted for that
war, but he couldn't go, and so another
brother went.
"We raised flax in those days and spun
our own cloth. We didn't have all the
machinery of to-day, but I will say that
people had some sense to get up the
machinery. Even if we had had machines
then we couldn't have run them so glib
as they do now. And bicycles! I don't
think I could ride one of them. They
may be all right for men, and I've heard
tell that a man can ride a bicycle up hill.
Laws !
"Yes, I knew Daniel Webster â and ha
could driDk brandy, too. His farm wasn't
so veiy far from our town, right jinin',
you mi ht say. He was rather shortish
and thickset, and laws! what speeches he
could make. I never saw any of the other
public men of those days, but many's the
time I've heard of them. They're all dead
now I suppose."
Indians are running in all directions.
The ground rose up as if there was
something under it; it has made a large
hill. Oh ! there is a volcano at the top of
it; a large black cloud rose out of it at first.
Stones are flying in the air; lava is run
ning down the sides, which are very steep.
It sends up redhot stones and lava very
high. Now one side of the mountain has
broken away, and a/iverof lava is run
ning out. There is such a noise I cannot
hear myself speak. A stone falls near me ;
it is as big as a sewing machine. Yet the
volcano must be three miles off. How
curious it was to see that hill rise ! It went
up so fast! Trees went up with it and
they are on fire."
Professor William Denton, the eminent
geologist, in commenting upoD the above
report, said that "discoveries made very
recently prove it to be the fact that human
beings lived in California when this lava
stream was poured out, and that huge ele
phantine quadrupeds then browsed on the
forest trees."
In addition to Professor Denton's testi
mony, Professor Whitney, State Geologist
of California, exhibited in 1868, at Chicago,
before the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, a human skull,
said to have been obtained in Calaveras
County, at a depth of 180 feet below the
surface, and under four beds of consoli
dated volcanic ash or lava. The skull
bore a remarkable resemblance to that of
a Digger Indian. Professor Whitney in
sisted most strongly that this skull, to
gether with other data collected by geo
logical survey, clearly demonstrated
the fact that man and the mastodon and
elephant had been contemporaneous in
California.
The same specimen of rock was sub
mitted by Professor Denton to two other
psychometersâ his wife and sisterâ and
while their examinations differed in some
details from the one quoted above, yet
they quite agreed on the main features of
the volcano and the elephants and pre-
Adamic man, so that the account may be
accepted as part of the ancient history of
California.
It is natural for scientists to look with
distrust upon such observations as this,
and while it may be readily admitted that
many accounts of psychometric experi
ment are untrustworthy and charlatan
esque, yet where there is notonly corrobora
tion by independent seers, but also by the
investigations of leading scientists as well,
it is not unreasonable to suppose that
there may be an exact science underlying.
Students of the occult sciences ure satisfied
that this power of vision, along with other
faculties, lies latent in every human being
âwhere not already evolvedâ and that a
considerable development of these is to
take place during the twentieth century.
A student of psychometry makes the
assertion that "a personal relic of Shakes
peare may in half an hour reveal more of

THE PRIZE
POEM
THE STORY OF A YOUNG WRITERS,
TEMPTATION.
BY JUDITH SPENCER.
"Write a poem ! I never can !"
"Nor I!"
"Nor I!"
"Perhaps it won't be so hard after all.
And we've three whole weeks to do it in,
you know," said Ned Martin.
"Oh, yes; we all know it's easy enough
for you to write, Ned," said Jack Dale.
"And as yon always get the composition
prize, of course you'll win it again this
time."
"I'm not so certain," said Ned, jauntily.
But the boys all agreed that it was "a
dead sure thing!" and Ned soon began to
think so himself. It was just after
school and the boys had assembled in the
big hall to talk things over before they
separated for the rest of the day.
During the last hour Mr. Dean had given
out that their next composition was to be
in the form of a poem ; and each Doy had
drawn a folded paper containing his sub
ject, which was to De kept to himself, and
he was to write his verses without consult
ing any one and without outside help.
Each was also to sign an assumed name,
so that even Mr. Dean should not know
who the writer \ras until after the an
nouncement of the prize-winner. On the
appointed day the best poem was to be
read aloud, and when the signature was
afterward read out, the boy to whom it
belonged was to rise.
There was much talk about the forth
coming poems as the days passed on, and
much groaning and comic despair. Evi
dently the latent genius that Mr. Dean
was hopeful of discovering wa3 too well
hidden to be easily brought to light, or
perhaps was lacking altogether.
" Among the boys the opinion was, as it
had been from the first, that Ned Martin
was sure to win, for he was always a clever
fellow with his pen. And Ned did not
contradict them, for now he was most
anxious to get the prize and keep up his
reputation for cleverness. But still, two
days before the appointed time for hand
ing in the compositions he was as far from
having written his poem as ever.
His subject was "Content," and he had
not found the theme inspiring. Ideas
would not come, words would not rhyme
and there was no such thing in him as
rhythm!
It was raining hard that afternoon and
the ball game had been put off. Not know
ing just what to do Ned had betaken him
self at last to the attic and was rummag
ing through an old chestful of things that
had belonged to his father wnen he was
a boy.
And there he came across a little old
tattered book, without covers or title page,
yellow with age and dampness, and in
this â on one of those yellowed pages â he
found a printed poem, just what he wanted
to say, and in words so plain and simple
that it seemed as if any schoolboy might
have written it. Here are the lines:
Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound.
Content to breath his native air
In his own ground.
Whose herds with milk, whose fields with
bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire;
Whose trees in summer yield him shade;
In winter, fire.
Blest, who can unconcernedly find
Hours, days and years slide soft away
In health of body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day.
Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Toftether mixed ; sweet recreation,
And Innocence, which most does please
With meditation.
Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me die;
eteal from the world, and not a stone
/ell where I lie.
Ned felt a sudden temptation to copy it,
all but the last verse, which he did not like,
making one or two changes in the words,
perhaps, and to hand it in for his own
poem. The book, whatever it was, was so
IN
CHILHOOD`S
REALM
very old that there was not one chance in
a thousand that Mr. Dean had ever seen it
or would ever discover the fraud. And
Ned now felt certain that he had wanted to
say something just like this all along, only
the ideas and the words would not quite
come.
The boy was not naturally dishonest or
deceitful, but he had never been so tempted
before, and he did want to keep up his
brilliant record and get the prize. ThiÃwas
his only chance, he thought, and so he
copied the verses, and the next morning he
dropped the carefully folded paper into
the box that had been set np to receive the
compositions.
But it had no sooner left his hands than
he would have given all the world to re
call it. Not till then did the full realiza
tion of what he had done come over him.
He bad stolen another's work and claimed
it as his own. What did it matter that
the real author was dead and forgotten
long ago, the theft was just as bad and
Ned was miserably unhappy.
He tried to see Mr. Dean after school,
i but Mr. Dean had an engagement and had
hurried out. He had only one hope now,
and that was that some of the other boys
had written something so much better
that his poem would be quite eclipsed and
so be passed over without notice. It did
not seem likely, but still Ned fervently
hoped that it micht turn out so, and he
resolved that never again should the hope
of a prize or of anything else whatever
tempt him to depart from the straight
path of honesty.
The morning of the decision came and
the boys were all assembled in the big
hall. As soon as the prayers were ended,
Mr. Dean stood up and looked about him.
He hesitated for a moment and then said,
very slowly and distinctly:
"Without question, the best of all the
poems that have been handed in is signed
by 'Pinta Max.' "
Ned's heart leaped, for that signature
was his, and he knew that he had won â by
fraud! But no, he would not take the
prize; he would stand up and confess what
he had done, here and now, before them
all.
Before he could move or speak, however,
Mr. Dean went slowly on.
"But I do not award the prize to 'Pinta
Max' for a reason that is known only to
him and to myself."
There was an audible movement of sur
prise among the boys and Ned bowed his
guilty face, sure that his burning cheeks
would betray him.
Mr. Dean went on without a pause.
The fictitious name of the prize-winner
was announced, the poem was read and
the unknown writer â who proved to be
Jack Dale â was requested to come upon
the platform and receive the prize.
Ned never knew how he lived through
the rest of that awful morning. He
suffered horribly, and the moment recess
came he broke away from his compan-
I ions and sought out Mr. Dean.
Mr. Dean listened in silence to his con
fession of how perfectly miserable he had
been ever since the stolen verses had left
hjs hands, and how he would have done
anything in his power to recall sucn a
cowardly, dishonest act, even though he
bad not for a moment dreamed of its dis
covery.
Then Mr. Dean smiled gravely.
"My boy," he said, "in that old yellow
book you chanced upon one of the classics
"of our language, and the verses that you
so thoughtlessly stole and tried to im
prove upon were written by no less a poet
than Alexander Pope. But your sin
against your own honesty has brought
with it a lesson and its own sufficient
punishment, and I think 1 know you well
enough to be sure that nothing could
tempt you to try any such deceit again."
W T hen Ned and Mr. Dean came out of
the study together they met Jack Dale,
glad and triumphant, and a troup of his
admiring friends â all mystified and still
wondering who "Pinta Max" could be
and why the best poem had failed to win
the prize.
"Hello, Ned, I never was so surprised!"
cried Jack. "I thought you'd get it,
sure."
"Iâ Iâ" Ned stammered, flushing pain
fully.
But Mr. Dean laid a reassuring hand
upon Ned's shoulder.
"Ned may win some other time," he
said, kindly, "but for this competition he
failed to compose a poem." â Philadelphia
Times.
A LOST COAT
A Story for Tiny Folks. Written by a Little Girl.
"Mamma, mamma, Oh, mamma, did
you see my coat?"
These were the words 1 heard a little
boy cry out to his mother one pleasant
morning not long ago.
All the children were going to a picnic.
Little Georgie had been invited, too, and
was all ready but his coat, and it, alas,
was missing.
"Now, mamma, they will all be gone
and I shall have to stay at home I"
â¢â¢Who wore your coat yesterday ? Did I,
Georgie?" quietly asked his mother.
"I did, myself," answered the child.
"Well, my dear little boy, you should be
more careful. Now, go ana look for it."
â¢'Oh, mamma, you know I left it right
on that chair and somebody has taken it!"
"That dreadful somebody!" exclaimed
Mrs. Curtis.
This was not the first time that Georgie
had had to look for his things, so now his
mother wished to teach him a lesson.
"Well, dear, mother's very sorry, but if
yon cannot find your coat you cannot go
to the picnic, because I do not wish you to
come home sick."
So upstairs and downstairs, in closets
and trunks, behind doors and under beds,
Georgie hunted and searched, but no coat
could he find.
Then he gave up all hope of being in
time to start with the others for the picnic
grounds, and instead of sulking and cry
ing he thought he'd go and have a good
play with his pet dog, Fido, in the garden,
but strange to relate Fido could not be
found either.
"Fido! Fido! Fido!" called Georgie at
the top of his voice as he ran here and
there through the yard.
He was just about to think his dog was
really lost, like his coat, when he saw him
over in one corner stretching his legs and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
gaping as if he had at that moment awak
ened from a very sound sleep.
As soon as he got his eyes wide open
and saw his little master he wagged his
tail and barked "bow-wow-wow," which
was his way of saying "good-morning."
"Oh! you dear doggie, where have you
been? I'm in lots of trouble, Fido; I can't
find my coat. Did you see anything of it?
And Georgie took the dog in his arms as
he poured into his sympathizing ears the
story of his woes.
"Mamma, mamma*! Come here, quick!"
be suddenly shouted.
Mrs. Curtis came running quickly to see
what could be the matter.
"Oh, mamma, Fido smells just like my
coat! I had peppermint lozenges yester
day, and his hair is full of the smell of
peppermint!"
"Well, my boy, find the place where
Fido slept last n?ght, and your coat may
be there too."
So over he ran to the box in the corner,
and there, sure enough, was the missing
garment.
So the dreadful "somebody" who had
taken the coat was his own little pt=t dog,
who had not been satisfied with only a
blanket for a bed.
Now whenever Georgie blames "some
body" for taking his things, his mother
tells him to go and look in Ficlo's box.

A story that comes from German\ T is as
quaint as it is true. Some children living
in one of the northern provinces dis
covered that a stork had made its nest
upon their roof. Being orthodox little
Teutons they hailed the newcomer with
favor, as storks are supnosed to bring luck
to a house. All the summer they shared
tidbits with their long-legged friend,
which became very tame and companion
able.
At the first signs of approaching cold
weather the stork prepared to flit to
warmer climes. The children were sad at
the thought of losing their pet, but their
parents consoled them with the assurance
that the bird would surely return the next
spring. The children, still uneasy at the
idea of the stork's not being cared for
through the long winter, consulted to
gether and evolved a brilliant idea, which
they immediately proceeded to put into
execution. They wrote a little note in
their bost German script, stating that the
stork was very dear to them and begging
the good people in whose country it might
spend the winter to be kind to their pet
and send it back to them in the spring.
They sealed the note, fastened it to a
ribbon, tied it round the bird's neck and
tucked it under its wing. The next day
they sadly watched the stork wing its way
towards milder skies. The snow and ice
came; Christmas time brought the chil
dren gifts and fresh amusements, but their
summer pet was not forgotten. When the
spring came round again their little feet
used to climb to the roof day by day, look
ing and longing for the stork's return ;
and behold ! one fine morning tliere it was,
tame and gentle as ever.
Great was the children's delight; but
what was their surprise to discover round
its neck and under its wing another bright
band with a note attached, addressed to
"the children who wrote the letter the
stork brought."
The ribbon was quickly untied and the
missive opened. It was from a missionary
in Africa, stating that he had read the
children's note and had cared for tne
stork, and thought that children whose
good hearts had prompted them to pro
vide for the comfort of a bird through the
winter would be willing to help clothe and
feed the little destitute children of his
mission. A full name and address fol

A True Story
Of a Wild Goose That
Was Not Such
A Big Goose -
After All.
One day while two gentlemen were out
hunting they found a nest containing a
couple of wild-goose eggs.
The hunters were very kind, for, as they
passed our house on their return to town,
they stopped and gave the eggs to my
mother.
She set them under a turkey hen, and in
three weeks two beautiful green goslings
were hatched.
I shall describe them carefully, for may
be you little City boys have never seen the
young of the wild geese.
When they first came from the shell they
were green, with tmy black spots on their
heads, and had very black eyes.
As they grew larger dark gray feathers
appeared and their necks became very
long and black, with a white patch under
their jaws which reminded me very
strongly of the time I had the toothache
and had to have a handkerchief tied
around my face.
\ou may wonder how it was that they
stayed on the farm with Washoe Lake so
near by. Well, to tell you the truth, my
mother cut their wings at the first joint,
and although it must have hurt a great
deal the dear little things never even
winked.
By this time they looked so much alike
that mother declared they must be twin
brothers and called them "Bob and Mike."
They were always together until one sad
day, when they were out in the field. It
was very stormy. A hunter came along
and thinking they were wild geese seeking
shelter from the rain fired and shot Bob.
A few of his feathers is all we have left of
our strange pet.
Poor Mike was so scared that he hid
under a sagebrush for two days and
nights. We had given up all hope of his
coming out when, to our great joy, he ap
peared in the yard.
We all felt very sorry over the loss of
Bob, but our grief was nothing compared
to poor "Mike's."
All day long the lonely bird wandered
around the poultry-yard with no compan
ion, and, seemingly, with no object in
life.
One bright morning we noticed that
Mike was busy ; a change oeemed to have
come over him.
We watched him very closely, and dis
covered that he was building a beautiful
nest, comfortably lined with soft feather s.
Oh, how important and happy he was!
When we next visited the place we were
much surprised to find that Mike had laid
five wonderful eggs, though they were not
the "golden eggs."
Every day for five long weeks the goose
sat on these eeg3 without any sign of their
hatching. At last mamma felt sorry for
Mike and thought she would surprise
the patient bird. So one morning while
Mike was eating breakfast, the slipped the
five bad eggs out of the nest and put five
pretty little baby ducks in their place.
But mother was very badly fooled when
she thought Mike couldn't tell the differ
ence between a young duck and a gosling,
for from the moment the goose returned
to its nest the air was filled with scolding,
and each duck was lifted by the neck and
thrown out on the ground. Mamma
quietly picked them up and took them
back to their own mother, while Mine
slowly strutted off to the fields in a way
which expressed great indignation.
A long time has passed and Mike has
never succeed ed in hatching any goslings,
but we all love the bird very much and it
is a great pet with every one about the
place.
Now, my friends, do you think geese are
really so silly as they are generally sup
posed to be. Henhy Sagebbush.
THE WELAKA RIVER.
History of One of the Most Inter
esting of American Streams.
The historic Welaka river, the modern
St. Johns, is to the- stranger one of the
I most interesting; rivers on the American
i continent. It is unique in many particu
lars which go to make up a river. Find
ing its source in the far south, it flows
northward for nearly all its length, until,
reaching the metropolis of Florida, it
turns eastward and pours its great volume
jof waters into the ocean. This fact seems
j the most strange since the universal opin
j ion prevails that the extreme South is low
and flat, and would leave the impression
I that the river ran up hill as it cuts its way
through the much higher land of our
I northern boundary.
This, however, is a minor point of inter
est compared with the wild appearance it
presents to the eye of the stranger as first
he beholds it with its somber cypress al
most awaking superstition, and the swamp
hickory with its peculiar foliage and small
but rich sweet nut, upon wnich the far
famed razor-back hog, alike with the
beautiful gray squirrel, feasts in profound
silence, but doubtless with voracious ap
petite. A large part of the shore on each
hand conveys an idea of vastness of ex
panse, because impenetrable to the eye.
This somber scene is relieved by the
stately palmetto, on which are often fes
tooned from tree to tree the wild con
volvuli. When seen in the early morn, as
the palatial steamers, seagoing and river,
swiftly make their way up and down the
majestic stream, these turn their beautiful
cup-shaped flowers white as snow toward
the coming king of day sparkling with
dewdrops.
The broad savannas occasionally lie al
most, apparently, on the level of the river
itself. On these queer formations abound
wild flowers of every hue, shape and bo
tanical order, making one vast picture,
framed in the surrounding forests, en
livened ail over with birds of every hue
and sweet song, while the strong, green
growths present a tropical vigor of life
which is really an inspiration to health
and strength. â Jacksonville Times-Union.
Age Should Be Tranquil.
One's age should be tranquil, says Dr.
Arnold, as one's childhood should be play

human existence seerrsto me out of place;
the morning and evening should be' alike
cool and peaceful; at midday the sun may
burn, ana men may labor under it.
THE LETTER
BOX
Dedicated to a wee girlie with a dolls-house.
Dear Pitti Sing:
As I have time
I send a letter, writ in rhyme.
To say that Dinah 's very blue,
Because she stays so long from you.
I've set her in the corner back-
She gives me looks so very black.
(She needn't feel so very mad,
But thankful be that she is clad).
Does Mr. Gray still lose his hat?
And is the baby growing fat?
Does Wv Chin sweep the kitchen clean?
If not, she thinks he's very mean;
And, I'm afraid, when she gets back
From that same broom he'll feel a whack!
She has a pair of new kid shoes ;
They hurt her feetâ she would get twos.
Her dress is blue. She wears no shirt,
But has the new divided skirt.
Her collarette is small and bright;
Her turban is a gorgeous sight !
The dressmaker that you engaged
For Louisette is in a rage,
Because the pattern that your ma
Thought fine looks too wide by far.
The pinking-iron cannot be found,
Nor silk enough to go around.
The wardrobe now is all in bits â
Impossible to make parts fit-
But when they meet the "Automatic"
They'll rush together quite ecstatic.
Next Saturday you must come down
To spend the day with me in town.
Then I'll return with you, to stay
A week at lovely Fontenay.
We'll chat a little, sew and sing-
Try every sort of pleasant thingâ
A walk to school, a party gay,
A reading-lesson every day.
The week will much too short be found ;
But Christmas day will soon come round,
And my surprise
Will make you open wide your eyes.
Between these lines, love and a kiss
To share with that dear little miss
Who teases me and plays with you.
Now love to all, and so adieu.
I'll send this off without delay.
From your godmother, Marian A.
Bloomfield. Cal., June 16, 1896.

THE MIRACLE OF
PROFESSOR LANGLEY.
A Wonderful Man-Made
Monster That Soars in
Midair.
Light Thrown on the Most Re
markable Mechanical Mys
tery of the Age.
Description of an Eye-Witness Who
Sf-w che Flying-Machine in Suc
cessful Operation.
When the startling news was made pub
lic by Professors Bell and Langley that
the latter's flying machine did on the 6th
of May, 1896, actually fly, everybody in
the world was excited to know the partic
ulars. The two eminent scientists would
only say that their flying machine did fly,
and that the experiment was made near
Occquan.
The reticence of the professors may
have been pardonable fiom their point of
view, but it was exceedingly exasperating
to the world at large, and a correspondent
of the Pittsburg Dispatch set out to locate
the place and get a pen picture of the won
derful machine.
Alter various vicissitudes the secret
workshop of these modern magicians was
discovered on an island in the Potomac
River, and is described as follows:
Hid away in a secluded cove at the
edge of the marsh, unsuspected until one
came close to it, was the "ark," in which
has been fondled a flying creature, which
will be of far greater significance to the
future of humanity than the dove which
winged its way from the Ark of Noah.
The "ark" suggests a sort of boathouse.
Upon an ordinary flatboat, or scow, a
cabin has been built, almost as wide as
and two-thirds the length of the vessel.
Three windows in each side have strong
board shutters, which are closed and se
curely fastened when the engineers are
absent. So, also, at such times the heavy
do r is secured with a big padlock.
The interior is an unknown world to all
save the inventor and his assistants.
Here some parts of the mysterious winged
creature are made, and the whole is fitted
together when an experiment is to be tried.
Upon the top of the cabin is a curious
framework that revolves on wheels like a
turntable. Upon tliis frame the aerodrome
is placed when ready for flight, and its
head is turnea toward that point from
which bows the most advantageous wind.
A portion of the frame which works upon
hinges, or loose joints, is then raised by
leverage to lift the airship clear of all ob
struction, steam is let on. and slowly and
stately the monster bird rises in the air.
One who has s- en the aer irome in va
rious stages of development gave to the
writer a much more satisfactory account
of the latest performance than that made
public by the inventor. As a neighbor to
the island he has had unsought opportu
nities to learn facts which he describes as
foilows:
"This flying machine, as it is called, has
pas.-cd through many changes since I saw
the early experiment, but it is changed
less in form than in material, the last
form, which gave such astonishingly suc
ces.-ful results, being by far the lightest in
weight, while presenting a much larger
wins? surface in comparison to the weight.
"The wings, or planes, are about four
teen feet from tip to tip, are of fine steel
rolled almost as thin as paper, are guyed
or stayed with fine wire and are some
what similar in shape to the outstretched
wings of a bird. The engine and propel
ling wheels, which are so diminutive they
look iike toys, are placed centrally under
the wings, like the body of a bird, and
serve a purpose similar to that of ballast
in a marine vessel. In fact the aerodrome
is but an air vessel possessing many of the
characteristics of a sea-going vessel. It is
both flying fowl and swimming fish.
"I happened accidentally to be placed in
a position to witness the experiment of the
6th of May. My heart jumped into my
mouth as the toy naphtha engine began
to revolve its little wheels and vent its
hiss like the whisper of a zephyr. Slowly
the great bird began to sail away. Grace
fully as the eajrle and with as sublime a
confidence in itself as the eagle feels the
strange creature rose higher and higher,
choosing a circular course for some rea
son I cannot explain. The circle included
almost the area of the island and the
highest flight was probably 150 feet. Twice
it traversed this circular path, soaring
more steadily than the frightened buz
zards, which watched it from far away,
and then its motion was retarded by the
lessening pressure of the steamer. Start
ing slowly on its descent it swung once
more around a segment of the circle, and
gradually and gently as a feather is wafted
downward till it settled into the shal
low water. It had not sustained the least
injury.
"A second time the bird of steel was
placed upon the framework from which it
started. The tiny reservoir was filled with
flui(', the steam began its little hiss, tne
signal was given, the lever was moved,
the wheels began to revolve. The course
this time varied from the other, but the
phenomena of flight were similar, the alti
tude reached being perhaps a little higher.
The remarkable feature of the perform
ance was that after the steam was ex
hausted and the propellers ceased to
move, there was no disturbance of the
equanimity of the machine. Its outspread
wings balanced perfectly, and its approach
to the water was on the line of a gently
inclined plane. The professors, mechanics
and photographers who caught the bird
in its flight were wild with delight at the
wonderful success of the experiment."
"What do you suppose will be the next
move of Langley and Bell?"
"From what I overheard I am assured
that they will at once begin the construc
tion of a large machine, with at least a
one-man carrying capacity, and a steam
or electric motor with sufficient lasting
power for a thorough test. The present
machine, even with its spread of fourteen
feet, may be called a mere toy, as it
scarcely weighs more than thirty pounds.
I shall bs greatly surprised if within the
next year we do not witness the spectacle
of aerodromes in grand flight with full
grown men at the helm. The safety and
practicability of the invention seem now
so well demonstrated that I think of ap
plying for the honor of being the first en
gineer to take flight with the big bird of
steel." ____________

REMARKABLE SPEED
OF A TIDAL WAVE.
Indications on This Coast of a Dis
turbance More Rfcent Than
the Japan Disaster.
Pecuiar Action of the Gauge at Sausa
lito-Pencil Registered What
Could Not Be Seen.
The tidal disturbances observed at Van
couver Island and at New River, in Men
docino County, within the past few days,
indicate unerringly, according to the gen
tlemen locally connected witu the Coast
and Geodetic Survey, that one or more
earthquakes have taken place since the
awlul wave that caused the loss of 30,000
or more lives at Yesso. The exact date of
the tidal disturbance at Vancouver Island
is uot known, so thai there may be a ques
tion whether the manifestations there and
at New River worked the same natural
convulsion. The register attached to the
tide gauge at Bausalito told of the Yesso
calamity before many of the facts had
been received by cable. But the extent of
the information traced on the maregram
at Sausalito, as it is called, was only that
there had been an earthquake which had
caused the ocean to undulate in an un
! usual way. The observer at Sausalito re
ports that when the pencil attached to the
. tide register was recording the Japanese
I tidal wave he could not see anything un
-1 usual in the appearance of the water.
Earthquake waves or those given rise by
earthquakes are transmitted with iuch
; enormous speed that the Japan disaster
I was recorded at Sausalito about twelve
hours after it occurred.
There are valuable records in the office
of the Coa3t and Geodetic Survey which
show beyond question that a speed of six
miles a minute, or 360 miles an hour, ia to
| be expected under such conditions.
The overwhelming of Simoda, a town on
the island of Niphon, appears to have
been almost a complete parallel in physi
cal manifestations with the recent occur
rence at Yesso. On the 23d of December,
1854, a sharp earthquane shock was felt in
Simoda and upon the shipping at 9a. m.
This was followed at quick intervals for
half an hour. At 9:30 the sea was ob
served washing into the bay in one im
mense wave, thirty feet high, with awful
velocity.
In an instant the town of Simoda was
overwhelmed and swept high from its foun
dations. This advance and recession of
the water occurred many times. The
Russian frigate Diana was hurled about by
the rising and falling oi the waters, which
varied from less than eight feet to more
than forty feet.
Captain H. A. Adams wrote of the
Simoda disaster that the sea rose five
fathoms above its usual height, '"overflow
ing the town and carrying houses and
temples before it in its retreat. When it
fell it left but four feet of water in the
harbor. It rose and sank this way, five or
six times, covering the shores of the bay
with the wreck of boats, junks and build
ings. Only sixteen houses were left stand
ing in the whole place. The entire coast
of Japan seems to have suffered."
That terrific happening was recorded by
the tide register at San Francisco twelve
i hours and thirty-eight minutesjater. The
distance between Simoda and San Fran
cisco is 4527 nautical miles. The wave
j transmission varied, according to two
estimates, from 358 miles per hour to 370
miles per hour or 6.2 miles per minute,
which is about six times faster than the
most speedy railroad train travels.
The tide-gauge was established at Fort
Point about 3852 and was removed to Sau
salito by Professor George Davidson in
1877. The first large earthquake wave re
corded on the nauge at this port was that
of Simoda. The great convulsion at Kra
katoa, in the Strait of Sunda, which took
place only a few years ago, was registered
at the Sausalito tide-gauge, and the news
that a great earthquake had occurred was
made public by Professor Davidson weeks
before the information was otherwise
known. From calculations based on the
record made by the tide-gauge at Fort
Point after the Simoda disaster of 1854 the
Coast and Geodetic Survey estimated the
average depth of the Pacific Ocean, and the
accuracy of the estimate has been subse
quently demonstrated by deep-sea sound
ings. It is an interesting fact, in view of
the recent calamity at Yesso, that the loss
of life by earthquake disturbances up to
1896 on thÂ« entire earth has been at least
13,000,000.

COMBINED HEARSE AND CARRIAGE.
The spirit In favor of funeral reforms is growing constantly, and an invention in this direc
tion is the combined hearse and carriage by the use of which the cost of funerals will be cut
down by 50 or 60 per cent. As will be seen in the cut the receptacle for the coffin Is on top of
the carriage, and the place below for the friends and relatives. There is also a private com
partment for the immediate relatives of the deceased. The idea is patented by Eugene Cook
of New York.

THEY CAPTURED A
REAL SEA SERPENT.
Seventeen Feet Long and Weighs
One Hundred and Fifty-
Four Pounds.
Smooth Skin, With Spots Like These
of a Rattlesnake â Ferocious
as a Tiger.
The sea serpent has at last been taken
alive in his native haunt, or rather from
his native haunt, if this the placid waters
of Puget Sound can be called the haunt,
of such an animal, where the majestic
snow-clad Mount Tacoma towering as a
sentinel gives a picture nowhere equaled
on the North American continent.
A porpoise finds his way into the sound
from'ttie Pacific, and occasionally a whale
is seen spouting, but the sea serpent was
never thought of until two Tacoma fisher
men, R. E. McClean and W. J. Kennedy,
while fishing for black bass about two
miles north of the Humi Humi River,
which empties into Hoods Canal near this
city, made the catch. They were along
side a ledge where the water drops off 100
to 150 feet deep, and were using minnows
for bait, when their attention was
attracted to a commotion in the
net, and the water becoming agi
tated was followed immediately by the
head of the monster appearing above the
surface. This struck terror to the already
frightened fishermen, who at once made
for the shore, dragging it after them and
hauling it up on the beach.
The monster was as ferocious *s a tiger,
and bit and snapped the gaff stick in
pieces, and when hauled on the beach
rushed back over the sands with the 100
feet of line and swam out to sea as far as
it could go. The reptile was seventeen
feet long and as big around as a man's
body, and has every characteristic of the
snake except the head, which is much
like that of the pugnacious bulldog. The
under jaw is heavy and covered with
skin, the eyes are as large as a man's and
as bright, and will follow the movements
of a person as closely as the eyes of
a cat follow a mouse, and without
the animal ever moving its head. The
general color of the serpent is darkish
blue, with spots much like those of a rat
tlesnake, the spots fading out into lighter
blue at the circumference. The skin is
â mooth like that of the snake. The mon
ster is finned much like the halibut, hav
ing a long dorsal, very thin, running down

the back, while underneath there is a sim
ilar fin, but only near the caudal extrem
ity. The animal's jaws are set with rows
of sharp teeth, like those of a cat, and the
great strength of the jaw enables it to
sink its fangs to the base in a stick of
wood.
Immediately on its capture the animal
was lariated near where captured, and the
water was lashed into foam in its efforts
to escape. McClean and Kennedy say
they are positive it is the sea serpent
which has so long worried the marine
world.
In the water, they say, the reptile looks
larger than it really is, and from this fact
lies much of the exaggeration from those
who claim to have seen sea serpents. They
say that such a monster as they have
taken swimming alongside arowboat with
raised head would turn the oldest and
bravest fisherman's hair gray.
It has not been fed any since its capture,
and subsists on whatever it can find within
the radius of the water within the rope's
length. The fishermen have been relieved
of their burden by Gilbert Girard, the ac
tor, who happened to stop this way on his
way East and who intends presenting the
monster to the Smithsonian Institution.

J. L. Kerr insists on the inferior value
of boiled milk compared with uncooked as
a food. The latter is lanrely composed of
living cells, which are, he~th"inks, absorbed
alive, and enter the circulation without
change. This view is supported by the
work of Koplik, who showed that the un
absorbed nitrogen iti the feces is much
greater after a meal of cooked than after
one of raw milk. Other writers, however,
have found a more rapid increase in weight
in children fed on boiled or sterilized milk
than in those fed on raw.
HOW FAR CAN THE
EARTH BE PENETRATED?
Proposition Made in France
to Travel in a Straight
Line.
Colonel Hennebert Gives Inter
esting Facts Showing Its
Impossibility.
Man's Limit of Ascension Appears
Equal to the Depth He Can
Penetrate.
Under this title, Colonel Hennebert con
tributes to La Nature (Paris, May 23) a
criticism of the proposition which, it
seems, has been made in France with some
show of seriousness, to travel from place
to place in a straight line by tunneling be
neath the earth's surface instead of follow
ing along that surface, which compels us
at present to move in a curve. ' Such a tun
nel, although accurately straight, would be
"down hill" for half its length and "up
hill" for the remaining half, hence most of
the distance oould be covered by means of
gravity alone. Colonel Hennebert con
cludes that this project is impossible of
realization, for reasons which will appear
from the following extracts, translated
from his article. After allusions to Jules
Verne's fantastic tale, "A Journey to the
Center of the Earth," he goes on to say:
"This geographic romance is charming
from one end to the other, but it is after
all only a romance, and since people will
persist in desiring to penetrate the mys
teries of the interior of our planet it is best
to disabuse these curious adventurers.
The best means to dampen their ardor by
means of a curative douche is to demon
strate to them mathematically the impos
sibility of a journey of this kind, an im
possibility that should have been revealed
to them by their own intuition."
Colonel Hennebert tells us that M. Col
lignon. a French geometer, has recently
worked out mathematically the move
ment of a point on a chord of the terres
trial sphere; that is, practically, the mo
tion of a railway car, let us say,, on a rail
way laid in such a tunnel as we have sup
posed. As may be easily seen, it would
mote faster and faster to the middle of the
tunnel and then slower and slower to the
other end. This end would be reached if
there were no resistance, but the friction
of the wheels would stop the car at some
point between the center of the tunnel and
the farther end. Colonel Hennebert quotes
M. Collignon's conclusions as follows:
"At a time when people are not afraid
of long tunnels it would seem that there
would be a great advantage in employing
a means of locomotion in which gravity
would do almost all the work, and which,
by piercing the globe in straight lines,
would establish rapid communication be
tween the most distant geographic points.
The characteristic of this mode of trans
port would be that the traveler would
always have to descend to reach his ob
jective point, and that the journeys would
all take the same time, no matter what
the distance might be."
Colonel Hennebert calculates this time
(which is, of course, done on the supposi
tion that there is no friction), and finds
j that it is 42 minutes 11 seconds, which
is, he remarks, little enough for a trip
from London to Melbourne, or from Paris
to Timbuctu. However, it appears that
an important practical consideration has
been hitherto overlooked. Says Colonel
Hennebert:
"We hasten to declare that a journey of
this kind belongs to the domain of the im
possible. Without stopping to consider
the mass of objections that might be op
posed to his calculations, M. Collignon
sees an absolute obstacle to the realization
of his plan in the enormous pressures that
would be developed in the air at the depths
that would have to be reached in the
course of journeys at any length."
A table, showing the number of atmos
pheres corresponding to the pressures at
different depths is here given and shows
that at a depth of only a fiftieth of the
earth's radius the pressure would be repre
sented by the number 34,547 followed by
57 ciphers! The article goes on:
"We must then admit that in the whole
central part or the tunnel, if it has pene
trated to any depth in the subterranean
strata, there is a sort of impassable wall,
formed by compressed air, in which bodies
from the surface of the globe would be
stopped, crushed, perhaps burned up.
"To what depth beneath the sea-level
can we descend in a pit freely open to the
air? It can be shown that the pressure of
three atmospheres is the extreme limit of
pressure that can be borne with impunity.
To this limit corresponds the depth of
8750 meters (28,700 feet, or more than 500
miles), and when this has been reached
the first fifth of the earth's crust has
scarcely been traversed. This depth is yet
far from having been reached, even in the
most famous mines.
"It is a curious fact that this number of
8750 meters also nearly expresses the limit
of height to which we have been able to
rise in the terrestrial atmosphere.
"From ail these considerations we can
conclude that within the limits of less
than nine kilometers, either above or
below sea level, by a series of the most in
teresting conditions man sees himself con
fined by the fateful decree: Ne plus ultra."
A Suggestion for Inventors.
When electricity was first adopted in
houses an attempt was made to perpet
uate the old gas brackets, chandeliers, etc.
It took a certain time for the vendors of
such articles to realize that their form
might be altered for the better, as the
heaviness which was needed where a tube
was necessary was out of place when a
thin wire replaced the tube.
So it seems to be with motor carriages,
so far as I have seen them. Carriage
makers, or whoever design the new ve
hicles, cannot get out of their head the
lorms that are suitable for carriages drawn
by horses, and they seem to be under the
impression that it would be almost a crime
to deviate from the old models. The man
whose motor carriage will eventually be
come popular must emancipate his mm d
from the tyranny of continuity. â London
Truth.
Photographs of a Tornado.
The Engineering News prints the photo
graph of a tornado of which the accompany-1
ing cut is a reproduction, and says that it wil
be examined with especial interest at this
time, both by those who have had and those
who have not had the fortune, good or ill, to
witness one of these terrible storms. The
photograph was taken by T. Croft, a local
photographer at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
Territory, at about 4 p. m. on May 14. The
tornado was about six miles distant when Ihe
photograph was taken, and a rough computa
tion indicates a probable diameter of the fun
nel of about 1000 feet.
Tne negative is, unfortunately, exceedingly
faint and the print should show the sky much
darker than it does, but a tornado is a difficult
subject to photograph at the best; in fact,
most people who have witnessed one of these
twisters have found other things to occupy
their time than taking pictures of the threat
ening spiral. So far as known this is the first
actual photograph of a tornado ever published
and it Is believed that only one other has ever
been taken. This is referred to in Russell's
â¢â¢Meteorology" as having been secured at the
Howard mines, Soutn Dakota, on August 28,
1884, the cloud then being twenty-two miles
away, and a rather poor pen picture is inserted
in the book, drawn from the photograph.
TO PROMOTE INSANITY.
A new puzzle has recently appeared which,
the New York Evening Sun thinks, bids fair to
fill the lunatic asylums or ruin the eyesight of
the unfortunate persons in whose hands it
chances to fall. No skill or calculation is
required to solve it. The thing works itself,
but how and why is a mystery.
The name of the puzzle Is "Get Off the
Earth." It consists of two pieces of card
board, one square piece, in the center of
which is fixed a circular piece, which
revolves on a central pin through an arc
of about an inch. The circular piece is
painted like a map of the earth, and about the
edges, partly on the earth and partly in the
surrounding air, are twelve Chinamen, wear
ing swords. Turning the cardboard round
about it is found that one of the Celestials has
completely vanished. To find out where is the
puzzle.
Simple as it looks, this is a difficult problem.
A simple turn of the cardboard does appear to
put on the earth an extra man; a reversal of
the center piece and he is gone. And yet all
the parts that make up the men are in plain
sight, and none are concealed beneath the re
volving world.
After a large series of careful observations
one of the principal electrical companies In
the United States has decided to put Crookes
tnbes on the market, and tubes of approved
sizes and types may now be purchased. It is
said, says the Electrical Review, that very
successful results have been obtained with the
tubes already furnished. Experiments are be
ing continued, in order that the most im
proved forms may be within reach of the pub
lic continually.
The Russian petroleum trade was badly in
jured last winter by inundations, which inter
rupted for weeks the working of the Trans-
Caucasian Railroad, which extends from the
petroleum wells on the Caspian to the Black
Sea, through what were formerly known as
Circassia and Georgia. There Is now serious
talk of a pipe line to connect with another
railroad north of the Caucasus.
Certain kinds of diamonds, those of a hluish
white tint, have been found to phosphoresce
on exposure to the ultra-vioiet rays of an elec
tric arc or other strong light. It is suggested,
that as these particular tinted diamonds are
the only ones which phosphoresce, the phos
phorescence may be due to some contained im
purity.

CHILDREN'S EYESIGHT
IMPROVES WITH AGE
Singular Results of an Exami
nation of School
Pupils.
The Percentage of Normal Vision
Found to Increase With Years.
Bad System of Light.
The growing use of glasses by people
who are in their prime and should possess
good eyesight has been the subject of much
discussion. Oculists claim that with
proper care and treatment of such troubles
giving nature a chance to assert herself
imperfections in vision may be remedied
and overcome, so that the use of glasses
can be done away with after a time.
It seems that the School Board of Balti
more has not been so short-sighted in the
matter, but recently assisted a committee
of oculists in the work by having the
schoolteachers co-operate with them.
The results are shown in the following
statement, published in Philadelphia:
The eyes of 53,067 pupils were exam
ined by the tests ordinarily used by
oculists, and the results are interesting
and suggestive.
Nine thousand and fifty-one pupils were
found to have such defective eyesight as
to make school work unsafe. Fifty-three
| per cent of the children were found not to
â  be in the enjoyment of normal vision,
i but curiously enough the percentage of
defective eyesight steadily decreased with
the age of the pupils. The percentage of
normal vision was found to be as follows
in the different grades: First grade, 35;
1 second, 41; third, 47; fourth, 49; fifth, 48;
! sixtb, 48; seventh, 54, and eighth, 5*J. No
explanation is offered for this improve
| ment in eyesight with age and the use of
I the eyes under school conditions.
Until such explanation is given it might
be argued either that the eyesight of the
race is deteriorating, being worse in tho
children latest born, or that there are de
j fects in vision which are remedied either
i by nature or art.
But at least one definite conclusion was
reached. It was found that many black
boards and maps in the schools were not
i placed in the proper light, and the report
i of the oculists recommends yearly cx
i aminations hereafter of the pupils' eye-
I sight, and that a uniform system of adjust
able seats and desks be adopted, and
that these be regulated to the heights of
j the children.

Worn by Women On and
Off the Stage
All of the fashionable world still left to
the mercy of the winds and dust as
sembled last Monday to welcome John
Drew and his gifted company. As usual,
the actresses wore well and stylishly
Kowned, for they know by expeiience that
a San Francisco audience is well able to
criticize every toilette from bonnet to
shoes.
In the first act Maud Adams in an even
ing frock of black looked touchingly sweet
and fragile. Ueautii'ul embroidery adorned
the bodice, and produced the effect of large
sapphires strewn over the black chiffon.
The loose front most admirably suited the
wearer's slender t:g.ure and the darfc velvet
skirt hung to perfection.
The next time we see this little actress
she wears a very handsome cape of rich
purplish velve:. Her hat is a large black
one with blacK ostrich plumes and here
and there a crimson rose. When she re
moved her !iat and cape a dainty gown was
revealed of a pinkish poplin. The bodice
was cov< red with pink mousseline de soie;
fold afn r fold of it produced excellent re
sults, md the sleeves were models of the
coming style. They were of the poplin,
which fitted the arm closely, and over it
was the mousseline. This was rucked all
the way up the arm until the shoulder was
reached and there the mousseline ex
r nded into a small puff. But most chic of
f. 1 was the last gown in which she ap
-1 eared ready for a dinner party. The
<kirt was of a heavy creamy-white satin;
over the back widths was a flight
of silvery butterflies. The bodice was
of orange satin with moderate sleeves.
Hie carried a great bunch of white
sweetpeas. About Maud Adams I
especially noted how excellent were her
sleeves and gloves, and her hair was most
becomingly dressed. Her skirts were so
well cut and hung that, although of nine
or ten gores, they gave her the necessary
air of slenderness now so fashionable.
Miss Annie Irish is a stylish woman,
but she was always at her best in full
evening dress, and in the "Squire of
Dames" her dinner gown was highly
satisfactory, being of a rich pale-green
silk, which was covered with quaint,
artistic figures in an odd bluiah-green
shade.
The bodice was- of a plain green silk
completely covered with mousseline de
soie beautifully embroidered in silver.
The mousseline was put on very full; the
sleeves were medium. Her fan, in white
Â«nd silver, was much admired, as it seemed
to have been especially designed to suit
the toilette. In her gown of a soft pinkish
cast she is not half so stylish, but with it
she wears a stunning bit of a bonnet of
grass gieen straw over which pink roses
nod in artistic confusion.
What a well-jcrown fresh-looking woman
Ethel Barrymore is. She wore in the
first act a sweet gown which might be
used as a model for a girl's snmmer even
ing dress. The skirt was of white organdie;
four ruffles composed it, on each of which
were three narrow rows of creamy
Valenciennes lace. The bodice was most
cracefully draped and the foundation for
the gown was of white taffeta. A few rich
primson roses here and there gave a wel
come touch in color.
In the next scene her toilette of coarse
brown canvas was excellent. The skirt
was full and absolutely unadorned, being
yimp'y bound with black, and this touch
of black appeared in a quaint sort of little
jacket, which was of the canvas bound
with black and stitched with an outline
figure in white. It was lined with a shot
greenish blue silk and was worn over a
blouse waist of wonderfully fine organdie,
which has many lines of fine Valenciennes
insertion. As the curtain falls Ethel is
robed in a dinner gown with a skirt of old
rose pink satin and a bodice of creamy
white chiffon and lace, about which is in
troduced a touch of pistache green.
In one scene the effect of the Western
girl's costume is somewhat 'spoiled by her
plove4 of long black suede being decidedly
the worse for wear, but then her hats were
quite lovely; not one was overloaded and
all were becoming.
Gladys Wallis was a winsome maiden in
her really lovely and simple frocks of or
gandy. One was covered with Dink blos
soms on a white ground. Soft falls of lace
and ribbons added to its charms, and it
was made in a manner suitable for a girl
of fifteen, and from it many maidens
might learn a lesson, as most of them will
not rest content until arrayed in a dress
quite suitable for their sisters, who may
be ten years their seniors.
Gladys is a picture in her white gown
with Irish point, under the inseitions and
edgings of which were introduced blue
satin ribbons, and baby ribbons were
abundant on the dear Jittle waist. 80 you
see I had reason to enjoy the bright play
and the costumes as well. Among the
cowns in the audience I observed that, as
has been usual for the past few seasons,
there was an epidemic of light bodices and
black silk or satin skirts. Of course the
sfcirts you know all about, and many of
them have done long and faithful service,
but some of the bodices were exceptionally
good. One of heavy white corded silk bad
a brocade design over it of grape leaves
and a deep pointed collar of black velvet
edged with a steel and crystal passe
menterie.
The sleeves had been diminished but
slightly in dimensions. An artistic crea
t:on was of white silk crepe over white
BiljC The crepe was covered with pale and
dark violets and looked as though the
pattern might have been drawn by one of
the sprites in a "Midsummer Night's
Dream." Insertions and real lace made
it still more lovely. Soft folds of white
completed it at the neck, and the sleeves
were the very latest.
The handsomest bonnet in the housi
rested on the beautiful and abundant
Bnow-white hair of a very handsome
matron. It loudly announced its Parisian
origin, so do not be surprised when I tell
you ihat I simply cannot describe it, for
to say ihat it seemed to be composed of a
substance like jet, but which was changed
when the gaslight tell on it from a browr;
to gr^cn and orange does not convey air
very definite idea*, but it was fascinatingly
chic; to that I can testify. Several young
girls in the house were noticeably pretty ln
light frocks; one of silk, a white ground
covered with ulue corn flowers and a Jace
yoke, and a full ruff of real Jace, and an
other was covere 1 with apple blossom
and bad a ruche of imitation bJossoms,
which gave it a Frenchy touch.
But I must give you the results of
my very latest information from foreign
parts, and to begin you must know
Louis Seize bodices will be worn no longer.
Cha.itiliy has settled that, for the secon
meeting was largely attended by the
elegantes of Paris, and the most perfectly
dressed women appeared in either very
short jackets in flowered silks or elabo
rately trimmed taffetas, and mousseline
de soie capes opening over lace, or fancy
bodices encircled with golden or jeweled
waistbands. Many waistbands worn were
made of a heavy galon, embroidered in
the Russian style with large cabocbons,
or with compact masses of golden beads,
dividing the belt into compartments.
Some were composed of bronze and steel
spangles, sewn upon an elastic foundation
so in.eniously fastened as to remind one
' of the scales ot a fish, and almost equally
brilliant and beautiful. Others were in
leather covered with a sort of mother-of
pearl tissue, with blue or pinky tints.
Cheap imitations of these are abominable
and not to be tolerated. The simple belts
of the best white or cream kid, with a
queer head as a fastening, are in good
taste.
We are all interested in cravats and the
i "Cravate Guizot" is the latest, It has
! been so called as it resembles slightly the
old-fashioned stock worn by Monsieur
Guizot. It is really too warm for summer,
and is composed of either black or white
moire, showing at the top a narrow line of
turned over linen collar. It is scarf-like
in form, passed from front to back and
then brought forward and knotted in a
sailor knot with long ends. We are in
structed to wear it with either ecru or
i colored silk batiste blouses. Blouses are
i now to be had of great elegance and per
! fectly cut. In price they are extraordi
! narily extravagant.
The fichu bravely holds its own, and the
! latest is of flowered taffeta. The large
i flowered silk paletot-sec is built quite
! short with a deep flounce of plisse mous
j seline de soie, usually black, at the bottom.
I The sleeves are enormously wide, so as to
I slip easily over those belonging to the
! bodice, and the main trimmings are loops
I and bows of black 6atin ribbon, generously
i disposed back and front. The taffeta
! fichus have black and white gauze plisses
I on their edges very often, showing charm
ing ( plestrons, which should harmonize
with the colors of the silk. Wide satin belts
j are frequently worn, of course black is
I preferred, which enfold the back and front
ends of the fichu. The fichu will not
have the necessary air of style without a
belt as it gives the pretty waist line,
i Black satin corselets of ribbon are seen on
; colored nfuslins, organdies and indeed on
every description of light transparent ma
: terials, and also upon the favorite white
I taffetas with the porcelaine-blue ara
j besques and the crepe de Chine dresses,
when the entire costume is of one color.
The ten-gored skirt most worn in the
evening on cersmonious occasions meas
ures exactly six and a half yards round;
for simple skirts nine gores are all-suffi
cient. For those who have dressmaking
I done at home I strongly advise using pat
j terns that are not only correct and re
liable, but those which are easily followed,
because accompanied by a full-size model,
! neatly put together.
The very latest evening dresses have no
I sleeves, but our low-cut bodices would in-
I deed have a very unfinished appearance
were this remark to be taken literally;
but no sleeves in this case means that
there is neither a long nor a short sleeve,
nor in fact any kind of sleeve of the ma
terial of the frock, either silk or satin;
only a billowy mass of tulla finishes the
bodice at the shoulder. Layers upon
layers of unhemmed tulle, like a ballet
dancer's skirt, start from trie armhole and
just cover the top of the arm. This tulle
can be of any color harmonizing with the
toilet, but white, pink or Nile green are
usually employed. The effect is ravish
ing, as nothing is so softening and becom
ing to the complexion as tulle, and the
neck of such a bodice is usually finished
with soft folds of the tulle. Truly, how
quickly we lay aside our most cherished
modes for the "latest," which we fall in
love with promptly and declare to be the
most beautiful ever devised.
At the present moment Frenchwomen
are raving over crepe de Chine, and writes
a correspondent: Every good gown I
meet displays this most charming fobric,
the palest shade of pavement gray and a
Tuscan tone being unquestionably the
I most favored hues, while the trimming is
mostly embroidered lawn, traced with a
little gold thread, and the belt may be
formed of glace silk, and belts are details
to which the Frenchwoman is much de
voted. She prefers these In corselet form
folded round her waist, extending almost
to her bust, where some soft muslin or
chiffon will overhang them. Black silk
and Chine silk make these corselets as a
rule, and the bodice usually boasts a small
frilled basque beneath them.
Enthusiastic Wfteelwomen. i
There are few more enthusiastic wheel
women than Miss Helen Gould and her
handsome sister-in-law, Mrs. Edwin Gould.
Miss Goald ir living at her home la Irving
ton. Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gould are at
Beachwood, their beautiful summer place
at Dobbs Ferry. Both young women are
learning vo ride bicycles and each is
delighted with the sport.
Mrs. Edwin Gould, although very young,
is a charming hostess. When I called at
Beachwood one day last week Miss Helen
Gould was there also. Both were talking
bicycle* with the eager interest of novices
and with as much spirit and animation as
many women would display in discussing
a new bonnet.
"We have just been arguing about the
proper adjustment of handle bars," said
Mrs. Gould, smilingly; "it's a very im
portant matter, I assure you.' 1
When entering the house I noticed a
tandem and five or six single bicycles.
"You have quite a stock of b;cycles, 1!
I observed.
"Yes, indeed," said Mrs. Gould. "We
keep several extra machines for our
friends. When we have callers â and most
of our friends ride â we take them out on
the road for a social spin instead of sitting
on the veranda or, under the trees, as wo
used to do.
"Mr. Gould and I ride the tandem, or
rather we shall ride it as soon as Mr. Gould
is able. He was thr.iwn from his horse a
short time ago, you knew, and his knee
was injured quite badly. He resigned from
his regiment just because of the injury.
When his knee is well again he will give
up riding horses and take to the tandem.
I am very glad, too, for I think horseback
ndin dangerous."
"And it is not as so iable, either, as a
tandem bicycle," said Miss Helen Gould.
"That's true," replied Mrs. Gould. "One
cannot imagine how much pleasure and
sociability there ig on a tandem bicycle
until one has tried it. And when one's hus
band is on the tandem it is a great relief
to know that he is not in danger of being
hurt by trying to jump horses over high
fences."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 28, 1896.
MEN'S VIVID WAISTCOATS ARE LOSING FAVOR
In London the gant de suede is not so
popular as the kid glove, and yellow
gloves are much worn.
The vivid waistcoat is not in favor
among well-dressed men in England.
Many waistcoats button very highâ about
ten. Between ten and twelve buttons are
frequently seen.
Care should be taken not to wear a shirt
that too violently contrasts with one's
waistcoat. Even a tie should be selected
carefully. For instance I saw a man to
day who wore a pink shirt with hair lines
of white running through it and his white
tie had horizontal lines of dark blue. The
effect produced was common, although
the shirt was excellent.
I do wonder why Mr. Drew has such a
fancy for the Bilk braid down the seam of
his evening trousers. He wore trousers
disfigured in the same way last season.
His frock coats are well cut, but his riding
coat and breeches are not beyond criticism ;
however his boots and pumps, his
waistcoats, collars and ties are. I give an
illustration of the style of breecnes worn
by him in "The Squire of Dames." In
the same plays Mr. Baker and Mr. Byron
also wore good frock coats. About the
latest frocks it may be said: "There is a
smartness which suggests skirts, and yet
when analyzed the garment is seen to be
perfectly square cut. The soft shirts in
colors are worn a great deal in the coun
try, and the effort to put frills on the
bosoms of them has not met with much
success."
Concerning trousers it is well to remem
ber that "fancy trousers which are worn
with black frock coats are made of cash
mere. The patterns are in stripes, in
dart grays and blues. I have seen a num
ber of black and white plaids and a few
checks, but the stripe remains in favor.
The trousers are cut about nineteen and a
half in the knee, and eighteen bottom.
They are wide, bui have no spring. Ditto
trousers of cheviots and tweeds and shep
herd's plaids to be worn with coat of same
color and material for morning suits are
cut perhaps a little wider.
"Knickers are made very full and baggy
at the knee, and without the leather ex
tensions with which they were formerly
arranged."
Trousers are quite full, generally speak
ing, but oot baggy and have no percepti-
Dle spring.
A man asks an Eastern journal what
shirts he should wear to business, go as to
be in good form ; he is answered correctly
and fully: Colored percales, Oxford or
zephyr will be most in vogue. The style
will be white collars, all-around turn
down. The most popular patterns are in
stripes of darker blue, pink, brown, buff
or lavender on a lighter ground; stripes
running up and down. Cuffs are of same
ma eria! as shirts. White figures on col
ored grounds and colored figures on white
grounds >re also in vogue. The bosoms
are efther stiff linen or else unstarched.
Two shirt buttons and not three.
Russet shoes are out of date, excepting
for the depths of the woods and the coun
try. Then they should be laced, not but
toned.
So much green has been introduced into
almost all mixtures for summer suits that

the critical man now avoids it when giving
an order for a new suit, knowing that it is
becoming common.
Some men certainly do not know how to
dress for coif, so it is interesting to note
Vogue's remarks concerning the game and
appropriate togs for it. Itsays: "Golf is not
a game of ease. Most golfers find them
selves in a dripping perspiration after they
have played a long course, and their suits
are adapted to this condition. In very hot
weather tho most approved suit is thin,
pray Russian duck, which is very light,
and through which air circulates freely.
The shirt is plain white, with no tie, the
shirt at the throat beins unbuttoned and
the sleeves rolled up to the elbows. Many
golfers wear no caps at all, preferring
to go bareheaded; and when they do
wear caps they should be of the
same material as the knickers and
very light. The shoes have very thick
soles, with spikes or hobnails and gaiters-
Scotch stockings are almost invariably
used, and should be carried aDove the
knee, the knickers fastening above the
knee. A year or two ago, when golf first
began to be played generally in America,
knickers were worn with box-cloth exten
sions and the stockings turned down below
the knee at the extensions. This, how
ever, is hot and uncomfortable and vir
tually obsolete to-day. In cold weather
sweaters are worn, and in very cold
weather both sweaters and a coat."
At the present moment in Paris there is
a great demand for marrow bones, as an
eminent physician has declared that mar
row on toast wonderfully aids digestion;
as a result all men are demanding it at
their clubs. Doubtless it will shortly be
called for here.
The comic papers joke about the good
democratic Scotch sport of golfing and
represent the golfer as an animated cos
tume, says the New York World. Shrewd
tailors have taken advantage of the golf
craze to create enormous opportunities
for weak-minded rich young men to make
themselves absurd, and such young men
rarely overlook such opportunities.
But these foolish youths are not golf
players, and they cannot be used as an
argument that golf is a foolish amusement
or that it demands the innumerable clubs
and clothes and other expensive things
that they love to indulge in.
Rather look at TayloV, the open cham
pion of England, and admit that it is
much fairer as well as much safer to judge
the game by him than by the Newport
youth.
Taylor often plays in ordinary street
clothes. His name is to golfers what
Pirn's name means to tennis players, or
Bob Cook's to amateur oarsmen. If any
player had a right to indulge in frills it
should be he.
As described by a writer in the Strand
magazine, he not only wears his ordinary
clothes, but he usually carries bis own
clubs, dispensing with the caddy which
the toy golfer glories in.
This is satisfactory proof that golf has
something to it besides clothes and cad
dies if that fact were not likely to be sus
pected by sensible people anyway. It has
spread with wonderful rapidity amongst
the rich since its introduction in America
a few years ago and it is inevitable that it
is to become one of the most popular
games for everybody as soon as the stigma
of being a clothes-horse amusement wears
off.
What makes it a good game? The fact
that it beats you oftenerthan you beat it.
There is hardly any such thing as making
a perfect shot. In baseball a player
catches a ball or he "muffs" it, but in golf
there is hardly a stroke a man makes that
he might not have made it better. All
this means that it has the essential quali
fications of a sport just as billiards has.
It beats one and keeps the interest
, aroused. C. C. ,
J} Pietupesque
Costume of White Silk and
Coat of Black
This very picturesque frock here repro
duced has a skirt of exceptionally rich,
soft white silk, with a bodice ot the same
veiled in a fichu of white chiffon. The
sacque-backed Eton coat is of black satin,
and the folded sash of crimson silk. The
black bonnet has bows of the crimson.
This toilette was worn at a large charity
bazar, and it will doubtless suggest in
various combinations some valuable ideas.
The jaunty Eton jacket model is being
made up for numberless slender women in
various fabrics. The cat must be faultless
to insure an air of style.
Black mousseline de soie, exquisitely
painted by hand, is in great vogue; also
made over colored or glace silk. One I
am delighted with is covered with grace
ful bunches of wistaria and is made over
a glace silk which shades and gleams like
a great opal. The vest has innumerable
ruffles of black mousseline de soie, edged
with real lace of a creamy hue. Shaded
sequins give the necessary touch. This
is a costly garment and one which will be
chic until the end of summer.
All long sleeves in Paris have a short puff
and are tacked to the waist. The only ex
ception to this rule is in the coat and
skirt combination; in it the sleeves are
slightly full and drooping. Evening bod
ices have long points in front. No fashion
able woman is now seen wearing white
gloves in the daytime, Jemon-colored kids
being in demand, as well as all soft shades
in suede kid. The tulle bow is a thing of
the past.
To sum up the fashions of France of the
hour. As a fabric, crepe de Chine is the
idol of the moment; the most popular ;
color is pale gray ; the next moment, I
venture to assert, it will be red ; while, as
a combination of colors, blue and violet
hold sway. Skirts are full, sleeves are
small, barques are short, belts are Ã¼biqui
tous, and even the most captious of critics
could be found to say a good word for the
modes of Paris as they are to-day, when
realized by the best artists and worn by
the woman of tact. Of course, that there
are other folks who live to caricature
Fashion's best laws is an unalterable fact
of existence. It is a sorry one, but inevit
able in a free country, where sumptuary I
legislation is a dead letter.
Truly fetching is a tea gown owned by a j
youthful bride. It is composed of a bro- i
cade having a pearl ground, over which !
are scattered pale mauve lilacs and green
leaves. Beneath this is worn an empire
dress entirely formed of mauve accordion- i
pleated silk hanging from a yoke of trans- j
parent lace. Two frills of this accordion
kilted silk make the sleeves. Bands of in
sertion, set transparently, adorn the fronts
of the gown on either side. It is mounted j
on mauve silk eiaborately frilled inside |
the hem with mauve and green glace, j
Tais gown is not difficult to mate, as the |
accordion-kilted silk may be purchased by j
the yard, and its great width on a woman
of medium height would be found suffi- ;
cient to hang from the lace yoKe which
just reaches the bust. A few yards of bro
cade will make the back, and the sleeves j
are easily mad a if the accordion frills are j
used with the narrow uncrushable silk ;
now to be had. It is a fact worth noting j
that accordion pleating never looks so well 1
on anything as on white, either chiffon or
silk.
Of all the dark colors this season, blue, ,
dark navy, is most worn, and truly attrac- j
tive morning gowns are made of this in j
canvas, trimmed with narrow white braid. 1
Frequently the bodice has a short-tabbed i
basque, worn with a very narrow white
kid belt or narrow folds of white ribbon.
The ribbon is most effective.
Glace silk continues to enjoy a great |
vogue, especially in green and white.
Alpaca will soon, I predict, be on the I
bargain counter, although it has not yet !
been given up, as it so perfectly sheds the |
dust, and a stylish frock of this fabric is of j
a medium shade of gray. It is braided i
prettily with white and has a front of j
white muslin over white silk. With it is j

THE SAN FRANCISCO STAGE
1 " ' c
It was not John Drew's fault that h
had homeopathic-sized audiences at the
Baldwin Theater last week. His play was
smoother and more finished than -'The
Gray Mare" at the California, and his sup
port* on the female side was more efficient
than Herbert Kelcey's. But even with
charmine Maud Adams thrown into the
Baldwin balance, "The Squire of Dames"
could not reasonably be expected to
br'ng $1 50 on the same Rialto that was
selling "The Gray Mare" for 75 cents.
W ith good, smooth acting going so cheap
at the California, nothing could have filled
the Baldwin short of a startling foreign
star with a big name and a brand-new
method.
"The Gray Mare" is a racy comedy, with
one defectâ the whole thing hinges on the
improbable fact of a sedate man who never
rode in his life suddenly declaring that he
has ta&en a mad scamper across country
on a gray mare. A long and amusing
chain of circumstances is based on this
absurd statement. One can imaeine the
authors building the playâ it is the fashion j
nowadays to "build" playsâ on the princi
pie of "The House That Jack Built"â
This Is the maiden ail forlorn,
Who fled with the man that trampled the corn,
Who rode the mare
To the French count's lair â
And so on down to the fundamental state
ment, "On the ride that John took."
The play demands that John should say
he took a ride when, as a matter of fact,
he was soberly attending to His duties as a J
medical practitioner and bis nephew was
scouring the country on a gray mare, ab
ducting maidens and otherwise, stirring
up enough trouble to last his uncle for a
lifetime. As everything hinges on John's
ride the authors have dragged it in by
main force, and to dc them justice they
had to work hard to" do it. Most of the
first act is devoted to tallcily giving John
a motive for telling a lie. Once the deed !
is done and John has shaken off all affinity â¢
with George Washington the fun becomes j
fast, and furious. In fact, at the outset |
one wishes "The Gray Mare" had never
been written, and at the end one could
have enjoyed another act of it.
As "John," Herbert Kelcey had a part
which suited him to perfection. There j
was something positively delightful about j
his pedantry and his despair. "Serve you ,
right," was what you wanted to say to
him for being such a prig, but his suffer
ings were so real that if you had an ounce
of pity in your composition you could not
help being sorry for John.
Almost a panic has been aroused on the j
New York Rialto by the news that j
Abbey's Theater has been leased to Al I
Hayman, and that the Western man has
already announced his intention of
settine the pace during the season of
1896-97. In most quarters this announce- j
meat is "viewed with alarm," for predic- :
tions are rife that there will soon be a j
complete chain of Hayman theaters, ex- |
tending from San Francisco to New York |
and Boston, and that the Hayman-Froh
man "octopus," owning all the best
houses, will be abie to control the lead
ing attractions, and set the prices for
every star in the country. This is the
view expressed by a number of actors' and
managers, though it may be inspired by 1
"envy, hatred, malice and all uncharitable- j
ness." The New York Press sums up the
situation from the theatergoer's stand
point:
"Notwithstanding our esteem for the
shrewdness of Frohman and Hayman, the
change of management at Abbey's is to"\)e
watched with concern. This theater has
long been the scene of the most distin
guished performances of modern dramatic
art. Under new management, for without
doubt Charles Frohman will have a word
in shaping its policy, the house will prob
ably be even more prosperous in the future
than it was in the past. But box office re
ceipts do not always chronicle distin
guished achievements on the stage, and Mr.
Hayman's pain may be the city's loss. If. \
as is more than likely, the house is to be
conducted in accordance with the system
that rules the other Frohman-Hayman
thf aters, an exact platform of art has been
demolished in the removal of Abbey's
name from the portal of the playhouse. I
Here we became acquainted with Coque
lin, Rejane, Mounet-Sully, Beerbohm
Tree and John Hare; here we studied the
genius of Bernhardt ana the consummate !
skill of Irvine. In present indications it I
is improbable that these distinguished j
actors will return to the stage on which I
they first won the approval of our au- j
diences. Abbey's passion, like that of
Augustin Daly, is for fine art. Mr. Hay- j
man, like Mr. Frohman, is first of all a j
business man. The new policy of this
(beater is one of the most important and
interesting speculations of next season."
And while the New York papers are
exhausting adjectives in lauding the Na
poleonic foresight of the Hayman busi- |
ness-office policy, as exemplified at the ;
B&ldwin and California Theaters, our ears !
here are still tingling with the biting things j
Nat Goodwin said about those same two
houses playing against themselves.
They must have a lightning-speed com
poser at Grover's Alcazar, to judge from j
the following note inserted in the pro- j
gramme of the "Cross Roads of Life" :
"Between scenes 1 and 2 of Act 11, j
the orchestra will play the 'Railroad !
Galop,' especially composed for this pro- I
dnction, during the short time necessary'
for the cliange of scene."
A man who can compose a galop "dur
ing the short time necessary for the
cnange of scene," should be heard more
from, particulaly as his galop is really
quite effective.
Manager Friedlander promises to make
things lively in Oakland theatrical circles
now that he has secured the handsome
Macdonough Theater.
California Theater.
"A Bunch of VioletÃ" will be the bill
for the third week of the Stockweli
season at the California Theater, which
begins to-morrow night. Tne play is by
Bidney Grundy, author of "Sowing the
Wind," etc.
The characters include Sir Philip Mar
chant, a swindling Baronet, who is finally
driven to commit suic:de; his child
Violet and his two wives, from neither of
whom he has been divorced. The role of
Sir Philip was played in the original pro
duction by Beerbohm Tree, and will be in
terpreted in the coming cast by Herbert
Kelcey. It is a strong part, whic will
afford the leading man many opportuni
ties. Several of theother characters are ]
said to be wsll drawn; they will be in the
hands of John T. Suilivan, L. R. Stock
well, William Beach, Effie Shannon, Olive
Oliver, Wmona Shannon, etc.
Frederick Warde and Rose Coghlan
will arrive here during the week to make
preparations for their opening of "Car
men" on July 13.
Baldwin Theater.
For the next four weeks the Baldwin
Theater will be closed for its regular
summer vacation. The season will com
mence on Monday evening, July 27, with
Charles Frohman's company from the
Empire Theater, the opening performance
being Clyde Fitch's "Bohemia," an adapta
tion of '"La Vie de Boheme," which Has
proved very popular in New York. ''Bo
hemia" will be followed by "The Benefit
of the Doubt" and "The Masqueraders."
The Ions; list of plays already booked for
the coming season at the Baldwin in
cludes '"The Gay Parisians,' 1 "The
Prisoner of Zenda," with James Hackett
and Isabelle Irving in the leading roles;
Katheryn Kidder and Augustus Cook in
"Madame Sans Gene," Julia Marlowe
Tabor, "The Brownies," Alexander Sal
vini, etc.
Columbia Theater.
The Frawley Company's offering this
week will be William H. Crane's produc
tion, "His Wife's Father." Th<Â» play is
by Miss Martha Morton, but she acknowl
edges having taken the leading idea from
a well-known German comedy. It has !
been in Crane's repertory a little over a
year, and during that time has proved one
of the best drawing of his attractions.
As the title implies, the story is one of
too mucb father-in-law. When Buchanan
Billings' daughter marries he cannot re
sign himself to giving her up to a strange
young man, ana consequently insists on
making a third in all the voting people's 1
undertakings till they surreptitiously move i
to a home of their own, in order to enjoy !
some tete-a-tetes. This nearly breaks the
I old gentleman's heart, but in the end
everything is smoothed out, and a fas
j cinating widowconsoles Buchanan Billings
for the loss of his daughter's society.
Grand Opera-House.
With to-day's performances the produc
tion of "A Perilous Voyage" at this house
comes to a close. It is to be followed to
morrow by E. E. Price's comedy-drama,
"One of the Bravest," the leading role in
which will be taken by Emmet Sberklan.
j This young actor comes from the East
j with exce'lent credentials as to his ability
as a comedian and singer.
"One of the Bravest" deals with modern
life ir New York, the Fire Department of
that city forming its principal feature.
There are a few sensational incidents,
such, for instance, as a burning tenement,
with. jumping nets, scaling ladders, and
other paraphernalia of life-saving are used.
The comedy element will be made much
of by Gilbert <fr Goldie and the favorite
soubrette, Josephine Gassman, all of whom
have been especially engaged for this pro
duction.
Tivoli Opera- House.
The operatic spectacle, "A Trip to tne
Moon," will continue to be the attraction
at the Tivoli until further notice.
Friday evening, July 3, will be the
eighteenth anniversary of the opening of
the house, and a special feature of the oc
casion will be the distribution of souve
nirs containing pictures of the artists and
a record of all the leading performances
I given under the Kreling regime.
After the run of "A Trip to the Moon"
the grand-opera season will open under
the direction of Gustav Hinricns and his
Eastern company, which includes: Mine.
i Louise Natalie, Mile. Nina Bertini Humph
! revs, Mile. Anna Russell, Sig. Fernando
Michaelena, Sig. Maurice de Vries, Sig.
j Abramhoff, Sig. Virisarri and Richard
i Karl. In addition to this company there
will be Mile. Marie MilJard, Mile". Clare

; W. H. Tooker, together with an enlarged
j orchestra and augmented chorus. The
; first two operas on the list are Gounod's
"Romeo and Juliet" and Verdi's "Rigo
letto."
The Orpheum.
The new bill at the Orpheum this week
includes the return appearance of the
! Rossow Brothers, those midgets who made
I such a hit when seen recently at the Or
! pheum with the Hopkins show. Their
engagement this time is for a short stay
only.
The marimba players from Guatemala,
after an interesting and varied experi-
I ence in this country, have now, through
j the assistance of the Sheriff and Gustav
I Walter, secured possession of their instru
j ments, and are positively announced to
j appear. The marimba is constructed on
j the principle of the xylophone, but the
I volume of sound is greatly increased by
the addition of pipes. The players will
I appear in native costume.
The Fredericks troupe will come direct
from the Empire Theater, London. They
style themselves "the oetnon athletes."
The four Maisonos are musical eccen
triques who will also appear. Watson and
Dupre will give a comedy sketch, and a
numb -r of last week's performers will be
retained.
GrovÂ«r's Alcazar.
The triple star cast will continue at the
Alcazar in "The Crossroads of Life" for
Fourth of July week.
Tom Sharkey, the sailor lad, and Danny
Needham, the record-maker, will spar four
rounds at to-day's matinee and to-night.
COQCKLIN'S DREAM.
Ho Hopes to . ntlrely Kcllpue the

Constant Coquelin is not only trying,
bnt actually hopes to succeed in inducing
the French Minister of Fine Arts to estab

the lines of the Ccmeiiie Francaise â a rival
Government house to play against the one
already existing.

ing clerk, who goes to a grocer's to learn
the tricks of the trade, and wnen he knows
grocering by heart solicits the honor of
becoming his master's partner, gets his
customers, and when he is sure of himself,
sets up a rival store across the street.
"That is the history of Coquelin. The
grocery business is one trade, dramatic art
is another, but the principle is the same.
'â¢'Ah! That Comedie Francaise,' cries
Coquelin. 'Don't talk to me about it. I
was crushed there; I had no good parts.'
''Indeed be had no good parts. And
yet the very parts he has been playing at
the Porte Saint-Martin were the parts he
played at the Comedie Francaise. There!
there! He wanted to make more money;
that was all. He must not be surprised
that the Comedie Francaise bears him a
grudge for the injustice he has been doing
it. The question is a commercial one, ana
he ought to find it natural that people
judge him according to the rules of com
merce."
COST OF DRESS.
Miss Shannon Explains What It Means
to an Actress.
Miss Effie Shannon says the education
of the actress in matters of dress is quite
as necessary as the education in her
dramatic art. There are many young
actresses who have taste enough to com
bine with a low-priced dressmaker and
with her help array themselves in more or
less dainty confections for the stage at mod
erate figures. But she pities the woman
lacking in taste whose purse is slender.
A well-dressed actress must have money
or taste. The perfection of dress is brought
about only by the combination of both.
The price of gown? made by first-class
couturiers in Fiance, England or America
is about the same. The prices will begin
say at $50 for dainty ingenue dresses of
simple, inexpensive material, but prettily
I cut, and run from $70, to $100 or $125 for
tailor-made or calling costumes, $i 25 to
I $150 for pretty ball sown?, and $150 to $-00
i for more elaborate ball gowns or recep
tion dresses, etc.; beyond this for hand
some court costumes. The price reaches
up to near the thousands if handsome and
expensive trimmings and laces are used.
Dramatic Brevities.
Leonard Grover is having a play prepared
for Tom Sharkey to star in.
"The Masqueraders'' will be sent out to
the coast for the first tour in August.
"Madame" will be the closing produc
tion of the stock season at the California
Theater.
Corinne and her burlesque company are
among the early fall attractions booked
for the Columbia Theater.
Charles Frohman has Murray Carson
and Louis N. Parker, the authors of
"Gudgeons," at work on a play for the
Empire Theater Company.
Another great New York Lyceum The
ater success will follow "His Wife's
Father" at the Columbia Theater. It is
"The Wife," also written by De Mille &
Belasco.
The marriage of Miss Josephine Jeffer

down for to-morrow. Charles J. Rolfe,
the young Boston lawyer, is to wed this

LAST FOMENTS
OF ERNEST ROSSI.
A profound impression of regret was
created in Italy by the announcement that
Ernest Rossi, the great actor, returning
from a triumphal tour of Russia, had sud
denly to stop at Pescara, struck down with
a terrible malady.
The regret is not to be wondered at; he
has not only been one of the brightest
lights of the stage, but, in his case, genius
was accompanied by goodness and ami
ability.
He had been several times before to
Russia, indeed he was the idol of the Rus
sian public, which has always shown a
fondness for Italian artiscs. This year,
however, Rossi went for the first time in
the severest rigor of winter. Although
nearly 70 years old the Italian actor had
preserved an almost youthful vigor, and
the cruelty of the Russian cold did not
rob him of any of his usual flourishing
health.
One evening, three months ago, he had
acted Othello at the Hermitage Theater,
Moscow. He expected to return home in
his comfortable closed carriage, but the
coachman had been drinking, and did not
put in an appearance. After waiting some
time, Rossi decided to return in adroshky,
a little open hired carriage, which let in
the heavily falling snow. He was heated
and excited after the performance, and the
next day fell sick of influenza (grippe).
According to the Russian doctors, this
was the original cause of nis malady.
For twelve hours he kept his bed; then
he insisted on continuing the perform
ances, for which he had been paid in ad
vance. No one could persuade him from
doing so. "I must," he said to his actors,
"keep my contract."
For his jubilee, which celebrated fifty
years of dramatic arf, he acted in the
Aquarium at St. Petersburg "The Miser,"
by Pushkin, and an act of "Hamlet." The
public showered honors and rich gifts on
him, but in the midst of the applause and
â¦he ovations he was noticed to totter, and
when he left his dressing-room after the
performance every one in the troupe no
ticed the pallor of the great artist.
The Russian doctors went on counseling
repose. He replied according to his in
domitable temperament, "No, I want to
end like a soldier in the trenches; I will
act to my last day."
Whenever he appeared the theaters
were crowded with the elite of the Russian
public. From St. Petersburg he traveled
to Ka rkov, then to Rostow and Taganrog,
aud everywhere anxious eyes watched
him growing more frail. His troupe loved
him, adored him in fact, as a father and a
master, and he was always encircled by
their loving care.
One evening at Odessa, while he was re
citing the part of King Lear, he stumbled
and fell against the young actress who
was playing Cordelia, and could not raise
himself. He was carried to his dressing
room, where the doctor who visited him
declared him to be afflicted with angina
pectoris. His troupe united with the phy
sicians in begging him to take repose, but
in vain. Two days after, he acted the
leading role in Tolstoi's "Ivan."
Rossi appeared again at Kiev and then
j returned to Odessa for his farewell per
formance. The public there adored him,
, and it is speaking literally to say that on
I the last appearance they suffocated him
i with flowers. During the whole perform
ance a doctor was in attendance in the
great nctor's dressing-room.
On May 4 Rossi embarked at Odessa on
the Austria Lloyd steamship Pandora.
On board he became gay again, and sang,
for he was an enthusiastic musician, and
those who have once heard him sing have
never forgot;en his voice. At Constanti
nople, where he had before been received
by the Sultan and had given two perform
ances before the Odalisques in the harem,
he went on shore lor four days, embarking
again at the end of that time and going
by the Pandora to Brindisi. There the
doctors advised him to stay, but he per
sisted in his intention to take the omnibus
train for Florence. Toward 2 o'clock in the
morning he started from his berth, exclaim
ing "I am dying, dying," and to the actors
} and servants who rushed to his as
sistance he complained of acute pains in
his chest, which were aggravated by the
motion of the cars. The bell was rnng
for the conductor and he was begged to
stop the train immediately, but expostu
lated that it would be impossible to de
-1 scene! from the cars by the wayside in the
! middle of the night. At Pescara the train
j stopped and Rossi was carried to the wait-
I ing-room, where he was visited by the
j nearest doctor, who pronounced him to be
in grave danger. Telegrams were dis
patched for his family and for the best
medical advice, and he was given every
comfort in a hotel which adjoined the sta
tion.
Rossi himself was not moved by his
sufferings. His one regret seemed to be
that he had not died at Odessa when he j
fainted in the role of King Lear. "It was
my dream to die in harness, on the stage,"
he said. For over a week he lingered on,
and then the end came quietly when he
was surrounded by his laniily. He was
buried on the 6th inst. in Florence, where
his admiring fellow-citizens gave him a
magnificent public funeral, at which were
present representatives of the Ministry of
Public Instruction, all the principal
officials of the city .and the province of
Tuscany, as well as the principal fraternal
and other societies.
Rossi was one of the great actors of the
ceutury. He had played in many coun
tries, always with success, and to young
and struggling actors and actresses he was
at once a master and a friend. Elenora
Duse and many others testify to what they
owe to him. He leaves a fortune of about
two million francs to his wife and daugh
ter. â From the Italian.

NEW TO-DAY.
A REMARKABLE VOYAGE.
Mr. John Jacob Astor's former mate,
Captain Charlsen, an old "sea dog,"
sailed Sunday, June 21, from the
Battery, New York, for various Euro-
pean ports in his twenty-foot open
sailboat, the " Sozodont." Hi* brother
accompanies him. The voyage will be
made by the northern passage to re-
turn next year. The first serious at-
tempt to cross the Atlantic both ways
in a small boat. Will it be Successful ?
Captain Frank Charlsen, f ormerly an officer
on Mr. John Jacob Astor's yacht, and his
brother have built a fine little vessel es-
pecially for this voyage. She is 20 feet long
over all, 6 feet 8 inches beam and 26 inches
draft; is sloop-rigged, with jib mainsail and
small flying jib. By an ingenious contrivance
the mast is ready to house instantly in case of
emergency. She has been christened the
"Sozodont," in honor of . the well-known
dentriflce of that name, and will carry pack-
ages of Sozodont and advertising matter for
special use in England. No American product
has ever before been sent over in such a bout.
The "Sozodont" will proceed by the North
crn Passage to Queenstown, and thence io the
following, among other, ports in Europe: Isle
of Wight, Southampton. London, Hamburg,
Bremen, Berlin;- Antwerp, Copenhagen, Stock-
holm, Christiania, Bergen; returning, to Huil,
to Leith, by canal to Edinburgh, thence to
Glasgow, Liverpool, Newport (Wales), Cork,
Belfast, Londonderry, and thence to New York,
arriving in the summer of 1897.
The boat will lie at the Battery from Friday |
noon to Sunday afternoon, June 21, when the
start for Europe will bo made, probably. be-
tween 3 and 4 o'clock. Visitors will be allowed.
No Admission is to bo charged.
No other ocean voyagers have attempted to
do what these men will undertake. Theirs
will be the first small boat to cross the Atlan-
tic both ways. About ten years ago "Ked,
White and Blue," a bark-rigeed cabin-boat,
sailed from New York to Liverpool. Later
the following accomplished the voyage one
way:
Captain Andrews, from Atlantic City to Spain
in the "Sa polio," a cabin-boat; Captain Fritz.
a Russian Finn, from New York to England in
the "Nina," a forty-two-foot schooner-rigged
cabin-boat; Captain Anderson, from. Norway
to Chicago (World's Fiir), in the "Viking"
(seventy-eight feet long), a reproduction of the I
original Norse bout ot that name. It will also
be recalled that Captain Webb went across one
way in "The Dark Secret," a deckboat.

SEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 27.â Liquidations
were the order of the day at the Stock Exchange,
and the lowest figures of the week were made in a
number of instances. At the opening the market
was inclined to firmness because of higher cables
from London, but the improvement was unimpor
tant. The firmness was short-lived, and before
the expiration of the first half hour of business
the entire list was on the down grade. The lack of
demand from outside sources was quite pro
nounced, and the dealings tor foreign account in
significant. This left the market practically in the
bands of the traders, and as this class is bearish
for the moment prices yielded anywhere from %
to 3 per cent Business was more active, sales
aggregating 118,807 shares, a fair total for a half
holiday.
All the prominent issues participated in the
downward movement, but the greatest losses were
made by the industrials, the grangers and the in
ternationals. Sugar fell 2 T H to 118%; Burlington
and Quincy, 2% to 745/ 8 ; .St. Paul, %to 753,4;
Kock Island, 1% to 68%; Northwestern, 1 to
101%: Lonisvllle and Nashville, 134 to 485/ 8~;8 ~;
Manhattan, 114 to 101 Vi; tobacco, 1% to 63;
Tennessee coal, 1% to 22: Leather preferred, 1%
to 57%; common, I to 17: Jersey Central, 134 to
1063/ 8 : and Reading Ito 14*4.
The heaviness of the market and the Increased
disposition to assume the short side of the market
was ascribed to the great strength shown by the
free silver advocates and to the belief that they
will be in absolute control at Chicago.
The dullness of^eneral business and the prevail
ing low figures for cereals were much commented
upon by the bear traders. The grangers were de
pressed by reports that the May statements of the
Burlington and Quincy and St. Paul will make a
poor showing. In the case of Kock Island, mem
bers of tne so-called directors' party were con
spicuous buyers at the decline. In the inacive
issues, Rubber preferred brought forth 73%
against 79 yesterday. Specnlation closed heavy.
Net changes in the prominent issues show losses
of */i@2% per cent. Bonds were lower. The
transactions aggregated $487,000.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. lix, June 27.â Board of TradÂ«
people are disposed to enter an emphatic denial 01
the improved business conditions as reported bj
prominent people in interviews which appeared
in a morning paper to-day The past week ha;
been one of almost unprecedented dullness, and
to-day's session was neither better nor worse thai
any that preceded It. The feeling of the wheal
market was easy, a break in the securities in the
New York stock Exchange conveying depression
to the grain business. The news of the day brought
nothing cheering to holders. The weather coin 111
ued good and crops excellent. Liverpool cables
were quiet and steady. Receipts at Chicago weÂ«
eight cars, and 52,914 bushels were taken fron:
store.
The Northwest received 380 cars, against 501
last Saturday and 237 a year ago. Argentine ship
ments of wheat for the week were 320,000 bush
els. American shipments from both coasts for the
week were quite liberal at 2,837,000 bushels, but
to-day's Atlantic seaboard clearances were light
a: 189,500 bushels. Closing continental cables were
generally lower. The last half-hour's trading was
rendered somewhat conspicuous by the amount of
July liquidation which took place, prices weaken
ing further under the weight of offerings. Sep
tember wheat opened from s<SV'3'' t> 56s/ B e, de
clined t055%c, where it closed, 3/ @y 9 c un er yes
terday. Estimated receipts for Mon lay, 16 cars
COUN â Moved off lower in price under the weak
ening Influence of wheat. The trade was li;ht
1 and unimportant, with nothing but local Interest
displayed. Receipts were large at 476 cars and
j 64,076 bushels were withdrawn from store. Liver
i pool rabies were quiet and steady. Argentine
shipped 664,000 bushels of corn last week. Export
clearances were 78.231 bushels. September corn
opened at 28 L 4c, sold at 28c, closing at the inside.
Vie under yesterday. Estimated receipts for Mon-
I djy, 505 cars.
oatsâ With an undertone of weakness, and
a surrounding atmosphere of depression It wat
hardly to be expected that oats would show any
inclination to improvement. Receipts were 838
cars, and 512,601 bushels were taken from store,
Export clearances were but 250 bushels. Septem
ber oats closed VÂ±c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for Monday 360 cars.

was about as usual for a Saturday half holiday
The hog market on the last day of the week is sel
dom an Important one, and product, except on ex
traordinary occasions, sympathizes 1 1 the dull
ness. The feeling in .be market to-day was aoom
steady. Toward the close the weakness of wheal
had a discouraging effect. September pork closed
17% c lower, September lard a shade lower, and
seii.i'rabfr ribs unchanged.

COFFEEâ C. E. Blckford's circular says: "Very
much the same conditions prevail as given In our
last report, and it is evident that any improve
ment in demand cannot be expected until the ap
-1 proaching National holidays are over. Although
prices have been held extremely well under the
circumstances, the market has not been able to re
sist the unusual siege of dullness, and sales, when
ever possible, w nt altogether in buyers' favor. In
some instances Quotations remain unaltered sim
ply for want of transactions upon which to base
values, but the desire to sell seems general and
concessions could undoubtedly be obtained upon
all except strictly fine qualities, the latter holding
ground through scarcity. Eastern markets are
without any features of interest and in the sama
lifeless condition. Receipts of new Coffee at the
Brazilian ports are early and full, aud crop esti
mates shortly expected are awaited with Interest

THE STOCK MARKET.
Last week was a bad one for the Comstocks, for
they declined steadily all the week, closing de
pressed yesterday at a fail of 15c to 30c from Fri
day's best prices. The decline during the six days
will be seen by tbe table of fluctuations below.
There is nothing whatever to maintain values at
the moment, as there is nothing goin/ on In the
mines beyond the usual routine work, and there
are no ore development of any consequence any
where. Hence the market Is falling back of its
own weight and the recent flurry now turns out to
have been a mere flash in the pan caused by a
pocket find In the Chollar.
The Geary-street, Park and Ocean Railroad
Company has declared a dividend of 50 cents per
share, payable on the 29th. This Is the one hun
dred and thirty-fourth dividend.
The Ca umet and Hecla copper Company of
Michigan has dec ared a dividend of $5 p'-T share,
or $500,000, payable July 13. Ibis will make
$45 850,000 paid in dividends by this famous mine.

PROTEST AGAINST
PRIVATE CONTRACTS
Merchants Have the Street-
Work System Investi
gated.
ORDER POUND ILLEGAL.
Say It Is Contrary to the Best
Interests of Property-
Owners.
AN EXHAUSTIVE REPORT MADE
Will Submit the Document for the
Consideration of the Super
visors.
The Merchants' Association has caused
to be made by their consulting engineer a
reinvestigation of the subject of havine
street work done by private contract. The
association has forwarded this report to
the board with the following letter:
To the Honorable Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of i>an Francionoâ Gentlemen:
The Merchants Association had occasion on
Decer . i > protest agaiust a system
of having street work done by private contract.
Accompanying the protest was a thorough re
port prepared at that time upon the contract
system by the consulting engineer ot this
association. On December 23, 1895, an
ordinance was passed by your honorable board
virtually abolishing the private contract
by stem 6f doing street work.
It is, thereiore, with great concern that this
association views the order passed by your
honorable board on the 2'2d inst. entitled
order X<Â». â , amendatory of section 28 of the
order 1588, relative to the construction and
u-e of streets and sidewalks. This order will
restore the system of doing street work by
private contract.
This association has, therefore, requested its
consulting engineer to investigate this subject
again and report upon :his new order to your
honorable board. Ilis report has just been re
cefved, and as it states that the order recently
i by your honorable board would be
illegal and* contrary to the best interests of
property-owners, we respectfully submit It to
â nsideraticn. We respectfully ask that
iio further action be taken in executing this
recent ordinance until the matter has been
folly Investigated, and if yon find the conclu
ii our engineer correct that further
action be Indefinitely postponed upon said
order.
Sax Francisco, .Tune 27, 1896.
T the Honorable tht I â¢ â >/ the
San Francifco â Gentlk-
HJEN: In response t>> a request for a report on
the question of private contracts and work
done under the proposed onier of the Boord of
Supervisors, which was passed to print last
Monday, I have to submit the following:
lon 8 <>f part 111 ot the general street
laws of the Htate of California, act of 1885,
defines the Street Superintendent as the per
son who shall have eharee of the streets, or
the improvement* thereof, in any city. The
power is m.t conferred on him by statute to
designate where work is necessary or should
be performed. Ihe power to order street work
done is vested alone in the Board of Super
ior the City Council. The Street Super
intendent ran only order repairs.
The courts have held that power to initiate
proceedings is vested only in tbe officials
designated by the Legislature (72 C'al., 404),
and that the power cannot be delegated by
such officials (35 Cal., 699, and also 47 Cal.,
Power to improve streets does not dispense
with the passage and publication of a resolu
tion of intention (52 Cal. 270), and in order to
recover a street assessment tne plaintiff must
show that ail statutory requirements have
been fulfilled. (47 Cal. 45Â« ; cited 47 Cal.
458,604. Also see 53 Cal. 45.)
There are many other decisions in the same
line, but enongh have been here given to show
that the order passed to print last Monday will
be void if passed by the board. When street
work is ordered there must first be a resolution
of intention passed, published and posted. It
must be followed by an order for the work,
etc-, and the object of all these proceedings
is to give the property-owner timely notice
and an opportunity to be heard.
Under the order now being discussed no
resolution of intention needs to be passed by
the board, and the Superintendent of Streets
receives greater power than the board itself
possesses. His order deprives the people of the
right of protest, and the board must by law
hear protests and stop work for six months
upon receipt of a protest. In granting the
Ptreet Superintendent greater power than it
possesses the board has passed an illegal order
and one against public interest.
The section mentioned reads as follows:
"Whenever the Superintendent of Public
Streets, Highways and Squares shall deem it
necessary, for the public good'or convenience,
to order the improvement of the roadway or
sidewalks of any public street, lane, alley,
place or court in the City and County of San
Francisco, not accepted by the City, or the re
construction or repair of any sewer already
constructed therein, he shall serve notice in
writing uPÂ°n the owners, tenants or occupants
of the loÂ»s or portions of lots fronting upon
such street, lane, alley, place or court upon or
in which the above-named improvement, re
construction or repair is required to be made,
Rnd the owner, tenant or occupant of lots or
portions of lots so notified as aforesaid shall,
within five days after receiving such notice,
commence such improvement, reconstruction
or repair, and prosecute the same diligently
until completion.''
It is claimed that the order is essentially the
same as section 13 of the act of 1885. l'f so,
there was no need of passing it to make such
section operative in San Francisco, as the act
is a general one and applies in all municipali
ties in the State. But there is a great differ
ence between the order and section 13, as the
latter begins as follows: "When any portion of
any street, avenue, lane, alley, court or place
in said .city improved, or any sidewalk con
structed thereon shall be out of repair or need
ing reconstruction and in condition to en
danger persons or property passing thereon,
or in condition to interfere with the public
convenience in the use thereof, it shall be the
duty of the Superintendent of Streets to require
by notice in writing to be delivered, etc., etc."
This section provides for work to be done on
streets which have been improved but not ac
cepted, and further, only provides for repairs.
No comment is needed. Under the law also,
as provided further on in the section, the
Street Superintendent must describe fully the
character and amount of work to be done and
tne materials and workmanship. On these
points the order is silent.
Subdivision 2 of the order unaer discussion
provides for the granting of permits for pri
vate contracts, but neglects to mention specifi
cations for the work or whether the work will
be accepted by the board or any official.
My former report of November, 1895, men
tioned the evils of private contracts as carried
out generally, bo it is not necessary to mention
some features. It is well to say, however, that
unless the work is performed in accordance
with specifications governing public work,
that a great injustice is done taxpayers.
Every man who pays for street work expects
to have the street accepted by the City, and it
is only right that the City officials see ton
that the work is done to the proper standard
and under their supervision. It is not right to
expect the taxpayers to maintain forever
streets which have not been properly con
structed in the first place. This is a matter in
which every resident is interested.
A resolution (No. 14.639) was passed last
Monday to grant permits for private contracts
on certain streets. If the permit was granted
and no provisions made for specifications or
acceptance by the City the property-owners
should take care that they are not being in
jured. Before paying for the work they should
understand where they have placed them
selves by signing the contract.
If the private contract was signed because ot
an order issued by the Street Superintendent
to do the work in five days they cannot be
compelled to pay for the work, for the order
compelling it was void and the contract being
eigned under compulsion was not right. Re
spectfully submitted,
Ernest McCui.locgh.
On Monday the association will send
copies of the following letter to 2000 of the
leading firms of the city :
To the. Merchant* and Taxpayers of San Fran
eiteeâ Hear Hiw: Your immediate attention
iB respectfully called to the circular letter sent
te you at our request by the Board of Election
Commissioners, requesting you to have some
el your clerki lerve v official clerks at tne
approaching election, for which they will be
duly compensated by the City.
The coming gem-ml election on November 3
is of special significance to the present and
future of our ( ity. Tne question of the adop
tion of a new charter for San Francisco will
then be decided. It is therefore highly im
portant that competent and reliable clerks
and watchers be stationed in the election pre
cincts, so as to insure a correct and prompt
couiit of the ballots cast. This association has
arranged to co-operate with the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners in providing as many as
possible of the election clerks from the clerical
lorce of the business community.
You are, therefore, earnestly and urgently
requested to have one or more of your clerks
serve in that capacity; and fill out the election
blanks sent to you by the flection Commis
sioners. If you have already done so, please
send duplicates of the same immediately to
this office. If you have not yet complied with
the request of the Election Commissioners,
please ao so at once and torward duplicates to
this office.
Any further information that you may desire
will be cheerfully furnished in person or by
letter upon application to the oflice of the
Merchants' Association.
You are, no doubt, aware that at the last
election grave frauds worn perpetrated at the
ballot-box, which this association will en
deavor to prevent. For this, as well as the
foregoing reasons, we hope that you will give
this very important matter your prompt atten
tion.
LATE SPORTING NEWS.
Boxing Tournament of the Acme Club.
Trap-Shooting Contests.
A bantam-weight boxing tournament
for the championship of the Pacific Coast
will be held in the Oakland Athletic Club
gymnasium on Tuesday evening next.
An excellent programme has been ar
ranged for the occasion, which consists
of wrestling matches between Harry Gel
der, the champion feather-weight, and R.
Wixon of the lightweight class. In all
probability J. M. Whelan will be matched
to box an unknown at K>~) pounds.
It is amusing to note the many chal
lenges that are now being hurled at Cor
bett by fighters who have long since been
declared past numbers. Every pugilist
whose hide is saturated with bad liquor
is now looking for notoriety, and the
sooner those broken-down pugs depart for
the happy lands of Jordan the better it
will be for the sport of fisticuffs.
A meeting of novices in the art of blue
rock shooting was held in Alamc-da
Wednesday evening, June 24, for the pur
pose of effecting the organization of a club
to encourage outdoor sport and to give the
members a.n opportunity of shooting in
animate targets at a minimum of cost.
The name "Encinal Gun Club" was
adopted, and the following officers elected:
H. A. Hoy. v , president; J. J. Knight, vice
president; L. A. Hagy, secretary; H. Bet
ten, treasurer; F. Schultz, captain; direc
tors â J. Cummings, William Murdock, G.
W. Lewis.
Monthly shoots will be held at Birds
Point and prizes will be given to members
making the best scores." The club starts
with twenty charter members.
After the regular shoot of the Empire
Club, wnich will be held to-morrow after
noon at the Empire grounds, Alameda, a
fifty-bird open race will take place. The
entrance fee is $2 50 and splendid prizes
are offered.
â \Vork has been commenced on the exca
vations for the Acme Athletic Club's new
home on the north side of Eleventh street,
near Broadway, Oakland. The building
wili be a handsome one on the Venetian
order, with a front of pressed brick and
stone. In the basement will be a large
swimming-tank. A room for the wheel
men will also be provided. On tne second
floor offices will be arranged, while on the
third floor a magnificent gymnasium will
be constructed. It is expected that tne
building will be ready for occupancy in
October.
De Witt Van Court, tne boxing in
structor who was recently discharged
from tbe Acme CluD, has been engaged
by the Reliance Club, and will commence
giving instructions in boxing to the mem
bers on the Ist of July.
Professor Ai Lean, who is wrestling in
structor of the Reliance Club, was severely
injured by a weight falling on this back
while training for the Caledonia games.
Lean is sufficiently recovered to go to
work, and is once again teaching his pupils
how to wrestle.
NEW MUNICIPAL BUILDING
Drillroom to Be Located
in the Base
ment.
Other Changes Recommended by
the Commitcte of tbe
Supervisors.
Important changes will be made in the
plans for the new municipal building to
be erected on the old City Hall site. Chief
of Police Crowley and Architect Frank
Shea were heard yesterday forenoon at a
meeting of the Municipal Building Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors.
The subject of locating the drillroom
and the dormitories for the police on the
basement floor was discussed in tne pres
ence of Supervisors Benjamin, Wagner,
Hirsch and King.
It appeared from the discussion that the
driilroom. if located on the UDper floor,
would interfere with the business of the
courts and the departments below, as it
would be impossible to entirely deaden
the sound of a large body of men drilling.
It was argued that the vibration would
cause damage to the buildin -, notwith
standing all precautions, while the location
of the prison in the basement would be
undesirable by reason of the odor arising
from the kitchen.
The location of the prison on the upper
floor would allow of proper ventilation and
be an advantage to the safe keeping of the
persons therein confined, while the loca
tion of the drillroom and dormitories in
the basement would permit the force to be
ready for immediate service, which would
not be the case if located on the upper
floor.
The Chief of Police informed the com
mittee that in the municipal building of
Philadelphia the prison was located on the
upper floor and in his opinion it was &
good idea and worthy of trial.
Mr. Shea told the committee that it
would take fotir weeks' time to prepare
proper plans and specifications. In order
to carry out the intention of the board and
the wishes of property-owners he would
work day and night to complete the task.
As the buildings to be erected are for
the police and several departments and
also for a public Morsue and must be let
in one contract, bidders must specify a
sum for which the same can be con
structed. â  It was the expressed intention
of the architect to have the buildings com
pleted in ten months' time from the day
of signing the contract.
The committee decided to recommend
that the Board of Supervisors should at
once direct the architects to make the
changes in the plans as above suggested.
The new plans may also contain a more
spacious and convenient entrance on Mer
chant street, as business men nnd otherj
east of Kearny street and south of Wash
ington will prefer to enter the hall on
Merchant street rather than walk around
to Kearny and Washington streets.

AMADOR COUNTY'S
MINING ACTIVITY
Work Is Resumed on a
Mine Which Has Paid
Handsomely.
UNION CONSOLIDATED.
Immense Bodies of Ore of a
Paying Quality in
Sight.
A PERFECTLY IQTJIPPEP MINE.
They Are Now Sinking the Shaft to a
Depth of One Thousand
Feet.
Amador County is advancing rapidly to
the first place among the gold-producing
sections of the State, and, singular as it
may seem, this section of the great gold
belt, though having yielded millions of
dollars' worth of the precious metal, is still
in its infancy as a quartz-mining region.
In the early fifties, and up to within a
recent period, the miners of Amador
County confined their operations to placer
mining principally, and not until the now
famous Kennedy and Zeile mines aston
ished the mining experts of this ana
European countrirs, did the people of
Amador realize tnat within its confines
was more wealth contained than its most
visionary citizen ever dreamed of.
Then commenced a system of deep min
ing which is developing this class of prop
erty not only on the mother lode, but in
some instances miles away from the parent
lode.
One of the remarkable instances of that
fact is the Union Consolidated, formerly
known as the Clinton Consolidated. Ttiis
property is situated eight miles southeast
from Jackson, toward the Volcano district.
Some years ago more than a quarter of
a million dollars' worth of gold was taken
from this mine, although at that time it
ha i not reached the 300 level. Re
cently the mine has been purchased by
practical mining men and material addi
tions to the working capacity of the plant
has been the result.
During the period that the property re
mained idle water filled the shaft to the
200-foot level, and as the main shaft is
down to a distance of 330 feet it required
some expenditure to relieve the shaft;
but, with the perfect pumping appliances
now in use, as large as any on the coast, it
only required ten days to get the mine in
vorKing order.
A tunnel 1400 feet in length taps the
shaft at the 200-foot level, and at the
level of 300 feet two drifts, one of 210 and
one of 280 feet, extend on either side of
the shaft, and an immense body of ore is
in sight, ore which has averaged from $13
to $10 per ton.
When the n<ain tunnel reaches the shaft
at a depth of 200 feet it is the intention of
the company to pump all water from the
lower levels into this tunnel and thereby
send the surplus water about 1500 feet

from the shaft. The equipment of this
mine is most thorough. The hoisting en
gine, of the most, improved pattern, is
from the Risdon Iron Works, while the
pumping engine is an Erie.
Both of these are operated by water ob
tained from the Volcano ditch, but a short
distance away. This water is afterward
utilized to furnish power for the air com
pressor, thus economizing as far as is
practical. The nir compressor, thus set
in motion by the surplus waste of water
from the main shaft, is capable of running
three machine drills. These drills have
been started, and work in sinking will not
stop until tbe 1000 level has been reached.
Over |500,C00 has been expended in the
Union, but that is a smaii sum compara
tively with what is in sight. There is
now a thirty-stamp mill in operation and
another of like capacity will be erected
soon. This fact alone bespeaks an im
plicit faith in the future of the Union, so
far as the company is concerned. With
sixty stamps from 140 to 200 tons of ore
may be crushed daily.
The nine-inch pump, connected with a
twelve-inch column, is capable of keeping
the mine dry unuer any circumstances.
It is run by a ten-foot Pelton water-wheel
fed from the ditch with a fall of 19<i feet.
Thirty-five men are now at work in the
Union, and there is no doubt but that
double that number will soon be needed.
As an illustration of the faith of the
stockholders in this mine, one has but to
look at the perfect equipments and the
commodious quarters designed for the
comfort of the employes. The superin
tendent's residence, in close proximity
to the main works, is a substantial and
cozy home, presided over by one of the
women who make men's fortunes.
Then there are tenement-houses fitted
up with a view toward the comfort and
convenience of the married operatives and
a large and convenient boarding-hou?e
capable of accommodating sixty men for
the single ones.
The Union Consolidated Company owns
800 acres of patented land, and the ledge
now itl sight is not the only one which in
all probability will be struck, as another
tunnel is being pushed in another direc
tion with every prospect of running into
a new body of pay ore.
It is these vast bodies of low-grade ore,
almost limitless and always paying, which
are fast acquiring for Amador County a
reputation which miiiht be envied by any
mining section in the world.
A chlorination works, a timber-yard, ad
joining tlib shaft building, and a large
blacksmith-shop completes as fine an
equipment as could be required lor the
successful operation of any mine in the
State.
WIDOWS ARE HIS BANE.
Edward BartHch Arrested on a Charge
of Insanity and Released on His
Own Recognizance.
Edward Bartsch, manager of the Kirk
wood Hard Rubber Company, was ar
rested yesterday morning charged with
being Insane. He was taken before Judge
liebbard and his examination was con
tinued till to-morrow morning. Attorney
Davis later procured his release by Judge
Slack on his own recognizance.
Bartsch declares that the charge of in
sanity is simply a continuation of a sys
tem of persecution to which he had for
years been subjected from Mrs. A. L.
Childs, a widow of Sacramento.
"In 1889," said Bartsch, "I entered into
partnership with Jacob Hoehn of Sacra
mento for the manufacture of a patent,
Hoetin paying in $5000 for a half interest.
Hoehn died in IMW and his widow sold
one-half of her interest to Mrs. Ghilds for
$XOOO. The business did not pay and Mrs.
Hoehn put into it the $3000 she received
from Mrs. Childs. Then Mrs. Childs sued
Mrs. Hoen in Judge Catlin's court for the
$3000 and judgment was given against
her. Since tlien she has been trying to
injure me in every possible way.
"I have been unfortunate with widows.
I married one and soon found I had made
a great mi stake. Then I had one as a
partner and she took in another one into
the business by selling her a half interest
and she is doing all she can to ruin me." '

MANY LADIES TO SPEAK
Rev. Anna Shaw Has Planned
Out a Lively Two Months'
Campaign.
M'GOWAN WILL GO ON STTJMP.
The Story of Hew Indomitabla Suf
fragists Got a Big Audience
at Fortuna.
There was rejoicing at the Suffrage
headquarters yesterday over the brilliant
success of Friday's ratification meeting in
Metropolitan Temple.
"The audience was more than half men,
and that was unprecedented at a woman's
suffrage meeting," said Miss Susan B.
Anthony. "That very fact shows that the
men are interested. They have been
largely helped to become so by seeing a
paper of the standing of The Call come
out for suffrage."
Miss Anna Shaw left yesterday after
noon for Santa Barbara, where she will
rest for a week and be the guest of Dr. Ida
Stanback. One week's rest is all she in
tends to allow herself. At the end of that
time she will go to speak on the 11th and
13th of July at the Chautauqua meeting at
Oregon City, and on tne Sunday between
those two dates she will preach at Port
land.
From Oregon Miss Shaw will visit a
number of Chautauqua meetings, prin
cipally in the East and the Middle West,
lecturing at all of them. Toward tne
middle of August, she will turn her face
westward again and will reach Boise City,
Idaho, in time for the Republican State
Nominating Convention, when the women
will hold a State Suffrage campaign, sim
ultaneously with the men'r* convention.
At Boise City Miss Shaw will be joined by
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt of New York
and after the convention sne will come
back at once to California, to plunge into
the campaign work in September.
The Ciautauquans at Pacific Grove have
oflered the California suffragists a whole
day during the coming meetings, and July
17 has been chosen. Among the speakers
on that occasion will be: Miss Susan B.
Anthony. Mrs. A. A. Sargent, Mrs. E. O.
Smith of Ban Jose and Miss Mary G. Hay.
There will be three sessions during the
day. and it is expected that a good deal of
enthusiasm will be stirred up, which will
result in votes for the amendment. On
the 20th Miss Anthony will lecture, and
on the 2lst, Miss Shaw, who expects to
pay a visit to Pacific Grove, will also be
heard.
Miss Yates, another of the Eastern lec
turers, bade farewell to her friends at the

headquarters yesterday. Slie leaves for |
the East to-morrow. Miss Harriet Mills
is stfll lecturing in Humboldt County and
expects to stir up a suffrage wave in Del
Norte County before September. Miss
Anthony will remain here all summer,
with occasional trips to interior towns.
To-day she speaks at Mill Valley.
Mrs. Smith, an ardent suffragist, arrived
here yesterday from Humboldt County.
She says that the way in which the men,
especially the young men, attended Miss
Shaw's lectureswas something quite re
markable. "For one thing, people ad
mired Miss Sliaw's pluck," she said.
"There was one occasion that was a good
deal cited. Through some mistake in the
date, when Miss Shaw and the other speak
ers arrived at Fortuna they found no one
to welcome them and no hall taken fox
them to lecture in. Did they give up?
Not a bit of it. They took a hall right
away and hired a boy to go round with a
bell, calling 'Woman's suffrage meeting
to-night!' The hall was crowded and
Fortuna got suffrage before the lecturers
left."
Senator McGowan of Hnmboldt County
has announced his intention ol stumping
the State for suffrage this fall, however
the fortunes of politics may treat him per
sonally.

TO SAVE CITY LOTS.
3layor Sutro Advises That a Cortect
Survey Be Made at Once.
Mayor Sutro has sent a communication
to the Board of Supervisors stating that
the records of the Surveyor's office show
that in block 6, New Potrero, there are
some City lots. According to a diagram
sent to the Mayor's office at the request of
the acting Mayor, C. L. Taylor, the west
ern boundary of such lots intersects the
northern line of Fifteenth street. It fur
ther appears that on the easterly side of
Harrison street a Drivate owner or claim
ant has erected a fence inclosing a yard.
It is suggested that the City and County
Surveyor should at once be directed to
make a correct survey to protect the City
interests.
