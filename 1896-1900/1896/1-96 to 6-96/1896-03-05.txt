LONDON, Ems.; March 4.â The Daily
Telegraph to-morrow will publish a dis
patch from Rome stating that the Italian'
losses in Sunday's battle with the Abys
sinians were 10,000 killed, wounded or
â  taken prisoners. â  Of these 5000 were slain.
The Daily News to-morrow will publish !
a dispatch from its Rome correspondent
sayine that General Baratieri upon his re
turn to Italy will be tried by court-martial
under articles 72 and 88 of the military
code which fix the punishment for officers
who abandon their posts before the enemy
with degradation to the ranks, followed
by death.
The charges against Baratieri are based
upon his own admission that he left the
field while the troops under his command
were fighting, without knowing the fate of
the columns under Generals Dabormida
and Ariraondi, and retreated 100 kilo
metres in twenty-four hours. . .
A dispatch to the Central News from
Rome says that of the 247 officers under
General. Baratieri who took part in the
battle against the Abyssinians of Sunday
only forty returned. Among the killed
were General Albertone and Colonel Gal
liano, the latter of whom was in command
of the Italian garrison which defended
Makalie when that place was besieged by
t'.e Abyssinians. -â '. S>*
General Ariraondi - was-, seriously
mounded. DaborraidÂ«, with i the S
remnant of his brigade, succeeded in re

fought their way through the enemy's
lines.

BAR 4TIERI DEPOSED.
Summoned to Home to Explain Hit Con-

ROME, Italy, March 4.â A royal decree
has been promulgated relieving General
Baratieri of his functions as Governor
of the African pravince of Erythrea.
General Baratieri is reported to have
been temporarily placed on half-pay and
summoned to Rome to explain his con
duct of the Abyssinian campaign, which
has resulted so disastrously.
Popolo Romani says that the Cabinet
will meet Parliament to-morrow, March 5,

military measures.
Advices from Massowah received by the
Government announce that General
Baldissera, the newly appointed corn
i mande-in-chief of the Italian forces in
! Africa, assumed command to-day.
The Government bas instructed the mil
; itary Advocate-General to examine into
i the conduct of the Abyssinian campaign
iby General Baratieri and determine
| whether or not the latter shall be ar
! raigned before a council of war.
It is stated that Baldissera is due to ar
rive at Asmera, toward which place the
Italian troops are said to be retreating on
the 6th inst. and that there he will meet
; General Baratieri.
Long official dispatches from Massowah
! under the date of March 3 give technical
I details of the positions and movements of
! the Italian troops engaged in Sunday's
1 battle with the Abyssinians.
According to these advice- the troops in
; the morning occupied two ridges in the
j vicinity of Adowa, but they were com
pelled to abandon these positions by im
mense phalanxes of the enemy. The
fighting was evidently of a terrific chaaac
[ ter and the retreat of most of the battal
ions was a mere iout.
The roost contradictory reports are in
i circulation and it is impossible to obtain
any reliable information as to the gravity
of the defeat of the Government forces.
All last night the garrison in Rome was
kept under arms and mounted patrols
| traversed the principal streets. The
streets were filled with people until day
; break, and after early morning every pub
lic place was crowded with excited men
and women.
Several disturbances which called for
police interference occurred to-day and
the indications are tnat the people are as
! suming a most threatening attitude, not
, only in Rome, but throughout Italy.
Demonstrations against Crispi's ministry,
and even against the crown, are reported
from the provinces in spite of the fact that
the authorities are straining every nerve
to suppress all alarming news.
Later in the day the news from the
provinces became more alarming. It was
stated that in a number of places the po
; lice had been unable to cope with the
; populace, and troops had been called upon
to restore order. The soldiers, however,
appear to have been as helpless as the
police, and in several places crowds were
fired upon. One man was killed and sev
eral wounded. This increased the excite
ment. The troops were stoned and had to
clear the public square at the point of the
j bayonet.
Dispatches from Venice say that last
; night a crowd assembled at the Piazzi
of St. Mark and speeches were made con
demning the manner in which the Abys
sinian campaign had been conducted and
calling upon the military authorities to try
: General Baratieri by court-martial.
There was another popular demonstra

! and the mob was only dispersed by the

MADRID, Spain, March 4.â A party of
students this morning invited the female
employes in several cigar factories to unite
with them in a demonstration of protest
against the legislation of the United States
Congress in regard to Cuba. Their invita
tion, however, was declined.
A group of university students and citi
zens who were attempting to incite the
public to make a riotous demonstration
to-day were charged by the police with
drawn swords and were driven into near
by cafes and houses. A number of them
toofc refuge in the university, where they
trampled upon and afterward burned an
American flag. Sixteen of the rioters
were taken into custody and will be se
verely punished.
Senor Elduayen, who was recently ap
pointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in
succession to the Duke of Tetuan, has re
signed. A meeting of the Cabinet was
held this evening, at which Senor Eldu
ayan announced that he had tendered his
resignation because he believed it to be de
sirable that the same Minister who begins
negotiations with the United States and
other countries in regard to the Cuban
question should complete them. It is
understood that the Duke of Tetuan will
succeed the retiring Foreign Minister and
that he will take the oath of office to-mor
row.
At the meeting it was decided that the
universities should be closed for the pres
ent. The Ministers also agreed to an un
limited credit for the purchase of artillery
and io call for recruits of naval infantry
and sailors.
A demonstration was attempted this
afternoon by the students of the univer
sity, but the police were on the alert and
the disorderly proceedings were speedily
suppressed. Later 400 students of the
School of Medicine and a number of citi
zens who bad joined them were dispersed
by the police.
They soon reassembled, however, whist
ling at and jeering the officers. One
group of students, who were standing
close by a lieutenant of police called the
latter a coward and several of them at
tempted to strike him, whereupon the
lieutenant drew his revolver. The police
and gendarmes immediately charged with
drawn swords upon the rioters. In the
melee which ensued a few persons were
injured. All places of business in the
neighborhood were closed.
A dispatch from Panama to the Impar
cial says a notice bas been posted secretly

LOST TO TUB CUB Ay 8.
Revenue Officer* Setze a Schooner Carry-
ing Arms to the Island.
TAMPA, Fla., March 4.â The revenue
cutter Morrill arrested the schooner
Stephen R. Mallory at Long Boat Inlet,
at 6 o'clock, on a charge of being a filibus
ter. The Morrill arrived at Port Tampa
yesterday and sailed to-day at 3 o'clock
under sealed orders. She proceeded
straight to the golf, an had instructions
to arrest both the Mallory and the Artie 11.
The Mallory was sighted off Long Boat
and it is said that the cutter had to send a
shot across her bow before she would lay to.
On being boarded it was found that she
had a crew of five men besides the captain,
all Americans, and was heavily loaded
with arms and ammunition.
The cutter has arrived at the port with
the schooner* and reported the capture to
Collector of Customs Leslie, who has re
ported tbe matter to the department at
Washington and placed the schooner in
charge of a Deputy United States Mar
shal.
It had been rumored in this city for
several days that the Mallory and Ardell
would sail for Cuba wilh ammunition for
the insurgents, and Vice-Consul Solis had
been on the alert, and, it is rumored, had
already notified the authorities at Wash
ington of the intention of the two boats.
The Mallory is only about six months
old. She is of 40 tons . burden, fast and
seaworthy, and is owned by Cottrell and
Finlayson of Cedar Keys, the former of
whom is Collector of Customs at that port.
The arms are supposed to be the same that
were seized near Cedar Keys several
months ago by the authorities. The cargo
of the Mallory is valued at $20,000. Her
papers show that she was cleared from Ce
dar Keys for Fort Meyers,

HAVANA, Cuba (via Key West, Fla.),
March 4.â The Government is holding 8000
troops quartered in the fortifications of
the city in readiness to suppress disorder
and demonstrations against Americana
here. Extra police guards are placed con
venient to the American consulate. The
only manifestations of hostile feeling yet
were a few shouts, "Death to Uncle Sam !"
while the new troops were landing Tues
day and hisses round the cab in which
two Americans were driven in a side
street. There are some apprehensions but
no alarm among American residents.
There is great confidence in the ability of
General Weyler to preserve order.
The better treatment of Americans here
than at Barcelona or Madrid, is largely
duo to the fact that the populace there is
Spanish and here they are Cubans. The
students here, both Spanish and Cuban,
are friendly to the States. Cuban property
holders and merchants, and also many
Spanish, whose markets are in the Btates,
are more plea?ed than otherwise, at the
prospect of Congressional intervention,
which, meaning an early restoration of
auiet, would save many from bankruptcy.
Even local Spaniards admit this. Such
hostility as is shown is confined here to
the office-holding classes and to others re
ceiving Government bounty.
The main body of insurgents, instead of
continuing eastward as expected, has re
turned to Havana province in great num
bers, leaving a large force of troops mov
ine east to head them off. Gomez remains
in the center of Matamzas province burn

tions were being made to resume grinding.
Maceo, with a largely augmented force,
has re-entered Havana province and re
sumed burning cane wherever preparations
to grind are under way. So far as can be
learned, there is no wanton destruction,
but they are simply carrying out the order
issued by Gomez two jnonths ago.

FREDERICK POLLOCK'S REPORT.
English Contention Said to Have Been
Borne Out by the Spanish
Archives.
LONDON, Esq., March 4. â The St.
James Gazette, under the caption "The
British Case Against Venezuela," pub
lishes two columns of matter which it
claims is a summary of the report made
by Sir Frederick Pollock for submission to
Parliament. The Gazette says that be
sides having at bis disposal documents in
the possession of the British Colonial and
Foreign Offices, Sir Frederick Pollock has
drawn freely from information made ac
cessible to the British Government by the
Keepers of the Archives of Spain and Hol
land.
The material supplied by Holland covers
the period from the latter part of the six
teenth century to the second decade of the
nineteenth century, and tbe Spanish docu
ments cover the period since the first
ascent of the Amazon by Orellana in 1642,
and from the first ascent of the Orinoco by
Juan Martinez, until Venezuela, in 1830,
assumed independent existence.
The evidence includes the particulars
and circumstances under which the Eng
lish took possession of the Dutch West
India colonies in 1781, 1796 and 1803 and
the treaties under which these transfer
ences were ratified. The evidence also in
cludes the story of correspondence and
negotiation with the various governments
by Venezuela from 1840 down to the pres
ent time.
The information supplied by the Colonial
Office comprises that collected by ihe suc
cessive Governors of the territory since
the administration of Colonel Nicholson
in 1803 as regards the extent and charac
ter of the Dutch occupation and explora
tion of the interior, and also the details of
the Venezuelan incursions into British
territory between the Orinoco and the
Guyani; the attempt of American con
cessionaires to establish themselves in
British Guiana ; the steps taken to main
tain British ownership, and the work done
by Great Britain to ascertain the natural
and geographical boundary, without preju
dice to, strict territorial rights beyond such
boundary.
These documents, with important maps
bearing thereon, show a British case of
overwhelming strength against Vene
zuela's pretensions of ownership to the
west bank of the Essequibo.
The report shows that the Dutch had
from the earliest times possession of the
coast of Guiana as far north as tue mouth
of the Orinoco, such possession implying
the right of ownership of the Hinterland,
a right exercised by the Dutch. One of the
early Dutch maps, printed in Amsterdam
in 1774. shows the line of partition accord
ing to the bull issued by Pope Alexander
VI, allotting the whole of Booth America
west of the Amazon to Spain and the
whole of the territory on the east of the
Amazon to Portugal.
To the west, of this is a large section, ex
tending from the Amazon to the mouth of
the Orinoco, marked "Guyani." This is
divided in twain, the Dutch part extend
ing from Barima to the river Mariwini
and the French part from Mariwini to
Cape Nord, on the delta of the Amazon.
The Spanish settlement of St. Thome, on
the Orinoco, appears on this map, but the
Dutch line from Barima is identical with
the line representing the extreme British
claim.
Sir Frederick Pollock claims that the
Spaniards at no time established them
selves in Guiana proper until they overran
part of the British territory to the Cuyani
in and since 1858. They cot no further
than tlie Orinoco. The fact that St. Thome
is marked on the French map as the ex
treme limit of their stations is borne out
by a Dutch map, which, in 1798, was pre
pared for the Committee of the Colonies
of the Batavian Republic by Major yon
Luchenroeder.
This map was prepared to assist the
statesmen who were negotiating the ces
sion of the Dutch colonies in South Amer
ica to the British. Sir Frederick gives de
tails showing that it was upon the basis of
this and simiJar maps that the cession was
effected.
Correspondence taken from the archives
shows that when the Spanish showed
themselves in the Cuyani Valley the
Dutch Government vigorously protested
to Spain against the encroachments of her
subjects upon Dutch territory. The ar
chives show that Spain did not answer the
protests of the Dutch Government. Cer
tainly Spain did not assert her ownership
of the region in question. The States-
General of Holland in 1759 and in 1769 set
for the Dutch territorial rights and de
manded reparation for Spanish violation
thereof. The correspondence showed that
the Dutch asserted ownership of the entire
watershed of the Essequibo, and laid great
stress upon their rights to the Cuyani,
upon the upper reaches of which stream
they had established gold diggings, and
had been on terms of intercourse with the
Indian tribes therefor 150 years in making
researches.
The evidence which Spain placed at the
disposal of the Foreign Office shows that
Spain did not rebut the claim made by the
Dutch to the territory throughout the
basin of the Cuyani.
The Dutch archives are so well kept that
Sir Frederick Pollock has been aDle to
make an irrefragable case for British own
ership of the Cuyani basin as having been
inherited in the Dutch, though no absolute
evidence is adducible to show how far the
Dutch held the country between the natu
ral geographical delimitation known as
the Scbomburg line and the bank of the
Orinoco.
The report, after exhausting the evidence
prior to English acquisition of the coun
try, deals with the more recent diplomatic
aspects of the case, which are not sum
marized.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 4.â The
United Press cablegram giving a summary
of the brief in the boundary dispute pre
pared by Professor Sir Frederick j Pollock
was I read i with deep interest by mem bers
of the Venezuelan Commission ;in town
to-day. Entirely without prejudice to the
merits of ,'a case which, of course, cannot
be weighed until all the evidence accom
panying Professor Pollock's argument is
disclosed, the Commissioners are evi
dently gratified- that the British Govern-;
ment with all the resources it has enjoyed
for securing evidence has apparently not
obtained much if any more testimony
than the \ commission ! has been able ito
collect here during its short but energetic
existence. .'
' The , Government of Venezuela had
already furnished to the State Department,
before the United States intervened in the
affair ' last July, most of the correspond
ence which had been carried on with Great
Britain, and ( complete . copies :of all j the
documents are promised by Venezuela be
fore the end of this week. : ; ;- ;-' : :
, :At , the Venezuelan legation I the state
ment of the British case was declared to
be pitiably weaK and easily disposed â¢ of.
Minister Andrade said it did not contain
an item which c had not already been fully
met and disproved in documents furnished
to Secretaries Bayard and Gresham by the
Venezuelan - Government. All ; the argu
ments now presented :by Sir Frederick
Pollock which had not been included in
Lord j Salisbury's â¢ letters of November '26
last, | leading ; , to President Cleveland's
special message, had already been aban
doned by British statesmen. It 'was pre
posterous now for Great Britain' to attempt
to !go ."â  behind â  the treaty lof Munster to
show that the Dutch had settlements in
Guiana, for, up to that time, Holland was
a Spanish dependency, just as Guiana was.
With the \ recognition of the indepen
dence of l the Dutch by the treaty of â  Mun
ster in - 1648 the Essequibo became the
eastern boundary of the Spanish posses
sions, and by the treaty of Utrecht in 1783
England obligated herself to â¢ enforce that
boundary. The Dutch colonies . did not
\ pass to English until ; 1796, and from that
time until 1836, forty years, every English
map, ; cyclopedia, history or ".. other , , work
bearing on Guiana gave either the Esse
quibo or the Pomaron as the western Eng
lish limit. IT Barinia, at the mouth of the
Orinoco, may have been occupied by the
Dutch when Spain was sovereign of :: Hol
land, as shown by early maps, but Minis
ter Andrade ? noted that [ Sir Frederick
Pollock has : found no '{ map giving the
Dutch that point after the treaty of Mun
ster.
No fear is expressed by the members of
the legation as to the result of the Ven
ezuelan Commission's labors. Th3y are
confident that the decision will be entirely
in conformity with the Venezuelan con
tention.

HELENA, Mont., March 4.â The fire at
the Bozeman tunnel is still burning
fiercely and there are no prospects of ex

estimate. The tunnel is now probably a
total wreck. A large gang of men is
building a track around the cave-in, and
in the meantime passengers, baggage and
express are transferred by wagons over the
mountains, a distance of several miles.
Freight trains arc all blockaded and the

The temporary track will probably be

SCHEME OF REORGANIZATION
Outstanding Bonds and Liens to Dis
appear Before a New
Mortgage. *
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.-J. A.
Mnnroe, freight traffic manager of the
Union Pacific Railroad, appeared before
the House Committee on Pacific Railroads
to-day. He gave statistics showing the
earnings Irom freight traffic of his road for
several years past. He had no argument
or suggestions to make regarding the
settlement of the differences of the Pacific
roads by Congress. He assumed that the
earning capacity of the roads, particularly
in the future, would be an important
figure in the settlement. The gross earn
ings of the Union Pacific, he thought,
would not in the near future exceed $14,
--000,000 per annum. Of this amount not
more than 25 per cent could be considered
as net.
W. S. Pierce, representing the reorgan
ization committee of the Union Pacific,
told the House committee that it was the
purpose of that committee to exchange for
every class which is charged upon the
properties embraced in reorganization
new securities in proper proportions to
those issued by the reorganized company,
so that under the new mortgage of the re
organized company ali these properties
would be includedâ ths lines of road, the
lands, the equipment, the terminals and
the appurtenant property of the Union
Pacific proper between Council Bluffs and
a point five miles west of Ogden and be
tween Kansas City and Denver and be
tween Denver and Cheyenne, including
the Omaha bridge, subject to no existing
liens, and subject only to the new mort-
In other words, ell outstanding bonds
and mortgages were to disappear, and the
railroads, terminals, lands and equipments
of the Union Pacific were to be subject to
no other charge than that imposed by the
new mortgage to be issued by the reor
ganized company. All outstanding bonds
were to be provided for in the reorganiza
tion by the issue of new bonds and pre
ferred stock. The new bonds were to bear
4 per cent interest, to run fifty years, and
be secured by a first mortgage upon all
the railroads and property now embraced
in the mortgages which it was proposed to
retire. The amount of the new bonds was
placed at $51,244,720, imposing upon the
new company an interest charge of $2,049,.
788 against an interest charge on the same
bonds as they now stand of about $3,698,
--234, the saving amounting to about $1,648,
--448 per annum.
There would of course, he said, be no
question as to the issue of new 4 per cent
bonds to retire first mortgage bonds,
which were a lien ahead of the Govern
ment on aided parts of the road. As to 'the
issue of $18,401,720 of new 4 per cent bonds
in retirement of all mortgages on non
aided parts of the road there would be no
question if the value of the property cov
ered by these mortgages and contributed
to the new security was equal to or in ex
cess of that sum.
The net earnings of the Union Pacific
for 1894, about $4,315,000, had been taken
by the reorganization committee under
the progressively declining conditions
which had affected this property as the
outside limit of net earnings of the entire
Union Pacific Railway, upon which it
would be safe to rely in reorganization,
and the plan of reorganization contem
plated that provision for all outstanding
securities and moderate provision for fu
tuse corporate requirements should not
result in a fixed charge ever exceeding
$4,000,000. It was believed oy the commit
tee that any reorganization upon a higher
ultimate basis of fixed charges would be
unwise and would afford no guaranty
against future insolvency and the neces
sity of future reorganization.
It was the purpose of the reorganization
committee to meet the representatives of
the Government upon any practical basis
of adjustment, notwithstanding it might
accord to the Government relatively better
terms than those afforded toother security
holders. Under the conditions referred to,
and whicn continued to prevail and in
crease, it was obviously unsafe to reorgan
ize the property at any greater present fixed
charge than about $3,600,000 per annum
and if it was to be reorganized upon this

IX THE ATE.
Dvponi's Claim, to a Senatorial Toga
Under Consideration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.â The
Senate entered to-day upon the considera
tion of the question whether Henry A.
Dupont has been or not legally elected
United States Senator from the State of
Delaware. Although the facts in the case
are conceded on both sides of the cham
ber, the lega.l point is one on which the
two political parties take opposite views,
and on that opposition hinges a dispute
which may occupy the time of the Senate
for weeks to come. It seems tiiat in the
Delaware joint Assembly on the 9th of
May, 1895, Mr. Dupont received 15 votes
out of a total of 80 cast. But as to one of
the 30 votes it is contended on the part of
Mr. Dupont that it was illegal and void, it
having been cast by Mr. Watson,
a Senator who had on the
death of the Governor succeeded
to that office, and who could not, as
claimed by the Republican members of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections,
legally or constitutionally act as Senator.
In that case the total legal vote cast being
119, Mr. Dupont would have received a
majority and would be entitled to a seat in
the Senate. The contention on the part
of the Democratic members of the com
mittee is that the exercise oi duties as
Governor by Mr. \Vatson did not divest
him of his rights as a State Senator, and
that at all events that was a question to be
determined dv the Senate of Delaware, and
not by the Senate of toe United States.
Mitchell of Oregon, chairman of the
Committee on Privileges and Elections,
made the opening argument in favor of
the right of 'Dupont. He spoke for three
and a half hours, and had not concluded
his speech when the matter was laid aside
for the Jay.
The following bills irere passed :
Senate bill appropriating $10,000 each
for the purchase of sites for public build
ings in Hastings and Norfolk, Nebr.
Senate bill granting a pension of |75 a
month to the widow of ex-Senator Spencer

Futile Attempts to Change the Fee and \
'Salary Amendment.
WASHINGTON", D. C., March 4.- After
passing a few respectively unimportant
bills the House spent the rest of to-day's
session in consideration in committe of
the whole of the fee and salary amend
ment to the legislative, executive and
judicial appropriation bill. The whole
time -was spent upon the section fixing the
salaries of the District Attorneys of the
Federal courts, which range from $2000 to
$5000. The section was made the target
for nearly a score of amendments, mostly
intended to increase the sum allotted in
various districts, but the committee re
fused to make any change in the schedule
save in two instances. The salary of the
attorney for the Western District of Penn
sylvania was increased from $3500 to $4000
and that of the attorney for the Eastern
District of Michigan from $3000 to $4000.
An amendment was agreed to requiring
the Attorney-General, in appointing As
sistant District Attorneys to make his
selections irom residents of the districts
in which they were to serve.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.â ln the

customs collection districts of Alaska.
This bill is of importance to shippers, as
by the present regulations a vessel is

TROUBLE IN MISSISSIPPI.
Dissolution of the Ties That Bound

Together.
TALLAHASSEE, Fla., March 4.-The
forces of McKinley won a notable victory
in the State convention which met here
to-day to select delegates to the Republi
can convention to be held at St. LoniÂ°.
The friends of Reed, Morton, Quay and
other candidates, combined against the
Ohio man, made a hot right, but to no
avail. The first tight was for control of the
State Committee, and the McKinley men
won, thouch they claim that the combine
aeents offered as much as $300 for a single
vote.
The real test was on temporary organiza
tion, and then the McKinley men showed
their overwhelming strength. For tem
porary chairman they named Joseph Lee,
secretary of the State Committee, and the
anti-McKinley element named P. W.
Chandler, both colored. Lee was elected,
receiving 130 votes to Chandler's 80. Lee
named a committee of nine on credentials,
seven of whom were McKinley men.
Chairman Egan of the State convention
says that each of the eight National dele
gates will be for McKinley. It is rumored
that the anti-McKinley element has re
solved to bolt and send a contesting dele
gation to St. Louis.
SPLIT IX MISSISSIPPI.
LynchÂ» Followers Bolt From the Repub
lican Convention.
JACKSON, Miss., March 4.â The Repub
lican State Convention to-day brought
about a complete dissolution of the slender
ties that have bound the two factions in
this State together and that element of the
party which has followed the fortunes of
John R. Lynch are stamped as"bolters.
In January last the Republican State
Executive Committee selected a sub
committee of eleven to pass on all con
tests, the same to be ratified by the entire
committee before the convention met.
This sub-committee has been in session
since Monday, and at 10 o'clock to-day re
ported to the full committee. Both these
committees were favorable to Hill, he
having seven on the sub-committee of
eleven and forty-nine on the lull execu
tive committee of ninety, so that he easily
carried every point. The meeting of the
executive committee was a stormy one.
The convention was entitled to 266 dele
pates, and of these Hill had a majority of
his own men.
A resolution was adopted that admit
tance to the convention hall should be
only oil tickets issued by the chairman of
the sub-committee, John McGili, a Hill
supporter, and that the contestants were
to oe excluded. The Lynch faction, after
a caucus, decided to demand admission
without tickets.
At 4 o'clock Lynch, at the head of hi 3
followers, went to the opera-house door
in a body and asked for admission. Tick
ets were offered them, but were declined,
and they crossed the street to another hall,
where they held a Lynch convention.
The Hill crowd held an early meeting in
the opera-house, presided over by John
McGili of Jackson and T. V. McAllister of
Vicksburg. Several speeches were made,
one by ex-Governor Pinchback of Louisi
ana, and the following delegates and al
ternates were selected to attend the Bt.
Louis Convention: At largeâ James Hill,
Jackson; John S. Burton, Holiy Springs;
A. M. Lea, Vicksburg; E. W.'Lampton,
Greenville. Alternates â J. N. Anderson,
Yicksburg; W. B. Sorsby, Jackson; W. A.
Alcorn, Friars' Point; W. E. Mask,
Winona.
While it is uninstructed, the delegation
i 3 eolidly for McKinley. A resolution to
instruct them to vote for hin? first, last
and all the time was rejected.
The Lynch faction convention was called
to order by L. B. Moseby, chairman of the
State Executive Committee. Business was
then proceeded with as if they were the
only convention. They denounced the
Hill, crowd vigorously; declared Lynch
had a large majority of the delegation, but
that they were systematically robbed by
the sub-committee.
The following are the Lynch delegates to
the National Convention: John R. Lynch
of Natchez, W. E. Molleson of Vicksburg,
M. A. Montgomery of Oxford, F. J. Col
lins of Summit. Alternates â L. B. Mose
by of Jackson, E. H. McKissock of Holly
Springs, A. C. Mazer of Dry Grove and J.
B. Yallowby of Madison Station.
Resolutions were adopted swearing alle
giance to the Republican principles, but
the delegation, though reported for Mc-
Kinley, was not instructed for him.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 4.-A

in this city, states that the committee is
contident the free silver Democrats will

These reports show beyond question, the
committee claims, that the great mass of

ment was everywhere growing in strength

HOLMES WILL BE HANGED
Verdict Against Him Confirmed
by the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania.
The Murderer Maintains His Remark*
able Calm When Informed of
the Result.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 4.âHer
man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes, will
probably pay with his life upon the gal
lows for one of the many murders of which
he stands accused. The Supreme Court
of the State to-day afiirmed the verdict of
murder in the first degree found against
Holmes in the Court of Oyer and Terminer
of Pennsylvania for the murder of Benja
min Pietzel in September, 1894, in this
city. The opinion of the court was read
by Justice Williams, and it overrules all
the assignments of errors made by counsel
for Holmes and affirms the judgment of
the lower court. The Supreme Court held
that no substantial error wad pointed out
and that the evidence fully sustains the
verdict rendered against the, prisoner.
But one hope now remains for Holmes.
This is an appeal to the Board of Pardons
of the State. The hope that this body
will intervene and interfere with the ver
oict of two courts is so slender that it may
be dismissed entirely from the realm of
probability, and unless Holmes should
take his own life or should die from
natural causes, it is certain that he will
make his exit from this world upon the
gallows in the corridor of the County Jail.
Counsel for H clones affected to be sur
prised by the verdict of the Supreme
Court to-day, but not so with Holmes.
When Samuel P. Koian, the young lawyer
who conducted Holmes' case, went to him
this evening in his cell and told Holmes
that the Supreme Court had decided
against his appeal for a new trial, this
strange man took the news of his con*
detonation to death as calmly as be bore
himself throughout the trying days of his
tritl, and simply said that he had expected
nothing else.

DENVER. Colo., March 4.â Cardinal

He was met at the station by the proper
committees from the diocese, and followed
by a great throng of people, the party
proceeded to the Logan-avenue chapel, be
fore which the schoolchildren of the city
had been massed. After blessing these,
the Cardinal entered the chapel, where
Bishop Matz gave the formal address of
welcome. After a brief response and the
singing of a gloria, the Papal delegate was
escorted to the residence of Father Bender,
where a luncheon was served.
This evening a public reception was held
at the Brown Palace Hotel. The Cardinal
will remain over to-morrow to listen to
petitions and suggestions. It is under
stood that the local troubles will not be
brought forward, an amicable settlement
between Bishop Matz and his rebellious
priests having been previously made.

of Sunday and Monday. Cardinal Satolli,
now in Denver, will paiticipate in the
fune-al ceremony.
Peter Richard Kenrick was born in
Dublin, Ireland, August 18, 1806. In
March, 1832, he was ordained priest. His
first mission was at the cathedral at Dub
lin and then he was placed in charge of a
church in the neighborhood. At the in
vitation of his brother he came to Phila
delphia in 1834 and was appointed vicar
general of that diocese. Subsequently he
was stationed at Pittsburg and he led for
a time the life of a missionary in Western
Pennsylvania.
in 1840 he loft for Rome with the inten
tion of joining the Jesuit order. While at
the Vatican he met Bishop Rosatti of St.
Louis. Tho latter was impressed with
the young priest's ability and secured
from Pope Plus IX his appointment as co
adjutor of this diocese.
On November 30, 1841, at Philadelphia,
was celebrated the consecration of Peter
Richard Kenriclt as Bishop of Drasa and
coadjutor to the Bishop of St. Louis, with
the right of succession.
On Bishop Rosatti's death in 1843
Bishop Kenrick became actual Bishop of
St. Louis, and in 1847 St. Louis was elected
into an archdiocese and Bishop Ken rick
became its first Archbishop. During the
fifty years of his administration of the
affairs of the diocese be encountered and
overcame many obstacles. In 1835 ha
came prominently before the country in
his right against the "test oath" imposed
by the Drake constitution. This fight was
carried through adverse courts and event
ually won a victory in the United States
Supreme Court. It was in 1865 also that
be denounced Fenian ism and refuted the
sacraments and privileges of the church to
any who belonged to thÂ» organization.
In 1869 he was summoned to Rome to
participate in the Vatican council. Here
he distinguished himself by his daunt
less opposition to the promulgation of the
doctrine of papal infaliability as an article
of faith. He was outvoted, however, and
of course acquiesced in the dogma. The
celebration of his golden jubilee occurred
on November 30, 1891.

Spaniah Student* Repeatedly Charged

BARCELONA, Spain, March 4.â A large
number of students carrying banners as
sembled this morning at the doors of the
university, where they were addressed by
several speakers.
The police attempted to disperse the
gathering, bat were resisted by the stu
dents, who met the officers with volleys
of stones and other missiles. A charge
was ordered and the officers advanced
upon the students, who retired and took
refuge within the university building,
closing the doors in the face of the police.
The latter finally forced an entrance in
the rear of the building, but were met by
the rector of the university who ordered
them to leave the premises at ocne.
The police retired and the students
emerged, when they were again attacked
by the officers and a fierce fight ensued, at
the height of which a party of mounted
gendarmes arrived and were greeted with
cheers by the students.
The commander of the gendarmes
ordered the students to disperse, which
they did upon his promise that they should
be protected against the police. In the
encounter with the officers many persons
were injured.

THREE FLOATING FORTRESSES, ,,
Me to Battle- Ship* That " Will " Soon Be
Launched at Cramp*'. â  64 . %v; f'
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 4.-Tbree
warships (the Massachusetts, the Brook
lyn and the Iowa) still remain at Cramps'
shipyards, and though the officials there
say that they have received no special or
ders from Washington to rush them to
completion there is, nevertheless, an air of
activity about the yard that contrasts
strongly with the recent apparent dullness
there. Should the necessity arise all three
vessels could rapidly be put into a condi
tion that would make them most formid
able engines of destruction.
The greatest interest just now centers
naturally about the battle-ship Massa
chusetts. The ship is, in the parlance of
shipbuilders, 98 per cent completed. This
means that when her gun* are mounted
she will be practically ready for sea. The
great 13- inch rifles have not arrived *s yet,
but probably will in the course of a few
weeks, and they will at once be put aboard.
The cruiser Brooklyn has all of ncr main
machinery in, and the work on her sloping
protective - deck is rapidly progressing.
She is far from completed, but a few
weeks' work under pressure would make a
big difference.
The battle-ship lowa is still on the
stocks, and her launch has been fixed for
March 28. Sue is being plated up, and
some idea of her gigantic proportions can
be seen Dy a glance along her sides. The
lowa is termed a sea-going battle-ship and
will be, when completed, the most power
ful ship of the navy. Under pressure she
might be completed, if badly needed, in
about six months, or perhaps a little less.

Law-Abiding Citizens Oppose the Bill
in Vain â Happenings at
Honolulu.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Feb.; 26.â The
first regular session of tne Legislature of
the Republic of Hawaii was opened by
President Dole on Wednesday, the 19th, ac
noon. United States Minister Willis,
British Commissioner Hawes, the diplo-
matic agents of France, Portugal and
Japan and the entire consular corps were
present. The ceremony took place in the
throneroom of the former lolani Palace,
now used as the executive building. Of
ficers of the United States cruiser Benning
ton were absent, as ibe vessel sailed for
Lahalna, ostensibly for target-practice, two
hours before. The large room was filled
with prominent personages and the affair
waa very successful. Rev. D. P. Birnie of
the Central Union Church offered an ap
propriate prayer, and then President Dole
read his message to the Legislature, briefly
treating of the events of importance since
the creation of the republic
After the reading of the message both
bouses met separately and organized. In
the Senate, Archie Smithies was elected
sergeant-atrarms, and all the other officers
and standing committees held over from
the special session.
In the House J. 6. Tucker was elected
sergeant-at-arrus on the second ballot.
Speaker Naoae announced an entirely new
set of standing committees, which action
is significant.
In the late special session the eight
native members in the House numbered
one more than half the entire membership.
They had a little combination among
themselves which caused the Government
more or less annoyance. The appointment
of new committees, in which all the im
portant cbairmships are given to white
men, shows that the combination has
been broken during the recess, and that
the Government now has full control of
both branches. *
This is the sixth day of tbe session, but
so far only the opium and appropriation
bills are of any importance. Senator Cecil
Brown's opium bill provides for the sale
at auction of one license in each island at
the following unset prices: Oahu $20,000,
Hawaii and Muui $15,000 each and Kauai
$10,000 and an import duty of $1 per
pound. It is being bitterly fought by the
churches and temperance societies. An
effort was made to squelch it at the outset
by refusing to pass the bill to print, but it
was defeated by a vote of 11 to 2.
This does not represent the strength of
the bill by any means. Its author says he
has seven Senators pledeed to support it,
which is a majority now, as there is one
contested seat from Hawaii now before
the Supreme Court. Both Senate and
House should contain fifteen members.
Tbe bill will probably pass the House
without difficulty, but its chances in tbe
Senate are doubtful until some of tbe
silent members express themselves in its
favor.
The Senate has confirmed the following
nominations: Henry E. Cooper as Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, W. F. Frear as First
Associate Justice, W. Austin Whiting as
Second Associate Justice, A. W. Carter as
First Judge of the Circuit Court, Antonio
Perry as Second Judge of the Circuit Court,
Francis M. Hatch as Minister to Washing
ton, R. P. 11 it Let as Consul- General for
British Columbia, F. P. Hastings as Charge
d'Affaires at Washington, D. C, James
Macfarlane as Consul at Auckland, W. 6.
Neill as Consul at Dunedin, Cyril Hop
kins as Vice-Consul at London, England,
J. W. McFarland as Vice-Consul at Van
couver and Hale P. Benton as Vice and
Deputy Consul-General at Rome, Italy.
In the Senate yesterday, while the
items of the appropriation bill were being
discussed, Minister Damon moved an ap
propriation of $2000 per annum for the ex-
Princess Kaiulam, the heiress to the
throne of the ex-Queen. The matter was
referred to a special committee of three,
but is not likely to pass, as the young
lady has never signified her loyalty to the
republic in any manner, and her father is
still a pronounced and anreconcilable
royalist.
The trial of the alleged conspirators
or filibustering agents from California,
Frank Underwood and J. K. Sheridan,
alias W. J. Sheridan, took place before
Judge Perry and a jury in the Circuit
Court yesterday, and ended in a verdict of
acquittal, the jury being out but ten min
utes. Deputy Attorney-Greneral E. P.
Dole prosecuted and S. M. Bal.'ou was as
signed to the defense by the court, the
defendants being without means.
There is much talk over the action of
Captain Pigman of the United States
steamer Bennington, who is accused of de
liberately insulting President Dole's Gov
ernment by taKing his ship away two
hours before the time set for the opening
ceremonies of the Legislature. Some of
the newspapers are trying to make Doliti
cal capital out of the affair, but Captain
Pigman keeps mum over it- The vessel
returned after an absence of two days, and
one of the officers gives the following ex
planation of the affair:
The invitations from the Minister of
Foreign Affairs were not received on board
the Bennington until the morning of the
day set for the opening of the Legislature.
As the fact of the Bennington's departure
had been known all over Honolulu and
noticed in the daily papers, the Hawaiian
Government mast have been fully aware
of it.
When the invitations came on board the
Bennington had already bean brought up
close to her anchors and steam was up in
readiness for leaving. Under the circum
stances Captain Pigman would not delay
the cruise as to do so would have forced
him to postpone his trip until alter the
arrival of the Australia. It was necessary
the Bennington should be in port when
the Australia arrived in case fresh oiders
concerning the vessel should arrive from
Washington. The fault would seem to be
with the Hawaiian Forei n Office for de
laying the invitations to the very last mo
ment.
Miss Kate Field delivered her lecture,
"An Evening With DicKens," before a very
large audience at the Kaumakapili Church
last night, a portion of the proceeds being
donated to the kindergarten schools. Pres
ident Dole, Minister Willis and other nota
bles were present.
Lionel V. Reapath, a collector, em
ployed by the Hawaiian Gazette Company,
is under arrest for embezzling funds to the
amount of $3000. It is said he has a simi
lar record in San Rafael and Los Angele*.
The two women who were arrested on
the previous trip of the Australia for
smuggling sixty-five tins of opium in
undergarments made for the purpose,
have been acquitted in thp Circuit Court.
The evidence against them was entirely
circumstantial. The frequency and celer
ity with which juries here acquiton charges
of opium smuggling show bow the gen
eral public feel on the bill to license the
sale of opium.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
A One-Horse Street Railroad
That Is in Danger of Losing
Its Franchise.
The Supervisors Will Demand the
Construction of a First-Class
Electric Line.
BAN JOSE, Cal., March 4.â The matter
of revoking the franchise granted to R. H.
Quincy to conduct a street railway from
East San Jose along Alum Rock avenue
to Alum Rock Park, occupied the atten
tion of the Board of Supervisors to-day.
There were quite a number of interested
property- owners aloni: the road present,
and J. J. Scribner, president of tae com
pany to whom Quincy recently turned
turned over the road, and John Center of
San Francisco were present in the interest
of the company.
On April 6, 1891. Quincy was granted a
franchise for a railway from East San Jose
to Alum Rock Park, to be operated by a
noiseless motor or electricity. He was
granted several extensions of time, and
about a year auo a rattletrap of
a motor was purchased, and for
a period of several months spas
modic trips were made over the route.
Tuis brou ht forth protests from the prop
erty-owners and in October Quincy was
given sixty days in which to procure a suit
able motor. This he failed to do, and the
matter of revoking the franchise was set
for to-day.
About'three weeks ago Quincy turned
the road over to a company of fean Fran
cisco capitalists heade<l by John Center,
who had advanced $37,000 on it. It was in
their interest that Messrs. Scribner and
Center appeared before the board and
asked that they be given more time to per
fect the operation of the road. They said
that negotiations were pending with the
two electric car companies of this city to
run the road in operation with their sys
tems.
After a Jen thy discussion the hearing
on the revocation of the franchise was
continued until April 6 in order to give the
new company a chance to make some
proposition to operate a first-class electric
road.
The Supervisors express themselves as
in favor of nothing bat an electric railway,
and it is thought the new company wili
not be allowed to operate any other kind
of a road.
A GARBAGE CREXATOXI.
The Vexatious Question of the City Se-
fuse About Settled.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 4.â Mayor Aus
tin and Councilmen Noltine, Hogan and
Jarman have been appointed a committee
to investigate the proposition pf purchas
ing a garbaue cremator} 1 , and the vexa
tious question of what to do with the city
garbage will in all probability be settled.
The erection of a crematory se?ms the
most popular plan, and from information
received from Eastern cities seems to be
the most satisfactory wav of disposing of
tne refuse. There are not sufficient funds
on hand in the treasury to purchase a gar
bage crematory, but it is tnonght that ar
rangements can be made with some firm
that is willing to wait for its money to
erect a furnace.

Popular Protest Against Inclosing the
Postofflee Grounds.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March Postmaster
RyJand has headed the protest of the
Board of Trade against inclosing the post
office grounds with an iron fence, and has
asked the Postoffice Department to reject
the bid? recently received for erecting the
same and to postpone the matter indefi
nately. It was Postmaster Ryland's in
tention to have a four-foot iron fence
erected around the grounds to keep the
public from trespassing on the premises,
but such a roar arose from the people that
he has decided to vacate his original in
tention. â 
THE NORTHERN PACIFIC
Application for the Removal of
Receiver Burleigh is
Denied.
Substance of the Decision of Circuit
Judge Gilbert and District Judge
Hanfcrd.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 4. -Circuit
Judge Gilbert and District Judge Hanford,
in the Federal court this morning, denied j
the application of the Farmers' Loan and |
Trust Company for the removal of Andrew
F. Burleigh as receiver of the Northern
Pacific road in the States of Washington,
Oregon, Idaho and Montana, declined to
confirm Bigelow and McHenry. and also
refused the request of the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company to make a quartet re
ceivership, -consisting of Messrs. Burleigh,
Bigelow, McHenry and Galloway. Their
decision in part reads:
The application now mnde that this court
a ppoint McHenry and Bigeiow to be receivers
should by implication admit that the court
may remove them. The history of this case
proves that "he party making the application,
on advice of its counsel, disputes the power of
this court to remove from office receivers
originally appointed by the Circuit Court for
the eastern district of Wisconsin, nnd we must
understand from the application as made that
it i<> assumed that this court cannot exercise
its discretion, bat is obligated to name Mc-
Henry and Bigeiow as receivers, for the simple
reason that they have been heretofore ap
pointed by that court; and if the application
should be granted we must expect that the
appointees named will consider that they are
not answerable to this court for their conduct
as its officers nor subject to be removed for any
cause by this court.
We believe, therefore, that the present ap
plication cannot be granted without absolute
sacrifice on the part of the court of the powers
and prerogatives which belong to it, and
which are necessary to the protection of the
rights of people entitled to invoke its jurisdic
tion of the rule of comity does not require of
the court, in exercising auxiliary jurisdiction,
any such abdication of its discretionary powers.
McHenry and Bigelow, being non-residents,
and almost constantly absent, creditors must,
to enforce any demand against them, seek an
other forum, for if this court cannot call re
ceivers to account for their conduct it will bo
without power to compel them to appear in
courts within this State to answer to any pro
cess. In view of past experience we are not
willing to appoint as receivers persons who
will not recognize the power of the court to
control them in the administration of their
trust. No necessity is perceived in discharg
ing the present receiver, or for making any
further order in the premise*

BANQUET OF YOUNG
REPUBLICANS
Brilliant Gathering of En

Los Angeles.
TOASTS AND SPEECHES.
Success of the Party at the Com

SEVERAL LETTERS OF REGRET.
Congressman McLachlan Points Out
the Dv ies of the League in
Stirring Words.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4.â A rep
resentative assembly of 200 Republicans
attended the banquet of the Young Men's
! Republican League to-night. It was an
occasion intended to fire the enthusiasm
of party men for the coming campaign,
and it served well the purpose. The
utmost jollity prevailed, and every speech
demonstrated ably and forcibly the confi
dence the young Republicans of Los
Angeles County feel in the results of the
approaching political contest.
Besides the young Republicans present,
the gray-haired veterans and counselors of
the party were largely represented. Let
ters were read from Governor McKinley,
Thomas 8. Reed, Representative James
McLachlan and George C. Perkins, all
breathing a spirit of patriotism. Republi
can principles, and confidence that past
misfortunes are to be redeemed in the suc
cess that seemed assured this fall, per
vaded tne several letters. Following is the
programme:
Toastmasterâ A. W. Kinney.
First toastâ "The Young Men's Republican
League: its worksâ its guests." Response by-
Walter F. Haas of Los Angeles. Refrain, "We'll
Rally Round the Flag, Boys."
Second toastâ ''The American Flag and the
Grand Old Party." Response by L. G. Brown of
Pasadena. Refrain. "Star-spangled Banner."
Third toastâ "Our Departed Leaders." Re
sponse by liyron L. Oliver of Los Angeles. Re
frain, "Auld Lang Syne."
Fourth toast â "The Democratic Surplus."
Response by S. M. Haskell of Pomona. Re
frain, "I Don't Like You Any More."
Fifth toastâ "Our Congressional Delegation
at Washington." Response by W. M. Hiatt of
Whittier. Refrain, "We Won't Go Home Till
Morning."
Sixth toa.Â«tâ "The Press." Response by W. K.
Arthur of Pasadena. Refrain, "He's a Jolly
Good Fellow."
Seventh toa6tâ "The Republican Party and
the Monroe Doctrine." Response by A. J.
Schearer of Comptoc. Refrain, ''America."
Eighth toastâ "The Next President of the
T'nited States." Response by J. C. Rives of
Downey. Refrain, "Yankee Doodle."
Ninth toast â " California, a Republican
State." Response by George Reed Jr. of Los
Angeles.
Walter F. Haas, responding, said: "You
have been called together to-night to an
ticipate by this celebration by one year an
event which will be the commencement of
a new era in the history of the United
.States. This will be the inauguration of a
Republican President. We speak with as
surance, because as Americans we have
i faith in the wisdom and patriotism of the
American people. The Democracy prom
ised the American people an 'object les
son,' and well have Americans profited by
I it. Four years ago we were told that the
two great political parties were the same
except in name, but to-day we strive in
vain to see in what they are similar. Our
country is undergoing a more severe crisis
[ now than in the 'fiO's. Then it was a ques
tion whether a part of the people should
remain slaves, and now it is a question
whether all the people shall become slaves.
"I say slaves, for what slavery can be
worse than National bankruptcy and dis
honor? We, the young Republicans of
the Sixth Congressional District, are pre
paring for battle as did the boys of '61.
And the victory will be ours, as it was also
their good fortune, though ours will be
certain and speedy."
Byron L. Oliver responding said in part:
"Whatever may become of the Republican
party, whoever may guide her destinies
and her chosen leaders we as Republicans
can look back in review over the record of
our party and congratulate ourselves upon
the leaders we have had in the past. They
were men who believed in the principles
they advocated; who labored not for self
advancement, but for the good to their
countrymen, who stood ready to sacrifice
their fame and reputation upon the altar
of principle and what they believed to be
right.
"They stood on the mountain peaks of
wisdom and scanned the future with nn
errlng exactness. They saw the pitfalls
and evaded the snares, and for thirty
years our country and our people enjoyed
under their leadership unparalleled pros
perity and success. They established a
National credit and protected Americans
from foreign competition. They turned
our vast resources into National indus
tries. They peopled our prairies and built
our towns. They fostered American en
terprise and made American labor su
preme."
L. 8. Brown of Pasadena said: "If there
is any sentiment that should arouse one's
enthusiasm and call forth his best effort it
is that toast I am called upon to respond
to to-night, 'The American Flag and the
Grand Old Party.' To-day finds it stronger
and grander than ever before, as at the
call of our distressed country it is once
more marshaling its forces for the coming
conflict, while its pulse beats quick and
strong in unison with the heart throbs
of seventy million people. Its past
history is graven forever upon the very
hearts of the nation. It has a past thai
is its own living monumentâ that fair
monument whose very foundations at the
time of the birth of the Republican party
werp rent and shivered by the violent
assaults made upon it by the doctrine of
State's rights and its graceful column en
circled by the insidious folds of slavery's
degrading chains. To save the Union the
Repuolican party poured out treasure like
the sands of the seashore and billowy
oceans of blood."
Albert Schererof the aniversity class of
'95, said: "During the Republican party's
history there has been no political ques
tion of National importance upon which it
is not on record. It fearlessly faces the
issues presented, and being intensely
American in its aim and policy attempts
a solution most favorable to American in
terests.
"It is, therefore, with no feeling of hesi-
tancy that we upon this occasion briefly
recount the attitude of our party upon "the
Monroe doctrine. This doctrine was enun
ciated in 1823 by Munroe, then President
of the United States. Its two leading
principles were: That the United States
would forever refrain from intermeddling
with European broils, and that we would
view with a jealous eye the extension of
any foreign power in America. By this
doctrine an attempt was made to separate
politically the Western from the Eastern
Hemisphere, thus asserting the supremacy
of the United States in the two Americas."
W. M. Hiattof Whittier said: "We ex
pect the entire delegation â we demand
that the Republican contingent stand sol
idly for a protective tariff. Let no man
think he can dodge behind the Bilver or
any other issue and escape the vengeance
of the people at the coming erection. The
people demand a protective tariff that will
start the tires burning and wheels hum
ming in our factories, give employment to
the mechanic and artisan and furnish a
home market for the producer. When
President Cleveland took possession of the
Republican treasury he was greatly wor
ried by the accumulated surplus. Under
free-trade Democratic financiering we are
selling bonds to pay the running expenses
of the Government. Such a condition in
time of peace is a disgrace to the Nation."
The following letter of regret from Con
gressman McLachlan was read:
HorsE or Representatives, \
Washington, T). C, Feb. 27, 1896.)
George Francis Esq., Secretary of the Young
Men's Republican League, Los Angeles, Cal.â
Dear Sir: Your invitation to be present at the
banquet to tie given by the league on the 4th
pros, is just received.
I regret exceedingly my Inability to be pres
ent on that occasion and join in the general
festivities of the hour and confer with you as
to the best course to be pursued in the near fu.
ture to insure the success of the great party, in
the interest of which the league has been
formed
It would give me especial pleasure to be
present on that occasion, for 1 have not forgot
ten that It was the members of the league that
first urged me to become a candidate for the
position that i now hold, nor am I unmindful
of the league's loyal support in the great con
test in which I was elected a Representative in
the Congress of the United States.
It is upon the young men ot to-day that the
future management of our party must depend.
Intelligent organization always lias been, is
now, and always will be, necessary to the
permanent success of any party. When tho
young men are thoroughly organized, well
grounded in party principles, and approve
only the best methods of practical politics
methods that give to each citizen the freest
field for individual preferenceâ no party will
suffer seriously by the disappearance from the
field of action of the older leaders, who may
have added luster to its name.
I congratulate the Republican party of Los
Angeles County upon the organization of her
young men for the great contest of 1890, a
contest so important to the future welfare of
our country that all factions and individual
ambitions should give way to that harmonious
party unity so essential to rescue this (Jovern
ment from the withering thralldom of Demo
cratic legislation and again place it in the
hands of the party ttiat believes in American
legislation for the prime benefit of the Ameri
can people.
This is the first meeting of our local Repub
licans since the practical workings of recent
Democratic legislation have been experienced
by our people, and it is our privilege and duty,
not only as Republicans, but as loyal American
citizens, to challenge that un-American legis
lation that has stayed the uninterrupted march
of our advancement under Republican ad
ministrations for a period of thirty years,
which culminated in the unprecedented Na
tional prosperity of 189$, when, for the first
time In the history of our party, it was com
pletely deihroned, and every department of
government passed into the hands of the
Democratic party.
As we examine the practical workings of that
party's legislation ui>on our country, and its
effects upon our beloved countrymen, what do
we find? Wo flnd that it lias robbed our own
aboring men of employment and Riven it to
tne cheap artisans of other nations; that it
has opened wide our port< to the products of
the pauper labor, not only of Europe, l>ut of
the still more debased labor of China and
Japan, which now threatens the complete de
struction of all our American manufactories
or the reduction of our intelligent American
laborers to the level of the deg-aded toilers of
the Orient.
We find that it has impoverished the Ameri
can horticulturist and given to the foreign
orchard :st; destroyed the American herds of
cattle only to make a market f"r those reared
by the uncivilized peons of Mexico; strangled
our great American wool-industry and bank
rupted thousands of our Anetle*B wool
growers in its affectionate regari for the lonely
sheep herds on the hills of South America, Aus
tralia and Now Zealand. We dteeoret that It
has wiped from our statute-tiooks our Republi
can reciprocal laws that gave free markets for
millions of our American products, tad sent
our ships home to return no more during its
administration. We discover that it has insti
tuted a system of finance so considerate of the
welfare of foreign nations that in the eighteen
months of its operation the necessary expendi
tures of our Government have exceedei our le
ceipts by more than $75, 000, (MX*, and increased
our National debt more than Â£262,000,000, a
sum equal to one-tenth of the debt created by
the great Civil War, ana this in n time of pro
fcrand peace.
Snch in brief are some of the blessings which
we were not promised, but which have been
bestowed upon us by the present Democratic
administration; but, thank God, we are now
facing the dawn. The first rays of retnrnine
Republican ascendency lit op the Eastern
horizon on the last election day and hurled
from power many of these despoilcrs of our
National prosperity. In the approaching cam
paign, under the inspiring lea. lerÂ«hly> of that
peerless champion of American industries,
American Institutions and American man
hood, that American of all Americans, William
McKinley of Ohio, or under that of an Allison
or a Reed, an aroused American people
will complete the destruction of the party
that has paralyzed every American industry
and turned back the finger on the dial of our
National advancement at least a quarter of a
century.
The underlying principles of the Republican
party promulgated by the martyr Lincoln and
the lamented Blame still stand out like bold
headlands through the Democratic mists that
envelop us. The past history of our party,
like a great lighthouse on the shore, sends out
its effulgent rays across the troubled waters
and Jlghts up the way to "National prosperity.
By united effort in the approaching contest
we will place a Republican leader at the helm,
reverse the Democratic wheels of retrogres
sion, and, .under tho stars and stripes, with
the inspiring motto, "Protection, or America
for Americans," nailed to the topmast, we will
move forward again to that transcendent posi
tion among the great nations of the world to
which the finger of a manifest destiny points
us. Sincerely yours, James McLachlan.
ARIZOMA PROSPECTOR SHOT.
Hit Assailant Supposed to Have Been a
Renegade Indian.
PHCENIX, Ariz., March 4.â John Van
Hagan, a prospector in the employ of John
Montgomery, was shot Monday near Four
Peaks, sixty miles from Phoenix, by an un-
Known person, supposed to be an Indian.
Van Hagan was sampling rock and had
one knee on the ground. The bullet
entered the knee and passed through the
thigh to the hip, wnere it lodged. He was
alone, but took his pocket-knife and tr ied
to cut out the bullet, but failed. Van
Hapan fell over a 20-foot cliff when shot.
His horse was fifty yards away, but he
reached the animal by crawling on the
ground. He then rode two miles and
reached Joe McHenry's camp, who brought
Him on horseback to Phoenix. The dis
tance traveled occupied two days, and
ihey reached here this evening. Van
Hagan was placed in tbe Sisters' Hospital.
He is very weak from loss of blood, and
was almost froze coming down. The
Indian is supposed to bo Apache Kid or
some roving renegade.

it is oelieved that the early fruit, such as
apricots, almonds, Tragedy prunes and
early peache3 have suffered materially. A
representative of the National Fruit Asso
ciation this afternoon stated that reports
from Winters, Newcastle and Penrvn
seemed to indicate that all the early fruit
had suffered, out agents in those vicinities
seated that it was altogether too early to
attempt to estimate how much damage
had accrued.
Reports from the highlands, along the
Upper American districts and the Orange
valo Colony are to the effect that the early
fruit has suffered Dadly ; and on the plain
lands south of this city the damage is
severe, early apricots being destroyed in
some localities.
WOODLAXD ASD VICINITY.
The Cold Warn la Regarded at Zittle
Lets Than a Calamity.
WOODLAND, Cal., March 4.â The cold
wave which struck the valley on Monday
was but little less than a calamity. The
extent of the damages cannot yet be esti
mattd, 'out prevailing opinion is that it
has been serious.
At Winters, the early fruit belt, the
damage is light, and it is possible that
that district will escape without serious
injury. Capay Valley reports serious
damage to fruits of all kinds.
When the killing frost fell last year the
thermometer indicated 26 deg. Tuesday
night it was only 30 deg., so that the dam
age will certainly not be so serious as it
was in 1805. The temperature is up to 45
deg. to-day, and to-night warm rain is
falling.
BAXT A Hits ASS AXXIOVB.
Only fruit That Bloaaoma Early and
Kiprna Late Injured.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., March 4.â The
sharp frost of last night has caused con
siderable apprehension among fruit-grow
ers here. The actual damage cannot be
estimated yet, and many conflicting state
ments from growers and shippers are
heard. It is well settled, however, that
there will be no apricot crop whatever this
year. As very few apricots are grown in
this county of late years, this damage will
be very light.
Contradictory as it may appear, the early
fruit is untouched and only such fruit as
blossoms early and ripens late will be in
jured. Cherries are still in the bud and
are uninjured, while the peaches, which
ripen long after, but are already in full
bloom, are badly hurt, the loss being esti
mated by J. H. Hunt of the Hunt Bros.
Kruit Packing Company a-. 75 per cent of
Xho crop. The damage to prunes and pears
will be light, and will rrobablv result in
more good than harm in thinning out the
crop.
XEWCASTLE SUFFERS HEAVILY.
Orchardlata Fear Their Lottea Have
Item Underestimatrd.
NEWCASTLE, Cal., March 4.â The gen
eral opinion is that the fruit crop is injured
more than was at first supposed, although
it may turn out better after a time. One
of the prominent shippers expressed the
opinion this afternoon that there would
not be seventy - five boxes of Kelsey
Japan plums "shipped from here this
season and he says that in two of the
orchards visited by him this morning
there will be but little loss in the peach
crop, while a third will be almost a total
loss.
Report comes from the river district
that the fruit crop there is uninjured, but
it has since been learned that this is erro
neous. More can be told as to the out
come as soon as the sun comes out, but at
present everything is a olanlc.
Favorable Outlook at Plaeerville,
PLACERVILLE. (Jal., March 4.â Frost
in this section yesterday and to-day was
severe. The temperature this morning at
6 o'clock wax 2 4 degrees, but in the out
lying districts it was variable. Four hun
dred acres six miles south, two-thirds
peaches and one-third prunes and pears,
seems perfectly safe. Early peaches and
almonds in other districts are slightly
damaged.
Fruits are much in advance, owing to
the continued warmth of the past month.
Owing to the location here in the foothills
crops are not advanced to the same degree
as in other parts nf the State. The general
outlook is favorable.
Yuba and Sutter Orehardiatt Differ.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., March 4.â There
is quite a difference of opinion among the
orchard ists of Yuba and Sutter counties as
to the damage done the fruit crop in this
section, and it will be two or three days
before a reliable estimate may be formed.
It is believed, however, that the peach
crop has not suffered to any great extent,
and that cherries, French prunes and
pears are also comparatively uninjured.
The greatest damage has been done to the
almond crop and certain varieties of apri
cots, and while some predict a total loss
others are inclined to believe that the
damage is exaggerated.
Good Prospects at Rapa.
NAPA, Cal., March 4. âThe prospects of
the fruit crop in this valley are good, with
the exception of apricots and almonds
which fruifmen say are badly damaged b}
the frost of last Saturday night. Thi
snow was more of a benefit than other
wise.
None of the fruit was damaged by it
On tbe contrary it is thought that it wSJ
have a beneficial effect in retarding tht
swelling of buds, especially of grapes, and
make them less liable to damage by latei
frosts. Cherries are looking well. They
have not advanced far enough to be mate
rially affected by the frost. Feed in the
hills was a little backward up to this last
Sturm, but it is coming on beautifully.
Ventura Crop t>Â» Good Condition,
VENTURA, Cal., March 4.â The fruit
crop of Ventura County is in good condi
tion, with the possible exception of the
almond crop, which has been slightly
damaged, first from lack of rain and sub
sequently from frost. The apricot, prune,
peach and walnut interests are in first
class condition, and have suffered no dam
age whatever from rain or frost.
The last rain came in the nick of time,
and barring the frost, the usual yield will
result. The danger line from drought has
been passed, and the only fear is that frost
will follow the wet snell, in which event
the crop will fall a third short. Very cold
to-night, with prospects of frost.
Henldabura <?<â¢<Â« Off Zighthj.
HEALDSBURG, Cal., March 4.â The
cold snap of the past three days has done
but little damage in this section. Andrew
Gallaway, one of the leading fruit men in
Sonoma County, said to-day that aside
from the injury to early fruits he thought
little if any damage would follow. Up to
the first of the month indications for a
heavy crop were never better, and the
knowine ones still maintain that the fruit
crop will be heavy.
JVo Material Damagn at Daritrille.
DAVISVILLE, Cal., March 4.âOrchard
ists report that as yet no material damaee,
but it is rather early to tell. The OaK
Shade Fruit Company report some damage
to Tragedy prunes, but peache? ana apri
cots are not injured. Almonds are dam
aged more than anything else. The
orchardists are using every effort to pre
vent damage. Prospects for more heavy
frosts to-nieht.
.iVo Complaint From. Mod'.ito.
MODESTO, Cal., March 4.â There are
the best of prospects at present for a large
fruit yield throughout the county. Peach
and almond trees are in bloom, and had
the present storm terminated in clear
weather and frost, great damage would
have been done, but examination of the
orchards to-day shows no damage by snow
and sleet in this vicinity. If frosts hold
off for a while, the time for much damage
will be past.
Santa Barbara's First Snore.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 4.â
This morning the whole of the mountain
ous islands of the Santa Barbara channel
were crowned with snow. This said to be
the first time in the history of these tropi
cal sea-girt isles that snow has ever fallen.
So far Santa Barbara and this little strip
of coast valley from Ventnra to Naples
seems to be the only section of the State
wholly exempt from this wintry visitant.
San L,ui* Ohinpo is Safe.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., March 4.â No
complaints have been made of injury to
fruit crops in this county. Along the
coast section the crop is all right, but in
the interior, where it is colder, some dam
age has no doubt resulted, but k will be
insignificant. The thermometer in this
city reached 32 degrees, but that condition
prevailed only for a short time. Prospects
for all crops are bright.
San dose Feel* Cheerful.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 4.â So far as
known no damage has been done to the
fruit crop of this section. The early
varieties of fruit, it is thought, had set be*
fore the cold spell. There has yet been no
killing frost, and it is thought "prunes are
safe. The condition at Los Gatos and other
hill sections are the same as in the valley.
Hum bold t County Wrapped in Snow.
BLOCKSBURG, Cal., March 4.â An un
precedented cold storm prevails for the
season of the year. Snow here is sixteen
inches and it is still snowing. In Eureka
Monday morning it snowed three inches,
the deepest ever known there. The ther
mometer was 32 there. The thermometer
here yesterday morning was 20.
Snow Blockade at Off den.
OGDEN, March 4.â The most severe
storm of the winter set in at midnight last
nieht, and to-day the streetcars were
blocked for several hours by the drifting
snow.

Important Supreme Court
Decision Expected in a
Few Days.
CONCERNS FRANCHISES.
Contractors on the Merced River
Bridge Have Commenced
Work.
GRADERS MAKING A MILE A DAT
Thirty-Five Miles of Track Between
Stockton and Fresno Ready
for Use.
FRESNO, Cal., March 4.â City Attorney
Moultrie has just returned from Sacra
mento, where he made au argument be
fore the Supreme Court on behalf of Fresno
in opposition to an amended petition pray
ing for a writ of mandate to compel the
Trustees of this city to grant a franchise
over Q street to the San Joaquin Valley
Railway without resorting to the method
of advertising such franchise and dispos
ing of the same to the highest bidder.
Colonel Preston represented the direc
tors of the road. This proceeding was in
stituted not because there is any opposi
tion to the franchise referred to, but in
order to obtain a decision from the Su
preme Court as to the meaning of the
more or less ambiguous language con
tained in the act of 1893, where railroad
franchises through municipalities are con
sidered.
Colonel Preston's contention is that the
act of 1893 refers to street railways only.
Moreover, there is the question of the con
stitutionality of the act referred to, be
cause it is sought in this act to regulate
legislation by county and municipal gov
ernments. The decision will probably be
handed down in a few days.
W. C. Edes of the engineering depart
ment of this road was here yesterday.
During the day he visited the San Joaquin
River at the point to be crossed by the
road for the purpose of securing minor
details for plans of the bridge soon to be
constructed there. The contractors on the
Merced> River bridge commenced work
yesterday morning.
A large force of graders is now at work
between the Tuolumne and Merced rivers.
It is thought the road will be completed
to Merced about the hrst of May, though
?t may not be opened for business until it
reaches Fresno. Coming this way from
Stockton thirty-five miles of track are now
ready for use. South of Tuolr.mne Grant
Brothers are grading the roadbed rapidly,
making an average progress of one mile
each day.
Last Saturday six carloads of piling for
the Merced River bridge were shipped to
Livingston. Work on this structure will
begin to-morrow, and it will require nine
weeks to complete it. The bridge will be
a haif mile in length.

THE JONES TRIAL
AT CARSON CITY.
Further Examination of
the Books of the
Mint.
MANY MISSING SHEETS.
Great Difficulty Is Expe::'nced
in Tracing the Record of
the Melts.
BOGUS BAR SHOWN THE JURY.
Impossible to Make a Spurious Brick
Witiiout the Knowledge of tbe
Watchmen.
CARSON, Nev., March 4.â The case of
the Government vs. J. T. Jones, the al
leged bullion thief, was resumed at 10
o'clock this morning, with Warren Note
ware on the stand. The examination of
the books was continued and showed that
1908 ounces of bullion more than was
charged to the refinery was returned to the
superintendent in the fiscal year 1593. All
bullion that had been received by the
superintendent was supposed to be gen
uine.
The figures for the amount of bullion
pent to the refinery were then called for
and for half an hour continuous figures
were read to the jury, which in the end
showed that 1407 standard ounces of bul
lion, valued at $25,000, failed to come bacÂ£
lo the melter and refiner from the re
finery.
The witness then explained that the
bullion sent to the refinery did not con
tain the gold that it was purported to con- j
tain -\nd it was covered by the spurious ;
melt. More figures were read from the ;
records of the bullion sent to the refinery !
from December, 1S!Â«4, to July, 1895; s^nt to
the refinery, 1n,4}0 ounces of gold; re
ceived from the refinery, 8925 ounces; dif- j
ferencp, 1508 ounces, or $27,000, which rep- j
resents the loss.
Witness said that was accounted for only i
by the fact that the bullion did not con- j
tain the value that.it was purported to con- j
tain. In the working of silver there was a i
s-rortase from the refinery of 5078 ounces â¢
in the years 1891, 1892, 1593 and 1394. Mr.
Jones was acting as assistant melter and j
refiner from March 1, 1890, to March, 1895. j
The only way that these deficiencies could
be covered would be to deliver ruanufac- j
tured bogus melts.
The bogus meit was here presented by :
the witness and its record given. The bar '
was made in the deposit melting-room, as j
it fitted a mold from that room. The bar i
and mold were here shown to the jury.
Witness, resuming, said the metal in the !
melt as it now stanus is not the same as |
when deposited in the Mint. It was im
possible for any one outside of the Mint to '
fcubstuute a spurious melt for a genuine I
one. The person who substituted it must i
have had access to the melter and refiner's >
department. It could not have been made
without tbe knowledge of the melter or his
assistant.
Records from the* consolidation book
were then read. Witness was unable to!
trace all deposits through this record. No j
disposition in the refinery of melt 77 is j
in the pages of the consolidation book. In
this boot consolidations 8, 9, 10 and li
are missing. It was further shown that a
pace wa3 taken out. The mutilations of
this book destroy all chance to trace the
above-numbered melts. It must have been i
done to prevent the tracing of the melts. !
Were the bookkeeping in tbe refinery and
the tags kept it would be possible to trace
all the melts. C. W. Thompson and Frank
Oliver were employed in the meiting and i
deposit room.
Witness tnen explained how the watch
men of tbe mint made their rounds of the
building once an hour, showing that it
would be impossible to make a spurious
melt without the knowledge of the watch
men. The time-book was then called for
and the time of arrival and departure of
the employes read to the jury. It was shown
that Charles W. Thompson and Frank
(tiiver left the Mint at 6 p. m., July 20,
1893. It was impossible to state what time-
Mr. Jones left the Mint on that day.
The statement records of the month of
J une, 1893, were then read. The record of
the assayer shows that melt 14 was re
melted. Why this was done it was im
possible to say. Charles W. Thompson
was employed as deposit melter in May,
1803. Mr. Harris was foreman of the ingot
melting-room. Frank Oliver was appointed
on June 19, 189.3. He had two days' ex
perience in melting, when he remained in
the melting-room until 6 p. m. Witness
assisted in weighing bullion on September
12, 1804. Mr. Jones left .Saturday, February
9, 1895. Returned on February 22 or 2-i.
The weighing of the bullion was done
during his absence.
A number of small gold bars were sent
for to the Mint to be placed in evidence.
Gold bar 106 was turned over to the rnelter
and refiner, but is not in the Mint and
could not be found in the refiner's vauU.
Mr. Jones left for San Fran
cisco on February 9 and the search
for tbe bar was made on Sunday,
February 10 No one could get into the
vault without the key or the combination.
A box of gold bars were brought into
court. These bars were to show the simi
larity between the missing bars and the
bars offered in evidence. A bar as near
the size of the missing one as could be
found was banded to the jurors. It was
found that it could easily be carried in a
coat pocket. A number of bars were then
exhibited, ranging in fineness from 500 to
9!X). The oath of office was the only check
on the honesty of the melter and refiner
or his assistant, and it would be possible
for the melter and refiner to carry out a
bar or a number of bars of gold in his
pocket. It could only be concealed by
making spurious melts and marking a
higher fineness on them than they really
contained. It would be necessary to as
say the bar to detect the fraud.
A FRESSO SEXHA.TIOS.
Valuable Zand That May ltevert to the
State.
FBESNO, Cai... March 4.â An extraor
dinary request, emanating from the office
of the Surveyor-General of California,
re&ched the County Treasurer here yester
day, it asks for the return of $12,000, said
to ha :e been deposited some years ago by
Miller & Lux as trust funds, in compliance
with law, in order to reclaim six sections
of swamp land in what is now Madera
County. The treasurer asserts that records
have been searched for twenty years back
and there is no evidence that such a de
posit ever made. The matter was
brought to the attention of the Board el
Supervisors here to-day and produced a
sensation. It raises an important ques
tion, for if no such deposit was made the
title to this land is imperfect. The land
is now said to be very valuable, and it may
ultimatey revert to the State.

Arrirr at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal , March 4.-This
morning Governor James Budd and sev
eral members of the State Board of Ex
sminers arrived in Los Angeles from the
north and went to their hotel.
Accompanying Governor Budd are
Joseph Steffens of Stockton; Ed White,
brother of Senator Stephen If. White, of
Agnews; S. E. Black, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction; L. H. Brown, Secre
tary of State, and Secretary Watkyns.
Two members of the board, Attorney-
General Fitzgerald and Dr. Gardiner, are
not with the party, being unable to join
it at this time. The Governor stated that
there is no particular significance in the
visit of the board at this time. It is here
to look into the workings of tbe Highlands
Insane Asylum and .the Whittier State
001.
The affairs of thp latter institution will
en attention, and the Governor vrill
decide as to the appointment of a trustee
to till the vacancy caused by the retire
ment oi Andrew Mullen.
The Governor and party left this after
noon by the San Bernardino train to visit
the Highlands Asylum. It is expected
that they will visit Mount Lowe on Satur
day night upon their reiurn from an in
spection of the WhiUier School.
SUICIDE AT LOS ANGELES.
Beautiful Young Woman Throws
Herself Into the Lake at
Westlake Park.
Identified as Minnie Judy, Who Had
Worked at a Hotel as
Chambermaid.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4.â A
beautiful young lady about the age of 2-1,
richly and elegantly attired, committed
suicide by throwing herself into the lake
at Westlake Park last night. She had on
a black silk dress of the finest texture, and
her lingerie and hosiery were expensive
and in good taste. It was evident that the
unfortunate woman was accustomed to
good apparel, and the tout ensemble of
her habiliments were in the most ap
proved taste. It was evidently a suicide.
There were no marks at all on the body of
the woman showing that she was foully
dealt with and there were no indications
of poisoning.
The mysterious unknown as she lay on
the cold slab at the Morgue presented an
ideal rigure for an artist. It was the body
of the handsomest and most comely
woman that has ever been called to the at
tention of the Coroner.
This afternoon Mrs. Davis, proprietor of
the Pacific restaurant, visited the Morgue
and at once identified the young woman as
Minnie Judy, who had been in the employ
of her mother for the past two years at the
Menlo House as chambermaid. She left
the place, it is stated, with the intention
of leaving with a man with whom she was
in love. The man is not known. He
ursed her to leave with him and it was the
supposition of the Davises that she had
done so.
It is unquestionably a fact that the girl
was betrayed and that suicide was induced
by her disgrace. The Davises spoke very
highly of the girl. She came from the
East recently and constantly kept the
name and location of her parents a secret.
Against Foreclosure.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4.-At the
regular meeting of the board of directors
of the Chamber of Commerce this after
noon, the resolution relative to the fund
ing bill came up for the third time for con
sideration. At the meeting of February 19
some resolutions denouncing the funding
bill as liable to work injury to the commer
cial interests of this Coast were offered oy
Director Patton, he stating that biaiilnr
resolutions had been parsed by commer
cial bodies in other sections of the State.
After some discussion the matter was re
ferred to the committee on law and legis
lation, Director Groff, chairman. At the
meeting of February 26 this committee
reported and offered as a substitute the fol
lowing resolutions, which it asked should
be passed by the board:
Resulted, That the Chamber of Commerce is
earnestly opposed to the passage of the bill
now before Congress to refund the indebted
ness of the Central Pacific Kailroad Company
to the- United States, and advocates the Imme
diate foreclosure of the mortgage held by the
Government to secure such indebtedness.
Resolved further, T:iat the chamber urges the
representative bodies of other communities to
take such steps as to them may seem best to
assist in defeating this funding scheme, bo
prejudicial to the commercial interests of Cali
lorniaand unjust to the people of iho United
States.
This resolution, after a short discussion,
was laid over for one week. At the meet
ing this afternoon the matter came up for
the third time for consideration, and a
long and vigorous discussion took place.
At the end of the discussion an aye and
no vote wi'S taken, and the result was five
ayes for the resolution and nine noes
against it, and the resolution thus failed of
passage.
Notice was immediately given that an
appeal would be taken to the members of
the chamber on the resolutions.
GOLD AT PLACERVILLE.
Important Development Made by
Workmen in the Lady
Emma Mine.
Struck a Large Body of Ore Which Is
Very Rich in Free
Gold.
PLACERVILLE, Cai.., March 4.â ln the
Lady Emma mine workmen this morning
extending south drift on second level
struck a large body of ore very rich in free
gold. The whole mass of quartz will mill
from $20 to $40 per ton. They found a
specimen-rock that will go $5 an ounce.
Work is being vigorously prosecuted on
the north and south drifts of the third
level. When the south drift of the third
level cuts the chute which was struck this
morning in the second level, it will un
doubtedly reveal the riciiest strike made
m this county. The chute is sixty-five
feet in length on the first level and is in
creasing, both in width and length, as
depth is attained.
This property is owned by San Francisco
peoDle. They have operated a two-stamp
mill on it for prospecting purposes for six
months, but are now completing a ten
sfamp mill which will be in operation
within thirty days.
A Call representative to-day visited the
above-named mine and saw the rock and
precious metal in place. The property is
six miles north of Placervilie, in the Kel
sey district.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
A SAN FRANCISCO OFFER.
Another Fine Site for the Wil
merding School in This
City.
PIONEER WOOLEN MILLS.
Seven Fifty-Vara Lots, Extensive
Buildings and Steam Power
Included.
It is understood that the Regsnts o
the University of California at their
meeting on March ?>l will receive an offer
of a site for the Wilmerding school that is
sure to command great favor. The tender
in contemplation consists of the land and
buildings of the Pioneer Woolen Mills of
San Francisco. The property, comprising
BUILDING AND SITE OFFERED FOR THE WILMERDING SCHOOL.
seven fifty-vara lots, is bounded by Van
Ness avenue, Polk and Bay streets. Two
of the lots abut on the seawall front now
being extended. Adjoining the sheltered
cove is the charming military reservation
of BlacK Point. The location is not only
picturesque and accessible, but advantages
of deep water are presented. A substan
tial brick building four stories high, ex
tending for a whole block, two auxiliary
brick buildings and offices are on the prem
ises. The buildings are amply equipped
with engine, boilers and all the appliances
of steam power.
It is contemplated that the necessary
money to acquire the land and buildings
will be raised by the active generosity of a
few leading citizens of San Francisco. A
capable business man of experience
has been charged with the responsibility
of carrying forward the project to a suc
cessful issue. He has made such progress
in his work recently that all doubt as to
ultimate success in the enterprise has
vanished.
Regents of the university to whom tbe
advantages of the site have been presented
acknowledge that the offer is one that
must prove acceptable to the board. Some
regents who expressed themselves in favor
of the Oakalnd si!es at the last meeting of
the board, now frankly avow their prefer
ence for the Van Ness avenue site.
A large portion of the means neces
sary for the. acquisition of the property
has already been secured and the remain
der will be raised in due time. In fact,
canvassing for support of the school is
now in active progress. Among all classes
a sentiment is found to exist which
"earnestly favors the location of the school
in San Francisco. Many believe that Mr.
Wilmerding, who acquired his fortune in
this City, had no other thought in mind
regarding this bequest than that the
school should be established in San Fran
cisco. His mind was so engrossed with
the main principle of the enterprise, and
he had sucii aversion to details during the
last year of his life, that he did not desig
nate where he desired the school to be lo
cated. Many who were close to him and
know of his generous intentions infer that
he expected the institution to be estab
lished in San Francisco.
The expenditure of L;ioney on the Pio
neer Woolen Mills site, independent of
the cost of the site, has amounted to |.tOO,
--000. The land is fairly wortn $200,000
now, and is sure to attain a much greater
value when existing schemes of improve
ment in that quarter of the town are com
pleted. It is now offered for this purpose
at a small percentage of its value.
Cars of the Hyde street line or the
California-street system take passengers
within two blocks of the premises. The
Union-street line is not more than four
blocks distant from tbe site, and the Polk
street extension of the Sutter-street sys
tem will run directly to the property.
Leading men who have the project in
view direct attention of the regents to
the location south of Market streti of the
existing mechanical schools, and indicate
that the vast population noun of Market
street would supply many pupils for a
trades school located on Van Ness avenue
near the bay.
Had Mr. Wilmerding made the endow
ment ior an agricultural college, no oppo
sition to its location in Alarueda County
would be raised, but a mechanical school,
designed to afford boys an opportunity to
learn a trade, ought to be established
where the pupils can avail themselves of
its advantages.
RESIGNATION WITHDRAWN
Chief Crowley Accedes to the
Request of the Com
missioners.
Policeman J. J. McLaughlin Fined
$100 lor Intoxication and
Insubordination.
As stated in yesterday's Call the Police
Commissioners at their meeeting last night
requested Chief Crowley to withdraw his
resignation and it was accordingly with
drawn.
The Commissioners held a long session
to hear tl>e charge of intoxication and in
subordination preferred by Sergeant J. B.
Cook against Policeman John J. McLaugn
lin.
The charge against McLaughlin was that
on the night of February 6, while on duty
on Morton street, he was under the in
fluence of liquor, and on beinc ordered to
deliver up his revolver he used abusive
and offensive language to his superior
oih'cer.
Sergeant Cook testified in effect that on
the night in question, about 9:50 o'clock,
he saw McLaughlin leaning against the
wall of one of the houses on Morton street,
near Grant avenue. He spoke to him and
asked him if he did not understand his
orders to keep people from standing in
front of the houses, and McLaughlin re
plied. "Yes, sergeant."
McLaughlin went toward Kearny street,
and the sereeant saw him. staggering He
watched him, and as he was coming back
from Kearny street he was still staggering
and caught hold of an iron railing. The
sergeant called Policeman Ward's atten
tion to McLaughlin's condition, and then
as McLaughlin leaned up against a house
he called Policeman Floyd's attention to
him.
"Accompanied by Officer Floyd," con
tinued the sergeant, "I went up to Mc-
Laughtin and said, 'Give me your revolver,
you're drunk.' McLaughlin said You are
a liar; I am not drunk.' He
handed me his revolver, and pulling out
club and handcuffs and pulling off his belt
he said, 'Take these, too.' I told him to
go home, bat he refused, and I ordered
1 him to go to the California-street station.
; 11$ refused to go with me and Otiicer Floyd
persuaded him to go with him. On the
way to the station he asked different peo
ple" if he was drunk, and at the station he
made use of abusive language. I ordered
'Officers Floyd and Young to take his star
from him and then told him to go home."
In cross-examination by Attorney
Dunne the sergeant s:iid he first saw Mc-
Laughlin about 8 o'clock and he did not
appear to be drunk. He took hold of Mc-
Laughliir.? arm and told him not to make
a fool of himself. He denied using an of
fensive name to McLauchlin.
Policeman Floyd corroborated the ser
geant as to the* language used by Mc-
Laughlin on Morton street and at the Cal
ifornia-street station. McLaughlin was
very much excited, but he did not think
he was drunk. He did not think the ser
geant could have called McLautrhlin an
j offensivs name without hearing it, and he
j did not hear it. The sergeant treated Mc-
I Langhlin like a gentleman.
Policeman Ward could not say that Mc-
Laughlin wns drunk when the sergeant
called his attention to him. Policeman
I Young and Mullender, who were at the
: California-street station, testified to Mc
-1 Laughlin using abusive language to the
I sergeant and being excited, but they saw
I no sign of liquor upon him.
For the defense several citizens testified
I to having seen McLaughlin on the night
jcf February 6, and that he was sober. Dr.
I Lee of Geary street created a mild sensa-
tion by testifying that he heard the ser
geant use an offensive term to McLaughlin,
and Joseph Long, an expressman; Jamen
Cronin, a barkeet>er: and James Smith, a
cook out of employment, testified to the
same effect.
The sergeant at the conclusion of the
evidence denied That he used the offensive
expression to McLaughlin, and said he
would defy any one in or out of the de
partment to say that they had ever heard
him use it.
The Commissioner?, after being in execu
tive session for about half an hour, fined
McLaughlin $100. A charge of neglect of
duty against Policeman F. W. Dasmann
was dismissed. Policeman Thomas Rior
dan was dropped from the roll, being in
capacitated from duty.
MASSON CASE DECIDED
Heirs Have Come to an Agree
ment and Litigation Is
Ended.
Miss May Masson Paid $4250 for Her
Claims on Her Father's
Estate.
A compromise has been effected in the
contest over the estate of Victor B. Mas
son. Judge Coffey has signed the order
allowing the compromise, and within a
few days the case will be in a condition to
be. taken out of the courts.
The contestant, May Masson, was the
daughter of the U"Â»tator by his first wife.
The principal legatees under the will were
Masson's seconfl wife, Eliza Jane Masson,
and their child, Eleonore Ruth Masson.
To May Masson was left $1000, The
estate was valued at $300,000.
May Mas3on contested the will on the
ground of undue influence. She alleged
that in 1877 her father married a second
time, and in 1878 the child Eleonore Mas
son was born. She said in hercoutest that
from the time of tbe marriage, and par
ticularly after the second child had
reached the age of 10 or 11 years, her
father's mind was poisoned against her;
that hor stepmother and her stepsister had
represented to her father that she cared
nothing for him, and in various other ways
damaged her in the eyes of her parent.
He left her alone, she said, in I^BB and
went to France. Sne had no money and
no means of support and was dependeut
upon friends.
Soon alter the will was tiled Miss Masson
entered her contest, and since then nego
tiations have been going on with the ob
ject of effecting some understandiiig with
out bringing the case into the courts.
These negotiations have been successful,
and the case bids fair to end at once.
The compromise was made with Eleo
nore Ruth Masson. She was made residu
ary legatee, while her mother's portion
was that of the wife, one-half the estate,
which was all community property. By
the terms of the compromise, May Masson
relinquishes to Eleonore Masson half the
$1000 legacy given to her under the will,
and she deeds to Eleonore Masson all her
claims upon the one-half of the estate
which was left to Eeonore Masson and
the other legatees. In consideration of
this May Masson is to be given $4250.
PRIVATE STREET WORK
The Richmond District Property-
Owners and the Sewer
Contractor!.
Richmond district is now wrestling with
the street-contractor question. According
to the residents of the locality that place
is a fruitful field for the man after a private
contract to grade the new thoroughfares
or construct sewers, ajid often the methods
practiced by those firms to get the jobs and
then to make them remunerative are sin
gular.
"The district," said President Hubbsof
the Richmond Property-owners' Protec
tive Association yesterday, "is and. has
been having a great df:al of improvement
work done and tho street contractor is ever
busy there. The old game of getting the
necessary majority of property-owners of
a certain section to sign a contract for
worK, running in dummy signatures, and
then forcing the non-signers by some
means to stand in is of course played
there. But the best scheme is this: Let
me say lirst that, all the private contract
ing firms are in perfect understanding
with each other. It is a sort of syndicate
and there is no relief from it.
"A contractor will get tne building of a
sever on a block from one cross street to
the other. Nothing has been said about
extending the pipe to the center point be
tween the four corners, and you may be
sure the sewer stops short at the crossing.
This leaves an unsewered space at each
end of the line of piping, and when a
block has been finished (?) all four corner
crossings have never been touched.
"The property-owners complain, of
course, but they are told that the connec
tions must not be made between the dif
ferent blocks of sewers because the official
grade has not been established and the
City Street Department would not permit
such. After awhile another contractor
fets the job of sewering the crossings,
he ordinance governing this work per
mits him to charge the property-owners
on each side half way down the block for
work on a pipe that does not extend a
small fraction of that distance. So you
see, they pay twice for the work. It is one
of the impositions practiced by private
street work firms in this contractor-ridden
town, some day we may hope to have
these matters placed upon a just basis,
possibly."
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Captain Jardalla of the British
Ship Cawdor Severely
Censured.
SUDDEN DEATH OFF PORT.
Though Within Three Hours of an
Anchorage the Body Was
Buried at Sea.
Captain Jardalla of the British ship
Cawdor is not in very good odor with sail
ors along the water front. "Jack" spends
the greater part of hi 9 life on the ocean
wave, but when it comes to dying he al
ways wants to be buried ashore. He has
an inborn horror of being buried fifty
fathoms deep, and if the vessel is any
where near port his wish is generally
granted.
The Cawdor was 153 days from Hull, and
last Tuesday morning was off the Faral
lones. At 10 a. m. James McDonald, one
of the sailors, died, and two hours later his
body was consigned to the deeD. At 3p. m.
the ship wa3 at anchor in the bay, and
James McDonald was forgotten. When
the funeral took place a heavy enow squall
was raging, and the sailors say that it
would have been an easy thing to preserve
tne body, but then the expense of burial
ashore had to be looked to.
Xhe following interesting letter in re
gard to the barkentine Discovery was re
ceived yesterday:
United States Revenue Cutter Grant, j
Seattle, Wash. j
To the Editor of the San Francisco CaUSm :
I saw an article iv your paper of Thursday,
February 27, where you state that the idea
prevailsin San Francisco that the barkentine
Discovery is lost. As one of the original crew,
on leaving San Fraucisco, I think I may be
able to inform you of something about said
ship' of which you and the public at large are
in ignorance.
1 shipped aboard her in San Francisco, think
ing her to be a seaworthy vessel, but wnen we
got to sea I found that said ship was In an al
together unseaworthy condition, because she
was leaking badly, and ncr rigging and spars
were altogether rotten. 1 often went up aloft
to furl a sail, never expecting to reach the
deck In safety, expecting that her masts would
go overboard while I was up there.
The Discovery was overloaded when she left
Port Gamble and leakiner so badly that they
could not keep the pumps clear of water in
port. With the working of the ship at sea it
would be impossible to keep the water out of
the hold.
Now, a few words about myself. I had a
little difference with the car-tain of said ship
ana caused him to pay me off at Port Gamble.
Thomas Scull was also discharged at said port
on account of sickness, and I consider myself
very lucky to get out of that ship before she
got, lost. This is my fourth lucky escape from
vessels on this coast just before they were lost.
Yours truly, Henry Peterson,
Revenue steamer Grant.
The steamer Corona that got in from
southern ports yesterday covered Herself
with glory at Port Los Angeles during the
up trip. The British ship Dunboyne went
on the flats and the Southern Pacific Com
pany's tug Collis could not budge her.
The Corona went to her assistance and be
tween them they succeeded. The Pacilic
Coast Steamship Company's vessel then
helped to take the Britisher to Santa
Monica. Yesterday General Manager
Fiilmore wrote a very pleasant note to
Goodall, Perkins & Co. warmly thanking
them for the assistance rendered the Collis
and Dunboyne.

Everything was of silver, even to the

much service. Captains Debney of the

The revenue cutter Rush that was in
collision with the collier Peter Jebsen
will dock at Main-street wharf to-day for
repairs. The chances are, however, that
she will have to go on the drydock, as her
hull has been much strained by the glanc
ing blow she struck the big steamer. The
Jebsen will also have to be docked for a
survey.
The American anip Baring Brothers ar
rived from New York yesterday after a
passage of 145 days. Both she and the
Dirigo have considerable railroad iron
aboard for the Valley road. On February
27 last David Williams, one of the sailors
on the Baring Brothers, died of consump
tion and was buried at sea.
When the birth of Ethel Corona Seidel
on tho steamer Corona was recorded it
was stated that the father tried to keep
his name from getting into print, and first
said it was May and then White. This
was owing to a misunderstanding, and
Mr. Seidel wisnes it thoroughly under
stood that be is proud and happy to let
the world know thai be is the father of a
bouncing baby girl.
The bida foftne erection of the shed
over Pacific-street wharf will be opened by

Six deserters from the cruiser Philadel
phia arrived on the steamer Corona yes
terday. They did not like their ship
mates and took the first opportunity to
run away. A squad of marines is now
looking for them, and if they are cauirht
the chances are that as deserters they will
have to suiter.
ADOPTED T^E REPORTS.
The Board of Health Accepts the State
ment That Spring Valley Water
Ia Fare.
The reports of the experts recently ap
pointed by the Board of Health to exam
ine into the purity of the water of the
Spring Valley Company came up before a
special meeting of the board yesterday ajid
the members, with the exception of tht;
Mayor, voted to accept them. As stated
in The Call some time ago, the experts
reported that the water was entirely tit
for drinking purposes and was as good as
that of the majority of large cities in the
United States.
Mayor Sutro thought it strange that the
quality of the water should vary so much
within a few years, referring to the reports
of experts who examined the water several
years ago. He expressed the opinion that
the water must have greatly improved,
probably through the process of aeration.
However, he stated that as the reports
varied he must vote against their accept
ance.
The expected change in the position of
resident physician of the City and
County Hospital came up and Dr. A. J.
Younger was deposed. His successor was
appointed in Dr. W. F. Dudley. Mayor
Sutro voted no, stating that he had not
been consulted about the matter.
NEW LIGHTHOUSE TENDER
It Will Be a Steamer of the
Latest and Most Improved
Pattern.
It Is Expected That the Launch Will
Be Ready for Service in About
a Month.
Work has lately been commenced on a
new steam launch or tender for the in
spectors of the lighthouse department,
and it is expected that it will be ready for
service in about a month. The new vessel
is intended to supplement the steamer
Madrona, and do such work about the bay
as may be required when the larger vessel
is at sea. There has been a demand for
such a boat for a long time, and when it
is completed it will greatly add to the effi
ciency of the department.
The hull is being Luilt a by A. M. Wilson
on Stanford street, near King, an<* the
work is well under way. Only the best of
selected material is being used, and ah of
the timbers are of oak and extra heavy.
From the appearance of the hull at pres
ent it should make a strong and serviceable
craft. The dimensions are as follows:
Length over all 3B feet, depth of hold amid
ships 5 fe^tl inch, beam 8 feet. The cut
water rises over seven feet above the keel.
â  There is very little sheer to the line of the
J gunwale, but the general apnearanoe of
! the hull is graceful. A cabin will extend
I over two-thirds of the vessel's length. The
i forward part will contain the wheel and
| also seats for several persons, lmmedi
; ately aft the engine and boiler room will
: be located. They will occupy about twelve
; feet of the vessel's length. The after por
tion of the deck will contain a cockpit,
with an arrangement for covering it with
I an awning, and seats around the sides for
; about ten people. All the woodwork about
j the vessel will l>e oak and -walnut highly
' finished and varnished.
The engines for the new tender are be
ing built by William H. Bi^ch on First
street. The boiler ia of the tubular ma
! rine type, it is forty-eight inches In di
: ameter and five feet long. The engine is a
j double compound, with cylinders four and j
eight inches in diameter respectively, and
having a stroke of six inches. They are
expected to develop about 35 horsepower
and should drive the tender along at a
good rate. The engine is constructed on
the expansion and condensing principle
and will not require very much coal. The
propeller wheel is thirty-two inches in d -
ameter and made of bronze. The engines
are to be placed exactly amidships and the
boiler forward of them, with an alley be
tween, so that one man can "fire" and at
tend to stopping and starting. Coal will
be carried in bunker 3on both sides of the
boilers. The space on the sides of the en
gines will be used to carry fre h-water
tanks, connected by a pipe so that both
can be emptied from the same faucet. The
smokestack will be of sheet iron and rise
about ten feet above the furnace. No
name has yet been selected for the new
vessel. â  "
FOR THE VISITORS.
Hotel Men Preparing to Entertain Some
Six Hundred Guests Here in
April.
The hotel men of the City, aided by sev
eral from outside towns, yesterday held a
meeting and completed arrangements for
the reception of the members of the Na
tional Association who are to meet here
from April 22 to 28. It was stated that
there had been collected among the hotel
men $3400 for the reception. It was also
stated that various wine-growers and deal
ers had agreed to contribute liberally from
their stores.
S F. Thorn ot the Grand, J. F. Kirkpat
rick of the Palace, K. B. Soule of the
Lick, the proprietor of the Vendome and
others were present at the meeting. About

will consist of hotel men who are members
of the association and their families. The
hotel men will enter the State by the
Atchison road and will hold their annual
meeting at Los Angeles.
They will remain in the northern part
of the State about five days. The South

terey and Stockton were represented at
the meeting.
Her "Weight 375 Pounds.
Mrs. Annie Derham, a native daughter of
California, who died in this City day be

HIS OPINION OF CHANDLER.
Claims That His Statements Were Not
Only Not Libelous, but En
tirely True.
UMayor Sutro was furious yesterday after
having had time to think over the seizure
by the Postotfice authorities of his com
Huntington Never Stole a Red Hot Stove.
[Reproduced from San Francisco " Call," Saturday morning, February 15th, 1896.]
Collis P. â Somebody stole your Anti-Funding .Resolution, hey? That's funny.
munications to the Congressmen and Sen
ators at Washington, warning them of the
schemes of Huntington to compass the
passage of the funding bill.
His anger was occasioned not so much
by the stoppage of the letters as from the
fact that he bad not been notified by the
Postmaster of the seizure. He considered
that the holding of the letters had caused
the loss of valuable time in the fieht
against the funding bill, and that he
should have been told that the depart
ment considered the envelopes objection
able, so that he might have devisea other
means of placing them in the hands of the
members of Congress.
The inscription on the envelope to which
the postal authorities object is, in the
opinion of the Mayor, nothing but the ex
pression of truth, and therefore not m the
least li be ioiys or scurrilous. He believes
ihe statement that "Huntington would
not steal a red-hot stove," with the
inference that he might be capable of
stealing something far more valuable and
easily handled, to be strictly in accordance
with veracity, in the light of past events
and wonders that the Postorhce should
seize upon such an expression to stop me
missives to the men he wishes to *" eacu .
! "I have not the least desire to break the
Jaws and regulations of the Postoffice De
partment," said the Mayor yesterday,
"and if they insist that I shall send no
more such letters through the mails I
shall bow to their decision.. But that will
not stop the bombardment of members of
Congress whom we believe to be capable of
giving way to railroad influence. ..-;.'â¢'-.
"If we cannot use the mails we .shall re
sort to , the express company. We can
send .thousands of circulars through that
channel and our friends in Washington can
distribute . them just as easily and expe
ditiously as the letter-carriers.
"These objections from certain mem
bers of Congress convince me more than
ever that we have Huntington on a down
grade. He naturally objects to beine
shown .up as a robber and is resorting to
all sorts of tricks to keep us from reaching
the ears of the Congressmen and Senators.
~"I could have made millions by com
bining With Huntington -; in his iniquitous
schemes, but I would not do it, and now
he is resorting to all sorts of trickery and
lies to break down the influence I have
brought to bear against him. That man
is the biggest liar in America to-day, and
the majority of the people in this country
know it.
; "1 cannot understand why I was not
notified that these letters were stopped.
It seems to me that I have as much right
to be informed of such a matter as the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
SUPREME JUSTICE SCORED
Zach Montgomery in a Petition
Assails Stephen J.
Field.
SENATOR WHITE ATTACKED.
The Former Said to Have Been Placed
on the Bench to Protect Unlaw.
ful Land Grabbers.
Zach Montgomery, ex-Assistant United
States Attorney-General, has just pu-b
--i hshed a small pamphlet bearing the ra
i ther sensational title "A petition to the
; President and Congress of the United
States asking for legislation for the honor
i of the Government and the protection of
home-seeking settlers, invoking the res
toration to the public domain of $250,000,
--000 worth of California lands now in the
grasp of the wrongful holders."
The pamphlet is what in newspaper par
; lance is called "hot stuff." It asks for the
immediate repeal of so much of an act of
Congress of March 3, 1891, as limits to five
years from that date the time in which the
! Government may bring suits to annul pat
ents heretofore issued. Says the petition:
The undersigned petitioner, Z. Montgomery,
I a citizen ot the United States and of the State
of California, respectfully represents to the
President and Congress that owing to various
causes hereinafter specified vast bodies of the
most valuable public lands in California, the
rightful property of the United States, have
been, from the earliest settlement of this State
by Americans, and are now wrongfully held in
large tracts by corporations and individuals,
to the utter exclusion of American citizens who
are entitled to and desire them for settlement.
A great number of instances are cited,
more or less familiar, of the Mexican land
grant swindles. For. instance, he says:
According to a carefully prepared report
now in the hands of your petitioner*, notwith
standing the law making void all grants of
more than eleven leagues of land to any one
person, it is a fact that, by means of the com
bined usurpations of said board of Land Com
missioners and the United States Surveyor and
the illegal co-operation of other Government
officials, there stands patented to one claim
ant, namely, one Jose de la Guerra y Noriega,
some fifty-three square leagues of land, aggre
gating 230,525 acres, being forty-two leagues
in excess of what the law allowed.
The case of the rancho "Loraas de San
tiago" presents these remarkable features.
He says:
The petition to the Mexican Governor ask
ing for the grant was dated October 10, 1846,
upward of three months after the country bad
passed under the dominion of the Lnited
States, and the grant is dated in May, 1846,
about five months before it was petitioned for.
Who will deny that this grant was made after
the conquest and dated back?
But, worse etiii. tliia felse grant wm con*
firmed for four leagues, seemingly surveyed for
four leagues and afterward patented for
eleven leagues. But where its boundaries now
are is a matter that principally depends upon
the will of its present proprietor, one Irvine,
who seems to Keep the whole country there
abouts in a whirlpool of litigation.
Having told the story of fraud the peti
tioner becomes personal and proceeds to
score no less a person than Justice Field of
the United States Supreme Court and Sena
tor Stephen M. White in connection with
them. He says :
Mr. Justice Field, sitting as Circuit Judge in
deciding the case of the United States vs. Flint
and others, seemed to consider ; the rights of
the Government in these lands of which it had
been defrauded too "stale" to entitle them to
the consideration of a court of equity. (See 4
Sawyer, 42-87.) ' ". ' . '/ \ â  ;; ;
'- But your petitioner begs leave to suggest
that until the passage of the limitation act of
March 3, 1891, there was no statute of | limita
tions as against the United States. And with
all due deference to the distinguished author
of that decision, it seems but proper, to say
that those Government officials, whether legis
lative, executive or Judicial, whose official
action has most largely contributed to uphold,
as against the Government and people, these
iniquitous Mexican claims, ought not now to
virtually plead their own laches as an excuse
for making this greet wrong perpetual.
Without undertaking to assail or discuss the
motives of Mr. Justice Field's actions, the fact
is undeniable that for more than forty-five
years past the whole weight of his great tal
ents and learning, first as a lawyer and then as
a Judge, has been wielded in the support of
spurious land claims as against the rights of
the Government and the just demands of the
settlers. B*B&^WWBMllg|gMlÂ£3Mtf |lll E
â¢ Your petitioner well remembers as far back
as the early fifties, when General John A. Sut
ter and his grantees . claimed thirty-tnree
leagues of land under two alleged grants, one
genuine for eleven leagues and the other spu
rious for twenty-two leagues. At that time
Hon. Stephen J. Field was the leading counsel
for a large ' and wealthy clientage who sought
to eject from their homes settlers occupying
lands claimed under the grants referred to. ,
- These grants purported â : to :be within a ter
ritory known as the New Helvetia, covering
about forty square leagues. At the time men
tioned there had been no patent and no survey,
either of the genuine grant or the spurious
one. So that even if both grants had been
valid no one could have told whether a given
quarter-section was a part of the thirty-three
leagues claimed under Sutter, or whether it
was a part of the other eleven leagues conceded
to belong to the United States. .
">Under these conditions even Mr. Field, with
all his forensic powers," aided by a willing
court, was not able to persuade an honest jury
of ; his country to guess these settlers obt of
house and home and turn over both land and
improvements to those voracious speculators.
But the great land-grant I claimants .of Cali
fornia knew full well . tnatMr. ; Field, as a Su
preme Court Judge, could serve them far more
efficiently than as a lawyer. There lore in the
year 1857 he was I elected to that exalted posi
tion and his old clients soon found that neither
their labor nor their money used in placing
him on the bench had been spent in vain.
Shortly after Justice Field's election to the Cali
fornia Supreme Judgship he rendered his cele
brated decision in the case of Ferris vs. Coover,
in which he broadly laid down the law to be
that whenever there was a Spanish or Mexi
can grant oi a given quantity of land within
definite boundaries embracing a larger tract
than was granted until the grant was located
"the right of the prantee remained good to the
possession of the entire tract within . the desig
nated boundaries." - r \
He turns to Senator White in this
fashion:
But, as time rolls on, and as their 111-gotten
lands grow more valuable, and at. the rotten
ness of the foundations on which rest their
pretended titles become more and more ap
parent to the whole world, the unlawful
holders of the?e immense properties cannot
trust to mere lobbyists and spies to do their
work. Hence they stand represented to-day
upon the floor of the United States Senate
chamber by one of the most able and dis
tinguished lawyers of this State. While, as a
member of this august body, he is charged
with the grave and resnonsible duty of pro
tecting the public domain of the United States
against all sorts of wrongful claimants, he is
at the same time the hired and leading coun
sel in the courts for a wealthy California cor
poration, aiding it in its efforts to maintain its
grasp upon 00,000 acres of the San Fernando
Mission lands, which, upon investigationâ as
your petitioner verily believesâ will be found
to be the property of the United States.
A circumstance that greatly aggravates
the enormity of this claim is the fact that the
land now claimed by it is almost equal to the
amount of land originally confirmed to the
claimant, but is only about half the land em
braced in the so-calleil patent survey, which
survey, it will be remembered, was made by
Hancock, the claimant's own counsel. |
How it in possible â or whether or not it Is
possible â even for so able a man as California's
senior Senator to properly represent the an
tagonistic interests of so great a Government
and so large a corporation at one and the same
time, remains to be seen. But if the United
States District Attorney, Ord, and the United
States Law Agent, ILartman, and the United
States Surveyor, Hancock, could do so on a
small scale, it may be possible for United States
Senator Stephen M. White to do so on a still
larger one. .^_____^_^_____ â
THE TAILORS ORGANIZING
Successful Meeting at Which
Several Foremen Enter
the Union.
All Assistants, Male and Female, Will
Be Asked to Join for Mutual
Benefit.
The San Francisco Tailors' Union held a
very successful meeting Tuesday night in
Academy Hall, on Mission street, near
Fifth, and made another bold and united
effort to form a powerful trade organiza
tion, which shall include every member of
their craft in town.
There was no secrecy about the meeting,
as the tailors were quite willing to have it
known what they were doing. Samuel
Schwartz was chairman and Herman
Stark secretary. Quite a large number of
prominent tailors were admitted to mem
bership, and there was special reason for
enthusiasm over the event, since nearly
all of them are foremen of large shops.
The reception, therefore, was a pleasant
event in the history of this youngest of
trade unions in San Francisco. The ad
ditions Tuesday night increased the mem
bership to 225.
The question of farther organization
was discussed by the members at great
lencth, and it was finally determined to
begin at once to actively organize the help
in all shops, female as well as male, to
strengthen the union.
The chairman announced that a charter
would be received at the next meeting
from the United Garment-workers of
America, the headquarters of which are in
New York City, and that the local union
will become a part of the great united body
of tailors of America. The significance of
this coalition was unofficially stated to be
that the working tailors have come to a
realization of the fact that they have been
so ground down by competition that barely
a living can be got out of the trade now
adays, even though the tailor* work day
and"niÂ«ht; and they are consequently or
ganizing for self-protection.
Each individual member of the union
was appointed acomrnittee of one to secure
new members, and was requested by .the
chair to introduce each an applicant for
membership at the next meeting, Tuesday
night.
A motion that the tailors hold a mass
meeting within a month was carefully con
sidered and unanimously carried.
T. F. Burns of the Cigar-makers' Union,
by request, addressed the meeting. He
said that the activity and success achieved
by the tailors in organizing had far sur
passed the expectations of the prominent
labor union men who had watched them
closely. With proper organization, he re
marked, the tailors could get such con
cessions from employers as the strength of
their organization would justify. The
trades unions of the United States were
about to enjoy a new era of prosperity â
greater in fact than ever beforeâ and this
enthusiasm of the tailors was only a case
in point illustrative of the spirit animating
labor.
The Cigar-Makers.
The Cigar-makers' Union met Tuesday
night and adopted the platform and
declaration of principles of the labor con
vention held two weeks ago.

QUOTATIONS FROM
CARDINAL MANNING.
Father Yorke Continues
to Deal With
Them.
MB. BOSS' MANIPULATION
His Extracts Unfit to Prove the
Civil Domination of the
Church.
BIGHTS OP MAN CONSIDERED.
The A. P. A. Leader Is Accused of
Repeatedly Mutilating Man
ning's Words.
[Copyright by Peter C. Ycrke, 1836.]
Father Yorke continues his reply to Rev.
Donald Ross as follows:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: Yester
day I was dealing with I). Ross' manipulation
of Manning. I will continue the subject iv
this letter. I find that D. Ross quotes and re
quotes the same sentences in each lecture; in
truth, the quotations lie produces are just as
fit to prove the heliocentric theory as the civil
domination of the church. It wilt therefore
conduce to clearness if I examine all Man
ning's sayings together. As a matter of fact,
the most of them are taken from the one essay
and explain one another.
THE RIGHTS OF MAN.
In the beginning let me deal with a quota
tion concerning the rights of a starving man.
I deal with it first because it has nothiue
whatsoever to do with the questions at issue
and I wish to put it out of the way at once.
In his lecture on the second proposition,
"The Pope and the priestÃ ought to have do
minion over temporal affairs," I). Ron brought
forward as proof the assertion that the churcii
claims to regulate stealing. Donvniou means
sovereign and supreme authority, and how
such authority is proved by assertions about
stealing passes my humble comprehension.
When a Sunday-school teacher inculcates the
lesson, thou shalt not steal, are we to suppose
that she claims to be Empress of the America!).
But to D. Ross' argument. Let me copy it
out in all its vulgarity and incoherency:
"Do you think, ladies and gentlemen, that
stealing is a temporal affair? Well, here are
the Catholic church's teachings as protrayed
by Cardinal Manning:
"'A strong man commits no theft if he saves
his life by eating of his neighbor's bread so
much as is necessary for the support of his ex
istence. The civil law yields before the liigiier
jurisdiction of the divine as the positive divine
law yields before the natural law of God.'
"What a picnic for tramps. [Applause.]
What a picnic for those young fcl lows, who,
for instance, have to be educated by the
charity of the diocese and made priests of.
They could simply go out until they got old
enough to earn their living. Remember now,
that I am dealing with this simply as a ques
tion in the case of a law of the country, the
aw of the land. That law tells what is ar.d
what is not stealing. Ido not know thai if we
were on a jury we would send a starving man
to jail If he stole a loaf of bread. But
that is not the question. It is simply this
in this case â this is the question: Does the
Catholic church seek to put its hand down
upon and control temporal affairs? And when
the Catholic church begins to reguime about
stealing, when the Catholic church begins to
regulate what a man may take of another
man's and what he may not take, I declare
that then and there the Catholic church has
put its hand down and is exercising its do
minion in the temporal affairs of this coun
try." [Applause.]
In this quotation from Manning let me say
that the scrupulously honest D. Ross has
changed a "starving man" into a "strong
man." Why, Ido not know; however, wheth
er the change has any significance or not does
not matter. Here Manning is not speaking of
the church or of church law. He is speaking
of that law of self-preservation which existed
before the church, and which would exist if
the church should cease to be. He simply
enunciates a truth which is law for the pagan,
the Mohammedan, the Jew arid the Christian,
namely, that when a man is in extreme dan
ger he has a right to preserve his life by tak
ing of his neighbor's substance. If a man is
dying of starvation he is perfectly justified in
taking as much bread as will sustain his life,
and there is not a jury in Christendom which
would hold him guilty.
Only the insanity of bigotry would hold that
In making this statement, which is not a law
of the church but a law of nature, 1 nm mak
ing claim to dominion over tempornl affairs.
INDEPENDENCE OF THE CHURCH.
In his first lecture on the proposition, "Tn
case of conflict between ecclesiastical and civil
powers the ecclesiastical ought to prevail," I" 1 .
Ross gave the following quotation and argu
ment:
The Catholic church Is the highest and (in .1
judee of what is the faith and whai is the law of
Uod, and when science and politics come imo con
tact with the faith and that law it admits of no
appeal from its own decision to any tribunal out of
Itself, to any. judge of appeal in the past or la the
future.
"When politics and the church come into
conflict it is the duty of the church to reuiai.i
firm and to heed not the State laws that come
in conflict with it."
Dr. Ross is very fond of ihis quotation. He
quotes it three times, aud with his admirable
ami absolute honesty takes care to mutilate it.
Thus, in the comment on it given above lie
renders "come into contact witn ihe iaith" by
"come into conflict," and in his last lecture bo
Wendteizes the quotation to suit his purpose
and to catch applause: "When science and
politics come into conflict, with that fauh."
However, this is only a small matter. Even
three months were not sufficient to imniliaiize
him with his tools. I find him in one place
ascribing a quotation to Browiuoa aii.l at an
other place giving the same quotation us ti.e
words of "Priest Joutn." But. then, Koa had
infinite confidence in his judge.
manning's meaning.
Ross made use of this quotation to impress
upon the minds of his hearers the idea inai ihe
Catholic Church was Interfering in politics,
and that when she said such a course whs the
right course, the politicians had nothing to do
but obey.
Yet, as a matter of fact, Manning expressly
guards against that idea in the very quotation
' manipulated by Ross. If Ross ha.l even the
faintest elements of decency in his composition,
he would retire deep into his nutive ttuitiaiaii
woods and meditate on the commandment,
Thou shalt not beer false witness against thy
neighbor.
The quotation is taken from an address <le
livered by Manning at Manchester in 1876.
He is dealing with the relations between re
ligion and science, and incidentally he
touches on the relations between religion and
politics. "We are told also," he says. "that re
ligion has nothing to do with politics." Then
he goes on with the same argument given by
Brownson on the extract 1 noticed yesterday,
and with the same reasoning employed every
day by the Christian Endeavorers: "I would
ask, What are politics but the collective morals
of men living together in society ? Tlie moral
laws which govern man as an individual gov
ern him if he be the member of a community,
be it the community ot a household or the
community of a state."
Manning simply means that men in public
life are bouad by the In ws of right und wronrr
just as much as in private life. Moreover, he
takes care to explain that he is not speaking of
politics in the sense in which the word is used
commonly, but in a higher and more exalted
sense. He says: "I am not speakinirof pul
itics in that minute sense, but oi the great con
structive laws by which human society is held
together."
Now dealing with the moral law, and with
ihe great principles which underlie society.
Manning says that "the Catholic Church has
an all important office in these matters."
What is that office? 'The church having a
divine liberty bÂ» the witness which God nas
constituted in the world to deliver his revela
tion, and being the sole fountain of that
knowledge, has within its sphere a sovereignty
and that sovereignty is one which is exempt
from all control of human authority."
This means that the ciiurch i:Â» the teacher of
truth, a spiritual power and that as a spiritual
power she is absolutely in. it-pendent of the
state. This is good ond true American doc
trine, and Mantling maUes his expression of it
doubly accurate by toe words "within its
sphere." The sphere of the church is the
spiritual, the sphere Â«Â» ihe state is the tem
poral. The state X supreme m the temporal
sphere; the churoh is supreme in thespiritual
sphere. The church "has within its sphere a
â¢Qvereignty, and thai sovereignty is one which
is exempt from all control of human author
ity. No authority on earth can intervene to
dictate to the church what it has to teach, or
within what limits it shall teach. There is no
authority to determine whether the church
shall teach or not this or that doctrine."
There is not a sect in the United States which
does not claim this right. Our constitution
refuses to claim any authority over the teach
inir of religion. There is no power in the
United States which pretends to limit the
teachings of any chnrch as long as these
teachings do not offend public morality. Yet
because Manning claims this right for the
church, D. Ross declares that the Pope and the
priests claim temporal dominion. Moreover,
this absolutely honest gentleman, who has not
stopped in the midst of a sentence or done
aught to misrepresent his authorities, takes
good care to leave out words which might show
even t) his audience and to his judge that he
was acting in baa faith.
He knew that Manning was speaking about
doctrinal teachings, not about laws or politics,
and therefore he calmly suppressed Manning's
words, "There is no authority to aetermine
whether the church shall teach or not this
doctrine." But he adds, "It is therefore not
only exempt but supreme, and being supreme,
there can be no appeal from it." He wishes to
insinuate that the church is here given a civil
exemption and a civil supremacy, while Man
ning merely claims, what every American
claims that in matters of religion, the church
is supreme and exempt from all civil authority.
Then comes the quotation with which I
began : "It is the highest and final judge of what
is the faith and what is the law of God, and
when science and politics come into contact
with that faith and tnat law it admits of no
appeal," etc. "Politics" here we must re
member are the great constructive laws by
which human society is held together, namely,
the great moral laws of justice, right and char
ity. Of these laws the church is the teacher.
Every Protestant admits the same, except that
for church he substitutes the Bible.
From the church or the Bible in these mat
ters there is no appeal either in the past or in
the future. Where is the American who will
find fault with this assertion? To produce it
as Ross does as a proof that the ecclesiastical
powers ought to prevail or that the priests
ought to run politics is the very delirium of
dunderheadedness.
THE LIBERTY OF THE CHCKCH.
The American doctrine of the relations be
tween church and state is that each has its
own sphere and each is independent. Now
Ross' propositions said in substance that
Catholics claimed for the church the right to
invade the sphere of the state and to exercise
its authority without any limits. To uphold
this travesty of our doctrines he quoted Cardi
nal Manning:
"I will draw out the proof that Ultra
montanism and Catholicism are Identical."
Ju&t previously to that he said this: "This is
ultramontauism, the essence of which is that
the church being divine and by divine as
sistance infallible, is within its own sphere in
dependent of all civil power, and as the
guardian and interpreter of the divine law it
is the proper judge of man and nations, and of
all things touching that law or iaith or
morals."
Again, Manning is careful to be accurate.
He inserts the words "in their proper sphere,"
thereby limiting the authority of the church to
things spiritual. Yet Boss would persuade
the judicialÃarkis, Major Sherman (so styled),
thai Manning claimed that there were no lim
its to the authority of the church. It was an
other case of "Barkis is willing."
If Ross had only wished to show what Man
ning really taught he might have turned to
the next page and read: "Civil allegiance to
sovereigns is, therefore, a part of Christianity,
and treason is both a crime against a lawful
authority and a sin against God, who has or
dained that authority. Ultramontanism
teaches that within the sphere of its compe
tence the civil power is to be obeyed, not only
for wrath, but for conscience sake.' 'Rome
is sovereign because it is independent;
it is independent because it has no master on
earth. The vicar of Jesus Christ is the source
of its liberty, the guardian of its sovereignty.
Call it temporal power if you will, the thing is
the sameâ the freedom, the independence, the
sovereignty of the kingdom of God on earth in
all the world and over all mankind, resting
upon its center in the patrimony of the
church, within which the shadow of no other
sovereignty can intrude without a violation of
the supernatural order of grace."
I give Ross' argument in its maudlin incon
sequence:
"Now, if the shadow of an officer of the law
must not fall upon the church I think the
church is pretty independent. If the shadow
ot no sovereignty can intrude without violat
ing a moral law within the sphere where the
church is, and no shadow of authority can en
ter without doing wrong, I must declare that
the church has a right to exercise its authority
within that limit." (Applause.)
Now Manning does not say that the shadow
of an officer of the law cannot fall on the
church. He claims for the church spiritual
supremacy. To guarantee this spiritual su
premacy the Catholic world had created an ec
clesiastical District of Columbia in Rome. The
temporal sovereignty of that district the Cath
olic states had given to the Pope, and Manning
is merely proving that the independence of
Rome arose from the recognition of the spirit
ual power of the Pope.
Yet D. Ross draws the sapient conclusion
that because the Pope was King of the city of
Rome therefore there is no end to the church's
authority. No wonder he chose a candidate
for Stockton as judge.

ought to exercise her power without any,

MR. FRANCISCO GARCIA.
VENTURA, Cal., March 1.
I send you the portrait of Mr. Francisco
Garcia. It was taken daring the past
week. By it you will observe the pink of
good health in the coloring of the cheeks,
the brightness of the eyes and robust-
ness of the individual. True, you can-
not see, as I have seen, one of the best
specimens of manhood. Mr. Garcia is
one of the finest looking men within a
day's walk of Ventura. He is able to
hold his own with all the young men of
this place. When I was introduced to
him I remarked his strength and be
told me that it was only a while ago
when he was out of sorts, all run down,
no appetite and troubled with sleepless-
ness. He was advised to and did use
Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. He told
me exactly wliat hundreds have before
said. He soon began to sleep at night,
his bowels became regular, his appetite
returned, and he was enabled to do a
good day's work, eat a fair share of food
and sleep Id's allotted hours. Now he
weighs 180 pounds, and in all his move-
ments shows the perfectly healthy man.
lie. If the church claims to define the limits
of its jurisdiction it is plain that she recognizes
that her authority is limited.
Manning's arguments are so simple that I
will merely quote what he has to say in full.
After speaking of the obedience due the civil
authorities he says:
"No Christian of sound mind will deny that
these two distinct and separate powers have
distinct and separate spheres and that within
these spheres respectively they hold their
power from God. Where the limits of these
spheres are to be traced it is easy enough to
decide in all matters purely civil or in all
matters purely spiritual.
' 'The conflict arises over the mixed questions.
And yet here there ought to be no real
difficulty. Nobody can decide what questions
' are pure' or what questions are mixed except a
Judge who can define the limits of these two
elements respectively, and therefore of the re
spective jurisdictions. In any question as to
the competence of the two powers, either there
must be some judge to decide what does and
what does not fall within their respective
spheres, or they are delivered over to perpetual
doubt and to perpetual conflict.
"But who can define what is or is not within
the jurisdiction of the church in faith and
morals, except a judge who knows what the
sphere of faith and morals contains and how
far it extends? And surely it is not enough
that such a judge should guess or opine, or
pronounce upon doubtful evidence, or with an
uncertain knowledge. Such a sentence would
be not an end of contention, but a beginning
and a renewal of strife.
"It is clear that the civil power cannot define
how far the circumference of faith and morals
extends. If it could it would be invested with
one of the supernatural endowments of the
Church. To do this it must know the whole
deposit of explicit and implicit faith, or, in
other words, it must be the guardian of the
Christian revelation. Now no Christian nor
any man of sound mind claims this for the civil
power and if not, then, either there is no judge
to end strife, or that judge must be the church,
to which alone the revelation of Christianity
in faith and morals was divinely intrusted.
"And if this be so still, luiless the church be
divinely certain of the limits of its commission
and of its message, no doubt or controversy be
tween the two powers can ever be brought
to an end. But if the church be certain with
a divine certainty as to the limits of its juris
diction its voice in such matters is final. But
an authority that can alone define the limits of
its own office is absolute because it depends on
none, and infallible because it knows with a
divine certainty the faith which it has re
ceived in cnarge..
"If then the civil power be not competent to
decide the limits of the spiritual power, and if
the spiritual power can define with a divine
certainty its own limits it is evidently supreme.
"Or in other words, the spiritual power kuows
with divine certainty the limits of its own
Jurisdiction, and it knows, therefore, the
limits and the competence of the civil power.
"It is thereby in matters of religion and con
science supreme. Ido not see how this can be
denied without denying Christianity. And if
this be so this is the same doctrine of the bull
unam sanctam, and of the syllabus and of the
Vatican Council. It is, in fact, ultramontan
ism, for this term means neither less nor more.
The church, therefore, is separate and su-
p re rue.
"Let us, then, ascertain somewhat further
what is the meaning of supreme. Any power
which is independent and can alone fix the
limits of its own jurisdiction, and can thereby
fix the limits of all other jurisdictions, is ipso
facto supreme. But the Church of Jesus Christ,
within the sphere of revelation, oi faith and
morals, is all this or is nothing or worse than
nothing, an impostor and an usurpationâ that
is, it is Christ or anti-Christ. If it be anti-Christ
every Csesai from Nero to the present day is
justified. If it be Christ it is the supreme
power among men; that is to say:
"(1) It holds its commission and authority
from God alone.
"(2) It holds in custody the faith and the law
of Jesns Christ.
"(3) It is the sole interpreter ot that faith and
the sole expositor of that law. It has wilhiu
the sphere of that commission a power to legis
late with authority ; to bind the conscience of
all men born again in the baptism
of Jesus Christ. It alone can fix the
limits of the faith and law intrusted
to it, and therefore the sphere of its
own jurisdiction; it alone can decide in ques
tions where its power is in contact with the
civil power â that is in mixed questions, for it
alone can determine how far its own divine
office or its own divine trust enters into and is
implicated in such questions, and it is pre
cisely that element in any mixed question of
disputed jurisdiction which belongs to a
higher order and to a higher tribunal."
Manning's reasoning is unanswerable and
was recognized by those who framed our laws
and constitution. These laws and constitu
tions s*eer clear of all mixed matters, and
where they are compelled to touch them, they
do so by granting privileges instead of making
commands. Thus in the case of marriage the
state is compelled to deal with it, but it does
so in such a manner as to leave the rights of
the churches untouched.
One may believe in divorce with the Uni
tarians or reject divorce with the high church
men and the state does not compel us to take
sides. It provides divorce for those who do
believe in it, but it refrains from forcing
divorce on those whose consciences cannot
accept it.
Here was the wisdom of the fathers shown.
Hence it is that in this country we have nr
conflicts between church and state. Wher
the church's spiritual rights are viola-ted sh ;
is quick enough to protest. The fact that sh ;
loyally accepts the American constitution i-t
to any honest man a proof that her rights ar<
safe-guarded, but then no one imagines that
D. Ross is honest. Yours truly,
P. C. YORKE.
Charged 'With Grand Larceny.
Frank Coleman, a cook, was arrested by De
tectives Anthony and Crockett last night on
tde charge of grand larceny. Four weeks ago
W. J. Carroll, a bartender, was robbed of his'
gold watch and chain in a saloon at 105 Grant â¢
avenue while asleep in a chair. The articles '
were found in & saloon at 647 Sacramento!
street, where Coleman had sold them for $12,
Coleman has been twice convicted of petty ,
larceny.
Artificial ivory is made from condensed

Speaking of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
he said : "I did not use the remedy un-
til I had been advised to do so, and then
I did not put much faith in it, but now I
can safely say that Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla is a great remedy, and that it
clarifies the blood, leaving no bad effects
on the entire body. I never had a single
pimple or blemish on my face; I never
had the least disagreeable feeling while
I used Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Of
course, I was not a sick man, yet I felt
out of sorts and was beginning to lose
flesh. Yes, Ido recommend Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla."
I may as well tell you that Ventura is
all praise for Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla, and that the druggists are not
palming off something just as good for
the native remedy. When people ask
for Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla they
get Joy's, and that is just what the
druggists of San Francisco onght to do.
They ought to hand out the native
remedy when people ask for it. Cer-
tainly what every one says is good must
be good. HENRY TILLMAN.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
What has become of the Railroad Com
missioners' case?
About all of Abyssinia the Italians have
gained so far is the abyss.
Dividing Africa without counting the
Africans is where Europe rolled off a log.
Affairs in Cuba are critical, but Uncle
Baa should do something more than criti
cize.
Italy has found that carrying the war
into Africa if not the kind of Roman holi
day it used to be.
For the Home Mission in New York
there is -york in New York if (hover had
only thought of it.
Up to date we have said just enough
about Cuban independence to aggravate
bpain without helping Cuba.
To the small boys the snowstorm was as
pood as a carnival, and to many a dignified
citizen they made a circus of it.
Now that it is all over, we can see that
the snowstorm saved the iruit a good deal
and did not spoil the climate mucii.
The nations that have undertaken to
open up Africa havv? opened up more trou
ble for themselves than anything else.
Since the inland is to be dignified by a
naval training school, we had better drop
the goat name and call it Yerba Btiena.
The Abyssinian may not be up to all
sorts of modern war, but he is no soft snap
when it comes to downright hard fighting.
In the drawing-rooms of European dip
lomats it is now considered a breach of
etiquette for any one to sit on the otto
man.
According to the postal authorities it is
wrong to say Huntington will not steal a
red-hot stove and perhaps tne authorities
are right.
Judging from his Home Mission speech
Cleveland is of the opinion that the West
is woolly not only on the back but all the
way through.
This Congress lias not done much in the
way of politics, but it has broken the
record in passing appropriation bills and
that's busines?.
The Carson mint ease ha? been opened
in court, and we may look for strange
things to come out of it if somebody
doesn't put the lid on.
The Southern Pacific of Kentucky suf
fered a signal defeat last night, and the
victory of Mr. Spreckels was a victory for
decency and purity in politics.
If it were not for Armenia, Abyssinia,
Transvaal, Formosa, Korea, Venezuela,
and a few other disturbing places, the age
of peace would have a little peace in its
old age.
As Spain has ordered re-enforcements to
be sent to Cuba from the Balearic, Canary
and Philippine islands, it is evident she is
playing her last cards and the game is
drawing to an end.
Republicans ! The Southern Pacific Com
pany of Kentucky by trickery and chi
canery and by fraud is seeking to get con
trol of our party. Resist the attempt â
stand by the people.
Many places in the State had a combina
tion of rain, hail and snow during the
storm, but Santa Barbara i 9 the only one
that in addition had a thunder and light
ning display as an annex.
A writer for.the New York Tribune has
made the direful discovery of the existence
of a "Presidential trust," and if his story
is true the thing is worse than a goldbug
syndicate or a hog combine.
Before Cleveland talks any more about
new communities in the West developing
into "undesirable States," he should take a
little thought of what an undesirable state
he has developed into himself.
If the postal authorities wish to give Mr.
Huntington a real pleasure they will stop
the circulation through the iuail3 of any
reports of tne evidence he has given under
the examination of Senator Morgan.
1 â Â»
The announcement of Manderson of Ne
braska as a candidate for the Presidency
has the advantage of bringing some of the
Presidential lightning west of the Missouri
River and gettirig things started our way.
The Republican party of California says
to the Southern Pacific Company of Ken
lucky, "Hands off." It says to the people
of California. "Beware." It says to the
members of rts own ranks, "Be on the
aiert."
"If they know in heaven what i 9 done
on earth," said Dr. Talmadge in his ad
dress at the Home Mission meeting at
New YorK, and while there was doubtless
as much virtue in tiiat if as in any other
it was certainly not orthodox.
The three links in the endless chain that
depletes the gold reserve are the deficit
revenue, the excessive imports and the
business depression, and as all of these re
sult from the Wiison tariff, the moment
we repeal that we break the chain.
The official statement in the Reichstag
that, while Germany does not expect to
maintain a navy equal to that of England
or of France, she does intend to have one
that will enable her to control the Baltic,
will be interesting news in Russia.
FEEE CUBA OE NOTHING.
The action of the Senate Committee on
Foreign Relations in recommending to the
Senate a non-concurrence with the House
resolutions on the Cuban question seems
to imply a determination to do something
more for Cuba than ca-n be effected by
a simple expression of sympathy. The
determination is tbe more apparent in the
appointment of Senators Sherman, Mor
gan and Lodge as a committee to confer
with the House for the purpose of reaching
an agreement. These Senators are among
the strongest and boldest advocates of free
Cuba in Congress, and it is not likely
either of them will agree to accept tbe
milder resolutions of the House for those
already adopted by the Senate.
The attitude taken by the House toward
the question can hardly be defended. If
Congress is to interfere at all between
Spain and Cuba, there should be nothing
equivocal in its words. A mere expres
sion of sympathy, an ineffective recogni
tion of the insurgents as belligerents, or a
suggestion on our part of a willingness to
mediate for the independence of the island,
would only aggravate Spain without help
ing Cuba. If no more than that is to be
undertaken, it would have been better for
the House to have followed the counsel of
Boutelle of Maine and Turner of Georgia,
and voted tbe resolutions down.
The nffairs of the Cuban people are in a
condition too critical to be used simply as
a subject for fervent oratory. Property
and life are at stake over there, and the
torch, the sword and the bullet are doing
their fearful work by night and by day.
It is a most practical question that con
fronts ns. It is an ii-sue for a government
and not for a debating society. Are we
resolved to hlep Cuba or not? If we are
not willing to give the help of resolute ac
tion, then we should not intensity the
wrath of Spain by taunts, nor delude the
suffering Cubans by words that awaken
vain hopes. If we do intend to help, then
we should give Spain plain notice at once
and not mislead her into the belief that
she can defy us and reject our mediation.
With the approach of spring in Cuba
comes the rainy season, and after that the
yellow fever. The time for that dread
pestilence is, therefore, not far distant. It
is estimated that over'2o,ooo Spanish sol
diers fell v victim to it last summer. An
equai fatality will occur this year if the
war continues, and in the horror of it the
combatants on both sides will use rire and
sword more ruthlessly than ever, and dev
astations and massacres will be an every
day occurrence. Shall we by the strong
power of our National might put an end
to this terror or not? Surely the issue is
not one that befits mere jingo speeches.
If we are to do nothing, let us be silent.
If we are to promise help, let us give it in
actions that are prompt to succor and pow
erful to save.
A HIGHEE PUBPOSE.
It seems that the Wilmerding School i.i
regarded in some localities more for its
value as a possible advertisement or as
opportunity for slightly increasing the
business of the community which may
secure it than as a great institution for
equipping the young to make a struggle
for existence. This is unfortunate. The
motive of the bequeet was noble, and to
degrade it by giving it a color of commer
cialism would be a great misfortune. Mr.
Wilmerding's idea was solely to provide
means for educating the sons and daughters
of the poor in useful trades that would lift
them above the harder labors and necessi
ties of life. He never dreamed that his
generous bequest would be so badly ap
preciated as to be deemed a convenient
advertising or commercial institution.
The people owe it to his memory, benevo
lence and patriotism to develop the highest
usefulness for his benefaction.
By reason of its large population, its
great number of poor residents, its manu
factories and its thousands of boys and
girls who would be benefited by such an
education as Mr. Wilmerding contem
plated, San Francisco is the proper place
for the institution. Here it would serve a
larger number of persons than anywhere
else in the State. Sites have been offered
free for. its location here, but even had
this not been done the trustees would be
clearly justified in buying a Fite if none
were offered free. To place the school
anywhere else would Â§eriously cripple the
usefulness of the institution and the op
portunities of the people to enjoy its
benefits, and that would be a direct assault
upon the purpose of the bequest.
This is not meant as a complaint against
the neighboring towns in their efforts to
secure the school by offering free sites. It
is proper for them to do all they can to ad
vance their interests. Nor is this argu
ment intended for the commercial benefit
of San Francisco. The sole question is
one of securing to those whom Mr. Wil
merding sought to aid the highest
efficiency of which his bequest is possible.
The one simple rule is to place such insti
tutions where they will do the most
good for the purpose they are to serve.
Viewed in that light tiie Wilmerding
School unquestionably should be estab
lished in San Francisco.
TJNPAEDONABLE DULLNESS.
If the editorial utterances of the New
York Tribune are to be taken as properly
indicative of the Eastern knowledge and
treatment of the railroad funding matter
we are confronted with evidence of Mr.
Huntington's splendid success as a per
verter of truth and wisdom. The Tribune
has made a scurrilous attack upon Senator
Morgan for his method of examining Mr.
Huntington â taking care, however, to ex
plain its animus against the Alabaman by
ridiculing him for an alleged speech which
he required an hour and a half to deliver
at some banquet. Hence it charges that
Senator Morgan consumed valuable time
of the Senate Committee on Pacific Roads
in his attempt to make Mr. Huntington
divulge some of the hidden rascalities of
the Contract and Finance Company, that
abte machine through which the Central
Pacitic managers put the funds of the peo
ple in endeavors to place them beyond the
possibility of recovery.
In speaking of the funding question the
Tribune thus displays its hopeless ignor
ance: "It is a simple business proposition.
It cannot be affected by any present in
quiry into the conditions under which the
roads were built and the obligations in
curred. These conditions have been inves
tigated and rein vi'stigat-.'d time after time
by Congress and by special commissions,
the last, appointed in 1887, having gone
exhaustively into the whole matter at an
expenditure of $100,000 and printed a re
port of thousands of pages which left no
point in the transactions untouched."
It vronld be impossible to crowd a greater
number of errors into so small a space.
There never has been any thorough inves
tigation. The nearest approach made to
one was by the commission of 1887, but
when the inquiry became too warm the
Federal courts were appealed to and they
stopped the work. More than that, the ac
counts of the Contract and Finance Com
pany, which, if discovered, would have
shown the crookedness of the whole uply
business, were discovered by that inquiry
to have been destroyed.
Furthermore, the Tribune misses the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
whole point by assuming that tbe obliga
tions incurred should not be considered.
That is so exactly the cry of Mr. Huntington
himself in his efforts to conceal the history
of the past as to constitute a remarkable
coincidence. The manner in which the
roads were built and the obligations in
curred are the soul of the case, because
those matters concern the history of the
plunder and pillage which the funding
measure is proposed to condone *nd re
ward. The Government ip now on a still
hunt for stolen property. It is small credit
to a great newspaper not to know that the
history of the past is the essence of the
present in this railroad matter.
CLEVELAND AND THE WEST.
The address delivered by President
Cleveland before the Board of Home Mis*
sions of tb>e Presbyterian church at New
York on Tuesday evening is curiously
illustrative of his mtntal attitude toward
the new States and growing communities
that constitute the great West. He saw
in the Home Missions of New York a
means to convert not New York but the
new States and Territories, and to that
theme he devoted the greater portion ol
his speech.
After declaring be would speak not as a
citizen, but as the Chief Executive of the
Nation, he went on to urge the impor
tance of reiigious instruction in the newly
settled portions of our vast domain, and
proceeded to describe these communities
as being largely under the influence of a
vicious and criminal element, and in great
danger of developing into "badly regulated
municipalities, corrupt and unsafe Terri
tories and undesirable States. 1 '
Ordinarily, the assertion of a need of
home missionary work in the West would
not be offensive, but when this section of
i the country is distinctly named as a field
for Eastern missionary efforts and the in
sinuation made that the builders of our
new commonweals are establishing unsafe
Territories and undesirable States, it is
certainly time to protest. The assumption
of superiority out of which such assertions
come is ridiculous. There is no greater
need for home missions here than in the
East, and New York itself is in as much
danger of developing into a "badly regu
lated municipality" as any community
this side of the Missouri River.
Cleveland, of course, is not the only
offender of this kind. There is a numer
ous class of people in the East who are
persuaded that they have all the honesty,
intelligence and righteousness of the coun
try. It is from this class comes the cry
that the West is opposed to "honest 1 '
money; that it is "ignorant" of finance;
that it seeks to "defraud" capital of its
rights. It is a class which ignores the
salient fact that the West has been settled
by the best elements the East could send
forth either from North or Sooth. Those
whom the New Yoric Board of Home Mis
sion? intend to send out to convert us will
rind it so, however, and after their arrival
will have to send back word that instead
of meeting heathens of the vicious ele
ment they have been met everywhere in
the West by men who offer them a cordial
co-operation in building up communities
that manifest every element of the best
civilization of America.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"The Maoris of New Zealand." said tt. R.

anybody, anyway. They never shoot or give
trouble otherwise.
"I think the new country will prove to have
some of the greatest of mines. B*ofa informa

â conclusion.
"And, by the way. it's a good time to say
with earnestness that if tin; manufacturers
and dealers of California will interest tnem
-Belvee energetically in the matter they can
sell many goods to New Zealand and Austrr.lla.
"I wanted to look at some mining machin
ery myself, but I got delnyed by the mistake of
the man who sold me my ticket, and I will not
be able to give it the time I desired, I will
have to wait till next autumn, when I come

"I have been to Europe and have been a long
time away, so I must hurry home. But the
trade of New Zealand and Australia, or a good
I deal of it, properly belongs to California in-
I stead of to England, and for one I hope Cali
fornia will get it."
"I noticed by the papers that Billy Eckoff
died in Cripple Creek, the other day," said
Colonel K. B. Brown last night in the lobby of
the Baldwin Hotel.
Colonel Brown drew a long breath in a re
i fiective manner as he resumed. "Billy was an ,
odd character in more ways than one, but he
was as smart as they make 'em In biisines
matters and I'm dead sure that Cripple Creek
J is a good camp or he wouldn't have staked It
I out for his share of the trade. Ue never made
a mistake on a mining camp and could look
further ahead and tell better what was going
to happen a year hence than anybody- else 1
ever met. But of course be couldn't use his
judgment on pneumonia. Nobody could fore
tell the result of a gamu like that.
"Billy Eekoff took a flare at most of the

put in a steam-heating pyslem, an electric

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE STRANDED KILBRANNAN.
Mr. Bell Tells op the Means Adopted to
Get the Ship Afloat.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib.:
In your issue of the 27th inst. you give an
account of. the floating of the British ship
Kilbrannan, in which it is stated that "with
an ease surprising even to those who accom
plished it" she was hauled into deep water; also
that two previous attempts with a full force of
a local tugboat company's tugs had railed to
budjte her, but that the last and successful
attempt required but two tug?.
There is an explanation of this which I feel
le my due.
I went to Port Townsend to investigate the
j chances of floating the Kilbrannati, arriving
, there February 17. 1 called ou the ship's
agents in regard to the matter. They told me
I that all the wreckers on that toast had been
' to them and offered plant;, hut that they were
| so lirmly convinced mat they could pull her
I off on the next big tide, which would be on
the 28th inst., that they accepted no offers.
As other wreckers hud been expected to give
j plans and had aone so, I dimply shoved them
i how I could rig a gear that would pull more
j than ten tugs at no*, more than one-tonth of
I the fXpense of the tugs.
I supposed of course that If my plans were
made live of 1 would have an opportunity of
working them, but the next morning while on
] the -vvnarf 1 noticed one of the crew of a tug
| lying at the wharf getting together and put
i ting on board parts of the gear that I had pro
posed the day before in the agent's office. A
gentleman standing near me (a stranger) asked
i the captain of the tug if those things were
I soing to the wrecked ship. The answer was
' "So; they are going up the sound." I stood
j there and watched the tnd go straight to the
j wreck, leave the outlit aud return.
>Â»ext day I went out to the wreck and found
the gear set just as i had shown in the agent's
office.
Sinhll wonder then that they needed but two
tugs when they could move her forty feet with
j the use of my plans and that three days before
the big tides, which all along had been deemed
a necessity for success in lloating her.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
The Paris conservatory is finding it very
bard to replace the loss of Ambroise Thomas.
Although the grand old man had reached the
ace of 84, he presided over the musical compe
titions almost until the end. Thomas was the
only composer who had assiitod In the flesh at
the one thousandth representation of one of his
own works. Gounod died ihortly before the mil
lennium of "Fau6t" was celebrated at the Orand
Opera, and even then it was the composer of
"Mignon" who wrote a suitable piece for the
apotheosis of bis old friend on the occasion of
the great jubilee of "Faust." Thomat seems
to have been fated to live to see celebrations.
He was president of the French Institute.which
in November last celebrated its centennary.
Speaking at the time, Thomas said to an inter
viewer: "I have lived too long; not that I have
reason to complain of my existence, since my
life, contrasted with that of many composers,
has been pleasant. Fortune has treated me
with clemency. The most gratifying emotion
that I have experienced during my long career
was the free performance of 'Miguon' on the
day following the gala, which gave an imprint
of a national character to my work." At tho
gala performance of "Mignon" by the artists of
the Opera Comique the leading men of France,
from the President downward, vied with one
another in honoring the veteran composer,
and the Minister handed him the cordon <>(
the Grand Cross ot the Legion of Honor, but it
pleased Thomas better to see how the masses
enjoyed his music. The composer of "Mig
non," "Hamlet," etc., was never a rabid
disciple of the "new" in music. Speaking of
Wagner he recently said: "A great musician,
a great intellect, but his suDjects are puerile,
and, lam not afraid to add, tediousâ at least
all those that are derived from the Scandina
vian mythology. I have never been to Bay
reuth, having had neither the opportunity nor
the wish to do so. I know that from the point
of view of mise-en-scene they have discovered
some very curious things over there; but this
manner of staging, although very phantasma
goric, is not great art."
Here is a chance for American composers to
go in and astonish the Old World. A Milanese
newspaper. II Teatro (The Theater), haa opened
a competition for the best one-act opera, with
out restriction of age, sex or nationality. The
works must be new, have never been entered
for any other competition and must not take
longer than an hour to perform. The choice
of subject and the genre of music (comic, seri
ous, romantic, classic, etc.) are left to the com
petitors; the scores enn contain choruses or
ballets, but there mult be no scenes which de
mand a very complicated amount of scenery.
The copyrights of the operas will remain the
property of the composers. Four prices have
already been deposited In a well-known bank;
the amounts are 3000, 1500, 1000 and 500
francs. An additional prize of 1000 francs will
be given to the best libretto, which must, how
ever, have been written originally in Italian.
The originator of the competition is Gagor
Steiner, who pledges himself to produce at
Vienna during the exposition which will take
place in October, 1896, the six works consid
ered most deserving by a jury. Composers de
sirous of obtaining particulars can apply to
II Teatro, 3 Via San Refaele, Milan. It was a
competition of this kind, started by the pub
lisher Sonzogno, that brought "Cavalleria
Rusticana" to light, and American composers
who are ambitious to try their skill against the
musicians of "Young Italy" should take the
present opportunity of being heard from.
Italy is being 11 terallyf deluged with a series
of first performances of new operas. The most
important yet seen this season is "La Boheme,"
by Poccini, which was produced at the Kegio
Theater, Turin, and had an immense success,
especially in the first, third and fourth acts.
After the first act, Princeiw Laetitia, step
mother of Priuce Louis of Savoy, called the
composer to her box to congratulate him on
his music and the splendid interpretation
which was being given to it. The public sa
luted Puccini with the most enthusiastic ap-

plause. Both music and libretto are said to be
full of vivacity and brio.
Less fortunate appears to have been the per
formance at the Dal Verme, Milan, of "La Cor
tigiana," an opera in four acts, with words by
Cimino and music by Scontrino. The book is
based on a romantic incident which is sup
posed to have occurred during the. siege of Ro
chelle, but the story is said to be banal and the
score wearisome. The same description seems
to apply to "Ettore Fieramosca," by Ferroni.
Indeed, in all the long list of "novelties," "L&
Boheme" seems to have been the only startling
success.
The Leipsic newspapers vouch for the au
thenticity of the following story : At the sta
tion of a little town in the outskirts of Wart
burg there is a port- 1 who is a good amateur
on the organ. When the cantor of the Protest
ant church falls sick, which not unfrequently
happens, the musical porter presides in his
place, to the complete satisfaction of the faith
ful. Recently it happened that the porter, at
a fey- minutes' notice, had tv replace the cantor
at a choral service. He played a prelude to
Bach, and some liturgical pieces, and was only
awaiting the end of the sermon to play the
people out, when, fatigued by his work at the
station the preceding night, and disposed to
slumber by the interminable length of the ser
mon, he fell asleep. The moment arrived when
the organist had to play an "Amen." and one of
the choir, seeing him to be nodding, shook
him roughly to awaken him. The poor porter,
who had gone to sleep thinking of his work,
woke up confused, and believing himself ;o be
still at the station, cried : "Express train for
Leipsic. AU aboard!" in stentorian tones.
A society has been formed at Leipsic to
raise a monument to John Sebastian Bach in
St. John's Church, in order that the bones and
skull of the master, recently found iv the an
cient cemetery oi that church, may be deposited
under a fitting memorial. The execution of
the monument has been entrusted to the sculp
tor, Charles Seffner, who reconstructed Bach's
bust from his skull. Among the members of
the committee are Johannes Brahms, Arthur
Nikiach and' Carl Relnecke, chefs d'orchestre
of the Gewandhaus, and tne anatomist, Pro
fessor His, who published the remarkable re
port on the bones of Bach, which were discov
ered about eight months ago.
Donizetti's good old ooera "La ravorita"
has been revived in some fear and trembling
by the management of the Paris Grand Opera.
As there Is a "new" school of criticism in
France, which cannot tolerate the old Italian
works, none of the critics were invited to bo
present. Oaly tho journalists who were anx
ious to see the work attended, and in this way
a good deal of *roastihc" was avoided.
The society that has been formed .in Vienna
to produce "Gaed," by Adelbort de Gold
schmidt, has placed its shares at $200 each.
So many of them have already been sold that
it is expected a magnificent production of the
work will be given next season.

That was early in 1854. When 11 years of age
she appeared on the stage in Petaluma, So

"The Loan of a Lover." For two years after
that she starred through the country as "La
Petite Lotta, an infant prodigy." In 1860,
when about 13 years of age, she ap

dance and minstrelsy at the Willows,
which was then on Mission street, between
Eighteenth and Nineteenth, and at Bert's
Meiodeon on the northeast corner of Clay and

her at .VÂ» attack's in "Little Neil, the Marchion
ess," the first time thÃt was produced, that
she won the hearts of the Gothamites. She

Mrs. H. J. Stewart, wife of H. J. Stewart,
the widely known musical composer and
critic, died at her residence, corner of
Hyde and Sacramento streets, at half-past
7 "o'clock last evening. The immediate
cause of her death was Bright's disease,
wtich was induced by a severe attack of
the grip.
Mrs. Stewart's death will be a distinctive
loss to critical musical circle? in this City,
as well as to her very wide circle of friends
and acquaintances, fehe was a very dis
tinguished musician, and was not only a
( r:;ic whobe judgment was highly valued,
but a performer on the organ and piano of
raro ability. She was the organist at Bfc
Francis Church in this City and also at
tbi Israel Synagogue. Her musi
cal education was gained in Ku rope, and
prior to their residence in this City, which
began ten ve are ago, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart
resided in London.

fame as a composer of several of the moat
successful opera?. They had but one
child, a beautiful little girt of 5 years,
named Franc s, now motherless. MM.
btewart had many accomplishments and
graces a.-ide from her musical attainments,
and there is a widespread and sincere grief
at her death. Tue funeral will probabiy
be held Friday.
AN AMERICAN STEEL SHIP
First of Her Kind Ever Built
in a United States
Shipyard.
MAIDEN VOYAGE COMPLETED.
She Made the Run From New York
to San Francisco in 153
Days.
The first and only steel sailing-ship evtr
built in the United States arrived in port
yesterday from New York. This is prac
tically her maiden voyage, as previous to
her run around the Horn she had only
been to Japan and back to America.
The new vessel was built by Artbur
S^well & Co. of Bath, Me., and was
named the Dirigo. She is a handsome

long, 45 feet 1 inch broad and 25 feet 6 |
inches deep. She is rigged as a four- j
masted bark and all her yards are of steel I
and in one prece. Captain George WÂ« !
Goodwin, her master, is well known in I
San Francisco, having traded in and out j
of this port in the Sterling, owned by j
Rosenfeld'B Sons. His first voyage to the j
coast was in 1872, when he was mate of the j
ship Nearehue, and after that he took ;
command of the Sterling. He is a
thorough sailor and treats the men under
him well. In consequence the Dirigo had
a happy family aboard during her passage
of 153 days.
A general description of the Dingo has
already been printed in The Call. Too j
much praise cannot be given to Captain
Gocdvun, however, for the shape in which
he brought his ship into port. She is as
clean and trim as a yacht, and ber decks
were washed until they glistened in the
sunshine. Under full sail she presents a
very handsome appearance, and is cer- j
tainiy the finest looking sailing ship in
port to-day.
The Sewells are notÂ«d builders of ships, \
and their yards at Bath are tne finest in i
America. They built and own the Roan- j
oke, the largest wooden ship afloat, and J
now in port; the Benjamin F. Packard, j
now on her way to New York from San â 
Francisco; the Susquehanna; the iron ship
Kenilworth, now on her way from here to I
Europe with grain; the Henry Villard; j
the William F. Babcock. which went from j
San Francisco to Honolulu to load sugar ;
for New York; the Iroquois, the Indiana. |
the Reaper and the Willie Rosenfeld. All !
these vessels are well known in San Fran- ;
Cisco, and are all considered first in their j
class.
The Dirigo was brought in by the tug
Hercules, but was docked by the Fearless.
j Williams, Dimond & Co. will have no
j dealings with the Shipowners' and Mer
chants' Tugboat Company since that con
cern's tugs, the Sea Queen and Hercules,
ran the Packard on a rock in Mission Bay. j
In consequence, when the Hercules i
brought the Dirigo in the members of the I
firm of Williams, Dimond & Co. were â 
chagrined.
The first tug to speak a sbip generally j
does all her work while in port. This is i
an unwritten law. but when tne testimony |
in the case of the Hercules was shown to
John D. Spreckels and it was pointed out
to him that the commerce of the port was
bound to suffer in consequence of the com- j
bination he agreed to handle the Sewells'
ships. Williams, Dimond & Co. said that
under no conditions would they employ
the Shipowners' and Merchants' boats, and
that if no facilities were given their vessels
by other tugboat companies San Francisco
would suffer. It was in these circum
stances that the Fearless caaie to dock the j
Diripo.
Williams, Dimond & Co. are now suing
the Shipowners' and Merchants' Tugboat
Company for $25,000 damages to the Pack
ard. The Jatter lirni dead that they can
only be assessed for the value of the tucs.
Experts on the stand placed the value "of
the Hercules at between $JCOO and $3000
and that of the Sea Queen at $5000. IT in
bringing in the Dirigo the Hercules
had put her ashore all the owners could
have recovered would have been the
value of the tug, whereas the *hip and her
cargo are valued at over $300,000.
The Dirigo brought one passenger, Dr.
A. Acidisoi. who made the passage around
the Horn for his health. Among the crew
is a young man named Charles Beckwith,
whoworked his way to Han Francisco in
order to attend the university at Palo Alto.
He has saved a few doilars during the trip
and between terms he hopes to oarn
enough to pay his way through college.

JESSE GRANT IN TOWN.
He Telia of His Trips to Examine Mines.
Sirs. U. S. Grant in Wash
ington.
Jesse R. Grant of San Diego, son of Gen
eral U. S. Grant, arrived here yesterday
and is at the Palace. He says the state
ments that he is interested in the camp of
Fortuna is a mistake. He says he owns a
few properties which are as yet largely
prospects instead of mines, but they are
not at Fortuna.
"The fact is," said Mr. Grant, "that I
liave not been going about a great deal
la'.ely. 1 have simply been living auietly
at my little place on the hill in San Diego.
About every six months I hear of some
big mine and go forth to see it, but usually
find it isn't big at all. Then I hear of an
other big one, and I go oil on a hard trip
again, only to have it turn out the sam"!
way. After this occurs several times I get
a fit of disgust and go home and rest about
six months, when I hear of something else
and start off again. 1 '
Mr. Grant will be here several days at
least. He says his mother, who has for
some time lived at San Diego, is at present
in Wnsbinttnn. Mr. Grant in size, color
of eyes, complexion and hair, greatly re
sembles the hero of Appomattox. Did he
wear a full beard, instead of merely a mus
tache, the resemblance would be more 1
Striking still.
In his profession as mining engineer Mr. i
Grant has visited at different times many
of the bigeest mines of the coast.
BULLET FOR A SNOWBALL
It Was P. {Salisbury, a Collector,
Who Shot Young Ed
McCarthy.
The Assailant Surrenders Himself to
the Police and Is Charged With
Assault to Murder.
The man who shot Ed McCarthy of 1017
Alabama street, at the corner of Folsom
and Twenty-second streets Tuesday morn
ing, was P. Salisbury of Berkeley. He
surrendered himself at the Central police
station yesterday morning, and made the
following statement to Captain Wittman:
I am collector for the real estate firm of
Baldwin <fc Hammond, 10 Montgomery street.
On my collection trip yesterday morning I
drove in my top buggy toward Treat avenue,
when I noticed a crowd of from fifteen to
twenty young men on the northeast and south
east corners of Folsom and Twenty-second
streets pelting the driver of a double team,
which team started to run away. I was then
about three-quarters of a block from the crowd.
I had been the target of merciless attacks all
the morning, and intending to scare the crowd
into leaving me alone, showing my pistol, I
cried out to the crowd, who all had their hands
full of snow, "Don't you dare fire at me or I
will fire at you." Just then a very hard snow
ball struck me in the right eye, striking my
eyeglasses and nearly blinding me, and I fired
off my pistol.
I simply intended to fire Into the air, but the
buggy careening around, the iron rod support
ing the top must have deflected the weapon.
I read of the wounding of voting McCarthy last
night and came to the City Hall this morning
to surrender myself.
Nine years ago last February, when there
was a fall of snow. I was struck In the face
with a hard snowball, which broke my eye
glasses and drove the rim deep into my eye." I
was laid op for three weeks and nearly lost the
sight of my eye* I was naturally afraid or a
repetition of that accident when I saw the
crowd, and that was a hy I warned them not to
throw snowballs at me.
Salisbury was booted on the charge of
assault to murder and his bonds were
fixed at |3000. Late yesterday afternoon
he was released on bonds.
Beck Charged With forgery.
Emile Beck, the ex-waiter at Stanford Uni
versity who swindled a large number of jewel
ers and hotel-keepers by means of forged let
ters and checks in the name of John T. Eh Her,
treasurer of the Students' Boarding Club, was
yesterday booked at the City Prison on two
charges of forgery. The complaining witnesses
are J. H. 'jreen, tiler* in the Cosmopolitan
Hotel, and F. P. Piagemann of the Golden West
Hotel.
A Seaman Fined.
Charles W. Orr, first mate of tlie ship John
W. Orr, was fined $50 by United States District
Juoge Morrow yesterday for assaulting J. V.
Smith oil the high seas.
Man Was Made to Mourn.
Perhaps, but rheumatism need not add to the

AGASSIZ` GREAT QUEST.
To Exploit the Vast Barrier Reef
of Australia and Pacific
Corals.
AN IMPOKTANT EXPEDITION.
He and His Companions Will Sail for
the South Sea Islands on the
Steamer Monowai.
Professor Alexander Apassiz, the distin
guished naturalist, arrived from Cam
bridge, Mass. , on Tuesday and registered
at the Palace Hotel. He is accompanied
by his son, Max Apassiz, and two assist
ant professors of Harvard Collegeâ Dr
W. McM. Woodworth and Dr. A. G.
Mayer. These naturalists left Boston last
week and came through to San Francisco
withont stopping on the way. They ex
pect to sail for Australia by the steamer
Monowai.
The purpose of the expedition, which
was planned by Professor Agassiz, is to
explore the Great Barrier reef of Australia
and other coral formations of the Pacific.
Mr. Wood worth, who accompanied Pro
fessor Agassiz, is well known in San Fran
cisco, where his brothers, Selirn E., Fred
erick A. and Benjamin, reside. Tuesday
evening the four brothers met at Selim E.
Wood worth's home on Lyon street and
dined together for the first time within
twenty-two years.
Alexander Agassiz, the leader of the ex
pedition, is acknowledged to be the best
authority in the world on certain forms of
marine life. I n the field of serf nee he is a
distinguished and learned man; yet so
great was the fame of his celebrated father,
Louis Agassiz, that Alexander is to-day
mentioned as the young professor.

[From a photograph.]
1835, is not a youth and neither is he an
old man. It may be said of him, a? it. Wats
of Dr. Holmes, that he is 61 years young.
He is exceedingly reticent and decidedly
modest in speaking of his work and
achievements. His example in this re
spect is followed by his assistants.
in 1859 Alexander Agassiz was in Caii
fornia on the coast survey and found time
to vioit many of the principal mines of
this region. In 1860 he returned to Cam
bridge and became aÂ«sistant in zoology at
the museum. From 1876 to 18Â«1 his win
ters were spent in deep sea-drtd-rinp ex
peditions with the coast survey steamer
Blake. He assisted largely in the devel
opment of the copper mines of the Lake
Superior region, and also explored tho
copper fields of Peru and Chile. On the
death of his father in 1874 he was made
I curator of the museum at Cambridge and
remained as such until 1885, when he re
i signed, owine to ill health. His publica-
I tions are numerous, principally on sub
! jecis of marine zoology. He is the author,
with Mrs. Elizabeth C. Agapsiz, of "Sea
side Studies in Natural History," of -'Ma
rine Animals of Massachusetts Bay," and
of the fifth volume of "Contributions to
the Natural History of the United
States," left incomplete by hi 9 father.
The present toui has been in Mr. Agas
siz's mind for many years, and he
regards it as an important enterpri o'*0 '* in
his chosen field of science. A steamer has
been chartered in Australia, and as it is
now late summer or early autumn on that
side of the equator the examination of the
coral reef will begin early in winter, the
season which Professor Agassiz regards as
the most favorable for this line of work.
Many tenders of hospitality to Professor
Agassiz and his assistants, Messrs. Wood
worth and Mayer, have been made since
they reached the City yesterday morning.
Time will not permit them to do much
more in a "social way" than to dine at the
Bohemian, University and Pacific-Union
clubs.
Dr. Woodworth will bear with him to
â¢ Hawaii and Samoa letters from Charles
j Warren Stoddard, Joseph D. Strong and
others who have lived in the South Sea
Islands.
Denies the Charge.
Elizabetn Dillon, the servant srirl who was
pocused by her employer. J. H. Cordoza, 35
D)rland street, of stealing three diamond rings,
surrendered herself to the police yesterday
morning. She denied having stolen the rings.
and showed Judge Joachimsen her hands full
of scratches, which she says were caused by tier
resisting eordoza's amorous advances. The
Judge promptly released her on her own recog
nizance.
TWO PERJURY CHARGES.
They Have Grown Out of the .Mercer-
Westcott Divorce Cage*.
Inez Mercer, who received a divorce
from R. P. Westcott, oa the ground of
fraud, has been arrested on a charge of
perjury. One of her witnesses, E. ri.
Isaacs, is also in custody on a similar
charge. Bo:h accusations have grown out
of the divorce trial.
Miss Mercer and Westcott were married
about a year ago. She says it was sap
posed to be a mock marriage, but the
groom secured a real license and a real
clergyman, and without knowing it
she was bound hard and fast. E. H.
! Isaacs was a witness snd be swore tothose
facts. T. H. Savage, woo was supposed to
lepresent Westcott, was in court, but he
made no objection. The only offset to the
testimony given was Westcott's answer.
He {raid it was a genuine marriage, and
every one knew it, but he did not appear,
and bo f he divorce was granted.
Now it la chareed that Isaacs was in this
City at the time he said he was in Port
j Jand. witnessinp the marriage, and it is
further charged that the whole story is a
fabrication of Miss Mercer's. The two
! arrests have therefore followed. Miss
I Mercer was just starting for Cripple Creek
| when she was arrested.

Startling Scenic Effects at the

It is a pity thai Warde did not put on
"King Lear" at the beginning of his en
gagement, for the play.which ran for Mon
day and Tuesday evenings, shows him at
his best. "Julius Caesar" was played last
night. Warde's work in the play is well
known to the San Francisco public and is
always popular here.
Hoyt's spectacular farce-comedy "A
Milk White Flag" will open a season at
the Baldwin next Monday night.
â¢'A Railroad Ticket" continues to fill the
Columbia Theater. Next week Eugene
O'Rourke and his company will present
"The Wicklow Postm:in."
The Carleton Opera Company gave its
last performance of "Fra Diavolo" at Gro
ver's Alcazar last night. "'The Bohemian
Girl" will be the attraction for to-nigbt.
Aliss Rena Atkinson is said to shine espe
cially in the role of Arline, and the rest of
the company is well suited to Balfe's well
known work.
4 Rip Van Winkle" is proving a strong
attraction at the Tivoli. Carrie Roma's
presence in the cast has largely helped to
popularize the performance, and Ferris
Hartman, as Rip, has a chance of display
ing a number oi jokes and local hits.
Audiences at the Grand this week are
reveling in the scenic horrors of "A Mid
night Flood." The melodramatic effects
are relieved by a good deal of sprightly
comedy, however, so that in spite of the
sad scenes depic'.ed no one rinds the
weight of woe oppressive enough to inter
fere with the evening's enjoyment.
As usual, the Orpheum is nightly being
filled with large audiences, which highly
appreciate the good vaudeville fare pro
vided. Mills and Collins have proved very
entertaining in their sketch, "Pygmalion
and Galatea Up to Date," and Albertus
and Burtram, two more of the new-comers,
are clever club-swingers and jugglers.
An excellent programme has been se
lected for Marsick's first violin recital,
which will take place at the California
Theater to-morrow night. Donald de V.
Graham will be the vocalist.
Miss Anna Eva Fay is mystifying and
entertaining the audiences at the new Au
ditorium with her Oriental magic and In
dian fakir performances.
The great musical sensation of next
week will be tie appearance at the Audi
torium of Materna, the renowned Wag
nerian singer, and Ondncek. the Bohe
mian violinist, who has created such a
sensation in the East this season Only
two concerts will be given, one on Thurs
day evening, the l'2th inst..and the last on
Saturday afternoon, March 14.
The Rosewald memorial entertainment
will taice place at the Columbia Theater
to-morrow afternoon. -Professor Moses

sical programme bas been arranged. The
proceeds will be devoted to the Kosewald

THE SEARCHLIGHT
OF THE COUNCIL
The Rev. Mr. Tenney Puts
Miss Overman to the
Test.
NEW FACTS ELICITED.
Pastor Brown Has Sent Mrs.
Tunnell Money on Two
Occasions.
THE WITNESS IS CONFIDENT.
Deacon Morse and Mrs. Cooper Con
tradict Each Otherâ An Open
Session To-Day.
If any additional evidence were needed
to show that Mis* Overman is a most pe
culiarly gifted young per?on it came yes
terday during her cross-examination by
the council.
She figuratively tied herself into all sorts
of apparently inextricable knots, but when
the linal test came the witness innocently
acknowledged that a mistake had been
made either by herself or the shorthand re
porter. She did the thing so easily and nat
urally that Stenographer Bennett and his
tantswere kept continually guessing
as to just now far they had missed the
spirit of what Miss Overman did actually
say.
The yonng lady was kept pretty busy
for something like three hours in correct
ing the mistakes in the alleged forged let
ters â that is, those portions which should
have been quoted as interjected. Wheu
these passages, and there were many, came
to her attention she declared lightly and
with apparent indifference, as though it
were a matter of no consequence whatever,
that she could not see how any one could
suppose Bach pertinent matters could have
been in the original letters.
It was absurd to think of such a thing
for a moment. True, she had something
like sixty days in which to mark these
incriminating sentences, yet the whole
tiling was BO thoroughly "revolting to her
sense of truth and justice I ' that she had
not cared to examine the letters micro
scopically, as some of the council evi
dently had.
Miss Overman denied that she had ever
been unduly under the influence of Pastor
r.rowi!.
.-he was wholly under Mrs. Davidson's
control lone enough to write half a dozen
cr more letters incriminating the man for
whom she felt an absorbing, con
suming passion. The witnes said she
had secured the Davidson letters sim
ilar in import andintent as the letters
which she now endeavored to satis
factonly explain. She secured the David
son documents one day when the rightful
owner was out, and, feeling that she was
doing a righteous act. forthwith tore them
into shreds and small pieces. As to what
became of the debris nothing was offered
in evidence.
Vailey Brown, the son of the accused
pastor, "was much in evidence yesterday.
He passed the time in taking copious
notes and incidentally calling the atten
tion of Attorney Nagle to some point.
O:,oe during the "severe cross-examination
conducted uy Mr. Tenney Valley whis
pered to the attorney that h* '"didn't see
what ice ail this cut." Mr. Nagle as
sured him that no ice was involved in the
proposition, though the reverend gentle
man dia seem to be dealing slightly in
cold, hard facts.
Dr. Pond appeared in the role of de
fender at the afternoon session. When
ever the crossfire became too heavy, ac
cording to his views of propriety and mod
esty, the reverend ecclesiastical member
rushed gallantly to the rescue. He was
not disposed to permit Miss Overman to
become embarrassed, and so vahiently dil
he struggle for this end that many perti
nent questions were left unanswered.
It was neariv half-past 2 o'clock when
Moderator McLean called the council to
order. There were present outside of the
press representatives some twenty persons,
including Mrs. Cooper and her daughter,
Mrs. IHanchard and Mrs. George Gaden.
Miss Overman was called to the stand,
and it being Mr. Tenney's turn to question
the witness for nearly an hour he poured
a continual stream of questions into the
unwilling ear of the young iady. Mr.
Tenney is neither a lawyer nor the" son of
a lawyer, but the manner in which he con
ducted the cross-examination would indi
cate that possibly he has hidden his light
under a bushel.
It was brought out during the examina
tion that Miss Overman had not only
heard from Mrs. Tunnel frequently, but
sent letters in return. On two different
occasions she sent money to tlie missing
witness, and, further on, said that Dr.
Brown had furnished the coin. Miss Over
man said she saw nothing strange in this.
"Why shouldn't he help her? ' she asked.
Mrs. Tunnell, said the witness, was pres
ent at several conferences with Dr. Brown
and Deacous Moore and Dexter. At that
time Mrs. Tunnell had no thought of
going away. The witness was asked if
tnere were any more of the Overman-Tun
nell letters. She replied thai, she nad al
ways thought there were other lettersâ
possibly two more â and if so they would
be of tne same tenor as those already pub
lished.
Then followed a long inquiry into the
Tunnell letters. The witness went over
the old ground, tangling herself up at
times and then extricating herself from
the difficulty by declaring a mistake baa
been made. In one of the letters appeared
the words "mental condition." Miss Over
man explained this by saying that she was
worried over Mrs. TunnelTs financial con
dition. Further on in the same letter the
writer had declared she was not disgusted
vith God, but with the people who voiced
him.
Mr. Tenney wished to know if this, which
evidently reierred to Dr. Brown, was in the
original letter. The wltoeea was not sure
about this, but thought it should have
been classed with the forged sentences.
"Why did you go over ah the matter in
the letters?" asked Mr. Tenney. "Why
gotothe trouble and bother of writing
now letters if no one was to see them?
Why not write a few lines? Don't you
think this a little bit strange?"
â¢I do not think this at all strange," an
swered Miss Overman. "Jt was necessary
to interject house matters in the letters in
order to convey the impression of genu
ineness."
At the evening session Deacon Morse
was tilaced on the witness-stand. In the
rourbe of his statement he said that Mrs.
r had told him, after the Turkish
tea incident, that she had made inquiries
raid found Mrs. Stockton to be a disrepu
table woman. He added that he would
stake his life on Dr. Brown's reputation.
Mrs. Cooper, laboring under intense ex
citement, asked permission of the coun
cil to make a statement. In a voice
.. iiverlng with resentment Mrs. Cooper
ceclared she had never in all her life
spoken to Deacon Morse about Mrs.
Stockton.
Tiiis was the only unusual incident of
t';i e evening session.
There is iittle likelihood of Mrs. Tun
nell appearing beiore tiie Â«rancil. A
telepram received from Los Angeles
yesterday stated she had left that city
"some weeks a<;o, her announced destina
tion being some point in Arizona.
The following are extracts from a letter
received yesteulay by Mrs. Stockton from
her brother. It throws light upon the
reason why Lloyd Tevis was interested in
her and her family:
Orland, Colusa County, March 3. 189 G.
Dear Bertie: * * â¢ I am sorry that Mr.
Tevis' name should hare been draegtd
into the rauss. i did intend to send
a card to the San Francisco jm>?s.
statine that Mr. T. r,ad helped all mem
t>.>--s of mo family since our fathers death in
1 8i>7 At that time he sent mother a pass over
the line of the California Steam Navigation
Company's boats, good for one year. Also sent
mother one year's provisions, and had them
shipped to Maine Prairie, and the first our
mother knew about it was when the freight
r.gi"it at Maine Prairie sent her word that
there was a iarjee quantity of freight there for
her- vc; Mr. T. had never met mother.
Ouf father let Torig have $5000 In the 'sO'g
and advised him to go to San Francisco, a* he
was not cut out for the mines. So you see it
dot's not seem strange to me that he should
assist yon. Tevis told me the last time I
saw niin that if I ever needed help to write to
bim. He al^n offered to help Albert.
My ftilvicv is to buckle on your armor and go
into that Brown-Davidson-Cooper fight to win.
With love from all, your brother,
W. P. Gat.
Dr. Brown was reported to be much
better last nisnt, and it is thought that he
will be able to make his statement to the
council to-day.
MATTIE STILL SWEARING.
She Made Plausible Answers to
Several Very Pointed
Questions.
Outside of the council and the reporters
there were not more than two dozen per
sons in the council chamber at the Brown
investigation at 2 o'clock yesterday after
noon, the impression having gone abroad
tnat only those persons directly interested
in the case as witnesses, etc., would be ad
mitted.
Mr. Tenney, who smiles the sweetest
when he asks the most catholic questions,
began his cross-examination by inquiring
whether Mattie had taken Mrs. Tunnell
with her on her blackmailing trip to the
Chronicle editorial rooms, and he received
1 uhe reply, given with all that hauteur which
is so becoming to Miss Overman's style,
that she had not.
Mr. TÂ»nney, with another sweet smile,
asked what was the financial condition of
Mrs. Tunneli, and whether that lady had
any income.
"Is it necessary to discuss Mrs. Tun
neil's finances? ' inquired Miss Overman
in tones-chilly enough to have frozen Nan
| sen to the North Pole. But the Tenney
S smile is unfreezable, and he replied that
! such was his opinion, whereupon Miss
I Overman answered that Mrs. Tunnell had
: had an income which had been cutoff by
her brother, since which time she had not
had jo much. She had been receiving
Borne house rent from her home in Gait.
'I 'id you give Mrs. Tunnell any
money? 1 ' was the next question.
"I gave her $20 on the evening she left.
I happened to have the money in my
possession from my sister."
"Didyour sister" give it to you to give
Mrs. Tunnell?"
"No; I received it without reference to
Mrs. Tunnell."
"Have ycu sent her any money since?"
"Yes; I have sent her a little."
"Was that also furnished by your sis
ter?"
"It was not."
There was a little emphatic twang on
the "not"' like the crack of a whip. Miss
Overman shifted uneasily in her chair, but
kept the marble-hearteu gaze of her cold
blue eyes upon the Tenney smile that
would neither fade nor be frozen.
"Who furnished it?"
There was a moment's hesitation on
Miss Matties part. Then came tne reply
clearly and distinctly:
â¢'Dr. Brown."
"How much?"
"Five dollars at one time."
"You sent it all. Do you remember how
much you sent?"
"Five dollars atone time; $10 at another
time.''
â¢Was that sent to her at Los Angeles?"
"Some of it was; flO."
"Why did Dr. Brown send her this
money?"
"Because she was a poor woman."
"Why should he aend it at this time?
Had he" assisted her before?"
"Xo; but I don't see why he should not
a3sist her."
"Yes; but the supposition that he sent
her away would iead to the supposition
tuat he had to support her while away,"'
pursued Mr. Tenney.
Mr. Hoyt stepped in at this juncture.
"You have been hesitant in your manner
of answering those questions about money.
Are you really hesitant?"
"I would prefer that Dr. Brown would
answer those questions."
"Have you told us all about the giving
of money by I)r, Brown to Mrs. Tunneil
since she went away?'"
"Yes."
"There is nothing farther?"
"No."
"Mrs. Tunnell had no thought until
that Sunday night of going away? Did
she not leave in pursuance of a plan be
tween you?"
"There wa3 no planning at all between
I us."
Moderator McLean asked whether Mrs.
i Tunneil was not employed at the restau
-1 rant, and whether sue did not receive
some compensation for her services. The
' witness replied that she believed she did.
"And she quit her employment to go
away?'' inquired the moderator.
"1 suppose she did."
In response to a question by Mr. Ten
; ney as to whether she knew that a person
: named Jones employed in tue co-opera-
I tive restaurant had disappeared at the
same time as did Mrs. Tunnell, the wit
ness said that Mrs. Cooper had said so,
and that was all she knew about it. She
; thought that there were one or two letters
I more than tho9e that were published in
the newspapers, but sne did not remember
whether or not there was anything in
them of an incriminating character.
Mr. Tenney then called her attention to
a statement in what had been conceded to
I be the original part of the first letter in
! June, 1895, as follows:
You didn't state in your last whether you
had been to see ti. again or not.
Miss Overman explained, in answer,
that the initial B had been inserted by
mistake for the letter D, which was meant
for Mrs. Davidson.
"If you correct those letters every time
we find anything in them that bears on
this, case we are at sea," remarked Mr.
Tenney, with a smile.
The witness replied that she had re
quested Mrs. Davidson eeveral times to
go and see Dr. Brown.
Mr. Dodge made the suggestion that in
all the letters where an initial was used
for Mrs. Davidson It was always "Mrs.
D.," and never "D.," and wnere i)r.
Brown was referred to it was "B."
'â¢Hott could you expect," asked Mr.
Tenney, "that Mrs. Tunnell would got
discover that the letters had been
changed?"
Miss Overman replied that she did not
expect that Mrs. Tunnell would read the
letters again.
"Didn t you think it possible that if
those letters were published they would
be brought to her attention?" asked Mr.
Tenney.
"No' sir," was the reply. "It was not
the intention to have them published in
the press."
"What was it then? Was not that a
part of the scheme between you and Mrs.
J)avi<lson to have some one "buy the let
verp?"
"No, it was intended to show them."
Mr. Pond asked whether the object
of Mr. Tenney'a questions was to impeach
the statement of tlio witness, to which Mr.
Tenney replied : "I think all of us have a
question in our minds ns to whether this
story that Mi.sa Overman tells is to be be
lieved ami I am trying to find out whether
there is anything in her statement
which throw* discredit on her story."
Mr. Pond said that he had no objection
to that line of inquiry, but suggested that
it was consuming a good deal, of time.
Mr. Tenney replied that lie thought that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
CHARACTERISTIC SCENES AT THE ECCLESIASTICAL COUNCIL.
[Sketched from life yesterday by a "Call" artist.}
was what the council had assembled for â
to spend a good deal of time in ascertain
ing what the truth was.
Mr. Hoyt interrupted at this juncture
by announcing that he had received a tele
gram from Los Angeles statin? that the
persons addressed had no knowledge of
her whereabouts.
Several other passages bearing upon Dr.
Brown were not marked by the wit
ness on her direct examination as having
been interpolated or remodeled. In some
cases she replied that they were not in the
originals, and that she had forgotten to
mark them; and in other cases she said
that Bhe could not remember, but she be
lieved that they were part of the interpo
lated or remodeled matter.
Mr. Tenney, on each of these occasions,
glanced at his fellow members of the coun
cil with a puzzled air, and remarked that
her corrections of the letters on her cross
examination were so many facts that
would bear against the credibility of her
former statement.
"I don't think so," commented Miss
Overman a little more clearly and dis
tinctly than usual, and with an unmis
takable accent of defiance.
Mr. Tenney, quietly ignoring all the in
terruptions, proceeded with his questions
as follows.
"Why, if you had no thought that these
letters would ever see the public eye or
be read by Mrs. Tunnell, dia you take all
pains to go over those letters that had
been written interjecting those passages,
instead of writing new letters entirely and
placing them in her drawer? What dif
lerence would it make?"
"I did write new letters."
"What was your interest in making
them seem authentic if nobody was to see
them?"
"I, myself, thought that it was going too
much into the details of home affairs, but
Mrs. Davidson insisted upon it."
The witness also explained that she had
used the expressions relative to her life
being ruined, and to the fact that Dr.
Brown could not help actins as he had
done because he had inherited an evil ten
dency, because Mrs. Davidson had dic
tated it to her.
Mr. Tenney announced abruptly that he
had no more questions to ask, and the
other members of the council proceeded to
cross-examine her in tv. n.
In response to a question Miss Overman
stated that she Bent the $10 spoken of to
the address of Mrs. Tunnell at Los An
geles. With reference to her attending
school at the business college she stated
that she understood that her tuition fee at
the school had been paid by Mrs. David
son. She had never been informed nor
had she suspected that any one else had
paid it. It was at the suggestion of Mrs.
Davidson that she went to the school.
She also explained that the rewritten
Tunnell letters had b*en taken to a lawyer
for the purpose of having him sell them,
but he refused to have anything to do in
the matter. Then anotherman took them
to the newspapers. She declined to give
the lawyer's name in public, so that the
papers might get held of it, but she had
no objection to give it privately to the
council.
Mr. Kader asked her whether she had
ever told Mr. Pierce, the cook at the Co
operative Restaurant, that Dr. Brown had
paid her tuition at the school.
She replied that she had never told Mr.
Pierce that or anything else about Dr.
Brown.
By Mr. Pond â Was this scheme directly
to blackmail Dr. Brown, or to prepare a
sensational story for publication?
The witness replied that Mrs. Davidson
never used the word "blackmail." She
said that it would be a lesson to Dr. Brown
and would do him good, because he was so
proud and puffed up. The witness did not
realize the whole import of the scheme at
nrst; but, of course, she realized that it
was wrong.
Mr. Pond asked what was the bearing on
the case of this alternative of a sensational
story to be sold to the papers.
She replied that it was a scheme that
might be presented to the Chronicle, or to
any one, or to Dr. Brown, in the expecta
tion that it would have weight.
Moderator McLean read from the testi
mony of the witness on thfi direct exami
nation the following: "So we entered into
a scheme to blackmail Dr. Brown."
"I don't think you could call it anything
but blackmail," replied the witness.
"Did you expect that the money would
come out of his pocket?"
"1 expected that the money would come
from him."
"Yon thought that the money would be
forced from him under compulsion rather
than have this story published?"
"That is what I was informed by Mrs.
Davidson."
'â¢Was it conscience that conquered at
last?" inquired Mr. Pond.
"I think it was nothing else."
Mr. Vreeland asked whether Saturday a
week ago was the first time that she had
told Dr. Brown about the plot wiih Mrs.
Davidson and about the rewriting of the
Tunnell letters and she replied that it was.
In response to a question by Moderator
McLean the witness said that after her
return from Tacoma she turned her back
on Mrs. Brown and did not speak to her,
because she (Miss Overman) was angry on
account of the remark which she was told
Mrs. Brown had made about her.and for the
further reason that she was not capable of
being a hypocrite. The letter which Dr.
Brown wrote to her taking her to task for
the expressions contained in the letter to
him, she said, had no weight with her in
the plot. She was not revengeful.
"What were the expressions used by
Dr. Brown in his letter to you rebuking
you and which caused you to t>e angry?"
"As having a Mgh regard and great re
spect for hie, but that if I thought that it
had gone any further Ii had made a mis
take. I cannot quot* any more of the let
ter, it was so long ago.''
"What was the particular expression
that cut you?"
"The fact that had I fancied so I had
made a mistake; that's what cut me."
"After the plot or scheme so advised was
repented of by you and forgotten by Mrs.
Davidson was there any conversation on
her part or yours with roference to con
triving some other way of obtaining
money?"
"Never."
"I understood that you were very much
interested in Mr. Allen's meetings* where
the great scheme was the second coming of
the Lord?"
"My resolution to devote my life to mis
sion work was made before I attended
those meetings"
"Was there not a new tenderness of con
science in connection with the unveiling
of those truths? Would it not create an
appeal to the conscience so that a person
should walk very carefully with reference
to the matter of truth?"
"I think it would. 1 '
"Have you a new sense of truth and a
great desife in the present investigation to
say nothing but the truth?"
"I think I have."
"You stated that you came here pre
pared to make a clean' breast of this mat
ter. I want to ask you if you have made
a clean breast of the whole of this affair?
Have you withheld anything important?"
"I have, but there are some important
points that you have not Drought out on
the cross-examinatioii."
In response to questions by Mr. Barker
the witness said that she believed Mrs.
Baddin to be a mythical character. If
Mrs. Baddin had been in the service of
Mrs. Davidson the witness would have met
her. She had said before that she thought
that Mrs. Davidson and Mrs. Baddin were
one and the same person.
"How much of this money that you and
Mrs. Davidson plotted to "get out of Dr.
Brown were you to have received?"
"I was to receive one-half of it."
'"'Did she ever ofier to give you any por
tion of that $500?'
"No sir."
Mr. Pcudder asked: "Before this thing
came out did you consider Mrs. Thurston
a truthful woman?"
"Not altogether."
"Could all of her statements, which yon
deny, have been misunderstandings aris
ing out of conversations which you had
with her?"
"Very likely. I was told that Dr. Brown
had an enemy in Mrs. Thurston, and I
should have to expect her enmity in this
church."
"Who told yon that?"
"Mrs. Tunnell. I will say that Mrs.
Tnnnell knew nothing- whatever about
this blackmailing scheme."
Mrs. Tunnell is said to have stated to
Mrs. Thurston that you had received $35
per month."
"No, sir; I never received that."
"She is said to have said also that Mat
tie expected some compensation for the
manner in which Dr. Brown had slighted
her affection?, and that you didn't propose
to be cast aiidr in that way?"
"I never told Mrs. Tunneli anything
like that or Mrs. Thurston. I never made
any remarks to the effect that it was
strange that Dr. Brown should be stand
ing in the pulpit teaching morality. I
never told Mr?. Tunnel! that I was going
to the trustees of this church with any
etory whatever. I never told Mrs. Tun
nell that I was going to sell this informa
tion to the newspapers. Where she got
that information I don't know. Mrs.
Thurston has made many peculiar state
ments. I flatly contradict them. I never
told Mrs. Davidson of my affection for
Dr. Brown before I returned from Taco
ma."
"Before February 1 all your attempts in
the way of prevarication were in the effort
to cover this private plotting?"
"That is all."
"Where is the paper which you drew np
as a confession to Dr. Brown?'
"I have it at home."
"Have you ever received money from Dr.
Brown?" asked Mr. Hoyt.
"I have received some money since this
unhappy affair for carfare. I did dress
making for Mrs. Brown and the doctor
has paid me."
"He never furnished you with any funds
until quite recently?"
"Never. He never aided me in any way
financially."
"Have yon received additional informa
tion concerning Mrs. Tunnells earlier life
since this trouble began?"
"Yes; through the newspapers, which
have put a different construction on
things."
"Have you ever told Mrs. Tunnell that
you wanted her to aid you by evasions of
truth?"
"I asked Mrs. Tnnnell if she could state
under oath that I had never told her of
my affections for Dr. Brown, and she re
plied she would not. I told her I would
not expect her to. 1 am perfectly sure
that if Mrs. Tunnell had any connection
with^this affair I would have "known it."
"You sent Mrs. Tunnell money," asked
the moderator, "after this full confession
on your part in the paper?"
"Yes."
"Why did you send her money when all
that she could tell had been told? Why
does not she come back?"
"I don't know. I wish she would come
back."
"She left on the 29th of December, and
those letters were published on January 7
âthat was nine daysâ did you make any
search of her effects for those letters?"
"No."
"When yon went there to get her
clothes you didn't have to show any
authorization from her?"
"No."
"Didn't it occur to yon that there was
something like a dynamite bomb that
eomebody might strike their foot against
and explode?"
"1 thought they were in her trunk at
Mrs. Eaton : n in Oakland and that they
would not bo found by any one."
Mr. Tenney came in again and asked
about the friend who took a letter from
Mjss Overman to Mrs. Tunnell after Mm.
Tunnell left this City? The witness said
that this person wai a man.
How TsThat ?
Mr. Tenney thereupon read from the
shorthand reporter's transcript of the day
before in which Miss Overman usea the
pronouns "she" and "her" in speaking of
this "man."
The witness contended that the short
band reporter must have been mistaken.
"What possible reason can you have,"
continued Mr. Tenney, "for withholding
the name of that man ? There is a sort of a
mystery in our minds connected with tnat
man."
"I can't see why there should be," re
plied the witness calmly.
"For the purpose of clearing up that
suspicion in our minds." said Air. Tenney
promptly; "we would tike his name."
"I don't see why there should bo any
suspicion. I had never known him before.
I thin* he came from Visalia. I don't
think he would care to have his name
mixed up in this affair."
Mr. \\ illiams asked whether Miss Over
man's relations with Mrs. Eaton were not
of such a nature that the witness could
not haVe gone to her house and taken pos
session of the letters?
The witness replied that she thought
the letters would be perfectly safe there.
"Would they not be safer in your Hands
or burned up? ' persisted Mr. Williams.
"Is uppose so."
The hour of 5 having arrived a recess
was taken until 7 p. m.
THE EVENING SESSION.
Dr. Brown Not Present, but Attor
ney Nagrle Conducts a Vigor
ous Defense.
It was half-part 7 before the members of
the council tiled in from the ante-room
and took their seats on the rostrum.
Dr. Williams led in prayer, after which
0. H. Heineman, secretary to Captain
Lees, was called and subjected to a critical
examination by Attorney Nagle as to the
report of Detective Seymour.
The witness readily recognized the re
port, and after this identification Mr. Nagle
read the document, which has already
been published.
Another report from Detective Seymour,
detailing an interview with Mrs. Gilley,
was also read.
"Do you Know why the Chief wished to
have Mrs. Gilley interviewed?" the wit
ness was asted
"Because it was understood that she had
seen Dr. Brown and come woman enter a
lodging-house on the corner of Sixtu and
Bryant streets. But the lady had seen
him alone. Dr. Brown subsequently ad
mitted that Mrs. Gilley was right. He
had pas9ed Mrs. Gilley's house while on
his way to the dumps."
The report of an investigation made by
Dr. Brown, Detective Seymore and witness
in the chair was also identified and read,
all the contents thereof having been previ
ously published.
When witness had identified a report
from Massachusetts purporting to be a
story of Mrs. Davidson's character and
career in the East and Attorney Nagle had
started to read the same the judge advo
cate asked to be permitted to examine the
record.
After glancing over the typewritten lines
to satisfy himself as to the character of
the document Mr. Woodhams asked what
was the the purpose of its introduction.
"Because," responded Mr. Nagla, "we
want to show the character of the woman
we have to deal with â Mrs. Davidson."
"I object to the report," eaid the judge
advocate, "because the crime with which
Mrs. Davidson is charged in that record is
not a felony."
The moderator â Testimony of the same
kind has been introduced heretofore, and I
rule that it be presented.
Whisperings were heard on all sides,
"What's the matter?"
In reply to the question of the judge
advocate Attorney Nagle said again that
it was for the tmrpose of showing the
character of the chief witness against Sr.
Brown that he wanted to introduce her
record. "If this does not show the Kind
of woman she is then there will be no
necessity for the paper being accepted."
He then read Several paragraphs from the
cooy of the Massachusetts court record
detailing the specific charges and convic
tions in the case of the commonwealth
against Mrs. Davidson, chief of which was
the selling of mortgaged property.
When Mr. Nagle had finished the Rev.
Freeland said there would not appear to
be any cause for further discussion, as the
attorney's reading had evidently accom
plished the purpose for which it was de-
Bired to introduce the paper.
A remark by the judge advocate to the
effect that the admission of such a docu
ment was not in conformity with, the
rules of law and common practice precipi
tated a two-minute night of eloquence
from Dr. Brown's attorney.
"If you want to try this case according
to rules of common practice," he began,
then nearly all the testimony that yon
have received must be stricken out. You
have permitted Mrs. Cooper to read let
ters here and furnish evidence on no better
authority than third and fourth hand
rumors against tlie character of the ac
cused. The testimony of Mrs. Eaton was
of the same kind, and all that you accept- !
ed under oath as a council.. If you wish |
to invoke tlie State law then you have no |
right to drag on all this hearsay evidence, j
"In this record we intend to impeach
the witness and show that stie has suf
fered lapses of memory, and we wish to i
enable her to remember whether she was !
in certain places three or thirty months. |
If you strike out one part of this kind of j
testimony you must strike out all. You !
cannot blow hot and cold at the same j
time. Be fair to both sides."
"The cnair to take the course outlined
by Mr. Na.le would have to be consist- 1
ent," rejoined the moderator.
"I am in sympathy with the introduc
tion of this document and I have so de- ;
cided. If there is a difference of opinion \
in the council then let a ruling be taken
by appealing from the chair.
Mr. McKee favored a consistent policy
on the part of the council.
"If you admit this document," said Dr. \
Tenney, "tben there will be a clamoring '
for an admission of similar matters all !
through this investigation."
"You admitted a letter of similar char
acter signed by a clergyman; this is j
signed and sealed from a court of justice,"
retorted M r . Brown's defender.
The ruling was not appealed from, and
the judge advocate instructed the scribe
to take note of the fact that he objected to
the document as being inadmissable.
Witness was then shown a letter from
J. C. Shaw, Deputy State Fira Marshal of
Massachusetts, accompanying the court
records and also inclosing a photograph of
Mrs. Davidson.
Mr. Heinenian identified them both,
whereuuon Attorney Nagle read the
official's letter in wnich he offered to come
West and testify in the case as to Mrs.
Davidson's career in the Kast if necessary.
A letter of similar purport from W. B.
Watts, Chief of the Police Department,
was also identiried and read.
Another photograph was shown witness, â 
which he pronounced a good likeness of :
Mrs. Davidson. It was taken after her ar- I
rest for the Police Department.
Though tue letters, photographs and
court records were introduced in evidence
by the accused pastor's counsel the pro- j
ceedings up to this point had not been en- I
livening, and the audience on the gui vive j
for the appearance of Dr. Brown was
doomed to disappointment.
Judge-Advocate Woodhams had no
questions to aaK of the witness.
The point was raised by Mr. Tenney that
the fact that Mrs. Baddin had not been
married in any of the ten counties to
which letters had been sent by the detec- \
tives was very little evidence as to whether j
Mrs. Baddin had been married in the I
State.
Mr. Nagle read letters from Captain Lees
and Detective Seymour in regard to at- j
tempts to have somebody else represent
Mrs. liudiiin, that testimony showing that
Mrs. Davidson had tried to get Mrs. Welles- ;
ley of Fruitvale to personify Mrs. Baddin '
in the trial.
Mrs. Wellesley is declared to be very ill,
and it will not be possible to get her to ap
pear as a witness. An objection was made ;
that none of the statements relating to
Mrs. Wellesley had been made under oath
and that the matter ought to be investi- .
gated by the committee. No action was
taken.
Moderator McLean announced that in
the future he would adhere to his previous
ruling in regard to testimony iffered for
the impeachment of witnesses, an excep
tion having been made in the Davidson
instance on account of the peculiar rela
tion of Mrs. Davidson to the case.
Mr. Nagle called for Miss Overman
again, but that witness was not present.
Deacon Isaac H. Morse of Dr. Brown's
church was next called. It was his tirst
appearance. He said he joined the church
in 1868. Mr. Nagle questioned him.
Do yon remember the time that Mrs. Stock
ton came into the church?
1 do.
Do you remember the incident of the French
tea ?
Turkish tea, 1 remember that.
Excuse me. Turkish tea. You remember
that?
1 do.
Was Dr. Brown pastor then?
He was.
Did he have much to do with Mrs. Btockton
at that time?
Not that I know of.
Did he meet her of tent
Not to my knowledge.
Did you ever see him in her company?
Never, excepting in the church.
This was in 1893 and 1894. Who did Dr.
Brown usually come 10 church with?
With Mrs. Brown.
Did you ever see him come with anybody
else?
No.
Did he go away from church with any other
woman ?
Not to my knowledge.
Did you hear anything against Mrs. Stock
ton's reputation soon after the time of the
Turkish tea ?
I did.
What was it ?
Mrs. Snrah B. Cooper told me that Mrs. Stock
ton was an immoral woman.
When did you speak to Dr. Brown about Mrs.
Stockton ?
Four or five months after.
Mr. McKee asked about the choir objec
tion to Mrs. Stockton.
Dr. Mooar asked whether Mrs. Cooper
had used the words " disreputable
woman" in relation to Mrs. Stockton.
Mr. Morse replied that those were the
exact words used. Mrs. Cooper did not
condemn Dr. Brown, but she said that he
was unfortunate in having defended the
woman's character.
Members of the council asked various
questions in regard to testimony previous
ly given.
Deacon Morse said that Dr. Brown had
consulted him and Deacon Dexter about
the question of arresting Mrs. Davidson.
He stated that he was called to Dr.
Brown's study. Deacon Dexter was there.
Dr. Brown seemed excited. He took the
deacons to a lodging-house on Geary
street, where Mrs. Brown and Miss Over
man were waiting, and there the whole
story about Mrs. Davidson was told. The
police were consulted, and Mrs. Davidson's
arrest followed.
Dr. Brown had not consulted Deacon
Morse about paying the $500.
\ A demand for the return of the money
had been made by Dr. Brown. Airs.
Davidson taught her Sunday-school class,
as usual, the following Sunday, and she
disappeared immediately afterward.
The witness testified that he had seen
two brief letters that Dr. Brown had writ
ten to Miss Overman.
"What were the letters about?" asked
Dr. McLean.
"About kindergarten work and other
things of that sort."
"What did Dr. Brown say?"
"I cannot recail, as I did not pay much
attention to them."
"What did Dr. Brown say about the
kindergarten work?"
"He discouraged her about it."
Dr. WiHiams asked whether Mrs. Stock
ton had joined the church on confession of
faith.
"I do not remember," said Deacon
Morse.
"The records would show, I suppose?"
<- I think so."
"Was Mrs. Stockton baptized at the
time?"
"She was baptized in Dr. Brown's study."
"Is that usual in your church?"
"It is not."
"Who was present?"
"Deacon Vasconcelles and I."
A brief cross-examination by Mr. Wood
hams followed.
Deacon Dexter thought he would be able
to recognize the letters that Dr. Brown \
wrote to Miss Overman. They were writ- !
ten on tbe church letter-heads.
The witness said that he me' Mrs. David- \
son on the evening of the day that Dr. j
Brown demanded the return of the Â£M) 0.
Mrs. Davidson aid not know that Dr. !
Brown was to appear and she disappeared
as soon as she learned of the fact.
"What would have been the result if '
Mrs. Davidson had returned the $d00r"
asked Rev. Dr. Williams.
"I know nothing about that," was the
reply.
Judge-Advocate Woodhams announce \
that the letters written by l>r. Brown to i
Miss Overman, as alluded to in tK> dea
con's testimony, wonld be produced by ;
the accused pastor.
Deacon Dexter made a voluntary state- j
moot then, in which he said:
â¢â¢I think I know Dr. Brown thoroughly.
I have read all that was printed in the
papers about him, and I am willing to
stake my life on Dr. Brown's integrity.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper created the enliv
ening scene of the evening. She sent word
to Mr. Woodhams that she wanted to get
an opportunity before the close of the ses
sion to contradict Deacon Morse, and so
she was called to the stand.
Her eyes snapped with excitement, and
she was very much acitated.
"I never in my life had the interview
with Deacon Dexter that he talks about!"
she almost shrieked. .
"I never used the word 'disreputable in
speaking of Mrs. Stockton! Never!
Never! Never!"
Moderator McLean reminded MrsÂ«
Cooper that she was very much excited,
and that she ought to give her evidence In
a calmer manner. The witness replied:
"Yes, i know; I am all right now.'
Then she continued :
"I never spoke to Mrs. French about it.
never; and I don't think I would to Dea
con Morse. Mrs. French was the most in
terested party."
Mr. Nagle asked: "Didn't you have a
talk with Mrs. French at about the time of
the Turkish tea regarding the matter?"
"She told me her troubles," said Mrs.
Cooper, "and I said: 'Perhaps Providence
has sent you to me.' "
"Isn't it possible," inquired Dr. McLean,
"that there may be a lapse of memory?'
"No." And Mrs. Cooper was very short
and quick in her use of the word.
"Didn't you have any talk with Deacon
Morse on the subject, at any time?"
"Never."
That ended the questioning, and the
council adjourned until 2 o'clock this after
noon.
Deacon Morse spoke to Mrs. Cooper
about the question of the testimony after
the adjournment, but Mr?. Cooper was
very emphatic in her declaration that the
testimony was not true, and the deacon
refrained from going any farther into the
controversy.
It is now a plain question of veracity,
and the testimony of Mrs. French wi'l oe
asked for as the only available evidence, so
far aa is known, that will have bearing on
the oase.
Mrs. Cooper is emphatic in her assertion
that Deacon Morpe did not tell the truth,
and she declared that there could not have
been any misunderstanding.
MRS. TUNNELL HEARDFROM
Acted as a Nurse for a Few Weeks
In Los Angeles Under an As
sumed Name.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 4.â Your
correspondent called at Mrs. Tansey's, 921
South Olive street, to-day in search of
Mrs. Tunnell, whose presence is so much
desired at San Francisco in connection
with the Brown-Overman case.
The Call reporter was hospitably re
ceived by Mr?. Tansey, who is the widow of
Dr. Tansey, formerly a circuit preacher In
the Methodist church. She has been an in
valid for seven or eight months, requiring
the constant care of a nurse, and it was in
that capacity that a woman of about 62
years of age, calling herself Mrs. Baker,
applied for a position with her about live
weeks ago. This woman, according to
subsequent developments, wa3 none other
than Mrs. Tunnell. She proved, so Mrs.
Tansey says, to be a quiet, rehned lady
and capable nurse and gave complete sat
isfaction. At all times she evinced the
greatest interest in the Brown case, saying
to those about her that she knew Mattia
Overman at Tacorna and liked her well.
On Sunday, February 23, Mrs. Baker re
ceived a letter of thirteen pages, which
she admitted was from Mattie Overman.
She seemed quite uneasy after reading it,
manifesting her restlessness by going
downtown frequently.
On Monday night, the 24th, she took the
landlady. Mrs. Dickerson, into her confi
dence, and confessed that she was Mrs.
Tunnell masquerading under an assumed
name. She explained that her motive in
keeping away from San Francisco was
partly to avoid publicity, but mainly be
cause she was friendly to both parties in
the case and did not want to tjecome in
volved in their wrangles. She never dis
cnssed the merits of the case.
The next morning Mrs. Tunnell took
her satchel, ana, with only a few last
words, left. She said that the detectives
had discovered her retreat and she must
go. She wanted to enter into further ex
planations, but apparently was frightened
and hurried away. This afternoon a de
tective called to see her, but cot only the
information that she had flown. The
landlady believes she has gone to Arizona.
During her residence at Mrs. Tansey's
she stated that she had a brother-in-law
named Strong at Sacramento, and a son
living somewhere in South America.
BIG DRILL OF CADETS
League of the Cross Members to
Hold a Rousing Rally
April 10.
Something About a Worthy Organiza
tion Formed to Discourage
Intemperance.
Preparations are now under way for the
repetition of the grand competitive drill
and concert of the League of the Cross
; Cadets which took place at the Mechanics'
! Pavilion last May.
The committee in charge is most ener
getically working for the success of what
they term the grandest military affair ever
' given in this City. . The Mechanics' Pa
vilion Has been hired for the evening of
i April 10, and accommodations will be
made" for nearly 4000 people. The Fifth
United States Artillery band, stationed at
the ; Presidio, has been engaged for the
evening, and will give a concert before the
i drill. The field music, formerly attached
' to the First Infantry Regiment, have vol
i unteered their services.
The League of the Cross, of which the
! cadets are . an auxiliary, is a temperance
' organization for young men and boys, or
! ganized by Bishop Montgomery to discour
! age the habit of treating and visiting
. safbons as also to promote total abstinence.
It. was a success from the start and no\r
\ numbers between 7000 and MOO members.
â¢ Shortly before Bishop Montgomery was
I appointed to the bishopric in the spring of
1894 the auxiliary known as the cadets De
â  gan to organize, and on his departure
i Father Yorke was given full charge of the
i organization. .
Under the guidance of the new and ener
! getic director, ably assisted by Colonel "W.
P. Sullivan, the cadets outstripped all cal
culation and won themselves and pro
moters ; much credit at the Pavilion last
! May on their first appearance. The cadets
| are now known as the First Regiment,
j League of the Cross Cadets, and consist of
500 members of ten companies, with regi
mental headquarters at 14 McAllister
street, room 43. -
There is a great deal of rivalry between
the companies for the trophy in the com
petitive drill. Last year it was won by
Company C, St. Patrick's, and they en
tered; to keep it," although Company A
Cathedral, Company G, St. Brigid's and '
Company I, St. Peter's.are making a great
effort to win, while All are looking for *
dark horse among the other companies.
In; fact every member, from the colonel
down, is working hard; to show his friends
what the cadets have accomplished in the
last year, Besides the drill there will be
a dress parade, guard mount and reci
mental review, tickets are now on sale at
the Monitor office, 29 day street, the
Youth* Directory and all company head
quarters. ' â â â¢ â â¢â¢,â-' :

TO THE POLE
The Professor Wants to
Locate the Northern
Magnet.
AN EXPEDITION MAY GO
The Plan to Be Laid Before the
Geographical Society
To-Day.
OF PABAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.
The Discovery of the Geographical
North Pole Is of Comparatively
Little Importance.
Professor George Davidson is now formu
lating plans, long under consideration
with him, for sending out an expedition
3lap Indicating the Whereabouts of the Magnetic North Pole, the Location of Which Professor George
Davidson Desires to Scud an Expedition to Fix Absolutely.
to absolutely locate the north magnetic
pole.
A meeting of the council of the
Geographical Society of the Pacific, of
which he is president, will be held at his
office on California street this morninp, at
which the initial steps will probably te
Jaken.
"The fixing of the north magnetic pole
is a matter of real moment to science and
the world at large," said Professor David
son last evening. "Compared with it the
discovery of the north pole proper, about
which there is so much talk, to accomplish
v* hich :-uch vast sums of money have been
expended and so many valuable lives have
been lost, is no practical value whatever.
"S ome day a Ifcan will come out of the
north nearly frozen and starved, having,
jerhaps, left all his companions benind
him to die, and will say to the world: 'I
have been to the north pole.' He may
thereafter enter a museum or write a
book, but the world will be no whit better
for either. Suppose he tells us that they
have strawberries all the year round at
tie north pole? To be sure that would
seem curious and perhaps some other ad
venturers, who knew nothing better to do.
would spend some more millions to prove
him a liar. But, seriously, I know of no
real good that may result from the dis
covery or the north pole.
"The locating of the north magnetic
pole, however, is an entirely different mat
ter. It is of the highest importance to
ECience, and just why it has been so neg-
Jected while such effort has been directed
at the less important enterprise is some
thing I cannot understand.
"Fortunately nature has placed it within
reach of ordinary endeavor. The north
magnetic pole is at about 70 deg. 5 mm.
north latitude, 96 deg. 46 mm. west longi
tude. In otber words, it is near Franklins
Bay, about the center of the north coast of
British America.
"I am perfectly aware that it is the gen
eral impression there is no difference be
tween the north pole and the north mag
netic pole. Many very well-informed peo
ple are of the belief that the struggle to
reach the north pole is chiefly prompted
by a desire to solve the mystery of the ter
restrial maenetâ to see how the magnetic
needle would act, and possibly to discover
why.
"The fact is, however, that the magnetic
pole that governs the action of the needle
is more than 1000 miles south of the
north pole proper, as I have said, on this
continent. At the north pole the needle
would simply point south. There is an
other magnetic pole of lesser force in
Northern Siberia and corresponding south
ern poles, the stronger being located in
Southern Australia.
"What the magnetic pole is cannot be
eaid. Whether it is great masses of iron,
as has been guessed, has yet to be deter
mined. The first thing to be done, how
ever, is to locate it exactly. Then, after a
infficient lapse of time, say twenty or
thirty years, send out another expedition
Â»nd determine whether or not it was ex
actly at the same pointâ whether or not it
had shifted.
"Has anybody ever been to the magnetic
pole? Yes; Sir James Clerk Ross, in his
expedition with the Erebus and Terror, in
1840-43, passed over it. An expedition
under Captains Moore and Clarke, and
that of General Lefroy in the following
year, sent out for the purpose of making
a magnetic survey, located the pole within
reasonable limits. Now, the thins most
important to be done is to fix the location
of the pole absolutely. Then, as I say,
some future expedition will be enabled to
determine whether the pole remains fixed
or whether it is a shifting substance.
"How would it be done? Well, the
searchers would go to the spot to which
the magnetic needle points the way. The
passing of tha.t point would be immedi
ately indicated by the needle itself, for
above it the needle does not point north
but south. At the pole the needle points
downward toward the earth. The party
having come within the influences of the
immediate vicinity of the pole would circle
round and by studying the action of the
needle and careful observation be enabled
to rix upon the exact t>pot.
"The idea of sending out or advocating
the sending out of an expedition for this
purpose is not new with me," continued
Professor Davidson.
"About ten yeara ago I had a long cor
respondence w'tb Mr. Gilder, editor of the
Century, on this subject. He tried to en
list \V. K. Hearst, then just beginning his
career with the Examiner. Gilder first
spoke to Hearst when the Jatter was on a
yisit to New York, but Hearst did not take
a very lively interest In it. 'There is a
man,' said Hearst, 'that I would have to
consult before I give any answer to the
proposition, and he is not here. 1 always
consult him on any matter of this kind.'
"'Who is the man?' asked Gilder.
" 'Professor George Davidson.' said
Hearst.
" 'Great Scott !' exclaimed Gilder, 'that
is the very man I am negotiating with â
whom I want to father the enterprise. I
have been corresponding with him for
months about it.'
"Upon that Hearst became more inter
ested, and when he returned to San Fran
cisco came to see me about it. He wanted
to know what the enterprise would cost.
Gilder nad figured it out at $25,000. I told
him if he had any such notions he had
better drop it, for that figure would fall
very short of it. He also said that Gilder
had calculated upon my going with the
expedition and remaining with it for some
time at least. I told him that would be
preposterous. The expedition must be com
posed of young hardy men full of ambition,
who would remain in that legion long
enough to accomplish the purpose â from
one to three years.
"I am not prepared to say just what my
present plans are," said the professor, "but
I shall bring this matter before the Geo
graphical Society, perhaps to-morrow, and
at any rate just as soon as I get the infor
mation I require.
"The party would go by ship to some
point northwest on Hudsons Bay, and
thence northwest over the ice and snow to
Franklins Bay. They would be equipped
to remain out at least two years. The
leader would have to be an all-round man,
well grounded in scientific knowledge, who
could turn doctor or surgeon upon occa
sion, and physically equal to the rigors of
the climate. No, I cannot say that I have
that man singled out. However, it would
not be diflicult to find him, I think."
The Engraving Took Two Tears.
Representative White of Illinois wears
on his little ringer of the left hand a seal
ring whose historical interest far surpasses
the intrinsic value of tne jewel, although
it is probably the finest intaglio in Wash
ington. It is a plain, unostentatious hya
cinth, bearing the classic head of Antoni
nus Pius, ruler of Rome from 138 to 161,
and was cut and worn by the great Roman
philosopher and Emperor 1700 years ago.
Mr. White secured it during his sojourn in
Italy, paying .'WOO francs for it, or about
$600 in American money. It had a Roman
setting of great antiquity. Mr. White
took the ring to Tiffany's, in Paris, and
ordered the stone to be set in a plain gold
band. The great jewelry firm specified that
it would do ho only at the owner's risk, on
account of the incalculable value of the
stone. The head is engraved in a pure
hyacinth, which, when held to the light,
is* perfectly translucent, and gives out a
remarkable play of colors. The engraving
is perfect, and leading lapidaries have as
sured Mr. White that it required two years
to complete the head in its perfected de
tails. â Washington Post.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, 31 ARCH 5, J896.
UNDER FLORAL CANOPIES
Brilliant Church Wedding and
Fashionable Ceremony at
â¢ Union Hall.
WHITBECK-NETTLE NUPTIALS.
Philomath Tea Thursday for Frederick
Wardeâ The Kahn Luncheon.
Personals.
The new Bush-street Temple was the
scene of a brilliant wedding yesterday,
the contracting parties being Miss SeJma
Altmeyer, daughter of Abraham Alt
meyer, president of the Bush-street Tem
ple congregation, and Joseph M. Jacobi.
This was the first marrlaee solemnized in
the new temple, and the synagogue in
honor of the occasion was handsomely
d9corated with flowers. In the vestibule
paims and rubber-trees lined the walls.
Cordons of smilax twined the chandelier
and festooned the gallery rail. But it was
the altar that occupied principally the at
tention of the decorator. Ferns, brakes
and quantities of gelder-rose formed a
solid bank, in the midst of which was
erected a canopy of callas, from the
four corners of wnich hung graceful white
satin true-lover knots. It was under this
canopy that the sacred red satin chupa
was placed, and here the happy young
couple stood while the Rev. Dr. Julius
Fryer read the impressive Jewish cere
mony.
Long before 5 o'clock, the hour an-
MR. AND MRS. S. KAtFMANN (NEE WASSERMAN),
[From photographs. ]
nounced for the ceremony, the pretty little
church was crowded with a fashionable as
semblage, which testitied to the high es
teem in which the contracting parties are
held by their numerous friends.
While the audience was being seated tho
choir, under the direction of trie organist,
Professor F. DelleDiane, rendered several
choice selections, prominent among them
being Mrs. Eva Tenney's solo, "Call Mo
Thine Own."
To the strains of the bridal chorus from
"Lohengrin" the bridal party entered.
First came the ushers, S. H. Selling, Moses
Bernheim, Louis Bernheim, Samuel Sell
ing and Louis Sheeline. Following the
ushers and preceding the bride, who en
tered leaning on toe arm of her father,
walked tue maid of honor, Miss Cora Alt-
meyer.
Mrs. Altmeyer, mother of the bride, en
tered on the arm of the groom, and Alex
ander Jacobi, the best man, led the
groom's mother.
Tlie ceremony, the orthodox Jewish, was
impressive in "the extreme. Bride and
groom exchanged rings and drank from
the wine cup, symbolic of prosperity and
health. â¢
At the conclusion of the ceremony congratu
lations) were In order and then the bridal party
and invited guests were driven to the resi
dence of the pride's parents on Turk street,
where a reception wes held.
The bride, a charmiug, petite demi-blonde,
was attired in a handsome white satin gown,
en train. The corsage was made in the pic
turesque Directolie fashion and finished off
with a rare piece of duchesse lace.
Miss Cora Altmeyer, the maid of honor, wore
a modish gown of pink crepe and chiffon.
There is a pretty little superstitiou connected
with the first marriage solemnized in a new
temple of worship, by which the young couple
are promised all that mortals value most and
hold most dear.
The friends of Mr. and Mrs. Jacobi declare
that for once superstitions predicted shall not
fail, but will be carried out to the letter.
Miss Bertie Wasserinan and Sig Kaufmann,
general manager of the Rosenthal Shoe Com
pany, were married last evening at U:3O
o'clock, in the presence at about seventy-five
friends and relatives, at Union-square Hall.
Rev. Dr. Voorsanger performed the cere
mony, the happy young couple standing under
a floral canopy studded with white rosebuds.
The bride was attended by Miss Alice Frank,
who officiated as maid of honor, and Miss
Helen Alexander, Miss Carrie Mininger, Miss
Rose Levy and MUtb Lottie Newberg were the
bridesmaids.
I. Kaufmann. brother of the groom, was best
man, and Dave Wassernian, Moses Kaufmann,
Adolf Kaufmann and Dan Marx acted as
groomsmen.
Little Miss Alma Hoffman, followed by Mas
ters Frank and Leopold Oppenheimer, led the
bridal procession, carrying baskets of fragrant
blossoms.
The bride, a petite and dainty lady with deep
brown eyes an<i hair the color Titian loved to
paint, was attired in a magnificent gown of
cream-white uuehesse satin. The skirt was
made perfectly plain, en train, and the
slightly decorated corsage was elaborately
trimmed with duchesse lace. A bridal veil,
fastened to the coiffure by a wreath of orange
blossoms, completed the handsome costume.
Miss Frank, the maid of honor.wore a modish
gown of white satin trimmed with chiffon.
The bridesmaids were attired alike in yellow
satin, with the exception of Miss Newberg,
who wore a pink gown. After the ceremony
there were congratulations and an elaborate
banquet, followed by dancing.
Mr. and Mrs. Kaufmaun left this morning for
a southern bridal tour and on their return will
occupy the residence at 1728 Sutter street.
The young couple received many costly and
handsome presents that included silverwere,
bric-a-brac and quantities of cut glass.
In the parlors of the bride's residence, 324
Golden uate avenue, at noon last Sunday,
Harry Yale Witbeck and Miss Reine Nettle
were married in the presence of a few friends.
The groom is the only son of John Henry Wit
beck, the highly esteemed capitalist and
banker of Chicago. Tne bride is the daughter
of Mrs. H. W. Bloom and stepdaughter of H. W.
Bloom, the well-known representative of the
New York Life Insurance Company. The maid
of honor was Miss Gertrude Spellan and the
bridesmaids the Misses Rose and Dorothy
Bloom. Raymond Linscott officiated as test
man. The ceremony was performed by the
Rev. Dr. Spaulding, rector of St. John's Episco
pal Church. An elaborate breakfast followed
tit Delmonico's, after which Mr. and Mrs. Wit
beck left for an extended trip south. Before
returning they will visit the home of the
groom in Cnicago; also the bride's graud
father, Richard Nettle, a retired naval officer
and now holding a high official position in Ot
tawa, Canada. The best of wishes of a host of
friends go with them.
Mrs. Sig Stern will give a dinner this evening
at her residence, corner of Washington and
Buchanan streets, complimentary to Mrs.J.
Stern, who leaves the latter part of this month
for an extended European visit.
The youne ladies of the Philomath will give
a tea to-morrow at 3 o'clock at their rooms in
the Y. M. C. A. building complimentary to
Frederick Warde. There is to be a literary and
musical programme by the ladies of the club
and the eminent actor will also deliver a brief
ail'lress.
On Tuesday Mrs. Joseph Kahn gave an elab
orate luncheon at her home on Geary street.

effect to decorate the table. Among the guests
were: Mrs. J. Stern, Mrs. A. Stern, Mrs. S. Stern,
Mrs. L. Hchwabacher, Mrs. H. Wangenheim,
Mrs. L. Michaels, Mrs. L. Bachman, Mrs. H.
Solomon. Mrs. Brown, Mrs. M. Rothschild, Mrs.

their daughter Edith. The eveniug was very
pleasantly spent iritb games, music and danc
ing, ufterwhieh the guests retired to the din
ing-room, which was tastefully decorated in
red and yellow and where a delightful repast
whs served. Among those present were: Wil
liam Case, Miss Maud Case, the Misses D. and R.

Giant," was given at the Mission Turn
Verein Hall Tuesday evening. The occa-
Bion was in the nature of a testimonial to
Mrs. Samuel Deal Jr. (formerly Miss Lola
Lewis.) The interpretation of the piece
was excellently well handled by all the
participants, especially the part of the
leading lady, which was intrusted to Miss
Edith Lawrence. This was the first pub
lic appearance of Miss Lawrence and her
able rendition of the difficult part was a
most pleasing surprise to her many friends
and admirers.
AGAIN ON TRIAL.
The ivionv Charge AgajnÂ»t R. 11. Mc-
Donald Jr. Before Judge Bahrx.
R. H McDonald Jr. came once more be
fore Judge Bahrs yesterday. He is on trial
this time for felony, in carrying upon the
books of the bank a check for $100,000
made by Columbus Waterhouse and con
sidered worthless.
The check waÃ deposited by Waterhouse
during the time when the bank was under
investigation by the Bank Commissioners
and it was carried on the books as cash.
The check was claimed to be worthless
and the charge was made on that theory.
Four jurors were secured during the day
and it is expected that the full panel will
be secured to-day.
ALL LOYAL TO THE FLAG
Officers of the Salvation Army
Renew Their Alle
giance.
WORD SENT TO THE GENERAL.
Manifesto of the International Chief
of Staff to All the Soldiers
of the Army.
At the monthly meeting of the officers
of the Salvation Army, held yesterday at
'White Wings," 711 Mission street, it was
formally resolved to "stand by the General
and the flair."
Brigadier Keppel addressed the officers
at the morning session, and found there
was but one sentiment among them â tbat
was loyalty to the army and its head.
The brigadier, immediately upon the
noon adjournment, dispatched a telegram
to Commissioner Eva Booth at New York
advising her of the sentiment of loyally
expressed by the officers of the Pacific
Coast chief division.
Later the following letter was prepared
and read to the officers and indorsed by
them. There were about ninety officers
present. The letter reads:
General William Booth, International Head
quarters Salvation Arviy. London, Jing.âliE
loved General: The officers of the Pacific
Coast Chief Division of the Salvation Army, in
council assembled in San Francisco, on this
4th day of March, 189t>, wish me to forward
you this letter, which they have unanimously
and enthusiastically indorsed.
We, in some measure, understanding the
great sorrow wniuh lias befallen you (as tlie
father of our late beloved leaders, Commander
and Mrs. Ballington Booth) do hereby wish to
express to you our sincere sympathy" and beg
to assure you that while your loss is the greater,
we too feel that our loss* is very great. On the
other hand, we believe that your greatest sor
row and loss will be felt as the General on be
half of the whole array and fiom an official
standpoint. In this respect you also have our
deepest sympathy^ and all we can do now in
this hour to tighten your sorrow and
strengthen your heart and" hands we are will
ing to do.
We feel persuaded that a renewal of our
pledges of love to God and the principles and
interests of the Salvation Army will be the
most cheering message we could send you.
These pledges we heartily and enthusiasti
cally give.
We are praying for you that God may sus
tain and direct you in the guidance of his
hosts of the blood and fire in this trying hour
and in the years to come. You can count on
us to stand by the flag of the worldwide Salva
tion Army and the eternal principles which it
represents. I have the honor to be your hum
ble and faithful representative,
James J. Keppel, Brigadier.
The following manifesto from W. Bram
well Booth, cabled from London under
date of February 23. appears in the War
Cry just from the press and dated Satur
day next. It gives General Booth's views
upon the defection:
GOD LIVES AND THE FLAG WAVES.
MANIFESTO BY THE INTERNATIONAL CHIEF
OF STAFF TO THE OFFICERS, SOLDIERS, RE
CRUITS, FRIENDS AND SYMPATHIZERS OF
THE SALVATION ARMY IN THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
By cable from the International Headquarters,
London, February 2S, IS'jO.
My Dear Comrades: A great calamity has
fallen upon you and a great sorrow upon the.
army everywhere, Your late beloved and hon
ored commanders have refused to obey the
general's orders and have resigned, and an
attempt is now being made to repeat the dis
grace of the Moore infamy. In the name of
the general and of your comrades everywhere
I desire to express the sympathy felt with you
in this hour of dark storm and trial. The
farewell orders to our territorial commanders
were issued to all alike. The army is one; its
discipline is one; the general would violate
every principle of common justice if he made
exceptions in such cases, especially exceptions
of his own family. He will not do so, and I
believe you will praise God for his wisdom
and fearless devotion to the interests of Christ's
kingdom in this great trial.
Every honest citizen of America will under
stand "the real motives of men who use her
name to serve their own ends in the promotion
of disunion; and who would represent you to
the American soldiers, to the army and to the
world as being capable of unfaithfulness to
Sledges solemnly given in God's name and of
isloyalty to comrades with whom you have
marched for years in the fellowship of the
Holy Ghost for the salvation of the lost. Such
men are traitors to the honor of their country
and traducers of your love. I have not so
judged you. In this day of stern trial I call
upon you to gtand fast to God and to the
wcrld-wiae purpose of the army and to the
flag.
Be ready to suffer for the principles you have
espoused and remember the cry of the people
who know not God. Remember that he has
made of one blood all the nations of the
earth ; that he has redeemed them by onegreat
sacrifice; that our mission is to unite them
in one great fold and under the one Sheperd.
To this high and glorious purpose consecrate
yourselves in this time of storm and nothing
but God's cross shall be able to move you in
the emergency which has suddenly arisen.
I have appointed Commissioner E.va Booth
to take command pending the appointment of
new territorial leaders; and claim for my sis
ter from every one of you the fullest confi
dence in circumstances of extreme difficulty.
She is a veteran in the service of God, but she
is also a woman whose heart is deeply wounded
by the great blow which has fallen upon us
all. Your love and prayers will sustain her.
Have faith in God. Pray without ceasing.
Rejoice evermore. Fear nothing. Save the
lost. Abound in hopeâ and faithful in tribula
tion and faithful to Calvary, you will conquer
every foe. Your comrade forever,
W. Bkamwell Booth,
International Chief of Staff.
Major William Halpin, Western editor
of the War Cry, said yesterday: "I think
the worst is over now. It is possible that
after a time Mr. and Mrs. Booth may get
to work at something and gain a following
and create some breach in the army, but
there is no sign of any break now. Still I
do not think they would care to gather
about them recruits of the disaffected and
disappointed. I am very much surprised
at their action. It is only a short time
since Mrs. Booth was here and she spoke
as earnestly and eloquently of loyalty to
the flag as ever she did. I think there is
some little famil} trouble back of it all
which we know nothing about. But as
has been said, the army is greater than
the Booths or any family. It must not be
dismembered."
The Parrot Gave Lessons, Too.
"A man, whose name I have forgotten,
told me tnis parrot story the other day on
the train between Topeka and Salina. His
niece had coaxed him to buy her a parrot,
and he had purchased a bird that the
dealer had warranted to be a good talker.
Ho took it home, and standing before its
cage said: 'Say uncle, Polly.' The bird
perched and sat and done nothing more.
Tims and again he told it to say 'uncle,'
but it never moved its head. Finally the
man grew exasperated, and opening the
cage door grabed the bird by the neck and
ehook it until its head wobbled around, all
the time yelling to it, 'Say uncle, goll darn
you! Say uncle!' The bird looked limp
and lifeless, and disgusted with his pur
chase he took it out into the yard, where
he had a coop of thirty fine chickens.
Thrusting the half-dead bird in with
the chickens he exclaimed, 'There, by
gosh ! You'll say uncle before you get
out!' Next morning he went out to see
bow the parrot was getting on. Looking
into the coop he counted twenty-nine dead
chickens, and in the center of the coop
stood the parrot on one foot holding the
thirtieth chicken by the neck, shaking it
till its head wobbled and screaming: 'Say
uncle. gol darn yer, say uncle!' "âKansas
City Journal.
The Bulgarians love music. They sing
a great deal, not only at entertainments,
but also at their work in the house and in
the fields, especially during harvest. The
shepherds, or the reapers on the opposite
heights, often sing in alternation, stanza
by stanza.

WONDERS OF A
LEPER REMEDY.
The Japanese Medicine Has
Worked Strange
Cures.
-V7ILL BE TESTED HERE.
An Unknown Quantity to Medi
cal Science, but Very
Effective.
DISCUSSED BY DR. G. I. FITCH.
In the Interests of Suffering Human
ity It Should Be Studied
and Used.
It now seems reasonably certain that
the Japanese remedy for leprosy is about
to be applied to lepers in the Twenty
sixth street hospital in this City. There
may of course be some delay consequent
upon securing the full amount needed for
purchasing the medicine and getting it
from Japan, but Supervisor Benjamin, who
nas undertaken to collect the money, re
asserts his conviction that he will be ablÂ»
to provide at least enough of the remedy
within a few months to try it here.
Physicians who have been consulted
about it declared they would like to see it
tested, although strictly speaking it is un-
Knownto science in its true character, and
for that reason recommendation by the
medical men might be taken as unprofes
sional. In a general way the remedy is
known as a mixture of Japanese herbs, but
they are not distinguished by botanical
names, nor [have they been classified or
studied by western botanists.
So the remedy is understood more in its
effects than in its own character. And yet
the doctors say its application can do no
harm to the lepers, while it may do much
good. If nothing more, it alleviates the
intense sufferings of the lepers, and thus
gains the attention and support of physi
cians as a palliative worthy of trial in the
interests of humanity.
Some more light was cast upon this rem
edy, now familiariy known as the Goto
cure, by Dr. George L. Fitch yesterday.
Dr. Fitch was Government physician un
der King Kaiakaua in Ho.nolulu and had
supervision of the leper receiving hospital
there, and also of the leper settlement at
Molokai. He saw the Goto remedy admin
istered in Honolulu and watched its effects
closely for years.
"I nave seen it work so much good," he
said, "that I cheerfully recommend it. I
don't know the Latin terms for the herbs,
but I have the formula in Japanese terms,
and it would be an easy matter to study
the herbs and classify them at any time. I
suspect there is some arsenic in it.
â¢'.Because it is not known to science some
doctors will say its use is unprofessional,
that 8 physician should not use a remedy
he knows nothing about. But, as I've
said, I have the formula in Japanese, and
the medicine is well worth studying. It is
called 'Goto remedy' from Dr. Goto, who
was born in a leper hospital in Japan, of
which his father had charge, and his
fathers father. Indeed, the family has
been devoted to the treatment of leprosy
for many generations. Young Dr. Goto
came here to San Francisco some years
ago and took a course at the Cooper Col
lege of Medicine. He went to Honolulu
and treated lepers there, and later re
turned to his own country, where he is
now practicing among the lepers.
"I know that Dr. Goto's patients have
firoved that his remedy was quite success
ul, and while the people of Hawaii know
he has not made any brilliant cures he has
at least alleviated the sufferings of the
alHicted and so he has abated the ravages
of the disease. And, by the way, people
imagine there is no suffering with leprosy,
no real pain. That is an awful mistake,
for at times the suffering is frightful. For
illustration, lepers commonly have a sen
sation that some part of them is burning
up, literally being consumed as by fire,
and they have all the sensation of burning
by fire. One woman 1 saw felt that her
right arm was burning up, and she held it
in a bucket of water for three weeks, and
she would cry out against the horrible
burning pain. A man alHicted with the
disease laid for three months exposed to
the trade winds of the islands to cool him
self, and those winds are fearfully cold to
the natives. His only relief was in opium.
'â¢I have seen several cases where leprosy
disappeared and to all appearances the
sufferers got well under the Goto treat
ment.''
"Then you would favor trying it here on
the City lepers?"
â I should certainly advise it. Get it by
subscription if not any other way. I
would do anything and everything pos
sible to help those poor creatures. Surely
a few hundred dollars is not much to
expend in the cause of suffering human
ity. About $500 would be enough to buy
the remedy to treat all the patients out
there in the Pesthouse. An apparatus for
boiling the herbs and applying the rem
edy would have to be constructed. The
herbs are boiled into a strong tea, will I
call it? or a decoction, and then the pa
tient is put into the decoction, which is
almost boiled, alone with him, and he is
steeped in it for a considerable time. In
addition to this he is given pills, aud that
is practically all there is to it."
Supervisor Benjamin hopes to be out
again in a few days and then- he proposes
to make a collection with which to buy the
Goto medicine.
LECTURED ON THE RAY
Professor Slate's Discourse at
the State University
Last Night.
The Field That Is Open to Science and
the Possibilities in
Store.
BERKELEY. Cal.. March 4.- Professor
Frederick Slate, head of the department
of physics at the University of California,
lectured last night before the Science Asso
ciation on "The Line of Investigation
Which has Resulted in Professor Roent
gen's Discovery."
The lecture was for the most part of a
very technical nature and was illustrated
by the use of various electrical instru
ments, which were intended to show the
several stages trough which experiments
passed prior to the discovery by Professor
Roentgen of thecathode-rliy photography.
Professor Slate began his lecture by mak
ing a few general statements with regard
to the popular interost in the X-ray ex
periments and tne interest manifested by
physicists and scientists in general.
He pointed out the enormous field open
alcng the line of the new discovery and
the many possibilities which are in store.
Ho showed by a series of experiments the
stages through which the exp< -imenter
passes in arriving at different stages of
fluorescence and intensity of vacuum.
A tube was shown in which a vacuum
was formed by a Geissler pump. In this
the gas was greatly rarified. The phe
nomenon of beautifully colored lights, as
the electricity passed through the ranhed
gas, was slioVn. In 187S Crooke perfected
a tube, in which there was aimost a per
fect vacuum. A Geissler tube was exhib
ited, which showed a different character of
light from that cast through the Crookes
tube. Professor Slate stated that almost
all of the vitally important results of
Roentgen have been in print for the past
two years.
About two years ago Professor Leonard
wrote an article for scientific publication,
in which he traced the cathode rays from
their origin in the Crookes tube out into
space. The startling discovery of Roentgen
was not anticipated, however.
While these shadow photographs are in
teresting and novel and have a certain
surgical importance, their interest to the
scientist is not with the photography, but
with the things which work up to it. The
X rays are not cathode rays. The X rays
do not do what they are reasonably ex
pected to do. The name cathode ray is ap
plied to a ray in a tube. Professor Slate
said that cathode rays had four distinctive
peculiarities:
Firstâ Radiation when passing from air
to waler does not measurably change its
speed.
Secondâ When these new rays strike
upon a surface they are not noticeably re
flectedâthey are neither reflected nor re
fracted.
Thirdâ All ordinary light can be polar
ized. New kinds of rays have resisted all
attempts to polarize them by any of the
previously used methods.
Consideration was made of the absorp
tion of these rays. In X rays specific
gravity seems to be all that is cared for.
Theseare the things which interest phys
icists rather than the shadow photo
graphs.
'â¢It is possible to tafce shadowgraphs,"
said Professor Slate, "through hard rub
ber, such as we cave demonstrated at our
laboratories in Berkeley."
The objects which interest students of
physics are to see what X rays have nega
tive properties and to study the light after
it has gone out of the Crookes tube.
It is probable that X rays will throw
some light on the proolem of light and
the connection between ordinary matter
and ether. We nave had some knowledge
of fluorescence for a long time.
After the conclusion of the lecture by
Professor Slate Instructor Drew of the
physics department threw a number of
stereopticon views of objects photographed
by the cathode process on the wall.
FUN FOR BISKERS TO-NIGHT
The Big Indoor Cycling Tourna
ment to Open at the
Mechanics' Pavilion.
Professionals Terrill and Osen, An
nouncer Knapp and the Great
Sextuplet Are Here.
The indoor bicycle racing tournament
and show opens to-niebt at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, and from all indications will be a
great success.
When the eight-lap track was finished
last Sunday afternoon, it was pronounced
by all the riders who tried it as being the
finest indoor track they had ever ridden
upon. It is well banked, fast and in all re
spects safe, the only drawbacks being two
heavy posts at the east and west ends,
which some thought might be a trifle too
close for comfort for the rider who had
the inside position in a race.
That the racers might have no complaint
whatever, and to insure their absolute
safety and to have a perfect track. Manager
Wikidel attended a meeting of the di
rectors of the Mechanics' Institute Tues
day evening and offered to pay the entire
cost of removing the posts and placing in
their stead two arches to support that por
tion of the gailery. Alter considerable dis
cussion it was decided to permit him to do
this, and last night a large force of carpen
ters were at work making the necessary
changes.
The experienced riders say the track is
the fastest indoor course they have ever
raced upon, aud it will be no great sur
prise ii many of the existing records are
lowered during the tournament.
The training quarters for the racers are
at the Polk-street end of the building,
where each club has commodious quarters
and the men can rest in comfort between
heats of races.
The ten-mile club cup race, the first
heat of which will be run off to-night, is
exciting the greatest interest and rivalry
among the clubmen, and two fast riders
from each club are being specially trained
for it.
A large number of regulars from the
Presidio were at the track last night, as
they are greatly interested in the military
relay race to be run next Monday night
between infantrymen and cavalrymen, ten
men on each side, for a valuable prize.
One of the most interesting features of
the cycle show will be the celebrated Fow
ler sextuplet, which arrived here yesterday
from the East and will be used on the
track and shown in one of the exhibits.
The wheel which Champion Zimmerman
rode in Australia and France last year v/ill
also be suown.
The management will give away a
bicycle every night as a gate prize.'and
there is such a large and varied number
of them, the fortunate winner can have his
or her pick as to make and style.
Oscar Osen of the Olympic cyclers, the
fast professional, arrived from Santa Mon
ica yesterday, and tried the Pavilion track
last night. He exhibited remarkable
speed and passed lots of the men as though
they were standing still. He said that J.
M. Campbell, the champion of Oregon,
who was also at Santa Monica, will reach
here to-morrow for the tournament.
Probably the most Interest in the new
arrivals centered in W. A. Terrill of the
Bay City Wheelmen, who came in on a
late train from Coronado, where he has
been all winter trying for records. Ternll
marKed the last day of his stay there by
lowering the world's half-miie tandem
record to 52 3-5 seconds in conjunction
with W. A. Taylor.
Terrill, Campbell and Osen are all crack
protessional riders, and tbe management
of tbe tournament will arrange special
events for them and other '"pro's." to give
the public a chance to see them compete.
Terrill weighs 100 pounds and is in perfect
condition.
Charles S. Wells, the Bay City's 1.00
--poimd champion, has made the best time
on the track thus far, riding a lap at a
gait which would have meant a mile in
1:45 had he kept it up. This will give
some idea of how fast the track really is.
W. Fred Knapp, the "only" announcer,
without whom no coast race meeting is
complete, returned yesterday from Port
land especially for the tournament. Knapp
has officiated as announcer sinco rcben the
mind of man remembers not â certainly
ever since bicycle races were held in Cali
fornia. Before that he was the profes
sional world's champion when the mile
record stood at 2:34,. and he even now
claims to hold records which "stand still."
Be this as it may, Knapp is a feature of pl
cycle meets, and" his jolly ways and catchy
say mirs have made him friends everywhere.
Members of the League of American
Wheelmen will be admitted to the races at
half price upon presentation of tbeir mem
bership cards.
The one-mile race to be run to-night
will be a great event, as the entries repre
sent ttie fastest men of the coast. The
other races are also well chosen, and as all
the prizes are valuable and the track is
safe the men will have every incentive to
ride their best. From the advance sale of
seats an immense crowd is assured.

went to the post a slight favorite over the
Burns & Waterhouse duo Candelaria and
Rowena B, who receded in the betting
from 6 to 5 to 2to L The winner turned np
in the Martenhurst gelding Greyhurst,
who gradually forged ahead of Candelaria,
Alma Dale and Lindendale and won com
paratively easy at the end by three
lengths, with Candelaria in the place
about the same distance in front of the
favorite.
The winner, woo went to the post at i%
to 1 in the bettine, covered the four
and a half furlongs in :57 flat, a very good
performance. When the oarrier was raised
Rowena B, who sported silk for the first
time, jumped backward, dislodging her
rider, Donnelly, from his seat, and ran the
reverse way of the track.
There were no striking features about
the racing. Favorites were successful in
three out of six essays.
The Lone siable'*s Circe was made a
warm 6 to 5 favorite for the opening six
furlong dash, but was unable tc head the
field at any stage of the journey. Hy Dy,
the 2% to 'l second choice, won by a scant
head in a arive from Sleeping Child, who
slumbered nor at 12 to 1.
Louis Ezell's Kamsin was a 1 to 4 shot
for the mile selling event for three-year
olds and won by himself, with Pearson in
the place and Senator Hoffman a distant
third.
The steeplechase was run over the me
dium course, about a mile and three-quar
ters. Cicero ruled a 7to 5 favorite, with
Talbot Clifton's gelding, The Lark, a warm
second choice at Bto 5. "Mi Lud's 'orse"
should have made a closer thing of it, but
when racing into the stretch on nearly
equal terms with Cicero, T. Murphy turned
wide, giving the rail to the favorite and
Â»ras beaten out quite handily. Mestor,
who galloped all the way, was third.
That H. Martin mistook his vocation*
wben he decided to become a jockey is an
unmistakable fact. Nature endowed him
with a vast quantity of patience, and he
should have beeu a fisherman. He had
the mount on the 8 fo 5 favorite Oakland
in the mile and a sixteenth run over the
inside course, and in pursuance of his dili
gent waiting tactics finished second. Two
Cheers led to the stretch, when kittle
Cripple assumed the lead and in a drive
won by a length from the favorite, who
was ridden only the last sixteenth of the
journey. Possibly Oakland is not unlike
Lizz.e H, and can be placed with a Bilken
thread.
The six-furlong handicap was a gift for
George Miller. The "Kansas City Hin
doo" went to the post a 9 to 20 favorite,
and won under wraps from Benham.
There weie but four starters.
Traok and Paddock Items.
A number of thoroughbreds, the proper
ty of different owners, were sold by Killip
& Co. at the Bay District track yesterday.
Addie M went for $100 and Gussie for
$480. Both were formerly raced by Wil
liams & Morehouse and were purchased
by J. W. Clark. J. P. Woolman disposed
of Emma D and Miss Gentry. The former
was knocked down to C. W. Richard for
$1000, and the flying Miss Gentry went to
W. L. Stan field for $600. "Butch" Fisher
got Leon L, at one time a promising colt,
for $150 and Mi, Roy was secured by J.
Kruse for $140. Rico, Happy Day and
Corinne Buckingham went for a song.
LADIE8 1 DAY AT INQLEBIDE.
Seven Well-Filled Events for the Opening
Day at the Popular Course.
Ingleside track will reopen to-day
with an excellent card of seven
well-filled events. As on former occa
sions, it will also be "ladies' day," and
extra cars will be run by the railroad
company for the accommodation of the
fair sex. The track, considered the finest
in the country for winter racing, will be in
good condition, and with the rine class of
horses entered no doubt a big tnrong will
be in attendance at the popular course.
THE THISTLE GAMES.
They Will Take Place at Shfell Hound
Park, July 4.
The games committee of the San Fran
cisco Scottish Thistle Club met for the
first time last evening at the clubrooms,
32 O'Farrell street. The meeting was
called to order at 8 p. m. by Royal Chief J.
D. Coulie, and the committee immediately
proceeded to effect a permanent organiza
tion. J. D. Coulie was selected as chair
man, George W. Paterson as secretary, and
John Ross as treasurer. Shell Mound
Park. Berkeley, was fixed as the place for
holding the next srrand annual gathering
and games, and Saturday, July 4, 1396, as
the date. Resolutions pertaining to the
manner of conducting the annual gather
ing were proposed and adopted. It was
the sense of the meeting that many new
features be introduced in the programme
of events, and an effort be made to secure
the presence at the gathering of represen
tatives of every organization in the City
and neighboring towns. Much other
routine business was transacted. Before
aujourning the royal chief announced the
following as his appointments on the
various sub-committees:
Advertising committeeâ John Rosa (chair
man), P. Keith, George \V. Paterson.
Invitation committeeâ J. D. Coulle (chair
man), J. Gillies, William Dick.
Printing committeeâ George W. Paterson
(chairman), Alex Sharp, John Ross.
Music committeeâ Hugn Steele (chairman),
Alex Young, J. D. Coulle.
Prize committeeâ Alex Sharp (chairman), J.
Gillies, J. 1). CouJie.
Finance committeeâ P. Keith (chairman),
Alex Young, H. Steele.
The meeting then adjourned, subject to
the call of the royal chief.
To provide troops for Cuba, .Spain is
stated to be making raids on the Canary
Islands, seizing all the men that can be
found. When a steamer appears in sight
now the inhabitants make for the hills,
and few young men are to be seen in the
towns.

According to the present outlook there

Leonard Gill, captain of the Olympic
Club, said yesterday that considerable in
terest will be manifested by athletes and
the lovers of athletic sports in field and
track this year. Men are already at work
repairing and fixing up the running paths
at the Olympic outdoor grounds under the
watchful eye of Superintendent Mclniyre,
an old athlete, who thoroughly under
stands the kind of work that is deemed
necessary to complete a proper sprinting
track. A large fence will be erected on the
south Bide of the grounds go as to prevent
sand or refuse matter from the hills sweep
ing over the cinder paths. It is thought
that the grounds will be ready for the ath
letes who are anxious to commence train
ing by the latter part of this month.
Captain Gill says that impromptu games
will be held just as soon as the cinder
paths are in condition to receive spikes,
and that practice for the championship
games will commence immediately follow
ing the opening day. There are quite a
number of athletes among the members of
the club, who are patiently waiting for an
opportunity to limber up after a rest of
many months.
Captain Gill is of the opinion that he
can pick from among the new members
who joined within the past tweive months
some excellent material. He is confident
that if the directors will give him a help
ing hand be will have ready a team of all
round athletes which will make an ex
cellent itand against the university teams
in the championship contests.
"I understand," said Captain Gill, "that
the University of California do hot pro
pose to send a team to the East this year;
but there may be, nevertheless, a team
selected from the different clubs of the
Pacific Athletic Association to represent
California in the Eastern championships.
The officers of the association believe that
if a team composed of twenty-six first-class
all round athletes journeyed* East and con
tested at some of the prominent meetings
which will be held in the large Eastern
cities under the auspices of the American
Athletic Union, the result, would be very
material to this coast, as the patrons of
clean sports would assuredly manifest a
stirring interest in outdoor athletics.
'â¢As captain of the Olympic Club I will
certainly do all in my power to revive the
fading interest in what should be a very
popular pastime on this Coast and that is
outdoor athletics.
"Immediately following the champion
ship games a team will be selected from
the clubs of the association to visit Port
land, Seattie, liutte City, and other large
cities of the Northwest. If the trip
shall prove successful financially, the
athletes will journey East over the North
ern route and then the people of California
will be in a position to judge what our
athletes are capable of doing when pitted
against the cracks of the Eastern cities.
"The team that represented the university
of Berkeley last year in Eastern games
was composed entirely of students from
Berkeley, and, as will be remembered by
all lovers of sport, it won- many victories
and added much toward increasing an
interest in college sports on tfciis coast. I
think that a team selected from the Pacific
Association should make a grand showing
against the best material the Eastern
clubs of note qan produce in field and
track competitions. I hope that the
scheme now contemplated will prove suc
cessful and that California will be repre
sented this year at the Eastern champion
ships."

ABOUT IRELAND.
His Brilliant Address at
Metropolitan Hall Last
Night.
THE CHICAGO OBATOR.
What Ireland Has Achieved in
Times of War and Peace
Set Forth.
FOUGHT BRAVELY FOR LIBERTY
How the Irish Soldiers Distinguished
Themselves on the Field
of Battle.
John F. Finerty of Chicago was the
orator of the celebration of the one Hun
dred and eighteenth anniversary of the
birth of Robert Eramet at Metropolitan
Hall last night. The great auditorium was
packed with the American friends of Ire
land and the eloquent and distinguished
Cnicagoan was civen an ovation such as
few visitors to San Francisco have ever re
ceived.
Mr. Finerty has gained prominence as a
journalist, orator, soldier and statesman,
and his corvine to this City was made the
occasion of a great demonstration in favor
of the national independence of Ireland*
Hmilar demonstrations n-ere held through
out the country yesterday, as Emmet's
birthday has come to be regarded as a day
of national importance by Irish-born citi
zens the world over.
The hall was beautifully decorated with
the colors nf the United States and Ire
land. Gas jets in the form of a harp aided
in making an effective background.
Among tho prominent citizens of Irish
birth and extraction present were the fol
lowing :
J. J. (VBrien, Thomas Ã. Bannerman, Thomas
Crowley, Father Ferguson, J. J.Dwyer. Colonel
O Byrne, Senator Mahoney, Judee Campbell,

J. J. O'Brien, in introducine Hon. M.
M. Estee as the chairman of the evening,
< ;) ;d:
The organizetion under whose auspices we
met ro-nieht to perpetuate the paemory
<â " Robert Emmet has selected as its chairman
a man whose name it is hardly necessary for
me to mention. He is known from one end of
the btate to the other, and he is well and
iavorably known. He is a friend, and has &1
--n aya been a friend and a consistent friend of
the Irish people.
Mr. Estee was received with great cheer
ing. He said :
You can hear me any time, but you cannot
always hear our distinguished friend, who has
come here to help to commemorate tne dust of j
. an illustrious Irishman, an Irishman who died j
that liberty might live. Freedom knows no
y no nationality, and we are here to
night to recall the memory of Â»n Irishman
Â» ed and perished for his country.
This sentiment was loudly applauded.
M'rne. Eilen Coursen Roeckel then sans
tar-spangled Banner" in a manner
: bat elicited the applause of the audience.
For an encore she sang "Love's Young
I 'ream." "Emmet's Last Words" was
next sung by G. V. Wood. He was
obliged to respond to an encore.
Miss Mary L. Kimbaii gave some selec
tions on the* harp and D. Manlloyd sang
" fhe Minstrel Boy." Colonel John
O'Byrne then read the following seif
expianatory Jetter:
San Francisco, Cal., -March 3, 1896.
My Dfa.T Judge Coontyâl am very thankful
fr>r the kind invitation to attend the exercises
of the celebration of the anniversary of Robert
Emmet's birthday. Unfortunately I am
obliged to remain in the house on account oi a
severe cold. Wishing the celebration every
success I remain, yours, truly,
P. J. RIOBDANj |
Chairman Estee then introduced Colonel
Finerty, who, attired in evening dreÂ«s,
stepped to the front of the platform, while
the audience applauded rapturously. He
spoke for two hours. In the course of his
address he said :
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: The
object oi our coming here to-night has been
announced, and the story of the
tragedy of .Robert Km met, much as it involves,
i.Â« but a passage of Irish history. In order to
properly understand that history and what led
â¢â¢ > the sacrifice of Emmet, it will be necessary
f '>r me to go Lack a few centuries, at least, in
order to place before the American people the
circumstances that have surrounded the more
recent nistory of Ireland.
Time will "not permit me to begin with the
leginningâ the first settlement of the country,
the conquest of the Druids, the invasions of
the Danes and others and the conquest of the
Normans in 1169, brought about by the cor
ruption and treason of a bad Irishman. I can
only come down to that portion of her history
with which the people of the modern world
are more or less familiar.
rie then dealt briefly with the reign of
Henry VIII of England, adverlins to the
fact that he was the first foreign ruler the
Irish had acknowledged, adding: "They
have always believec*-and still believe that
God created Irisu men to be the equals of
ail other men, and to enjoy all the bless
ings of liberty.* 1 fÃeferrine to Henry VIII.
he. ?aid he was not recognized as a great
warrior nor as a great statesman. "One
characteristic," he continued, "that more
than any other endeared him to the Eng
lish people, was that he Joyed every other
man s wife better than his own." This
monarch's Fix marriages were reviewed,
and his fickleness and cruelty to his
f=l>O'.ises were dwelt upon at some length.
Speaking of Henry's last matrimonial
alliance the orator dryly remarked:
He would have probably destroyed all the
marriagable womc of England it he had not
run across a widow who had twice before been
married. Catherine Parr, however, had had
home experience with bad husbands and she
Fettled Henry. He only lived a year after that,
and Koon after she married again, so we had
ten marriages in one family.
Henry VIII tried to bring Ireland into sub
jection, made war on her people and succeeded
In almost wiping them from the face of the
earth.
Edward VI succeeded him, but leit no im
press on history. When he died with con
sumption he was followed by Catherine of
Aragon, lovingly called "Bloody Mary" by the
English. She was a fierce Catholic, and went
about persecuting the Protestants with great
violence. One of the most honorable pages
in the history of Ireland is the lact
that when Catherine drove the Protestants
from England to Ireland the people of Ireland
opened their Routes to them and protected
them against the cruel bigotry of the English
Catholics. I regret to have to obsetve, how
(vcr, that when the Irish received the same
kind of treatment from Ihe succeÃsorof "Bloody
Mary" they were not given the same kind of
treatment by the English.
Elizabeth wasperlmps thegreatestsovereign
intellectually, that over sat on the throne of
England. She had the faculty of attracting to
her court the best nura of her kingdom, whom
one skillfully used to carry out her projects.
She was a vehement Protestant and broke en
tirely with Rome. Three-quarters of the peo
ple of Scot:aiid followed her lead, nearly ail
of Wales anil most of England, hut she in
sisted that the Irish, too, must accept the new
doctrine, end while the Irish never sought to
impose their creed ou other people they re
fused to take up another creed at the dictation
of an English ffeRMB. Then she ordered her
general to go into Ireland; to go to the
places of worship; to massacre the congrega
tions at their prayers; 10 level the altars to
the duÂ«t, and hie the churches over the heads
of the people. And that programme was car
ried out. It was in this way the reformation
entered Ireland. For fifteen years the whole
of Ireland was engaged in resisting the power,
until the whole country was virtually burned
black. And the English general wrote his
Queen: 'You have nothing but carcasses and
ashes to rule over.' Elizabeth then remarked
in tones of great relief: 'At last these Irish are
crusned ; they will never trouble my court any
more.' "
The orator spoke of Hugh O'Neil, the
nephew of one of the chiefs of Ireland,
whose love of Ireland and wnose devotion
f n the cause of her liberty, he said, could
only be compared to that of the illustrious
patriot who died a few years agoâ Charles
Stewart Parnell. [Cheers and applause.]
He was educated in England at the sugges
tion of the Queen, so as to wean him from his
country. He feigned loyalty to England, and
Elizabeth, who always* had a weakness tot
handsome Irishmen, 'made quite a favorite of
him. O'Xeil made love to Elizabeth, which
attentions she accepted in good faith. He was
granted many privileges, and among other
thinire was allowed to raise a regiment of 800
men of his own' choice, all picked men.
Then he pot permission to return to his
palace in Ireland and to import a shipload of
lead to repair the rooi of his mansion. But he
imported about twenty shiploads, aud soon
after there wvre rumors that the women of
Ireland were casting bullets in the night. He
also reconciled atl the coutending factions,
and in June, 1595, General Morris saw the
red hand of Tyrone beckoning him to
come on.
He then reviewed all the famous battles
in whihe Irishmen had fought either in
the interests of their own country or in
in those of the monarchy and rulers who
had befriended them, winning long and
hearty applause from the ladies in the
audience while referring to the valor of
the Irish women at the first siege of Lim
erick.
Mention was made of the gratitude of
Louis XIV to the Irish, and the privilege
granted all Irishmen of becoming subjects
of France on their mere request. "There
was no A. P. A. about Louis XIV," said
Mr. Finerty in concluding hia relation of
this incident.
His description of the battle of Fontenoy
was a fine Diece of graphic portrayal,
mixed with rare eloquence, when he
came to the relation of how the Irish
Brigade of the French King saved the
day the audience burst into wild applause.
"Their best eulogium," said the speaker,
"was pronounced by the King of England
when Â«ie heard of the eveuts of that fate
ful 11th of May, 1745, and exclaimed:
"Cursed be the laws that deprive me of
such soldiers."
In the army of George Washington were
numerous Presbyterian and Catholic Irishmen
who had been driven out of their native coun
try. The Scotch-Irish were not discovered in
those days. I respect the â scotch, but I have no
use for those double-barrelled fellows. The
Irish Presbyterians were true Irish patriots.
InlÃOOtne Irish Catholics were five-sixths
of ihe popu'atiou, and yrt they were not repre
sented in the Independent Parliament of Ire
land. When the American war broke out
Grattan got his Parliament, But when it
ended that Parliament ended. Irish Catholic*
and Presbyterians organized under Wolf Tone.
Ireland has always Deen essentially Catholic,
but her leaders, from Wolf Tone to Parnell,
with the single exception of O'Connell, were
all Protestancs. Henry Flood, Thomas Addis
Emmet, Fitzgerald, and that idol of the Iristi
heart, Robert Emmet, were all of the opposite
faith. .
No Irish Catholic was ever elected from a
Protestant constituency and we have always
bepeed them to join the shamrock and the
orange to strike against England.
Kooert Emmet was not a Catholic. He was
born a Protestant, brought up among Protest
ants. He saw his brother exiled; he saw the
depression of fcis country; he was expelled
from Trinity College â briefly, his plan was to
organize a force in Dublin to take the barracks,
to storm the Castle, to run up the green flag.
I'nfonunately he was pursued by treason.
The people were with him, but he was disap
pointed by those who said they would stay
with him.
He could have escaped, bnt he loved a fair
and beautiful woman; he returned and met
Ann Devlin.
She was coerced that she might betray him,
but she said: "I don't waut your blood money,
I don't know where Robert Emmet is." The
rope was put about her neck and she was lifted
in the air, but they could not wrest the secret
from her; they could not wrest ber fidelity
from him. It "was a man who Detrayed Em
met.
Emmet never complained. At the trial he
met the tyrant Judge with the tongue of genius.
He said in those words that will ring forever
tiiat he defied the court that condemned him.
Moore has prt-servea the last speech of Emmet
in words immortal.
The orator here drew a picture of the
execution of Emmet on the 20th of
September, 1803, in Thomas street, Dublin.
'â¢If this country had failed against Eng
land,' he said in conclusion, "that country
would have treated George "Washington
the same as Emmet." The speaker con
tinued:
His epitaph may never be written, but his
epitaph is written in the hearts oi.hin country
men. His uoble life and death should incite
us to greater action. Ireland has a leader
above t..e clouds. The God of liberty never
dtserta those who fight for liberty.
Mr. Finerty closed by denouncing the
A. P. A.'s and eulogizing the Irishmen of
Catholic faith who had fought and died
for the country to which they had sworn
allegiance.
The gathering dispersed with the reading
of resolutions favoring the release of Irish
political prisoners in English dungeons
and the singing of "God Save Ireland."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
A.P. A. OFFICERS ELECTED
B. F. Hudelson Unanimously Re
elected to the Office of
State President.
AN ENTHUSIASTIC OVATION.
A Spirited Contest Over the Subordi-
Hate Positions and Delegates to
the Supreme Council.
The State Council of the American Pro
tective Association continued its session
yesterday at B'nai B'rith Hail.
Upon a rollcall of the delegates it was
voted to suspend the regular order of busi
ness and go into the election of officers.
For the office of State president B. F.
Hudelson had no opposition and was
therefore declared elected.
The election of President Â±f udelson was
the signal for an outburst of enthusiasm
seldom surpassed in a political conven
tion. Having been called upon Mr. Hudel
son expressed himself as follows:
Mr. President and Friends: There are those
times in one's life when the circumstanceSi
surroundings and emotions almost overcome
them. This is a time when I feel, perhaps, as
never before in my life. The absolute poverty
of language at my command to express my ap
preciation of what you have this day done for
meâ not in the election only, but in the in
dorsement of mv administration.
As a husband and father I love my home,
and 1 love homelife. I have felt during tho
past year that 1 have been making a sacrifice
indeed when I thought of what my loved ones
had to undergo by me being an absolute
stranger in my home, and their anxiety for my
safety; but to-day if I could place all the sacri
fices that I have made before me. I should feel
that by this indorsement of my course, I* have
been 10,000 times more than paid for all.
[Cheers.]
I promised the State Council of the Ameri
can Protective Association oive year ago, and
in making that promise to the State Council I
made a promise to the patriotic men and wo
men of California, that I should give my time,
my thought, my energy to this work if elected.
Immediately upon my selection for this posi
tion of State President I stepped out of all
other occupations and have, during the entire
year, given my whole time to this work. [Ap
plause.]
Abraham Lincoln [cheers] in giving advice
to Oglesby, approached him in
that peculiar and familiar way by which he
convinced the people whom he addressed that
he was their friend, and said: "You are a
young man and just entering into public life.
Let me give you a little political advice. Dur.
ing your entire iife keep very close to the
people."
You will find that during the entire year I
have tried to keep close to the people. [Ap
plause.] I have kept close to the masses of this
organization. The humblest man in all our
ranks has been made to feel, as I have tried to
make him feel, that I have been his friend.
[Cheers.]
The year that is now before us is the year of
our great political battle. I have only this to
promise you, that, in the name of home, in
the name of our schools, in the name of our
country and our country's flag, in the name of
Godâ turning neither to the right nor to the
leftâ l shall do my duty as I know it. [Great
applause.] In this work I am ready to give
my entire time; I am willing to give my
thoughts and my best energy, and if the time
comes, let it be "anywhere iii the mountains of
ihe north or in the orange groves of the
south, from tho mountains to the sea, if the
time comes that my blood shall mark some
spot in California where I won my crowu for
the American Protective Association, my life
will be willingly given upon its altar. [Ap
plause.] Friends, I thank you for your hearty
co-operation, and let me say to the friends
who have seen fit to express themselves as op
posed to me that they have but exercised
their right and their privilege as American
citizens, and I now can take them by the hand
as genially nÂ« ij they had not opposed me, for
B. F. Hudelson, Who Has Been Re-elected State President of the American Pro
tective Association.
[lieproduced from a photograph.]
they have taken the s&Le obligations as I, and
I shall not know throughout the coming year
who voted for me or who opposed me in this
convention. fCheers and applause.]
Three cheers were then given for the
president, the applause lasting several
minutes.
For the oiliae of vice-president G. K.
Hayes of San Bernardino carried off the
honors after a close contest with bia oppo
nent.
For the office of secretary of state J. W.
Turner of Eureka, Hurnboklt County, was
elected by a majority of live votes over one
of the most popular State officials.
D. V. Mahoney of San Jose walked away
with the honors of the chaplain's station
against two opponents.
For the office of State secretary there
were three aspirants, all strongly backed
by their ncmeroas friends, but the sterling
qualities and good work done for the order
by M. T. Brewer during the past year car
ried sufficient sympathizers with his cause
to elect him by a Â»mall majority for the
office.
The State treasurer's office vras sought
by four candidates, but after all the sec
onding speeches were made one withdrew,
leaving three in the field, and after one of
the most spirited contests of the conven
tion W. F. Barnes, late State secretary,
was elected by a majority of one vote.
During the evening the courtesy of the
platform was extended to Major Ryan,
who delivered a thirty- minute speech on
the principles of the order and the good to
be accomplished by its members in the
comine campaign.
On the conclusion of his address three
rousing cheers, with a tiger, were given
the speaker, after which an adjournment
was had until 10 o'clock this morning. i

expert witness in the trial of Dr. Hall upon a
charge of malpractice. He claimed he was
promised a fee of $200 and Justice Cook al
lowed it, but Judge Troutt cut the fee in two.
Dr. Stambaugh was a valuable witness in Hall's
favor, and he boasted that it was upon his tes

Miss Violet Carey Gave a Party on
Board the Monovrai Yesterday
Afternoon.
Miss Violet Carey, the daughter of Cap
tain Carey of the Oceanic steamship Mono

makes the big noble ship the scene of a
delightful afternoon party.
About fifty ladies and gentlemen en
joyed the day in the care of their graceful
young hostess. To-morrow the Monowai

BRETZ WAS NOT DRUNK
Justice Groezinger Declares That
He Was Perfectly
Sober.
His Actions and Statements Regard
ing the Ceremony Severely
Criticized.
The statements made by Clifford J.
Bretz, the son of the Alameda County As
semblyman, concerning his recent mar
riage to Miss Maud Itsell by Justice of the
Peace Groezinger, are indignantly denied
by all concerned in the ceremony outside
of Bretz himself, and the intimation ia
freely given that the young fellow is lying
in an endeavor to get out of a marriage
that he regrets.
Bretz says that he was drunk and in a
stupor when united to Miss Itsell, and
I that he knew little of what was going on.
[ This statement is branded as an unqual
! itied falsehood by Justice Groezinger, Mar
j riage License Clerk Danforth, his assistant,
Mr. Angelo, and Miss Itsell. Justice
! Groezinger, in speaking of the matter yes
terday, said :
"Bretz was as sober as I am now when
he came down here to be married, aud
seemed very anxious that the ceremony
should be performed without delay.
"When the two couples came into my
office Miss Maud seemed to be backward
about standing up witli him and he said:
"â¢Marry us first, Judge,' and then
turned ,to her and said, 'Don't back out,
now that we are here.'
"He was as steady and confident as
possible and did not betray even the
slightest sign of intoxication. After the
ceremony was over and 1 had declared
them man and wife he appeared very af
fectionate toward Mrs. Bretz and kissed
her repeatedly.
"When we went over to the Grotto to
have a bottle of wine he acted very sensi
bly, as newly married couples go, and
drank his bride's nealth with much grace.
"After we had been there a few moments
he got up with his friend Feck and called
me outside. He wanted a certificate that
the marriage had taken place and was
legal, seeming to fear that his bride had
some intention of leaving him. He even
insisted that I p,o over to the hall and
make out the certificated at once, which I
did.
"There was no pledge of secrecy, as he
claims, as I told him that I would have to
record the marriage certificates, though
not for thirty days. He ia not treating
this youug lady right by insinuating that
she was not sober or that be married her
in a stupor, and he seems to me a very
poor specimen of man to conduct himself
as he has since the marriage."
''Cupid" Danforth said that Brotz was
perfectly sober when he asked for a license,
though the prospective bride appeared a
little backward in giving her consent to
the issuance of tho document.
"She declared that she would not be
married by a Justice," said Mr. Danforth,
"but said she wanted the ceremony per
formed in a church. I suppose Bretz per
suaded her that a marriage by a Justice
was all right while they were on their way
downstairs to see her sister and Peterson
married.
"I cannot understand why Bretz should
be so unmanly as to try to hide behind the
flimsy subterfuge that he was drunk."
Clerk Angelo corroborated the statement
that Bretz was sober and that while the
party at the Grotto was in a gay humor
there was nothing in their conduct to war
rant a belief that too much liquor had been
imbibed.
Miss Itsell is emphatic in ncr, denial
that her husband was intoxicated and in
timates that he has been influenced to try
to have the marriage declared void.

DEATH OF A GYPSY KING
Sorrow Reigns in the Camp
of His Kin and Fol
lowers.
HIS NAME WILLIAM SPARROW.
Night Scene at the Gypsy Tents Near
Folsom and Fifteenth
Streets.
Grief reigns in the camp of the gypsies,
for William Sparrow, the king of the Spar
row band, passed to the other world yes-

[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
terday morning. He died in his tent
among his people.
Hardly a sound disturbed the stillness
of the camp on the open ground near Fol
som and Fifteenth streets last evening.
The lifeless form of Father Sparrow lay in
state in one of the tents and clustered
about the fallen chieftain were the mourn
ers of hi? own kin. '
Outside, circling thcearapnre, were some
twelve or iifteen children, boys and girls,
who sat gazing in silence at the cheerful
blaze. The scene, if sad, was picturesque.
William Sparrow, so long the head and
guiding spirit of f his band of gypsies, was
an uncommon man. He was superb in
physique and of commanding presence,
while benevolent in his attributes. His
people were greatly attached to him and
the sorrow caused by his demise is pro
found and sincere.
Pie was born in Suffolk, England, in
1831, and therefore had attained the age of
65 years. He married an Egyptian woman
of beauty and erace. The children of the
union are George, William Jr., Melbourne
and Neva la Sparrow, Mrs. Carrie Whar
ton, Mrs. Shaber Wharton and Mrs. Emma
Lovel. These children dwell in the camp
near Folsom street, and tue abiding place
is rendered interesting by many little boys
and girls, grandchildren of the leader. ,
William Sparrow came to California
thirty-five years ago. He enjoyed the
friendship and confidence of John Center,
Mr. Horn and many of the old-timers who
dwelt in that section of the peninsula.
His natural children and those adopted by
marriage are interesting nnd intelligent.
Mr. Sparrow made several journeys to
England, and other countries since he
came to California, but San Francisco is
regarded as the home of the family.
The funeral will be directed by Craig &
Coohran, undertakers, and will take place
next Sunday. The remains will be buried
in Odd Fellows' Cemetery.
DISLIKES THE NEW WOMAN
Frederick Warde Says She Is
Not Found in Shake-
speare's Plays.
The Actor Does Not Agree With the
Common Estimate of the Character
of Lady Macbeth.
Frederick Warde lectured on "Women
of Shakespeare" at Golden Gate Hall yes
terday afternoon for the benefit of the
Woman's Exchange. His audience was
not a large one, but supplied in interest
and enthusiasm the deficit in numbers.
"For a man to attempt to analyze a
woman is a presumption I would not be
guilty of might I not depend upon him
who has paid so high, so just a tribute to
womanâ Shakespeare," said Mr. Warde.
"No one has co faithfully portrayed that
best loved creature of man, woman.
"Portia was the noblest ol Shakespeare's
heroines. What marvelous sweetness
and gentleness were hers! The only ill
natured renmrk credited to her is, 'Nature
has fashioned him a man, so let him pass.'
With what abandon she surrenders her
life and happiness to her betrothed hus
band ! There was no such nineteenth cen
tury attitude as this: 'Bassanio, I've
promised to marry you. But remember,
lam wealthy. You are poor. I'll control
my own fortune, and my mother-in-law
shall not live with us.' "
He" recited portions of "The Merchant
of Venice," showing the salient points of
Portia's character.
"Two of Shakespeare's heroines donned
male attire, Portia and Rosalind, and I
think both were uncomfortable in their
novel array. Rosalind showed the woman,
however, when sne wandered through the
forest of Arden and plucked the tiny notes
containing poems, such bad poems!
Young men, lovers especially, write such
bad poetry. But she placed the poems
beneath her doublet. Ah! The woman
of it!
"In all literature there is nothing more
exquisite than the love-making between
Juliet and Romeo. The womanly charac
teristic of anxiety about a loved one awak
ens in Juliet as soon as her love was
formed. Why did not Juliet go et once to
her mother and say 'Mamma, my heart is
gone. 1 won't marry Paris.' Ah! young
ladies, always tell your mammas of such
resolves!" [Applause from mothers in
the audience.] "Note in her declaration
to the friar how love had awakened th*
woiuan in this fourteen -year-old child!
She is ready to brave all ills for the man
she loves. The world is full of them."
"There is a character of Shakespeare
that is often misunderstood. Gloster's
easy wooing of Lady Anne is pointed out.
I claim it is a stroke of Shakespeare's
geniuÃ. Lady Anne was a weak character,
not strong of purpose nor particularly
strong of intellect. It was the story of a
weak intellect coping with a strong one.
Hers was a demonstrative grief, such as
cannot last long. It is a story of a shallow
woman unable to cope with the intellectu
ality of a great man.
"I do not agree with the common be
lief that Lady Macbeth was a demon and
ogress. I regard her as a woman who
sacrificed herself for life and eternity loi
the man she loved. She ai led her bus-
band in his ambition, because of her great
love for him. Ido not believe there was a
thought of the murder till Duncan camo
to their castle. Macbeth was a moral cow
ard. She nerved him to the deed. I can
not regard Lady Macbeth as a type of
horror.
"Shakespeare has no new women in his
plays. lam glad he has not. His hero
ines have all the old womanly character
istics. To me the highest type of woman
is the wife of her husband and the mother
of her children. Every man has au ideal

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
Wben the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
south along the coast, rain is probable; but when
the "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva

NEW YORK, N.Y., March 4.-Hlgher quota

chases of St. Paul and Louisville and' Nashville
and the favorable statement of the Rock Island

fidence in values at the Stock Excbaage to-day.
Operators for a rise were disposed .to add, to their
holds of the better class of stocks, and as a result
an advance of 14. to 1/2 per cept took place. A
feature of the trading was the buying for Washing

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 4.â Wheat without be
ing particularly strong this morning was neverthe
less not exceedingly weak. It was apparent that
news of an encouraging nature was wanted to assist
prices, but the bears still exhibited alittle timidity,
the Bradstreet's report of stocks serving to cause
hesitation and doubt as to the wisdom of "short"
selling. When trading began a moderate decline
took place, some selling being prompted by large
Northwestern receiptsâ 434 cars against 442 last
Wednesday and 277 a year ago. Indifferent
cables from Liverpool were received, and those j
who looked abroad for encouragement were disap
pointed. Chicago received 39 cars and inspected
out 69,257 bushels. At noon Bradstreet's report ;
was made public It reported a decrease in the
world's stocks for the past week of 2,182,000 bush- !
els. A decrease on the Pacific Coast during March ,
of 1,593.000 bushels was also given. Following ,
the announcement of these reductions the market
firmed up. a complete recovery taking place. The
Orange-Judd Farmer to-day estimated the farm
reserve on March 1 at 135,000,000. It also
spoke encouragingly of the growing winter wheat.
Export clearances were 349,781 bushels. Closing
Paris cables were higher, Berlin lower and A nt werp
unchanged. May wheat opened from 663,4 cto
! 665 c sold between 67c And 68s/*c, closing at
66"/ 8 c yg@yic higher than yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 72 cars.
CORNâ Arrivals of corn were azaln in excess of
the estimate, 431 cars being inspected in. That
was one weakening feature in the market. The
early easy feeling of wheat was another. The j
trade was of no great consequence, operations all j
being of a minor character. Withdrawals from â¢
store were 76,703 bushels. Liverpool cables were |
quiet and unchanged. Export clearances were
817.657 bushels. Bradstreet's reported an In
crease in the available supply of 1,394,000 bush
els. The Orange-Judd Farmer reported the largest
farm reserve on record at this seasonâl,o6l,ooo,
--000 bushels. May corn opened at 30y 2 c, declined
to 30%e, closing" at 30s c, 6 e under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 426 cars.
OATSâ Of oats little can be said. The trade was
light and the tone averaged fairly steady. Prices
moved slowly and always in accord with those of
the other grains. Receipts were 248 cars and 7040
busbe.s were taken from store. Bradstreet's re
ported an Increase in available stocks of 246,000
bushels and the Orange-Juod Farmer estimated
the farm reserve at 416,000,000 bushels. May oats I
closed a shade underyesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 270 cars.
FLAX- steady ; cash. 89y 2 c: May. 90c Re
ceipts were 26 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The arrivals of hogs continue to
run under the estimates and reports from the yards
are favorable to sellers. This was the case this
morning and the information naturally Dore fruit
In product. Prices ruled higher but business was j
disappointing and, owing to the dullness, the tone ,
was little more than steady at the advance. An !
easier tone succeeded, offerings becoming a little ]
larger. May pork and May lard each closed at 1
7%c under yesterday; May ribs 5 c lower.

Dangers of Throwing Away Com

Signatures.
AN INCENTIVE TO FOSGERY.
Merchants May Demand That the
Ticket-Collector Be Required to
Destroy Them.
O^klajtd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 4. \
Passengers on the ferry-boats who use
commutation tickets, and who may have
any reason tor not wishing to let every
body know whether they cross the bay or
not, will need to exercise more care than
nas been done in the past. Everybody
who crosses the bay on the last day of the
month is familiar with the thick carpet of
punched-out commutation tickets that
gather around the ticket-takers on either
side of the bay. Very few, however, give
a thought to the complete record con
tained on each piece of pasteboard, or to
the possibilities that such record may
lead to.
On each ticket the owner has to sign his
name. The punches chow the days on
which Qe crossed the bay, whether by the
narrow or broad gauge routes, and
whether the return journey in either case
was made at night or next morning. That
these details are of great value 10 private
detectives in working up cases has just
been demonstrated. The following story
from an Oakland detective, who also was
observed to pick up a discarded commuta
tion ticket last Saturday evening, contains
pointers for thousands of people who
never gavo the matter a thought previ
ously.
"A few weeks ago," said the detective,
"a divorce suit was tiled in this county
that promised to lead to substantial reve
lations. There was no desire on the part
of the lady to force matters into publicity
if an amicable settlement could be reached.
The husband showed an inclination to
right the case and refused to make any
compromise. The complaint contained
allegations referring to a date at the be
ginning of February. In his answer the
husband, who i. c a San Francisco merchant
residing on this side of the bay, denied
that ne came over to Oakland at ail on the
evening of the day mentioned. It could
not be proved that he did, but his wife
could prove that he did not appear at his
home. While trying to settle the matter
â  suggested that a glance at the gen
immntation ticket would quick
ly settle tiie difficulty.
Aj lie was not Jiving at home there was
at wait tiil tue end of the
en it was known the commuta
tion ticket would be thrown away. He
wed and last Saturday nignt the
was picked up. It contained bis
signature and on looking at the date it
bat he had returned to Oakland
..y in Question and also on
the next morning. On beinij apprise 1 of
acts he withdrew his opposition and
the Court Commissioner will be the only
one who will learn anything of their dif
â 'f course he night have at
tempted to prove that hfl loaned his ticket
that particular night, but it would have
been hard to produce the party who used
it. That, is one use for exhausted commu
ration tickets and the same tacts would
come in usefully in a dozen other ways
that will readily suggest themselves.
"There is yet another feature of this
comruutation-ticket business ti.at 1 have
often heard discussed, and I would not be
surprised if some action were not taken
before long in the matter. I refer to tbÂ«
easy manner in which tne present system
mattes it possible to obtain tb â¢ signatures
of prominent business men and capitalists
who daily cross the bay. There are prob
abiy 6000 legitimate signatures of men
fcolid financially and socially thrown away
every month. Any one can pick them up,
and the possibilities for ail kinds of
jorgery and misuse of the names are very
great."
Mayor Davie has frequently thought of
the matter, and is of the opinion that the
commutation tickets should be destroyed
by the ticket-collector when they "are
punched for the last time.
WAITING ON THE WEATHER
University Students Anxious to
Get to Work Again on
the Campus.
Co-Eds Considering as to Whether
They Will Accept the Challenge
Received From Stanford.
BERKELEY, Gal., March 4.â The
students at the State University are
anxious for the weather to clear off suf
ficiently for them to finish the work on the
new entrance to the grounds as well as the
excavating around North Hall. Though
it was impossible on account of the rain to
iir> any work last Monday, which day Lad i
been set aside by President Kellogg for
completing ihe task, yet it is generally un
derstood that another day will be granted
the collesre men for that purpose as soon
as it is clear weather.
As matters now stand it is quite impos
sible to use more than half of the new six
teen-foot walk on account of iis semi-com
] ieted condition, and the ground in front
â â¢! North Hall is so rouch tiiat passage is
uiade with only the greatest difficulty.
On account 'if the inconveniehce experi
enced in reaching the hall by the front ap
proach most of the students go to tne rear
of the building. Huch of the picks, shov
els, crowbars and wheelbarrows as have
not teen carried awny for souvenirs of tne
lent labor" movement have been
piled up in the basement of North Hall,
awaiting the cessation of the inclement
weather and the return to them of the
corps of bhstered-handed college "dips. "
That the implements, though most of
them have been borrowed from Golden
Hate Park, are choice and valuable sonve-
Dirs of what has proved to be a
movement, is evinced by the fact that a
day or so ago a student was seen carrying
<yff tiro shovels and a pick fur his lady
friends. wbD were waiting outside the
fence with a roll of b'ue and gold ribbon.
Only a few of the tools have been
missed, however; but :t is a certainty that
* number of them have been carried
away by sentimental and enthusiastic
seekers of college relics. The fact that
several of the borrowed tools have been
taken away un authoritatively is not gen
erally known and in consequence the re
maining implements have not been placed
under lock and key, but merely piled
away in the open basement of North Hail.
Co-Â£dÂ« Considering.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 4.â The co
eds at the State University are considering
the challenge from the* Stanford co-ed
basket-ball nine for a game to be played
within a month, and as matters now stand
it seems probable that they will accept the
proposition, providing the game is played
indoors and not before a mixed audience.
One of the stipulations of the challenge
from Stanford is that the game is to be
played on the campus at Palo Alto. This
clause the Berkeley giris seem unwilling
to accept, since it would mean that a
mixed audience would be present, and
they say they will not play before the men.
The Berkeley co-eds are willing and
eager to play the wearers of the cardinal,
but they seem set in their determination
not to "be a part to a public, exhibition
where both 9exes will be equally privileged
as spectators. It is thought very prob
able that the Stanford girls will acquiesce
in the matter of where the game is to be
played and give the Berkeley nine the
privilege of naming both the time and
piece, since they are the challenging
parties. Captain Griswold that a
nicetin? will be held tomorrow at the
hour for "gym," when the matter, in so
far as Berkeley is concerned, will be
settled.
Better Streets Wanted.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 4.â lt was re
ported last night at the meeting of the
West Berkeley Progressive Club that sev
eral petitionsaskingfor the macadamizing
of Delaware, Fifth and several other streets
in that immediate vicinity were being cir
culated for signatures. The petitions are
addressed to the Town Board.
It was the sentiment of the meeting that
street improvements in the territory
named in the petitions were a necessity,
and it was accordingly decided to indorse
the several petitions.
The recent action of the Board of Educa
tion in calling for $60,000 to be expended
in the erection and equipment of new
school buildings was discussed. The con
census oi opinion was in favor of the
proposition, but several of the members
expressed their doubts as to the legality
of the action.
Map of Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cal.. March. 4.â A map of
the town of Berkeley has been issued from
the County Clerk's oiiice. It has been
made un*er the direction of County Sur
veyor Nusbaumerfrom maps of the differ
ent sections of the town, which ha^e been

WRITES OF MISS PARKER
Mrs. Wood Says She Was Un
able to Manage Her Busi
ness.
Had Her Letters Been Published in
Full Much Unpleasantness Would
Have Been Saved.
Oakland Office San FttAKCGKCO Call,)
908 Broadway, March 4> f
Mrs. John F. Wood, the wife of the man
who was wrongfully credited with know
ing considerable about the death of Miss
Annie Parker, ha 3 written a letter for pub
lication that straightens out several mat
ters in connection with that sad affair.
When the body of Miss Parker was re
covered at Baden Borne letters were found
in her pockets that were kept by her
brother and only smali portions of them
were printed. Mrs. Wood says if they
bad been printed in full theey would huve
conveyed a very different impression.
After referring to the finding of Mifll
Parker's body in a manner which justified,
ail the writer had previously said about
the story of a conspiracy between her and
the unfortunate woman, Mrs. Wood say?:
As to my corresponding with gentlemen, I
wish to say it is entirely false. Miss Parker
never credited anything of the kind, for she
knew better, and I defy anyone in Oakland, in
my seventeen years with you. to bring forward
one letter that'l have wrll .in of such a nature,
or who can say aught against my character, as
represented. Harm Can be made out of noth
ing if people are evil-minded, &n<*, were it not
for the knowledge that tnese hurtful things
spoken by my husband were said when he arai
under the influence of liquor I should reply
differently, and I am sorry to say thai when lie
wa- in that state I was spoken to and of very
unkindly. Many things have been spoken that
would not have been said had he been himself,
as many of my friends are aware. In this
sad affair rev heart has been too much
grieved to answer, as Miss Parker ai;d I
were good friend*, as was also the entire family.
I helped her out of many difficulties in a busi
ness way that would worry her. Sfce Was not
capable of carrying the lull burden of the
business upon herself and she many times told
me so. I feel sure it was business troubles that
caused her despondency and death, for she felt
so badly thai sne was not able to make a suc
ii of it. As to my letters found in her
pocket, It is strenge they could not have been
read and printed rightly. I never pan', she
should use hor influence on my husband
toward rue and return to Baltimore. 1 did say,
'â¢If you have any influence please do so in get
ting Mr. Wood to, send my father* picture to
me, which was boxed before 1 left." My mother
wanted it. lam sorry to say I never got it.
I now ask my many dear friends in Oakland
to remember me as I waÂ« true, honest and
upright, and even in my leaving Oakland I
can produce the letters written by friends to
my people here of mv condition. I am eu
tlrely innocent of it all, and only ask you to
publish the plain truth of the matte, Bs"it is a
very sad affair and no one can feel more
grieved over it than I do.
But I hope ibis may reach the minds of all
who have misjudged me, and to my ever
faithful and sympathizing friends I return my
heartfelt prayers. lim yours respectfully,
.Mrs. John F. Wood.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
MISS NEWLAND'S REPLY
She Makes Some Very Serious
Charges Against Carrie
Burch.
DENIAL OF HER PARENTAGE.
Another Stage Reached in the Con
test for the Old Capitalist's
Estate.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, March -L J
Martha Newland, the heir of the large
Newland estate, tiled an answer to-day,
through her attorneys, Dodge & Fry, to
the suit for participation brought by Carrie
Newland Burch two weeks ago.
Martha Newland, the niece, who is the
executrix, denies that, Carrie Burch is the
illeeitimate child of her uncle and pro
ceeds to tell a story that is totally at
variance with that of Mrs. Burch. The
answer says that Mr. and Mrs. Newland
took the plaintiff when she was a girl
about 7 years of ai:e from the Protestant
Orphanage in San Francisco and took her
to their home and cared for her. She was
a full orphan and was so represented by
the directors of the orphanage. Carrie
was never adopted or recocnized us a child
of the family, and when Mr. Newland died
he left a paragraph in his will which read:
"I commend her to the care and protec
tion of my wife, Carrie Roundy." Some
years later Mrs. Newland died and the
niece inherited the estate. When Mrs.
Newland made her will she expressly left
Carrie $o.
The niece says she continued to care for
Carrie after Mr. Newland'e death, but that
the iatter wa3 wayward and caused her
benefactors much grief by her actions.
Some very serious allegations are then
made against the character of the plaintiff,
who has married twice smce Mr. Xewland
died.
Attention is called to the fact that some
time ago the plaintiff was interested in a
suit in which the same point was involved
as in the present case, and that the jndg
ment was against her on all points. It is
further recited that whatever claim the
plaintiff may allege she has is barred by
several statutes of limitations.
PILEDRIVER GOES OVER.
Foreman McOovern Carried Down and
Serionsly Injured.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â The pile
driver at work on Temescal Greek, at
t?hattuck avenue, fell over from the false
work this afternoon and went to the bot
tom of the creek, thirty feet below. Fore
man A. J. McGovern, who was standing
on the machine at the time directing the
work, went down with ie and was seriously
if not fatally injured.
Supervisor Ptlouze is having a bulkhead
put in at that point by Cotton Bros. & Co.,
to prevent the water from washing away
the bridge foundations. Some half dozen
or more piles have been driven, on which
the driver was standing. The two-ton ham
mer was at top and a pile was being
hauled from the bed of the creek into posi
tion to drive, when the whoie thing top
pled over into the creek, carrying the
foreman with it. The workingmen below
were warned in time to escape by run
nin...
Mr. McGovern was extricated and re
moved to the Anchor brewery and at
tended to by Dr. Knckein, who was pres
ent at the time. "Word was sent to the
city and the patrol was sent out to remove
the injured man to the Receiving Hospi
tal, where he was closely examined by Drs.
Hamlin and Johnson. It was found that
he had four ribs brouen on the left side,
and it is feared he is internally injured, as
he vomited blood. He was removed to his
home, 359 Tenth street, later iii the day.
INTRODUCED BY GARFIELD.
Letter* Brought West by Pioneer Cap
tain Mealy.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â Mrs. Jesse
Healy, widow of the late pioneer, has a
number of interesting letters in her pos
session that were left among the effects of
Captain Healy when he died last week.
| He served as quartermaster during the
war and at its close moved to this State.
i One of the most valuable is a letter from
James A. Garfield introducing him to Hon.
K. R. Axtell on his arrival on the coast
and is as follows:
Cleveland, Ohio, May 24, 1869.
Hon. R. R. Axtellâ Dear Sir: Permit me to
introduce to you my friend, Cagtain Jesse
Healy of Newbureh, Ohio. He is a gentleman
whom you will be glad to know. ; He served
with honor in the Union army and is an able
and effective business man. lie goes to .San
Francisco to live and will enter into business
there. Any favor you may beaDletoshow htm
will be gratefully received by him and oblige
me. Very truly yours, James a. Garfield.
It appears that Garfield was a neighbor
and warm personal friend of Healy'swhen
he resided in Ohio. Captain Healy knew
Lincoln, and always preserved a card con
taining the Jatter's signature as a sacred
remembrance. This card was given to
Dr. Adams just prior to death's call. Mrs.
Healy will go to San Francisco and reside
with her son for me present.
REGISTRATION QUESTIONS
Regarding the Rights of Voters Owing
to the Cancellation.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â The ques
tion has been raised whether a voter can
be deprived of his right in a town election
simply because he has not placed his name
on the new Great Register of the county.
Also as to whether the cancellation by
the Board of Supervisors of the old regis
ter has any effect upon trie use of that :
register at these town elections.
These questions have been freely dis
cussed by County Clerk Jordan and numer
ous attorneys, who express the' opinion
that the cancellation does not affect these
town elections, and that a voter whose
name is upon it has a legal right to vote,
as the act of the Legislature which made
provision for registration ,of voters in
tended the election laws to be general in
their application, and that it refers in a
large; measure, if not entirely, to regula
tions regarding the conduct of general
elections, either State or National.
Tne towns seriously affected by the can
, cellation are Berkeley, Hay wards, San
Leandro, I'leasanton and Livermore, be
sides the Fruitvale sanitary districts 1 and
L', the Piedmont and Golden Gate sanitary,
districts/all of which have elections during ,
the month. . ,
' Unity Club's Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â The Unity
Club of -the B big and fashionable ; First
Unitarian. Church of this city has inaug
urated a work in the County Jail looking
toward the amelioration of the condition
of the ; women inmates. A committee
visited the Hotel de White several days
ago and conferred with tha Sheriff as to
the needs of his prisoners and the best way
to reach those of ; the gentler sex. The
women's quarters have been transferred
into 'a' sewing-room, and the half-dozen
inmates have taken to work with the in
dustry born possibly of a ray. of good in
tention. , : .' â¢â â  â â - â ' ,;â¢ ;:^; : -. ; -: -.â¢_â ;â .â¢.-. â â .-â¢ -â â -. ..
Said the Sheriff to-day:
Practical efforts are required in this prison
reform work. The inculcation of morality
through the placing of such things before
these people as will first appeal to their phys
ical demands is, in my judgment, ihe best
work that any one can undertake in their be
half. A woman goes out of jail half clothed,
and remorseless as well, and Rinks to her old
level without a qualm. There Is, in my opin
ion, some good in many of these unfortuuates
who are allowed to drift back to their old en
vironment. One of them lold me a day or so
ago that it made no difference. No one would
have her if she sought a different mode of Hfe.
She would be turned out of the first place she
went to if It were known she was a "jail bird."
The way to reach these people is irom the out
side first. Then, U one cares to follow up with
moral teaching, well and good. The Unity-
Club's plan has my hearty support, and I

Lost in the Snow.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â Professor
Kellick, Andrew Vekander and Louis Raffe
returned to-night from St. Helena after a
very unusual and exciting experience in
California. They attempted to climb the
mountain Sunday afternoon last, but
owing to a. heavy cioud bank did not see
thai a heavy snowstorm was raging on the
summit. When too late they found them
selves in the midst of the storm.
Kellick has been in the northern lati
tudes, and that fact probably is the reason
of the party escaping alive after twenty
four hours'tramp over the mountain side,
almost famished and weaK from hunger.
All Sunday night they stood around a
carupfire arid waited for day. Monday was
spent in efforts to reach their starting
point, but it was not located until night.
Searching parties were sent out from the
hotel for them, bufin the storm they were
missed.
Debased by Liquor.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4. â Henry
Young was arrested to-day charged with
the non-support of his family. He is a
junkman and makes plenty of money to
provide for his wife and five little children,
but the neighbors say he comes home
drunk every night, and in two weeks past
has only contributed 10 cents to the sup
port of the familj'.
Before drink got the best of him Young
owned his home and held a good position
with the railroad company. He has been
a frequent visitor of the Police Court as a
common drunk of late. The wife mort
gaged the home, and when that was gone
had to Bell the furniture piece by piece to
keep herself and children from starving.
A Lantern Operator.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â A. J. Mac-
Murtry has sworn to a warrant against
Rev. C. H. Scott, the wandering evangel
ist, who borrowed his $300 stereopticon
apparatus and neglected to return it. Scott
was arrested in Los Angeles several weeks
ago, but was released before a warrant
could be sent down there. The officers of
that city have been requested by Chief
Lloyd to apprehend him if possible, and,
if he is caught, he will be brought here to
I answer the charge of embezzlement.
The Commercial Advertiser of Canton,
N. J., gives a long account of the "Rev."
Scott's doings. He has "'borrowed" lan
terns and funds throughout the Eastern
States. It appears that he is known in
Norwood. N. .!., Potsdam, Vt., Middle

tion in the i'oiice Court to-day on the
charge of bunkoing M. G. Ritchie out of

Mony of St. Helena, stepson of Ritchie,
told the story of how Gordon ingratiated
himself into their conridence and worked
the stepfather so successfully.
Professor S. B. Christy of the University
of California testified the bricKs were cop*
per worth about twenty cents each. M.

MAY SUCCUMB TO GRIEF
The Mother of Abe Majors
Found by Sheriff White
in Destitution.
WAS WITHOUT FOOD OR FUEL.
Her Friends Fear Tkat Her Sorrows
Will Prove More Than She
Can Sustain.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 4. f
Mrs. Wagner, the mother of Abe Majors,
is lying very low with nervous prostration
at her residence at 613 Sixth street, near
Harrison, and her friends fear that she
will succumb to grief. To make matters
worse she is in destitute circumstances,
without a dollar to pay her rent for the
roof that shelters her from the unusually
cold world. The landlady is a kind
hearted person, and though hardly able to '
extend such leniency she is not pressing
the unfortunate woman for rent.
Sheriff White visited Mrs. Wagner to
day, and he not only extended his sym
pathy in words, but in a more substantial
manner. When he saw her weak condi
tion he went out and purchased eggs and
brandy to keep up her strength, that is
rapidly giving away unde: the 6train of
the past five weeks. When he saw that
the cheerless home lacked fuel to make it
comfortable, coal and wood were also pur
chased by the kind-hearted Sheriff.
Doctors E. J. Boyes and Starr have both
showed their sympathy by giving their
services to assist Mrs. Wagner to regain
her health and strength.
The only consoling news that has reached
the anxious ears of Mrs. Wagner from
Folsorn is that neither her son nor Bert
Willmore will be allowed to mingle with
hardened criminals, and that instead of
being put to breaking rock or other
laborious work, these young boys will be
detailed for light duties in the kitchen,
dining-room and library of the prison. This
has afforded one $:rain of comfort to the
heart-broken mother.
Mrs. Randolph, an Oakland dressmaker,
has beea the only lady who has been
actively interested in Mrs. Willmore, now
confined as a prisoner in the City Prison.
Mrs. Randolph, it is said, at one time em
ployed Mrs. Willmore to assist her in sew
ing. It was Mrs. Randolph who sat by
Mrs. Willmore's side at the preliminary
examination of the prisoner, and with
whom Ina Willraore went instead of re
turning to the Chabot Home, and who will
contest Mrs. Prescott's application for
Ina's guardianship.
To-day this lady has been working hard
hunting witnesses to testify in Mrs. Will
more's behalf.
Judge Wood was to have decided the
case against Mrs. Willmore this morning,
but he continued it for another day.
The Gold Brick Swindlers.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 4.â The exam
ination of the gold brick swindlers was
carried on till within an hour of midnight.
The police court was as lively as a circus.
The large lobby laughed heartily as the
farmer, Hofstra, from San Jose, and the
banker, Ritchie, from Napa, told how they
put up $10,000 and $4000 respectively on
brass bricks. Attorneys Reed and Nus
baumer appeared for the defendants, and
the examination was distinguished for its
humor.
The valuable outfit of the swindlers was
in court, and the evidence was the most
remarkable ever heard in the police court.
So far no evidence has been adduced tend
ing to show who was the "Indian" who
played a conspicuous part in the methods
employed by the swindlers. The absence
of the Indian caused much merriment, as
counsel for the defendant thought the
police should catch him to sustain their
case.
One of the men was out on $.500 bail and
at the i lose of the night session Judge
Woods raised his bafl to $2500.
The examination will be continued to
morrow.

Library Not to Be Moved.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 4.â The Trus
tees have decided by a definite vote not to
move the public library. They had a long !
Giscussion over the proposition, and tried
to align themselves with public sympathy
on the subject. There is a room in the
new City Hall designed especially for the
library," hut they claim it is not large
enough. They say it would not properly
house the books and papers now. und the
institution is growing rapidly. To get the
matter before the body, Mr. Allen moved !
that the board move the library into the
new City Hall. All the vote the propo
sition got was the mover's. But itffs said
by ail of them that if there is any con
siderable public sentiment in favor of
moving they are willing to move. The
effort to build a library building by a
syndicate of citizens, the city to purchase
it gradually afterward, is making head
way. Upward of $11,000 of the $20,000
necessary for the building has been
pledged already.
Mr. Bennett Exercised.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 4.â The local
newspapers contained accounts a few days
ago of how the assistant librarian of the
public library had seriously objected to
C. R. Bennett's actions, claiming that
iie Btared visitors at the library and the
assistant out of countenance, Ben
nett is very nearsighted and unfortunately
has a seeming habit of staring at people in
a rude manner when he may not "see them
at ail or only indistinctly. At the last
meeting of the Library Board Mr. Berfnett
appeared and asked for a hearinc on the
charges. The assistant librarian was sum
moned to appear but declined, desiring to
speak privately to the preiident instead.
The result of this private conference was
that Mr. Bennett was informed there were
no charges against him nor any complaint
whatever, and the somewhat sensational
matter was thus set at rest. Mr. Ben
nett's past troubles make any charges of
the kind of double importance.
Big Realty Sale.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 4.â An im
portant sale of business real estate has
been made. A lot twenty-five feet front
on Park street, containing a two-story
brick building, was sold by Mr?. E. B.
Hayden to Mrs. .Jennie M. Shannon. The
price was $10,000, which was not high.
Mrs. Hayden is an invalid and is shortly
to go East to reside with relatives.

DEMOCRATIC WAR CRIES.
They Grow Louder as the State
Central Committee Meet
ing Nears.
Raleigh Barcar and Gavin McNab
Give a Country and a Junta View
of the Battle.
The meeting of the Democratic State
Central Committee at the California Hotel
on the 14th inst., a week from next Satur
day, has drawn so near that the leaders of
the local factions are making definite plans
for the fight between the Buckleyites and
the Junta that is sure to be the chief fea
ture of the meeting.
The meeting promises to be well at
tended, and no possible proxies will be left
lying Joose eround the State. The regular
business of the meeting will probably be
soon attended to. It will include a cailfor
a State Convention, an apportionment of
delegates and the fixing of the place where
the convention shall meet.
It is yet uncertain whether the vote for
Cleveland or for Budd will be taken as the
basis of apportionment, and neither has
any keen champions. Stockton is alread}'
making a vigorous campaign for the con
vention, and so far is the only city that is
doinp so. Santa Cruz is expected to go
after it, and there is a possibility that Sac
ramento will, but no other cities are yet
mentioned.
The chief interest in the convention con
cerns the local squabble. It is asserted by
a large proportion of the leading Demo
crats that it is practically certain the State
committee will not take any action recog
nizing the Junta as the regular local or
ganization, but will instead order a prim
ary election for delegates to the State Con
vention, which shall be open to the whole
party and conducted by a special commit
tee appointed by the StaU j Central Com
mittee. The Junta will ask to be officially
declared the regular party organization,
and the Buckleyites will vigorously com
bat the Junta's claims, while quietly back
ing up a compromise proposition that an
independent committee shall conduct a
primary. The ginger and the venom
attendant on the combat promise to
break the record of Democratic rights.
Gavin McNab is still the active manager
of Junta affairs and he and those with aim
scout the possibility of there being any
compromise with Buckley. It 19 claimed
that ninety-five of the 103 members of the
State Centra; Committee throughout the
State have declared themselves hostile to
Buckleyism in any form. But several in
terior members of the committee in dis
cussing the situation with others have re
mained doubtful about what should be
done. They have no use for Buckley, but
they have as little for Sam Rainey, and
some have as little for John Daggett. The
Buckleyites will point to the Junta and
ask if Sam Rainey doesivt smell as bad as
Buckley, and they may affect to hold their
nose 3at Daggett. They think there will
be nothing for the State Central Commit
tee to do but to say, "A plague on all your
factions," and order a new deai with a
show for everybody.
Raleigh Barcar of Vacaville, grand
sachem of the State League of iroquois
clubs, is one of the leading country mem
bers of the committee, and his attitude is
typical of that of a majority of the com
mittee. In discussing the local situation
the other day he said :
The politicians down here have queer ways
that we of the interior caa hardly
understand. I will come down here and
find a lot of leaders lighting and damning cer
tain people, and the next time I come down I
rind tnem working together like brothers.
When we have a fight it last*.
As I will be one of the jurors in this case I
can't judge it in navance, but I can. say that
we in the country have no use for Buckley.
He makes merchandise of politics and his
motives are entirely selfish. We have no use
for bosses. As I understand the situation the
Junta, as they are called, claim to be the regu
lar organization, and if there is a question of
fact involved in tiiat it will have to be consid
ered. They say Rainey is in the Junta. Well,
such cattle are marked aud spotted, and, of
course, wherever they work they are after
what they can get.
We have no more n<=e for Kearney than we
have for Buckley. Daggett? Well, Daggett is
a nice enough fellow personally, but he mustn't
think that he owns everything and can use it
fur himself. Datjgett got what he didn't merit.
He didn't make a speech during the campaign
of 1892; he -lidn't attend the Fresno conven
tion, and 1 Know that he didn't give a cent to
the State Central Committee. But he got the
Mint. Weil, that's all right, I suppose, but 1
don't see that that gives him a right to run
things. I don't see that Welburn has any par
ticular right to run things, either.
It's my opinion that it's more than an even
ehanco that the Supreme Court will uphold the
new primary law, and if it does the problem is
settled. If it doesn't it is hard to say what the
State Central Committee will do. Likely it
will take things into its own hands and order
a primary open to the whole party, as was done
in 189"2. when the reorganizes came before us.
That would be in accordance with party pre
cedents.
If the Junta can show a good title to the
local organization it will likely be recognized.
My personal inclination would be to recog
nize any set of men who could show that they
were working in the Interest of decency and
clean politicsâ even if they could show but
little more than belligerent rights. But the
local situation will need careful investigation.
I suppose we will have a two or three days'
session over it as we had in 1892.
Gavin McNab has lone been hnÃtling
among the members of the State Central
Committee and he will undoubtedly have
as much to say as anybody on the floor at
the meeting and will lead the anti-
Buckley tight. Mr. \icNab was asked
yesterday to give his estimate of the situ
ation that will confront the committee
men, and this is what he said:
I can foreshadow the action of the State
Central Committee only because I am ac
quainted with the character and positions of
the members. lam sure the Democracy need
expect nothing at their hands that is not clean
and honorable. Naturally, the hither & man's
character the less use he has for Buckley,
Buckleyisrn and its attendant indecencies.
Jnst consider tbe incongruity oi the idea that,
when San Francisco has arrived at a point
when U>e denizens of Morton street are to
be removea, the State Central Committee is
to be asked to set up Buckleyism. To propose
to agaia inflict this moral monstrosity on the
party requires a moral turpitude on the part of
those advancing the nauseating idea that is
too loathsome to dwell upon.
Undoubtedly Buckley has already instructed
hit toola to make much clamor before the com
mittee, in the hope of creating the impression
lhat their numbers are commensurate with
their disturbance. The Ex-Convicte' Aid .So
ciety, the Ancient Order of Ballot-sniffers, the
Crooked Sewer-builders' Society and every
form of corruption incident to a Buckley
regime will doubtless be praying for recogni
tion. There is understood to be ready an as
sortment ot affidavits by people who would be
disbelieved the more frequently they corrobo
rated each other. The Mate Committee will
be iniormed that Jimmy the Pig, Fat Jack
Kiley, Dick Creigh^on and" such other responsi
ble citizens are sure that the party cannot
succeed without their support.
1 do not knmv just in what form the matter
will come before the State Central Committee.
When the new general committee assembles
next week it will undoubtedly determine in
what wav it will approach the "State Commit
tee and lay the matter before them. The sftate
Committee is all-powerful. It^ recognition in
iho issuance of tne call would be absolutely
determinative.
I think there is no possibility of Buckleyism
getting any recoguition whatever. When the
State Committee has finisher! its work the pub
lic will understand that Mr. Buckley's organi
zation is simply a piece club.
The State Committee is not likely to adopt
a.ny compromise plan looking to a primary
run by an independent committee, though I
understand that two members of the State
Central Committee, who have been pretending
to work with the decent element, have been,
secretly working with Buckley and are prepar
ing such a proposition. They will be exposed
and thoroughly "roasted" before the commit
tee. The State Committee has too much sense
and courage to be intimidated by the threat
that tne criminal elementwill defeat the party
that has tbe honor to refuse to compound a
feloi.y.
It will be seen that the prospects for a
gay Democratic time are very bright.
EIGHT-HOUR LABDR LAW.
Itg Gross Violation at Chico Reported
to the Labor Bureau.
The business of a land office on the
border of a newly opened piece of the pub
lic domain is being done at the State
Labor Bureau.
This condition of affairs has prevailed
since the bureau became settled in its
new quarters on Sutter street.
"There is everything in location," said
one of the officers yesterday, "and the
events of the past few days have confirmed
that fact in my mind beyond a doubt.
Why, we have had more personal applica
tions during the last two days than were
received at the old room during the rast
five months. And it is all due to our loca
tion. Heretofore our applications for fe
male help, particularly, have come to us
mostly through mail or by telpph^n
Within the two days last past hundreds of
private conveyances have stop; ed in front
of our door."
The rooms on the ground floor wero
crowded throughout the entire day, and
the attaches are having their hands full in
looking after the business and settling
themselves in their new quarters between
breathing spells.
The only matter of "mportance brought
before the Â© rumission yesterday was
through the medium of a communication
from Chico, where it seems the eight-hour
Jabor law is being violated and the City
Trustees are accused of making them
selves parties to a wily contractor's
scheme to defraud his men of a share of
their just wase.
The letter, of which the following is a
copy, is self-explanatory :
Ohico, Cal., March 3, 1896.
E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Commissioner, San Fran-
Cisco, Cal.â -Dear Sir: We write you, the object
being to gain information in regard to some
work done for a contractor by the name of S.
Mortindall. Said Mortiadail took a contract
to grade and gravel some streets for the city of
Chico, Butte County, Cal.
Mortindall hin-d laborers to shovel gravel
anrl worked the men nine to nine and a half
hours a day for a day's work nnd paid some of
them at the rate of .*1 40 a day for those hours.
Now, is tnat rigi.t? (torn* cuuld not get any
money out 01 Mortindal'.; therefore h.-> mcii
went and got the [resident of the Board of
Trustee? of Chico to cash the orders, said Tru.-
tees discounting their pay from 12 to L3K
cents on the dollar. Sodik have not been paid
er all.
Therefore we would like immediate assist
ant eln regard to the matter. Yours respect
fully
The followine-named men (others not sign
ing this paper will make statements in regard
to the matter):
F. Morgan, A. Reno, Joe Tyler, U. A. Bear, A.
C. Doan, William Doan, W. R. Williams, J. C.
Mathews, F. L. Swearinger.
Commissioner Fitzgerald has determined
to investigate the matter, and has already
requested a detailed statement from the
City CJerk. He does not intend that the
labor^law and the inherent right 9of the
laboring men shall be infringed upon if it
lies in his power to prevent it.
Beginning with next Monday there will
be two men in the field collating statistics
concerning the condition of labor affairs
in the City and State. The ultimate pur
pose of these statistics is to form the basis
of an exhaustive report to be published by
the Commissioner, but he will give out in
teresting information for publication in the
press from time to time. In that way it
will reach the general public more effectu
ally than through the medium of the 5000
copies of his report.
SEW TO-DAY.'
Gladness Comes
With a better understanding of the
i YÂ» transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills,* which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâ gentle â pleasant effortsâ
rightly; directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge, that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt- '
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
"who value good health. Its, beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
; one i remedy which Z promotes internal
I cleanliness -.without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial ; effects, to â  note when , you pur-
chase," that you have the genuine arti-
cle, which is manufactured by the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. only and sold by
all reputable druggists.
'â â If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, laxatives or
other remedies are then not needed. If
afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
one should have the best; and with the
i well-informed everywhere, Syrup Of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

AFTER EUREKA BUSINESS.
Local Merchants Claim That
They Are Being Discrimi
nated Against.
Action to Be Taken by a Committee
to Be Appointed by Board of
Trade Members.
According to the idea of a large number
of the local merchants Portland, with
the aid of the Oregon Railway and Navi
tion Company's steamer South Coast, has
been getting 3 large share of the Hum
bold t Bay business that it was not by right
entitled to.
The matter was first agitated br Traffic
Manager \Y . B. Curtis of the Traffic Asso
ciation some weeks ago, and it was ex
pected to come up for action before that
body yesteraay. The meeting was ad
journed, however, in order to permit tne
members to attend the special meetins of
the Board of Trade of San Francisco called
for yesterday to consider the same subject.
The call for the same fully explains the
situation as viewed by the local merchants
and is as follows : ,
The directors of the Board of Trade have
had their attention called to the fact that the
trade of San Francisco with HumboMt Bay is
In imminent danger of being diverted to Port
land, Or., by discrimination in freights.
Trie steamer South CoaÂ«t has recently been
put on the run between Portland and San
Francisco, and makes stops at Kureka on her
down trip, carrying all classes oi freight from
Portland to Eureka at M per ton, while the
average rate of freight from San Francisco to
Eureka is about; s3 per ton. The distance trom
San Francisco to Eureka is only 220 miles,
while from Portland to Eureka it is 330 miles.
Notwithstanding this difference in distance in
favor of San Francisco the rate from here is
about #'2 por ton more.
It, therefore, seem* necessary that some ac
tion should be taken at once if we desire to re
tain the trade of the territory mentioned, and
for this purpose a coniereuce of representa
tives of the different branches of business,
with the directors of the board, has been called
at these rooms for Wednesday, March 4, 1896,
at 3 o'clock p. m.
Your counsel and advice is needed, and you
are earnestly requested to be present.
There were about twenty members of the
board present, representing nearly as many
different branches of business. In the
discussion which took place it was asserted
that nearly 400 tons o: frright were shipped
from Portland to Eureka last month that
in the ordinary course of events would
have been sold in San Francisco.
It was decided to request tne presidents
of the different commercial organizations,
sued as the Chamber of Commerce, Manu-
facturers' ami Producers' Association.
Merchants' Association, San Francisco
Fruit and Produce Exchange, Trarlic
Association and Board of Trade of
San Francisco to appoint two dele- i
gates to meet as a committee in the
rooms of tiie Board of Trade on Tuesday
next at 3 p. m. and take the matter up and
devise some means to overcome tbe Port
land competition and the alleged discrim
ination in freight rates.
It is claimed by F. F. Connor, the gen
eral agent of the Oregon Railway and :
Navigation Company in this City, tnatthe !
South Coast has only made the rate?l from '
Portland to Eurekawhen it was made by
the Alice BSanchard, operated by the i
Northern Pacific Steamship Company be- ,
tween Portland and San Francisco, and
touching a: Coos and Humboldt bays. He
also claimed that this rate is now made,
on salt, coal and the lowest class of
freight, and that the rates on other com
modities are higher, ranging from ?1 to s3. |
He aiso denies any intention on tne part
of the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company to discriminate against San
Francisco in favor of Portland or any other
city.

Fourth District, which will have jurisdic
tion over the primary election for the
selection of delegates to the State Conven
tion.
As the committee chosen last night is
one wholly different from the one an
nounced after the meeting held in the
rooms of Senator J. H. Mahoney in the
Baldwin Hotel last Saturday night, there
may arise a conflict of authority in the
Fourth District, or at least a good imita
tion of one, over the question of who con
stitute the Congressional committee of
the Fourth District.
This question can be settled only by a
comparison of the meetings which ap
pointed the respective committees. It
was shown at the meeting Jast night that
the committee announced Saturday night
as the committee for the Fonrth Congres
sional District was appointed by a minor
ity of the members of the State Central
Committee, in which the creation of
such a committee was vested at the
meeting of the State Central Commit
tee last Saturday afternoon, and that the
majority even of those present was ef
fected by the barefaced forgery of the
proxy of a State Central Committeeman
who had received no notice of the meeting.
Such a forgery is probably beyond the
jurisdiction of the Grand Jury, owing to
the constniction and bearing cf the stat
utes, but it is important to know the char
acter of the people who are trying to surge
to the front at the opening of the cam
paign, and that political tricksters of the
Mahoney and Martin Kelly type are out
hustling for what tnere is in it in the
name of Republicanism.
The trick sought to be perpetrated last
Saturday night was, further, managed by
political representatives of the railroad
company who are alert for advantage in a
degree seldom exhibited before.
The action of the majority of the State
Central committeemen of the Fourth Dis
trict last night upsetting the action taken
at their snap meeting of Saturday night is
a victory over the railroad politicians and
a victory for John D. Spreckels, who as a
member of the executive committees of
both the State and County Central com
mittees, and as a Republican leader is in
terested in the success and decency of the
Republican party.
The State Central Committee at its
meeting last Saturday afternoon adopted
a call for the State convention, which was
in effect a call for seven Congressional
conventions, the creation of which, by
primary elections or otherwise, was given
absolutely into the hands of the Con
gressional committees of the seven Con
gressional districts of the State. It was
further provided that where such Con
gressional committees do not exist they
should be created by the members of the
State Central Committee representing such
districts.
In some districts such Congressional
committees happened to have been created
by the Congressional conventions held at
the time of the last State convention, and
in other districts no such committees had
been appointed. The Fourth District was
one in which no Congressional committee
existed, and so it became the duty and. the
power of the members of .the State Central
Committee representing the eleven
Assembly districts composing the Fourth
Congressional District to create a new
Congressional committee of seven mem
bers, which should have exclusive and
original power to call, and, if it pleased, to
supervise and control a primary election
in its district for the selection of delegates
to the State convention.
After tbe adjournment of the meeting of
the State Central Committee last Saturday
afternoon. Senator J. H. Mahoney and
Martin Kelly proceeded to do politics as
politics should be done according to their
habit and understanding. The situation
presented to Senator Mahoney the oppor
tunity to do politics since the time when
one Sternberg and others steered false
registration in 1894, and were defended in
court under Mahoney's direction.
To Martin Kelly, of varied political in
famy, the opportunity was equal to and
reminiscent of in many respects tne time
when he beat Bill Higginu three points
and won his start in politics by capturing
a south-of-Market-street political meeting
by mounting a roof with a lot of firemen
and dropping first Chinese bombs and
then firemen through the skylight over
the president's table.
It happened that last Saturday J. H.
Mahoney and Martin Kelly, who now

travel together by day and by night, dn
cided to do politics by hustling together
such of the State Central Committeemen
representing the Fourth District as they
might manipulate to their own ends.
Each member of the State Central Com
mittee representing the Fourth District
had as much authority to call a meeting
as any of the other members.
Senator Mahoney hustled out notices of
a meeting of the delegation to occur at
the Baldwid Hotel that evening and with
Martin Kelly's assistance a meeting was
secured at which a forged proxy of Gus
tav Melsing of the Twenty-ninth District
was offered by Jake Shaen and accepted
without inspection or question. Jake
Shaen's vote on the forged proxy of a man
wno would have voted with a different ef-
feet and who has since repudiated and
condemned this use of his vote, gave the
majority which named the committee ap
pointed at that snap meeting in the rooms
of Senator Mahoney.
At that meeting in Senator Mahoney's
rooms there were present of the eleven
members of the State Central Committee
from the Fourth District W. S. Russell, I.
S. Cohen, William Smadeke, J. H. Ma
honey, A. Ruef, John Martin and T. C.
Duff. The proxy of J. G. Terryll was pre
sented by Frank Worth, the proxy of H.
C. Summers was presented by C. C. Curry
and the alleged proxy of Gustav Melsing
was presented by Jake Shaen.
By a vote of six to four the following
committee, named in advance, was ap
pointed as quickly as the motion could be
taken: W. H. Dimond, N. J.Williams,
Jacob Levi Jr., A. P. Kearney, A. Barn
hard, W. T. Howe and J. S. Spear. With
out the forged proxy of Gustav Melsing
but five out of the eleven members of the
State Central Committee of the Fourth
District would have been recorded in favor
of this action.
At the snap meeting last Saturday even
ing vigorous protests against the hasty
and snap action, as well as against the fact,
that the committee named represented but
three of the eleven districts, were pre
sented by Messrs. Duff, Curry, Cohen and
Smadeke, but they were silently ignored
and the vote declared.
Since last Saturday night the members
of the State Central Committee represent
ing the Fourth District have held consul
tations, and last night's meeting was a re
sult.
The meeting of Saturday night in
the rooms of Senator Mahoney gains
no prestige because of its being
the first one called. The general
resolution of the State Central Committee
provides that the members of the State
Central Committee representing any
Congressional district shall create a
Congressional committee when no such
committee exists in such district.
The members of the State Central
Committee reDresenting any district
have no organization, no one member is
more empowered to call the delegation to
gether than any other, and the getting to
gether of the committeemen representing
any district is hence a volnntary matter
resting generally with the majority. Hence,
if Senator Mahoney had succeeded in get
ting together six members oithe committee
the other night who would vote with him
the action he steered in behalf of the rail
road campaign and "push" politics might
have been held to be formally regular.
But the meeting held at 850 Market
street last night was attended by eight of
the eleven members of the State Central
Committee from the Fourth District,
either in person or by proxy, and the action
taken was the result of seven votes pres
ent.
Those present were the following:
Twenty-eighth District, W. S. Russell;
Twenty-ninth, Gustav Melsing; Thirtieth,
I. 6. Cohen; Thirty-first, William
Smadeke (proxy to C.W.Kyle); Thirty
second, Thomas C. Duff; Thirty-third,
H. C. Summers (proxy to Richard Spreck
els); Thirty-ninth, J. G. Terryll (proxy to
R. P. Barton); Forty-second, E. C.Hughes
(proxy to John T. Dare).
The absentees were: J. H. Mahoney,
Forty-third district : A. Reuf , Forty-fourth
district, ana John Martin, Fourty-fifth
district.
The meeting organized by electing
Thomas C. Duff chairman. Chairman
Duff made a brief and strong state
ment, declaring this the first regu
lar and legal meeting of the delegation
and declaring that at tbe meeting on Sat
urday evening he had found everything
cut and driea, and had entered a vigorous
protest against the proceedings.
After roilcall Qustav Melsing and John
T. Dare were appointed a committee on
proxies. On their report the proxies sub
mitted were accepted.
Gnstav Melsing then addressed the meet
ing in vigorous language, saying in the
course, of his remarks:
"At the meeting last Saturday evening
my proxy was accepted and voted entirely
without my knowledge, authoriza
tion or willingness, and I declare
it one of the most barefaced political
outrages that I have known in my
experience. Nobcdy was authorized to use
my vote and I repudiate that action now
as I have done ever since the meeting.
The first knowledge I bad of the meeting
I gained from the papers next morning,
and I learned that an outsider named
Jake Shaen was there and voted on an al
leged proxy from me."
Chairman Duff, who was present at the
meeting Saturday night, recited that a
paper had been flourished for an instant,
and had been declared a proxy from Mr.
Melsing without being inspected.
"However, I entered my protest,' said
Mr. i)uff, "in behalf of my district. But
Mr. Mahoney presented a number of
names, which he said had been 'indorsed
by a number of good P.epublicans," and
be moved their appointment."
"I desire to say,' 1 said C. W. Kyle, "that
any action that would voice the protest of
the majority here assembled against the
action of that meeting cannot be too strong.
It should be remembered that the
State Central Committee did not ad
journ until late in the afternoon, and
that a snap meeting, for which several
delegates were not duly notified, was held
that evening, and the proceedings were
cut and dried and not subject to due delib
eration. The voting of the proxy of Mr.
Melsing without warrant was a high
band outrage, and if the measure
of that night is carried out the majority
of the Republicans of the French district
will be without any representation at all.
Full notice of this meeting has been given
to everybody concerned and no underhand
work has been done."
1. 8. Cohen stated that at the Saturday
night meeting he had vigorously opposed
taking any action until the following
Monday evening and had insisted that the
Thirtieth District was not represented.
"To say that 1 am surprised is putting it
mildly," declared John T. Dare. "It is
impossible to think that Republicans in
this City are so short-sighted as to think
that such unfair proceedings carried out
in secret can be made to hold.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 1896.
Wliat was done last Saturday
uieht was practically done with four votes.
The city of San Francisco cannot do other
wise than Indorse the action of this meet
ing."
Mr. Dare then read the following resolu
tion, which was adopted by seven affirma
tive votes:
Whereas, The Republican State Central
Committee of the State of California, at its
meeting held on the 29th day of February,
1896, did adopt a resolution to the effect that
the members of the State Central Committee
from each Congressional district in which
there is no Congressional committee should
have power to appoint a committee of seven
persons from the residents of such district
to act as a Congressional committee thereof
in whom should be vested all the powers given
to such Congressional committees by the Na
tional Republican Central Committee, and
whereas, on the evening of the said 29th day
February, 1896, a portion of the members
of the State Republican Central Commit
tee from the Fourth Congressional District
attempted to hold a meeting of the members
of said State Central Committee from the said
Fourth Congressional District, and to appoint
said committee of seven persons, as provided
in said resolution, without having duly or at
all notified the other members thereof to be
present at said meeting; and whereas, the full
menbership of the said portion of the State
Central Committee were not notified of the
time and place of said meeting and were not
present thereat either in person or by proxy
and said meeting and the Droceedings had
thereat were therefore illegal and void, be it
therefore
Resolved, That the action taken at said meet
ing be and is hereby rescinded, and all pro
ceedings and acts of said meeting are, and are
hereby declared to be null and void and of no
effect, and that the appointment thereby of
the seven persons to serve as a Congressional
committee for the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict be and is hereby revoked, recalled and set
aside, and be it further
Resolved, That the following-named seven
persons, resident in the said Fourth Congres
sional District, be and tDey are hereby ap
pointed as the Congressional Committee of the
said Fourth Congressional District, with all
of the powers vested and to be vested
in such committees by the resolution
of the National Republican Committee
of December 14, 1895, and by the
resolutions of the State Central Committee
passed at the regular meeting thereof on
February 29, 1896, to wit: Nicholas Ohlandt,
Louis Pockwitz, George Pode, C. C. Bemia, R.
Rasmussen, F. Arata, Henry Leffmanu.
DR. BODKIN IS DEFIANT.
He Infers That the Court-Martial
Has Been "Fixed" by
Daniels.
The Surgeon of the Bear Will Now
Bring the Case Before Secre*
tary Carlisle.
Dr. T. P. Bodkin says the court-martial
in the case of Lieutenant Daniels and
Dorry is trying to whitewash them. He is
the chief witness against the accused. He
created a sensation yesterday by refusing
to answer the questions asked him while
on the witness stand and charging the
court with being biased.
Dr. Bodkin was the surgeon on the Bear
during a trip to the north. He was em
ployed at $125 a month simply for the trip.
He was much in the company of yonng
Daniels, and in his official charges filed
with the naval and treasury authorities
avers that he found the officer to be gay,
frovolous and even degrading at times;
that Daniels got drunk, and other
wise acted in a manner unbecoming an
officer of the United States revenue service.
Lieutenant Ross is defending Daniels
and it was with him that Dr. Bodkin had
the war of words yesterday. Ross had
asked the physician several questions
which had been prepared by Dr. Blue,
who had testified that the accused had not
suffered from a nervous disorder, and the
witness had refused to answer them. He
told Ross that he did not know what he
was talking about. Ross got mad. So did
Bodkin, and if the court-martial could
have adjourned and cleared the deck there
would have been a well-regulated "scrap."
Dr. Bodkin is not connected with the ser
vice, so he can speak freely. He said :
I am not getting a square deal in the investi
gation of the charges against Daniels and
Dorry. The officers are "whitewashing" the
case. Lieutenant Reynolds does not know how
to conduct an investigation-. He never made
an objection to a question propounded to a
witness by the defense, no matter how detri
mental it might have proved to the prosecu
tion's case. The charges of drunkenness have
already been whitewashed. In my letter to
Secretary Carlisle, I mentioned occasions in
Oonalaska, Unea, Sitka and Port Clarence
when these officers were intoxicated. The
court has stated that these occasions referred
to were when the officers had attended social
affairs, but they have virtually dropped the
charges as to Daniels and Dorry's conduct and
intoxication when they had not attended
social affairs. I am disgusted at the manner
in which this matter has been conducted.
Ex-Carpenter Kane of tne Bear testified
that Daniels had been intoxicated on
numerous occasions. On June 9, 1895,
when the revenue cutter had reached the
island of Unga, the lieutenant was very
drunk, and left the Bear flourishing a
bottle of whisky about his head. He (the
lieutenant) went all over the island sing
ing in a wild and insane fashion. Dr.
Bodkin sustained the evidence of the car
penter. The testimony was to the effect
that Lieutenant Dorry was so drunk
on June 28, 1895, that he had to be carried
from the quarterdeck to his bunk and cared
for until he got sober.
The sudden retirement of Dr. Bodkin
was the sensation of the day. He declares
that he will bring the charges directly
before Secretary Carlisle.
ITALIANS MOURN.
The News From Africa Plunges the
Latin Quarter in Gloom,
The Italian colony of San Francisco was
plunged into mourning yesterday by the
sad news of the disasters in Africa. All
day little other news was discussed in the
Latin quarter and the local Italian papers
devoted almost their entire space to en
larging on the event.
Commenting last night on the disaster
1/ Italia says: "It is lamentable above all
for the poor victims uselessly and perhaps
criminally sacrificed; our poor brothers,
dead by thousands, without knowing how
and why. It is lamentable for the unfor
tunate mothers of Italy, who to-day, as we
write, are weeping for the deaths of their
loved ones, or worse still are tormented
by doubt as to whether their sons have
fallen or not, torn by the thought of the
sufferings that the wounded may be suf
fering alone perhaps, or ill cared for on
the horrible plains of the Dark Continent."
PACIFIC KENNEL CLUB.
It Will Give a Grand Exhibition at the
Pavilion This Year.
The Pacific Kennel Club held a large
and enthusiastic meeting last evening at
the Occidental Hotel.
A communication was received from the
American Fox Terrier Club, requesting
that the Pacific Kennel Club intercede with
the American Kennel Club and astc that
body to vote against a resolution which
prohibits the docking of aogs.
No action on the matter was taken, be
cause the request was received too late for
the secretary of the club to instruct its
delegate in New York to comply with the
request.
The committee on bench-show affairs re
ported progress. The club looks forward
to the most successful exhibition of high
class dogs that has been seen in this City
since the inauguration of dog shows.
The world uses 3,000,500 steel pens per
day.
