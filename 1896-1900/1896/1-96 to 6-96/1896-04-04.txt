WEYLER SANCTIONS MURDERS.
Brutal Butcheries That Only Cause an
Increase of the Army Fight
ing for Freedom.
HAVANA, Cuba, April 1 (via Tarapa,
FJa., April 3). â Army preparations have
been pushed with great vigor for me past
month. General Weyler has given otiicers
and men no rest. His orders have been
peremptory and many a general has in
curred his displeasure by tardiness. The
result of these active otovementa nas been
to completely tire out a large portion of
the army in the field. The insurgents
have been kept moving, their camps have
been destroyed and a dozen of their hospi
tals have been burned during the month
that has just passed, but the Government
has not forced v single battle upon the
rebels. The only serious engagements
have been those in which the insurgents
have had the advantage of position or
numbers, as at Cuyajabos and Candelaria.
where they assumed the offensive and
defeated the regular troops of Spp.in.
There have been many rearguard skir
mishes, which appear in the Spanish offi
cial reports as battles and victories for the
crown, but which upon investigation a
number of tnera proved to be massacres of
unarmed citizens, and there have been
more tales of horrors committed than bat
tles fought in this island of Cuba during
the month of March. If a hundredth part
of the stories that reach here of the opera
tions of the columns of Generals Melquizo
and Bernal, and of Colonels Molina, Tort,
pequera and others, are true, the reason
why Geiural Weyler canceled all pisses
held by correspondents is plain.
Owners oi the estates report excesses
committed by detacned bodies of Spanish
troops in aii Darts of the island, and there
is no further talk of attempting to grind
sugar this year. The problem is how to
preserve the lives of employes and prevent
wanton destruction by the troops.
The Insurgents have gained more in the
past month than in any two tnat have
preceded it. A\ eyier's decree compeiling
people to abandon their homes in the in
terior'has driven many peaceable inhabi
tants into the rebel armies. The harsh
measures adopted toward suspects in
cities and towns have also increased the
number of recruits from families of the
better class in cities.
The landing of four important expedi
tions has given inspiration to the insur
gent army Their hopes were never
brighter. Hot weather is already here,
and the rains are not far off. The limited
time remaining for military operations
this spring makes it plain that Spain can
not crush the rebellion before the wet
season sets in, and the "-erious problem of
caring for the lives of her soldiers presents
itself. A ft^anisb officer says that the
losses of the army through fevers and
other sickness have been 12,000 since Sep
tember and over 25,000 during the year
ended March 1.
Generals Andrea and Madan have been
6ent back to Spain, making nine generals
who have been returned since General
Weyler arrived. General Obrejon is also
booked to return and General Pando, com
mander of the First Army Corps, has been
ordered back for allowing Gomez to enter
Santa (iara without fighting a battle. Gen
eral Suarez Valdez is also on the coast. He
is also in command of Pinar del Rio, and
and besides failing to suppress the rebel
lion in his section, he sent an impertinent
message to Weyler by heliograph. Weyler
cays he can get more active work out of
colonels than from generals, and the
exodus continue*. There is much dissatis
faction among officers of higher grade.
General Weyler has been in a highly
nervous state for several days and many
Stormy interviews between himself and
his men have taken place. His troubles
with the politicians arc just beginning.
H.e has assured the home Government
â¢ elections can be held in Cuba, and
Ihe Reformists and Autonomists, refusing
to take part, leaves the Union-Constitu
tion or Conservative, or Spanish party,
alone in the field.
Rumors that Weyler will be recalled are
persistent. Since ad v.ces that the United
States will not recognize the belligerency
of the Cubans General Wevler has begun
open executions of prisoners of war. Three
have been shot at Cabanas prison within a
week and more are doomed to the same
late. J. Frank Ci.ark.

. NEW ORLEANS, La.., ! April 3.â The fol
: lowing has'been received from Cuba by J.
Nelson PolhemuÂ«, local representative in
this city of the Cuban junta. Mr. Polbe
â  mus vouches for its authenticity:
"In the township of Jaruco, on the plan
tation of Morales, the troops of Colonel
Tort, in command of the rural guards, ar
rested four men and one woman on the
charge of being insurgent sympathizers
and then took them to the armory, where
the' men were beaten and subsequently
â  killed, as also was the woman, who re
. fused to state she was in connection with
the rebel forces. The crime is more hor
rible, =as the woman, .named Margarita
Pearosa, was soon to become a mother.

being reported as trying to escape, and the
forces being compelled to fire upon him.
"On the plantation Salvador, the prop
erty of the Count of Baretto. the soldiers
ot General Aldecoa's division maltreated
the women, wives aiid daughters of the
laborers, after having threatened their
male relatives with death, many
of whom were tied witnessing the
deed. This same thing happened in
the village of San Matias, near
Jaruco, where the forces of Colonel Tel
lerjico violated the women folk of the fam
ily of Jose Calabuche. On the Plantation
Calixto of San Antonio Hernandez, near
San Antonio de Jas Vegas, Captain Man
uel Ruis Adams of the Regiment of Isabel
shot to death an inoffensive crazy loon
who had ascended a tree and was throwing
cocoanuts at the troops.
"The troops under the command of Gen
eral Echague enteied the towns of Limar
and Zumidero, boasting that, they had sent
thirteen rebel soldiers to meet their fate
and showing their bloody arms as proof of
the butchery. Three miles from Zumi
dero, to my knowledge and to the knowl
edge of the commander of the Spanish
furces. Roberto Bermudez and" his division
ot the insurgents were encamped.
"I have made a careful inquiry into the
facts and find that the above are all true,
every iota ot them, and to further evi
dence the hatred which these poor Cubans
engender in the soldiers of the Spanish
army I will relate a statement made by a
Spanish officer (Cuban by birth) and the
speaker had been captured in Pinar del
Rio by General Maceo and after being pa
roled and returned his sword sent to Ha
vana.
"Lieueenant Corolly Pedroso of one of
the cavalry battalions made a statement
at the residence of Mr. Carlos Pedroso, in
the presence of various persons, that
he had struck down with his
sword two negroes, and further
added that when he left for the
field, he killed every Cuban he could get
hold of, even by the simplest charge, as
every Cuban was an insurgent at heart,
and that General Weyler had given in
structions to the commanders of the oper
ating columns to dispose of as many in
surgent sympathizers as possible, and that
he would stop any talk, and would stand
between the officers and the public, but
that the insurgents must be put an end to
at all hazards.
"To further appreciate the condition of
this country I will relate what I heard in
the city of Trinidad while there a few
aays ago. The Rev. Father Cuervory
Canonigo said: 'I believe that all the Cu
bans possible should De killed off and clear
the country and in that manner make
room for families which would be brought
over from Spain to Cuba. The negroes
and mulattoes should all be killed off si
lently and without exciting any comment
and their property confiscated. Therefore,
when we would bring families over from
Spain and colonize the island we could
give them this confiscated property
ana they could make a good start
in life. The Cubans who send rheir
children to the United States to be edu
cated should be taken hold of by the police
and quietly placed where they would do j
the least harm, because the Americans i
have the republican ideas which are the
real cause of the desire of the Cubans to
revolt. The Yankees have the only coun
try where sympathizers with the Cubans
are, and they are responsible for this war.'
"While at Trinidad I paid a visit to an
insurgent camp. I found ihat the wives
and daughters of a great many of the in- I
surgents were with them, and the clay fol

ment that when Havana shall be captured
the avenue of Carlos 111 shall be
known as American avenue, and that the
statues of the leading Senators and Rep
resentatives who had defended the Cubans
be placed at intervals on this plaza. Those
women are not camp women, but some of
the ladies who months ago were shining
social lights of the cities of Matanzas, Car
denas, Cienfuegos, Santiago, Camague.y
and Havana. The camps were orderly,
well-established discipline being noted,
and above all hygienic measures pervading.
ENTITLE/* TO HECOGMTIOS.
Hitt of Illinois Makes a Telling Argu
ment for Cubans.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3â The
prospect of a further debate on the CÂ«ban
question rilled the galleries of the House
before the hour of meeting to-day, but the
interest among members was not so great,
Judging from the attendance, not more
than half the seats being filled when
Chaplain Gouden invoked the divine bless
ing.
At 2:30 o'clock Hitt called up the report
of the conference committee on the Cuban
resolutions. The report recommended tne
adoption of the following resolutions as
passed by the Senato : -
Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress a
condition of public war exists between the
Government of Spain and the government pre
vailing and for some time maintained by the
force of arms by the people of Cuba, and that
the United States of America should maintain
a Btrict neutrality between the contending
powers, according to each all the rtghts of
belligerents in the ports and territory of the
United State?.
Resolved, further. That the friendly offices of
the United States should ba offered by the
President to the .Spanish Government for the
recognition of the independence of Cuba.
Hitt immediately took the floor and said :
"The two resolutions which the conference
committee has asrreed to, propose first,
that the United States should accord to
the people of Cuba belligerent rights, and
secondly tender the friendly offices of the
United States to the Spanish Government
for the recognition of Cuban independ
ence."
It was true that the second resolution,
as adopted by the House, was in a more
cautious form than that the House pro
posed, and Spain, unless seeking a quarrel,
could not hare relented such a proposi
tion, while tde resolution of the Senate,
proposing independence, was more exposed
to captious objection. But when a war be
tween a parent Government and a de
pendency has been going on for a consid
erable time, and when separation was the
best solution of the war, the mediation or
friendly counsel of another nation to solve
an existing struggle by recognizing inde
pendence, might be a truly friendly act,
and this in fact has often been done. In
cases almost precisely parallel to this,
when Spain was at war with her depend
encies on this continent in the early part of
this century, our Government had intact
taken the very .step proposed in this
second resolution. He referred also to the
action of President Grant during the ten
years' struggle between Spain and the peo
ple of Cuba, from 1868 to 1878, when he,
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, APRIL 4, 1896.
Boss Raineyâ Learning steps for "Lanigan's ball," are you? Well, I'll
teach you to dance I
through our Minister at Madrid, offered
the good offices of the United States, to
bring that war to a close on the basis of
Cuban independence.
The immediate recognition of belliger
ency was a far more important and practi
cal question. That was the point covered
by the tirst resolution, both of the Senate
and of the House. In mere bulk the peti
tions presented to Congress favoring this
course had exceeded those upon any other
subject for y.ears.
On the ether side, individual members,
especially of the committee charged with
the subject, had received letters from citi
zens deprecating any action whatever.
These letters were almost always from
those who call themselves business men,
brokers and financial men, who were op
posed to any agitation or discussion of a
foreign question and seem to care little
about the Cubans or Spanish, but chiefly
about the market.
Toe unmistakable voice of the people of
the United States, as expressed in the
enormous majority given in the House,
262 to 17, was in favor of recognition of the
beiJigerency of the Cubans. It was aeainst
this tbat all the Spanish influences in this
country were most strenuously exerted.
It was to this hope of recognition of bel
ligerency that all friends of Cuba turned.
The reason was plain. It would be of in
estimable assistance to the Cuban cause.
It would give them a flag. It would give
them a status in the world. If they pro
cured a vessel and entered New York
harbor to-morrow with their lone-star tlag
they would be liable to be treated as
pirates.
The Spanish Minister would imme
diately claim that this should be done, but
with a recognized flag they could enter as
the ships from all countries do. They
could buy munitions of war openly. They
could buy supplies of every kind. Men
could go openly if not in armed expedi
tions to join them. They could negotiate
loans, negotiate them as openly as the
Spaniards could do now. In 1815 the
Spanish Minister, De Onis, when the
colonies in South America were struggling
just as the Cubans are now, demanded
that our ports should be closed to the
revolutionists under the nag of Buenos
Ayres, Carthagena and the Mexican Con
gress and other places which he said had
"revolted against the authority of the
King, ray master." He denounced them
as pirates and bandits and demanded that
they should be so treated. President Madi
son disregarded the belligerency of the
strugghne colonists. He directed the
Secretary of State, Monroe, to make the
calm answer on the 29th of January, 1816.
The President thought it proper some time
past to give orders to the collectors not to
make the flags of any vessel a criterion or
condition of its admission into tho ports
of the United States, and he replied to the
half-savage demand of the Spanish Minis
ter that the revolutionists be treated as
pirates in these dignified and noble words:
â¢'All that your Government had a right to
claim of the United States was that they
should not interfere in the contest or pro
mote by any active service the success of
the revolution, admitting that they con
tinued to overlook the injuries received
from Spain and remained at peace.
This right was common to the colonists.
I With equal justice might they claim that
I we would not interfere to their disadvan
tage; tbat our ports should remain open
to both parties as '.hey were before the
commencement of the struggle; that our
Jaws regulating commerce with foreign
nations should not be changed to their
injury. On these principles the United
States has acted.
Was not the success of the Cubans now
probable? For a year they had baffled the
armies of Spain." In a recent statement by
the Spanish Minister, addressed to the
people of the United States, he snid that
Spain had sent 125,000 men to Cuba. With
this great army more than forty war ves
sels had been co-operating to shut the
Cubans in and s*ubdue them. Far from
being subdued, they had fought on success
fully for a year, each month and each
week pressing forward, bringing province
after province under their power until
their authority had extended over GOO
miles from the eastern to the western end
of the island, and tne Spanish forces were
to-day largely penned in the cities.
The Spanish newspaper organs had been
constantly claiming that the republic had
no capital, and if one were pretended they
would at once capture it. "But, said Hitt,
"we see publications from Cisneros the Pres
ident of the CubanJÃepublic at Cubitas,
their capital, which they have held undis
turbed for nearly a year- undisturbed be
cause they defied Spanish power â while
the dispatches in this morning's papers
give accounts of engagements in the en
virons of Havana. It looks from this
distance as though General Weyler in
i Havana had more cause to be uneasy than j
President Cisneros in his capital at Cubi- ]
tas.
"This is a far greater war. than the ten
years' war of 18(58 to 1878, with which it is
so often compared. That was confined to
the eastern end of the island. The revo
lutionists never established their power j
far from the province of Santiago. The '
armies of Gomez and Maceo, working in j
perfect harmony, have fought their way i
steadily through province after province
until they have come into Pinar del Rio at
the western end of the island. The politi- I
cal and military organization has been â 
harmonious, effective and victorious from j
the first. It is exactly what President j
Monroe called 'a movement of such a !
steady and consistent form as to make i
success probable.' And now, as in the
time of Monroe, they should have ex- ,
tended to them the rights to which they i
are entitled by the law of nations as equal i
parties to a civil war."
Hitt denied that the Cubans had full
representation with the Parliament of j
Spain. The great majority of the Cuban j
deputations to the S'tanisb Cortes con- |
sisted of Spaniards from Cuba, not Cuban*.
Hitt said in conclusion:
"It is sometimes objected that we ought
not to encourage the Cubans to separate
government as they would simply enter
upon anarchy and successive revolutions,
as so often has happened with Spanish- j
American colonies. But in fact Cuba j
differs from all the others except Chile in !
that two-thirds of its population are of j
European origin. Chile and Cuba are the !
.only two spots in Spanish-America where I
the Spanish race colonized in the fashion
in which the Anglo-Saxons colonizedâ by
transplanting their people and building
up their own race. The million white
people of Cuba, once organized into an
independent government, will soon settle
into suitable conditions and enter upon a
career of prosperity. It is our duty to
treat them to-day with fairness â to
observe a neutrality that is real. Americans
are descendants of those who struggled
throueli a contest against tyranny
like that to-day in Cuba should not be false
to the memory of their fathers or to the
traditions and spirit of their history. We
are under no obligations to favor Spam and
oppression as against Cuba and freedom.
Remember how Spain invaded and seized
upon Santo Domingo when the United
States was engaged in the War of the
Rebellion. It was disclosed in the debates
in the Spanish Cortes afterward that the
occupation ot Santo Domingo was entered
upon expressly to thwart the influence of
the United States and prevent our ob
taining a station at Samana. It was in
this spirit that Spain so early recognized
the belligerency of the Confederates, a
month before blood was shed in battle. It
was done in co-operation with Louis
Napoleon, who, also {kftrsaing the same
scheme of oppression, took advantage of
our troubles to overthrow the republic of
Mexico and set up an empire there. We
have no debt of gratitude, and should be
influenced by no sentiments but those of
justice and that enlightened self-interest
which is the true guide in the policy of
nationp.
"When this vote has been given, as it
will be overwhelmingly by the House,
concurring with the Senate in expressing
the will of the people of the United States,
we cannot doubt that the executive will
act and obey the voice of tlie Nation and
that we will speedily hoar that the Presi
dent has recognized the belligerency of
the struggling Cubans. The waning cause
of Spain has been apparent from week to
week for two months past."
Hitt was interrupted by Patterson (D.)
of Tennessee, who asked what proportion
of the 1,600,000 population in Cuba had
engagÂ°d in the movement to secure the
independence of the island.
Hitt stated that a communication to the
House from the Secretary of State showed
the number of troops in tbe rieid last
August was 30,000, one-third of which
were well armed. Since cominj? into the j
House to-day Hilt said he had been
I handed a statement by Mr. Rappleye, the
correspondent of the New York Mail and
Express, who had just returned from '
Cuba, which showed that the Cuban army
now numbered over 60,000 men.
Patterson then inquired w-hat number
Of Cubans had enlisted in the Spanish
army, which Hitt said he could not an
swer with deliniteness.
Patterson said the thought he had was
that if the people of Cuba, with substan
tial unanimity, desired their autonomy
and independence, they ought to have it,
and that Spain should not be permitted to
hold the territory of such people by sub
jugation. [Applause.]
Hitt spoke a few minutes more than an
hour, and at the close of his remarks was
warmly applauded.
Hyde (R.) of Washington asked Hitt ta
; state if the President should not take any
action upon the resolutions, whether or not
they would be entirely nugatory, except
merely as an expression of sentiment.
Hitt replied that he could not recognize
the possibility of such a condition of af
| fair 9 and therefore declined to express an
\ opinion.
Boutelle(R.) of Maine referred to the
fact that when tbis subject was first
brought before the House, February 27, he
interposed an objection against the hur
i ried and inconsiderate action then pro
posed. He did not suppose tben that he
i was the only member who opposed such
hasty action, but the press of the country
had given him a wide prominence in con
nection with what it termed "arresting
action" on the Cuban resolutions. He did
I not complain of that prominence then,
| and did not now. For, if any vindication
I of his position was needed, it was fur
nished by the appearance of these resolu
tions in the Hoo.se more than a month
i later for further consideration. That
| demonstrated that somebody, somewhere,
| *ad been of the opinion that a question of
this importance should not be voted upon
and passed while members of the House
were hurrying out of the hall, hatted and
coated, to their belated dinners.
Boutelle reviewed the history of the par
liamentary progress of the resolutions,
i and expressed the opinion that it was not
I the intention of the movers of the resolu
| tions to commit Congress to any d efinite
! and decided policy. Congress, he said,
j had the power to put the resolutions in
| such a form as to compel the President to
act upon them, but that had been care
fully avoided. No joint resolution was
before the House and none had been. It
was as well known as anything possibly
could be that the President did not believe
that a state of belligerency exists in the
island of Cuba.
Referring to tbe matter of public senti
ment, alleged to be supporting the resolu
tions. Boutelle said he did not claim to
speak for the entire American public, but
he had not received in the course of the
discussion a single letter from a man of
reliable, thoughtful, considerate judgment
expressing an opinion in favor of the
United States embroiling itself in this
contention in the island of Cuba. He
said people knew how this alleged public
sentiment was created and fostered, es
pecially by a portion of the press which
lives and thrives upon sensationalism.
Boutelie said there was a tendency on
the part of some Representatives in Con
gress, as well as other people, to jump to
the conclusion that it is the duty of the
United States to step in and right every
wrong that is brought to public notice. He
denied it. It was not the duty of the
United States to be the Don Quixote of the
earth. Even if the duty were conceded
the country did not have the ability to
perform that part.
Boutelle said the House was in duty
bound not to act upon a matter of such
great importance without full knowledge
of the facts. What were the Representa
tives doing here? he asked. Why did they
not try to elevate and lead public senti
ment? The people were looking to them
for light and guidance, and they ought to
know more than has been vouchsafed to
the House before taking any action on a
subject which might lead the country into
a complication of war with a foreign
country. He believed he was in sympathy
with men anywhere trying to gain their
freedom; but it was a strange condition,
in his opinion, when the tacit admission
was made in the Republican party here
that with our constitution and laws we
could not maintain the liberties of a large
proportion of our own people when the dec
laration was made in every contested elec
tion case that over a large area of this
country a portion of its citizens were de
nied their most preciou3 rights; it was
strange, he said, that it was deemed the
duty of the United States to dash across
the Gulf of Mexico and establish and
| maintain the freedom of the mulatto in
} surgents in Cuba.
There were no facts here, he said, suffi
cient to justify the House adopting these
I resolutions. He was free to say that the
administration had not received facts
which justified the President and his ad
visers in recognizing a state of belligerency
in Cuba. That belligerent rights had not
been eranted to the Cubans was, in his
opinion, ample proof that the President
had no ground upon which to act. Bou
teile closed his speech by quoting from the
documents and writings of General Grant,
Secretary Hamilton Fish and George
Washington to sustain his contention that
to grant belligerent rights to the Cuban
insurgents or to interfere with Spain to
secure the independence of the island at
this time would be unwise and an un
founded action.
Buuteile spoke nearly an hour and a half
and held the attention of the House
thoughout, and was generally applauded
at the close.
Skinner (Pop.) of North Carolnia was
the last speaker of the afternoon, elo
quently pleading for bringing Cuba under
the stars and stripes.
ALL WORKIXG TOGETHER.
Cheering AÂ«irÂ» from the Cuban Army
Received by the Junta.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.â "A1l the
officers of the Cuban army are working
together with the best of feeling," said F.
G. Pierra of the Junta yesterday. "There
have been no indications of dissension.
That there is such harmony of action is
our best guarantee of success. If our
Spanish friends were as united as to meth
ods of carrying on the war, they would
give us more trouble.
"Is General Gomez dead? Well, he was
alive three days ago; that is the best I can
say. There have been rumors for several
weeks that he was dying of fever. They
are false. We received a letter from Gomez
a short time ago, in which he said that his
officers had not knowingly destroyed any
American property on the island. He said
further that if any such property had been
destroyed, he was sure the Cuban republic
would pay for it.
"Gomez thinks Weyler is less dangerous
to the cause than Campos was. 'His acts
and his reputation make friends for us,' he
writes. 'Maceo has sent word to n3 that
on his part the campaign will be kept up
through the summer, which is a time
when the Spanish forces will be incapaci
tated for fighting on account of not being
acclimated."

Spain Worried by the Humor of Trouble
With Uncle Sam.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.â A special
dispatch to the Herald from Madrid says:
A rumor is in circulation here to the effect
that the United States would send a
squadron to Barcelona if Spain continued
her preparations against Cuba. The
rumor is so persistent that the following
ministerial denial has been issued : "The
Ministry emphatically denies that there is
any foundation for the rumor that interna
tional difficulties have arisen which im

or the arming of trans-Atlantic steamers
as cruisers."

Premier Bourgeois and His Cabi
net Not Discouraged by
Interpellation.
In the Senate a Resolution Is Adopted
Refusing to Give a Vote of
Confidence.
PARIS, France, April 3. â An inter
pellation on the Government's foreign
policy was submitted in the Senate to-day.
M. Bourgeois, Prime Minister and Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, asked that the ques
tion be deferred, as he could give no reply
beyond that which he had made in the
Chamber of Deputies yesterday. He
added that the adjournment of the
interpellation would not lessen the
Senate's rights, while it would give the
Government the authority and strength
necessary to pursue its negotiations re
garding the Egyptian and other foreign
questions. The Senate refuoed to agree to
M. Bourgeois' proposal, whereupon the
Prime Minister declared that he should
make no reply to the interpellation, hav
ing no further explanation to furnish.
The following resolution was then sub
mitted:
The Senate, noting the declaration of the
Government that it cannot add to its explana
tion to the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday,
and rcgreting that those explanations are in
sufficient, refuses to granr the Government a
vote of confidence and passes the order of the
day.
This was adopted by a vote of 157 to 77.
The Senate adjourned until April 22. Im
mediately thereafter the Minister* retired
and held a council at the Foreign Office.
It is not expected that they will resign.
A delegation from the Senate and Cham
ber of Deputies have visited M. Bourgeois
and assured him of their esteem and con
fidence.
The Cabinet decided unanimously that
the vote of confidence adopted by the

Who Sent Him to an
Asylum.

ton, 60 years of age, porter at the board
ing-house of Adolph Meyer, at 349 Elm
street, dropped dead just after eating his
supper to-night, ana Meyer is looked uron
with suspicion of having poisoned hjm.
Mrs. Mever is also sick, and it is believed

charged from an insane asylum, where his
wife sent him, James Fenton having been
used as a principal witness. Meyer, it is
claimed, has had a grudge against the two
for placing him in the asylum, and he is

DR. CAMPBELL UNDEB ARREST*
The Medical Director of the Asylum
in Trouble for Failure to File
a Certificate.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., April 3.â
The habeas corpus proceedings brought by
Attorney F. F. Gallardo to secure the reÂ«
Jease of Judge Huse from the Highlands
Asylum, has brought forth serious devel*
opments. As a result of the case, Dr. M.
B. Campbell, medical director of the
asylum, was to-day arrested. The charge
against Dr. Campbell is failure to register
his certificate as a practicing . physician in
San Bernardino County; but back of this
there is believed to be an intention on the
part of Judge Huse's friends to secure a
thorough renovation of the institution
and an investigation of the methods of itg
officials and employes.
A dramatic scene was enacted in Judge
Otis' court to-day during the progress of
the case. Gallardo, the attorney for and
friend of Judge Huse, was upon the stand.
During his examination District Attorney
Spreckei sarcastically asked why, if the
aged jurist had been so horribly maU
treated at the asylum as Gallardo claimed,
some evidence to that effect had not been
introduced. Up to this time Judge
Huse had been a very attentive
listener, keeping his eyes fixed upon
every witness. When Jhe District
Attorney asked the question, the Judge
moved back in his chair and, putting one
foot against the table in front of him, he
pulled up his trousers and underwear to
the knee, disclosing a leg covered by a
mass of scars from the ankle to the knee.
For fully ten minute? he described to the
court the way the wounds were inflicted
ami the effect they had upon nim.
Galiardo proved a shrewd witness. He
was asked in regard to the vast property
interests of Judge Huse at Santa Barbara
and San Francisco, and his questioner in
quired if there was not danger ot the prop
erty being scattered after Judge Huse was
committed, it not being in the hands of a
guardian. Gallardo said there was. Then
be was asked why he bad not applied for a
guardian for Judjie Huse. His answer was:
"Because to do so I would have to make
an affidavit that Jndge Huse was insane,
and that I have never considered him to
be."
Attorney Gallardo reiterated the charge
that there was a plot to rob Judge Huse of
his landed interests.
Dr. Dolan, the assistant superintendent
of the asylum and Supervisor Kimball,
were examined to-day. Both testified that
Judge Huse was harmless, as far as the
life and property of others was concerned,
and that they did not believe that he would
harm himself. His only failing was that
he persisted in picking at his clothes and
destroying them. Attorney Galiardo asked
why they opposed releasing him. Both
witnesses answered that it would be quite
dangerous to do so, which was in direct
contradiction to their previous admissions.
The habeas corpus proceedings have at
tracted iare;e crowds to the courtroom, and
some of the testimony places the asylum
management in an unfavorable light. Par
ticularly thrilling was the pitiful story of
the old Juage this afternoon, when he de
scribed the brutal treatment which he and
Attorney Gallardo claim he received. In
terest has been added to the case by the
arrest of Dr. Campbell.
While the neglect to file his certificate
was probably an oversight, the case against
him is certain to be contested vigorously.
When asked while on the stand as to his
motive in having Dr. Campbell arrested.
Attorney Gallardo replied :
"My motive was this: Because 1 have
the right to attack in any way I can and
weaken trie influence of those who are op*
posed to Judge Huse's interests."
The case will be continued to-morrow.
BULLETS FOR WHITECAPS
Farmer Eckston Gives a Band
of Masked Men a Very
Warm Reception.
Now Some of His Neighbors Are Hob
bling About Complaining of
Rheumatic Troubles.
WICHITA, Kaxs., April 3.â Whitecaps
served notice on Jack Eckston, near Bayne
viile. last week, that he must leave the
county in tive days. Their grievance was
the reported cruelty of Eckston to his
little crippled child. Eckston paid no heed
to the notice.
The night after the expiration of the
five days a band of a dozen masked and
armed men stole up toward Eckston'a
house, supposedly with murderous intent.
The farmer was on the watch and pro
posed to give them a warm reception. HÂ«
hid himself behind an outbuilding and
let fly with a repeating rifle, aiming only
to cripple them. They fled in a panio
after several had been wounded.
To-day several neighbors whom Eck
ston had thought to be his best friends are
hobbling about on crutches and complain
ing of serious rheumatic trouble. Eckstoa
will not prosecute and has no fears of
further molestation.2

Ballington Booth Talks of
the Work of the New
Army.
THOBOUGHLY AMERICAN
Labors to Be Performed Similar
to Those Carried On by
the Salvationists.
BOTH ORGANIZATIONS NEEDED
But No Matter What Happens the
Ex-Commissioner Will Never Re
turn to His Father's Fold.
BUFFALO. N. V., April 3.â "No matter
what happen?, and no matter what pres
sure is brought to bear, I shall never re
turn to the old organization," said Bal
lington Booth* this afternoon. Concerning
me new organization General Booth said
that it is to be thoroughly American
throughout. Its plan of organization is
very tsimilar to that of the United States
army. The officers will have similar titles
and all the terms used are to be American.
"The work we shall do will be in many
respects similar to that done by the Salva
tion Army, for we believe there is abun
dant room for both armies to labor. In
deed, we have no wish to injure or thwart
the old organization in any way.
"In addition to this, we shall labor
amonj three classes of people whose con
ditions have of late Jain heavily on our
hearts. There are rirst the men who are
employed on the great, rivers of this
country. Then the many intelligent
people in the prisons who have got
themselves there by some deed committed
jn a moment of passion. Among these
there is a large number of well-educated
people whose prisons we mean to pene
trate in order to save their souls, and
then, lastly, we intend to work among the
laboring men.''
Speaking of gaining recruits from the
Salvation Array, he said: "Of course, I
cannot tell how many will come to us
from the old organization. We don't urge
them to come, for we don't want them
unless they come of their own accord."
WILL, STVIty THE POOR.
Booth. Tucker TaHc* of the Work Before
Hitn Here.
NEW YOflK, N. V., April 3.â The first
tiling that Commissioner Booth-Tucker
did when he reached the office at Salvation
Army headquarters yesterday morning
was to send for the army's attorney to find
out what he would have to do, where tie
would have to go and when he could go to
take the iirst step toward becoming an
American citizen. The commissioner got
the information, and by to-morrow night
at the latest he will have taken out his
first papers.
After that matter was arranged, the
commissioner was introduced to all the
members of the headquarters staff whom
he had not met, and then, with the assist
ance of two or three staff officers, mapped
out a tour of the United States which he
and Mrs. Booth-Tucker will make soon
after t\ie Carnegie Hall reception, next
Thursday night. The first place visited
will be Chicago. When this tour is com
pleted, Commissioner Booth-Tucker will
set himself to work on what he calls a
social scheme for America.
"I take it for granted," he said yester
terday, "that there is poverty in this coun
try, notwithstandidg its great wealth. It
is to the problem of tho amelioration of
the condition of the American poor that I
shall give most careful and" prayerful
study. In the first place 1 shall make it
ray particular business to obtain a per
sonal knowledge of the condition of the
poor in the great cities. I shall go among,
and, if necessary, live among them.
I shall try to obtain a correct
notion of the best way to give
them practical help ar.d make their
lives blighter and better. I shall, at the
same time, make a careful study of all the
Government statistics bearing on the sub
ject, and I shall read all the literature on
the condition of the poor in this country
that I can find.
"When I have obtained a knowledge of
the poorer classes and their needs, I will
formulate a scheme which I hope will be
of much practical benefit to the poor of
America. It should be understood that
any scheme that may be formulated is not
intended to make any converts to the Sal
vation Army. If it does so all the better.
But it is our purpos* first to alleviate
misery. Then if we can reach the souls
of these people we will be doubly grateful."

DRAGGED INTO A FILTHY DEN.
Terrible Experience of a Young Woman in
the Negro Quarter of
Haver hill.
HAVERHILL, Mass., April 3.â The
story of a great crime has just come to
light. Ethel Mains, a beautiful young
woman of good family, has just been found
after a mysterious disappearance of four
days. Slie is prostrated at her home as a
result of her terrible, experience. She
was drugged, assaulted and crueliy treated
by negroes, and after being imprisoned in
a foul and loathsome opium den was cast
into the street half-naked and her mind
wrecked.
Thursday night John Daanty, a railroad
brakeman, discovered the poor girl wan
dering aimlessly about the freight yards.
She had nothing on but a torn and tat
tered skirt and a threadbare corset cover.
Hatless, with her hair flying wildly and her
features distorted, she was only the shadow
of the former handsome daughter of one
of the city's best families. She could
hardly speak, and in her incoherent muru
blinzs could tell little of herself.
The brakeman took her home, where,
after careful treatment by the family pby
sians, she was able to tell the awful story.
While passing through the negro quarter
on her way home on Saturday night she
was suddenly seized from behind by two
negroes, who threw a bag over her bead
and carried her bodily upstairs into a
a dirty opinm joint, <vheie she was drugged
ana forced to drink liquor. There was two
white men there, too. Then she was
brutally assaulted. Her clothes were taken
away from her and when she was dis
carded she had barely enough to cover her
bruised body.

Four Women to Participate In the Metho
ilint Episcopal Conference.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 3. â Four
women will sit as lay delegates in the gen
eral conference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, which will assemble here May 1,
and have a voice in its deliberations. This
is practically the decision of the church
as represented by the votes already taken
in the annual conference throughout the
country. Its definite decision must, of
course, await action by the general con
ference.
The annual conferences have been vot
ing on the question, and all throngh-the
West the majorities have been overwhelm
ingly in favor of the women. Eight con
ferences were in session this week, and
seven remain to be held next week. Most
of these are in the East, where the ser.ti
ment has been against women, but none
of them will exhibit a decided change of
opinion.
But the question, although as good as
settled already according to the piesent
outlook, will be in the coming general con
ference, as it has been in some confer
ences in the past, the one question over
shadowing all others. Consideration of it
will make the general conference of 1896
the most interesting and exciting session
held in years, and formal and deti nite dis
position* of it will mark a crisis in the his
tory of the Methodist church.
TO MAINTAIN THE PRICES
Second Secret Conference of the
Bessemer Steel Manufac
turers in New York.
It Is Proposed to Shut Out Middlemen
and Spectators Who Have
Caused Mischief.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 3.â The con
ference of Bessemer-steel Manufacturers
which was opened at the Hotel "Waldorf
yesterday ended to-day. The proceedings
were, as on yesterday, secret. George T.
Oliver of Pittsburg told a reporter that the
manufacturers had accomplished the ob
ject for which they bad met.
"The manufacturers decided to maintain
the price of steel for the present at $20 per
ton," said Oliver. "There have been no
restriction made as to the amount of steel
which shall be manufactured by any par
ticular firms, but it will be understood that
all will exercise good judgment in seeing
to it that the market is not too greatly
overstocked. Business is to be conducted
in accordance with the demand and sup
ply.
"Special care will be taken to do away
with the manipulation of the market by
middlemen and speculators, who have
heretofore caused much mischief by the
manipulation "of pricey. The manufact
urers "will so conduct their business as to
effectually put a stop to the losses which
they have sustained of late. Honest
competition will be encouraged, but
the influence of middlemen will
be restricted bo that the interests of both
manufacturers and consumers will be ade
quately protected. All negotiations shall
be conducted by and for the producer as
the contracting party on one hand and the
consuming purchaser on the other hand.
The advance in the price of pigiron is to
be met by a corresponding advance in the
price of steel."
OF INTEREST TO THE COAST.
Jterim Arrived too Late to I'revent River
Appropriation*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â Robert
T. Devlin of Sacramento, attorney of the
Anti-Debria Association of California, ar
rived at the Ebbitt House to-night. It is
understood that he came on to oppose the
appropriation of $250,000 for the construc
tion of restraining works at Deguerre
Point, on the Yuba River, but he is one
day too late, for the bill was reported to
day and is now before the House.
Mr. Devlin was very much disappointed
when he found the bill bad been com
pleted. He is discouraged over the out
look, for he finds that the entire California
delegation is heartily in favor of the ap
propriation. He was informed that both
Senators and all the Representatives from
California had united in a letter to the
committee favoring the measure.
Mr. Devlin was further informed that
the River and Harbor Committee had
acted on the question after reading all of
the letters, memorials, petitions and other
arguments presented by the Anti-Debris
Association, and furthermore that the de
cision of Judge Sawyer in the North
Bloomfield case had been made known to
the committee. Mr. Devlin was very
much disappointed to learn that the com
mittee bad acted, after being so thor
oughly informed by both sides. There
seems' to be no doubt but that the report
of the committee will pass the House and
be concurred in by the Senate.
Pensions have been granted as follows:
California: Original â Charles Barry, Veter
ans' Home, Napa; Robert E. Smith, Los
Angeles. Original widow â Margaret Hub
bard, San Francisco. Mexican War
widow â Mavearetta A. Decatur, San Diego.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
HEED REVERSES
ONE OF HIS RULES
A Majority of the Actual
Membership Declared
a Quorum.
VACANCIES DON'T COUNT
The Speaker Overrules All the
Objections and Receives
Applause.
PENSION BILLS PASS QUICKLY.
Appropriations Made in the River and
Harbor Bill as Reported to
the House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â The
House to-day passed thirty-eight private
pension bills which had been favorably
acted upon at previous Friday night ses
sions. In tho course of this part of the
proceedings Speaker Reed reversed his
famous ruling in the Fifty-first Congress,
which has been the subject of much con
troversy, and declared that a majority of
the actual membership of the House con
stituted a quorum. In the Fifty-first Con
gress he held that it required a majority of
all the members of the House to make a
quorum, irrespective of vacancies. Hooker
(R.) of New York reported the river and
harbor bill for the year ending June 1,
1897, which will be called up on Monday.
A bill authorizing the erection of a
bridge over the Mississippi River at St.
Louis was passed, and Mr. Pickler (R.) of
South Dakota demanded the regular order,
which was, this being Friday, the consid
eration of bills reported from the com
mittee of the whole at Friday night ses
sions.
The first bill was read and Tickler
moved the previous question. Erdnian
(D.) of Pennsylvania made the point of no
quorum on the voteâ l 27 to 6. A quorum
was counted and tho previous question
ordered, and on the passage of the bill j
Erdman demanded a vote of ayes and
noes, but only twenty-two members joined
him in the request, an insufficient num- i
ber. The bill was passed.
On the next bill Erdman again made the
point of no quorum, but the Speaker said :
"The chair overrules the objection, stating j
to tne House that evidently a quorum is
present."
The announcement was received with i
applause and the passage of the remaining j
, bills on the calendar proceeded without |
serious delay or interruption. Upon an
other vote Erdman again made the point
of no quorum, and the Speaker, after
counting, said, "There are 173 presentâ a
quorum."
This was a reversal of his famous deci
sion in the Fifty-first Congress, about
which there has been much controversy
! and which was followed in later Con
presses. The entire number of Represen
tatives would be 357. of which 179 would
be a majority, but there are two vacan
cies, leavinc the actual membership 355, of
which 178 is a majority.
Richardson (D.)of Tennessee questioned
the Speaker, saying that his decision was
in conflict with a ruling made by him in
the Fifty-first Congress, and asking if it
was the intention to reverse that. Speaker
Reed responded that it was his intention
to make the ruling as anuounced.
The thirty-eight bills were then passed
in an hour.
At the night session there was a quorum
of members present, who in committee of
the whole recommended favorable action
upon ten private, pension bills and that
three others lie on the table. Before ad
journing until to-morrow at 10:30 o'clock
two of the bills were pussed in the House.

LIVES LOST IN FLOODS.
Many Persons Perish in the Rush
of Waters Following a
Cloudburst.
Hundreds of Buildings Carried Away
From Unlucky Kentucky
Farmers.
BOONEVILLE, Kt., April 3.-Furtber
particulars just received here from the
territory in Clay and Owsley counties
show that it may be several days before
the complete li_t of the persona drowned
in Monday's cloudburst can be yiven.
Tne known dead are: Mary Garrett,
Mrs. George Gepson and three children,
Win. Burns and two children, Mrs. Wade
Narders and two children, and two un

STRIFE AT A CHRISTIAN CHURCH.
Pastor Hall Declines to Quit, and an Elder
Is Assaulted at a Lively
Meeting.
DECATUR, 111., April 3.â Key. JMr.
Hall, pastor of the Christian church, has
been in trouble with the church board for

parties tried to get to them to assist the
gentlemen, and a riot seemed imminent.
The police were called in by the pastor
and restored order. The old board was
expelled and new members elected. The
pastor remains at the church.

and wrecking the engine and cars. The
dead are: Patrick Flaherty, day caller,
and Frank SaKsgaver, a boiler-maker.
Both men were badly crushed.
Yard engine 1104 was crossing the bridge
and the men on it did not notice the de

running back at a high speed. Where
the accident occurred the track is about
ninety feet above tne river.
ESC A FROM THE ICE.
Colonel JVVrjf JHd JVo< Perish in the Rainy
River Accident.
CROOKSTOX, Minn., April 3.â Colonel
Adam F. Naff, whom yesterday's reports
said had gone through the ice on the Rainy
River and been drowned with bis entire
party, returned from the trip this morning
safe and sound. The report that they wqre
drowned was started by settlers and
Indians on the northern bounder, and
originated in the fact that the party did
meet with a mishap on the river and all
went through. Colonel Naff and the
United States Deputy Marshal escaped
and succeeded in getting horses and return
ing to civilization, but the rest of the outfit
were drowned, being swept under the ice.

the stock. The company's officials refuse

California Senators and Representa
tives Enlisted in the Pro

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.-Dr.
John T. McLean of Alameda, who is here,
has addressed a memorial to Congress in
favor of the biil authorizing the purchase
by the United States and making free the
toll roads passing over the Yosemite
National Park. He says that Secretary of
the Interior Smith, in his annual report for
18f)3, favors the Government purchasing the
roads and making travel over them free and
that these various matters are detailed at
length in a memorial to the Secretary
which is signed by Senators White and
Perkins, Representatives Hilborn, Ma
guire, Loud, Johnson, and by letters
from Representatives Barham and Me-
Lachlan, all these gentlemen uniting in
the recommendation for the purchase of
these roads and pledging their hearty co
operation in securing an appropriation. .
Henry K. Field, C. G. Clinch and J. H.
O'Brien, an well as Governor Budd, py â si
dent ex-officio of the Board of Commis
sioners to manage the Yosemite Valley
and Mariposa big tree grove, approve of
and recommend the purchase of these
roads by the National Government,
Dr. McLean says: "Surely it is not in
accordance with the fitness of things that
the great American nation which owns
this park should invite its own citizens, as
well as strangers from another land, to
visit and enjoy its wonderful scenery, and
then when they have passed within its
majestic gates allow him to be stopped by
the toll-gatherer and charged a toll for tap
privilege of passing over it. Certainly this
reproach, for which our National
Government is responsible, should cease
by the purchase of the3e toll roads and
making them free. Happily, we have the
assurance of the Secretary of the Interior
that he will not only put no obstacle in
the way of abolishing this National re
proach of allowing toll roads in this park,
but he will approve any action of Congress
in making an appropriation to purchase
them.
"The Secretary has intimated this in his
reply to a letter of the chairman of the
House Committee on Public Lands, who
inclosed to him a copy of this bill now be
fore you and asked for such suggestions
from the Interior Department as would en
able said committee to properly consider
the same."

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.-The

discussed the situation of affairs in Greer

Com stock said, should be condemned by
the committee on the grounds of public
morals, and on that proposition he based
his plea. He could furnish a long list of
defalcations, embezzlements, lives blighted
and homes ruined by horse-racing.
Attorney Joseph S. Auerbach of New
York spoke in favor of the bill. Through
pernicious practices, horse-racing in New
York had properly fallen into disrepute.
With a prohibitory clause in the State
constitution New York now had a law in
force after which the one introduced here
was modeled. It was consequently in
tended to forbid leeitimate racing.

Preparation* Completed for the Final
Government Trial.
WASHINGTON, P. C, April 3.â The
battie-ship Indiana will probably be ready
to leave the Port Royal drydock on Tues
day next, according to advices received at
the Navy Department. A board of of
ficers to conduct the final trial of the ves
sel will be appointed without delay, and
will go on board the Indiana at Port
Royal.
Although the Indiana has been accepted
by the Government and has been in com
mission several months, the contract re
quires that final payment of the full
amount of the agreed price shall not be
made to the builders, the Cramp Com
pany of Philadelphia, until four months
after her acceptance, and the trial referred
to will be to determine whether any neces
sary repairs shaii be made by the con
tractors or by the Government.
About $(10,000 has been withheld from
the contractors to cover any expense for
which the contractors may be responsible.
The trial will take place at sea for ei?ht
hours, probably on the trip from Port
Royal to Hampton Roads.
Treasury Gold Reserve.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â The
treasury gold reserve at the close of busi
ness to-day stood at $128,227,550. The
withdrawals for the day were $201,904.
NO TRACE OF THE LEAK.
Theft of the Gold From a Sack
in the Safe Yet Remains
a Mystery.
Manager Burcli of the Ebbitt House
Joins Davies and Hamilton in
the Search.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â The
leak in the bag of gold in the safe at the
Ebbitt House still remains a mystery. De
tectives Carter and Gallaner as yet have
found no target at which to aim the shaft
of suspicion. William W. Davies, the Los
Angeles man who owns the bag of gold, still
insists that a large portion of it has dis
appeared, and is determined to learn if
possible what caused the decrease. His
friend, Samuel Hamilton, of the same
city, has been devoting his time to aid in
the recovery of the lost money. They
have had a long tulk with the detectives.
Manager Burch of the Ebbitt is also
deeply interested in clearing up the
mystery. One of the first acts of the de
tectives, quite naturally, was to 'earn who
the California men are so as to know to
what extent to credit their stories.
Samuel Hamilton says he comes from
the Hamilton family of Revolutionary
fame. In 1868 he left the United States
Naval Academy at Annapolis, after a four
years' course, and a year later went
to the Pacific Coast. He 6ays
be was born at Rockvllle, but
a few miles from Washington, and lived
in Maryland until 1869. At the present
time he is a lawyer at Los Angeles and is
here as the attorney for his friend, Mr.
Davies. Mr. Hamilton referred the detec
tives to the Congressmen from California,
and each one seen by the officers said that
Hamilton is a prominent criminal lawyer
living at Los Angeles. Daviea is vouched
for by Hamilton, who says they are here
on business of a private nature, of which
they will say nothing.
Built in the United States.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â During
the last quarter the total number of ves
sels built and documented in the United
States was 124 of 28,170 tons, as compared
with 180 vessels of 28,338 tons for the pre
vious quarter. Of the vessels built during
the last quarter 65 were sail and 59 steam.
The steel steamships built were nine of
12,346 tons, of which two of 7400 tons were
built on the Great Lakes. Forty-eight
wooden sailing vessels of 9089 tons were
built on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and
twenty-six wooden steam vessels of 3312
tons were built on Western rivers.
Ifaral Appropriation Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.âSecre
tary Herbert appeared before the Senate
Committee on Naval Affairs this morning,
the committee now having under consid
eration the naval appropriation bill. It is
believed this bill will be reported by the
middle of next week. The number of
battle-ships provided for by the House
will, it is said, be left undisturbed.
Severe Testa of Armor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â The
Naval Ordnance Bureau has issued specifi
cations for the armor required for the new
battle-ships Kentucky and Kearsarge.
Tne specifications are like those previously
issued for other battle-ships in nearly ail
details, but more severe ballistic tests will
be required, and the armor must be treated
by the reforged process.

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â House

WHY SULZER WEAKENED

GROVE JOHNSON VERY ANGRY.
â¢
Will Rise to a Question of Privilege
and Protest Against Being
Caricatured.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 3. -The
Pacific Roads Committee of the Senate
met to-day, but as several members were
absent no" business was transacted and it
adjourned until M"onday.
It is believed that the committee will be
practically unanimous in favor of a fund
ing bill and that no minority report will
be presented. It has been expected that
Sulzer of New York would vote against
refunding, but if he ever contemplated do
ing so he has changed his mind, for he
said to-day that while personally he would
be glad to help the Californians in their
fight against refunding, politically he
could not afford to do so. He said that
Huntington's influence in New York
among Tammany leaders was very poten
tial and that he (Sulzer) could not afford
to antagonize it.
A member of Congress, in explaining
the influence of Huntington with Tam
many, said that he had contributed liber
ally to its campaign fund in times past.
Judge Maguire does not share the gen
eral opinion that the .Pacific roada bill will
be taken up this session, but he is hopeful
that if it is considered it will be defeated.
Grove L. Johnson was angry to-day
when he discovered that copies of San
Francisco papers containing caricatures of
himself were being distributed among
Congressmen. It seems that by request of
the Examiner Maguire has had the House
postofnce employes place one copy in each
Representative's" box. Johnson 'leard of
it to-day, was greatly incensed a. 1 going
into the postoflice, demanded to ...now by
what authority they "dissemina!i<i the
literature." The cartoon distributed to
day was particularly offensive to Johnson.
Johnson declared vehemently that he
would rise to a "personal privilege" in the
House, and find out who was responsible
for the distribution of these papers.

THUESTON AS A PEACEMAKER.
Diplomatic Wording of a Plank in the
Platform Relating to the Presi
dential Nomination.
CHICAGO, 111., April 3.â The delegates
to the fifth annual convention of the
American Repuhlican College League be
gan an'l concluded the business that
brought them to Chicago in two sessions
to-day. The next convention will be held
in Minneapolis James Martin Perkins of
Harvard Law School (senior class of '9fi)
Was, after a warm contest, selected as
President of the league for the coming
. year. The resolutions contained no in
dorsement of any particular candidate for
the Presidential nomination. Routine
business occupied the morning session.
Just as a recess was ordered Senator
John M. Thurston of Nebraska came into
..S-trinway Hall and was presented to the
convention by President Vaughan. To an
-.inquiry from the body of the hall, "What
about the Presidency?" he retorted amid
applause: "I have to be careful now what
I say in public. I will be a delegate to the
National Convention at St. Louis and it
"would be indelicate of me to say at this
time who lam for. I shall indorse the
friend of the plain people."
The Senator went on to suegest that it
was the boys of to-day that would be the
leaders of the Republican pary in the near
future, and continued: "In your hands
rests the welfare of the country. Study
the problems of the United States as a dis
tinguished form of government. Our first
du:yistoour own people. No policy of
the world as against the interest of the
United States will suffice us. We should
see that our resources, industries and
labor are preserved to the people of our
own country. We owe a duty to our own
Tjyople, and American protection domi
nates our entire country.
. "All other problems will be gone forever
from the hour that every man can earn an
honest dollar every day in the year.
There will no longer be a cry for a better
monetary policy than we have to-day.
Not long ago wealth was arrogant. It in
sisted that it could take care of itself. To
day it is seen that wealth and capital has
lejt the depression as deeply as labor.
Labor also was for a time arrogant. It
said it â would dictate its own terms. Now
both have discovered the essentials of
prosperity. No longer is there a division.
Capital and labor are both for the policy
of self-protection, and wh^t is good for one
is good for both.
"Open factories mean prosperity for
both classes; closed factories the fall of
both classes. The brilliant future of the
'Democratic party is behind it, and behind
it forever. There is no question of the
policy of the United States to-day. I
Etand here and do not fear that the right
man will be nominated at St. Louis in
June. The November affair of election
will onJT be a ratification of the nomina
tion by the great people of the United
States.
When the convention reassembled the
committee on credentials reported that
ithirty - rive universities and colleges,
: .Biretched across the country from Massa
chusetts to California, were represented.
.An addition to the report recommending
that an extra delegate be granted to Prince
,-ton, Yale, Harvard and Ann Arbor upon
compliance with certain financial require
ments of the constitution, provoked a
heated debate lasting three hours, and
which at one time threatened to break up
â¢ the convention in disorder and disrupt the
league. The real issue at stake was the
gaining of four votes by the friends of
James Martin Perkins, the Harvard can
aidate for the presidency of the league.
Led by the Nebraska delegation and as
sisted by those of Cornell, who were
soundly berated by their Eastern brethren,
the Westerners made a bitter fight against
the proposal, and ultimately defeated it Dy
one majority. At one stage of the pro
ceedings Senator Thurston was called upon
to act as peacemaker, but contented him-
Eelf with a general homily on the beauties
of harmony.
At another stage nearly a half of the
delegates headed by Weaver of Nebraska
started for the door, Weaver shouting that
they were willing to go out and work for
the Republican party but not for a ma
chine. They finally yielded, however, to
the pleadings of President Vaughn and an
eloquent pacificatory speech from E. J,
Ousted of the University of Wisconsin,
and resumed their seats. When the bal
lot was taken they carried their point.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was adopted without debate, the
clia'T overruling a delegate who wanted a
more explicit declaration on the money
question. It reaffirmed the doctrine of
protection to American industries and the
principles of commercial reciprocity as
enunciated by James G. Blame, indorsed
the Monroe doctrine and expressed sym
pathy with the Cuban revolutionists,
coupled with Uie opinion that they were
entitled to the granting of belligerent
rights. The financial plank read as fol
lows:
"We believe in an honest and sound
National currency, a currency whose char
acter ?hali in no way impair or diminish
th'j National credit at home or abroad,
honest money and a chance to earn it by
honest toil, a currency with which to
measure our exchanges that shall be as
sound as the Government and as untar
nished as its honor."
Tbeddlifa] and diplomatic wording of
the paragiMpii relating to the Presidential
nomination evoked prolonged laugher and
applause. Itr<?ad:
"Wf favor for nomination in the ap
pr.j.tching Republican convention, and his
election as President of the Untied States,
a man whose pure and strong personality
represents the best American thought
and morals, in whom the great masses of
the people have confidence as an exponent
of the true American spirit, jand whose
political principles are those which we
now approve, and pledge ourselves to use
all honorable means toward the securing
of the nomination and election of such a
man to ti.e chief magistracy."
When the nomination for officers was
reached James Martin Perkins and E. J.
Henning, the latter of the Columbian Law
School, were named for president. Hen
ning, who was defeated by a narrow ma
jority at Grand Rapids last year, was re
garded as a sure winner after the vote by
which a doubling of the Eastern delega
tions was denied. In the meantime, how
ever, six Western delegates had been won
over to Harvard, and, to the surprise of
even his own adherents, Perfcins won by a
vote of 23 to 19.
When the result of the ballot was de
clared the Princeton, Yale and Harvard
boys went wild. Harry Weinstein of Ann
Arbor was chosen first vice-president, H. S.
Harris, Princeton, secretary, and H. Le
Clare Tekes, University of Califarnia.
treasurer.
On a ballot Philadelphia defeated Min
neapolis for the location of the next con
vention, but on a reconsideration the
Quaker City was promised the gathering
of 1898, and, Minneapolis having been
chosen by acclamation, the convention at
7:30 adjourned sine die.
The banquet at the Auditorium Hotel in
the evening was a partial disappointment
to the promoters in point of attendance,
but the noticeable absence of promised
speakers, college men and Republicans
generally was overlooked in the un
bounded enthusiasm for the object of their
party adulationâ William McKinley.
Governor Bradley of Kentucky,
Robert T. Lincoln of Chicago, Con
cress McCleary of Minnesota, and
General E. A. McAlpln, president of
the National Republican League,
did not respond to the toasts to which they
had been assigned because Iheir seats were
vacant. The delay of the convention in
adjourning so as to keep the arrangement
for the reception and banquet was to some
extent accountable for the absence of the
speakers. Mr. Lincoln came to the hotel,
and seeing no one to hold a reception with
or banqueters to talk to went away.
There were not more than four score !
persons in the banquet hall, young and
all. Among them were: Senator Thurs
ton of Nebraska, Judge Charles W. Ray
mond, president of the Illinois Republi
can League; Hon. Clark F. Carr, ex-Min
ister to Denmark; L. Brent Vaughan, re
tiring president of the College League,
and prominent local Republicaus. The
shouts for the Ohio Presidential candidate
were first aroused by Judge Raymond,
who spoke to the toast "How Shall We
Win?"
The college students and the old men re
peated their expressions of approval when
McKinley's name was mentioned, and
Allison's was the only other name that
was cheered to any extent.
Senator Thurston's address, hampered
by hoarseness, was devoted to reciting the
achievements and principles of the Repub
lican party and eulogizing McKinley, the
lieutenant of the Shenandoah Valley, who
held the line under Sheridan, and whom
he hoped would be called on by his
party to hold the hosts in line for victory
at the polls. He declared that this was
the people's year: he demanded that the
free people of every State be left to express
their own choice as to the man who could
best lead them to victory, and he served
notice on any men or set of men who stood
in the way of the people to step to the rear.
SENATOR ALLISON AMUSED.
Has No Intention of Writing a Letter
Defining His Motives.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3.â Senator
Allison was very much amused to-day
when he saw a special dispatch in a New
York newspaper announcing, on what was
said to be the best authority, that he would
within a few days write a letter defining
the motives which led him to enter the
contest for the Republican nomination at
St. Louis.
The Senator said that he had no idea of
writing a letter on that or any other sub
ject connected with the Republican Con
vention. The article also stated that Mr.
Allison was 71 years of age. He could not
see how this result was reached, for the
reason that he was born March 2, 1829.

TRAIN OR ISSUES A CIRCULAR.
Says the A. P. A. Holds the Cinch on the
Presidential Situation.
DETROIT, Mich., April 3.â W. H. J.
Traynor, supreme president of the Ameri
can Protective Association, has issued a
circular to the order ai large upon the po
litical situation. In his circular Mr. Tray
nor declares that the A. P. A. holds the
cinch upon the Presidential situation and
presents an exhaustive plan for the com
plete political organization of the order
from the primaries up. He urges the va
rious State councils to send their repre
sentatives to the Supreme Council, which
meets next month at Washington, pledged
to such reforms as the subordinate mem
bers of the order must desire, thus avoid
ing the danger of strong partisans from
using the order for their own ends.
Mr. Traynor makes a strong protest
against the Marquette statue, and espe
cially warns the order to oppose the reso
lution of Congressman Morse of Massa
chusetts acknowledging Almighty God as
the source of all power and authority in
civil government, our Lord Jesus Christ
as the ruler of nations and his revealed
will as the supreme authority in
civil affairs, as a very remarkable
and dangerous proposal to place
the affairs of state In the hands of the
church. The writer concludes his letter
with the declaration that the Venezuelan
war scare was a misleading campaign
dodge, and the Cuban and Armenian agi
tations, while advocated by those who are
sincere, are mere subterfuges to kill time
until after the Presidential elections and
distract the attention of the people from
proposed and much needed National
measures of reform.

WOODLAND COURT
Preliminary Hearing of
Shepherd and Collum
Begun.
TWO ATTORNEYS CLASH.
Public Prosecutor Charged With
Acting for Insurance
Companies.
CALLS HIS ACCUSER A LIAR.
Spirited Colloquy at the Beginning of
the Examination â Witnesses
Are Excluded.
WOODLAND, Cal., April 3.â The pre
liminary examination of Charles A. Shep
herd and P. G. Collum, late proprietors of
the Woodland woolen-mills, charged with
arson, was commenced this afternoon be
fore Justice E. T. Lampton. District At
torney Hopkins appeared for the people
and the defendants' interests are looked
after by Attorneys Clark and Gaddis. Not
in many months has public interest been
so great. The commodious assembly
room of the City Hall was crowded to the
doors, and many women manifested by
their presence an interest in the proceed
ings.
The case was opened by the reading of
the deposition of E. R. Shirley, the night
watchman of the mill, in which he de
clared that the partners had confessed to
him that they applied the match to the
building ana tried to buy his silence. Ob
jections by the defendants' counsel, based
upon the contention that the statement
was sworn to on information and belief
and not upon specific grounds, was over
ruled, as was also the motion of Attorney
Gaddis to examine the defendants sepa
rately. Twenty-three witnesses for the
prosecution were sworn and excluded
from the room.
L. P. Everett, a surveyor of Guinda, was
the first witness to take the Ptand. He
exhibited a map of the surroundings of
the burned property, to be used for the
convenience of witnesses in locating points
and distances.
When H. C. Watkins, manager of the
Laugenour estate, was called 10 the stand
a heated discussion arose over the answer
to the first question propounded by the
District Attorney: "Who was in legal
possession of the mills on the night of the
fire?"
"I do not know and do not believe that
it is necessary for me to express a legal
opinion as to the ownership of the prop
erty," was the witness' reply. Hopkins
was not slow in manifesting his displeas
ure at. what he presumed to be an unsatis
factory answer, and suggested that the
court issue a subpena for all the volumes
in the Recorder's office bearing upon the
matter. Further questioning adduced the
statement that the defendants held the
property under a lease signed by Hon. H.
W. Laugenour. The witness was excused
after the motion that his testimony be
stricken out was denied.
Miss Nora Andrews, a stenographer, oc
cupied the stand for nearly two hours.
Her testimony related to a stenographic
report of an interview between Shepherd
and Attorney Coogan, representing San
Francisco insurance companies, as to the
amount of money put into the mills by
the defendants; what goods were on hand
previous to and at the time of the tire, and
the financial condition of the lessees. At
torney Clark objected to this line of ques
tioning, and said that the District Attor
ney was a private prosecutor; that he was
exceeding his official duties; that on the
morning of the lire he telegraphed to the
insurance companies not to pay the policy
â that it was a case of arson. Clark in
timated that the District Attorney was the
paid servant of the insurance companies
in the case, and that he was and should be
disqualified.
Hopkins was white with anger when he
arose to reply. Said he : "Any man in or
out of the courtroom who says that I ac
cepted a bribe is a contemptible liar. I re
gret to be compelled to make this state
ment, but I cannot remain silent when
subjected to such an insult before this
multitude. My personal interest in this
case does not reach further than the desire
prompted by an honest duty to punish
crimes and criminals. I will show in re
buttal by this Jine of testimony that no
money has been paid into the business by
either of the defendants and that there
was no stock on hand at the time of the
fire."
At this juncture Attorney Gaddis called
the attention of the court to the fact that
Detective Burry, one of the excluded wit
nesses, was listening to the argument.
Burry was ordered to keep out of hearine.
The court then declared a recess until
Tuesday.
REDWOOD CITY'S NEW CLOCK.
Strikes the Hours and Half- Flour* for
Jtich and J'oor Alike.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 3.âRed
wood City's new town clock, which cost
about $1000, is now running on Mount
Hamilton Observatory time, and strikes
the hours and half-hours for the benefit of
rich and poor alike for many miles around.
The clock is erected in the tower of the
new $40,000 High School building. There
are four dials, each seven feet in diameter.
The hell on which the hours and half
hours are ntruck weighs 700 pounds, and
the striking force is furnished by a 600
--pound weight suspended from a steel-wire
cable, which extends seventy-five feet from
the clock tower to the basement of the
building. The motor-power of the clock
itself is furnished by a coil of steel wire
rope wound on a cylinder and attached to I
a weight. It is a "key-winder,"
and is wound once a week by the use of a
good-sized windlass. The pendulum
weighs about 150 pounds. The clock is a
fine piece of mechanism, built to order by
the Seth Thomas Clock Company of
Thomaston, Conn. It can be seen plainly
from all passing trains.
SOLAN O FRUIT SENT EAST.
Earliest /Shipment of Cherries Ever Made
From the State.
SUISUN. Cal., April 3.â Considerable
rivalry generally exists among the repre
sentatives of fruit-buying firms for the
credit of being the first consignor of fruit
to the Eastern market. Ihis season the
coveted prize was won by C. W. Samuel
son, the local agent of the National Fruit
Association, while F. S. Jones, a promi
nent orchardist, residing near Cordelia,
has made the first shipment of cherries.
A, box of cherries, which wan to-day con
signed to Thomas & Son, representatives
of the National Fruit Company in Chi
cago, was the earliest shipment ever made.
The cherries were picked from a tree which
was planted in 1857.
VISALIA DAM DESTROYERS.
Capitalist Harrell Warn* Trespastert to
Keep Off His Land.
VIS ALIA, Cal., April 3.â Jasper Har
rell was to-day seen by a Call corres
pondent in reference to the recent blowing
out of dams on his ranch near Visalia. He
says somebody is going to get hurt if they
don't keep off his place aac let the dams
he builds to divert water alone. Last week
he built dams across two sloughs on his
ranch and on Sunday they were blown out
by men from Kings County. Yesterday
Harrell replaced one of the dams and
shortly afterward he observed two men
riding toward the point where he had just
completed his work. They did not observe
Harrell until they arrived almost at the
dam, and one of them was then very care
ful to expose a revolver which he had in
his pocket. The si>:ht of the men "riled"
the millionaire and he stepped out from
behind some brush and dared the men to
tear down the dam. They hastily ex
plained that they had been sent out to see
if any dams had been placed on the ditch
with instructions to return and report.
They were not looking for fight and soon
rode away.
MADERA' S MYSTERY.
Futile Search for an Aged Man Wlio
IHsapjteared From Home.
MADERA, Cal., April 3.â John McCul
lom, who mysteriously disappeared from
here last Wednesday night, has not been
seen or heard from yet. Some are inclined
to believe that the old man wandered away
from town and was drowned in the canal,
which carries a large amount of water at.
this season of the year. He left a largo
buffalo overcoat at nis hotel and a small
grip in the office of the ticket agent.
A party visited the headgates of the
canal to-day and turned the water into the
Fres:io River, and ai soon as the canal is
dry it will be searched for his body.
Sheriff Westfall and other officers went
through Chinatown last night, but found
no trace of McCullom.

POMONA ACCIDENT.
Young Albert Bruer Fatally Hounded by
an Elder Brother.
POMONA, Cal., April 3.â Albert Bruer,
the 12-year-old son of R. N. Bruer, who
came to Pomona with his family about
two months ago from Bancroft, lowa, was
fatally shot while returning from a hunt
ing expedition this afternoon. He hart
been on a two days' trip with an elder
brother and his cousin, Emil J. Steffa,
hunting in the mountains. The three
were leisurely journeying homeward, and
had reached the outskirts of Pomona,
when the elder brother, who was riding i a
the rear of the wagon, saw a bird on a tree
by the roadside and said he would jump
out and shoot it. Before Steffa had time
to stop the horse he heard the gun dis
charge from behind, and Albert, who was
riding on the seat beside him, fell over
into his lap, shot through the back. The
bullet entered near the bottom of the left
lung and came out just below the left
shoulder-blade, making an ugly wound.
The boys drove home at breakneck
speed and several physicians were sum
moned, but the boy cannot live through
out the night. The elder brother was so
frightened and distracted that he could
not tell just how the gun was discharged,
but it happened when lie jumped from the
wagon.

A SOUTHERN PACIFIC SCHEME.
It Gives Santa Monica a Deep Harbor
and Trusts in the Company's
Honesty,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 3.â There is
much excitement and considerable feeling
displayed in the city over the rivalry of
San Pedro and Santa Monica to secure
Congressional appropriations for their
respective harbors. Many business men
have come to the conclusion that all ap
propriations are endangered by the San
Pedro-or-nothing position heretofore taken,
and the following petition has been got up
and is receiving thousands of signatures:
Whereas, The Congressional Committeo had
agreed to recommend an appropriation of
$390,000 for the improvement of Saa Pedro
harbor and $100,000 for the improvement of
Santa Monica harbor; and, whereas, these ap
propriations would be fallowed by the farther
appropriation of some $5,000,000 more to com
plete the work, with large additional sums for
fortification of suid harbors against foreign
foes in case of war; and whereas, in case Santa
Monica is not improved and fortified as well
as San Pedro, this city and Southern Califor
nia would be helplessly exposed to the land
ing of military enemies and attacks from that
point; and whereas, the improvement of
Snnta Monica would necessarily result in the
Southern Pacific and other railroads
expending many millions of dollars to
secure a large ocean and Asiatic commerce, all
of which expenditures would be in the direct
interests of the laboring, producing and busi
ness classes, and would be the foundation of
matting Los Angeles one of the great commer
j cial metropolises of the Pacific Coast; and
whereMS, this part of Southern Culifornia is
the most accessible point on the coast for
transcontinental railroads, being free from
heavy mountain grades and heavy snows;
and whereas, the proposed improve
ment ot both harbors would give
competing privileges to such trancontinental
roads, and would build up the permanent
prosperity of Southern California into an
empire; and whereas, local opposition to the
j improvement of Santa Monica has resulted in
! reducing the contemplated appropriation of
$490,000 to the insignificant sum of $50,000
and has endangered the great future
j pproserity of the community at large; and I
whereas, the undersigned believe that the I
sentiment of the masses is overwhelmingly in !
favor of the entire appropriation of the
$490,000 and the full development of both
harbors; we request that a publii: mass-meet
ing be called at an early day to obtain the
favorable indorsement ot the entire appropria
tion.
President Patterson of the Chamber of
Commerce this morning received the fol
lowing telegram from Congressman Mc-
Lachlan:
Washington, April 3.
W. C. Patterson, President Chamber of Com
merce, Los Angeles, Cal : Hermann requests me
to notify Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
that if Los Angeles people will unite on
schemes to complete the inside harbor
at San Pedro and construct a deep-sea har
bor at Santa Monica, with provision to admit
all railroads to Santa Monica harbor over
Southern Pacific tracks by paying pro rata
cost, to be determined by the Secretary of
War, he believes $3,000,000 can be procured
at this session for said projects. To be effectual
action must be taken at"once. Heave the mat
ter with you. James McLachlan.
The offer of so munificent an appro
priation for a Los Angeles harbor, if the
people could harmonize upon a plan, re
newed the agitation and it was hastily
decided to request the Chamber of Com
merce to take immediate action. A special
meeting of directors had been called for
this afternoon, but it was there de
cided that the responsibility was too
great to be shouldered by the di
rectors alone, and a cali was at
once issued for a full meeting of members
next Wednesday afternoon, to discuss and
settle this important issue. The preference
of the public is unquestionably for San
Pedro, but public sentiment may crystallize
at the meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce into a resolution accepting the
largest appropriation that can be Secured
for either or both enterprises.
The agreement with the Southern Pa
cific proposed by the committee was de
clared by influential men to be satis
factory, although there are many who
fear it will not be carried out in good
faith. Their attention was callea by the
friends of Santa Monica to the fact that it
would be a matter for the Government and
not the railroad to decide what the condi
tions should be; and they retorted that
the Government, and not the railroads,
tiad power to enforce the payment of the
Pacific roads' debt, but C. P. Huntington
was seemingly stronger than the Govern
ment.
LOS AXGEI.ES> LOSS.
â  . - -
Army Commissary Department to Be Re
moved to Han Francisco.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., April 3.â Los An
geles people are not pleased with the report
telegraphed from Washington that ; the
Secretary .of War has issued an order di
recting Major W. A. Elderkin, commis
sary of subsistence, stationed here, to
break up his headquarters and proceed \to
Antonio, Tex., for assignment as chief
commissary of the /Department of Texas,
relieving 7 Major John F. Weston, now in
charge. 5
Major Elderkin, when questioned about
the matter, to-day, said he had not received
official I notifications ; to that effect, 0 but be
lieved the rumor was founded on fact. ?In
the event of.the proposed change, he said,
the i Commissary j Department here would
probably be transferred to San Franrisco.
The removal of army department head
quarters | from here ; several - years ! ago;
when General McCook and staff were or
dered to > Denver, was a blow to Los Ange
les, Z and â ; met ; with : stubborn resistance,
but all to S, no .purpose.;- The loss
of ; the commissary station, which is
about all .that 'is 'â - left of ' - the
regular army, here, will be keenly < felt by
Los Angeles i merchants,' as iit distributes
about $100,000 per year union it them in the
purchase of supplies for. the ; . posts in Ari
zona. All this money will now go to San
Francisco. > . 'â¢-''.' - ;
The loss of Major Elderkin and his fam
ily will also be a great disappointment to
their V friends'; here. They will leave Los
Angeles with considerable reluctance and
inconvenience, for Mrs. Elderkin Has built
a home here, doubtless upon the faith of
the major remaining at the station where
he has been so many years.

While Heating an Emyloye.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 3.â Adolf
Zuber of Zuber Bros., proprietors of a

and, on overtaking him, pulled him off
the dray to the ground and proceed to
pummel him. Nolan managed to get out

times in the left side, breast and arm. One
of the thrusts in the side penetrated the

VALLEJO'S HOME
FOR ORPHANS.
Serious Charges Against
the Management Are
Disproved.
WAIFS WELL CARED FOR.
Dr. Ruggles Pleased With the
Result of a Searching
Investigation.
HEALTHY AND CONTENTED TOTS
The Institution Is Protected Against
Disease and Its Inmates Are
Given Good Food.
VALLEJO, Cal, April 3.â lt is not
often that Governor Budd gives considera
tion to anonymous communications re
garding the management of public institu
tions, but on the receipt of an unsigned
letter a day or two ago, containing all sorts
of charges against those in charge at the
Good Templars' Hume for Orphans, lo
cated at this place, he at once indited a
letter to President C. A. Ruggles of the
State Beard of Health, who lives at Stock
ton, directing lam to investigate as to the
truth or falsity of the charges and report
his findings forthwith. The doctor re
ceived the letter in Stockton last evening,
and early this morning he arrived in
Yalleio unheralded and unbeknown to any
one at the home. He was driven to the
institution and there produced his au
thority from the Governor to make a rigid
inspection of the place, not only as re
garded the sanitary conditions but every
thing relating to the management of the
Lome.
Judge Thompson, one of the trustees of
the home, ana Mrs. Kellogg, president of
the board of lady managers, and Mrs.
Carpenter, secretary of the board, hap
pened to be at the home on an official
â visit, and every facility was accorded the
medical inspector in his researches.
Serious charges had been made in the
anonymous letter, of which Judge Thomp
son secured a copy, the writer declaring
that the board of lady managers was dere
lict in its management; that the sick were
not being properly cared for; that the sick
and the well were bathed in the same water ;
that diphtheria bad raged there.and no dis
infectants or precautionary measures had
been used to check it; that the home
had not been cleaned for years, and the
girls were being neglected, though in what
particular the letter did not state. With!
all of these pointers to guide him in his in
spection, Dr. Ruggles went from the bot
tom to the top of the building; examined
into the sanitary condition of the house
and the surrounding premises; talked
with the cirls and boys; inspected the
food, the culinary department and the
medical department ; and at the conclusion
of his investigations he, in unqualified
terms, expressed agreeable surprise and
pleasure at the perfect manner in which j
he had found the home and its affairs to
have been conducted. To a Call corre
ppondent he stated that he could not make
his report public prior to its being sent to
the Governor, but his manner and infer
ences led to the belief that the anonymous
communication had been sent by some one
trying to injure the management and the
interest of the home to further his own
ends.
There has been no such mismanagement
or dereliction of duty on the part of those
at the home as the letter to Governor Budd
indicated. The board of trustees and the
board of lady managers make monthly
visit? to the home and watch with interest
everything that is done by those employed
at the institution. The children all ap
pear healthy and are well fed and clothed
â far better than many children with par
ents to look after their welfare.
Dr. E-URgles left for his home this after
noon, stopping over night at Martinez.
While here he was the guest of Dr. L. Car
penter, the physician at the home, who
aided him in the researches. Before leav
ing the home Dr. Ruggles was requested
by Judge Thompson and Mrs. Kellogg, on {
behalf of the trustees and board of Jady i
managers, to extend their sincere thanks ]
to Governor Budd lor taking the interest j
he did in thus sending the president of the I
Board of Health of the State to make a \
personal inspection and examination into '
the home affairs, as they believe the result !
will redound to the credit and benefit of
the institution.
The home is maintained by the Good
Templar?, with the aid of the State.
CAUGHT AT PORT HARFORD.
Sheriff Cunningham of Stockton
Runs an Embezzler to
Earth.
Ednard Nielson to Be Brought Back
and Tried for the Theft
of $16,000.
STOCKTON. Cat.., April 3.â The Sheriff's
office to-day received a telegram from
Sheriff Cunningham at Port Harford, San
Luis Obispo County, saying that he had
captured Eduard C. C. Nielson ana would
be in this city with his prisoner to-morrow
night.
The Sheriff received information on
Monday tbat Nielson was somewhere in
Southern California, and started for the
south on Tuesday morning. He was sup
posed to be in Oakland looking up the
gold-brick swindle, but instead was hunt
ing for the defaulting bookkeeper of
Thomas <fe Bueli.
"When it was discovered that Niel?on had
embezzled about $IÂ»!.(XKJ belonging to the
old tirm of White & Thomas, and their
successors. Thomas A; Buell, a warrant was
issued for his arrest, thar^ing him with fel
ony embezzlement, but the matter was kept
quiet ; and while the story of his flight and
stealings was published" at the time the
Impression was given out by the members
of the tirm that nothing would be done to
the man who had been stealing from them
for so many years.
Nielson was employed by White it
Thomas about sixteen years ago, and was
looked upon as a brother, according to
Mr White. He was trusted with all the
cash of the concern, and this confidence
was not abuses until about eight years
ago, when he began dipping into the firm's
money.
AVhile he did not live a fast life, he lived
well and always had money to spend.
During some months he would take as
much as $200 above his salary, and in
others he would content himself with
less. He covered his peculations by
making false footings in the cash book,
and in this way kept up the thefts for
years.
When the business of White & Thomas
was turned over to Thomas <fe Buell three
years ago the books were not experted and
Nielsen" was retained in their employ. A
short time ago it was decided to make a
change, as tiie business of the firm was
falling off and an expert was placed upon
the books.
When this was done Nielsen at once left
for San Francisco, and thereafter nothing
was heard of him until Monday, when
Sheriff Cunningham learned ihat he was
in the southern part of the State.
The defaulting bookkeeper has a wife
and several children here. They live in
their own home on San Joaquin street.
The fatber of Nielsen sent from Denmark
several years asro enough money to pur
chase the house, but insisted that it be
placed in the name of the children, as he
evidently knew of nis son's propensity fur
spending his earnings, and others too.*
Nielsen was well liked here. He was a
good companion and fond of the company
of others. Several years ago he was an ex
pert swordsman, and took part in the ex
hibitions given by the German Turners.
Not one of his many friends ever
dreamed that he was other than one of
the most honest men in the country. He
was secretary and treasurer of a local
lodge of Odd Fellows, but so far nothing
has been found amiss in his accounts with
the lodge. *
WANTED IN SACRAMENTO.
Sheriff Johnson Armed With a
Warrant for James Cal
landine.
Accused of Complicity in a Series of
Streetcar Hold-Ups at the
Capital.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., April 3.â Sheriff
Johnson and Deputy Fisher of Sacramento
County arrived here to-day with a warrant
for the arrest of James Callendine, who is
wanted for alleged complicity in a series of
stage robberies in Sacramento recently.
Ca'.lendine is living on a ranch near thiÃ
city, and thither the officers have gone
after their man.
It is learned here that before Sheriff
Johnson left the capital detectives ar
rested a. man named Baker, who was em
ployed in the Southern Pacitic shops. He
is accused of being the confederate of Cal
lendine, and was apprehended while at
work. The hold-ups charged against the
pair number a half-dozen, the sums re
ceived ranging from a few cents to $125.
The highwaymen attacked cars at all
hours of the night in the suburbs of the
city, and were careless in the use of their
revolvers on refractory conductors or
passengers.
It is learned that Callendine and Baker
have been under suspicion for some time,
but not until last Sunday did the officers
secure evidence sufficient to warrant their
arrest. On that day two vagrants were
arrested for engaging in a street fracas,
and one. while in the city jail, told a story
implicating Callendine and Baker in the
robberies.
Callendine has had a checkered career.
Several months ago he shot and killed
"Jack" Harris, who detected him in com
pany with Mrs. Harris on a street. He
was acquitted of the murder charge,
mainly through the testimony of the
woman he made a widow, who swore that
the shooting was in self-defense. Two
weeks ago Callendine and Mrs Harris
were married in this City, and since then
they have lived on a ranch a few miles dis
tant.
TO IMPROVE SAN RAFAEL
Leading Citizens Will Organize
for the Advancement of
the Town.
United Effort to Be Made to Secure a
Reduction of Railway
Rates.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., April 3.â San
Rafael has awakened in earnest and in
tends to put itself forward. An improve
ment club is to be organized and the pro
ject of running a ferry from San Francisco
to Sar. Quentin and an electric line from
there to San Rafael is to be revived. All
this talk of improvement is the outcome
of the mass-meeting of March 10 to secure
a reduction of passenger rates from the
railroad companies. The committee ap
pointed at that meeting to visit the presi
dents of the broad and narrow gauge lines
running into San Rafael and ask for a 25
--cent fare has reported the result of its con
ferences, and as was expected, it did not
succeed in inducing the roads to lower the
rate, which at present is 50 cents for the
round trip, with commutation tickets at
$5 a month.
President Arthur W. Foster of the
Donahue line said that he could take no
action as the litigation in which his road
was involved was at present in a very un
settled state. He would not even express
an opinion, but said he was confident that
the battle in the courts would soon be
ended and he would then be ready to con
fer with the citizens of San Rafael. Mr.
Foster was several weeks ago served with
a restraining order enjoining him from re
ducing the rates.
J. B. Stetson, the president of the North
Pacific Coast road, said positively that he
would not reduce the passenger rates, as
it would mean a loss of $40,000 a year to
his road, and as the line was now paying
interest on its bonds only he did not see
how he could consider the proposition
at all.
At a subsequent meeting it was sug
geste.l that an improvement club be or
ganized. Many years ago San Rafael had
such an organization, and it did a world
of good. A meeting will shortly be called
to organize.
Cause, of the Glenmorag'a L,otÂ».
ASTORIA, Or., April 3.â The naval
court of inquiry, in session to-day, to ex
amine into the cause of the loss of the
British ship Glenmorag, found the acci
dent to have been the result of error.? in
the chronometer. No blame could be at
tached to Captain Currie. The discipline
of officers and crew was found to have been
excellent. The fatalities and injuries to
the crew were due to causes unable to be
provided against.

REVENGE OF A
STOCKTON WIFE
Vaccaressa's Brutality the
Probable Cause of His !
Death.
HAD QUARRELED DAILY.
The Bootblack's Helpmeet Driven
to Desperation by His
Cruelties.
INSULTS HEAPED UPON HER.
The Woman Believed to Have Killed
Her Husband After an
Altercation.
STOCKTON, Cal., April B.â New cvi- j
dences of the guilt of Mrs. Vaccaressa,
whose husband was murdered Wednesday
morning, are fast coming to light. It has
been discovered that the musket that a
boy named Hall saw Vaccaressa carrying
into the bedroom is bespattered with
blood, and the screwdriver lying in one of
the rooms fits the mark made on the front
door near the lock.
The officers are now confirmed in their
belief that the murdered man was first
struck on the head while asleep, and then,
while half-daz^d from the blow, was stran
gled to death. They believe that the
woman had a violent quarrel with her
husband earlier in the evening, as the tes
timony at the Coroner's inquest showed,
and that she waited until he was asleep
before striking him with the barrel of the
musket.
Mat Foppiana, a cousin of Vaccaressa
to-day secured the services of Attorney
Frank D. Nicol to defend the woman, and
she was clostted in the jail with him and
the attorney for a long time this morning. :
A warrant was issued for Mrs. Vacca
ressa's arrest on a charge of murder this
forenoon. The charge will probably be re- I
duced to that of manslaughter, as the <
facts that are coming to light indicate that j
the woman killed her husband during or i
after a violent quarrel. The District At- ]
torney seems inclined to this belief, and !
has arranged to have the charge changed
to manslaughter if certain clews the offi
cers have prove to be correct, and Mrs. i
Vaccaressa will be admitted to bail in the ;
sum of $5000.
A Call correspondent visited the woman ;
at the jail to-day, and through an inter- :
preter learned that the story told by her i
to the District Attorney and to the Cor- !
oner's jury was not true. Several times
Sbe v.a3 on the point of telling all the j
events of the night of the murder, and she :
told the circumstances that led up to the !
time of the fatal row; but each time she !
would stop and refuse to talk when she 'â 
came to the circumstances of v'accaressa's j
death.
According to the story told by the I
woman to-day her husband had bÂ«Jen j
abusing her shamefully for the past few !
weeks and had threatened to kill her. He j
told her that all she was trying to do was j
to save up enough money to get a divorce
from him and that her treatment of hiiu ;
was slowly killing him. She replied that ;
she was fast breaking in health through
his brutal treatment of her and that she !
could not stand it much longer.
Vaccaressa was lying on the floor of J
the house in one of his sulky moods Bun- i
day afternoon and would have nothing to
say to his wife. She tirea of this treat- !
mentand, dressing the children.went over I
to a neighbor's for a few hours. On her j
return Vaccaressa was in the front yard j
cutting hay for the cows. He called her
a vile name, and said that she was inti
mate with all the men of the neighbor
hood. This led to a quarrel and they had i
a fight that night. From that on to the I
time of the murder they had frequent
quarrels. Vaccaressa was continually tax
ing his wife with being unfaithful to him,
and when she resented the insults a fight
followed.
Mrs. Vaccaressa to-day told an interpre
ter that her husband threatened to shoot
her and took up the musket for the pur
pose of doing so. She said that they had '
a row shortly before 8 o'clock and that he
threatened to kill her. When she sot to
this point in her story Mrs. Vaccaree^a j
stopped and would give no further par- j
titulars of how she killed her husband, i
Her attorney had instructed her not to i
talk, and although she seemed to want to !
unburden herself she obeyed the injunc- J
tion.

Flower Carnival.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 3.â f here wa3
a joint meeting last night of the Native
Daughters and Native Sons to consult
with reference to Holding a floral carnival
here, and it was decided to hold one some
time during the present month. The ex

most beautiful of the Native Daughters.
Stockton has long been celebrated for its
pretty girls and it is intended to show the
outside world on this occasion just what
an array of feminine loveliness there is
here.
The other ladies of the city will assist
the Native Daughters in making the affair
a success, and quantities of flowers hav
been promised the projectors of the care
nival.
Each night an interesting programme of

NEWS OF THE CAPITOL
Examiners Pass Upon the Claims
of Seekers for State
Rewards.
Dr. Wilkins of the Deaf, Dumb and
Blind Asylum Questionedâ San
Quentin Inquiry.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 3.â Arthur
C. Hustan, attorney for A. 8. Armstrong,
a claimant for the reward for the capture
of the notorious Ruggles Brothers, ap
peared before the Board of Examiners to
day. As Armstrong was an officer at the
time of the capture, the board refused to
pass his claim.
A motion to give a rehearing in the case,
not for the formal reward but under a
statute appropriating $11,000 to pay the
claim of W. A. Wyckoff and others for the
arrest and conviction of the murderers of
A. B. Montgomery in Shasta County, was
made.
Eventually it was agreed that Secretary
of State Brown should look into the facts,
and action would be postponed until the
Attorney-General could be present.
Dr. Wilkins, of the Deaf, Dumb and
Biind Asylum, was granted an audience in
order to explain why bids for supplies were
not advertisea for.
He stated the amount was so small that
it would not pay. This reason did not
mcci the Governor's approval, and he
pointed out that many articles when uur
chased cost far more than in other State
institutions. When Dr. Wilkins attempted
to make excuses the executive waxed sar
castic, and asked some pointed questions.
"Do you go around and buy from your
friends?" lie interrogated.
"You are very much mistaken," the
doctor replied. "There is no one 1 avoid
as I do my friends," and then he added,
"God deliver me from my friends."
Secretary of State Brown inquired if the
salaries of the institution could be reduced,
and Wilkins was up in arms in a minute.
"Our salaries are ridiculously low; they
should be increased," said he. "They are i
lower than in Eastern institutions. Come
down and examine for yourself, and also
remember that I have never had a deficit."
In the matter of the Kovalev reward the
Governor said he was in favor of allowing
Captain Lees the entire amount. Then
the Controller could pass upon it, and ,
mandamus proceedings could rje brought.
After considerable discussion action was
postponed until the meeting of the board
to-morrow morning.
The Board of Examiners to-day began
an inquiry into the cost of maintaining
San Quentin prison, and Commissioner
De Pue presented some interesting facts.
After thoroughly explaining the results of
maintaining the* jute plant, he said :
"I have recently been East and made
visits to several prisons there. I iind that
in most of the prisons in the East and
South they feed their men just as good as
we do here, but it is done cheaper, because
in the South, tor instance, the contractors
take charge of tne prisoners and take them
out and work them.
"They are mostly darkies, and some of
them would just as leave be in jail as at
liberty. Consequent y they are more
easily guarded. But it would not do to
handle prisoners in that way here; our
prisoners are altogether different.
"Many of them would make a break as
soon as they got outside of the walls. We
have the most desperate set of prisoners
in the world. The conditions in California
are such as to attract all the worst charac
ters. There are forests and mountains to
hide in.
"It is a mining country and necessarily
a gambling country. Â£ue realiy 'bad'
man gets as far from the center of civiliza
tion as pussible. In that respect we are
unfortunate in that there is not a State
west of us. San Quentin. men, as a rule,
are worse than Foisom men, because the
'second-termers' are sent there.
"I found that the financial situation is
worse in the East than here. There is no
real poverty here, and this has due influ
ence on the class of prisoners we get. Our
prisoners, are naturally bad men, while
mont of the Eastern prisoners are of low
and poor classes rather than tough cases."

OIL FIELDS OF
FRESNO COUNTY
Californians Will Soon Be
Able to Supply the
Country.
FINE aUALITY FOUND.
Pronounced by an Expert to Be
Equal to West Virginia's
Product.
DEVELOPMENT WORK PUSHED.
The Headquarters of Captain Barrett
and Associates Christened
Oil City.
FRESNO, Cal., April 3.â Great import
ance attaches to the operations of Cap
tain Frank Barrett of Selcia and his asso
ciates in developing the great petroleum
fields near Coalinga station, in the south
western corner of this county. This im
portance is based principally on the fact
that it is the lirst attempt to do the work
indicated on a scaie sufficiently compre
hensive to justify the prospects of any
thing like a real test of one of the most
promising oil districts in California. The
second consideration is that, for reasons
more or less obscure, a marked advance
has recently been made on the output of
the oil districts of Los Angeles by the oil
exchange of that city. This advance now
amounts to two-sevenths of the former
price, ana there is every prospect that an
other raise will soon be made.
It is said that these advances are not the
result of any diminution in the local sup
ply, and, therefore, a reason must be
sought for elsewhere. This is unques
tionably true, for it is but fair to presume
tiiat with the work of development going
on there constantly the supply is rather
being increased than diminished. The
Call correspondent has been informed
from sources of unquestioned credibility
that the real reason for the two or turee
late flurries and sharp advances in the
price of crude petroleum at Los Angeles is
that thousands of wells in the great oil
districts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and New
York are showing indications of being
almost exhausted. This well-grounded
belief has stimulated development and test
work in other fields to a degree unknown
for years. The output of these new wells
has not been sufficient to compensate for
the diminution in the old ones; hence the
lessening of the aggregate visible supply of
oil in the United States.
Those most familiar with this subject in
all of its bearings hold to the opinion that
the Pacific Slope will witness an activity
in oil development within a decade scarcely
to be imagined now. And it is believed
that when this development work reaches
something like its full results the coast oil
fields will be supplying the United States
with an immense proportion of its oils.
Competent judges â men who have spent
many years in the oil fields of Pennsyl
vania and New Yorkâ confidently assert
that there are the most promising indica
tions of immense subterranean reservoirs
of oil amid the mountain and foothill re
gions of California.
The Coalinga oil district, in Fresno
County, lies in the foothills and canyons
of the coast range of mountains, about
sixty miles southeast from this city as the
crow flies. The petroleum area, so far as
surface indications go, is comprised in a
few sections of land. The Barrett camp,
hereafter to be called Oil City, is situated
on an inclined plateau, between two
ravines, about three miles from the north
side of Pleasant Valley. The works are
reached by a good wagon road up a can
yon. At Oil City a Call correspondent
found about fifteen men at work. There
were three drill parties engaged sinking
wells. Two of them employed steam
power and the most approved
machinery; the other used an old hy
draulic concern propelled by mule
power. The men were experienced oil
well borers, and all pronounced the pros
pects flattering for a heavy output when
the proper depth was reached. These
wells showed oil almost from the surface,
and one, at 300 feet, was producing almost
enough crude oil to supply fuel for the
work of going still deeper. Both the other
wells also produced considerable oil. One
had reached a depth of 450 feet at the time
of the visit.
The formation is of slate and sandstone,
separated by a strata of sand. Gas was
found in all the wells. Most of the water
in the vicinity of the works tasted strongly
of minerals. There were trickling streams
of oil to be seen in many of the small
ravines and canyons of the district.
A surveying party was at the camp.
This party was, like the others, in the
employ of the recently formed company
âThe San Joaquin Oil and Supply Com
pany â the members of which have made
mineral filings of twenty acres each on
much of the adjacent land. The surveyors
were engaeed in running out the lines and
staking off the lots.
This district has been known as an oil
region for many years, but little or nothing
was done in the iine of development until
a year or so ajro, and then only in a crude
sort of way. There has been for some
time a kind of "oii district," supposed to
have been operating under the mining
laws of the State, but its record has been
so poorly kept and so little attention was
paid to the forma of law, that test work
has, heretofore, been much retarded.
This district record business has also
been a fruitful source of bickerings and
antagonisms among the earlier claimants
and prospectors. The Barrett Company
bases its operations on filings made with
the County Recorder in this city. Under
the district-record regime, one well, known
now as the "McWhorter well," at a
depth of about 900 feet was producing sev
eral barrels of oil per day; but, in the
clash of interests and contention over
rights, it wai "plugged," so at present it
is producing only a small quantity of es
caping oil daily.
The oil found around Coalinga is con
ceded on all hands to be of high rradeâ
that is, a large per cent, say from 75 to 85
per cent of it, is pure white or illuminating
oil. An analysis of a sample of this oil
has been recently made by Dr. Henry
Froehling of Richmond, "Va. In a letter
accompanying the analysis Dr. Froehling
says: "This oil is, from its specific grav
ity, closely allied to the West Virginia
oil." The sample sent to Dr. Froeuling j
was taken from a well which supplied the
darkest compound ever seen in the dis
trict. The flash point of this liquid is at
98 deg. Fahrenheit and tne fire test at 104
deg. Fahrenheit. The quality of the oil is
unquestionably high grade and the yield
promises to be enormous.
Now what shall be done with this oil
when it is found, as it surely will be, with
in the next few weeks, if not days? There
is no question as to a ready market at
splendid figures. The company, however,
being possessed of ample means, will
doubtless desire to refine its own supply ;
and in fact, it is known that steps have al
ready been taken in this direction. The
Coalinga oil veil! either be piped to this
city or to Hanford, in Kings County. The
elevation of the district is sufficient for
either. Whichever place is selected will
be the site of a refinery which will employ
several score of hands and will, therefore,
be a valuable acquisition to any com
munity.

Rapid Groteth of Pearce in the Past
Three Month*.
PEARCE, Ariz., April 3.â Two or three
months ago one little house and a tent i
stood near a small mountain at the edge
of Sulphur Valley. Gold, was discovered, j
and the principal claim bonded for $275,
--000, and now Fearce is a thriving town,
with stores, restaurants, saloons, of course,
and boarding-houses. This week English \
capitalists, who are interested in the "big \
mine," accompanied by their wives, in- j
spected the property, and were undoubt- I
edly highly pleased with the showingâ po
much so that it is probable that its sale
will be encompassed before the appointed
time, July.
Uncle feam has smiled broadly on Pearce
and appointed a Postmaster, and nothing
now remains to complete the successful j
debut of the town but water, which may
be struck at any moment. Town allot

IN A SACRAMENTO JAIL.
Daughter of. a Suisiin Rancher
Arrested on a Charge of
Vagrancy.
Was a Leader in Society, but Fled
With a Gambler From a Home
of Luxury.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. April 3.â Miss
Aggie Casey, a handsome and accom
plished young woman, the daughter of a
wealth}' farmer who resides near Suisun,
and who has always moved in the most
select society, occupies a cell in the City
Prison charged with being a vagrant. The
arrest of the young woman reveals a
strange case of depravity and the case is
quite a puzzling one to the authorities.
For the past five weeks the girl nas been
an inmate of a disorderly hou*e on L
street, in this city, and lias been suppo/t
--ing a young man named W. C. Hardie.
The latter is said to be a gambler wbo has
taken advantage of the girl's infatuation
for him to entice her from a home of lux
ury ar.d ease to lead a life of shame.
After the girl's disappearance an earnest
search was instituted to discover her
whereabouts, and when she was located
every endeavor was made to reclaim her,
but without effect. She preferred the so
ciety of Hardie.
A brother of the girl came to the city
last night and obtained an audience with
her, through the aid of the police.
When he found that she was t>roof
against his persuasion he caused the ar
rest of her and Hardie. Another young
couple, giving the names of Harry Roblin
and Nellie Owen, were arrested at the
same time and on the same charge.

WICHITA, Kans., April 3.â Lucien I.
Blake, professor of electricity in the Uni

night to take a Roentgen shadowgraph of
the wrist of Peter Noel. Noel has brought
suit in the District Court against the
Atchison, Topeka and Sante Fe Railroad
for $10,000, claiminc that the company's
physician damaged him to that extent by
bunglingly setting his fractured wrist.
The shadowgraph will be introduced in

A great many men go to work in the morning feeling more
like going to bed. Others start in all right, but feel like quitting
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. "That's the way I felt. I was
so nervous and broken down, and I would get so tired in the
afternoon, that I could hardly finish my day's work ; then at
night I could not sleep. My nervous system was in a state of
collapse all the time. I finally, after trying many other reme-
dies, got one of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belts, and after wearing it
for one month I regained my strength so far that I could do a
hard day's work and not feel tired, and ever since then I sleep
sound. I have been made a strong and healthy man by Dr. San-
den's Belt," writes Ed If. Pierce, in the employ of the Guada-
loupe Dairy, Fifteenth avenue and San Bruno road, San Fran-
cisco.
Electric Belt is unlike any other, in that it is made with a view
to applying electricity intelligently. Most electric belts are sold
as a piece of merchandise, without consideration of the use that
is to be made of it. Dr. Sanden's Belt is applied by a physician
of thirty years' experience, whose knowledge of electricity and
its action is an absolute guarantee of the good effect from Dr
Sanden's Belt. In every case he makes a thorough scientific
examination of the patient's complaint before he prescribes a
belt, and the patient then has the benefit, free of any charge of
his advice arid assistance until cured. If you can't call send'fnr

-â¢ :â¢â Â»-â¢DEMOCRATIC WAR
AT SACRAMENTO
The State Convention Is
Likely to Be a Gory
Thing.
LINING UP ON FINANCE.
Federal Brigade Gold Forces and
Silver Men From Hills
and Valleys.
THE BUCKLEY-JUNTA BATTLE.
Buckleyites Will Make a Silver Play
and Shrewdly Complicate Their
Contest.
The DThnocratic State Convention is
ten weeks distant in the future, but it
looms up now as a battlefield that will be
gory when the day is done.
There will be two chief struggles in that
convention according to all present indi
cations. The fight of broadest importance
will hf that between the silver and the
gold forces. The fiercest battle, and the
one of most local signiticance, will be that
between the contesting Buckley and Junta
delegations that now seem sure to be sent
to Sacramento.
The Junta delegation will be owned by
the Federal brigade, no matter how the
light over Rainey in the Junta turns out.
That right has local politics for its chief
motive. If the new Lanigan combination
wins complete control of the general com
mittee and creates the delegation, it will
be by a very great majority for gold, for
the administration and for Carlisle. All
the chief influences in the Junta â Daggett,
Rainey, Welburn, McNab, Lanigan, WiÂ«e,
Topper, and othersâ are for "sound
money," and the Federal brigade will, of
course, be united in support of adminis
tration policy and the personal interests
of the Secret try of the Treasury. The in
fluence of other Federal officials who are
hot now pulling patronage strings in local
politics will, to some extent, be thrown the
same way. So, if the Junta delegation is
seated, there will be pretty nearly one
hundred and sixty-one votes for Carlisle
and gold plunked* solidly into the conven
tion.
It is uncertain how this gold and silver
business will come out at the convention,
but the gold men are afraid of defeat.
They are afraid that in spite of all influ
ences that can be brought to bear through
out the State the hill tribes will come
down from the mountains and the hus
bandmen up from the valleys with such
heavy re-enforcements under the silver
standard, that silver will run the conven
tion. The indications are that the gold
men will be beaten, though their strength
Will be formidable.
The Junta delegation will present the
spectacle of a lot of personal enemies
pulling together for the power that dis
perised their jobs ju^t exactly as in the
eeneral committee, which is controlled by
tt)ese personal enemies, the members pull
lo^et : of respect to their jobs.
: and Welburn will have most of
the delegation, and there is considerable
disestfem between them. If Rainey
should win the local organization Daggett
will get the big end of the delegation at
Sacramento and Welburn will have con
siderable. If Lanigan, the newly crowned
bd?< of the Junta, who proposes to make
Rainey a mere pretender, succeeds in run
ning ttie organization, Welburn will get as
much if not a little more than Daggett.
Collector John H. Wise and John Dag
gett are bitter enemies. Wise will get
m mi- recognition in the Junta delegation
becau-" several members of the general
committee nave Custom-house jobs. No
body knows where Wise stands in the
local trouble. Last fall when the anti-
Buckley movement was started, McNab
and others thought they had patched up
things between Wise and Daggett to such
an extent that Wise w,ould go into the
anti-Buckley combination. Then he sud
denly went to Los Angeles on important
business on the eve of that meeting when
A. A. Wat Kins was elected chairman. He
left his politics to be managed by his son
Harry, and when he got back he was
amazed and chagrined to find that his son
had landed him in the Buckley camp.
However, he male the best of it by going
late to the first meeting of the Buckley
general committee alter he had received
word that the crowd was large and the
thing was a success. Since then Vffise has
been considerably out of politics. He has
friends ana Custom-house employes in
both the Buckley and Junta general com
mittees and he will probably come out all
right. I
Max Popper, who is a gold man, likes
Daggett as he likes poison, and there are
all sorts of ties like that amonsr the Junta
people who will figure as influences in the
cacraniento delegation.
The right of the contesting Junta and
Buckley delegations will open almost at
the first whack of Chairman Gould's gavel,
and this fight seems destined to be in
volved in the financial contest.
There now seems no prospect of a com
promise between the local factions. Both
will send I*ll delegates to the convention.
The Junta is banking largely on the pres
tige gained by its recognition' by the State
Central Committee and on the hostility to
Buckley among the representatives of the
interior. The Junta expects thai Chair
man Gould and F.ecretary Markley
will put its Uil delegates on
a temporary roll and that they will thus
gel a chance to vote for a chairman who
will appoint a friendly committee on cre
dentials. If there is an attempt to do this
the battle storm will break then and
there, ami if any determined effort is made
to give the Junta the best of it one of the
star rowa of Democratic convention his
tory will at once be in action. The Buck-
Jf-viK-, count on their showing ot Demo
cratic strength necessary to the party, on
the right of their cauÂ«e, on the wrong of
the Junta cause t on Democratic conven
tion precedents and in their orators,
proies.tants and howlers.
But they aru figuring on something else.
They sec" the Junta delegation getting
ready to go up with the Federal brigade
for gold, Carlisle and gold delegates. They
are going to send a silver delegation,
probably favorable to Maguire and White
lor delegates at large. That will be good
politics, likely. Ihe convention will hear
knocking of !Â»>1 .-.ilver men and
then the knocking of 161 gold men
and tlie complexion of the convention and
the record it makes will depend largely, if
not wholly, on to whom the door is opened.
Of course many of the pulls and in
fluences will figure in the contest.
Tbe representatives of the rest of tne
Btate cun order in Mil votes of the kind
. they want. The contest will not be wholly
Buckley and anti-Buckley by any means.
Personal ambitions and the control of San
Francisco Democratic politics will bein
yoivo<l and probably a California contest
in ttie National Convention, for the Buck
â¢Jeyites declare that if they are shut out at
Sacramento they will "end contesting
He egate* 10 Chicago from the Fourth and
Fifth districts.
Daggett, it is now said, will not be a
candidate for delegate at large, although
Le wants to name two or three. Welburn
and Wise of the Federal brigade and likely
W. D. English are expected to be candi
dates. Gavin McNab-is already consulting
a good deal about the sort of men that
ought to go from the Fourth and Fifth
districts, and he favors such men as A. A.
Watkins, E. B. Pond, George F. Marye
and James D. Phelan.
Opposed to the Federal-brigade candi
dates there will be Maguire and White for
delegates at large. They represent the
silver and anti-railroad element, and on
the financial complexion of the convention
their fortunes will mainly depend.
There is no doubt that strong anti-rail
load resolutions will be adopted and lail
road influences will be directed merely to
lightenine the blow or to boost a resolu
tion favoring Government ownership, a
play that the railroad makes whenever it
can, because it thinks it good politics to
make it appear in the East that California
sentiment is in favor of the proposition.
As likely as not resolutions indorsing
Governor Burid will be introduced, and if
so there will be some more fun. From all
over the State low, rasping sounds can be
detected. Meat axes are being ground for
something like this.
VISITED THE Y. M. C. A.
Praise From Chaunrej Si. Depew and
Cornell na Vanderbllt.
Yesterday afternoon Chauncey Nf. De
pew and Cornelius Vanderbilt, accom
panied by Colonel C. F. Crocker, called on
H. J. McCoy at the new building of the
Young Men's Christian Association, Ma
son and Elli3 streets, and inspected the
building from top to bottom.
They were delighted with the appoint
ments of the building. Mr. Depew re
marked to Colonel Crocker that it was the
finest association building he had ever
seen, and Mr. Vanderbilt declared it was
ahead of anything they had in New York
City and said the edifice was certainly a
great honor to 6an Francisco. These gen
tlemen are deeply interested in the special
work for young men, and it is hoped
that both of them will be prevailed upon
to Bay a few words at the grand mass
meeting in the auditorium of the associa
tion building to-morrow afternoon at 3
o'clock, when an orchestra of fifty instru
ments will lead the singine- The service
Sunday afternoon will be limited to young
men between 1G and 45 years exclusively.
PRINTERS IN DISTRESS.
Typesetting Machines Destroy
ing Means of Live
lihood.
Union Delegates Express Their Con
fidence in the Efficiency of
the Labor Council.
The Labor Council held an unusually
interesting meeting last evening. The re
ports of the various unions in regard to
the attitude they would take in regard to
the friction which has arisen between the
Labor Council and the Central Alliance
was one of the interesting features. All
the unions reporting, including the Iron
molders, the Boiler-makers, the Coopers,
the Typographical, the Electncal-workers
and the Pattern-makers, declared allegi
ance to the council. The Cooper 3, Elec
trical-workers and Pattern-makers, how
ever, it was stated, had taken no form-al
action on the matter.
E. W. Thurman of the Typographi
cal Union stated that the union had dis
cussed the deplorable state in which the
craft had been forced by the introduction
of typesetting machines in ail of the news
paper offices, The Call excepted, ani in
many of the leading job offices. After con
sidering the best means of relieving the
distress of many members of the union
the following resolutions were unani
mously adopted:
Whereas, Many typesetters have been re
moved from employment by the Mergenthaler
typesetting machine, thereby bringing distress
and want into their homes; and whereas, the
continued introduction of said machines will
within a year almost destroy hand composi
tion in Saa Francisco, thereby removing from
the community and scattering throughout the
country many hundreds of typesetters who,
although they have served years at their trade,
will be forced into the ranks of unskilled
labor; and whereas, many employing printers
in this City express heartfelt sympathy for us
and desire to assist morally, financially and
intellectually, therefore be it
Resolved, That the following-named mem
bers be and are hereby appointed a committee
to confer with said proprietors as to the best
measures to be pursued to alleviate the dis
tress, and to obtain such testimony and take
such measures as will promote the object of
this resolution: L. T. House, C. H. Jensen, W.
W. Shannon, Henry A. Chase, F. M. Pattee, F.
A. Sutton, John Collins, W. OJ. Alberti, C. E.
Hawkes, J. \V. Butler, M. McGlynn. F. E.
Gnekow. I. I. Neubarth, S. H. Jenner, Uoelier,
A. Schwatka, J. Phillips.
Otto Grassman, one of the members of
tlie Bakers' Union, whom Labor Commis
sioner Fitzgerald deputized to examine
the bakeshops with regard to their sani
tary conditions and also as to the condi
tions of the employes, requested the co
operation of the council. A committee
consisting of Messrs. Burns, Milne and
McArthur was appointed to wait upon the
Bakers' Union and ascertain how the
council could best be of service to them.
A communication was received from the
Racine Typographical Union stating that
the members of that organization baa
been locked out since January on account
of demanding recognition, and they had
started a paper of their own. They asked
financial support from the unionsin this
City. The matter was referred to the
Typographical Union.
\V. McArthur of the Coast Seamen's
Union introduced resolutions reaffirming
the faith of the council in its efficiency,
and deprecating any movement to sup
plant it by any organization working upon
side issues. T,ne resolutions, which Were
understood to be the statement of the at
titude of the council in regard to the Cen
tral Alliance, he supported with a spirited
speech. They were adopted unanimously.
mar EAST foh THE wizard.
Schaefer Defeats Gamier in the Second
of the Semiet.
NEW YORK; N. V., April 3.â Wizard
Schaefer easily defeated Albert Gamier,
the Belgian champion, for the second time
in the series of the Garner-Schaefer-Ives
18-inch balk line billiard tournament at
Madison Square Garden to-night.
The fifth and semi-final game of
the series was slower than any
of the previous games and did not
attract much public interest. Gamier
had already been worsted in all the other
games in which he had participated and
his defeat by Schaefer was anticipated.
Garniei was exceedingly nervous and
seemed unable to keep control of the balls
for any length of time. Schaefer did not
have to extend himself and as a conse
quence the game was long drawn out.
To-morrow night the New York series
will conclude with the second game be
tween Schaefer and Ives. The' score was:
Schaefer, 600; best run, 132; average,
26 2-23. Gamier, 204; best run, 35; aver
age, Â«J 3-11.

CLINTON, 111., April 3.â James Polen,
living near the machine-shops in this city,
quarried with his wife late this afternoon
on account of attentions she had been re
ceiving from another roan. His wife's
mother, Mrs. William Miller, defended
her daughter. Polen became enraged and
seized a shotgun, with which he killed
both the women. He then attempted
suicide, but was arrested.
Retirement of a Captain.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 3.â Captain

de Rudio's request.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 189Â«.
STRONG LANGUAGE USED
Depositors of the Looted People's
Bank Score Its Di
rectors.
TRUTH OF THE; MANAGEMENT,
The Board Condemned for Dismissing
Flournoy â Directors Viewed
With Distrust.
A mass-meeting of depositors of the
People's Home Savings Bank was lield
last night at Foresters' Hall, 102 O'Farrell
street. F. H. Qualman occupied the chair.
T. 11. McCarthy stated that the execu
tive committee had prepared resolutions
regarding the removal of John Flournoy
as attorney of the directors.
"Such is the condition of affairs in the
People's Home Bank," he declared, "we
all ought to be aroused. This meeting
was not properly advertised and tbis ac
counts for the comparatively small attend
ance. I think it would be well to postpone
action for a week."
George T. Conant favored prompt and
decisive action and called for the report of
the committee, which was read as follows:
Whereas, The board of directors of the
People's Home Savings Bank, ai & meeting
held March 31, 1896, removed John Flournoy
from the office of attorney for the bank on the
plea of alleged economy, when certain mem
bers of said board have always shown evidence
of reckless extra vagrance &nd improper diver
sion of funds; and whereas, we believe tlie
real object of the removal of Mr. Flournoy to
be to make places for the legal buzzards of M.
H. Sherman and other debtors of the bank;
and whereas, the creditors of this bank from
San Diego to Sisklyou look with distrust and
suspicion upon every act of the present board
since the depositors were refused a continua
tion of representation in the directorate at the
annual election in January last, a majority of
Mild board being now composed of figureheads
working in harmony with scheming interests
inimicable to the welfare of deposiors;
therefore, be It
Resolved, That we condemn the action of the
majority of said board in removing from office
the only attorney who has ever proven satis
factory to the depositors, a man who stands
unimpeachable as a lawyer and one who has
worked faithfully and conscientiously for the
interest of the depositors.
Resolved, That we believe this spasm of al
leged economy in dispensing with the services
of Attorney Flournoy, who was receiving a
minimum salary one-fifth the amount of his
incompetent predecessor, at a time when a
score of suits involving $300,000 of assets are
pending, is a mere subterfuge to dispense with
a man who would not be a pliant tool in con
summating their scheme, ana be it
Resolved, That we have no confidence
in Directors George Stone, S. K. Thorn
ton, W. H. Phelps, W. P. Taylor and
E. M. Freeman. That 8. K. Thornton
having received certain sums of money
for services as director and retained the same
after a motion prevailed to refund has proven
himself devoid of honor and unworthy of pub
lic confidence; that W. H. Phelps having be
come a director in place of I.L.Merrill, and
who was bribed to resign, is not calculated to
inspire confidence in the public mind as to the
integrity of purpose in his presence there; that
W. P. Taylor has shown himself a pliant tool of
schemers by voting on a resolution for the
removal of attorney Flournoy without con
sideration or examination of the facts. George
Stone has acted as president of the bank dur
ing its course of nearly three years in liquida
tion. The bank has paid but 15 per cent to
depositors during. that period, while a sum
largely in excesÂ» of dividends has been absorbed
in expenses and other questionable ways, so it
must be apparent to the most feeble
minded that if George Stone did not partici.
pate in the extravagant waste of poor people's
money he was passive while it was going on ;
and, be it further
Resolved, That the collective and individual
effort of every depositor is needed to prevent
further waste of their money and to check
mate M. H. Sherman, who, next to the man
agement, did more to ruin the bank than any
one else by unloading upon it worthless se
curities, and who is now, by help of schemers
who now have complete control in the bank
management, seeking to avoid his liability for
what few claimÃ the bank can enforce against
him. fl'e appeal to thecourts, the Bank Com
missioners, the Attorney-General and to the
Governor of the State to do us justice.
T. 8. Williams, a member of the execu
tive committee and an ex-director of the
bank, declared the removal of Flournoy
was damnable. "I know those rascals.
I sat with them," he continued, "having
seen them vote to retard all measures for
the depositors' benefit. And I tell you it
is time to take the bull by the horns when
they removed the only honest man in the
outfit.
"We don't want any defunct politician
running the bank," exclaimed Conant.
"1 move we petition tlie Bank Commis
sion to remove S. K. Thornton, Sherman,
Taylor and Phelps."
The motion was carried unanimously.
George T. Conant was elected to the
executive committee in place of N. Mor
com, resigned.
The meeting adjourned until next Fri
day night, when depositors will meet in
the same hall.
HOW STEIL WAS BUNCOED
Alleged Footracers Must Answer
to the Charge of Grand
Larceny.
Ryan, Flynn and Brochard Tell How
the " Double Cross " Was Given
Their Friend.
It reauired something like six hours
yesterday for Judge Low to hear the evi
dence in the case of the three alleged foot
race swindlers who successfully got away
with $1000 belonging to Arthur W. Steil.
Wnen the testimony was all in it took
his Honor just two minutes to surround J.
W. Ryan, J. W. Flynn and Frederick
Brochard, the accused men, with $5000
bonds each for their appearance before the
SuDreme Court.
Last night Ryan and Flynn told the
story of the alleged footrace with con
siderable bravado, though it was evident
that they were fearful of the outcome.
Ryan said he met Mclver and Steil in
front of the California Hotel, and there the
scheme to maKe $1000 was planned. Ryan
was Known as a mining man of wealth,
while Steil thought it would sound better
if he was a racehorse man, so for the time
being he was Porter Ashe. Mclver
was to be known as his Drivate secretary.
Ryan told his friends that it was ;i "cinch"
to bet any amount on his ability to beat
Flynn any distance from 50 to 500 yards.
Steil was elated at the prospect of picking
up a few dollors so easily, so he agreed to
bet $1000, if not more.
Flynn. the winner of the footrace, told
how he came to make the bet with Ryan
and how Brochard was drawn into the
affair. The latter had backed him in sim
ilar Avents before, and consequently did
not hesitate to loan him $100<). The wit
ness said the only thing which troubled
him at the time was the possibility that
Steil (for the nonce Porter Ashe) might de
sire to bet a larger sum than $1000. The
only way to overcome this difficulty was
to resort to trickery.
The stakeholder,* a friend of his, was to
pass the neatly rolled package of bills
back to him. Flynn would then be in a
position to bet another thousand. This
could be done any number of times, re
sulting, of course, in Steil's putting up his
good money against nothing. The ambi
tious tailor, however, could only raise the
original sum agreed on, and so the matter
went at that.
Flynn insisted on the perfect honesty
and squareness of the race. Burchard, be
fore loaning him the money, had insisted
on knowing*if the race was straight, and
Flynn had assured him that everything
was on the "dead level."
In addition to Flynn and Rvan, Frank
Brochard, W. P. Gilpin, J. C. Tracy and S.
C. Bowley were also called as witnesses,
their testimony being substantially the
same as that of the principals. The ac
cused men had not succeeded in escuring
bail up to a late hour last night.
DEATH OF DR. FIBK.
An Kx-School Director and State Sen
ator Passes Away at HU
Home.
Dr. Henry M. Fisk died at his residence,
2100 Bush street, at 1 o'clock this morning.
Dr. Fisk was one of the oldest and best
known citizens, having held several of
fices of trust in this City and State.
At one time he was a school director.
He was once a member of the Board of
Health and also a State Senator. He was
72 years of age and leaves a widow and
three grown children, two daughters and a
son. Dr. Fisk was well-to-do, and in times
past enjoyed a very large practice. His
death was not unexpected as ne had been
ill for some time past.
MISSION BOY BURGLARS
Lads 16 and 19 Years of Age
Break Into a Grocery
Henry Steir, the Youngest, When
Arrested This Morning, Con
fessed the Crime.
Two more youthful criminals have been
caught after a daring robbery and are now
lodged safely at the City Prison. Neither
of them are quite as youthful as were the
Oakland boy burglars, yet the youngest,
HeDry Steir, is but 16 years of age. His
partner in crime is Louis Dehrmann, who
is three years older.
Some time between 9 o'clock Thursday
night and 6 o'clock yesterday morning
these boys, armed with a dark lantern and
a kit of crude burglar tools, made a raid
on McCoy & Xesbit's grocery-store at 3002
Sixteenth street.
They cut a hole in the back door just
large enough to admit a hand, and through
this opening they unlocked the door and
had access to t ;.>â  interior of one of the
largest retail grocery-stores in the Mission.
They tilled their pockets with cigars and
cigarettes, eat all the sweetmeats they
could hold and drank not a little of the
bottled liquor that was handy. They did
not overlook the till, which contained a
quantity of small coin â something less
than $100.
They took all the coin, some cans of sar
dines, pickled olives, some caviar and a
few other delicacies that could be easily
siowi-il away. Also a small case of lim
burger cheese.
They covered their iracks successfully
for the time being, and enjoyed liberty and
their stoien fruits for several hours.
During the day, however, Policemen
Thompson and Porter discovered a clew
which led them to the hiding-place of
Dehrxnann, the older boy. He was found
in a lodging-house on Mission street,
having removed from his home on Six
teenth street, near Mission.
W T hen am ft d he denied all knowledge
of the crime and declared he was in bed
all of Thursday night and until after day
light Friday morning.
At 1 o'clock this morning Steir was ar
rested in a lodging-house on Third street,
near Howard. He commenced at once
and seemed very much alarmed for nis
future liberty â which is, indeed, somewhat
in jeopardy.
He told how the robbery was committed
and named his accomplice. Although he
declared this to be his first offense
Sergeant Burke is inclined to believe that
these boys were concerned in some of the
recent Mission burglaries that have seemed
so mysterious.
ARIZONA'S LITICAL ROW.
Clark Found Mot Guilty of Assaulting Gov
ernor Hughes â Secretary Jor
dan Resigns.
PHOENIX, Ariz., April 3.â P. J. Clark
was to-day tried before a jury in Justice
Morris' court for assaultine Governor
Husrhes last Monday, and a verdict of not
guilty was rendered.
It seems that immediately after the
assault Clark went before Recorder Jobs,
pleaded guilty to assault and battery and
his friends paid his fine of $5. Whether
the jury took this into account or not is
not known, but it was developed during
the trial that no one saw the blow struck,
and hence there was no direct testimony
on which to convict.
Eldridge Johnson, private secretary to
Governor Hughes, handed his resignation
to Acting Governor Bruce to-day and it
was accepted. It is unofficially announced
that J. M. Burnett, a lawyer of this city,
will be appointed to fill tlie vacancy. He
was formerly a resident of Gila Bend,
where he practiced law and edited the
Arizonan.
The news that the Senate committee
had voted to recommend Governor Frank
lin's confirmation was received with satis
faction by all, as the people are tired of so
much political fighting. It is learned on
good authority that Congressman Murphy
withdrew his protest at the solicitation of
business men of Phoenix, regardless of
political belief, as they desired the unset
tled condition of affairs terminated.

BELVEDERE MEANS WAR
The Land Company Writes to
President Foster of the
Donahue Line.
FBHRT SERVICE MUST REMAIN.
If Any Change Be Made Belvedere
Will Protect Itself in a
Vigorous Fashion.
The Felvedere Land Company has
thrown down the gauntlet for whoever
pleases to pick it up in the threatened
light between the Donahue line and the
North Pacific Coant Railway. The chal
lenge is said to have been directed at Sid
ney V. Smith, though no mention is made
of his name. Since it was his purpose to
consolidate the two railways, which would
leave Belvedere without proper transpor
tation facilities with San Francisco, the
inference is plain.
This action of the land company is a
corroboration of The Call's announce
ment that Belvedere had risen against en
croachment on its rights. It contained a
direct statement of the facts of the case in
a letter to Mr. Foster, president of the
Donahue railway.
The letter gave Foster notice to the ef
fect that unless Belvedere be considered
in the railway contest the land company
would stand by the people of the island
suburb for mutual protection.
If the present service were withdrawn or
curtailed this letter means that an inde
pendent ferry steamer would be estab
lished between San Francisco ana Belve
dere on a plan already published in The
Call; and also that an electric railway on
the light country style would be built to
San Rafael to connect with the ferry depot
at Belvedere. Mr. Foster was rather
pleased with the communication for it
could be used as a powerful argument in
favor of his side of the controversy as
against the proposition to consolidate and
run all local San Rafael trains via
Sausalito.
In discussing the matter R. X. Ryan,
general passenger agent of the Donahue
road, said: "People who bnild homes and
invest mon money in developing the
country through which a railroad passes
have rights which the railroad must re
spect. There is in fact an unwritten con
tract between them and the railroad com
pany. The people put their money and
time into the country, which they would
not have done were there no railroad in
tneir section.
"This development takes place under the
influence of regular and a well understood
service. Withdraw that service and the
people are irretrievably injured; their
homes and property become practically
valueless. What is to hinder railroad men
to discontinue a recognized standard ser
vice, and then buy in the property and
land along the line for a song, replace the
service and sell out at great profit? It
seems to be no more than common-sense
that people have rights in this respect.
For that reason 1 believe that Belvedere
would have a good cause with which to re
sist an attempt at sidetracking it."
Hatch Bros, have offered a boat similar
.to their fast steamer Monticello for a ferry
to Belvedere. It has been computed that
the business of Belvedere and Tiburon in
freight and passengers would support a
ferry witnout the aid of an electric road to
San Rafael.
"We lind now that we can be inde
pendent if we want to," said J. D. Max
well, who has been one of the active men
in the right. "If sidetracked we would
drop Mr. Smith altogether. Of course we
would not make any move unless com
pelled to act, and if that should come we
know what to do."
ALL WHEELMEN INVITED
Elaborate Preparations in Prog
ress for the Great Fabiola
Fete.
Floral Equipages Are Expected From
All the Towns in the
County.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,^
908 Broadway, April 3. )
Less than a month hence the great
Fabiola fete will be a thing of the past.
The headquarters are kept busy all the
time and every Thursday evening there is
a meeting of the general committee.
To-day a general invitation was for
warded to everybody who took part in last
year's parade, reading as follows:
A repetition of last year's floral exhibition in
the interest of the Fabiola Hospital will be held
on May day this year at Ouklnnd Trotting I'ark.
The experience of laÂ«t year will enable the
present committee, with the co-operation of
the citizens of Oakland, Alnmeda, Berkeley,
San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Haywards, Niles,
Livermore and the other communities in our
banner county of Alameda, to make the coming
fete a greater success than that of last year. The
accommodations on the grounds will be better
and complete; a magnificent grand stand has
been erected and will be "opened to the public
for the first time on that occasion, and other
improvements are being made.
The ladies of the Fabiola Hospital Associa
tion desire to express their appreciation of
your kind assistance and pretence in con
tributing to last year's fete and hope that you
will lend your aid this year also.
Kindly signify on the inclosed blank your
equipages, horses, colors and flowers, and re
turn to J. A. Colquhoun, secretary, room 202,
Central Bank building, Oakland, at your early
convenience. Very sincerely yours, etc.,
William R. Davis, President.
The bicycle events in connection with the
fete and the lantern parade will greatly ex
cel those of last year. The following "invi
tation is to every cyclist who feels any
interest in the festivals:
Dear Sir: It has been decided to repeat the
very successful fete of last year in tne interest
of the Fabiola Hospital Association, to be held
on May 1 at Oakland Trotting Park. Every
thing so far indicates that the affair will be
more general than tne last. There lias been
great improvements made in the grounds, a
new and handsome grand stand lias been
erected and arrangements are being made to
comfortably handle the large attendance ex
pected and already assured.
The bicycle events will be a special feature
of the day. The executive committee has set
aside the sum of $(500 for awards in bicycle
events. The prize list has not yet been made
up, but it will equal that of last year, which is
conceded to have been one of the best ever
given in the State and the prizes first class.
A lantern parade will be held of visiting and
home clubs on the evening of April 29 or 30
and valuable trophies will be given to the club
making the best appearance and the visiting
club having the largest number in line.
Should the lantern parade take place on the
29th of April (and the matter will be decided
in ample time), there will be a decorated bi
cycle parade at the Trotting Park on May 1, as
the day intervening would give individual
cyclers and clubs time to get up special designs
for the floral parade.
Tbe track will be in splendid condition, and
the events at this fete will be such that no
cyclist should miss it. A number of cycling
novelties never before seen on this coast -a re
now in hand, and the committee will make
definite announcement in the near future.
This committee believes it is justified in say
ing that the Fabiola Floral Fete of 1896 will be
the event of the season in California, and the
bicycle programme a special and attractive
feature. George F. Neece,
Chairman.

Bond Election To-Day.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 3.â The special
election to secure bonds for $60,000 for
school purposes will be held to-morrow,
under the school district election law,
which allows only one polling place.
The voting will be done at the Kellogg
school building, on Center street, East
Berkeley. The polls open at 8 o'clock and
close at sundown. J. Donahue and H. F.
Greenough will be judges of election, and
W. H. Kerrison will be inspector.
Friends of the bonding measure express
confidence in the result of the vote, though
a two-thirds majority is required to carry
the proposition. So far the only opposers
of bonds are the authors of the anonymous
"Civic Federation" circulars. The* latter
have been distributed in large numbers.
The "Civic Federation" objects to bonds
for any sum, and proposes to raise $20,000
or $25,000 by direct taxation for school
purposes. Those who oppose the "federa
tion's" plan say that the amount would
be much too small, and that as a direct
tax_ could not be collected Before June,
1897, a lone period of inconvenience and
poor school accommodations must follow if
bonds are now defeated.
Two replies to the "Civic Federation's"
circulars were issued to-day. One is a cir
cular signed "Anti-Civic Federation," and
the other an extra of the Weekly Herald.
Baseball Prospects.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 3.â Captain
Johnston of the university baseball nine

ford University to-morrow to witness a
baseball game between the Stanford Var
sity nine and the picked nine which de
feated the U. C. on the Berkeley campus
on March 21. The game at Stanford will
afford excellent opportunities for compar
ing the strength of Stanford's nine with
that of Berkeley.
In the afternoon Managers Miller of
California and Watson of Stanford will
meet to arrange dates for the intercol
legiate games ana to discuss the question
of having a freshman game. Both aides
are willing to have a contest between fresh
men, and it is expected that the terms of
such a contest will be readily agreed upon.
Alumni Association.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 3.â A meeting
of the Alumni Association of the Univer
sity of California will be held to-morrow
evening at Mark Hopkins' Institute of

RELI6IOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
An Epitome of the Sermons Â«f tire
. Week.
[Following is a summary of the principal
sermons recently delivered in the United
States and Canada .by the leading clergymen,
priests, prelates, religious teachers and pro- j
lessors of the Christian faith. In every in
stance the full text has been carefully read and
abbreviated.)
â  PARENTAGE.
- The responsibility of man to man is exact
ing, but the responsibility . of parents to chil
dren is a thousand times more exacting.â Rev.
Monsignor Thorpe, Catholic, Cleveland, Ohio.
', â  kindness.
' Kindness is the fruit of love. Kindness tells
of the heaven in the, heart. True kindness is
grounded on love, is not ephemeial,"' is con
sistent and persistent.â Rev. W. T. Thompson,
Presbyterian, Charleston, S. C. n
â¢ THE SALOON.
The saloon is the personification of selfish
ness, misery and eternal ruin. It stands only
for selfishness, to the ' sacrifice of every other
interest. It is Satan's great ally.in crime. â
Rev. J. A. Davis, Presbyterian, Nyack, N. Y.
â¢ SUICIDE.
Suicide, or self-murder, is : the gravest crime,
because it takes life, the most sacred trust
given to manâ because it wantonly intrudes
upon a right which solely belongs to God.â
Rev. S. J. McPherson, Presbyterian, Chicago,
111. .
CRIME.
It may cost something to properly save a boy
from becoming a criminal, but it will cost the.
State and | city much more if they permit him
â¢ to become a habitual law-breaker. â R. A.
White, Universalist, Chicago, 111.
V THE SALVATION ARMY. . "
The trouble with the Salvation Army is there
is nothing back of it. Men are converted and
drawn into it, and then find there is nothing
real nor substantial for them to lay hands on.
. Rev. W. Delafield, Episcopal Church, 111.
.CHURCH UNITY. : â 
There can never be a union of the denomina
tions excepting upon the basis of consistency
and consecration. .When all sects live atike
close to Christ in practtcal, everyday living
then union will be possible.â Rev. Dr. Euster,
Methodist, Spokane, Wash.
RELIGIOUS WOMEN.
Are not .women 'more religious than men?
Even at the time of Christ women displayed
more religious fervor than men ; they were the
last in attendance at the crucifixion and first
, at the tomb of : the resurrection. â Rev. 7 D. M.
Kirkpatrick, Universalist,'.Tonawanda,_N. Y.
: : GOD AND NATURE.
â¢ Nature is not one thing and we another. We
do not see nature and not see God. Nature : is
not, as many have thought, something, which
can be touched, handled and tested, and God
simply an abstraction.â W. R. Hunt, Uni
tarian, Duxbury, Mass.
STATESMANSHIP. ._ â¢ â "
"-â  The public welfare is the mark aimed at by
the right-minded statesman. An arrow barbed
with malice or winged with mere personal am-,
bition will never hit the mark of the people's
love â  or â  win ' the victory for freedom and jus
tice. â Rev. George Batcheior, : Unitarian,
Lowell, Mass. - :â â :''.:-. â  . â¢ \
\\ ; .-.- Â THE BAPTISTS. .
" The Baptists are a broad and tolerant reli
gious body. The catholicity belongs to them.
' They are called the bigots of bigots, but on the
contrary they are the Protestants of the Pro
testants, the dissenters of the dissenters, the
separatists of the separatists. â Rev.'.C. â¢ H.
Spaulding, Baptist. Boston, Mass.
â¢ j HEAVEN : AND HELL.
'â -. There are just about as many hells and heav
ens as there are human beings, and of just 1
about as many sizes. We shape ; ourselves the
joy or fear of which the coming life is madeâ
in other words each man makes his own place
in this'life and the next.â Rev. L. H. Squires,
i Universalist, Rochester, N. Y.
' Â'-: PRAYER. .
- Prayer is not of the lips, nor of the intellect.
If there is any reality in prayer it grasps the
whole being in its appeal to God. - Prayer takes
hold on life, and the life that cannot be prayed
is defective, and the prayer that cannot be
lived is defective.â Rev. Robert Meredith, Con
gregaliouatist, Brooklyn. N. Y. ;
;/ PRACTICAL RELIGION.
;i Religion is not a garment to be hung about
the shoulders oil the first day of the week, and
to be thrown aside for the other six. Men must
realize that religion is a practical thing,' and
that it can be taken ;as a vital factor, into our
everyday lives.â Rev. , Claude â¢ Travis, . Metho
dist, Frankfort, Ind.
. -cfr.-y ijx'jr- ; â Â«;* :J</X- EQUALITY. ;.; ; '
A man is man ' in the Scriptures and nothing
more. :j All stand on the same level. The Bible
is a book that . brings society to a common
level. Every man is a true nobleman if he is a
Christian. Every man is a rich man if he ia a
follower of Jesus. Rev. C. L. White, Baptist,
Nashua, N. H.
THE TRUE CHURCH.
Christianity is not a failure. If the Bible,
has any word of truth in itâ and it is all truthâ
the Catholic church is the only true churob.
It is the ark of salvation, the comforter of the
afflicted, and what she was in the first century
she is now, and ever shall be.â Bishop Watter
son, Catholic, Columbus, Ohio.
COMPORT.
Books on comfort are very rare. Doubtless
one large reason is because it is impossible to
write a book on the real meaning of comfort
which people want. They want comfort in a
ha?y, mysterious way. But the biblical idea
of comfort is very plain and full of common
sense. Comfort means help.â Rev. A. F. New
ton, Congregationalist, Brooklyn.
LEGISLATION.
Brass is not made gold by gilding It, Reform
by legislation is a dream. Legislative decrees
cannot make men other than they are. The
need ia to make men, and to make men
brothers. Social happiness without brother
hood is impossible. Brotherhood is not a
product of the law. It is a product of love. â
Rev. S. G. Nelson, Baptist, Brooklyn, N. Y.
THE BOOK OF BOOKS.
I have heard preachers argue that in these
times of wide thinking a man who keeps ciose
to one book will narrow himself. It may be so
with other books, but the minister who sticks
close to the Bible has a wide knowledge of the
whole range of history. It deals with all hu
man experience.â Bishop C. W. Foss, Methodist,
at Philadelphia, Pa.
RELIGION AND POLITICS.
There must be no compromise with evil. It
is our duty to carry our convictions into all the
walks of life, into'our business and into our
politics. The man who does not carry his re
ligion into his politics, in my opinion, has &
very poor kind of religion and & very poor kind
of politics.â Rev. H. L. Huntington, Baptist,
Pendleton Hill, R. I.
CHARACTER.
The loss of character is the saddest of losses.
It is lost by sudden acts of crime or folly. A
great temptation comes, tife is unguarded
and it yields. A fool will burn a city which a
century could not build, and by a single act we
can shatter a character which a will
hardly rebuild.â Rev. A Gunnison, Universal
ist, \Ywrcester, Mass.
INFIDELITY.
Infidelity is not distinguished for Its mod
esty. Stone-throwing is its pastime. Its occu
pation is the undermining and overthrowing
of cherished beliefs and institutions. Its stock
in trade is epithet and ridicule; it reveres no
sanctity; it blushes at novice; it follows virtue
afar off; it engages itself unhesitatingly to de
stroy what has required years for construction.
âRev. A. Z. Conrad, Congregationalist,
Worcester, Mass.
CUBA AND ARMENIA.
There was never a period in the world's his.
Tory when the God ot Elijah was more needed
than to-day. All countries profess to believe
in God and Christ, and yet nothing is being
done by them to prevent the butcheries In.
Armenia and Cuba, because there is no onu
with grit enough, no one bold enough to stop
them.â Rev. Dr. Proudiit, Presbyteriau, Spring
field, Ohio.
PTRITAKISJf.
Puritanism in its logical result, as well as
historic eloquence, is free America. Its prin
ciples are the fountain whence flowed the
Declaration of Independence. An open Bible,
a free church, utterly separate irom the state,
social equality, which knows no distinction
but merit, the sovereignty not of prelates or of
princes but of the people as expressed in right
eous laws.â Rev. P. H. Mowry, Presbyterian,
Chester, Pa.
THE CATHOLIC CHVECH.
If the Catholicc hurch is not the kingdom of
God on earth, where, then, is that kingdom?
Where is there an institution like the Catholic
church? It has marked the history of every
day from the death of Christ down to the
present time. If it is not the kingdom of God
on earth it has failed in its mission, and Christ
was a false prophet.â Bishop McGovern, Catho
lic, Harrisburg, Pa.
INVENTIONS.
The number aud importance of inventions
in this day is not due to the superiority of the
modern brain over the ancient, but is due to
the social conditions of to-day. Liberty of
thought, absence of war, preservation and
wide dissemination of intelligence by printing;
make the platform on which the inventor
stands raised high above the scientist of the
middle ages or ancient times.â Rev. Frank
Crane, Methodist, Chicago, 111.
EDUCATION.
Education Is not a stuffing or cramming
process, but a drawing out, a developing of
what Is in a person. It is a mistake to fancy
thai a large education is only for the pro
fessional man. Why should not all persons
want a generous education? But unless edu
cation strengthens manhood it is fruitless.
Man is intended to do something for the
world. He must not be satisfied with the
leaves.â Bishop X. S. Rulison, Episcopalian,
Wilkesbarre, Pa.
SECTIONALISM.
In the consideration and settlement, of every
question cerunning to the welfare of this Xu
tion there should be no North, no East, no
South, no West. The-eim should always be to
secure the welfare of the Nation us a" whole.
The fiction of Congress has not always been
along this line, us, lor example, may be easily
discovered by looking into its treatment of
such questions as the silver question and the
i turiff question.â Rev. R. A. Beard, Congrega
tioualist, Nashua, H. H.
WOMAN'S DITTY.
Let not the husband take upon himself the
duties of the wife, nor the wife the duties of
the husband. To reverse God's order in the
home is to wreck the family and disrupt so
ciety. The wife who goes to the ballot-box and
votes, or to the courtroom to practice law, or
on the platform to make a political speech, or
into a pulpit to perform the functions of the
Christian ministry, is not only disloyal to her
sex, her husband "and her children, but is prac
tically an infidel.â Rev. Dr. Hawthorne, Bap
tist, Atlanta, Ga.
IDEAS.
The size of a man's world is the size of his
ideas. Small ideas, small world. Small world,
small man. The nature of the man's world is
the nature of the man. If his ideas are pure, he
is pure. If his ideas stoop to low things, he
must sink to the same low level. The
man with ideas rules society. The man with
out ideas is the sponge that takes up. Ideas
are in the intellectual! and moral world a
standard as in the commercial world. It takes
a certain number to measure up.â Bishop
Joyce, Methodist, Bridgeton, N. J.
ALMOST CRAZED.
THOUGHT HER CHILD WAS
GOING TO DIE.
The Terrible Ordeal of a Motherâ Her
Little Girl Almost Faded Away.
Saved in the Nick of Time.
A Story That Will Touch
the Heart of Every
Mother.
From the Journal, Detroit, Mich.
A very grateful mother ll Mrs. A. L. Hnrtnesi
of 670 Grandy avenue, Detroit, for the wonder
tul cure which her daughter has received by
the use of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Said Mrs.
Hartness: "Yes, my daughter's life has been
saved by usiug Pink Fills, thanks to a kind
friend who recommended them to me.
"Blanche was sick for over three years. She
had the care of the best physicians procurable,
and no expense or trouble was spared to give
her relief. She was so thin that she was fairly
skin and bones, her digestion was out oi order,
and she had the most awful headaches. We
gave up all hope of her recovery. Her long,
thin, listless face made me nearly crazy, and
we did everything in our power to give her
strength and induce her to take an interest in
anything.
"One day a friend told me about the Pink
Pill ana Mr. Hartness went downtown and
got three boxes. She had taken about one box,
when, to my amazement, one morning I heard
her playing on the piano. I could hardly be
lieve it, for it had been over a year since the
piano had been opened.
"Soon she began to take short rides on her
bicycle, and soon she went singing around the
house, our own happy, hearty little daughter
once more.
"She thinks nothing of a spin on her wheel
over to Mt. Clemens or Pontiac, and is as well
as she ever was.
MI had a girl living at our house who was a
great sufferer from impoverished biood, and
who received instant and permanent relief
Irom the use of one box of the pills.
"If this information can be of any use to help
some poor sick one, i: is given with the great
est of pleasure."
The proprietors of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
state that they are not a patent medicine, but
a prescription used for many years by an emi
nent practitioner, who produced the most
wonderful results with them, curing all forms
of weakness arising from a watery condition
of the blood or shattered nerves, two fruitful
causes ot almost every ill to which flesh is heir.
The pills are also a specific for the troubles
peculiar to females, such as suppressions, all
forms of weakness, chronic constipation, bear
ing down pains, etc., and in the case of men
will give speedy relief and effect a permanent
cure in all cases arising from mental worry,
overwork or excesses of whatever nature.
They are entirely harmless and can be given
to weak and sickly children with the greatest
good and without the slightest danger. Pink
Pills are sold by all dealers, or will be sent
post paid on receipt of price (50 cents a box, or
six boxes for $2 50â they ure never sold in
bulk or by the 100), by addressing Dr. Wil
liams' Medicine Company, Schenectady, N. Y.

CHATJNCEY DEPEW.
Since the days of GreelÂ«y. Beecher and
Blame, and since the decadence of Talm
adge, Cnauncey M. Depewâ excepting the
accident of President Cleveland's official
positionâ is tbe most conspicuous person
ality in America to-day. He is this by ,
right, not only of his personal qualities.
bat aiÂ«u because he has remained prorai- j
nent in the public eye for so many years.
A considerable part of the explanation of I
tnis phenomenon is his ready accessibility !
to reporters, his kindly treatment of them '
and the ahrewd and daring freedom with j
which he talks to them. No man except !
one of commanding intellect and a genuil
tsaanw could afford to take such a risk.
He is an uncommon man who has no j
reason to fear the interviewer.
Even the softsoap which Mr. Depew
spreads with so sweeping a fling is exceed
ingly pleasant. It is evidence both of a |
kindly heart and a deep understanding.
California is conspicuously fortunate in
having this eminent man visit it and
make such an inspection of its resources
as is possible under the circumstances.
Being eminently a man moving in the
heart of the spirit that animates the
American people, being intensely demo
cratic and consistently one of the great
mas? of world-builders who are working
out the destiny of the United States, and
being too ready to speak his mind even to
occupy a very high political position, he
will go hence to the grinding centers of
Eastern activity and tell them that the
wonderful region bordering the Pacific
Ocean has priceless blessings in store for
all who seek them.
This fact is specially important when
we recall the results of what Mr. Deoew
said about Florida some time ago. Having
taken a trip to that State he was so im
pressed with its charms that he issued a
eulogium upon it which was published
wherever the sun shines. That eloquence
caused many an unattached dollar to seek
the orange groves of Florida, and did
much to advance the welfare of the State,
until the coming of the beavy frost of a
few years ago. which wiped out the glory of
Florida and unhappily sent a fatal chill
through Mr. Depew'e praises.
He iÂ« avoiding frosts now. lie has come
to a land which he can praise to the top of
his eloquence without misleading any one
into a risky investment. We are giad to
welcome this man, who has the highly
distinguished honor of being one of
the most genial gentlemen in America,
president of Cornelius Vanderbilt's rail
roads, the most conspicuous personage in
the United States (Mr. Cleveland ex
cepted), and able to say to himself that
of all the great men of the country he is
conspicuously the only one who knows
how to meet that most formidable crea
tion of modern time?, the American news
paper reviewer.
KEEP TO THE LAW.
The persistence with which the railroad
lobby endeavors to commit the opponents
of the refunding scheme to some policy
other than that of tne enforcement of ci j
jUting laws is an evidence the lobby recog- j
r.ize* the strength of that position and ifl ,
fearful of assailing it. To draw the sup- i
porter? of the people and of the Govern- i
mem from that impregnable ground even* !
conceivable stratagem is used. The rail
road leaders believe themselves able to
beat, or at least to baffle, any new policy
that might be brought forward, cut tbey
cannot see their way clear to defeat the
law itself, or to overturn measures already
established in the statute-books.
It would be folly for the representatives
of the people to yield to these stratagems
and depart from the position they now
occupy. The Government is at present
absolute master of the situation. The
railroad managers in their greed to enrich
themselves have defaulted in the payment
of the interest due on the debts of the
roads and have provided no fund for the
payment of the principal. They are there
fore rightly subject to whatsoever course
the Government elects to pursue. It is a
position into which they have brought
themselves by their own wrongdoing, and
they have nothing but their own avarice
and dishonesty to blame for the trouble
in which they are involved.
The threat so frequently made that the
Government must yield to the demands
of the railroads or lose the money it in
trusted to them is very little better than
idle bluster. It is not thus an honest debtor
would talk to a generous or contiding cred
itor that has already given too much trust
to his promises. If the Government can
not recover all of its money it can at least
recover its road 3 and put an end to a com
bination that has for so^iong a time pur
sued a course of double robbery, plnnder
ing the people with one hand and de
frauding the Government with the other.
To break up that combination would be
well worth the sacrifice of some money and
the people and the Nation could afford it
if necessary.
There are, however, good reasons for be
lieving that no money would be lost to the
Nation by the enforcement of the law.
Roads whose business has yielded revenues
sufficient to maintain the ostentatious ar
rogance and prodigal affluence of so many
millionaires, that have supplied funds for
Italian princes, African railroads and hun
gry lobbyists will under proper manage
ment be well Able to pay the debt due to
the Government. There is no reason,
therefore, for any one to be frightened by
the blusterers who declare they won't pay.
This is a land where those who can pay
and won't pay can generally be made to
pay.
The way of the Government is plain.
Enforce the law â turn the defaulters out.
A PERPLEXING QUESTION.
The country is waiting with consider
able curiosity for the development of a
Democratic policy for the ensuing cam
paign. Every Republican State conven
tion that has been held thus far has raised
the cry of protection, and a 9 the Jife of the
Democratic party depends upon its oppo
sition to Republican principles it is a fair
presumption that our Democratic friends
will assail the hopeless task of advocating
a tariff for revenue. The Populists nave
shown an unmistakable friendship for
that doctrine, but the Democrats can
hardly hope to absorb that lusty young
party of radical views. t
The theory of a tariff for revenue was so
plausible in the early days of its existence
that many who could not see below the
surface were persuaded to believe in it.
The proposition that free trade would re
duce the price of many staple articles of
consumption was alluring.
The Government needed revenue; a low
tariff would induce large importations,
yield abundant returns for public ex
penditures and reduce the cost of living.
What could be clearer or simpler? To the
amazement of free-trade advocates, the re
â¢ suit has been exceedingly disappointing.
Importations increased and the cost of
living was reduced, but the revenues have
proved less than under a protective tariff,
and the public debt has been increased by
the necessity to issue bonds to cover the
deficit in the customs revenues. That,
however, is a very small loss to the
country in comparison with the one reÂ«
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
! suiting from tbe inability of American
| manufacturers and producers to compete
with the cheap labor of Europe.
Of course all this was easily foreseen by a
j large number of thoughtful American citi
! zens. It would never have been possible
j for so ruinous a policy to be adopted had
j not the anti-monopoly prejudices of the
I unheeding been so shrewdly and persist
; eatiy played upou. The cry that a pro
[ teetive tariff was devised in the interest of
j "millionaire manufacturers" was sufficient
j to influence thousands of votes and make
1 President Cleveland and the Wilson-Gor
i man bill possible. Crowds of operatives,
! working for these "millionaires" and "mo
, nopolists," voted to put free trade in
I operation under the belief tha; they were
j not obtaining their share of the profits, and
I now that many of them are out of employ
ment and others are working for reduced
j wages, they have learned that the effect of
I their vote was to place them in competi
j tion with the ill-paid operatives of Europe
I and to make it impossible for many Amer
ican manufacturers to remain in business.
All these considerations make the ques
tion of the Democratic platform for the
approaching campaign a matter of some
; interest and much curiosity. The paucity
; of "standard-bearers" in the party on the
j eve of a great political struggle is a strange
i thing in the history of Democracy. It has
! an unmistakable significance, especially in
| view of the great number of Republican
â  aspirants for the Presidency and the gen
j eral feeling that thi3 is a Republican year.
IffSTKUCTIVE FIGURES.
At a meeting of the bicycle dealers held
j Thursday evening for the purpose of or
ganizing the Cycle Board of Trade, \\\ J.
j Bryan gave some interesting figures show
j ing the comparative percentage of bicycle
! riders to the population of various cities.
; He announced these: In Pa na 6 per cent
of the population are bicyclists, in Waah-
I ington 4 1 4 per cent, in Chicago 5 per cent,
[ in Los Angeles 6 per cent and in San Fran
cisco 2 per cent.
That tells the whole story of street pave
| ments. Paris ana Washington have as
| phalt pavements; so have Chicago and
. Los Angele?, but in the outlying districts
: they have also fine macadamized streets,
i which are nearly as good for bicycles asas>
; phalt or bituminous pavements. Some al
! lowance must be made for thefwct that San
Francisco is a very hilly city. While there
; is an abundance of level highways and a
| superb park containing many miles of
macadamized roads, many of the popula
tion live in hilly regions not well suited to
i the bicycle under the most favorable con
| ditions. The park is the great parade
ground for cyclists, but there is only one
! smooth approach to it from the City, and
it is so crowded with teams that the long
trip over it to reach the park is unsafe for
any except expert wheelmen. When Lom
bard street and First avenue are made into
stood roads, Golden Gate avenue will be re
lieved and a new route to the park opened.
The hills cannot wholly account for the
small percentage of wheelmen in San
Francisco; bad pavements is the chief
] reason. Of course, other kinds of traffic
I suff .'equally with bicycling. This might
; furnish a hint to the Merchants' Associa
-1 tion to ascertain the proportion of wheeled
; vehicles of ail Kinds to the population in
i comparison with other cities. The ease
1 -with which the street-railway monopoly
manages to suit itself and the inconven
ience suffered by the people on that ac
count bear an intimate relation to the con
dition of the streets and the impossibility
of using them satisfactorily without re
course to the streetcars. Nor does the sub
ject stop there. The cost of expensive
drayage over refractory pavements is nec
essarily charged to the prosperity of the
City. It-would be we4l to ascertain just
what this expense is in comparison with
that of other cities. In short, bad pave
ments restrict the pleasure of the people,
hamper the iudustries associated with it
and represent a tax upon the business and
thrift of the people. It is possible to secure
methematical proof of these facts and to
deduce from them the proposition that
good pavements would be a wise invest
ment. ______^____
"THE SUNDAY CALL."

be a unique and especially a California

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
George S. McKenzie, the active Sheriff of
Napa County, is in the City looking up the
records of the two daring burglars whom he
arrested in a dark house at Napa the other
night. One of the burglars when apprehended
gave the name of Richard Chavalie, but Mr.
MoKenzie has since found that it is Richard
Loftus, or at least that under that name he
had been for some time the guest of Charles
Aull, ou the American River. The other man
is Peter Burns, otherwise Peter Wilson. The
Sheriff bearded the knights of the jimmy,
armed as they were, under circumstances re
quiring more than the ordinary amount of
pluck.

the merest chance that the Sheriff was not on
the stage himself that day, but some othe? de
tails prevented.
The Sheriff has had some close calls in his
tin.c. Since he was elected in 138S he has
taken 135 persons to the two principal reform
atories.
He is a Nova Scotian by birth and came to
California in .IS7B. He engaged in mer
chandising in Napa ana was in general busi
ness at the time of his election. Since then he
has been twica re-elected, and he now has an
ambition to round out an even tea years of
official life.
"One of the most dangerous experiences I
have had," he said yesterday, "was this recent
burglary affair. We had to enter the ho^e in
the darkness. The burglars were there, as we
knew, and as was developed, were well armed.
It was a pretty hard piece of work.
"Napa County, I think, has rarely looted bet
ter than at present. The grain and fruit thus
far is everything that coald be desired. I
think the year will bring a great deal of money
to that part of the State. 'â¢
The Sheriff is only here on a brief visit. He
will probably go home to-day.
"I have just returned from a visit to th" big
gest navel orange orchard in the world," said
David W. Sperry of Owotonna. Minn., at the
Russ. "It consists of 300 acres and is at
North Pomona. Seih Richards is the owner
and he is the king of orange-growers, as Dy
right he ought to be, for every acre of this vast
orange estate loks like a garden.
"He has there 25,000 trees and the crop is
cow practically all picked. There ought to be
150 boxes on every acre at a low estimate. Ifr.
Richards has a big packing-house near the rail
way track at North Pomona.
"The navel crop is now nearly all picked in
that part of California, but the seedlings, Medi
terranean sweets and bloods are yet to pick,
The yield all around there is big ana from all
I can learn the owners will make a good deal
of money.
"I have a friend down there who has four
and a half acres of orange trees, and they pro
duced this year nearly four carloads of oranges.
He realized just $1657 from the four carloads.
He has eight acres of ground in all, a portion
of the other three and a half acres being occu
pied by 600 lemon trees. I offered him $10,
--000 for the eight acres, and he wouldn't take
it. I wish he had.
"This country here looks to me about as
much like a paradise as anything can be.
Under these beautiful orange arid lemon
groves, and with the sight and fragrance of
the most beautiful flowers everywhere, a man
ought to iivu always. It all lonks to me much
more like heaven than anything I ever ex
pected to see on earth. I'm talking it all the
time. I can't get over it.
"I want to come out here again and stay.
You see it gets pretty cold in my country. At
Owatonna, in Southern Minnesota, where I
live, the thermometer goes away down. I want
to get where it is warmer. I think I shall
never be satisfied again till I get here perma

It's cost some, but it's been worth it."

A DOG THAT KILLS CRABS.
A laree number of highly accomplished dogs
have their homes in the vicinity of North
Beach, but only one of the lot makes a specialty
of killing crabs. His name is Sport, and he is
a cross between a Newfoundland and setter.
On almost any day Sport can be seen on the
Powell-street wharf watching the crowds of
fishermen. Some went crabs, but most of them
do not, and if by chance they manage to hook
Sport, the Crab-KilJing Dog of North
Beach.
one it is thrown on the wharf. In an instant
Sport is playinp for an opening in front of the
enruged crustacean, aud for several minutes
there is a lively battle.
Sport always makes an attempt to pet his
teeth iv between the daws of the crab and
drive his faugs into its bruin. This, however,
is not always easy for him lo do. as the crab
will make a hard fight for its life. At times
Sport will receive many scratches before he
succeeds in ending the life of his antagonist.
His jaws are always cut, but never so badly as
to render him untit to tight.
Whenever there is a contest between Sport
and a crab the fishermen on the wharf will
allow their lines to take care of Themselves
while they watch the strupele. A circle will be
formed around the antagonists and the on
lookers seem to get as much pleasure and ex
citement out of it as they would out of a cock
fight. Many bets would undoubtedly be made
except for the fact that the death of" the crab
is such a certainty.
Numerous attempts have been made to ?n
other dot's to attack the crabs, but have al
ways resulted in failure. The ordinary dog
concludes he has had enough the moment he
feels the sharp claws in his jaws and draws out
of the contest, leaving the crab to be finished
by fport. â ;

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Ship Aryan Discharging
Rails for the Santa Clara
Railway.
REDWOOD LUMBER IN DEMAND.
Trouble on the Revenue Cutters Over
the New Rule in Regard
to Rations.
At the present time Howard No. 3 is one
of the busiest wharves on the water front.
The American ship Aryan has an enor
mous quantity of Eastern freight, and the
vessel is kept busy discharging from all
the hatches and from both sides. On the
wharf the general merchandise is un
loaded, and the rails and fishplates for the
Santa Clara Valley Railway are discharged
into schooners. On Monday last the Car
rier Dove took away a load and yesterday
the Solano took another. The latter was
alongside the big ship all day, and her
captain wisely decided not to attempt the
run to Alviso until this morning. He will

then have the tide and daylight in his t
favor and expects to make a quick run.
The rails and fishplates will be stored at
Alviso, pending the decision of the rail- i
road's condemnation suits now pending in j
the Superior Court at San Jose.
As soon as the Aryan is unloaded .she !
will oegin loading redwood lumber for
j England. A big demand for this wood has ;
' sprung up in Europe and several vessels
| are either loaded or loading witii it.
Experts call it California cedar, and use it
in the making of lead pencils and fine
cabinet work. The Moel Tryvan is now
; loaded with over a million feet of the lum
ber, and the Falls of Halladale Is <m the
berth. The Aryan makes the third vessel
on the route, so that California cedar must
be in demand in Europe.
The revenue cutter Bear has been over
hauled and her machinery repaired. She
is now as good as new, but Captain Tuttle |
; intends giving her a trial trip to-day. It
; is expected that she will make at least ten
knots.
The crews of the Bear, Rush and Perry
are indignant over the new rules furnished
! by the Secretary of the Treasury. Hitherto
the men have been allowed to purchase
what they please for the general mess, but
| now nothing but regulation rations are to
i allowed. Whisky is tabooed, and wine
| for the officers only allowed in limited
j quantities. In consequence the larder of
; the revenue cutters will be very "slim"
when they go to sea, and the men and
officers are "kicking" in consequence.
The following has been issued by the
Lighthouse Board :
Notice is hereby given that pending repairs
to the fog-signal machinery at East Brother
Island, California, the steam whistle will not
be Bounded in case of fog, but a bell struck by
hand at about intervals of fifteen seconds.
The repairs to the steam whistle will be
completed about April 6, and thereafier the
signal will sound its ur.ual characteristic
wnistle during thick and foggy weather.

The American ship Baring Bros, was
towed to Sausalito, where she will remain
tied up until chartered. There is no trade
offering between here and New York and
the wheat business is dead. Sausalito is
likely to have more vessels tied up in- the
bay opposite the town this season than at
any time during its history.
When the barkentine Modoc was being
towed to sea yesterday she went foul of
the steamer Kahului. Both vessels were
at Mission-street wharf and the Modoc
was going to sea. The latter had her
standing rigging injured considerably and
the steamer lost a portion of her rail and
bulwarks.
O. C. Benjamin, outside agent for Wil
liams, Dimond <fc Co., nearly lost his life
yesterday. He was transacting some busi
ness for the firm on Mission-street wharf
when a heavy barrel of oil escaped from
the hands of the stevedores and rolled up
acainst him. He was knocked down and
the barrel rolled over his leg. breaking it
in two places. He was removed to his

The British ship Godiva is in a queer
predicament. She is loaded and ready for
sea, but cannot get away from Long Bridge
because of a ridge of mud that bars her
passage. The Godiva draws 22 feet, and as
the ridge is only 18 feet at hi^h water, the
vessel cannot pass over it. The mud is
soft, however, and three tugs will be put
on the ship to-day and she will be pulled
bodily through it. There is no truth in
the rumor that the Godiva was to be dis
charged.
TALKED TO A PURPOSE.
J. A. Hull Has Two Years Knocked Off
His Sentence.
J. A. Hull, alias C. G. Hoyt, was sen
tenced to a year and a half in the State
Prison by Judge Wallace yesterday.
Hill had pleaded euiliy to forging acheck
on Wells, Fargo & Co.'s bank. He had
already served a year in San Quentin for
tlie same offense, committed at the same
time and in the same manner, and he had
been arrested as soon as he was released
from serving his sentence on the first
charge. After pleading guilty he ad
dressed a plea for mercy to the court. He
said he had come here from the East and
had got in with a crowd of gay spirits in
Los Angeles. He drank a good deal and
in a bibulous moment he forged the checks.
He pleaded guilty in Los Angeles and
was sentenced to a year's imprisonment.
He served the year and on emerging from
prison walls he was at once arrested
again on a second charge. He said he in
tended to reform; he had never given any
trouble and he had saved the. State the
expense of two trials. He t erefore asked
the court to be merciful. His plea gained
him two years. Judge Wallace had him
slaled for three and a half years, but he
gave him one and a half instead.
CLIFTON BROKE HIS NOSE
The Gay Horseman's Fate on
a Chute at Sutro
Baths.
He Slid Face Downward and Bumped
Upon the Bottom Curveâ Worse
Than a Polo Hurdle.
Talbot Clifton, the horseman and eccen
tric capitalist of Burlingame, is once more
in trouble. This time it is nothing more
serious than a broken nose, which "my
lua" is nursing with mingled sensations
of adhesive plaster and disquieting reflec
tions of his latest ambition to be an athlete
and one of the boys.
He vows that never again snail he essay
a plunge into a bath from one of these new
fangled sliding-boards, the use of which
has proved disastrous to his lordly dignity
and incidentally to his olfactory organ.
Clifton paid a visit to the Sutro Baths
Thursday night. A lew of his intimates
accompanied him and the Ã¼biquitous valet,
who is better known in Clifton's haunts as
"me man."
The promenade and the vastness of the
building, with its novelties, its swimming
tanks and its louvre fascinated Clifton,
who soon became absorbed in the bathers.
Riding the water hobby-horses, plung
ing, diving and above all shooting the
green, glass chutes appears to be the acme
of sport in his eyes; and he resolved to
try them all.
"Fvtch in" a bathing suit, me man," he
exclaimed, delving into a long purse for a
dollar.
The valet secured a suit and presently
Talbot appeared from a dressing- room in
oil his athletic magnificence. Of course,
the crowd admired hard and fast ana the
English nobleman wished to be at his
best. Sliding down the inclined boards
seemed as easy as taking a polo hurdle,
and at worst one could only come to the
bottom. Nothing was so common-place as
shooting downward feet first. Then again
Clifton is nothing if not original. Ro ho
slid away head tirst and face downward.
It was this that caused all the trouble.
Clifton forgot that there was a curve at
the bottom of the chute, placed there for
tlie purpose of shooting bathers outward
overt c water, and when his forward sec
tion reached the curve his prominent nose
was in the way. It struck the plank and
Clifton fell in a lump into the water, with
a ruddy ulow about him. When he ap
peared above the water consternation
reined.
'â¢I broke me nose!" yelled my lord. "1
broke me nose! Hi! Where's me man?"
The man was beside the tank instantly.
"Call a doctor. I broke me nose."
The rthysiciaa was summoned, and after
some delay Clifton was patched ud suffi
ciently to be able to reach his rooms.

PAULINE ASKS A DIVORCE
James E. Nolan's Recently
Wedded Wife Wants to Be
Free Again.
THEY WERE MARRIED IN HASTE
Sequel of a Ceremony That Took
Place Little More Than Three
Months Ago.
Though but three months have passed
since pretty Pauline Foster, the adopted
daughter of Captain Hans Madison, a weal
thy retired sea captain living at 2326 Mission
street, became the bride of James E. Nolan
of the well-known shoe firm, the young
bride has decided that marriage is a failure
and has had her attorney file a suit for a
divorce.
It is the old story of marry in haste and
repent at leisure, with the usual conse
quence of a legal separation.
The wedding was a great surprise to the
friends of both of the parties, as it was
not even known that they were engaged,
as indeed they were not until the day the
ceremony was performed. Young Nolan
called on Miss Foster on December 26 last,
after having known her but a short pe
riod, proposed, was accepted and within
an hour the couple, accompanied by a lady
friend of Miss Foster, was on the way in a
hack to the marriage license oftice, with
out the relatives ol eittier being aware of
their intentions.
Cupid Danfortb made no objection to
granting the necessary document, but
when it came to finding some one to tie
the knot the sailing was not so plain.
Father McGinty of Holy Cross Church
was first called on, but he asked the younsj
people to wait three days â something
they were not willing to do. In their
dilemma they sought a Justice of the
Peace, who speedily tied the Knot and
pronounced them man and wife. Not
being quite sure how their hurried mar
riage would be taken by their relatives,
the newly wedded couple decided not to
make the matter public at once, and
started out on a mild career of dissipation
as a honeymoon.
With the Justice and an attache of the
marriage license office a French restaurant
was visited and both liquid and solid re
freshments were partaken of. Later a
theater party was made up and the even
ing was spent at a well-known variety
show.
At first Nolan and his bride seemed very
happy, but soon signs of dissatisfaction
appeared, and within two months a sepa
ration took place. Miss Foster returning to
ncr adopted father's home and young
Nolan to his relatives.
Their friends thought that the quarrel,
if any bad occurred, would blow over, an d
that some seeming neglect on Nolan's part
had caused the rupture, but when they re
mained apart for a considerable period
mutual friends made inquiries, and ascer
tained that the separation was by mutual
consent, and that ooth had decided that to
live together would be to invite unhappi
ness and render both miserable.
When it was found that a reconciliation
was impossible they were advised to ob
tain a divorce on statutory grounds, and
thus settle the matter for good.
Mrs. Nolan accordingly consulted alaw
yer, and the papers In the case were filed
on the Ist inst. It is probable that a de
cree will be obtained by default.
Mrs. Nolan js a handsome brunette,
with dark, liquid eyes ami a pretty figure.
She is well known and popular in the Mis
sion, where she has resided since child
hood.
HINTON GOES EAST.
He Is Summoned to New York, Whence
1 He Will leave for
Panama.
E. H. Hinton, general agent of the Pan
ama Railroad Company in this City, left
for New York last evening in response to
a telegraphic summons from the general
manager. He will ieave there on the 10th
for Panama.
His being called away from his post in
this City is thought to signify that the ar
rangements for the reorganization of the
Trancontinentril Traffic Association have
progressed so far that there is no longer
any danger of discord. This City is too
important a vantage point in case of a rate
war to be left unguarded, and it is there
fore safe to presume that before many days
notice will beciven of advances in freights
all over the country.
The general freight agents of all the big
lines have now bÂ»'(-n In session for five
days, and the fact that absolutely nothing
has been made public indicates that their
proceedings are harmonious and satis
factory to the railroads however they may
be viewed by the public. Had there been
any "kicking" the public would have un
doubtedly heard of it.
CONTESTING CHILDREN.
Mrs. Lucy C Goodapced'a 'Will to Be
Dragged Into Court.
The will of Lucy C. Goodspeed is being
contested by her eider children, Anna
Amelia Stanford, Orville C. Pratt Good
speed and Jennie Maud Snowgrass. Mrs.
Goodspeed left an estate valued at $300,000
to her two minor children, practically dis
inheriting the older children, who are
contesting.
The contestants allege that at the time
of the execution of the will Mrs. Good
speed was of unsound mind, the effect, of a
long illness. They also allege that the
will was largely the result of the influence
held over the testatrix hy Daniel Sullivan,
one of the executors. Sullivan was made
a member of the household, says the docu
ment filed, and ever afterward he held a
remarkable influence over her. He kept a
strict watch upon her, it is alleged, an
prevented all visits of her children and
lier friends. This was done, it is charged,
to procure just auch a will as was riled,
wit:i himself and Frank Myers as execu
tors.
It ia further charged that Mrs. Good
speed was madÂ© to believe that ncr estate
consisted of only a few thousand dollars,
when in fact it was worth $300,000. She
was told, too, the contestants say, that her
elder children were all in comfortable cir
cumstances and did not need assistance.

MRS. FRANK WEST DIES.
A Cousin of the Princess Poniatowski
Passes; Away After a Long
Illness.
Mrs. Frank West, wife of the wealthy
vineyardist of Stockton and daughter of
J. L. Sporry of the Calaveras Big Trees,
died last evening at the Occidental Hotel.
The lady had been sick for many months.
1 About ten days ago her husband, think
in- a change of climate might help her,
brought her to this City. She appears to
nave taken a little cold, however, for in
stead ;of petting better she rapidly got
worse. For a day or two previous to her
death she was very low. Four physicians
were in attendance. Mr. and Mrs" Sperry
arrived from the Big Trees yesterday, and
Mr. and Mrs. George West, the parents of
Frank West, also came from. Stockton. ,:

Mrs. Will Crocker of th!s City and of the
Princess Poniatowski. George .West,' the

Stole Hit* Own Baby.
Charles Cornberger, living at "1534 Howard
street, visited the several police courts yester
day in a vain endeavor to secure a warrant for
the arre6t of his son-in-law, Eugene McGinty.
About two years ago McGinty married Corn
berger' b daughter And for a time everything
moved smoothly. Then the wife grew tired of
certain shortcomings on the part of the hus
band, and taking her 12-months-old baby re
turned to the home of her parents. The bus
band agreed to the separation, merely stipu
lating that he should be allowed to see the
child whenever he called. Thursday McGinty
called on his wife, and after a few moments
asked that he be allowed to take the baby out
for an airing. When an hour had passed the
mother became uneasy, and made a haaty but
futile search for the missing one. Later it
was learned that MeGinty left with the baby
for Oregon on the 5 o'clock train. Warrant
Clerk Graham told Cornberger that the case
was not one in which the police courts could
afford relief.
MORTGAGES HIS SHARE
General W. H. H. Hart Borrows
on His Interest in the
Blythe Estate.
L. P. Drexler Loans the Attorney
$60,000, and Mrs. Hinck'ey
Becomes Surety.
Attorney W. H. H. Hart, one of the
lawyers in Florence Blythe - Hinckley's
right for her father's millions, has
mortgaged his contingent share of the
great estate in order to raise funds to carry
on some ot the big commercial transactions
in which he is engaged.
A document was filed in the Record
er's office yesterday in which Mr. Hnrt
acknowledges the receipt of $60,000, and
for which he gives as security twelve
twenty-fifths of his share in the estate as
security, with the proviso that he is to be
allowed to borrow not to exceed $25,000
more on the same security.
Ky an ajneiuent tiled at the same time
Mrs. Blythe-riinckley agrees to become
suiety for Hart ior the amount borrowed.
The instrument recites that she has
agreed to pay Mr. Hart one-eighth of
the value of the estate lor his efforts on
her behalf, with the option of paying him
its cash value any time before May 1, L2<\

twenty-fifth interest in his share of the
estate to L. P. Drexler for $(30,000, with the
privilege of borrowing not to exceed

estate as specified in her deed of February
29, she will retain enough to pay Drexler.
The instrument was executed by both
Hart and Mrs. Hinckley as parties of the

PRESIDING JUDGE CALLED
The Fee Bill of 1895 Considered
by the Grand
Jury.
Disorderly Conduct of Newsboys at
Powell and Eddy Streets
Complained Of.
The fee bill of 1895, which the Recorder
disregards and which the Sheriff d/>es not
fully comply with, was the subject of a
long and animated discussion by the
Grand Jury yesterday afternoon.
The jury's expert, Horace D. Dunn, pre
sented an elaborate report of his recent in
vestigation in tue Recorder's oliioe, but
the statement was deemed incomplete and
the expert instructed to complete it.
The point was raised in the jury-room
that a case was pending in the Supreme
Court which was brought to determine
whether the fee bill of 1605 or the old law
should govern in the collection of fees, and
while that case was undecided the jury
could take no steps to compel officers to
observe the new law. Evidently some of
the jurors held to the opinion that the iaw
as passed by the Legislature of 1895 re
pealed the former iaw, and that it
was tho duty of public officers
to obey it until the Supreme
Court set it aside. To get more light, on
the dark subject than the jurors them
selves possessed or the agreeable Assistant
District Attorney Black was able to reflect
it was decided to call in Superior Judge
Slack. His Honor the Presiding: Judge
visited the smoky precincts of the jury
room, and it was ascertained after his de
parture that he advised the jury to wait
until the Supreme Court handed down a
decision.
In the investigation which may lead to
the indictment of a gang of forgers and
perjurers for forging the name of Mrs.
Christy and swearing that the forged sig
nature" was made by Mrs. Spencer the jury
yesterday called as witnesses Mr. Magin
ms, the stenographer; \V. F. Spencer and
Detective Dillon. It was Uiought that an
mdi tment would be returned yesterday
afternoon, but the session of the jury was
continued long after the hour for the ad
journment of courts.
Mrs. Spencer is now in San Francisco
and has presented conclusive proof to the
Grand Jury t at she was in Chicago on
the iay that the forgery was committed.
Attorney William Giibert submitted to
the Grand Jury a statement concerning an
assault made upon John Garigues, a veg
etable dealer, by a man named Truett.
Garigues and his daughter Nina were wit
nesses.
Frank P. McLennan, secretary of trie
Grand Jury and a member of the Police
Department committee, i'as decided to
call the attention of the Chief of Police to
the disorderly conduct 01 the newsboys at
the corner of Powell and Eddy streets.
Recently Mr. McLennan intervened to
prevent n. Chinaman from being molested
in a ruffianly manner, whereupon the
newsboys lined up on the street and jeered
at the stcretary.
The attention of Officer Young, on duty
at the corner, was then and there directed
to the unruly proceedings, and further
steps will be taken to preserve order in
that locality. Mr. McLennan says no man
has any more sympathy or respect for boys
who sell papers for a living t an he enter
tain!*, but he is determined to restrain the
big boys from disorderly conduct on the
street and to abolish, if possible, acts of
rowdyism on that particular corner of the
City.

INGLIS ' STAMP ALBUM.
Sharp Trick of His Wife With
a Valuable Philatelic
Collection.
SHE DOES NOT WANT DIVORCE.
Mrs. Inglis Will Have Maintenance
and Shut the Other Woman
Out.
J. P. Inglis, the contracting agent of the
Union Pacific Railway Company in this
City, is naif-crazed, so his friends say,
over the several suits his wife has brought
against him.
Mrs. Inglis does not want a divorce. She
wants support. If she obtained a legal
separation from her recreant spouse.which
her attorney, H. A. Massey, says she could
do without trouble, she fears tnere would
be much difficulty in getting alimony.
In her complaint for maintenance Mrs.
Inglis alleges that another woman has
estranged her husband's affections. If
she secured a divorce she believes that
Inelis would marry this "other woman"
immediately and that she could not get
her alimony without much difficulty, if at
all.
Pending the suit for. maintenance the
court granted Mrs. Inglis $53 a month, but
the odd part of that story is to be told.
jj Inglis claims that his wife has in her
possession a stamp album belonging to
him which is valued at $500 or $600. He
tried to get the album by all possible
means without resorting to the law and
failed. Finally it was decided to take her
deposition as to ttie whereabouts of the
valuable stamp collection.
The deposition began at 10 o'clock In the
morning. Mrs. Inglis testified that the
album was in the possession of Mr. Frank
lin at the Sutter-street carhouse. The at
torneys for Mr.lngiis lost no time when
that "admission was made in sending to
Mr. Franklin for the $500 album, .but Mr.
Franklin had been instructed by Mrs. In
glis to give the album to some one whose
name she was not to be told at half-past
10 the same morning.
When the angry attorneys asked her
why she had said the coveted album was
where they found it not, she smiled and
said she nad spoken the truth; she had
given it to Mr. Franklin, and when the
question was asked her it was still in that
gentleman's possession.
Attorney Miller wanted the lady pun
ished for contempt, but Judge Slack could
| not see it in that light.'
Inglis resigned his position with the
Union Pacific on the Ist of the month.
Mr. Shoemaker, the chief representative
of the company on this coast, corroborates
! the statement made by I nclis in his
answerâ he has tendered his resigna
tion, and adds that he is trying to prevail
on Inglis to reconsider his determination;
He is one of the most prominent and 1 suc
cessful contracting agents on the coast,
and earns a large salary. The company
will not lose his services if it can help it,
and for that reason he has been urged to
settle with his wife and get back to busi
ness.
Mrs. Inglis' next step was to bring an
injunction suit to enjoin her husband iroru
leaving the State or disposing of any of his
mining stocks, which her attorney, Mr.
Massey, says are estimated to be "worth
between $50,000 and $75,000. She I hau
heard that he intended to convert his
stock holdings into cash and leave for
parts unknown and take their child with
him. . She was informed that he intended
to kidnap the child and her injunction suit
is now before the court. j
They have been married thirteen years,
and. according to Mrs. Inglis, they lived as
happily as most persons treading life's
path double in the holy yoke until the un
known and ncr nameless attractions caused
the estrangement. She says that ever since
his infatuation her husband has systemat
ically neglected her. If she cannot regain
his love and loyalty she does not intend
that the other woman shall get more than
her share. ' '_ '

MR. DEPEW ON
CALIFORNIA WINE.
He Says It Is to Evolve
the Great Californian
Fortune.
ADVICE ON CHAMPAGNE
Percentage of Alcohol Must Be
Reduced but the Fizz
Retained.
STILL WINES ALL RIGHT.
Was Rather Disappointed in China
town and Does Not Think
Well of the Chinaman.
"We are a nation of wine-drinKersâ
champagne-drinkers. The Californian
who makes a light dry wine such as will
meet the prevailing and rapidly growing
demand will make the greatest Californian
fortune, a greater fortune than any vet
made and limited only by the resources of
bis vineyards."
Bo said Chauuoey M. Depew last even
ing, only just returned from an inspection
of the wineries of Napa Valley. He was
standing under the blazing chandelier in
his room at the Palace dressed for dinner â
full dress, shining silk hat, immaculate.
"The journey to-day up the Napa Val
ley has been a very interesting one. I
lave seen the vineyards and wineries of
France and I know that California has it
in her to stop Qm import trade iv French
wines to a vtry marked degree.
"The demand. 1 ' as I say, "is for light
wines. The habit of temperance is grow
ing. I can remember the time when the j
drunken man on the street was so fre- i
qoent as too c not noteworthy. Now
he is an unusual surht. To drink and !
get tipsy at dinner was quite the fashion.
â¢â¢The man who would be guilty of such
a thing at this day would lose caste en
tirely. We drink champagne as no other
nation does. Nor is it the special beverage
of the rich. No tire brigade has a reunion
without the opening of champagne. When
a baby is christened he is toasted in cham
pagne. No prodical returns except to tell
tte story of bis ill fortunes over a small bot
tle. Everybody drinKs> champgne, but
they Insist upon it being light. Stipulat
ing as to the sparkle and fizz, yet the per
cent.sge of alcohol must be low.
â¢ N >w thai b wnat's the matter with
California wine. There is too much alco
hoi in it. The soil is so rich that it makes
sugar in the grapes and tbe sugar makes
alcohol. Tbe earlier shipments of w:ne
were especially faulty in this regard.
"Now this man whom I speak of, who is
to make the greater California fortune,
will go a little higher up on the hillsides
than the vineyards of the present are to be
: i ; he will not cultivate so deeply, and
he wiil not be in such a hurry to get his
wine upon the marketâ he will give it
time. When he doe? this his name will,
after a while, bi known everywhere, and
only the capacity of his vineyards will
set to the limit to his income. This is ex
actly what I believe. I have made a study
of these things. 1 go about with my eyes
open, and I have been brought in touch
with more wihe-drinkers and wine-drink
ing than most men. lam hail fellow well
met as well on the Bowery as in the up
town clubs, and I know something about
these things. It is net because a wine is
made ir. France that it is called for, but be
cause the French wines are what the Cali
fornia wines might be maJe. The French
wines with their heavy duty cost $32
a case and thereabouts. As good wines
can be set down In New York â with the
treatment I speak ofâ for $10 a case, can be
sold for $1* a case and manufacturer and
dealer make as much money as in hand
ling the French wines.
"We have a champagne in the New York
market at that price, but everybody knows
what it :s. It is made within the borders
of the State out of a white wine and car
bonic acid gas. Ciaret and white wine are
raade in California fully equal to that
brought from Germany and France. I ex
pect to be able to say the same of Cali
fornia champagne before many years and
witness the supplanting of the foreign
article by the home product."
And so saying Mr. Depew took the
elevator and joined the others of his party
at dinnerâ the fact that they were waiting
having been announced.
The distinguished visitors, under the
ciceronaee of Colonel C. F. Crocker, went
up the Napa Valley as far as Calistoga yes
terday. They left the hotel shortly after
10 o'clock and in Colonel Crocker's car,
and accompanied also by A. D. Wilder,
male the run first to Vallejo Junction.
There they boarded the steamer Amador
and were carried up the bay as far as Mare
Island. No landing was made, the time
being so limited, but the steamer ran on
up paÃt all the historic ships in the har
bor. Returning to South Vallejo
the journey by rail was re
sumed and the more notable of the
vineyards and wineries of the beautiful
Napa Valley were visited. They stopped
at St. Helena, and in carriages rode to the
GnystOM winery and distillery, the larg
est in the State. Afterward they went to
Beringer Brothers' winery and storage
tunnels.
Leaving the Beringers they drove to the
famous Intrlenook winery at Rutherford,
whe r e thoir special train awaited them for
the return.
To-dny there is a long programme, to
begin with a boat-ride round the bay,
visiting all the points of special interest â
the Union Iron Works, Fort Point, Sausa
lito, Aleatraz, Angel Island and the forts.
Later there will probably be a visit to the
Cliff Hous*, and in the evening the banquet
at the Union League Club. Dr. Depew
alone of the party will be the guest here,
as Mr. Vanderbilt and the others had
previous engagements.
The banquet will be held in the Maple
room of the Palace Hotel. The number of
plates had not been determined last
evening.
Colonei Stone, speaking of the arrange
ments, said: "There will be few speeches.
The dinner is dated at S, to continue to
12. That is not long enough for the 300
members of the ciub who can talk well
and who would each of them like to make
a speech. Mr. Depew would not sit at
table after midnight Saturday. So the
speakers will be few. "
Colonel Stone w:ll be master of cere
m , nies and toast master. The guests will
assemble at the clubrooms and march to
the Maple room.
Mr. Depew and party will attend services
at Grace Episcopal Church to-morrow
morning.
By the way, Mr. Depew says he was
rather disappointed with Chinatown. He
thinks it a rather Americanized China
town, *and with the same degree that it
loses its Orientalism it loses interest. He
found little, he said, that was novel. What
he saw, however, did not impress him with
the Chinaman favorably as a thing to be
grafted upon the country.
"Living the life they do, packed together
as they are, the Chinaman does not recom
mend himself to American institutions.
Still, people tell me they have their place
here and are necessary. Ido not know.
We do not have them in the East in suffi
cient numbers for them to become a factor,
and l do not know about it."
AN EASTERN CRACK BEATEN.
Louis Haftshag<*n Wins the Swimming
Match With C. J. Waters.
In the swimming tournament at the
Sutro Baths Thursday evening the great
event was the special race between Louis
Hasshagen, the local expert, and C. J,
Waters, the crack of the Imperial Swim
ming Club of New York, the distance be
ing seventy-live yards. It was won by
Hasshagenj who "beat his opponent by
three seconds. Waters led nt the start and
up to within ten yards of the finish, when
liasbhagen spurted, took the lead and won,
much to the surprise and gratification or
his friends.
The other races were as follows:
Fifty yardsâ P. Ames first, Charles Turner
second. Time, 37 seconds.
Quarter mile, open to all amateurs under 16
years â J. X, I* tiles first, J. K. O'Counor second.
H. Armstrong was awarded first prize
anil Earl Steward second for fancy swim

LEVINGSTON SURE TO WIN
Peculiar Status of the Cele
brated Fair Will Case From
a Legal Standpoint.
There Is No One Left to Protest the
Probate of the Craven or
Pencil Document.
Aj the Fair will case now stands it has
resolved itself into an apparently simple
and, so far as the heirs are concerned, sat
isfactory situation, which leaves the will
of September 24. 1894, belter known as the
Craven pencil will, in a position where
there is no one to assail or contest it, and
incidentally, this will leave Dr. Mark
Levingston, one of the executors named in j
the Craven will, absolutely in control of ]
the situation.
When the casecameup yesterday, Judjje
Slack, on the request of Judge Paterson, :
representing Herman Oelrichs Jr., pro- ' :
posed a continuance, and after some little \
demur on the part of Mr. Delmas, one of
counsel for Dr. Levingston, the case was
postponed until Friday next.
If Judge Slack's rulings are correctâ and
there is at present no question as to their
being soâ no one will be in position to con
test the Craven will when it is presented
for probate.
\\ hen the attorneys for Mr. Goodfellow,
named as a trustee in the will of -'entem
ber XL, LBM, argued and won their point
that only 'H-r>ons in interest could contest
the lirst will this barred Dr. Levingston
from making appearance in that connec
tion. li-.:t, at the same time, it prevented
any but persons in interest from contest
ing the later will, should that be offered
for proba c.
At the time this ruling was made by
Judge Slack it was thought by the attor
neys for Mr. Goodfe'low that the earlier
will would be the first to be tested, but the
turn of the cards which brines the Craven
will first before the court makes the ruling
obtained by Pierson <fc Mitrhell a decided
and powerful boomerang for these attor
neys, as their client now has no standing
in court wheu the Craven will is up for
probate.
So far as Mrs. Oelrichs, Virginia Fair and
Charles Fair are concerned, they are al
ready on record in an unmistakable man
mras being in favor of and believing in
the absolute validity and genuineness of
tbe Craven will, so they will scarcely ap
pear as contestants to this will.
And when Judge Slack declared the!
trust clause of the earlier will void it took
away the standing of Herman Oelrichs Jr.,
one of the minors who would have taken
under the trust clause. Aitiiough Judge
Paterson nominally represents twenty
three other minor heirs in addition to Her
man Oelrichs Jr., it has been admitted that
their interests have been eliminated from
the case, having become merged in those .
of Herman Otlrichs by pre-arrangement.
Thus it will be seen that there will be â¢
actually no one to oppose the probate of
the Craven will, when that instrument is
presented to Judge Slack and a jury. And
this outcome will be a complete victory for
Dr. Livingston, whose case is in the hands
of the law firm of Delmas <fc Shortridge.

TEE BOY WAS NOT SHOT.
How General Sherman's Son Gave In
formatlou to the Knerny.
During the last week the Rev. Father
Thomas Ewing Sherman of St. Louis had
been conducting a mission at St. Patrick's
! Church, Cedar Rapids, lowa. On Monday
; afternoon he tendered a reception to Â»cv- :
j enty veterans of the Civil War, and in con- j
versation told them this story: During the
i war he was a "camp-follower," going in
! when about |8 years old and remaining j
I with his father. General William T. Sher
| man, until the close of the struggle. At :
Black River, on the match from Atlanta i
to the sea, a Confederate was sent under a
flag of truce to Sherman's headquarters.
AJThrins he found the general absent, but
young Thomas was there and inclined to
be communicative when takei upon the
knee of the Confederate.
Drawn into conversation, he bluntly re- ;
marked: "Why. father can whip you fel
lows every time." On being interrogated
aa to how and why he could whip them
the boy proceeded to eive detailed in
formation. "Father has 50;00Q men and so ;
mar.v cannon ; just so many foot and so ;
j many horse soldiers. He has just exactly '
so many men, foot and horse, and so
many cannon at another place." The boy
did not neglect to state that the Northern
troops were well off for provisions, ana how i
and where they could get them when they
wanted them.
QÂ«*Â»Hkl Sherman, after the Confeder
ate's departure, learned of the conversa
tion. "Why," said he, "you young \
traitor. There is nothing for it but that I
you must be court-martialed, and you I
will probably be shot." The boy was not â 
shot, but he was told of the "rules and !
usages of armed forces when at war. â Chi- !

She bought some mousetraps, and, hav

quite safe, took it in.
When he opened it he was horrified to
see a swarm of mice scatter all over his

found a note containing these words:

THE $AN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
CALIFORNIA'S RATTLERS.
| Jon Van Denburgh Has Been
Thoroughly Investigating
the Snake.
PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS.
There Are Five Distinct Species
Found Among the Hills and
Valleys.
John Van Denbrrgh, curator of the de
partment of berpetology of the Academy
of Sciences, lately returned from an ex
pedition through the southern part of
California, has found live different species
of rattlesnakes in this State.
"The commonest of these," said he yes
terday, "is the Crotalus Lucifer, most gen
erally Known as the Pacific rattlesnake.
This species is found in our coast range all
the way from Oregon to San DieÂ«o Coun
ty. It is also found on the western side of
the Sierra Nevada Mountains and in fa
vorable situations In the San Joaquin and
Sacramento valleys. It does not occur in
the desert region at all, but is usually
more abundant where chaparral abounds
and in rocky districts, where it may find

protection from its enemies. This variety f
never grows very large; it rarely exceeds !
three feet in length. It is usually quite i
dark-colored, so much so, in fact, that it is :
often known as the 'black rattlesnake.'
In San Diego County, m the moist coast
region, the largest rattler of California
abounds in uncomfortable numbers. This
is the Western diamond rattlesnake, or '
as he is scientifically named the Crotalus !
atrox ruber. This species sometimes at- !
tains a length of nve and six feet, with a I
body as big around as one of Corbett's
arms. He is not, however, so ferocious as
his name implies, lie is inclined to slug
gishness, and would rather sneak off igno
miniously than engage in open warfare.
But woe to him wno corners one of these
gentry. Their bite is certain and horrible
death. Iv appearance they are of a light
buff and brown color, with scales tipped
with white and their tail is white crossed
: with regular black bars. Their head is
flat and about the size of a silver dollar.
"On the desert of San Diego County
there occurs very rarely another large rat
tlesnake known as Mitchell's rattlesnake,
or Crotalus Mitchellii. The skin of this
species is pepper and salt, with white
underneath, toe general w! he appear
ance in the sunlight giving it the name of |
the white rattlesnake. The real home of I
this species is iv Lower California, bat it is j
. found farther north, and chietty in the '<
I Colorado Valley.
"Two other species are found in the
desert portion of the State, one of which
â  lives in the higher localities, the other
down on the desert proper. Both of these
species are very formidable, and Beret
'< hesitate to stand" for their rights on the
slightest provocation. The oi.e living on j
the desert mountains, the tiger rattlesnake,
or Crot*ius tigris, is somewhat !u stranger
; to the herpetologist, uwing to the inaccessi
ble regions he inhabits, and to his skulk
â¢ ing nocturnal instincts. In this as well as
in ferocity, and in color, he resembles his
namesake, the tiger, and waits until darfc
ness has settled over tt'.e barren wastes of
; his infernal domain before he glides out on
. his expeditions of slaughter.
"The other species that lives in the
lower levels is the most remarkable of all
his family He enjoys the convenient
â¢ faculty of movine sideways. This peeu
, liar characteristic has piven him the name
of the 'side-winder. 1 He is also called,
because of two pyramidal horns, one over
each eye, the 'horned viper, or Crotalus
ceraster.' It is said that the flank move
ments practiced by this tactician among
reptiles greatly aid him in the capture of
: his prey.
"As "a rule, rattlesnakes are more in
clined to save their poison than to use it.
The secretion is- not so rapid as that of the
saliva in the human mouth. In fact, a
! rattlesnake can bite poisonous!}' but two
or three times in quick succession.
"There is no truth to the theory of snake
; mesmerism," continued Mr. Van Den- '
burgh. "The foundation of this idea lies
on two factsâ first, that snakes are largely '<
abroad in the spring time, when birds are j
nesting. The snakes approach a nest to j
gratify their fondness for eggs; tbe old i
birds hover around simply from anxiety
and affection for their young. Again, an!
animal bitten by a snake lives for several i
minutes afterward, and it flounders around j
in a dazed, helpless sort of way from the !
effect of the poison.
"The most peculiar feature about the â â 
! rattlesnake is the rattle. Popular super- '
j stition has it that the rattle increases by
one segment a year, but the fact is tha"t
when the rattle starts a small button j
, form? at the end of the call; this is before I
â¢ the birth of the snake. Afterward a segment i
is added whenever the reptile sheds its |
skin, which takes place at irregular in- j
tervals, varying in length in different
snakes. The length of these periods may
; be six months or a yesr. Also the rattle
; is worn by being dragged across rocks and
segments fall off, so it is absolutely im- i
â  possible to judge accurately of their ace I
I by counting the rattles.
"Several theories have been advanced
! for the necessity of the rattle. It is used
for frightening off larger animals, and,
perhaps, chiefly as a call in the mating
season.
"Rattlesnakes are really the only poison-
I ons reptiles in tnis State* the only excep
| tion being the little coral snake, which is
! found only in the desert near Death Val-
I ley. The other kinds of snakes found in
! the interior rallevs are perfectly harmless
: and are of vast benefit to farmers, killing
! be they do rodents and other email ani
mals that injure plants and trees.
"Arizona, which contains more snakes
j than any other State in the Union, has
: two more species of rattlers than Califor
| nia."
The Williams Case.
There was no session of the United States
courts yesterday, and consequently the United
States Grand Jury did not return a true bIU
against Williams, the accused customs Inspec
tor, as was expected. The indictment has beon
prepared, however, ana the report of the
Grand Jury will be made on Tuesday. The
case has excited much interest in Federal
circles.
WILL REMAIN OPEN.
Supervisor* Decline to Order the City
Cemetery Closed.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors placed on rile
yesterday the petition of the Richmond
district residents who want the City Ceme
tery closed. This is equivalent to refusing
to act on the matter, and in fact the mem
bers of the committee expressed them
selves in favor of letting the cemetery re
main as it is for the present.
Charles H. HubDs, presidentof the Rich
mond District Property-owners' Associa
tion, appeared before the committee and
urged that all resolutions by which grants
of plats in the cemetery to benevolent so
cieties were made be repealed. He said
the cemetery was detrimentel to surround
ing property, and that it was also a menace
to public health. He said he did not de-
Fire, however, that the burial of the City's
indigent dead should be prohibited.
The committee decided that it had no
power to discriminate in the matter, and
that the cemetery could only close when
nil burials were prohibited in the City and
County.
Stolen Bicycles Recovered.
Last Wednesday night Clarence Ensjle stole
two bicycles from the residence ot Mrs. Button,
llti Turk street, and after a day spent in the
tanks he broke down, confessing that he had
sold the wheels to Charles Newall, who claims
to be the agent of the Fenton Wheel Company.
The detectives paid a visit to Newall's place
and found that person hard at work repairing
one of the stolon wheels. The other nad al
ready been painted and was so altered in ap-
pearance as to look like another wheel, and
evidence was found indicating that Newall
had been conductuig an extensive business in
buying stolen wheels. He was arrested and
charged with receiving stolen property. Engle
will be called upon to answer to a grand lar
ceny charge.
THEY MAY SUE OAKLAND.
Fire Underwriters Blame the De
partment Chief lor Heavy
Losses.
AUeged Blunder in Handling the Con
flagration-Did Not Ventilate
Moran's Store.
A meeting of underwriters interested in
the Moran fire at Eleventh and Broadway,
Oakland, was held yesterday in this City.
One indignant underwriter raised the
question whether a suit could not lie
aeainst the city of Oakland for what he
called tbe "destructive incompetence on
the part of the Fire Department."
A committee was appointed to take
charge of the adjustment of the loss, and
it was understood that the suit would de
pend on what would be done by the com
mittee in settlement.
One of the underwriters, who suffered
heavily through the Moran fire, stated
that the fire originated in a paintstore
three doors south. The Commissioners
had just discharged their competent tire
Chief and put in a young man who was
inexperienced. When the firemen ex
tinguished the flames in Moran's store,
instead of opening the doors and windows
to let out the destructive smoke, he pre
vented the owners from ventilating their
own premises, and as a consequence the
Moran clothing stock was damaged fully
50 per cent more than it would have been
were the smoke permitted to escape.
Alfred 8 till man, manager of the f Fire
Underwriters' Association of the North
west, arrived here yesterday from Port
land. Or., and immediately called a meet
ing of the parent board. The locai man
agers met in tbe afternoon at Battery and
California streets.
It appears the Northwestern association
is going to pieces. Walla Walla's local
board resigned recently from the Fire Un
perwriters of the Pacific, just as San
Francisco did a little more than a year
ago, and that menaced the surrounding
cities. Affairs bad come to such a critical
point thnt Manager Stillman was obliged
to hasten to San Francisco and take
prompt action.
What took place at the meeting was ob
served as a strict secret by the underwrit
ers, though it was learned they reviewed
tbe situation and discussed at length some
plan to save the association in the North
west. Other meetings must be held before
tbe question can be settled.
This is said to be the first sign of weak
ness among fire insurance men in the
Northwest, as never before was there a
break or a rate war among them. Rates
up there have been upheld by local agents
and fieldmen despite the wild cutting of
managers in San Francisco.
In Search of a Grip.
John M. Allen of Mississippi, the hu
morist of the Hon3e of Representatives,
was moving np the street with a serious
look on hi 9 face and unusual energy in
his pace, according to the Washington
Dispatch.
"Where are you going, John?" asked
George M. Wendling, the lecturer, who
chanced to meet him.
Mr. Allen, stopping and looking gravely
at Mr. Wendling, replied:
"I am on my way to the meeting of the
Democratic Congressional Committee."
"You look it," commented Mr. Wend
ling. 'What is your committee going to
do?"
Mr. Allen drew a long breath and said :
"We are going to devise ways and means
to get 3 fresh grip on the confidence of the
people."â Washington Pon.

GREAT VELOCITY WANTED
Powder Tests of Big Rifled
Cannon and Mortars at
Presidio.
Uncle Sam Demands the Highest
Speed Known, and a Californian
Reaches It.
Uncle Sam requires that the powder for
some of his best rifled cannon shall be
powerful enough to eend a projectile at the
rate of 2000 feet a second, and yesterday
several tests were made near Fort Point
with the recently mounted 12-inch rifled
cannon and the new 12-inch breech-loading
rifled mortars to determine the power of
some new powder submitted as a sample
for an order of 15,0C0 pounds that the
Uovernment purposes to place where the
requirements shall have been satisfied.
The United States has demanded a
velocity several hundred feet a second
greater than that required by any other
Government. It was said at the time the
standard was raised that some ingenious
Yankee would find a way to reach it, for
up to that time no one had produced an
explosive within several hundred feet of
the 2COO mark. Outside of the United
States Germany has attained tbe greatest
velocity from explosives, but her maxi
mum was 200 or 300 feet less than the
American standard.
It was not a Yankee, but a voting Cali
fornian and a graduate of ths State Uni
yer-ity, that proved most successful in
inventing tbe proper powder. William C.
Peyton, a son-in-law of Dupont, the great
powder kinu, has already submitted pow
der to the Government which has not only
met the requirements for the 5, 6, 8 and 13
inch guns, but has established world's rec
ords with them.
Yesterday's test of the mammoth 12- i
inch breech-loadine ntie was with 450 '
pounds of "'brown prismatic' 1 powder,
made by Mr. Peyton at the works near
iSanta Cruz. A solid cast-iron 1000-pound
projectile was tired through two wire
screens, set 100 feet apart, and placed a few
hundred feet from the muzzle.
The great pun was discharged by eiec- i
tricity, an insulated wire having been
trailed some distance to the rear and con- i
nected with a small battery.
There was a terrific bang and a mighty
"whoof." accompanied by a peculiar trem
ulous aerial concussion and suction that
seemed to affect the immediate spectators
about the shins, and before the great white
cloud could De blown from the muzzle by
the strong sea breeze, another dense cloud,
but of reddish hue.burst out from near the'
water's edge of the precipitous bluff far
across on the Marin County shore.
The half-ton of iron had'struck. and the
spectators stood for a moment longer with
their mouths open, though the necessity
for that precaution against deafneas"was
no longer necessary.
Each screen was'formed of a continuous
wire connecting in one of the under
ground vaults with a small magnet and
making a complete circuit. From each
magnet was suspended a metal rod. and
simultaneously with the destruction of
the screen the circuit was broken and the
rod was allowed to fall. By a nice little
device, consisting of knife-"blade scratches
registered on the falling rod, the velocity
for the 100 feet between the screen was
computed from the interval between the
scratches. Ihe result indicated that the
projectile was going at the rate of 19.73 feet
a second, twelve feet below the 15-foot al
lowance permitted by the Government.
Peyton only took notes of the result that
he might make some change in his secret
formula for the powder.
The breech pressure computed from the
compression of three little copper cylin
ders adjusted in the breech plate showed
41, r SO pounds where the Government re
quired a force of 37,000 pounds.
Five shots were fired during the after
noon from mortars "13" and "15" of the
mortar battery of sixteen pieces. Seventy
pounds of the ?ame kind of powder nurled
800-pound projectiles of solid iron fiva
miles out to sea, the approximate results
announced by Lieutenant Lissack. who
had charge of the tests, being 1050 feet
velocity and 29,000 pounds breech pressure,
where the requirements for the 12-inch
mortars called for only 1020 feet a second
and 27,r>00 pounds pressure.
The mortars were tilted up at an angle
of 45 degrees, and the four-foot slug-shaped
mass of iron could be plainly distinguished
during the first few seconds of its flight.
Then, after a time that seemed to be min
utes, there would be a spout of water per
haps fifty feet high far out in the ocean.
The actual time of passage through the
semi-circumference was really 45 second;*.
In two of the mortars "black hexagonal"
powder was used, but the results will not
be known until to-day, the velocity in the
case of the mortars beine obtained from
the point of contact as reported from two
coast stations, and afterward located on a
map of squares into which the ocean out
side the heads is platted.
The Shape of the Enrth.
A country schoolmaster was coaching
pupils for the early examination, and, hav
ing before him the junior class iv yeo-'
--rapny, he asked:
'Car. any little boy or girl tell me the
shape of the earth?"
To this there was no answer.
"Oh, dear me," said he, "this is sad!
Well, I'll give you a token to mind it.
What is the shape of this snuff-box in my
hand?"
"Square, sir." replied all.
"Yes, but on the Sabbath day, when I
change my clothes, I change this snuff
box for a round one. Will you mind that
for a token?"
Examination day came, and the clasa
was called.
"Can any little boy or girl tell me the
shape of tue earth?"
Every hand was extended, every head
thrown back ana every eye flashed with
excitement.
One little fellow was tingled out with a
"You, mv little fellow, tell us."
"Round on Sundays and square all the
rest o' the week !"â Spare Moments.
When Wordsworth was made poet lau
reate he had to borrow Samuel Rogers'
dress coat to go to court in, and. strangely
enough, when laureate honors fell oh
Tennyson, he, too. borrowed Rogers' very
coat for the same purpose.
Mrs. Porter of Ilillsboro, Or., announces

.11 .Ilk. tfVuÂ° U caU. CatalOSne *â â¢HARMONY IN THE
FIFTH DISTRICT
The Call for the Primary
Election Easily Agreed
Upon.
ADOPTED AS FIRST READ.
The Entire Committee and Not
Individual Members Will
Control the Election.
TWELVE DAYS OF PREPARATION
County Ccmmitteemen of the Fifth
Will Act in Harmony With
Those of the Fourth.
The Republican primaries for that por
tion of San Francisco lying in the Fifth
Congressional District were arranged last
niglu at a harmonious meeting of the
seven members of the County Committee
in that district.
The call as read the night before was
adopted with but one dissenting vote. Ttie
tall is the same as that adopted in the
Fourth District, and it also names the 15th
inst. as the date for the primary election.
The arrangements for the election are
now exactly as they would have been had
thÂ« call bÂ«en issued by the County Com
mittee as a whole and by the unanimous
rote of the eighteen members. The ar
rangements, plan, regulations and safe
guards contained in the call were unan
imously approved night before last by the
eleven county icomrnitteemen of the
Fourth District, and Mr. Thompson, who
voted against adoptin g the call as read last
night, objected only to one detail of the
pi an.
The naming of election officers, the se
lection of polling-pliices and other details
within the jurisdiction of the County Com
mittee will be harmoniously attended to
during the next few days by "the commit
teenien of tlie two districts actintr as sep
arate county committee*. The call, the
main features of which were given in The
Call of yesterday, contains especially
tstrong safeguards which guarantee an
untrainmelcd expression of the will of
the voters as to who shall represent them
at Sacramento and an honest count of the
ballots which will place all factions on an
equal footing.
The adjournment taken the night before
was chieiiy due to the opinion that the
call itself should segregate the election
precincts of each Assembly district into
two voting districts, two polling-places in
each district being ordered. The adjourn
ment was partly due to the difference of
opinion about who should have the power
to give credentials to watchers in the poll
ing-place-, and this is the only point about
which any difference of opinion has arisen.
All the members of the committee were
present last evening when Chairman Man
waring called tbe meeting to order in the
office of .Tames Alva Watt in the Mills
building.
Keon Dennery, whqÂ«e seat as the mem
ber from the Vorty-tirst District was de- ;
ilared vacant some time ago on account of '
his having moved out of the district, was
; the half dozen spectators present.
Daring rollcall he rose and briefly entered
a formal protest, claiming to be still a
member of the committee. Chairman
Manwaring ruleJ that he was not a mem
ber of the committee and that lie had no
right to speak. Dennery asked to have
his formal protest noted, and he was
cheerfully assured that it would be.
The call read on the previous evening
was brought before the meeting, amended
by the creation of two polling-places in
each Assembly district.
.Tames Alva'Watt called attention to the
notice of reconsideration given by Jesse E.
Marks at the previous meeting. This
notice related to the vote which defeated
the amendment to the call offered by
Watt providing that credentials to wateh
trs representing different tickets in a
iii-tritt might ue issued by the chairman
secretary "or the cjunty committee
man " instead of by the chairman and
secretary on the written recommendation
ol a majority of the candidates on a ticket.
The committee decided not to reconsider,
Mark*, Thompson and Watt voting aye,
and Manwaring. Clinch, Jackson and
Avers voting no.
Jesse E. Marks offered a resolution
amending the call, by providing that the
ci.tire conduct and control of the election
in each Assembly district be vested in the
nty committeeman in each district, he
itct rolling-places, appoint election
< tlieers. Lave absolute control and receive
tlie returns. The amendment was de
feated, Marks and Thompson alone sup
porting.
Then I. H. Thompson offered an amend
ment providing that when tnere are two
ticket- in a district, each ticket 6hall be
represented by a judge and a clerk, the in
spector to be agreed upon by both sides
and all election officers to be men of good
character and standing. This resolution
was lost by a vote of 4to 3. There was
no discussion of either resolution.
Messrs. Marks, Watt and Thompson
favored shortening the hours during which
the polls are to be open, the hours fixed in
the call being from 9 a. m. to 7 P. M.
Everybody agreed to leave this matter
with the representatives of the Fourth
District.
A vote was then taken on the call as
read and on motion of Jackson, seconded
by Ayers, it was adopted by six votes.
Thompson voted no, but observed it was
vi ry isearl}' satisfactory to him.
It was decided to adjourn until next
Thursday evening, when the committee
Will meet at a place to he selected by the
chairman after the rejruiar meeting of the
County Committee, which will occur that
evening.
On Thursday evening the Fifth District
committee will act on the nominations for
Hection officers which will then be sub
mitted by the members. Similar action
will betaken by the Fourth District com
mittee next Monday evening.
'1 he apportionment of delegates made in
the l-'ifth District election call is as fol

fifth.6; Thirty -sixth, 7; Thirty-seventh, 8;

REPUBLICAN MEETINGS.
Proceedings of Various Organizations, Old
and New.
. Republican club and other meetings are
rapidly becoming more numerous through
out the City with the rapid rise of cam
paign interest and the return of harmony
in the ranks.
The Republican Executive Council held
a regular meeting last evening in Judge
BahrY courtroom at the City Hail, Judge
M. Cooney presiding. The executive com
mittee - reported in favor of . a campaign
committee of eleven. After long discus
sion it â was dec!'i;d' that the executive
committee should be â  the -campaign
committee. A committee consisting of
Secretary Oscar Tolle, J. H. Rabies and
Joseph Scncerer was appointed to secure
permanent headquarters. A small dele
gation of ladies, including Mrs. Nellie j
Holbrook Blinn nncl Mrs. Addie L. Ballou,
was present in behalf of woman's cause.
The ladies mentioned spoke briefly, and
the council declared that it would give its
moral support to the cause.
The Ocean View Republican Club of the

D. Daly for ' is activity in the same line.
There will be a mass-meeting of the Re
publicans of the Thirty-tirst District at
Teutonia Hall on Howard street, between
Ninth and Tenth, next Thursday evening.
A Republican club was organized last

THE CONTINENTAL LEAGUE.
The Kepublican Club Adopts a Con-
siitutioii for Its Government.
The Republican Continental League,
lately organized at 1017 Larkin street, held
its regular weekly meeting last night.
Frank D. Worth, president, called the
meeting to order. Secretary Maurice
Asher reported that 150 Republicans had
signed their names to the membership
list and pledged their honor to support
the nominees of the party, both National,
and municipal.
Will E. Fisher, chairman of the commit
tee on a constitution for the government
of the league, reported the work of his
committee, which was adopted.
Treasurer W. T. Kibbler reported that
the league was in a healthy financial con
dition and that no fears need be enter
tained of their being sufficient funds to
keep the league in good working order
during the campaign.
President Worth stated that the ques
tion of uniforms, transparencies and oan
ners had not vet been considered, but that
he would in t lie near future apDoint a com
mittee to look into that matter.
It is not the intention of the Republican
Continental League to take sides with
irresponsible self-made bosses, but to stand
solidly together for the success of the Re
publican nominees, irrespective of the
personnel of tbe man or men who may be
intrusted with the local leadership.
C. P. GIBSON'S PROPERTY
His Brother Carried It Away
From the Sorrowing
Widow.
The Higher Tribunals Will Be Called
Upon to Settle a Nice Point
at Law.
The question as to whether a dying man
; can disregard his wife's community inter
jest in his estate and give it all away to
relatives is a nice point of law which will
i be discussed shortly in the highest courts.
| The particular case at issue, which will
cause wise Judges to ponder, arises from
i another, which was handled yesterday by
i Police Court Judge Low.
J. A. Gibson was the defendant. He
was accused of taking |2J2,500 in money,
bonds and other valuables from the pos
session of Mrs. Charles Frederick Gibson,
his sister-in-law, the complaining witness.
Judge Low dismissed the case, owing to
the fact that the defendant showed he was
guiltless of any criminal intent, but the
proceedings, as far as they went, developed
points that are of great interest.
it seems that on March 31 Charles F.
Gibsondied in this City. He was a well
known sporting man, whose custom it was
to keep plenty of money where be could
lav his hand upon it at a moment's notice.
When he was lying at death's door his
wife was summoned from Sacramento,
where she made her residence, and when
; she came here she found she had been pre
! ceded by her husband's mother and
; brotner. The latter was not a very con
genial person in the opinion of the
sic-K man, and Mr?. Gibson wondered how
it ever came that he, of all others, was by
; the side of the sick man's bed. She learned
the reason later on.
The day after the wife's arrival here
â¢ $22,500 in currency and coin disappeared
I from C. F. Gibson's rooms, the brother
having taken it to Sacramento without
making the widow or the other friends of
I the sick man acquainted with the move.
After Gibson's death, the widow caused
' the arrest of his brother, who yesterday
: produced a receipt signed by Mrs. Emma
York, the mother of the deceased, to the
: effect ttiat he had turned the money over
Ito her. Hence the dismissal of the crimi
j nal charge against Gibson.
Attorney J. E. Richurds, who, with
Delmas & Shortridge, has the interests of
Mrs. Gibson in hand, was enabled while
[ the defendant was on the stand to learn
i many interesting points which will go
] down to making legal history.
Gibson told how the money was handed
I over to him for safe keeping by Mrs. York,
| the dying man's mother, to whom he sub
| sequently returned it.
Mrs. York, not being in court, could not
i either corroborate or refute the testimony.
Her son, However, went on to say that
| wlien his brother was dying he turned to
i his mother and verbally presented her
i with what was practically his onr.ire
! estateâ s22,soo. There were no witnesses
to the presentation, according to J. A.
Gibson's testimony, but he felt satisfied
that the presentation was made.
Up. Gibson has, through her attorneys,
secured special letters of administration
on her husband's estate and has tiled
bonds in the sum of $4-0,000.
Judge Coffey has issued citations for J.
; A. Gibson and Mrs. Emma York requiring
; them to be in court next Tuesday morn
i ing to answer questions pertinent to the
j caÂ«e at issue.
Died After Being Insured.
Anna Mary Kearney, 39 years of age, died In
her residence at 2420 Post street, on the 2d
inst., under circumstances which have taken
on a suspicious aspect. In consequence her
body was yesterday removed to the Morgue,
where an autopsy will be held to determine
the exact mdm of death. Mrs. Kearney had
been fin invalid for a number of years, and
; during the last Jive weeks of her life had two
j physicians. I>r. Adler and I>r. Shumale, con
â¢ Ma'ntly attending her. The day preceding her
j death, deceased took out a life-insurance
policy for $1000, on the 25 cent system.
When the attending physicians discovered
thin fact, although expecting the woman to
i die at any moment, they refused to sign a
! death certificate, as they wished to be relieved
1 from all responsibility in case of a suit over
', the payment of the policy.

FAIRLY STARTED.

MORE TROUBLE FOR PAINTERS
They Learn That Many "Friendly"
Bosses Are Pledged Against the
Card System.
The big labor union strike in which all
the building trades in this City are in
volved is now fairly on.
The first blow was struck yester-
When the Workmen on the Parrott Building Quit Work Last Night They Were Served With Notices
That the Building Had Been "Struck."
day afternoon at the Parrott building.
The grievance committee and the
business agents of the Building
Trades Council met the contractors and
superintendent of the structure yesterday
afternoon and endeavored to have the job
unionized. The attempt was a failure so
far as two of the contractors were con
cerned, although the superintendent and
manager of the Emporium desired a set
tlement. Several of the other contrac
tors stated that they would not
stand in the way of the unions, but
would withdraw their men without
prejudice. The business agents of the
council decided to call a strike on the
building, and when the workmen were
leaving the building at 5 o'clock, the fol
lowing notice to strike was served upon
all:
The council in the evening indorsed the
strike and promised to strike every "un
fair" job in the City one at a time.
A remarkable feature is that the trades
unions are gathering strength in numbers
on the eve of a strike that promises to be
come general and last indefinitely.
The Master Painters' Association in this
issue publishes a list of those employing
painters, members of the organization,
who are pledged not to recognize
the working card upon which the
main fight is based. This will cause a
sensation in the ranks of the union paint
ers, many of whom are now working in
these shops upon the supposition that they
were unionized.
From present indications this strike will
be one of the largest this City has ever
witnessed.
THE CONFERENCE.
The Parrott Job Could Not Be Set-
tied and It Was Decided to
Strike.
The grievance committee of the Building
Trades Council and Business Agents It. T.
Mclvor and H. M. Saunders went to the
Parrott building at 2 o'clock yesterday for
the purpose of settling the difficulties if
possible. It transpired that it was impos
sible, and but one course was left for the
representatives of the council to pursueâ
strike the entire job.
The first, one in authority was the super
intendent of the building, to whom the
commiitee made Known its grievances.
Its demands were summed up in a few
words. The council wants the Parrott
building to be a union job. N. P. Kuss,
the painter, has a gang of non-union
gainters at work in the same line with J.
t. Denis & Co.'s union painters. An
other, Charles J. Bruschke, manager of
the Ban Francisco Furniture Manufactur
ing Company, has a gang of finishers tak
ing the places of carpenters. Mr. Stanford
was asked to use his influence to induce
these contractors to unionize their men,
to which he replied:
Gentleman, rather than have any difference
witti the building trades or any other body, I
would be willing to do all in ray power to
straighten out any matter. But the situation
is this. Mr. Kuss and Mr. Bruschkc have con
tracts to do certain work, and are under
bonds to fulfill their obligations. Ido not see
how we can compel either of these contractors
to unionize their men or discharge workmen
now. It is out of our hands, and if we attempt
to interiere with those contractors fulfilling
their contracts they can come upon us for
heavy damages. Now firuschJte's contract is
for about $35,000, and it would be pretty hard
for us to pay #18,000 or $20,000 damages.
At this point, A. Feist, manager of the
Emporium stores, joined the group with
Mr. Kern, a contracting carpenter, who
has a lot of union men employed in the
building. Mr. Feist declarea his position
at once as favorable to the union and
union demands, but like the superinten
dent, he saw no way of inducing the con
tractors to change their policy. TU see
what I can rto with Bruschke," remarked
Feist, who lelt the group and went to a
man who stood some distance away eye
ing the men with anything but a pleased
expression on his face. Mr. Bruschke is a
short, stout man, with a round face,
partly covered with bushy side whiskers.
His eyes are a light blue and are protected
with large glasses. Mr. Feist came back a
few minuteÃ laÂ»er and shook his head, re
markins, "Can't do anything." A gen
eral discussion of the labor situation "fol
lowed, and a few minutes later Bruschke
came up to the group and the superin
tendent explained again what was wanted,
to which Bruschke indignan'.ly exclaimed :
I have nothing to do with these persons. I
am ft free-born American citizen and my men
are free American citizens. 1 will not be dic
tated to by anybody. Who are these men?
What are they doing here? They are trespas
sers on private property and should be thrown
out of this building
"Hold on there, Mr. Bruschke," ex
claimed the superintendent, "you are go
ing too far. These gentlemen are not tres
passers and they are acting as gentle
men."
At this point Mclvor broke in heartily
and said :
Trespassers? That is not true. We are here
upon the invitation of the superintendent and
others who are gentlemen and we will not
stand any insults and bulldozing from you.
This is San Francisco, and not Chicago. We
came here on n mission of peace and not to
tight, if we can avoid it, nor to !>p grossly in
sulted. You claim to be a gentleman, but yon
evidently do not understand the first princi
ples, to judge by your actions and your lan
guage. You are not in Chicago noiv,
This reference to Chicago was based
upon troubles that the contractor is said
to have had in the Windy City with the
labor unions. To this Bruschke answered,
defiantly:
Yes, I fought in Chicago and I'll fight again
âyes, to the bitter ena. It is tight; do you un
derstand?
D. J. McCartney took thi9 up and an
swered : "Then, right it is, Mr. Bruschke,
and to the bitter end, as you say.'
Several others joined in the wrangle,
and every one ecnoed the word, "Fight !"
"I am very sorry, gentlemen," remarked
the superintendent, "but I am powerless
to do anything one way or the other."
He shook hands with thedelegates as they
departed from the building. There were
two other men with whom the representa
tives of the council shook hands. They
were St. Denis, the painter, and Mr. Kern,
the enrpenter. The latter stated that he
did not, feel aggrieved at the stand taken
by the council, and that he would not
throw any obstacles in the way.
THE STRIKE ORDERED.
Union Men in the Parrott Building
Directed to Strike the
Job To-Day.
As soon as the reprerentatives of the
Building Trades Council withdrew from
the Parrott buildiug they went to 115 Turk
street and held a short conference which
ended in ordering the Parrott building
struck to-day. In order to notify all the
union men what action had been taken
several hundred cards were printed for
distribution as the men left the building.
All of the workmen left the building by
the Jessie-street exit. When the 5 o'clock
â whistle blew Saunders, Mclvor, Bean, Mc-
Cartney, Rose and several others were
there With the notices to quit duly stamped
with the seal of the council.
To many of the workmen the notices
were a surprise, but many were fully
posted. One of the carpenters on emerg
ing from the building, remarked:
I don't want it. Kern told all of his men
the.t they were not to return to work until the
strike is settled. We will get our jobs back all
right when this is over. St. Dems stands pat,
too. Ho told his men that he would find work
for them on the outside until the strike on the
building is declared off. None of us will come
back until we are told.
"While the men were pouring out of the
building Sergeant Davis and a patrolman
stood near the entrance and kept the men
from congregating on the street and side
walk. P2very one seemed to take tha notice
good naturedly. The non-union workmen
were easily recognized by the fact that the
majority refused to take a card and by
their hurrying away. No remarks were
made by the strikers to the non-union
men.
THE PLAN OF ACTION.
No General Tie-Up Will Be Ordered,
but Unfair Jobs Will Be
Struck Singly.
The Building Trades Council held a
special meeting last evening, and the situ
ation of the strike was discussed. Business
Agents Mclvor and Saunders reported that
i they had called out ail the union men on
! the Parrott building, and their action was
j heartily endorsed. J. McCartney, of the
i grievance committee, reported that he had
used his best endeavors to have the diffi
culty settled by arbitration, but that the
! representative of Kuss, the painter, and
I Bruschke, of the furniture manufacturing
j company, had flatly refused to settle, com
promise or arbitrate on any terms.
A report was made that the numbers'
and Electrical-workers Unions had sent
word that they would stand by the strike
in the Parroit building and walk out with
the rest. It was decided to request all
unions und those m sympathy with the
cause of the strikers to join in the move
ment.
Attention was again called to the non
union lathers at work on the Logan job on
Post and Larkin streets. As it was stated
that the contractor had violated an im
plied promise to get rid of the objection
able men by Thursday noon the council
decided to strike his job a3 soon as the
Parrott building matter is well in hand.
It was suggested that every '"unfair" iob
in the City be struck to-day, but the
council decided that rather than stagnate
trade by one blow it would be Defter to
strike one job at a time.
The council will meet again to-night.
The Strike Indorsed.
A long and interesting meeting of Car
penters' and Joiners' Union No. 22 was
held last evening. The delegates to the
Building Trades Council came in late in
the evening and reported the strike on the
Parrott building. The action of the dele
gates ana business agents was indorsed
with cheers. Notwithstanding that a big
strike has just begun twenty-three new
members were initiated. All of the mem
bers were instructed to keep away from
all struck jobs.

The Master Painters List Bosses
Who Will Not Recognlzs
the Card.
On Wednesday evening the Master
Painters' Association held its regular
meeting. At that gathering the employ
ing painters expressed considerable dis
pleasure that the striking painters had
claimed that certain of their members had
unionized their shops. They stated that
their members had pledged themselves
not to recognize the working-card system,
and in order that there might be no mis
understanding they would publish the list
of all who took the pledge.

THE PAINTERS' STRIKE.
The Union Confronted With a Seri
ous Question Concerning
Friendly Shops.
The situation of the striking painters
wan not materially altered yesterday, but
will be to-day. When a week ago a large
number of union painters were given per
mission to return to work in friendly shop 3
it was with the understanding that the
employing painters in question had con
ceded to the union's demands and had
unionized their shops. Upon that under
standing from 350 to 400 painters returned
to work.
The Master Painters' Association to-day
publishes in this column a list of those
who have pledged themselves not to recog
nize the working-card system of the union.
That this will cause another serious situa
tion goes without saying. The union
painters working in the pledged shops will
either be obliged to walk out again or dis
regard the card system, to which they are
bound by their union obligations. To-day
this question will probably be decided.
SHINGLERS ORGANIZE.
They Are for the Card and Appoint
Delegates to the Building
Trades Council.
The shinglers met at 113 Turk street last
evening and perfected their organization
and elected the following permanent of
ficers: E. Murphy, president; H. Byrnes,
vice-president; W. E. Irving, secretary;
B. McGrath, financial secretary; E. J.
Davis, treasurer; L. C. Smith, sergeant
at-arms. AH of the shinglcrs in the City,
about 50, are enrolled as members of the
organization.
It was determined to stand by the card
and three delegates, George Barker, "Wil
liam Doyle and H. Thompson, were chosen
to meet the Building Trades Council to pro
cure a charter, etc., next Thursday even
ing.
Committees were appointed on halls and
printing and tiie meeting adjourned to
meet in the same place Friday night.
COOKS AND WAITERS.
The Naw Organization Supports
the Labor Council.
The cooks and waiters held a meeting
last evening to effect permanent organiza
tion. T. A. Holland occupied the chair
and James Brown acted as temporary sec
retary. A constitution was adopted and
it was decided to have t lie union known
as the Cooks' and Waiters' Society of San
Francisco. They decided to join the
.Labor Council and have nothing to do
with the alliance or any other political
organization.

OFFERED A WATER PLANT.
Owners of the Castro Lakes
Rights Desire to Sell Them
to the City.
SAY THE SUPPLY IS UNLIMITED
Supervisors May Visit the Reservoir
Which Is Said to Be a Living
Spring.
George A. Knight, appearing as attorney J
for the owners of the water rights of the'
Castro Lakes, located near Castroville, |
Monterey County, told the Water Com- |
mittee of the Board of Supervisors yester
day that San Francisco could own its own
water works with an inexhaustible supply
for from $10,000,000 to $12,000,000,
The owners of the rights sent in a com
ruunication to the board some time ago,
in which they stated that they would agree
to furnish the City with water much
cheaper than it is now being obtained, and
yesterday was set for a hearing of the
matter. Since the owners first addressed
the board their minds have somewhat
changed, and they now desire to sell the
entire plant after it has been completed
for a stated sum, the City to take entire
ownership and control.
Mr. Knight saiÂ«{ be merely wanted the
Supervisors to visit the lakes and see what
a magnificent supply it wan, and convince
themselves that it was entirely feasible to
furnish water from that reservoir to San
Francisco. Incidentally, however, he
talked of t*ie advantages of the hikes and
of the low figure at which the City could
buy the entire concern. The lakes, he
said, were nothing but a vast living spring
fed, it was believed, from Lake Tulare
through a strata of gravel, an d having a
daily 'now of 100,01)0,000 sol lons.
lie stated that the present outlet of the
lake is twenty feet wide and eiaht feet
deep, flowing constantly, and that the
depth of the lake showed that the supply
was inexhaustible. So violent was the
current producad by the water gushing
from the earth at the bottom of the lake
that it was impossible to sink a lead and
line deep enough to rind bottom. The fil
tering of the water through many miles of
gravel had purified it coniDletely, and
none better could be found in the country.
"San Francisco pays," he said, "si,
--7.**0,000 annually for water on a valuation
of $25,000,000 for the Spring Valley Com
pany's plant. This plant can be bought
complete for $12,000,000 at the outside, and
the water will be far cheaper and better in
proportion than Spring Valley water."
Engineer Hansborough, who located the
water right, al3o spoke on the matter, and
said that all that was asked was to have
the Supervisors look at the lakes and then
listen to the propositions of the owners.
He said that by the system of pumping in
use in Denver and many Eastern cities
the water could be forced into San Fran
cisco at a uniform pressure of eighty
pounds or more if San Francisco plumbing
could stand it.
It was proposed to lay a five-foot main
to San Francisco and to supply cities
along the line if arrangements could be
made. He stated that the revenue that
could be obtained from this source would
materially lessen the cost of maintaining
the plant should the City decide to pur
chase.
The iieure that had been made on the
plant contemplated a capacity of 36,000,000
gallons per day, or about twice what San
FxancisoQ now uses.
He asked the committee to name a day
and date when they could visit the lake.
The committee could not give a definite
answer, though the matter seemed to
strike the members favorably and took
the matter under advisement.
GOOD FRIDAY SERVICES
His Grace the Archbishop Offi
ciated at the Cathedral
Yesterday.
Impressive Services, With Appro
priate Sermons and Music, at
the Other Churches.
Altars bare of ornaments and sanctua
ries shorn of flowers gave the Catholic
churches yesterday an appearance of deso
lation well in keeping with the anniver
sary of the Savior's passion and death.
All day the chiming bells and pealing or
gans remained silent, what music there
was being exclusively vocal and of sadly
solemn type.
At the Cathedral his Grace the Arch
bishop officiated, being attended by the
Revs. Charles Ramm and Joseph Conway
us deacon and sub-deacon respectively.
The officiating clergymen, robed in black
vestments, proceeded to the altar without
he us ual accompaniment of music, lights
and incense, ana as they prostrated them
selves before the black-veiled cross the
altar was covered with one simple
linen cloth. The required lessons
and responsories having been recited, the
Passion, or the history of the sufferings
and death of Christ as recorded in the Gos
pel of St. John, was chanted by the Rev.
Joseph F. Byrne, Joseph Conway and F.
Hannigan, the chanters being vested as
deacons in plain albs and black diaconal
stoles.
The longr series of chanted petitions for
all conditions of men came next in order,
the Archbishop's rich voice giving a tone
of plaintive solemnity to the words of sup
plication which rendered this portion of
the service moat impressive. The adora
tion of the cross by clergy and people was
followed by the so-called "mass of the pre
sanctitied," a service peculiar to Good Fri
day wherein the celebrant communicates
himself with the particle of ihe eucharist
reserved on holy Thursday.
In the evening the "Way of the Cross"
was led by the Archbishop, and the Rev.
Father Byrne preached an eloquent and
affecting sermon on the Savior's passion.
At St. Ignatius Church, in addition to
the rubrical observances, the devotion of
the 'Three Hours' Agony" was performed,
lasting from noon until 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, the hour at which Christ ex
pired on the cross. Seven addresses or

FEUIT AS A MEDICINE.
Its UÂ§e I* Always Artvnntageons in Cer>
tain Forms <>f Disease.
As a medicine I look npon frnit as a
most valuable ally. When the body is in
that breaking-up condition known as
scurvy, the whole medical profession
look upon fruit and fresh vegetables
as the one and only known remedy. I
believe the day will come when science
will use it very much more largely than
it does now in the treatment of many
of the every-aay ailiaents. Impure blood
means gout, rheumatism, skin diseases,
rickets, and other troubles. As it is proved
that fruit will purify and improve the
quality of the blood, it must follow that
fruit is both food and medicine com
bined. In fevers 1 use grapes and straw
berries, giving them to my patients in
small but frequent doses â orangea
and baked apples if tne others are not ob
tainable. For rheumatism plenty of lem
ons are invaluable. White girls, with
miserable, pallid complexions, want a
quart of strawberries a clay; where these
are not obtainable, bananas, which contain
much iron, are a good substitute. Prob
ably, of all fruits, the apple stands
unrivaled for general purposes in
tiie household; either raw or cooked
it can be taken by nearly everybody, and
it contains similar properties to the other
more delicate fruits. To nij* mind the
pear is more easily digested than the ap
ple and for eating uncooked is superior to
it. Dried fruits should be used when green
cannot be obtained. If soaked for a few
hours before cooking they make a capital
substitute for fresh fruits and they com*
cheaper to the consumer.
For preserving fruit I look upon bottling
in glass bottles as the coming thing. Not
by the uÂ«e of chemicals, such as salicylic
and boracic acids, and the various pre
servatives made from them, but simply
by protecting it after cooking from
the fermentative germs in the atmos
phere. It keeps lor year 9, turns out
even more palatable than green fruit,
is equally digestible, and contains all the
virtues of freshly cooked fruit. Canned
fruit is not so good; the acid of the fruit
dissolves up tin and. lead from the tin, and
I have seen very serious cases of illness as
a result. Besides, fruit should be cold
much cheaper in bottles than in tins, as
the bottle can be returned and used
again. â Popular Science Monthly.

THE WHEELMEN.
Great Interest Is Beinsr Manifested
In the Coming Relay Race.
The great arnual relay race to be run
around the bay Sunday, April I' 2, is now
the only thing you will hear the club
wheelmen discussing, and as it is the
principal topic with them it is also
naturally bo with the majority of un
attached riders, for there is no cycling
event the whole year round which attracts
as much attention and interest as this
race.
A few of the clubs have announced the
men who will ride on their teams, but the
poÃilions they will take will be kept secret
until the last moment. Entries must be in
the hands of Chairman Stratton of the
Associated Clubs by next Thursday, April
fi. and not until ttien will all the teama,
riders, trailers and positions be known.
The relay course has been remeasured
and changed quite recently, as follows:
Starting from Varney's Biclorama, corner
Market and Tenth, to'Brannan, to Protrero
avenue, to Nevada, turning the southwest
corner of the City and county Hospital, to Ne
braska (san Bruno road), linishing on the level,
half mile east of Baden.
Second relayâ Continues on finishing imme
diately in front of slate-colored cottage on Ho
bart stock farm, half mile south of bridge at
fcan Mateo.
Third relayâ Finishes in front of Atherton
estate, two-thirds of a mile north of Menlo
Park.
Fourth relayâ Finishes one mile south of
Mountain View, about midway between two
red tanks.

This club is looked upon to come in first,
second or third at the finish of the race,
and the ten riders named are certainly a
speedy aggregation.
The* Bay City Wheelmen and Olympic
Club Wheelmen are trying to keep the
news of who their riders will be and how
they will be placed as secret as possible.
From pretty good authority the statement
conies that the Olympic team will be made
up of Bornhard, Fuller, Kroetz, Christ,
Davis, Tantau, Coulter, Jones, Edwards
and Foster, and \hat they will ride in
about these positions. There is no cer
tainty as to this, however, and even if it
were so some of the men or positions might
be changed at the last moment.
It is generally understood that Wells,
Griffiths, Hall, Long, Ulbricht, Krafts,
Reid, Harry Terrill, Menne and Languetin
will be on the Bay City Wheelmen's team.
Tom Cooper, the Eastern flyer, may ride
for them if he gets here in time, and Kay
naud, Vincent and other members of the
club are being favorably considered.
The San Jose Road Club will hold a
minstrel entertainment next Saturday
evening. The members will celebrate the

The San Francisco Bicycle Protective
Association met last Thursday morning,
Cal Ewing in the chair, Robert W. Den
nis secretary. The principal subjects dis
cussed at tbe meeting were good roads
and streets, the lighting of Golden Gate
Park by electricity and the construction of
bridges for crossing firehose without en
dangering tbe lives of riders. The execu
tive committee was instructed to co-oper
ate with the newly organized Cycle Board
of Trade in the matter of street improve
ment, etc.
The Liberty Cycling Club has elected the
following officers: George W. Payton,
president; A. C. Gherini, secretary-treas
urer; William Beattie, captain; Fred
Kccii, fiist lieutenant; Frank lrelan, sec
ond lieutenant; 0. St. Denis, sergeant-at
arms; Dr. Frank Thrall, surgeon. To
morrow the club will have a run to thf>
Cliff House. The Libertys will not enter a
team in the coming relay race.
Thomas S. Hall of the Bay City Wheel
men has been a familiar figure on the
path for the past two years and is consid
ered a speedy man. fie rode with credit
to himself and his club at the recent in
door tournament, and will be given a po
sition on the club's relay team this year
as usual.
It is erroneous to believe that bicycle
j riding should be avoided in every case of
heart disease. Physicians who have made
a study of this question declare that it
may even be very beneficial in certain in
stances in which tiie action of the heart is
; feeble and in which signs of fatty degen
eration are found. Increased muscular
exercise almost invariably improves the
I condition of the muscle and of no muscle
: more than the heart itself. There are.
however, several indulgences that peraons
with weak hearts should beware of, such
as straining to climb hills and meeting
j head wiivls, excessive fatigue and particu
: lariy exciting the heart and calling upon
i its reserve tttrength by the me of alco
! holic stimulants and improper food.
The manufacture of the modern bicycle
presents one of the most complex unddeli
: cate problems in mechanical engineering
â a problem more difficult of solution than
| the construction of a bridge, a locomotive
or a twenty -story building. The reason is
that what scientists call the "factor of
â â afety" is lower in the bicycle than in al
most any other mechanical product. In
high pressure guns, for instance, the factor
of safety is even as great as twenty, which
I means that the guns are made twenty
j times as strong as is theoretically neces
sary for the strain they must bear. In
ordinary guns the factor of safety is twelve,
in boilers it is about six, in bridges usually
five and in almost every construction of
machines it is at least four. These wide
margins of extra strength i<re considered
necessary a^ an offset to errors in tiieoreii
cal computations or defect in construction
or material. With jhe lightness of con
j struction in bicycles this is reduced to a
j very small marcin, being as low in some
| instances as 1.25. This being so, one can
readily understand why the makers of
standard machines maintain sucii a rigid
system of inspection.
The Pacific Cycling Club celebrated its
second anniversary last Tuesday evening
by Riving a theater party at the Columbia",
alter which the members enjoyed a ban
quet. Toasts were responded to" p.fter the
supper by President Adolpb llerbst, Vice-
President Frank Scott. Secretary H. Plage
maun, Captain L. W. Pryor. C. W. Ettiug,
H. Paulsen ami Messrs. Itegner, Bourk,
F. ana L. Paulsen, Hartter, bach, Vuughii
and H icks. The jolly party broke up at a
late hour.
Will the claas B records of last year, ami
particularly those wave the few months
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
before the class was given up, continue to
exist? is a question that is being agitated.
No doubt the racing board will decide this
question shortly. They will serve little
purpose, but probably the makers of the
records would like to know that they still
held them. A system of records should be
devised. There are now too many dis
tances at which a rider may try. The
racing board stipulates the time during
which record trials can be made, and why
not the conditions and distances?
The Imperial Cycling Club will have a
run to-morrow to San Leandro, taking the
9 o'clock boat. The final try-out will take
place on this occasion, to fill a couple of
places on the clubs relay team. A special
meeting has been called for Monday even
ing next for the nomination of officers and
directors for the ensuing year.
Vice-President Day of the Pope Manu
facturing Company, who arrived here dur
ing the week from the South with his fam
ily, left for the East last night after a
brief stay. He was delighted with his
Western trip and thinks California the
paradise of wheelmen.
Probably the most popular conversation
when a party of laymen begin to talk of
cycling, is the high cost of wheels, and the
probability of a reduction in prices within
the near future. The favorite argument
is, that with the largely increased number
of bicycle factories in the country, and
new oiies constantly springing up, an over
production must result, and lollowine the
ordinary law of supply and demand, lower
prices should ensue. "Were there only one
urade of bicycles such a conclusion would
not be far out of the way, but from the
present outlook, while there may be an
overproduction of cheap grades, there is a
strong probability that manufactu.ers of
high-grade machines will experience con
siderable difficulty in supplying the de
mand for some time to come."
There is no reason for any outcry against
the price of wheels. In a wheel, the price
of which is maintained at $100, the buyer
is sure cf obtaining his $100 worth, if hot
more, while if he pays but $40, the chances
are vastly against his getting even $40
I worth, gauging the proportionate value
from the $100 wheel.
Meade Mitchell Shields, a well-known
Los Angeles wheelman, now resident in
San Jose, has been in the City the past
few days.
John Hoffmann and John Beale, two
well-known local wheelmen, contemplate
a trip to thn Yosemite Valley on a tandem
early in June, and are already making
their preparations. It is believed this will
be the first time the trip has been made on
a tandem. Spalding.
THE ANGLERS.
Streams In Sonoma County That
Will Be Fished To-Morrow.
Although the season for trout fishing
opened on the Ist inst., very meager re
ports from the streams have arrived as
yet.
Charley Green, Jones and Curley re
turned on Thursday from the Paper
mill, and Mr. Green reports that owing to
a heavy rainfall near Mount Tamalpais
the creek is altogether too high for good
fishing, and that the trout have made
their way up to the headwaters, near
Libertys.
Green caught some small fish on the
riffles, but the sport was poor. He reports
that auite a number of large steelheads
are in the deep pools at Lagunitas Creek
and that some of the anglers who will bnit
fish to-morrow can expect battles royal
ami a cleaning out of tackle.
Lloyd Eaton, Donald McÃae and John
Gallagner fished the Pnnssima Creek in
San Mateo County and had good luck, but
the fish they baskete were small.
Soiiie nice fish were taken from the San
Gregorio by anglers who fished pretty well
up into the bills. The Los Gatos Creek,
near Wrights station, was well whipped
by the anglers of San Jose, and some very
fine messes were taken by those who used
worms and salmon roe.
According to the following letterangling
in streams which are numerous in Sonoma
County will be excellent this year, as
young trout are plentiful and large fish
still remain over to be caught. :
April 3, 1896.
Sporting Editor Callâ Dear Sir : I have just
received information from Gien Ellen that
Sonoma Creek and tributaries arc running full
with fine largo trout. One gentleman caught
seventy-five, averaging 10 to 12 inches in
length, and several others made some excellent
catches. All the streams in Sonoma County
are running full with trout. This is the case
with all tne streams up the line. Reports
from Healdsburg, Oeyserville, Cloverdale,
Hopland, Pieta and Vkiah and Guerne
rilu aro to the effect that there was
never so many trout in the streams. In
some places the water is a little bit high, but
there is most excellent ftahinjr for the opening
of the season. If to-day nnd to-morrow are
warm the streams will nil be in good shape.
Keeping the. Russian River open and the stock
ing done by this company during the past
three years have been productive of wonderful
results.
A double daily passenger service to Sonoma
Valley points, morning irsin leaving this City
at 7:3o o'clock, gives anglers plenty of time to
fish if they have only one day to spare. Yours
respectfuily, R. a. Ryan.
Although seven or eight anglers lett this
City last Tuesday purposely to tish in the
Russian River and its tributaries, nothing
in the way of authentic news has arrived.
Possibly the streams still remain too high
lor iiy nsbine. The best results will be
had during the latter part of this month.
Some very nice trout were caught yes
terday by "William Thompson from the
Wild Cat Creek.
The American Field comments as fol
lows on President Cleveland's appoint
ment of a United States Commissioner of
Fish and Fisheries:
President Cleveland has set at rest the spec
ulations and aspirations of all who have been
anxiously awaiting the appointment of a
L nited States Commissioner of Fish and Fish
eries, in place of the late Hon. Marshall Mc-
Donald, by nominating for the office Cap
tain John J. Brice of California, a naval
communder who was retired a short time
ago on account of physical disabilities.
On March 20 the Senate Committee on
* ifsheries unanimously decided to report favor
ably on the nomination, which is almost equiv
alent to confirmation. To say that this nomi
nation was a surprise to a majority of the peo
ple is but a trite way of putting it. When so
many gentlemen of known scientific attain
ments and experience in piscieultural matters
nave been named as suitable nominees, surely
1 resident Cleveland's action indicates he must
nave some knowledge of Captuin Brice's
qualification that has not become known
to the general public. We undersiand Captain
Brice has had about five years' experience in
the work of the United States Fish Commission,
and that is the total of his term of the study ot
nsn matters. Many other gentlemen, among
tnem one suggested months ago for this posi
"O.oâ Captain Collinsâ would seem to huve
gained by many more years of experience than
Captain Brice higher qualifications for prop
erly conducting the affairs of that very im
portant branch of our National Government.
However, the President's well-known interest
in fish matters leads us to suspend our judg
ment upon this appointment until develop
ments 6 hal prove the fitness or otherwise of
the nominee.
GUN AND DOG.
Withdrawal of Members and Prizes
From the Kennel Club.
On Sunday there will be lively popping
of shotguns at the Oakland track.
The morning shoot will open with a 100-
Dird race, after which will come shoots by
the following clubs: The Electra and
Olympic will smash bluerocKs, and the
California Wine will shoot at live birds.
The Reliance Gun Club will hold its meet
ing at the Lincoln grounds.
The Olympic Gun Club will shoot
against the San Jose Cycling Gun Club
annex on May 10, and the regular monthly
shoots of the club will in future be held on
the rirst Su nday of the month instead of
the second Sunday, as formerly reported.
On May 17 the club, through invitation
of the Stockton Gun Club, will journey to
Stockton, and the two clubs will engage in
a special shoot.
The Pacitic Kennel Club has opened
quarters at 628 Market street, where
entries will dc received for the show
which will open on May 6 at the Pavilion.
The bench show committee, consisting
of Thomas Matson, Clarence Haight,
Howard Vernon and H. Bier, met Thurs
day last and accepted the resignation of
J. G. Barker and Dr. F. W. Evelyn.
Messrs E. Brings and L. D. Owens of the
Olympic Club will respectively fill the
places left vacant by the resignations of
the two former admirers of St. Bernards
and fox terriers.
A committee from the St. Bernard Club
met on Thursday even ng and decided to
withdraw the medals offered by members
of the club for specials at the coming bench
show. Yesterday the committee, after
dispa-sionately reviewing the situation,
concluded not to withdraw the special
prizes, and so informed the secretary of
t .c Pacitic Kennel Club.
Sam Hughes states most emphatically
that the money which he received from
Herman Oelrichs, and which was to be de
voted to purchasing prizes for special
classes consisting of English setters, St.
Bernards and fox terriers, will be used, but
that the prizes will be competed for at the
OaKland bench show and not at the Pa
cific Kennel Club's bench show, as many
dog men supposed.
There is a small clashing of steel among
the leading luminaries of the Pacific Ken
nel, St. Bernard and Fox Terrier ciubs,
which fact is to be regretted by all sports
men who are interested in dog matters.
It appears thai the leading officers of
the Pacific Kennel Club ara not fancied by
some dog men who would be pleased to
have the reins of kennel government in
their hands. The disgruntled ones con
tend that it is time that some of the man
agers who have "been running things
their own way 1 ' during the past two shows
that have been held in this City should
step down from their perches and give
others a chance to distinguish themselves.
But the officers of the Pacilic Kennel
Club can't see the point as submitted, aud
consequently they propose to remain on
deck until they prove to all lovers of the
dog and thr promoters ot bench shows,
etc., that they are ihÂ« right officer* in the
right piace.
Jealousies, however trivia!, should be
cast aside by all parties concerned, and
all true sportsmen who are interested in
the success of the May show should for
give and forget, and all join hands in
making the next exhibition the moÂ«t suc
cessful in every particular of any show
that has been held west of the big, moun
tains.
A number of sportsmen are very out
spoken as regards the action of tne bench
show committee in giving specials only to
firsts in the different breeds. Firsts and
seconds would give far greater satisfaction,
as all sportsmen interested in dogs do not
make a specialty of breeding high-priced
stock just for the honor oi : winning firsts
at bench shows and afterward being able
to realize a good thing from the sale oi a
prize- wi tinner* a puppies.
Sam Hughes has forwarded the resigna
tions of Herman Oelric'is and Dr. Croness
to the secretary of the Pacific Kennel Club.
Ttie following letter from Anuoch has
been received:
Antioch, March 29.
At the club shoot here to-day at twenty-five
singles, known traps, unknown angles, the
following scores were made: Hawkhurst 17,
Ross 15, W. Remfree Sr. 15, W. Reinfrec Jr. 13,
Robert Remfree 13, James Taylor 13. Proctor
12. Williamson 11, Joe Taylor 8, W.Kelly 6,
Altizer 6.
The Brentwood and Martinez Gun clubs
shot last Sunday, and the match was won
by the Brentwood Club, which scored 133
points against the Martinez Club's 80
points.
THE RIFLE.
Annual Shootlner Contests of the
California Schuetzsn Club.
The California Schuetzen Club will open
its season to-morrow at San Rafael Park,
wnere hundreds of riflemen, representing
several of the towns and cities of this
State, will gather to compete in the great
prize-shootinir festival.
The prizes are so numerous that the
poorest marksman cannot help winning
something. The contests will commence
upon tne arrival of the first train that
connects with the early boat from this
City, and a continual cracking of rifles will
be heard until the whistle of the last train
will compel the marksmen to leave the
ranges.
THE OARSMEN.
Crews That Are Trainingâ The
Sleeping Pioneer Club.
The race between the senior crew and
a picked crew of the South End Boat Club
to-morrow over the Lone Bridge course
was the sole topic of interest in local boat
circles during the past week.
It will be remembered that the senior
crew of the club, who are the candidates
for the honor of representing California in
the proposed Eastern trip, defeated this
crew in a three-mile race held two weeks
ago by only a boat length anil a half.
The defeated crew was so elated over the
nhov.ine it made against the flower of the
South End Club that it immediately chal
lenged the latter to a return match, to take
place to-morrow.
The boys have been training mightily
for tue past two weeks and are in splendid
form, and, barring accidents, they ought
to give their more experienced opponents
a hot race.
The make-up of the crews is as follows:
Senior erew â Henry Bode, bow; Bob
Mac Arthur. fornardwaist and captain;
Gus Carson, afterwaist ; Franfc Duplissea,
stroke, and George McGrill, coxswain.
Picked crewâ T. Barry, bow and cap
tain; D. Campbell, forward waist; T. Smith,
afterwaist; George Bates, stroke, and Doc
Flvnn, coxswain.
The officials of the race will be: Alfred
W. Fritz, referee; J. D. Mahoney, William
Thomas and William F. Humphreys,
judges.
The Ariel Club is busily engaged con
cluding preparations for its entertainment
on April 7 at Union-square Hall. The pro
gramme is almost complete, and is one of
the best the Ariels have ever got up.
It is being noised about that Harry Ter
rill, the crack bicycle rider, is going to row
in one of the Ariels' crews in the comine
regatta. The personnel of the crew is as
follows: H. Larkey, bow and captain;
Harry Terrill, iorward waist; George Phe
lan, afterwaist; Henry Whitkopf, stroke,
and Andy Carroll, coxswain.
The Pioneers have kind of lost their
grip with their racing crews. Mr. Â±sren
nan, who trained the crews that made such
good showing last year, tried to get the
boys in training again, but his efforts, so
far, have been futile.
The Pioneers are contenting themselves
with rowing simply for the exercise of the
thing, and leaving the racing /or the more
exnilaratins clubs.
Ed Scully undertook to race Al Fritz
last Sunday in a shell, but hadn't pulled
two strokes before he was precipitated into
the water. He was picked up by Ed To
bin, who happened to be r.ear" by in a
Whitehall.
The Olympic Boat Cub has purchased
two four-oared racing shells from the Co
lumbia Boat. Club of Oakland, whose
racing crew has been broken up,
owing to Graham, the lorwardwaist man,
changing his residence to Santa Barbara.
The officers ot theclub for the ensuing
term are: Captain, Bob Mac Arthur; chair
man, J. K. MoAvov; secretary and treas
urer, E. R. Allisonr
T. R. Keenan is training the Dolphins
for the coming regattas. Last Sunday
both crews rowed from North Beach over
to the Ariel boathouse. This will be their
regular training routine.
The Dolphins pride themselves on their
new coxswain, George Roch, whom they
say is second to none on the bay.
The following shell-rowers will row under
Dolphin colors this year: William Schu
macher, Jack Coughlin, W. A. Patch and
C. J. Morgan.
The club's picnic committee, consisting
of J. J. Cronin, Fre.i Woerner, J. Manor,
Joe Luib and E. P. Sullivan, visited Sunset
Park last Sunday to arrange for the club's
picnic on June 7.
HANDBALL.
First -Class Gamjs That Will Be
Contested To-Morrow.
At the Union court to-morrow afternoon
J. C. Nealon and T. F. Bonnet will play R.
Lenihan and J. J. Feeney, the "cracker
jacks" of the court. The match had to be
postponed last Sunday owing to Nealon's
sickness, but it will positively come off to
morrow afternoon, and one of the cleverest
and most exciting games ever played in
the City may be expected. Lenihan and
Feeney have repeatedly challenged any
two players in the City to meet them in
their own court, and this is the first time
the challenge has been accepted. Nealon
and Bonnet are well-known expert ex
ponents of the game, an<i if they are beaten
it wiil be a great surprise to their friends.
The match will be well worth seeing.
The other games to be played at the
Union court are: Tim Jordan and J. Ken
nedy against W. Leonard and Biliy Mc-
Manus, John McGrath and WÂ« Kehoa
against M. Keneaiy and P. Stapleton, O.
liendry and Professor Lynch iigainst J.
Nelson and C. Johnson, Terry McManua
and James O'Donnell against P. Hutchin
som and D. O'Brien.
No definite action has yet been taken as
to the building of the court for t^e Olym
pic Cluh. The meeting which was to have
been held last Wednesday i as been post
poned till i.ext Wednesday, when a de
cision will be reached. ThÂ« owner of the
grounds has conceded everything, so that
the matter lies entirely in the hands of the
club.
Those who will be present at the San
Francisco ball court to-morrow afternoon
will be treated 10 a few boon of first-class
sport. Manager Phil Ryan will make up
a programme to-day, but the principal
feature will be a four-handed game be
tween two prominent players for a purse
of $ll>o. Hi<di-ciass ball-playing will be
tiie order of tue day.
The handball games to take place at P.
Ryan's ball court Sunday are:
M. McNeil and \V. Manion to pl*y G. Mc-
Donuld ana P. Ryan; \V. Stansbury and J.
White to play R. Murphy and M. Edwards; J

J. Kearney to play J. Lawless and I). Connolly;
P. Donnelly, the amateur champion, and \V
Williams to play .1. Harlow, the coast cham
pion, and G. hutehinson.
Coursing.
Followers of coursing will be surprised
and grieved to learn that Dr. Q. Yon
Hummed, one of the most extensive
owners of greyhounds in the United
States, has decided to withdraw from the
sport and sell his entire kennel, in which
is kept some of the best blood in the
world. Dr. yon HummeM lias been for
years trie leader in coursing east of the
Rocky Mountains, and has several times
visited this coast to run his hounds
against California stock.
To-morrow's coursing at Ocean View
Park promises to be of more than usual
interest owing to the quality of the dopa
entered and from the fact that a fine lot of
bares from the Merced plains have recently
been received. Lord Clifton, Electric
Yreka, Mission Boy and Dublin Stout are
among the entries.
Following is the result of the drawing:

VETERAN OF THE SEAS.
The Labors of Rev. Dr. E. SI. Peaae
Amoug the Bronzed Barbarian*
of the Kqimt'ir.
The Rev. Dr. E. M. Pease, a missionary
of twenty years' experience in the barbarian
islands of the Pacific, near the equator, is
in the City. The doctor is an embassador
of the American Bomd of Foreign Missions
of the Congregational Church, which has
its headquarters in Boston.
He has been doing what lie could among
the natives of the Carolines, and other
islands in that part of the world. He esti
mates tnat there are 5000 natives on the
island of Penope alone. There are 2000
miles of the great arcbipellago. In the
east half of the archipellago, he says, th^re
are from 25.000 to 30,000 natives. It is
there that the doctor and his associates
have been working.
"We have got two missions in the Gil
bert Islands, on the equator," he said,
"where there are. in all, about 20,000 na
tives. In the Marshall gioup there are
some 14,000 or 15,000 natives. We have a
head station there.
"Our work is succeeding very well. I
think it would be a great thing for those
who are unfavorable to mission work if
tiiey could have been in some of those
islands a few years aeo and a^ain at this
time and see the changes that have been
worked with the natives.
"In some of those islands when a vessel
was wrecked they killed every man and
iooted the cargo. Now a wrecked crew
and cargo are as saie on those shores a-i
they would be anywhere in the world.
The natives look out for the poor wrecked
men and feed and care for them."
Dr. Pease will soon leave for Southern
California, where his family has been for
Â»ome time. He has grown gray in mission
work among the South Sea islanders.
JOHN MARTIN IS DEAD
Breathed His Last at the Re
ceiving Hospital Early Yes
terday Morning.
WIFE CHARGED WITH MURDER
Becomes Delirious on Hearing the
Awful News â Attendants Fear
She May Not Live.
John F. Martin, the Deputy County
Clerk, who was shot by his wife on Mon
day last, died at the Receiving Hospital
yesterday morning at 4:15 o'clock.
Up to 12 o'clock Thursday night the at
tending physicians had every reason to
believe that Martin would recover, but at
that hour he became slightly delirious, his
temperature rising very rapidly. Dr. FHz
gibbon, who had charge of the case, was
summoned, and thougn he worked faith
fully for more than four hours oculd not
check the rapidly advancing dissolution.
Stimulants were administered at short
intervals, but further than partially allay
ing the pain did practically little or no
good. Martin evidently appreciated his
condition, as he asked thai the last sacra
ment of the church be administered to
him. Father Hickey was accordingly sent
for and with much solemnity performed
the rite.
At 2 a. m. his foster-mother, Mrs. Chaae,
living at 420 McAllister street, was sent for.
She remained nearly an hour, but Martin
never seemed to realize her presence.
County Clerk Curry came in a few minutes
before the rin;il end, he being the only one
present outside the physician and nurse
when death came.
The body of Martin was removed to the
Morgue soon after death and Dr. Barrett
held an autopsy. He found two bullet
wounds in the body.
The second bullet fired by Mrs. Martin
entered one inch to the left and an inch
above the umbilicus, passing to the left
backward and slightly downward.
There was also a bullet wound in the
back, an inch to the left of the vertebral
column.
Dr. Barrett worked on the body for four
hours and was unable to locate the second
bullet. He said that death was caused
by the bullet that entered the abdomen,
perforating the colon.
This was the shot which Mrs. Martin
fi r ed when the deceased was lying on his
back on the floor of the corridor of the
new City Hal!.
The body was removed to an undertak
ing parlor at 122 Eddy street, whence the
funem! will be held.
Mrs. Martin was not informed of her
husband's death until late yesterday after
noon. When the awful news was finally
broken to her the scene was pitiful a'Â»d
painful in the extreme. Mrs. Foster, her
sister, told the stricken woman the ?ai
story, the latter begging piteously that
one more message be carried to her lms
l and. "He might be still alive," she :-aid,
"and I do iove him so."
Mrs. Martin is a very sick woman, and
unless a change occurs speedily, it was not
thought that she could last through the
day.
It was just 12 o'clock yesterday when
the name of Susan Aiartin* was entered on
the big book in the sergeant's office of the
City Prison.
On the same line, but further out on the
page, appeared the sim (>le word, "murder."
FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT
Attorney Becksly Fined. 810 by Judge
Joachiinsen for Creating a
Scene.
Judge Joachimsen's court was the soene
of a wordy war yesterday between Attor
ney J. A. Becksly and Prosecuting Attor
ney John T. Dare, in which the former
Ciime off second best.
The disturbance aro*e over the sentence
of Mrs. Mary Meager of Bernal Heights,
convicted of disturbine: the peace, and
Becksly worked very bard for ii is client,
arguing that as this was her first oftense
she should be leniently handled. His
Honor informed the attorney that the
woman had heen before him many times,
and lie would be forced to ask her to pay
a fine.
Becksly made another vain appeal, fin
ally turnins; on Attorney Dare, givhig
that gentleman a tremendous tor.gue lash
ing.
"You are jobbing," howled the now
thoroughly angered Becksly.
"Don't you accuse me of cinching peo
ple," replied the prosecuting attorney.
Such attorneys as you ought to be in San
Qnentin."
Becksly was not to be quiefed by any
such remark. "This man Dare is crooked;
I know it," he said, advancing toward tbe
prosecuting officer. DarÂ» waxed very
angry at this, and picking up a convenient
cuspidor was about to hurl it nt the ad
vancing Bcksly, when Judge Joachim
son interposed, finally bringing order out
of chaos.
berkslywas hauled up before the court
by a most willing bailiff and fined $10, or
at the raU v of about $1 a word. He paid
the fine, apologizing to the court at the
snme time.

dence reposed in them by reaching the
wire first.
Probably the most unexpected defeat
was that of Mobalasca, the 11 to 20 favorite
for the fifth event, a five and a half fur
long sprint, who was beaten out in a drive
by Mascota, against which as eood as
60 to 1 was at one time laid. Sir Richard
I was a well supported secoiid cnoice, but
1 was unfortunate in being cut off just as
the barrier was raised and cut little figure
in the running. Tod Sloan on the favor
ite rushed the filly out in front at a great
rate, making altogether too much use of
her the first part of the journey. In the
stretch Slaughter, who had been persever
inc with La Mascota, apparently caught
Sloan napping, and after a drive got the
1 outsider past the wire first by a neck. Pat
j Murphy was a poor third.
The opening five-furlong dash was looked
' upon as a good thing for Ottyanna, and the
! siiort price of 3 to 5 was accepted about
j her. Sue flattered her admirers by hitting
the stretch in the lead, but propped notice
ably on the way to the wire, and was
beaten out handily by Last Chance. Five
to one was offered against the winner at
pos; time.
The imp. Brutus gelding Peixotto, who
appears to be improving with age, cap
! tured the next race at six furlongs hands
down. He remained an 11 to o favorite
throughout the betting, and leading from
i the jump passed the stand galloping, three
lengths before Hazel D-, a 75 to 1 shot.
Figaro was scratched out of the mile
purse event, leaving but four to face the
j issue. Green Morris' Sir Play, with but
8G pounds in the saddle, looked a
"moral. 1 " and the books held him at Ito 2,
although a very little 7 to 10 was even laid.
He galloped off in front and was never
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
headed, winning as he pleased hy four
lengths, with Olive in the place. Montal
lade disposed of Thornhill for the show.
Sam Hildreth's recent purchase, St. Lee,
was another very warm choice, going to
the post 9 to 20 for the mile and a sixteenth
run with five starters. He won, but only
after a hard tussle through the stretch with
Tar and Tartar.
The colt was always in front, closely ac
companied by the Tar. Swinging into the
stretch on nearly equal terms the pair be
gan a ding-dong struggle. Less than a
furlong from the wire St. Lee looked
beaten, but responding to Garner's per
suasivo urging came away under punish
ment and won by half a length. Dungar
ven, weil played for tbe place, was a poor
third.
The black loam covering to the course at
lngleside is evidently not to the liking of
Tim Murphy. Backed from sixes down to
4)4 to 1 in the betting on the last race, a
six-furlong selling affair, he showed very
prominently in front to the stretch, where
the field closed on him. Striking the turn
fourth the 8 to 5 favorite Palomacita went
to the front, winning easily from Walter
J. Tonino nosed Tim Murphy out for the
show.
Track and Paddock Items.
La Mascota appears to be a great filly for
slipping past the wire in front at long odds.
On a previous occasion she won a race at
the .tsay District with the pencilers laying
anywhere from 100 to 150 to 1 against her
chances. Trainer "Daggie" Smith had a
small bet on her yesterday.
Jockeys Harry Griffin and Hewitt left
for the East yesterday to fulfill their
engagements with the Blempton stable.
Shaw could not make the weignt to ride
Tar and Tartar and was replaced by Mack
lin. The col ored chap put up an excel
lent ride.
The horses of Dan Honig, (he St. Louis
turfman, will leave for Roby to-night. All
will be shipped with the exception of
Braraetta, Julia O, Jane Andrew and Win
nie Dee, which quartet will be sent to By
Holly's ranch at Flosden to pass the
summer months. Jockey Garner of
course accompanies the string East. Air.
Honig announced himself last evening as
greatly pleased with his California trip,
and will be one of the early comers in the
fall.
When the barrier dispatched the field
that lined up the second event, Meadow
Lark, a very fretful and nervous horse,
wheeled and started the reverse way of the
track. Ho was fairly well supported in
the bettiiig at very remunerative odds on
the strength of some past workouts.
Bookmaker "Billy" Beverly was caught
out of line on the La Mascota race and was
reported to hare cashed some very rosy
looking tickets on the outside. Ed "Purser
backed Smith's mare to a small extent.
The announcement made in a morning
paper that Thomas H. Williams Jr. had
secured a lease of the Los Angeles County
Agricultural Society's track did not state
whether or not Governor Budd had sanc
tioned the deal. The consent of his Ex
cellency is necessary before the contract
can be closed.
The Pacific Coast Jockey Club has ac
cepted the plans of Architect George H.
Walker for its elegant new clubhouse to
be erected to the west of the grand stand.
Contractor T. J. "Welch, who will superin
tend its construction, will begin work at
the close of the present racing season in
July. The building will be palatial in its
appointments, costing in the neighborhood
of $20,000.
Sir Richard was unfortunate in getting a
poor start, but showed little speed after lie
did get under way. The judges inquired
into his running, but as the stable gave
convincing proof that the horse had been
backed the officials were satisfied that no
attempt at fraud had been tried.
It is really surprising how a change in
tracks affects some horses. Ricardo, a
very useful sort of a horse, was well
backed to win the second event, but
seemed to possess just enough speed to
keep outside of the coin.
Tne officials at lngleside have decided
that the entries of "Tom" Griffin will be
received at that track. Rule 7of the Turf
Congress says, "That rulings of associ
ations not members of the Turf Congress
sha.ll not be regarded except in cases of
fraud." The case of Greeu Morris is cited,
whose entries were received while under
suspension at the Bay District, and as no
fraud is alleged on Griffin's part in connec
tion with the running of Fairfaith, tnere is
no just reason w hy he should not be allowed
to race his horses. Blakely can run his
jumpers at the Bay District, but the entry
of Fairfaith is excluded. Until the ques
tion 01 ownership is definitely fixed the
horse's c-ntry will not be received at lngle
side. This was the substance of a ruling
handed to Secretary Leake yesterday.
STENOGRAPHER'S PLAINT
He Sues F. Alleyne Orr, the
Attorney, for $10 for
Services Rendered.
An Agreement Made That the Statute
Should Not Run Against the
Debt.
Attorney F. Alleyne Orr, who gained
fame and it was supposed fortune, in
settling the claims of the men of the
United States cruiser Baltimore against
the Government of Chile at the time
they were assaulted in Valparaiso by
Chilean soldiers, wa3 sued in the
Justices Court yesterday for $10, the
complaint making some very peculiar
allegations. One is that Orr made an
agreement with the plaintiff that the
statute of limitations should not run
against the debt.
The plaintiff, Robert Williamson, al
leges that within several years last past he
performed services as stenographer and
typewriter at the special instance and re
quest of Orr, of the reasonable value of $80.
That of said $80 plaintiff waived to defend
ant the payment of about $60, the defendnnt
claiming that he could not get the money from
his principal or client.
That of the remaining $20 defendant paid
plaintiff sums in the aggregate amounting to
* 10, from one nickel and upward at a time
und gave the plaintiff an acknowledgment to
keep the statute of limitations from running
against the same.
That tnere is still due and unpaid to plaintiff
the sum of SUO. despite the fact that for nearly
two years plaintiff, two or threo times a week,
generally on the promise of payment frotn
said Orr at a time definitely stated has de
manded it.
That plaintiff has suffered great loss of time
and great and grievous wear and tear of shoe
leather in the efforts to collect from said Orr
which said $10 has not yet fortheome.
"BULL" HARBINOTON DIES.
His Assailant, William MoXulty, Is
Charged With Murder.
James, alias "Bull," Harrington, the
man who was shot by William McNulty in
a street row on Sixteenth and Mission
streets last Friday night, died at 7 o'clock
Jast evening. During the afternoon the
nolice brought McNulty, who is alleged to
have done the shooting, from the prison to
the hospital where he was formally iden
tified by the dying man.
On the night of the shooting Harrington
and another man entered the saloon of
McNulty and at once proceeded to make
things uncomfortable for all in the room.
Tlie two men were finally ejected from the
saloon, but lay in wait on the outside for
McNulty. The latter appeared shortly
afterward, when be was attacked by Har
rington and his companion. The bar
keeper pulled his pistol, firing one shot
which took effect in Harrington's risht
breast.
McNulty was booked at tho Central sta
tion last uight charged with murder.

IS COURSING BRUTAL?
Sportsmen Who Do Not Agree
With the Views of C.
F. Holbrook.
HOW ABOUT BABBIT DRIVES?
A Deputy of the Humane Society
Who Did Not Stop a Blue-
Rock Shoot.
Several members of the Interstate Cours
ing Club, which is recognized as the only
thorough coursing club west of the Rocky
Mountains, were seen yesterday in refer
ence to Charles Holbrook's statement that
coursing is a cruel and beastly sport, and
that he will use his best endeavors to pre
vent coursing within the county of Ban
Francisco.
Dominick Shannon, the president of the
Interstate Coursing Club, said that cours
ing was far lesa cruel than many other
branches of sport.
"We will take, for instance, horse-racing,
which is conducted in the county of San
Francisco," said Mr, Shannon. "I have
frequently seen jockeys spur and slash the
animals on which they were mounted until
the horse's flanks were painted red with
the blood that oozed from torn flesh. Does
Mr. Holbrook consider tbi3 humane sport?
Of course there are horses that must re
ceive punishment to compel them to ex
ert themselves in the final struggle to get
under the wire a winner, but everything
pertaining to horse-racing is seemingly
overlooked by the president of the Society
for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and
wnv?
"^iow, then, so far as coursing is con
cerned, Mr. Holbrook makes a grievous
mistake when he says tiiat he had seen
greyhounds tear hares to pieces while the
latter were in a dying state.
"Any person conversant with coursing
or shooting knows only too well that when
a greyhound catches a hare, death is in
stantaneous. Quite frequently greyhounds
will retrieve their game, and when two
hounds dispute their right to the prize,
the dead hare is mutilated to a certain
extent until one of the contesting dogs
becomes the possessor of the animal they
pursued and killed.
"Does Mr. Holbrook contend that cours
ing is a more brutal sport â so termed by
him â than duck or quail shooting?
Thousands of game birds are maimed
every year by sportsmen and die in agony
from the wounds inflicted. The fact of
the matter is that coursing is as humane a
sport as many other pastimes that are
indulged in by thousands of people, and I
say that when Mr. Holbrook singles out
coursing from among the many other
sports as an objective point for attack he
is certainly exceeding his duty and the
aims for which the society was originally
intended."
J. 11. Rossetter, the treasurer of the In
terstate Coursing Club, voiced the opinions
a3 expressed by Mr. Shannon. He thought
that Mr. Holbrook was carrying the thing
too far and that there were other and
broader tields wherein he could exercise
his duty with greater credit to himself
and better advantage to the society of
which he is the presiding officer.
"In Fresno rabbit drives, so called, are
held once or twice a year," said Mr. Ros
scter, "and during those drive 3 the rab
bits are driven into a corral and slaugh
tered by means of clubs, stones and other
implements of torture. Thousands of
these rabbits, which are considered pests
to the farmer, lie dying on the ground
after the clubbing, but Mr. Holbrook made
no reference in ihe interview which was
published in The Call to ihe 'slaughter of
the innocents,' as reported by the special
correspondents of the morning papers.
"Coursing hÂ»* the inclosed park is not
cruel sport. Tne hares are fed while in
coniinement, and when coursed in the
open field they run for the escapes, which
are at either end of the part/ and if the
little sbort-taila are smart enough to reacn
those escapes before they are caught the
hounds are balked and cannot continue the
course any longer.
"No, I do not consider coursing a cruel
sport by any means, and there is not a
member of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals who will go further
to punish a man who indulges in brutality
to dumb animals than J. H. Rossetter."
John Grace, the well-known judge of
coursing, was indignant at the thought of
any sane man calling coursing brutal.
"It is very strange," said Mr. Grace,
"that there are so many brutal sportsmen
in England amonÂ» the nobility who wit
ness and support the great Waterloo oup
nieeting, which is one of the leading sport
ing events of the year in England.
"I would wager a very snusr sum that if
Mr. Holbrook attended the Waterloo cup
meeting and attempted to stop the sport,
he would be accorded a reception which
would not assist to further his appe
tite for a pood dinner on his return from
the coursing sward. 1 also venture a pre
diction that if Mr. HolbrooK attempts to
interfere with the sport of the leash in
this county he cannot find a jury, even
among his own deputies, that will return
a verdict against the continuation of the
sport. If Mr. Holbrook had any experi
ence in farming in Fresno and Merced
counties he would quickly change his
mind as regards this so-called brutal sport.'
J. P. Dickson, W. C. Payton of Santa
Cruz and other prominent sportsmen in
terested in coursing spoke very strongly
against Mr. Holbrook's intention of put
ting a stop to the sport.
A. .Lorsbach, a member of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
when asked for his opinion of coursing,
said that he had witnessed meetings and
did not see any more brutality in the kill
ing of hares by greyhounds than there
exists in shooting wild ducks and quail.
"There is an element of brutality in all
sports of the field and stream," said Mr.
Lorsbach, "but I think if coursing must
be stopped many other sports such as
shooting and fishing should be stopped
also. I think an angler manifests a degree
of brutality when he takes a rish from the
hook and throws it into his basket, where
it kicks and flounders in paiu until it
expires.
"The same may be said of shooting. I
witnessed a football match in this City
among college students once, and 1 must
say that brutality was manifest in many
ways. I saw some of the contestants car
ried off the Held suffering from severe cuts.
I consider that sport of this nature should
be modi tied. As I said before, in my opinion
if coarstag is brutal so are many other pas
times which are patronized by thousands
of American sportsmen."
John Sammi, who recently resigned
from the society, said that, he could not
understand Mr. Holbrook's idea of put
ting a stop to coursing.
"It has been a popular sport for years in
this country," said Mr. Sammi, "and how
Mr. Holbrook discovered at this late hour
that it is brutal and cruel is a conundrum
which 1 am powerless to solve. I think
that tne president of the society must
have been misinformed as regards the
brutality of coursing. I certainly cannot
see any harm in the sport, but then of
course I am not aHoibrook.
George Mitchell, a prominent member
of the society, refused to be interviewed
on the subject. He said that he had never
witnessed a coursing match nor a horse
race, and therefore could not give an
opinion for cr against the sport. He said
that when a boy he went hunting occa
sionally and killed rabbits, but be always
felt sorry for the little animals. Pos
sibly tne Interstate Coursing Club will
extend Mr. Mitchell an invitation to wit
ness the next meeting, when he will be

Mr. Hughes said that Mr. Holbrook sent
a deputy to the racetrack a few days
ago with instructions to stop a bluerock
shoot that was being held under the
auspices of the Olympic Club. Mr. Hol
brook was informed that the bluerocks
were being held in painful captivity and
suffered great injnry at the hands of the
shooters. Needless to remark that the
deputy felt sheepish when he retired from
the shooting grounds.
FAVOR THE CHARTER.
Cyclist* and Calliopeans Will Work
Havd for the New City
Instrument.
Much interest in the new oharter is
being manifested in club and business
circles. The Calliopean Club, which num
bers among its members many cf the
leading young gentlemen of the City, in
tends to inaugurate a discussion upon the
proposed instrument, with a view to advo
cating its adoption. In order that, the I
members might be made more conversant
with the special features of the document,
.8. F. Water, one of the leading spirits of
the club, lias procured copies of the neat
little brochure "A Synopsis of the New
Charter," issued by the Merchants' Ass
ociation, a copy of which is to be sent to I
each member of the club.
Another organization as deeply inter
ested in tne matter is the new Cycle Board
of Trade, which held its inaugural session
last Wednesday night in the Cyclorama
building. The board is paying particular
attention to those portions of the instru
ment which deal with the matter of streets,
roads and boulevards and their improve
ment and extension. J. S. Con well, a
member of the board's executive com
mittee, called at the rooms of the Mer
chants' Association yesterday and took
away a large number of copies of the
"Synopsis," and also of another pamphlet
containing the constitution of the associa
tion, with a brief historical outline ol its
work. Mr. Conwell expresses the convic
tion that the adoption of the new charter
will be of great advantage to wheelmen,
and he will see to th* distribution of
the pamphlets among the members of the
board and of the various cycling clubs. In
his opinion, as soon as the matter is well
ventilated and understood all the wheel
men of the City will be found to be farm
supporters of the new charter.

Objections of Property-Own

COVERS BIG INTERESTS.
The Fight for the Old County
Road to Be Made in
Earnest.
AGAINST A GRADE CROSSING
Demand That the Narrow-Gauge Track
Be Lowered If the New Plan
Is Adopted.
The Webster-street bridge problem is
the matter of first importance in Alameda
public affairs just now. It has eclipsed the
public library building project. The de-

and for a scavenger's crematory has
been deferred. At the western end of the
Encinal people have temporarily forgotten
about e-en the big bicycle parade that is
to be the attraction next month.
It is believed that the old question of
the county and railroad bridges will be
deAnilplj settled this spring, and In the
s-ettlement of it the city of Alameda will
lie more concerned than any other mu
nicipality.
As stated in The Call yesterday morn
ing the West End residents of Alameda
are opposed to the change of the Oakland
a:id Alameda highway from Weoster
street to McPherson and Alice streets,
and they are preparing to make a strong
fight against the change.
None of the people interested in main
taining the Webster-street way claim that
the present public bridge is suitable for
the traffic over that route, but they assert
that when the new railroad bridge at
Alice street is built, the county bridge
will satisfactorily accommodate all the
wagons that may run between the two
cities. Half of the roadway on the bridge
is at present occupied by the Oakland and
Alameda Electric Kail way tracks, but it
is suggested that with the narrow-gauge
road removed to the Alice-street bridge,
the electric tracks can be placed on the
outer portion of the bridge that is now
used by the Southern Pacific Company.
Another suggestion to be offered to the
authorities is that the part of the bridge
now occupied by the narrow-gauge line
can be utilized for the general public
Narrow-Gauge and Electric Railroad Crossing at the Oakland Approach to the Webster-Street Bridge.
[From a photograph taken for "The Call."]
travel, and that then the bridge will be
practically twice as commodious as it is at
present, aiui that will be plenty of room
for the teams and the electric-cars.
That the Narrow-gauge road will be
â¢hanged so as to run by way of the new
Alice-street bridge, as the plan was
outlined in the railroad prop
osition to the Government engi
neers, is not. tioub'ed by tbe property
owners along the route in Alameda as tbe
advantages to the company are apparent,
and it is in accordance with tliat expecta
tion that the light for the perpetuation of
Webster street is being made.
To carry the railroad bridge plan into
effect it will be necessary for the Southern
Pacific Company to run tbe narrow-gauge
track* acros* Webster street, and it is ar
Â«ued with the trains running at the rate
â¢â * SLeeU customary on viaat line a grade
crossing would be exceedingly dangerous.
Consequently the people of West Alameda
propose to demand that in the contem
plated change the plans should be made
so as to lower the railroad and run it
under Webster street instead of across it at
grade.
The principal opposition to the main
tenance of the Webster-street bridge, while
the Alice-street bridge is also in use, is
expected to come from the shipping men,
who have long clamored against having
the harbor locked up with the two draw
bridges.
Captain yon Schmidt and other Ala
meda citizens who ace specially interested
in the matter declare that the removal of
the Webster-street bridge would be a very
great improvement to the harbor. The
two bridges are so close together that it is
not an easy matter to get through them
with Jarge craft, and, on account of the
heavy traffic, it is difficult to get the two
drawbridges open so as to permit a vessel
to go right through.
The yachtsmen favor the change from
two bridges to one, and the California
Club would derive :t special benefit from the
opening of the estuary where the Webster
street brigde now is. The clubhouse is right
near the bridge, and yachts are sometimes
anchored so close to the structure that a
railroad-car tumbling from the bridge
would fall on them.
Alameda people who own real estate in
the McPherson-street district are eager to
have the railroad plans carried out, as a
new development of their region would
result.

THE SATS FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1596.
ANOTHER FIRE
AT LIVERMORE.
A Hotel, a Livery Stable
and a Tailor-Shop
Destroyed.
EXPLOSION OF GASOLINE
Two Citizens Were Badly In
jured While Fighting the
Flames.
FANNED BY A HIGH WIND.
The Necessity for an Adequate De
partment Again Very Plainly
Demonstrated.
LI VERMORE, Cal., April 3.â Fire broke
out this afternoon in a small tailor-shop
between the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Day's
livery stable. Owing to the high wind all
three buildings were burned to the ground.
The accident that started the tire oc
curred about 3 o'clock. A gasoline stove
in the tailor-shop of D. Rottanzi exploded
and at once the room was a mass of flames.
Mr- Clark was about the first man to
rush to the scene and he gallantly
attempted to extinguish the flames and in
doing so seriously burned his right arm.
After the alarm had been given the citi
zens flocked to the fire, and the volunteer
brigade was called out and did good work,
but it required only a glance to see that
the shop was doomed and that their efforts
must be directed toward saving the hotel.
The volunteer firemen worked hard, but
their appliances were unable to cope with
a big fire and the flames made rapid
headway.
The Cosmopolitan Hotel soon caught
fire, and about half an hour later it was
burned to the ground. There was a stiff
breeze blowing and the hard work of the
firemen seemed to be almost useless.
While directing affairs Mr. Beazel was
struck by a falling window on the side of
the neck and badly cut. Several others
met with slight injuries.
Day's livery stable also caught lire, and
as its contents was of a very inflama
ble nature it blazed up merrily for a
few minutes, but soon was leveled to the
ground. The fire was confined to these
buildings and no damage was done on
either side of them. The fire is the big
gest at Livermore for some time, and
: demonstrated the need of a thoroughly
i equipped tire department. There were
plenty of willing volunteers, but such can
not fight fire with their bands.
Livermore is a big enough town to
maintain a lirst-class steam engine. A few
months ago a handsome residence be
longing to Mr. Anspacher was destroyed
by fire, and more recently a warehouse
was lost through the same cause.
The damage at to-day's fire will prob
ably be covered with f 7500.

PROUD OF THEIR CITY.
The Merchants' Exchange Anxious to
Advertise It Freely.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3.â The munici
pal official party from Minneapolis and
other cities which is now on a tour of the
coast have been sent the following invita
tion to visit this city:
Oakland, Cal., April 3, 1896.
Hon. Robert Pratt, Los Angeles, Cal.â Sir: By

STUDENTS AT WOEK,
Another Day Spent in Improving Cali
fornia College Grounds,
Oakland Office Han Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 3. )
The grounds of the California College at
Highland Park are much prettier to-night
than they were yesterday. The students
made to-day a labor day, and with picks
j and shovels followed the example of their
I bretnren of the University of California.
The grounds at California College have
been greatly neglected for several years,
and the rosebushes and the weeds have
grown in careless harmony, while grass
has trespassed along the walks and the
travel of many feet and carriages has de
stroyed the comfort of a drive on the road
way. Some portion of the grounds has
never received any attention, and this sec
tion was also visited by the students.
They worked hard all day and made great
progress, but there is much yet to be done.
It is calculated that about rive more days
will be required to put everything "in
proper shape. About a month ago the
students devoted a day to the work, but
they are desirous of having it all com
pleted by the summer vacation.
NO LOVE FOR HEIRS.
Unnaturnl Treatment of a Y/mng
Mother by Her Husband.
OAKLAND, Cal,, April 3.â Mrs. Solo
mon Baumgard was found yesterday
morning in a very precarious condition.
It is said that her husband, who is many
years her senior, regarded with disfavor
the prospect of an heir, and that he mal
treated his wife. He had left her the
night before, and when the child was born
there was no one to care for the infant or
mother.
When neighbors found the woman, a
physician was sent for, and Dr. J. J.
Pledros responded. Mrs. Baumgard may
die.
T. M. C. A. Cycle Show.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3.â The bicycle
show, which opened this afternoon at 2
o'clock in the Young Men's Christian As
sociation building, is proving a drawing
card. All the afternoon there was a
throng present, while to-night the capacity
of the building is tested. An orchestra
furnishes music while refreshments are
served by the ladies. Eighteen firms are
exhibiting thirty-one makes of wheels.
The duplex and tandems have throngs
about them all the time.
The exhibition is one of the most inter
esting and instructive given for a long
time. It is open to the public free of
charge and the exhibitors had to pay no
fee, the object being to draw the attention
of the public to the association and to
arouse greater interest among members to
the wheeling club. The display will con
tinue to-morrow from 2 to 10 p. m., with a
a programme in the evening at 8 :30.
This includes half-mile bicycle races be
tween crack riders of the association on
the "Home Trainer." The wheel is set on
rollers in a frame and the rider goes
through every motion of road ridine, even
to keeping hfs balance, but never advances
an inch. It is much like a treadmill.
There are indicators so arranged as to give
accurate measure of distances traveled.
Wanted to See Depew.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3. â Charles
Deming, the religious enthusiast who is bo
well known as a believer in the early sec
ond coming of Christ, went to San Fran
ciscoo last night and attempted to make
an effort to see Mr. Depew and Vander
bilt, but was refused admission by the
clerk of the Palace Hotel, where the gen
tlemen are registered.
Dtming explains to-day that his pur
pose was to enlist the gentlemen in behalf
of General Howard, his own choice candi
date, for the presidency. He says How
ard is a Christian, and it behooves this
country to have that kind of a man in the
Presidential chair when the mileunium
comes.
Deming insists he will interview tlu
men when they visit Oakland in response
to the request of President Keller of the
Board of Trade.
War Decorations for the Cemetery.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 3.â A letter re
ceived by A. D. Smith of th- Mountain
View Cemetery from Senator George C.
Perkins lmorras Mr. Smith that a resolu
tion has been passed by the Senate grant

was now in the hands of the Naval Com
mittee of the House, of which Represen

has written to Mr. Hilborn asking him to
urge its passage at this session.
Who Shot Cassis?
OAKLAND, Cal.. April 3. â Harold
Scrimgeor, George Palmer, Walter Rogers
and Charles Lloyd were arrested to-day on
complaint of Mrs. C. M. Lambert and
pleaded not guilty of disturbing her peace.

good in tne future.

Oakland Office San Francisco Gall,)
908 Broadway, April 3. $
The women suffragists of this city have
always been active in forwarding their
particular line of work, but not until the
past two weeks has anything been at
tempted in the way of organizing ward
clubs. Since the visit at the tabernacle of
the Eastern suffragists the Alameda
County Political Equality Society has
taken on a new lease of life, and at the
parlor meetings now being held ward clubs
are being organized.
At the meeting at Mrs. Archibald Bur
bank's house a club was organized for
work in the Second Ward and a large num
ber signed the roll. Mrs. A. Burba nk was
elected president, Mrs. A. West secretary
and Mrs. E. yon Adelung treasurer.
A parlor meeting was hsld at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. F. C. Havens and as a
result the Vernon Heights Political Equal
ity Club is in existence, with the following
officers: Mrs. F. C. Havens, president;
Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin, vice-president ; Miss
Mary Keene, recording secretary; Mrs. J.
L. Howard, treasurer; Percy B. Preble,
auditor.
The following telegram was received from
Mrs. Clara Foltz:
San Francisco, March 31, 1896.
Mrs. Harper, care Mrs. Havens, Vernon Height*,
Oakland, Cal.: Just received delayed invitation
to help the good cause. Sorry* engagements
prevent. Accept best wishes. Clara Foltz. -
Yesterday afternoon a parlor meeting
was held at the residence of Mrs. Henry
Vrooman on Oak street. About eighty
ladies were in attendance, and Miss An
thony greatly admired the spirit of en
thusiasm shown.
Before the meeting adjourned there was
organized the Fifth Wa.'d Political Equal
ity Club, with the following officers:
President, Miss Mary E. Snell; secretary,
MiÂ«s Mabel E. Craft; treasurer, Miss Mary
L. Morgan. The next meeting of the club
MANAGER EDITH BROWNSILL, CAPTAIN ELIZABETH GRISWOLD,
U. C. Bask*t-BaU Team. U. C. Basket-Bali Team.
will be held Wednesday, April 8, at 3
o'clock at 1213 Madison street.
Last evening a meeting was held at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. D. W. C. Gaskill.
Miss Antnony and Miss Yates were intro
duced to tbe company by Fred S. Streator,
who announced that he had been con
verted to the suffrage cause by Miss Shaw.
Mrs. L. S. Burchard was elected a vice
president of the Fifth Ward Club.
The parlor meetings announced by Miss
Anthony and Mi3s Yates for the discus
sion of the suffrage campaign are at an
end for the present in this county, although
the ward clubs will continue to work. Ex
cepting Miss Anthony, who will remain in
San Francisco to organize and direct the
ampaign, nearly the whole force of East
rn speakers will now be transported to
f onthern California, where the campaign
r reported to be in rather a bad way. The
apers there are not favorable to suffrage,
Pnd the ladies have decided to hurl their
in that neighborhood for a
lew weeks.

Were Bunkoed With Gold
Bricks.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 3.â The long
drawn-out preliminary examination of the
"go.d brick" swindlers was enlivened to
day by the appearance on the witness
stand of Stephen G. Little, the Dixon
banker who was bunkoed out of $7500 by
these swindlers about a year ago. He
readily identified Root, alias Raymond,
to whom he had been introduced by Big
Foot Gordan.
The effort of the prosecution to secure
from the witness what was said between
him and Root in the presence of Gordan
was strongly fought by Mr. Nusbaumer
for the defense. Attorney Church claimed
it showed a conspiracy between Root and
Big Foot, and he expected to show that
the defendants bad been engaged in a like
transaction with Mr. Little, as had been
carried out in the case of Hofstra. ile
quoted many authorities in support of his
contention.
Mr. Nusbaumer claimed no conspiracy
had been shown, and said that he had a
right to assume that if Gordan was bad
enough to swindle Mr. Hofstra out of
$10,000 he was bad enough to change the
borings from the brick and submit to
Root genuine gold. He claimed further
that there was nothing to show that Root
was not a competent assayer, and that had
Shreve & Co. s assayer reported the test
satisfactory the court would have no right
to hold him for the offense.
"Big Foot" Gordan objected to being
sent to the County Jail in the patrol-wagon

This afternoon Judge Wood allowed
Banker Little to testify, subject to being
ruled out, after much time had been con
sumed in argument. Witness then told of

looking for Charles Little, but said the
witness would do. He then showed sam

BASKET - BALL MAIDS.
Berkeley and Stanford Teams
Prepared to Tussle
To-Day.
Some Nervousness, However, Mani
fest, Which Is Construed as a
Good Signâ The Make-Up.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 3.â The Co-ed
basket-ball team at the University of Cali
iornia are ready for their struggle with
the Stanford learn to-morrow afternoon.
Their last practice game before entering
the intercollegiate game was held this
morning. Most of the time was given up
to signal work and to discussing the
fancy plays they will spring on the Stan
ford girls. What they lack in physical
strength and skill they will endeavor to
make up in strategy. They fully realize
the exceedineiy great responsibility which
is upon them and what it would mean to
come out of the arena a defeated band.
On the contrary, they fully appreciate
what it would mean to them as individuals
and as a representative body of the State
University to make their exit under flying
rather than under drooping colors.
'This is to be the first intercollegiate
game of the kind ever held on the Pacific
Coast," said the fairest maiden of the team
to-day, "and we can by no means afford to
lose it, though we will admit that we will
enter the game contending against fearful
odds. The Stanford team has been play
ing the pame much longer than we have
and consequently are in better form. They
have doubtless been looking forward to
this contest for a year or more and no
doubt knew what they were doing when
they challenged us. That they were think
ing of challenging us some time or other
was known in Berkeley six months ago.
That doesn't mnke any difference either
way iust now. What is foremost in our
minds is to win the day, and we will enter
Armory Hall with that single purpose in
mind. We are as much interested in the
outcome of our game as any of the boys
are in the result of the annual football
contest or the other yearly intercollegiate
meets. The athletic conduct of thVeame
and its outcome then are of the greatest
concern to us.
Taking the team as a whole they may
be said, in athletic parlance, to be in the
pink of condition, though two or throe of
the players seem slightly overtrained,
judging from their worn expressions and
meditative mood. To say that they are
filled with excitement and fear would be
putting it liphtly. They are affected with
that extreme nervousness which often
overcome* veteran athletes on the eve of a
great battle. All they can talk about is
the "basket-ball game" and what they
will do if they win it. They only wish
that the diamond-studded trophy which
Duke Oldenburg is said to have offered to
the winner would materialize. Tne single
topic of discussion among the co-eds as
they went about through the corridors of
Morth Hall was the basket-ball game. In
roost cases the first, thing that was said
when two co-sds met was, ''Are you going
to the game to-morrow ?"
Among the men all was silence, save an
occasional reference to the contest in a
cursory manner. To them there appears
to be little of interest in the contest, which
fnct seems to be due to the wording of
the announcement placards, which say,
"Women exclusively admitted."
The new costumes of the team have ar
rived. They consist of white sweaters
with a blue '-TT" and a gold "C" interlaced
upon them, blue bloomers with trimmings
of gold braid. Their tennis shoes will be
laced with golden cords.

ceeds of the game which fall to them to

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., April
3. â The basket-ball team has finished iis
practice and is ready for the call to "play."
Captain McCray suys that her girls are in
tine share for a game and will go over
their plays this afternoon with which they
plan to disconcert their Berkeley 9isters.
''We don't feel overconfident," said Miss
McCray, "but in some ways I believe we
have tfie advantage. Most of my team is
composed of light active girls, who play a
fast game without tiring, and I under
stand that some of the Berkeley players
are quite large. There is of course some
advantage in having large players or tall
ones. Especially is this true of those who
try to throw the" ball into the basket, but
the main thins is activity and endurance."
The basket-ball players can't see how
any one could become angry in the eanie,
as was reported of the recent game in Bos
ton. Said one of the girls: "There has
never been the slightest feeling or show of
passion in any game we have ever played
on either side, and there is no occasion for
it. In that respect it gives rise to less irri
tation than even the mild gamcof tennis."
Dr. Ward, who has supervised the work
of the basket-bailers, is a hearty advocate
of the game. He says that outdoor exer
cise is juatas necessary to the health of
women as it is of men, and thaf the game
of basket-ball, which is exhilarating as
well as fascinating, serves the same pur-
Eose for young women as football, hand
all, etc., do for young men. Miss Mosher,
the gymnasium instructor of the women
of the university, is of like opinion and
heartily believes in an intercollegiate con
test of this kind on the ground that it
tends to keep up an interest in the exer
cise among tlie young women.
(|The general opinion is that as long as
it is conducted according to prescribed
rules before an audience entirely of ladies
the game should be popular and suc
cessful.
The Stanford girls in addition to their
regular practice game for the past few
days have religiously observed training
as to diet, and in every way have fol
lowed the course of training â though to
a much less rigid degree â mapped out by
their brother athletes. The athletic com
mittee some time ago refused to grant the
members of the team the right to wear
Varsity sweaters on the ground that the
team was not truly a university athletic
organization. Most of the members do
not greatly care, but nevertheless feel that
their rights were treated with scant jus
tice.
Several alleged make-ups of the team
have been printed, but until this afternoon
Captain McCray had not picked her play
ers. They will'be as follows:
Guardsâ Right, Agnes Morley, '97; center,
Jessie Ryan, '97; left, Lena Ducker, '97.
Centersâ Right, Anita Coebert. '96; center,
Stella McCrar, captain, '98; left, Frances
Tucker, '98.
Homeâ Right, Mattie Clark, '99; center,
Esther Keifer, '99; left, Mayme Merritt, '99.
THE CITATION DISMISSED.
Alameda's Trustees Declared Not
Guilty of Contempt of
Court.
Judge Frick Decides That There Were
Irregulai ities in the Injunc
tion Order.
ALAMEDA,CaI., April 3.â The citation
against the City Trustees for contempt of
court in the electric light litigation, was
dismissed this morning by Judge Frick,
and the defendants will not be punished
for contempt. City Attorney Taylor, for
the defendants, moved, when the case was
called, that the contempt proceedings be
quashed, giving as a ground for such
action the defective verification of one of
the pleadin s filed by the plaintiff. He
first attacked the jurisdiction of the court
in the matter, contending that the law
prescribes that where a citation is issued
the respondents should have five days after
service of the writ. In this case the writ
was issued only yesterday. Judge Frick
denied the motion, and then heard tho
other motion to dismiss. The injunction
was issued upon the amended and supple
mental complaint and an affidavit referring
to it. It arpeared that the verification of
the amended and supplemental complaint
was defective in that the venue was laid
in the county of Alameda and was sworn
to in the City and County of San Francisco.
The Judge held that this being a quasi
criminal proceeding, tue record must
affirmatively show on its face that every
thing is regular. Taking this view of it
he dismissed the contempt proceedings,
but continued the motion to dissolve the
injunction for further hearing on Monday
next.
The Company O Distension.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 3.â The only
matter discussed at the meeting of Com
pany G last evening was the article ap
pearing in an Oakland publication de
nouncing Captain Chipman, casting reflec
tions upon hia competency as a coni
m ander and including the statement that
a petition signed by a greater portion of
the sixty-six members asking that he re
sign his commission. The publication was
read by Recording Secretary St. Sure for
the information of the members present.
Captain Chipman expressed the opinion
that the majority of the members are with
him and he felt confident that he would
be supported. A motion was made in
structing the secretary to inform the presi
that there it no dissatisfaction and dissen
sion in the ranks and it was carried.
More developments are exDected in the
matter, however. The opposition is quietly
working to bring about a change of com
mander, and it will be heard of again.
Captain Chipman's term does not expire
until 1897, and it is said by those who are
his champions that he cannot be disposed
of until tue expiration of that time.
A space has been cleared near Sochi,
Russia, for the erection of a palace for the
Czar. The site is most picturesque and
the edifice will face the waters of tne Black
Sea. Its construction will be begun in the
spring.

GemÂ« Out of Fashion.
Here is a drawer full of coral jewelry. I
cannot sell it at any price. Here is a coral
set I paid 2200 francs for. You can have it
for $10. Why? Outof fashion, and noone
can ttllwhetner it will again become the
mode for half a centu-y. Here is a cat's
eyeâ they are all a species of garnetâ that
cost me SOU francs; it has no price at all
upon it now. A few years ago "melee"
diamonds formed in settings were the
rape. "What do I mean by "melee? 1 ' They
are the small brilliants, ranging from a
quarter down to a sixty-fourth of a carat.
Here is a "melee" brooch for which three
years ago I asked $720; I can duplicate it
now for $225. But three years ago "melee"
diamonds sold for $600 and $700 a carat
now they have very iiitle value.âlnter

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
ATTORNEY NAGLE'S FISTS
They Land on George D. Shad
burne's Frontispiece and
Draw Color.
DR. BHOWH'S LAWYER ACCUSED
The Warrant for Arrest Followed
by Different Stories of
the Cause.
A warrant for the arrest of Charles G.
Nagle, the Rev. C. O. Brown's attorney in
the late ecclesiastical trial, on a charge of
assault, was sworn out yesterday morning.
It was the result of a tame pugilistic en
counter which occurred in the stairway of
632 Market street the night before, between
Mr. Nagle and George D. Shadburne Jr.
Mr. Shad burn "had his claret tapped,"
to quote the phraseology of Attorney Na
cle, and the former would have invoked
the law fifteen hours before had he been
able to find a judge willing to issue a war
rant out of business hours.
Attorney Nagle has a lease on nearly all
of the second floor of the building at 632
Market street, and sublets that portion
not occupied by himself. Shadburne, he
says, rented an office from the owner of
the building for the purpose of conducting
a rival business to chat of one of his own
tenants and take advantage of the latters
advertising.
However that may be, Mr. Nagle met
Mr. Shadburne on the stairway Thursday
afternoon and asked him for %5 50 which
he claimed the laUer owed him. There
was a difference of opinion and Attorney
Nagle landed lightly on Mr. Shadburne r s
most prominent facial feature. Blood
flowed und Shadburne fled. He gained the
interior of his office without further mis
hap, and soon reappeared with a revolver
in his hand.
Mr. Nagle had disappeared within the
portals of his own apartments, and the
silence was not disturbed by the bark of
Mr. Shadburne's shooting-iron. After
wiping away all traces of the carmine
overflow Mr. Shadburne rushed out to the
City Hall to swear out a warrant for his
assailant's arrest. He was too late and
had to nurse his wrath until court hour
yesterday morning.
Mr. Shadburne says Attorney Nagle as
saulted him because he has started a rival
business on the same floor with one of the
latters tenants.
f Parson Brown's attorney asserts that
Stiadburne owes him $5 50, and when asked
to pay made an insulting reply.
Lemons are considered healthful because
the acid they contain acts as a diuretic,
having power to excite ti:e secretions, and
thus regulating the system. They must,
of course, be used in moderation, or they
will pall on the appetite and cease to have
any medicinal effect.

The party estimates its strength to be
the same as when it polled 10,000 votes for
General John B dwell for resident in 1892,
and when it cast 10,000 for Henry French
for Governor in 1894.
it is predicted -that there will be a right
at Ihe convention on the monetary issue.
Ex-Governor St. John has some ardent
follower- in the prohibition; ranks in Cali
fornia, and these recent unofficial utter
ances of his are likely to prove a bone of
contention:
In reply to your letter of recent date, I have i
the honor to Mate that, in ray judgment," free
and unlimited coinage of gold* and silver, at a !
ratio oi 10 to 1. will be the dominant issue in j
the campaign of 1890.. In using the word I
"dominant," I do not intend thereby to even I
intimate that it will necessarily be the most
important issue, for it is not the importance of
.an issue that makes it dominant, but rather ]
â¢ the numbers who rally to its support.
The present outlook indicates that the ques- I
tion of free coinage will attract the attention i
of more voters than any other one, or in fact I !
may say. more than any half-dozen issues be- I
fore the people. Our present financial system, !
Which the Shermans and Cievelands have tried |
to make us believe is the "best the world has
ever known," proves at last to be the most
gigantic and infamous scheme to plunder the
people that ever cursed this or any other coun
m* on earth. It has multiplied millionaires,
tilled the land with tramps, plastered the
homes of the people with mortgages and
robbed them of the ability to pay their debts â 
The way out? Well, there is but one way
out, and that is for voters who love humanity,
better than party to get together, mid do it
right away, too. Upon what basis should' a
union of reformers be brought about ? I would
suggest the following:
1. Free and unlimited coinage of both gold
and silver, at a ratio of 1(> to 1, without asking
the advice or consent of any other nation on
earth.
_'. Ail money, to be issued directly by the
General Government, and no one doifar to be
any netter, before the law. than any other dol
lar so issued, and all to be a full legal tender
lor all purposes within our own country.
3. AH bonds and other obligations payable

treasury for gold: let all obligations of the
Government be, for awhile at least, redeemed
In silver dollars.
There are some younger members of the
party who. are far from pronouncing this
an ' 'iridescent dream." They favor mak
ing prohibition a prominent but not nec
essarily dominant measure and have no
objection to affiliation with the Populists.
But the bulk of the party is made up of
the conservative element, hence it is likely
that there will be no tangible results of
the wordy war at the convention.
"There arejthose in the party who would
choose a Prohibition party without prohi
bition rather than prohibition without
a Prohibition party," said one of
the disgruntled members yesterday.
"We have said, in effect, to the
fossils many a time: 'Dad, don't block
the road. Get out on one side and yell,
but aon't get in the way.' It does no good.
They haven't learned that prayer and poli
tics don't mix, and persist "in Sunday
school platforms. When a party requires
more from its adherents than a church
does, who can expect it to grow ?"
The voting strength in this City is 500,
and the county tickets must be accom
panied by a petition in accordance with
the law relating to a voting contingent
representing not less than 3 per cent of
the total number of voters.
STRICKEN BY PARALYSIS
Illness of Thomas U. Sweeny,
Donor of the Park
Observatory.
HOPES FOR HIS RECOVERY.
Began Life as a Poor Boy, but Ac
cumulated Wealthâ His Phil
anthropy.
Thomas U. Sweeny, the well-known cap
italist, pioneer and philanthropist, is suf
fering from a severe stroke of paralysis.
To the generosity of .Mr. Sweeny the
people of San Francisco are indebted for
Thomas U. Sweeny, the Donor of the Observatory on Strawberry Hill in Golden
Gate Park, Who Now Lies Stricken With Paralysis.
the elegant observatory which crowns the
summit, of Strawberry Hill in the park.
Thismagnammous offer was made by the
donor to the Park Commissioners for the
benefit of the people of this City about
five years ago. At that time Strawbesry
Hill attracted very few visitors â almost
none#U all on foot.
Mr. Sweeny at first erected one story,
which was found to be such! a convenience
and gave such general satisfaction that he
determined to add another story and en
circle the interior with a balcony, from
which a more commanding view could be
had of the landscape. The view overlooks
Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco Bay and
the islands therein, Mount Diablo, Mount
Tamalpais and the Faralion Islands, far
out m the ocean.
The construction of the first story cost
$15,000; to add the second story involved
an additional $10,000. But this is not all.
Mr. Sweeny has made provisions out of
his princely estate to finish the observa
tory by adding still another story, then to
cover the whole with a glass roof. The
expense of this additional work has been
estimated ami provisions made for carrying
into effect the donor's plans.
It has been Mr. Sweeny's ambition to
give to the people of San Francisco for the
generations to come a place of which he
once said, "From which to see all the pic
tures painted by nature."
Thomas U. .Sweeny was born in New
York, and started from New York City
December, 1851, on a sailing vessel loaded
with powder and other merchandise for
Chagres. The party went up the Chagres
River in arowboat to Gorgona, and -walked
across the isthmus, about twenty miles, to
Panama. He sailed from Panama on the
steamer Monumental City, and arrived in
San Francisco March 4, i 5.32, after a pas
sage of forty-nine days from Panama to
San Francisco.
He stayed in San Francisco two days and
then went to Sacramento. Later on he
went to Diamond Springs, in the gold
mines, with $1 f>o in his pocket. Shortly
alter his arrival at Vie mines his fortunes
began to mend. To-day he is one of the
richest men in the City and the owner of
a great deal of valuable property south of
the park.
The present is the second stroke of par
alysis which h:iu prostrated Mr. Sweeny.
But his attending physician, Dr. Botts
ford, has every hope that in the course of
a few days his patient will be up and about
his usual business, as it is thought none
of the vital organs have been affected.
In Honor qf the Now Bridge.
The property-owners and residents of Fair
mount and adjoining districts are to hold a
meeting m honor of the opening of the
Charles-street bridge to public use. The
bridge spans the Southern I'urific Railroad
I rack at Charles and French streets, and forms
* connecting link between Mission street and
the Fairmount district. The Fairmount Im
provement Club will hold a meeting at John
son's Hall on Chenery street, near Charles,
at 8 p. M. to-day, and immediately ad
journ to the bridge. The Board of Supervisors
are expected to attend.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 4, 1896.
BELL'S MONEY
SPIRITED AWAY
Two Prominent Clairvoy
ants Charged With
Stealing It.
ROMANCE IN THE MAILS
Carson City's Postmaster the
Heir to Sixty-Five Scotch
Millions.
â __^_
SO SAID THE TRANCE MEDIUM.
Professor Eugene and Van de Vere
Behind the Bars for Swindling
a Weak-Minded Man.
Professor Eugene and Professor Van de
Vere, the two most noted clairvoyants in
the City, were placed behind the bars of
the City Prison last night by order of
Captain Lees on a charge of swindling
George H. Bell, ex-Postmaster of Carson
City, out of $1100, the charge being a felony.
The story of Bell's begnilement and ruin
is as interesting as a gold-brick episode.
After Professor Van de Vere's arrest it was
found that the spirits, by not warning him
of what was coming, had "thrown him
down," to use a colloquialism, and are
responsible for the additional charge of
carrying a concealed deadly weapon. If
they had only given him the tip he would
have left his gun at home, and would have
been spared the additional expense of the
fine.
The details of the swindle were brought
to light by Herbert P. Thrall, a United
States Postoffice Inspector, who had been
sent to Carson to look into the affairs
the postom'ce there and to investigate cer
tain reports regarding the mental and
physical condition of Postmaster Bell.
He found that Bell had been drinking
heavily, that he was almost insane on the
subject of spiritualism and that he was $60
(short in his accounts. This sum was made
good by Bell's bondsmen, Otto Schutz,
John RoHser, Edmund James, L. H. Bell,
Edward Burlington and Thomas Rickey.
Bell was removed and Edmund James was
given in charge of the postoffice as acting
postmaster for the sureties.
Inspector Thrall found that Bell was
penniless, and by dint of questioning the
Inspector drew out of him the details of the
manner in which he had been induced to
give up $1100.
About six months ago Bell and Albert
Jaqua, a railway postal clerk, became con
verts to Spiritualism. They held nightly
seances in the postoffice in the midst of
mail pouchea and canceled stamps and
practiced writing by impulse of the
spirits. On one of those occasions Jaqua
sat down at a desk and in a disguised
hand wrote the following message, which,
he said, had been inspired by the spirit of
ex-Postmaster Hodman, an old friend of
Beirs:
Don't make the investment that you con
template; have something in view.
Rodman.
At that time Bell had been talking about
buying a ranch with $1500 which he had
in the Hibernia Bank, which was the
investment referred to in the message. It
created a maked effect upon the mind of
the credulous Postmaster, for Rodman on
his deathbed many years before had asked
Bell to forgive him for not leaving him
anything in his will. Kodman added, "If
there is a hereafter, I'll make it all right
with you some day before you die."
After the seance in the Carson postoffice,
Jaqna was transferred to San Francisco,
cind soon after his arrival visited Professor
Van de Vere, and was favorably impressed
with his alleged spiritual attainments.
He so wrote to Bell, and requested the
Postmaster to correspond with the pro
fessor. The r?quest of Jaqua was com
plied with, and in response to his letter
came one from Professor Van de Vere,
with this message:
They told ms for you not to make any in
vestments as yet.
In the same letter the professor inquired
of Bell as to who were "they," he not hav
ing been able to get their names from the
spirits. Bell replied that he did not know
of any familiar spirits, except Rodman and
White.
Shortly after this event the Carson Post
master came to this City and called at Van
deYere'a office. He took his seat in the
waiting-room, with .his back to the consul
tation room, he being curious to ascertain
whetner Van de Vere would know him.
While sitting in a reverie he heard,
"How are you, Brother Bell?" as Van de
Vere came in. The Postmaster was more
than delighted with this evidence of the
wonderful spiritual power of the clair
voyant.
Then Van de Vere went into a trance
and said that Rodman and White wanted
to communicate something of importance
to their old friend, but that there was an
evil spirit in the way whose ghost the
professor would lay for $125. The Post
master paid the money cheerfully, for he
considered it dirt cheap to get rid of a
spirit that persisted in standing between
him and hi 3 old friend Rodman, who was
aching spiritually to inform him as to a
splendid investment. Tlien he was intro
duced to Professor Eugene, who gave him
a sitting and informed him that there was
a second evil spirit blocking the road and
that it would cost $200 to drive him off.
Bell objected vigorously to paying that
sum ; it had cost only $125 to lay the evil
ghost that boarded at Van de Vere's, and
he thought that Professor Eugene ought to
be able to abolish his particular uncanny
sprite for $175. This sum was accepted
and the Postmaster paid it, on the 28th day
of February, four days after he had given
$125 to Van de Vere. On that same day,
the man from Carson (he was a Democrat
also) went over to Professor Van de Vere's,
where he was informed that both the ghosts
had been laid, and that there was nothing
to prevent Rodman and White speaking
through the medium.
The professor stretched himself upon a
lounge and pretended to go into a trance,
and after a few esthetic shudders, inter
spersed with groans and sighs, spoke on
behalf of Rodman, and related a story sec
ond in interest only to that which the
Abbe Faria poured into the wondering
ears of Monte Cristo. It' was to the effect
that in the year 1700 James Bell died in
Scotland possessed of an estate which, by
reason of rents, profits and interest, had
grown to the value of Â£13,000,000 sterling,
or $65,000,000. Bell left no known heirs,
and the estate was yet in chan
cery. But Rodman had discovered
through acquaintances in the spirit
land that Bell of Carso n was the direct
descendant of Bell of acotJand, and was
his lawful heir. He said further that the
proofs of heirship and title were extant in
England and Scotland. Rodman added
that it was his wish that Bell should im
plicitly follow the advice of Van de Vere.
The Postmaster listened with open
mouth, and almost fell off his chair when
he learned that $65,000,000 was his, and
almost as good as in his possession. But
there was a little matter of detail to be at
tended to. It was necessary to secure and
present the proofs, the professor saia after
he had awakened from his trance, and
fortunately he had a Jawyer friend in
Chicago named C. M. Hodson who had
attended to other estates for the professor.
It was further explained that Hodson
was to go to New fork City and
secure the services of those eminent legal
lights, Rufus Choate and William M.
Evarts, to look after the Postmaster's in
terest in the Scotch millions. Then the
lawyer was to go to Edinburgh and Lon
don and retain Sir Charles Russell to rep
resent him on the other side of the Atlan
tic. Mr. Hodson would require an ad
vance of $2000 to defray the necessary ex
penses of the trip and to pay him for his
services.
The Postmaster did not have $2000. He
had already paid $390 to lay the ghosts,
and there was $800 remaining in the Hi
bernia Bank. He had no idea where he
could raise any more.
"Don't let that trouble you, my dear fel
low," said Van de Vere. "I have $900 on
hand, which I'll lend you, and my friend,
Professor Eugene, will let you have $300.
That will make up the $2000, and you can
repay me when you get the thirteen mil
lion pounds sterling."
Professor Eugene wrote a check and
handed it to Professor Van de Vere, who
went out with it, and in a short time re
turned with a large quantity of $20 pieces.
When Bell looked at the pile of shining
gold, he saw that it was all right, and he
laid his $800, every dollar he had in the
world, beside it in the clairvoyant's grip
sack.
This was to be sent to Hodson, and the
receipt was to be returned in due course of
time. Bell remained in the City for two
or three days waiting to receive some bor
rowed money which he had written for,
and which was necessary to pay his rail
road fare, and he then returned to the Sil
ver State.
After a sufficient number of days had
elapsed Bell received a letter from Van de
Vere, in which was inclosed a receipt, of
which the following is a copy:
Chicago March 8 96
Reed ofGeo H Bell $2000 for professional
services to be rendered C. M. Hodson*
Atty at Law
The purported receipt was on a small
piece of letter-paper, torn from a writing
pad and just large enough to contain the
written matter. There was no letter-head
nor address save "Chicago," and the street
and number of Attorney Hod son's office
were not given.
On learning the foregoing facts Major
Monroe, head of the Postoftice Inspector's
Department, and Herbert P. ThraHof the
same department laid the matter before
Captain Lees. The offense was not against
United States law, and therefore came
under the jurisdiction of the police. Cap
tain Lees advised Major Monroe to have
the Postmaster brought to this City with
out any delay, and Inspector Thrall was
sent to get him. He returned yesterday
morning with Bell, and Captain Lees
made immediate arrangements for addi
tional evidence to convict the accused
persons.
Pending the return of Inspector Thrall
to this City with the Carson Postmaster
Captain Lees had the mediums shadowed
by detectives, who, concealing their real
character, had several sittings with Eugene
and Van de Vere, and from statements
made by them succeeded in obtaining con
siderable valuable evidence.
The captain had arranged that Bell
should have an interview with the medi
ums in the hearing of witnesses, and that
those interviews â which were to be on the
subject of the Scotch millions â were to be
prolonged for several days, so as to
completely trap the schemers. But
at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon a
Call reporter visited Inspector Thrall in
the Appraisers' building and asked forcer
tain details of the story. The information
was refused, but the knowledge that The
Call had the story precipitated matters,
and Captain Lees detailed Detectives
Egan, Graham and Silvey to arrest the
professors on warrants issued by Jndge
Low, the charge being grand larceny by
trick or device.
When tbe prisoners were taken into
Captain Lees' office they were subjected to
a brief examination. Van de Vere admit
ted that he had received $100 from Bell for
professional services as a clairvoyant.and he
denied that he had received,any ljrrger sum
than that. Captain Lees asked him whether
be had received the money on account of
the legacy in Scotland or not Van de
Vere began to apeak, bui suddenly
checked himself and bluntly declined to

answer any questions whatever. He was
taken into the City Prison and was ordered
to turn over the contents of his pockets to
the sergeant at the desk. Fifteen or
twenty dollars in coin, a package of letters,
a garnet scarfpin, a garnet ring and a
large revolver were his effects. The pistol
was the cause of a charge of carrying a
concealed weapon beine placed against
his name. Not being able to furnish $5000
bail. Van de Vere was locked up.
Professor Eugene at first denied that he
had received any money from Bell, but
finally admitted that he had received $175
for sittings at $1 a sitting. By advice of
Captain Lees Bell demanded the money.
Eugene said that he had not the money,
and offered a $200 diamond ring as security
until to-dey. Then, at his own request,
he went out with a detective and got the
coin.
"I received this money voluntarily," said
Professor Eugene, "and I pay it back as
voluntarily."
Postmaster Bell put the cash in his
pocket and an officer put Eugene in jail.
Captain Lees ascertained that the name
of C. M. Hodson did not appear in the
Chicago Directory, although several other
Hodsons are mentioned. In the list of
lawyers there is no one of the name of
Hodson.
The prisoners will be brought before
Judge Low this morning.
The conduct of Postal Clerk Jaqua led
the officers to believe at first that he was
invoKed in the conspiracy to swindle old
man Bell, but after the arrest of the two
professors Captain Lees said that he did
not believe that Jaqua had anything to do
with the matter, he being as cranky as
Bell on spiritualism.
There is an impression abroad, however,
that Jaqua will be an important witness
for the people. No complaint will be
made against him.
Mrs. Eugene, the wife of ProfesÃor Eu
gene, placed her diamonds valued at $1000
with Judge Low last night as a guarantee
of her husband's appearance in court when
wanted.
DR. JAMES' ESTATE.
The Ownership of It Will Be Tested in
the Guardianship Proceedings.
The peculiar fight which is in progress
over the estate of Dr. Charles G. James
will first show itself when the guardian
ship of little Millen James, the alleged
son of the doctor, comes up for a hearing.
When Dr. James died it was suddenly
discovered that his Jandiadv's daughter,
Laura MiHen, laid claim to being his
widow, and the son which was born to her
soon after was put forth as his son. Since
the birth of the boy the mother has ap
plied for letters nf euardianship over him,
and the case will come before J udge Coffey
on April 24. She alleges that the boy has
an estate of considerable value, it being a
son's interest in the $70,000 estate left by
James. When this matter comes urÂ» a
contest will be entered ou the ground fhat
the sou has no interest in James' estate,
as he is not James' son, and upon that
point the case will be tried. If the son's
claims are set aside the mother's will fol
low, and if his chums are upheld so will
her position be assured.

ITALIAN SOCIETY TANGLE
Resignation of the Collector of
the Beneficial Association
Demanded.
P. DAVALLE HIS SUCCESSOB.
Casassa Was Over Three Thousand
Dollars Short in His Ac
counts.
Considerable comment is going on in the
Italian colony over the tangle into which
the affairs of the Mutual Benevolent So
ciety (Societa Italiana di Mutua Ben
elicenza) are stated to have fallen.
A few days ago A. Casassa, the collector
of the society, was quietly but firmly re
quested to resign, and P. Davalle was ap
pointed to his position. A. Casassa was
$3200 behind in his accounts, and at pres
ent the officers of the society are waiting
to see whether Casassa will avail
himself of the few days of grace
given him to pay up his arrears.
The collector's bondsmen, Cay. Calegaris
and G. Cuneoare responsible to the amount
of $500 each, but the remaining $2300 was
stated by the president, J. C. Sala, yester
day, to be without surety.
"I would rather not discuss the subject
till we see what course our late collector
intends to take," said Mr. Sala, when
questioned on the subject yesterday. "We
have given him a few days in which to set
tle his accounts with the society, and it is
our hope and belief that he will act prop
erly with us. If not we shall have to take
other steps."
F. Cavagnaro, the treasurer of the So
cieta Italiana di Mutua Benencenza,
stated yesteruay that it was only at the
beginning of this y*Â»ar that A. Casassa be
gan to fall behind in his accounts. Notic
ing that the books were not tallying, the
treasurer demanded an auditing commit
tee, and himself, h. G. Peri and L. Degr.i
zia were appointed a committee to exam
ine the books. "We worked for several
evenings and found it to be a very siniDlo
sum in addition and subtraction to find that
A. Casassa had collected $3200 more than
lie had accounted for," said F. Cavagnaro.
"When the report was made to th<* society
pressure was at once brought to bear to
make him resign, and at present we are
waiting to see whether he will settle his
deficit. Up to the beginning of the pres
ent year Mr. Casassa was not behindhand
in his accounts."
There are some members of the society
who think that the late collector is being
dealt with a good deal too leniently. Cay.
Calegaris, one of the bondsmen, was heard
to remark yesterday that he would treat
the case differently. Most of the officers
of the society state, however, that they
still behwe Casassa will settle amicably.
The Casassa affair is not the only trouble
which the Societa Italiana di Mutua
Beneficenza has to contend with at pres
ent. The sum of $7600, which the estate
of the late A. Daneri owes the society, is
causing considerable comment on account
of the fact that one at least of the bonds
men, J. Torre, declares that he does not
consider himself under any responsibil
ity in case the estate does not yield the
sum it owes.
The Daneri matter dates back a number
of years. In the days when the society
was struggling for an existence A. Daneri,
the treasurer, lent money to the organiza
tion. As time passed the borrowed money
was paid back and the sums that went on
fradually accumulating were taken by
Ir. Daneri as a loan and were paid a
bank rate of interest for. The amount
borrowed reached $7500 and then Mr.
Daneri stated that he could utilize more
money, and the sums that went on ac
cumulating were deposited in the bank.
In December, 1894, A._ Daneri died sud
denly, leaving his affairs considerably
entangled. The estate is not yet settled
up and the Italian Benevolent Society is
still trying to prove its claim before that
of the other creditors. Should this be al
lowed it will not be necessary to call on
the late A. Daneri's bondsmen, but if the
Judge rules that the society must come in
with the other creditors the estate will
probably not be able to pay the $7500 in
full.
The bondsmen are J. B. Cevasco, G.
Cadenasso and J. Torre, the latter of
whom has been doing a good deal of talk
ing lately to the intent that his property
is "all in Nevada and that he cannot be
held responsible. The officers of the
society express regret that all the bonds
men have talked a little too glibly about
the difficulty in bringing the obligations
of the Daneri estate home to them. These
officers say the society holds papers which
will prove the responsibility of the bonds
men beyond the possibility of a doubt.
