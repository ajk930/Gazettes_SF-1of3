Detail.
CHICAGO, 111., June 26.â The sub
committee on general arrangements, press
and telegraphic facilities of the National
Democratic Convention assembled at the
Palmer House at 11 o'clock to-day for the
purpose of further considering the matters
under its charge. Sergeant-at-Arms liar
tin was called in, and behind closed doors
the sub-committee discussed his an
nounced determination to make up his
list of doorkeepers and all other sub
officials having control of entrances from
applicants outside the city. The commit
tee will probably sustain Colonel Martin
in the stand he has taken.
The following official notice was given
to The United Press for the general in
formation of the press:
"The committee on press and telegraphic
accommodations and facilities for the
Democratic National Convention will
make the assignments of seats on the
press platform on Tuesday, June 30, and
will submit the result of their labors to
the sub-committee in charge of convention
arrangements at its meeting Wednesday,
July L Immediately thereafter the news
papers will be notified of their assign
ments. S. P. Sheerix,
Secretary Democratic National Com
mittee."
Preparations are being made by local
Democrats to have delegations of the
Iroquois Club and other party organiza
tions meet arriving State delegations to
tbe National Convention. Wherever dele

made to meet th>m at the station with an

THE CHICAGO COLISEUM, WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION WILL BE HELD.
The Coliseum is situated at what was the entrance to the World's Fair grounds of 1892 and is in the Italian renaissance style of architecture. It has brick walls, and
tts trusses, girders and columns are of steel. On the first story the color of the brick is buff and the walls are pierced with a regular series of large arched openings, each
opening being fifteen feet in width and filled with glass windows that form a light and beautiful arcade, continuing all the way around the building. The main entrance
k acts directly into the center of a stretch of fluorine 325 teet long and 300 feet wide. The area of the ground floor is fully five acres and a half. The actual seating capacity
df the Coiise'um, the owners declare, is for 20,000 persons. It is twice the size of the Madison-square Garden in New York. From the City Hall the Coliseum is a twenty
minutes' ride. The Illinois Central Railway, the Chicago City Railway, the Alley Elevated Railway, the South Chicago and the Calumet Electric railways run within fifty
feet of the main entrance of tbe building. The railway company managers have pledged themselves to the local committee to operate as many trains as may be needed.
Train service will also be provided at night.

reception committee. Iroquois Club,
Chicago. They will then be notified of
the specific arrangements made for their
reception. Delegates not coming in a
body will be met by committees and
directed to their headquarters if applica
tion is made to that committee.
Colonel John I. Martin of St. Louis, the
sergeant-at-arras of the National Demo
cratic Convention, is bard at work per
j fecting the details of his department. He
I says that the regulations for this conven
| tion will be more strict than those of any
previous one, and he declares they will be
enforced. This is the only way, he be
lieves, by which the crowds can be
handled properly and with justice to all.
'"In my arrangements for handling the
crowds in Convention Hall," said Colonel
Martin, "I shall depend more upon the
organization of my staff than upon num
bers. Chairman Harrity of the National
Committee, Secretary Sheerin, the archi
tect, and myself, spent some little time in
St. Louis Btudying the arrangements there,
and we shall endeavor to profit by thÂ« ex
periences of the Republican Convention.
"In the hrst place I shall appoint about
100 assistants instead of about 900, as they
had in St. Louis. Nine hundred is too ]

many. They .keep eretting in each other's j
way, and are not nearly so effective as a
smaller force better disciplined. Each of
these assistants to the sergeant-at-arms
will have charge of a section, with several
ushers under him. There will be plenty
of ushers, probably 300, and a large num
ber of special officers between the assist
ants and the ushers in authority. These
special officers will be there for emergen
cies. Then there will of course be a large
number of pages."
In his efforts to get a perfect organiza
tion Colonel Martin will appoint a num
ber of chiefs of police of various cities as
assistants.
"I have applications from a number of
chiefs of police," he said, "and of course
they are just the kind of men I want for
these positions. Their experience in or
ganizing men and handling crowds will
make their services very valuable. There
will be eight or ten of them appointed as
sistants to the sergeant-at-arms.
"I want to announce positively," said
the colonel, "that there will be no 'pass
ins' anybody into the convention hall
without a ticket. By that I mean juat
what I say. There is room for just so
many and no more. At St. Louis there
were seats for 13,800. At the Coliseum
here we can seat 15,000, and tickets will be
given out for all those seats. No badges
of any kind will be honored without a
ticket, and if the President himself should
come up without the necessary card of
admission he could not get in until he had
one. Every precaution will be taken to
prevent persons getting into the hall who
have no business there. Even the ushers
will have to show their tickets.
"The big room on the Sixty-third-street
side of the Colliseum will be used as a re
ception-room. Here the public can mingle
with the delegates as freely as desired.
The man who wishes to enter the conven
tion hall, however, must run a gauntlet
even greater than at the fc>t. Louis conven
tion. There will be fifty or sixty door
keepers, assisted by details of police, to
preserve order. As a man starts to enter
tbe hall he will pass between two door
keepers on the outside, who make him
show his ticket. Just inside another pair
will examine his ticket to sift out those
who are trying to work their way in with
out pasteboards and who have passed the
guards on the outside. Still further inside
two more will be stationed to tear off the
coupons, and then the ushers will take the
man in hand and find his seat."
PERRY BELMONT'S BELIEF.
He Says Southern Democrats Will
Support a Gold Standard
Platform.
PARIS, France, June 26.â A representa
tive of the United Press had an interview
with Hon. Perry Belmont at the railway
station to-night as Mr. Belmont was start
ing for Havre on his way to Chicago,
where he goes to attend the National
Democratic Convention. The full text of
the Democratic platform adopted at the
New York State Convention at Saratoga
has not yet been received here, and there
fore Mr. Belmont said its precise scope
could not be correctly appreciated.
If, however, as he believed, the platform
declared that the New York Democracy
protested against any further purchase of
silver by the treasury and against silver
coinage, otherwise than on the basis of an
international agreement, and that the
Democracy will do everything possible to
obtain and secure a fixed international
ratio between the two metals, and if it
has urged the cancellation of greenbacks
and treasury notes hereafter presented to
the treasury and paid in gold, that utter
ance will, Mr. Belmont is confident, com
mand the approbation of an overwhelm
ing majority of the voters in every Eastern
State.
Mr. Belmont said he had known quite
well, during bis years in Congress a great
many of the Southern Democrats who are
pressing for tbe immediate free coinage of
silver at the rate of 16 to 1, and had also
met them four years ago at Chicago when
they contributed to the nomination of
Mr. Cleveland. Mr. Belmont did not be
lieve that the Southern Democrats now
wished, or would tolerate, the disunion at
Chicago of the National Democracy.
"The State of New York," continued
Mr. Belmont, "is now committed by both
of its party organizations to international
bimetallism and a world-wide bimetallic
par. Democratic leaders, such as Tilden
and Manning, have favored it in the past
ana the Southern Democracy also. The
governor of the Bank of France told me a
few days ago that France cannot and will
not consent to a ratio of 16 to 1. France
prefers 15J4 l <> !â¢
"If the National Democracy will at Chi
cago remain united, McKinleyism can be
crushed in November and a fixed interna
tional ratio for silver and gold put within
range of practical effort. Another McKin
iey tariff can be prevented, the issue of
more Government bonds made unneces- .
sary, the National credit upheld, our ex
ports increased and the wages of working
men North and South not to be reduced to
a fifty-cent dollar. It cannot but be that
rather than have disunion in the National
Democracy, as in 1860, the Southern Demo
crats, with whom New York co-operated
in the 1892 election of Mr. Cleveland, will
consent to a reasonable plan whereby free
silver coinage can be deferred until a prac
tical effort is made by a Democratic Presi
dent and Democratic Congress to obtain a
fixed international bimetallic ratio."

RAH FOR CORNELL!
A GREAT BOATRACE
Ithaca Giants Take First
Honors in Superb
Style.
WIN BY FOUR LENGTHS.
A Prettier Contest Was Never
Witnessed on American
Waters.
MULTITUDES OF SPECTATOR?.
Indescribable Enthusiasm Among the
Friends of the Respective
Crews.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N. V., June 26.
--"Rah for Cornell!"
Eighteen thousand people grouped upon
the picturesque banks of the Hudson with
the last rays of the setting sun casting a
golden sheen upon the water saw the stal
wart eight from Ithaca win first honors
over Harvard, Pennsylvania and Colum
bia. It was a great race. Probably no
prettier has been rowed before a ereater
crowd in American waters. All conditions
of air and water were perfect. Not a flaw
marred the contest from the crack of the
starter's pistol to the crossing of the finish
line.
Cornell won by four lengths, in 19:29,
official time. Harvard was second, Penn
sylvania third and Columbia a poor fourth.
As a spectacular scene the race was one
long to be remembered. The course.a four
mile stretch, straight as the crow flies, lay
near the west bank of the Hudson, and
was spanned by the great cantilever
bridge, the finish being one mile below
that structure and the start three miles
above.
The cloudiness of the morning had
given way to bright sunshine, and the
multitude which assembled on both banks
of the river and filled the decks of the
imposing fleet of yachts, excursion steam
ers and pleasure craft of all descriptions
added brightness and color to the scene.
On every hand the flags, ribbons and
banners of the respective colleges were
seen. The crimson of Harvard and the
blue and white of Columbia, the red and
blue of Pennsylvania and the red and
white of Cornell were waved from tugs,
steamers and from groups on the banks.
The steep slopes of the highlands on the
west bank, with the railroad track at their
foot, furnished excellent points for view
ing the race, and crowds of onlookers
utilized the natural amphitheater.
An observation train of: forty-two cars,
with seats for 3500 persons and every se at
occupied, pulled out of the Highland sta
tion and made its way to the starting
point just before the crews were sent off.
It started with the crews and kept abreast
of them all the way to the finish. It was
filled for the most part with college stu
dents or colleee graduates and ladies.
There were some notables on the train,
but while the race was on all hands
seemed to have lost all dignity and united
in a mad chorus of yells for the different
crews. The shouts for Cornell drowned
the others and there was a flash of red and

white flags aa the victorious crew crossed
the line.
Out in the stream, anchored in a line
from the three and one-half mile point
down to the finish there were over
100 yachts, excursion steamers and river
craft of every description. Their decks
were filled with spectators, and in the thick
cluster near the line there wa3 danger of
serious accident.
The only mishap reported, however, was
a collision between the referee's boat Hel
vetia and the Albany steamer Whitney,
resulting in a hole in the latter's bow.
This occurred before the race and did not
interfere with either boat fulfilling her
duties.
The revenue cutters Manhattan and
Hudson and the police boats Walla Walla
and Susie, aided by auxiliary launches,
assigned boats to anchorage positions and
kept the course clear tinder the recently
passed United States law. No b >at ex
cept the referee's boat and the crews of
launches were permitted to foil >w the
crews over the course. This regulation
gave the four crews a perfectly clear course
and the water was undisturbed.
All tlie iiiteruooii special trains from
New York and from Hudson River towns
rolled into the depots on both sides of the
river. All were packed with college en
thusiasts and other people anxious to see
the great race.
The two undersized ferry-boats that ply
between Highland and Poughkeepsie
pushed their way through the waters with
passengers hanging on like flies. Crowds
blockaded the ferry-houses just before and
immediately after the race. It was a
hot, perspiring crowd, but good-natured
withal.
When the crowd had finally distributed
itself along the grassy knolls by the river's
banks and filled the long observation
train the spectators themselves furnished
a marvelous addition of life and color to
the scene. The long train of flatcars,
packed with gayly costumed women and
men with flags of the different colleges,
presented a kaleidoscopic mass of color
that was dazzling to the eye. The yachts
in the river were decked with bunting
from stem to stern, and each group of on
lookers along the shore stood out in relief
on the dark-green setting of the wooded
hillsides. The 'greatest gathering was
near the finish, for all wanted to see tbe
victors cross the linÂ«. Venturesome lads
climbed trees and some ascended from
rowboats to the stone piers of the bridge.
In all the crowd there was probably none
who did not have a good view of some
portion of the race, and a grander strug
gle has seldom been seen. When the
anxious crowds near the finish caught
their first glimpse of the orews they were
as four specks upon the water. Gradually

Strength and skill won the day, and no

they were no maicb for the winners.

CHICO, Cal., June 26. â Miss Bessie
Collins will represent Butte County at the
Monterey flag-raising celebration. She is
the winner of one of the most exciting
elections ever held in tbe county â a con
test in which nine-tenths of the population
figured as active partisans.
The voting ended at midnight last night.
The committee appointed to make the
count then repaired to the office of the
Chronicle-Record where the arduous duty
of counting the thousands of coupons con
sumed two hours â hours full of anxiety
for the friends and workers of the several
rival beauties. As the judge of the elec
tion stepped forth and announced that
Miss Bessie Collins was the choice of Butte
County by 3000 majority loud were the
cheers from the gathered throng.
During the contest it was impossible to
guess the winner, as the other candidates â
Miss Katie Wertsbaugher and Miss Jennie
Clark â were supported by stanch friends.
First one and then the other would be in
the lead.
Miss Collins, now the "Goddess of
Butte." is one of the most popular young
ladies of this county. She was in the con
test for the Queen of May, and was elected
by a handsome majority as a maid of
honor to the Queen, whom she served well
during the May fiesta. Miss Collins is ot
average height, graceful and well formed.
She is a blonde, with large blue eyes and
a luxurient growth of wavy hair. She is a
graduate of '95 of the Chico State Normal
School, having finished her course when
but 17 years of age, passing as one of the
highest in the class. Miss Bessie was born
on the Llano Seco rancho, of which her
father was for many years the superin
tendent, and has resided in Chico most of
her life.

FREE COINAGE LITERATURE.
Populists Anxious for the Democracy
to Name a Strictly Silver
Ticket.
CHICAGO, 111., June 26.â The active
campaign of tne various silver elements,
preparatory to the Democratic National
Convention, will be inaugurated on Tues
day next, when the Bimetallic National
Democratic Committee, which is made up
of leading silver Democrats throughout the
country, assembles at the Sherman House.
The large clubroom oi the hotel and six
conference rooms have been engaged for
the meeting, which promises to be very
largely attended, the Democratic com
rnitteemen of a number of Western and
Southern States having wired for accom
modations for themselves and friends.
Theodore Nelson, secretary of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, who is in
control of the preliminary arrangements,
said this morning.
"The conference will commence on
Tuesday and its work will continue until
the Democratic National Convention has
adjourned. The main purpose is to influ
ence if not to determine the platform posi
tion of the convention, and we expect to
exert a potent if not a controlling influ
ence in that gathering. The leading silver
men of the country will be here with us
and will have a full share in our delibera
tions."
This will not be the only round-up of the
white metal advocates. A week from Sun
day the members of the executive commit
tee of the American Bimetallic Union will
assrmble in this city preparatory to' a con
vention on the following day. The Union
is a non-partisan organization, its purpose
being to promote a sentiment lavorable to
silver by the abundant distribution of lit
erature and the providing of speakers for
public meetings.
National Secretary George E. Bowen
said this morning: "The obj j et of the
meeting is to look over the ground on the
eve of the assembling of the Democratic
Convention and see what can be accom
plished in tne way of a union of the bi
metallic forces, in order that the entire
silver strength of the country may, if pos
sible, be concentrated on one candidate."
H. F. Bartine, editor of the National
Bimetallism added that from hundreds of
letters which were being received daily
from all parts of the country it was ap
parent that the Populist party was anxious
that the Democrats should take neutral
ground in the matter of candidates and
nominate a ticket upon a strictly silver
platform, which would be acceptable to
the forces of the People's party.
"It is apparent from this corres
pondence." said Mr. Bartine, "that if
Senator Teller should be nominated he
will receive the unqualified indorsement
and support of the Populists. As to any
other candidate I cannot say so much."
Between these two meeting there will
be yet another. A week from to-morrow
the National executive committee of the
new silver party will open headquarters at
one of the leading hotels. As in the other
cases, the purpose of the meeting is to
assist in rallying and concentrating the
silver delegates, to the end that a strad
dling platform may be avoided and a clean
cut declaration in favor of thÂ» white metal
secured. The three committees will act
independently, but harmoniously.
HIS GRASS IS GONE.
The Tread of Many Republican Feet
Has Denuded McKinley's Yard
of Its Verdure.
CA NTON, Ohio, June 26.â Charles Em
ory Smith of Philadelphia arrived to-day
and had a long talk with Major McKinley.
Many phases of the campaign and the
method of conducting it were discussed.
C. L. Magee of Pittsburg came in during
the morning. He thinks the tariff ratber
than the sound-money question will be
the effective issue among the great work
ing classes of Pennsylvania and predicts
a larger majority for McKinley in that
State than was ever given a Presidential
candidate. He believes the money ques
tion will be potent in tne East and that
the platform adopted by the Republicans
will make it impossible for the Democrats
to carry New York with a free-silver can
didate.
The reception this afternoon by the
ladies of Canton to Major and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley and the venerable mother of the
major, was largely attended. For more
than two hours an unbroken stream of
women passed in and out. It was a good
natured, smiling crowd of all sorts and
conditions of life, which numbered 5000.
The light of day was exclude I, and in
candetcent burners gave forth a blaze of
glory. The reception commenced with a
apeech. It was made by Mrs. Alice Dan
nos-Jones, and was delivered before the
doors were opened. The assembled hosts
of women had to listen to the speech or
leave the reception.
Major McKinley, in a dozen words,
thanked the ladies for their presence and
with his wife and mother received the
women of bis town. The major stood at
the left of bis wife and made ihe introduc
tions.
This evening a delegation of cheerful
shouters from NorwalK, some 300 in num
ber, called upon Major McKinley and
trampled the last spots of verdure from
his beloved lawn. Major McKinley took
much pride in his lawn and counted it the
most beautiful in Canton. To-night it is a
wreck. He bears the loss with becoming
humor, however.
â¢ The Norwalk Republican Club was in
troduced by ex-Speaker Laylin of the Ohio
House of Representatives, who dwelt upon
tne fact that Huron County has been a
strong Republican county for forty years.
In response Major McKinley said in part:
"No man anywhere throughout the coun
try doubts where the Republican party
stands to-day. It stands for a reunited
country, it stands for the American fac
tory, the American farm, the American
fireside, for American labor and American
waces and American prosperity; to unite
every part of our much-ioved land. It
stands for a protective tariff that protects
every American interest. [Loud applause.]
It stands for a reciprocity that reciprocates ;
that gets something lor that we give to the
nations of the world. It stands for the
reciprocity of Blame and of Harrison and
of the great Republican party ["loud ap
plause], and it stands now, as it has al
ways stood, for sound money [vociferous
cheers] with which to measure the ex
changes of the peopleâ a dollar that is not
only good at home, but good in every
market place of the world. [Cries of
'Bravo!'] With these principles em
blazoned on our banner this year â 1896â
we appeal to the deliberate judgment of
the American people, and as Lincoln used
to say, 'There is no safer tribunal in the
world than the American people,' and to
that tribunal we confidently submit our
aims and purposes this year."

TELLER IS THE MAN.
Senator Mantle Thinks He Would
Be Elected If Nominated
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., June 26.â Senator Lee
Mantle of Montana, who is in this city, is
emphatic in his indorsement of the candi
dacy of Senator Teller for the Presidential
nomination. In an interview in a local
paper he says:
"In my opinion he is at this time the
only man in the public mind who can
draw to himself the full strength of tne bi
metallic sentiment of the country, and un
less the full strength of the movement can
be concentrated upon one man defeat is
certain."
"Do you think a silver Democrat could
win?"
'â¢I do not. In the firsf place it is only
upon rhe issue of bimetallism as opposed
to the gold standard policy of the Repub
lican party that the Democratic party has
the slightest chance of success in this
campaign.
"It -must also be remembered in this
connection that the silver question is not
distinctively a Democratic principle. The
People's party has pushed the silver
question to the front and made it the
principal plank in its platform.
"Then again, there are the silver Repub
licans, who constitute a. far more numer
ous element than is generally supposed.
â¦'The Populists and the silver Repub
licans jointly will, I think, number at
least 3,000,000 votesâ nearly or quite one
third of the votes necessary to bring suc
cess.
"Senator Teller has formally renounced
the Republican party, so that in support
ing him no Democrat need fear that he is
voting for a Republican.
"With him as their nominee I firmly be
lieve the Democrats can snatch a victory
! from what, up to the meeting of the Na
tional Republican Convention at St.
Louis, was the most hopeless prospect
which ever confronted a political party."
BLAND'S CAMPAIGN OPENS.
Preparations Being: Made to
Further His Interests at
the Convention.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 26.â Bland head
quarters will be opened at Chicago next
Monday. Colonel Nicholas M. Bell,
Colonel Joseph K. Rickey and George W.
Allen will be in charge. They are all mem
bers of the Bland executive committee, of
which Governor Stone is chairman.
Governor Stone's newspaper organ an
nounces that on the heels of the meeting
of the National executive committee of
the Democratic Bimetallic League at
Chicago next Thursday, a conference of
the representatives of all the silver forces
of the Nation would be held at Chicago.
At this conference Bland's nomination
will be urged by his friends on the plea
that when the silver men enter the con
vention their strength should not be
divided between candidates. This could
be done, it is contended, with perfect
safety to the interests of favorite ones,
none of whom, with possibly two excep
tions â Boies and Matthewsâ hope for more
than a complimentry vote from their re
spective States on the first ballot; then,
after the initial ballot, according to the
present understanding of those favorable
to the conference plan, the votes of the
free-silver States' favorites will be cast for
the caucus nominee.
This plan is said to be entirely satisfac
tory to Mr. Bland's friends, who are per
fectly willing to abide the issue, and if the
supporters of Governor Matthews and
Governor Boies can be brought to view
the matter in the same light and with the
same equanimity, the proposed conference
will beheld Saturday, July 4, and if the
resolt for which it was called is then not
reached, it will continue in session from
day to day until the object is attained.
MARK HANNA'S MONEY.
Many Thousands of Dollars of It
Have Been Expended In Mc-
Kinley's Behalf.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, June 16.â An in

devoted his entire time to the cause, but
contributed freely toward its expenses. A
canvass extending over several years is an
expensive undertaking, and the money had
to come from somewhere.
"Mr. Hanna said recently that the
canvass cost him $100,000. Of that amount
$38,000 was contributed by friends of Mc-
Kinley throughout the country. As one
item of the expenses it may be said that
the cost of keeping the friends of the cause
posted on its progress was $2500. This was
done by mailing 1600 copies daily of one of
the local official organs to the convention
delegates and leading Republicans in all
parts of the country. This was kept up
for several months and was but a single
feature of one of the most perfect organiz
ations ever made in political campaign."

YELLOW FEVER
SCOURGING CUBA.
The Most Alarming Report
Comes From Sagua
la Grande.
AN EPIDEMIC IS FEARED
Sanitary Conditions Arising From
the War Aggravate the
Situation.
HAVOC AMONG THE SPANIARDS
Every Precaution Will B3 Taken to
Keep the Disease Out of This
Country.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 26.â The
mostaiarming report from Cuba with re
spect to yellow fever comes from Sagua la
Grande, where the marine hospital service
is advised by its last report that were forty
one cases and four deaths. It is expected
that within a very short time the fever will
become epidemic and if it does not become
virulent in the city of Havana all previous
experiences will be set aside. The depart
ment has, however, received no advices to
the ertect that cholera has appeared any
where on the island.
The present war and its relation to the
sanitary condition of Cuba is referred to in
the last annual report of Surgeon-General
Wyman and the statements then made
will represent the conditions of this sum
mer, only in a more aggravated form.
On this subject General Wyman then
said the insurrection had interfered to a
great extent in the transmission of exact
information from the disturbed provinces,
and the normal condition of health in the
island had been largely modified by the
presence of a great body of non-immune
Spanish soldiers. These persons have
taken the disease and added to the natural
number of cases annually prevalent in
that island. The difficulties experienced
last summer will be again met with this
year.
Accurate knowledge as to the number of
troops stricken with the disease is denied
by the Spanish Government. The reports
from Havana last year showed a total of
1593 cases and a mortality of 30 per cent.
This summer special precautions will be
taken to prevent the introduction from
Cuba into the United States of yellow
fever. Each of the four revenue cutters
patrolling the Florida coast carries sani
tary inspectors to intercept fishing smacKs
and other vessels coming direct from Cuba
with no intent to enter legally any port of
entry, and also for the purpose of inter
cepting any returning filibustering expe
dition or refugees seeking to land surrep
titiously. Sanitary inspectors either have
been or will be stationed permanently in
Havana and Santiago, and such inspectors
will be sent to every seaport of Cuba to re
port to tiie Marine Hospital Service of the
prevalence of yellow fever.
FUNDS FOR WENLER.
A Royal Decree Ihat Displeases the Mer
chants of Cuba.
HAVANA, Cuba, June 26.â The naval
officer, Pando, who was shot in the attack
by rebels upon a gunboat which was as
cending the Cauto River recently is re
ported to have died from his wounds.
Captain-General Weyler has issued an
urgent order to the military commander
at Santa Clara instructing him to con
struct barracks in which to place the troops
who may be taken sick during the present
rainy season.
A royal decree has been received here
authorizing the Spanish bank to issue $12,
--000,000 in gold bills, the same to be handed
to the local treasury in payment of cur
rent obligations. The Government will
transfer to the bank $3,000,000 in silver
and will allow the bank to retain part of
the receipts from the stamp tax as security
for the remainder of the issue.
Merchants are displeased with the pro
ject and will soon hold a meeting and
adopt resolutions in defense of their inter
ests. The local press comments unfavor
ably on the project. The Government Is
authorized to enforce the circulation of
the notes.

NEAT TRIPLE EXECUTION
Three Murderers Are Dispatched
by Colorado's Automatic
Device.
Their Crime Was the Killing of
Night Watchman Solomon at
Trinidad.
CANYON. CITY, Colo., Jane 26.â A
triple execution occurred in the State peni
tentiary to-night shortly after 8 o'clock,
when William Holt, aged 22, Albert Noble,
aged 35, and Deonocio Romero, aged 38,
were led from their cells in the execution
house to the death chamber and were
separately hanged by the automatic device
which has proven so successful in past exe
cutions. According to the law no one but
the warden, the prison surgeon and a few
authorized witnesses are permitted to be
present at such times. Each man in turn
was ushered into the death chamber and
seated upon a chair placed upon the trap.
After cap and noose are adjusted the auto
matic device is set in motion, and in due
time the trao is sprung.
The crime for which these men were
executed was tne murder of a night
watchman in Trinidad, named Solomon,
which occurred one night in November,
1895, while the trio were in the act of rob
bing a gambling saloon. Before they had
completed their job Solomon appeared
and Bought to arrest them. They were
well armed and without a moment's hesi
tation shot the officer down and escaped.
They were afterward captured by a
Sheriff's posse, tried, convicted and sen
tenced.
Young Holt, who was led by his com
panions into this scheme, had sought for
some leniency, but the .Board of Pardons
after reviewing the case refused the peti
tion.
The plot to rob the gamblmg-houae was
originated by Mrs. Martinez, who wanted
money with which to defend her son
Leandro, who was then under arrest for
the murder of one Charles Allen. Lean
dro Martinez is now serving a life term in
the "pen" for the crime. The woman was
never tried for complicity in Solomon's
murder.
BIKING WITHOUT A LICENSE.

PITTSBURG, Pa., June 26.â Two years

riders should pay a tax of 50 cents each,

Solomon Coulson, Assistant Superintend
ent of Police, appeared, wearing his every
day uniform, which is so gorgeous that
Miss Hall stopped to look at him.
Then Coulson saw she had no plate on
her wheel and arrested her. Miss Hall
was taken to the police station and turned
over to the matron.
Magistrate MacÂ«onigle came in an hour
later and gave her a hearing. Because of
her ignorance of the ordinance he reduced

THE VENEZUELAN
TROUBLE ENDED,
Harrison's Surveying Party
Is Released From
Custody.
RELIEF AT WASHINGTON
Secretary Olney Breathes More
Freely After the Great
Tension.
THE INCIDENT'S GOOD EFFECT.
Will Hasten the Settlement of the
Whole Controversy by
Arbitration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 26.âMinis
ter Andrade at noon to-day received the
following telegram, and immediately sent
a copy to Secretary Olney:
CARACAS, June 26.â l'esterday when the
national commissary at Cuyuai telegraphed
the occurrence that Harrison and nineteen
others had crossed to the left bank of the
Cuyuni to open a road, the aub-commlssary of
Acarabeai protested in writing, but Harrison
insisted, and the sub-commissary took him to
the post of El Dorado. As soon as the Govern
ment was Informed thereof it ordered the re
lease of Harrison and asked details.
The dispatch confirms the impression
that the Venezuelans were not at fault,
and that the statu quo observed for several
years was broken by the Harrison survey
ing party.
Senor Rojas' dispatch announcing Har
rison's release has relieved the State De
partment and diplomatic circles of the
tremendous tension they have been under
for several days, notwithstanding the pre
vailing confidence that the blame would
not be found to rest altogether with the
Venezuelans.
The main question which is understood
to have caused Secretary Olney the most
concern was the exact location of Harri
son's defiance of the written Venezuelan
protest. All doubts on this point were set
aside when the geographical experts con
sulted decided that the proposed line
of road from the Upper Barima to Cuyuni,
where tne surveying party was stopped, was I
clearly west of the Schomburgk line and
therefore in territory whicn the British
bad hitherto refrained from violating.
The Acarabisi River and the Schom
burgk line are identical at and near the
Cuyuni, the Venezuelan district in which
the arrest was made being named for the
river. A number of Englishmen and
Americans are engaged in mining and
other pursuits in this district, but they
recognize Venezuelan jurisdiction and
operate under Venezuelan licenses. The
British Guiana police militia has not at
tempted to exercise authority in the dis
trict.
It is thought among officials that in
view of the latest developments public
clamor in England against the Vene
zuelans will promptly subside, and that in
a spirit of fair play the authorities of the
South American republic will be treated
with much greater respect.
Under such circumstances confidence is
expressed that the incident will give a
strone impetus to the movement in favor
of settling the whole question by arbitra
tion instead of undoing all that had been
accomplished through Secretary Olney's
firm and persistent demand that all
boundary disputes on the American con
tinent must be included in any general
arbitration treaty between England and
the United States. Sir Julian Paunce
lote, the British Embassador, had an
interview with Secretary Olney this after
noon, presumably on that point.
LONDON PRESS COMMENTS.
General Satisfaction Expressed at the
Outcome of the Incident.
LONDON, Eng., June 26.â The Chroni
cle, commenting on the statement that
Venezuela had ordered the release of
Crown Surveyor Harrison, will to-morrow
say that President Crespo acted gracefully
and wisely. It adds that the incident has
done good in showing that Great .Britain
and America are on such terma that the
former can request the good offices of the
latter when Venezuela misbehaves.
The Post will say: It is not an altogether
comforting reflection that Mr. Harrison's
release was dÂ«e to the influence of the
United States, although, under the pecu
liar conditions of the case, there was no
alternative except to seek American in
tervention.
The Standard will say that it was better
for all parties that Mr. Harrison's release
was effected through the friendly offices
of the United States than by a direct per
emptory demand addressed to Venezuela.
The incident encourages the hope that it
will lead to a settlement of the Anglo-
Venezuelan dispute and the resumption
of diplomatic relations.

FRENZIED FATHER'S DEED
Pours Cyanide of Potassium
Down the Throat of
His Child.
Then Swallows a Fatal Dose Himself,
After Return ng Home From
a Debauch.
CHICAGO, 111.. June 26.â Louis Rose
land, wbo bad been employed at the Pull
man Car Works for two years as a bra?s
finisher, murdered his two-year-old child,
Weedie, early this morning in a drunken
frenzy by pouring cyanide of potassium
down her throat, and killed himself by
taking the same poison.
The tragedy occurred in the flat at Pull
man where Roseland, his wife and two
children lived, and Mrs. Roseland fought
her husband like a tiger ia her effort to
rescue the little one from his clutches.
The murderer, who came home last night
from a three days' debauch, slept with his
victim apart from his wife, who was
aroused first by hearing her child ask the
inhuman father for a drinfc of water. In
stead ne went to the faucet, mixed the
poison with water and forced the child to
drink, under the pretense that he was giv
ing her milk. Rushing into the room, the
frantic mother rained her hardest blows
on his breast and face until he released
her dying child, only to seize his wile and
toss her across the room. The child fell
to the floor and was soon dead, while the
poisoner, who had already drank from the
drug, stood erect only long enough to
gasp, "Good -by; I've taken poison."

NEW YORK. X. V.. June 26.-MabelH.
Cbannint?, an actress, known to the stage '
as Mabel Howe, was married by Mayor
Strong yesterday to Chester N. White, an â¢
ex-lieutenant in the United State* navy.
The bride is the daughter of Dr. William i
Chancing of New Bedford, Mass. Mr.
White said he was a native of Philadel
phia, a eraduate of Annapolis and that up
to a few months ago he had been on the
revenue cutter Bear on the Pacific Coast.
Beyond these facts ihe couple would
only say that they had "run away" from
San Francisco six months *:go, and had
hastened to New York to be married.
They were introduced to Mayor Strons
by C. F. Phillips of the Trocadero Music
Hall, who vouched for their aces and
acted as best man. Mr. White said he
and his wife were going at once to her
father's home in New Bedford.
This is not Mr. White's first matrimo
nial venture. He startled the revenue
cutter service of the Pacific Coast last No
vember by resigning his commission a few
days after his return to San Francisco
from a seven months' cruise in the Arctic
regions on the revenue cutter Bear. A
few days later be deserted his wife in San
Francisco and eloped with Mable Howe,
who was then playing in California with
"The Passing Show."
White bad known the actress since ber
childhood and tney were at one time en
gaged to be married. The match is said to
have been broken off by White's father,
who secured his transfer to the Pacific
Coast, where he met and married his first
wife.
After eloping from San Francisco with
Miss Charming, he succeeded in honorably
resigning from the navy. Where he and
Miss Charming have lived since that time
is not known. Soon after his departure
his wife began proceedings against him
I for divorce.

STORY OF HIS CRIMES.
Their Discovery a Result of
/ Bitter Political Contro
versies.
SOCIALISTS TOG HIS STEPS.
While a Discarded Mistress, Out of
Revenge, Causes the Arrest of
the Fugitive.
BEKLIN, Germany June 26.â The
Supreme Court of the Empire, sitting at
Leipj ?, has rejected the appeal of Baron
yon Hammerstein, formerly leader of the
Conservatives in the Reichstag, and editor
in-c.'iief of the Kreuz Zeitung, from the
sentence imposed upon him by the Berlin
co::rt upoi his conviction of forgery on
A ril22 last.
Che sentence of the court was that he be
imprisoned for three years at hard labor,
that he forfeit his civil rights for five years
and that he pay a fine of 1200 marks.
Baron yon Hammerstein became in
volved in bitter political quarrels, in the
course of which the fact was made public
that he was guilty of acts of forgery and
embezzlement for which he should be
prosecuted. He tried for a while to brave
the matter out, but seeing that bis arrest
was inevitable he, with his family, fled
from Berlin last July, all of them being in
somewhat straitened circumstances.
In the meantime evidences of his gnilt,
as the result of fresh discoveries, were ac
cumulating. It also transpired that he
had been maintaining a mistress, a young
Jewess named Flora Glass, in luxurious
styJe, which accounted for the fact that he
and his family were in such a pecuniary
plight.
From Fraulein Glass the socialists man
aged to obtain by purchase and otherwise
a number of Hammerstein's letters, im
plicating a number of Conservative lead
ers and others in his crimes and misde
meanors, and threatened to make them
public. They tried to have them read in
tbe course of a debate in the Reichstag,
but the president would not permit their
contents to be disclosed. They also ac
cused the Government of having connived
at Hammerstein's escape, and declared
that the authorities had frowned upon any
genuine attempts to capture him, in order
to prevent disclosures affecting the Con
servative supporters of the Government.
These insinuations and open assertions,
however, were completely flattened out by
the discovery of Hammerstein in Decem-
Der last'by a Berlin commissary of police
in Athens, where he had represented him
self to fhe Greeks as a well-to-do commis
sion merchant of the name of William
Herbert. The German police had tracked
him through Switzerland and Italy, and
finally overhauled and stopped him as he
wa^ anding from a steamer at Piraeus,
the port of Athens, and five miles from
the city.
Having run him down the police com
missaries watched him closely during '.he
entire time occupied in making applica
tions in secret to the Greek Government
for his surrender.
The Greek Government does not extra
dite culprits except for capital offenses,
but under pressure from Berlin tne Athens
authorities took advantage of Hammer
ptein's having registered himself as "Wil
lian Herbert" to expel him from the
kingdom as an anarchist suspect.
Haramerstein, therefore, was compelled
to leave, and embarked on a steamer lor
BrindisL fhe German police also took
passage on the steamer, and the moment
the vessel sailed Commissary Woif of the
German police placed him under arrest,
and be was suDsequently brought back to
Berlin for trial. It was learned that his
mistress, Fraulein Glass, had informed the
police of Hammerstein's whereabouts from
time to time, betraying this and other
secrets out of revenge, because he did not
take her with him in his flight instead of
taking his family.
ILL-USED SEAMEN COMPLAIN
Another Story of Brutal Treatment at the
Hands of Officers, Desertion and
Recapture.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 26.â Five sail
ors who shipped on tbe snip W. F. Bab
cock for Honolulu and New York six
months ago in San Francisco appeared be
fore Deputy Shipping Commissioner Kee
nan yesterday and complained that Cap
tain Robert /J. Graham was wrongfully
â¢withholding their waces. They also told
a 6tory of alleged ill treatment by the cap
tain, First Mate McEachan and the second
mate.
The story, as far as it could be gleaned
from the contradictory stories of the men
and the captain, is that twelve of the
crew deserted at Honolulu, and that the
captain was compelled to engage a crew of
stevedores at $2 50 a day to unload and
load his ship. He wishes to deduct this
from the pay of the deserters â who were
subsequently arrested and returned to
biniâ as well as $(>O, the price of a plate
glass window broken by members of the
crew and paid for by the captain.
The men declare that they were driven
to leave the ship by the cruelty of the offi
cers, and say that they were advised by
the Honolulu police to break the window J
of a Chinese laundry so that they would
be held in Honolulu after the ship sailed.
They deny that the captain paid as much
as $2 60 a day ior their substitutes. They
also declare that their treatment on the
eoyage from Honolulu to New York was j
than before. One man exhibited a
blood-stained coat and said that he had
been beaten into insensibility by the cap
lain with a pair of handcuffs. Another
man, Carl Bauer, said that he had been
tnocked down as many as twenty times
with a capstan bar by McEachan, and a
[bird testified that the second mate had
3r> ken tbe fingers of two Japanese sailors
\ith a beiayin*: pin.
Captain Graham exhibited a certificate
nun KIHs Mills, the American Consul at
fi on- lulu, staling that he had investigated
;he eh irges of cruelty and found them to
>c unfounded.
The investigation will be continued to
layand the captain will be required to pro
luce bills for all his claims against tne
wages of the men. If they are allowed the
sailors will lose all their wages and still be
in debt to the ship.
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.
Their Work for a Gold Standard
Will Not Be Regarded as "Per
nicious Activity."
NEW YORK, N. V., June 26.â A Herald
special from Washington says: Active
participation by administration officials
in the interest of sound money at the Chi
cago Convention will not be regarded by
President Cleveland as "pernicious activi
ty" or as a violation of the civil service
law. There is to be no official announce
ment to this effect, but it is asserted that
President Cleveland will not tbrow any
obstacles in the way of any member of the
administration taking part in the fight for
sound money at Chicago.
He does not, of course, wish prominent
administration officials to go there witli a
brass band, but he can see no objection to
those who can properly be spared from
their duties taking a leave of absence for
the purpose of gome to Chicago to par
ticipate in a dignified way in an effort to
convince the siiver delegates of the error
of their way.
Taking the cue from the President's
interview recently published and his
activity in writing letters to prominent
politicians and business men throughout
the country, many prominent officials
have determined to assist in the good
work by visiting the convention and ap
pealing personally to delegates who are
committed to free silver.
It is not likely that any of the Cabinet
officers will go to Chicago, but most of the
Assistant Secretaries and many heads of
bureaus in the various departments here
will be present at the convention. Assist
ant Secretary Hamlin of the Treasury De
partment, ComptrolJer Eckles, Mr. Pugh,
First Assistant Postmaster-General Jones,
Second Assistant Postmaster-General Max
well and Assistant Secretary of the Navy
McAdoo are among those who have de
cided to go to Chicago.
While the administration men who are
going to the convention propose to do all
in their power for the cause of sound
money, they realize that their task will be
one of great difficulty. The temoer of the
silver men and their determination to rule
or ruin the party are better understood in
Washington, perhaps, than in any other
place in the country.
SILVER PARTY CONVENTION
Preparations Being: Made for Its
Meeting: In St. Louis
Next Month.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., June 26.â Dr. J. J.
Mott of Statesville. N. C. chairman of the
National Committee of the Silver party,
has come to St. Louis to establish head
quarters for the party. Its National Con
vention is to be held at Music Hall, in the
Exposition building, on July 22, the day
set for the opening of the Populist Na
tional Convention at the Auditorium.
Mr. Mott was asked lor his views of the
proposed union of the silver forces.
"It seems to me that our only chance of
a complete victory at the polls next No
vember lies in coalition," he answered.
"The silver men cannot win if they divide
their strength between two tickets. That
there will be a coalition between the silver
party and the Populists I have no doubt
whatever. I may be wrong, hut I hon
estly believe that Henry M. Teller could
poll more votes for President of the United
States than any other candidate."
Next week Mr. Mott will leave for Chi
cago to attend a meeting there of the
National Committee of the Silver party on
the Fourth of July. The object of the
meeting is to confer wit.i the leaders of
the silver wing ol the Democratic party
on the proposed plan oi coalition.

The Careless Manner in Which Thou
sands of Dollars Were Knocked
About.
The troubles of Richard S. Williams, the
Chinese interpreter recently dismissed by
Collector Wise, and his wife, Isabella M.
Williams, wero aired in Judge Seawell's
court yesterday.
Mrs. Williams is suing her husband for
j divorce oh the ground of extreme cruelty.
I An order was recently issued by Judge
i Seawell forbidding Williams interfering
I with or speaking to his wife. The inter
preter, however, on meeting her on the
street a short time ajo disobeyed this
order and tried to make her converse with
i him. He pursued her, despite the presence
of a policeman, and only desisted when
she pointed a rusty pistol in his face.
Mr~. Williams nas $3000 in a local bank,
and Williams claiming this to be com
munity property, asked for an order of
court permitting him to take possession
of $1500 of it. Mrs. Williams yesterday
entered a demurrer, alleging that Williams'
statement that he is without money is
false. She claims that on April 29, 1896,
I when she left her husband at their home
at 422 Scott street, she w&s obliged to jump
out of a window to escape physical injury.
In her haste to cet away. Mrs. Williams
says, she left $5300 in greenbacks in a,
kitchen drawer, wrapped up in a towel,
and over $800 in gold in a canvas bag in
a medicine-chest. She claims to have
later written a note to Williams so in
forming him. On June 8, it is further
I claimed, she and a female friend met the
j interpreter on thÂ»p street, and, although he
denied finding $6000 in the house, ac
knowledged finding $5000 in all.
Williams denies having found any
money, and asks for half of the $5000 in
the bank.
It 13 also claimed that there are a num
ber of personal effects of Mrs. Williams
at the Scott-street house, which she is
afraid to go after. They are to be delivered
at 1028 Greenwich street.
Judge Seawell has taken the matter un
der advisement.

Disposed to Return to Their Old
Style When a Fast Stroke
Is Attempted.

Better, as Judged by the Watch.
Holder.
HENLEY, Ekg., June 26.â Mr. Elling
ton, the rowing expert /of the London
Field, has furnished to The United Press
his impressions as to the work of the Yale
crew on the Thames.
"The Yale men have not improved dur
ing the week," he says. "At a slow stroke
they row well with a good length of stroKe
and body swing, but when they row at a
faster stroke they are disposed to return
to their old style. Yesterday they
were nine seconds slower than the New
College crew in rowing to the Frawley
Court boathouse â half the course â and to
day, with a strong wind behind them,
their time was 3:33 to Frawley Court boat
house and 7:17 to the finish, rowing at a
stroke of thirty-two to the minute.
"Compared with this work Trinity Hall
rowed half the course in 3:31 and the
whole course in 7:15, at a 34 stroke, while
Leander did the half course in 3:22."
As to Dr. McDowell's work Mr. Elling
ton said: "Dr. McDowell is rowing much
better. He is very fast, but his staying
qualities are doubtful owing to the
cramped style in which he rows."
The Yale crew took dinner last evening
with Dr. J. F. Cooper, secretary of the
Royal Henley regatta committee, and
Mayor Simonds of Henley. ,
Bob Cook has raised the slides of the
Yale boat, and the men in consequence
sit higher and are doing much better olade
work.
RAH FOR CORNELL!
A GREAT BOATRACE,
\ Continued from I\rst Paoe.\
Cornell got away second, Pennsylvania
third, and Harvard, who was on the out
side and consequently farthest from the
Helvetia, got away last; but the start was
a very fair one and none of the crews had
any too much the best of it.
Scarce twenty strokes had been rowed
when a deep groan went up from the train
as the champions of last year, the much
fancied upholders of Columbia, were seen
to drop bacfc in the ruck. Before 200 yards
had been traversed the " 'Rah I 'Rah !
'Rah!" of Harvard announced that the
crimsons had forged their boat's nose
ahead of Pennsylvania, who were level
with Cornell, while Columbia was already
a length to the bad.
At the quarter-mile Harvard led Penn
sylvania by a length, while Cornell was
just about an eighth of a length behind
the Quakers and a length ana a half in
front of the Columbia men.
Coming up to the half-mile mark Cor
nell drew up to Pennsylvania's canvas
and it was nip and tuck for second place
between them, while both crews were
gaining on the leader.
Passing the first mile Harvard's lead
was cut down to three-quarters of a
length, while Cornell was rowing along
just fast enough to keep her a quarter of a
length in front of the Quaker crew. Co
lumbia was dropping farther astern as
though her shell was anchored. Cornell
and Harvard was setting a thirty-five clip
at the mile, but Cornell was putting more
force behind their stroke and had cut
down the Cambridge lads' advantage to
half a length. Pennsylvania, who was
rowing thirty-three to the minute, held
Cornell to half a length, while the Quakers
were still four Jengths ahead of Columbia.
When the two-mile mark was passed
Cornell was only an eighth of a length
behind Harvard and a length in front of
Pennsylvania. Even up between Cornell
and Harvard was the order at the two
mile flag. Cornell was still a length ahead
of Pennsylvania. A quarter farther on
saw Cornell in the vanguard position from
Harvard, despite the latter' s desperate re
sistance, and Pennsylvania was three
lengths behind the crimson. Then Cor
nell began to snow the effects of Courtney's
ideas imbibed in England last year. With
long sweeping strokes the Ithacans had
their shell a length ahead of Harvard, who
were in turn four lengths in front of Penn
sylvania. The Columbia? were splashing
badly eight or ten lengths to the bad and
could scarcely keep their boat on an even
keel.
Half a mile from the finish the order
was: Cornell first by two and a half
lengths, Harvard second By three lengths,
while Pennsylvania was about fifteen
lengths in front of Columbia.
A tremendous amount of noise greeted
Cornell as they entered the last quarter of
their trying journey, three lengths in
front of Harvard, on whom Pennsylvania
was creeping up fast, two lengths dividing
the pair. Cornell hit the stroke up to 37
*for the final burst and crossed the line a
winner by about four lengths. Pennsyl
vania also increased its speed in the last
quarter and Harvard only got home a
length and a quarter in front of them.
The three leading crews had almost got
their shells in tow when Columbia came
struggling home one minute and fifty-four
seconds after Cornell and Pennsylvania.
The official time was returned as fol
lows: Cornell, 19:32; Pennsylvania, 20:11.
This time, if correct, establishes a new
American record, as the best previous
time was 20:10, by Yale, at New London.
There is a serious discrepancy some
where. In the official time as givon from
the referees three and a naif seconds are
generally allotted to a length, and the
Cornell crew defeated Harvard by fully
four lenghts, or, roughly speaking, by
fourteen seconds, whereas the difference
in time shows a defeat for Harvard by
three seconds, or, say, three-quarters of a
length.
None of the timers or the referee could
be found up to a late hour to-night, so that
it was impossible to find out how the mat
ter will be managed.
Tne Columbia men were pretty well
done up, but there were no serious col
lapses. Pennsylvania finished the fresh
est of them-HETI. The Cornell boys owned
the town to-night. Street parades
were formed, giant firecrackers exploded
and the cry, "Cornell! I yell, I yelJ, Cor
nell!" mingled with cheers for the Har
vard crew, made sleep imoossible.
ENRAGED BALL PLAYERS.
They Attempt to Mob an Umpire Because
He Called a Game.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., June 26.â T0-day's game
between Louisville and Cleveland was a dis
grace from start to finish, and lasted three
hours and twenty minutes. The players of
both teams made a football of Umpire Weid
man, and engaged in fights between them
selves. Burkett's home run in the ninth in
ning tied the score. It was almost dark, end
Louisville did not try to play, going out one,
two, three. In the tenth, Cleveland scored
four runs on an error, a single and home
runs by McAleer and McGarr. Louisville got
three meu on the bases when Weidman called
the game on account of darkness. This so en
raged the Cleveland players that they made for
the umpire in a bunch. McAleer struck him
on the jaw. Then the crowd in the bleachers,
armed with sticks and beer glasses, made for
the diamond, but the police managed to drive
them away. Score: Clevelandsâ 4, 9, 0; Louis

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 26.â The locals
defeated the champions rather easily this
afternoon. Notwithstanding that rain fell be
fore and during the game, 7384 spectators
were present. Maul pitched the first inning
for Washington and then retired because of
difficulty in handling the wet ball. King, who
succeeded him did sp'endid work, and would
have kept his opponents' score down to one
run but for errors. Joyce's work was first
class. McMahon was wild and ineffective.

BROOKLYN, N. V., June 26.â The Brooklyns
again beat the New Y'orks to-day, winning the

parent hits with men on bases. Jones' sticK
work and the fielding of Uaiy and Connough

CHICAGO, 111., June 26.â Hawley was easy

A SNEAK FOR LIBERTY,
George Brighton, a Burglar, Tries
to Escape in a Court
room.
Judge Wallace Sentenced a Robber to
Twenty Years in State's
Prison.
There was great excitement in Judge
Wallace's court for a few moments yes
terday morning. Sixteen prisoners were
in the dock awaiting the pleasure of the
court, but when Bailiff P^ J. Curtis
counted noses as they filed out, try as he
would he could find but fifteen of his
charges present.
It was at first thought that one of the
men had been taken to another court, but
an examination of the books showed that
all should be present in Department 6.
The fifteen remaining malefactors were
marched to the prison van, when it was
discovered that the missing man was
George Brighton, who is charged with an
attempt to commit burglary.
After a thorough search of the court
room Brighten, who is a small man, was
found stowed away under a bench in the
far corner of the railed inclosure in which
the prisoners are confined. His intention
evidently was to remain there if his ab
sence was unnoticed until the noon recess,
and then slip away unobserved.
Judge Wallace sentenced two of the six
teen men to terms in State's prison.
Harry Church, who while in a crowd of
intoxicated men snatched a watch of S. H.
Smith and ran away with it, was given a
twenty-year sentence for robbery.
James Buckley, convicted of burglary,
got two and a half years in Folsom.
THREE CARNIVAL COLORS
Cardinal, Blue and Gold Are Formally
Adopted to Brighten the Coming
Festival.
Blue, gold and cardinal were last night
formally adopted as the colors for the car
nival of the Golden Gate. Distinguishing
designs for the various committees were
also adopted. Each design will be placed
upon a strip of ribbon representing the
three colors. The executive committee
will be represented by a five-pointed star;
golden for the chairman and silver for the
other members of the committee. Cornu
copias of gold and silver will distinguish
the finance committee and crossed
muskets military parade; miniature yacht
will be the emblem of the committee on
naval display, flaming torch for the com
mittee on illumination ana decoration,
crossed flags for tribunes and grand stands,
harp for committee on music, scale of
justice for committee on awards of prizes,
clasped hands for committee on invita
tion and reception; a bear will distinguish
the committee for California day, crossed
pens the committee on literary exercises
and the strong arm athletic sports. v^
The chairman of these sub-committees
will wear a design representing his com
mittee, supported by a small gold star.
A small silver star underneath the design
will distinguish whether the member is
also a member of the executive committee.
Special badges for the press will be de
signed by the corresponding secretary,
and will be divided into two classesâ
class for those actually engaged in the
work of the carnival and the other for vis
iting and local newspaper men.
The carnival buttons, which will be pre
pared during the coming week and placed
on sale, will bear the words "Golden Gate,
1896," on the center, and will be about the
size of a quarter of a dollar.
The question of regalia was also dis
cussed. Marshals of divisions will wear
sashes of blue, gold and cardinal, and aids
will wear a sash of one color. , No less
than three aids will be appointed to each
division.
W. D. Harper, manager of the Em
porium, stated that that building will be
illuminated in the carnival colors from
ton to bottom.
At tha final wind-ut) of the ; carnival . a
grand ball will be given at the Mechanics'
Pavilion, and all the participants will be
expected to appear in costumes made in
the carnival colors.

MEET PORTLAND
ATHLETES TO-DAY,
Olympics Are Handicapped
by the Loss of Phil
Wand.
INJURED IN A TUSSLE.
His Collarbone Broken While
Competing With Wrestler
Krelling.
CAPTAIN GILL CONFIDENT.
Believes His Men Will Win, Though
but Six Will Enter the
Lists.
PORTLAND, Ob.. June 26.â N0 event
in the field of athletic sport has attracted
such general attention as the champion
ship contests to-morrow between the
Multnornah Club of Portland and the
Olympics of San Francisco. It is a coming
together for the first time of the athletes of
the north and south on the Pacific Coast.
The programme nas not been arranged to
suit all yet. Chairman Goldsmith of the
Multnomah athletic committee, Captain
Gill and Captain Fuller have had several
conferences over tne arrangement of
the events, and to-day and to-night at the
clubhouse the officials are fixing up the
programme and selecting the presiding of
ficials for the contests.
Since their arrival the Olympic boys
have been faithfully training on the track
every afternoon. They have been as
signed quarters in the fieldhouse for
their exclusive use, and from the manner
in which their wants are looked after the
California visitors cannot but fe^l grate
ful. In the two camps of the friendly ene
mies there is but one subject, and that re
lates to the winners that are picked for
the particular events in which they are
entered.
Captain Fuller of thp Multnomahs has
been reluctant to show his hand, and there
is a suspicion that he may hold all trumps.
His team is in the pink of condition, and
when Trainer John King is asked "What
do yon guess?" he smiles iv that peculiar
fashion that makes conversation super
fluous.
There was a little discouragement in the
Olympic crowd to-day. Owing to a most
unfortunate accident one of their best men
has been disabled, so that he will not be
counted on in to-morrow's games. This is
a serious crippling of Captain Gill's team.
The disabled man is Phil Wand, the
sprinter. Last evening he and Kreling,
the wrestler, indulged in a grappling
match for practice. Wand was thrown
hard, and in the tussle his ? houlder was
dislocated. It will be impossible for him
to make his appearance with the team to
morrow. Captain Gill said this morning
that it practically left him but six men to
work for the victories in the thirteen
I events. Still they will do the best they
cnn. Wand was counted upon as one of
the standbys of the visiting team.
The events constituting the programme
for the afternoon are as follows: 100-yard
dash, 220-yard dash, 120-yard hurdle, 220
--yard hurdle, high jump, broad jump, pole
vault, 440-yard run, half mile run, one
mile run, 16-pound-hammer throw, 16
--pound-shot put, 50-pound-weight tossing.
Regarding the chances of the Multno
mah Club there are two disappointments.
L. J. Brazee is not in condition for the
jumps or the vauits; he is not in shape to
enter the lists. Another good man of
whom much cannot be expected to-mor
row is Frank Coyne, who has already
demonstrated promising powers in tbe
sprints. Trainer King says that although
Coyne will be in the lists too much can
not be expected of him because he is not at
all in condition. The rest of the men of
both teams are in fine shape.

J&cGUncy Property.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 26.â M. T. Brewer,
guardian of Percy Osborne Brewer, as the
sole survivor of the McGlincy murder is
now known, was this morning appointed
administrator of the estate of James K.
Wells, son of Mrs. R. P. McGlincy, and
one of Dunham's victims.
Issuance of letters on the estate was con
tested by Public Administrator Secord.
The question at issue was whether Wells
or his mother, Mrs. McGlincy. was killed
first. If Wells was killed rirst Mrs. Mc-
Glincy's relatives would come in tor a
share of the property, and the child would
get its mother's share only; but if Wells
survived its mother the child was the sole
heir.
Judge Reynolds decided that the evi
dence at the Coroner's inquest was that
Mrs. McGlincy was killed several hours
before her son, and that the baby was the
sole heir. Brewer's bond was placed at
$3500. _

Nora Coffey Stole to Get Money to Bay
the Drag:.
For some time past the people in the
Burlington Hotel, on Second and Market
streets, have been missing articles of bed
clothing and a close watch was kept on the
rooms. Yesterday a Chinese servant dis
covered a strange woman in one of the
rooms on the third floor, who was folding
up a spread. Officer P. J. O'Donnell was
sent for and when the woman saw that
she was trapped with the evidence of her
guilt she ran down the hall and jumped
through a window into the light well. She
landed heavily on a protecting wire screen
that is over the entire space on the first
floor. The woman was removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where she gave the
name of Nora Coffey. She is addicted to
the use of morphine and it was to obtain
the drug that she stole the clothes. She
said she lived at the Second-street House.
An examination of the injuries showed
that she had sustained a badly fractured
leg.

GLENDALE MINER
SADLY MANGLED,
Pitiful Result of Andrew
Benson's Loyalty to His
Employer.
TORN BY AN EXPLOSION.
Premature Discharge of a Salute
on the Birthday of a Mine
Superintendent
LOSES BOTH ARMS AND AN EYE
His Body Denuded and Shockingly
Bruised, but Doctors Say He
Will Live.
PORTLAND, Oe., June 26.â Andrew !
Kenson, a miner, was horribly mangled at
Glendale, a small mining camp on the
Southern Pacific Railroad, last night.
Yesterday was the birthday of Colonel
Taylor, superintendent of the Victory
mine, and Benson proposed to discharge
several shots of giant powder as a salute
in honor of the occasion. The other men
demurred, fearing that Colonel Taylor
would not appreciate the demonstration.
Benson insisted, however, and pro
curing the cartridges, caps and
fuse started off alone for the sta
tion. Thirty minutes later Benson's
mangled body was picked up near the rail
road track by trainbands and the man the
unfortunate miner had intended to salute.
The giant powder had exploded pre
maturely. Benson was covered with blood
and blackened by powder, smoke and
dust. Both of his arms were blown off
above the wrists, his right eye was hang
ing from its socket, and his body, stripped
of clothing by the force of the explosion,
was dotted by small wounds.
On an improvised litter the wounded
man was carried to the Victory mine and
a surgeon was summoned from Roseburg,
twelve miles distant. On his arrival he
amputated Benson's arms and removed
his right eye, and after making the pa
tient as comfortable as possible gave orders
that he be brought to the Good Samaritan
Hospital in Portland.
Benson arrived on this morning's train,
his wounds being redressed by the hospi
tal surgeons, who gave every promise of
the miner's ultimate recovery.
PORTLAND MILLS BURNED
Fire Destroys Property on the
North Side Valued at
$300,000.
Two Hundred Workingmen Are
Thrown Out of Employment by
the Conflagration.
PORTLA>D, Or., June 26.â A nrebroke I
out in the engine-power room of Weidler's i
lumbering-mills in the north part of the â 
city this afternoon. It started in a hot i
box, and in five minutes the structure j
was a mass of flames. The entire fire de- |
partment from the East and West sides '
was summoned, but nothing was saved |
beyond the finishing-shed, the office build
ing and 3,000,000 feet of lumber lying west
of the railway track. The loss is $300,000.
When the fire first got under full head
way a light westerly breeze was stirring,
thus threatening the entire north part of
the city. Fortunately in a few minutes
the wind veered about, arresting an in
calculably disastrous fire.
Immediately after the alarm was
Bounded four employes of the mill were
forced to leap from the roof of the burn
ing mill into the river to escape being
burned to death. One of them. Ben Ervine,
was seriously injured about the head and
face by falling timbers.
A half hour later Carson's large planing
mill was swept away; not a vestige of it
remains standing. It is estimated there is
not more than $60,000 insurance to cover
the whole loss. The fire throws out of em
ployment 200 men whose monthly pay
amounted to $10,000.
The Weidler mill was built in 1872 by
the late Ben Holliday as an adjunct to the
Oregon and California Railroad, which he
at that time controlled. For the past three
years it has been in the hands of a re
ceiver.

Attorney B. F. Roth made the speech of
the evening, and soon had the audience
in an enthusiastic mood and the best of
humor. Mrs. Merritt asked for a rising
vote on the question of equal suffrage, and
when the "ayes" had responded chal
lenged any man on the negative side to
arise and give a reason why woman should
not have the ballot. No one accepted the
invitation.

I every flag and naval trapping to be found
i aboard. Punch, ices, delicate cakes,
sandwiches and other light delicacies

ROBBERS' PLOT,
Destruction of Big Blocks
Planned by Tunneling
Cracksmen.
MEANT DEATH TO MANY.
Business Houses to Have Been
Blown Up to Conceal Their
Crime.
POLICE FORCE IS CENSURED.
Knew of the Intended Raid Weeks
Ago, but Allowed the Gang to
Escape.
LOS ANGELES, Cal,, June 26.â The
sensation of the hour here is the discovery
of the bold attempt by safe-crackers to
plunder the -money vaults of the First
National Bank by tunneling to them from
the cellar of a neighboring room. In
making public their find of a few days
ago the authorities have brought upon
their own heads a torrent of censure from
citizens, who accuse the police and detec
tive forces of incompeteucy for having
allowed the tunnelers to escape after
learning that they were at work. The
officials are consoling themselves in the
knowledge that they have suspect
Stephens under arrest, but few believe
Stephens belonged to the gang. Stephens
is being closely guarded by tha police,
who will not permit him to talk to any
one save his lawyer.
These desperadoes not only contem
plated the robbery of the bank, but in
tended to conceal all traces of the burglary,
it is now believed, by blowing up the build
ings in that vicinity. They had thirty
one sticks of giant powder, three boxes of
percussion caps and 200 feet of fuse. It
was their purpose, had they succeeded in
looting the vaults, to lay the fuse and then
touch it off, which would have demolished
the entire block and certainly caused the
death of many people.
In the opinion of some of the shrewdest
detectives, the escaped robbers are part of
the notorious "Jimmy" Hope's gang cf
bank-robbers.
Captain Harris say& he warned Presi
dent Elliott four weeks ago that an at
tempt would be made to rob his bank.
Now the wonder is why the tunnelers got
away, when the local sleuths, as they
claim, "knew all about it weeks ago."
The Express to-night, commenting on the
alleged incompetency of the police, says:
The bungling and clumsy efforts of the
police and detectives particularly were topics
of conversation about town to-day. Some of
the officials pronounce their coarse and ama
teur work as the very embodiment of incom
petency and imbecility. By their own state
ments it appears that the officers did not try
to effect an arrest until long after the burg
lars had got away, and then when they bad
failed they placed the blame on others. The
fact of an attempted robbery and burglary
was known to the Express ten days ago, and
only at the earnest solicitation of officials was
the story kept secret In order that some of the
culprits might be captured.
District Attorney Donnell said to-day:
"If what is published in the morning
papers is all that the police claim to know
aoout the matter all 1 have to say is that
they know about one-fifth of the facts."
According to reliable information five
men were implicated in the scheme, some
of whom are well known to the Sheriff's
office. A Deputy Sheiiff met one of the
ringleaders, who is well known to him,
about ten days ago and held a conversa
tion with him.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 26.â Miss
Ellen Beach Yaw, the young woman with
the highest voice tones in the world, has
returned to this city. Miss Yaw left here
some years ago to study and has met with
phenomenal success. Her high tones go
up an octave higher than those of Patti
and her voice is of notable sweetness.
Miss Yaw spoke of the training of her
wonderful voice, saying that her highest
tones were not cultivated by any special
method or master, and that in the devel
oping of her medium tones the highest
came with ease. Constant and faithful
study and practice is her motto. When
asked as to her appearing here she said :
"I have as yet set no time for an appear
ance here, being at home for a vacation
and rest. My studying since leaving here
has been done in Boston, New York, Paris
and London. I have not been home for
four years."

LOS ANGE.LES, Cal., June 26.â The

troller to audit the warrant oi Lewis, who
has been, since June, 1896, expert for the
State Board of Examiners on a salary of
$2000 a year and traveling expenses. The
Controller refused to issue a warrant for
Lewis' salary, on the ground that the Jaw

SAN BERNARDINO'S MISTERY.
Futile Search for the liody of Missing
C. A. Wingfield.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., June 26.â
That C. A. Wingrield is dead seems certain
now. Judge Otis, in whose mines Wing
field had recently been working, has re
ceived a letter which indicates that Wing
field had determined to end his earthly
existence.
After some directions about business
affairs Wingfield penned the sentence, "I
intend to cross the Styx this even
ing." In another portion of the letter
Wingfield wrote: "It may b* a long time
before my remains are found." In a note
to the landlord of the hotel where he had
been stopping he wrote : "I intend to cross
the great divide this evening."
The last seen of Wingfield was when he
got off the Harlem motor. Yesterday and
to-day parties have been out searching the
foothills and the wash of th* Santa^Ana
Rver, but Wingneld's body has not been
found.
Wingfield was a native of England. He
came to Sao Bernardino several years ago
and was reputed to be wealthy. He in
vested largely in real estate and built the
motor line to Harlem Springs. All his in
vestments proved unprofitable. For a
time he received remittances from Eng
land, but they ceased some months ago.
Wingfield was a man 1 of education and
personally popular with everybody.
SEATTLE MAN'S DISCOVERY.
Nitro-Glycerine Fired From a Cannon
Without Danger to the
Gunners.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 28.â The Chi
nese Government, through its San Fran
cisco Consul, is investigating a new ex
plosive invented by ex-Police Commis
sioner Manning of this city.
ManninÂ» claims he has a process where
by nitro-glycerine may be fired from a
cannon without danger to those doing the
firing. He asserts that he has fired nitro
glycerine from a shotgun at three stumps,
and that the stumps were demolished py
the explosion. Nitro-glvcerine can be dis
charged through the medium of a cannon
with proportionately greater results.
Senator Squire recently brought the
matter to the attention of the United
States Government, and the Chinese Gov
ernment has authorized Ching Gee Hea of
Seattle to deal with Manning.

PACIFIC GROVE'S GUESTS
Women of the Summer School
Discuss the Growth of
Crime.
Planning Methods to Protect the Home
From the Sec urge of Vicious
Influences.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., June 26.â The
school of methods of the Woman's Chris
tian Temperance Union held an afternoon
session, at which an able address on
"Penology" was delivered by Mrs. A. B.
Gove of Oakland. She gave some alarm
ing statistics of crime taken from the
United States Census Bureau, showing
that while in 1850 there was one prisoner
to 3000 people, there was now one prisoner
to every 500, not to speak of the criminal
element not incarcerated, which is a con
tinual menace to society.
The prisons, she said, were filled with
young men, not always from the slums,
but often from good families, who have
fallen first into bad company, then into
bad habits, and then into crime and the
prisons. The question was: Whose boys
should fill the prisons? Saloons, brew
eries and distilleries were multiplying.
These were the mills which manufactured
criminals. What should be done with
these mills?
Many young men were drawn into crime
through the low standard of social purity
that prevailed, and some through ienor
ance. It was a grave question, What
should be done for these young men?
Wnat care should be given the convicted
prisoner? What should be done with the
discharged criminals? What could be
done for women convicts when dis
charged? The difficulties in the way of
their reform were discussed and many
practical suggestions made.
A symposium on press work was given,
bringing out much of interest. One speaker
advanced the thought that we were all
responsible for the influence of the papers
we paid for.
One woman told of having stopped
a morning paper in her family be
cause of its attitude on reform measures,
and invested the cost of it in reform pa
pers and periodicals instead. The value
of the printed page was duly enlarged
upon and full credit given to the effect of
newspapers which had been friendly to
reforms.
Miss Severance delivered a popular
lecture to-night.
A reception will be given to the women
in attendance at the school of methods at
El Carmelo Hotel to-morrow evening.
Many strangers from all parts of the
country are here.
HAS MOT LIVED IN PASADENA.
Butcher Dunham of Campbells Not the
Bigamist of Four Years
Ago,
PASADENA, Cal., June 26.â N0 cre
dence is given the report sent from Pasa
dena to the effect that James C. Dunham,
the Campbells butcher, was once a resi
dent of this city. The statement that Dun
ham is the man who married Pearl Bal
lard here four years ago and was found to
have been a bigamist when he deserted
her scon afterward, is denied by M. 8.
Ballard, a brother of the deserted woman.
John C. Dunham was the bigami>t's
name. When the county was startled by
the news of the Campbells murder. Mr.
Ballard, noting the similarity of names,
sent for pictures of the butcher. When
they arrived he was at once enabled to
state positively that the Campbells Dun
ham was not the one who wronged his
sisier.
RUTING OWN PLAN MINES.

boo, Country.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 26.â Former
British West Australian investors are send
ing millions of dollars to British Columbia
for investment. They are tumbling over
one another to get the best propositions.
Yesterday a mine in Yale, assaying not
much over $3 to the ton, was sold to the
West Australia Mining Company of Lon
don, Eng.. for $100,000, and $100,000 was
offered for the .Lillooet mine, near Van
couver, that had been bought a month
before for $30,000.
In the past month hundreds of thou
sands of English pounds have gone into
the historic Cariboo. The Britishers will
not look at claims unless big prices are
asked ior them. Tney will then taki them
or leave them alone, according to the ad
vice of their experts, who receive as a
reward for being honest a salary aa high
as $100 a day.

MAGUIRE FOE THE DEMOCRATS
Cator Represents Populismâ Brilliant
Ladies in E oquent and Pointed
Addresses.
At the ratification meeting last night of
the woman's suffrage plank for the State
constitution Metropolitan Temple was
crowded even into the aisles. The faces
rose in terraces to the ceiling. All were
interesting and interested, and being
mostly women, were, of course, handsome.
Men were also very largely in evidence
and they were interested, too. There were
plenty of flowers and color, and more
enthusiasm.
The twentieth century woman is rapidly
acquiring political ways. She knows how
to apDlaud, and the meeting last night
proved that she is also learning the cam
paign yell.
All eyes were turned to the stage. There
sat the president of the meetm?, the ven
erable and revered Susan B. Anthony, and
upon her right hand and upon her left
were other wo man suffrage leaders of Na
tional and State reputation.
Among others on the ptatform, in addi
tion to the speakers, were Mr. and Mrs.
James Kennedy, Mr. and Mrs. H. S. Ken
nedy, Mr. and Mrs. Aylett, Mr, and Mrs.
8. W. Holladay, Major and Mrs. Grosbeck,
Captain and Mrs. Krebs, K. J. Wiilatts,
Miss Korris, Mrs. Norton, Judge and
Mrs. Murphy, Miss Mary Crowley,
Mrs. Nellie L. Scoville, Jolin Jay Scoville,
Charles H. tJlinn, George T. .Bromley,
Mrs. T. V. Cator, A. T >V. Thompson, Carle
ton H.Johnson, Mrs. Arthur D. Thomson,
A. B. Kinne, E. M. Wardail, Mr. and
Mrs. George D. Gillespie, Mr. and Mrs.
Aylett R. Cotton, Mrs. E. 0. Smith, Major
Kyle Frank McGovern, E<i Kingsley, Gen
eral and Mrs. W. S. Green. Mrs. Ida 0. Haz
lett of Colorado, Addie L. Ballou, presi
dent of the Woman's State Republican
Club; and Elizabeth Sloper.
Mrs. Sargent, president of the State
Woman's Suffrage Association, called the
meeting to order, congratulated tne audi
ence on its large numbers and introduced
Miss Anthony, president of the National
Woman's Suffrage Association, as the
president of the occasion. Mis^s Anthony
said she accepted the chairmanship of so
grand a meeting and occasion with pleas
ure.
She said that never in its history had
the outlook of the cause of woman's suf
frage been so full of promise, in ever be
fore were woman-suffrage planks in the
platforms of all the parties. She irave the
Republican party credit for being the first
to indorse it, and that meant that the
party would work for it.
Then she thanked in turn the People's
and Pronibition parties of the State. She
said even the action of the Democratic
party was a long step forward. "We have
had resolutions fail in many other States,"
she said, "but we have the great State of
California with us. So we have asked you
to meet and rejoice with us to-night." "
Miss Anthony was roundly applauded,
and so were all the speakers.
The audi nee arose to its feet and joined
in the singing of "America," led by the
creat pipe organ.
Miss Anthony introduced as the next
speaker the Rev. W. R. Goodwin as the
representative of the Prohibition party.
He said that par y was the first to indorse
woman's suffrage.
"New converts see which way the tide
is running, and they are coming along
with it. They must do so if they want
the offices," be said, indulging in a little
pleasantry. "All the old parties will be
courting the women as well as the Irish
and the Germans, for their votes. The
victory for woman's suffrage is sure to
come. We who are young expect to live
till we see on the statutes of every State a
law declaring that a woman is as good as
a man."
Miss Mollie Connor, editor of an Oak
land paper, in a short address said that
the new plank for the constitution meant
the introduction of a new element in the
government of the State. The American
woman was about to play ncr just part in
life.
"It is the women of the West who ought
to begin this movement. We are espe
cially fond of the men of our own State,
and particularly of native sons. How can
the West be helped in the hard times?"
s.e inquired. "Let the men put in their
platform equality fur women. A man to
make his home and business more pros
perous must make his nation prosperous.
Let ua try a new policy, even if ii is the
silver policy; but above all let us have the
influence of women in KOvernment. "
E. L. Kingsley, for the socialistic labor
party, said in an energetic speech that
since its beginning that party has had
woman's suffrage. One of its cardinal
principles was equality. "We demand
equal rights for all and special privileges
for none," he said, "and that is why we
demand the ballot for woman."
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, president of the
Campaign Association, said:
"Many gentleman friends have asked
me why I have taken up woman's suf
frage. Because the logic of my experience
has shown here that I* cannot do my dnty
to this commonwealth unless I have the
ballot."
Miss Mabel Holbrook here entertained
the audience with a violin solo.
Thomas V. Cator spote for the Popu
lists. "I am for woman's suffrage," he
said. "Woman should have a voice in the
land. The woman has the same oppor
tunity to form public opinion that man
has, and as laws are but public opinions
she should be given ber full opportunity
in making them. The grand ideal, the
divine ideal, will be quicker realized with
the equal ri hts of the sexes, and to that
declaration do I stand forever faithful."
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn, referring to
their National president, said that, like
Grant, she would fight it out, if it took all
summer, for enfranchisement of women.
"When I say tnat we shall achieve a vic
tory in November, I mean that we shall if
the men of the old parties stand by the
platforms of their parties, all of which
have indorsed equal enfranchisement,
with one exception."
In introducing Charles M. Shortridge
Miss Anthony said: "The Call speaks for
all, and, of course, for women." His
speech was well received and frequently
interrupted by applause. Mr. Shortridge
spoke substantially as follows:
"What is more natural than that the
Republican party should once more de
clare for lioerty? It was the first to de
clare ior liberty, it was born fighting for
lioerty, and, ray friends, lam proud it is
my privilege to stand before you in favor
of the principle of woman's right to vote.
"I am not insensible of the fact," he con
tinued, "that lam here to speak for my
party â that party which I followed long
before I even knew why, with my father
in Indiana and lowa, when he was making
a campaign for Lincoln. It was there I
had the privilege with a baby's hand to
call a meeting to order while my father
pleaded for liberty, for that saint and
martyr, the liberator of a million slaves,
Abraham Lincoln. I have followed it ever
since.
"I appear here to-night," Mr. Short
ridge said, "to pledge the Republican
party, so far as my voice and influence go,
in favor of woman's suffrage. It has been
said of me that I was the first to declare
for this movement in a great metropolitan
newspaper. Ido not claim any credit for
that. It was high time that some news
paper came out for it. It was not done
to popularize my newspaper. I have
heard that it has been said it would not De
popular, but it has been popular. If the
Republican party did not declare for it as
a iiiaHer of principle, and not to catch
votes, I would not be here to spe^k for it.
"The Democratic party," he declared,
"absolutely disgraced itself when it re
fused to allow the debate of woman's suf
fiage on the floor of the State Convention.'
The speaker paid a tribute to Judge Ma
guire on his fidelity to the cause of women,
and said fie was unpurchased and unpur
chasablc in his stand for the cause in and
outsiie the Democratic convention. The
only fault he could find with Maguire was
that he is a Democrat.
Continuing, he said : "My friends, we
want to carry this campaign. I want my
mother, wife and sister to have votes,"
and he facetiously added that he might
have three votes in the coming
election. " I indorse the move
ment in the interest of purity
and of liberty of conscience. Every church
in California should make it its business to
have meetings in favor of woman's suf
frage. I believe that the Methodist Gen
eral Conference finally voted to admit
women. Few women were there, and they
declined to vote. It is high time all the
churches madÂ« this their cause. The
church of California should take up this
question. I appeal to the great church
element of California, and I have a right
to â to stand up for the constitutional
amendment in favor of women.
"I am proud oi being in this fight," he
went on, "for no other reason man that j
sister of mine who practices in the Su- j
prenie Court of this Stateâ to grant to her â¢
all the privileges I have. You are deny- j
ing her a right which she is entitled to.
"I believe the people of the State of Cali
fpmU will carry this amendment," Mr. j
Shortridge said. "In the name of this j
great State, which is great in everything, !
and should be greater in morals, I pledge
â¢you I will stand by you to success or
defeat."
Amid the prolonged applause that fol
lowed Mr. Shortridge was presented with j
a large bouquet of California blossoms.
Miss Elizabeth Yates of Maine, who has
spoken in fifty out of the fifty-seven coun
ties of this State, said that conservative
Eastern colleges are opening their doors to
women. "The Democratic party is a little
old-fashioned," she said, "but there are
men in it of mind and thought, and our
Democratic friends will save the day if it
is a close election, but it is not going to he
a close election. We shall have 60,000
majority." She received a bouquet.
Hon. James G. Maguire spoke as a '
Democrat. He congratulated the woman's
suffrage movement on the grand demon
stration and meeting of the evening. "I !
reerret I am not here to speak for the Dem
ocratic party, but I am here to speak
as a Democrat, because I believe
in its principles. The convention deemed
the woman's suffrage plank inexpedient,
but a good body of Democrats will do their
duty on the amendment. No man or
woman has a right to rule another â they
are equal. There is no denying that the
principle of the ballot for man applies
equally to woman. I shall support amend
ment No. XI. Experience proves its ex
pediency. I believe your cause will tri
umph."
Senator McGowan of Humboldt County
made an excellent speech, in which he
said with woman's suffrage the State
would have better institutions and better
laws.
Rev. Anna Shaw received an ovation
when she was introduced. She addressed
the ladies present as "fellow-ciiizens." She
saiil that if there was any significance in
smiles they would have the Democratic
women on their side in November.'

tered, had not appeared.
No one could explain it. Mr. Delmas,
who had taken his place at the table for
the first time in this proceeding as the I
leading counsel for the witness, shook his
head â he did not know. W. W. Foote
said be had just come from Oakland, had
not seen Mrs. Craven since the court ad
journed the evening before, and he did
not know.
The court grew impatient â demanded
that the business proceed.
George A. Knight said "No; this witness
is the soul of the proceeding. I want to
examine her at length. I prefer an ad
journment rather than the intervening of
any other witness."
He sat down and there ensued an awk
ward pause, which was broken into by the
unannounced entrance of the witness her- |
self. The crowd made way for her, and j
as she came through the gate from, the
lobby it became quite apparent why she
had kept the court waiting. She was very
pale. Just behind her came her daughter
Margaret and her constant friend, Mrs.
Haskins.
They took the seats reserved for them
near their counsel. There was a brief con
sultation, and then Mr. Foote rose and
explained that Mrs. Craven, on her way to
the courtroom, had become so ill that she
was taken to her physician. Mr. Foote
held and read a certificate from him stat
ing that Mrs. Craven was suffering from
an ailment such as would endanger her
life were she subjected to the excitement
incident to an examination upon the wit
ness-stand.
With this little speech the hopes of the
crowd for some repetition of the sensa
tional scenes of the night before died out.
Mr. Knight said, "We will abide by the
judgment of the court"
Mr. Delmas said, "There is no court
sitting here."
To this thrust no answer was made.
Mr. Knight called for the production of
the deeds recorded by Mrs. Craven, and
they were promptly produced â the deeds
to the Pine and Mission street property
already described. The deeds are written
in lead pencil.
Af+er an inspection by the attorneys for
the Fair children Mr. Knight asked that
the court take charge of them.
The court had no desire to assume the j
responsibility and, besides, the attorneys
for Mrs. Craven objected to having the
papers taken out of their possession. '
They promised to have them ready upon
any proper demand for inspection and the
matter was allowed to stand at that.
A call was made for the marriage con
tract also. Mr. Foote said he had advised
the lady to send for that to her friends in
lowa and she would do so.
â¢'And the letters?" insisted Knight.
"They will be forthcomingâ all the
papers will. 1 speak for myself," said
Foote. "Mr. Delmas is nowhere. He can
answer for them finally."
"Every letter and paper purporting to
be written by the hand of James G. Fair
now in the possession or under control of
Mr 3. Craven will be produced here. We
have no reservations."
This was said in such quietly convinc
ing fashion that questioning ceased.
Then the cipher - book promised the
night before was called for and Margaret
Craven passed it over. George R. Williams
went on the stand and identified the little
red leather-covered book as containing a
cipher which has been used between him
self and Mrs. Craven fcrr communicating
on business matters by wire for the past j
eight years. He also produced a number of
the telegrams and was in the course of
translating them, when Mr. Delmas rose
up, placed his left elbow on the railing of
the clerk's desk, and remarked:
"This is the taking of testimony in the
contest of a will of James G. Fair, your
Honor. What have these telegrams to do
with it? Any communications from or
anything Mrs. Craven might say is hear
say."
Mr. Knight admitted that it was not the
time or place and suspended. Mr. Williams
promised to take good care of the copy
and his book, and have it when wanted.
With that the proceedings came to an end.
An adjournment was taken untii next
Friday morning.
But another embarrassing complication
for Mr?. Craven made its entry into tne
situation yesterday. The Grand Jury took
steps directed at the expulsion of Mrs.
Craven from the School Department. She
is now and has long been principal of the
Mission Grammar School.
School Director Scott will urge her dis
missal on the same grounds as does the
Grand Jury â that of the marriage contract
and its having been until now kept secret.
Mrs. Craven was apprised of this move
last night, and she said that so far from
giving way before it she will fight it to the
end.
Mr. Delmas, the senior counsel for Mrs.
Craven, will give his personal attention to
the case from this time. He has been pre
vented from doing so by the Parker will
case at San Jose, which has occupied his
time for six weeks past. In an interview
last evening Mr. Delmas said :
"There will no evasion of any issue in
this matter of Mrs. Craven's. I have ad
vised her to have no reservations. She
will tell all that the conditions demand
that she should tell as to her relations
with Mr. Fair. S!ie will produce the mar
riage contract and her letters and all other
papers that she may have in his hand
writing and tell all that there is to tell
about them.
"Stress is laid upon the repeated decla
ration that these circumstances are pe
culiar. Well, they are. Mrs. Craven says
that the manner in which the ink will
was taken from her at Chicago by a man
who she supposed came from her friends
was most peculiar.
"But so she says was the manner in
which the trust will was stolen from the
office of the County Clerk. That she says
was also most peculiar â the one no more

so than the other. For her part, she will,
she says, tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."
The deeds were photographed at the in-,
stance of Mr. Delmas yesterday and the
opposing counsel will be furnished with
a copy of them.
SpeaKing of the marriage contract yes
terday, Charles J. Heggerty of the counsel
for Charles D. Fair said: "It is not worth
the paper it is written on. The first neces
sary element to make such a contract
valid is publicity. The point was empha
sized by the Supreme Court in the Sharon
case. It was laid down as a principle that
a mere intention was not sufficient. The
! abode of one must be the abode of the
other; they must have been known pub
licly as man and wife. The secrecy
that Mrs. Craven-Fair declares was ob
served in their caseâ insisted upon, she
says, by Senator Fair â nullifies the con
tract in the eyes of the law."
It was 7:35 o'clock, five minutes past the
hour set, when Judge Slack last night
asked if counsel were ready to proceed in
the Craven-Fair will case.
Attorney Collins arose and addressed
the court, bf.geing his Honor's indulgence
for Mr. Knigat, who, he said, would be
present in a few moments.
On the bench with Judge Slack sat
Judge Bridgeford of Colusa.
At 7:40 o'clock Knight, with an apology
on his lips as he advanced, took his seat.
He was sorry, he said, to have kept the
court waiting, and was duly excused.
Mrs. Craven-Fair was called to take
the stand, but she was absent. The court
asked if some other witnesses could not
be put on, but Knight objected, saying he
had reasons for wishing to go on with the
testimony of Mrs. Fair at this time. An
other wait, marked with impatience on
the face of counsel and spectators alike,
ensued.
After allowing another ten minutes to
go by, Judge Slack again suggested that
some other witness be examined, but
Knight declared he would rather take an
adjournment than break the continuity of
Mrs. Craven-Fair's testimony.
On the Judge remarking that there was
possibly some misunderstanding on the
part of the absent witness, VV. W. Foote
stated that he had just come over from
Oakland, and had not seen Mrs. Craven-
Fair yesterday, but that the understand
ing at adjournment on Thursday night
was that the witness should be in court at
7:30 o'clock last night.
At this juncture Mrs. Craven-Fair, ac
companied by her daughter and Mrs.
Haskins, entered. A paper was handed
Mr. Foote, and be stated to the court that
it was a doctor's certificate, to the effect
that Mrs. Fair was suffering from an ail
ment which would endanger her life if she
were compelled to undergo the strain of
being subjected to an examination.
Judee Slack then asked if the documents
askedlor had been brought into court, and
Mr. Foote informed the court that they
were not in the City, but had been sent for
and would be here and be produced in
court in due time.
Here D. M. Delma > arose and declared,
"There is no court here."
But his challenge to the Judge who pre
sided over the court was allowed to go by
unnoticed.
A demand for the deeds filed last week
by Mrs. Fair's attorney was made by the
court, but while the opposing counsel
were permitted to inspect them for about
ten minutes Delmas and Foote objected to
their being placed in evidence and in cus
tody of the court. Photographic copies of
them, however, were promised for the
next sitting of the court.
Judge Slack suggested that when an ad
journment wastaTken the case go over until
the latter part of next week, so as to per
mit of day sessions being held. There was
a consultation amone the counsel and it
was mutually agreed to postpone further
hearing until Thursday next at 11 a. m.,
with the understanding that if Mr. Delmas
was unable to be present owing to other
engagements, the matter should go over
until the following day.
Knight created renewed interest in the
hitherto dull proceedings by suddenly ad
dressing Mrs. Fair. He said: "Last night
we asked for the cipher-book. I will ask
Mrs. Fair if she has it now."
This referred to the key to the cipher
telegiams which passed between Mrs. Fair
and her representatives here during her
journey to and from New York to bring
here the will which was in the East.
Mrs. Fair promptly replied: "I have
the Bame one."
"I would ask that it be produced."
It was handed him and he said he would
put it in the custody of the court.
Foote objected to allow the book to go
out of the possession of his client, and
Knicht, as a counter move, called Stephen
Roberts to the stand.
His first question was, "Do you reside in
San Francisco?"
"Yes, sir," responded the witness.
"What book is that?" (Referring to
the icpher book handed him by Mrs.
Fair).
"It is a cipher book."
"Telegraph cipher?"
"Telegraph cipher."
"By whom was it used?"
"Used between Mrs. Craven and myself."
"For how lone a period of time?"
"Perhaps eight or nine years."
"When did you first begin to use it?"
"I think about eight years ago."
"And you have used it how long?"
"We used it for a month or two, and
then not for two or three years."
"Did Mrs. Fair ever use that cipher?"
"Yes, sir."
"Do you remember the night Mrs. Fair
went East?"
"I think it was the 25th of February,
1895."
"Did you go a portion cf the way with
her?"
"As far as Sacramento."
"Did you use the cipher in telegraphing
to her while she was on her way East?"
"I think I sent a telegram to her at
Ogden and then to Denver."
"Any other places?"
"None other."
"On her way back to Ban Francisco did
you telegraph her by cipher?"
"I did."
"What was the object in telegraphing
her in cipher?"
"To keep other people from knowing
what I was telegraphing to her."
Delmas interrupted to ask if the witness
had copies of the telegrams.
Roberts said he had, and produced a
batch of them.
Knight continued : "What was the first
dispatch you received from Mrs. Fair after
she started to go to New York?"
Roberts picked out a message and read
as follows:
"Carlin, Nev., June 26.
"Everything going all right."
He explained that this was addressed to
George R. Williams, the attorney of Mrs.
Fair.
Delmas again took a hand. Addressing
the court, he said :
"This I understand to be testimony
tak<>n in the contest of the will of James
G. Fair. Ido not understand that any
deposition made by Mrs. Craven is part of
the evidence."
Knight smilingly acknowledged his erro
neous method of procedure, saying: "I
don't insist on thi.* question. I admit this
is not the right way to go about it."
Then, addressing the witness, he asked :
"You have got the telegrams and you will
copy them, will you?"
Roberts agreed to do so.
A discussion arose as to who should have
the custody of the cipher-Dook. Knight
suggested that Russell Wilson take it and
decipher the secret messages by its aid,
but Delmas objected, as he did not thinit
it right, he said, to have Mr. Roberts' pri
vate business matters made known to the
world, as would be the case if a copy of the
cipher-book were made by Mr. Wilson as
proposed by Mr. Knight in the course of
the discussion. It was finally agreed that
Mr. Roberts should transcribe all the
cipher telegrams and bring them into
court with the cipher- book.
Adjournment was taken until Thursday,
July 2, at 11 a. m.
Garret McEnerney, who was absent
Thursday night, though subpenaed, was
called up by Judge Slack to De sworn on
the request of Mr. Delmas. McEnerney
explained his absence Thursday by saying
he had urgent engagements on that night
with Mr. Heggerty. Mr. Pierson and Mr.
Mitchell. He denied a report which he

said had come to his notice that he had
defied the power of the court and had said
he would not attend in response to the
subpena. His excuse was accepted, and
another act of the great Fair drama was
over.
HER POSITION IN DANGER.
The Grand Jury and President Hen
ry T. Scott in Favor of Mrs.
Craven's Suspension.
The foreman and other members of the
Grand Jury have been requested to review
the testimony given by Mrs. Nettie Craven
in Judge Slacs's court Thursday night
and consider whether her career as a
teacher in the public schools of San Fran
cisco should terminate. The subject was
not presented to the jury in the form of a
written communication, but the foreman
was orally urged to take steps to secure
her resignation or retirement.
Mrs. Cr,aven must prepare to meet
trouble shortly elsewhere than in the
courtroom.
At the last meeting of the Board of Edu
cation President Henry T. Scott broached
the matter of her removal, but at that
time the feeling of the other members of
the board was so strongly in favor of Mrs.
Craven, owing to her unusual ability as a
principal, that Mr. Scott deemed it advisa
ble not to press the point at that time.
Speaking of the matter yesterday he ex
pressed himself in emphatic and unmis
takable language.
"There is to be a special meeting of the
Board of Education on Tuesday night for
the purpose of paying salaries, but any
other business can, of course, be taken
up. Should the case of Mrs. Craven not be
considered then, it will probably come up
the second Wednesday in July â at our
next regular meeting.
"An interesting point is that since the
date of her alleged marriage to Senator
Fair, should that marriage be established,
she was improperly drawing salary as a
school principal. At the time of her mar
riage there was a rule of 'the board that no
teacher who married while in the service
of the department should bÂ« allowed to re
tain her position, and it would be a nice
legal question now to see whether she was
entitled to her salary since that time. That
rule was rescinded about a year ago.
"It is true we have no puwer to dis
charge any teacher without a formal
charge having been made and a trial ac
corded the accused, but there is nothing to
prevent her beine suspended pending such
a trial, and I lor one am heartily in favur,
of such a course. I consider it a very bad
example, not only to the other teachers,
but the girl pupils attending the schools,
to permit her to retain her position."
Sorrow and imiignation manifested
themselves in Mrs. Craven-Fair's tones

FOB PKESIDKXTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOR VlCtf-PKKSIOKN'T-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
KI.KCTION KUTEHBEB 3, 1896.
This is the day you leave orders for The
{Sunday Call.
Register at once. If you begin waiting
you may wait too long.
There are evidences that even Wall
street is inclined to boom silver a little
just now. '
Wherever there is an intelligent work
ingman who needs work there is a worker
for McKinley.
Mr. Irish will not bolt the Democratic
party, but he professes to be willing to let
the party bolt him.
In trying to straddle Mr. Whitney has
let himself drop between the two stools
and finds himself floored.
Patriotism, protection and prosperity;
America against the world. That is the
battle-cry of the campaign.
To re-establish the era of prosperity we
must re-establish the legislation which |
made that prosperity possible.
Popular assurance of McKinley's elec
tion affects the stock market like an as
surance of the revival of trade.
It seems we are about to return to the
practice of calling prize-fights boxing
matches, and letting them go at that.
Republican organization is being rapidly
effected and those who wish to start even
with the procession had better join a club
at once.
Without protection American wages will
Boon sink to the European level, and the
comfort of the workingman's home will
vanish forever. "
The popular voice which called for the
nomination of Me Kin ley makes it certain
that the chief issue of tue campaign will
be the restoration of the McKinley tariff.
The attempt of the Democratic party to
evade the tariff issue by talking of free
silver will avail them nothing. The peo
ple are going to vote for work and wages.
Silver is rising in the stock market as
well as in politics and on Wednesday was
Bold in Wall street at 70 cents, being
Â»n advance of \% cents during the present
month.
The refusal of the Populists to combine
With Democracy means simply that the
American farmer has too much sound
sense to play into the hands of the British
free-trader.
California will never reach a complete
development until she manufactures her
raw material for home use and for export,
and she can never nope to do this and pay
good wages without protection.
Since England has appealed to us to as
sist in settling one of her quarrels with
Venezuela it seems clear the Monroe doc- !
trine has begun to get in its work in the
right place and with the right effect.
It is said a movement has been started
in Kentucky to repeal the Southern Pacific
charter, but after the experience of the
iast movement of that kind it is hard to
believe the present one will be much more
than a wiggle.
There is a probability the gold men at
Chicago will take a firm stand on Cleve
land's record as a platform, call them
selves the "regulars," take possession of
the party band-wagon and let the silver
men snort, kick, rear and bolt if they will.
In bis telegram of congratulations to
McKinley Senator Aldrich of Rhode Isl
and spoke the general sentiment of the
country in saying, "I believe the victory
will be bo emphatic that the policy we
contend for will be accepted without ques
tion for a generation."
The. number of young men and "first
voters" who are joining Republican clubs
is one of the most encouraging signs of
the times, inasmuch as it assures the prev
alence of protection sentiment, not for this
generation only, but for that which is now
rapidly coming to the front.
In 1860 HerscheJ V. Johnston of Georgia
ran for Vice-President as a Democrat on
the Douglas ticket, but his son this year
went to tit. Louis a Republican to vote for
McKinley. Thus does the South grow in
wisdom and virtue and the sons of this
generation prove themselves better than
their fathers. -
The freight-rate tariff of the Valley
road is not only lower than that of the {
Southern Pacific Company, but it has the j
further advantage to the shipper of abol
ishing altogether the switching charges
which the Southern Pacific Company
makes always vexatious and sometimes
extortionate. Truly for the people of the
Can Joaquin the better times are at hand.
REGISTER AND ORGANIZE.
The time has come for all Republicans,
for all protectionists, for all friends of
American industry, to prepare for the
coming campaign by putting themselves
in a position where they can be helpful
to the party and the cause from the first
stage of the canvass to the last. It is of
advantage to the party that as many men
as possible shall enroll themselves in the
Republican clubs and take part in the
j work of the canvass, and it is of the high
est importance that every member of the
party should register so as to be able to
vote. Tbe duties of Republicans at this
time, therefore, can be summed up in the
phrase, "Register and organize."
Every Republican should register as
soon as he can find time to go to the regis
tration office, and if he cannot find that
time very soon he should take it even at
the cost of some other occupation. There
can be no voting without registration. If
a man does not register he disfranchises
himselfâ deprives himself by his own
negligence of the rights of citizenship and
puts himself on a level with aliens, who
have no voice in the selection of pubiic of
ficials or in determining the course of pub
lic policies. The time allowed for regis
tration and the provisions for registering
are ample, provided citizens will attend
to it. If any one, however, delays, hesi
tates and postpones the performance of
the duty, he may be too late, and find him
self debarred from the privilege of voting
when election day comes round.
Under the law enacted by the last Legis
lature reeistration begins ICO days before
the general election and continues for sev
enty-five days. It began at the City Hall
on May 27 and will end August 3. The
fifth, day of precinct registration will close
Aueust 9 and that will be the end. In this
it will be seen that ample time is given for
all. It must be borne in mind, however,
i that in the later days there will be a rush
i at the registration office, and consequently
j the duty can be most easily performed by
| being performed promptly.
Having registered his name and secured
I the right of voting, the next step of the
j Republican should be to join some club
i convenient and congenial to him, and
j make ready to take an active part in the
campaign. Party organization is at all times
essential to party success but it was never
more so than at this time. Democracy
alone, Populism alone, or free Silverism
alone would be powerless against the pop
ular sentiment demanding protection, but
there is danger that these may combine
and by their joint and vociferous shout
ings confuse the minds of those whose po
litical opinions are not firmly founded on
great party principles or who may be igno
rant ol" tlie supreme importance to all
j classes of people of the immediate re-es
j tablishment of the protective tariff.
It will be a walk-over campaign if Re
â  publicans perform their political duties
promptly and with ardor. It will be a
hard fight, however, for the stalwart and
the loyal if the general mass of the party
should be affected by any indifference or
j carelessness. This fact should inspire
I every member of the party with a resolve
to do his share in arousing popular enthu
siasm and keeping the tariff issue to the
front in spite of Democratic dodges and
evasions. The real issue of the time is
j that of American industry against the
world. Every American home is con
cerned in the contest. The result will
virtually determine whether we are to have
free trade or protection for the rest of this
generation. Republicans and protection
ists should need no urging, but they must
not be too sanguine. Register and organ
ize.
PROTECTION DEMANDED,
After all is said and done, the fact re
mains that the platform of the Republi
can party always is an expression of the
best judgment of the majority of the rank
and file. It declares for what the people
want done and what they want left un
done. In the great heart of the majority
is always written what is best for the
country, and there is no turning away
from it. All a convention can do, if it
obeys the voice of the people, is
to give expression to their will
in a declaration of principles ana put in
motion the machinery that is to carry into
practical operation what they deem best
for the whole country. If cliques ever tried
to run counter to the will of tne people they
were short-lived, and if tbe commissioned
asrentÃ of the party ever failed through
trickery or ignorance to give full expres
sion of the sentiments of the people they
were repudiated.
The St. Louis convention was conspicu
ously under the influence of the majority
of the rank and file, and in selecting a
standard-bearer and formulating a plat
form it was simply working out the will of
the people. It is very true tbat all the
people were not fully satisfied, but the
strength of the Republican party is in a
cheerful acquiescence of all its members in
the work of the party as a whole. From
the foundation of the party the policy of
the rank and file ha 3 been to sink or swim
united.
So, when tbe majority commanded the
convention to make the tariff question
paramount to all others it at once became
the duty of every Republican who has the
best interests of the country at heart to
say, amen! No doubt very many be
lieved, and still believe, there are
other issues that are of equal if
not of more importance than the
tariff, but the majority thought otherwise
and has so declared itself. There is but
one safe road, therefore, for the party as a
whole and for its individual members to
go. It must be a united cry for protection
first and with an immovable determina
tion that whatever else may be good for
the country shall follow.
TWO DECLARATIONS.
The underlying principle of protection
is self-preservation. There is perpetual
strife between individuals and nations for
financial and commercial supremacy. It
matters not whether it be selfishness or
something else, the fact remains that man
by nature is inclined to not only gain ail
lie can, but protect that which be bas in
band and opportunities for more from in
fluences that are calculated to lessen the
one and circumscribe tbe otber. Man nor
nation can have industrial independence
if bis or its field of operation can be tres- i
passed upon at tbe will of any trespasser.
Mill, iactory nor farm can have a certain
value if all tbe world is free to undersell
at its own door tbat which it produces.
Tbere can be no independence of person or
property where there is not adequate pro
tection against whatever would tyrannize
the one or impair the stability of tbe other.
This very important fact was emphasized
by the founders of this nation when they
followed the declaration of American in
dependence of July 4, 1776, by a protective
tariff act on July 4, 1779.
He who denies that protection to the
people of the colonies and to their indus
tries against outside infringement upon
rights and interests which tney them
selves had acquired, knows very little
of the political and economic prin
ciple which incited them to rebel against
tbe mother country. Tbe tariff of July,
1779, was a declaration of American in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 27, 1896.
dustrial, commercial, financial and agri
cultural independence, and without it the
declaration of July, 1776, would have
availed the people nothing. The great
ness of a nation lies in its commercial and
industrial strength, and its strength is
measured by the protection the nation
Rives to its commerce and industries.
Hence, the meaning of the "American
idea" is protection to each sovereign
against non- American or foreign individ
uals and agencies that are calculated to
impede him in his right to reap the full of
his effort There is nothing mysterious
or uncertain about the principle of pro
tection any more than there is in the
principle of political independence.
It was the fear of the industrial inde
pendence of the colonies more than their
political separation that made England
strugtfle so hard to retain jurisdiction over
them. Since their independence was rec
ognized by Great Britain no stone has
been left unturned by that conntry to
nullify the declaration of industrial inde
pendence by the adoption of free trade.
Free trade would give England commer
cial and financial supremacy, and not only
so, but so long as free trade prevailed the
United States would be in debt to her, and
since the debtor is always curtailed in in
dependence of action he is, in a sense, a
slave. Commerce is void of sentiment,
and has no conception of the meaning of
philanthropy. It fights always for the
supremacy of that nation which promotes
it, therefore in ratio to the protection this
country gives to it is this country's su
premacy established. This is all tnat pro
tection means and stands for. It is not
born of superstition, of sentiment, nor of
any religion, but of common business
sense and experience in commercial opera
tions.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
.lust by way of illustrating what Cali
fornians can do in that line The Call will
to-morrow present a full page of native
born fish stories. They come from all
quarters of the Stale. Some of them are
trueâ all of them are interesting. While
it isn't necessary that you should believe
them all you will not care to miss reading
one of them.
' There will be other pages in The Sdnday
Call, and other striking and attractive
features. A novel page is entitled "Who
Are They?" When you read this you will
realize that there is aiways something new
under the sun in modern journalism.
There are a number of novel features to
interest women in particular, and more
than a feast of the best reading matter, for
men, women and children. In science,
literature and art, all that is new and in
teresting will be found in The Sunday
Call.
McKINLEY IN DEMAND.
The demand for Mr. McKinley from all
parts of the country to orate on the
Fourth of July should not be understood
as meaning that it comes from curiosity
to see the next President, nor because bis
name is William McKinley. It is because
be has been designated by the Republican
party as the proper man to administer the
affairs of the General Government and
lead in the work of oiling the wheels of
commerce and industry that they may
roll ahead again without friction. The
people are hungering for better times. For
three years they have fed upon the husks
of prosperity. They have planted and
reaped, but no increase bas come to them
Their labor has brought no compensation.
They have been obliged to stand in help
lessness and see their savings wither and
disappear. They are in distress, but they
see the dawn of prosperity, and they
know it is the party which William Mc-
Kinley represents that is pushing aside,
by the mighty principles of true Ameri
canism, the debris of torn-down industry
tbat good times may come again.
It is natural, therefore, that the people
should want the next President, who is to
lead in thi3 mighty work, to help them
celebrate the day which stands in the
calendar of time and marks the beginning
of tbe political and industrial inde
pendence of the United States. To be
sure, Mr. McKinley represents in himself
the highest type of American manhood.
As a citizen he stands for whatever is cal
culated to better the condition of the
people, but it is as the chief representa
tive of the political organization that is to
deliver the whole country from the thrall
dom of bankruptcy with which Demo
cratic perfidy and incapacity environ
them that all want to see and hear him. The
coming Fourth of July should be a day of
thanksgiving for the good that is about to
come, as well as a day of outpouring of
patriotism.
RAILWAY SWITCHING CHARGES.
The act establishing freight rates without
switching charges by the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Railway was a bold and deadly
blow against a system of robbery that has
prevailed ever since tbe Southern Pacific
went into the monopoly business. Of
course shippers know that switching rates
aie additional charges; that is to say, tbe
rate-sheet quotes the cost of transporta
tion, which ostensibly includes all charges
between the initial and destination points,
but when the consignee comes to pay the
freight and remove the goods he finds a
â¢â¢switching" charge has been added to the
card-rate. For tearing down this system
of plundering shippers, the Valley road is
justly entitled to the thanks of every busi
ness man in the State, the more so because
there never was, nor ceuld there ever be,
any excuse for such unjust methods to ex
act money from the public. A stagecoach
might just as well stop on the outskirts of
the town and demand extra pay to deliver
its passengers at the hotel.
In the early days of railroading when
transfers were made by wagons there was
an excuse for such charges, for the term
inus of the road was its destination point,
but in these days of connecting lines the
switching charge means that the shipper
is in a position to be squeezed with no
power to prevent it, and the custom was
not only introduced in railway manage
ment at an early day, but it has kept its
itching palm hard down upon all tbe
traffic of the State ever since. A single
switching charge does not exact a great
deal of money to be sure, but in a year's
business it amounts to a great deal of
money to every large shipper, and very
often a snipper would be satisfied with the
sum of the switching charges he has paid
for the year's profit. But the management
of the Valley road will have nothing of
that sort, and shippers, are under obliga
tions to it for overturning and annull
ing a most vicious and unfair custom.
PERPETRATING A JOKE.
There always are amusing incidents and
ridiculous sayings in a political campaign,
but it is doubtful if there is anything fun
nier eeen or heard from now on to Novem
ber than the pompous announcement of
the Cincinnati Enquirer that it is "princi
ples, not men," with the Democratic party.
It is too brazenly absurd to be twisted
into a news item, for an item
of news is obliged to have at least
one thread of truth running through it
to make it go. The funny part of the
Enquirer's declaration will be located
without a microscope when it is known
that it was made after the editor and
proprietor of the Enquirer had put his
private mark of ownership on an easy
working majority of the Ohio Democratic
State Convention and that his majority
passed a resolution to the effect that the
editor of the Enquirer is altogether the
best man in America for the Chicago con
vention to nominate for Vice-President,
although, as a matter of fact, he should
be given the first place.
The trouble with the Democratic party
is it is devoid of principles as well as prin
ciple. Hitherto it has been supposed to
be a party of office-hungry men, whose
principles were like the chameleon â a
member of the lizard family which has the
faculty of changing its colors to harmo
nize with those of the thing it is for the
moment the most intimately associated
with. Two sets of principles, so called,
are now undergoing repair for use at Chi
cago, and whichever set shall appear
to possess the greater number of
deceptive qualities will be employed to
beguile the unwary into the Democratic
trap. If the Democratic party ever advo
cated a principle that did not contemplate
the spoils of office for the bosses it has
been kept under cover. At all events that
is not the kind that is used in active ser
vice. The plan of Whitney to straddle
questions which the people are deeply in
terested in may be said to be a genuine
Democratic working principle, for it is
composed wholly of intrigue, deceit and
false pretenses. But "principles, not
men," is a jokeâ an idiotic joke at that.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
PROTECTION THE ISSUE.
An Old Republican Points Out How History
Repeats Itseu.
Editor of the Callâ Dear Sib: As one of your
readers interested in tbe success oJ the Repub
lican party at the coming election, and having
implicit confidence in the integrity, executive
ability and political sagacity of our candi
dates, I feel anxious, in common with so many
others, to see every proper exertion made by
pen and voice and pres3, wherever the people
can be reached, to make our work effective and
our triumph complete. While I feel that the
protection of our industries, coupled with the
replenishment of our depleted treasury, is the
dominant issue before the people, our mone
tary affairs have so jostled the minds of many
that new complications are liable to lead some
astray, if not properly enlightened or put on
guard. The trivial dissensions or false issues
growing out of a mere difference of judgment
in regard to coinage should not overshadow
the leading policy for our political salvation,
or the grand essentials for personal thrift and
National, prosperity.
A native of Pennsylvania, I once resided in
Lancaster County of that State, bat a few
miles from the residence of James Buchanan ;
but while there is no merit in that, I had the
pleasure of casting my first vote for a member
of Congress for that stalwart Republican,
Thaddeua Stevens of Lancaster City, a man
whose memory will be revered for his noble
bearing, his forensic ability, his political in
fluence and his many humanitarian deeds
long after Buchanan's good deeds shall have
been forgotten. I afterward lived and con
ducted a Republican newspaper in the Con
gressional district represented by David Wll
mot of the anti-slavery territorial proviso
fame, ana not far from the residence of
Galusha A. Grow, the ex-Speaker of the House,
who again represents his di-ttrict among the
National law-givers. Now, I have noticed that
in political affairs as well as in other transpir
ing events, the old saying is often verified,
that history repeats itself, and I will cite a
little incident in proof. In 1857 the Demo
cratic tarty was in power, with Buchanan as
our chief executive. Under Democratic rule,
or misrule rather, our revenues from Imports
were reduced and our manufactures dwindled.
I A depression in trade ensued, and a financial
I crisis was experienced just prior to the re
bellion, much as we find it at the present day,
although the President, with his Cabinet and
Congress, did not have the same chance for
lavish expenditures, for lack of funds, nor to
increase the public debt under some plausible
pretext, as is the lamentable case with our
Clevelandish administration.
I have by me a copy of a letter written by
Mr. Wilniot to David "B. Brown, September 28,
1857, in which he depicts the trouble so
clearly and in a manner so apropos to present
conditions that I think it would gratify many
of your readers to reproduce it. By the date
of the letter yon may see that it was a short
time prior to the formation of the Republican
party, but after Mr. Wilmot had become dis
gusted with tlie pro-slavery domination of his
Did political associates and had severed his
connection therefrom. The sentiments and
arguments he then expressed are in full
accord with those of the Republican party of
the present day so far as the protection of hu
man liberty and of honest industry are con
cerned, and the same you will find all along
the line of our history marking out those car
dinal and distinctive features under which
the resources of tne country have been in
creased, its industries fostered and its general
prosperity augmented. It is referred to now to
show a similar condition of affairs to that of
the country under the old Democratic execu
tive fossil whose free trade and pro-slavery
sympathies allowed the Government, under
reckless engineers and petty despots, to ride
on headlong to the verge of ruin. But to the
extract.
After deploring the financial convulsions of
the day aiid expressing his dee*) sympathy
with "the thousands of honest and industrious
workingmen unexpectedly thrown out of em
ployment and deprived of the means of sup
port for their families" he adds: "On our visit
to the Gloucester Mills we had some conversa
tion upon the subject of the tariff policy of the
country in connection with its influence upon
American enterprise and labor. That the tariff
policy of the Government has much to do with
the revulsions that periodically convulse the
country is doubtless true, intimately con
nected as that policy must ever be with all our
financial and industrial interests. The very
considerable reduction in the tariff at the last
session of Congress must have had a disastrous
influence inbringing upon us the present state
of things, as it greatly stimulated importa
tions, causing heavier drafts upon the country
for its precious metals.
"It is a great misfortune that our tariff policy
cannot be wholly removed from the party
conflicts of the country and placed upon a
permanent and reasonable basis. Aside from
partisan prejudice there is not, I imagine, a
very wide difference of opinion upon this sub
ject among intelligent and reflecting men. I
have always looked to our policy as settled in
the respect that the ordinary revenue is to be
provided for by duties upon foreign importa
tions, and I have ever favored the policy of
such discriminations as wou'-d afford adequate
ana ample protection to American interests
and American labor.
"We have an immense revenue to raise. Al
ready the expenditures of our Government
reach the enormous sum of sixty millions of
dollars, and it is rapidly increasing under the
profligate and demoralizing expenditures cf
Democratic administrations. la raising this
vast sum there is ample room, by judicious
and proper discriminations, to afford to our
great industrial interest ample protection and
to American labor a just and adequate reward.
I have never intentionally violated this sound
American policy and would cheerfully unite
to-day with the reasonable and judicious men
of the country in placing our tariff policy on a
basis that would secure to American enter
prise and labor fair and just measures of pro
tection.
"The great struggle in which we are now en
gaged and in which my feelings are so deeply
embarked is a struggle to maintain the dig
nity and rights of free labor against the de
grading competition of the labor of the slave,
and I am equally in favor of protecting our
American labor against a ruinous competition
with the cheap labor of the Old World."
This isolated excerpt is given as a sample
only of the expression of thousands, for such
were the views of the leading Republicans
thirty and forty years ago, and the same code
of political ethics is enunciated through the
National and State platforms of the party to
day. It iB the same grand underlying princi
ple of protection which permeates all branches
of trade and commerce, tne stimulus to home
manufacture by a discriminating tariff both
for revenue and protection until we shall grow
In skill and power to become self-supporting,
independent and truly free. All minor topics
of home or international importance maybe
discussed or molded to the popular will, and
need not oe ignored, but let the word go forth
to every fireside, farm, town and hamlet in
the land that protection is our rallying cry
and will be until victory shall perch upon our
banners, prosperity be restored and the people
can cry out amen I William Bcrgess.

DISTILLERIES IN OPERATION.
Probabilities Are That Nearly All cf
Them Will Now Run the Twelve
Months Through.
Every fruit-grower in the State, particu
larly hose in the central and northern
counties, are greatly elated over the open
ing o: another avenue of profit, the result
of a recent act of Congress changing the
law? governing the distilling of brandy
fror. fruit.
I ider the old act only peaches, apples
grapes were allowed to be distilled.
â¢or Welborn has received the follow
_â  notice from the Commissioner of Ih
tt rnal Revenue:
An act to amend section 3255 of the revised
of the United States concerning the
distilling of branfly from fruits:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Kepresentativesof the I'nited States of America
in Congress assembled, that section 3255 of
the revised statutes of the United States be
and the same is hereby amended so as to read
as follows :
Section 3255. The Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, with the approval of the Secretary
of the Treasury, may exempt distillers of
brandies mad^ exclusively from apples,
peaches, grapes, pineapples, oranges, apricots,
berries or prunes from any provision of this
title relating to tho manufacture of spirit?,
except as to the tax thereon, when in his
judgment it may seem expedient to do so.
Approved June 3, 1890.
It wil! be seen from the new law that
fruit-growers and distillers will be able to
convert into brandy almost any fruit
(.Town in the State. Heretofore in the
event of an extra heavy crop of apricots
or prunes the growers have been com
pelled to dry such as the short season
would permit, the remainder being al
lowed to rot. In this way hundreds and
thousands of pounds went to waste.
All this, of course, has been a dead loss
to the producer, and incidentally the dis
tiller. Limited in their operations almost
entirely to apples and grapes, many dis
tillers have been forced to shut down at
least a portion of the year. It is thought
now, however, that those in the central
and southern parts of the State will be able
to run the entire twelve months.
At present there ars 119 distilleries in
active operation. Last year the output of
brandy in the First District amounted to
1,472,650 gallons, and throughout the State
lething over 4,000,000 gallons. It is
thought that the new law will be the
means of increasing the output from 25 to
50 per cent. This means to the producer
and distiller at least half a million dollars
and probably more, and to the Govern
ment a largeiy increased revenue.
The counties in Central California will
be principally the gainers. The tons and
tons of prunes and apricots which have
hitherto been either allowed to rot or used
as fertilizers will be converted into a
commercial article for which there is an
ever increasing demand.
OLIVIER IS DISMISSED.
Judge Belcher Does Not Think
. Him Guilty of Perjuring
Himself.
It Is Only a Case of Too Much Mother
in-Law Says the District
Attorney.
Manuel Olivier, who on Tuesday last
was convicted of perjury in Judge Belcher's
court, was yesterday liberated by that
official. When Olivier came up for sen
tence a motion for a new trial was made,
which Judge Belcher granted, and then
on motion of the District Attorney the
case was dismissed.
Olivier is the man who several months
ago married a girl named Rosie Brady,
much against the wishes of the latter's
mother. Mrs. Brady had Olivier arrested
for perjury for swearing Rosie was over 18
years of age when he procured his license.
In the Police Court Olivier's wife swore
she had informed him that she was of age
and that he so believed when he got the
license. In the Superior Court Rosie
flatly contradicted this testimony. Despite
the evident perjury on her part and the
introduction of a letter to Olivier in which
she states her belief that she is almost 19
years of age, and quotes her aunt as her
authority, the jury found Olivier guilty.
In granting the accused a new trial yes
terday, Judge Belcher said the verdict
was evidently an unjust one, as there was
shown to have been perjury in the evi
dence ana the matter all around
was evidently a case of too much
motber-in-law. The motion of the Dis
trict Attorney for disraisal was granted
without argument.
The decision was a very popular one,
and Olivier left the courtroom accom
panied by several friends, who congratu
lated him warmly.

LAMOUREAUX PLEASED.
Says the California State Board of
Trade Exhibit Is the Finest lie
Has Seen.
General Land Commissioner S. W.
Lamoureaux of Washington, D. C, and
party visited the State Board of Trade
headquarters yesterday, where they were
entertained by Manager Filcher.
"I dropped in only for a moment," said
Mr. Lamoureaux, "but was so charmed by
the excellence of the display that I stayed
longer than an hour and I found it hard to
get away then.
"I do not believe any other State in the
Union can show such an exhibit of fruit as
this. It surprises me, it is really so very
fine. It is a sdendid index of California's
great and varied resources. Everything
about it is not only good, but the whole is
most attractively arranged and invites
visitors to this btate, not only visitors, but
their capital and the remainder of their
days."
Pursuant to the letters sent out by Man
ager Filcher recentiv for a new supply for
the fruit exhibitions, installments of fresh
supplies have been received in large num
bers.

NEW QUARANTINE OFFICER
The United States Will Soon
Placs an Officer in
Charge.
The Governor Will Lose the Patron
age of a Nice BerthâRegula
tions Will Be Strict.
The United States Government is mak
ing arrangements to take entire charge of
the quarantine service at this port. Dr.
Rosenan is now on hi 3 way from vVashing- j
ton to assume control of the station and it
is therefore only a question of time before
the State physician will be out of a job.
Dr. Blue of the Marine Hospital will be
the assistant quarantine officer. Yester
day Collector Wise received the following
letter:
Washington, June 20, 1896.
Collector of Customs, San Francisco â Sir: On
being notified by the medical officer in com- j
maud of the Vnited States quarantine station j
at San Francisco that he had begun the board- ,
ing and inspection of vessels in accordance
with instructions issued to him by the sur
geon-peneral, M. 11. 8., you will from that date
and thereafter refuse entry to vessels from
foreign ports without the certificate signed by
the National quarantine officer at San Fran
cisco in accordance with the quarantine regu
lations of this department. C. S. Hamlix,
Acting Secretary.
Heretofore the quarantining and inspec- j
tion of vessels have been entirely in the j
hands of the State Board of Health, Dr. I
Chalmers being in charge. It has been
considered one of the best offices in (lie
gift of the State. At the last session of
the Legislature a bill was passed recom- j
mending that the Government relieve the '
State of the quarantine service. The bill j
was pigeon-holed and never signed by the
Governor.
The Federal officer is to be stationed at j
the Marine Hospital, and will work under ;
the supervision of the Surgeon-General in j
"Washington. The Federal regulations
will be much more strict than those now i
in torce and will be rigorously enforced. !
The local officer will still have power to I
board vessels, but his inspection will be |
practically useless, as the Government
quarantine will take precedence over him.
It is feared in shipping circles that the
officers may oppose each other and greatly
discommode shipping. Unless they act
in conjunction ship-owners will be sub
jected to great delay and annoyance. In I
the end, however, the State officer will '
probably be compelled to retire from the
field.
MISSION HIGH SCHOOL.
Folsom Club 'So. 1 Indorses the Reso
lution Adopted by the Mission
High School Club.
Folsom improvement Club No. 1 met
last evening in its rooms on Folsom
street, near Twenty-fourth, and consid
ered the resolution submitted to them by
the Mission High School Club, petition
ing the Board of Education to establish a
high school in the Mission.
This resolution was adopted with the in
tention of submitting it to all the clubs in
the Mission for their approval. After
some discussion the club unanimously
voted for it. After the last club has in
dorsed it it will be submitted to the Board
of Education.
It was also decided that a grand parade
be held on the evening of July 25 in cele
bration of the bituminizing of -'olsom
street, which has been completed from
Nineteenth street to Sixth. All property
owners will be asked to illuminate, the
cycling club will join the procession, and
it is expected that, with the co-operation
of the four Folsom clubs and the South
Side Club, the occasion will be one long
remembered by property-holders.
WORK OF THE BOYS.
An -exhibition To-Night in the Silver
Links Club.
An entertainment, exhibition and sale
of baskets, pictures, frames, drawings and
woodwork will be held this evening by
the Silver Links Boys' Club at 427 Second
street.
The managers wish it distinctly under
stood that this is not an invitation "to
come and buy," but "to come and see"
what the nature of the work is. They
trust that thus the interest in the work
may increase and that their efforts will
meet with the encouragement which all
such labors should deserve. The perform
ance of useful work by boys is the true
way of saving them.
Tickets can be obtained from any of the
following persons: Board of managers-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 27, 1896.
BEQUESTS TO HIS FAMILY

The Eiucation of the Daughter Cared
Forâ Small Sums lo Two

The will of General W. fl. Dimond was
yesterday filed for probate.
According to its provisions two of his
sons, William W. Dimond and Harry W.
Dimond, get only $5000 each. The legacy
of the latter is placed in the hands of

its earnings until the trustees see fit to
deliver the $5000 to him. The balance of
the property is to be equally divided be
tween Edwin R. Dimond and his two sis
ters, Mrs. Paul Jarboe and Mrs. Joseph
Tobin. The shares of the two ladies are
also left in trust with Edwin R. Dimond

Grnndy's Bunch of Violets.
Sydney Grundy's "A Bunch of Violets," a
novelty of more than ordinary interest, will be
presented at the California next week by
Stockwell's players. The marked fayor with
which this brilliant London success was re
ceived in New York is a pretty sure indication
that it will please the theater-going public
even better than the two admirable produc
tions that have already been offered by Man
ager Stock well and his admirable company.
Like all of the previous dramatic productions
of its talented author, "A Bunch of Violets" is
a charmingly written play with effective
situations for several strong characters. It
is said that a majority of Mr. Grundy's
admirers consider "A Bunch of VioletV'
the best play he has ever written, and,
as It will be presented for the first
time on this coast, with a cast in
which Herbert Kelcey and Effie Shannon play
the leading roles, it will excite more tiian the
usual imerest. Mr. Kelcey will assume the
role of Sir Philip Marchant, originally played
by the celebrated English character actor,
Beerbohm Tree, and Erne Shannon will play a
light-comedy adventuress, offering her supe
rior advantages for good dfamatic work. Olive
Oliver, Winona Shannon, William Beach, John
T. Sullivan, J. N. Long and L. R. Stock well are
also provided with excellent parts, and as the
play calls for beautiful dressing and elaborate
stage appointments and accessories special
preparations have been made by the manage
ment for handsome settings.
Not Public Streets.
It was yesterday decided by the Judiciary
Committee of the Roard of Supervisors to
recommend that Essex place, between Folsom
and Harrison, First and Second streets, and
Locust avenue, between Gough and Octavia
streets, be omitted from the list of streets on
the official map.
The names of the streets in the Sunny Dale
Tract, with the exception of Sunuy Dale ave
nue, were also omitt_ed.
It was voted to report In favor ot the remit
tance of the personal property assessment of
$50 in the case of W. J. Walters and against
similar petitions by Joseph Schnitz and the
widow Schmalz.
They Refuse to Boycott.
The theatrical employes have in a commu
nication to the San Fanci.co Council of Labor
declined to join in the boycott on the Em
porium, on the ground that it would be unjust
to the engineers and electricians employed
there who have families depending upon them
for support, and for the further reason that
those men belong to labor unions.

HAPPY SUNSET DISTRICT
Appropriation for Improvements
Jovially Acknowl
edged.
Public Officials Complimented on Their
Recognition of the Needs of
the Community.
The residents of Sunset district are jubi
lant. The Board of Supervisors recently
passed an order appropriating $11,000 for
the grading preparatory to paving and
sewering the streets embraced within the
district bounded by H and D streets and
Seventh and Twentieth avenues.
As a demonstration of their apprecia
tion, the Sunset District Improvement
Club, assisted by the ladies of the district,
last evening tendered a reception at Park j
View Hall to the Mayor and Board of
Supervisors and other officials who had
assisted them in obtaining the mnch-de
sired improvement. A number of the
Supervisors were present, and the Mayor
and other members of the board sent
written expressions of regret at their in
ability to attend.
An excellent literary and musical pro
gramme was rendered, a feature of which
was the recitation by Miss Esther Morris
of an original poem, "Sunset District," by
Miss Ewald. The committee of welcome,
consisting of fifteen young ladies, ren
dered a song entitled "Give Us Light in |
Sunset District," in which the need of j
electric-lights in the vicinity was poeti- j
cally set forth.
Mrs. Emma Harrington, chairman of |
the reception committee, delivered a brief j
address, in which she thanked the officials ;
for their zeal in securing recognition for !
the needs ot the district. Dancing sue- j
ceeded the programme.
The improvement club under whose i
auspices the affair was held is one of the
most energetic and active in the com
munity. It is officered by Julius Frankel,
president, and Charles Cushman, secre
tary. Much of the success of last even
ing's entertainment was due to the ladies.
No Bodies Found.
The workmen engaged in clearing away the
debris on the scere of last Monday's disaster
on Fifth str<-Â»-t concluded the -earch foi the
supposed bodies reported to be under the
fallen building, and to their joy were unable
to find the bodies of the men reported to have
been seen there after the house tumbled down.
The Durrant Exceptions.
The bill of exceptions in the Durrant case
was filed in the County Clerk's office yester
day. There are over 1000 type-written pages
in the document, which Deputies Doran and
Jones are preparing for the printer.

LyDCh were yesterday committed to the Whit
tier Relorm School by Judge Belcher for crimes
against nature.
Henry Davis was sent to the same place for
burglary.
Sued on a Note.
William Leviston has sued Thomas H.
Osmont for $1104 25 on a promissory note

Lang Quonsr, convicted of manslaughter,
was yesterday granted a new trial in Judge
Belcher's court and afterward dismissed on
motion of the District Attorney.
SLEEPLESSNESS,
The Story of a Man Who Could
Not Sleep.
Suffered for Ten Tears With a Compli
cation of Diseasesâ Bent at Last.
From Jackton Sentinel, Maquokcta, lowa,
Any one who has ever passed one sleepless
night can appreciate in a slight degree at least
the sufferings ot one who, through weary
nights and days, vainly seeks to close his eyes
in slumber, until at last life itself becomes al
most a waking nightmare. To toss upon one's
couch night after night for weeks with tired
brain and nerves, longing without avail for
rest; to count the hours as they drag wearily by,
the strained senses startled by every slight
sound, is to experience one of the greatest
afflictions that life can bring. Such was the
experience of Mr. A. T. Wilcox of Baldwin,
lowa, who makes the following statement:
I, A. T. Wilcox of said county and State de
pose and say, that on or about June 1, 1894,
f purchased Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
People, and began taking them according to
directions, and at once felt better and in ten
days felt a decided change for the better. I
continued to tnke these pills until about No
vember 1, 1894, when I had to quit for want
of money.
I can say that this medicine gave me imme
diate relief. So much so I could do my chores,
which before were very difficult, with ease
and felt better than I had for the last ten years
past.
My disease was sleeplessness, cold feet and
constipation of the bowels and liver troubles
together with kidney troubles. 1 want to say
that before 1 began to take the pills 1 had to
sit up in my chair to sleep, but in a few days I
began to ieel better and my nights were those
of perfect rest. Rest which one feels that
comes from returning health. I rested well
and my sleep was sound.
I began at once to sleep well and slept well
as long as I used the pills.
I can say for all who are suffering from
any of above complaints that it gave me re
lief, and I feel it a duty to recommend it to
all, feeling sure that it does all that is claimed
for it.
(Signed), A. T. Wilcox.
Subscribed in my presence and sworn to be

An analysis of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills

THAT INK WILL.
How Its Mysterious Disappearance
Is Accounted For by the
Craven Side.
' Mrs. Craven's partial story of the two j
wills said to have been written in her I
home at 2007 California street, on Septem
ber 24, 1894, by Senator Fairâ one in pencil
and one in ink â has whetted curiosity to ;
know what eventually became. of the ink i
will, which has gone mysteriously out of |
sight.
> The mystery is m part cleared away by
one who is familiar with the details of
Mrs. Craven's journey to and from New
York, and who related them yesterday to I
a Call reporter.
Mrs. Craven started for New York on '
February 25, 1895, to get the will of Sep
tember 24, 1894, which, with other docu
ments concerning her relations with the j
dead millionaire, she had - sent to her j
daughter Margaret, who was then on tho
stage in New York. All these documents
were in one package, and no one, outside j
of Mrs. Craven, at the time she left here
knew that there were duplicate willsâ one ;
in ink and one in pencil. She traveled
Enst under the name of Mrs. J. S. Cameron.
Arrived at New York she was laid low
by la grippe. Meanwhile Reuben H. Lloyd, |
who was carrying on - the negotiations |
with Stephen Roberts for possession of the ;
will, was on tenter hooks. Judge Slack j
had set the hearing for the probating of '
the will of September 21, 1894, known as I
the trust will, for March 18, 1895, and had j
declared that no further continuance
would be conceded. It was therefore of '
the utmost importance to have the holo- j
graphic will in court on that day, in order
to have proper grounds fora contest to the
trust will. At Mr. Lloyd's anxious solicita- j
tion Roberts sent urgent telegrams to Mrs. j
Craven to bring or send on the will.
Against the orders of her physician, !
Mrs. Craven got up from her sickbed and |
prepared to make the westward journey.
But she feared she would not be able to go
through on time, so she arranged with a
friend in New York named Mulholland to
have a friend of Mulholland's, named
Tichner, meet her at Chicago and take the I
will on to San Francisco, in case she was i
unable to proceed. The Chicago man was :
to recognize her by a handkerchief she
was to display on her bosom. She as
sumed the name of Mrs. Knox on her
westward trip. She forgot the prearranged j
sign, but Tichner found her and asked her j
if she was Mrs. Knox. On receiving an j
affirmative reply, he announced he was
Mulholland's friend and asked her pleas
ure.
She intrusted the ink will to him. and \
together they continued toward San Fran
cisco, she being continually confined to
her stateroom. She saw Tichner at inter
vals during the journey, but ior the last
time at Reno. Since then neither she nor
her attorneys nor Mr. Roberts have seen
the ink will or Mr. Tichner.
When Mrs. Craven arrived here and
found that the ink will was missing she |
produced the pencil document, and this
was the first knowledge her counsel or
others had that there were duplicates of
the testament of September 24, 1894,. in ex
istence. :â ,:' ..;-â ' - . ' ; .*-\:" ii ' : s-'' l V

NEW PICTURES OF THE PARIS SALONS.
SEVEN CURIOSITIES OF THE GOLDEN STATE.
All the usual features and a good many new ones.
"THE CALL"~SPEAKS FOR ALL,
they have no doubt that in some way the
Fair people learned of the transfer of the
will to be made at Chicago and arranged
to get possession of the will by having a
detective assume the part of Mulholland's
friend. The production of the pencil will,
however, obviated the necessity of using
the ink document, so that paper was never
brought to light, they assert."
They say further that the reason for the
extraordinary course pursued by the Pair
heirs to secure possession of the ink will
was that they feared Mrs. Craven would
ask an extravagant price before she would
consent to produce it. Had there been no
pencil original the ink will, they say,
would have been produced by the other
side and its peculiar procuration treated
as a good joke. As things turned out,
however, there was no need, it is claimed,
for the Fair side to show their hand in the
matter at all.
Such is the history of the duplicate
wills, Mrs. Craven's notable trip to New
York and back and of the mysterious dis
appearance of the ink will.
SOME LEGAL PHASES.
The Status of Things Should Mrs.
Craven Prove Her Claim to
Be Fair's Widow.
Speculation was rife yesterday as to the
exact status of Mrs. Craven and the wills
and deeds in relation to the Fair estate
should marriage be proved between Mrs.
Craven and the late Senator Fair.
Many believed that as the widow of the
deceased millionaire Mrs. Craven would
be entitled to one-third of the estate, in
view of the fact that she was not men
tioned in any of the wills of Fair. One of
her own counsel is authority for the state
ment, however, that she can claim noth
ing from the estate, as it is all composed
of separate property, and Fair had the un
questioned right to dispose of it by will as
lie saw fit.
It was further stated that the gift deeds,
though made in favor of Mrs. Craven, car
ried title to that lady even though her real
name might be Mrs. Fair. The law sfmply
takes cognizance of ttie intent of tne
grantor, and if Mrs. Fair can prove her
identity as jVJr.9. Craven, her title to tae
property conveyed to Mr.. Craven will be
unquestioned.
One important legal complication may,
however, arise in connection with the
secrecy maintained relative to tne alleged
marriage. If Senator Fair conveyed any
real estate since the date of the alleged
marriage contract and that document is
proved genuine, the grantee may_ iind
some difficulty in passing title without
securing the signature of Mrs. Fair to the
d eeds of conveyance.
Her signature is not absolutely necessary
to such deeds, but the wife's signature is
generally required, even when separate
property is conveyed, in order to prevent
any possibility of the claim being set up
that the property was a gift, as the hus
band has no right to make a gift of prop
erty though it be separate without the con
sent of his wife.
Senator Fair, it is stated, desired to
make a legacy to Mrs. Craven in the will
of September 24, 1895, but she objected.
In order, however, to Drovide for her after
his death it is claimed he deeded her the
Sansome street and the Mission street
properties.
It has been reported that Mrs. Craven
has deeds on other real estate now in
ventoried as part of the Fair estate, but
this is denied by one of her attorneys. The
only deeds she has are the two that were
recorded so sensationally iast week.

PAINE'S CELERY COMPOUND.
The Best Remedy in the World-
It Makes People Well.
There is one true specific for diseases
arising from impure blood and a debili-
tated nervous system, and that is Paine's
celery compound, so generally prescribed
.by physicians. It is probably the most
remarkable remedy that the scientific re-
search of this country has produced.
Prof. Edward E. Phelps, M.D., 1.L.D.,
of Dartmouth College, first prescribed
what is now known the world over as
Paine's celery compound, a positive cure
for dyspepsia, biliousness, liver com-
plaint, neuralgia, rheumatism, all nervous
diseases and kidney troubles. For the
latter Paine's celery compound has suc-
ceeded again and again where everything
else has failed.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The much-talked-of fistic encounter be
tween Corbett and Sharkey is now a thing
of the past, at least so far as a four-round
bout is concerned. The pugilists are now
matched to fight to a finish "somewhere,"
but like many other battles that have
been made of the same nature, it is doubt
ful if sueii a contest will ever take place.
However, if Corbett and Sharkey will ever
enter the ring for a finish fight the sailor
must greatly improve in his style of de
liverinp blows and use better judgment as
to distance; otherwise Corbett will blind
him before five rounds are fought. Cor
bett will cut out an altogether different
method of attack to that which he em
ployed in the Pavilion. Of course, he will
also be in better condition.
The oaremen of the City are a strange
lot. Some of the crews have now refused
to participate in the Stockton regatta be
cause they anticipated defeat. They
should organize a kindergarten society
and drink the blood of the Mexican bull,
which will give them pluck and renewed
confidence in their prowess.
The wheelmen will engage in several
road races to-morrow.
Baseball is growing popular and a boom
in the National game is gradually devel
oping.
Anpline, shooting, coursing, etc., are
pastimes which have many votaries.

There are three big road races, a barbe
cue at Mayfield, and the usual number of
club runs to attract the club wheelmen to- I
morrow, and things are altogether so
lively in cycling matters just now it re
minds one of a year ago when, at the
height of the season, there was a continual
list of these events every Sunday for
months. Only during the past month has
the sport picked up to any appreciable ex- {
tent, but there was enough enthusiasm ;
manifested over the races last Sunday to j
give promise of this year not being so very
dull after all, and the many events sched
uled for to-morrow and trips planned for
several weeks ahead go to show that July
will also be a lively month for the .wheel
men.
Of course the most interest naturally at
taches to events that are at hand, hence
the consequent impression that more at
tention is being paid to the Olympic, Bay
City and San Francisco clubs' road races j
to-morrow than to the league meet at .
Pe:a!uma on July 4. But in reality every 1
wheelman hereabouts who belongs to the
league or to a club, and many of the un
attached riders as well, expects to go to
Petaluma next Friday night or Saturday
morning, for the two days entertainment
arranged for them is far too attractive a
programme to be missed and, under the
circumstances, Petaluraa will be just the
place to spend the 4th and sth this year.
The league meet this year is in charge of
the Petaluma Wheelmen, and their very
enthusiasm and activity in making ar
rangements, and their efforts to do every
thing in their power to make the meet a 1
success and insure visiting wheelmen an
enjoyable time, has been the impetus
which has induced all the big City clubs,
as well as those of Oakland and San Jose,
to go there in as large numbers as possible
and try to "own the town" for a couple of
days at least, a privilege which the Peta
lumans assure them they will not be de
nied. Much credit is due F. K. Lippitt, ;
F. A. Wickersham, L. C. Byce, Thomas !
Macleay, Mr. McNear and other prominent i
members 01 the club there lor the prepara
tory work which has been done, for which
they can show a splendid track, a long list
of races with valuable prizes, and a pro
gramme of entertainment second to none
that has ever been offered at any league
meet held in the State heretofore.
Petaluma has now the finest quarter
mile track in the State. It was a good |
track last year, but the banks have been
raised four feet, making it safer and faster
for the riders. A new grand stand has
been erected to accommodate 800 people,
making the seating capacity of the
grounds about 2500. The reporters' stand
has been enlarged and moved nearer the
track. It is just in front of the grand
stand and the press representatives will
nave about the best seats on the grounds.
The entries for the races closed last night
and show a large number of contestants.
Handicapper Smyth will announce the
' handicaps early next week. There are six
teams entered in the tandem race and a
large number of crack professionals in the
races in that class. Numerous inquiries
have been made in regard to prizes for
broken records, and the management an
nounce that this only applies to the races
and was put in for the purpose of induc
ing the men to use extra exertions to
make fast time.
A. M. Boyden (Reliance), R. E. Dow and
Oscar Osen (Olympic Cyclers), F. M.
Byrne (Imperial), professional riders, and j
C. M. Ackerraan, H. Martin, Haynes, E. |
A. Allen and Mark Simmons of the Peta
luma \\ heelmen, amateurs, are in active
training at the track, working out twice a ]
day, at 11 a. m. and 2:30 p. M. The other !
professionals are expected up next Mon- I
day ana the amateurs later, in the week. '
The "pros." are well pleased with the |
track and say it is very fast, and that if
some records are not broken it will be no
fault of the track. Frank Byrne rode a
mile the other day in 2:20 and was very
much surprised when told his time, as he
said he did not think he was going faster
than a 2:30 gait.
There will be ample accommodations for
visitors. As to lunch on the Fourth, !
nearly every church in town will set a |
chicken dinner in the business part of \
town, so that all will be well fed.- Hotel j
accommodations will be no higher than at !
any other time. Members of the League I
of American Wheelmen get free admission !
to the races and other features of the
meet and reduced rates at the hotels. '
Trains leave this City Friday night at 3:30
and 5 o'clock via Tiburon ferry, the round
trip being $150. Tickets. on Saturday

Monday; round trip $1. A special train
will leave Petaluma Saturday night at 9
o'clock, arriving here at 10:30, to accom

evening.
Henry F. Wynne of the California
Cycling Club, and chairman of the high
way improvement committee of the
League of American Wheelmen in this
State, took a ''spin" last Friday, Satur
day and Sunday that covered considerable
ground. Mr. Wynne is an enthusiastic
good-roads advocate, and naturally took
minute notice of the condition^ of the 1
roads he traveled, and the memorandum j
of his trip which he gave to me is especi
ally valuable to any one who has only a
few days to spend on vacation and would
like to spend them awheel. Mr. Wynne
said :
Mrs. Wynne did the pacing, while yours
truly did the following with the luggage. We
left San Francisco Friday at 5:30 a. m. from
Twenty-second and Folsom streets and picked
up Lausuetin of the Bay City Wheelmen at the
Sierra Point House, a :ew miles out on the San
Bruno road. He rode with us to San Jose,
where we arrived at 10:30 a.m. (fifty mileÃ),
having consumed sixty-five minutes In stop
fniges at intermediate points. We remained
at San Jose until 1 :15 p. M., when we went
south to Gilroy, where we arrived at 3 p. m.
(thiriy miles), having Rtopped ten minutes at
both Coyote and Madrone. At Gilroy we re
mained until 3:30 p. m., and then proceeded
to Sargent's Station, where we stopped forty
fiye minutes looking through Camp Sargent.
We then resumed our journey to ban Juan,
where we arrived at 5:30 p. m., having covered
ninety-four miles in twelve hours' time, or
seveD hours and thirty-five minutes actual
riding time. Much to our astonishment we
had a head wind from Gilroy to San Juan.
At 7:30 o'clock Saturday morninc we left San
Juan and proceeded over a rolling road
through hot canyons to Watsonville, where we
arrived at 9:15 a.m. After a stop of twenty
five minutes we resumed to Aptos, Soquel and
Sania Cruz, where we arrived exactly at noon,
having covered thiny-seven miles. We re
mained at Santa Cruz until Sunday at 6:20
a. m. (taking in the Venetian water carnival),
when we took the narrow-^auge train to Los
Gatos. At 8:30 a. m. we left Los Gatos and pro
ceeded home via Redwood City, arriving at 3
p.m., having covered fifty-four miles in the
whole time of six and a half hours, and the
actual riding time of four hours and fifty-five
minutes, the time of stoppage being one hour
and thirty-five minutes.
Mrs. Wynne's machine was geared to seventy.
We had a thoroughly enjoyable trip, found the
roads gpod except that portion between San
Juan and Watsonville. From Watsonville to
Santa Cruz the roads, under the care of Super
visors Linscott and Stan ton, we found of mod
ern construction and well cared for.
While the route traveled by us is a more
roundabout way of reaching Santa Cruz, it bas
several advantages over the Los Gatos. Hotel
de Redwood and Soquel or Mount Charley
routes, inasmuch as the roads are rideable the I
entire distance and there are no mountains,
the worst grade being no greater than the six- ,
mile hill, with which we are all familiar. No j
forcing of pace was attempted, and the ride
shows what a good lady rider can do easily if I
she has good roads.
Almost every wheelman we met in Santa ;
Cruz reported the mountain roads very rough j
and dusty, and nearly every one recounted a
minor accident due to the wheel getting away
on the steep grades. The route we selected
would make an excellent tandem trip.
You might call this our summary: First
dayâ 94 miles; whole time, 12 hours; actual
riding time, 7 hours 35 minutes. Second dayâ
37 miles; whole time, 4)4 hours: actual riding
time, 3 hours 35 minutes. Third dayâ s4
miles; whole time, 6% hours; actual riding
time, 4 hours 55 minutes. Yours sincerely,
Hen by F. Wynnb.
The Pacific Cycling Club held an elec
tion of officers last Monday evening, with
the following result: President, Frank
Scott; vice-president, Alf. Bach; secre
tary-treasurer, Charles W. Etting; cap
tain, Lawrence W. Pryor; first lieutenant,
H. Plagemann. Captain Pryor has called
a run" of the club for to-raonow to
Bolinas.
A. B. Post and George H. Frost, of the
Crown City Cycling Club, Pasadens, ar
rived here Thursday on a wheeling trip,
and will remain about a week. They en
joyed the ride very much, and will return
the same way, by the coast route, in about
a week. Mr. Frost is an old-time wheel
man, and has been a member of the
L. A. W. for eleven years, his number
being 2883.
The Liberty Cycling Club will have s
run to-morrow to Mayfield, under Captain
Beattie, and will elect officers at a meeting
next Tuesday evening.
Secretary-treasurer Wells of the Oregon
division of the league is in the City on a
visit. He will attend the league meet at j
Petaluma on July 4. The Oregon division I
is but a few months old now and nas a j
membership of nearly 300, which is con
stantly increasing.
Henry Meyer and Matt Lindsay have
returned from a two weeks' trip to the i
Yosemite Valley. They are well satisfied
with the trip, though finding some of the
roads rather rough for wheeling.
The racing board has issued its bulletin
No. 16, dated June 26, 1896, as follows:

To-morrow the Camera Club Cyclists,
under Cap'ain Argenti, will take the 7
a. m. broad-gauge boat and train to Mar
tinez, and ride from there to Walnut
Creek, a short trip, where they wiil visit
the Bancroft ranch and enjoy a bullshead
breakfast and the usual accessories. Last
evening the ciub had a moonlight run to
the park, but owing to the fog and cloudi
ness the most imporan' feutnre of the
run â the moon â was absent.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen held a
very successful road race last Sunday
from Fruitvale to San Leandro, but
through a difference between the starttr's
watch and those at the finish the times
were incorrectly given out. The following
is the corrected table, which shows that
several of the men made far better time
than was credited to them :
The racing season has not yet advanced
far enough to give any sort of definite idea
as to who the champion is likely to be,
but thus far it seems as though Bald and
Cooper had the best of matters. Probably
both of these riders have already discov
ered that professionalism is not exactly
"a bed of roses," and that the men they
have to contend with are not awed by
these two old class B cracks, as their antago
nists seemed to be last year, but are doubly
anxious to shut them out on every possi
ble occasion and show them that there are
a few tricks of the trade which they have
not learned.
It isn't at all unlikely, and would be
only a case of what has been often seen in
the past, if some rider who has been meet
ing with varying success should suddenly
develop into a phenomenon and beat them
all out before the closing of the season.
An occurrence of this kind would make
racing more interesting than ever, and
perhaps bring forth time results heretofore
thought of as impossible.
On the other side of the water Tom Eck
seems to be meetine with less success
than anticipated. McDonald, who was
not in good form at any time last year,
but nevertheless showed remarkable
speed on several occasions, notably at As
bury Park, is doing very well and after be
coming thoroughly acclimated, in good
trim and used to foreign tracks and meth
ods may surprise even the most hopeful.
The Bay City Wheelmen will have a run
next Wednesday to Mative Sons' Hall to
attend the benefit tendered Robert Mitch
ell, the popular amateur minstrel, who
met with a painful accident recently. The
Olympic Cyclers, Olvmnic Club Wheel
men, Corintnian Yacht Club, Mission Par
lor, N. S. G. \Y\, and other organizations
are aho interested and will attend en
masse.
It seems now that Ziegler admits that
Cooper did not purposely or otherwise foul
him in that celebrated race at Cincinnati
last month. If any fouling was done it
was by Grant, but Ziegler has not pressed
the charge and is desirous that no blame

ANGLING.
San Andreas Lake Will Be Opened
on Wednesday Next.
Anglers will be pleased to learn that the
San Andreas Lake will be opened to the
disciples of Walton on July 1, and it goes
without saying that some royal good
sport awaits all those who will be so for
tunate as to receive an invitation to angle
from Charles Webb Howard, the president
of the Spring Valley Water Company.
Gentlemen who have recently enjoyed
an outing on this beautiful sheet of water
are profuse in their praises of the sport
theyhad in hooking, playing and landing
the garaest ot all anadromous fishes â the
steelhead. True, the steelhead is a fish
which at this season of the year will seek
saline waters for various reasons. In the
first place when the sweet waters of the
rivers and lakes are wanned by the heat
of the sun wiiich lias full play during the
dry summer season, the steelhead is at
tacked by what is termed a fresh water
parasite and to rid it3elf of this trouble
some visitor it repairs immediately to the
cool and deep water of the ocean if the op
portunity permits.
During winter, when the steelhead is on
its journey from oid ocean to the spawn
ing beds at the headwaters of coast
streams, it is again attacked by salt-water
parasites, whicu remain fast to its gills
and fins until the silvered denizer of the
deep enters an estuary at the mouth ot
some river which empties into the ocean.
It is therefore not to be surprised that
some of the large steelheads of the lakes
are at this season of the year annoyed by
parasites. The fishes would certainly
seek the cool water 3of tne ocean if they
had an opportunity, but being land
locked their only hope for relief is by
scratching their bouies and fins on the
rocks which line the sides of the lake.
Professor Jordan, H. F. Emeric and
other noted authorities on fishes and fish
culture are of the opinion that tde Loch
Leven trout and the trout of European
waters, commonly known as the brown or
Yon Behr trout, would thrive and do re
markably well in any of the lakes of the
Spring Valley Water Company, as they
are not tlassified among the anadronious
fishes, such as salmon, steel heads, etc.
John Gallagher of Oakland, a most ar
dent angler, by the way, is at present rus
ticating at Prattville. He has written to
John Butler that angling in the Big Mead
ows country will not be at its prime until
next month. He says that the trout run
very large, some reaching as many as
eight pounds. He anticipates having gala
sport in July.
The Truckee and other rivers on the
east side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains
are running very high at present and
anglers who have recently returned state
that trout fishing will not be good this
year until the latter part of July. Good
sport can now be expected at Inde
pendence, Dormer and Webber lakes,
which beauty spots have only recently
been opened to anglers.
Al Cumming, the champion long-dis
tance fly-caster of Fruitvale, and Captain
Finch, the champion caster of Sausalito
for delicacy and accuracy, will leave this
City to-morrow evening for Truckee.
Cumming will journey to Dormer Lake
and Finch wiil try his luck on Lake In
dependence.
John Butler and a friend will have a
whip at San Andreas Lake on Sunday.
They will be joined by Fred Venker and
company.
John Siebe ana Albert Wieland have
returned from their trip around the world.
Siebe is replete with fish and fowl stories.
Messrs. Mansfield and Bogart enjoyed
some very good trout fishing last Sunday
at the headwaters of the BiÂ« Sulphur
Creek, which empties into the Russian
River near Cloveruale.
Splendid trout fishing is reported near
Boonville, in Mendocino County.
The Fly-casting Club will meet this
afternoon on Stowe Lake.
Johrr P. Reynolds left on Saturday to
teach the anglers of Glen Ellen a trick or
two in trout fishing.
The following letter from Commodore
James Wftutt, is self-explanatory:
James A. Pariser fished the Calaveras Creek
last Sunday wiih very i oor success; in W,
he admitted that he aid not get one n ;lxâ
fishermen, as a rule, are not quite so truthful
as Mr. Pariserâ but then, this is his first sea
son. Mr. Pariser tried all kinds of bait, such
as worms, shrimps, chubs, meat and salmon
roe (prepared by John Butler, the salmon-roe
specialist) and still he failed to get a fish. He,
however, succeeded in procuring a coon, which
folipwed him along the stream for miles, prob
ably attracted by the variety of bait which he
carried with him. Pn riser tried to hook the
coon several times, but eventually had to ask
\\ ill Bain, a companion, to dispatch him,
which Bain did.
Pariser brought the coon to town Monday
morning, saying that he had a friend who un
derstood cooking coons, and that he would
have coon steaks, coon roasts, coon stews, etc.,
for the balance of the week.
Mr. Pariser has not been seen at his office or
around town for the past few days, but as he
lives in Alameda, his friends on this side ot
the bay have not learned the cause of his ab
sence.
BASEBALL.
J!m Corbett Will Play First Base
With the Pacifies at the Presidio.
Lovers of good baseball will be treated
to a first-class game to-morrow (Sunday)
afternoon at the Presidio athletic grounds
between the Pacifies and Californians.
Judging from the makeup of the teams
it is safe to say that a close and excitine
game will result. The champion pugilist
of the world, James J. Corbett, will nlay
first base, and if he succeeds in hitting
the leather as hard a smash as he gave
Tom Sharkey in the first round of his
ficht, when he raised a shanty over
Tom's right optic, it will needs be a pretty
high fence to stop the ball from taking a
dip in the ocean.
Corbett is, however, a pretty good ball
player and will doubtless make a most
favorable impression on the spectators as
a batsman.
The line up is as follows:

the latter place the San Joses will meet
the Stockton team.
The Folsom-street grounds are splend
idly equipped. There is a neat and com
modious grand stand built in a semi
circle and so arranged that everything
that taKes place on the field can be plainly
seen from every seat.
The grounds themselves have been pre
pared regardless of expense. Nothing that
would contribute to the smoothness and
general utility of their make-up has been
omitted. A convenient and fully fitted up
dressing-room for the players has also
been proviaeJ.
The opening game in this City will be
between the Oaklands and San Franciscos.
In the two clubs are many old-time favor

fame will be seen on third base for the men

Crews That Will Not Take Part In
the Stockton Regatta.
To-morrow at 12:30 o'clock at tne foot
of Chestnut street, Alameda, the Ala
meda Boating and Swimming Club will
have a rowing regatta.
It has completed all preparations for
the event, and the original entry list, as
appeared exclusively in Sunday's Call,
still remains intact.
The offic/als of the day's sport are as fol
lows: Referee, Al Rodgers; judges, J. A.
Sansom and A. Schumacher; timer, J.
Conro; marshal, F. Mundwyler; starter,
S. W. Creigh.
Rowing is enjoying an era of prosperity
at the Aiameda Club. At present they
have not enough boats to satisfy the row
ing propensities of the members, and will
soon place orders lor many new boats.
Following is a list of applicants for mem
bership at the next regular meeting: P.
Steinmeitz, Samuel Marston, Roger Chev
elier, Louis Chevelier, Walter Canning
and James Scott.
From present indications it looks as if
the Stockton regatta on July 4 will be
robbed of one of its most important fea
tures. A senior four-oared barge race, in
which were entered the South End crew
(the champions of the coast), the Stockton
Giants, and a crew from the Pioneer Row
ing Club, was down on the programme,
but it is very doubtiul if it will take place.
The Pioneer and South End crews have
stopped training, but the Stockton crew is
still smashing away at the oars, and in the
event of neither of the local crews lining
up the Stockton crew will claim the race
by default.
The management of the regatta had
counted on this race as one of the draw
ing cards, and the Stockton people were
more than anxious to see the crew from
their city line up with the local cham
pions.
But the home oarsmen say "nit," they
won't row for a cup; but tnis seems to be a
case of 'possum. The same crews have
rowed for cups before, and there is no rea
son why they should refuse to race again.
There are many who think that the local
men are actually afraid of the Stockton
crew and don't liKe to tackle it in its pres
ent condition, for the Stockton boys are
known to be in great form, while the
barge crews here are comparatively in no
form at all.
DupHssea, the stroke of the South End
crew, will row a single-scull race before
going into the barge event, and the rest of
the crew, it is thought, are afraid to row
the race, thinking that Duplissea will be
too pumped out and in no condition to put
up a speedy stroke.
The South End Club at its recent meet
ing tried hard to induce the boys to row,
regardless of defeat or victory, and offered
to pay their expenses while at Stockton,
Dut Captain MacArtuur said that they will
row on September 9 only.
The Pioneer crew had been training
hard, but when the club said it couldn't
afford to pay the boys' expenses at Siock
ton, the crew quit work.
John T. Sullivan, the shoe-dealer, came
to the rescue and offered to pay all the
crew's expenses and put up $500 besides
that they could defeat either the South
End or Stockton crews, but the Pioneers
had knocked off training for a week, and
they say they didn't like to risk a defeat
owing to lack of condition.
This is just the reason why the Fourth
of July committee will have nothing to do
with rowing regattas, as it cannot depend
upon the oarsmen to train properly and
race when the time comes for business.
The senior single scull event will have
to be rowed in boats, owing to the large
entry list, and the narrowness of the
Stockton Channel.
McCausland is rowing better now than
when He rowed at El Carapo, and sa^s if
he wins he will immediately get to work
for his race with Johnson at the coning
Victoria regatta.
Duplissea is working like a beaver, *nd
his left wrist, which failed him in the El
Campo race, has been materially strength
ened by the use of wrist machines.
Jim Wilson and Bob Ellis, the Aries'
skiff men, are in excellent form, and if
the club enters J. R. Bockmanu or N. J.
Prendergast in the junior outrigger skiff
event, it will be well represented at Sto n
ton, and ought to carry off the lion's shire
of the prizes.
In spite of the fact that the Pioneers aid
South End clubs will not have t c pleas
ure of seeing their respective senior crevs
settling an old grudge tliey expect just 13
much rivalry to exist in the junior four
oared race.
Jack Coughlin has been training regu
larly for this regatta from the Dolphin
Boat Club, and as he is their only entry he
is receiving considerable encouragement
irom his club mates, Coughlin has de
feated S. J. Pembroke of the Alameda
Club, and at present ho is the champion
skiff rower of the coast, and will have con
siderable bacKing to win at Stockton.
An accident happened to C J. Flanders'
launch just as she was about to pull out
on her trip up the river.
Ever since the engine was set in place
Flanders could not <;et it to work properly.
He was about to return the en. me East,
where it was built, and get a new one when
George Wood bury, a 16-year-old boy and
an inventor of an electric bike and builder
of an engine and boiler, examined it and
in a very few hours all was sunshine, for
he s;ot the engine in good working order
and was taken along on the trip to act as
chief engineer. Ho will undoubtedly run
the launch in the launch race at the Stock
ton regatta.
THE GUN.
Poachers Killing Doves and Deer
In Marln and Mendocino.
To-morrow the Empire Gun Club will
hold its monthly inanimate target contests
at Alameda Point, and on the same day
the inter-club team shoot will be decided
on the Empire grounds.
The Pacific Tournament Association,
which is composed of several gun clubs,
will meet on July 4 and 5 at its new
grounds, Alameda Point. Clarence A.
Haight is the general manager and Edgar
Foster has been appointed manager of the
shooting events. The programme of the
first day reads: A ten-bird race, en
trance 50 cents, four moneys; ten-bird
race. 75 cents entrance, six moneys and
$10 added; twenty-bird race, $1 entrance,
$15 added; twenty-bird race, club team
shoot of six men ; the final event will be a
twenty-bird race, entrance $1. The en
trance fee includes price of birds in each
event. In class shooting all ties will be
divided. Each team entry must consist
of members of a club in good standing. A
splendid lunch will be served on the
grounds and this fact al<>ne should guar
antee excellent shooting, as wnen the
"inner" man is made happy the "outer"
man should have his eye open to business.
In the second day of the tournament
there will be a ten, three fifteen-bird and
two twenty-bird races open, all of which
will terminate with a fifteen-bird club
team event. A first-class time is promised
all shooters and sportsmen who will be
present on this occasion.
On July 5 the California Wing Club will
meet at the old grounds of San Bruno,
where, in byjrone days, many close finishes
resulted in open shoots between men who
were in those times ranked as the leading
live-bird shots of the State.
Sportsmen will remember that on July
lit will be lawful to kill doves. The birds
are said to be very plentiful this year in
some parts of the Livermore Valley.
The season when male deer can 69 killed
will commence on July 15 and end on
October 15. Apropos of deer-shootlnsr, it is

the game laws as true sportsmen should,
that the Fish and Game Commissioners
will deputize a{ least one ot their deputies
to scour the hills of Marin County, be
tween San Rafael and Petaluma, as quite
a number of deer have been killed during
the past two weeks. A letter from a mem
ber of the Sportsman's Club of Point
Arena to the sporting editor of The Call
states that campers near the Gnalala
River have been killing a number of deer
during tbe past month, ana that one party
of six men slaughtered twenty-six deer in
one week just for the fun of killing them.
The club has employed a constable to visit
the camps, and if any deer meat is found
in the possession of the "pleasure-hunters"
the Doachers wiil be made to pay dearly
for their sport.
The season for the killing of grouse and
mountain quail will commence on the
IMb, of August and end on the 15th of
February.
Markat-hunters are killing young ducks
in the tules about the Sacramento and San
Joaquin rivers. But as there are no
officers detailed to protect the game, the
slaughter will go merrily on.
It is well known that deer when hard
pressed will often take to water, and stags
sometimes come to bay in a depth suffi
cient to bother hounds, but not too deep
to allow of free play for the antlered head.
But the doe pursues different tactics. She
will crouch under water until only her
nostrils are above the surface, and thereby
entirely battle the pack unless a keen-eyed
huntsman detects the ruse.
The following is self-explanatory:

Notes of the Game From Home
and Foreign Fields.
Never before has cricket advanced with
such ftiant strides in America as it has this
Feast i. From New York, Philadelphia
and other centers an avalanche of news
has reached us, showing the greatly in
creased interest in the same.
W. R. Gilbert, a cousin of W. G. Grace,
is now engaged as a professional by the
Montreal Club.
At Philadelphia, on the 13th inst., two
matches were played for the local cham
pionship, tbe Germanrown defeating the
Pelmont eleven by 206â122, while the
game between tne Merion and Philadel
phia clubs remained unfinished. The
Merions made 325, and the Ph,iladelphias
had scored 46 for three wickets.
The Harvard College team sailed from
Philadelphia, Pa., for Europe June 13, on
the steamer Belgeuland. The team in
cluded J. A. Lester, captain; D. H. Adams,
C. R. Hincnman, J. H. Scatter? od, L. H.
Wood, C. H. Howson, A. B.'M:iSin, T.
"Wistar. A. F. Cocoa, A. C. Thomas, C. G.
Tatnall, A. M. Collins, A. G. Scattergood
and A. Haines. Henry Cope, a graduate,

games have been scheduled abroad, the
tour opening June 29, 30 at Cheltenham,
with the Cheltenham college team, and
terminating August 24, when the visitors
will play an eleven of Cambridge Univer
sity at Cambridge, England.
A team of colored cricketers contended
with the first eleven of the Manhattan
Club at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, and by
their dilatory tactics in sending their men
into bat, wasted time, and co succeeded
in turning a virtual defeat into a drawn
game. The Manhattan team declared
â¢their innings closed after securing 138 for
5 wickets. The colored team had lost 9
wickets for 71 at the call of time.
W. G. Grace went in first and carried his
bat out for 243 of a total of 483, made by
Gloucestershire against Bussex, May 25,
26, 27, at Brighton, Eng., it being the
twelfth time that the champion batsman
has scored 200 and over in an inning of a
first-class match.
Bicycle riders have encroached so much
on the space reserved for cricket at Pros
pect Park,' Brooklyn, N. V., as to materi
ally interfere with" the game. A petition
na.Â« been signed by thousands of lovers of
ti.e game asking the Park Commissioners
to abate the nuisance.
Gerald Herbslet, the actor and ex-mem
ber of the Lake County team, is now in
England and keeping wicket for the Folk
stone Cricket Club.
C. W. Lawrence, formerly of the Ala
medas and now captain of the Portland
(Or.) Cricket Club, has sent a challenge to

ground toward the end of the season.
I hear that J. J. Moriarty has resigned
from the Alameda Club and has applied
to the association for permission to.play
with the Bohemians.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 25.â The shoot of
the Capital City Gun Club on Sunday will end
the trap-shooting of tbe season for this
locality. Last Sunday the Spoonbills held
their concluding match, the result beinij that
J. F. Fitzgerald won out with a score of 23.
The season's scores foot up as follows: Fitz

Eckhardt, Shore, Warner and Schwartz did
not participate in all the matches.
Considerable preparation is being made for
the opening of the dove season on July 1, al
though the cold weather, lasting as it did un
til the beginning of June, has made the sea
son late. The birds are still nesting in Sacra
mento, Yolo and San Joaquin counties, and
very few of the'young birds will be able to fly
when the season opens, and It is feared Unit
the killing of the old birds will injure the late
shooting. A sportsman from Placer County
reports that the birds began nesting early in
that vicinity and will be full fledged by the
middle oi July.
The Lincoln Gun Club will hold a live-bird
Bhoot on July 4 and several of the local talent
v, ill attend.
The Capital City Wheelmen have been prac
ticing hard for their track race with the Ter
minal City Wheelmen of Stockton, to come off
on the 4th, and will have a try-out on Sunday.
Leslie Young, one of the men who will ride in
the relay race, made a mile in 1:57, Zeigler's
record on the same track made two years ago
being 1 :5O, setting the record at that time. It
is expected thai there will be several hundred
wheelmen in line at the Capitol City Club's
'â¢lantern parade" to-niKht.
The Sacramento angler*, have become dis
gusted at their non-success on the trout
streams, and are scouring the neighboring
sloughs in search of blue cats. A large party
will make an excursion down the river on Sun

Maryavllle Sportinsr News.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., June 26.â Two years
ago in July the members of the Yuba,andSut
ter Gun Club entertained their friends with a
"dove stew" at Sheltons Grove. Pretty nearly
everybody in the two counties pretending to
know the difference between a hammerless
shotgun and a hole in the ground was there.
It was a great eventâ one of those rare occa
sions when every man loves his neighbor even
batter than himself. Just the mention of it is
sufficient to arouse a tender feeling of enthu
siasm even to this day. The gun club proposes
to repeat the affair tUis season, and July 19
has been selected as the date. The subscrip
tion list is now going the rounds, and as soon
as it has completed the circuit invitations will
be issued and other necessary formalities gone
through. There will be trap-shooting at live
birds and bluerocts, and it is expected that a
number of sportsmen will be present from Sac
ramento, San Francisco and other places ai a
distance.
The first section of the new bicycle path has
been completed. It is ten feet in width, a mile
and a half in length and runs along the sub
urban streets of the northern and western part
of the city. Work will be resumed soon after
the early fall rains and the path will be ex
tended to four and possibly seven miles before
tne opening of another cycling season. The
association now has a membership oi sixty and
is in a prosperous condition.
The Entre Nous Cycling Club is the latest or
ganization. It is composed of sixteen young
ladies, and their appearance on the streets
during the past week in uniforms of white and
blue attracted considerable attention.
There is some talk of laying out new base
ball grounds here. During the time when in
terest in the game was languishing Snowflake
Park, with its fences and buildings, was torn
down and the lots offered for sale. Now that
baseball is again popular the necessity of new
grounds and special accommodations is being
discussed and may very likeiy result in some
thing.

Frank A. Brush, cashier of the National
Bank of this city, is an enthusiastic sports

latest experiment in breeding is with the
Chinese pheasant. They are the ring-necked
variety known as the "Denny pheasant," and
were brought here from Oregon. The hens
wasted no time after their arrival, but com
menced laving their quarterly nest of fifteen
eggs. These have been set under domestic
hens and the chicks are expected shortly.
The youug birds will te used to stock the
Brush ranch of 6000 acres in Mendocino

would be an ideal place for the "Chinaman,"
were it not for the pot hunter and small boy.
The Board of Supervisors will bo asked to pass
a stringent protection law, and a club formed
for the purpose will endeavor to stock this
valley with these fine game birds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 27, 1896.
HARDSHIPS IN
ALASKA A MYTH,
Miners Do Better Than
They Could Any
where Else.
NONE COME OUT BROKE
So Says E. Valentine, Who Has
Lived at Juneau for the
Last Ten Years.
ONLY FOUR HAVE PEEISHED.
A Dollar Apiece for Letters to the
Yukon Mines â Sixty Wcmen at
Forty-Mils Camp.
E. Valentine, who has lived in Juneau,
Alaska, for the last ten years and has vari
ous business interests there, says that the
miners in that region, and particularly in
the Yukon gold fields "beyond the divide,"
have not suffered hardships.
He arrived from Alaska yesterday with
his wife and P. Narine, a miner who has
come to San Francisco for special treat
ment for his eyes, which were seriously in
jured in an explosion in tbe Mexican
mine on April 3 that killed one man and
injured four others.
The accident was caused by a miner
striking with his pick a stick of dynamite
that had failed to explode along with a
number of others grouped for a blast set
off a short time before.
"During all the years I have lived in
Juneau," said Mr. Valentine yesterday at
the Grand, "I never had a miner ask me
for anything to eat. It is wrong to sup
pose that they have suffered. With two
exceptions, Ido not think I ever saw a
man return to Juneau from 'beyond the
divide' with less than $50. And I have
seen miners come in with dust worth from
that amount all the way up to $40,000 or
$50,000.
"The two men that came out broke were
a couple of fellows I staked. They baa
bad luck. Their water-wheels were car
ried away in a freshet and they lost what
they had.
"The fact that the miners always go
back again speaks well for the Yukon
region. All of them do better than they
could in the same time anywhere else.
"Only four men have perished on that
trip since I have been in the country.
Two were old men in a party of four.
They became exhausted and lay down
and died. That was on tbe Hootelinka
river, about five years ago. Their sons
came out from Kansas some time after to
collect the bones, and buried them to sat
isfy tbe widows. The other two perished
early in February of this year, up near
Lake Teslin. The two Indian guides had
to abandon the white men in order to save
themselves, and as it was they killed and
ate their dogs before they were overtaken
by auother party. One of the unfortunate
men was a journalist, formerly employed
on the Alaska News.
"Twelve hundred people have gone
through Juneau in the last year bound for
the Yukon region. There must be 3000 or
4000 miners up there now. At the Forty
mile Camp there are sixty women. They
are getting modern conveniences up
there â billiard-tables and such things.
"Joe Cooper of Fortyrmile Camp was
down here a little while ago and bought a
saloon outfit. He said it would be worth
$40,000 when he got it home. He probably
paid about $500 for it here.
"A man came into Juneau the other day
with seventy-six pounds of gold dust, the
reault of two seasons in the Yukon region.
"Mail-carriers get $1 apiece for carrying
letters between Juneau and the Yufcon
mines. They usually malre up a package
of about 500 letters for a trip.
"Tbe miners that will stay in the region
can work up till the middle of October, but
those that are coming out will have to
quit work a month earlier in order tocross
the divide before the heavy snows.
"Juneau ia just as good a country aa I
want to live in. I like it as well as any
place I have ever seen, it rains a good
deal. The average rainfall is nine feet a
year. There is a fine miners' hospital
there conducted by Sisters of Charity.
The population is 3000, although most of
tbe men are away just now at Hundum, a
mining region sixty miles south of Juneau,
and at Berner's Bay, forty miles to the
north.
"The Basin mine, about four miles back
from Juneuu, is a good-paying invest
ment. There are four stamp mills there,
and a good deal of placer mining is done.
"On an island a mile across the channel
from Juneau is the great Treauwell mine
that paya $750,000 in dividends each year."
Mr. Valentine owns the steamer J. R.
Roberts, conducts the People's wharf, is a
member of the merchandise firm of Mat
thews, Valentine & Co., owns a jewelry
store and is treasurer of the Juneau Fire
Department. He will probably remain
here a month, as this i-s his first visit to
Ban Francisco.

The Sleeting of the National Council
In Denver a Few Days
Ago. : . .':,-:, : .
Henry C. Schaertzer of this City, State
Councilor of the Junior Order .of
United : - American Mechanics, returned
yesterday from attendance at the National
Council at Denver. ' The convention met
in that city June 16, with National Coun
cilor C. W. Tyler of ' Richmond, Va., in
the chair. The delegates from Jthe coun
cils of this State were D. S. Stanley, S. J.
Thiesen, George E. Terry, and Henry C.
Schaertzer as delegate at large. :.
From the reports submitted to the Na
tional Council it was learned that up to
the year ending December 31, 1895, the or
der numbered 166,833 members, which was
a gain of 13,141 for the year. This State
has 31 councils, with membership of 2950,
a gain of 7 councils and 1750 members for
the year.
During 1895 $467,138 10. had been paid
out in benefits and reliefâ s6o,7o6 more
than during the previous year. 'There is
now in the treasuries of subordinate coun
cils $1,432,636 52â a gain of $102,684 79 for
the year. â ;*>.:
The greatest State membership is in
Pennsylvania, which has 80,434, and New
Jersey is next, having 23,788; Maryland
has 14,964 and Ohio 14,089. â¢
The orphan asylum of the order at
Tiffin, Ohio, is almost ready for occupancy.
Its institution will cost over $100,000.
From time to time additions will be made
when needed. The institution is man
aged by a board of rive trustees, each under
a bond of $25,000. be municipal authori
ties of Tiffin donated the asylum a tract of
park land and remitted the taxes on the
entire establishment.
The new National officers are: Professor
P. A. Shauerof Slstersville, W. Va., coun
cilor; Joseph Powell of Denver, Colo.,
vice-councilor; Edward S. Deemer of
Philadelphia, secretary; J. Adam So hi of
Baltimore, treasurer; F. C. Borden of
Holden, Mo., National organizer.
The next session of the National Council
will be held in Pittsburg, and it is be
lieved that the session of 1899 will be held
in this City. However, it will rest with
the railroad companies. All of the dele
gates east of Denver received generous
special rates, but those west got no con
cessions from the transportation com
panies that dominate the Pacific Coast.

WHY IT_ CURES.
Reasons for the Phenomenal Cures
\ Reported by Patients. Using Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt. Nona
Too Sick and None Too Well to ;
Be Aided by This Wonderful
Remedy. . .-f ::

Why It Cures.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt iniuses a contlnu.
Btia flow of electricity Into the body for hours :
at a time. Every moment that the Belt is. on
the body its sparkling, vitalizing powers aro
felt penetrating the nerve tissues, filling them j
with new life, new, healthy vigor, and charg- j
ing the blood with the vital force which nature
in childhood bestowed upon the body. I When
the Kidneys, Liver, Stomach, Heart, Nerves
and Blood are charged with this life they throw
off disease and regain their healthy state. In
this way Dr. Sanden's Belt has cured thousands.
Why Medicine Fails.
Drugs areâ like whisky, only a temporary :
stimulant, a Dlind by which the weakened or- i
gans are put in a stupor to quiet their craving '<
for help; a temporary tonic which braces them
up for a short time and deserts them finally,
leaving them worse than before taking. This
is true of all drugs used to renew vitality. It i
does not renew strength because there is no
element in medicine to restore the power to ;
the nerves, upon which all vital organs live.
That nerve power is electricity. That is why
Dr. Sanden's Beit Cures.
The following are extracts from letters recently
received :
"I am a laboring man and for many years was a
sufferer from seminal weakness, which debilitated
me to a great extent, and up to tbe time I pur-
chased your Belt I was so weak that on many
occasions I would have to give up my work.. I
wore the Belt * continuously at night for tbree
months, and at the end of that time I was well and
strong. 1 cannot say too much in praise of your
Belt, and do not intend to part with mine the rest
of my lite, for it will make any man rest well."â
P. 11. Gale, lndio, Cal. -
"I would like to add my testimony to numerous
others In possession of Dr. SandÂ»a's Meetric Belt
Company, I purchased a .No, 7 Belt from Dr.
Kanden about the Ist of April, which I used ; ac-
cording to directions, and after three months' trial
I am hai>py to state that my varlcocele, which was
of twelve years' standing, is almost entirely dis-
appeared, my testicles belli? almost normal. I
take great pleasure in recommending this Belt to
any one suffering from like trouble. Hespectfully
yours, W. K. Johns, 1139 Market street, San Fran-
cisco, Cal." . . . .
"The Belt I got from you a little over a month
a','o is all you claim for it. It has done what no
other remedy would do fn my case. Thanking
you most sincerely, I remain respectfully yours,
Kichard Holmes, Soldiers' Home, '.Los Angeles
County, Cal." -, â¢ â¢ . ..
It Will Cure You, No Matter
How Bad Your Case.
None are too well to be aided : by this won-
.derful appliance, as it brings the human body
as near the goal of perfection in vital force
as it ever can get. None are too low to be
Aided by it, as it can take as a foundation thÂ«
smallest spark of vitality and build upon it the
fullest' perfection of vigorous manhood. If
you are weak, sick, or crippled, see this Belt at
once, and a test of its power and a look at the
volume after volume of proof of its cures will
convert yon to the altar of nature's truths, and
health will be yours from this Wonderful ap-
pliance. â¢ â  ;. .... - Â-,...

CANNED SALMON.
The Cutting Packing Company's circular Bays
ofstilmon: "Supplies of this article are small and
demand fairly The pack this spring on the
nemo has been of very insignificant propor
tion and disappointing to tlie paGfcWÃ, and dealers
have had no Increase of any moment to their de-
StOCkS from tills source.
â¢â¢The Alaska news is that up to last dates work
nt the various stations was progressing favorably,
though the spring was a late one and much ice at
quite a number of points up to the middle of May
and fish only just commencing to appear; no loss
01 canneries or vessels and all preparations mnde
for an active season as soon as fishing could bes:ln.
â¢â¢Â«ri!ish Columbia reports that no fishing Is yet
being done in its waters.
â¢â¢On the Columbia River the life this year of the
canner la no: a happy one, commencing the season
by making outlays for twine and neis, which were
advanced to the "tHhermc-n, who usually worked;
the canner now finds himself with this pear on
hand, with no chance to uselt, and his fishermen
in some cases refusing to Cm- unless paid 5 cents
a pound for fish, which puce is prohibitive, and
in other cases i he fishermen are willing to go to
work at â¢Â» cents a pound, but afraid of so doing.
With all of tills lessened packing the trade Is not
over hungry for Columbia River salmon, and the
price of the" canned .ir.ic c remains unchanged.
,\s this yoes to prim telegraphic advices from
Astoria are to the effect that a compromise hat
â¢V c M between fishermen and packers, and
the former are going to work on a basis of 4%
cents per pound for thsh caught."
Explanation.
ThÂ» arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
Cays; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*, I
4nring.thÂ« past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
Hats, connect points of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomDanied by fair weathe?: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
â¢nd accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows'" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interioi
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the caa.--t, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition* 1
will produce an opposite result-

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. June 26.â The industrials
again monopolized speculative attention at the
stock Exchange. Sugar was the leading feature
and on dealings of 137,(00 shares, ranged be
tween 113i4@116i4, closing at the top figure. j
Early cables reported the market for raws stronger |
than for a lone time, while at home the- refiners I
lifted prices all around, the advance extending
from 1/3 to i/4c per pourd. This movement was
entirely unexpected by stock operators and the
advance in the certificates of nearly three points
was due iD a great measure to covering for their
account. Tobacco and Leather preferred were
heavy, the former selling down from 65% cto
6Â»%c and the latter from 60% cto 57s/ 8 c
' rh â  break in tobacco was ascribed to the liqui
dation 01 a block of stock bought recently on the
belief that trie directors intended to resume divi
dends on the common slock. It is now stated that
action has been indefinitely postponed. The rail
way list was sustained at the opening by London
buying. Prices advanced fractionally on very
moderate transactions and then speculation in this
group came to a standstill. The announcement
thai tne radical silver men will control the Demo
cratic convention served to increase business.
When sugar rallied near the close the general
market responded in a feeble sort of way and
closed firm in tone.
Net changes show gains of Vs@% per cent out
side of Lake Shore and Sugar, which advanced
about 3 per cent. Tobacco and Leather lost 1@
18/s per cent. The total sales were 228,000 shares.
bonds were more active and firm: sales were
$919,000. Hocking Valley consol fives rose 1%

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lixi June 26.â The wheat market
began the session to-day at a decided di sadvan
tage, first prices being from 1.4 to S/ g under last
night- It was probably the want of courage and
confidence more than any distinctly bearish news
that rendered the tone so weak. However, if there
was nothing materially disappointing in the news
there was at the same time ho argument for im
provement. The trade resembled that of recent
days, the outside and general public being without
; interest and local scalpers furnishing the moderate
business.
Liverpool cables quoted %d decline. Receipts
in the Northwest were free at 416 cars, against
516 on last Friday and 159 a year ago Chicago re
ceived 5 cars, and inspected out 7300 bushels.
Crop news was. as a general rule, encouraging, the
weather was fine, and harvesting was said to be
progressing well, all of which tended to disconcert
j holders. Closing Continental cables were irregular.
Export clearances were large vi 535,219 bushels.
September wheat opened from 56 1 '2@563/gc, sold
between 56% c and 56V4@5ti3/ B e, closing at the in
side, 3,^'jj/jC under yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow, 11 cars.
CORNâ Fluctuations practically represented the
variations in the tone of wheat. Notuing that was
1 heard afforded any ground lor hope of better prices,
I the buying being principally by shorts and the
' firmness, which at times came from the demand,
' of an unsatisfactory sort. Receipts were fair at
i 381 cars, although sixty-nine less than expected.
i Withdrawals from store were quite large at 271,

DUN'S REVIEW OP TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 26.â R. G. Dun & Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
Failures for the week have been 217 In the United
Slates against 256 last year, and 24 in Canada
against 22 last year. The monetary- outlook la not
yet clear to some. The strength shown â in recent
conventions by advocates of silver coinage and
expectation that all . the elements favoring that
policy may . yet be concerted , incline , them to a
waiting attitude. Their uncertainty retards im
provement, notwithstanding the more widely prev
alent feeling that . the monetary action of , the St.
Louis convention will be sustained by the people.
But many mills h-'ve waited as long as they can
with safety, t vine* have' been given by
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATfJRDAT, JUNE 27, 1896.
enough cotton-mills of " Fall River to Insure a tem
porary stoppage, it is said, the nature of which is
now under discussion in conference with the Prov
idence manufacturers. . Woolen-mills are active
without concert, but fourteen ' are mentioned In
dispatches as having closed this week. There is
no similar movement in other industries, though
the period of summer closing is at hand in many
of them, and important controversies of iron pud
cilersnnci other hands make it likely that the an
nual stoppage in that industry may last longer
than usual. -
The weakness in wheat which has declined 2.10 c
and of cotton which is an eighth lower for spots
though less for futures, has full explanation in de
cidedly good crop prospects. It may be doubted
whether the boot and shoe industry has ever been
in better shape on the whole, though manufactur
ers complain that an advance in price is - neces
sary which dealers are very reluctant to pay.
Leather is slightly lower for kinds not controlled
by the leather company, and at Chicago packer
hides are steady while country have advanced a
shade, with small receipts. Copper is held at
$1175. Lead Is hardening at $ 3 06 and Ameri
can linplates are well sold at 15c below foreign.
The great combinations which the Iron Age
wisely reasons will cause disastrously low prices
hereafter still control the markets both for ma
terial and for finished products of iron and steel,
though it is reported that lower prices will soon be
made for coke, owing to better utilization of
products, and for nails, owing to heavy decrease in
consumption. The billet pool reports no large
sales, but middlemen or outsiders continue to un
derselljit. The new demand for finished products
is very light, and while quotations average a shade
lower, most of them are cut to secure business.
Bessemer is a shade lower at $12 25 at Flttsburg.
The textile manufacturers, as has been said, are
generally devising curtailment of production, and
the only change in prices is downward.

BICYCLE ROADS
A Prediction Made by a New York
Wheelman â Cheaper Wheels.
The wheel has become an accepted in
stitution of daily life to anch an extent
that it is only when one stops to make a
comparative study of its progress that one
can accurately gauge its influence. A
man commenting on this a day or two ago
was asked if he thought the craze could
be permanent. "Undoubtedly," he re
plied; "I look to see, before ten years are
passed, men going to their work â office,
counter or factory âon perfectly arranged
bicycle roads, from one end of the inland
to the other. 1 don't know whether these
will be elevated or grade or below grade,
but they will exist. The few merely fash
ionable folks will, of course, drop the
wheel soon for some fresh novelty, or con
sign it to occasional use, but the* army of
wheel men and women is going to increase
rather than decrease.
"A recent article spoke of the wheel as a
social revolutionizer that had never been
equaled, and in my mind its influence has
only just begun. The same article quoted
a physician as saying that 'not within
200 years has there been any one thing
which has so benefited mankind as the in
vention of the bicycle,' from the fact that
it has put all the world out of doors. You
may be sure these people are not going to
be put indoors again, having tasted the
pleasures of air and motion. Wheels will
be cheap in a short time. Their present
price is because the factories cannot sup
ply the demand, but as tneir manufacture
increases the price will lower and a stock
of wheels will be a part of the Household
belongings of every family, just as a stock
of umbrellas is."â New York Times.

Editor High Prosecuted by

inal Libel.
FULL JURY SELECTED.
W. W. Foote Appears for the
President of the Water
Company.
HISTOBY TOID IN QUERIES.
The Trial Expected to Decide Many
Questions That Are Now
in Doubt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 26. f
Not since Judge Wood was elected to
the bench has the Police Court presented
euch a dignified appearance as this morn-
Iditor High !s Surprised That Libel
i-n ts Shou d Have Been Brought in
i ak ard.
ing. Gavin Dhu High, editor of the Oak
land Times, was on trial for the alleged
libelm_- of President W. J. Dingee of the
Oakland Water Company. On account of
tbe many sided issues that will be intro
duced the case is of the greatest interest
to capitalists, bankers, politicians and
many others who are supposed to be in
some way or other connected with the
newspaper that has made more history
than any paper in this county.
W. W. Foote was present as special at
torney for tbe prosecution in connection
with Deputy District Attorney Church.
High was represented by W. A. and li.
M. iieatty of San Francisco.
In ihe lobby were M. J. Keller, who re
cently gave a p"ze of $20 for an essay on,
"Why the Oakland Times is not a News
paper" ; Frank J. Moflitt, who is associated
with the D ngee Water Company, but who
says that he is not in the fight; C. L. Max
well, who owned the Times for a few weeks
before G. D. High was put in control and
who compared it to a sieve; Emil Xus
haurcer, ti. M. Cameron, Christian Scuret
ber, F. al. FarweJl, and many attorneys
and merchants.
The usual play was made for a con
tinuance by defendant's attorneys, but it
was denied and tbe talesmen were called
to the box.
The examination of the talesmen showed
what each side feared most. The Oakland
Water .Company and Editor High seemed
to be only secondary factors in the case.
W. E. Dargie and F. J. Moffitt seemed to
be most feared by the editor's counsel,
while W. W. Foote was not particularly
anxious that friends of the officers of local
banks should be on tbe jury. There was a
history told between the lines of the exam
ination to which each talesman was sub
jected. Although Mr. High declares he is
tole editor and proprietor of the Times it
President Dargie Was Merely an Inter
ested Spectator-
is known that there is a heavy incum
brance upon it, and an impression pre
vails that Mr. High is not altogether re
sponsible for what appears in the paper he
edits.
Of course, everybody knows that Frank
J. Moffittis on the inside of everything
connected with the paper, as he owned it
for several years, and he is really a central
figure n the suit, although he is not men
tioned even as a witness. Every talesman
was asked if he knew Mr. Moffit or had
"done politics" with him, and while many
answered atlirmatively, many had not.
The whole day was taken up with get
ting a jury, and finally the following
twelve were agreeable to all parties: Ed
Wbitehea.i, pianodealer; H. F. Larrabee,
carpenter; C. Wiedersheim, florist; G. L.
Broadwater, builder; H. Bruenn, music
teacher: W. C. Ma-on, confectioner; 8.

J. S. Watson, nurseryman; J. Smith,
photographer; F. M." Farwell, paint
dealer.
The case was then continued to next
Monday for the taking of testimony.
Theater LeaÂ«e Renewed.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 26.â The original
lease of the Macdonough Theatre was
surrendered this afternoon to the estate.
A little later a new lease was recorded to
Manager Friedlander. As the original
lease was to Al Bou7ier, who sent all the
Baldwin attractions over here, the new
leÂ«tse to the Columbia management ia
looked upon with mucn interest. It is not
known what effect, if any, the chance will
have upon the Macdonough management,
which has been made very successful by
Ch arles E. Cooke.
PHYSICIANS QULAIFY.
The Board of Health Now HÂ»i Four
Homeopath Mem
bers.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 26.â Dr. Nelson
H. Chamberlain and Dr. Sloan Â£. Small,
the two homeopath pnysicians Mayor
Davie appointed Thursday afternoon as
members of the Board of Health, qualified
this afternoon. They both strongly deny
that there has been any consultation or
arrangement regarding patronage and say
they are bound by no pledges or promises
to any party, person or cliques regarding
patronage. "
The majority of the board are now
homeopath, while the old board were allo
path and there is much speculation as to
what changes will be made, as all the
patronage is now held be the friends of the
latter school.
RAISING THE FUNDS.
Alameda County Endeavorers Ready to
Do Their Share.
OAKLAND, Cal.. June 26.â The First
Baptist Christian Endeavor Society took
the initial step for Alameda County En
deavorers last night in raising the $25,000
guaranteed from this county toward de
fraying the expenses of the International
Endeavor Convention of 1897, which, it ia
expected, will be held in San Francisco.
It was voted that the society with a mem
bership of 105 should raise $150 for that
purpose.
The societies throughout the city and
county will now all be appealed to to de
termine what they can and will do in this
work, and it is believed tnere will be no
trouble in raising the necessary amount
among the eighty-five or more societies.
The Calilornia'delegation to the conven
tion at Washington, D. C, will leave next
Tuesday morning. July 4 and 5 will be
spent in Chicago, and all will arrive at
their destination Wednesday, July 7, about
3 p. m.
Among those who will be in attendance
from this county will be Rev. R. F. Coyle,
D. D., Rev. Barton W. Perry, A. J. Mc-
Murtry and Miss Mabel Doub. There are
several others who may yet decide to go.
SAID A FLY BIT HIM.
Reason Assigned by William Collins for
Demolishing Household Effects.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 26.â William
Collins, the young man who demolished
the furniture at his home Wednesday af
ternoon because, as he said, a fly had bit
him on the cheek and he wanted to kill it,
was committed to Napa by the Insanity
Commissioners to-day.
He is only 26 years of age, but for eight
years or more he has been kept chained in
a room in his mother's cottage at 167
Eighth street. He sat grinning through
out the proceedings.
The mother and sister told of his queer
and violent conduct and said they were
afraid of their lives while he web about.
ALAMEDA IS PROSPERING
This Is Shown by the Increase
in Deposits at the Savings
Bank.
Evidence Tendered in the Irjunction
Suit of a Technical Nature
Only.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 26.â According
to the figures supplied by Cashier J. E.
Baker of the Alameda Bank the city is
steadily prospering. The dividend to de
â  positors in the savings bank for the half
i year just ending is4j^ per cent per annum.
[ The last dividend was 4VÂ£ per cent, and
t the decrease is brought about chiefly, says
. the cashier, by the increase in the local
i rate of taxation.
1 "Business," said the cashier, "has in
-1 creased since January. At that time there
was on deposit in the savings bank $600,
--000; now there is $640,000. The number of
depositors is 2995; in January the number
was 2777."
In the commercial department, or bank
proper, the usual aividend has been de
clared, and there is now on deposit $200,
--000. The amount of capital stock in the
bank proper is $100,000, all of which has
bean subscribed.
In the savings institution the capital
stock is the name, but the amount paid up
is only $40,000. Messrs. R. R. Thompson
and Joseph Knowiand hold the greatest
number of shares in both concerns.
Fleming's Injunction Suit.
ALAMEDA. Cal., June 26.â The evi
dence tendered to-day against ibe City
Trustees in the injunction suit was all of a
technical character. T. G. Cartwright,
Wallace Briggs and R. T. Valentine were
examined. The opinions offered were,
that incandescent dynamos cannot be
operated economically in furnishing arc
lights, and that the present condition of
the plant is sufficient io furnish incandes
cent lights for commercial purposes. Cart
wright admitted he had not operated a
plant since 1888, and Briggs that he knew
nothing about the facts of the case.
So far, Delanoy has stated, on oath and
elsewhere, that he had no interest in the
Fleming suit, but the examination of the
city's electrician reveals the opposite.
Wiese was invited to call at the Sterling
Company's office by Delanoy. This was i
about the beginning of April, and before
going he consulted with the City Attor
ney. Wiese stated he called, and Delanoy
and Lloyd made a proposition to him
which would insure him a job with them
as an electrician. Behind the door of the
room where the conversation took place
sat a stenograp er, busily engaged in
taking the conversation. Mr. Bruner
sought to introduce these stenographic
notes in evidence. It is expected the case
will close to-morrow.

MISERY WITHIN
THE CITY OF GOD,
Five Starving Infants Found
in a Tent at Beulah
Park. '
HUNGRY AND SHIVERING
Food for the Soul in Plenty, but
No Nourishment for
the Body.
"LET ME TO THY BOSOM FLY."
Two of the Little Ones and the
Mother in Need of Medical
Aid
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 26. t
Oat in Beulah Park a young-looking
woman was found to-day, living in a tent
MISERY WITHIN THE CITY OF GOD.
The dreary tent in the "Park of Peace" where a faithful mother was found
yesterday doing all in her power to keep five little tots from starving.
. with five little children. The family is
â¢ destitute and practically deserted by the
bread-winner.
The wind was blowing strong and cold,
k but nowhere in the vicinity was it blowing
stronger or more coldly than on the indi
vidual slope of Beulah Park where was
the forlorn dwelline-place of this unhappy
family.
The park is not generally associated
I with squalor and poverty. It is the scene
of religious revivals and its very name sig
nifies "peace." In the tabernacle, a short
distance from the abode of unhappiness,
the songs of Zion are sung daily aud a few
. nights ago scores of people were so happy
I at having been "born again into the king
dom of life and happiness" that they
were overcome by the power of the Para
i clete. So the evangelists said. The place
i is owned by a millionaire, who is credited [
j I with being notably generous, and "God-
I bless you" resounds in the camp from
i : morn till midnight.
In such a place no one looks for misery.
Within the sound of the sweet singing of j
! | many Christians the cries of hungry, cold |
i little children and of a faithful, buffering j
i mother are not expected. But they are
, there, within the confines of what is con
sidered by those that dwell therein an
earthly paradise.
Mrs. Prescott, agent of the Children's
Society, visited the place to-day and
learned a heartrending story from a young
woman who is pale, rather pretty and of a
delicate build and frail in health. He
name is Mrs. Talbert, and she has been
I married ten years, although she does not
look to be more than 25 years of age. Four
children have been buried and five are
with her in the tent, which is small, and
on the windward slope of Beulah Park.
A baby of 8 months old is very ill and was
i never strong. Another of 21 months of
I age is also ill. There is an old stove out
side the tent which has passed the day of
usefulness.
William Talbert, the father, has been at
i the Harty mining camp, Shasta County,
[ about a year where he is employed irregu
larly. He sent his family to Oakland
i about a month ago. His wife had one fol
iar in her possession upon arriving here
and did not receive a line from her hus
band till this morning. Contrary to his
promise and expectation the letter con
tained neither money nor mention of any.
Cruelty and want have contributed their
share toward clouding wijat was onee â
as is very evident â an unusually bright
mind and making a devoted mother at
times an unsafe companion for her little
ones with whom she is alone, except when
an occasional tenter invites them to make
a brief call.
So far as food is concerned, the family
have been without any, except what a few
friends have carried to them, and the frail
mother says that they have made up for
the lacK of food by an extra allowance of
water. On one occasion, when she had
j three babies nursing the bottle at one
time, she was obliged to crawl around on
her hands and knees to get their milk, be
cause of a severe attack of rheumatism.
Several times she has been forced to get
up when her baby has been but two days
old and care for her family. To make
! matters worse, it will not be long before
I there is another little member added to
! the household.
The father was written to-day and asked
what he proposes to do. An effort will be
made to have all the children provided for
and the mother given the treatment her
condition demands.
"It is the saddest case I have met," said
Mrs. Prescott to-night.
â¢'The cause of it all seems to be a lack of j
responsibility on the part of the father, in !
addition to intemperance and general I
worthlessness. Out of all this there is the j
I consequent cruelty that naturally follows.
And the mother is a bright, proud little
thing, who richly deserves the best of care,
if for nothing else than for nor fidelity to
her helpless little ones."
When a Call man went to the tent at
dusk the night was rapidly growing colder
and the air was damp.
"We cannot cook anything to-night,"
said the frail woman, because the wind is
the wrong way to suit the stove. We have
had plenty to eat to-day, because some
friends came here; but many days we
have wanted and have drunk water to
moke us feel less hungry. I can stand it,
but for the little ones it is hard."
As the mother was speaking she stood
at the door of the tent, shivering. She
did not ask the visitor in, as the tent was
not put in order. Probably her tired limbs
had done as much "housekeeping'" as in
places where circumstances were favor
able, but she was not disposed to parade
her poverty. The little ones ran in and
out of the "tent and a little tot pointed to
the eaves and said to the artist, "Mister,
yer ain't got der picter in."
The "picture" to which the dirty little
hand pointed was a piece of card with a
text of scripture on it.
What irony 1 The words were, "Behold 1
I come quickly and my reward is with
me."
Then the baby, who was pressed close to
its mother's breast, began to cry. It was a
fretful cry, and the sound caused the
mother's wan brow to knit still closer.
Just at that moment the beautiful, soft
notes came o'er the lea from the taber
nacle :
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to thy boaom fly.
A new light came into the woman's eye
and with it a tear.
"Yes, that's it," she said half audibly.
Asking to be excused, she withdrew, shiv
ering, into the tent to be alone with her
misery and her darlings, for she loves
them. ______________
Oak lander Honored.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 26. âDr. George
H. Derrick of this city to-day received no
tification that he had been appointed to a

charge of the organization of these clubs
in the Third Congressional pistrict, and

REPUBLICANS AT OUTS,
Each of Berkeley's Two Clubs
Wonders Why the Other
Exists.
Young Stoddard, the Would-Bs Actor,
Declaims to the Oaks of Mitch*
ell's Canyon.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 26.â East
Berkeley has two Republican clubs, and
each is questioning the other's rieht to
exist. Many citizens are in a quandary to
know which of tne two is the legitimate
club and which one should receive Orst
recognition. In each club there are over
100 members, and citizens of about equal
standing are on their membership roll.
The first club to- be formed came into
life through the instrumentality of Robert
Edgar, a member of the Republican Con
gressional Committee. This club met and
organized at Odd Fellows' Hall a short
time ago, with William L. Hill as presi
dent, Robert Edgar vice-president, and C.
S. Merrill secretary, while the second club
was organized last Tuesday night at a
meeting called by John W. Strieker of the
Republican County Central Committee.
Members of the Strieker Club declare that
the Edgar Club was organized without
the assistance or approval of any other
regular Republican organizations, and
that it will not receive recognition by the
S tate Central Committee.
The Strieker men further claim that their
club is the only one that should exist as a
representative body, and that coalition is
the only thing that should result from
their now separate and inharmonious ex
istence.
On the other hand, some of the most
prominent members of the Edgar Club
maintain that their club should receive
recognition at the hands of the State Cen
tral Committee, since they were first to
permanently organize.
The SirickerClub has several member
ship rolls now in circulation, with the
hope of increasing i:s membership before
the next meeting occurs Tuesday evening.
Talks to the Trees.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 26.â Roy Stod

Canyon.
Stodrlard was a member of the company
organized by young Chick, which dis
banded when the organizer and manager
was locked up In his home by a mother
who did not approve of his histrionic
efforts. Chick is still confined and Stod
dnrd, presumably with a view to keeping
in practice, spends his time in rehearsing

were to have presented in Shattuck Hall.

WANTS HARRIS INDICTED
Mrs. Margaret Barkeley Goes
Before the Grand
Jury.
She Accuses a Stock Broker of
Embezzling Her Money and
Stocks.
Yesterday Mrs. Margaret Barkeley and
her lawyer, Frank Shay, presented to the j
Grand Jury a very serious accusation
against Charles P. Harris, a stockbroker
at 318 Pine street. According to the nar
rative told to the District Attorney and
said to be sustained by entries taken from
the books of the broker by an expert ac
countant, the vender of stock did a smash
ing business with other people's money
and stocks, and then had no means of set
tling accounts when the day of reckoning
came.
According to Mrs. Barkeley's version,
Harris brought her out in debt to him in
the sum of $11,000. As she was positive that
a large sum was due to her she got Mr. Shay
to examine the books and then some re
markable transactions were revealed. In
one transaction, where he advanced $631
ti complete the purchase, on her account,
of 200 shares of Con. Virginia, 100 of Ophir
ar.d 100 of Overman, he sold the stock on
the day of purchase for $1160. Then with
$500 of her money in his pocket he charged
her interest on $631 for years, and bought
up an assessment account of $842 on stocks
which he had sold.
In another transaction he bought 100
shares of Belcher for $612, charged Mrs.
Barkeley that amount and sold the stock
the same day at that price. When sold on
her order she got only $134 from him. She
avers that he never "kept a share of stock
over night â that he sold evervthiug in
sight â and when the recent advance in
stocks came he had nothing to sell, and
consequently went under. She claims
that Harris owes her $4000.
It was related as an incident of Har
ris' career that he owed Mr. Lillie of San
Jose a large sum on account. Lillie or
dered his Con. Virginia sold, but Harris
did not have it. The San Jose man gave
notice that he would have a settlement
without the aid of courts and lawyers, and
the matter became so serious that Harris'
father-in-law put up $5000 and settled with
Lillie.
Mrs. Barkeley told the District Attorney
that she was only one of 120 women
whose money and stocks bad been swept
away by Harris' peculiar methods of do
ing business. She had been implored by
others to be lenient and give him time.
She says that she did consider at one time
the advisability of making still further
advances of money when she deemed it
best to have her lawyer look at the broker's
books. This expert examination disclosed
such a state of affairs that she resolved to
seek to have Harris indicted for embezzle
ment on the showing of her own accounts.

GALLOPERS AT SAN JOSE,
A Race Meeting to Be Held in
the Garden City Beginning
in July.
Races by Electric Light One of the
Objectionable Featuresâ Good
Purses Promised.
San Jose is to have a spell of summer
racing furnished by the jaded nags that
are now eating their beads off in stalls ad
jacent to the local racecourses in Oakland
and Sacramento.
The projector of the new enterprise in
the Garden City is Cliff Phillips, proprie
tor of the People's Palace in this City, who
has secured a lease of tbe Santa Clara
Agricultural Society's park and racecourse
for a period of ten years, beginning July 1.
In the racing venture are associated
with Mr. Phillips several local and San
Jose horsemen, whose names are as yet
kept in the background.
In an interview, Mr. Phillips stated
that it was the intention to open the race
meeting about July 20, to run three days
each week, continuing until the opening
of the Agricultural Society's annual fair
in September.
' The size of the purses has not yet been
decided on, but Mr. Phillips stated they
would be substantial enough to induce the
owners to cuter their horses.
There are now about 125 horses quar
tered on the San Jose track, and with the
additional ones that will be attracted by
the offer of good purses, the men inter
ested in the deal think some good racing
could be furnished. The races would be
run under the rules of the Agricultural
Society of that county, and the society
would also have the appointing of the offi
cials in the stand. Where the jockeys will
be secured is a mystery, for nearly all of
the riders that were seen in the saddle at
the last Ingleside meeting are now follow
ing the Montana circuit.
The one undesirable feature of the new
enterprise is the fact that it is tbe inten
tion of the management to give races by
electric Jight on Saturday night of each
week, and oftener if the innovation proves
a success. Arc lights will be strung around
the track for a distance of four furlongs, ,
and this will be the limit of the dashes to
start with. Electric light racing has been
tabooed by reputable turf organizations

FIRE IN NEW SAULSALITO.
Three Buildings and Their Con
tents Destroyed in a Few
Minutes.
Excellent Work of Checking the
Flames Done by the Crews of
the Ships.
t SAUBALITO, Cal., June 26.â At 11:30
to-nigtJt a disastrous fire broke out in
j what is known as NewSausalito. Suddenly
the flames were seen breaking out of Jndge
Belrude's stable, and before hardly an ef
fort could be raaae to check the fire, the
building and contents were destroyed.
The horses, however, were saved.
The flames extended to Paul Trouett's
butcher-shop and stables, and both build
ings were soon in ashes.
Upon the first alarm of fire the officers
and crews of the ships ia the harbor hur
ried ashore and did excellent work in
checking the flames. The men were from
the British ships Hollingwood, Brablock,
Kilmeny and the Uahnemann.
They saved the new residence of Joe
Lawrence only by the greatest efforts.
The furniture was all moved out of the
menaced building badly scorched.
Several of the persons who were fighting
the fire were slightly burned by the fierce
flames.
The damage caused by the destruction
of the three buildings and their contents
is Ã¼bout $3000, partially covered by insur
ance. The origin of the fire is unknown,
but it is thought to have been the work of
an incendiary.

RAILROAD SUIT DISMISSED.
Judge Seairell Refuses to Allow J. How
ard Smith to Amend a Complaint.
Judge Seawell yesterday refused to al
low J. Howard Smith to file au amended
complaint in his suit against the Market
street Railway Company et a).
Smith is a stockholder in the Ferries
and Cliff House Railway Company. The
Market-street Company holds some real
estate that Smith claims belongs to the
company in which he is a stockholder. He
urged the Cliff House railway to sue the
Market-street Company for the land, but
it refused. He then brought suit in his
own name, alleging in his complaint that
the Market-street Company is not legally
incorporated. He now desires to amend
the complaint by adding to it certain pro

can it be a party to an action. Even if the
company were a corporation it would be
unnecessary for plaintiff to set up proceed*

title for the purpose of showing that they

would be for it to show that it had title.
Plaintiff's motion is, therefore, denied."

BALDWIN ON A SALARY.
The New Fee Bill Causes the Marshal
to liOse Several Thousand
Dollars.
The bill recently passed by Congress
placing United States marshals and depu
ties on salary will go into effect July 1.
Marshal Baldwin will now get $4000, in
stead of a possible $6000, as under the fee
system. This year Baldwin has made all
the law allows, though during the preced
ing twelve months he was a few hundred
dollars shy.
His deputies, five in number, will also
be placed on a salary and appointed by
the Attorney-General. Marshal Baldwin
has recommended the reappointment of
the entire force under him, and there is
no reason to suppose that the authorities
at Washington will go contrary to his
wishes.
Sam Knight and Bert Schlessinger, as
sistants to the District Attorney, were re
appointed yesterday for a term of four
years.

NEXT TAX LEVY
TO COME DOWN,
One Dollar Local Tax Will
Produce the Sum of
$3,200,000.
THE ASSESSMENT ROLL.
Apart From Direct Taxes $1,452,
--580 Will Go to the
Treasury.
THE ONE - TWELFTH ACT.
The Grand Jury Consults Judge Slack
Regarding a Violatoin of
the Law.
Tue Grand Jury resumed work yester
day on the estimates of money for con
ducting the municipal government. In
order to definitely ascertain the require
ments for the next fiscal year it was
resolved to ask the heads of the various
departments of the City government for
information in detail.
A resolution was accordingly adopted
requesting the respective committees of
the Grand Jury to obtain from the chiefs
of the various departments the names of
their employes, the duty performed by the
men employed and the salary paid to
each. The resolution also contemplates
that the heads of the various departments
shall state the cost of maintaining their
respective offices, presenting an exhibit of
the expenses this year as compared with
hist year's expenses, and if an increase is
desired, to slate what reasons exist for the
increase.
Under this resolution Frank V. McLen
nan is to obtain data from the School De- |
partment, as he is chairman of the School
Committee; John Landers will hear from
the Assessor, Auditor and Treasurer; Ed
ward Maliey from the Fire Department;
C. S. Laumeister from the County Clerk;
P. F. Butler from the Health Department; |
Alpheus Bull Jr. from the Public Library;
Louis Feldmann from the Police Depart
ment; T. F. Payne from the Sheriff: C. L.
Haskell from the Recorder; G. H. Umb
se 11 from the Street Department and I'arfc
Commission, and J. J. O'Farrell irom the
Stipervisors.
The Grand Jury has takea,notice of the
fact that the one-twelfth act has been vio
lated. Several funds are already ex
hausted, whereas if the law had been
obeyed not more than one-twelfih of the
appropriation could have been used dur
ing any month of the year.
The members of the jury wantea to be
sure that the law was still in effect, so they
requested Judge Slack to enlighten them.
The Judge advised them that the law was
sill in force and there should be no defi
ciency in any of the funds. One-twelfth
of the money allotted should be In the
fund for the twelfth month of the year, the
sarue as it was for the first month. The
Judge was not sure whether there was a
penalty for violation of the one-twelfth
law.
The iury discussed estimates for some
time. Expert reports from Cyril Williams
and Horace Dunn were reviewed, and par
ticular attention was paid to Street De
partment and Golden Gate Park requisi
tions and Police Court affairs. Next
Tuesday evening an extra session of the
jury will be held. At that time the Asses
sor may be able to give definite informa
tion as to the valuation of the assessment
roll.
From sources outside of the Grand Jury
the fact has been ascertained that the as
sessment roll will show a valuation ap
proximating $340,000,000. It may go
$5,000,000 above this fisiure. It is easy
enough for advocates of reasonable re
trenchment to fitrure that a tax of $1 on
the $100 will furnish all the money required
for local government. It is set forth
clearly that nearly $1.">00,000, independent
of the amount raised by direct local taxa
tion, comes to the treasury and is dis
bursed to defray municipal expenses.
Here is a statement of what the City
will receive from sources other thau the
local tax-levy :
ESTIMATED REVENUE EXCLUSIVE OF TAXES.
Fees cf City and County officers $230,000
Fines imposed in Police Courts 30,000
Fines imposed in Superior Court 1,000
Licenes, City and County 380,000
Licenses, municipal 80.00U
Incenses, stock certificate taxes 1.200
Quarantine fees 6,01)0
Subsistence United stat-s prisoners 1,500
Sundries, Assessor, rents, etc 9.8*0
Library l.OOii
State school apportionment 630.000
Park rents 2,0n0
School lots rent 45,000 '
Tno per cent tax on franchises 10,000 \
License on vehicles 26,000
Total $1,452,580
The State makes the levy for school
taxes and the amount of $630,000 appor
tioned ;o San Francisco does not come
from local taxes, yet it is expended for the
Bupport of local schools. As a matter of
fact San Francisco pays into the treasury
a much larger sum on the State school tax
account than is received in the apportion- !
ment to counties.
The inheritance tax collected by the
County Clerk and which now amounts to
$150,000, that sum having been collected
by County Clerk Curry, goes into the
State school fund. In the division of the
funds to the different counties San Fran
cisco will get her share of this $150,000.
The County Clerk's office, countting
the inheritance tax, is more than
a self-sustaining institution. It costs to
run the office $10,500 a month, or $126,000
a year. The ordinary fees collected
amount to $80u0 a month, or $96,000 per
annum. Adding this amount to the
inheritance tax at the approximate figure
of $100,000 a year, the County Cierk's of
fice shows a clear pain over and above
running expenses of $70,000. This is due
to an intelligent, economical and business
like Republican administration. Good
salaries are paid to capable men and the
fees due the public are collected and paid
into the treasury.
A careful study of estimates shows that
a local tax levy as low as $1 will provide
ample money for ordinary expenses and
leave a wide margin for public improve
ment and adornment.
Every cent on a valuation of three hun
hundred and forty millions will produce
$04,000. One hundred cents will therefore
yield $3,400,000. It might be fair to de
duct $200,000 for delinquency in collection
of taxes. With this deduction the amounts
would stand : '
from direct local tax levy of SI $3,200,000
From revenue exclusive of taxes 1.4.V2 hHO
Xouil $4,652,580
Every member of the Grand Jury and
every Supervisor will recognize that this
sum is money in abundance. Could or
dinary business methods be brought into
the conduct of municipal affairs the City
could be governed for $1,000,000 less than
the above amount, but the law prescribes
certain forms which cost a great deal to
carry out. hencp a public officer cannot
have public work performed in an econ
omical manner.
Fire Department Bills.
Ja Tuesday afternoon the Board of Fire
joinmissioncrs will meet and straighten up
their accounts for the current fiscal year. All
bills against the Fire Department must be pre
sented by Tttesday morning or, under the de
cision of the .Supreme Court, they will be for
feited, as the bills of one fiscal year cannot
run into the next. The present month's bills
for salaries and all will be about $50,000, but
for all that there will be a surplus of $13,000,
which of course will go back into tne general
fund.
IN THE DIVORCE COURTS.
Unhappy Mortals Who SÂ«Â«k Peace in
Eternal Separation.
A suit for divorce was yesterday filed by
Otto Crossfield, manager of the Thomp
son Bridge Company. He alleges that hia
wife, Adele M. Crossfield, deserted him
several years ago.
Elsie Ballard asks that she be divorced
from Alfred H. Ballard because of the
latter's cruelty. Ballard is an old news
paper man, but is now employed at the
Fulton Iron Works as a timekeeper.
Willful neglect and desertion are the
grounds on which Bessie Jenkins seeks a
separation from William Jensins.
Judge Troutt yesterday ordered J. W.
Little to pay $25 a month alimony to Ada
H. Little.

MYRIAD KISSES
MEANT NOTHING.
Baldwin Says His Oscilla
tory Desires Did Not
Denote Love.
HIS HEART UNTOUCHED.
The Hoary-Headed Defendant
Says Lillian Made No Im
pression on Him.
HE DID NOT CACTTIOH HER.
Miss Ashley's Alleged Betrayer Says
He Was Under No Duty to Warn
Her to Cease Writing.
E. J. Baldwin is not sensitive; neither is
he impatient. Attorney Crittenden drove
question after question at the aged de
fendant that would make an ordinary man
cringe or swear, and Baldwin sat most of
the day with a cynical smile on his face,
and attempted to evade direct answers
with the skill of an experienced barrister.
Then the ardent missives, already intro
duced in the case, were brought forward,
and the tender passages were subjected to
the searching scrutiny of a vigorous cross
examination. And just when the most
passionate declarations were under dis
cussion Crittenden would refer to the de
fendant's sixty-eight years and then ask
him if he had shown that letter to his
wife. And never once did the old man
show, except by evading questions, that
there was aught'about tbe proceeding that
was in anywise unpleasant.
The forenoon session of the court was
devoted to delving into the defendant's
career preliminary to the events directly
concerned in this case. After recounting
his business experiences from the time he
opened the Pacific Temperance House on
Pacific street in 1853 until he became
largely interested in "ranching, mining,
horse-raising, horse-racing, hotels and
various other things." an attempt was
made to have the defendant tell what
property he now owned. Baldwin's at
torneys objected and Judge SlacK, after
argument, decided that the witness could
be asked only in regard to property di
rectly involved in the case. Baldwin then
said, in answer to questions, that he
owned the Baldwin Hotel and Hotel OaK
wood.
More pven,tful epochs in Baldwin's ca
reer were then referred to, but Attorney
Crittenden was not allowed to question
the witness in regard to previous actions
similar to this one. His questions as to
the relations of the defendant with Verona
Baldwin, a relative, Miss McCormick and
Louise Perkins were ruled out on objec
tion.
The afternoon was mainly devoted to
questioning Baldwin in regard to the cor
respondence between him aftd Miss Ash
ley, and it was here that the plaintiffs
attorney got in his most telling blows.
Baldwin was combative at every step in
the proceedings and was as ready to take
advantage of a slip in the counsel's ques
tioning as Crittenden was to pierce the
armor of his testimony. A number of the
telegrams which have figured in the case
were shown him, but he said he could
not recollect whether he sent them or not.
The letter of February 17, 1892, of Bald
win to Miss Ashley, proved the most inter
esting under cross-examination. This is
the letter in which Baldwin says he had
forgotten her last name, as she always
signed her letters L. A. A. He goes on to
say tiat he had iost found by accident an j
old letter containing her name. "So here
I am, writing to my girl again, if I can call
yon mine." He speaks of his desire to
claim the thousand hugs and kisses which
he had been promised, and closes "with
love and kisses."
"Did you neaii all that when you wrote
it?' : asked Crittendeu.
Baldwin said that was some foolish re
mark he bad made in answer to something
she said. "1 had no reason to call her my
girl," he continued. "1 never spoke to
her about being my girl."
He was then asked in regard to a state
meirt in th? lettsr that he could not send
her mouey to go to-school with, as he was
hard up.
"Could yon not, as a matter of fact,"
asked the attorney, "have drawn your
check any day for $20,000?" Baldwin said
he coull not have done so any day, but
admitted the statement that he was hard
up was a mere excuse.
"You owned the Baldwin Hotel at that
time, didn't you?" was asked. The aged
defendant admitted that he did and also
admitted owning a large amount of other
property at that time. Crittenden asked
if he didn't own $5, 000,000 worth of prop
erty at that time, but to this question At
torneys Lloyd and Highton objected
simultaneously, and his Honor sustained
them.
Then the hugs and Kisses were again re
ferred to. "You say 'then lam coming
East to get those hugs and kisses you say
you will give me.' Did you mean that?"
asked Crittenden.
"i certainly wouldn't go East for that,"
was the response.
"But when you went there you expected
to cet the kisses?" suggested Crittenden.
Baldwin said he hardly expected so
many. He was then asked concerning a
reference to her having been bashful on a
previous occasion. He explained that
this was the occasion of his parting with
her at Boston.
"I put out my hands to kiss her and she
drew back. I was coing to kise ber just as
I would any one at parting," he said.
"You had only seen Miss Ashley at
Winchester, and then met her again at
Boston, rode about with her a little in a
carriaee and then rtrove to the depot. In
that short time had she made such an im
pression on your heart that you wanted to
kiss her?" asked Crittenden.
'".She never touched my heart at all,"
exclaimed the hoary gallant. "From her

AND
bleeding
My little boy -was afflicted with Eczema In
acute form for a year, during which we tried
â without success every known remedy. The dis-
order appeared on the right cheek and was of a
oiisaery and bloody form. His pillow, mornings
would bear the bloody imprint of the side of his
face, while it was impossible to prevent him
from scratching his face owing to the itching.
Advised to try Cttticuiu, I bought a box. The
first application was made at night, and it in a
fact, that the appearance of the affected parts
showed a noticeable improvement the next morn-
ing, and, continuing the treatment, as a result,
my child has as fair and smooth skin as can be
found anywhere. .

"You did have a desire to see Miss |
Asblev when you went to Boston, then?" |
''I had a curiosity to see the woman
who had been writing to me for a couple
of years."
In answer to further questions he said
he made no attempt to kiss her until they
reached the depot. "The cars were a bad
place to do it," he said, "and the window
of the carriage was open. I never thought
of it until I went to leave her. I would
kiss any one on leaving."
Then" Crittenden turned on the can
nister. "Mr. Baldwin," he asked, sten
toriously, "you had this bashful girl in
your mind, did you not, when you asked
her to meet you alone in a city where you
were going with racehorses?"
"I asked her to meet me there," was the
answer.
"Did you ask her to meet you there
alone?" insisted Crittenden.
"I thought from her letters," was the
answer, "I could meet her alone in Chi
cago or any other place."
Baldwin's purpose in requesting Miss
Ashley to destroy his letters after reading
was then gone into', but no satisfactory
explanation was adduced. Crittenden
asked Baldwin if he thought the letter
wherein he asked her to meet him in Chi
cago was the kind of letter he would
think proper for the father of the young
lady receiving it to see. Objections by
Lloyd and Highton saved Baldwin from
answering.
"Then j r ou went on to say," said Critten
den, " 'I think you are just as nice as you
can De.' Did you think so?"
Baldwin said he didn't think so, but she
had been writing like that to him and he
thought he ought to respond in kind.
"Do you send love and kisses to women
whom you do not care for?" defendant
was asked.
"I have done so."
"And you a married man?"
"Yes, sir. I thought I could write most
anything to a young woman who wrote to
a married man, as she did to me."
"You were such a Bober man," said
Crittenden, sarcastically, "and had been
so long married that you at once sat down
and wrote to her that you thought it was
very improper to do so.
"Have you any such letter?" asked
Baldwin, a little* testily, and every one,
including the plaintiff, laughed.
At 5 o'clock the plaintiff was still being
called upon to elucidate his epistles, when
Judge Slack was called away to attend the
Grand Jury. He adjourned the case until
10 o'clock this morning.
TELEPHONE SYSTEMS.
Methods of Establishing Tele
phone Companies
Exploited.
What the New York Advertiser of
May 14 Has to Say on the
Subject.
Regarding the establishment of new
telephone systems the New York Adver
tiser of May 14 says :
"Several ways and means have been dis
covered for making and losing money by
phones since the expiration of the funda
mental telephone patents. One way is to
start a large and imposing concern with
nominal capital enough to run the United
States, acquire a few obscure detail patents
and then sell stock and 'State rights' to
credulous investors. Another is to start
a local company and pat in a plant
bought from one of the various telephone
construction companies that have blos
somed forth trom electric-beil makers' es
tablishments during the last year or two.
Stil 1 another is to organise one of these
construction companies and trade on the
inexperience and lack of technical knowl
edge of the managers of the new telephone
companies by supplying them with phones
and materials of the quality and design of
the year 1880. A few men get together
and organize, maKing themselves presi
dent, manager, and so on. The business of
their lifetime may have been medicine,
law, livery stables or groceries, but with
the few thousand dollars they and their
friends have got together they purchase a
telephone plant from one of the various
mushroom construction companies that
have appeared in anticipation of just such
customers. By appealing to popular sen
timent against monopolies and to the love
of cheapness, and by abstaining from any
thing in the nature of a signed contract,
they secure a number of "subscribers" â {
that is, persons willing to allow them to
put phones in their houses and to make
verbal agreenient to pay $1 50 or $2 a month
for the service. The wires and cables are
strung; the phones put in place (generally
by inefficient linemen unable to
keep a regular job); the central is
fitted up, and then the troubles j
bej;in. Ihe wires won't work, the
switchboard won't switch, the phones
won't talk, and of course the people won't
pay. The worthy president and general j
manager are helpless, and the only thing
they can do is to send for an expert of the
construction company that has already
victimized them, who proceeds to suggest
alterations and additions involving more
outlay. This is the history of several
small telephone companies in towns not
very distant from New York, and of many J
in Western States. Those who without '
technical experience or training embark \
in telephone enterprises to-day are simply j
setting out from the point that the estab- |
lished concerns started from when the |
telephone was a novelty. Their money, 1
or the money intrusted to them, will be i
sunk in trials and experiments and in ac- !
quiring the experience and knowledge of '
the business, which, so far, remains the
monopoly of the old companies."
There ia food for reflection in the fore
going.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 27, 1896.
SLOCAN REGION
RICH IN SILVER
A Most Promising Mining
District in British
Columbia.
AMERICANS IN CONTROL
Tributary to Spokane and a
Direct Benefit to This
Country.
BIG GAME AND TROUT ABOUND.
Remarkably Productive Veins Cover
ing a Large Area â 10,000
Miners at Work.
The comparatively new mining region of
the Slocan district in West Kootenay,
British Columbia, promises to be one of
Fred T. Kelly, Who Is Enthusiastic Over the Silver Mines of the Slocan Dis
trict in British Columbia, 220 Miles North of Spokane, Wash.
I the richest silver fields in America and its j
("natural outlet is through Spokane, so that |
the United States will derive most of the j
benefit of its development.
Fred T. Kelly, who has been in that
country during the four years that its {
resources have been Known, is at the
â¢ Palace on a visit in search of a little city
! excitement after staying for months in a
town called Sandon. It was built last fall
I on the snow and now ha? a populatian of
j 700 with full expectations of 2000 before
next September.
"The average payroll dumped into that
town is between $75,000 and $100,000 a
month," said Mr. Kelly. "This last win
ter we had twenty-three paying mines
round our camp, and all within two or
I three miles of it. Tliere are others com
-1 ing to the front every day. Tins winter
| will see the number of dividend-producers
i doubled.
"What is better 90 per cent of all the
mining properties is owned by Ameri
i cans. They control the best mines.
"British Columbia laws are very favor-
I able to miners; much more favorable than
i our own. Then there can be no labor
I troubles or strikes. The Government will
not allow them.
"Everybody connected with a mine or
engaged in minine there has to pay a
Government tax of $5 a year.
"The mineral belt of this district is
about 8 or 10 miles wide by 50 or 60 miles
long. It is a very rugged, mountainous
country, the hillsides being at an angle of
45 decrees. There are no farms. It is
strictly a mining country.
"The winters are not severe, although
It is pretty far north. The average temper
ature during the cold season is 10 degrees
above zero, but it is so high and dry that
you do not mind it. In winter there is
plently of snow â between fifteen and
twenty feet.
"It is the finest trout fishing country in
the world. The lakes and streams are full
of fish, and there is any amount of grizzly
and black bear. Down by the lakes there
are deer, and in the mountains there are
carriboo.
"There is plenty of water power. Most
all the mills are operated that way.
"I have bought the machinery for an
electric plant that niy partner and I in
tend to have in operation in Sandow within
the next sixty days. It will be run by
water power.
"About 100 miles south of the Slocan dis
trict is the Trail Creek country, which is
100 miles north of the international
boundary line. It is a large gold and
copper country. The ores there average
about $50 goid and from 7 to 12 per cent
copper. That region has developed in the
last year more even than the Slocan
country, because everybody is looking
for gold.
"Rossland a town of 3000 people, is the
center of the Trail Creek district. In time
it must equal Butt?, Mont, as the ledges
are very large and strong, and are im
proving both in richness of ore and size of
leads as the mines are deepened.
"There are numerous other mining
camps in British Columbia adjacent to the
Slocan country and Trail Creek district,
and they are all corning to the front fast
In the two large districts tliere must be
10,000 miners at work, most of them from
Spokane and Montana.
"The Slocan Star mine is the greatest

tonnage- producing silver mine in the
country. It turns out about 200 tons a day
now, and when the mill and concentrator
recently built are in full operation I have
no doubt the product will be thi^e tar
loads a day. Â«
"But the Rico mine is the riche?t silver
producing property in the Northwest, and,
perhaps, in all America. Two carloads
turned out of that mine netted $17,070, and
the average is about $300 a ton, taking first
and second class ores. The mine is now
paying about $100,000 a year. It will take
five years to mine out the ore in sight in
the Rico without developing any new
veins."
THE KUHLMAN CASE.
Judge Wallace Sends It to the Supreme
Court for DecUion.
The Dr. C. Q. Kuhlman-Coroner Hawk
ins imbroglio will now go before the Su
preme Court. The case was up before
Judge Wallace yesterday, and he techni
cally decided in favor of the Coroner, but
it was with the understanding that the
matter was to go before the higher tribu
nal that his jurisdiction in the case might
be denned.
Coroner Hawkins committed Dr. Kuhl
man to the County Jail for ten days for
contempt for refusing to be sworn in the
Sonderup inquest. The physician pro
cured a writ of habeas corpus, made re
turnable before Judge \\aliace. The lat
ter was not sure of his position in the
matter, the law being rather mixed.
It seems that under the old law of 1872
matters of this sort pertaining to the Coro
ner of San Francisco must be referred to
the old County Court, which court was
abolished by the law of 1880, its power be
ing superseded by the present Superior
Court. However, as the law of 1872 pro
vided only for,the Coroner of San Fran
cisco, Judge Wallace looks upon it as
special legislation, and as such is not sure
of his jurisdiction. The matter will, there-
fore, go before the Supreme Court on a
writ of habeas corpus.
Should the Supreme Court decide that
the Superior Court is without jurisdiction,
Coroner Hawkins will still have recourse
to the Penal Code, which defines the
powers of all coroners in the State.
RAILROAD MEN MULCTED
Employes of the San Mateo Line
Lose Their Guarantee
Deposits.
Judge Seawell Decides They Must
Take the Same Chance as the
Bondholders.
When the San Francisco and San Mateo
Railroad was recently sold, Judge Soawell
ordered that $20,0U0 be left in the hands of
the receiver to meet incidental expenses.
Ivor Jones brought suit asking that he be
allowed $1075 out of this money on claims
assigned him by forty-three employes of
the railroad who when they were engaged
were each required to place in the hands
of the company $25 as a guarantee for the
faithful performance of their duties.
Jones asked that the money be paid be
fore the bondholders of the company were
paid anything. Judge Seawell, however,
refused to allow this, saying:
I do not think I have any power to grant
any relief to the petitioner/lvor Jones. The
record and all proceedings in the case are be
fore me on the hearing of this application. It
appears therefrom that the sum of $20,000
mentioned in the petition is not retained for
the purpose of paying generally such claims
as have prior equity to those of the bond
holders, but only to protect the receiver
against any contingent claims for which he
may be hereafter adjudged to be liable and in
curred by him while he was acting as receiver.
In all other respects the proceeds of the sale
of the road and its appurtenances have been
fully disposed of by the final decree. The
effect oi grunting the application would be to
alter the decree already entered, in an im
portant particular, a nrl I do not think I have
any power to grant the relief prayed, either in
the manner proposed or by petition, unless
the decree be first set aside or modified. Until
that is done the proceeds of sale must be dis
tributed as required by the decree. It is
scarcely necessary to say that uoiie of the
claims assigned to Mr. Jones were incurred by
the receiver as an expense of the receivership.
As to whether the claim of Mr. Jones is of a
character to entitle him to a preierence over
the bondholders, I express no opinion. The
application of Mr. Jones is therefore denied.
Police Court Sentences.
Daniel Donohoe, a waiter, was yesterday
sentenced to six months' imprisonment in the
County Jail by Police Judge Conlan for com
mitting an assault upon a girl 10 years of age.
Maggie Mitchell, a proiessional shoplifter,
was before Police Judge Campbell yesterday
for sentence for stealing a lot of fcoods from
the Emporium. She was fined $150, with the
alternative of 150 days in the County Jail.
Several days ago oergeant Harper and posse
arrested forty-five Chinese gamblers in China
town, who were playing the new game of pi
gow. Yesterday Police Judge Conlan fined
the gamekeeper $250 and the forty-four visi
tors $100 each. The case will be appealed, as
the Chinese claim that pi gow is not a gam
bling game.
