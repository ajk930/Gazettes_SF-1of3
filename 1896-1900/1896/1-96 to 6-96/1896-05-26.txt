CHURCH AID CHARNEL-HOUSE
Many Bones Unearthed at the Scene
of the Fearful Murders in
Salt Lake.
LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO
SHOW THE PASTOR'S GUILT.
Other Crimes Beside the Slaying of Two Young
Women May Be Traced to the Missing
Rev. Francis Hermans.
SALT LAKE, Utah, May 25.â This has
been an exciting and eventful day in the
investigation of the Scandinavian church
tragedies. Tne net results are a chain of
circumstances which, taken with those
previously discovered, fastens the guilt of
murdering Miss Clausen on the Rev.
Francis Hermans beyond a doubt, and
also goes to show that Miss Samuelson fell
a victim to the pastor's satanic actions
and that he may also have had other vic
tims.
The work of excavating the floor of the
basement of tne church began at an early
hour this morning. A vast amount of
earth was removed and quantities of bones
found in various stages of decomposition.
Some were plainly identified as human
bones, others were in such a condition
that it was impossible to tell whether they
were human or the bones of animals, and
others were plainly recognized as being
those of cattle and fowls.
The general appearance of the place was
Euch as to suggest the idea of a cemetery,
and there is no telling how many human
beings have been interred in the basement
of the sacred edifice. At a certain spot
beneath the stairway, where the soil
showed evidence of having been recently
disturbed, the sole and heel of a woman's
Fhoe were found near the surface, and a
little deeper down in the same spot a pair
of bloodstained overalls, which were worn
by the pastor while he was engaced in
laboratory and other work, separate and
apart from his books. The overalls were
bloodstained on almost every part.
Ed Johnson, the young man whose
room was heated to such a high degree of
temperature the day they built the big fire
in the furnace, declares that Hermans had
them on when the latter was met by him
on the basement stairway with a sack
under his arm. He said he also wore a
jumper of like material at the same time.
But all efforts to find this article of cloth
ing were futile.
Then came a niece of confirmatory evi
dence as to what became of it. The fur
nace ashes on being sifted were found to
Miss Clausen, Whose Body Was Cre
mated in the Furnace of the Church.

contain tbe requisite number of steel but
tons for such an article of apparel and the
strong point is that they correspond ex
actly with those on the blood-saturated
overalls.
Miss Clausen wore five or six artificial
teeth and a farther examination of the
ashes taken from the furnace resulted in
the finding of two artificial teeth, with
metallic rivets similar to those worn by
the dead girl.
To-day the detectives found in a second
hand store Miss Clausen's trunk, which
the pastor claims to have sent to her by an
unknown expressman some weeks after
her disappearance. The trunk, it trans
pires, contains the wearing apparel of the
missing girl. Among the articles of cloth
ing was the dress in which Miss Clausen
bad the photograph taken, now in the pos
session of tbe police. In addition to this
it now appears that Hermans sola the
trunk and clothing himself and that he
disposed of the girl's guitar at the same
time. The date of this transaction was
December 11 last, just two months and
eleven days after the girl disappeared.
Whether the bones found in excavating
the basement of the church include those
of Mies Samuelson, the other girl who it
would appear fell a victim to the pastor's
lust and bloodthirstiness, cannot yet be
determined. The search in the church
and surroundings is not by any means yet
concluded, and further discoveries can be
expected. It has been established that
Hermans was intimate with the Samuel
son girl, and that he performed a criminal
operation on her. A few days prior to her
disappeaiance, the paster had a large box
made, and some of the officers hold the
theory that some of the bones found in the
church are too old to be those of a person
only dead since January, and that the
preacher packed the remains in the box,
and either shipped it away or else took it
along with him when he left for Kansas
City on May 6.
it has further developed that both girls
had intrusted to Hermans considerable
money for safe-keeping or investment.
Miss Clausen, it is known, gave him $300
very shortly before her disappearance, and
Miss Saniuelson had also piven him sev
eral sums of money while she was living
with him. Hermans drank heavily at
times and kept a stock of wines and
liquors at his study. The officers are keep
ing up the search in and around the

church, and the place has been visited by
thousands of curiosity-seekors to-day.
Dr. Meacharn, who made an analysis of
the stains upon the various articles found
in the cellar, said that while he was not
prepared to state that the stains were
those caused by human blood, owing to
the fact that during the long period that
had elapsed since the perpetration of the
deed the blood corpuscles had be
come contracted, making it a hard
matter to distinguish it from the
blood of animals, such as horses, dogs,
etc. Nevertheless, he emphatically pro
nounced the stains that he had examined
upon the lower door of the furnace and
upon the barrel found in the cellar to be
undoubtedly -blood stain*. Beyond that
he was not prepared to give further state
meat, except that he would operate with
a final test upon the articles, including the
smears on the paper.
The officers have no tidings of the miss
-1 ing preacher. The Governor of the State
; has been asked to offer a large reward for
\ his capture and it is expected that he will
; do so to-day.
KNOWN IN MINNEAPOLIS.
Wives of Rev. Mr. Hermans Died
Rather strangely.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., May 25.â Rev.
i Francis Hermans, who is wanted in Salt
1 Lake City on suspicion of having caused
the death of Henrietta Clausen and Annie
i Samuelson. is not unknown in Minne
: apolis. He came here in 1891 through the
instrumentality of Elder Jacobson and
. took charge of the church over which be
i presided for six months, after which he
' removed to West Superior.
Meanwhile Hermans had married a Miss
Bertha Wangen of Minneapolis. Shortly
â afterward Mrs. Hermans proved of un
sound mind and was sent to an asylum. A
few hours previous to the time set for her
removal she suddenly died. Although the
circumstances were suspicious no action
was taken. A year after this Hermans
wooed and won the hand of one Miss
Lomen of lowa, the ceremony being per
formed in Minneapolis.
During this time he was still a resident
of West Superior, where he resided until
the fall of 1893, a few months after his sec
ond marriage.
From West Superior he removed to Salt
Lake City, Utah, where his second wife
died. During the month of April of the
present year Rev. Mr. Hermans was in
Minneapolis visiting friends and relatives.
He also paid a visit to West Superior
and afterward went to lowa, and from
there to Chicago, where he was met by his
friend. Elder Jacobson ot this city. While
there Hermans received a telegram from
Salt Lake requesting his immediate pres
ence. He departed, and since then noth
ing nas been hearu of him.
Mr. Hermans was making a tour of the
country soliciting and collecting means
for his Salt Lake City church, having been
duly authorized by the Bishops to carry
out this mission. His second marriage
here made his third step in the matri
monial line, if his statement in regard to
Rev. Francis Hermans, the Salt Lake
Pastor Accused of Crimes Rivaling
Those of Durrant.
[From an engraving in the Salt Lake Herald.]
being a widower when he arrived in this
city is true.
While here the last time he spoke to an
intimate friend of a love affair he had on
his hands at Salt Lake City, claiming that
a young woman there was very much in
love with him. but he had not then made
up his mind as to whether he would marry
her or not.
He states that before his departure from
Salt Lake City the young lady in question
had sent her trunk to his house with the
information that she herself would follow.
No names were mentioned by Hermans,
and it is not known to whom she referred!
His statements and the fact that his two
wives died under suspicious circumstances
leads to the belief in Minneapolis that the
crimes laid at his door were committed by
him.

reached the city last night after escaping
from the barge Caledonia off Elizabeth,
N. J., brought the first news to New York.
Dakin said that Joe Harmon, a pugilist,
quarreled with a man named Solisky when
the excursionist were off Per*.h Amboy

Harmon was rowed ashore by five of his
companions and taken to a hospital in
Elizabethport. Then the five men were
locked up. Both the wounded men are
middle-weight fighters and it is said that
Harmon knocked Solisky out about two
weeks ago.
The excursion continued on its way to
New York with Solisky on board, presum
ably in a dying condition.
The excursion was that of the Diamond

ELIOT CALLED A CROAKER.
Grand Army Men Sharply Answer the
Criticisms of the College
President.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 25.â A Journal
special from Boston says: President
Eliot's attack on the G. A. R. has excited
widespread interest, and many answers
have been received here in the form of
newspaper correspondence. Some of tbese
are given herewith:
I. H. Walter, commaoder-in-cbief of the
G. A. R., says from Indianapolis: Croak
ers like Eliot may refuse to do justice to
our organization, but the time will come
when not only a grateful people, but every
lover of liberty the whole earth round,
will stand uncovered when they contem
plate the value of its services to the cause
of liberty and justice. Its deeds will live
when the memory of such men will be
buried in oblivion."
Major - General O. O. Howard says:
"Grand Army men, in action and senti
ment, are better exponents of patriotism
than those who pronounce the defense of
the life and honor of the country 'jingo
ism.' It is common now to condemn the
politicians and criticize Congress, but it is
,i new thing to accuse them of being afraid
of cri puled and aged veterans. We wish
only to provide honestly for the old,
maimed and helpless who freely offered
their country their lives in the time of the
country's peril. Doubtless Congressmen
are afraid to withhold from them this
measure of justice."

The most important of these is a mag

the Empress Catherine II immediately
after her accession to the throne. It some
what resembles a miter, surmounted by a
cross of flawless diamonds and the pear

of color, the rest of the stones being dia

and there is a band of purple velvet inside.
Tne value of the crown Is over 1,10(1,000

valued at over 100,000 rubles. This order
is never worn save on a day of coronation
and is adorned with five pink diamonds
and two aquamarines, one blue and the

which the Czarina will wear are little in

PLOTS IN THE TRANSVAAL
Boers Claim to Have Stroog
Evidence of the Designs of
the British.
Fiimsy Excnses of the English for
Massing Bodies of Troops in
South Africa.
JOHANNESBURG. South Afuica, May
25. â The people oi Natal have requested
the Government to see thai the militia
and the regular troops are kept in readi
ness to take the field against the Boers of
the Oranae Free State. Transvaal Repub
lic and the large numbers of Dutch in
Natal and Cape Colony who are in sym
pathy with the Boers of the Tran*. r aal
and are ready to join them against Groat
Britain, should this latter natiou invade
the South African Republic. The impres
sion prevails throughout Natal and Cape
Colony that Great Britain, in sending
fresh troops toSxnith Africa, purposes con
quering the Orange Free State and the
the South African Republic.
At Pretoria, the capital of the South
African Republic, it is positively stated the
Boer Government haa reliable evidence
that the present Matabele war in Rhode
sia has been brought abo tit on purpose to
enable Great Britain to forward troops to
Buluwayo, and when all is ripe to attack
the young republic from four sides at
once. This has caused the Boer Govern
ment to warn its citizens to keep them
selves in readiness 10 take the field at a
moment's notice.
Until Cecil J. Rhodes is removed from
South Africa the Boers maintain there can
not be lasting peace. On the northern
and western boundaries of the South Afri
can Republic the Boers are watching every
move of the British troops. It is no secret
in Johannesburg that the Boers have their
spies in Cecil Rhodes' camp and also
among the Matabelex.
Every Transvaal Government depot is
well stocked wiih arms and ammunition,
and as no commissariat is required they
are well prepared for any emergency.
The Orange Free State De Burger pub
FURY OF THE FUNNEL-SHAPED
CLOUDS TRAVELING SIDE BY SIDE,
lishes a long interview with one of the fa
mous chiefs of the bloodthirsty and most
cruel BaÂ«utos. The chief said in one por
tion of his interview: "The Free State is
between two fires. You don't understand?
Then I will make it plain. The Free
State has pledged itself to help the Trans
vaal in case of war. If the Transvaal
goes to war with England the Free State
goes also. Then we shall say to England :
'The Free State has declared war against
you and we as true subjects will help you.'
What is more, had the whole of South
Africa been plunged into war soon after
the Jameson invasion we Basutos would
have attacked you (the Free State). I as
sure you the Swazis, Bechuanas, Zulus
and the Transvaal natives would have
joined against you."
The Natal militia are in camp, ready to
move should it be necessary. They have
been supplied with new Maxim guns and
more horses. Night and day the militia
are being drilled. The force has been in
creased to 800 men.
Never has there been so much feeling of
unrest in South Africa as at present.
The ferocious Matabele in Rhodesia have
krlled scores of white men, women and
children; in Bechuanaland the natives
are in a dangerous state of unrest; the
recently conquered Pondos are causing
the British authorities great anxiety,
being excited by the successes of the
Matabele; the unconquered Basutos are
leaving their work and returning to their
kraals and talking warlike, while the
murdering Swazis are being closely
watched by the Boers. The antagonism
between Boer and British people is more
pronounced than ever. The tiniest spark
would set both at each other's throat.
In the Yolksraad at Pretoria the cry is
"Fight them," if the British want war.
Land en Voile, the official journal at Pre
toria, editorially says: "The persecution
of our people by England is growing like
burning coal m the heart of every Afri
cander, and it only requires this step â the
sending of an expeditionâ to fan a flame,
which can only be extinguished by blood.
England will not have to reckon with a
small, though brave people, only, isolated
in a corner o: South Africa; she will have
to reckon with an army of 150,000 men,
who have grown up with rides in their
hands and do not enter frivolously upon a
struggle of this nature. We defend the
soil which has been rendered sacred to us
by the blood of our parents, and we right
an insatiable enemy, who would take from
us by violence our land, our liberty and I
our existence as a nation. It will be a
declaration of war between two nations.
There will be no more peace until the in
fluence of one of these nations shall have
been obliterated in South Africa forever."
A secret alliance still exists between the
South African Republic and Germany, no
matter what the British Government may
scy to the contrary.
The great number of people out of work
in Johannesburg' has driven hundreds of
them to robbery and burglary. The Glen
cairn gold mine was robbed by four masked
men of $25,000 worth of gold, the month's
earnings.
Ed Giles of Colorado, U. S. A., was
killed by a dynamite explosion at the
Salisbury gold mine the other day.
The Johannesburg militia (Boers and
Uitlanders) has been increased to 600 foot ,
and 250 horse. Forty tons of rifles and J
! ammunition have b?en received at Pre
toria. Two carloads of Maxim guns have i
also been received. Oue carload was sent
to Johannesburg.
Twenty thousand Johannesburgers have
signed a petition and forwarded it to Pre
toria asking for the release of the revolu
tionary prisoners, John Hays Hammond
and his associates.
Rinderpest has broken out iv several
portions of South Africa and cattle and
horses are dying like Hies before an icy
wind.
When the Matabele attacked Buluwayo
two companies of 400 each were formed in
Johannesburg and offered their services to
fight the natives. The oeople of Buluwayo
telegraphed back: "Do not want Jo
hannesburg. We remember Jameson."
At the head of the Matabele is Mlinio, or
the "god." He has proclaimed himself j
kine. The old men refuse to take part in
tne fight and leave it to the young men.
At Inyati Captain Pettendrigh, with fifty
men, attacked 300 natives. For eight hours
the fight lasted, and only one man out of
Pettendrigh's command escaped. At
Buluwayo there are fully 500 unarmed
men and 400 women and children in
laager. The Matabele have looted and de
stroyed all houses and stores in the coun
try around Buluwayo, and hundreds of
people are rendered homeless and penni
less.
Nearly 200,000 bushels of mealies (corn)
were imported into Natal from the United
States last month, tbe locust plague hav

mealies are very stiff.
Twenty-three companies have seceded
from the old Chamber of Mines and will
form a new chamber. These companies
won't have anything to do with the com
panies controlled by John Hays Ham
mond's wealthy syndicates since the at
tempted revolution. The seceding com
panies announce a separate output of gold
for tbe month.
AN ALLIANCE NECESSARY.
Premier I>l Rudini Tell* of the Advan-
tage* of the Itriebund.
ROME, Italy, May 25.â 1n reply to an
interpellation in regard to the Dreibund,
in the Chamber of Deputies to-day, the
Marquis Di Rudini, Prime Minister, said
tha,t the Dreibund was a necessity to Italy,
and declared that if such an alliance did
not exist it would be necessary to create
one. It imposed no military obligations,
he said, and it had the unique aim of pre
serving the peace of Europe. Besides, he
said, it was popular. Italy, the Premier
added, ought not to hinder the good rela
tions between France and Russia. The
friendship of England confirmed the senti
ments and interest of Italy, and completed
the Italian system of alliances.

PARIS, France, May 25. â It is learned
that the release of Italian prisoners by
King; Menelek was brought about through
the good offices of Russia, which were ac
cepted by Italy as soon as offered. It is
also said that the abandonment of the
Anglo-Italian adventure in the Soudan was
also due to the interference of Russia.

DES MOINES, la., May 25. -A terrific
cyclone 3wept across Polk County and
into the eastern edge of Jasper County be
tween 10:30 and 11 o'clock Sunday night,
leaving ueath and destruction in its trail.
There are about twenty known to be dead,
and at least as many others injured, a
number of whom will ajmost certainly die.
The storm was in many ways a remark*
able one. It appears to have started in
two sections. One came from the north
and was a fierce wind. Its first trace is
found about a mile south of AnKeny and
twelve miles north of Dcs Moines. It
seemed to be moving about due east when
it began its serious force. The first place
at wnich it did serious injury was at the
home of J. L. Woods, a mile south of
Aukeny. The other branch of the storm
contributed the rain. It started three
miles north of the first.
The two divisions met two miles east of
Ankeny and there they developed, first
the cyclone furrn with funnel and tremen
dous force and roaring and electrical dis
turbances. From this point west for near
ly twenty miles the path of the storm is a
path of desolation. At Pol City and An
keny considerable damage was done. At
Bondurant much rramage was done, but
the serious loss of life occurred by Bondu
rant to the northeast.
Tbe storm, after the cyclonic conditions
were developed, swept across the country
at terrific speed. It gave warning of its
approach to all in its path until it i?ot hear
to Valeria, Jasper County, where the most
harm was done. Here it came with such
awful force that people who saw it say
that the great black funnel, hanging down
from a blacker heaven, tore across the
prairie at a greater speed than the fastest
train. It is believed it moved at this time
about a mile a minute, the great funnel of
wind and rain and lightning aeething and
roaring and scattering debris in its path.
Nothing was left in its path. For seve
ral miles it passed through a dense forest.
Oak and elm trees two feet in diameter
were torn up by their roots or twisted off.
Where a human habitation lay in its path
the destruction -was instant.
As it approached tne eastern part of its
course it strengthened and wiped the
country clean in its path. At Valeria, a
town of 600 people, it wiped almost half of
the town out. The people were nearly all
in caves, but many of them did not even
have a warning until it was too late. Tlie
loss of life was remarkably small, consid
ering the number of buildings thai were
wrecked, and the wonderful escapes are
without number.
The path covered by the cyclone proper
is in most places from forty to eighty
rods wide. It perpetrated all the remark
able freaks for which cyclones are famous.
The iirst large building wrecked was the
Monarch schoolhouse, west of Bondurant.
Here it took up a large school, shook it
to pieces, scattered it so that very few of
the boards are to be found, and even dis
tributed the stone foundation over the
fields, while a big wooden stile over the
fence three rods from the building was
left unharmed. The huge cylindrical cast
iron stove was toseed into an oat field a
quarter of a mile away. The storm came
in some places in the form of two and m
others in the form of a single funnel. At
Bondurant there were two sweeping
along the eartn, side by side. Between
them was a calm space and in this little
damage was done. After the two consoli
dated their force seemed to be greater.
The storm struck from 10:30 to 10:40 p. M.
all along its course.
It had been a fearfully hot and sultry
day. The air had been oppressive and
still, and many people had remarked that
there was danger of a cyclone. Most of
the people were in bed. There was a rain
and thunder storm just in advance of the
cyclone, and while the wind was whistling
through the trees and the rain beating
down in sheets, suddenly an awful roar.

that every praiaie farmer knows as the
dread forerunner of the cyclone, would be
heard. Another instant and the storm
would have struck, and then all was chaos.
Those who heard it early saved themselves
in some cases by getting into their cellars
or caves. In other plnces whole families
were killed or seriously wounded and their
property destroyed.
A typical bit of destruction was at the
Bailey home, northwest of \Bondurant.
There were in the house nine w*ople, four
of them were killed and the rÂ«\t injured
so badly that it is doubtful if any of them
will recover. The house was on a bill,
high above the surrounding country, and
the funnel dipped down into it.
House, barns, outbuildings and groves
weie destroyed alike. Two minutes after
the storm struck there was no trace of the
house save the cellar, and in it were piled
the chimney and stove and half the furni
ture. The house was torn to pieces; the
boards into splinters. They were scattered
co far that no trace of them can be found
save here and there for a mile pieces of
broken lumber. This was a freak of the
storm.
At some places It would twist trees or
uproot them. At the Bailey place the
members of ttie family were blown a con
siderable distance. The bodies of the vic
tims were found in tne fields, where were
also distributed the bodies of a dozen
horses, two score of cattle and about 100
hogs that had occupied the barns and
other buildings â every animal dead.
This was the experience of the fated
home of Peter Bolenbaugh a mile further
west. What happened will never be
known. No one lives to tell of it. Mr. ami
Mrs. Bolenbaagb occupied the home with
a little boy. The house was razed so com
pletely that no sign of it can now be seen;
the three inmates were killed. Mr. Bolen
baugh had both arms broken, his head
crushed in, one leg and several ribs in
jured and his neck and jaw broken. The
boy and women were as badly hurt. They
were not found till 2 o'clock in the morn
ing. Houses unroofed and barns destroyed,
groves ruined and people killed were mere
incidents along the path of the funnel.
At Valeria where the worst damage was
done the storm struck first the house of
Charles Phelan, a wealthy farmer, on the
edge of town. Theie were five in the
house killed, two or three others with
probably fatal injuries. One of the
daughters heard the roar and got up to
rouse the others. She stepped into an upper
room. Before she could call to them the
storm was around the house.
She was pulled out of her room through
an open window and carried back in the
face of the storm about 100 feet, where she
was left on the ground unhurt. She
started to the house, to see it crumble to
splinters before her eyes. With it went
the barns and sheds around, and in an
other instant there was the most awful
scene of destruction that the storm left in
its wake. Fve in the family were killed ;
their bodies were found in the plowed
fields, where they were in fearfully muti
lated conditions and plastered with mud.
Around them were the bodies of horses
and hogs and cattle.
At Valeria the depot of the Chicago
Great Western road was wrecked. The
wires were torn down from that place to
Bondurant, and just east of Valeria th.
storm did the most remarkable piece of
work. Just near the town the railroad
goes over a grade. The track for 100 feet
was torn up and scattered, rails, ties and
all. Half a dozen rails were broken into
pieces. At Valeria, the Methodist and
Catholic churches were totally wrecked.
About a dozen of the business houses were
blown to pieces or partly wrecked. A
large part of the population w-nt into the
cyclone cave and got in its shelter a few
seconds before the storm struct.
The storm spent itself about three miles
northeast of this place, but not until it had
killed one child at the home of Douglas
Akin and fatally hurt another, wrecked
the home of Solomon Dickey and probably
fatally hurt Mr. Dickey and his sisters,
Martha Dickey and Mrs. Frank Shale.
The home of William Osborne, in the
same neighborhood, was destroyed and
four members of the family were fearfully
hurt. It is learned that two of them will
die.
As nearly a complete list of the dead as
could be had is as follows: James Max
well, struck by lightning north of Bondu
rant; Mrs. Robert Bailey, aged 60: Lizzie
Bailey, aged 19; Joe Baii'ey, agei 22; John
Bailey, aged 20; Mary Bailey, aged 13;
Peter Bolenbaueh, aged 50; Mrs. Peter
Bolenbaugh, aged 4s; Theophilus Milburn,
aged 8; Charles Pnelan. aged 45; Susie
Phelan, aged 18; Michael Phelan, aged 8;
Charles Phelan Jr., aged 5; Nellie Phelan,
aeed 5 months; Dannie Phelan, aged 12;
Martha AKin, infant child of Douglas
Akin; John Yates, back brofcen, will die.
The list of seriously injured is not com
plete, but includes as those expected to die
the following: Teeney Bailey, aged 16;
Johnnie Bailey, aged 12; Solomon and
Mrs. Solomon Dickey, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Dickey, Robert Bailey, Mrs.
Charles Phelan and two daughters, two
children of Douglas Akin, Mrs. Martha
Dickey; Mrs. Shale, sister of Mr. Dickey.
Abide from these there were many minor
injuries.
McGREGOR, lowa, May 25.â Words are
inadequate to fitly describe the scene of
desolation caused by last night's terrible
cloudburst in historic Bloody Run. For
ten miles west of this place everything is
in ruins. All the afternoon threatening
clouds were gathering and about 1 o'ciook
this morning the storm burst in its fury,
soon deluging the valley. It swept all be
fore it. Fifteen people were drowned as
far as known.
The names of the missing are: Mrs.
John Maloney, four children of Lawrence
Meyer, Mike Havick. John Livac, John
Kattlec.
Six bodies have been recovered and iden
tified as follows: Michael Maloney, Mrs.
Burke and son, Mrs. Meyer and son, John
Malcney.
Some of the unfortunate victims are sup
posed to have been carried out into the
Mississippi River, in which the Bloody
Run empties at North McGregor. About
ten miles oi track of the Chicago, Milwau
kee and St. Paul railway has been washed
away. A large number of freightcars were
standing on the tracks in the west yards.
They are piled in shapeless masses along
the valley. The loss to the road will
probably reach $100,000. Happy homes
with their human lives were torn away
and hurled into the black and rushing
waters.
The station at Beulab, about nine miles
west, was washed away, and he agent and
family barely- escaped wi!h their lives.
Wincen & Son'a lumber-mill was badly
damaged and over 100,000 feet of lumber
swept away. The valley for twelve miles
is one vast wreck, and the damage to
mills, houses and farms cannot be esti
mated.
OELWEIN, lowa, May 25.â A cyclone
passed through Mingo shortly after mid
night. The following were killed: Mrs.
Martha Dickey. Mrs. Whitney, Mrs. Schell
and a child of D. Aikin.
Injuredâ S. Diciey and child, D. and
Mrs. Aikin, J. M. Osborne, Mrs. Osborne
and child, F. Leaver, Alex Trammett.
D. Aikiu's house was totally destroyed^
as were thoseof Mr. Osborne. Mr. Dickey.
Mr. Leaver and Mr. Trammett also lost
some of their possessions. The cyclone
tore up trees and destroyed everything in
its path, and caused great damage to the
Great Western Railway, carrying away
several bridges and miles of telegraph
wires and poles and delaying trains badly.
DURANGO, lowa, May 25.â Mrs. J. ML
Clark, station agent of the Cryr.ago and
Great Western Railway, lost five of her six
children in the flood and cyclone last
night, and Tom Griffin, a brakeman, went
to his death while making an attempt to
save the sixth. Mrs. Clark was called up
during the night to report the condition
of the track. Accompanied by her chil
dren she had just reached the depot when
a territlc rush of water came, carrying the
depot away. Five of trie children were
drowned. Thomas Griffin, a brakenian
employed on the road, made a brave but
ineffectual effort to save the remaining
child and lost hiÂ« life. Mrs. Clark saved
one child, although they were carried
some distance by the water. The body of
one child has been recovered.

ORTONVILLE, Mich.. May 25.â A cy
clone swept over the northern portion of
Oakland County this afternoon. The
btorm passed about half a mile north of
this village. It came from the west and

Metamora, a town a few miles north of
Thomas, on the line of the Michigan Cen
tral, also suffered severely.
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., May 25.-A
cyclone struck here this evening. About
twenty-five houses were demolished, but
as far as cau be learned nobody was
killed. Mrs. Pohl ana three sons were
seriously and perhaps fatally hurt. The
cyclone has done an immense amount of
damaue to the surrounding country, many
farmhouses having been demolished, and.
it is feared later reports will show that
many lives have been lost in this section
of Macomb County.
LAKE VIEW, Mich., May 25.â A small
cyclone struck this place this afternoon
destroying crop?, trees and buildings of
all kinds. A large barn on Robert Edear's
place was demolished and one occupied by
Fred Edgar was moved from its founda
tion and crushed. No one was killed, so
far as learned.
DULUTH, Minx.. May 25.â What was
probably the tail end of the lowa cyclone
passed over Duluth this afternoon. Sev
eral chimneys were blown down and some
houses were unroofed. A sailboat con
taining a pleasure party of four persons
capsized on Lake Superior and after hard
work by the iife-saving crew they were
rescued.
MOUNT CARROLL, 111., May 2. r >.â The
hardest storm ever experienced in this sec
tion broke last night and continued four
hours. Carroil Creek rose twenty feet in
half an hour. The J. M. Shirk Company's
milldam broke, flooding the electric-light
plant, Lebeker's carriage manufactory, the
Mount Carroll tannery and all the build
ings along Galena avenue. The fire alarm
was rang at 1 o'clock, and people were
rescued on improvised raft<. Two hun
dred feet of the Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul Railroad track was washed out.
Hundreds of cattle and horses were
drowned. The damage in Carroll County
alone is estimated at $100,000.
OELWIN, lowa, May 25.â A terrible
wind and rain Btorm latt night through
Deleware and Dubuque counties caused
great damage. The Chicago, Milwaukee
and St. Paul. Illinois Central and Chicago
and Great Western railroads are washed
out, bridges and culverts destroyed and
the track torn up for miles. The storm
was most severe between Oneida and Du
buque. A firm of contractors at Graf lost
a complete outfit of tents, wagons, tools
and thirty-five or forty horses. The rail

through this section.
PONTIAC, Mich., May 25.â Reports from
Ortonville, Oakwood, Oxford and Thomas,
which are located in Oakland County,
north of here, say that a cyclone swept

sons lost their lives at Ortonville, while at
Thomas four were killed.
CHICAGO, 111., May 25.â A storm of
wind, rain, thunder and* lightning struck
Chicago this morning. Over an inch of
water fell in les3 than ten minutes. The
sewers were unable to carry off the water
and basements all over the city were
flooded. The pressrooms of the three
morning papers were flooded, and fire
engines had to be called to pump out the
water before the second editions could be
sent to press. Much damage is reported.
The storm extended south into Will and
Kankakee couuties. All telegraph wires
are down in this vicinity. On the lake
there was a tremendous storm. It is prob
able that many wrecks will be reported.
Thousands of persons living in the South
Shore suburb of Ravenswood and Lake
view narrowly escaped death by inhaling
illuminating gas. The district affected ex
tended from Fullerton avenue to Edge
water. The pressure in the mains was
reduced just enough to extinguish the
lights in houses, where jets are kept burn
ing all the time, and the escaping gas soon
filled the rooms. As soon as the police
learned of the danger every officer availa
ble was sent out to notify the sleeping
people of their danger. The aroused peo
ple thought the town was afire, and many
were so much overcome by the fumes that
several hours in the fresh air was necssary
to restore them.
While Policeman John Mc3ann , of
Lakeview was at work saving other people
his children were lying at home inhaling
thn deadly gas. Mrs. McUann was aroused
by the storm. She aroused her sister, and
the four children were revived in the ooen
air. The sleeping occupants of the Wave
land Flats in Lakewiew were panic
stricken when the police awakened them
to their danger.
Some ran out in their night clothes,
thinking the building was on fire. The
forty families were aroused in time to save
all from asphyxiation.
ROCKFORD, 111., May 25. â General
Hildebarand, his wife and daughter were

is said one woman was lmliit ujuibOj' the
cyclone. Davis Junction was also a vic
tim of the storm to a serious extent. In
this city the storm raced for more than an
hour, filling the air with balls of electric
fire, arid flashes of lightning followed with
frightful rapidity. The city, however, es
caped the destructive force of the storm,
the cnief damage being to houses struck
by lightning, first floors and basements
flooded and telephone wires prostrated.
In the northern part of the county there,
was a vicious downuonr of hail, which
ruined crops ana made roads impassable.
Thousands of store and residence win
dows were broken and the railroads into
the city were prostrated by washouts,
while all wires are down. The tracks are
strewn with the wreckage. All the win
dows in the Northwestern train were shat
tered as it pulled in here and the passen
gers had to be transferred.
ROCKFORD, 111., May 25.â Several
people were killed and many thousands
of dollars damage was done to property
by a storm of wind, hail aud rain which
swept upon this region last nicht. Other
persons were injured, some fatally. Tne
storm was most severe southeast ot the
city. At midnight a cyclone struck one
mile south of Egan City, wrecking the
residence of Mrs. Isora Bird and killing
her instantly. Her two girls and two boya
were badly hurt. The oldest girl's arm
was fractured and she was internally in
jured. It is not beiieved the youngest girl
will live.
Big trees were torn from the earth, crops
ruined and other damage done.
BURLINGTON, la., May 25.â This city
was struck by a furious storm last night,
rain and hail being the predominating
element. The wind destroyed a church,
part of the Atlas mill and many smoke
stacks. South of the town a cyclone de
veloped, tearing up trees and destroying
crops.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ixd., May 25.â Two
inches of rain fell here this morning and
the streets were flooded. The wind blew a
imrricane, destroying shade trees, and hail
did some damage to fruit. The sewers
were not equal to carrying off the flood
and many cellars were deluged.
SUGAR BOUNTY CASES,
Funds to Pay Claims Are Made
Available by the Supreme
Court Decision.
Over Five Million Dollars Can Now
Be Disbursed in Bounties to
Growers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.â The
effect of the decision of the suger bounty
cases by the United States Supreme Court
will make immediately available for their
payment more than $5,250,000. For the
payment of the cane, beet and sorghum
sugar claims, Congress appropriated $5,
-000,000. These claims amount to $6,111,
-505, and are classed as follows: Louisiana
473 claims, $5,591,617; Third Texas District
13 claims, $123,812; Fiorida U claims, $5,
-655; California 3 claims, $293,208; Nebraska
1 c^aim, $45,087; Kansas 2 claims, $6259;
Utah 1 claim, $45,862; total, 502 claims,
$6,111,505.
All these claims haye been approved by
the Commissioner, and as the total
amount allowed is larger than the appro
priation the claim will have to be pro
rated or an additional appropriation made
to meet tnem. When the bounty was re
pealed certain sugar-producers had com
pleted their production and presented
claims for bounty, and these claims,
amounting to $2;i8,286, remain unpaid. Of
this class of claims $121,738 worth were for
maple sugar, distributed through the
Eastern States.
In this same class were thirty-three
claims for bounty on sugars other than
maple, as follows, cents omitted: First
California District, six claims, $71,804;
Louisiana, twenty-two claims, 125,029;
Nebraska, two claims, $14,826; Third Texas
District, one ciaim, $1234; Fiorida. one
claim, $3022; Kansas, one claim, $436.
Total, thirty-three claims, $116,503.
All these claims of every class have
passed through the office of the Commis
sioner of Internal Revenue and have been
approved. They will now be forwarded to
the Auditor and then to Comptroller
Bowler for his signature. It will probably
be July next before any of the claims will
be paid in the ordinary treasury routine.

WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.-The
appropriation of $1,542,989, to pay the
transportation claims of the Southern
Pacific Company, waa passed In the Sen
ate to-day, and although both Senators
White and Perkins were present, neither
lifted his voice in opposition to this appro
priation. The California representatives
have successfully opposed the item from
year to year, and Judge Maguire says that
he will fight it when the deiiciency bill re

that this amount is provided for as an

MANY MILLIONS
ARE APPROPRIATED
Final Passage of the Gen
eral Deficiency Bill by
the Senate.
AMENDMENTS ADDED.
Considerable Tacked 0a to Pay
the French Spoliation
Claims.
BUTLER'S BOND RESOLUTION.
An Unsuccessful Effort to Cause Fur
ther Consideration of the
Measure.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.â The
lasLof the general appropriation bills, the
deficiency bill, engaged the attention of
the Senate to-day. As reported it covers
items ag.regating $9,000,000, about twice
the amount it carried when it came from
the House. In its progress throueh the
feenate the aggregate was still more in
creased by the appropriation of over a
million dollars for providing in the French
spoilation claims of over half a million
dollars for findings of the court of claims
under the Bowman act and $174,445 for the
Choteau claim in building an iron steam
battery in \Mi.
At the close of the routine morning
business Hale (R.)of Maine moved to con
sider the deficiency bill â the last of the
general appropriation billsâ and it was
taken up. Among the amendments re
ported were the following : To pay $8750
to the widow of the late United States
Minister to Mexico, Isaac P. Gray; appro
priating $1)517 for all outstanding claims
against the World's Columbian Commis
sion ; appropriating $46,000 for the leasing
of a suitable building and equipment for
the sampling and assaying of imported
silver ores and other ores containing lead;
appropriating $2506 to compensate tl.e
owners of the Norwegian steamer Peter
Jebsen for damages from collision with
the United States revenue steamer Rusa
in San Francisco harbor in March,
1896; appropriating $1,542,979 to pay
transportation claims ot the southern Pa
cific; $i 59,600 for three deaths and for the
injuries of Government employes at the
Ford's Theater disaster in June, 1893;
$1235, for payment for interior finish oi
courthouse and postoffice at Denver, Colo. ;
$15,000, for a road near the National Ceme
tery in Puiaski County, 111.; increasing
the appropriation for the survey of lunds
in California from $20,000 to $40,1)00.
At 2 r. M. the prohibitory bond bill came
up as tne unfinished business. An appeal
was made to Butler (Pop.) of North talo
lina, author of the bill, to let it go over
until the appropriation bill was finished.
That was relused, and then efforts were
made to have an hour fixed on Wednes
day or Tnursday next ior taking the vote
on the bond biil.
Objection was made by Palmer, who
stated very positively that no such aicree
ment could be made. Fnally unanimous
consent was given that the bill be pro
ceeded with.
At 2 r. m. the consideration of the de
ficiency bill was suspended and the bond
bill was laid before the Senate as the un
finished business, but Butler finally
yielded so far as to allow the deficiency
bill to be proceeded with.
The bill as passed by the House appro
priated $4,793,55*0 und as reported by the
Senate committee, $8,956,298. The Senate
amendments, having been all disposed of,
the bill was open to general amendment.
Ananiendment to one ot its items, Ford's
Theater disaster, offered by Pugh (D.) of
Alabama, provoked a long discussion and
was eventually defeatedâ ayes 20, noes 25.
An amendment to insert an item to pay
the claim of John Roach, the ship-builder,
was offered by Mitchell (R.) of Oregon,
and was after a long discussion ruled out.
An amendment to pay $2500 to Mr.
Dupont for counsel fees, time and ex
penses, in prosecuting his right to a Beat
in the Senate, and $2500 to the three coun
sel engaged in opposition to him, was
offered by Mr. Mitchell and agreed to.
An amendment appropriating $1,027,314
for findings of the Court of Claiois in 341 of
the French spoilation claims (exclusive of
insurance claims) was offered by Warren
(R.) of Wyoming as a report from the
Committee on Claims, and was, after dis
cussion, declared to be in order by a vote
of 32 to 14. Various other amendments
for claims found due under the Bowman
act were effected and agreed to. Several
of these amendments having been offered
by Cockrell (D.) of Missouri it was sug
gested by Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire
humorously that Cockrell's object was to
load down the bill with private claims, so
as to make it odious and cause all of them
to be thrown out.
Cockrell declared that if be were to be
on the conference committee the Senate
would not recede. He would rather keep
Congress in session till the 4th of March
next.
Chandler twitted Cockrell with having
shown a want of temper and with not act
ing with his known judgment. Cockrell
retorted that the Senator was showing a
want of balance and a resentful feeling
and that the Senator's insinuation was
unworthy of him and one which he ought
never to have made and never would
have made if he had kept his temper.
[Laughter.]
Hill, in a humorous vein, offered an
amendment appropriating $50,000 for 50,
-000 copies of the United States Red Book
published by James B. Lyon at Albany,
N. Y. He said, in answer to inquiries,
that the book gave the likeness and bi
ography of ah the Senatorsâ the finest
body of men in the country. [Laughter.]
A point of order was made by Hale, and
Hill expressed the hope that "the good
humored Vice-Prestdent would do with it
as he had done with the French spoliation
amendment, and submit the question of
order to the Senate. The Vice-President
promptly submitted the question, and the
Senate ruled the amendment out of order.
Finally the bill was passed.
The conference report on the sundry
civil appropriation bill was presented, and
ordered printed.
SESSION OF THE HOUSE.
liitcustion of a Bill to Repeal a Section
of the Tariff Law.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.âTo
day's session uuder the rules was devoted
to District of Columbia affairs. The cal
endar was soon cleared, however, and the
remainder of the session was spent in com
mittee of the whole, considering the bill
to repeal that section of the tariff law pro
viding for a rebate on alcohol used in the
arts and medicinal compounds.
Evans of Kentucky, on behalf of the
Ways and Means Committee, offered an
amendment providing for the appoint
ment of a committee of three Senators and
three Representativss to consider the
question relating to the use of alcohol in
the arts and manufactures free of tax and
to report to the next session of Congress.
In advocating the passage of the bill
Evans stated that no regulations could bo
framed by the Treasury Department, as
the language of the section directed, that
would protect the Government and
that the Government stood to lose be
tween $250,000 and $300,000 in claims every
day since it was enacted.
Russell and Hill spoke in opposition.
The latter gave notice that ne would move
to strike out the repeal clause and insert
instead an amendment for a committee of
investigation. The bill was not disposed
of, when at 5 o'clock the committee arose

NOT ALLOWED TO HUNT.
Decision of the Supreme Court as to the
Rights of Bannocks.
WASHINGTON, D. C, May 25.â 1n the
case of John H. Ward, Sheriff of Uintah
County, Wyo., vs. Race Horse, a Bannock
Indian, involving the treaty with the Ban
nocks, giving them the right to hunt on
unoccupied public lands, the Supreme
Court of the United States to-day decided
that the right to hunt on these lands
could not be exercised in contravention
of the i^tate law forbidding the hunting of
wild animals. Race Horse was arrested
for violating the game law of the State,
the arrest being part of the incident which
led to the Jackson Hole trouble last year.
Justice Brown dissented from the judge
ment for the reason that it violated the
terms of a treaty between the United
States and the Indians.
NEW BISHOP TO AFRICA.
Er. Hartzell Elected by the
General M. E. Church
Conference.
The Long Delayed Fight B tween Lay
ard Ministerial Delegates
Ccmes Up.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 25.â The Gen
eral Conference of tne Methodist Episcopal
church to-day elected Dr. Jiyseph C. Hart
zell of Louisiana Bishop to Africa.
But four days of the session remain, and
all speeches were limited to five minutes.
Trustees of the new university at Wash
ington were named during the morning.
They are all Eastern men. The long
deferred fight between the lay and minis
terial delegates came up when the com
mittee on constitution reported the new
constitution. The majority report want a
referendum to be composed of ministers,
while the minority report demanded that
the lay members be given a voice in the
referendum. Dr. A. J. Kinnett of Phila*
delphia made a strong argument in favor
of laymen.
R. S. Warthout of Michigan declared
that the report of the constitutional com
mittee was a failure. "What a miserable
farce was the consideration of the woman
question by this body. We first considered
the question as a judicial one, and then
compromised it by virtue of our lecislative
poweis. That kind of work makes our
conference ridiculous. I am opposed to
the report f because it gives nothing new."
A motion to amend the report was lost.
The committee on Epworth League
recommended that certain members of the
board of control be appointed by the
General Conference instead of by the rep
resentatives of the league. The recom
mendation wtts adopted.
Bishop Hurst presided over the after
noon session and again showed himself
utterly deficient in parliamentary law and
in curbing the restless spirits of the con
vention. The scenes of disorder were only
equaled by those which occurred when he
presided over the convention in its dis
cussion of the woman question. Nomina
tions of aa additional secretary oftheFreed
raen's Aid Society were in order, and out
of a field of four M. C. Mason of Savan
nah, Ga., colored, was chosen on the first
ballot.
PRESRYTERLLE ASSEMBLY.
Plant for the Union of All Young Peo
ple's Societies.
SARATOGA. N. V., May 25.â Tne Pres
byterian General Assembly resumed its
session to-day with the usual half-hour's
devotional exercises. The Board of Freed
men's report was considered and recom
mendation in regard to its work adopted.
The report of the special committee on
young people's societies was again taken
up. This matter was raised at Pittsburg
by a request for the formal indorsement of
the Christian Endeavor Union and for the
establishment in the Fifth-avenue Presby
terian House of a young people's society
and headquarters with a beard of secreta
ries.
A special committee was appointed at
Pittsburg, and a plan for the supervision
and government of such societies a? al
ready exist in the church was prepared
and reported to the assembly.
The consideration of a proposal to pre
pare a plan for the union of all Presby
terian young people's societies was then
taken up. Rev. Dr. Lane of Weatchester
County opposed the clause, and argued for
the discharge of the committee on the
ground that the proposal of a denomina
tional young people's society to take the
place of the Christian Endeavor was un
wise. Recess was taken with the matter
still undecided.
At the afternoon session Dr. William H.
Hubbard, editor of the Assembly Record,
read a series of propositions regarding the
Presbyterian mission-house and offered a
resolution looking to the disposition of
the property on Fifth avenue, as it was
not a paying concern. It was decided to
report the mattes to-morrow.
The report of the committee on educa
tion was then read and received. Rev. Dr.
Joseph Smith then read the report of the
special committee on church unity. The
report of the committee on church unity
which was before the assembly before was
laid on the table and the assembly ad
journed. . '

HUSSELLMAN, THE
BOLD BIGAMIST,
The Gay San Franciscan Is
Wanted at Wooster,
Ohio.
WEDDED MANY WOMEN.
So It Comes to Pass That Several
Wronged Wives Are on
His Trail.
NOTED AS A SMOOTH FELLOW.
Matrimony a Pleasant Diversion in
His Prolonged Career of Bare
faced Swindling.
SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, May 25.â A San
Francisco man is at present badly wanted
in Wooster, Ohio. From developments it
appears that be is a bigamist of unbounded
ambition. The story is this:
Four years ago there arrived in Wooster
a tall, heavy 6et man, evidently about 55
years of age. He was a man of good ad
dress, and as he seemed to have plenty of
cash he was not long in gaining a stand
ing in business and society circles. He
represented himself as the patentee of a
wire fence, of which he said he had sold
hundreds of miles. He gave his name as
Samuel B. Hussellman, and through hav
ing once met Jehn Kunert, became ac
quainted with Kate Kunert, his widow.
She had some money and a cozy home on
the leading residence street of the city.
Hussellman proposed to and wedded Mrs.
Knnertatthe home of a friend in Dallas,
Tex. On returning to Wooster Hussell
man had the home of his wife torn down
and replaced by a fine $5000 mansion. It
turned out later that he had used his
wife's money in doing this, besides using
a great deal of cash and leaving a mort
gage on the premises for $1300.
About the time the house was com
pleted Marshal Ellsperman received sev
eral letters from a woman in San Fran
cisco who claimed to be Hussellman's
wife and mother of four children. She
was anxious to have him prosecuted for
bigamy.
Hussellraan learned of the receipt of the
letters from California and suddenly left
Wooster. This was two years ago. Not a
great while after this Mrs. Hussellman re
ceived letters from Auburn, Ind., which
showed apparently that there was a woman
there who also claimed to have wedded
him. Since that time she says she has
learned that there are several other
women who claim to be wives of Husseli
man. Nothing has been heard from him
for over a year until a few days ago, when
the Washington (D. C.) papers contained
a long article telling of Hussellman's
transactions in that city, and of his mr
dictments for swindling in selling deeds
for a patent wire fence to which he had no
claim.
The* Wooster wife on hearing of his be
ing wanted offered to furnish a full de
scription so he could be identified. The
woman is nearly crazed through the vil
lainy of Hussellman, having let him use
up all of her ready cash and signed mort
gages which she is sorely pressed to pay.
Her beautiful home may soon be sold as a
result of Hussellman's scheming rascality.
Cregan and Becker Coming.
NEWARK, N. J., May 25.â James
Cregan and Charles Becker, the bank
forgers, were formally turned over to the
California authorities this morning. A
writ of habeas corpus applied for by M. T.
Barrett for the prisoners was withdrawn
before Judge Fitzpatrick. The prisoners
will reach San Francisco Saturday next.
The property owned by Cregan in New
York has been converted into cash. It is
said the prisoners will make full restitu
tion to tbeNevada Bank.

SO SAYS MR. TILLMAN.
Border States Cannot Stay in
the Party on a Gold
Platform.
HABRITY IS NOT THE MASTEE.
The South Carolina Senator Declares
That He Is Only a Servant of
the Democrats.
WABHINGTON. D. C, May 25.âSena
tor Tillman has been on a tour through
the South, having made speeches in Texas,
Arkansas. Fiorida and in his own State,
where he went to attend the iState Conven
tion.
"Everywhere the sentiment is for free
silver," said he to Thk Call corres
pondent.
"Do you think there would be much of a
bolt at Chicoeo should the convention be
for gold and nominate a gold man?"
. "I think the whole South and "West
would walk out. The border States can't
stay in the party on a gold platform."
"Do you think the silver men will con
trol at Chicago?"
"Oh, yes, they are sure to be in control
by upward of a hundred majority."
The first of ttie Tillman badges have
shown up at the Capitol. It is a silver
pitchfork with three prongs, and on each
prong is impaled a gold bug. On the
handle of the pitchfork is "Tillman,'' and
the gold bugs impaled on prongs are
labeled "Sherman," "Carlisle" and "Cleve
land." The badges are being turned out
by an Atlanta concern at the rate of hun
dreds a day, and are being worn exten
sively in the fcouth. There are said to be
hundreds of them at Atlanta. With the
appearance of the Tillman pitchfork is the
Carlisle badge made like the badges of the
Republican candidate. Besides a picture
of Carlisle there is "For President, J. G.
Carlisle."
Commenting to-day on Chairman Har
rity's threat that would-be bolters may be
debarred from the National Democratic
Convention, Senator Tillman said:
"Harrity's bluster will have no more
effect on the National Convention than
Michigan boodle. He forgets that he is
not master of the Democratic party and is
only its servant."
TO SHAPE TWO PLATFORMS.
Importance of a Convention to Me Meld
at Liet.roiL
DETROIT, Mich., May 25.â A great
convention of representatives of the
commercial, manufacturing, labor and
aericuitural organizations oi the United
States, with the avowed purpose of
influencing the formation of the platforms
of both the Republican and Democratic
parties at their coming conventions, will
be held in this city, opening on Tuesday,
June 2.
The plans which this convention will
adopt will be put in proper shape and a
committee appointed to present them to
the two great political conventions to be
held in June and July respectively, and to
urge their embodiment in their respective
platforms.
The subjects to be acted upon at this
convention will be as follows:
First â The discussion uf way* and means
for taking the tariff question out of parti-
Gan politics and making it a business ques
tion, instead of a "political football."
Second â The discussion of ways and
means for the improvement of the con
sular service of the United States and the
employment of such service for the in
creasing of our foreign trade, especially
with the Central and South American Re
publics.
Third â The advisability of recommend
ing to Congress the creation of a depart
ment of commerce, manufactures and
labor, and of making the chief of such de
partmenta member of the President's Cab
inet.
Fourth â The advisability of forming a
permanent organization for the purpose of
holding annual conventions for the con
sideration of National questions and of
recommending to Congress each year such
changes in our laws or in their administra
tion as may be deemed for the best interest
of our country.
The convention will be non-political and
non-sectional, and all questions must be
discussed from a purely commercial stand
point.
Over 200 organizations have already
agreed to send delegates, and 2000 others
have been invited to send representatives,
besides which a very large number of busi
ness men are expected to be on hand and
take part in the discussions, and with that
end in view 25,000 personal invitations are
being sent out.
In addition to these an invitation is ex
tended to every individual citizen to at
tend the convention and take part in the
discussions, who may be interested in the
questions to be discussed, and who be
lieves that more can be accomplished by
the united effort of all the different inter
ests involved than by each independently
of the others.
The invitation is sent out by the city of
Detroit and bears the signature ot Hon.
H. S. Pingree, Mayor; General R. A. Al
ger of the Chamber of Commerce; George
H. Barbour, president of the Manufactur
ers' Club, and J. B. Howarth, president of
the Merchants' and Manufacturers' Ex
change.
Arrangements are being made to have
a number of eminent speakers present,
men who are prominent in the commer
cial, manufacturing, labor and agricul
tural pursuits, as well as those in public
life.
The following are the members of the
committee which will bave charge of the
convention:
J^in B. Howarth, president oi the Mer
chants' and Manufacturers' Exchange, De
troit, Mich. .

THERE WILL, BE NO COMPROMISE.
Democratic factions to Fight to a finish
at Chicago.
NEW YORK, N. V., May 25.â A Herald
special from Washington says: There will
be no compromise at the Chicago conven
tion on the money question if the ad
ministration can prevent it. It will be a
tight to a finish so far as President Cleve
land is concerned.
"We want no compromise, no juggling,
no straddling," said a member of the
Cabinet yesterday. "The country can
never have peace and confidence until the
silver goblin is laid away in its grave."
"Do you concede that the Chicago con
vention is to be controlled by the silver
men?" was asked.
"I do not. While the outlook is not
bright, the battle is still on. Our reports
from Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio are not
so discouraging. We are going to carry
those States, or two of them at least.
Illinois appears to be dominated by a
local machine which suppresses the voice
of the members of the party. If the
Democrats of Chicago stand on their
rights and refuse to submit to such out
rageous imposition as that put on them by
the machine they will do exactly rieht.
It a man proposes to hold a primary with
me he must give me acnance to vote. If
the Democrats of Illinois stand on their
rights and appeal the case to the National
Committee, I believe the National Com
mittee will sustain them. If they have
justice done their side they will be given
seats in the temporary organization of the
convention, just as tne gold Democrats of
Nebraska, like Colorado and other States,
were seated."
"Suppose the silver men obtain control
of the convention, notwithstanding the
National Committee, and go for free coin
age at 16 to 1, will there be another Demo
cratic ticket in the field?"
"No matter which side obtains control
of the convention, I believe there will be
two Democratic tickets. The silver lead
ers have already threatened to bolt if they
cannot rule. We do not make threats.
But it is obvious Democrats who believe
free coinage will ruin the country cannot
vote for a free-silver candidate for Presi
dent Nor do we want to vote for Mc-
Kinley. There seems nothing to do but to
name a ticket of our own and give sound
money Democrats something to rally
round. I have no idea whom we would
nominate in case we find it necessary to
put a ticket in the field.
"If this were the President's first term I
am satisfied he would be willing to run
acain, deliberately sacrificing himself for
the good of the country and the party.
But the prejudice against the third term
changes the case materially, and I doubt
if the President would be willing to serve.
He would care nothing for defeat if he
could be of any real service to his party
and the Nation. He is too big and cour
ageous for that. But he would be accused
of possessing an ambition which stops at
nothing, while we who know him well
know his ambition is satisfied, and that
nothing but a great sense of duty could
induce him to have anything more to do
with politics."
AN INFORMAL RECEPTION.
McKinley Greeted by Representative Re
publicans of Several States.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 24.âEx-Gov
ernor McKinley held an informal recep
tion in the office of M. A. Hanna to-day.
There were men from every section of the
country present.
After the greetings were over there was a
quiet little caucus at which the following
were present: Harrison Gray Otis of Los
Angeles, Cal. ; W. T. Durbin, lndiapolis;
ex-Collector Wimberly, Louisiana; Colo
nel Fred Grant, New York; If. P. Handy,
Chicago; Morton H. Allen, Albany, N. V.;
H. A. Booth, Judge John T. Caples and
J. D. McCullough, Oregon ; C. G. McDou
gall and John F. Milholland, New York.
The whole situation was discussed,
though all parties refused to tell what was
said except that McKinley was the man
who would be nominated. McKinley left
for Canton when the meeting was over.
When asked about the rumored visit of
Samuel Fessenden, CJarkson's right-hand
man, to Mr. McKinley at Canton, Mr.
Hanna said : "Well. I really had not seen
the report that he intended to come, but I
can tell you that all those stories are ca
nards."
H. A. Booth, who is a delegate to St.
Louis from Oregon, was spokesman for the
party of men from that State who called
on Mr. Hanna, and he said: "There is
some free-silver talk in our State, but at
present the great majority are for sound
money, and, what is better, they are for
McKinley."
CAMPHELL'S ROOM WANES.
Some Democrat* Say There Is No Hanger
of Mis Itrinq nominated.
Washington, d. c, May 25.-The
latest statement of ex-Governor Campbell
that he would accept the nomination at
Chicago, even on a silver platform, but
that he does not want the honor at all,
creates no comment and little interest at
the Capitol. The silver men, from con
versations with some of them this morn
ing, view the announcement indifferently.
Their feelintr may be summed up in the
remark of Representative Terry of Arkan
sas, who said: "There is no danger that
Mr. Campbell will be nominated. We
will nominate a silver man."
The majority of the others seen did not
care to have their names used, as they did
not want to offend mo good and popular a
Democrat as Campbell, but they said that
a straight silver man would be the nomi
nee. Ex-Governor Campbell's ideas on
international bimetallism do not suit any
of them. _______^__

contest that this charming young lady

The principal leaders in the race were

Deen spirited from the beginning, and the
Native Sons are rejoicing over the success
of the affair. Over 4000 ballots were cast.
As soon as Mis? Schluer was notified of
her election, she sent a note to Miss Mor

questing her to act as ber maid of honor.
Miss Morris gracefully accepted. The oth

Physicians Announce After a Consultation
That Bishop Wingfield Cannot
Recover.
BENICIA, Cal., May 25.â The condition
of Bishop Wingfield continues very critical.
A consultation was held by Drs. Downing

might come within a few hours.

-possible. Telegrams have been arriving
from all over the country expressing
sympathy.
NEVADA CITY'S HEROINE.
Mrs. Belle Douglass Rescues a l>rotcn-
ing Child.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., May 25.-A
woman's presence of mind yesterday
saved Matilda Appel, aged 11 years, from
drowning. While out walking with Mrs.
Belle Douglass the child climbed to the
top of a knoll in the old Hirschman hy
draulic claim and then ran swiftly down
the other side, at the foot of which was a
deep reservoir.
Her speed was so great that she could
not stop, but plunged into the water,
which was 6 or 8 feet deep.
Mrs. Douglass saw the child's peril and,
glancing quickly about her, espied a willow
pole which had been used for a fishing
rod. The girl was about to sink the second
time, when the pole was passed to her.
She grasped it and was pulled to the shore
and lifted out.
WILL DIE AT FOLSOM.
Governor Jiudd Refutes to Reprieve a
Kanaka Murderer.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., May 25.â E. M.
Walsh of San Francisco, representing the
Hawaiian Government, appeared before
Governor Budd to-day, asking for a com
mutation of the sf ntence of death pro
nounced against Paulo Kaumano, a Ka
naka, convicted of murdering an old lady
in El Dorado County several years ago.
The execution was to have taken place
April 10, but the Governor at that time
granted a reprieve of sixty days as a cour
tesy to the Hawaiian Government, which
had asked for time to look into the facts of
the case.
The application for a commutation this
morning was opposed by the District At
torney. After hearing the argument on
both sides the Governor refused to take
action in the matter. Kaumano will be
executed at folsom June 10.
SUMMIT LAKE FACTIONS CLASH.
Battle for the Possession of an Irrigation
Dam â Several Shots Are Ex
changed.
VISALIA. Cal.. May 25.â The war be
tween factions contending for water
rights in the Summit Lake country, on the
west side, is being waged with increased
bitterness. On Saturday night armed
bands fought with revolversâ one in de
fense of a dam and the other in an at
tempt to destroy the barrier. The details
of the conflict received here are meager.
Some time ago one of the dams of the
Crescent Ditch Company was blown out
with dynamite by enemies of the com
pany. It was soon replaced and a guard
of six men put in charge. One night the
guards were surprised and overpowered
by a body of men, who lost no time in
again destroying the dam. Again the
company restored it and put on guard a
numbsr of men whom they believed would
not be caught napping.
These new guards purchased a lot of
lamps with reflectors, for use at night, in
order that no one could steal upon tbem
in the dark. This scheme worked too
well to ?atisfv the other faction, which
had necome impatient at the slow pro
cesses of law in water litigation. Last
Saturday night a squad of men made a
rush on the guards to again overpower
them. This time they were met by a
fusillade of bullets and driven back. They
returned the fire, and though it is be
lieved se-eral men were wounded in the
affray the extent of the damage done is
kept secret.

MURDER ENDS A
FIREBAUGH FEUD,
Alexander Betbeder Shot to
Death by John W.
Lambert.
FIGHT OVER A TRIFLE.
The Slayer Holds His Victim and
Sends a Bullet Through
His Heart
THEY HAD BEEN PARTNERS.
A Dispute Over Business Matters Led
to a Quarrel and a Sep
aration.
FRESNO, Cal., May 24.â John W. Lam
bert shot and killed Alexander Betbeder
at Firehaugh last evening. Both were
prominent citizens of their community
and the western portion of the county is
in great excitement over the affair. The
shooting occurred at Lambert's saloon.
Betbeder was circulating a petition to
have the Supervisors oust Justice of thi>
Peace W. S. Crawford from office, and
called upon Lambert for his signature.
This the proprietor of the saloon refused
and hot words were passed.
Up to two months ago Betbeder had an
interest in the saloon. The partnership
was dissolved because of a business mis
understanding. Lambert bought his part
ner's interest, but it appears that the dis
solution did not alleviate hard feeling be
tween the two men, so when they became
excited over the petition disagreement yes
terday the former trouble was quickly
brought up. Lambert excitedly remarked
to Betbeder:
"You have not used me right, anyway."
Betbeder said something in reply and
Lambert called him a liar. Betbeder
struck at Lambert, who dodged and struck
back. A Â« he did so he turned and ran
toward his bedroom in the rear part of the
saloon. The door leading to it was locked ;
with a violent kick he broke it in. In the
meantime Lambert's barkeeper was hust
ling Betbeder out of the saloon so as to
prevent trouble. He got about twenty
yards from the entrance to the saloon with
his charge when Lambert came running
out with a big pistol in his hand.
While approaching Betbeder and the
barkeeper Lambert fired two shots. When
he caught up to them he seized Betbeder
by the shoulder with his left hand and
holding the pistol in the other hand to the
victim's breast he sent a bullet through
Betbe'ier's heart and another through his
right lung.
Lambert walked quietly back to the sa
loon and remarked:
"I had to kill Lim or he would bave got
me."
He then started for Mendota, where he
surrendered to Constable Adams.
Lambert at present occupies the position
of Road master of the Firebaugh District
and is well connected throughout the
county. He is about 42 years of age and
has always been considered a very quiet
citizen. Betbeder was a Frenchman and 28
years of age. He also was held in high
esteem by the community, being a quiet
and industrious young man.

LOS ANGELES' HOTTEST DAY.
Southern California Residents Broiled by a
Torrid Wave â Upward Flight of
the Mercury.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 25.-The
ever present oldest inhabitant would have
Deen delighted under ordinary circum
stances to descant on the heat of this day
in Los Angeles as compared with the da>s
when he "first came to the country" in
the fifties or "just before de wah," but he
is without the energy to do it. It is the
second day of the heated term and the
May record-breaker, with plenty to spare.
It has been the hottest day in any month
since the Weather Bureau was first estab
lished in this city.
At 5 o'clock this morning the Weather
Bureau man found the thermometer record
ing 75 degrees. Just before noon the mer
cury had crawled to the 102 mark. This
registration was taken away up in the air,
on top of the Wilson building, where the
instruments are unaffected by terrestrial
influences. The difference ranges from
5 to 7 degreesâ that is, it is from 5 to 7
degrees hotter down on the sidewalk than
at the signal station. Some thermometers
registered 109 degrees, others 108 degrees,
and one or two went up to and slightly
above the 110-degree mark.
An exodus for the mountains and sea
may be expected In a few days unless
there is a change for the cooler. At 8
o'clock this evening the thermometer
registered 85 degrees.
SANTA BARBA.RA, Cal., May 25.â A
hot wavt struck Santa Barbara to-day, the
mercury ranging above 90 degrees at 8 a.

Happily the heat is unaccompanied by
wind, and tiiere is nd present indication of
any damage to crops.'
CHICO, Cal., May 25. â A very warm
wave struck this city this morning. At
noon the mercury had ascended to the 95
mark. This being such a sudden change
in the weather, every one is suffering from
the heat. For the past month the mer
cury hore has never been above 75 degrees.

THE SAN JOSE
WILL CONTEST,
A Witness Tells of Strange
Eccentricities of George
H. Parker.
LOVED NOT HIS WIFE.
Nicknamed the Woman "Beauty"
Because She Was Plain
of Feature.
IN FEAR OF BECOMING INSANE
SMrs. Law Says the Decedent Com
plained That He Was Nagged
About His Will.
BAN JOSE, Cal., May 25.â The contest
of the will of George H. Parker, deceased.
â was resumed in Judge Reynolds' court
this morning. The room was filled with
spectators, a large number of whom were
ladies. The contestant, Emma L. Parker,
widow of the deceased's son, was in court
accompanied by several lady friends.
The oDjection made last Thursday by D.
M. Deimas to the admissibility of evidence
to show undue influence exercised in 1-7J
over the decedent as too remote was over
ruled on the ground that contestant's
counsel in tbe opening statement claimed
undue influence had been exercised over
Parker ever since his son's marriage.
The examination of Mrs. Law was re
sumed by Attorney Coogan for the con
testant. She said &he had a conversation
with George Parker prior to his departure
to the East in 1574. He said he was going
to investigate the stories circulated about
his daughter-in-law. He was gone about
three months. When he came back he
said some of the stories he heard about his
eon's wife were not true. He said he had
taken his daughter-in-law out riding. The
witness had been very intimate with
George Parker and his" wife Delia when
they were living in San Francisco, between
the years 1574 and I^3. Continuing she
Baid:
J^B-fter his return from the East in 1-74
G. H. Parker never engaged in any act.ye
pursuit. At that time the Parker family
resided at 1122 Market street. In 1883,
wben I v.as married, they were at that
house. Afterward I lived on Eddy street.
During all tsds time I kept an acquaint
ance with the Parkers. We visited fre
quently. 1 often saw letters in his posses
sion. He would open the letters and read
them. Then he would hand them to his
wife. She would read them, often to me,
and then fold them up and put them away
in a desk. I was living in San Francisco j
in 1888, and the Parkers, I believe, were â¢'
living in San Jose. Once, while be was in
San Francisco, he was sued for alleged
defamation of character."
Mrs. Law testified in regard to what G.
H. Parker had said wl;en he was <=ue<t for
defamation of character. He declared
that his money would all be. taken from
him and that he would have to go to the
poorhouse.
"He said he would rathar commit sui
cide than have hi? home taken away from
him," said tbe witness. "He then went
away to Sunol, in this State, for a while.
After his return from Sunol and prior to
bifl wife's death in April, 1892, he resided j
in San Jose. While he was in San Jose I ;
â aw him occasionally.
â When Delia Parker died I was not at
their home. After her death he said he j
wanted his wife's effects taken out of the j
house, as they annoyed him. People were
taking the things away piece by piece and
he did not know what would become of
them all. He said I could take what l
wanted. He gave her effects to my
Charge. I was at the Vendome when he
Wai stopping there, after his wife's death."
"Did Mr. Parker ever say anyth;ng to
you about being engaged to three women
at the same time?" was asked.
"Is that an evidence of insanity?" asked
Mr. Deimas.
"I tafce it that such a state of affairs, if
it existed, did not indicate very great
soundness of mind," answered Attorney
Cooean.
â¢Well, just go ahead," retorted Mr.
Deimas; "I will not object to the ques
tion."
"Mr. Perker told me that he wu en
gaged to widow named McCracken in Ala
meda," said the witness. "He said he was
going to build a tine home, where he could
Lave a good time, plenty of entertain
ment, beer, lots of young "girls and no old
cranks. He intended, he said, to have the
house brilliantly lighted up every night.
The other lady that he was engaged to
lived in San Jose. He could not decide
â which he would take, and there was still
another one in Chicago that he knew he
could marry. He said he would go on
there first and see her before deciding
about marriage.
"I saw Mr. Parker before he went East,
in 1893. He then said his head troubled
him very much. He seemed afraid he
was going crazy. Reference was made by
him at the time to a report that he had
received that bis son was ill and had gone
to Bermuda. His sisier, Jane, wrote and
Baid tlaere was nothing in the report that
Ed Parker was ill. He said he was going
East and was goincr to take Marshall Pom
eroy with him, as his memory was bad
and he had to have somebody to help him
remember things, as they went from him
as soon as he heard them. I met Jane
Pomeroy in San Francisco when she first
came to California, and afterward we cor
responded together.
" The first letter I received from her was
a week after Mrs. Delia Parker died. The
letters were written by Jane Pomeroy
from Hartford, Conn. In 1893 I went to
Jersey City and from there wrote to Mrs.
Jane Pomeroy and received a response
from her. In consequence of her letter I
went to Hartford and saw Noah and Jane
Pomerov home. There I unexpectedly
found Mr. Parker. He and I visited Delia
Parker's grave. On our return in a car
riage, he said he was going homo as soon
as he could, as he had been nagged about
his wlli. He declared that he was tired of
thia and he wanted to eet somewhere
by himself, where he could do as he
pleased and fix his will to his own liking.
He said he had not been able to fix his
will to his own liking at first. Marshall
Pomeroy was also at Hartford at the time.
"I remained at the home of the Pome
roys that night. They had a spiritualist
circle there that night and a darky named
Joe was the medium. Mr. Parker and Mrs.
Pomeroy told me that tbe colored man
was the medium. He went under control
and pretended to be tbe spirit of G. H.
Parker's mother and also of his wife. On
the afternoon of that day I had a conver
sation with Mr. Parker. He said he had
been to Cottage City and found his son Ed
yerv ill. He wanted me to to to see Ed,
and he wanted me to see his son and his
wife and see what I thought of her. He
â aid sbe seemed ali right to him.
"He once told me, re-umed the wit
ness, "that be had visited Fred Evans, a
slate-writer, at San Francisco. He came
into my house and threw his coat upon
the lounge. He banded me a pair of
slates upon which there was a message.
He asked me to look over the writing and
Bee what I thought of it."
The witness was then banded tbe slates
that bad already been introduced in evi
dence. She was not positive, but she
thought they were the same as Mr. Parker
had nhown her at that time.
"fie asked me," continued the witness,
"to compare some of his wife's writing
with tUat on the slates. I said tbe signa
ture on the slates looked something like
that of Mrs. Parker. He then said he
would go crazy, and went into the bath
room and let the water run on his bare
feet. I took him out of the bathroom for
fear he would take cold. I dried his feet
I and gave him Borne dry socks. Before be
went to bed he called for some whisky. I
; gave him some in a jrla<=s from a bottle
and he said it was a weak dose. After
ward he drank lorae more, and by morn
ing the bottle was pretty weil emptied.
"Sbortlj after bis wife' 3 death, Mr.
Parker said that he wanted what he had
accumulated to go to his own flesh and
bloodâ his son. I once had a talk with
George H. Parker in regard to what my
brother wrote me from the Ea*t regarding
Ed Parker. I told him that I could not
understand why such a feeling against Ed
Parker existed, as my brother told me
tLiat his son and his wife were in good so
ciety in Hartford, and that she was a good
singer and was frequently heard at fine
entertainments. My brother, in his let
ter to me, said he had been at Ed Parker's
house and be had been well impressed
with him and his wife.
"I once told G. H. Parker," said the
witness, "that his wife was good and
economical, and that be ought to furnish
her ail the money and clothing she
needed and let other women alone. He
replied that he did not care anything
about his wife, and that he did not marry
her because he loved her; he married her,
he said, for a housekeeper and companion,
as she would do as well as any one else for
that purpose. He once said he did not
tie up to his wife and would be glad if he
could see her in her coffin. He said he
was very fond of young women.
"After his wife's death he said he was in
distress and he never knew what his '
wife's beauty w.is till he saw her in her |
coffin. He had, he said, during her life- j
time called her Beauty because sne was so ;
homely. The tears came to his eyes when 1
he spoke of his wife's goodness. That
was after her death."
Mr>. Law occupied the stand the entire '
day, and her deafness made the taking of
testimony very difficult and slow. Her !
testimony was not finished, and she will '
resume her story to-morrow morning.

MISSING FROM POCATELLO.
Fears That the Members of a Fishing
Party Have Been Captured by
Bannock Indiana.
POCATELLO, Ipaho, May 25.â Great
anxiety is felt in this city to-mgbt over
the continued absence of a fishing party
of seven employes in the mechanical de
partment of the Union Pacific Railway.
They left on Saturday morning for tbe
bottoms on the Fort Hall reservation, ex
pecting to return on Sunday. It is feared
the treacbero us Bannocks have captured
them, as it is known that these
Indians are biding their time to
avenge the death of their comrades last
summer in Jackson Hole.
An prraed posse icft late last night for
th 6 fishing grounds in search of the miss
ing party, and if it is unsuccessful several
parties will start at daylight. A courier

IRWIN'B FARCE PRESENTED.
Students About to Finish Their Work
Participate in a Final
Celebration.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., May
; 25. â The senior class day programme
.opened this morning with the farce en-
I titled "An Intercollegiate Affair," written
by W. H. Irwin '98. At 10 o'clock the
Encina Gymnasium was fully occupied,
' and tbe clever farce proved a most enjoy
able diversion. It was local in its founda
! tion, and all the situations could be nnder
; stood and appreciated by the audience.
Many "joshes' 1 were got off on those who
have attracted attention by their pecu-
I liarities.
The first act was laid in tbe lobby of
| Encina Hall on a Saturday evening; the
; second in tne laboratory of sporadic mi
crophology on the following Monday after
noon, and the final act in the quadrangle
!on the same evening. The scenery was
excellent and was well arranged.
The plot of tbe play in brief is as follows:
Ned Evans, a Berkeley student, is in love
with a Stanford co-edâ Nell Holton â tbe
daughter of a minister. Evans' reputa
tion is not up to a minister's ideal on the
temperance question, and the father ob
-1 jects violently to his paying any attention
jto NelL Ned wired Latham, his Stanford
friend, that he is coming down 10 Stanford
to fix things up with his sweetheart, and
; by mistake Latham receives another dis
! patch addressed to Dr. Jordan from a
; newly engaged professor in microphology,
; statting that the latter cannot arrive with
, in a week of tbe time at which he is ex
; pected. In the meantime Nell's father
' makes an unexpected visit to Stanford to
; see his daughter, and it begins to look as
| though Ned would be unable to see Neil,
I especially if her pious father knew of his
arrival.
A brilliant thought strikes Latham ; he
insists that his friend Ned shall imper
sonate the expected professor in micro
-1 phology, and as such be is introduced to
the minister, who takes a great liking to
him. The mistakes which Ned makes in
the classroom, notwithstanding the watch
! fulness of Latham, who has been ap-
I pointed his assistant in the laboratory
j and does understand something of micro-
I phology, are ludicroua.
In the meantime, tbe new professor
arrives and Ned is forced to declare him
self, or, rather, does so voluntarily ; and,
as a result, he seems in a fair way to have
his chances ruined on account of his de
ception, when Latham again comes to his
aid and induces tbe old man to consent to
Nea as a son-in-law.
The acting of those who took part was
excellentâ especially H. H. Brown as La
tham and Miss Martin as Nell. Baldwin
played his part well; in fact, no fauit could
possibly be found with the characters in
any particular. Following was the cast:

In the afternoon the senior class met in
the quadrangle for the annual clasÂ» exer
cises. Last year the "Pioneer" class es
tablished the precedent of dedicating r,
brass plate, which was affixed to the '95
tree. This year's graduates determined to
outdo their predecessors and obtained the
permission of the university authorities to
take up one of the concrete blocks in the
corridor of the quadrangle at the entrance
of the Stanford Chapel that is to be and
substitute for it a brass block, with the
class figures, '96, molded therein. It is the
intention to take up one of the concrete
blocks each year ana allow tbe students of
the Graduating class to follow the prece
dent established by '96.
A very unique programme bad been pre
pared. President R. L. Wilbur o! the class
opened the exercises in a short speech,
stating the expectations of tbe class in
originating such a precedent and tbe right
of the class to enjoy distinction as such
originator.
The "Class History," written by Miss
Grace E. Clark, was read by John Gregory.
It contained a brief review of the achieve
ments of tbe class in university affairs;
\hÂ» record, on tne track, in football, base
ball and kindred sports; the memorable
accomplishments of certain cf its mem
bers; the work of ' 96 classmen on the col
lege papers and in intercollegiate debates,
and from these records asked the audience
to judge of the graduating class.
Professor Earl Barnes addressed the
class. He characterized ti;e graduation of
student* a? tLe greatest examination in a
student's life and one too often not appre
ciated or understood.
"The greatest good that can come to us
from our four years' association here,"
said Professor Barnes, "is self-understand
ingâa rational self-consciousness, tem
pered and sweetened with faith and hope.
Self-knowledge is the first requisite to sane
living."
Professor Earl Barnes exhorted tbe
graduates to remember that the only safe
shelter under which a man or woman
could rest in law was recognition of tbe
never-changing will of the Omnipotent
Ruler of the universe, for the discovery ana
furtherance of which tne Stanford Univer
sity was founded and maintained. Pro
feesor Barnes then illustrated the neces
sity of having one's real companions â the
invisible intimates cf tne soul â shown
from the study of the world's neroes or
their work in t c spirit of art and liter
ature. Unless the student showed a fair
degree of proficiency in power to love he
was unworthy of graduation, for it was
that which gave the right to man to lead
men.
"Love is a finer sort of understanding;
it makes possible tbe appreciation of all
that is elevating and inspiring," he said.
The class song written by J. A. Tucker
to the tune of "Vive la Campagnie" was
sung at the conclusion of Professor
Barnes' address, and Mr. Tucker read the
"Last Will and Testament" of the class,
in which, with all legal form and cere
mony, they bequeathed to under-classes
or under-cfassmen all the things on which
"joshes" have been got off to a point
a<J nauseam. The will was very humorous
and elicited great applause.
H. H. Brown unveiled the plate and de
livered the finest address of the afternoon. '
W. H. Invln
of Stanford University, '98.
"In a few short hours we go out into the
world to line up with our predecessors, to
begin our career as alumni. Whether we
prove worthy members, whether we suc
ceed or fail, depends largely upon what
we have or have not done in college," said
he.
The speaker compared the student to
the tree which grew as it was inclined
while still a twig. A comparison was
drawn between tbe inducements at older
institutions and at Stanford, "where
everything is new, unique and wholesome
and a new die is brought to bear on
student life and a new type goes forth."
The speaker did not believe that if a grad
uate left with the Stanford impression and
filled with the Stanford sentiment he
would fail. He continued:
"Tbe '96 plate to the donors marts a be
ginning and an ending. College days are
over, and '96 must pitch into tbe rough
and tumble of life. But in a sense it will
be history repeating itself. The period
icity of college life will recur to mark the
stages of after life. To-morrow we will be
freshmen again. U'e =hall be looked upon
as uncouth, untried. We shall be laughed
at and imposed upon ; be rebuffed and dis
appointed. We shall pass again through
tne sophomore, the junior and tbe senior
periods to the conclusion of full, eventful
and intense lives."
The speaker described the expectation of
the '96 class in laying their first Btone, and
when tbe event had recurred for ninety
successive years tbe last of '96 classmen
would have passed away.
"As years go by this line of class blocks
will have swept down the arcade: genera
tions will have come and gone, for a cen
tury is a short apace in the life of an insti
tution. But wben all memory of the
origination of this custom has passed into
oblivion, 'f'G will still remain embedded in
the rock."
Dr. Jordan in a neat talk accepted the
gift, and the exercises of the afternoon
closed with the college anthem.

Judge Ross of Los Angeles Decides a
Case Relating to Grants
and Patents.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 25.â Judge
Ross of the United States Circuit Court
this morning filed an opinion of great im
portance, affecting the water privilege fo
R. L. Wilbur, President of the Gradu
ating Class at Stanford.
about 60,000 acres of as fine land as South
ern California possesses. The case is that
of the Irvine Company vs. John S. Bond
et al., wherein the court overruled the
plea of the defendants, with leave to
answer. It is a suit in equity brought by
tbe complainant, a corporation organized
under the laws of West Virginia, aeainst
a large number of citizens of California to
procure a decree qnieting the complain
ant's right of way to the waters of Santi
ago Creek in Orange County, and an in
junction enjoining the defendants from
interfering with the waters or its dams,
flumes and ditches.
The complainant based its right upon
its alleged ownership of the- rancho Lomas
de Santiago in Orange County, containing
48,000 acres ot land, and an adjoining tract
of 12,000 acres of the ranch Santiago de
Santa Ana, through which latter tract the
Santiago Creek runs in its natural chan
nel, and riparian to which, it is averred,
are all the lands owned by the com
plainant
The Judge said that tbe allegation that
Irvine fled from Orange County to avoid
service in an action brought in the Orange
County Superior Court, and remained in
hiding until after he had executed the
deed in question, is not trne. In view of
the testimony he holds that he would not
be justified in deciding that the convey
ance made by James Irvine to the com
plainant company was fictitious and not
real.
Judge Ross also filed an opinion to-day
in the case of the United Slates vs. tbe
Southern Pacific Railroad Company and
E. M. Wright. This is a case in which
certain lands were patented by the United
States to the raiiroad and were also
claimed by the State as school land.
Wright had a deed from the railroad and
also a patent from the State of California.
The court held that the land did not pass
under the railroad grant, nor by reason of
the fact that the State had selected tne
land as school land; and further that the
land was not granted to the State for tbe
reason that the State's selection had not
been approved by the Department of the
Interior.
The court therefore entered a decree in
favor of the Government against the title
held under the railroad and that held un
der the State,
THE POENTE MURDER.
PoHtmattrr Hayes' Life Had Keen Threat-
ened by thn Mings Brother*.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., May 25.â The case
of the People vs. George and B. W.
Mings, brothers, charged with the murder
of Postmaster John Hayes at Pnente on
April 9, was called this morning. One
affidavit was by Detective Burns, who
stated that only a few days ago he ob
tained information that made a man
named Clark a material witness, and if
time could be gained he would be able to
produce Clark.
The prosecution expects to show by
Clark that a lew days before John Hayes
was shot in his store by niasKed men
Clark had a talk with George Mings.
Clark asked Mings how ho was getting
along and the latter replied, "Very bad."
Mings said money was scarce, but that if
he could get into Tom Hayes' safe things
would be much better.
Judge Smith granted a continuance un
til to-morrow.
It is claimed that a mortgage for $2000
was held by Hayes against George Mings,
which was past due, and for which a new
note was made by Mings. The theory of
the prosecution is that this mortgage fur
nished the motive for the murder.
They say that a short time before the
murder Hayes lost the note, while the
mortgage was in his safe. The note was
found by a man who took it to Mings and
tried to sell it to him. He said it was of
no consequence unless he had the mort
gage. Tne prosecution claims that the
Mings boys did not know that the posses
sion of the mortgaee, which had been re
corded, would do them no good, but be
lieved that by securing that document and
the note they would be able to wipe out
the debt.

CONVERTING SANTA ROSA.
The Equal Suffrage Leaders Open the
Campaign in Sonoma
County.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., May 25.â The
Woman's Suffrage mass-xeeting opened
here this afternoon at 3 o'clock in tbe M.
E. church. The meetings will continne
to-morrow afternoon and evening. The
women in charge are MisÃ Harriet May
Mills of New York and iliss Elizabeth U.
Yates of Maine, vrlio will be re-enforced
to-morrow by the Rev. Anna Shaw.
The afternoon meeting was opened with
an eloquent prayer by Rev. E. B. Ware.
After a short musical programme the Rev.
Mr. Ware delivered an address of wel
come. He said that he greatly enjoyed
the privilege of extending a welcome to
the first Women's Congress of Sonoma
County. Amons the many striking things
of this address of welcome was the speak
er's mention of the fact that his daughter
would graduate next November from one
of the ladies' seminaries of this State; that
employed at the seminary was a Chinese
cook, who, by reason of being born in Cali
fornia, would be a voter in November; but
the score or more ot bright young women
who would graduate that month, with all
the learning and accomplishments of
modern schooling, hotv about them?
Would the voters of California declare at
the polls next November that t!ie China
man was more entitled to suffrage than
those briliiant and accomplished young
American women?
"No," said the speaker, "there is too
much intelligence in California for tnat."
The witty divine compared the suf
frage movement to a train of cars, with An
thony and Shaw as conductors apd Yates
and Mills for tbe other train officials. The '
train traveled northward to Sacramento
and took aboard the G. O. P., he said,
and every Republican there was fur
nished with a reclining-chair. The next '
party procuring through tickets was the j
Populists. Then, steaming down to Stock- j
ton, the Prohibitionists cot safely on {
board, and, he declared, the Democrats ;
better be on time or they would get left-
Miss Mills addressed the convention
briefly. She said they were not new
women, and they presented no new ques
tions, but a contention which men had
died for in ail ages. Piato advocated
equality of the sexes and Abagail Adams j
pleaded for equal suffrage at the forma- j
tion of our constitution.
In speaking o! the press, Miss Mills said
that most papers were treating the move
ment fairly and the fact that one great
daily, living up to its motto and "speaking
for all" as the ban Francisco Call did in
its avowed championship of the suffrage
movement, was a mighty stride in the di
rection of equality.
A paper by Mrs. Dr. Thompson entitled,
"Do Wives and Mothers Need the Ballot?"
was a feature of the meeting and evoked
continued applause.
Many prominent men attended the even
ing session. Tne proceedings were opened
by the Rev. Mr. Hay den offering a prayer,
which was followed by R. W. Miller E"sq.,
in a etirring addn>s?.* Miss Hahman of
.Santa Rosa and Miss Alice Yates of San
Francisco sang and Mi.<s Van Davis of
Ohio delivered a recitation. Then followed
the principal event of the evening, tbe ad
dress of Miss Elizabeth Yates. Her talk
abounded in anecdotes and happy allu
sions, but at times her eloquent voice rang
with earnest indignation, when speaking
of the unjust laws of different States. She
spoke ot the laws excluding women from
a voice in her own Government, from the
Magna Charta to the eleventh amendment
to the constitution of California, and gave
many facts and figures concerning the op
eration of woman's suffrage laws in other
States.

SAN JOSE, Cal., May 25.â Judge Rey

Ac half-past 7 the guests took their seats
at the board, where an elaborate menu was
served*
The toasts to the Queen, the President
of the United States, the Prince of Wales
and the royal family were drunk standing
by all present. The toast "California"
proposed by W. Doxey, president of the
benevolent society, was enthusiastically
received ''California is a young coun
try, said Mr. Doxey in his remarks, "but
in many respects it stands without a peer
in the whole world. The â¢ beautiful gran
deur of the scenery of the country lying
within half a day's journey of San Fran
cisco is to my mind unsurpassed by any.
thing elsewhere.
"In the grand natural beauty of Mount
ramalpais. of Napa Valley, of the Sierras,
of Yosemite and Lake i'ahoe there is a
sousce of perpetual pleasure. Although
young, California has already made a
mark in science of which any country
might be proud. And the glorious tri
umpn she â * has achieved within the
past fortnight in the construction of a
|reat ship, such as not all the East or
burope can match, makes me feel it a mat
ter to be proud of to be even an adopted
citizen of such a State." â¢ â¢

Four Out of Six of the Favorites
Beaten at the Track Yes
terday.
CHAKTRETJSE II IN QEEAT FORM
Coady on Thornhill Tcok a Most Op
portune Nap and Jack Richelieu
Beat Him Out.
The warm weather worked no material
change for the better in the performances
of the first choices in the betting at the
track. On the contrary the outsiders,
who have more than been holding their
own of late, appear to have been benefited
to a still greater degree by the rise of the
mercury. The joints of four out of fire of
the favorites were as stiff as ever. Specu
lation for the first day of the week was
ripe; the crowd, which was of very fair
proportions, j?rew warm, hot and "sore"
at different stages, and after accounts had
been rounded up at the close of the day,
the bookie was just a little winner.
The seven-furlong handicap called out
the best field of the day. Chartreuse II
was backed down irom 2)4 to an 11 to 5
choice, and, in front most of the way, won
galloping by three lengths in 1:27. A
strong tip was out on Thelma, causing her
odds to tumble from 5 to 3, and although
finishing in the place was never able to
press the winner.
Articus, who seems to be regaining his
old form, scored again in the openine race,
a six furlong selling affair with a field ot
ten starting. Allowed to reach the false
price of 12 to 1, he was played down at the
last moment to 6. Off in front he led for a
way, when he fell back in the bunch, but
came through in the stretch and won
handily at the wire, a length before Elmer
F, who with Coda and Mollie E. was one of
the short ones in the betting.
Alter having the second event, a mile
selling dash, won, Thornhill was nipped
out by the 20 to 1 shot Jack Richelieu. The
bald-faced colt, who went to the post a
slight favorite over Long Lady, drew away
from the latter mare when squared away
for home, and to all appearances had the
race well in hand. When opposite the
paddock Coady grew careless, and Jack
KiChelieu, coming with a rush, beat him
out a short nose in a driving finish. Her
manita finished a good third.
BookmaKer Humphrey's mare Hearts
ease had a slight call in the betting on the
next race at rive and a half furlongs, but
ran unplaced. Moiven, the 3H to 1 sec
ond choice, shook off his field in the
stretch and won very easily, with Ricardo
in the place, three parts of a length before
Mount Roy.
The handsome mare Marjorie opened an
even-money chance for the five and a half
furlong dash that followed the handicap,
but a report being circulated that she was
lame sent her odds back to 2% to 1. There
was then a stiff play on her, and at post
time 7to 5 was the best obtainable. She
passed Durango, who cut out the running
to the stretch, and at the finish won easily
by four lengths. Rey Alta came strong at
the end, taking the place from O'Fleeta by
a head.
The old strawberry sprinter, Tim
Murphy, the 4 to 5 favorite for the final
six-furlong sprint, was unfortunate in
getting away from the post poorly, to
which fact can probably be attributed his
detest. Veragua, an outsider, got away in
the lead and showed the wav to the
Etretcn, when Rebellion, getting" through
next the rail, gradually forged to the front
and, ridden out, was a length in advance
of the outsider at the wire. The favorite
blade a line run from the far rear, being
beaten lor the place but a neck.
TEACZ AHD PADDOCK ITEMS.
The entries for the closing day's races
will close at 9 a. m. to-day, and no horse
will be allowed to be scratched after 10
o'clock.
George J. Common, the well-known
auction poolseller, left for Denver, Colo.,
last evening. Mr. Common will sell pools
in Denver on the Overland Park events,
when he will leave for Montana, and his
silvery voice will be heard over the North
ern circuit.
Judging from the time, 1:43, for the
mile race purloined by Jack Richelien,
'twas indeed a "Midsummer's Night
Dream" that Coady toot on the back of
the favorite. Thornhill. After a time peo
ple will begin to think that there really
was some cause fox the judges' suspension
ot Coady for that highly perfumed riae ne
made on Cabrillo some weeks at;o.
Walt Vivell, the careful handler of Phil
Archibald's string, appears to have that
turfman's horses in great shape just at
present. Articus and Charles A have
landed the coin at long odds.
The following is the programme of
events for the closing day of the Bay Dis
trict: Six-furlong selling dash; one-mile

AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Movem enti of Professionalsâ San Jose
Road Club Oinbaiule \
There has been considerable speculation
as to what California riders would follow
the National circuit, and not until ye&ter
day was it generally known who they
would be. Ziegler is now in the East, and
C. 8. Wells and W. A. Terrill of the Bay
City Wheelmen, F. A. McFarland of San
Jose, C. R. Coulter, Olympic Club Wheel
men, together with Winsett, Parker,
Schefski. the Eastern riders. W. J. Stack
pole, their trainer, and F. Ed Spoouer,
correspondent, went south last night to
Los Angeles, and after riding there on May
30 the men will go directly East. H, E.
Mcfrea, whose home is in Los Angeles,
went with them, but will return shortly.
W. W. Uatton and W. J. Evans, R. E.
Dow and O. L. Pickard will co to San Jose
to try for some paced records. Wilbur J.
Edwards of San JoSe will undoubtedly fol
low the National circuit, but does not in
lend to go for two or three weeks, as he is
out of condition. It is hardly likely that
he will race here in the meantime, how
ever. Foster, Jones. John E. Edwards.
Harry Terrill, Oscar Osen and some other
fast local professionals will remain on the
coast., and as there will be constant addi
tions to the class from the fastest of the
amateurs, the absence of the others will
scarcely be noticed.
Oscar Osen suffered a severe fall at
Souther Farm, near San Leandro. Sunday,
in some races which were got up for the
fun of the thing by a party of Olympics,
Garden Citys and BAy Citys, who were
picnicking there on a joint rim. It will be
a week or more before he will be about
again.
PJntries for the Alpha Oadie.s') Cycling
Club race meet at Central Park next Sat
urday will close at the park to-day. The
events will be a one-mile scratch, one-mile
handicap and a one-mile consolation, in
the amateur class, and a half mile
scratch and a one-mile handicap profes- j
sional. The prize list is valuable and all
the fast local men will compete.
after c a b l P fp J Â°f Se , Road Club has disbanded
alter a life Â» of four years. It has been
Sf, un ,! ortu na c in the giving of race
meets, theatricals, etc., and lost heavily
on all such ventures. Of the club's crack
riders Ziegler has joined the Garden Citvs,
wii f fr a iTM th . c Oly t. m icB ' and the others
â¢ pr<^, ably ]Â° ln the home club.
â The Olympic Club Wheelmen will hold
a meeting this evening. The OvcJe Eoard
â¢I*.? c committee on good roads will be
present nd address the meeting.
inÂ£ b fu ty Â£ clin g Club will probably
join with the Californias shortly, making
the latter a very strong organization.
CRONIN'S BABY GIRL.
She OiÂ«. a While Her Father la in Prison
on a Charge of Disturbing
the Peace.
A pathetic incident occurred at the City
Prison on Sunday afternoon. James Cro
nin, a hardworking teamster living at 936
Harrison street, was arrested late Satur
day night by Policemen O'Keefe and
Lynch for disturbing the peace, He was
taken to the Southern station, and being
unable to procure bail was locked up for
the night. Yesterday morning he was re
moved with other prisoners to the City
Prison.
Yesterday afternoon a friend called at
the prison to see him and conveyed the
sad news that his baby girl had died during
the night and his wife was prostrated.
Cronin broke down and begged his friend
to get him out of prison. His friend hur
ried, to Judge Conlan's residence and told
the Judge the facts. He immediately
drove down to the prison and released Cro
nin on his own recognizance.
Cronin had only left the prison a few
minutes when a pretty little tot made her
appearance and asked if her papa was
there. She said his name was James Cro
nin and her baby sister had died and she
wanted to see her papa. When told that
he had gone home she toddled away as
fist as her little legs could carry her.

THE SAN FtfAyCISCO CAIiIi, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
AT THE CITY THEATERS,
Ada Rehan Appears as Helena in
" A Midsummer Night's
Dream."
" Metamora," After Many Yearsâ New
Bill at Orpheum â Columbia and
Tivoli the Same.
In spite of (he heat there was almost a
full house at the Baldwin last night to see
the Daly Company produce "A Midsum
mer Night's Dream." It was when peo
ple were once packed away in the theater
that they realized how very hot it was,
and though the thermometer was not
quite high enough to kill enjoyment the
l state of the weather had no doubt a good
j deal to do with the languid nature of the
applause.
The Shakespearean fairy comedy was
given a graceful interpretation, pretty to
the eye and not nnpleasing to the ear, but
it cannot be said that the work showed
the Daly Company at its strongest. There
was too little of Ada Rehan and too much
of the fairies, sprites, etc., who flitted
about gracefully in a dim, religious light,
which, however," waÃ not dim enough to
hide the faot that not one of them was
able to dance, and an ideal impersonation
of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" de
mands good dancing.
The woodland scene was a very charm
ing bit of stage paintine, the colored lights
were skillfully manipulated, the dresses of
the fairies were beautiful and it was a
clever inspiration to furnish them with
tiny electric sparks, suggestive of fireflies,
but all these attractions would not quite
beguile one into forgettine that the mor
tals acted a good deal better than tne
fairies, that Miss Maud Winter's Titania
was partially inaudible and had no
tepsicorean ability, and that the music was
mediocre with the exceDtion of a pretty
rendering by the chorus of "I Know a
BanK."
Apart from the spectacular attractions
Ada Reban as Helena and James Lewis as
Bottom the Weaver were the most note
worthy features of the performance.
Rehari looked very handsome in her
Greek dress, and made her long speeches
charmingly.
James Lewis fairly reveled in the role of
the actor- weaver, who, like a Rood many
other amateurs, wants to take all the parts
in the play. The other Athenian players
were well impersonated by Edwin Stevens,
Herbert Gresuam, Sidney Herbert, Wil
liam Sampson and Robert Shepherd. Miss
May Young was good as Puck and the rest
of the cast was satisfactory.
At the Orpheum,
The Orpheum has a drawing card this
week in Papinta, who is described as
"queen of the myriad dance." - A myriad
is a little stretch of the imagination, but
Papinta dances before mirrors arranged in
such a way that she is multiplied ad in
iinituia. From the center of the house she
gives the effect of a full corps de ballet,
while from the sides vistas of Papintas are
seen to extend into , the distance in a way
that reminds one of the mirror maze on
the old Midway.
Papinta's methods are a good deal those
of Loie Fuller. She dances with her
hands even more than with her heels, for
much of her art consists in the skillful
manipulation of draperies, and she is ac
companied by a corps of electricians who
exhaust their skill in making her look
successively like a rainbow, a butterfly
and a mass of living flame.
In the first dance Papinta wears a
black dress and bonnet and pirouetes
about in a rainbow more gorgeous than
any of nature's own making. In her fire
dance she seems to be enveloped in a mass
of flame, and imaginative beholders al
most believed that her draperies are really
on fire. The last evolution of Papinla is
into a swirling mass of draperies that look
like butterflies' wings, and when the one
lone little woman finally appears, bowing
before the curtain, "clad in robes of virgin
white," it requires a stretch of the imagina
tion to believe that it was she alone who a
moment before was doing the whole ballet
act enveloped in all thÂ«j colors of the
rainbow.
Of the other new performers McAvoy
and May endeared themselves exceedingly
to the gallery by their zeal and noise.
They shouted and stamped until they al
most melted and when they danced made
I more noise than a box factory. Extreme
exhaustion finally compelled them to
cease giving encores. Lizzie B. Raymond
is a good-looking young serio-comic who
is billed as America's popular vocalist,
etc., though her speech betrays her as
coming irom the banks of the Thames.
She has not very much voice but knows
her business and won encore after encore.
The house was quite touched by her sing
ing of "My Mother Was a Lady."
Golden, Chalfont and Golden, singers,
comedians, whistlers and yodlers proved
to be clever and entertaining and some of
the most popular of last week's performers
are held over. Altogether the bill is an
exceptionally good one.
The Grand Opera-Honse.
Not since Forrest produced it here twenty
three years ago was "Metamora" played in this
City until it was again staged lost night at the
Grand Opera-house, with Edmund Collier in
the role of the great Wampanoag chief. Col
lier, by tne way, wears the same buckskin suit
that Forrest wore for the chieftain's part. He
bought it from Forrest when he secured the
right to the play itself, and with the historical
suit he obtained a -weapon yet more historical,
the original scalpinfj-knifo of "Black Hawk,"
the Seminole chief, who presented the trophy
to Forrest.
The play, like our own California "Ramon*,"
makes the aboriginal a nobler stamp of man
and one more apt than we are wont to believe
the noble red man is in appearing as a
romantic character. Yet Collier takes the
part well and gives it life and interest with
out degenerating into the tragically awful.
Miss Lisle Leigh as Oceana, the daughter of
Mordaunt, assumes her role with a graceful
semblance to what might have been amoug
the Indians before the pale-faced brother
spoiled their poetic ways.
The other characters whose acting is deserv
ing of mention are Julia Blanc as Isahwaskee,
the wife of Metamora, and Fred J. Butler, E.
J. Holden and Eugene Moore, three English
settlers, between whom and the Indians war
and peace form the incidents of the plot. The
costumes are new and effective, as is also the
ncenery and the properties. The play is on for
this week.
At the Columbia.
During the pleasant nights with their temp
tation to car rides before and after the theater
and their accompaniment of a desire for some
j thing light, something trival, but withal a lit
-1 tie amusing, there is nothing on the boards
; just at present more appropriate for such a
i le-rling than "Miss Harum Scaruia," now in
i its second week at the Columbia. There have
j been better plays of its kind, but when a not
too critical audience wishes to be entertained
without being subjected to a mazy plot this
piece may cater to that.desire.
At the Tivoli.
As long as "Robinson Crusoe" and "Uncle
Tom's Cabin" are read just so long will the
human interest that attaches to these stories
continue deservedly to be a feature of common
amusement. "Uncle Tom's Cabin" began its
second week last night at the Tivoli and even
though the cast is in no respects exceptional a
fairly good audience was present to witness
what has proved to be the most long-lived play
yet founded on strictly American incidents.

TESTIMONIAL. \i;^l
The Edw. W. Joy Companyâ Gentlemen :
I am sure I do no wrong to my friends and
the general public in telling them what a
grand, good remedy Joy's Vegetable Sar-
saparilla is, because Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla has done me so much good.
This remedy was highly recommended
to me by one who used it, and I can now
highly recommend it as I have used it.

THL CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
The third term no longer confronts us
either as a condition or a theory.
Platt's expression of his attitude never
comes in the form of a platitude.
The Democratic Presidential bandwagon
continues to work like a durn peart.
It seems impossible to raise the wind in
Kansas without raiding the devil with it.
Ten chances to one the Czar's corona
tion manifesto will evade the silver ques
tion.
it is better to make sure of the home
market than to dy to others we know
not of.
Don't tain of dodge planks until you see
what the Chicago convention says about
the tariff.
This is Â»s good a week as any to join a
Republican club and make ready for the
campaign.
When we had a Republican tariff we did
not have to issue bonds to keep up the
gold reserve.
The goldbugs of the East are violating
all the conventions of politics in trying to
control all of them.
It wouldn't surprise anybody to learn
that Moscow has begun to think herself as
big a town as St. Louis.
Cleveland would hardly call back a Con
gress that has a bond-deal investigating
committee ready for action.
Men may make fun ot straddlers all
they please, but it is generally better to
straddle a ditch than to fall in it.
Cleveland is not a very big man, but as
long as he sits on the safety valve of the
National machine he is dangerous.
To-day tbe Czar will crown himself. All
the pomp and parade of Jast week was
done merely for advertising purposes.
Every man who resists the petty tyranny
of the transfer system fignts the battle of
the people and becomes a popular hero.
Some men are so faulty in their makeup
that when they wish to get even with the
world they resort to odd ways of doing it.
Make up your mind now that you -will
attend the memorial services on Decora
tion day and have a picnic some other
day.
The Republican candidate for the Presi
dency will stand on a platform made by
the party and not on one made by him
self.
Germany is to increase her military
force in South Africa, and the chances of a
ruction with the natives will increase
with it.
The gold Democrats of Chicago who are
talking of regenerating their party are
not to be blamed for thinking it needs the
gold cure.
Now that Alaska has had a convention
riot we may expect her to be putting in a
claim for statehood on the plea that she
is ripe for ft,
Although all the delegates to the St..
Louis convention were elected long ago
the first-ballot prophets are as much in
the woods as ever.
There seems to be something of a fatal
ity in every kind of fad. A young man
has just been murdered because ho had
12000 worth of rare stamps.
A few months ago Cleveland hoped a
nomination for another term, but he
would be well satisfied now if he were sure
of getting his party to indorse the present
one.
The silver Democrats are electing abont
all the delegates to the Chicago conven
tion, but up to date the gold men have
furnished all tbe leading candidates for
the Presidency. i
The Democrats in the Senate joined with
the Populists to defeat the revenue bill
passed by the Republicans of tne House,
and now they are howling that Congress
has done nothing.
Before this generation passes away one
of the vital questions of politics will be
whether government by Supreme Courts
is tbe best possible way of maintaining
republican institutions.
A celebration of the hoisting of the bear
flag will make a good prelude to the cele
bration of the hoisting of Old Giory, and
the Native Sons will find plenty of people
ready to help them whoop it up.
Tie greatest criminal of the age is a
most irrepressible and Ã¼biquitous rascal.
We have hardly had time to bury him un

It seems fairly certain we can have the

â¢we raise a fund of |25,000 to guarantee the
expenses, and iv comparison with the
benefits to be derived the amoiint is so
small there should be little difficulty in
raiting it in a short time.
A GOOD SOLUTION.
The ordinance passed to print by the
Supervisors dealing with tne transfer
check system of the Market-street Rail
way Company offers a satisfactory settle
ment of a controversy which for already
too long a time has disturbed the commu
nity and led occasionally to serious diffi
culties between passengers and officials of
the road.
The ordinance provides for the establish
ment of a transfer system that will give to
the people those facilities of streetcar
travel which are essential to public conve
nience. It does away with that highly
objectionable check system which has
been such a nuisance for weeks past.
This is nothing more than what the
people have a right to expect of the com
pany and what the Supervisors should in
justice ordain. At the same time the ordi
nance provides a means by which the in
terests of the company are protected from
the acts of thoughtless or dishonest people
who may have used transfers not for their
convenience in streetcar travel but to de
prive the company of a portion of its
rightful revenues.
The ordinance is so fair in its terms that
it was unanimously supported by the Su
pervisors and ought to be retarded with
equal favor by both the public and the
railway company. Tne controversy has
been a most irritating one on both sides,
and it is certainly for the general good that
it should be ended as speedily as possible.
The better class of people in San Fran
cisco have never had any desire to cinch
the company or to deal unjustly with it.
The proposed ordinance comes as a good
solution for the whole problem involved
in this conflict, and if it is accepted in the
right spirit by the public and the com
pany the controversy wiil be satisfactorily
settled and the incident closed,
ALREADY PROVIDED FOR.
On June 2 a convention of commercial,
manufacturing, labor and agricultural
organizations will be held in Detroit,
Mich., to consider how best tbe tariff
question can be relieved of the handicap
of partisan politics and made a matter of
public concern independent of political
parties â in other words, to Americanize it
as a purely business proposition. The call
fora convention assumes as a fact that
every business interest of this country
needs protective legislation in some meas
ure, but to arrive at a true basis tbe ques
tion will have to be freed from party
politics and treated as an economic
problem.
Enough is known of what is expected to
be accomplished to warrant the belief that
the convention will hold that protection
is essential to the United States, and that
free trade on the one hand, and laws
that prohibit foreign competition in any.
event on the other, are not only
diametrically opposed to the funda
mental principles of the Government,
but that the one is as hurtful to
the country as the other, and therefore
both should be battled against as enemies
of the public good. Thus it will be seen
that it is the purpose to have the conven
tion composed of conservative and expe
rienced merchants, manufacturers, agri
culturists and wage-earners, who care
more for the material growth of the coun
try than for the supremacy of any one of
the political parties.
It has already been intimated that the
convention will lay down the principle that
there should be a tariff high enough to
equalize the difference in cost of produc
tion in this and in toreign countries, first
for the purpose of protecting our industrial
class against the lower wage schedules of
other countries, and second for the pur
pose of giving our manufacturers no op
portunity to exact extortionate prices
from our people for their goods and wares.
But what is the use of holding such a
convention? The basic principles of the
Republican party stand for exactly the
kind of protection this convention pro
poses to demand. The very first economic
legislation iv tbe direction of a law for the
encouragement and protection of American
industries was enacted by a Republican
Congress more than a century ago, and
the Nation never departed from the doc
trine of adequate protection to our in
dustrial plants and to secure our wage
earners against the pauper-labor of Eu
rope until a Democratic administration
came into power in 1893. The nomi
nee of the St. Louis convention
will reiterate the party's determination to
protect our industries and our people
against foreign invasion, and the next ad
ministration will put in effect the declara
tion of the party. Let the Detroit conven
tion resolve to stand by the Republican
party and it will ttet all that it is seekiug.
AN EXTRA SESSION.
It is reported from Washington that if
Congress adjourns without passing a reve
nue bill or a bill authorizing the issue of
low interest-bearing certificates to meet
the deficiency in the National income,
President Cleveland will call an extra ses
sion to meet some time in July. While no
authority is giveu for the accuracy of the
report it deserves some credit, since in a de
bate in the Senate last week Senator Sher
man very pointedly intimated that some
such course might be taken by Cleveland
under the conditions stated.
As it seems certain tbat no revenue bill
can be agreed upon by the Senators at this
session, and as the vote last week on Gor
man's motion for an issue of treasury cer
tificates shows that plan to be utterly out
of ;he question, the people may as well
begin to consider an extra session as one
of the possibilities of politics. There can
be no doubt that it would be unpopular,
ana there can be as little that every effort
would be made by the administration and
by Democratic organs to throw the re
sponsibility of it upon the Republican
leaders of the House and Senate.
Under these circumstances it is worth
repeating what is known to every man
who has followed the proceedings of this
Congress that the failure to enact a reve
nue bill has been due to the Democrats
themselves. The Republicans of the
House passed early in tne session a tariff
bill designed to meet the needs of the
treasury under existing conditions. It
was in no sense a partisan bill. It was of
fered as a compromise to Democrats in
order to help out a Democratic adminis
tration and provide the Nation with a rev
enue sufficient for the time until the re
turn of the Republican party to power.
The bill offered in this spirit of party fair
ness and genuine patriotism was reje3ted
by the Democrats. Had half o dozen
Democratic Senators voted for it it could
have been enacted, ample revenues would
have been pro vided and there wcuid now
be no need of an extra session.
The position of the Democrats in Con
gress on this iesue is so bad that if Cleve
land cared anything for them we would
be sure be would never think of calling an
extra session. It seems evident, however,
that Cleveland now cares very little for his
party since his rule has been repudiated
by so many of its leaders and State con
ventions. Tne call for an extra session
would enable him to make a "grand-stand
play" to tbedelig.it of the gold standard
forces of the East, and, therefore, there
are serious reason* ior believing that ixe
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
may venture upon it, no matter bow un
popular it would be nor bow disastrous to
the party tbat elected bim President.
NEEDLESS WORRY.
A good many people are needlessly wor
rying themselves over tbe position of the
several avowed candidates for tbe St.
Louis nomination on the money question.
As a matter of fact it is a matter of minor
consequence how they stand on that or any
other question. If tbe right were reserved
to the nominee to make his own views
the principles of the party it would be
very different, but no such right exists,
nor could such a right be conferred upon
any one. The party makes the platform
upon the basis of the most harmonious
adjustment possible of conflicting sec
tional interests, and the party presumes
that no honorable man would accept the
nomination unless he were in full sympa
thy with both the spirit and letter of such
platform.
The St. Louis convention will be com
posed of representative Republicans from
every community of the country, and
when a platform is adopted it will be
found to be so broad, so clear and so com
prehensive that no one, from the humblest
voter to the party's candidate, could pos
sibly misunderstand its meaning and pur
pose. Hence it follows that it is the platform
and not the candidates which the rank
and file more especially should be inter
ested in just at this time. The Cleveland
administration has so run counter to the
general good of the country that much re
pairing of the avenues of the coming and
going of commerce will be required at the
bands of tbe next administration, which
will be Republican without doubt, and
more than usual interest is centered in
the work of formulating ways and adopt
ing means to accomplish that end.
The Republican party is not a hero wor
shiper, nor does it withhold tne conferring
of nonors won in battles for tbe better
ment of the country, but it holds that cor
rect economic principles are always para
mount; that tbe sincere Republican should
quickly put himself in accord with the dec
larations of his party, as promulgated by
it in convention, and that no one has the
right to assume leadership except upon
invitation, and then only to carry out tbe
plans and secure the aims of the party.
There never is a scarcity of true, capable
and willing bearto and hands in the Re
publican party, ana it will make a fatal
mistake if it departs from tbe doctrine
that it is a party of principles and in no
sense a party for the promotion of indivi
dual aspirations for political preferment.
STALE AND THREADEARE.
To maintain "parity" between gold and
silver has become a stale, threadbare and
unprofitable bit of political lying where
with to feed the credulous. How can
the parity of the metals be maintained
so long as the Gove r nment requires noth
ing to be payable to it in gold and will
Day nothing to its creditors but gold? The
people are tired of these misleading efforts
to hold out uold as the Nation's money of
redemption. Tbe fact is, by the ruling of
the Treasury Department it has no way to
get gold except by buying it with bonds.
What matters it how high taxes and reve
nue duties are if the Government will not
pay its debts with the silver and paper
money it thus receives? And what does
it profit the people lo have their Govern
ment borrow gold to pay it back with in
terest added?
To be sure, if a creditor prefers silver or
paper money, the Treasury will give him
the kind he asks for, out it must then
rush off and buy gold to redeem tbe silver
or paper be took, for Secretary Carlisle
says it is not money in itselfâ merely
promises to pay money, which is made of
gold, and gold only. Hence he must be
prepared to redeem it when presented,
which necessitates the purchase of the re
quired amount of gold. That is Secretary
Carlisle's way of maintaining "parity" be
tween gold and silver. What a humbug
of a financier the Cleveland administra
tion is, anyway.
Now, the people, densely ignorant as
they are, according to Cleveland's esti
mate of them, have an idea that the parity
of the metals can be maintained only by
making them interchangeable by tne Gov
ernment reserving the right to make its
obligations payable in either gold or silver,
at its own option. The Treasury reports
that it has nearly $300,000,000 on hand,
but itself discredits tbe standing of evsry
dollar of it, except a little over $100,000,000
in gold which it bought with bonds to
give the silver and paper it holds
"parity." What a pity it is that Cleve
land and company have none of the peo
ple's kind of "ignorance."
THE POSITION OF SILVER.
Gold standardites are quit* right. Fifty
times more silver dollars have been coined
since 1873 than in the entire previous
history of tbe country, but they forget to
mention tbe fact that the act demonetiz
ing silver dollars continued them as dollars
only upon the basis of their redemption
in gold. It is nonsense, therefore, to say
that the country is enjoying bimetallism
to a greater degree than ever before.
About 180,000,000 of tbe silver bullion
purchase notes have already been re
deemed in gold, and the balance outstand
ing can be presented for redemption in
gold at any time their holders like.
By the ruling of Secretary Carlisle our
silver dollars are mere promises to pay
their face value in gold, and, therefore,
nothing more nor less than token money.
The people should not allow themselves to
be hoodwinked by the administration's cry
tbat there is a "sufficient abundancy" of
money. The country is squarely and
fairly upon a gold basis, which makes the
actual per capita money of the country
not muco over $5.
The announcement that the House
Committee on Banking and Currency has
adjourned to December seems to fore
shadow an early closing of this session of
Congress. There is. of course, much to
do, but with Cleveland in the White
House nothing goou can be done, and the
statesmen might as well quit and let the
country give its undivided attention to
Presidential politics.
Minister Denby figures up a chance for
pretty good trade with China, but we
would cut a poor figure if we Bacrifioed our
home trade to get it. The development of
our commerce is desirable, but not when
it is to be carried on at the expense of our
workingnien.
The coronation ceremonies at Moscow
have enabled the Czar to make a wonder
ful display of the various races of men
under the Â»way of his widely extended em
pire, but when the Prince of Wales comes
to the throne he can beat it.
The display of imperial power at Mos
cow is said to have inspired the Russians
with the belief that they can whip all
Western Europe without the aid of allies,
and perhaps they may be tempted some
day to try it;
There is a man in Rhode Island who

awful strain on the State to bold him.
LEGITIMATE JOURNALISM.
New York Newspaper Maker.
The Newspaper Maker is in entire ac
cord with the Ban Francisco Call's view
that a newspaper should sell news and not
books, bicycles or baby-carriages. It
should aim to give its readers the value of
their money in fullness of its reports of
trade, politics, society and all the abound
ing activities of life. If it cannot give
news enough to justify the charge it makes
it should cease to call itself a newspaper
and Bolicit subscriptions only for its cou
pons and their chances.
The subject, however, has another aspect
that is too often overlooked. The press
stands in almost a confidential relation to
business. The newspaper and the mer
chant are allies. They are of mutual
helpfulness when each is conducted in
legitimate channels. When the news
paper, however, combines its press with a
junkahop and proceeds to issue coupons
by which people can get a cheap sort of
books, bicycles or baby carriages at prices
far below what good articles can be sold
for by men who have a reputation as hon
est merchants to maintain, then tbe press,
instead of being the ally, becomes the foe
of the merchant.
Instead of building up trade it tends to de
moralize it, and not infrequently seriously
injures business by introducing into a
community an overstock of cheap articles
of one kind or another that prevents the
sales of the merchant.

Woman's Congressâ A Thinker, City. With
out making a personal canvass it would be an
impossibility to state how many of the leaders
of the late Woman's Congress and of the Suf
frage Association are wage-earners and what
occupations they follow. It may be stated
that Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw are lectur
ers, that Miss Cooper is a Sunday-school teacher
and the head of the California Kindergarten

6HKRinAN's Rideâ E. F., Oakland, Cal. The

some reader of this department can enlighten
the correspondent.
A CrPFCL of Waterâ C. E. R., Elmira, Cal.
This correspondent writes, "A cup of water
waa sitting on a table. A says, *I drank the
cupiul' and B says, 'I drank it empty.' Which
expression is correct?" If the writer had
made the declaration that the cap of water
was standing on the table he would have been
more correct than to make the startling an
nouncement that it was sitting on the table
A's assertion that he drank the cupful of
water is correct, while B's expression is not,
probably what he meant to say was "I drank
and emptied the cup."

they used glass retorts and vessels similar in

with the men who filled them, and in time
were placed in windows to show where the
mixtures were prepared.

Sunday afternoon, at Scottish Hall,
Rev. Hermann Warszawiak spoke on "The
Signs of the Times in Connection with the
Restoration of Israel.' 1 He said: "There
is a marvelous movement all over the
world among the Israelitesâ a movement
toward Christianity.
'â¢For 1800 years the churches have liter
ally closed their doors to the Israelite.
Now it is different. Thousands of He
brews to-day are asking, "Have we not
rejected the true Messiah, the father sent
to us? Is not Christ indeed the Messiah? 1
"I come to encourage the missionary
spirit in the Christian, that he may open
the door of salvation to his brother, the
S "\*ou e will be successful, my friends. You
cannot help being victorious, because
you have the right on your side. You
have now such a grand chance, a chance
that you never had before, to help your
brother and prepare him for tbe second
coming of the Lord."
A LIBERAL LECTURE.
Dr. TorK Speaks Kloqoently at the Free

Dr. York addressed a large audience Sun -
day night at Scottish Hall oa "Wasted
Power in the Science of Life; or How
to Be Happy." He said:
"The object of our associationâ the Free
thought Liberal Unionâ is to promote in
tellectual and moral self-culture and the
complete separation of chnrch and state.
We do not expect every one to accept all
that we utter; we wish others to have the
same liberty to reject as we have to utter
it. We are not trying to suit everybody ;
we are simply trying to tell the truth as
we comprehend it, and what is truth to us
mar not seem to be truth to another.
"In the nature of things it is not possi
ble for all to reach the fame conclusions
from what is seen and heard; our bair is
not the same color, our eyes and noses are
not alike and as we differ in our physi
ological and phrenological likeness, so do
we differ in our beliefs.
"Of course we will not all agree as to what
is true or what is false, and the only com
mon ground for us as liberals Is a love of
truth and mental freedom, and we ask of
you only what we concede to you, the
right to receive or reject and a kindly
toleration for differences of belief."

ANTON SCHOTT'S RECITAL.
The Great German Tenor Xtovtotra the
Masters Before Wagner.
Anton Schott, the great German tenor,
. whose pathetic rendition of the com
positions of Wagner has already gained
for him in this City the esteem of a large
number of music k>vers who appreciate
the best when they hear it. gave another
song recital last night at Native Sons' Hall.
His purpose was to review the pre-
Wagnerian masters, that he might show
the work on which Wagner himself im
proved until he stood in the position of
the master of the school in. winch he had
grown up as a pupil. Beginning with
Yon Gluck's lades 1 '" from Iphigenie
auf Tauris, and giving a selection from
Mehul, from Beethoven, from Weber,
from* Cornelius and from Loewe, he led up
to his own and his country's favorite, the
only Wagner, whose Hearth Scene, Home
Song and Sword Scene he rendered with
splendid voice. . .'
The programme was varied by piano
recitations by Arthur Fickenscher, who
rounded out the earlier masters with some
exquisite selections from Schubert, Liszt,
and those from whom Schott had chosen
pieces for his strong, rich voice. There
was a good-sized audience, composed of
evidently critical musicians who were un
stinted in their applause.

ESCAPE FROM DROWNING.
Henry E. Truebenbach, tbe Well-
Known Merchant, Fell From an
Oakland Steamer.
A peculiar state of affairs has arisen ir
the trade with the Alaskan gold fields.
Immense quantities of provisions and
general merchandise are being shipped,
but every ounce of the stuff is coming
from British Columbia. The barkentine
C. C. Funk is now loaded with a general
cargo and is ready to sail.
The steamer Umatilla, which arrived
yesterday, has over 200 tons of goods for
Forty-mile camp aboard. This will be
j transhipped into the bark William Bow
| deti and when she is filled the steamer
! Bertha will take her place. The City of
Puebla and vValla Walla will brine down
two more heavy consignments and the
chances are that a fourth vessel will have
to be chartered to take up all the goods
offering. Everything is shipped in bond
and in consequence Custom-house officers
have to be on vatch on the vessels nisht
and day.
Henry E. Truebenbach, tbe senior mem
ber of the firm of Truebenbach & Co., had
j a very narrow escape from drowning yes
l terday. When he reached his office at 113
| Clay street in the morning ne was not
| feeling very well, so he made up his mind
:to take a trip to Oakland. He left for
I home on the 2p. m. trip and went forward
j on the lower deck to enjoy the breeze.
I When the Oakland was half a mile from
the Market-street landing Mr. Trueben-
I back took a seat on the railing. A few
j minutes later he lost his balance and fell
I into the bay. How he escaped being
| struck by the paddle wheel is a mystery
no one can solve. Captain McKechnie
saw the man fall and stopping the steamer
ordered a boat lowered. The crew worked
like clockwork, and in six minutes the
drowning man had beÂ«Â»n picked up and
the Oakland was on her way again.
Truebenbach was taken into the fire
room and kept there until a dry suit of
clothes was got from his home at 2416
Webster street. He was nothing the worse
an hour afterward for bis wetting.
The Pacific Steam Whaling Company's
tender, the Jeanie, will sail for the Arctic

! last chance for letters to go direct to the
I whalers.
The schooner Cnetco, which went on a
sunken rocic at Crescent City, has been
patched up, and will be towed "down by the
pteam schooner Cleone. On her arrival !
she will go on the drydock for a thorough j
overhauling.
Captain Bennett, superintendent Oi the
Paciric Coast Steamship Company's
wharves, returned from an Eastern trip
yesterday. He made the trip in order to ,
vis.it his mother, who is growing old and
feeble. He came back over the Northern
Pacific to Seattle and thence to San Fran
cisco on the Umatilla.
Among the passengers who went to
Eureka on the Pomona yesteiday was the
well-known politician and attorney,
George A. Knight. He will be absent only
a few days and will be back in time to
start with the delegates for St. Louis the
latter part of the week.
The collier Washtenaw has broken the
record for a round trip to Puget Sound.
She went from here to Tacoma, dis
charged, and loaded again and got back to
San Francisco in seven and a half days.
The crew had few idle moments during
that trip.
Customs Inspector Carlin got a good
ducking yesterday. He tripped over a j
wire hawser on Main-street wharf and fell |
into the bay. His cries brought some ;
sailors to his assistance, and he was soon j
fished out, little the worse for his fall.
BURNING VESSEL SIGHTED.
The Captain of the Ship SterMng:
Encounters the German Ship
Corlolanus on Fire.
The captain of the ship Sterling, which
sailed from New York on January 4 and
arrived in this port yesterday afternoon,
reports having met in latitude 10 dee.
south, longitude 31 deg. west, the German
ship Coriolanus from Bremen, bound to
Rangoon, which signaled that the vessel
w*s on fire.
The Sterling stood t>y during that night.
N&xt morning, being signaled that the
fire on the Corio4anus was gaining, the
captain of the Sterling boarded the former
vessel and found that the ship was in bal
last and that the bre was aft among the
mats. He intended talcing off the crew of
the burning vessel, but during the day the
fire modified and the next day he stood
away for Bahia.
A DEMAND FOR SUNLIGHT
Plans for .the City Bidding
Downtown May Be
Changed.
One of the Main Entrances Should
Ba Placed on Merchant
Street.
When the United States architects
planned the lighthouse on this coas( they
provided steel rods to protect the houses
from lightning. When Layer, the archi
tect of the new City Hall, made the plans
for that edifice, he followed the custom of
placing the best office apartments and the
courtrooms and Judges' chambers on the
north side of the building, where the rays
of the sun would not increase the tempera
ture. That was the fashion of architecture
in the East, where people in summer seek
the shade. In this planning the subordi
nate or back rooms were given the
southern exposure, so highly prized in
this climate for the sunshine afforded.
These defects in the planning of the new
City Hall have been explained to the
United States architect, who is now pre
paring plans for the new Postoftice. When
he was out here a few months ago he saw
for himself that the old-fashioned plans
for public buildings in Cincinnati, St.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
The Barkentine C. C. Funk Lying in the Stream Loaded With Merchandise for the Alaskan Miners. The
Entire Cargo Was Shipped Here From British Columbia and Transhipped on the Barkentine.
[Sketched by a " Call " artist]
Louis and New Orleans would not be suit
able for a Government building in San
Francisco.
There is danger now that our local archi
tects, in planning for the new building to
be erected on the old City Hall site, on
Kearny street, between Merchant and
Washington, are making the very mistake
which San Francisco is trying to avoid in
the new Postoilice structure, and which
should have been avoided in the new City
Hall. The plan for this building on
Kearny street which seems to be in great
est favor with the Supervisors proposes to
put the best offices on the northern or
Washington-street side of the building
and leave the Merchant-street space for
back rooms. A. greater mistake could not
be made. The main entrances to the
building should be on Kearny and Mer
chant streets and the rooms most fre
quently used by the public should have
the sunlight, which thp southern exposure
of Merchant street will afford.
When the offices of the Assessor, Aud
itor, Treasurer, Tax Collector and Mayor
were located in the old City Hall, the
favorite walk of persons visiting the hall
was along Montgomery street to Merchant.
This was the route for all who came from
points south of Washington and east of
Kearny. In fact, the main entrance was
on Merchant street, and the persons going
in that way came at once to the leading
ottices.
Eiehty out of every hundred persons
visiting the building will come from the
region of the City south of Washington
street. They will so in by way of Kearny
or Merchant streets.
The most gorgeous and inviting passage
way on Washington street will not deflect
the current of travel. There seems to be a
purpose in the interest of some hotel
keepers to make the public travel a block
out of the way to reach the main entrance
to the proposed hall.
The new building is to be paid for by the
taxpayers of the City at Jarge and it should
be constructed to provide for the conven
ience of the greatest number of citizens
having business to transact in the courts
and offices to be established there. The
Supervisors may see the danger of impos
ing a great inconvenience on the public to
please two or three boardinc-house keepers.
HER GREW WAS IN IRONS
The Men on the Hawaiian
Bark Leahi Mutinied While
at Kahului.
Two of Them Are Now Serving
Sentences on the Reef at
Honolulu.
The Hawaiian bark Leahi had a perilous
voyage from Australia to Hawaii and
thence to San Francisco. The vessel
reached port last Sunday, and no sooner
had she come to anchor off the sugar re
finery than the crew quit her in a body.
They say that during the entire voyage
they were kept at the pumps, and that
under such circumstances life was not
worth living. At Kahului they mutinied,
snd two of the men are now in jail down
there, serving out their sentences.
The other members of the crew Â«rere put
on board in irons, and three Japs were
shipped to fill the places of the imprisoned
sailors. On the voyage to San Francisco
t!ie white men worked the bark and the
Japs manned the pumps. As soon as the
men get their money they intend laying
their grievances before the United States
District Attorney, and see wbat can be
done for their companions in jail. T+>ey
are all American citizens, and assert that
the United Estates Consul at Kahulai would
not do anything for them.
The Leahi left Newcastle, New South
Wales, three month* ago for the Hawaiian
islands with a cargo of coal. When a few
days out, according to the sailors, she
sprang aleak, and the men were ordered
to the pumps. These were kept going
until Kahului was reached, and then the
crew mutinied and left the ship. They
sought the protection of the American
Consul, and that gentleman told them to
get a lawyer. They did so, but at the last
moment the lawyer found there was a
doubt about getting his fee, so he left them
in the lurch.
They could get no redress, and the Con
sul said he would order them back to the
bark, but that they could please them
selves as to whether thny went to sea in
her or not.
They refused to go to sea, and Captain
Johnson called in the police. Paul Ihns
and Fred Comrie were set down as ring-
Jeaders, and were fined $30 each and sen
tenced to two months' imprisonment. The
other men were put aboard in irons, and
were kept there until the Leahi was ready
to sail. According to the men the bark's
foremast-head and mizzen and fore stays
are sprung, and that in consequence she
required very delicate handling during her
long voyage. After discharging the Leahi
will go on the drydock for repairs.
Fun at Sutro's.
On next Wednesday evening Colonel Thomas
P. Robinson will entertain the San Francisco
Swimming: Club at dinner at the Cliff House,
and after dinner the club will adjourn to the
baths and eive a special entertainment. The
exhibition will commence with a march in the
water, in which fifty members will take part.
The baths will be darkened, and the swimmers
will perform many intricate evolutions while
swimming, each on; carrying a Cninese lan
tern. The effect upon the water is very novel
and beautiful. Besides, there will be a minuet
danced in the water, a match game of water
polo and an exhibition of high and fancy
airing and trapeze flying; also juvenile races
of different distances.

A Marriage Is Now on the Tapis, as
the Lovers Are Again Good
Friends.
A lovers' qnarrel nearly ended in a trag
edy yesterday. The couple were on Fre
mont street wharf and engaged in an
animated conversation. Exactly what
they were taJking about will never be
known, but before even a warning cry
could be given the girl was overboard and
struggling in the water. A couple of
planks were thrown overboard by her
companion, bat she made no attempt to
reach them. A box was thrown from the
steam schooner North Fork, and it floated
alongside of her as she was going down
for tne #ast time. She involuntarily
clutched it and managed to hold on until
help, in the shape of one of the steamer's
crew reached her.
The couple are Miss Ida Owens, who
lives on Central avenue, and Henry Chris
tensen. the master ot a coasting schooner.
They walke-1 down the wharf in a lovelike
manner, and when opposite the Spreckles'
drydock stopped to look at the North
Fork, which was being overhauled.
Christenscn, according to the men on
the steam schooner, made a remark to
Miss Owens that roused her anger.
She flashed back a remark and
he replied. Then she looked up
in surprise and apparently asked
a question. The man nodded, and
then whether the girl tripped and fell or
jumped overboard remains in doubt.
The men on the steamer say she jumped,
and Miss Owens is equally certain that
she tripped. One thing is certain â Chris
tensen a only attempt at rescue was the
throwing of a couple of pieces of scantling
overboard after her.
Seeing that the woman was in imminent
dancer Martin Bare, one of the North
j Fork's crew, sprang overboard after her.
j The vessel was in the floating-dock, and
' the dive must have been one ol about
forty feet, but the brave sailor did not
hesitate an instant. One of the vessels
light lines had been left towing astern
after the docking, and on coming to the
surface Bare seized it, and on reaching the
drowning girl made a bowline and put it
over her head and shoulders and under
her arms. H>- then gave the signal to
the men on the dry dock and they hauled
her ashore. Bare clambered up himself
and, not even waiting for thanks, hurried
aboard the steamer to chance his clothes.
When Miss Owens reached the wharf
Ccrietensen had a hack in waiting and he
at once placed her in it. They were hur
ried away, md when the home of Mrs.
Jorgensen, oÂ»i Rincon Hill, was reached
the young lady was at once put to bed.
When seen later in the day she did not
j appear to be much the worse* for the duck
: ing. She denied having jumped over
i hoard, but asserted that during an excit
, ing argument she tripped and fell. Both
| C'hristensen and Mrs. Jorgensen were at
her bedside, and the former was doing
everything in his power for the invalid.
He laughed at the idea of a quarrel and
I said it was an accident pure and simple.
Martin Bare and the mate of the North
i Fork ass. rt that Miss Owens stamped her
foot in anger at Christensen's remark, and
that when lie nodded in reply to her ques
tion she jumped overboard. In any event,
what at tirst looked like ending in a trag
edy will now probably end in a wedding as
soon as Miss Owens is able to be out and
about again.
FOR PURER FOOD.
Inspector* of Bakeries TVHI ProhahlT
Be Appointed To- Day.
At the meeting of the Board of Health
to-day the matter of appointing inspectors
of bakeries will come up. For some time
past the hoard has been working with
Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald with a
view of improving the sanitary conditions,
materials used and the condition of the
operative?. In this respect the two offices
! overlap, and both have been doing good
work in cleaning out some disreputable
places. The several bakers' unions have
been of great assistance to the officers, and
the new inspectors are likely to be selected
from the union ranks.
Their duties will be to inspect the mate

rials used in the production of food, Dread
stuffs, flour, lard, fruits, ecps, butter, etc.
The Board of Health has evidently de
termined to put a stop to the use of cheap
adulterations in food and to see that the
sanitation of every bakery in San Fran
cisco is as near perfect as :t can be made.
The Labor Commissioner is determined to
look after the condition of the workmen in
the bakeries. With a strong team of offi
cers it is likely that tne bakeries will turn
out a better class of food and the condition
of tne operatives be better than ever before.
MARRIAGE IN COURT.
Samuel Singerman and Kebecca Caaruer
Amicably Settle Their Dif
ferences,
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan was called
upon yesterday morning to unite in mar
riage Samuel Singerman, 31 years of age,
and Rebecca Casmer, 42 years of age. The
ceremony was performed in Judge Camp
bell's chambers and the Judge adjourned
court for a few moments to be present.
Singerman a lew weeks ago paid his ad
dresses to. Miss Casmer, who Jives at 512
Post street, and finally proposed marriage
and was accepted. He told Miss Casmer
that he could inaÃe money by opening a
cigar-stand, as he had been a cigar "drum
mer," if he had the capital to furnish the
stock. She gave him $2<JO worth of jew
elry to raise money upon, and Singerman
absconded with it. accompanied by a
young woman from Los Angeles.
Miss Casmer swore out a warrant for his
arrest in Judge Campbell's court for grand
larceny. He was arrested in Denver and
brought back last Friday by Detective
Crockett. Since being in prison he had
renewed his offer of marriage and was
again accepted. After the marriage cere
mony Judge Campbell dismissed the case
against Singerman, and bride and groom
left the court together to spend their
honey moon.

Biggest Ships in the Service
to This Harbor.
Collector Wise is in receipt of a circular
from Commissioner Chamberlain of the
Treasury Department officially notifying
him of an extension of time in unloading
vessels. This authority is found in an act
of Congress approved May 9, reading as
follows:
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America, in Congress assembled, that section
2880 ol the Revised Statutes of the United
States be amended so as to read as follows':
"Section 2880. Whenever any merchandise
shall be imported into any port'of the United
States from any foreign port, in any vessel, at
the expiration of ton working days if the ves
sel Is less than 500 tons register, and within
fifteen working days if it is of 500 tons register
and less than 1000, and within twenty working
days if it is of 1000 tons register Â«nd less than
1500, and within twenty-live working days if
it is ot 1500 tons register and upward, not
including legal holidays and days when the
condition of the wenther prevents the unlad
ing oi the vessel with safety to its cargo, alter
the time within which the report of the master
of any vessel is required to De made to the col
lector of the district, if there is found any
merchnndise other than has been reported for
some other district or some foreign port, the
collector shall take possession thereof; but
with the consent of the owner or consignee ot
any merchandise, or with the consent of the
owner or master of the vessel in which the
same may be imported, the merchandise may
betaken possession of by the collector aft^r
one day's notice to the collector of the district.
All merchandise ho taken shall be delivered
pursuant to the order of the collector of the
district, for which a certificate or receipt shall
be granted."
The shipping interests of San Francisco
have been much retarded by the operation
of the old law. Vessels were compelled to
unload in from eight to fifteen days, ac
cording to the tonnage. This act was
passed in March, 1799, and was well
enough for the ships then in use.
Very few small vessels, however, are
now engaged in foreign trade, ships from
IMX) to 3000 tons being the rule rather than
the exception. It was hazardous, there
fore, with the conditions prevailing here,
for one of these modern trans-Atlantic
liners to come to San Francisco. The re
sult has been that ships have gone to such
ports as insured prompt unloading of
cargo.
The Surveyor of the Port and Stewart
Menzies began agilatine the matter before
Congress some months ago, and the result
of their labors is seen in the amended act
as printed above.
SEIFERT IS IN OHIO.
Marion County Attorney* Assert Posi
tively He Has Been Seen There
Recently.
The mystery surrounding the disappear
ance of Henry Seifert, who was vaguely
supposed to nave been murdered near
Kenwood about May 4. has been cleared
up. At least his wife thinks so.
Yesterday Mrs. Seifert received a letter
from Attorneys Sullivan & Geary of
Marion, Ohio, to the effect that the miss
ing man had been seen by several persons
near that place. HÂ«e declined, so the letter
states, to give any reason for his appear
ance there alone.
Mrs. Seifert is indignant that she should
have been so cruelly deserted and proposes
to see' whether there is not some legal re
dress for an abandonen bride of three
months.
Bacfc of this peculiar action on the part
of Seifert is a love affair, which had been
going on for some months prior to the
binding of the present marriage knot.
How Seifert met the lady, now bearing
his name, is not known, but it is presumed
to have been through a marriage bureau.
In any event a long correspondence oc
curred between Seifert and the woman h.j
finally married, tbe bride-elect goin^ to
Youngstown, where the ceremony was
performed.
It seems if the Marion attorneys are cor
rect that Seifert grew tired of his Califor
nia bride, and, apparently yielding to her
influence, sold his property in Ohio and
started for the coast. This was merely an
excuse to be well rid of her.
Prior to his marriage with Mrs. Seifert,
so that lady says, he was greatly enam
ored of an Ohio belle of uncertain sum
mers, but that passion was all lost when
he beheld her. At least that was what
Seifert told her.
Now the bride of three months is in a
quandary. She cannot believe that her
lieee lord has gone back to the tirst love,
and yet respectable attorneys tell her that
he has been seen repeatedly in that nelgh-
Dorhood.
Mrs. Seifert has not yet decided just
what her plan of action will be if It is
finally proven that her husband is not
dead, but hovers in the flesh around his
former charmer. She promises, however,
to get even Ie some way,
WILL SOON BUILD.
Mission Lodge, F. and A. M., Has Pni-
chased a New Site.
The new building wnich Mission Lodge
No. 169, F. and A. M., has contemplated
building for some time past seems now an
assured fact. The lodge has been quietly
looking around for a suitable locality for
its new quarters and has selected a lot
on the west side of Mission street, between
Twenty-second and Twenty-third. The
lot has a frontage of 54 feet on Mission
street and a depth of 125 feet. It adjoins
on the rear the lot of Emmanuel Baptist
Church.
"Our present lease," said C. D. Bnnker,
the secretary of the lodge, yesterday, "will
expire a year from the coming; June, and
before that time our building will prob
ably be completed. No plans have been
made as yet, except the plans in the heads
of individual members. Within a month
or so probably, we will have decided upon
somethina definite. Until our new build
ing is completed the lodge will continue
to meet at its present lodgerooms at the
corner of Sixteenth and Valencia streets."

A HUNDRED YEARS OLD
Some Sound Scientific Suggestions to
Men and Women Who Are Looking;
Into the Future.
"How can I live a hundred years ?"
Very happy most of us would be if we only
knew the secret of the centenarian's life and
now that secret has *t last been discovered.
A well-known scientist, who made this dis-
covery, has for years past been investigating
the habits of men imd women who have
reached advanced years. He has found that
in nearly every case the people who enjoy the
healthiest and happiest old age are those who
mate regular use of some pure stimulant.
"After middle life," he says, "the enerÃiei
droop and nature requires stimulating and
assisting. For this reason old people who wish
to be strong and well should never let a day
pass without taking some pure stimulant
which can be depended upon."
This is an interesting fact and It clearly
shows that scientific men are correct when
they tell us that nothing compares with a pure
stimulant for building up the system. They
also tell us that the safest and best stimulant
is pure malt whisky, because it is not only a
tonic but a food for the nerves and tissues.
There Is. in fact, only one pure whisky in ex-
istence, entirely free from adulteration. It is
known as Duffy's Pure Malt Whisky and
thousands of aged men and women have testi-
fied to its remarkable strengthening effects.
Elderly people who suffer from stomach ail-
mt'iu< or any form of weakness will tind great
relief from taking Duffy's pure malt. It is uot
au ordinary whisky, "but a pure stimulant
which contains all the properties that con-
tribute to health and none that can injure.
For this reason, in purchasing from grocers or
druggists, beware of inferior imitations and
insist on getting exactly what you a.sk ior.

A GLIMPSE AT THE
RAILWAY'S BOOKS,
How the Combine Is on
Trial With Assessor
Siebe.
MISSING MEMORANDA.
J. L. Willcut's Unwilling Hunt
for Interesting Evi
dence.
PILES OF LEDGERS IN COURT.
Peculiar Basis on Which the Rail
road's Secretary Says the Pool
Was Formed.
Plt will not be the fault of the opponents
of Assessor Siebe and Judge Wallace if
the entire history of the consolidation of the
street railways does not come out.
Assessor Siebe is undergoing a prelimi
nary examination for perjury, but Siebe is
not the only one on trial. He is nomi
nally the only defendant, but much that
is interesting and tome that is sensational
w ili come out of those canvas-bound vol
umes which, under order of Judge Wal
lace, were brought into court from the
railroad office yesterday morninc.
There is but little to fear from the Su
preme Court under the present examina
tion. Judge Wallace is sitting as a com
mitting magistrate to investigate a crimi
nal charge against the Assessor. The
Assessor is charged with assessing the
property of the MarKet-street Railway
Company, worth, it is claimed, $18,500,000,
at $3,800,000, and then, after making such
&n assessment, swearing that he had done
his duty. On his oath to that effect the
charge of perjury is based.
Mr. Freidenrich and Mr. Naphtaly of
>"aphtaly, Freidenrich and Ackernian and
darrett "McEnerney ranged themselves at
the defendant's table as counsel for Seibe.
Andy Clunie tooU a smali corner of the
same table and established himself aj
counsel for the prosecution. J. L. Will
cut, secretary of the railway combination,
took the witness-stand and reluctantly
furnished the few facts of the morning.
Proceedings opened with the filing of a
demurrer Dy Mr. Freidenrich.
Mr. Freidenrich in his argument on the
demurrer stated that it was Dascd unon
the rroand that the complaint did not
ttate facts sufficient to constitute a public
offense. He said it was a well established
principle of law that perjury could not be
predicated upon any oath unless the mat
ter complained of was material to some
issue pending, or thr.t mieht become pend
ing, before any tribunal. The oath of the
Assessor attesting to tbe correctness of the
iiste^ineiH roll was not material to any
issue tliat could arise. The assessment
roll was cornpiete without the oath.
Judge Wallace saii there was no doubt
as to the correctness of the principle of
law as stated tjy counsel, hu'. he suggested
l hat the matter complained of ini^ht be
material to an issue ihat might arise be
fore the Board of Equalization. He said
that, although tlie roll was complete with
out tno oath, still the oath was supposed
to moan something; it was required for a
pr.rpose.
â¢I cannot hold.'' he paid, "that this
oath, the form of which is provided for in
the statute, means nothing, and that the
Legislature ihatiranied the oath in great
detail meant nothing. I shall overrule the
demurer."
The unwilling Mr. Willcut was then
sworn, and Mr. Clunie started in to show
that the property of the consolidated rail
waya was wortu far beyond $3,800,000.
}!:.r he had hard work. Mr. WiUcut said
that when the consolidation was made
there was no valuation of t tie property of
the various roads. The roads were taken
upon their earning capacity, or their sup
posed earning capacity. He said there
Mas no paper in existence that showed
what the property of the roads was worth,
and there were no minutes and no records
of the gigantic transaction any wl. ere.
The heads of the roads just met and
B?reed. It was decided that tbe roads
should have certain proportionate inter
ests. How they arrived at these propor
tions Mr. Willcut was quite willing to ex
plain, but his explanation enlightened
neither court, counsel nor spectators.
Then the court took a hand, but his
Honor's questions were much like drops of
rain on a pable roof. Then Clunie opened
lire once more. He wanted to know what
papers had ever been drawn up regarding
the consolidation. He was told there was
none. Some times Mr. Willcut made little
memoranda â just little ones in lead pencil
on very small bits of paperâ but these had
been lost of destroyed. In fact he remem
bered having destroyed some himself. But
as to the basis of the capital stock the
directors hau just met and decided that it
should be $18,500 000.
The defense objected to this line of testi
mony. The question before the court, Mr.
Freidenrich said, was not the value of the
property of the railway company, but
whether or not Assessor Siebe had com
mitted perjury. His Honor thought that
as the perjury charge was based on the
allegation that the railway company's
property had not been assessed up to its
lull value, he thought the question of
valuation very material. Mr. Freidenrich
argued further, and then Mr. Clunia said
he thought tbe Assessor ought to be very
glad to get any information possible on the
subject.
Once more Mr. Willcut was asked if there
had ever been any paper regarding the
consolidation signed by the heads of
departments, and once more Mr. Willcut
gaiiJ "No."
Then Clunie produced a typewritten
document and read from it. It was a copy
of the agreement entered into at the time
of the consolidation and sisned by the
reprf-senatives of each corporation. It
showed that it was agreed that the capital
stock of the consolidated corporation
should be apportioned as follows: Niae
teen per cent to the Omnibus Cable Com
pany, 5 per cent to the North Beach and
Mission Railway Company and 76 percent
to the companies included in the Market-
Eireet system. It was further agreed that
the property and assets of the companies
t-hould be taken as they existed at tbe
time of the consolidation, and nil debts
and liabilities of each company to be
assumed by the consolidated corporation,
it being understood that the stockholders
of the Omnibus Cable Company would
arrange for deferring the payment of half
its floating indebtedness for at Jeast six
months.
It was further agreed that $18, 500,000
worth of 5 per cent bonds, payable in
thirty years, should be issued, secured by
all the property and franchises of the cor
poration. Clunie also showed that a sub
sequent agreement was signed when the
Ferries and Cliff House system was taken
nto tuo consolidation, by which 12,810 of
the total issue of 178,890 shares were dis
tributed to that corporation.
A light broke upon Mr. Wilicut and a
emile illuminated his features as he re
tailed that there was Indeed a document.
Mr. Clunie had reminded him of it. He
bad furnotten all about the document just
read.
Mr. Willcut's memory seemed to have
been jogged in more than one direction,
for ha rustled through more papers and
finally announced that in the "journal"
there was an "inventory" of the property
of each company. Just an inventoryâ no
valuation at all, but just en inventory â
yet when Clunie demanded the same he
read tho accounts in dollars and cents.
It was an interesting account. Perma
nent rights of way, which had been given
by the City for nothing at all, figure in the
list as worth $21,829,908 72 and the total
ran up to $27,255,606 60. Mr. \Villcut ex
plained that debits against this amount
brought it down to $13,500,000, the amount
of the capital stock.
The debit account was demanded, but
the bell clanged 12 o'clock and Judge Wal
lace ordered a recess until this morning.
This was to cive Mr. Willcut time to dig
up more papers. He asked what ones he
snould bring and Clunie said, "Better
bring them all." There will bo interest
ing times in court to-day.

FEIST IS A HAPPY MAN.
The President of the Emporium
Pleased With the First
Day's Business.
He Had Anticipated Success, but the
Event Exceeded His Fondest
Hopes.
The first day's business at The Empo
rium exceeded the most sanguine expecta
tions of the management.
Great thrones of buyers crowded the
aisles from early in the morning until the
closing hours, and large as the force of
cierks was it was found utterly impossible
to serve them ali.
Mr. Feist, the president of The Empo
rium Company and the projector of the
great enterprise, was the recipient of un
limited coneratulations.
A brief interview was obtained with
nini, in which he expressed his gratifica
tion in the wonderful success of the open
ing reception to the Dublic last Saturday
A. Fclst, President of the Emporium
Company.
afternoon, when it was estimated that
fully 125,000 people passed through the
building.
For seven years Mr. Feist has been plan
ning The Emporiumâ for live years work
ing unremiltinsly on his colossal scheme.
"1 anticipated great things," said lie,
"but not such a remarkable outpourine of
the people that came to us Saturday. The
success of The Emporium as a business
venture is assured, if to-day'g selling be
any criterion- No; leave me out of it,"
he continued, when asked for some facts
about himself. "The results before you
could never have been accomplished had
I not been aided by the outlay of vast
sums of money, and to tbose who have
furnished this capital a large part, in fact
the larger part, of the success of this en
terprise is due, and particularly to Mrs.
Parrott and Mr. C. de Guigne. In creat
ing this grand edifice they have rendered
an everlasting service to the City and
State."
Mr. Feist wa3 born in Germany about
fifty years ago and came to California dur
ing the war, where he has since been en
gaged in various mercantile pursuits,
principally in the dry-goods business, and
as a projector of great enterprises Mr.
Feist now ranks as one of the forepiost
men of the day.
While in the larger cities of the world
similar projects have been carried to a suc
cessful completion none of the great mer
cantile establishments approach in beauty
of design and modern facilities for doing
business San Francisco's great Emporium.
AN EVENING AUCTION SALE.
A'LÂ»rgÂ« Number of Lots Difipoaad Of by
O'Farrell St Co.
Several hundred people attended last
night at the auction-rooms of O'Farreli &
Co.. at the sale held by them of 100 lots in
the Excelsior Homestead. It was a crowd
that came to buy rather than out of curi
osity, and bidding from first to last was
very spirited. Allarpe percentage of the
total number of lots offered was disposed
of and excellent prices were realized, bet
ter prices in fact than were anticipated.
It was evident that a majority of the
bidders were personally familiar with the
property, and this was especially notice
able when an extra choice corner was put
up. The lots are well located, are nice
and level and ready for building, and the
success that attended their sale v;as ex
tremely gratifying to O'Farreil & Co.
Among the lowest forms of life tiiere are
not found any organs which, with pro
priety, can be called ears.

The Dimond ordinance, for the passage
of which more than 12.fÂ»00 people peti
tioned, was passed to print yesterday by
the Board of Supervisors, after being
amended.
The passage of the ordinance gives gen
eral satisfaction to the public, and will end
the agitation whicn has been going on re
garding the vexed question of the issuance
of streetcar transfers. The ordinance in
troduced by Supervisor Dimond as printed
above was amended by Supervisor
Spreckels. Section 2 is the amendment.
The ordinance must receive the Mayor's
signature before it becomes a law, or moat
be passed over his veto by a two-thirds
vote in case he should veto it.
When Mr. Dimond rose to mo"c for a
reconsideration of the action of the board
at its last meeting in refusing to pass bis
measure his desk was almost hidden from
sicht by the sheets of a hu^e petition,
which he said contained the names of
12,107 residents o! San Francisco who use i
the cars of the Market-street system almost j
duily.
The petitioners asked the board to abol- j
ish the transfer-check system and force i
the company to return to the old method j
of issuing transfers.
Mr. Dimond moved the adoption of his :
order, which was in the form of a resolu- |
tion, ami Mr. Spreckels offered the follow- j
ing amendment, that was at once accepted !
by M r. Dimond :
Section 2. No pcr?on except a duly author- '
iz^i conductor or agent ol a person, tirm or
corporation operating a line of street railroad
within the City ami county of San Francisco
shall, within *aid city and county, i^su.-, <i< -

any transfer, check or ticket issued or j.ur
poftiiiÃ to be issued by such person, linn Â«.r
corporation so operating such line of street
railroad for passage on any street railroad, car I
or Hue.
In this form the order passed without
a dissenting voice.
The ordinance ordering the clerk to ad
vertise for bids for a telephone and tele
graph franchise came up lor hnal passage,
but was put over for a week.
Sheriff Whelan sent in a protest against
the awarding of the contemplated con
tract for furnishing supplies for the jails
under his charge on the cruund that many
necessary articles had been left out of the
schedule which would have to be bought
in the open market and at a grrat loss.
The matter was referred back to the
joint Finance and Health and Tolice Com
mittee.
Two fruitless ballots on the plans for the
projected municipal building were taken.
Shea & Shea received 5 votes, Banks 4,
Mooser & Mooser 1 and Smith it Free
man 1.
Mr. Benjamin also offered a resolution
thai was carried depriving the Mayor of
the power of giving permission or free
licenses for boxing exhibitions and re
voking all of the permits now out. The
resolution places the power in tho hands
of the board.
A resolution was introduced and carried
making Branch Jail 3 instead of the City
Receiving Hospital the place of incarcera
tion of insane persons while awaiting ex
amination, and instructing Sheriff Whe
lan to expend $300 in fitting up the neces
sary rooms.

OF THE MIND,"
Dr. Derrick Lectures to the

Meeting.
FATHER YORKE'S WORDS
They Are Made the Subject of
Criticism by the A. P. A.
Speaker.
A EABBI IS TAKEN TO TASK.
Proceedings of the Y. M. I. Grand
Council the Main Theme of the
Discourse.
Despite the charms and attractions of
outdoor recreation on Sunday there was a
notable increase in the attendance at the
pood-citizenship meeting at Metropolitan
Hall over that of the Sunday previous.
After the usual preliminary sxercises M.
T. Brewer, the State secretary of the
American Protective Association, made a
few remarks on the advantages of giving
the franchise to the women of the coun
try. He declared he was in favor of a fair
ballot and an honest count, and added
that this would be more likely to come
after the women had been given the privi
lege of the ballot-box. Taking up another
vein of thought, he said :
"We have been charged with dealing in
elurs, anathemas ana slanders. Now, lam
sincere when I say that 'may my own arm
be palsied and my tongue cleave to the
roof of my mouth' if they are ever used to
defame womankind, whether that woman
kind be of the Protestant or the Catholic
faith."
Before introducing the speaker of the
day Chairman Quitzow spoke as follows:
"It has been asserted that I have said
â we have captured the Republican Conven
tion. I want to say tuat the Republican
Convention was dominated by American
ism to such an extent that we* very nearly
carried out cur ideas there. I would say
that so far as the Republican party is con
cerned it is the party of progress and ad
vancement, and if the Republican party
takes up the principles of the American
Protective Association it is bound to se
cure our votes to that extent.
"I would say further that I have been
credited with saying that we have cap
tured the Roman Catnolic Church. As
far as that statement is concerned, I am
proud to say that they are feeling the ef
fects of our forcible arguments and that
they now throw their doors wide open,
even to the remains of patriots which are
covered with the American flag."
Dr. George H. Derrick of Oakland was
introduced by Mr. Quitzow. The doctor
was a new advocate of the principles of
the American Protective Association ;o
most of the audience, but he was not long
in. getting thoroughly en rapport with his
hearers, judging from the frequent and
liear.ty applause that his remarks elicited.
His subject was "The Emancipation of
the Mind," though he was down on the
printed program me to speak on '"The Old
Idol." After reviewing the historical
events which led to the establishment of
the Government of the United States, as
he described it, '"without a king and a re
ligion without a Pope," he continued:
"As I picked up a paper a few mornings
ago my eye fell upon a statement which
seemed to me, in the light of the history
of this country, a peculiar one."
The speaker here read the statement re
ferred to. It was as follows:
"It is hard not to try in some way to up
raise the veil and see what destiny God
has reserved for this great people. There
fore, to-day, brethren of the Y. M. 1., 1
come to address to you a word on the part
which I oelieve you should play in the
years to come. It is without doubt the
mission of the Catholic church to make
this country Catholic."
Commenting on this Dr. DerncE said:
"When I read that I sadly thought to
myself what would be the feelings of those
who landed on Plymouth Hock if they
could know that, after 250 years ot earnest
labor, we had arrived at a place where it
is the avowed purpose of a great organiza
tion to mate tnis country Catholic ana
bring it back to where the worhi was when
they leit it.
"I tell you, my friends, that it may not
be the proper thine to hit that idol on tne
head, but I say that when the idol raises
its head it is time for the American people
to knock that idol down. What must be
the feelings that throb in patriotic breasts
to-day when we find such statements as
these placed before us and published in
our morning papers as being the avowed
purpose of this organization."
Quoting again from the address of
Father Yorke to the Y. M. I. Dr. Derrick
read :
"I come to speak to you, not as a mem
ber of your institute, or as a delegate to
your Grand Council, nor as a fellow
citizen to hia fellow-citizens."
Here, turning to his audience, the
Speaker remarked in a sort of an aside :
"Well, now. I wonder how this man
â was to speak." [Langhter.]
Reading once more from the newspaper
he held in his hand Dr. Derrick continued :
'â¢I speak to you as a priest of God and
as one having authority to epeas in the
name of God."
"I want to know," remarked the speaker,
"when that man stood there and said that
he spoke in the name and by the authority
ox God how much thinking they did?
There must have been an oversiopping of
ideas. There must have been a wonderful
symposium of thought when they received
that word and eiruply accepted it as the
true principle."
Taking another thought for his theme
he proceeded:
â¢'Not long ago from this very platform a
lecture was delivered by Father Yorke and
present was one of the principal rabbis of
the City, who introduced the sneaker. In
the course of his remarks this rabbi stated
that it wa3 due to the efforts of the Catho
lic church that civil and religious liberty
was ua<Je possible in this country.
"In view of the events 01 the past week
I want to ask this rabbi if he is desirous of
having his words indorsed by the thou
sands and thousands of his race in this
country; I want to ask him if he is de
sirous of reviving the persecutions of the
Jews, and if he desires to bring bacK the
period when no one dared to declare him
self to be a Jewish rabbi.
"Now, ray friends, are we prepared to
Lave the constitutions of our State and
National Government modeled on the
principles of medieval Europe? Oh, my
Jriends, may the American Protective As
sociation deliver this country from any
thing that savors of such a thing: may
the American people rise en masse and
Etc that every form of superstition is
driven away by the education wuich is im
parted to our children in the little red
Echoolhouse."
GAMBLERS ARE FOILED.
Captain Bowie* of the Steamer Colum
bia Forces Them to Yield 11l-
Got Coin.
Rome half dozen passengers on the
eteamer Columbia, which arrived from
Portland on Sunday, have Captain Bowles
to thank for saving them some $500 in
gooa hard coin.
Shortly after leaving Portland four sure
tlnng gamb.'ers made their presence felt
in various ways. Firpt they tried the shell
eame, with only fair success. This was
followed by a game of euchre, which
turned into poker after a few deals. The
combination rung in a pack of marked
cards, with the result that some $400
passed into the coffers of the sure-thing
men.
Ihe victims entered no particular prot
est, but the matter became noised over the
boat. Captain Bowles heard of the scheme,
and just before reachius this port he made
a demand on the men for the return of the
coin. The gamblers indignantly denied
that anything wrong had occurred, but
they finally returned the money under
protest. Captain Bowles determined to
have the gamblers arrested, but hardly
had the steamer touched the landing than
the four men made their escape over the
side and were soon lost in the crowd.
Incidentally it may be remarked that
the Columbia broke the record from Port
land to San Francisco by nearly two hours.
Forty-eight hours to the minute was the
time consumed in the trip down.

POPPER'S PLAIN TALK.
He Hinti at Boss Influence on the
Actions of the Election
Commissioners.
The Election Commissioners held a
somewhat heated session yesterday and
all because Max Popper in a speech in
which he advocated reforms in the man
ner of choosing election officers, and made
pointed remarks in relation to a hidden
power, which, he declared, had much to
do with the action of the Commissioners in
ihe way of choosing officials. This refer
ence to a boss was taken up by Auditor
Broderick, who indignantly denied that
he, at any rate, was bound to any boss.
Popper said that he had a scheme which
would obviate election frauds and was in
vited by the Commissioners to submit it
for their consideration.
Kegistrar Hinton announced that he
had appointed the following extra clerks
pursuant to tde instructions of the board:
P. J. Murphy, Chauncey Barber, J. M.
Norgues, P. A. Morbio, Timothy Donovan,
P. T. Big by and Joseph Goeer.

The Passing; Away of a Pioneer Lawyer
of This Coast.
Judge I). William Douthitt, a pioneer of
this State, a member of the California
Commandery, Knights Templar No. 1, and
a veteran of the Mexican "War, who died at
Colorado Springs, Colo., May 10, 1896, was
an old and respected member of this com
munity. The deceased had practiced law
in this City for thirty years, up to three
years ago, when he retired.
He was at one time District Attorney
for Portland, Or., and at various times
had been engaged in newspaper pursuits
in this State.
He was a native of Tennessee and left a
widow and four children. The interment
took place at Colorado Springs under
Masonic auspices, May 13, 1896.
ANOTHER BLANTHER SEEN
Thought to Be Traveling Near
King City as a Piano-
Tuner.
But the Police Say That He Has Gone
East by the Texas Pacific
Railroad.
Mrs. Wallace, wife of Superintendent
Wallace of the big Dunphy ranch ten
miles from King City, arrived in town
yesterday with a startling Blanther story.
She says that a man answering in all re
spects the published description of the j
suspect visited her residence last Thurs- {
day. The man wore glasses, talked with
a German accent and kept his left hand;
gloved. He claimed to be a piano-tuner, '
but never asked to loou at the piano in the j
house. He was given accommodations
foi the night and engaged himself in i
writing letters and what seemed to be a
diary. He kept out of the light of the
lamp and disappeared before daylight.
He was anxious to disclaim ail interest in
the San Francisco papers and in a gentle
manly wny evaded all inquiries. The fact
of his being gloved excited peculiar notice.
Mrs. Wallace has given full particulars
to Sheriff Mathews of Monterey County
who will investigate the matter.
â¦
THE POLICE THEORY.
They Say Blanther Did Not Go to
Mexico, but Slipped Away
East.
Josef E. Blanther, the murderer of Mrs.
Langfeldt, did not cross the border into
Mexico as was at first supposed.
Captain Lees had wired Chief of Police '
Rink at El Paso to see Conductor Rich on
his arrival there again and ascertain what
he knew about Blanther's movements.
The captain received a dispatch yesterday
from Chief Rink that Rich saw Blanther
on Tuesday, May 19, the day after he ar
rived in El Palso in a brand new suit of
clothes of brown material, light Fedora
hat and black kid gloves. The coat was a ,
frock.
At 5 p. m. that day Blanther left on the
Te^as Pacific Railroad train which went as
far east as Fort Worth, a distance of about
600 miles. If he went there he could have
gone in nearly twenty different ways.
Steamboats could carry him out of
American waters to South American or
European ports. By taking a train to the
north he could ride to Oklahoma or Indian
Territories, or he could have continued his
journey eastward and have arrived at New
York or Chicago before now. It is not
known yet how far he journeyed on the
Texas Pacific, but inquiries by telegraph
have been made on the point
Blanther will, it is thought, continue his
travels until his funds get exhausted and
then he will either do something despe
rate to replenish his exchequer or en
deavor to hide himself in some remote
corner.
Captain Lees is hard at work getting the
new circulars out, but he is meeting with
unexpected obstacles in getting them
from the printers, more particularly those
in the Spanish language. A force of men
was busily engaged all day in stamping
and addressing envelopes in readiness for
the circulars.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
SPIRITUALISTS
HAIL BARRETT.
Stirring Address by the
Spiritualists' National
President.
IS THE PRESENT AGE
INTOLERANT ?
Resolution Favoring a State
Spiritualist Association
Drafted.
TRIBUTE TO THE CONVENTION'S
SECRETARY.
It Is Decided That They Hold Three
Sessions To-Day to Finish
ths Work.
The Spiritualistic Convention opened
rather late yesterday morning, owing to
the fact that everybody was enjoying such
a good time socially that the president
Some Prominent Members of the Spiritualistic Convention Now in Session-
forgot to tap his gavel upon the desk till
nearly 11 o'clock.
President Harrison D. Barrett was im
mediately introduced to his audience
and made a classic and eloquent plea
for organization. His address, however,
was not confined entirely to the subject of
organization. During the conn>e of his
remarks he referred to a wide range of
subjects, such as the charlatan element
of the spiritualists, the status of these
bodies both in England and the United
States, and the persecutions men are now
undergoing in many States of the Union
for their religious beliefs. His words
in part were as follows:
This subject Is so large a one that I doubt if
in the limited time at my command I can do
it justice. I Fuppose, as organization is the
main object of our convention, I might us well
begin with a reference to those former con ven
| tions held for the same purpose which deter-
I mined the condition of spiritualistic bodies as
i they extst in the United States to-day.
The first was held in 1872 and '73, in thedays
! of that erratic genius, Victoria Woodhull, and
i 1 am proud and happy to be able to state that
I that association died a natural death, because
it tried to foist that most damnable of all doc
trines, free love, upon the world. [Applause.]
Then there was the Clii'-ago convention oi
j 1893. Many of the believers in the cardinal
j principles of spiritualism strenuously objected
! to this convention â said spiritualists did not
j want organization, that they were so thor
| oughly individualized that It was entirely im
practicable.
1 had ihe honor to be a delegate to that con
vention and was in addition on the committee
lof credentials. What was my surprise on go
ing into that convention on the morning of its
! inauguration to find 203 delegates, represent-
I inn in all thirty-three States. [Loud applause.]
The first question of importance to come up
! was whether or not the word "religion" should
be cast from the constitution. It caused one
of the stormiest scenes ever witnessed. Fifteen
or twenty persons were on their feet at once,
I all clamoring to be given a voice in the pro
ceedings. It was defeated by a vote of 183
to 20.
I see before me now one who passed through
all the exciting scenes of that great convention;
she who was unanimously elected as one of
the national trustees aud incorporators, ana to
; whom is largely due the success of the present
| meeting. I refer to the secretary of our meet
ing. Mrs. Elizabeth Kellogg. [Uproarious ap
plause.]
And now the question naturally arises,
Why did we go to Washington, D. C., as the
headquarters of the association? The solution
is simplicity itself, liecause there is the point
where the eyes of the Amcricau public are
i oftenest turned; there we could be closer to
| the heart of the Nation, where we could feel
; the quick pulsation of public opinion; and
! there resides the law-making power of our
country.
The last reason I hare given 'n, perhaps, the
strongest of all, because It is twofold ; not only
would we bo where we could most actively
engage in the work of influencing legislation
for the better, but as so many of the Congress
men are so impure aud corrupt of principle as
to lay the foundation of a powerful realistic
novel, to be entitled, "In Darkest Washing
ton," we have one of the most beautiful fields
for missionary labor you ever saw. [Laughter.]
"Why do we want organization?" you say.
I answer: Because in unity and co-operation
lies strength. There you have it in a nutshell.
There is no such thing as a creed in spiritual
ism, nothing whatever to give room to any
discordant element. Kven the ism of our name
was given to us by others. The time is coming
when, unlike the great philosopher of initi
quity, we are going to move the world without
a fulcrum.
There is another thing on which I wish to
speakâ the protection of our mediums. You
say they have got perfect rights under the
! laws of tho different Stages. Dear friends, two
years ago 1 received a telegram, whica read as
follows:
"Come at once. I am under arrest. Waste
no time in granting vat: this favor."
I went and I found that that man had been
arrested for carrying on a spiritualistic meet
ing. Do you call this a free country when men
like our persecuted Adventist brethren of
Georgia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Alabama
are put into prisons right along because they
work on Sunday? .Ladies ana gentlemen, we
must fight these things. They Lave no place
in a free country.
If we are strongly organized we can down
these abuses and persecutions. Let us put
men on the platform who understand the
prooer use of the English language, not verbal
clodhoppers whose words stumble over their
own tongues. We want such men as will be
looked on as representatives, like Theodore
Parker of the Unitarians, Talmage of the
Presbyterians, Spurgeon, Wilson and let me
not forget grand old Danton of our own belief.
Another thing in which we want to take a
more active Interest is the subject of alms
houses and hospitals for aged and indigent
members of our own persuasion. Many of the
grandest old fighters of our faith are now de
pendent upon the of a cold, hard world.
We ought to provide the comforts of life to
them in their autumn of life and place them
where they can receive the benefits of magnetic
healing and other modes of treatment peculiar
tons. Lyceums for children would also come
under the head of institutions we should es
tablish.
Aud now let me end my address to you this
morning with a denial of the fsct that I and
other ollicers of this great National association
are getting rich. I have delivered 123 ad
dresses since January 1, and to-day am in debt
on account of a former illness. Other officers
have worked as hard as 1 and are no better off.
My desire is not to grow wealthy, but to see us
grow richer in knowledge and experience; to
sec the dsy when our armor will be so invul
nerable that the thunderbolts of orthodoxy
will glide harmlessly off and leave us in hap
piness and peace.
The conclusion of the president's speech
was attended by the most boisterous en
thusiasm. As he took his seat those who
occupied the seats of honor with him on
tne platform crowded round to congratu
late him. The whole house was in a buzz
of excitement.
Quiet was finally restored by W. D. J.
Ham bley. a delegate irom the First Spir
itual Union of San Jose, who obtained the
floor and asked the president if be were in
favor of forming State societies.
"Yes," was the answer, "I am; but un
til they are formed I am in favor of your
seeking protection by coining into the Na
tional body."
Various remarks on the subject of or
ganization were made by the delegate?,
and then President Barrett rose and said
he was just in receipt of a letter by special
delivery from the National association.
He then read the communication to the
assembled delegates. The following is a
copy
Washington, D. C, May 20, 1896.
To the Spiritualist* of California, Greeting:
The National Association sends fraternal greet
ings.
The great need of the home Is harmony and
union. May there be no North, Sonth, East or
West in the spiritual vineyard, but shoulder to
shoulder the grand army of progression march
on to victory. The time has come for united <
action. California spiritualists, representa
tives of a great, liberty-loving people, will, I
am sure, unite to speed ihe day when the
Clem shall not dictate what laws legislators
(-hall enai:t; when churcn property shall be
taxed, and Sunday, the people's day, not made
holy by law; when mediums shall neither be
arrested nor taxed because they have been en
dowed with gifts by nature; when we shall
once more have the right to enter spirit life
free trom the effects of drugs j>re
s.'ritÂ»ed by regulated and protected quacks:
when "gods" will not, through their
appointed representatives, become so small
ami so much to de-ire temporal power as to
wish to be placed in the constitution of the
United States.
California is on record at this office ns
against God in the constitution. May Califor
nia assist us at once in this age of reason to
write, if need be, a new Declaration of Inde
pendence, thus promulgating the true rights
of man â and woman, too.
Francis B. Woodbcry. Secretary H. S. A.
J. J. Morse, the official lecturer of the
Psychical Research Society of this City,
was then introduced by the president and
spoke of the affairs of spiritualism in
Great Britain. He also referred to the Ly
ceum Banner, a spiritualistic periodical
for children, which, he said, was the only
paper of the kind in the world.
"I am editor of this children's sheet,"
lie added, "but in my absence the cares of
that position devolve uuon my daughter,
Florence."
Much of his speech was devoted to the
establishment of ly^eums for the children
of believers. In conclusion he said:
"They tell me that porous plasters are
good for weak backs. What we want to do
is to put spiritual porous plasters on our
backs and go in to conquer the world."
A motion was here carried to adjourn,
and a recess was taken until the afternoon.
AFTERNOON SESSION.
Resolution for Organization and
Some Interesting
Papers.
As soon as the body had convened in
the afternoon J. J. Morse of Ban Jose rose
ana presented a resolution for organiza
â¢ tion.
A paper was presented by John Brown,
"the medium of tho Rockies," who is so
â  aged that his eyes would not permit his
i reading it himself. The burden of the
i article was to the effect that the spirits
! had been telling him for years that such a
convention, for the purpose of organiza
tion, should be held in California.
Several persons then followed with brief
speeches on the same subject. The presi
dent of the National Association also gave
a few words of advice as to how they
I should go to work to accomplish the de
sired end.
It was decided that no final adjourn
ment be taken until this evening, and a
fresh committee on the subject of organi
zation was appointed to take action on the
foregoing resolution. An adjournment
was then taken till evening.
EVENING SESSION.
For Devotion to Duty Mrs. Sloper
Is Presented With an
Emblem.
The evening session was opened with an
overture by Professor Young's orchestra,
after which the local president, William
Ryder, stepped to the front and introduced
Mrs. J. J. Whitney.
Said Mrs. Whitney: "When my sister in
the noble religion of spiritualism, Mrs.
Elizabeth Sloper, came to me and told me
Children Crvfor Pitcher's Caetoria.
that we were going to hold a grand con
vention here for the purpose of organiza
tion I was surprised beyond measure.
"We have decided that, in view of the
strenuous and unselbsh endeavors that i
our sister has put forth in our behalf, we
shall present her with this token of our es
teem, a oeautiful jewel in the shape of a
Maltese cross, with our emblematic flower
upon it."
Here Mrs. Whitney stepped forward to
where Mra. Sloper sat and in a pretty
little speech presented her with the jewel.
"Friends and fellow-spiritualists." said
Mrs. Sloper, in acknowledgment, "this is
one of the proudest and happiest moments
of my life, and I feel bound to say that the
realization of my unwortb and the small
amount of labor I have expended in the
affair does not in any great degree detract
from my happiness.
"My whole desire in this world is to see
our grand and true religion grow to be rec
ognised of all men as the noble fabric it
really is."
President Barrett then spofce briefly, end
ing with introducing J. J. Morse, the pres
ident of the San Francisco Psychical So
ciety.
The latter read a resolution recom
mended by the committee of which he
was chairman thanking everybody for hia
efforts in behalf of the convention and
the press for their liberality in publishing
news.
Now came the great feature of the pro
grammeâJohn Slater in tests. He was
called forth from the audience by Presi
dent Kyder, and as he stepped upon the
platform there was an expectant hush.
"I am not here to-night to gull any
body," he began, ''and before you leave
this hall you will all agree with me. Re
memLer. 1 my you will, for I intend to
make you believe.
"These things oftentimes occur to you â
these phenomena 1 am going to bring be
fore you, and you oftentimes wonder why
they are."
Tn en Slater stood very still, with his
eyes closed in a dreamy manner, and sud
denly opening them began to speak rapidly
and to describe aomethinc that had taken
place in the life of some one present dur
ing the day. \Vhen be asked that man if
these things had happened the man, in
what seemed a rather reluctant manner,
admitted that it was so.
He then went through many of these
circumstances.
After several short speeches the session
came to a close by the singing of "Ameri
ca." It was stated that to-day William
Emmette Coleman may be on hand.
During the progress of the evening a
very pleasing allusion was made to Joan
Rodes Buchanan, the gray-haired octo
genarian, who poses almost as a patriarch
of the cult.
THE NATION'S BIRTHDAY,
Committees Named to Have
Charge of the Cele
bration.
A Proposition to Combine the Day of
Independence With the
Carnival.
Eighteen members of the executive com
mittee of the Fourth of July committee on
celebration answered rohcall yesterday on
being called to order by Chairman Charles
J. King.
S, L. Lunt, president of the day, called
upon the members to use their best
energies to make the celebration a
success.
Chairman King stated that he had at his
request called on General Wartield, who
had suggested that the committee do all
in its power to have the grandest military
display on the Fourth and suggested that
General Moeller would probably bring up
tho Third Brigade pending trie committee
could raise $ 4500 for transportation. Before
the meeting adjourned Chairman King
received a dispatch announcing that the
Third could not be brought to San Fran
citco.
The secretary read the following list of

Truman, Captain Margo, G. H. Umbsen
and C. P. L. Mai ait were named a commit
tee to confer with the fiesta committee.
W. A. C. Smith was elected assistant

was decided that if a second assistant is
needed W. J. Rightmier will be chosen.
On motion of Samuel Foster, Dr. George
L. Fitch voting in the negative, the chair
men of the committees were empowered to
add ladies to each committee, the nom
inations to be subject to the approval of
the executive committee.
The executive committee will hereafter
meet every Monday night.
CAPTAIN SMITH'S DEATH.
Evidence That He Committed Suicide
Obtained by the Coroner.
It has been ascertained that Captain A.
W. Smith, wha died at 807J4 Golden Gate
avenue on May 21, committed suicide,
though it was supposed he was the victim
of opium poisoning.
Dr. Samuel Hall signed a death cer
tificate and took it to the Board of Health,
but it was refused. Coroner Hawkins will
hold an inquest next Friday.
He has discovered two important wit
nesses â T. Harder, ft saloon-keeper at 7
Market street, and F. Hnber of Alameda,
to whom Captain Smith remarked in Har
der's saloon the day before his death that
he proposed to commit suicide because of
family troubles. _
Tried to Choke Hla Wife.
Mrs. Agnes Bourke, wife of Herman Bourke,
1336 Alabama street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Campbell's court yesterday charging
her husband with battery. She said that on
Saturday night he threw a rope round her neck
and tried to cnoke her. Then he struck her to
the face. His reason for doing so was because
she had refused to turn over her property in
him, including the bouse in which they lived.

The Power
of Manhood.
WHEN YOU LOSE THAT
power you have lost all
the best of life. There is a
charm gone from your exist-
ence, and you miss it more than
anything else.
But when, you regain it after
years of incapacity your heart
will leap with joy â then the
bright spirit will shine forth in
your eye, and the happy smile
in your countenance will tell
your acquaintances that you
have found a new existence.
Then you meet your friends
with the strong clasp of the
hand and the look of confidence
which tell them that "here is
the new-born man."
Your every action bespeaks
new manhood. You are then a
better man physically and men-
tally than if you had never
known weakness.
"You can say that I wns
nearly a wreck in every way,
but I am now a better man than
I ever thought of being," says
L. L. Jaccard, the Jeweler, of
San Leandro, Cal., after using
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
Some men feel that they are
not weak, though they are not :
what they might be in manly
vigor had they not lightly trans- !
gressed the laws of Nature. !
These are just the ones who !
most appreciate the value of Dr. !
Sanden's Belt. In a few weeks
they learn that it can make them
twice as strong as they were.
"Before I began using your j
{Belt I thought there was not
much the matter with me, but
after using it a month I have
found the value of good health,"
says Wm. Simpson, Goleta, Cal.
Electricity is wonderful in its
strengthening influence. Your
vitality seems to grow stronger
and more buoyant every day.
There seems no limit to your
energies. You can do twice the
amount of work you formerly
could, and not get weary.
"I can do as much work as
any two men now," says L.
C. Minzard, Napa, Gal.
Words cannot tell of the full-
some gratitude felt by the men
who have been restored to man-
hood by Dr. Sanden's Electric
âºBelt. Will you become one of
its happy patients? You can
learn how great has been its
good work by reading the little
book, "Three Classes of Men,"
which Dr. Sanden will send you
free, closely sealed, on request.

WAR ON FRANK
GOULD HAS BEGUN,
Not Likely to Be Chairman
of the Democratic
Convention.
A BOOM FOR W. T. JETER.
Gould's Partnership With Mc-
Nab, Daggett and Sam
Rainey.
JAMES H. O'BRIEN'S REMARKS.
The Busy Federal Brigade, Anxious
Jim Budd and Braunhart's
New Warpath.
Talk about the chairmanship of the
Democratic State Convention increases as
June 16 nears, and with it develops
steadily the strong probability that the
chairman will be some Democrat other
than Frank Gould of Stockton, the present
chairman of the State Central Committee.
Gould's strength, his chairmanship
boom and his political prosTpeeti generally
depend mainly on John Daggett and Gavin
McNab, his political partners. This in
teresting firm figures on controlling the '
convention and the new State Central
Committee as far as possible. Dageett.
mainly through his pationage power, will !
control many delegates to the convention j
and a number of party workers. He will j
have a considerable scattering strength I
over the State, and, with McNab, will |
absolutely control the Junta delegation '
from tbis City for gold, for the administra- j
tion and for the local machine. That is
what he puts in.
IfcNab has an extremely small personal |
following, but he controls the Junta ma- :
chine, which is composed of a few small
politicians.
Gould, likewise, has no considerable |
measure of influence or popularity in the i
party, but he is chairman of the State
Central Committee. As such he cracked j
through the McNab programme at the
last meeting of the State Central Commit- '
tee, and as juch he is counted on to place j
the Junta delegation on the temporary j
roll and otherwise assist the McNab-Dag
gett programme in the convention.
Gould's candidacy for the convention
chairmanship has thus sprung from his
partnership with Dasrgett and McNab, and ;
these partners have furnished whatever j
momentum it has acquired.
But Democrats generally do not serious- j
ly thinK that Gould will get the chairman- j
ship, and they think that when the time i
comes some weightier Democrat will be j
asked to preside over the important party
gathering.
Lieutenant-Governor W. T. Jeter is the '
only man now prominently mentioned
since W. W. Foote refused to be a candi- i
date, because he wanted to be a delegate- '
at-large to Chicago. Quite a boom for
Jeter has begun to develop throughout t c j
State, and his mentis are pointing at his i
iong and clean record in State politics, his
popularity and his fitness for the place at
a time when an able and a broad and fair
minded mac ia needed.
Gould is the candidate of the Junta, but
he is being bitterly opposed by the Buck- j
leyites in tbe City and sniffed at by the !
Democratic politicians of the interior.
Remarks by James H. O'Brien yesterday
were typical of the anti-Gould estimate of
Gould.
"What earthly reason can be given i
why Gould should be Honored with the
chairmanship of the State Convention?"
said Mr. O'Brien. "What claim has he on
the party? And who is Gould anyway?
He is a" little Stockton lawyer who was
made Speaker of the Assembly once, and
then he was made chairman of the State
Central Committee by Bndd because he was
a Stockton man and Budd's friend. The
party didn't make him a leader. Then
what has Gould done for the party? He
was a failure as director of the campaign.
He let things go, and Budd cussed him |
all through the campaign, and took hold '
of his campaign himself with tbe assist- j
ance of some experienced men who were
appointed on that 'advisory committee.'
He and Budd quarreled over the A. P. A.,
and half the party believes that he and Mc-
JS'ab are half A. P. A.'s.
"Gould is a iinle, narrow-minded up- j
start who is standing in to run things with
Daggett and McNab. The Federal brigade
needs him to force through if possible the
administration and gold programme to -
which the mass of the party is opposed.
Does it appear likely that the party will
make such a man chairman of the State
convention and let him appoint the execu
tive committee to run the campaign in the
interests of two or three wouid-be bosses
like McNab and Dasgett and in the inter
est of a minority faction? He is especially
offensive of course to the Democrats of
San Francisco, who are not in favor of the
local party being given into the control of
Gavin McNab, the Federal brigade and
Sam Rainey. He has already committed
himself in the local contest and is the hot
partisan of one faction with which he is in
partnership. We want to see a fair-minded
man worthy of the place made the chair
man and any man of that sort will satis
fy us."
The extent to -which Daggett, Rainey
and McNab have gained control of the
Junta delegation to the State Convention
has surprised nnd disgusted a majority of
the members and active workers in that
general committee. The prnnarv will be
held next Saturday night, but as in fifteen
of the districts the nominees will surely
be the delegates the complexion of the
delegation is now known.
There will be 108 district delegates
elected, and of these the DaKgett-McNab-
Rainey combination have at least 90. The
contests in three districts will give them
more. On Monday the campaign com
mittee will nominate 58 at large, and the
combination will have at least 40 of these,
giving it more than 130 of the 161 dele
gates, through McNab's clever manipula
tions.
Besides these delegates directly con
trolled by Daggett, Rainey and McNab,
others through influences emanating from
Welburn, Wise and others of the Federal
brigade, will support the gold programme.
The Federal officials throughout the State
are using the force of their positions and
patronage powers to elect delegates and
secure proxies that the Cleveland adminis
tration may be served. If the gold men
are unable to control the convention,
declare for "sound money" and elect a
Chicago delegation that will stand up for
the administration they hope at least to
temper the results in those directions.
The strength of the gold element in the
convention will be greater than it is in the
party through the operations of the
Federal machine, but it does not appear at
ali likely that it will approach a majority.
In this situation the local contest becomes
of StatÂ« importance, as it means 101 votes
for either gold or tllver according to the
disposition of the contest and the gold
men have the machinery which will place
the gold deleeation on tne temporary roll.
Governor Budd is getting greatly inter
ested in the schemes and programmes that
are being batched for the State Conven
tion. He has an eye on another term.
He ia hob-nobbing and exchanging shoul
der-slaps with Bockleyites, McNabers and
the boys generally. He is "leery' of that
scheme of McNab, Daggett and Gould to
yet hold of the State machine for use two
years hence. Among politicians these
three are understood to be quite ready to
rip open Jim's ambition with a knife when
the time shall come and leave it to putrefy
in the tules.
tiould's deep sores were not healed when
Budd a few weeks ago threw him his first
morsel of recognition by making him a di
rector of the Agnews Insane Asylum.
McNab is outwardly friendly to Bndd, but
he Las received nothing from him during
all of the Democratic depopulation of
Stockton, and is known to cherish mixed
feelings about the chief magistrate ol his
adopted State.
When J'eter McGlade, not so long ago,
was after the chief clerkship at the Regis
trar's office, which he got, McNab tele
phoned to Budd at Sacramento protesting
nnd imploring that Peter be turned down.
His answer was McGiade's appointment.
McNab's hostility to McGiade, by the
way, began during the last campaign,
when the latter was running for (-lerk of
the Supreme Court. He refused to put
his assessment into Gould's hands, it is
currently told, on tlie ground that he
didn't propose to put any of his good
money into the hands of A. P. A.'s, re
ferring to McNab and Gould.
Daggett's heart sliehtly cbills, too, when
Bnda is around, so that the Governor is
not enthusiastic in support of McNab,
Daggett, Kainey and "clean politics."
Ihere can be no doubt that Budd will be
indorsed in some sort of a way by the State
Convention. That will not o'e because
there is no horde of hungry and disap
pointed politicians in the convention hall
aching to tiit him with a club, but because
it is rather a party necessity, and because
the kickers are chietiv Kicking about the
way Budd has dispensed and not dis
pensed patronage. It won't look well to
carry such grievances into a State conven
tion, and, though Buda's indorsement will
meet opposition, most of the politicians
will let it go through and cuss during
recess.
Samuel Braunhart is cutting quite a
little ligure now and getting talked about.
He is at war against McNab and Chair
man Sullivan. These gentlemen treat him
in his presence with patronizing good
nature, as if he didn't amount to much,
and have smiles and gibes for his back.
Braunhart is disgusted et the triumph
j of Daggett, Rainey and McNab, which Mc-
I Nab nnd Sullivan have brought about, and
j he is inclined to rebel. Braunhart is sin
| cerely and uncompromisingly opposed to
I both Buckley and Rainev, and has until
recently believed tnat McNab and Sulli
vnn were also. He and Max Popper have
both sickened recently at the programme
McNab has developed.
Braunhart is suspicious of McNab'sgreat
organization scheme, and knows that if
M< Nab should secure control of the local
machine he would be "dumped." Then
Braunhart is a stanch silver man in the
middle of a gold camp. He has a record
00 silver, made at previous State conven
tions, and that is another reason why he is
becoming anti-McNab. A number of the
members of the campaign committee are
ranged with him in rebellion against Mc-
Nab's domination.
Braunuart and Chairman Sullivan had
an open quarrel at headquarters the other
night, and it is much talked about among
afew. It wasover John Cunningham, who
as Chairman Sullivan's personal political
adviser and general utility man has be
come assistant secretary by Sullivan's
direction.
Mr. Cunningham was long a secretary
and confidential agent of Chiis Buckley
jii the days of the latter's power, and his
wide acquaintance with the men, ways
and things of local politics makes him es
specially valuable to his old personal
friend, Mr. Sullivan, wi.o has newly en
tered the political arena. So for some
time Mr. Cunningham has been a popular
and important man at the wheel.
But between Messrs. Cunningham and
Braunhart tnere arose an antagonism
which grew until an explosion came the
other night and Braunhart declared war
by demanding of Sullivan that the head
quarters be cleared of Cunningham.
Braunhart fired all his guns, hut Sullivan
tired bacK and stood valiantly by bis
friend Cunningham, who is still at "head
quarters, throughout each evening. And
Braunhart swears each day and night.
Braunhart is especially sore at Sullivan
because he "discovered" Sullivan politi
cally. Sullivan was just a member of tbe
forgotten Deuprey committee when Mc-
Nab, Braunhart, Rainey and others re
suscitated it last fall, and he had never
been a chairman or anything, only colonel
of the First Regiment. Braunhart sug
gested him for a convenient chairman,
and then he naturally rose to be chairman
of the part of the General Committee that
split on at Metropolitan Temple. Then
Braunhart got the marble face from the
chairman, and he spells It the same as he
does "ingratitude."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
DUPING ITALIANS
BY A NEW SCHEME,
Paul Roera Arrested for
Swindling Through
the Mails.
"OWNED" WAREHOUSES.
Victims Led to Believe That
Packages Had Come From
the Old Country.
PROMPTED BY ANOTHER MAN.
Roera Claims He Wrote the Fraudu
lent Letters at the Instigation
of an Unknown.
Faal Roera, a lad of 19 years, is in tbe
County Jail charged with using the mails
for fraudulent purposes. The accused was
arrested Friday, but the matter was kept
secret until yesterday in the hope that the
story he had told Inspector Erwin could be
verified.
iiacK of the simple announcement of
Roera's trouble lies possibly a gigantic
scheme to defraud the ignorant as well as
the wise, in wnich the accused youth ap
pears to be but a figurehead. That is pre
suming the story told by him is true.
For some weeks past prominent Italians
in the small cities conveniently near San
Francisco have been flooded with docu
ments purporting to be from Paul Roera,
proprietor of several warehouses in this
City. The recipients of these letters were
informed that the last ship from Italy
brought a package for them, which could
be obtained by the payment of $3, $5 or $10,
according to the linancial standing of the
selected victim.
Just how often this scheme was worked
Inspector Erwin does not know, L>..t that
it yielded banasomely for the small
amount involved there is not the slightest
doubt. In any event the scheme might
have been carried on indefinitely but for
the action of a well known Italian citizen
of Hillsdale. He received a letter from
Roera similar in tone and character to
those already described. Instead of for
warding the coin asked for he Bent the
communication to tbe postal authorities
here, with the request that they look into
tbe matter.
The case was placed in the hands of In
spector Erwin, and in a short time Roera
was under arrest. He admitted bavine
wiitten the letter to the Hillsdale citizen,
but declared his utter ignorance of tbe
contents. He claimed not to be able to
write English, but had simply acted as a
copying machine in this and other in
stances.
Roera was not able to give the name and
address of his alleged accomolice, but
added the startling information that when
he indited the unlawful epistle he was
laboring under the impression that it was
an anarchist document. Inspector Erwin
made a faithful search for Roera's friend,
but so far has been unable to locate him.
He is now inclined to think that the young
Italian is better versed in English than be
would have the servants of the law believe.
However, he has one or two men still on
the lookout, in the hope that something
may turn up.
Roera will have his preliminary hearing
before Commissioner Heacock to-day.
RICHMOND'S PROGRESS,
It Will Take a New Start
When the Racetrack
Goes.
Plans for Grading, Paving and
Straightening the Streets
and Avenues.
I
residents of the Richmond district
are somewhat crestfallen over the big
splurge made by their neighbors across
Golden Gate Park on the Sunnyside
section, where Seventh avenue is about to
be constructed into an elegant bou'evard.
This little jealousy of neighborly rivalry
will, however, soon blow over, and the
Richmond people will talce on a renewed
burst of progress. They will have
avenues by the dozen leading into the
park from the north side as soon as the
old racecourse is transformed into streets,
avenues and building lots.
The presence of this racecourse has
been â so it is claimed by tbe residents â a
black eye to the advancement of the ad
jacent property. But now that it is
doomed to go the spirit as well as the
financial expectations of those people
have risen several degrees, and the
soutb-side-of-the-park people will have
the smile on the other side of tbeir faces
before long.
Even as it is tbe Richmond folks are
going along with a steady march. Several
neat and commodious residences can be
seen on either side of Sacramento street,
between Central and First avenues. In
addition to these buildings Walnut street,
between California and Sacramento, is
being graded preparatory to receiving a
coat of macadam and granite curbs and
sidewalks; similar treatment is in store
for Locust street, from Clay to Sacramento.
This improvement will open the property
for sale, and no doubt in the course of a
few months both streets will be orna
mented with handsome buildings.
On Point Lobos avenue, from Central to
Masonic, the ugly hump that projected on
the south side, where the ancient steam
dummy used to take passengers from the
Geary-street cars, is being removed, and
the street and sidewalk lines are being run
straight along. The Catholic Cemetery
line will be bulkheaded up to conform to
the wall already built on a portion of that
property.
A Case of Mayhem.
Harry Edwards, a recent arrival from Sacra
meuto, got into an altercation Sunday night
in the Rottedale House, 319 Ellis street, with
Washington King, a colored jockey. King
drew a knife and attempted to stab Edwards -
but the latter disarmed him and King bit two
pieces out of his arm. Edwards went to the
Receiving Hospital yesterday afternoon and
had his arm dressed. He said he would swear
out a warrant for King's arrest on tne charge
of mayhem.
Too Much Red Pepper.
Mrs. Mary Edmunson, 2 Midway street,
North Beach, swore to a complaint in Judge
Low's court yesterday for the arrest of Mrs.
Moose r and Maggie Gardner, two of her
neighbors, on tbe charge of battery. She said
that on Saturday night they got her into Mrs.
Mooscr's house and after beating her threw
cayenne pepper all over her clothes.

Ca.2tt SOUTH EIGHTH ST.. PHILADaI.PaTPAYS IN SILVER
AND HOARDS GOLD,
Sir Henry Dering's Opinion
of Present Mexican
Prosperity.
HER GOOD GOVERNMENT
England's Minister to Mexico
Is Now Visiting This
City.
SEEKS HEALTH AND PLEASURE
A Tribute to the Administration of
Diazâ Filled Many High Posts
Over the Worid.
Sir Henry Dering, Bart., British Min
ister to Mexico, Lady Dering, Mrs. Ca
niacho, wife of the Mayor of the City of
Mr Henry Dering, Bart., Minister From Great Brltan to -Mexico, Who Is at the
Palace.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
Mexico, and "W. A. Derm?, arrived here
yesterday and are at the Palace.
They camÂ© by rail from the City of
Mexico, the post of the distinguished Eng
lish gentleman. Sir Henry is a large man,
with dark hair, a brownish beard tapering
toward a point, and with a large nose.
Ue is a very pleasant, affable gentleman.
Sir Henry has neld many posts of great
distinction prior to going to Mexico, a
a year and a half ago. He has been thirty
eix years the representative of his country
in foreijm lands. He has been in Bulgaria,
at Rome and St. Petersburg as Minister
of Great Britain and charge d'affaires.
"I have been about eighteen months in
Mexico now," said Sir Henry, "without
any change of climate. That is a good
while to stay, especially as the altitude |Â«
about 6000 feet. lam in California for a
change, especially as I have had a serious
attack of inflammatory rheumatism which
forces me to Keep my arm in a eiine.
"My purpose is to remain here some
time, probably several weeks. I will go to
Monterev and will visit other places of in
terest. It is not my purpose to go East.
This is the first time I have been in this
country.
"Mexico is very prosperous. One reason
is tbat it has honest men at the head of
the Government. President Diaz is also
exceedingly able as well as honest. I think
the present administration will undoubt
edly be continued for the next four years.
"Another very capable man is Minister
of Finance Limantour. He is a man of
vast wealth. He owns large property in
terests in San Francisco, as you doubtless
know. With such men there is no in
centive to be anything than honest. The
result is that Mexico is splendidly gov
erned.
"The Minister of the Interior. General
Cosio, and General Mena, tue Minister of
Transportation and Communications, arc
also lull of energy and are effecting much
good for the country.
"Business is good down there. It could
not be otherwise when the purchasing
power of the dollar is considered. All
their wages are paid in silver and the prod
uce going abroad is paid for in gold. No
wonder the country is prosperous, it will
continue to be bo, too.
"Mexico has always had silver money,
and the way she gives silver and takes gold
gives her a natural protection. It is the
very beet protection, too, that a country
could have. Wouldn't such a policy be
good for any country? Yes, I think it
would, especially if it could be carried out
v." successfully as in Mexico.
"It hÂ«s been very dry in Mexico lately.
There have been no rains, and it was so
hot on the way up and through Arizona
and California that we couldn't at any
time keep the car under 96 degrees."
Kir Henry said he had intended being
W present at the banquet last night in honor
T of the Queen's birthday, but hi 3 trying 1
trip, combined will* his rheumatism, 1
would likely prevent it, much to his re
gret.
STREETS RENUMBERED.
The Mission at I,aÂ«t Hat a Rational
System of Identifying Houses.
The houses on the cross streets in the
Mission are being renumbered. This is
noi the first time a change has been made
in the numbering of houses on the streets
running east and west. In fact, there
have been so many changes that the num
bers on many of the cross streets have be
come hopelessly mixed.
Sixteenth street has long been a night
mare to people trying to find numbers,
and even the oldest inhabitant occasion
ally gets confused as he wand rs from
number 20i at one end of the block to
number 3041 at the other end.
Seventeenth and EiÂ«nteenth streets are
almost as bad, especially where they reach
Eureka Valley. Twenty-first-street num
bers have been changed three times in as
many years.
By the latest change, however, it is
hoped that everything will be remedied.
Tne new numbers beuin at the bay shore
and run continuously toward the west,
across the Potrero hill and on up toward
Twin Peaks. East of Potrero avenue there
are about five streets for every four west of
the avenue. Every fourth street, how
everâSixteenth, Twentieth and Twenty
fourth streets â run clear through. In tiie
streets between these there is a break at
Potrero avenue, but the numbers begin at
the bay, just as on the through streets.
The change of the old numbers to the new
is being made on nearly all the houses,
and as there never has been any trouble
with the numbering of the streets running
north and south, it is hoped that the Mis
sion has at last a rational system of iden
tification, and that the maledictions of be
lated novae-hunters, vainly seeking a de
sired number, will cease to be heard within
the peaceful contines of the Mission.
AFTER MUNICIPAL FUNDS
Board of Health to Enlist Busi
ness Men in a Fight for
Power.
A Downtown Meeting To-Day With
Lively Opposition From Board
of Supervisors.
The Board of Health has arranged a lit
tle meeting for this afternoon that may
result in an open display of hostilities be
tween itself and the Board of Supervisors.
For some time past thesn two municipal
bodies have been eying each other
askance, while trouble has been brewing
all the while.
Simply stated, the Board of Haa lth
wants more power and more money to
disburse for the work under its charge,
and the Board of Supervisors controls the
situation and guards the City funds
against what is styled an effort to lavish
political patronage upon tha friends of th c
power that stands behind the medical
men.
The Board of Health has quietly pre
pared to make a strategic move and enlist
the sympathies of downtown business
men. The members have secured the
Chamber of Commerce rooms for this
afternoon at 3 o'clock. And when all the
specially invited guests are assembled and
tie opposition and the neutrals have
gathered in anticipation of an interesting
time then wiil the insufficiency of appro
priations be presented with preconceived
eloquence, 'me small, tiie meager, the
parsimonious allowance for an effective
campaign against the encroachment of
disease upon the City will stir up local
pride, and the fear of personal danger
lurking in defective sewers, impure milk
and tainted meats.
Business men will be made to see the
danger to life and health incident to adul
terated food and bad sanitation, and when
the iron is hot the Board of Health will
strike and a powerful commercial element
wiil be welded into the rod that will orobe
into filth and pry away the screens that
hide unsanitary conditions and the secrets
of unhealthful foods.
On the other hand some of the Board of
Supervisors will be there, but not as silent
auditors to so direct an imputation against
their own motives in the past. Acting
Mayor Taylor will be on hand with less
eloquence, but wiih some very pointed
assertions. He will refer to the recent re
moval of Superintendent Weaver from the
Almshouse and the substitution by the
Jioard of Health of Mr. Keddy, a triend of
Governor Budd, by whom the Board of
Health was appointed. He will suggest
that this move on the part of the Board of
Health is prompted by a desire to lay
bands upon the municipal funds in order
to increase tue number of men to be re
warded for past political favors, and he
will roint to the fact that five years ago
the City and County Hospital attended to
more patients than it does to-day, though
the employes appointed by the Board of
Health have greatly increased in number.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
TWO CITIES WANT
A CONVENTION,
Oakland and San Francisco
Presbyterians Are
Aroused.
BOTH GIVE INVITATIONS
To Secure the General Presby
terian Assembly for May
i, 1897.
ACCEPT ALL THE CONDITIONS
Hospitab'.e Telegrams Are Dispatched
at Once From Both Sides of
the Bay.
This City and Oakland both extended
invitations yesterday to the General As
sembly of the Presbyterian Church now
meeting at Saratoga, N. V., to come to the
Pacific Coast in May, 1897. It is almost cer
tain that one of the two cities will secure
the assembly, and the weight of ministe
rial opinion yesterday was in favor of San
Francisco.
The General Assembly is the supreme
court, bo to speak, of the Presbyterian
church in the United States. It has never
yet convened in California, though efforts
have frequently been made to secure it,
and there is great rejoicing among Presby
terians that next year will see it here for
the lirst time.
No canvassing has been done this year
at Saratoga to secure the convention and
it was rather a surprise to Rev. Dr. J.
Hemphill of Calvary Church, Rev. R. F.
Farrand and Rev. J. dimming Smith to
receive telegrams from Rev. Dr. Mathena,
the delegate from the San Francisco Pres
bytery to Saratoga, stating that the Gen
eral Assembly of at least 600 delegates
would meet here in May, next year, if the
local Presbyterians would pledge them
selves to entertain 20u of the delegates.
Dr. Hemphill's telegram stated that the
General Assembly would prefer to con
vene in Calvary Church.
Dr. Coyle of the First Presbyterian
Cnurch, Oakland, received a telegram
from the Oakland delegates at Saratoca,
stating the same conditions about enter
taining the delegates and suggestingtli.it
if they were complied with Oakland would
very likely get tne General Assembly.
Neither the Presbyterians of San Fran
cisco nor of Oakland lost any time about
seeding to secure the assembly. Dr. Covle
telegraphed back yesterday mat nia church
would be responsible for the entertaining,
and the San Francisco Presbytery, which
held a meeting at Calvary yesterday after
noon, adop.ed a teleerara inviting the
body to meet in that church.
Dr. Hemphill was so lull of enthusiasm
that he offered to go out and collect half
the $5000. which will probably be needed
to entertain the delegates, if Rev. Dr.
Mackenzie would do likewise and raise
the other half. Dr. Mackenzie said that
he preferred not to pledge himself to col
lect any fixed amount, but he placed all
bi9 zeal at the disposition of the San
Francisco Presbytery to raise what he
could. The convention would not be only
of interest to people in religious circles, he
said, but hotel men, business men and
railroad men would all profit, and he
thought they as well as the press would
help the General Assembly alon;;.
Dr. Hemphill thought there would he no
difficulty about funds. Rev. Dr. Scott
believed that no o.ne man or church should
be made responsible, but that Presbyte
HEW TO-DAY.

Dr. Bevier said it would be a fine thing for
the City and that he believed in making
â¢ every one, including Mayor Sutro, give.
The consensus of opinions expressed was
that there would be no difficulty about
raising the necessary funds. Rev. F. R.
Farrand, the moderator, said, "We have
not soueht this. It has in a way been
thrust upon us."
It was finally resolved to extend the mi
i vitation to the general clerk of the Gen
eral Assembly, Rev. Dr. W. H. Roberts,
of Philadelphia, who Dr. Hemphill said
to be strongly in favor of convening next
year in San Francisco. The following
telegram was adopted and handed to Rev.
J. E. Scott to dispatch:
"Calvary's invitation to the assembly
heartily indorsed by presbyter-, wiih guar
antee of entertainment for 200 commis
sioners."
The following ministersand laymen were
appointed a committee on finances and ar

An area of nigh pressure which appeared off the

the Pacific slope. The t mpera'ure has risen in
the past twenty-four hours about 10 degrees along

Financial.
NF.W YORK, N. V., May 26.â Trading at the
Stock Exchange Is largely of a professional charac
ter. To-day the room-traders and the leading
operators active in the market were of a bearish
turn of mind. The engagement of $1,550,000 gold
for shipment by to-morrow's steamer, the belief
that fully $4,000,000 will be forwarded this week
and the small earning of St. Paul were all factors
in the market. The falling off in the earnings of
St. Paul and the light movement of coin were dis
appointing to the bulls. The fact that commission
houses ;were without orders for outside account
made it easy for the bears to bring about a lower
ranee of values. London houses did nothing, it
being a holiday.
Foreign bankers generally were of the opinion
that the Butler bond bill will not get through the
House, and If it should it will never receive execu
tive sanctlo.i In its present form. The total transac
tions were 125,000 shares. Sugar was firm during
. the early trading at 1524V4@124%- In the last
hour, however, it drooped to 122Â» / 8 and left off at the
lowest point of the day. He tinea was a sixteenth
of a cent per pound higher, I ut this did not check
the selling, which set in after the first hour. Man
hattan was heavy. Specula ion closed weak and
lower, with prices anywhere Jrom % to 3% per
cen: lower on the day.
Bonds were generally lower; sales footed up
f 635. 000. Fort Worth and Denver City sixes fell
BV4 to 56Vij; Cleveland, Cincinnati. Chicago and
St. Louis i.eneral fours fell 1 to 88: Kansas Pa
cific Consolidated fours, 1 to 28; St. Louis South

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. 111, May 25.â The wheat trade, or
such of it as Is of bullish turn of mind, looks for
improvement In prices to come from an export de
mand. Some business in that line was transacted
at the seaboard on Saturday, and it was claimed
that the buying for shipment abroad would from
this time on show better. Of course this was alto
gether conjecture, and probably the wish was
father to the thought, but nevertheless the market
received some benefit from the theory as was evi
denced by the opening this morning;. The visible
supply received much attention to-day, a good
decrease being expected, the final postings con
firming the belief. The. reduction was 1,848.000
bushels.
As this was a holiday in Europe there was no
cable and the usual statistics incident to Monday
were not received. Receipts at Chicago were ten
cars. The Northwest had 583 cais against 401
last Monday, and 363 a year ago. Local inspec
tions from store were 13,310 bushels. Danublan
shipments last week were 1,632.000 bushels. At
lantic seaboard clearances amounted to 111,179
bushels. Afternoon holders became discouraged
at the failure of prices to advance and In their
disappointment offered. freely, the effect of which
was to cause weakness and material decline. July
wheat opened from 6 i Vic to 61 Vie sold between
. : oisÂ»r and 60c, closing at b0i B ebidâ %c un
der Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow
95 cars. â¢ .
CORNâ Was affected only by the ruling tone of
Wheat. The feeling was therefore steady to firm
early, but the bidding was not unusually brisk or
noteworthy. â  There were no cables for the same
reason that none on Wheat were received. Re
ceipts were 405 cars, and 137,935 bushels were
withdrawn from store. The visible supply de
creased 1,163.000 bushels. After noon the
strength was displaced by weakness and prices de
clined. Export clearances amounted to 349,112
bushels. July Corn opened at 29y B e, sold at 88&& C,
closing at 2bS/i@2B%eâ i,4(a,B/ B e under Saturday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 725 cars.
OATSâ Lacked energy of action, and during the
morning were steady to firm, through the re
lationship existing between them and the other
grain markets. Recelots were 310 cars and 169,
-278 bushels were taken from store. Export
clearances were 94,930 bushels. The visible sup
ply decreased 275,000 bushels. The tone was
easy during the last hour, prices losing more than
was gained: early July oats closed s/ 8 c under Sat
urday. Estimated receipts for Tuesday 615 cars.
FLAXâ Was weak. Cash, 85c: May, 82iAc:
July, 83V 2 c; September, 85S/ @B6c. Receipts
were 25 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The hog market was not exactly
weak this morning, but the fact that it was not
strong was construed adversely when applied to

DOLLARS A MONTH,
Haywards Electric Road
Cuts the Salary of Its
Attorney.
STRONG COMBINE ENDS.
Reed and Nusbaumer Refuse to
Accept One-Halt of Their
Former Fee.
YEARS OF WOBX IGNORED.
The Attorneys Were Anticipating an
Increase on Account of Faith
ful Service.
Oakland Office San Frawcisco Cali,,)
908 Broadway, May 25. (
One ol the strongest combinations in
Alameda County has been broken, and
politicians and lawyers are wondering
what the next development will be.
Because the directors of the Haywards
Electric road have reduced their salaries
one-half, Georee Reed and Emile Nus
baumer, one of the strongest politico-legal
combinations in the county, have severed
ail connection with the corporation and
are now looting for a chance to openly
fight it.
Nothing that has happened on Broad
way for a long time has aroused more
general interest than this split in the
ranks. The simplo appellation of at
torneys for the company does not repre
sent by any means the relationship of
Reed and Kusbaumer toward the electric
road. The relationships of the attorneys
with the Supervisors and with the City
Council and boards of trustees has been
far more prominent than their actual legal
work, and in reality they have been the
politicians for the company as well as the
attorneys.
A few weeks ago, during the riots at
San Leandro, when Egbert Stone was ar
rested and when the outlook for the com
pany was very blue, George Reed posted
in haste to that town and did a great deal
of active work. He exposed himself to
tome personal risk. He said the amount
of work and worry of that job alone was
worth a thousand dollars.
The firm has boen the attorney for the
road since it first started, and during all
these years the salary paid was f 100 per
month. This was kept up till a few days
aj:o, aud owing to the increase of the
legal business of the company their at
torneys are considering the advisability
Of demanding $200 for their services.
Since the advent of Assessor Dalton the
assessments of the company have made j
necessary many fights for reductions. At i
different times the attorneys have super- |
intended two bond issues amounting
to $500,000, and it is said that the usual
commission for so doing should be $5000.
All that they have received from the com
rany for four years and a half of sorvice is
$5400.
The thunder-clap fell when the firm re
ceived notice that the corporation had de
cided to reduce their salaries to $50 per
month. Reed & Nusbaumer thought that
the announcement was preliminary to a
joke, but they were aisappointed. They
discovered that the directors were in ear
nest and that $50 a month was all the sal
ary for the corporation's attorney would
be in the future.
The next day the strong combination
was broken, and George Reed and Emil
Kusbaumer were not the legal and politi
cal representatives of the company.
Curiosity as to the cause of the breach
has been great, but it wa3 not till to-day
that the secret was out.
The officers of the company declare that
the amount of work required by the cor
poration does not merit the payment of
more than $50 per month, and that as it is
a cold business proposition they cannot
pay more. The successor to Reed &
Nusbaumer it Sam Bell McKee.
Emil Nusbaumer was asked to-day
about the affair, but he merely remarked,
"Well, we've done with corporations now. I
Taere is nothing in supplying brains for
â¢Euch bodies."
BURGLARS CAUGHT.
Gave the Marshal and Posse an Kxcit-
ing Footrace.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 25.â Town Mar
sha! Giesenhoffer of San Leandro brought
John Martin and Edward Kellcy to the
County Jail to-day and locked them ap on
a charge of burglary. One was captured
by the Marshal and bis posse after an ex
citing footrace and the other by Town
Trustee Cary after a similar experience.
The fellows forced an entrance last night
into the residence of Miss Nellie Byrne,
who resides next to Town Trustee Cary'
â¢while the lady wa3 at church. When she
returned and found the burglars at work
she*quickly pave the alarm, to which Mr.
Cary and his man responded. Tney made
for the first man who emerged from the
building, but ran him half a mile before
he was brought to bay. He resisied, but
being so nearly wirnlea, and only one
against two, was soon overpowered.*
The other fellow was followed by Mar-
Bhal Giesenhoffer. They excited the neigh
borhood, and a number of citizens joined
in the chase, which finally resulted in the
fellow being surrounded. He, too, at
tempted to resist, but was speedily over
powered. Their kit was found on them,
and they were locted up for the night and
brought to a safer place to-day.
HIS BODY RECOVERED.
Bemaing of Peter Xelgon, Drowned With
S. U. yon Hchmidt. Washed Ashore.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 25.â The body of
Peter Nelson, the sailor drowned with 8.
H. yon Schmidt a week ago wnile sailing
on the estuary, was recovered this morn
ing at the Peralta freight slip by Thomas
Stewart of 604 Valdez street.
Owing to the time the body was in the
water it was impossible to recognize the
features, but it could be seen the remains
were those of a young man. On his person
was found a silver watch, but no papers by
which he could be positively identified.
Deputy Coroner Ivellen took tne watch to
Ban Francisco to one of Nelson's friends,
who identified the timepiece as one carried
by the dead sailor.

Since the winning of the preat debating

ZIMMERMAN ON TRIAL
The Alleged Stamp Swindling Case Now
Being Heard in the United States
District Court.
The case of the Government against
Frank Wooge, alias George M. Zimmer
man, alias Frank Koenig, charged witu
using the mails for fraudulent purposes,
came up In the District Court yest erday
for trial. The Government presented its
evidence, Rfter which Zimmerman's attor
ney made the usual formal request for a
dismissal of the charge. Judge Morro w
denied the motion, ordering that the hear
ing proceed. The defense will make out
its case to-day.
Wooge, or Zimmerman, was arrested
some weeks ago on a charge of using the
mails for fraudulent purposes. While a
resident of Oregon and later of Siskiyou
County, he wrote to the various large
stampdealers throughout the country for
approval lists. Instead of remitting for
such stamps as he professed to desire and
returning the balance, he would keep the
entire lot and later dispose of them to
other dealers. He was conducting quite
an extensive business in this line when ar
rested.
The first systematic instruction on scien
tific principles for the deaf was begun by
Bonet at Madrid in 16J0.
WAR OF FENCES
IN WEST OAKLAND,
No Daylight Can Reach
the Home of the
Davises.
ON THE AGGRESSIVE.
Six Feet Was Added to the
Immense Dead Wall Last
Night.
OVER THE SECOND STORY.
A Feud That Shows Itself in Car
penter Work and Redwood
Lumber.
Oaklakd Office Saw Francisco Call )
908 Broadway, May 25. f
Eix feet was added to. the Troy fence to
day in West Oakland, and an extra police
officer has been detailed to preserve the
peace in that neighborhood.
For six years the Troys and the Davises
have been building fences at Eighth and
Kirkham street*. The two families have
lived on adjoining lots all that time, but
the relationship has not been always as
strained as it in to-day.
In the beginning the fence was a very
modest affair about six feet in height.
That was sufticient to prevent the two
families from seeing each other out of the
kitchen windows, but it did not prevent
them from looking over with the aid of a
chair, so the Troys built a fence several
feet higher than that of the Daviset-.
Davis went one better, and carried his
fence up till it was fifteen feet high. This
effectually stopped hostilities between the
first story of the two houses.
After that the war began from the sec
ond story and was quite lively. It was
decided to carry up the wall till it blocked
out the possibility of looking into each
other's upper windows. Troy added a few
more feet until it would bo impossible for
one family to annoy the other, except they
got up ou the rooF. Finally the matter
was taken into the Police Court, and the
two lai!ie3 admitted so much that Judf;e
Wood decided that neither had a case, a3
each confessed to some striking and hair
pulling, and threw the case out of court.
"I don't intend to be driven away by the
Troys," said Mrs. Davis, â¢'although her
fence makes it impossible for me to rent
my lower flat"
"If I could get the full value for my
house," said Mrs. Davis, "I would go to
the ends ot the earth to get out of the
ranjre of that woman's voice."
The Troy boys recently discovered that
the Davises could look around the end o^"
the fence and get a glimpse of the Troy
place. This was a situation that could
not be tolerated for a moment, and to
day a big addition was made to the front
of the fence. The Davises took no active
means to resent it, but were contented to
make grimaces at the fence-builders. The
Troys declare that they will isolate them
selves from the Davises if they have to
build a fence as high as the "Tower of
Babel.
At present the Troy fence runs up above
the second story of the Davis residence
at a distance of about one foot. This prac
tically roba the half of the Davis house of
any daylight.
ALAMEDA TRUSTEES.
Postoffloe Business Increasingâ Prepara
tions Made for School Picnic

ALAMEDA, Cal., May 2s.â At the regu
lar meeting of the City Trustees Urn even
ing accounts to the amount of $522 were
passed for payment. The sum of i/750 was

request of Trustee Hammond ; as was the
ordinance compelling the use of bells on
bicycles in the city.
The chief of the fire department was
granted leave of absence for fifteen days
from next Wednesday, and Henry Muller
was appointed to act in his stead.
The Southern Pacific Company wrote
asking for a copy of the ordinance affect
ing the stationing of a llagman at the cor
ner of Park street and Encinal avenue.

suggested the substitution of a bell in
stead of a flagman. It was agreed to try
the bell, to ring at a distance of 500 feet
from the crossing, and if it 13 not satisfac
tory to put a flagman there.
The clerk was instructed to advertise for
100 long tons of coal for the Electric Light
Works.
A. L. Fisher applied for payment on ac
count of the electrical apparatus and
boilers. Seven thousand five hundred dol
lars was transferred from the general fund

Steward Young Believes Drugs Were
' Put In the Water.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 25.â P. p. Young,
who claims he is the "Steward of the
Lord," charges his enemies with putting
poison in the water of which he and his
family had to partake.
â  In speaking of the matter to-day, he said :
"I don't suppose I ought to tell you this,
for we are not yet certain how it was done,
but all of us experienced the most strange
nausea. I firmly believe the water was
poisoned; I think the Whitecapa did it.
You see I was very nervous yesterday
anyway, but when my family became so
much worse than I was I commenced to
think something was wrong. Later, when
we were taken even worse, 1 was convinced
thai an attempt had been made to poison
us. "We stopped using the water imme
diately, and then felt somewhat better. I
don't know what may come of this yet."

NEED MALE TEACHERS.
Discussion Regarding Pnblio Schools
by the Board of Educa
tion.
OAKLAND, Cal., May 25. â Ambrose
Mejahan, secretary of the Educational
Publication Company of this city, Delie^es
there should be more men teachers in the
public schools, and gives his views in the
following interesting statement:
A letter which is now before a committee of
the San Francisco Board of Education for con
sideration calls attention to the numerous
victims of suspension from the public schools
of that City and suggests that the prime cause
of many of these suspensions may be found in
the injustice done the thousands of the older
pupils, and especially the boys, who are un
wisely deprived of their just rights to the ben
efits of male teachers. And the letter under
consideration goes on to say that about the
only excuse for this unwise policy of the board
in employing female teachers to the exclusion
of male teachers seems to be In order to pro
vide an "army of accomplished and lovable
girls and women with positions in the school
department."
Whether or not this committee of investiga
tion finds that suspensions from the San Fran
cisro schools ure, in many cases, chargeable to
the fact tnnt pupils are under the guidance
solely of female teachers, this practice of em
ploying such an overwhelming preponderance
of female talent, in City school departments
especially, is one that is attracting a great deal
of opposition.
In perhaps no other city of the United States
are the children so completely deprived of the
benefits of male teachers as In the city of Oak
land, where practically all the punils in the
public schools are In charge of female teachers.
That this is a mistake no one who under
stands anything about education will deny.
That the very essence of education is the for
mation of character, and that the intangible
something which we call the personalityâ the
individuality of the teacherâ is the subtle
force, power or influence which is a leading
formative agency in this work of charater
building all will admit.
And yot the educational system of our city
is based practicnily on the principle that the
child n-n of Oakland shall b? brought up under
the influence of feminine traits of character.
Tin re- in an ignoring of the fact that the full
development of a child's nature demands that
it be brought under both male and female in
fluences. The manhood of a man appeals to
the boy and prompts him in a way which we
cannot wholly comprehend nor define; and
there is something in the character of a man
which lias a tremendous influence on the in
tellectual life of the girl.
There is no denying the truth of the claim
that both male and lemnlc teachers are needed
for the proper education of both boys aud
girlsâ leading educators the world over so as
Â«ert. A great wrong is committed when the
boys and girls of a community are obliged to
complete their school course without having
been instructed by a male teacher. And yec
t!ii> i.s what is being done in the city of Oak
land, wiiere only the favored few who attend
the High School have the beneiits of male in
structors.
The addition oi a score or more of eflicient
male teachers to the t'.'achinj^ force of this city
would be an inestimab.e blessing to tne chil
dren in our prammar school.*, and would un
doubtedly work some surprising changes in
tne census statistics, especially as to the great
number of children of school'age who do not
attend any school. To say this is no disparage
ment of the good work thÃt is being done by
the women teachers of the city, many of whom
>l" \v i| ecia] pedagogical ability. The point at
issue is the kind of instruction that is essential
to the perfect development of the child, and
nature teaches and experience shows that the
Oakland plan produces one-sided results.
TRUANT CHILDREN.
Superintendent Babcock Tells the
Woman's Federation How Many
There Are.
At the meeting of the Federation of
Women, held yesterday afternoon, a let
ter from Superintendent Babcock was read,
commending the work of trio federation in
trying to nutke truant children attend
school. The letter stated that the number
of children between 5 and 7 years of age,
not attending school, according to the
latest, census, is 16,'J67, though it is possi

The Grand Jury has visited the County Jail
and the City Prison, and adjourned until
Tuesday.
A suit has been brought by W. H. Crozer
against the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany for $1000 damages.
Yesterday tne thermometer rose to 70
degrees as its maximum heat, and to-day at
noon it was 80 degrees. At 3:30 it was 88
degrees.
It has been decided to adjourn the Institute
of Applied Christianity until the first week in
September, and no meeting will be held this
evening.
C. S. Kendall, who is employed as a deck
hand on the creek boat, had his Bhoulder dis
located last evening. He attempted to leap
from the boat to the landing and struck his
shoulder.
The "rational revival" meetings being held
by Rev. Edwards Davis under the auspices of
the Christian church will be continued at the j
Ashhury churcn, corner of Clay and Fifteenth |

The Union Savings Bank has secured & writ
of assistance to have the Sheriff's aid in secur
ing possession of property at 1663 Sixteenth

foreclosed.
The Young Men's Congressional District
Club held a preliminary meeting Saturday
evening, J. C. Martin acting as temporary
chairman. Another meeting will be held
Wednesday evening. It is the intention to

The Supervisors have been considering the
cost of feeding prisoners and the possibility of
making a saving. The rate of 23 cents
allowed Sheriff McKillican was cut to 20
cents when Sheriff White took office. This
provides two meals for regular prisoners and
three for trusties daily. The county receives
40 cents a day for Uuited States prisoners and
allows the Sheriff 20 cents. In other counties
the rates range from 50 cents down to 10
cents.

NEARLY A RIOT
ON MARKET STREET
Manager Vining's Men Try
to Eject a Pas
senger.
ANGRY CROWDS GATHER
Fred Wagner, Contractor, Forgot
to Exchange a Check for
a Transfer.
FOUR POLICEMEN INTERFERE.
The Crowd Threatens to Mob Officers
for Arresting Wagner for Battery
Upon the Conductor.
The weather Was a little bit too warm for
real sport yesterday afternoon on Vining's
cable and trolley cars.
"De blokes won't stan* to der rights
when dey gives a check by mistake,"
spoke tip a besmeared-faced urchin last
evening at Powell and Eddy streets. He
had been running thither and to all day
selling his papers. He was tired, dirty
and angry.
"If dey would be onter demselves dey'd
just shove de check and hold on to der car.
"l)er isn't a bell-puncher on de line
could put me off der old car if I was onto
what he was doing."
It was little Eddie Greaney who was
tarfeing. He was in earnest and he felt
strong in the position he was taking.
The Calla ll reporter's demeanor must
bftve struck him as one of incredulity, for
he shoved his left hand into his mouth and
therefrom came a shrill whistle as from a
punctured boiler. He followed this up
with the cry of:
"Mickey ! Mickey Johnson ! Come here
quick.
"Didn't yer gee me smash dat conductor
over de head yesterday when he was a
tryin' to put de bloke off der car at Ellis
street?"
Mickey, who had hastened to Eddie's
call among a score of other urchins, nod
ded a head full of freckles in acquiescence,
adding: "Me and Brick [for Eddie is red
headed and they call him 'Brick'] saw de
'bell punch' try to do one of our customers
out of his fare on Ellis street, going nort'.
Well, we didn't do a ting to him. While
dey waa a-scuffling, tryin' to pull him off,
me and Brick climbed upon de dashboard,
and we smashed old 'bell punch' over de
hed till he let go.
"Der was a lot of friends of ours around
and dey stood in fine, iim you'd just
ought 'er seen that 'bell punch' when we
got tro'."
From tne chorus that followed it was
quite evident every lad on the street had
seen the melee between the recalcitrant
pabsenger, the "bell punch" â who, no
doubt, is meant as the conductor of the
car â and the mob of newsboys
"Der was another fight dis moniin' at
9 o'clock," Eddie continued, "but I wasn't
dere. Some small guy â a geeser way up
in der 400. One of der boys give 'im a
check and der agent was on, see? His
geesers went ter get der transfer for der
check ana he gets der t'ro 1 down.
"But he was same. He gets on der car
anyhow, Baying he could 'gitimately ride
on der check. But he weakened whendey
stop der car an' he give up his finif, so as
not to be trowed off. Dats too bad ; it's
hurtin' our business. II we'd been dere
we'd a pulled 'em trou' all right."
"Brick's" apparent regret that he or bis
friends were not present on one occasion
must have disappeared later in the even
ing when a mob of several hundred people
gave vent to their indignation at the treat
ment accorded a passenger on a Castro
street car because he had omitted to get a
transfer from Manager Vining's represen
tative on the corner of Powell and Market
streets.
The crowd was seemingly ripe for mis
chief, and even anxious for it. Its
number continued to be augmented, and
each passing car was greeted with hoots
and yells of "Stay on!" "Don't let them
pnt you off!" "We're wkh you! 1
So dense did the seekers after excite
ment become that a passage-way had to
be cleared for each passing car and vehicle
by the policemen.
Soon the police force was augmented,
and then the work of clearing the street
began and was quickly completed, for
none of the assemblage appeared anxious
to come in contact with the batons which
the police had drawn. The excitement
was all over shortly before 11 o'clock.
The passenger was Fred Wagner, con

Charles Redicker, Who, Although in Funds, Committed Suicide Last Night by
Shouting Himself Before a Mirror.
tractor, 4579 Eighteenth street, who is a
brother-in-law of Superior Judge Bahrs
and a young man of strong physique.
He boarded a Powell-street car at Union
street after sundown. He pulled a news
paper out of his pocket and became ab
sorbed in some story. Before reaching
Powell and Market streets he got the usual
check from the conductor, and as he
stepped from the car he saw a Castro-street
car on Market street, going in the direction
of his home.
Without thinking of getting the check
exchanged for a transfer by the official on
the curbstone he made a dash for the
Castro-street car and caught it. He sat
down in the car and resumed the reading
of his newspaper.
As the car moved along toward Sixth
street Conductor W. H. Brewster asked
for his transfer. Witnout looking up from
his paper Wagner handed him the check.
Brewster walked through the car and re
turned with the gripman, who bad stopped
the car at Brewster's request.
"Look here," said Brewster to Wagner,
"this check is no good. Yon will have to
get off the car or pay your fare."
"That is the only transfer I got from the
Powell-street conductor."
"Well, I tell you it's no good," repeated
Brewster. You should have changed it
for a transfer."
Wagner asked good-hum oredly if they
would wait xmtil he ran back and ex
changed the check for a transfer, when
Brewster and the gripman grabbed hold of
him by the collar and pulled him off his
seat. Wagner braced himself, but they
gradually forced him out to the rear plat
form, which was crowded. Those on the
platform, indignant at the treatment to
which Wagner was being subjected,
shoved him back into the car.
By this time there was a long line of
waiting cars, extending nearly to Fourth
street, and a big crowd of people had gath
ered round the Castro-street car. They
hooted the conductor and gripman.
"Throw them off the car," they shouted to
the other passengers, "Smash them in the
face" and other epithets.
At this juncture four policemen jumped
on the rear platform, drew their clubs,
and pushed the passengers off. The crowd
on the street pushed the passengers back
again, and the anger of the mob was
transferred to the limbs of the law, who
were in turn hooted and hissed at. Police-
man H. O'Day attempted to pull out his
handcuffs and put them on Wagner, but
the crowd pressed against him, and he
was unable to get them out of his pocket
The crowd angrily protested against the
interference of the police, and for a minute
or two a riot was imminent, as threats of
mobbing the policemen were heard. All
the officers, except O'Day, stopped inter
fering with the crowd on the platform,
but O'Day persisted in showing his au
thority.
Finally an official of the road got on the
car, and Conductor Brewster told him that
Wagner had struck him in the face.
A dozen of the passengers shouted that
it was not true, Wagner had not raised his
hand except to push back the gripman,
who was choking him from behind. The
official ordered Brewster to have Wagner
arrested for battery. The crowd protested
loudly against Wagner's arrest, but Wag
ner put an end to the trouble by consent
ing to go to the City Prison.
The car proceeded along as far as Lar
kin street, when Wagner stepped off and
was taken to the prison by Policemen
O'Day and H. P.iley and booked for bat
tery. Most of the crowd had followed the
car, and marched alongside of the two
policemen and their prisoner as far as the
prison.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, who is
a personal friend of Wagner, Happened to
be in his chambers, and when he heard of
the arrest he personally hunted up Judge
Campbell and got an order for Wagner's
release on his own recognizance. Wagner
was quickly set free and went home.
About 9 o'clock three young men were
brought to the Central police station by
Policeman Ed ODea, who was accom
panied by an employe of the Market-street
Cable Company. Sergeant Nash asked
ODea if he had any charge to bring
against the three young men. and ODea
replied that he had not, but that the em
ploye of the road had asked him to arrest
them. The employe said he baa no charge
to make against them either and the ser
geant told them to go home. They were
put to the indignity of being arrested and
marched through the streets without any
apparent cause.
Between 10 and 11 o'clock a lady and
gentleman boarded a McAllister-street car
at Powell and Market. They had foreot
ten to get their transfers and the conductor
threatened to put them off the car. A
mob of several hundred gathered around
the car and threatened the conductor and
eripman with violence if they persisted.
The gripman started the car and the mob
ran alongside all the way to McAllister
and Larkin streets, where the lady and
gentleman alighted. The crowd gave
them three lusty cheers and went back to
Market street.
Another Boon for Eureka.
Word was received at the Traffic Association
office yesterday that ail the roads interested
had agreed upon a rate tor lumber in carload
lots trom Eureka to Missouri River, Mississippi
River and Chicago and common points of <>0
cents per 100 pounds, the same rate that is iv

also apply to mixed carloads of lumber and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 26, 1896.
DIED BUT MADE NO SIGN,
Charles Redecker, a Well
to-Do German, Shoots
Himself.
He Had Been Oat of Employment for
Many Months, but Still Had
Money.
Charles Redecker, a young German, shot
himself to death in his rooms, at 632 Post
j street, yesterday evening about 5 o'clock.
The reason is not clear, as he left no word.
He was apparently in no financial
trouble, as he is said to have considerable
money. He has, however, been out of em
ployment for months and was somewhat
despondent, partly occasioned by ill
health. â¢ .- â 
Yesterday morning he left his lodgings
as usual. about 9 o'clock. He returned
shortly before 5 o'clock, went to his room,
lit a ciger, and took up a book to read.
I Half an hour later be threw his book
j away.dropped his partly burned cigar and,
stepping before his mirror, drew a re
j volver from his pocket, aimed at his
I temple, and tired.
It missed. The mirror probably caused
I him to aim badly. He tried again, and
! the ball passed. through bis temples and
j threw blood and brains upon the wall of
I the room.
The landlady of the house was entertain
j ing some friends in her room on the floor
below. She remarked about the pistol
and went out into the hall. Just then the
second shot was fired, and she ran up
stairs followed by Her guests, a gentleman
and lady.
She listened at Redecker's door and
heard the water running in his basin. She
suid it could not be there, and was about
to go to the next floor when the young
man with her noticed the smell of powder
and the smoke coming over the transom
of Redecker's room. - The landlady gave
him the keys and he opened the door.
Then he turned and told her not to enter.
She surmised what had happened and
ran for a doctor. The Receiving Hospital
was notified and Redecker was taken
there, where he died shortly after 7
o'clock.
Redecker left no word explaining his
I act. Among his effects taken by the
I Coroner subsequently there was nothing
that threw any light upon the matter.
The deceased was formerly in the em-
I cloy of the California Wine Association,
but was summarily discharged â according
1 to a letter found among his papers Sep
tember 24, 1894. He was afterward em
ployed by Tillmann & Bendel and by
I Kohler & Frohling. Out of employment
I here he went to Central America, and
three months ago he returned.
He has not found employment, but did
not seem to worry about that fact. Only a
few days ago he remarked to a friend that
he had money enough to live without
work for several years.
His landlady says he always paid his
obligations promptly. Some $15 was found
on his person.
He lias a brother, Rudolph, who is cashier
) for r'. Hillens & Co., commission mer
â  chants. Among the papers of the deceased
j was one dated August 26, 18Â»5, in which
he transferred to his brother, to hold in
trust, the following:
Fifteen shares of Market-street Railway
stock; deed to lot in Oakland, half my prop
erty; deed to lots 14 to IS. New Chicago; note
of George R. Chard, 50; New York life in
surance policy; and a general power of
attorney. H3B *
Nearly all his other papers were written
in German. The brother Rudolph had
not heard of the suicide at a late hour
last night.

Frank Rankin, 414 Eddy street, a son
of the late ex-Supervisor, is a favored
suitor for the hand of pretty Minnie
O'Grndy, dauehtcr of Mrs. O'Grady, who
owns a grocery and saloon at Natoma and
Mary streets. He visited her on Saturday
night, and between 12 ana 1 o'clock Sun
day morning Dan McNeill, a tali, strap
ping young fellow, who was a less favored
suitor for Minnie's band, made his ap
pearance.
McNeill nad Deen drinking, and when
he saw Rankin and Minnie together he
got mad and soon picked a quarrel. He
was backed up by Mrs. O'Grady, and
Rankin found himself in a tight place.
After an interchange of uncomplimentary
remarks McNeill pulled a razor out of nis
pocket and slashed Kankin across the
cheek, following it up with another slash
that cut off the end of his nose. Then Mc-
Neill beat a retreat.
Rankin was taken to the Receiving
Hospital and bad the point of his nose
stitched and dressed. He did not care to
talk upon the subject of his wounds, but
the police determined to find out all
about it.
McNeill kept out of the way, but last
night he was arrested by Policemen Rourke
and Burke and locked up in the tanks in
the City Prison.

NOW IT IS ILL
"ON TO ST, LOUIS,"
The California Delegation
Will Go in a Style
Superb.
ARRANGEMENTS MADE.
A Luxurious Special Train Will
Speed Along With Flags
and Banners.
BANQUET BEFORE THE START.
The Tippecanoe Club of Ohio Will
Whoop a Welcome and Act .
as Escort.
It is now "On to St. Louis" with the
Republican leaders.
Between now and June 17 the National
Convention will absorb the political in
terest of the party in this State. Its pros
pects and the preparations for it will be
watched with close attention, and little
connected with local and State Republican
affairs will develop until the convention
meets and then lets the campaign break
like a storm.
Those who expect to go to the conven
tion are particularly interested as well in
the arrangemenes for the trip, which are
actively under way by the direction of Dan
T. Cole, John D. Spreckels and O. A. Hale,
the committee having them in charge, and
Allen B. Lemuion of Santa Rosa, secretary
of the delegation.
The California delegation and a crowd
of friends will rush to St. Louis in superb
style. The special, train that will start
from the Oakland mole on June 11 will be
the most luxurious and magnificent one
that ever bore eastward a party of Cali
fornia representatives. It will be made up
of cars belonging to the Sunset Limited
service, new, richly furnished and decor
ated and provided with all that present
day ingenuity has devised to increase
tun luxury of modern railway travel.
The special train will be made up of the
necessary baggage cars, a combination car
containing barber shop, lounging room,
library, etc., a dining car well stocked and
four or five sleepers, all as fine as the
finest which car builders have made.
The train will proclaim its identity in
striking but tasteful decorations. On each
side of the first car will stretch a banner of
canvas four feet wide and sixty-three feet
long. In the center a portrait ol McKinley
will appear surrounded with decorative
designs, and those who see the train will
read: "California delegation to the lie
publican Convention, St. Louis, 1896."
Along the full length of that side of the
second car will stretch a similar banner
bearing "Protection to American Indus
tries I" with at one end a bear and at the
other a picture of the Golden Gate with
symbolic figures in the foreground. Amer
ican nags on the engine and two on the
front of each car will further deck the
train with peculiar appropriateness.
The delegation 11 have made an ex
ceptionally rich banner to be carried in
the streets and displayed at the head
quarters. Over $200 worth of rich silk,
gold and skilled labor will go into the
making of it.
All the delegates are expected to gather
I in San Francisco on the 10th and on that
evening they will be banqueted by the
Union League Club.
The tram will depart at 10 a. m. of
Thursday, the 11th of June, and proceed
to St. Louis by special and fast time over
the Central Pacific, Rio Grande Western,
Denver and Rio Grande and' the Burling
ton routes. The itinerary shows that Ogden
will be reached at 4 p. m., June 12, Denver
at 11:30 p. m., June 13, and St. Louis at
9:30 a. M., Monday, June 15.
At the depot the delegates will be met
by the Tippecanoe Club of Ohio with
pomp, music and joy, and then will the
California delegation dive into the gayety.
excitement, band-playing and serious
thinking of the Republican National Con
vention.
Headquarters at the Southern will soon
I be reached. The California headquarters
will be one of the prominent and valuable
ones, the music-room of f he Southern, forty
I by seventy -five feet in size, having been
engaged. Many of the Californians have
already engaged quarters at the Southern
and others at the Lindell.
The delegation is not going with any
cheap hurrah and will not dispense Cali
fornia . wines with the indiscrimination
that has been seen. There will not be
California wine and fruit for all the mob
that can crowd into the headquarters. No
carloads of these refreshments will be
taken along, but there will be a supply
sufficient to enable the delegates to show
a pleasing measure of California hospital
ity to such friends and acquaintances as
they may choose to invite as guests.
The fare for the round trip is $67 50 and
tickets will be good for thirty days. The
Californians will return by regular trains
at their convenience. . Berths on the
special train will be $15 for the trip to St.
Louis.
Those having the arrangements in hand
are especially urgent that delegates, alter
nates and their friends who propose to go
communicate at once with Secretary Allen
B. Lemmon at Santa Rosa that quarters
on the train and, if desired, quarters in St.
Louis may be reserved, and that it may be
known at once how many and who will
make up the party on the special train..
It appears now that all of the eighteen
delegates will go together with many alter
nates and other prominent Republicans
and their friends.

remembering that the less oar merits the
