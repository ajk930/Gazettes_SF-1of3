CHICAGO, 111;, Jane â The prog
ress of disintegration in the Demo
cratic party continues. Xi â¢ Secretary
Whitney will be here on Thursday, to
prepare the way for the formation of a
solid square by the gold men. While
he has not abandoned hope, he virtu
ally concedes that the nomination of a
silver candidate on a silver platform
â will mean the disruption and rout of
the Democratic party and the election
of William McKinley.
Members of President Cleveland's ad
ministration are displaying a partisan
ship which does not seem to be of
fensive to Mr. Cleveland. National
Comptroller Eckels is here in the in
terest of sound money. It is believed
that Cleveland, through his friends, is
secretly knifing the aspirations of Vice-
President Stevenson.
Bland and Boies are the only candi
dates in the field worthy of mention.
Bland is the logical candidate of the
silver men, and his strength is increas
ing hourly.
Prominent Democratic sound-money
newspapers all over' the country are
saying that never has the Democratic
party been confronted with so grave a
crisis since the party went to pieces on
the slavery question in 1860.

there is any plan on foot to buy the

SEAND MEN HOPEFUL
But There Are Already Twenty-One '
Candidates In the Scattered
Field.
CHICAGO, 111., June 29.â While Farmer
Bland is toiling on his ranch in Missouri
his boom for the Presidential nomination
by the Chicago convention is growing
apace. In fact the advertising balloon
was sent up from th* Auditorium tower
to-day, and lithographs of the silver sage
were scattered over the city. Headquar
ters have been permanently established,
and the booming of guns for "Silver Diclr"
will be heard with the arrival of Governor
Stone and party to-morrow morning. The I
Bland men are confident that they will
succeed in having their candidate nom
inated by tne convention. So certain are
they of success that the} 7 are serenely in
different to the aspirations of other candi
date?, excepting probably Boies, who is
regarded as the most formidable. Thus
far, however, Boies has not shown much
strength apart from his own State. The
delegation from lowa is naturally for him
first, last and all the time, out of course
there are others.
There are twenty-one candidates in the
field for the nomination up to date, and
how many more will appear at the Coli
seum next wt ek the good Lord only knows. |
The Chronicle, the only Democratic !
newspaper in Chicago, is very much !
alarmed ever the situation. It is an
honest money paper, and, therefore, can
not stomach the silver pill. Its comment j
Is ominous. Says the Chronicle:
"Not since 1860 has the National Demo
cratic party been confronted with so grave
a crisis in its affairs as at present. Thirty
six years ago the organization went to
pieces on the slavery question. It will
undoubtedly require very discreet and in
telligent management to prevent a serious
split on themoney issue in the convention
to be held in this city next week. The
convention promises to be one of the most
interesting political gatherings in the
history of this country. It is believed
that the crowds in atlendance will, in
point of numbers, surpass anything before
known. The forerunners of the various I
Presidential candidates are already on the j
ground, and it is said tbat before the end
of this week the hotels will be severely
taxed to provide accommodations for the
tnousands of delegates and visitors.
"So far little attention has been given to
the claims of candidates for the Presi
dential nomination. Interest has chiefly
centered in the fight over tbe financial
question, and it was not until that had
been settled, apparently in favor of the
free silver forces, that the talk about can
didates began to be heard. It is signifi
cant that of the 926 delegates who will
compose the convention only 256 have
been instructed as to Presidential prefer
ences by the States which appointed
them. There are therefore 670 delegates,
or more than two-thirds of the whole
number, who are uninstructed as to can
didates for President. It is said that the
records of political parties in the United
States may be searched in vain to find a
situation parallel to this."
Hugh C. Wallace of Tacoma, National
Committeeman from Washington, a young
man with a large opinion of himself, and
a son-in-law of Chief Justice Fuller of the
United States Supreme Court, blew into
town late last night. He came from New
York, where he has been doing missionary i
work for the gold men. Wallace is sn en- ;
iast. He has promised to deliver to |
tiey tbe entire Washington (telega- j
Nile it is common knowledge that !
â¢crats of that State are at daggers'

are pretty generally united for silver,
while the Puget Sound voters will gladly
submit to injections of gold. Consequently
tne critics of Wallace say he will be un
able to deliver to Whitney et al. the goods
he has contracted for. In justice to Wal
lace it may be said that he is an Eastern
man and migrated to Washington in boom
days, became a real-estate operator at
Tacoma and gathered in a few shekels on
tbe rise in values. His sympathies are
with the gold standard, however, and he
is man enough to declare himself. He
says:
"The talk about Eastern capitalists com
ing out here to buy silver delegates for
sound money is all bosh. There will be
no attempt to coerce nor will there be any
unfair means used. There will be a host of
strong, earnest Democrats from the East
and other localities, many of them of
National prominence and leadership,
come to Chicago, who hope to dissuade
the silver leaders from party suicide.
They . will show conclusively that the
adoption of a 16 to 1 platform by the con
vention means practically annihilation of
the Democracy of New York, Connecticnt
and New Jersey. There are those who be
lieve these States have been the bulwarks
of Democracy in the past and are essential
in the future.
"Should the convention adopt a 16 to 1
platform and nominate a silver candidate,
it will not be thirty days before the issue
is clearly defined and reduced to 'Panic
vs. No Panic,' with the result that the
combined business interests of the coun
try will array themselves against that
candidate whose election means a panic.
No party has ever succeeded with the
business interest against it. It is a long
time between now and election, and the
wage-earners of the country will have
abundant opportunity to elect whether
their wages shall be paid in 50-cent dol
lars." Frank McGuirk.
DISRUPTION IS CERTAIN.
Democracy Will Surely Be Foun
dered on Silver Rocks and
Republicans Will Win.
CHICAGO, 111., June 29.â There is no
added bustle in Chicago to-day by reason
of the fact that a Democratic convention
will be held in this city next week. Only
a few of the scouts of the sound-money
men sent hither to spy out the land have
put in an appearance as yet, and the
Palmer House presents only its wonted
appearance with, the gentlemen from the
South and East and West and North sit
ting around in the chairs and speculating
as to whether Jones would not have added
more largely to his income by putting an
other story on his nineteen-storygsky
scraper.
The only symptom that something out
of the way is in progress is the presence of
a Jarge mimoerof desperate footpads and
burglars. During the last four liights in
numerable burglaries have been com
' mitted. Peaceable citizens have been
stood up at the revolver's point on the
public highway and robbed, and daring
the same period saloons have been entered
as early as 10 o'clock at night by from two
to four armed men and tne proprietors
have been forced to deliver up to them the
contents of the till. Last night, for in
stance, four men attacked a saloon-keeper,
who was seriously shot by the robbers.
An hour or so later a man trying to break
into a freightcar was shot dead by a night
} watchman. Even as I write three men
j drive up in a wagon to the American Ex
! press Company across the way. One of
them has a valise handcuffed to his right
wrist. The grip may contain a thousand
dollars in currency or it may contain a
million. The two men who walk on each
side of him are Pinkerton guards. Each
has a revolver in his right hand
pants pocket with his right hand clutch
ing the handle ready for action on the in
itant. These and other extraordinary
precautions to guard money and other
property have been made necessary by the
presence of a large body of criminals
gathered here from all parts of the coun
try for the purpose of plunder. They have
been attracted by the immense crowds
'that will be here next week, and it is cx
i pected that gold bricks will find a ready
j market among the silver farmers of the
j South and West.
Everything political here is in a state of
| suspense, and we are listening to the tick-
I ing over the wires of news from New York,
the headquarters of the sound money
forces. No move will be made until Thnrs-
day, when Whitney and a contingent
from New York will be on the ground.
The Democratic National administration
favors sound money and has already sent
its couriers here to spy out the land. It is
understood that President Cleveland is
more than ordinarily interested in the
financial plank, and that the administra
tion officers who are here and who have
been here came with his assent. A day or
two ago First Assistant Postmaster Gen
eral Frank Jones and Charles Tracy came
here from New York ana left again a few
hours iater. They were to lay a wire or
two on behalf of sound money and kept
their movements secret.
Another representative of the adminis
tration is J. H. Eckels, National Comp
troller at Washington. He will remain
here until the close of the session of the
convention and has not the slightest fear
of "offensive partisanship" or its punish
ment by the mugwumpery. Comptroller
Eckels is a small, light-built man, with
sandy hair and brows and pale blue eyes.
He dresses her* in a sack suit of gray,
topped with a stiff-brimmed straw hat, I
asked him to-day as to the status of the
sound money fight, and he replied that
the "gold element," as he termed it, would
make the best fight possible. The over
whelming numbers of the silverites did
not worry Mr. Eckels a bit. He was con
fident, he said, that the sound money ad
vocates would be able to show such a
condition of things that they would
secure a hearine, and that if they got that
there was a chance that they might make
many converts.
Eastern Democrats, he added, deplored
the fact that there should be discord in
the party, especially this year, when the
prospects were brilliant for the carrying
of New York State by the Democracy, and
they feel very forely that there is danger
that these hopes may be dissipated. New
York cannot be carried on a silver plat
form. Of that he is positive. The work
ing people of that State very generally
were arrayed against the position taken
by the silver men. He emphasized this
statement by adding his opinion that the
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, JUNE 30, 1896.
BOIES FIRES A BROADSIDE ON THE VIEWS OF WHITNEY,
silver proposition would receive less sup
port from the working people than from
any other class. That was the case also in
the tariff fight. The greatest gains made
by the Democracy on the tariff reform
proposition were made by the laboring
classes and not among the farmers of the
country.
The working people in the cities and
towns, Mr. Eckels observed, read the
daily papers, and thus kept themselves in
formed as to current events. Not so with
the farming population, who receive their
political education from the country
weeklies. The metropolitan press, which
is the educator of the laboring people, is
largely against the free coinage of silver.
With regard to the probable action of the
sound-money Democrats in case of the
adoption of the 16 to 1 free coinage plat
form, Mr. Eckels said tnat tie did not
think any of the gold men would bolt the
convention. He did not believe that the
proposition had been discussed. What
ever had been said on that subject had
been said by the silver men and not by
the gold men.
"The East will not be carried for a sil
ver platform," he continued. "The
people of the manufacturing centers be
lieve in a stable monetary standard. They
want a good dollar. The East, more than
the West, is in a position to see the effect
upon the business interests of this coun
try, which are related to foreign business
interests, of changes in tbe stability of
the currency. There is no such thing as
having an independent commercial and
financial system for any country unless
you can inclose it within a Chinese wall."
In reply to a question as to whether the
tariff would not be an important factor in
the campaign Comptroller Eckels said that
the tariff question would not cut much of
a figure in the contest. The currency
plank would be the all-absorbing one.
When I asked about the reported candi
dacy of Vice-President Stevenson for the
Presidency Mr. Eckels said that he had
not heard Mr. Stevenson's name connected
with any nomination in the gift of the
people.
By the way, it is whispered that these
gentlemen of the administration who are
just now absent from their posts by per
mission of tne President have a wary eye
upon Mr. Stevenson's chances, and that
they will not strain any tendons in work
ing for Mr. Stevenson's success. In fact,
the only things strained in the matter are
said to be the relations between President
Cleveland and Vice-President Stevenson.
Mr. Boies and other representatives of
the silver wing of the Democratic party do
not agree with Mr. Eckels. Mr. Boies says
flatly that, with the exception of the Wall
street influence, the great mass of the
Democratic party in the Eastern States
will be unanimous in favor of the restora
tion of silver to its original position as pri
mary money. Mr. Boies expressed this
opinion;
"Personally I believe Webster and many
others of the most eminent of American
statesmen in the past were right in their
conclusion that the constitution of the
United States, fairly construed, requires
of Congress that it shall by law pro
vide for the coinage of both goid and
silver as standard money â that it can

HON. RICHARD PARKS BLAND, WHO IS URGED AS A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE
BY ENTHUSIASTIC DEMOCRATS OF MISSOURI.
From the outset of his public career Congressman Bland of Missouri has been the champion of cheap and plentiful money in
â¢very form, and for many years has been the recognized leader in the House of Representatives of the free-silver wing. Mr. Bland
is essentially a s*lf-made man. He was born near Hartford, Ohio County, Ky., August 19, 1835. Orphaned at an early age, he
worked during the summer months in order to obtain means with which to attend school in the winter, and thus acquired an aca
demic education. He then studied law and was admitted to che bar. In 1855 he removed to Missouri and then to California,
Subsequently he settled in Virginia City, Nev., where he became interested in mining operations. Returning to Missouri in 1865,
he eventually drifted to Lebanon, in that State, and while practicing Jaw there was elected to Congress as a Democrat in 18 73.
He has since been regularly re-elected. He introduced in the Forty-fourth Congress the well-known "Bland bill," which provided
that the Secretary of the Treasury should purchase sufficient bullion to coin the minimum amount of $"2,000,000 a month in silver
dollars of 412}Â£ grains each, and that these doilars should be legal tender. He also introduced in the Fifty-third Congress the
"Seigniorage bill,' 1 which was passed by Congresa but was vetoed by the President. Whatever else may be said of Mr. Bland's
legislative career, it is certain that he reflects faithfully the wishes and the opinions of his constituents. Personally he has his
cause much at heart, conceiving himself to be the champion of the debtor class and a crusader against what he calls a wicked con
spiracy of the bankers and the "goidbugs."

"Let Disruption ConW Says the lowa
Statesman, "if Urju-t Law Must
Be Undone."
WATERLOO, lowa, June 29.âjtfx-Gov
ernor Boies returned this afternoon from
his Grundy County farm, where he went
immediately on his return from Illinois.
When asked if he intended going to Chi
cago soon he replied that he had not de
termined whether he would attend the
convention or not.
"At any rate," he said, "I do not know
of any reason which should call me to Chi
cago tnis week."
He further stated that he had made no
arrangements for going to Chicago at any
time during the convention. As to what
were his plans for the campaign he did
not care to say anything.
This evening Mr. Boies met Judge Van
Wagenen, who was on 1 is way to Chicago,
and accompanied him to Manchester.
Judge Van Wagenen is Mr. Boies' alter
nate as delegate at lar -c, and is also in
charge of the Boies bureau in Chicago.
Neither party would talk when questioned
in regard to the situation, but Mr. Boies
said that the object of their meeting was
to talk matters over as to what was best to
be done at Chicago.
During Governor Boies' absence in
Grundy County the interview with Wil
liam C. Whitney was published, and on
his return his attention was called to a
telegram from the New York Herald ask
ing his opinion in regard to the assertions
made in it. He wired his reply to-night
as follows:
Mr. Whitnej is entirely right in his
conclusion tb;-t there is no disposition on
the part of those who will represent the
silver sentiment of the -iouth and West in
the Chicago convention to further discuss
the matter at issue dfitfa men whose views
are diametrically onro."> 4 ' to their own on
the currency question, lie is entirely cor
rect in his conclusion that it is now too
late to accomplish any practical results by
a riiscusÃion of tbat character. Through
out the South and West that discussion
has been extended, and the views ex
pressed by Mr. Whitney have been put
forward by many men who entertained
them and they have been fully consid
ered and weighed, and after all of this
the judgment of an overwhelming majority
of the party in these sections is in evidence
by the class of delegates who have been
chosen to represent it in the Chicago con
vention. Not one of these men can now
disregard the known sentiment of those
who selected him without betraying the
trust confided to him, and not one of
them, in my judgment, will eyer do so.
Mr. Whitney is entirely wrong in as
suming that free-silver Democrats are for
saking the fundamental principles of
Democracy, or that what he terms sound
money Democrats are defending these
principles in their endeavor to commit
their party to gold monometallism. Until
the Republican party met in St. Louis a
few days since there was never a line writ
ten in a National platform of either of the
great parties tbat justifies the claim that
the one or the other of these parties was
committed to that doctrine.
Over and over again the Democratic
party, in National Convention assembled,
has put itself on record in the clearest and
most comprehensive language possible to
use in favor of bimetallism, in favor of the
restoration of silver to its place in our
financial system as standard money, and
never for a moment in the Congress of
the United States has a majority or any
thing like a majority of the representa
tives of that party wavered in its devotion
to the principle so ciearly enunciated in
the party platforms. To assume now that
adherence to that principle is abandon
ment of an established doctrine of that
party is to defy history and ignore the
most plainly written of all its declarations
of policy. It is useless to claim that a
tender of the good offices of the party to
secure an international agreement for the
free coinage of silver is the fulfillment of
its pledges so often made in this respect.
To the sincere believer in bimetallism
for the United States an effort of this
character ip little if anything less than an
unqualified violation of a sacred pledge by
a great political organization. If this is
all that Mr. Whitney and those who think
with him can offer it will be vastly better
that they offer nothing. When Mr. Whit
ney says tlai the maintenance of our
present gold standard is essential to the
preservation of our National credit and re
demption of our public pledges he ignores
a great truth of which he cannot be ig
norant. He knows there is not a single
obligation of this Nation outstanding to
day that by its terms is payable in gold
alone, and he knows that rieht upon the
face of the great bulk of the bonds of the
Government it is written in substance that
they are payable in coin of the United
States of the standard weight and fineness
ofits coins before silver was demonetized,
and that therefore by their own express
terms they are payable in our present sil
ver dollars, if the Government elects to so
pay them. It ia since the most of
these obligations were issued that silver
has been demonetized; whereby, if they
are to be paid in gold alone, their
value has been doubled and the burden of
the great industrial class, who must pro
vide for their payment, has been in
creased twofold. To talk about a viola
tion of National honor when no party in
the Nation has ever suggested its failure
in the least degree to meet every obliga
tion it has assumed acoording to the
strict letter of the contract it made has,
McKINLEY'S WARM WELCOME
to say the least, a strange sound to those
who heed the universal cry of distress oc
casioned as they believe by doubling the
purchasing power of money and cutting
in twain the market price of the products
of labor. If to undo what law has done to
add to the burdens of the toiling millions
of this Nation and double the fortunes of
the rich within it is to disrupt the Demo
cratic party, disruption must come. The
majority of the party threatens no wrong
to any one, and if those who compose that
majority can avoid it all may be assured
they will submit to no wrong, such as the
permanent establishment of a single gold
standard would impose upon the great
mass of the people of this Nation.

WHARTON BARKER'S IDEAS
Says Whitney's Threatened Bolt
Will Not Swerve the Purpose
of True Leaders.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., June 29.â
Wharton Barker, who has announced a
candidate for the nomination of the Presi
dency, gives to the press the following
statement:
"If I read the signs of the times aright,
Mr. Whitney's threatened bolt will not
swerve the purpose of the true leaders of
the Democratic party ; of those men who
are patriots, not partisans, who have the
welfare of the producing classes at heart,
and who revolt at the prospect of con
tinned subserviency to the money cliques.
"The fall in prices that is sapping the
wealth of our producing classes, that is
bankrupting our manufacturers, ruining
our farmers and reducing our wage-earn
ine classes to poverty must be checked and
it can only be checked by removing the
cause. That cause is the appreciation of
gold consequent on discarding silver and
throwing on gold alone the burden of ef
fecting the exchanges of the western
world and to check this appreciation we
must restore silver to its place as money,
side by side with gold.
"If the Democrats are wise, if they will
adopt a platform and nominate a candi
date who will be a platform in himself,
who stands for the restoration of silver to
its place for money, for financial and in
dustrial as well as political independence
as opposed to subserviency to foreign
money cliques and their American allies,
such candidate will receive the enthusias
tic support of bimetallists of both parties,
and will be chosen by the people as tbeir
leader by ai: overwhelming majority, for the
bolt in the Democratic party will be in
finitely small compared to the great num
ber of Populists and birretallists â hereto
fore Republicans â who will loyally and
enthusiastically support such a candidate.
If the leaders of the Democratic party at
Chicago will act so as to unite the bimetal
lists of all parties â Democrats, Populists
and Republicans â Major McKinley and
the money clique v.iil, 1 repeat, be over
whelmingly defeated."
STRENGTH OF SILVER MEN
Six Hundred and Seven Delegates
to the Convention Pledged
for White Metal.
CHICAGO, 111., June 29.â Senator
Jones, in giving out an estimate of the
strength of the silver delegates of the con
vention this evening, said he had made a
list of 607 who are pledged to vote for the
white metal.
He claimed, in addition to these, about
thirty or forty others, who are in favor of
silver, but who, owing to instructions from
State conventions, are unable to work
direct with the silver men.
The National Democratic Committee
will meet Monday to select the temporary
officers of the convention.
Among the names suggested for the
temporary chairmanship are those of
Senator Hill of New York, Senator Vilas of
Wisconsin, Senator Gray of Delaware and
Hugh C. Wallace of Washington. Sena
tor .Tories said he thought the silver men
would accept the recommendation that
Hill be made temporary chairman of the
convention.
"I believe Senator Hill is a fair man,"
Mr. Jones said, "and I would have, abso
lute confidence in hi? ability, justice.and
impartiality as a presiding officer. If he
is selected I think there will be no attempt
by the convention to take this appoint
ment out of tbe hands of the National
Committee."
Tbe name of ex-Governor Pennoyer of

R. Welch, both of Portland, arrived
in the city to-day to take part in
the meeting of the Bimetallic League and
during the afternoon they devoted their
time to sounding the praises of their can
didate. Dr. Mullinix said in case they
are unsuccessful in securing the nomina
tion of Mr. Pennoyer they will cheerfully
support any free-silver candidate the con
vention may name.

CANTON, Ohio, June 29.â The commit

State and Territory, selected at the St.
Louis Convention to convey to Major Mc-
Kinley official notification of his nomina
tion, arrived in Canton on a special train
from Cleveland at 11:30 o'clock this morn
ing. It was met at the station by the re
ception committee, and driven in open
carriages to Major McKinley's residence,
accompanied by mounted escorts.
The preparations at Major McKinley's
were simple. Seventy - five chairs had
been placed on the front lawn under the
trees facing the bouse. Major McKinley
received the members of the committee
on the veranda. The streets about the
house were filled with men, women and
children. The crowd surged in at the
gates and pressed close upon the chairs.
Senator Thurstou arose and, addressing
McKinley, announced to niru that he was
the choice of the National Repulican Con
vention for President. He predicted the
overwhelming victory of the Republican
party. Senator Thurston said:
Governor McKinley : We are here to perform
the pleasant duty assigned us by the Republi
can National Convention recently assembled
in St. Louis, that of formally notifying you of
your nomination as the candidate of the Re
publican party for the Presidency.
We respectfully request your acceptance of
this nomination and your approval of the
declaration of principles adopted by the con*
vention.
We assure you that you are the unanimous
choice of a united party, and your candidacy
will t>e immediately accepted by the country
as an absolute guaranty of Republican suc
cess. Your nomination has been made in
obedience to a popular demand, attesting the
affection and confidence of the olain people of
the United States. By common consent you
are their champion. Their mighty uprising
in your behalt emphasizes the sincerity of
their conversion to the cardinal princi
ples of protection and reciprocity, as
best exemplified in that splendid act
which justly bears your name. Under it
this Nation advanced to the very culmination
of prosperity; a prosperity shared in by all
sections, all interests and all classes; by capi
tal and labor, by producer and consumer; a
prosperity so happily in harmony with the
genius of popular government tnat its choicest
blessings were most widely distributed among
the lowliest toilers and the humblest homes. In
1892 your countrymen, unmindful of your
solemn warnings, returned that party to
power which reiterated its everlasting opposi
tion to a protective tariff and demanded the
repeal of the McKinley act.

tariff are vastly greater than those which came
to them from four years of civil war. Out ot it
all one great good remains: Those who scorned
your counsels witnessed the fulfilment of your
prophecies, and even ns the scourged and re
pentant Israelites abjured their stupid idols
and resumed unquestioning allegiance to
Moses and to Moses 1 God, so now your country
men, shamed of their errors, turn to you and
to those glorious principles for which you
stand, in the full belief that your candidacy
and the Republican platform mean that the
end of the wilderness has come and the prom
ised land of American prosperity is again to
them an insured inneritance.
But your nomination mtans more than the
indorsement of a protective tariff, of reci
procity, of sound money and of honest finance,
for all of which you have so steadfastly stood.
It means an indorsement of your heroic
youth, your fruitful years of arduous public
service, your sterling patriotism, your stalwart
Americanism, your Christian character and
the purity, fidelity and simplicity of your pri
vate life. In all these things you are the typi
cal American, for all these things you are the
chosen leader of the people.
God give you strength to so bear the honors
and meet the duties of that great office for
which you are now nominated and to which
you will be elected, that your election will en
hance the dignity and power and glory of thiÂ«
republic and for the safety, welfare and happi
ness of its liberty-loving people.
McKinley responded as follows:
Senator Thurston and gentlemen of the notl.
' fleation committee of the Republican Na
tional Convention: To be selected as its
Presidential candidate by a great party con
vention representing so vast a number of the
people oi Die United States is a most distin
guished honor tor which i would not conceal
my high appreciation, although deeply sensi
ble of the great responsibilities of the trust
and my inability to bear them without the
generous and constant support of my fellow
countrymen. Great as is the honor con
ferred, equally arduous and important Is the
duty imposed, and in accepting the one I as
sume the other, relying upon tne patriotic de
votion of the people to the best interests of
our beloved country aud the sustaining care
and aid of Him without whose support all we
do is empty and vain.
Should the people ratify the choice of the
great convention for which you speak, my
only aim will be to promote the public good,
which in America is always the good of the
greatest number, the honor of our country
and the welfare of the people.
The questions to be settled in the National
contest this year are as serious and Important
as any of the great governmental problems
that have confronted us in the past quarter of
a century. They command our sober judg
ment and a settlement free from partisan
prejudice and passion, beneficial to ourselves
and befitting the honor and grandeur of the
Republic. They touch every interest of our
common country. Our industrial supremacy,
our productive capacity, our business and com
mercial proFperity, our labor and its rewards,
cur National credit and our currency, our
proud financial honor and our splendid free
citizenshipâ the birthright of every American
âare all involved in the pending campaign,
and thus every home in the land is directly2
nnd intimately connected with their proper
settlement.
Great are the issues involved in the coming
election and eager and earnest the people for
their right determination. Our domestic trade
musl "â â >e won back and our idle working people
employ >d ia gainful occupations at American
wages. Our home market must De restored to
its proud rank of first in the world, and our
foreign trade, so precipitately cut off by ad
verse National legislation, reopened on fair
and equitable terms for cur surplus agricul
tural and manufactured products. Protec
tion And reciprocity, twin measures of a true
American policy, should again command the
earnest encouragement of the Government at
Washington. Public confidence must be re
sumed and the skill, the energy and the capi
tal of our country find ample employment at
home, sustained, encouraged and defended
against the unequal competition and disaa
vantges with which they are now contending.
The Government of the United States must
raise enough money to meet its current ex
penses and increasing needs. Its revenue
should be so raised as to protect the material
interests of our people, with the lightest pos
sible drain upon their resources, and maintain
that high standard of civilization which has
distinguished our country for more than a cen
tury of its existence.
The income of the Government, I repeat,
should equal its necessary and proper expen
ditures. A failure to pursue this policy has
compelled the Government to borrow money,
in a time of peace, to sustain its credit and
pay its daily expenses. This policy should be
reversed, and that, too, as speedily as possible.
It must be apparent to all, regardless of past
party ties or affiliations, that it is our par
amount duty to provide adequate revenue for
the expenditures of the Government economi
cally and prudently administered. This the
Republican party has heretofore done, and
this I confidently believe it will do in the fu
ture, when the party is again intrusted with
power in th* executive and legislative
branches ol our Government.
The National credit, which has thus far
fortunately resisted every assault upon it, must
and will be upheld and strengthened. If
sufficient revenues are supplied for the sup
port of the Government there will be do
necessity for borrowing money and increasing
the public debt. The complaint of the people
is not against the administration for borrow
ing money and issuing bonds to preserve the
credit of the country, but against the ruinous
policy which has made this necessary, owing
to the policy which has been inaugurated.
The inevitable effect of such a policy is seen
In the deficiency in the United States treas
ury, except as it is replenished by loans, and
in the distress of the people, who are suSering
because of the scant demand for either their
labor or the products of their labor.
Here is the fundamental trouble, the remedy
for which is Republican opportunity and duty.
During all the years of Republican control fol
lowing resumption there was a steady reduc
tion of the public debt, while the gold reserve
was sacredly maintained aud our currency and
credit preserved without depreciation, taint or
suspicion. If we would restore this policy that
brought us unexampled prosperity for more
than thirty years under the most trying condi
tions ever known in this country, the policy
by which we made and bought more goods at
home and sold more abroad, the trade balante
would be quickly turned in our favor and gold
would come to us and not go from us in the
settlement of all such balances in the future.
The party that supplied, by legislation, the
vast revenues for the conduct of our greatest
war, that promptly restored the credit of the
country at its close, that from its abundant
revenues paid off a large share of the debt in
curred in this war, and that resumed specie
payments and placed our papsr currency upon
a souud and enduring basis, can be safely
trusted to preserve both our credit and cur
rency with honor, stability and inviolability.
The American people hold the financial honor
of our Government as sacred as our flag, and
can be relied upon to guard it with the same
sleepless vigilance. They hold it 3 preserva
tion above party fealty, and have often demon
strated that party ties avail nothing when the
spotless credit of our country is threatened.
The money of the United States, and every
kind or form of it, whether of paper, silver or
gold, must be as good as the best in the world.
It' must not only be current at its full face
value at home, but it must be counted at par
in any and every commercial center of the
globe. The sagacious and far-seeing policy of
the great men who founded our Goverment,
the teachings and acts of our wisest financiers
at every stage in our history, the steadfast
faith and splendid achievements of the great
party to which we belong, and the genrus and
Integrity of our people have always demanded
this and will ever maintain it. The dollar
paid to the farmer, the wage-earner and the
pensioner must continue forever equal in pur
chasing and debt-paying power to the dollar
paid to any Government creditor.
The contest this year will not be waged upon
lines of theory and speculation, but in the
light of severe practical experience and new
aud dearly acquired knowledge. The great
body of our citizens know what they want,
and that they intend to have. They know for
what the Republican party stands and what
Its return to power means to them. They
realize that the Republican party believes that
our work should be done At home and not
abroad, and everywhere proclaim their devo
tton to the principles of a protective tariff,
whicu, while supplying adequate revenues for
the Government, will restore American pro
duction and serve the best interests of Ameri
can labor and development. Our appeal
therefore is not to a false philosophy of vain
theorists, but to the masses of the American
peopie, the plain, practical people whom Lin
coln loved and trusted and whom the Repub
lican party has always faithfully striven to
serve.
The platform adopted by the National
Republican Convention has received my care
ful consideration and has my unqualified ap
proval. It is a matter of gratification to me,
as I am sure it must be to you and Republicans
everywhere, and to our people everywhere,
that the expression of its declaration of prin
ciples are so direct, clear and emphatic. They
are too plain and positive to leave any chance
for doubt or question as to their purport and
meaning. Bnt you will not expect me to dis
cuss its provisions at length or in any detail at
this time. It will, however, be my duty and
pleasure at some future day to make to you,
and through you to the great party you rep
resent, a more formal acceptance of the nomi
nation tendered me.
No one could be more profoundly grateful
than I for the manifestation of public confi
dence of which you have so eloquently spoken.
It shall be my aim to attest this appreciation
by an unsparing devotion to what I esteem
the best Interests of the people, and In this
work I ask the counsel and support of you,
gentlemen, and of every other friend of the
country. The generous expressions with
which you. sir, convoy the official notice of
my nomination sre highly appreciated and as
fully reciprocated, and I thank you and your
asssociates of the notification committee and
the great party and convention at whose in
stance you come for the high and exceptional
distinction bestowed upon me.
Major McKinley read his speech in a
clear, far-reaching voice. He was listened
to intently. He was compelled to halt
several times by reason of the loud ap
plause and cheers.
After McKinley'a speech H. H. Smith
of Michigan presented to him the gavel
used by Chairman Thurston of the St.
Louis Convention.
At the end of the speeches the notifica
tion committee sat down to luncheon,
which was served iv a large tent in tlie
rear of the lawn.
While the notification committee was at
lunch the Columbus delegation, 400 strong,
marched up. Congressman D. K. Watson
of Columbus made a speech in behalf of
the visiting delegation. Major McKinley
made a graceful response and presented
several members of the notification com
mittee. The first was Benator Thurston.
He was greeted with hearty cheers and
made a brief speech, in the course of
which he said:
"Pour years ago the Democratic party
said to the American people: 'Give us
free trade and new industries and fac
tories will open,' but they closed. They
said: 'Give us free trade and there will be
increased employment for American men."
but there was increased idleness instead.
They said: 'Give us iree trade and wajes
will rise,' but they failed to rise. They
said: 'Give us free trade and business
will boom,' but it busted. [Laugh
ter and applause.] To-day, in the
light of their past experiences it is abso
lutely necessary to abandon their old posi
tion, and they now say, 'Give us free sil
ver, and all these glorious results will fol
low.' Don't you think that in the light
of their past reputation and bankruptcy
you had better have a little collateral se
curity before you accept their new promise
of American prosperity? The Republican
party stands for a dollar in which there
shall be an American eagle, but with no
feathers dragged in the dust. [Applause.]
The Republican party declares that the
labor which is to be done for the people of
the United States shall be done by the
people of the United States, under the
Stars and Stripes." [Cheers.]
The crowd refused to disperse, so Major
McKinley introduced ex-Senator Frank
Hiscock and a number of other comniit
temen, all of whom made happy speeches.
Henry L. Wilson of the State of Wash
ington said:
"The Republicans of my section have
been deeply interested in the subject of
silver, but they recognize the fact that the
Republicans of the United States assem
bled in one magnificent parliament are
greater in their wisdom than the Repub
licans of any section."
Mark Hunna was called for frequently
and vigorously during the afternoon. He
finally appeared on the porch and said:
"I am glad to meet you all â especially the
ladies. [Cheers and laughter.] I have
listened to the distinguished gentlemen
who have addressed you with much in
terest, and who bear in mind the promises
they have made, and will see to it that
they perform their promises."
It was nearly 4 o'clock when the notifi-
cation committee left Governor McKin
ley's hospitable home.
MR. MANLEY DECLINES.
Cannot Accept the Secretaryship
of the National Executive
Committee.
CANTON, Ohio, June 29.â J. H. Manley
of Maine has written a letter declining to
be secretary of the Republican National
executive committee on the ground that
the position ought to be held by some one
more closely connected with Major Mc-
Kinley. Colonel Osborne of Boston will
probably be selected for the place. It is
understood that Mr. Quay was offered the
chairmanship of the same committee and
that he declined to accept the honor.
DISINTEGRATION CERTAIN.
f Contintied from Fint Page.\
no more rightfully demonetize one metal
than it can both: and I believe that the
constitution requires that measures shall
be adopted by Congress which will enable
the coins made from both metals to cir
culate side by side as part at least of our
medium of exchange. I believe the United
States should stand ready at ail times to
co-operate with other nations in the estab
lishment of silver as primary money
by international agreement. Ido not
believe there is any hope whatever that
further action on its part under present
conditions would result in any good. Sil
ver was demonetized by the separate and
independent action of each of the nations
that struck it down. If it is ever remone
tized that act, in my judgment, wiil be
accomplished in the same way. Some
strong nation will set the example; others
will follow."
Ex-Secretary Whitney, who is one of the
shrewdest observers in the Democratic
party, practically concedes the victory to
the silver men and the disruption of the
Democratic party.
George W. Allen, delegate at large from
Missouri, arrived this morning and took
up his quarters at the Auditorium. When
asked as to the chances of his favorite can
didate, Bland, he replied:
â¢'A silver cyclone has swept over the
country and Bland is right in the center of
it. He is the original silver man, and has
fought the battles of the friends of the
white metal for twenty-two years, having
served continually in Congress during that
time. The Missouri delegates to a man
have declared for him, and we will make a
big showing when the Bland Club arrives.
One St. Louis organization expects to send
2000 men here, and there will probably be
another thousand from other parts of the
State.
"1 do not expect Whitney's threat or
manifesto to have any very serious effect,
for he will find a different situation here
from anything that has heretofore con
fronted him. If the silver men are in con
trol, as it now seems certain tbat they will
be, they will have no trouble. The plat
form will be 16 to 1 and no compromise.
If there is a bolt from the convention it
will not amount to much. Of course the
gold men will have to bolt if they are not
willing to support the ticket, but after
they have put up as mnch of a front as
possible I expect they will drop into line.
The actual hard work at our headquarters
will begin Wednesday; from then we will
be a part of the show. Next Monday night
we will have a big parade and the dele
gates can form some idea of Eland's
strength."
Senator Shelby M. Cullom said that the
Democrats were going to make fools of
themselves just as they did in 1872:
"Thcv â â¢ ill resolve in favor of free and
unUm i.iage and they will nominate
some crunk. I don't know which crank,
but some one out of the numerous herd â
and then their party goes to pieces. The
Easterners will not stand the silver non
sense and, although we will lose some
votes and some of the Western States, we
will gain ten votes where we will lose one,
and McKinley will be elected by an over
whelming majority."
John Paul Cosgravi.
APPEASING THE KNIGHTS.
Boles' Boomers Say Their Candi
date Is All Right With the
Labor Element.
CHICAGO, 111., June 29.â One of the
incidents of the day was a conference of C.
A. Walsh, secretary of the lowa State Cen
tral Committee and a delegate-at-large,
with Grand Master Workman Sovereign of
the Knights of Labor, with reference to
the reported antagonism of the knights
and other labor organizations toward Mr.
Boies on account of his public utterances
at the time of the great railway strike,
upholding the action of President Cleve
land in sending soldiers to Chicago. The
Boies boomers are also said to be con
cerned because they had beard of a peti
tion which was being signed by Chicago
Democrats, addressed to the county cen
tral committee, urging them to take up
arms against Boies on that account, for
the purpose of keeping the Illinois delega
tion away from lowa's candidate.
Neither party to the conference would
speak as to the result, but the Boies men
said everything was all right with the
labor people, and Mr. Walsh said: "There
is absolutely no truth ia these stones
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JVJSK 3U, 189(5.
about trouble between Mr. Boies and or
ganized labor. Mr. Boies has been a good
and consistent friend of labor, and he will
have the unstinted support of that ele
ment."
Ex-Mayor Hopkins, one of the gold
standard leaders in Cook County, said to
day that the gold men would appear
before tne National committee on creden
tials and demand the seating of their dele
gates in cases where contests existed.
Ex-Senator John Martin, chairman of
the Kansas delegation , arrived to-day from
Topeka. He would not say what candi
date he favored, but declared the nominee
would be a straight out free-silver man.
Ha exclaimed as to the two-thirds ma
jority rule for the election of a nominee:
"If I had my way about it the two -thirds
rule would not last a minute. The ma
jority ought to rule. It is all a mistake to
say that this rule is fastened on the party
forever. The precedent was established in
1844 and then it was done to defeat Van
Buren as a trick. Kansas is a unit for free
silver. There was some gold Democrats in
our State, but they were squarely beaten
and in a manly way acknowledged it."
Congressman Towley said, when asKed
about the silver men's attitude toward
the two-thirds rule: "I think the two
thirds rule will stand. We can control
two-thirds of the voting delegates. I
think there is no ground for the apprehen
sion aroused on that score."
The figures compiled by the Bland
managers gave ninety-eight delegates in
structed for the "silver-dollar" man, 123
pledged and 151 whom they have ' ; reason
to expect" will support him, Kentucky
and Ohio being credited in the Bland col
umn on the second ballot. This makes a
total of 372 votes claimed for Bland on the
second ballot.
ALLOTTING THE SPACE.
All the Claimants for Seats In the
Convention Cannot Ba
Accommodated.
CHICAGO, 111., June 2Â«. â Messrs.
Sheerin, Pratber, Sherley, Wall and Wal
lace of the National sub-committee spent
part of the day at tho Colisseum, allotting
the space to be used by tne press associa
tions and the telegraph companies under
the platform, and the "working press"
section, where provision has been made
for 428 seats. To-morrow the troublesome
work of assigning the number of seats to
be given the newspapers* of the country
will engross the whole time of the sub
committee which has that in charge.
"There are 2000 applications for these
423 seats," said Committeeman Wallace of
Washington to the United Press reporter
to-night, "and there will be plenty of dis
appointed ones."
Senator Turpie of Indiana arrived at the
Palmer House this evening as the advance
agent of Governor Claude Matthews. He
came also to attend the meeting of the
National bimetallic committee of the
party, being a member of the central exec
utive committee. He had nothing new to
say as io the strength aud position of Indi
ana's candidate for the Presidency, and
in what he did say of the party situation
financially he was "silver tongued."
To the company of distinguished Demo
crats at the Sherman House was added to
night Senator Isham G. Harris of Tennes
see, chairman of the bimetallic corurni tee.
Two of the bolting Republican Senators,
Pettigrew of South Dakota and Dubois of
Idaho, were late arrivals at the Great
Northern Hotel. They are here ostensibly
in the interest of their leader ia the seces
sion movement, Senator Teller, but they
did not say anything new on that line for
publication. The Idaho Senator sent a
message to Governor Altgeld asking for a
meeting, and there will probably be one
held to-morrow with the Illinois Demo
cratic silver leaders, when the caucus of
the Illinos delegation comes off, to decide
on the general plan of action in the con
vention.
PENNOYER IN THE RACE.
Oregon Delegates Will Present His
Name for the Nomination at
Chicago.
PORTLAND, Or., June 21).â Oregon's
eight delegates to the National Democratic
Convention at Chicago will very likely
present the name of ex-Governor Sylvester
Pennoyer for the Presidency. It depends
upon his chances for the nomination,
which himself admits are slim. But if the
fight between Bland, Boise and Sibley ties
up the convention and there is a chance
to work Pennoyer in as a compromise
candidate it will be done.
The chief fight for Pennoyer will be
made for the Vice-Presidential nomina
tion. The delegates consider that he
stands the best chance and will argue that
he is the natural connecting link v?ith the
Populists. He has just been elected
Mayor of Portland by a large plurality,
which gives him greater strength. Speak
ing about the nomination to-day he said:
"I am not seeking the nomination, be
cause there is little chance for a Western
man, but there is an opportunity to secure
the Vice-Presidential nomination."
Five of the Oregon delegates, who con
trol the eight through the unit rule, favor
Sibley of Pennsylvania for first place, if
there ia no hope for Pennoyer. Unless
some deal concerning Pennoyer for the
Vice- Presidency is made at Chicago, they
will vote for Sibley. Their first choice for
the ticket is Pennoyer and Sibley, while
their second choice is Sibley and Pennoyer.
They are all opposed to the nomination of
Teller, insisting that the Democratic Con
vention must name a Democrat. All are,
of course, for free silver, and will vote for
such platform as Populists and silver Re
publicans will endorse.
ARMS RETIKEMENTS.
Several Pretiaio Officer* Mutt Undergo
J'hygical txntnination.
WASHINGTON. D. C, June 29.âCap
tain Healy of the Bear, who was recently
suspended from the revenue cutter ser
vice, has asked for leave of absence from
the United States. It is his intention to
visit St. Petersburg, Rus9ia.
It is understood in army circles that in
furtherance of the policy of the War De
partment to find places in the army for
West Point graduates a large number of
officers will soon be ordered before medi
cal boards with a view to their retirement
on appearance of physical disability. Sev
eral officers of the Fifth Artillery, sta
tioned at the Presidio of San Francisco,
will be ordered before the board.
Lieutenant Lucien Young will leave here
Thursday for San Francisco, whence he
will sail for China to join the cruiser De
troit, to which he will be attached for the
next two years at least.
Iron aud Steel Wage Scale,
PITTSBURG, Pa., June 29.â The iron
and steel sheet wage scale was agreed upon
and signed by the manufacturers and
workers to-day. A3 finally settled the
scale is substantially the same as last year,
although some modifications relating to
the extras were made. The conference
was harmonious. ,

ARE SKURRYING
TOWARD CHICAGO.
Silver Men Will Watch the
the Proceedings of the
Democrats.
BIG MOVES TO BE MADE.
Important Conferences of the Bi
metallic Leaders Are
Arranged.
SENATOR STEWART SILENT..
But Ha Will Net Overlook Anything
That Will Benefit White-
Metal Champions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 29.â The
coming week is going to be an eventful
one politically. Many important moves
will be made on the great political checker
board.
Skurrying toward Chicago to-day are
Governor John P. Altgeld of Illinois, Who Will Be a Powerful Factor in
Naming the Democratic Presidential Candidate.
many political leaders of both sides, but
the majority of them are silver men, billed
to take part in various conferences during
the week. The first of these conferences
will be held to-morrow. It will be made
up of membsrs of the Democratic Bimetal
lic League, of which Senator Harris is
chairman, and one member of each State
delegation. Senator Harris left here last
night for Chicago. He declined to talk
about his plans or plans of silver men.
The meeting to-morrow was called some
time ago by Senator Jones of Arkansas.
The purpose of it is to go over the situa
tion and compare views. No effort, it is
tnoupht, will be made to tnrn the confer
ence into a machine for the benefit of any
man. The most important thing to be
considered will be how best to resist the
fight to be made by the gold-standard
men under Whitney's leade:s iip, and
how best to unite the various silver ele
ments under the Democratic banner. This
is the most perplexing question before the
silver men. They want the support of sil
ver Republicans, Populists and all classes
of silver men, and the object of various
conferences throughout the coming week
will be to decide the best plan to attain
this end without sacrHicipg the principles
of the Democratic party.
The silver Democrats can easily find out
what the Populists and silver Republi
cans want. The leaders of these parties
will be in Chicago in droves. Senator
Stewart will leave here lor Chicago to
morrow. *
Dr. Mott, chairman of the American
Silver Organization, will be there to-mor
row or next day. He has called a meet
ing of the National Committee of his
party to be held in Chicago. The object of
the meeting is to lay before the Demo
cratic silver leaders what they want.
It is even said that the committee will
be on hand when the nomination is made
co as to at once decide what will be the
course of the silver party. General War
ner, tne head of the same party, will also
be on hand. Senators Dubois and Cannon
and Representatives Allen, Hartman and
Towne are expected to De either close to
Chicago or in close communication with
that city.
Representative Hartman's plan some
lime ago was to take several hundred
Western silver Republicans to tne conven
tion. Thera will be hundreds of silver
men in Chicago from now on who are not
delegates. They will be there to confer
with the silver majority in the conven
tion. The gold-standard leaders will not
show up in large numbers till the end of
the week, unless they change their plans.
Mr. Whitney will leave New York Thurs
day.
It is noticeable that all talk of com
promise comes from gold-standard men.
So far not a silver leader has given out a
word advocating compromise of any kind.
There is a strong feeling among such men
as Governor Altgeld and Senator Tiliman
that it would benefit the Democratic
ticket to have the gold men bolt tne con
vention. That's what they want, they
say. It would remove all doubt, they claim,
that the gold men had anything to do
with naming the nominee.
There is again talk about the gold men
picking up Vice- President Stevenson as
the compromise candidate. This talk was
indulged in months ago. The opinion of
Colonel William R. Morrison is that a sil
ver man will be named. They rather think
it will be Boies or Bland.
"Senator Stewart will remain at Chicago
until the Democratic Convention has acted,
when he will pass judgment on the plat
form and nominees. He talked freely to
night, strongly advocating the nomination
of Teller or of Sibley. It will be observed,
however, from somewhat cautions remarks
of the Senator that he does not say he will
not support Bland or Boies, or whoeter
else may be the nominee of the
convention. He favors Teller first, but
does not declare that if Teller or Sibley is
not nominated, he will favor another
nominee by the combined silver conven
tion which meet at St. Louis July 22. and
to which he is a delegate from Nevada.
The Senator, it is thought, is placing him
self where he can watch developments
after the convention.
Senator Stewart declined to discuss the
proposition to give the Populists and sil
ver Republicans the second place on the
Democratic ticket. C. C. Cablton.
MINISTER FOUANS RETUEN.
Retires to a Hospital in Search of
Rett.
NEW 'tfORK, N. V., June 29.â General
Pierce M. Young, Minister to Honduras
and Guatemala, arrived here on the
steamer Advance last Monday, stayed one
day at the Hotel Marlborough and then
went to the Presbyterian Hospital. He
took all precautions to keep his presence
in the city a secret. At the hospital he
gave instructions tbat all questioners
should be informed that he was seeking
rest.
General Young is about 60 years of age,
and distincuished himself during the
Civil War. In 1885 he was appointed Con
sul-General to St. Petersburg by President
Cleveland, but resigned after remaining i
there for two years. In 1893 President
Cleveland appointed him Minister to the
two Central American States.
For the Murder of Ilia Wife.
ATLANTA, Ga.. June 29.â John Mc-
Cullough, a farmer in Clayton County, was

CAPSIZED ON THE LAKE,
Boys in a Beat Meet With a
Fatal Disaster on Mas
sapoag.
One Lad Rescues Another, but Others
Are Drowned During the
Confusion.
SHARON, Mass., June 20.â What was
intended to be a week's enjoyable outing
was brought to an abrupt and sad close at
Lake Massapoag this afternoon. Assistant
Pastor Rev. Joseph Maxwell, Choir
master Frederick Brackett, Clerk George
R. Keyes and sixteen choirboys of St.
John's Episcopal Church, Charlestown,
came to Sharon by team to-day to camp
out at LaKe Massapoag for a week. After
dinner Mr. Brackett and six of the boys
went out in a boat. A little boy named
Parker fell overboard. Frank Cox, a
bright little fellow of 13, immediately
jumped after him, swam ashore, got a rope
and by means of it, saved the Parker boy,
but in the confusion resulting from the
accident the boat was overturned and Mr.
Brackett and the four other boys were
thrown in the water. None of the party
save the Cox boy could swim, and before
help could reach them from the shore all
five were drowned:
The names of the drowned are: Fred
wrick Brackett, Thomas Parker, Harry
Lacker, William S. Atkins, Benjamin
Gibbs.
FOUR HOTS GROWNED.
Sad Accident on the Wattr front of
Boston.
BOSTON, Mass., June 29.â One of the
sadest accidents in the history of the Bos
ton water front occurred at Castle Island,
off City Point, this afternoon. At about
2:30 o'clock seventy-five children were on
a rickety, unsafe gangplank and float at
the landing south of the bridge from the
point to the island, when the flaat over
turned, the ilimsy guard rails of the gang
plank split and thirty or more of the chil
dren were tumbled into the wafer. Four
boys were drowned, four children were
picked up unconscious and later revived,
and the others as far as known were s-aved.
The dead are: James S. Washburn, 9
years of age; James F. Cole, 11 years;
Lawrence McDowell, 12 years; an un
known lad of about 12 years.
The injured are: Lillian Duffy, 11 years;
Hnrry Sampson, 10 years.
To-day was to be observed as Farragut
day in South Boston, and in honor of the
event the South Boston Historical Society
had distributed a large number of buttons
r.mong the children, entitling them to a
free ride on a steamer from City Point
to Castle Island. As a result tiie
little steamer was crowded on her trips
during the afternoon, and so early did the
fush begin that the police force detailed
for afternoon duty at Castle Island had
not arrived when the little steamer Ella,
Captain E. W. Weber, arrived at the float
with a big list of children passengers from
the point at 2:30 o'clock and began to un
load them on the float just as fifty chil
dren on the granite pier started on a ran
down the gangplank to go aboard. The
two crowds met, the float upset, the gang
plant split aud the accident occurred.
Killed by a Trolley Car.
ATLANTA, Ga., June 29. â Herman
Franklin, 17 years old, was killed by a
trolley-car at Pryor and Mitchell streets
to-day. The boy was on hia bicycle and
went down the Mitchell hill rapidly, as he
wag on his way to a doctor to have hi-
hand dressed, which had just been cut.
He did not see the Pryor-street car until
it was within a few feet of him. He could
not swerve out of the way. and endeav
ored to cross the track in front of the
car. It struck liiru and crushed him to
death.
MR. BAYARD SPEAKS AGAIN.
Unveiling Ceremony in England in When
the Embassador and Many Americans
Participated.
LONDON, Exglaxp, June 29. â The town
of Gainsborough, in Lincolnshire, was the
scene to-day of a ceremony of interest to
Americans. This was the unveiling of a
memorial stone in the John Kobinson
Church, so named after the Rev. John
Kobinson, "Pastor of the Pilgrim Fathers,"
who, after severing his connection with
the established church in 1614, connected
himself with a body of dissenters in Gains
borough.
Among those present were the Hon.
Thomas F. Bayard, American Ambassa
dor, and the American Pilgri.ns, who
recently arrived in England for the pur
pose of visiting scenes of interest con
nected with the Pilgrims.
When Mr. Bayard arrived he was pre
sented with an address of welcome from
the Municipal Council, in reply to which
he repeated the sentiments heretofore ex
pressed by him, and said that the entente
between the United States and Great
Britain was strengthened by such occa
sions as the present.
He added tiiat if there was anything un
patriotic in the sentiment he gave voice
to, he was willing to meet and answer any
charge that might be made against him.
At iunciieon, after the toast oi "The !
Queen" had been drunK, Earl Brownlow,
Lord Lieutenat <>f Lancashire, pror>osed
the toast, "Tne President of the United
States," to which Embassador Bayard
made a felicitous response. He said there
could be no higher aim for Anglo- American
statesmanship than to preserve the condi
tions existing between America and Great
Britain.
DECEIVED BY A. WIDOW.
Postal Authorities Take a Hand in a
iSpoiled Romance.
NEW ORLEANS, La., June 29. â A
unique violation of the postal law has been
developed. Postoffice Inspector Dye, in
charge of this division, received a com
plaint against Mrs. Sophie Hoffman, a
widow of Austin, Tex., charging that some
time ago she beguiled a young man of an
other State by letter-writing to fall in love
with her. Photographs were exchanged
and marriage agreed upon. Unaware that
she was violating section 334 of the postal
laws, relative to using the mails for im
proper purposes, she rea nested her fiancee
to send railroad fare and funds for other
necessary expenses, so that she might
meet him and be married. The money
was sent, and at that moment the widow,
the young man claims, was as mute as the
harp that hung on Tara's wall. The de
ceived man put the matter in the bands
of the postoffice authorities, and Mrs. Hoff
man was arrested at Austin by Inspector
Woods and is now in jail.
Marred by Accident.
BOSTON, Mass.. June 29.â The steamer
Servia sailed for England to-day with one
of the largest and most expensive excur
sions that ever left America. It carried
the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Com
pany of Boston, which will be entertained
by the Anoient and Honorable Artillery
Company of London, of which the Prince
of Wales is commander.
A bad accident marred the departure of
the excursion. At City Park, South Bos
ton, this afternoon, a wharf, upon which a
large number of persons had gathered to
view thedeparture of the Servia, collapsed,
precipitating thirty persons into the water.
Two were drowned, but all the Others
were saved. Suveral were badly hurt, two
fatally.

OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.
" Reunion of All the Christian
Churches "Is the Text of
the Letter.
A REPLY Tf MR. GLADSTONE.
The Document Is Addressed to All
Bishops in Communion With
the Holy See.
BALTIMORE, Mb., June 29.â Cardinal
Gibbois gave to the press this evening a
copy ->f the summary of Pope Leo's en
cyclical letter on the reunion of all the
Cnrstian churches. His Holiness evi
dently had in mind the recent letter of
rim. William E. Gladstone, the English
statesman and churchman, and the letter
/jay be considered a reply thereto.
His Eminence received the advance
sheets of this very important document on
Saturday, and personally directed its
translation. The letter, at the Pope's re
quest, will be given publicity throughout
Lurope and America to-morrow.
The encyclical i.Â» addressed by his Holi
ness. Pope Leo XIII, to all Bishops in
communion with the Holy See. The ab
stract follows :
"he Holy Father, intent upon the work of
bringing all to the one fold of Christ, con
sic ers that it would conduce to that end were
hf to set before the peoples of the Christian
world the ideal and exemplar of the church as
divinely constituted, to which church all are
xiund by God's command to belong.
In accordance with his usual providence,
God makes use of human instruments to effect
the sanctiflcation and elevation of men. To
â hig end not only did he take upon himself
human nature, but in order to perpetuate his
mission thÂ« Son of God chose apostles and
disciples whom he had trained that they
might faithfully hand down his teachings and
commands to those who desired the blessings
he had purchased for mankind by his death.
In commanding "the apostles and their suc
cessors to the end of time to teach and rule the
nations, he ordered the nations to accept and
obey their authority.
In Scripture the chun n is called a "body,"
and the body of Christ. It is visible as being
a living and organized society and is animated
by the invisible vital principle of supernat
ural life. Those, therefore, who either deny
that Christ's church is a visible body or refuse
to allow that it has "tho perennial communi
cation of the gifts of divine grace" are equally
"in a grievous and pernicious error." The
"connection and union of both elements is as
absolutely necessary to the true church as the
intimate union of the soul and body Is to
human nature, and as this is the essential
constitution of the church, according to God's
Trillâ \. H ** *Ui* .l*-r-Â»>rr> i n..ii that If las? till the
end of time â this it must possess at the present
day.
It is obviously of the first importance to de
termine what Christ wished his church to be
and what in fact he made it. According to this
criterion it is the unity of the Christian
church which must necessarily be considered,
for it is certain that "he who founded it wished
it to be one."
The mission of Christ was to cave "not some
nations or peoples only, but the whole human
race, without distinction of time or place."
Hence, as the mission of his church was to
hand down through every age the blessing of
this salvation by the will of its founder, it is
necessary that this church should be one in
al! lands and at all times.
"A church which should embrace all men,
everywhere and at all times, was clearly fore
told by the prophet Isaiah and was typified in
our Lord's mystical body â a body united to
himself as head; a mystical body, the members
of which if separated one from the other can
not be united with one and the same heed,"
and so another heal like the Christ is another
Christ and must be invented, if besides the
one church, which is his body, men wish to
set up another.
Furthermore, "He who made this one church
also gave it unity; that is, he made it such
that all who are to belong to it must be united
by the closest bonds bo as to form one society,
one kingdom, one body." And he willed that
this unity among his followers should be so
perfect "that it might in some measure shadow
forth the union between himself and his
lather."
As a necessary consequence, in his divine
wisdom, he ordained in his church unity of
faithâ a virtue which is the first of those bonds
which unite man to God and whence we re
ceive the name oi the faithful. The nature of
this unity of faith must andean be ascertained
from the commands and teachings of Christ
himself. The mere possession of the Scrip
tures is not sufficient to insure unity of belief,
"not merely because of the nature of the doc
trine itself and the mysteries it involves, but
also because of the divergent tendencies of
the human mind and the disturbing element
of conflicting passions."
"It was necessary that there should bean
other principle" to insure union of minds in
the Christian church, and it is consequently
proper to inquire which of the many means
by which Christ our Lord could have secured
this unity he in fact adopted.
It is the duty of all followers of Christ not
merely to accept his doctrines generally, "but
to assent with their entire mind to all and
every point of it, since it is unlawful to with
hold faith from God, even in regard to the one
single point."
Christ endowed his apostles with authority
like to his own and promised that the spirit of
truth should direct them and remain with
them forever, and because of this commission
"it is no more allowable to repudiate one iota
'f the apostles' teaching than to reject any
I>oint of the doctrine of Christ himself."
This apostolic mission was intended for the
salvation of the whole human race, and conse
quently must last to the end oi time. The
magisterium instituted by Christ in his church
was by 'iod's will perpetuated in the successors
appointed by the apostles, and in like manner
the duty of accepting and professing all that
is thus taught is also "perpetual and immu
table."
There is Bothing which the church founded
on those principles he has been more careful
to guard than the integrity of the faith. The
fathers of the church are unanimons in con
sidering as oiustde the Catholic communion
any one who in the least degree deviates from
even one point of the doctrine proposed by the
authoritative magisterium ol the church.
Wherefore Christ instituted in the church a
living authoritative and lasting magisterium.
He willed and commanded under the gravest
penalties that its teachings should be received
as if they were his own. As often, therefore,
as it is declared on the authority of this teach
ing that this or that is contained in the de
posit of divine revelation, it must be believed
by everyone as true.
The very nature of divine faith makes it im
possible that we can reject even one point of
direct teaching, as this is practically rejecting
the authority of God himself.
Christ commanded the men, present and
future, to follow him as their leader and
Savior, and thus, not merely as individuals,
but as iormiug & society organised and united
n srind, he established in the church all
th^se principles which necessarily tend to
irake organized human societies and through
vhich they attain the perfection to each ; that
in ihe church founded by Christ "all who
wished to be the sons of God by adoption
might attain to perfection demanded by their
high calling and might obtain salvation."
The church is "man's guide to whatever per
tains to heaven. This is the office appointed
to it by God: That it may watch over and
may order all that concerns religion and may
without let or hinderance exercise according
to its judgment its charge over Christianity.
Wherefore they who pretend that the church
has any wish to interfere in civil matters or to
infringe upon the rights of the state either
know it not or wickedly calumniate it."
Besides being the guardian of faith, the
church must afford the means of obtaining
the salvation purchased by Christ. The dis
pensation of the divine mysteries was not
granted by God indiscriminately to all Chris
tians, but the Apostles and their successors,
and, In this way, according to God's provi
dence, duly constituted society "was formed
oufrof the divided multitudes of peoplesâ one
in faith, one in end, one in the participation
of the means adapted to the attainment of the
end, and one a subject to one and the same
authority."
"As no true and perfect human society can
be conceived which is not governed by some
supreme authority," so Christ of necessity
gave to his church a supreme authority to
which all Christians must be obedient. For
the preservation of unity there must be unity
of government Jure divino, and men may be
placed outside the one fold by schism as well
as by heresy.
The nature of this supreme authority can be
ascertained from the.positive and evident will
of Christ. As he willed that his kingdom
should be visible, Christ was obliged to desig
nate a vice-gerent on earth in the person of St.
Peter. He also determined that the authority
given to him for the salvation of mankind in
perpetuity should be inherited by St. Peter's
successors.
It cannot be doubted from the words ot Ho:y
Writ that the church by the will of God rests
on St. Peter as a building on its foundation.
St. Peter could not fulfill this duty "without
the power of commanding, forbidding, judg
ing, which is properly called jurisdiction." it
is by the power of jurisdiction that nations
and commonwealths are held together. A
primacy of honor and the shadowy right of
giving advice and admonition, which is called
direction, could never be unity or strength to
any society of men.
The metaphorical expressions of "the keys"
and of "binding and loosing" indicate the
power of making laws, of judging and punish
ing â a power which our Lord declares to be of
such amplitude and force "that God would
ratify whatever is decreed by it."
Thus the power of St. Peter is "supreme and
absolutely independent, so that having no
other power on earth as its superior, it em
braces the whole church and all things com
mitted to the church." As the governing
authority belongs to the constitution and
formation of the church as the very principle
of unity and stability, it was clearly intended
to pass to St. Peter's successors from one to
another. Consequently the Pontiffs who suc
ceed him in the Roman episcopate reserve the
supreme power in the church jure divino. and
this is declared fully by general councils and
is acknowledged by the consent of antiquity.
But though the authority of St. Peter and his
successors is plenary and supreme, it is not to
be regarded as the only authority. The
Bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles,
"inherit their ordinary power," and "the epis
copal order necessarily belopgs to the essential
constitution of the church." They are con
sequently not to be regarded as mere vicars of
the Roman Pontiffs, since "they exercise a
power which is really their own, and are most
truly called the ordinary pastors of the people
over whom they rule."
For the preservation of unity in the Chris
tian church, it is above all things necessary
that there should be union between the
Roman Pontiff, the one successor of St. Peter,
and the Bishops, the many successors of the
apostolic college. "It is Decesstry to bear in
mind that no prerogative was conferred on the
Apostles in which St. Peter did not participate,
but that many were bestowed upon St. Peter
apart from the Apostles."
â¢â¢Hu alone was designated by Christ as the
foundation of his church. To him he gave the
power of forgiving and retaining, and to him
alone was given the authority to leed."
From this it follows "that Bishops are de
prived of the right and power of ruling if they
deliberately secede from Peter and his suc
cessors, because by this secession they are sep
arated from the foundation upon which the
whole edifice rests."
As the divine founder of the church decreed
that his church should be one in faith, in
government and communion, so he chose Peter
and his successors as the principle, and, as it
were, the center of this unity. "The episco
pal order is rightly judged to be in com
munion with Peter as Christ commanded, if
it is subject to and obeys Peter; otherwise it
necessarily becomes a lawless and disorderly
crowd."
For the due preservation of unity of the
faith it is not sufficient "that the head should
have Deen charged merely with the office of
superintendent or should have been invested
solely with the power of direction, but it is
absolutely necessary that he should have re
ceived real and sovereign authority, which
the whole community is bound to obey."
It is opposed to the truth and is in evident
contradiction with the divine constitution of
the church to hold that while each Bishop is
individually bound to obey the authority of
the Roman Pontiffs, the iÃshops, taken collect
ively, are not so bound. For it is the nature
and essence of a foundation to support the
unity of the whole edifice and to give stability
to it rather than to each component part. It
was through "the strength and solidity of the
foundation" that Christ promised that the
gates of hell should not prevail aeainst his
churchâ & promise to be understood of the
church as a whole, and not of any certain por
tions of it.
Moreover, he who is iet over the flock must
have authority not only over the sheep dis
persed throughout the church, but also when
they are assembled together. Do all the sheep
gathered together rule and guide the shep
h.rd? Do the successors of the Apostles as
sembled together constitute the foundation on
which the successor of St. Peter rests, in order
to derive therefrom strength ana stability T
The Popes have ever unquestionably exer
cised the office of ratifying or rejecting the de
crees of councils. "Leo the Great rescinded
the acts oi the Conciliabulum of Ephesus.
Damascus rejected those of Rimini and Adrian
I those of Constantinople. The twenty-eighth
canon of the Council of Chalcedon, by the very
fact that it lacks the assent and approval of
the Apostolic See, is admitted by all to be
worthless."
Holy Writ attests that the keys of the King
dom ot Heaven were given to Peter alone and
that the promise of binding and loosing was
granted to the Apostles and to Peter, but there
is nothing to show that the Apostles received
supreme power without Peter or against Peter.
Such power they certainly did not receive from
Jesus Christ; wherefore, in the decree of the
Vatican Council as to the nature and authority
of the primacy of the Roman Pontiff no newly
conceived opinion is set forth, but the vener
able and constant belief of all ages.
RELIGION IS POLITICS.
Leading Liberal* of Montreal Will Send
a Protest to Rome.
MONTREAL, Quebec. June 29.â Leading
Liberals of this province contemplate
sending a delegate to Rome with a view
to having a decision from the Vatican re
garding clerical influence in this country.
Friends of the Hon. Mr. Laurier declare
that the action of Monsignor Lafleche and
other members of the Roman Catholic
clergy during the recent electoral cam
paign renders an appeal to Rome at the
present time an absolute necessity.
May Force an Apology.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 29.âAd
ministration officials here are discussing
the probability of forcing an apology from
the United States of Colombia for the ont
rape committed on the schooner George R.
Whitford of New York. If necessary a
naval demonstration will be made. It is
possible also that Secretary Olney may de
mand an indemnity for the owners of the
Wnitford because of her detention. So fiir

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 1896.
THE PITTSTON
MINE HORROR,
Not Less Than Seventy
Men Entombed in the
Deadly Pit.
HOPING AGAINST HOPE.
Families and Friends of the
Victims Haunt the Mouth of
the Shaft
CAVES OCCUR CONTINUOUSLY.
Rescuers Say It Will Be Impossible
to Ever Recover Any of the
Bodies.
WILKESBARfiE, Pa., June 29.â The
situation at the scene of the Pittston mine
disaster remains practically unchanged.
The company is making every possible
effort to reach the victims, but there is
very little hope that any of them will be
recovered alive.
It is not yet possible to give the exact
number of persona in the pit, but it is
certain that there are not less than seventy
men entombed, leaving about forty-eight
widows and 125 orphans.
The Board of Trade of Pittston to-day
appropriated $1000 for the immediate wants
of the bereft families, and desires through
the United Press to appeal to the charitably
disposed at home and abroad for such aid
as tney may be pleased to contribute to
this very worthy object. Contributions
may be forwarded to Mr. Thomas Mangan,
treasurer of the Board of Trade of Pitts
ton, Pa.
The frienda and relatives of the en
tombed men haunted to-day and to-night
the head of the shaft, hoping against hope
that some of the rescuing party may bring
up a word of cheer. But as one gang after
another reached the surface and answered
the eager questions with only a sad snake
of the head despair was again shown upon
the countenances of the unhappy ones.
The rescuing party that went into the
shaft this morning came up at 6 o'clock
this evening, and as they jumped from
the carriage the foreman was heard to say,
"No hope of rescue as yet."
Later on it was learned that the situa
tion inside is changing almost hourly,
owing to the continuous caving or "squeez
ing." and on this account nothing what
ever can be told as to when the men can
be reached.
The rescuing party to-night were work
ing their way to the point where they
wished to start digging to-morrow morn- I
ing, but at midnight the props and pillars .
in the shaft are being forced out of place |
and no progress can be made until after
this difficulty can be averted. Monster
pumps were lowered and will be set as j
near as possible to the scene of death, but '
there is no telling what the pumps will be
abie to do.
Men are at work drilling a hole through
the Clear Spring colliery into the Twin
Shaft workings. The men started on Sun
day to cut a hole through large enough to
admit a man's body, but the officials
feaied the water and gas in the Twin Shaft
would rush into the Clear Spring and cause
disaster to those workings also, so it was
decided to abandon the work of making so
large a hole and to merely drill a small
bore-hole through the eighty feet of coal
for the double purpose ot finding out the
condition of the Twin Shaft workings as to
water and gas and with the idea of com
municating with the men if they, or any
of them, should chance to be on the oppo
site side of the cave, next to the Clear
Spring's partition.
Prominent mine officials from all parts
of the country were on the scene to-day
discussing the sad disaster from every
standpoint.
A conference was held during the day at
which reports were made to the effect that
the fall is the largest ever known to any
miner in this valley, and that the cave is
still going on. Among the officials who
were present were: Mine-Inspector Blow
itt of Scranton; Anthony Horn, superin
tendent of the Pennsylvania Coal Com
pany, Pitiston; Superintendent Davis of
the Dodson Coal Company of Plymouth;
H. H. Ashley, general manager of the
Parish Coal Company, Wilkesbarre; J. L.
Cake, manager of the Clear Spring Coal
Company, West Pittston, and J. Bennett
Smith, practical engineer of the Hazard
Works, Wilkesbarre. Most of them have
come to the conclusion that the bodies will
never be reached.
Water has been running into the shaft
since yesterday, and to-day it has in
creased in volume. Both the Lackawanna
and Susquehanna rivers run in close prox
imity to the Twin Shaft. From the sur
face to the point where the rock begins
there is at least 145 feet of what is known
as river wash. Prom this point down to
the bottom, or the level where the men
are, there were previous to the fall 280 feet
of rock. As long as this remained intact
there was perhaps more leakage through
the crevice into the mine than in mines
which are not in such close proximity to
large bodies of water. When tne fall oc
curred the 280 feet of rock referred to must
have been shattered, allowing the water to
pour into the mine in large quantities un
til the open space below was all filled.
The very natural conclusion of this is
that if the victims did not lose their lives
under the fail they came to their death by
drowning. If this be true, and there is no
reason to doubt that it is, it will be im
possible to remove the bodies of the vic
tims from the mine.
When it became known to-night that it
was probable the men would never be
found the excitement was renewed. The
rescuing party that came out of the shaft
at 10 o'clock reported the situation
worse than at any time to-day. The
workings are crushed nearer the foot of
the shaft and the outlook is very sorrow
ful. The night shift of rescuers were
driven back by the roof caving in and
closing up the work that had been accom
plished during the afternoon. It is now
feared that the opening or entrance to the
Twin Shaft may be closed before the next
twenty-four hours.
More props were lowered into the pit
to-night, which wili be placed around the
pillars Co aid them in keeping the surface
from caving in near the foot.
What the night will bring forth no liv
ing soul can tell.
liannrrt to an Oak Tree.
NEW ORLEANS, La., June 29.â Yester-
day morning Frederick Posi was found
hanging to a large oak tree on a planta
tion near the boundary line between St.
Charles and Jefferson parishes, just above
New Orleans. He had been lynched last
nignt by a mob. Post had a fight a lew
days ago at the store of Paul Felix, Mayor
of Kenner, with one of Felix's clerks. He
was arrested and charged wilh breach of
the peace and assault and battery. He
was locked up in ttie Kenner jail. It is
said that the doors of the jail were not
properly fastened, so that the mob had no
difficulty in breaking into it and taking
out Post and lynching him.
COAST DEFENSE WORK.
Money Available and. Operation* to Be
i'onttn-r.red at Once.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 29.â The
work of constructing the coast defenses
authorized by Congress will begin with
the fiscal year, July. Preliminary ar
rangements for carrying out the projects
contemplated have been made by General
Craighill, the chief of engineers, and one
half of the $5,000,000 available under the
law will be expended immediately under
plans already approved. The remaining
amount will be expended by contract.
All important points along the Atlantic
Coast and the Gulf of Mexico from Port
land, Maine, to Galveston, Texas, and on
tne Pacific Coast from Puget Sound and
the mouth of the Columbia River and San
Diego, Cal., will be fortified under the
present arrangement. As soon as these
projects are under way, bids for the work
to be done by contract will be called for.
GROWING GEAPERATE.
Cleveland Striker* Beat Men Who Return
to Work.
Cleveland, Ohio, June 29.â The
strike at the Brown Hoisting Company's
works, involving 500 men, has been in
progress five weeks, and no settlement
seems in sight. The strikers are growing
desperate and the location of the works is
such that the police are unable to do
effective work. Every day the few men
who have returned to work have to be
escorted to and from work by officers or
they are set upon and beaten. Martin
Schauez, one of the men who returned to
work, was set upon as he left the works to
night and beaten so that he will die.
A TERRIBLE EXPLOSION,
Three Persons Killed by the
Bursting of a Boiler in
Texas.
The General Manager of the Southern
Pacific's Atl ntic System Is
Badly Injured.
HOUSTON, Tex., June 29.â This after
noon the boiler in the office of the Daily
Age exploded, killing Engineer Henry
Lyons, Miss Mattie Loeb. a stenographer
in the office of W. Gt. Van Vleck, vice
president and general-manager of the
Atlantic system of the Southern Pacific
Railroad; Edward R. Emory, a telegraph
operator in the same office, and seriously
injuring Mr. Van Vleck himself.
The force of the explosion carried the
entire boiler, which was of 18-hor3epower,
across a vacant lot, where it struck a
building, was deflected upward and
crashed into the general office of the
Southern Pacific system on Franklin
avenue, over 300 feet away.
Mr. Van Vleck was dictating to Miss
Loeb when the boiler crashed through the
bncic wall back into the rear of the build
ing, taking everything in its way. Miss
Loeb was carried nearly twenty feet from
her chair and was found af lerward buried
under a mass of debris. She lived only
about twenty minutes. Mr. Van Vleck
was carried some distance also, but escaped
with serious cuts on the head.
In the next office, divided by a thin par
tition, were two telegraph operators, Ed
ward R. Emory and Theodore Grice. The
former was struck by the boiler and in
stantly killed, while his companion es
caped practically uninjured.
Henry Lyons, the unfortunate engineer,
who carelessness probably caused the
horror, was blown to pieces.
The inmates of the editorial, business
and composing rooms of tha Daily Age
were uninjured, as the force of the explo
sion was all in the opposite direction.
The pecuniary damage amounts to about
$10,000.

OLYMPICS SCORE
THE MULTNOMAHS
Portland Athletes Accused
of Harsh Treatment to
Visitors.
CAPTAIN GILL'S PLAINT.
Says the Referee Curtly Refused
to Entertain a Just
Protest.
HIS MEN JEERED AND HISSED.
He Declares the Northern Athletes
Guilty of Unsportsmanlike
Conduct.
PORTLAND, Or., Jane 29.â Charges of
unsportsnianship have been made by the
Olympics against members of the Mult
nomah club. They affect the whole club,
and the opinion of the Olympics in this
regard has been shared, more or less, by
outsiders to such an extent as to make it
impossible to disregard it. The lack of
sportsmanship with which the Olympics
charge the Multnomahs does not mean a
lack of fairness; it means a lack of those
finer principles that are not found in the
rules of the Amateur Athletic Union, but
which are far more important in preserv
ing true amateur sport than all the rules.
Captain Leonard Gill of the Olympics
says:
"The Multnomah team won from us Sat
urday because it was a better team. Our
team was a weaker team than we should
have brought north, and we found a much
stronger team here than we expected. We
don't complain about meeting better men,
but we do complain of the unsportsman
like manners of the club and people here.
When Patterson would ccrne up for his
trial in the high jump there were men in
the grand stand who guyed him. Then,
too, the crowd jeered him when he failed.
It's the first time I ever dreamed that it
was a disgrace to fail in a manly trial.
"After Wand had injured himself, and
could not enter the 440-yard race, I was
promised permission to substitute another
man; but at the last moment we were
denied that privilege. In the hurdle
race the courses were not properly meas
ured. Our man, Patterson, had he run,
would have had from ten to fifteen yards
more to go than Morgan. Ido not think
Patterson could have won, but he was en
titled to a properly measured course.
"After finishing the 220-yard dash, I had
to go into my quarters for a rub-down, and
as captain of the team had no opportunity
of seeing how the courses were arranged.
But as soon as I did heard of it I asked for
Mr. Giisan, the referee, and protested to
him. He declined to consider my protest,
saying that it was not made in the proper
way. Did you ever hear of such a thing ?"

)
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 29.â The
State Board of Examiners was in session
to-day. The following proclamation was
received from the Governor :
On July 7, A. D. 1846, Commodore Sloat, U.
8. N.,in the name of the United States of
America, raised the flag of our Union at Mon
terey, Cal., and occupied the territory under
claim of the National Government.
July 7, A. D. 1896, marks the semi-centennial
anniversary of this most important event in
the history of our State, and should be set
apart as a day of rejoicing by our people.
Now, therefore, I, James H. Budd, Governor
of the State of California, by virtue of the au
thority vested in me by the constitution and
laws of said State, do hereby proclaim Tues
day, the 7th day of July, A. D. 1896, a holi
day.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the great seal of this State to
be hereunto affixed, this 29th day of June,
A. D. 1896. James H. Budd, Governor.
L. H. Brown, Secretary of State.
The Tahoe road dispute, which has been
before the board for an almost indefinite
period, was finally settled. All deeds for
rights of way are now owned by the State,
the last being delivered to-day, and a bill
in the sum of $438 in full for deed and at
torneys' fees being allowed.

missioner, for $1800, and those of R. I.
Thompson, secretary of the commission,
in the sum of $750, were rejected on a de
cision of Attorney - General Fitzgerald
that the State appropriation was not avail
able until the National appropriation was
secured, and, furthermore, because the
services were rendered before there was
any surety that the National appropria
tion would be allowed.
Secretary of State Lewis H. Brown will
leave for the East on Wednesday. His
main purpose will be to visit Eastern
State institutions, with the view of perfect

SEATTLE SOCIAL
LEADERS FIGHT.
General Carr and Charles
Esplin Pummel Each
Other.
THREE LIVELY ROUNDS.
Both Are Eadly Damaged When
Police Arrive on the
SIQTJEL TO A DIVORCE SUIT.
One tbe Counsel for Dr. Dawson, and
the Other a Friend of the
Wife.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 29.â Brigadier-
General E. SI. Carr of the State militia
and chief counsel for Dr. Dawson in bis
divorce case against Mrs. Dawson clashed
with Charles Esplin, the much-talked-of
co-respondent in the case, on Pioneer
place to-day. In the presence of several
hundred people the two fought three
bloody rounds. The fight was from the
start one of the most desperate that ha 3
occurred in the city lor a long time.
It was generally expected that sooner or
later tbe two men would come together.
General Carr, who is 6 feet and 4 inches in
height and weighs 275 poundc, has a
reputation as a fighter, and Esplin, while
not such a large man, is a scientific boxer.
Esplin has been more prominently men
tioned in connection with the divorce case
than has any other of the co-respondents.
General Carr subpenaed him as a witness
for the plaintiff, and the defense will use
him as a witness. A few days ago, when
Mrs. Kiusey was testifying in the Dawson
case, General Carr made Esplin stand up
while the courtroom was crowded so that
the witness could identify him. Last Sat
urday a local paper stated that General
Carr had subpenaed witnesses who would
impeach Esplin's testimony for the de
fense by swearine that Esplin told him
that he and Mrs. Dawson had been inti
mate.
Esplin saw General Carr this morning
as the latter was about to enter his office
in the Pioneer building. He asked Carr if
he were responsible for the article, and
Carr said that he was not. Then Esplin
asked Carr if he had ever said that he
would whip him. Carr replied that if
Esplin wanted a fight he couid have it,
and with that he struck Esplin on the nose.
Then they went at it.
Esplin, being the more scienced, suc
ceeded in landing frequently, but when
ever Carr would hit Esplin he would
stagger him. Three times the men were
separated, and each time they went at ie
again. Finally the police interfered and
the two men, their clothes saturated with
blood and their faces black and blue, were
led off to the police headquarter?, where
they were released to appear in the
Municipal Court to-morrow morning.
The fight created the greatest kind of a
sensation, owing to Carr's prominence in
tbe State. It is alleged that if it had con
tinued Carr would have lost. More
serious trouble is expected, as the case has
resolved itself into a personal fight among
all interested.
The divorce case was on this afternoon
â¢nd Mrs. Mary Jensen, who was a nurse
in the Dawson household in 1892, gave
testimony to the effect that Frank Carrol,
one of the co-respondents, who is attend
in? college in California, was intimate
with Mrs. Dawson. They corresponded
and the witness saw them once in the par
lor, when Mrs. Dawson was supposed to
have been at a dance.

An Attachment Levied on Her Trunks
Fails of the Anticipated
Result.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 29.â Alma
Herzog, a stage warbler of considerable
fame who sang in a local theater last week,
appreciates the value of newspaper puffs.
During her late engagement she became
dissatisfied with the stereotyped notices
accorded and engaged the services of a
special writer, by name W. L. Price.
Price, true to bis calling, saw to it taat
Miss Herzog's name was kept before the
public. When it came to paying for this
laudation at $2 a line, the charming song
stress, whose real name is Mrs. Dr. Bluett
and who is the wife of an Oakland physi
cian, was coy and backward. Whereof
this story treats.
The lady has a burning desire to elec
trify the world as a singer. Whatever
ability she may have as a songstress, she
did not make a hit during her engagement
here at the Orpheum ; to the contrary, the
gallery gods expressed disapproval by an
occasional hiss or groan.
Price learned this morning that she had
secured a berth on a San Francisco tram
which left the city this afternoon. He
determined to have Mr. Bluett's trunks
and jewelry attached. The matter was
put into the hands of a constable, who
sent one of bis deputies with the neces
sary papers to the Albany, where Mrs.
Bluett had rooms. The officer found Mrs.
Bluett, who declared she had no trunks.
This afternoon it was learned that the
actress had missed her train and was still
in the city. The people at tbe Albany
were posted and would give no informa
tion. It was found later that the woman
had evaded Her attaching pursuers by
going to the San Fernando-street station
and boarding the train there. She had
only a hand-satchel with her.

case against J. K. Stephens, suspected of
complicity in the late attempt to rob tbe
money vaults of the First National Bank
of this city, was dismissed this forenoon
by Justice Morrison. District Attorney
James explained that he had not been
able to secure from the Police Department
evidence sufficient to make out a case
against Stephens. The action of the Dis
trict Attorney in moving for the dismissal
was no surprise in the courtroom, for it
was quite genera'iy known about the po
lice station that no evidence of a damaging
nature against Stephens had been found.
The Police Department is "up a tree."
It was able to arrest only one man, and
now he is free. The Express to-night says :
The Express has held nil along that Stephens
had nothing to do with the attempted robbery.

good clothes and two-carat diamonds. It is
understood that Stephens' attorney wag armed
this morning with everything necessary to es
tablish an absolute alibi for his client

mas occupied the entire day in Judge
Reynolds' court delivering the closing
statement for the proponents in the Parker
will contest. The courtroom was crowded,

ladles.
Mr. Delmas said a long list of reputable
witnesses had testified that George H.
Parker was a shrewd business man and
possessed all his mental faculties at the
time the will was made and was not one
that could be easily influenced. Edward
L. Parker, the testator's son and husband
of the contestant, was perfectly satisfied
with the terms of the will. He lived
eight months after his father died and bad
no idea of contesting the will, but as soon
as he died Emma L. Parker, his widow,
took the first train across the continent to
begin this contest.

the morning and will be followed by
Attorney Coogan for the contestant. A
verdict will probably be reached Wednes

Beardslee and staff and Captain Cotton of
the Philadelphia, and Captain Sumner of
the Monadnock, with a number of officers

better mode of entertainment, and Admiral

could have been devised.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 29.â The
city sewage pumping plant was de
stroyed by fire to-night. The plant was
old and worn, and the project of renewal
had been under consideration by the
Board of City Trustees for some months,
but owing to the scarcity of funds it had
been considered advisable by tbe city
fathers to postpone tbe matter as long as
possible. To-night's conflagration will of
necessity force the issue.
As the city is built on level ground the
only methods of getting rid of sewage was
to run it through the mains to the sewer
age plant, where it was pumped over the
levee. Now it is probable that the levee
will have to be cut, so that the sewage can
be run into the reclamation district. This
may provoke a series of suits for damages
from the reclamation district owners.
The loss from to-night's tire in estimated
at from $8000 to $10,000.
SAN BERNARDINO'S OLDEST MAX.
" Uncle" George Lord Celebrate* Bit
Mnety-Sixth Birthday.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., June 29.â
George Lord of this city reached his
ninety-sixth birthday last Saturday, he
having been born on June 27, 1800. He
came to California in 1849, and followed
the business of mining for many years.
The Pioneer Society of this county called
on "Uncle George" in a body last Satur
day, and passed a pleasant hour in remi
niscences.
Fall of a Clnutton Carpenter.
MODESTO, Cal., June 29, â Charles
Vezey, a carpenter on the Haslacher <fe
Kahn warehouse at the new town of Ciaus
ton, fell from the rafters of the roof this
morning, and received iniuries which
nearly resulted in his death. His right
wrist was broken and his head, face and
shoulders bruised. A board, which had
broken under him, struck tbe ground
first, and the end pierced Vezey's throat.
SAN DIEGO BALLOTS COUNTED
City Fathers Announce a Majority for the
Bond Issue â Work on the
Water System.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., June 29.â The City
Council to-night canvassed the vote cast
on Saturday on the question of issuing
$1,500,000 of bonds for the acquisition of a
new water system. The official vote was
found to be 2540 for the bonds and 1184
against, giving a total of 57^ for the bonds
over the necessary two-th rds majority.
Ordinances were adopted ratifying all
those passed up to the present time and
declaring the vote official.
Work on the new system was be^un
with a rush this morning by E. S. Bab
cock, who, with John D. Spreckels, is the
leading spirit in the enterprise. The com
pany is constructing Otay dam for its own
use, and the constructing engineer, two
gangs of men and a lot of machinery were
sent out to-day to resume operations. The
dam is about half finished. It will irrigate.
several thousand acres of lemon land.
Two other engineering corps were sent
out to beein work on the Morena dam,
which will be owned by the city, and the
Barretts dam, which is the property of
the company. Steel for the completion of
the Otay dam was ordered by wire from
Chicago. Roads are to be cut through to
Morena, which is in an almost inacces
sible portion of tbe Laguna Mountains.
Friendly suits to test the validity of the
bonds just authorized were begun to-day
in the Superior Court here and in the
Federal court at Los Angeles. It is ex
pected that the action here will be sent to
the Supreme Court at once, and that a de
cision will be banded down within a few
months. In the meantime work will pro
ceed without interruption. The San
Diego Flume Company, which has had a
monopoly of the city water business,
threatens to begin suit to contest the
election.
TRIED TO STRANGLE HER,
Gertie Johnson Assailed Last
Night by a Burly Saloon-
Keeper.
Her Screams Attracted a Policeman
and He Placed the Offender
Under Arrest
Thomas Anderson, a saloon-keeper by
occupation, is behind the bars of the City
Prison, charged with attempting to strangle
a young woman of the haJf-world named
Gertie Johnson.
The assault occurred in a disreputable
house on the corner of Bush and Dupont
streets. Officer Crowley, who was passing,
was attracted by the screams of the John
son woman. HeTiurried into the build-
Ing, arriving in time to see the thoroughly
frightened girl rush out of her room into
the hallway. The woman told the officer
her story, and he placed Anderson under
arrest and charged him with assault at
ihe California-street station.
Detective Bohen, who for many weeks
has been searching for the stranatler who
I murdered May McDermott and Bertha
Paridis, was communicated with and he
questioned the young woman as to the
assault made upon her.
"This man," she said, pointing toward
Anderson, "called at my room about 9
o'clock and we drank a few glasses of wine
together. Finally he began to act strange,
and as my mind was lull of the recent
murders, I became frightened.
"Without saying anything to him I
attempted to leave the room, and he
sprang in front of me and exclaimed '1
am a desperate man, don't attempt to
trifle with me.' I screamed, and he
grabbed me by the throat and threw me
on the bed. He choked me severely, but I
finally managed to struggle from his
grasp. I rushed into the hallway, and
meeting the officer who had been attracted
by my screams, informed him as to what
bad happened, and he placed my assailant
under arrest."
Anderson strongly denies having made
an attempt to strangle the woman, and
offers as an explanation of his actions
that he was only joking.

NEWPORT, Kt., June 29.â Judge Helm

FELL HEADLONG
TO HIS DEATH,
Fatal Accident to James
Dawson, an Electric
Lineman.
CAUGHT A LIVE WIRE.
The Shock Threw Him From
the Top of a Pole on Mar
ket Street.
HE DIED IN A FEW MINUTES.
Hundreds of Prcmenaders on the
Street Were Horrified by Seeing
Him Fall.
Hundreds of people who were prome
nading Market street yesterday afternoon
about half-past 2 o'clock were started by
seeing a man fall from the tnp of an elec
tric light pole and strike upon the sidewalk
with great violence.
The man was James Dawson, a Inieman
in the employment of the Edison Electric
Light and Power Company. He and a
fellow-workman, Dan Desmond, were on
top of a pole in front of Sanborn, Vail &
Co.'s store engaged in running a loop on a
dead wire.
By some means or other the wires be
came tangled and Dawson was caught in
a coil of live wire that wrapped about his
body below the arms and around his legs.
He screamed in his agony as he received
through his body the whole force of the
company's powerful electric current and
grasped the live wire with his hands. He
swayed for a moment Bnd then fell.
His body struck against some telephone
wires and, rebounding, came to the side
walk with great violence.
Desmond made a brave attempt to res
cue him before he fell, but was too late.
Desmond was thoroughly unnerved as he
slid down tbe pole and looked at the
scorched and mangled body of his fellow
workman.
Women who saw the poor fellow fall
screamed, and a crowd of horrified men
pushed across the street. A hack w.is
quickly summoned, and Dawson, who was
unconscious, was picked up from the side
walk and driven rapidly to the Receiving
Hospital. Dr. Helms made a hasty ex
amination of the man and pronounced
him dead. He had died in the hack on
the way to the hospital.
When the body was examined it was
found that the hands and legs were badly
scorched, and the flesh had also been
scorched about the chest. As he fell a
distance of about fifty feet it is probable
that he was to all intents and purposes
dead before he was picked up from the
sidewalk.
The body was removed to the Morgue,
ana an inqnÂ«st will bo held to determine
whether the man's death was caused by
his own careles-ness or how.
Dawson was 26 years of age and unmar
ried. He lived at 810 Howard street. Yes
terday was his first day of work for two
weeks. While engaged in a pole-climbing
contest with some of his fellow-linemen
about two weeks ago he fell and received
severe injuries which confined him to his
bed.
This is the first fatal accident the Edison
company has had among their employes
since commencing business in this City.
Dr. J. S. Barrett held an autopsy on
Dawson'a body last evening and filed a
certificate stating that the deceased had
met his death through a shock from an
electric current. Also that Dawson had a
superficial burn on the dorsal surface of
the right thumb at the second phalange;
a burn over the anterior surface of the
lower one-third of the right arm; a burn
over the posterior surface of the upper one
third of the right arm ; a burn on the dor
sal surface of the left band and a burn
over the posterior surface of the left arm
at the elbow.GREETED WITH CHEERS
BY HIS CONSTITUENTS,
Congressman Maguire
Given an Ovation
Last Evening.
HOWTHE INFAMOUS FUNDING
BILL WAS KILLED.
The "Magnificent Work of The Call'" De
clared to Have Been One of the Potent
Factors in Uncle Collis' Undoing
at Washington City.
At the anti- fund ing ratification meeting
last night Metropolitan Temple was
crowded into the halls. Even the gallery
steps were utilized as seats. Many ladies
were in tne audience.
A large bonfire blazed at Fifth and Mar
ket streets. Cassasa's band played at the
Temple entrance and afterward inside.
There was plenty of enthusiasm. Mention
of the names of Senator White, Congress
man Maguire and Mayor Sutro brought
out ovations of applause and cheers. The
Congressman bowed his acknowledg
ments, but the Mayor was not there to
hear his name cheered to the echo. He is
in Napa County.
Applause followed the appearance on
the platform of the vice-presidents. Of
the list of vice-presidents the following
were present: Stewart Menzies, George
K. Fitch, Joseph Leggett, C. M. Shortridge,
D. Gilbert Dexter, Clitus Barbour, \V. M.
Banker, James H. Barry, Richard Lam
bert. W. Macarihur, John Fay, John P.
Dun, R. JL. Mann, W. J. Biggy and Max
Popper.
Due credit was given by Congressman
Maguire and other speakers in well-turned
words to The Call, the Examiner, the
Evening Report, the Washington Star,
the San Francisco Star and to Ambrose
Bierce, tne Washington correspondent, for
his fidelity to the cause and to DavenDort
and Swinnerton, the newspaper artists.
When Congressman Maguire mentioned
the name of Congressman Johnson there
was a demonstration in the audience.
When he mentioned the name of the
other members of the California delega
tion, other Congressmen from other States
who had helped in the fight at Washing
ton, and of Senator Morgan of Alabama
there were enthusiastic applause and
cheers.
Tlie meeting was called to order by
James H. Barry. When he concluded his
rem irks the vice-presidents were nicely
selti<>d in their chairs. Mr. Barry said:
"You know ior what purpose this meet
ing nas been called, it has been called to
ratiiy the action of Congress over the in
fani Ju3 funding bill. lam here simply to
introduce the chairman of the meeting,
the Hon. J. D. Phelan."
The applause that greeted Chairman
Phelan when he stepped forward was
almost deafening.
Mr. Phelan said: "Ladies and gentle
men: lam not here this evening to make
a speech. There are others here who have
more information than I have, and they
will address you. Certain of the Southern
Pacific lobbyists at Washington declared
that the opponents of the funding bill in
California were communists and anarch
ists. If this be true, then everybody in
California must therefore come under this
category. All of our Representatives at
Washington, save one, fought gallantly
against the infamy, and that one nas been
Bhown up in his true light of fawning j
servility by the local press.
"We maintain that this funding matter !
is simply a business proposition. In 1862 j
the Government gave the railway certain
privileges, in return for which it took
liens on the property. These liens are
shortly to become due. Tje railroad
people want the time on the liens to be
extended and the debt to remain unpaid.
The people of California, however, de
mand that the lien be foreclosed.
"When the Government shall have fore
closed several different things may hap
pen. We may have Government owner
ship of the railroads. [Loud appiause.]
"On the other hand, if the road should
fall into the hands of another corporation
we will have what we have been so long
anxiously waiting for, a transcontinental
competing railroad.
"We who nave lived in this State all our
lives scarcely appreciate to what extent
we are in the power of the railroad. It
hems us in on the east, the south, the
north, and, strange to say, even in the
west.
"Our delegation at Congress is repre
sented here to-night, and through its
spokesman Will tell us of the fi_:bt. We |
wish to show them, that they may tell
their fellow-representatives at Washing
ton the kind of citizens who oppose the
passage of the infamous refunding meas- j
ure."
Mr. McArthur, as a labor representa
tive, spoke as follows after chairman Phe
lan:
"I will preface my remarks with the
following trite complet:
Honor and shame from no conditions rise.
Act well thy part, in that the honor lies.
"As I recalled the couplet of Pope I
thought how great a common ground it
constituted between various revolutions.
As I stand here, a representative of the
laboring men of California, I am de
lighted to voice the praise of the laborers
for their honored representative whom I
believe has been esteemed by the laboring
clo u s longer and more zealously than all
other?.
"There is one thing I wish to say here
this evening â something that may per
haps be not exactly in place. I wish to
voice the grateful thanks to our honored
Congressman on behalf of the American
seamen. Congressman Maguire has done
for the seamen what Lincoln did for the
slaves."
J. J. Ualyin, who officiated as secretary
of the meeting, read the list of vice-presi
dents and the following resolutions. The
resolutions were unanimously and very
vociferously received and adopted near
the close of the meeting:
Retolved, That we, the citizens of San Fran
Cisco, in mass-meeting assembled, do hereby
hereby heartily indorse Congressmen Maeuire,
Barham, Hilborn and Bowers, Senators White
and Perkins of California and Senator John T.
Morgan of Alabama for their able, earnest and
determined opposition to the consideration of
the Pacific Railroad's infamous refunding bill,
whereby its passage was prevented at the last
session of Congress, and we entreat them io
continue their laudable efforts in our behalf in
the future; and
Retolvtd, That we commend Congressman
Loud Â«n<3 McLachlan lor their promises, pub
licly made, to vote against the funding bill,
and earnestly nrpe them to strenuously sec
ond the efforts of their colleagues to defeat the
measure; and
Retolvtd. That we tender to Senator Goebel
and his collegues in the Legislature of Ken
tucky the iiear'felt thanks- of the people of
California lor their efforts to repeal the char
ter of the Southern Pacific Company of .Ken
tucky, and we urge them to continue their ef
forts in that direction; and
Resolved, That we emphasize our apprecia
tion of the gallan t and continued efforts of our
honored Mayor, Adolph Sutro, who has given
his time and money unsparingly in this fight
for the people; and
Resolved, That the tnanks of this meeting
and of the people of the entire Pacific Coast
are due to the Examiner and its Washington
correspondeut, Ambrose Bierce, for their faith
ful publication of all the information concern
ing and invaluable services against the fund
ing infamy, and we also thank The Call of
San Francisco and the Star of Washington,
D. C., for their active ana constant opposition
to the mea.-ure; and be it finally
Resolved, That we hereby denounce the false
and shameless statpments of P. Huntington
and his lobby concerning the character and
motives of our citizens who have opposed his
nefarious schemes. John P. Dunn,
Stewart Menzies,
Joseph Leggett,
Richard Lam beet.
Chairman Pbelan neatly turned the ad
dresses of the evening to speeches to the
question of the adoption of the resolution
and the programme ran along smoothly.
The only thing that interrupted it was the
frequent applause.
Acting Mayor Taylor Rogers was intro
duced as the representative of Mayor Su
tro. He read a letter from the Mayor as
lollows :
Calistoga. Cal., June 27, 1896.
Fellow-Citizens: Allow me the privilege of
congratulating you on this meeting.
For though absent in body I am with you
most deeply In my very soul, to rejoice in the
triumphs of the hour.
The people of San Francisco, aye, of the
whole State, have great cause to be Droud.
So far victory has been theirs, notwithstand
ing the gigantic corporations against them.
For it is in truth a supreme victory to have
defeated the infamous scheme of Mr. Hunting
ton.
That meant to bind burdens around the
.neck of the farmer and miner, the merchant
and laborer.
It meant the increase of the price of all
merchandise, a higher rate of taxation all over
the State.
These burdens, for the moment, nave been
cast aside.
For this let full praise be given to our Con
gressmen who have been loyal to this grand
commonwealth.
They all, with n notorious exception, deserve
â  our thanksâ the wreath of approval by a satis
fied people. .
In this regard permit me to name Judge
Maguire as pre-eminent in his devotion, zeal
ous in his work and brave and loyal in his
duty to you.
But while we all join voices in this ovation,
let me warn you with profound emphasis.
The danger is not pastâ it is still ahead.
For with Shakespeare I tell you:
"We have scotched a snake, not killed it."
The people must make another snpreme ef
fort at the coming session, for bribery, coer
cion and cajolery will be employed then to
pass some funding bill.
Use all means to help your Congressmen
inform the East of our industrial chains.
Implore your Atlantic frienas for even
handed justice.
Do ali thnt honest men can do, and leave the
battle to a just God, to guide and prosper for
the good of our people and the fair name of
California.
You may rely upon me to the extent of my
power.
In conclusion, permit the suggestion that
the following resolution be passed by this
body:
"Resolved, That the National Democratic Con
vention at Chicago be requested to insert a
plank denouncing the pending bill or any
other funding bill."
Yours for right and justice,
Adolph Sutro.
The resolution suggested by the Mayor
was adopted:
Continuing acting Mayor Taylor said:
"What is the issue involved in this cam
paign? Why are we here to-night? It is
for a reason that reaches to the heart of
the whole peopie and this great Govern
ment. I repeat, what is the great issue in
this campaign â "
A voice in the audience shouted, "Sil
ver."
This created some amusement.
'No, it is not silver. Silver is another
issue. lam not here to make that kind of
a speech.
"The great iusue," he said, "is this:
That there is no man under the stars and
stripes who is greater than the law. This
should be promulgated till the funding
bill is crushed and cast into the sea. The
Southern Pacific has thrown the glove
into the arena. Their attitude is the atti
tude of old Boss Tweed, 'What are you
going to do about it?' Mr. Huntingtou
spits with contempt on the law which gave
him his great fortune.
"What is the remedy for all this? It is
that the strong arm of Uncle Sam shall
take Mr. Huntingtou by the throat and
cboke the life out of him." After the
fashion of the Roman Senator who de
clared that Carthage must be destroyed he
said the cry of the people of California
should be that the railroad must be de
stroyed. He advised the people to elect
no one to Congress whom they were not
sure would onpose the funding bill, and
paid a tribute to Maguire.
Henry E. Highton was the next speaker
introduced by the chairman. He said:
I join with pleasure in the congratulation
on the temporary defeat of the funding bill.
The occasion for an exultant demonstration
has not yet arisen. The funding bill will be
pressed at the next session of Congress and if
it be then buried among the unsuccessful
frauds oi the century then shall we be justified
in anticipating the final emancipation of the
State from railroad oppression and corruption
and swelling the triumphant chorus of
victory.
Is the power of money, through corporations
ai.d otherwise, to control governmentâNa
tional, State end municipal? Here and at
Washington all that is most dangerous and
most sinister in the controversy is typified and
represented by C. P. Huntington, a pioneer of
California, who is the most inveterate and un
compromising enemy of its permanent wei
mre, and who, in the shadow of Wall street,
attacks its industries and its reputation.
Our own people have been practically unani
mous against the funding bill, and, however
much they have been mutilated and bled, they
are not of the fiber to submit forever to a rail
road dictatorship supported by Venetian
methods.
At the last session of Congress Mr. Hunting
ton, unless he has been grossly misrepresented,
resorted to wholesale slander and falsehood.
Of the gentlemen who signed the memoiiai
authorized by the State convention, he is pub
lished as having ca:d that they were "as un
i v my a crowd as ever fanner found lurking
around his henroost."
Mr. Huntingtou is. reported to have said that
the opponents of the funding bill here were as
uncanny a crowd as a farmer ever found
lurking arour.d his henroost. Let me say
right here that he would be a fool who would
be found lurking around a henhouse that Mr.
Huntington hart left.
There has never been a movement in the
nistory of the funding bill when Mr. Hunting
ton would have dared to appeal to the people,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 1896.
through petitions or public meetings, and the I
only attempt he ever made in that direction
was proved to be a fraud.
1 doubt if he could secure the Indorsement
of a single voting precinct in the State. I am
convinced (hat, with all the pressure he could
bring to bear, he could not find 3000 of our
citizens who would avow themselves to be
advocates of his refunding scheme. I now
present an incomplete list of the varioas
bodies that have declared against the con
spiracy and in favor of strict foreclosure
within the last six months:
San Francisco Union for Practical Progress,
San Francisco Committee of Fifty, California
Anti-Funding Bill Convention, San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, Alameda County Fed
erated Trades, Society of American Socialists,
Prohibition State Central Committee; Gait
Lodge No. 1, Patriots of America; San Fran
cisco Iroquois Club, Democratic State Central
Committee, Alameda County Populist Conven
tion, Republican State Convention, Nevada
State Republican Convention, State Populist
Convention, Prohibition party convention,
San Francisco Labor Council.
Here are sixteen different organizations, rep
resenting labor, trade, commerce, patriotic
fraternities and every political party extant.
If I had preserved the facts the list might
easily have been doubled. I have omitted, for
example, a convention of the Supervisors of
the different counties of California, which
lately, at San Jose, adopted similar resolutions.
With these facts beiore you you can realize
the monstrous falsehood of the assertion that
the opponents of refunding in California were
only "a few hundreds."
But it was said at Washington that Cali
fornia had nothing to propose in place of the
refunding scheme. This again was a lie.
Congressman Maguire hit the nail on the head
and was overwheimingiy indorsed when he
voiced public sentiment. The substitute lor
refunding is strict foreclosure.
The speaker of the evening was next in
troduced. After the applause which
greeted Judge Maguire had subsided, he
spoKe as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens: I like
this practice of calling on the representatives
of the neople to give an account of their stew,
ardship. I believe that many of our present
evils are due to lack of appreciation of a rep
resentative on the part ot his constituency. I
myself should dread to return to Congress if I
hp.d been a traitor to my people and had failed
to do what it was my duty to do.
, This funding bill tight has become pretty
well known through tne press. I will, there
fore, not dwell upon its details, but will tell
how the fight is being carried on by the South
ern Pacihc Company, an incorporated pirate,
organized in Kentucky and allowed to plunder
every State except Kentucky.
Alter much trouble we finally succeeded in
being assigned a day to be heard before the
Pacific Railroads Committee of the House.
Meanwhile a mass-meeting had been held in
San Francisco, and a representation was sent
on to Washington consisting of Charles A.
Sumner and Mr. Perkins. Although they
failed to arrive on the Monday when the Com
mittee on Railroads met, we used up the time
until a general meeting was held, at which the
Californians were given a hearing.
We had a strong minority and made a gallant
fight. They had men pledged to support the
funding bill. They had the support and in
fluence of all other railroads in the country.
The fight was on the floor of the House.
He mentioned Congressmen Boatner,
Harris of Tennessee and Cooper of Wis
consin for their good and effective work
against the funding bill. Continuing he
said: â¢
In connection with the work of the mass
meeting in this City which sent the repre
sentatives on to Washington I wish to mention
especially the work of Hon. Adolph Sutro.
Mr. Sutro found a lack of suitable literature
in Washington and furthermore discovered
that the report of the Pacific Railroads com
mittee and the copies of the San Francisco
papers containing the famous -'Colton" letters
had been lost. I had to telegraph to San Fran
cisco ior the nece-isary papers and Mayor
Sutro promptly and generously procured and
forwarded them to Washington. We secured
promptly and used effectively that literature.
Armed with these we proceeded, and here I
want to say that in spite of the condemnation
of the distribution of this literature by cer
tain persons very much is due to these letters
and pamphlets. Many Representatives took
exception to the sending of this literature, but
I found nobody who felt insulted at it who
was not one of Mr. Huntington's hirelings.
In the present Congress we met with strong
and. determined opposition. Even those who
had formerly supported us were prevented
from assisting us as before. Mr. Cooper was
ruthlessly removed. 1 don't say that Speaker
Reed did it at the instance of Mr. Huntington,
but the great influence of the great railroads
was perhaps impelled to leave Cooper off, and
we had no friend in the committee but Boat
ner.
A determined and powerful lobby, mar
shaled by Mr. Huntington, the kiiigof lobby
i ists, came on to Washington. Old as he is,
j rich as he Is, powerful as he is, C. P. Huntington
will still crawl iibout the corridors and halls
of \V'ashtiigton in search oi pennies.
We found that the Senate committee on Pa
cific railroads was in favor of refunding. But
there was one giant on the committee who had
been a member of it since its organization,
and that Senator was Jonn T. Morgan, one of
the greatest statesmen of the United States.
And if it were not for his misfortune to have
been a major in the Confederate army he
I would certainly stand without a peer among
| tnose who are named as Presidential candi
! dates.
Mr. I.oud and Mr. McLachlan both asserted
from the beginning that they would stand
true to their pledges to vote against the bill.
But I believe that even California representa
tives ought not only to vote against but fight
the iunding bill.
I give credit to Representatives Barham,
Bovvers and McLachlan for th<'ir work among
the Republicans against the funding bill.
The Bowers bill, providing for the refund
ing of both roads and extending the time to
eighty-six years and fixing the interest at 2
per cent instead of 3, as under the Reilly bill,
was substituted in the Fifty-fourth Congress.
To us of the Pacific Coast it made little differ
ence.
It asked that the Government shall carry a
debt cf some $112,000,000 for these compa
nies for fifty-five years at 2 per cent, whereas
the Government has to pay over 3% per cent.
We are fighting against such a "business"
proposition as this. We believe that by fore
closure the Government can realize at least 50
per cent of the debt due it, and that all con
nection can be severed with these men who
have fattened upon the people so long. We
believe that if the refunding course is taken
the Government will realize less than one
third of what it would get by foreclosure. We
have the remedy of foreclosure, and we are
confident that it is sufficient.
I hold that the true fountain of the Govern
ment is to govern and not to engage in any
private business, except where it is necessary
to take charge of a public utility in order to
prevent private monopoly. I believe in mak
ing the railroads public highways and letting
private enterprises compete freely in passenger
and freight transportation. If this were done
and the six big trunk lines competed freely
over the Pacific roads I believe that this com
petition would benefit us far more than any
Interstate Commerce Commission. If this ex
perimerft should be impossible to put into
operation I would advocate Government own
ership of the roads. [Applause.]
| |But if even that be impossible to realize, let
us have the road soid out to some competing
railroads. If the road is purchased at a reas
onable rate and operated as a business matter,
I believe that competition will do what it has
done in the case of the Valley Railroad. [Ap
plause.] For I read that the opening of the
Valley road for a short distance down the
San Joaquin Valley has "enabled" the South
ern Pacific to lower its freight rates on grain
in the San Joaquin Valley.
I have been asked by the committee to state
what was done by myself and colleagues in
California in this contest. I found Barham,
Hilborn and W. W. Bowers ready and willing
to take off" their coats against the bill. In this
matter they said to me. "We have no politics.
Count on us and we will stand together with
out political distinction."
The san Francisco Call did magnificent work
from beginning to end. In the Fifty-third
Congress, when I stood almost disheartened at
the prospects beiore us, 1 was encouraged by
tne accounts in the Examiner and The Call of
the support we were receiving from our friends
3000 miles away.
George K. Fitch, formerly editor of The Call,
worked nobly and bravely on our side until no
longer able to do so, and then, happily, the
management passed to Charles M. Shortridge,
who has continued the good work of his prede
cessor. BesideÃ the work of these papers the
work of the Washington Star and the San Fran
cisco Star as well [applause] was particularly
commendable.
I believe that the funding bill is effectually
.blocked in Congress. The last of the payments
is due In 1899. Until the process of foreclos
ure is completed and the decree of execution
issued the fight will still remain before us.
But I believe that if the people of California
will continue their work as they have worked
in the past the fight is ours.
The railroad people hove, if they are success
ful in the House, they can eccomplish their
end in the Senate ; but, thanks to the presence
of Perkins and White of California and Mor
gan of Alabama in the Senate any attempt to
pass any refunding bill must run'the gauntlet
of a tireless opposition. Senator White has de
clared that should the matter come up in the
Senate he would, for the purpose of education,
read the whole nine volumes of the Pacific
Railway Commission's report before the bill
could be passed.
In conclusion, I think I may safely say that
although until the roads are foreclosed we
shall not be absolutely iafe, yet the people
ciin consider themselves secure as fur as their
representatives in the National halls of legis
lation are concerned. And finally I wish to
congratulate and thank the people of Califor
nia for the appreciation and thanks they have
bestowed upon their servants in the faithful
performance of their duties to their constitu
ency,
NEW PLAYS SEEN
AT THE THEATERS
"His Wife's Father" Proves
Amusing at the Co
lumbia.
REALISM AT THE GRAND
"Sweet Violets" Wins the Ap
proval of the California
Audience.
THE TIVOLI'S NEW VENTURE
A Particularly Good Bill at the Or
pheum â Reappearance of the
Midgets.
The possibilities of the father-in-law as
a theme of domestic strife seem to be just
dawning upon dramatists. To judge from
the two father-in-law plays produced by
Miss Rose Coghlan, Who Will Arrive Here To-Day to Play at the California.
the Frawley Company during its present
engagement "the old man" can be an even
more fruitful source of trouble than the
much-ridiculed and hackneyed mother-in
law.
"The Two Escutcheons," played some
weeks ago, contained two fathers-in-law
on the rampage. ''His Wife's Father,"
which was produced last night, centered
round one, but he was a host in himself
and managed to keep things brisk and
lively from the opening of the first act to
the end of the fourth.
Miss Martha Morton, who wrote the
play, confesses to having taken the cen
tral theme from the German, but she has
succeeded in giving it considerable American
local coloring.
The plot is little more than a category of the
woes endured by Frank Hamilton and his
bride, Nell, from the officious affection of
Nell's father. The story of their troubles, in
spite of its simplicity, is so naturally aud
.humorously told, however, that it is more ef
fective than many comedies with more preten
tious plots.
â  The scene opens on the young people's wed- i
ding day, where Buchanan Billings astonishes
his son-in-law-elect by turning his business :
over to him and announcing that henceforth
he intends to aevote his entire life to making !
his daughter happy. The joy of this news is ;
embittered by the further announcement that i
there is to be no wedding tour, as he docs not j
wish to let his Nell go away with a strange !
man, but that in a few weeks he himself will
take the bride and groom on a trip to Califor- {
nia.
The young people outwit him, however, and |
steal away after the ceremony, leaving him. I
as he pathetically expresses it, "an orphaned I
father/
In the second act Billings has become simply j
unbearable. His unfortunate children live
with him. and having no occupation he de
votes himself to making them happy with |
such disastrous results that even the cook |
rises in rebellion and leaves on the spot, as a
protest against the fond parent meddling in j
the domestic economy of the kitchen.
Frank Hamilton and Nell escape to a little
flat of their own, but Billings lollows them,
and it is only when he has caused a real es
trangement between his Nell and her husband
that iHHings becomes chastened and resolves
to obtrude his presence less upon his daughter
and son-in-law.
Harry Carson Clarke gave a very nmusing
interpretation to the role ot the selfish, blun
dering, fond father.
At first he showed some tendency to exag
geration, but as the play progressed and his
role grew more one of tribulation he toned
down his superfluous energy and gave acare
ful character study of the father-in-law.
Frank Worthing was natural as Huniilton, the
unfortunate son-in-law. Miss Bates, who
pluyed the role of Nell, returned to her gush- j
ing, spasmodinc style, which is effective in
some parts, but which palls upon an audience
when seen too often and in too many parts.
As the slavey last week Miss Bates showed
that she is versatile enough to throw off her
mannerisms when she chooses, and it is a pity
that she retains quite so many of them as Nell.
Tyrone Power gave a clever and careful in
terpretation of the part of a poor but arrogant
relation. George Leslie was a trifle less George
Leslie than usual as Ferdinand Langdon, the
whisky drummer with social aspirations, ana j
the same may be said of Miss Phosa McAllister j
as the aunt-in-law.
Miss .Maaee Carr Cook was bright and pleas
ing as the widow who consoled the father-in
law, Miss Lftnsing Rowan acted her part grace
fully, and Miss Hope Ross was, as usual, a
charming Ingenue.
At the Tivoll.
"A Trip to the Moon" will continue to be the
attraction at the Tivoli all this week.
The sale of seats tor the season of grand
opera, under the direction of Guslav Hinrichs,
opened yesterday. On Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday nnd Saturday evenings of next -, eek
Donizetti's favorite grand opera, "Lucia," will
be given, with Mme. Louise Natalie, Sig.
Fernando Michaelana, Sig. Maurice de Vries,
Signor Abramoff r.nd other artists in the
cast, assisted by an enlarged chorus and aug
mented orchestra. Wednesday, Friday and
Sunday evenings for the first time in this City
will be sung Gounod's tragic opera, "Romeo
and Juliet." In this opera Nina Bertini
Humphreys and the contralto, Anna Russell,
will make their first appearance.
At the Orpheum,
An almost entirely new bill was presented at
the Orpheum last night and one that was
quite above the average in merit.
The Frederick troupe, consisting of five
athletes, who style themselves the demon
acrobats, do some clever work on a couple ot
ladders, as well as on the stage. Watson and
Duprez are a couple of singing and dialogue
artists, who do an amusing turn, though It
might be shorter without detracting Irom
their popularity.
The four Maisonos are pantomimists and
musical eccentrics, who are all clever mimos.
Collins and Collins are two sistrrs who have
the approved music-hall style of chortling and
who introduce some dashing dialogues and
ditties.
The Midgets, who appeared in a short return
engagement, proved if possible more popular
than ever. Their sparring-match Is the Tery
poetry of prizefighting, and the little fellows
were rapturously applauded. The vitascope
has some new pictures. The famous May
Irwin-John Kice kiss, which like Tennyson's
brook goes on forever, was lauirhed at and ap
plauded, and Cissy Fitzgerald, the dancer, who
was at once recognized by her wink, was with
out delay taken into the good graces of the
gallery. The marimba players are another
good addition to the new attractions.
Among the hold-overs are Billy Van, in a
new dialogue, and Lilly Western, who plays on
nine instruments, some of them very cleverly.
At the Grand.
"One of the Bravest" opened to a typical
first-night audience at the Grand. The play
is one well calculated to appeal to the popular
taste. It is a comedy-drama, well inter
spersed with song and lively action. The
specialties are all good. Emmet Sheridan, the
star, appears to advantage In the character of
Larry Howard, one of the bravest of the New
York Fire Department. He is not out of place
in comedy-drama, but the playbills are a de
lusion arid a snare when they emblazon his
name in the face of the public as a great
singer. He is graceful enough and has a pleas
ing voice. It has no saw-teeth.
The interest centers in two villains omni-
present and arousine indignation. The prin
cipal villain, Rufus Ward, causes the death of
a prosperous merchant by getting ' 'Tiger. " his
partner, to explode a dynamite bomb on board
a ship. He afterward shoots Harry Howard,
the heroic member of the Now York Fire De
partment. Subsequently he chloroforms the
widow of the dead merchant aud steals the
child. Harry Howard foils the villain. The
most thrilling scene in the play is that depict
ing the burning of a tenement-house, when
the engine is drawn on the stage by a spirited
team ot horses and the firemen handle the ap
paratus just as they do in real life. It is a
striking reaiistic scene. Mr. Sheridan displays
his agility in making hii escape from the sec
ond story of a bnilding, using the latest con
trivances for the rescue of people from burn
ing buildings. Another realistic scene is the
opium den.
Gilbert and Goldie are a strong comedian
team, and the respective parts of Policeman Mc-
Ginty and Mrs, Grogan do not suffer at their
hands. There is plenty of action and no drag,
and the first-nighters found nothinc at which
to cavil.
The California.
Sydney Gnindy's four-act play, "A Bunch of
Violets," as produced by L. R. Stockwell's
company at the California last night, has few
vulnerable points open to criticism.
j The play deala with the life of Sir Philip
I Marchant, a mau of the world, who sacrifices
I everything to attain his end. He is a specula
; tor, and places on tne market mines and
stocks that ure fictitious, while he poses before
; the wnrld as & good and charitable man.
Mr. Murgatroyd, a plain Yorkshire man, is
! one of his dupes. Merchant's home consists of
! himself, his wife and daughter Violet. The
j play derives its name, "A Bunch of Violets,"
from the fact that every morning his daughter
1 brings him a fresh bunch for his boutonniere.
| She is very, devoted to him and he loves her
dearlyâ one of the virtues of his life.
Mr. Kelcey in Sir Philip has a character well
I suited, and Miss Eflie Shannon appeared as
1 a light comedy adventuress. Mr. Stockwell
was the old Yorkshire capitalist, and Beach
j and Sullivan fitted well in their respective
: roles. Miss Oliver, as the injured wife, and
Miss Winona Shannon, as the loving daughter
| Violet, have two of the best characters.
The play was a great success in London, and
New York, where the part of Sir Philip was
played by Beerbohm Tree.
The cast is strong ana the parts are well as
signed. There is hardly a dull line or dialogue
in the play, and the closing of the third act is
intense. Mr, Kelcey makes a good Sir Philip,
and Miss Oliver and Miss Effie Shannon,
though their roles as Lady Marchant and Mrs.
Murgatroyd were widely different, are even
candidates for popular favor.
The Park Theater.
The second week ql the season at the Park
Theater opened last night with the Irish com
edy-drama entitled "The Rambler From
Clare." This production is one in which there
is a combination of pathos and mirth, and Dan
McCarthy, who assumes the part of Tony Sulli
van, the leading character, has a splendid
opportunity to display his talent and he did
so to the utmost, and his efforts were heartily
I applauded.
His acting is neat and very natural, and
while his voice In song is not powerful It is
sweet aud pleasing. The life ol the piece is
I Rosle Dwyer, characterized by Miss Lou
Ripley, a stout young lady who is as lively as a
cricket and portrays the lines of the author
! with much faithfulness. Charles W. Swain,
ihe comedian, late of the Grand Opera house,
in the chMracter of Paddy Mctadden, has
much to keep him busy and does that in away
to excite much laughter. In the third act
Irish songs, jigs and dances, and dances that
were not Irish are introduced to the satis
faction of the audience as evinced by generous
applause. "The Rambler From Clare" will
appear every night this week.
An Insolvent Hotel-Keeper.
Andrew Ketterer, proprietor of the North
Beach Hotel, has filed a petition in insloveucy.
He uwes $4904 97, and hh assets are about
$400.
The cure of sleeplessness requires a

McKinley accents.
The campaign has full steam on.
Once more we remind you to register.
The whole country is snouting for pro
tection.
Join a Republican club and keep up with
the music.
The man, the platform and the masses
are in accord.
It is now time to make ready for the
Fourtn of July in earnest.
It looks like either Bland or Boies, but it
may be some other feliow.
Democracy at Chicago will resolve a good
deal but dissolve altogether.
Cleveland may at least boast that he
elevated his party about as high as Gil
deroy's kitej^
The nearer the time comes for Democ
racy to act, the more it feels like moving
for a continuance.
Every Democrat has a plan for harmon
izing his party by kicking out every fellow
who doesn't agree with him.
A great many Democrats are not waiting
for the Chicago fiasco before coming out
for McKinley and protection.
The enthusiasm displayed at Canton
was an evidence of what is felt by work
ingmen throughout the Union.
Every intelligent man knows that work
and wages is the chief issue of the cam
paign, and all of them will vote that way.
In preparing for the Democratic con
vention Chicago should lay in an extra
supply of doctors who Know how to cure
fits.
The .Southern Pacific of Kentucky will
take notice that the people of California
are still watching the funding-bill in
iquity.
If the i>eroocrats do not look out they
will make of their convention as .big a
failure as Cleveland made of his adminis
tration.
The modern pugilist is useful in many
ways. When he is not promoting a char
ity, he is elevating the siageor reviving
baseball.
The speeches delivered yesterday by
WcKinley ana Thurston were about all the
Republican party really needs for cam
paign documents in this canvass.
The people are tired of destructive
parties and will vote this year for the only
party which can build up American in
dustry ana reconstruct prosperity.
Populism may gather up the fragments
of Democracy after the people have
smashed it in November, but the gather
ing vrill be hardly worth the trouble.
The farmers of the San Joaquin have
begun to profit by the competing railroad,
and now every section of California knows
how to make the Southern Pacific drop its
extortion.
When we have wages for the working
men and revenues for the Government,
the money question will be easily settled,
and the Republican party can be counted
on to settle it right.
A vote taken by the American Agricul
turist among its readers shows that the
farming community is largely in favor of
McKinley and protection, and the demand
of the voters was almost unanimous for a
restoration of reciprocity.
Judge Riddle of San Jose sized up the
Presidential situation from a Populist
point of view very neatly the other day by
saying the Populist party is big enough
for Stnator Teller to walk into if he
wishes, but the Senator is not big enough
for the party to get into even if it crawls.
Senator Thurston stated the pimple
truth in Maying to McKinley: "Your
nomination has been made in obedience
to a popular demand whose universality
and spontaneity attest the affection and
confidence of the plain people of the
United States. By common consent you
are their champion." That tells the
whole story.
When the notification committee reached
Canton, a rainstorm was imminent, but
as McKinley stepped from his doorway
the sun burst through the clouds and
banished the fears of the people. It was a
superb symbol of the political situation.
When McKiniey comes to the White
House all the clouds that bang over us
shall vanish and the period of prosperity
begin.
M'KINLEY'S ACCEPTANCE.
In his informal acceptance of the nomi
nation for President of the United States
by the Republican pariy yesterday, Mr.
McKiiiley sounded the keynote of the
campaign. He said: "Oar domestic trade
must be won back end our idle working
men employed in gaiuful occupation at
American wages." * * * "Protection
and reciprocity, twin measures of a true
American policy, should again corcmand
the earnest encouragement of the Govern
ment at Washington."
What else could the candidate of the
Republican party â the party that stands
for all the people â have said? Standing
there the representative of an overwhelm
ing majority of the people of the United
States, and seeing wreck and ruin in all
the channels of production, he could not
have done otherwise than tell the people
that ttie first wort in hand should be to
restore the highways of commerce and in
dustry that all the people might again
have opportunity to participate in profit
able employment.
Undoubtedly Mr. McKinley is in close
touch with the hearts and minds of the
people. As if by inspiration he voiced the
cry of the people when he said "protection
and reciprocity should again command
the encouragement of the Government at
Washington," only that the people said
"3hall" instead of "should." The people
demanded that they be sustained, encour
aged and defended against encroachment
of outside peoples upon their right to go
in pursuit of happiness and prosperity in
their own land, and they now have the
sincere promise of an honorable man that
it shall be so-
That is all Mr. McKinley or any other
man could have said under such circum
stances. A committee of the National
Convention had informed him, not only
of his nomination, but what the people
wculd require at his hands when he as
sumed the direction of the affairs of the
Nation. Mr. McKinley cheerfully pledged
his Donor and his manhood that he should
obey the will of the people â the more
cheerfully because what the people want
was in full harmony with what he knows
they should have, and which it will be a
pleasure to him to help them to receive.
And now the battie-cry is heard and it
gives ontno uncertain sound â "Protection
and reciprocity" and "Employment at
American wages." The highest and best
interests of Americans are involved in the
struggle for supremacy between the party
that has made waste places everywhere
and the party of rescue. It should not
take any one lonjj to decide where he will
be found when the lines are fully drawn.
There is, indeed, no middle ground.
There is the question of prosperity and
the question of enforced idleness and con
sequent poverty. Every voter must take
sides. He must be for prosperity or for
poverty. "Choose ye this day whom ye
wili serve."
But there is work for the Republican
party to do. Every Republican in Cali
fornia who is physically able should
attacn himself to a club, league or organi
zation of some other kind. There should
be felt the touch of shoulders all over the
State, and that sincere enthusiasm which
defies obstructions in the way should
abound. Let every Republican feel it to
be his personal duty to see that every
other Republican in his community is in
line. A mighty work is in hand, and the
salvation of the country will be the re
ward if the work is well done.
COMING EVENTS.
One week from to-day trouble will be
gin in Chicago, and meanwhile let
it not Be forgotten that Grover Cleveland
has never said that he would uot accept
the nomination. This is not the age of
prophecy, but straws indicate the course
of the wind, just as they always have.
The suspicion is growing that in the event
the convention declares unqualifiedly for
free-silver coinage at 16 to 1, without wait
ing for even an effort in the direction of
international co-operation, Cleveland wili
accept the nomination of the gold-stand
ard wing, not that he would expect to
carry many States, if indeed a single one,
but merely to preserve the party organiza
tion. It may seem a little queer that the
minority should undertake to save and
protect something that it is not in posses
sion of, but nothing could be surer than
the disintegration of the majority sooner
or later.
For many years the Democratic party
has made free trade the center and
circumference of its National policy, just
as the Republican party has made protec
tion to our industries the chief stone of
the cornerof its purpose, and neither party
could go forward upon a secondary propo
sition and long maintain its organization.
Mr. McKinley will be elected, of course,
because he holds aloft the central idea
of his party's principles â protection. The
nominee of the Chicago convention will
sustain a more disastrous defeat than he
would if his party held fast to free trade
as the issue of paramount importance.
No political party, preacher or newspaper
can depart from the fundamental princi
ples of its or his faith and doctrine and
stem the current of public condemnation.
One may abandon one's faith or doctrine
for another, but he must leave behind the
foundation and the capstone of that which
he quits.
Mr. Cleveland knows that the majority
wing of his party could not survive defeat,
because it would go into the battle for a
single purpose, and when that failed there
would be utter destruction on the field
and the cause itself would be utterly lost
forever. Cleveland coald, better than any
other man, lead the minority, which is, in
fact, the real Democratic party, away from
the pitfalls which Boies, Bland, Altgeld and
others are digging, and when they are
buried in pits of their own digging there
would be a large and strong nucleus round
which to rebuild â strong because it would
be in possession of the basic and, there
fore, the paramount principle of the party,
which is free trade. Whether Mr. Cleve
land is sufficiently in love with the princi
ples of nii party to make so great a sacri
fice is the question, but events the past
few days would eeem to indicate that he is
willing to do it. It is sincerely to be
hoped thac he may, the more so because
no one now believes that coalition between
the several political organizations that are
risking the country's life and the life of
their own party existence upon the hazard
of a sinle die can be effected. Let Mr.
Cleveland lead the free-trade hosts, for
the issue is protection or free trade and
upou that the battle must be fought.
SPAIN'S NEW LOAN.
There is no sense at all in trying to see
a deep conspiracy against the United
States in the loan that Spain has succeeded
in placing with the Rothschilds. Cer
tainly the Rothschilds would not have
loaned Spain $20,000,000 had any European
nation objected, but there is no reason
why there should be objection to letting
Spain have all the money she can possibly
borrow, nor is there any reason why some
of our fellow-citizens should go into
spasms over it. It is the business of the
Rothschilds to loan money, and as the
security they exact is a matter between
lender and borrower, tnere is no occasion
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 1896.
for some or any of our people bothering
their heads over the affair. Spain was
largely in debt to European bankers before
this loan was floated, and should she go to
the wall after the manner of a commercial
firm great loss would fall upon her credi
tors, but for all that we need lose no sleep
on that account. A little common-sense
is a (rood thing to weave into our conclu
sions about Spain and Cuba.
It is safe to conclude that every mon
archy on the face of the earth would like
to see Spain subjugate Cuba, but it is a
very different thing to join Spain in a war
with the United States. It would be much
cheaper to let Spain go into bankruptcy
and be 6old out than to put up money to
maintain a mere sentiment. Besides, the
powers of Europe know that the United
States is not huntimr for islands nor con
tinents to annex, and that their own out
lying territory is quite safe. They know
that this country sympathizes with the
Cubans in their struggle for separation
from the mother country, but they are not
afraid that this country will give the
Cubans official aid unless Spain provokes
it or the insurgents demonstrate their
ability to maintain themselves as an inde
pendent community.
It is no secret in Europe that the people
of this country are firm in the belief that
the Cuban revolution cannot be put down
by Bpain; that it is only a question of
time when the Republic of Cuba will be
recognized by all the nations, including
Spam, and that the time has come for the
President of the United States to officially
declare the will of the people by proclama
tion to the effect that the Cubans have
fully earned belligerent rights. But mean
while, if Spain can borrow money on her
silver mines, let her do it. It is none of
our business if she can dupe the Roths
childs. Let us not be "too previous."
SENATOR TELLER'S MISTAKE.
One would not have to dig very deep to
discover the meaning of Senator Thurs-
ton's wordÃ when speakine of Senators
Teller and Dubois at Cleveland the other
day. He said: "It is rather significant
that these two Senators were the only ones
to bolt, and that they were both up for re
election in silver communities. Those
who did not bolt were not up for another
term." It certainly is unfortunate for Tel
ler especially that he should have found it
necessary to bolt at so inopportune a time.
In all his political life Mr. Teller has been
a leader among the champions of protec
tion and whatever else was thoroughly
American. His defense of the early in
terpretation of the Monroe doctrine, and
his appeais for a strong ana pronounced
foreign policy in the Senate during its
last sitting were vigorous and logical. In
view of all this there will be more or less
suspicion, whether really well founded or
not, that Mr. Teller made up his mind
that his own political success was of moro
consequence to himself than the success
of his party.
Undoubtedly Mr. Teller will be his own
successor in the Senate, for all parties in
Colorado are for free silver; not only so,
but his party, which is master of the situ
ation when party lin^s are drawn, has
practically made him dictator until the
silver question is settled. The Angel
Gabriel could not be elected Senator from
Colorado on a platform that did not sub
ordinate every interest and need of the
country to free-silver coinage at the
present ratio. Undoubtedly Mr. Teller is
well acquainted with public sentiment in
his State, ana when It came to giving up
the Republican party or retiring to private
life his moral courage failed him and he
chose the epaulets of office instead of the
glory of consistency.
No one doubts Mr. Teller's sincerity on
the silver question, but the wonder is that
so wise a man could noUsee that the party
of the people of the United States were
determined to first restore their industries
and attend to the other needs of tiie Na
tion afterward. For nearly three years
that has been the central idea of the rank
and file of the Republican party, and
their will was forcibly and distinctly set
forth in the platform which they sent
delegates to St. Louis to formulate. It is
certainly unfortunate for Mr. Teller that
he did not sacrifice the senatorship for the
principles of the party which he helped to
establish forty years ago, and whose prin
ciples have never changed, except that
they have broadened and deepened, but
upon the original lines. He certainly
must have known that the Populists
would not take a high protectionist, which
he is, but a free-trader and paper-money
fiatist, which he is not. He knew, too,
that he could not if he would and would
not if he could turn Democrat and accept
the Chicago nomination. It must be that
the temptation to secure another term in
the United Slates Senate was too great for
him to resist;
NEW YORK IGNORANCE.
Senator Tillman a few days ago told a
New York audience they were more igno
rant of the conditions of the United
States than any other class of American
people. He explained his remark by say
ing that New York residents derive their
information of the West and the South
from the newspapers of that city and these
newspapers come much nearer represent
ing the opinion of England than a true
Americanism.
Tillman's words were not absolutely ac
curate. The Senator from South Carolina,
like every. other demagogue, prefers to say
strong things rather tban things which
are true. Nevertheless, the statement of
the Senator has at least a substratum of
truth. If divided into three parts it
would be found it was not all gall. One
third of it at least was as near the plain
truth concerning New York as the news
papers of that city, ever come to telling
the truth about other sections of the
Union.
If any proof were needed of the sub
stantial accuracy of Tillman's charge con
cerning the ignorance of New Yorkers in
regard to their own country it could be
found in a recent number of the New
Yorlc Commercial Advertiser. This journal,
which circulates among the more intelli
gent people of the metropolis, and repre
sents fairly well the opinion of the wealth,
the culture and t tie business of the city,
recently in an elaborate article on the
political situation and its effect on Wall
street, said:
"The fact ia, and the sooner intelligent
people realize it the better, that a large
section of the country lying chiefly south
of Mason arid Djxon's line and west of the
Mississippi River is peopled by men who
are unfitted in many respects, or at least
in some respects, to exercise the full fran
chise of citizenship of the United States."
When a journal enjoying the repute of
the Commercial Advertiser publishes state
ments of that kind what are we to think
of the intelligence of the community
where it circulates? Certainly Till man
was right in charging them with being
tiie most ignorant of their own country
men of any people in America. New
York City with her Tammany Hall voters
rising up to declare that the people west
of the Mississippi River are unfitted to
exercise the franchise of citizenship is a
picture to amuse both men and angels.
IT this is not ignorance raised by self
conceit to the height of impudence what
is it?
When the people of the great West are
not better fatted to exercise the full fran
chise of citizenship of the United States
than the denizens of the Blums of New
York, who back up by their votes the
boodier* of Tammany Hall and the
brokers of Wall street, patriots may be
pardoned if they begin to despair of the
Republic. In the meantime if the leading
newspapers of New York intend to be of
any service to their readers they had
better begin telling the truth about the
West and the South. Such statements as
the one quoted make no friends for any
body. They are better suited for British
readers than for Americans of any class,
and the fact that they find credence among
New Yorkers fully justifies the strongest
things Tillman said of their ignorance.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
FREE SILVER AND WHEAT.
Reasons for Believing thk Free Coinage of
Silver Would Benefit Wheat Growers.
Editor The Call : Will you kindly allow me
space for a fsw words in reply to Mr. -Heenan's
communication wherein he contends that the
remonetization of silver would lessen rather
than increase the price of wheat?
Mr. Heenan evidently loses sight of the fact
that an ounce of silver bullion, worth now
about 67 cents, will purchase as much wheat
as it would when it was worth $1 29, and he
does not take into consideration the further
fact that it was the demonetization of silver
that reduced it from $1 29 to 67 cents an
ounce; and he argues on the hypothesis that
its remonetization would have no effect on its
price. All bimetallism contend that the mo
ment silver shall be restored to its old place
and be given its old- function as a money metal
its former price would be restored. Should
that occur it is quite clear, so clear that no argu
ment is needed to prove it, that the price of
wheat aua everything else that men have to
sell would be advanced in like manner.
In other words, the inflation went Id be taken
off from gold, the stimulus that au increased
volume of money always gives would be felt
in all branches of business, there wonld be
work for all anil pay for their work, and pros
perity would become once more the rule and
not the exception.
Mr. Heenan tinds another bugbear in what
he is pleased to term the fluctuations in the
price of silver. When did he ever hear of
fluctuations in the price of silver prior to
1873? The silver dollar had been the standard
unit of values in the United States for nearly &
hundred years, and during all that time there
was no talk of fluctuating values. It is cer
tainly fair to presume that were the former
conditions as to use restored the former condi
tion of stability would follow, as effect always
follows cause. .Respectfully,
Henry Nelson.

HER PIES.
' Way back in the sweet, sweet long ago,
V.'ben the world seemed just newly made.
Ana the hours swept in a gold batteau
O'er pleasure a bright cascade,
'Twas then in childhood's realm I met
Dear Maude of the dewy eyes.
And stood entranced us the deft brunette
Hid fashion the wee din pies.
We're married now. and the self-same bands
That molded the pies of clay
Have sometimes structured other brands
Of pies In the modern way;
And, having sampled these pastry plants
My oath I can solemnly take
That between the two I'd risk my chance
With the kind that she used to make.

BRITISH ENTHUSIASM.
In England the bicycle craze appears to be
just getting a good start, judging by an an
nouncement in the latest Westminster Gazette.
A big company with f.~>,000,000 capital has
been incorporated, with the Right Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain and a dozen lords as sharehold
ers. "The corporation's announcement sets
forth that the first works to be taken over is
already a most prosperous manufactory, run
ning early and late, now adding immense ex
tensions, with its shares freely dealt in at a
considerable premium on the market. New
cycle improvements are always appearing.
The New Beeston's lady's bicycle, enabling the
rider to stop without dismounting, stands still
by itself, may be left standing while shopping
or visiting, and is mounted while stationary.
So certain are the prospects of the cycle and
motor cycle that the most sober-minded are
beginning to consider the propriety of aban
doning their own competitive, overdone call
ings for the prizes now available in supplying
the wants ot the ever-increasinK numbers of
the cycling public. Even members of her
Majesty's Government are seeking the same na
tional and rapidly rising investment. Indeed,
cycling is bringing a complete changeover our
everyday lives, and all in favor of its own
business. Now that even children â the new
generationâ are taught it, there will be appar
ently no end to the futuredemand. In Coven
try the board schools are now compelled to
have separate rooms, where the school chil
dren may put up their bicvcies as they do their
coats. Hundreds of children, both boys and
girls, go to school on bicycles, and before long
it will be as necessary to teach them to ride as
to walk. All the world will cycle. Agents are
now going down to Coventry with hundreds of
pounds in cash to offer for machines; but their
money is being refused, and they return with
out being Rble to obtain them, notwithstand
ing that premiums are freely offered. The
pressure shows no signs of abatement. The
Whitsuntide has seen the price of cycles in
creased to such an extent that in somecaÂ«es
they are 25 per cent higher in price, while the
cost has been but little increased." If the Brit
ish Government will only permit our Yankee
made wheels to land in London without pay
ing duty the blockade of the bicycle market
may be quickly raised and the tendency for
lower prices somewhat arrested.
FOR EXTRA WAISTS.
A charming model for extra waists of silk :
batiste or other cotton.
It has a fitted lining, the material being
seamless both back and front. The box-pleat
is cut separate and sewn on, which is less
troublesome for the maker than to have it cut
in one piece with the front.
A serge dress of black had the shoulder-straps
of bright rose-colored ribbon overlaid with
white embroidery. The Dox-pleats were of
white lawn, with a ruffle of narrow Valen
ciennes lace on the edge of each fold. The
sleeves on this gown reached to the wrist. The
pattern Is made with the sleeves a little longer
than shown In the picture lor those -who do
like too short a sleeve.
A printed organdy made after this model
was trimmed with bretolles of ribbon, with a
bow on the shoulder. Over the stock collar,
which was of the same violet ribbon, were tiny
points of white nainsook, edged with lace, six
of these points just meeting extended all
around the collar, being sewed in at the top
and overlapping the collar, points downward.
A white lawn nad a body of open embroid
ery with the box-pleats of the lawn. The
trimming ol Dresden ribbon extended up from
the waist only as far as the bust in front,
where it ended in bows, and was omitted en
tirely in the back. The belt and collar were of
ribbon. Two piccadilly points of embroidery
were set over the collar in front.
The pattern is No. 7835 a:td i* cut in seven
sizesâ 3o, 32, 34. 36, 3b, 40 and 42 inches bust
measure. A medium sine requires five yards
of 21, or two and a half yards of 42 inch mate
rial.

In England the courts take a just view of
the rights of wheelmen, as will be seen by the
following article in the Westminster Gazette:
"Dr. Jackson yesterday held an inquest at
Croydon concerning the death of John Albert
White, aged 17, the only son of Mr. White of
Croydon, who died from injuries received in a
collision between his bicycle and a cart. After
hearing evidence the Coroner said it behooved
drivers to be very careful now ao many people
had taken to bicycling. It was a healthy re
creation and ought to be encouraged. Drivers
were too apt to be intolerant to bicyclists and
to think that the road was made for them
alone. Ho hoped that in future they would be
more careful and keep as much as they could
on the right side of the road."

phere is fragrant with something that is even
sweeter than the delicate perfume they exhaie.

The question "When the members of a secret
society become delinquent and the society is
called upon to surrender Its charter, to whom
does the property of the society belong?" can
not be answered directly, as different rules
prevail. In some organizations it is held that
on the society surrendering its charter every
thing reverts to the grand body; in others
that only the charter and regalia revert to the
grand body. If you will name the particular
order w which you refer an answer will be
furnished.

ITS BIG SALMON
TEEM IN MILLIONS,
Avasha Bay, Kamchatka, a
Virgin Field for
Fish.
FLANS FOR A CANNERY.
Admiral Evashintsoff Has Come
Here to Get American
Capital.
CONCESSION FROM THE CZAR.
Wants $250,000 so as to Hire Chinese
Labor and Turn Out 1000
Cases a Day.
Rear-Admiral William Evashintsoff of
the Russian navy arrived here yesterday
on a leave of absence, secured that he
might interest American capitalists in the
promotion of a great salmon-fishing in
dustry for which he has been given a
special concession by the Emperor of
Russia.
The proposed fishery is Avasha Bay, an
extensive and natural salmon trap on the
coast of Kamchatka, in latitude 53 de
grees, or a little to the southeast of the
extremity of the Alaska archipelago.
"I have come here," said the Russian
admiral when seen in his apartments at
the Palace, "to establish a fish business
and to find capital to build and equip a
cannery.
"Offers were made in Astoria, but they
were on too small a scale. I want to turn
out not less than 200,000 cases of salmon
a year and may be as many as 1000 cases a
day. In order to do that a capital of $250,000
| is requirea for the establishment of a suit
| able cannery.
"The Emperor granted me the conces
sion on March 27 for a period of ten years,
with the privilege of renewal. The right j
virtually amounts to a monopoly.
"Avasha Bay is not nearly so far north i
as most Americans think. It is in the
same latitude as the southern boundary of
Alaska, and has a very much milder I
climate than place 3 in the same latitude
in Europe, because it is tempered by the j
Japan stream. The bay is fifteen miles
long by ten miles wide and has a very
Barrow entrance. Several rivers tlow into '
| it from small lakes, so it is a natural fish- |
I trap. And fishâ well, the Columbia River
is not to be compared with it. Is it a
bigger field? You bet it is.
"I have been tnere many times while on i
my cruises in China waters. With my !
own eyes I have seen how thick the fish I
are. I have been in my own boat and j
have seen the movement of waters caused j
by the big schools of fish. There are king- !
finh, bluebacks and silver-sides, and their j
I flesh is that rich red so much prized in the j
market.
"In the first place the field is absolutely
untouched, and in the second place I am j

allowed to can an unlimited number of
cases. Tbe place is free of duty and there
are no restrictions as to how the fish shall
be caught. The season begins in May and
lasts until the middle of October, with the
salmon running all the time.
'"My idea is to employ cheap Chinese
labor, and to supply Knjjlish, Japanese,
Chinese and other markets of the world
with salmon. I was In London last sum
mer, and while there I learned that there
never can be too much canned salmon for
the English market.
"On Avasha Bay there is the small town
of Petiopavlovsk, which has not more
than 200 inhabitants.
"I want American capitalists. Our
Russian merchants, though many of them
have plenty of money, are slow about
taking hold of a new enterprise. But if I
am not successful here I shall resort to
Moscow.
"I have been in the Russian navy for
forty-four yearsâ ever since I finished in
the naval academy in St. Petersburg. I
nad one leave of absence twenty-seven
years ago. This is my second. It is for
no stated time, but rests with me to con

once witii my family, as we passed

THE LABOR UNIONS.
The Building Trades' Council Will
Elect Two New Business
Agents To-Night.
The unions affiliated with the Building
Trades' Council will hold a mass-meeting
to-night at 115 Turk street for the election
of two business agents or walking dele
gates. There are about eight candidates
in the fieid and the race for the positions
is lively and interesting. It requires
about as much wire-pulline to secure such
a position as it does to secure a place in
the City government.
The retiring business agents are C. F.
Schadt and J. J. Connelly. It is known
that the latter is a candidate for re-elec
tion. He has the full indorsement of the
Plasterers' Union, of which he is a mem
ber.
The JLabor Bureau Association moved
yesterday from its old quarters at 115
Turk street, where it has been for the past
two years, to its new headquarters at 915)4
Market street.
The new premises are furnished with
readine-room, billiard-tables and card and
game tables. In the top story there are
several lodge or meeting rooms that will be
arranged at once for unions and societies.
The Iron Molders' Union No. 164 met
last evening and elected the following
officers for the . ensuing terra : President,
William T. Boyce; vice-president, H. T.
Edwards; secretary, Mark Noble; treas
urer, Samuel McK.ee; recording secretary,
R. Burnett; sergeant-at-arms, Thomas
Hurd; executive committee â C. Bailey, T.
Hurd, R. Simmons, H. Collins and M.

Active preparations are being made for
the excursion to Sunset Park which will
be heid on July 19. Over 100 gate and
game prizes will be offered, two of which
are fine ranges.

last night the stand of the San Francisco

WHILES AT PLAY
NEAR ALCATRAZ,
Kept the Steamer Tiburon
Company for Over a
Mile.
THREE OF THEM GAME IN
One Sprang Clear of the Water
and Its Descent Shook
the Tiburon.
FOOTPADS ON THE CITY FRONT
One of Them Caught in tbe Act of
Going Thrrugh a Man's
Pockets.
Three whales made their way in
through the Golden Gate yesterday and i
had a great time of it for two or three
hours with the Sausalito and Tiburon fer
ry-boats as they came and went on their
hourly trips. Two of the mammals were
praybacks and one, Captain White of the
Tiburon is confident, was a sperm. It was
of enormous proportions and three times
the size of either of the other leviathans.
The graybacks spouted about the steamer
for over a mile of her course. One
of them jumped almost clear of the water
and then sounded. The last seen of him
was his tail which waved for an instant in
the air and then vanished. The sperm
whale remained by the Tiburon for a time
and then it also sank out of sight.
On the return trip they again put in an
appearance, and Captain White came to
the conclusion that they were feeding on
the small fish with which the bay abounds
at this time of the year. They did not
seem to be a bit afraid of the steamer, and
evidently took her and tbe noiEe she was
making for one of their own kind at
play. It would probably fare badly with
any of the bay cref* that should happen to
strike one of these monsters on a dark i
night The last seen of the trio they were
working their way slowly back to the
Heads.
Work on the new branch postoffice to
be established at the foot of Market street
is to begin at once. The old building has
been torn down, and the hackmen and ex
press drivers have been moved from their
stand in order to make room for the work- !
men. As soon as the new office is built
and equipped Postmaster McCoppin will
inaugurate his new cable-car system of
mail delivery.
The Sausalito boats have been moved
into the Tiburon slip and the latter boats
now occupy one nearer Market street.
The fender piles in the old iausalito slip
were so eaten away by the teredo that it
is a wonder they stood as long as
they did. Yesterday, when some of the
fastenings were removed, over 100 feet of
them fell with a crash. The whole slip
was locked with them and they had to be
removed before the pile-driver could be |
got in.
The mooring place of the Comanche
was moved close in shore yesterday. She |
is now close to Folsom-street wharf and
will be very handy for the Naval Reserve
boys when they "want to go out to her.
The tug Governor Markham brought the
monitor into Howard 3 and then moved
the mooring, after which the Comanche
was taken out to her new quarters.
Samuel Chase and Oliver Mellon, two
young lads, had a narrow escape from
their lives yesterday. They hired a sail
boat at Tiburon for a fishing trip. They
knew very little about handling tbe sails,
and in consequence they were twice nearly
capsized. A neavy squall struck the boat
and it half filled with water. Luckily the
peak halyards gave way and the sail came
down or both would have been drowned.
They were drifting down on Goat Island,
when one of the boys took off his shirt and
managed to signal the tug Governor
Irwin. She picked them up and towed
the boat to San Francisco. It will be
many moons before Samuel and Oliver
go fishing again.
Thomas Donnelly was caught in the act
of fobbing J. J. M. Evans on Drumm street
last night by Officer Hennebery, and was
promptly arrested. He had Evans np
against a brick wall and was going through
his pockets when caught. When ordered
to hold up his hands Evans took them out
of his pocttets, and also took all his money
($3) with them. Donnelly was charged
with attempting to commit grand larceny.
The schooner Aloha arrived from Hono
lulu yesterday after a Jong passage of
thirty-four days. Light winds and calms
caused the delay.
DIRTY STREETS AGAIN.
Money Taken From the Sweeping Fund
for Other Purposes.
The members of the Merchants' Associa
tion are anything but pleased with the
conduct of the Supervisors with reference
to street-sweeping. This was a hobby
with the association, which a year or so
ago kept the streets clean to show that it
could be done.
Yesterday a number of the members ob
served that the street -sweeping gang had
been laid off and that the streets ami gut
terways were rapidly filling with dirt ami
tilth. This stun was blown in all direc
tions by the wind greatly to the annoy
ance of the general public.
The reason that the streets were not
cleaned was because the Supervisors had
drawn upon the street-sweeping fund.
This fund has a surplus of $30,000 to its
credit, but since the general funds have
been exhausted the Supervisors have taken

EASY MONEY FOR TSCHURR.
Market-Street Company Allows a Dam
age Suit by Default.
For a few moments yesteraay it seemed
as though L. J. Tschurr had secured a lit
tle easy money. Abont two weeks ago
Tschurr began suit against the Market
street Railway Company for $10,000 dam
ages for injuries sustained by being thrown
from the dummy of a Market-street car.
Notice of the suit was served upon Nicho
las T. Smith, treasurer of the company, on
June 15, but for some reason the company
failed to enter either an answer or a de
murrer in the time specified by law, and in
consequence yesterday Morgan Backus,
the Deputy County Clerk, entered a de
fault against the defendant.
In some manner the attorneys for the
railway got notice of this proceeding and
there was an immediate rush to circum
vent it. An application for a stay of pro
ceedings was entered and Judge Slack
granted ten days' time to the defendants
to show cause why judgment should not
be entered against them.
MORE CLERKS ALLOWED,
Registrar Hinton Authorized to
Employ Twelve Ad
ditional.
The Election Commissioners Will In*
sist on Precinct Registra
tion.
At the meeting of the Board of Election
Commissioners yesterday forenoon Max
Popper ana Fred Ruabe, representing a
committee of the Iroqnois Club, desired
the Commissioners to announce whether
precinct registration would be ordered.
They indicated that it was their purpose
to bring a test case provided that the Com
missioners should deny precinct registra
tion.
The Commissioners took the position |
that Registrar Hinton would decide, and j
the Registrar announced that he would
carry out the provisions of precinct regis
tration as formerly.
The new or general law which the Regis
trar is now recognizing requires registra
tion to begin 160 days before the election
and to close in August. No provision is
made for precinct reeistration, and Mr.
Popper and Mr. Raabe hoped to obtain a
declaration from the board that facilities
would or would not be provided for regis
tering in the precincts so that in the event
of a negative decision a foundation might
be established for iroing into court and
testing the applicability of the general law
in this respect to the City and County of
San Francisco.
Incidentally it was stated by City and
County Attorney Creswell that County
Clerk Curry would not resist the right of
the Registrar to prepare and print the
ticket, although the new general law pro
vides that this work should be done by the
County Clerk of any county or consoli
dated city and county. Hopes had been
entertained, evidently, that a test of the
law might be made on action of the County
Clerk challenging the Registrar's right to
prepare the ticket.
Auditor Broderick suggested that the
County Clerk had been advised by some
able and intelligent lawyer against any in
terference.
At the next meeting of the Commission
ers the subject will be reopened, and per
haps some action may be taken by the
board to open tbe way for a test case.
Registrar Hinton i 3 inclined to offer all
facilities for registering. When Mr. Pop
per requested evening registration, the
Registrar expressed willingness to comply
with the request, stating that under the
present rule the office was open Saturday
evenings.
The Registrar announced that he needed
twelve additional clerks. Commissioners
Creswell, Black and Tilton voted for a
resolution authorizing the employment of
that number. Auditor Broderick voted
against it. The Auditor is impressed with
the belief that provisions for registration
in San Francisco have not been changed
by the amendments to the general law.
Messrs. Broderick and Creswell ex
pressed a willingness to go right ahead at
present with the appointments of precinct
election officers.
The communication from the Republi
can County Committee, published in The
Call Sunday, requesting the appointment
of George Lewis to duty in the registration
department, was referred to Registrar
Hinton.
A large batch of salary warrants for
June received the approval of the board
without delay or discussion.
It is said that the twelve additional
clerks authorized by the meeting yester
day will be selected from a long list of
Democratic applicants, although it is pos
sible that Surveyor Tilton may manage to
get two Republicans appointed. The
Registrar of Voters, owing his own ap
pointment to Governor Budd, may listen
to suggestions from Stockton and Sacra- j
mento before closing the list of clerks to j
be named. j
TROUBLES FOLLOW
THE BLAIRMORE.
Broke Adrift When Nearly-
Raised and Went Down
Again.
WRECKED THE CATALINA
The Pumps and Superstructure
Broke From Their Fast
enings.
PUMPS WENT TO THE B3TTOM.
Narrow Escape of the Whitelaw in
the General Wreck â She
Nearly Capsized.
Disaster seems to follow the unfortunate
Blairmore. On several occasions all the
difficulties seemed to have been overcome
and Captain Burns would feel confident
that the vessel would be up and alongside
the wharl inside of twenty-four hours.
Then the pumps would choke up, the
hawsers would part or some other part of
the complicated macninery would break
down and all the work would have to be
done over again.
Two new pumps were purchased last
week ana placed in position, but last Sun
day the flange of one of them broke and
the work was again cle!a\-ed. Yesterday
the worst disaster of the series took place
and at one time it looked as though a
fatality was imminent. The wrecker
Whitelaw was hauled over by the heeling
ship until her deck was under water, and
the crew made a frantic rush for the boats.
The schooner Catalina had her masts
swept out in the general ruin, the pumps
are either under water or ruined and the
foremast of the Blairmore snapped off
close to tbe deck. The hull tnen sank
back into its old position and all the work
will have to be started almost from the
beginning again.
At daybreak Captain Whitelaw had
everything in readiness for what every
body wascertai.i would be the final effort.
The Whitelaw had been alongside the
bilge of the sunken ship, and steel haw
sers were run from her powerful derricks
to the masts of the Blairmore. The tugs
Sea King and Monarch had their hawsers
fastened to the hull and their engines were
doing their best. Slowly the sunken ves
sel was moved inshore, and as there was a
tendency shown to settle back on the level
bilge, the schooner Catalina was moved
around ana the foremast of the Blairmore
was eot over a boiler on the schooner's
deck.
Everything went well for a time, and the
two small pumps that were still intact did
good work. As tbe hold was freed of
water the hull rose considerably and then
the trouble began. The foremast besan to
work and its weight almost submerged the
Bchooner. Just when everybody expected
to see the Catalina go down the mast
napped and the Blairmore began to roll
jver. The working of the broken stick
swept the masts out of the schooner and
nearly carried some of the crew overboard.
All the weight was now on the Whitelaw's
derricks, and when she began to keel over
to a dangerous angle the crew thought it
was time to leave. The Blairmore only
went a certain distance, however, and the
strain on the hawsers was soon eased up.
Captain Burns is disheartened but not
discouraged. "A wee bit more and she
would have come," was his remark. "'lt
was the fortune of war, ana we must abide
by it." Captain Whitelaw felt worse than
anybody over the disaster. He has worked
like a beaver from the start, and there are
no three men in his employ that can ac
complish half as much as he. Morning,
noon and night have seen him at work,
and during the past fortnignt he has lost
fourteen pounds in weight. "We'll have
to try again," wa3 the only remark he
made.
This morning will see all hands at work
repairing the broken fences. The pumps
will be recovered if possible, and if un
serviceable new ones will be put in their
place. In the general crash the wooden
structure that looked like a house on the
vessel's bilge, and on which the tanks of
water rested, broke a"?ray from the hull
and went floating up with the tide. It
was recovered and will be placed inposi
tion and the vessel got as near as
possible on an even keel again. All this
will necessarily take time, and it will
probably be & week before another attempt
can be made. The vessel is now in twelve
feet less water than when the first attempt
was made, so that the next effort will be
attended with fewer aifficulties.
VICTIM OF AN OLD TRICK.
Lazaret Baznro, a Florist at Colma,
Swindled by Two Men.
Luigi Doni and Dominici Bianchi on
June 14 paid a visit to Lazaro Bazuro, a
florist at Colma, and represented them
selves as agents for a wealthy Italian syn
dicate that wanted to buy up several
nurseries.
They asked Bazuro if he was willing to
sell, and, if so, at what figure. Bazuro
named $1000, and they gladdened his
heart by telling him they could get $3000
from the syndicate. Then they asked

SLEEPY JAKE SIT
ON KEARNEY STREET
Irvin Earuch, a Poker-
Player, Wielded the
Revolver.
FIRED INTO HIS BACK.
The Bullet Extracted and the
Wound Found to Be Only
Superficial.
WHAT LED TO THE SHOOTING.
Baruch Was the Principal Witness in
a F.lony Case Against Rosen
heim Years Ago.
The report of a pistol on Kearny street,
between Sutter and Post, about 9 o'clock
last night attracted quite a crowd of
people, and also Policemen Engel and
Dougherty.
The man who fired the shot was Irvin
Barucb, formerly a merchant tailor on
Grant avenue and later the proprietor of a
poker game in this City. The man who
â¢was shot was Jacob Rosenheim, alias
â¢'Sleepy Jake," a well-known confidence
operator and gambler.
Rosenheim and a friend were walking
up Kearny street, when Baruch sneaked
up behind Rosenheim and fired a shot
into his back. The street was crowded at
the time, and before Baruch could fire an
other shot W. W. McNeil, who is con
nected with the railroad mail service,
grabbed him and took the revolver from
him. Policemen Engel and Dougherty,
who had heard the shot, arrived upon the
scene and placed Baruch under arrest.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
Rosenheim was driven to the Receiving
Hospital, Baruch and the two policemen
accompanying him. Dr. Bunnell ex
tracted the bullet, which bad entered be
low the right shoulder. The wound is
only a superficial one and Rosenheim will
soon be all right atain.
Baruch was taken to the City Prison and
booked on the charge of assault to murder.
He was laboring under considerable ex
citement, and when informed that the
wound was not fatal he expressed his re
gret tbat he had made such a poor job of
it. Tbe revolver was booked as evidence
against him.
"This man Rosenheim," he said, "hÂ«s
been threatening to kill me for year 3. and
this morning he made an attempt, but it
â was frustrated. I then armed myself, and
when I saw him on Kearny street to-night,
I did not give him the chance to try it on
again, but walked up behind him ahd shot
Dim.
"Seven or eijrht years ago I was the prin
cipal witness against Rosenheim in Judge
Garber's court in a case against him. He
had a machine with an electrical attach
ment whereby he professed to be able to
turn out $5 gold pieces that could not be
distinguished from the genuine ones. He
tried it upon me and I notified Captain
Loos. The result was Rosenheim was ar
rested and convicted in the Superior Court.
He appealed to the Supreme Court and
the conviction was sustained. Since then
he has threatened repeatedly to kill me.
"I have passed many sleepless nights
since, and these gray hairs are the result
of the mental agony I have nridergone
owing to that man's threats. lam sorry
I did not kill him."
Rosenheim, after serving his sentence in
San Quentin, was ordered out of the State.
He remained away till within the past few
months. He is one of the most notorious
confidence operators that ever visited this
City.
Rosenheim was unarmed, at least the
police did not find a revolver in his pockets
when he was searched at the hospital.
LUCKY PLAYED CROQUET
How Baldwin and Lily Passed
the Time at the Santa
Anita Ranch.
Iv Judge black's court yesterday An
drew Anderson told how "Lucky" Bald
win played croquet in the garden with
Lillian Ashley. It was in the garden at
the Santa Anita ranch, in the sweet
springtime two years ago.
When they were not driving the little
wooden balls through the wickets, they
were riding on horseback over the fertile
Baldwin acres, testified the witness. They
rode and rode like two centaurs, if Mr.
Anderson's word may be relied upon, and
made mutual love in their ridings. He
was an employe on the Santa Anita ranch,
and saw with shy, averted eyes E. J. and
Lillian a-wooing go.
"I think Mr. Baldwin was with Miss
Ashley most all the time," said Anderson.
"He"iust froze to her side, didn't he?"
asked Higbton.
"Yes â never let go."
Witness met Baldwin and Miss Ashley
at the racetrack in St. Louis a few months
later, he said, and she appeared to be in
trouble. Her eyes were teary, and there
was naught of the Santa Anita joyousness
about her. He went up in the grana stand
and spot--, to Baldwin and that gentleman
reprimanded bim for appearing before
him in his shirt sleeves.
Presently Baldwin's dignity unbent
somewhatand he chatted about old times
on the California rancho.
"I asked him," said Anderson, "what
was the matter with Miss Ashley." Mr.
Baldwin said she was in some kind of
trouble and accused him of being the cause
of it. Then he acknowledged that there
was grounds for the complaint, or some
thing to that effect.
"I then toki him that he should know
better than get into an affair like that, as
he had had enoueh experience of that kind
to learn something. I told him he ought
to carry a receipt-book with him and be
more business-like."
The mention of this practical sugges
tion of Mr. Baldwin's mentor started a
smile rippling cheerily over the placid
surface of the court.
Anderson's memory on subjects other
than Baldwin's alleged naughty actions
was somewhat murky. He couid not re
membei the date of any of his three wed
dings or any one of his employer's horses.
He was finally dismissed from tue wit
ness-stand to get his diary.
The first witness in the morning session
was the defendant, who testified that he
did not in 1891 offer to send Miss Ashley
to school. That was in Winchester, Mass.,
where he was visiting her. To all the fair
Lillian's importuning he had said he
would ''see about it."
Nathaniel Carter was placed on the
stand and testified that he had never told
Miss Ashley, as had been reported, that
Baldwin had fixed the San Francisco
courts and she could not get her case
through them.
The trial coes on this morning at 11
o clock.

FREUD MAKES AN ANSWER
His Courteous Reply to the
Women of the Liberal
League.
He Deals With Their Resolutions
Only So Far as They Affect
the New Charter.
J. Richard Freud, the attorney and sec
retary of the Merchants' Association,
takes very good-naturedly the criticism of
the American Women's Liberal League.
He said that the women were unneces
sarily personal in referring to himself.
He said that when women attack a man
the latter is always at a disadvantage
because ihe former seem to have privileges
and are allowed tactics in the assault that
are denied to the sterner sex.
He stated that the attack upon himself
had caused much amusement among cis
friends and business acquaintances and
added:
In replying I certainly shall not make an
swer to anything that refers to me or my
motives. I would, however, reply to the
league's denunciation of the uew charter as
per printed resolutions. These resolutions re
late entirely to one particular section of the
article in the chaiter upon public schools.
It is naiurrtl and proper that the subject of
education should receive tbe special attention
of all ladies interested in public affairs, and I
do not propose in any measure to discourage
their praiseworthy efforts iv this direction.
In fact, the charter itself manfully opens the
portals of the public service to their sex in the
following explicit provisions: Article VII.
chapter 1, section 1 provides that "the Bchool
Directors shall be appointed without regird to
sex." Again, Article XII on the civil Rervice,
section 11, requires that "sex shall be disre
garded" wherever and whenever possible.
In order that the objections of these ladies
may be correctly stated and answered let the
exact larguuge of the charter be quoted.
Article VII, chapter 1, section 4, says that "the
Board of Education shall not appoint any per
son to be a teacher in the primary or grammar
classes of the schools of this City and County
except upon competitive examination of those
persons holding teachers' certificates, and
who hare been educated in the public-school
system .of the State of California. The portion
of this section to which these ladies oDject ia
the requirement that teachers shall be edu
cated in the public-school system of our State.
The objections to this provision as set forth
in the resolutions of the Women's League may
be completely summarized in two countsâ first,
it is claimed that this provision is narrow, be
cause it will exclude persons educated outside
of California; and, second, that it is sectional,
because it will exclude persons not educated
iv the school system of our State.
As to the first claim, I frankly admit that in
theory it appears somewhat narrow to shut
out Eastern and foreign teacher* from any
portion of our public schools. While this may
appear so theoretically, it is the reverse in
practice. There are 680 teachers in the pri
mary and grammar classes of the public
schools of San Francisco. There are three
normal schools in California, namely, at San
Jose, Chico and Los Angeles, with an attend
ance of 1381 pupils, expecting to become
teachers in our public schools. It is an undis
puted fact that for want of opportunity to
teach in our public schools, ninny of theÂ«e
young men and women graduates, some of |
whom are native sons and daughters, are
forced into Interior vocations. To my knowl
edge there are capable and deserving gradu-
Rles of the University of California, holding
teachers' certificates, who have been driven
into menial occupations because the public |
schools were already filled with teachers, i
many of whom are recent immigrants to Cali- I
fornla from Eastern and European countries. I
The Influence necessary to secure positions as
teachers in our ipublic schools unfortunately
does not at present always depend upon merit,
ability or capacity. Viewed from this stand
point, therefore, this provision of the charter
is based upon the most patriotic motives of
self -preservation.
As to the second objection that this pro
vision of the charter is sectional because it
will exclude persons from becoming teachers i
who are not educated in oar public school sys- j
tern, 1 have bt;en Informed by the framers of i
the charter that no such illiberal spirit was :
contemplated or intended. In truth, tne many
broad and liberal provisions throughout
the charter bearing upon rellgluos free
dom and tolerance warrants the belief
that no sectional feeling animated any of
its framers. Article VII, chapter 4, section
4, says: "It shall be the duty of the
Superintendent of Schools to see that no re
ligious or sectarian books or teachings are al
lowed in the schools." Article XII on the civil
service, section 7, says: "No question in any
examination shall relate to political or re
ligious opinions or affiliations.
If the foregoicg explanations are not en
tirely convincing the women's Liberal League
should remember that the same power that j
â¢ uthorlzed the creation of the charter also i
provides for Its amendment. Section 8, Article !
XI, of tbe constitution of California says:
"I'he charter, so ratified/ may be amended at
intervals ot not less than two years, at a gen
eral or special election, by at least three-fifths
of the qualified electors voting thereat, and
approved by the Legislature, as herein pro
vided for the approval of tbe charter." In
other words, every two years the people, by
three-fifths vote, may amend the charter in
the same manner as they made it. The only
difference is the requirement of tnree-fifths
instead of one-half of tbe votes polled, which
in an election of 60,000 voters would make
36,000 instead of 30.000. Finally the charter
itself, at any time after its adoption, may be
entirely supplanted in the same manner and I
by the same vote as it was created and passed.
In conclusion, I cannot refrain from appeal- |
ing to the Women's Liberal League, as well as |
to every fair-minded lady in San Francisco, to |
study the new charter in all its parts. No or
ganic law ever devised has been absolutely
perfect. No human work is infallible. The
constitution of the United State* has been
amended fifteen dUtlnct times. The constitu
tion of California, only 18 years of age, has j
been chanced by vote of the people in more
than a score oi its provisions.
Six nevr Hmendments to the constitution of
California will be voted upon at tbe next elec- j
tlon. It would, indeed, be a sad commentary j
upon the wisdom and intelligence of those I
who expect soon to become enfranchised to:
discard tbe entire ch&iter with its manifold j
recognized blessing because it contains one ob- j
jectionable clause. If such a course were gen
erally pursued progress in the science of gov
ernment would be wholly arrested.
The new charter is by no meam perfect. |
But, taken as a whole, it is a careful, liberal
and effective exposition of modern municipal
law. Nearly all its important provisions are
extracted from the successful charters of the
most progressive cities of the world. I earn
estly advocate it* adoption because I sincerely
believe it will restore confidence and pros-
Deri ly to San Francisco. To the generous peo
ple of California I am forever Indebted for an
education, begun thirty-two years ago in the
primary schools of San Francisco and com
pleted twenty years ago In tne University of
California. It would be gross Ingratitude on
my part to fail, at this critical moment, to
contribute my humble ellorts toward the adop
tion of a charter fraught with such auspicious
results to the welfare of Ban Francisco.
Profitable Ranch Work.
M. Kahn has brought suit In the Justices'
Court to obtain $225 from Henry Bowman. It
is averred in the complaint that tue defendant
Bowman, while acting as an employe of the
plaintiff on a ranch in Solano County, aaed the
latter's outfit of horses, men and machinery to
perform work on other ranches. It is said that
the defendant received $100 for such work on
the Clay Settle ranch and further suma on
other ranches.

PEOPLE'S BANK
CASE CLOSES,
Conclusion of Arguments
in the Superior
Court.
JUDGE MAGEE TESTIFIES
Believes Sheehan's Services Were
Worth About $250 a
Month.
CAKPENTEE CLOSES CONFIDENT
Declares That Bartnett Has Produced
No Evidence to Support
His Case.
The evidence in the People's Home Sav
ings Bank case has been put in and the
matter submitted to Judge Seawell for
decision upon Judge Carpenter's motion
for dismissal. The taking of testimony
was completed before the noon adjourn
ment and the whole afternoon was taken
up with argument of counsel on Carpen
ter's motion. When the argument was
concluded Judge Seawell said he would
take the matter under advisement during
vacation.
At tbe opening of the court Judge Sea
well exhibited, to counsel the following
anonymous note, which he had received
on a postal card since the previous session
of the court:
Stockton, June 27, 1896.
To Bon. Seawetlâ Sir: It la to be sincerely
hoped you'll decide tbe People's Bank case,
without fear or favor, in accordance to the
evidence introduced. Is the law and ils otti
i:ers> (as the past has demonstrated it) im
potent, so corrupt and venal as to willfully
disregard the sacred rights of the unfortunate
depositors? Are the affairs and assets of the de
funct institution to be indefinitely conducted
by the "gang" now on trial? We hope not.
Pause and reflect; may God deal with you as
you'll soon deal with us depositors.
A Victim.
Judge H. W. Magee, one of the Bank
Commissioners, after a false start toward
the bailiff's desk, succeeded, with the as
sistance of clerk and counsel, in reaching
the witness stand. In answer to a hypo
thetical question put by Attorney Bartnett
in regard to the services rendered by Gen
eral Sheehan from July, 1894, to January,
1895. Judge Magee gave it as his opinion
that $250 a month would have been a rea
sonable compensation. In reply to a sim
ilar question as to Attorney Watt's ser
vices ihe witness declared that he would
be unable to state what they were reason
ably worth.
He admitted, however, that if Watt had
to lent extra office room, engage addi
tional employes and turn over some of his
practice to others, all tliis would warrant
a greater salary beint; paid him. Likewise,
tbe fact tbat General Sbeehan had to give
bonds of some $150,000 would tend to show
the vaiue of the general's services.
Attorney Bartnett placed in evidence
the report of the Bank Commissioners,
dated January 18, 1895, which concludes as
follows: "We are of the opinion that the
administration of the affairs of said bank
during saÂ»d term has been honest and ef
ficient, although we do not approve of the
allowance of $4000 to the receiirer."
Attorney J. A. Stephens, who occupies
an office in the Mills building witu Attor
ney Watt, testified that he had given $550
to Phelps with which to purchase the
Merrill claim. He denied that the money
had' been furnished by Sterman and de
nied knowing that similar claims could
have been bought in the market at one
quarter of their face value. He denied
having told Judge Sawyer at any time
tbat he (Stephens) controlled the board of
directors.
Stephens had no personal interest in
purchasing Merrill's claim, except that he
wished to thus get Merrill out of tho board,

because be was old and did not understand
much about business, and to have Phelps
elected. Stephens thought that if he
could get Phelps into tbe board, who was
friendly to him, he would be better able
to obtain any favors from tbe board.
General Sheehan was recalled to testify
in regard Jo the employment of A. F.
Johns by the bank. They had employed
him on only one occasion to investigate
some of the Arizona properties. Johns
had been at tbe bank a large number of
times, "for," declared General Sheehan,
"he is a man who Is everywhere, knows
everything and everybody, makes every
one else's business his own business, and
is engaged in all sorts of schemes." Gen
eral Sheehan denied having had knowl
edge of Johns' connection with tbe Kings
River Reclamation District matter until
within the past few weeks.
Dr. Jenningson was put oo the stand,
I at all the questions propounded by At
torney Bartnett were objected to by Judge
Carpenter, and the objections sustained,
so the doctor left the stand without hav
ing given a word of testimony. Then
Bank Commiasicuer Magee again took the
stand.
Attorney Bartnett here tlosed his case,
and Judge Carpenter moved for a dismissal
on the ground that the charges had not
been substantiated.
"There has been no evidence of wrong
doing on the part of General Sheehan or
the other defendants," declared Carpen
ter. "There have been charges of various
conspiracies, but there has been no ves
tlce of proof of such conspiracies. All
that has been proven is a dftlay of a month
or so on the part of the defendants, which
we claim is not criminal." At the conclu
sion of Judge Carpenter's protracted out
burst of forensic eloquence the court
adjourned until 2 o'clock.
Attorney Bartnett argued at length in
reply to Judge Carpenter at the opening of
the afternoon session. He dwelt witn par
ticular emphasis upon General Sheehan's
refusal to permit Grossmeyer to seethe
books of the bank, a refusal which he con
tended constituted a misdemeanor under
the following section of the Penal Code:
Sec. 13,565. Every officer or agent of any
corporation having or keeping an office within
this State who has in his custody or control
any book, paper or document of such corpora
tion, and who refuses to give to a stockholder
or member of such corporation lawfully de
manding, during office hours, to inspect or
take v copy of the tame, or of any part thereof,
a reasonable opportunity so to do, is guilty of
a misdemeanor.
After Attorney Bartnett had concluded
with a spirited appeal in behalf of the de
positors, Judge Carpenter replied briefly.
He denied that the court had jurisdiction
in the case of Sheehan, unless indicted by
the Grand Jury. He took up the various
statements of Attorney ijartnett and
scored him for his alleged misquotations
and misrepresentations.
At the conclusion of the argument Judge
Seawell said he would take tne matter of
dismissal under consideration.
CHARGED WITH MURDER
Blra. Balckwell Accused by a Coroner's
Jury of Causing Pretty Katie
Keenan') Death.
As the reeult of an inquest held by Cor
ner Hawkins yesterday morning on the
body of Miss Katie Keenan Mrs. D.
Balctwell stands charged with murder
and "Abe" Gorfinkle is accused of being
an accessory to the crime.
Miss Keenan died last week at 26 Har
riet street from the effects of a criminal
j operation. At the inquest yesterday Mrs.
McCarthy, the lirst witness, testified that
she had gone to the home of Mrs.
BalcKwell with the dead girl, and the lat
ter had told her that she had undergone
an operation. Mrs. Henry Lantz said that
Miss Keenan hart imparted similar infor
mation to her. Dr. Morgan testified as to
the medicine found in tne dead girl's
room. They were of the nature usually
employed in such cases.
Gorhnkle, who has been absent from the
City for several days â in fact, ever since
the crime was discoveredâ then took the
stand- He denied having been intimate
with the dead girl or that he had ever
given her money. Neither was he respon
sible for her going to Mrs. Balckwell.
After the inquest Gorn'nkle was arrested
and taken to the Central station. The ac
j cused man says that he left the City to
avoid any scandal that might result from
Miss Keenan's dentil.
Married in Sun Jose.
y Policeman August H. Wagner, the guardian
of the Police Courts and Treasurer's office, re
turned from his vacation yesterday and
brought with him a wife. The lady's maiden
name was Rose Jewett, and the marriage was
celebrated at her parent's residence in San
Jose on June 17, the officiating clergyman
being Rev. Dr. Burton. The honeymoon was
spent at Del Monte. Wagner was the recipient
oi many congratulations.
NEW CLUBHOUSE
IT SAUSALITO,
Will Be Built at Once by
the San Francisco
Yacht Club.
TO COST ABOUT $15,000.
Wide Verandahs Will Afford
Views of the Bay and
Regattas.
FINE SALT WATER BATHS.
Another Poolroom Has Opened at
Sausalito âClose of the San
Rafael Carnival.
A new clubhouse will soon be constructed
for the San Francisco Yacht Club, it will
be a thing of beauty on the water front at
Sausalito.
Flans and specifications have been in
course of preparation some time; they
will soon be completed. Then the work
of putting tbe architectural design into
actual material form will begin.
The new clubhouse will be both sub
stantial and tasty. It will afford an ex
cellent view of the bay and an ornament
of the water front that will be not only
a source of pleasure to the club members,
but an object of gratification to Sausalito.
The clubhouse will be three stories high
and verandahs will run all around it, from
which a magnificent view of tbe bay can
be had. The verandans will also be an
excellent point of vantage from which to
watch regattas and other yacht and boat
races.
The first story will be used for boats,
lockers, a sail loft and for a place of stor
age for general boating paraphernalia. It
will be fitted with all the latest modern
appliances and conveniences for housing
boats.
On the second floor the comforts and
some of the luxuries will begin. This floor
will be divided into a beautiful dining
room, a capacious and handsome assem
bly-room, and there will also be a library
and well-lighted reading-rooms.
In another division of this floor will be
tbe kitchen, pantries, linen closets, etc.
The third floor produces another at
tractive feature, particulary for the club
members. It will be divided into about
twenty rooms for the accommodation of
the members and their families.
A leading feature of the new clubhonse
will be hot and cold salt water baths. The
bathing quarters will be finished in lux
uriant style. As a matter of fact the new
clubhonse of the San Francisco Yacht
Club will be up to date in all respects, and
no necessary expense will be spared to
make it so.
Vice-President C. H. Morrell of the cluD
has supervision of the project. When,
complete it will be a fine ornament to the
lovely little city by the bay. The cost of
the new clubhouse will be $15,000.
Another commission-room was opened
in Sansalito yesterday morning by Harry
Corbett & Co. in the hall of the new build
ing of Bareno's on the water front. Sau
salito has two commission-rooms in fall
blast now. The two farms are working
under the regular license act, and it is
presumed the matter will again be venti
lated at tbe next regular monthly meeting
of the Town Board to be held the first
Monday in July.FIGHTING HARD

The Geary-Btrcet Railway franchise was
the toj ie of discussion by the Board of Sup
ervisors yesterday afternoon, and insinua
tions were thrown out. rieht and left.
Tie existing franchise of the company â 
vrill not expire for seven years, but as
i great changes have been projected, with a
. view of providing an electric system of a
permanent character, extending facilities
to meet the public requirements of a large
and rapidly developing region of the City,
the managers of the corporation asked
that the sale of the franchise for iifty
years be advertised.
This proposition encountered violent op
â¢ position, and quite a number of petitions
' have been filed in the office of the Board
of Supervisors against granting the com
party's request.
Supervisor Dimond has been leading the
opposition to the sale of the franchise,
holding that the privilege, which would
now go for $5000, won let be worth $50,000 |
when the present franchise expires.
Supervisor Spreckelsis in favor of giving j
, the company the right to bid for the fran- |
chise now, in view of the fact that it is the '
purpose of the directors of the corporation
to invest a large sum of money to build, j
equip and operate an electric railway
system.' He holds that men who are
willing to invest t'.ieir capital to promote j
the development of the City and provide
for the people the best of modern facilities
for rapid transit should be protected in
their investments.
Herman de Laguna has sent a commu
nication to the board, stating that the
corporate life of the applicant corporation I
ceases earlier than fifty years hence, j
Therefore, he holds that the corporation j
should file with its written acceptance of :
a new franchise a written abandonment
of the old. He contends that the Board
of Supervisors has no power to grant a :
vested interest in the street for a time 1
longer than the life of the grantee corpora- 'â 
tion, -i.
WheD the order granting the franchise
came up Supervisor Dimond moved its j
indefinite postponement.
Supervisor SprecKels moved that the ;
order be laid over one wees.
The motion to defer action one week
was lost.
The motion to postpone indefinitely was
lost by the fcik>WMtjj vote: -Nmsâ KinÃ,
Scully, Benjamin, Hughes, Dunker, Mor- :
gensterp, Sprecfcels, Wagnerâ B.
Ayes â Hirsch, Dimond, Taylor,
Hobbsâ 4.
Supervisor Hughes moved to advertise
for bids for the sale of the franchise.
Supervisor Dimond said: "I hope the
board will not do this in opposition to the
will of the people. What right have we
to dispose ol a franchise seven years be
foie it expires? Seven years hence this
franchise ought to be worth $50 ; 000." The
Supervisor mentioned the receipt of a
letter from the Geary-street Company
which he had received on coming into the
1_ . _ !_._ TT_ . _ J _ * I _ _
board yesterday. He presumed other
members had received a like letter. Ref- |
erence was made in the speech to one of !
the provisions of the letter relating to j
payment of 2 percent on gross earnings.
Supervisor Spreckela replied to Mr. ;
Dimond, saying: "The object of the com- |
pany in seeking to obtain the franchise is
to protect the investment of capital in the j
improvement of the road. A lar^e outlay j
for a permanent plant and the equipment
throughout of an electric railroad is con
templated. Capital will not invest in en
terprises of public improvement unless
there is some guarantee of protection.
The Supervisor from the Fifth misleads |
you in his statement as to what tbe com- |
municationfrom the applicant for the fran- !
chise contains. I now ask the clerk to
read the entire letter."
John A. Russell, clerk of the board, then j
read the communication addressed to Mr.
Spreckels. Each Supervisor received a
similar communication. Following is a
copy :
San Fkancisco, June 29, 1896.
Dear Sir: Some objections have been raised
by newspapers, improvement clubs and indi
viduals to the new franchise for which appli
cation has been made to the Board of Super
visors of the City and County of San Francisco '
by the Geary-street, Park and Ocean Railroad j
Company.
TUÂ« Street Committee of that board, after ;
careful consideration, have recommended that
toeeaSM be granted, but have inserted therein
a clause to the effect thut 2 per cent of the :
gross receipts of the line t-hail be paid into the
cny treasury by the grantee. This is a heavy;
tax upon the operations of the road, and, if !
travel thereon should increase according to
our expectations, will form a large and con- j
tinuous addition to the financial resources of
the City, and of itself be a full equivalent for j
the privileges granted.
To enable the company, however, to do a ;
business which will yield it a reasonable
profit, or even cover its expenses, after pay-;
ment of such ii percentage, it is manifest that
the road aud equipment must be of a character
that can successfully compete with the high j
class roads in the vicinity, in order that a fair 1
share oi travel can be induced thereon.
The present cable road, cam and equipment, |
are old and unsuited to modern requirements, j
and the public naturally patronize other lines
â where they can obtain superior accommoda- j
tions at the same rate. The directors of the j
Geary -street, Park and Ocean Kailroad Com
pany* hare, for some time past, seen the neces
sity for a reconstruction and a re-equipment of
the road so as to briug it up to the desired
standard, but the vaat expenditures which
would tiJerebf be entailed are noi regarded [
-udent in consideration of the
short time the present franchise has ,
yet to run. They have, therefore, applied to
your honorable board for a new franchise,
which. It finally granted to this company, will
run for a sufficient length of time to justify
Buoh an outlay. Should the company secure |
said franchise it is the Intention of Its direc- i
tors to convert the present road into a first
class electric roaa, with all the most approved
equipments and devices, so that it will receive
the lull share of travel to which its location
entitles it. If this is done both the City and
company will be benefited, the former by the
receipt of a large percentage on the gross
receipt* oi a great and prosperous roadand the
latter by the increased business which will :
assuredly follow its reconstruction.
Were it not ior the latter considerations the
onerous conditions presented by the Street
Committee could not be accepted, but with
such increase of business the company feels
that it will be able to shoulder the udditional
burden thus placed upon it.
It may further be suggested that this per
centage will be payable for geveral years be
fore the City could enforce such a requirement
in any franchise 10 be granted at the expira
tion of the term of the Present franchise of
said company, and thus all percentages prior
to 1003 will be clear gain to the City.
'1 he company feels assured tnat when the
merits of Us application arc deliberately con-
Bidered by you it will be apparent that no un
due privileges are being sought from the City,
nor can any detriment ensue to it from the
grant of the franchise applied for; on the con
trary, as I have shown, the interests of the
< ity, the public and the company will aliKe be
Bubservea and enlarged.
We therefore submit the matter to your dis- j
cretion with full confidence that you will act
in accordance with the true interests oi the
people and the municipality regardless of any
unfounded objections that may be made
through ignorance of the facts and circum- |
stances surrounding the application or that j
may emanate from the malice or prejudice of
the professed enemies of all the quasi-public I
institutions oi this City. Very respectfully
yours, J. L. Wii.lcttt,
Secretary and General Manager. â¢
Supervisor Dimnnd disclaimed any in
tention of misleading the board in quoting |
from the letter.
Supervisor Hughes maintained that the
City would get 2 percent of the gross earn
ings for the seven years which the fran
chise had yet to run. The idea of any
other company paying $50,000 for the
franchise was Ã¼bsurd and the talt was
buncombe.
Supervisor Dimond contended that capi
tal was barred out of investment by the
terms prescribed. He said there was a
strong probability tnat a new charter
would Be adopted before the existing j
franchise expired.
On the motion to grant the franchise
the vote stood: â¢
Ayesâ King, Scully, Benjamin, Dimond,
Hughes, Dunker, Morganstern, Spreckels,
Wagnerâ 9.
Isoesâ Hirsch, Taylor, Hobbsâ 3.
Supervisor Dimond gave notice that he j
would move for a reconsideration at the '
next regular meeting.
After the result was announced Mr. Di- 1
mond in quiet glee imparted to his friends
that his tactics in casting an affirmative'
vote and deferring rinal passage of the
order for one week had killed the scheme,
as the general law forbids the grant of a
franchise within ninety days before a gen
eral election or seventy days after. He
figured that postponement for one week
would bring tne final action within ninety
days of November 3, and thus render the
erant void.
Later in the session Mr. Dimond's joy
was turned to indignation, for Supervisor
King moved to adjourn until to-nigi<t.
Mr. Dimond made a simple motion to
adjourn, without designating any time.
The motion was put and lost.
Mr. Hughes was willing to adjourn until
2:30 this afternoon, as some of the mem
bers could not be present in the evening.
Supervisor Dimond, with a great deal of
warmth, inquired the reasons for another
session so soon. "Why violate the un
written rule of the board? What is com
ing up? Why are advocates of this early
meeting ashamed to say they pro
pose to consider?"
Supervisor Hobbs declared that there
was a nigger in the woodpile. He said:
"They don't dare to say what is coming
up, but I know what it is."
Supervisor Wagner remarked that there
was a great deal of unfinished business to
consider. He cited the nickel-in-the-slot
and the car-fender orders.
The Supervisors after further discussion
adjourned to meet at 9 o'clock this morn
ing.
Orders were given to notify John I.
Sabin of the telephone company and the
street railway companies of the morning
session to-day.
General Robert A. Friedrich on behalf
of the People's Mutual Telephone Com- !
pany presented a petition signed by 7000 j
citizens requesting that the order grant- '
ing a new telephone franchise be adver- ]
tised at once as required by law. The peti
tion sets f^rth that the company seeking
the franchise is prepared to give the
people cheaper aud better service than
they now have. The petition was re
ferred.
Edward Oliver, secretary of the St
George's Club of San Francisco, petitioned
for a permit to give an athletic tourna
ment, to include boxing contests for a lim
ited number of rounds, on July 27- The |
petition says: "Some of the leading mer
chants and business men of the City are
among our members, ana they will guar- i
antee that everything in conneciion with '
the contests will be conducted in a reapect- I
able manner." Referred to the License |
Committee.
The report of the Municipal Buildines i
Committee, as published in The Call, I
evoked some discussion. The report di
rects Architect Shea to change the plans
for tiie new municipal building so tnat
the driliroom will be in the basement and
the kitchen on the top floor.
A discussion aro-e as to whether the
right to make alterations had been re
served.
Supervisor Taylor (chairman) spoke of j
the necessity of having an entrance from
Merchant street leading to the main floor.
Mr. Benjamin was opposed tc any fur
ther delay or reference* to the Committee
of the Whole.
Mr. Spreckels understood that two plans j
were submitted by the architect. Only â 
one change, therefore, had been made â
that of placing the drillroom in the base
ment.
Mr. Taylor insisted that a Merchant-
Btreet entrance was important. The en- j
trance from that street now provided in j
the plans only led to the basement.
The report was adopted without an or
der for any change in the plans for the
Merchant-street entrance. Some of the
Supervisors did not seem to understand
what the chairman meant in saying that
the Merchant-street passageway led only
to the basement.
Supervisor Taylor Introduced this reso
lution, which was adopted:
Resolved, That the citizens are respectfully
requested to hoist our National emblem on
July 9, 1896, the same being the fiftieth anni
versary of the hoisting of the flag of the
United States in this City, and if practicable
our citizens are respectfully requested to close
their respective places of business on the alter
noon of said day in commemoration of this
event
Supervisor Taylor announced in a speech
supporting the resolution that Captain
Montgomery of the ship Portsmouth took
possession of San Francisco for the United
States fifty years ago.
The order to allow boxing, which passed
the board some time ago and was vetoed
by the Mayor, came up for passage over
the veto. The veto was sustained.
I An order was introduced by supervisor
Dimond and passed to print, providing
regulations to be observed by peddlers of
goods, merchandise and produce in the
public streets. The order is thus pre
ambled:
Wheeeas, Some of the persons obtaining
licences annoy and harass our citizens by per
sistently ringing the bells and knocking at the
doors of residences whereon notices are placed
that no peddlers arc desired; and whereas,
under the guise of peddlers thieves and burg
lars adopt the same tactics and by that means
ascertain the residences from which the occu
pants are temporarily absent, thus enabling
thorn to commit crimes.
Section 1 provides that it shall be unlawful
fora licensed peddler to ring the bells or
knock at the door of any residence whereon
the sign "No Peddlers" is displayed.
Other sections provide how licenses to
peddlers shall be issued. The Auditor is
to provide the License Collector with num
bered badges, and the latter, in addition
to the license, is to charge each peddler 25
cents for the badge. The peddler is not
allowed to lend or give this badge to any
other person. Any peddler who bangs the
door or rings the bell where the sign "No
Peddlers" is displayed may be deemed !
guilty of a misdemeanor and fined $100.-
The orJer which the Merchants' Associ
ation claim will allow the renewal of street |
work by private contracts : was passed, de
spite ttie protest of the engineer of the as
sociation.
That portion of the Street Committee's
report in favor of allowing traffic on
Golden Gate boulevard east of Van Ness
avenue was eliminated from the document
and laid over for one week. The senti
ment in favor of maintaining one boule
vard to the park is said to bo very active. I
The streets will be lighted next Wednes- !
day evening. ' J

GEORGE BARRON
IN COURT AGAIN,
Act Passed for the Fair
Contestants Relied
Upon.
TO ATTACK THE TRUST.
Edward Barron's Sanity and His
Wife's Influence to Be
Inquired Into.
THE LAW OF PERPETUITY.
Plaintiff's Attorneys Claim the Trust
Is Invalid According to Cali
fornia Law.
George E. Barron has made another
move to obtain what he considers his just
share of his father's millions. Tne action,
which was commenced in this City yester
day, is in the form of a suit to quiet title,
and in its determination will call for a
recital of the courtship and marriage of
the fair Irish widow and the prosperous
butcher, which occupied the attention of
the Superior Court of Santa Clara County
for several weeÃs.
The action which was brought then was
for the revocation of the will on tne
grounds that Edward Barron was of un- I
sound mind ana was under undue infiu- I
ence. After a most sensational trial,
which received large attention from Hie
press of the entire state and in which the
niost eminent counsel in the State were
engagea, a jury rendered a verdict for the
plaintiff.
The defendants, whose chief champions
were John Garber of this City and B. F.
Leib of San Jose, made a motion for a new
trial. Delmas & shortridge, who had con
ducted the case for tlie plaintiff, made a
vigorous opposition to the motion, but lhe
two Judges of the county sitting in bank
entertained some doubt as to tiie correct
ness of some of their previous rulings, aud
they allowed the motion. The case is now
pending in Santa Clara County, but with
no immediate prospect of trial.
At the time tde suit was brought in
Santa Clara County an action resisting the
probate of the will was the only one under
which the slighted son could hope for re
lief from its provisions. Since then the
Legislature has convened and Governor
Budd has approved an act making it pos
sible to attack in a collateral proceeding
tUe validity of a trust or bequest expressed
in a will. This is the act passed primarily
for the benetit of some of the Fair con
testants, and the approval of which lias
brought some criticism upon the Gov
ernor, not for any injustice in the act, but
from the fact that he was at the time en
gaged as counsel for Charles Fair.
The passage of this act has opened an
other door into court for George Barron.
By the provisions of the will $100,000 was
left to George Barron in trust. This trust
is not questioned by him, however. Bar
ron left to his son William $200,000, and
to charity $45,000. No Â«ffort will be made
by George to distribute this latter sum
either. In the Santa Clara County case he
offered to stipulate that lhe "charities
should receive their share irrespective of
the determination of the suit by Nicholas
Bowden, who represented nTostof the elee
mosynary beneficiaries and who refused to
accede to this on the ground that it would
not be binding as regarded the minor heirs.
Of the residue of the estate, amounting
to $1 60,0000 or $170,000, one-fourth was left
to the widow absolutely and the remain
der was given to her in trust for her minor
children. It is this latter provision that
George now attacks.
The action, according to George's attor
neys, Sullivan & Sullivan, will be based
WILLIAM P. .McNAIR. OFFICIAL STARTER.
upon two grounds. The first of these is
thai the will is invalid and hence the
trust must be. This contention will be
maintained upon the same grounds as was
the San Jose actionâ unsound mind and
undue influence. In the determination of
this issue the sensational testimony ad
duced at the San Jose trial will be gone
over with a few added details piomised.
One of the striking features of the former
trial was the cart played in it by the
colored woman who claimed her son was
heir to a child's share of Barron's mil
lions. This character was taken advantage
of by the plaintiff, who claimed that the
threats and persecutions of this woman
, constituted one of tue chief causes of bis
father's disturbed reason.
The second ground of attack is more
technical. It is directed at the trust itself
and is based upon a leading California
case, known as the Walkerley case. It de
pends for its force upon the strict tech
nical meaning of the words of the trust
clause, and briefly is tuat the trust is in
valid because its operation might possibly,
by its terms, extend over the" period of *
life or lives in being. It is a rule of law
tnat trusts cannot be created to extend in
definitely, in California the limit is "a
life or lives in being." By the terms of
the trust it is claimed its operation mieht
extend to such children of Eva Rose Bar
ron yet unborn at the time of the making
of the will. This, according to the Walk
erley case, constitutes a violation .of the
rule of perpetuity.
The property affected by the suit is
valued at something over $2,000,000, the
entire Barron real estato, though George
only lays claim to two-fifteenths. This
latter is what his share would be were the
trust not in existence and the California
laws of inheriiance allowed to operate,
it consists of a lot 107 feet west of Kearny
street, fronting 100 feet on Post, running
through 122 feet to Morton ; lot at south
west corner of Taylor and Geary streets,
137:6x137:6; the gore at Eddy and Market
streets, fronting 161:9 on Market and 137:3
on Eddy; lot on Eddy street, near Mason,
fronting 28:4 on MarKet and 23 on Eddy;
lot at northwest corner of Oak and Pierce
streets, 275x90:10; 50 vara lot at northeast
corner of Oak and Pierce streets; lot at
southeast corner of Fell and Pierce streets,
137:6x137:6; sonthwost corner of Fell and
Pierce streets, 137:6x137:6; northwest cor
ner of Fell ami Pierce streets, running
through to Have?, 275 feet on Pierce, 137:6
on Hayes and 137 :6 on Fell ; and the ranch
at Mayfield, comprising 350,000 acres.
The share George Barron claims will
amount to $260,000 or $270,000.
The actual parties at whose interests the
suit is aimed are Eva Rose Barron, the
widew, and her minor children, Edward
F., Marguerite M., Eva U., Mary 0.,
Marion, "Dorothy and William Barron.
The following charitable institutions, be
ing parties in interest, are made nominal
defendants: St. Vincent's Roman Catho
lic Orphan Asylum. Roman Catholic Or
phan Asylum of San Francisco, Arch
bishop Patrick W. Riordan, Sisters of
Holy Family, or Children's Day Home,
Our Lady's Home, or Catholic Old Ladies'
Home, Boys' and Girls' Aid Society, San
Francisco Protestant Orphan Asylum,
and James A. Thompson aud James E.
Walsh, trustees. There are twenty ficti
tious defendants.
Should the action pending in Santa
Clara County be decided in favor of the
present plaintiff the present suit would be
tnereby decided. Stiould Eva Rose be
successful it would not affect the present
litigation. __^^__^_^____ â
TROTTING AGAIN TO-DAY.
A Stake Event for Three-Year-
Oids the Feature of
the Card.
Ingieside Track in Better Condition.
W. Wood and Waldo J to
Meet oa Saturday.
The directors of the Pacific Coast Trot
ting-horse Breeders' Association held a
meeting yesterday at the office of Director
Burke, but business of a private nature
only was transacted.
This will be the second day of the as
sociation's summer meeting at Ingieside
track and two splendid events, tae 2:40
pace, with a fine field of starters, and a
stake for three-year-old trotters, are down
for decision. Secreta/y F. W. Kelley
stated yesterday that ail of the loose dirt
on the surface of the course has been
scraped off and better time can be looked
for to-day.
An attraction that is bound to draw a
great crowd has been arranged for the
Fourth of July, the closing day of the
meet. It is no less than a contest, best
three in five heats, between the crack free
for-allers of the pacing brigade, W. Wood
(2:07). and Waldo J (2:08), the gray ghost
from San Luis Obispo.
A special purse of $1000 will be hung up
for them. Two enthusiastic horsemen en
gaged in the butchering business in Aia
meda are also in doubt as to the relative
merits of their respective world-beaters,
and the public will have an opportunity
of 3eeing their caliber tested before the
meeting is over.
Starter vV. P. McNair proved a revela
tion to patrons of the running turf and
the work of the man from Wichita has
come in for much praise on all sides. Mr.
McNair considers the innovation of the
Pacific Coast Association in compelling
drivers to wear a jacket and cap of pro
nounced color a splendid one and thinks
it should be enforced on all tracks.
A $5 gold piece parleyed on the outsider
Prince Bismarck, who captured the pacing
event in straight heats on Saturday, would
have netted the speculator over $800.

PREPARING FOR
A MERRY FOURTH,
Lively Meeting of the
Executive Committee
Last Evening.
ROBERTSON THE VICTOR
Prize Poem Selected From a
Large Number That Were
Submitted.
MID FLEECY WHITE CLOUDS.
Handsome Float Which Will Bear
the Beautiful Goddess of
Liberty.
The executive branch of the Fourth of
July committee had a lively meeting last
evening. The question of how to make
the finances meet the appropriations was
MISS JENNIE L. HEDBERG, THE GOOD SS OF LIBERTY.
the main puzzle before the committee.
The report of the finance committee was
very encouraging. It showed that there
was already subscribed $3569 63. This,
with what the committee feels assured it
will receive in the next few days, will be
sufficient to carry out all its plans.
E. A. Bergerot reported for the literary
committee that it bad finished its labors
and awarded the prize of $50 for a poem to
Louis A. Robertson. Mr. Robertson is a
newspaper man at present on the staff of
the News Letter. His production was
chosen from 139 submitted.
Mr. Bergerot stated that the committee
had decided that there should be no re
served eeats at the Pavilion. Every one
presenting an invitation will be admitted
without charge. The invitations will be
at the disposal of the general committee.
Rabbi Voorsanger has been requested to
act as chaplain.
"If he declines," said Mr. Bergerot, "we
will have no chaplain."
Henry P. Umbsen, grand marshal, re
ported that he would need twenty more
carriages. After some discussion his re
quest was referred to the chairman of the
hack committee, the chairman of the
finance committee and the grand marshal.
The matter of having reserved seats for
those who bad contributed to the celebra
tion was again called up. It was stated
that some of the contributors had been
promised this favor, and it was decided
that the action of the literary committee
be reconsidered and a limited number of
seats be reserved.
The transportation committee reported
that it had made arrangements with the
railroad companies for half-rates from all
points in the interior, to be in effect from
July 2 to July 7.
Robert Ash of the fireworks committee
reported that they h:id decided to have
the display on the block between Haight
and Waller, Ashbury and Cole. This is
immediately east of toe Chutes. The
Supervisors yesterday pansed an order
permitting them to discharge fire
works in this locality. The contract
for fireworks had been divided between
the California and the San Francisco Fire
works Companies. John Soufre. as a rep
resentative of the California Fireworks
Company objected to the manner in which
the contracts had been awarded. He
claimed that his company's bid was the
lowest and it should have received the
contract. Mr. Ash explained the basis
upon which the award was made and a
heated discussion ensued. Ac its con
clusion the entire contract was given to
tue California Fireworks Company.
President S. L. Lent stated that the
grand marshal had some doubt as to the
extent of his authority in the matter of
forming the parade. He moved that the
grand maisbal and his assistants be given
absolute authority. His motion was car
ried.
On motion of 1. J. Truman it was de
cided to insert in all contracts a clause
exempting the members of the committee
fro,m individual liability. Several chair
men of sub-committees stated that they
had inserted such a clause in all contracts.
Miss Jennie L. Hedberg of 2216 Filbert
street, who has been selected as the God
dess of Liberty, is a California girl and a
graduate of the Commercial High School.
Miss Hedberg owes her selection to her
peculiar beauty, which is contributed to
largely by a charming complexion. The
float which Miss Hedberg will grace i* to
represent a bank oi fleecy clouds, on whose
summit the goddess will ride triumph
antly. Four white horses will draw this
chariot.
CLOSED TILL THE FOURTH.
But the Alcazar Manager Paid Shiwkey
in Full.
A crowd gathered about the doors of
Grover's Alcazar Theater last evening. In
the assemblage were several actors, who
were endeavoring to learn the cause of
the doors being closed and locked with a
chain.
On inquiry it developed that the theater
had closed its doors the night before after
the play was over and the actors had dis
persed for the evening. The cause was
given as a lack of funds wherewith to meet
current expenses.
Superintendent Wallenrod, who has the
rental of the Alcazar building, said that
Manager Grover had come to him the
evening belore and told him the theater
had closed up and that he would come to
him to-day and square the financial part
of the affair.
Manager Grover said he had closed up
nt the beginning of the week many times
before.
"Business has been dull for some time,"
lie said, "and as I thought running any
longer a losine proposition, I decided to
close the doors.
"To-morrow afternoon is payday and
everybody's account will be settled in full.
As soon as times get better I shall reopen.
I think this will be July 4.
"July 5 I expect to put Sharkey and
Choynski on the programme. lam not
certain of this at present, but think it can
be arranged. Sharkey'a account has ai
rearty been settled.
"Some people, perhaps, are surprised
that I should close up just when wÂ» have
had such large audiences. Well, Sharkey
dia not. prove quite so great a drawing
card as we expected, but what we made at
the end of last week would have been iost
at the> beginning of this week. So we have
closed for a brief interval. That Is all
there is to the matter."
Sharkey was also seen last evening, and
corroborated Grovcr's statement as to his
own account bavin* been settled in full.
RIGHTS OF SEAL-HUNTERS
Schooners Seized in 1891 Ordered
Released by the Court of
Appeals.
Seals May Be Caught at Certain
Seasons if Found Beyond the
Three-Mile Limit.
Judges McKenna, Gilbert and Hawley,
United States Court of Appeals, handed
down an important decision yesterday in
the case of the schooner La Ninfa, seized
in Alaskan waters in 1891.
"This is an appeal in admiralty from a
decree of the District Court of Alaska,"
said Judge Hawley in delivering the opin
ion of the court, "forfeiting the schooner
La Niiii'a upon the grounds that she had
been unlawfully engaged in killing seals
in the waters of Alasfcan territory.
"It appears that on April 1, 1891, she
sailed from San Francisco, having been
previously fitted out here. On July 6 she
passed into Bering sea, and three days
later sent out her boats, bringing in four
teen skins. On the following day the
United States ship Thetis notified the cap
tain of the schooner that 'the sea was
closed from sealing.' Ensign Dodd of the
Thetis boarded the sealer thirty miles
off St. Paul's Island and warned him to
cease operations. Captain Worth of the
schooner inlormed the ensign that he wan
fitted out for whaling and asked permis
sion to continue on that line. He was told
that if he remained it would be at his own
risk of being seized. The schooner, how
ever, remained in the waters and on July
14 was seized by toe revenue cutter Cor
win and taken to Sitka for condemnation.
She had on board nineteen skins, of which
number Captain Worth said five had been
killed in the sea.
"From these facts the question arises,"
said the court, "whether Bering Sea at a
distance of more than one league from the
American is Alaskan territory, or in
the waters thereof, or within the domin
ion of the United States in the waters of
Bering Sea."
The court then went into a lengthy re
view of the modus Vivendi which finally
resulted in the Board of Arbitration, in
session at Paris, agreeing that "the two
countries had rights in common tc kill
seals outside the three-miie limit." Con
gress, to give effect to this decision, passed
a new sealint: act April 4. 18it4, covering
the points agreed on by the arbitrators.
As it was shown that the seals were taken
ten miles from shore the decision of the
District Court was reversed and the
schooner ordered released.
A reversal in the case of the schooner
Alexander, seized at the same time, was
also ordered.
C. W. Smith's Kgtate.
Mary A. Smith has applied for letters of ad
ministration on tbeestate of Charles W. Smith,
wno left property valued at about $10,000.

THE STOCK MARKET.
The week opened lower again, the best prices

tuations were in Potosl, which sold at 90c@$l 10,

Chief Justice W. J. Beatty of the Supreme
Court yesterday made an order in the Durrant
murder case that pending an examination of
the record all proceedings therein are hereby
stayed thirty days from date. Had it not been
for* this stay of proceedings Durrant would
have been removed from the County Jail to
San Quentin.

NEW TO-DAY:
That's the way people write after wear-
ins: Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt for rneuma-
tism and pains in the back. â¢ This is what
Mr. Williams says after wearing Dr. San-
den's Electric Belt for two months:
HOOPA VALLEY, Cal., ),
June 25. 1896. f
DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: I pot your
| Belt on the 18th of April and charged it and
j put it on, and after the first twelve hours that
i I wore it 1 began to improve. I was so bad that
j I could not get out of bed without rolling over
on my stomach, as the pains in my sides and
! back were so bad. Now I can jump out of bed
like a young man. I cannot nnd words great
enough to express my gratitude for the good
your Belt has done me. I 'shall always recom-
mend your Belt to my friends, and if any one
wishes information they can write to me and
I will gladly answer, them. I nope this will
reach other sufferers, and I thank you again
from the depths of my heart. Your* grate-
fully, THOS. J. WILLIAMS, j j
H>opa Valley, Humboldt County, Gal.-
Now, when you consider the fact that
we are publishing letters like this every
dayâ statements of cures all over the State
in all walks of life â it means something.
It means that Dr. Sar.den's Electric Belt
cures rheumatism, lame back and weak-
ness. When you have tired of drugs, of
plasters and of liniments let us call your
attention to something more potent than
plasters, more penetrating than liniments.
It is
Dr. sanden's
Electric Belt.
As Good for Women as for Men.
It relieves the pain in an hour and the
gradual absorption of the currentintoyour
system will drive out all trace of the dis-
I ease. The "how 1 and "wny" of the sue- !
cess of this method of treatment would
require more space than we can spare.
We merely state the facts. In the way of
proof we can refer you to thousands who
have been cured by this method. The
little book
"THREE CLASSES OF MEN "
Will explain more fully. It is sent by
mail FREE, upon application.
If you are confounding this with some
cheap fraud that you have heard of call
and see your error.

A CONVENTION IN THIS CITY.
Frank McGowan of Humboldt and
Judge Spencer of Lassen Entered
the Race Too Late.
The Republicans of the First Congres
sional District will to-day renominate
Congres-man J. A. Barham of sianta Rosa
at the convention, which will meet at 10
Congressman J. A. Barham, Who Expects to Be Rcnomlnated To- Day ia the
FfTst District.
a. m. in the rooms of the Union League
Cub.
The convention *rill be held outside of
the district on Recount of the convenience
of meeting in San Francisco. The only
business before the convention is tue
nomination of a Congressman, and this
business wiil be soon finished.
The convention which meets to-day is a
new one, the dplegates to which have been
appointed by county committees within
two weeks, or since tue First District Con
vention, which met in Sacramento at the
tune of the State Convention, early in
M*y. Some of the other Congressional
conventions adjourned to a later date to
nuikf nominations for Congress, but in
t lie First District delegates to the second
convention were newly appointed.
Many of the delegates arrived in the
City last evening, notably those from
Mendocino. Sonoma and Napa counties.
Congressman Barham came down from
S<u;ta Rosa on the train with Senator
Rsgsttale, G. B. baer of the Cl verdale
Reveille and a majority of the Sonoma and
Mendocino delegations. Frank L. Coombs ]
is here among others of the Napa delega
tion. A number of the Humboicit delega
tion are expected to arrive this irornin?.
It appeared certain last evening that |
Barham' would cet the nomination with i
practical unanimity. There will be 96
votes in the canvention and his friends
sÂ«y that more than a majority are in
structed for him, while most of the other
delegate* are solid for him.
The Congressional convention which
met in Sacramento unanimously indorsed
Harham, and when it adjourned there was
no other candidate in the field. Within a
weeK, however, Judare E. V. Spencer of
Lassen and J. T. Matlock of Tehama an
nounced themselves in the race. Then
the popular Senator, Frank McGowan of
HuniboMt, went into the fight aud his pros
pects seemed especially strong.
Matlock withdrew on the 13th inst. in
favor of Barham ut a meeting oi the Te
hama County Committee, which then in
structed its live delegates for Barham.
Judge Spencer has been in the City for
three or four days, but has likewise with
drawn as Barham's majority developed,
and his name will probably not be pre
vented to-uay.
McOowan has the solid delegation from
Huinboldt County with him and an un
certain number of supporters scattered
among the other delegations. It was
doubtful last night whether or not Mc-
Gowan would allow his name to go before
the convention.
Barham has three things especially in
his favorâ his record in Congress, the fact
that he ran twice to be elected once and
the consequent feeling that he is entitled
to another term, and then the fact
that he and his friends were earliest in tlie
field.
This was the way 6enator Ragsdale of
Santa Rosa stated the convention pros
pects last night.
"Seven counties have instructed for
Barham, and they are: Tehama, with five
votes; Marin, six votes; Mendocino. nine
Totes; Sonoma, nineteen votes; Plumas,
four votes; Del NortÂ«, two votes, and
Shasta, five votes. That makes fifty votes
out of ninety-six. Naoa has endorsed his
his course, and we understand that ten of
its eleven votes are for Barham. We
count on Siskiyou and Sierra solid with
eight and six votes respectively, and ex
pect part or all of the votes from Trinity,
Modoc and Lassen. You see, Barham has
it won, hands down.
"Barham has made a fine record in Con
gress and will be an exceptionally strong
candidate, but aÃide from all that there is
a feeling that he is entitled to another
term. Six years ago we begged people to
take the nomination, and Frank McGowan
was one of them. Finally, when the cam
paign was half over, Barham went into
a losing fight and lost. Frank McGowan
has many friends among Barham's sup
porters who might vote for him if it were
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
not for this feeling that Barham deserves
the nomination anyway."
The delegations from Lassen, Modoc,
Sierra and some other remote counties
will be represented largely or wholly by
proxies.

Austrian- American McKinley iteg.
At an executive meeting of the Austrian-
American McKinley Club last evening it was
resolved to have a uniformed corps in con
junction with the club, clothed in the Austrian
colors, 200 strong. It is confidently expected
that their appearance on parade will justify
them as proper and manly exponents of Mc-
Kiuley ana protection. The meetings of
tne organization will be held hereafter on
Tuesdays instead of Fridays. The club will at
a very early date eive a grand rally and mass
meeting at the Turk-street Temple, at which
shining lights of the party aDd a few leading
Austrian-American citizens will expound the
doctrines of Lincoln, Blame and McKinley.
The executive committee consists of James J.
Feely, Antone Gagre, H. A. Williams, J. H.
Breen, w. E. Pect and P. Moreno.
IN FAVOR OF THE BANK.
Circuit Court of Appeals Renders
a Decision Favoring a Local
Institution.
Banker Cowan's Transfer of Certain
Prp rty to His Wife Is Held
to Be Illegal.
The Circuit Court of Appeals, in a de
cision read by Judge Hawley yesterday,
reversed the Circuit Court of Oregon in the
suit of the Bank of California against J. L.
and S. E. Cowan to set aside the transfer
of certain property.
Cowan, who was a prominent banker of
Salem, failed June 19, 1893. On the same
day he transferred to his wife certain
property in Albany, Or. The Bank of Cal
ifornia, to whom Cowan was indebted, se
cured an attachment on the property, al
leginÂ» that the transfer was fraudulent.
It appears, according to the complaint of
the bank, that subsequent to this convey
ance, on June 27, Cowan transferred the re
mainder of his properiy to certain trustees
for the payment of claims of certain cred
itors, it was alleged in the bill thatatthe
time of the transfer to his wife Cowan waiÂ«
insolvent, and that the deed was made
witn the intention of defrauding the bank
and other creditors.
The lower court found "that the con
veyance of said lÃncl, together witli the
transfers shortly thereafter made by the
insolvent to trustees for certain preferred
creditors, were tantamount to a general
assignment of the insolvent's property,
and ihat since such assignment was not
made for the benefit of ail creditors, the
same was void under the statutes of Ore
gon. Within thirty days of the date of
said decree the complainant must file with
the clerk of the court its written assent
waiving its preferred lien by the attach
ment, and judgment and all right of ap
peal from the decree and accept its share
of the estate pro rata, as if a general
assignment had been made for all cred
itors. The complainants having failed to
file said assent their Dill is dismissed."
It appeared that at one time Cowan
owed his wiie $.'SOOO, giving his note for
that amount. In 1890 he paid $3333 33 on
account, but failed to take a receipt. At
the time of the transfer of the real estate
the note iv question was barred oy the
statute of limitations, the lower court,
however, acknowledging the justness of
the deot by aÂ»suming that the transfer
was voluntary.
The Court of Appeals in reviewing the
evidence held that if there had ever been
any real indebtedness between Cowan and
his wife it did not exist at the time of the
transfer; hence the attachment of the
Bank of California on the Albany prop
cr'y was within their rights &i a creditor.
The court's decision was therefore re
versed at appellee's cost, and a decree for
complainant for relief prayed for in bill
was ordered.

Case Against Mitchell IMninUaed.
The case of Michael Mitchell, employed at
one time in the newspaper department of the
Postoflice, wuo was arrested nn a charge of ap
propriating $804, was dismissed in the United
States District Court yesterday. Mitchell's
bondsmen made good the shortage. Dintnct
Attorney Foote had the case stricken from the
calendar because the evidence was of such *
complicated character as to make a conviction
doubtful.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 1896.
ARE FOR PROTECTION,
The McKinley and Hobart Italian
Republican Club Organ
ized.
All Members of the New Society
Pledge Themselves to the Suc
cess of the Ticket.
The McKinley and Hobart Italian Re
publican Club was organized last evening
at Garibaldi Hall, on Broadway, nezÂ»r
Kearny street, with the following officers:
President, P. Barbieri; first vice-preÃident,
E. Vanaglia; second vice-president, F. Marini;
treasurer, L. Torre; secretary, B. Ratte; ser
geant-at-arins, G. Sbarboro.
Executive committeeâ P. Barbieri, E. Vena
glia, F. Marini, L. Torre, U. Sbarboro, X. Ker
roggiaro, A. L. Baeigalupi, J. F. Uartinonl,
Giov. Figoni, Gius Figoni, S. Bottaro, E. Selna,
G. Roccalagliata, A. Seralini, A. Arnaboldi.
The following resolutions were offered by
Frank Marini and unanimously adopted:
The Italian Republicans of San Francisco as
sembled under the auspices of the McKinley-
Hobart Italian Republican Club of San Fran
cisco, proud oi the splendid past of the Repub
lican party, the great party of freedom and of
equal rights, and rejoicing in the anticipation
of Its further glory under the leadership of the
famous apostle of protection, William McKin
ley of Ohio, unanimously approve the action
of the National Convention at St. Louis, and
pledge to its nominees, McKinley and Hobart,
the united support of the Italian Republicans
of San Francisco. And
Whereas, The National platform adopted by
said convention has given to the party as
beacon lights and for watchwords during the
campaign the great doctrines of protection
and reciprocity, which are synonymous with
prosperity and plenty; and whereas, the tri
umphant success of" these principles means
that the wheels of commerce will once again
revolve with their former speed, the forges and
furnaces again blaze witn light, American
manufactures and American industries be
again firmly established, the standard of
wÂ»ges raised and work become more plentiful,
Resolved, That this club, both as an organiza
tion and the members in their individual
capacity, indorse the platform of the National
Republican Conv*>ntion, and will do all in
their power to achieve the success of the prin
ciples therein announced.
Further resolved, That the thanks of this
club be extended to the members of the Cali
fornia delegation to the National Convention
for their active zeal and co-operation in secur
ing the nomination of the standard-bearers of
our party.
Whereas, To be effective in its work the Re
publican party must procure the registration
of all its voters; and whereas, registration of
voters, while already in progress, closes at the
new City Hall on August Â«, 1896, only about
one month from this date; and whereas, it is
extremely doubtful whether any precinct
registration will be had this year,
Resolved, That every memoer of this club
shall forthwith himself register, and at the
same, time shall act as a missionary among
other Republicans to secure their immediate
registration.
stirring speeches were made by Presi
dent Barbieri, Treasurer Torre and A.
Serafini and Gr. Cevasco of the Voco del
Popolo calling upon all Italian citizens to
Work for the success of the Republican
party. A committee was appointed to as
sist in the naturalization of Italians in
tin's City. Over 250 members signed the
roll. Tha club aujourned to meet at the
cull of the chair.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 29.â During the
greater part of the day, the stork market, 10 put it
mildly, bordered on demoralization. The Inter
views with the leading F.astern Democratic leaders
were mainly responsible for this condition of
affairs, these politicians having practically ad
mitted In interviews' urlnted yesterday that the
free silver men will not only dictate the platform
of the party, but name the candidates. These
statements alarmed timid holders of securities,
and encouraged the bears to make demonstrations
against the list. Professional operators. â¢> usual,
were the first to discern the uneasiness and ham
mered the list. Long stock came out freely and the
tact was developed that the market was honey
combed with stop loss orders. .
' The May statements of vhe St. Paul and Chicago,
Burlington and Quincy proved to be very unfavor
able, the St. Paul showing a net decrease of 9361.
-130 and the i'.urllngton a deficit of $250,900. Fur
thermore, over 91,000,000 was withdrawn from
the sub-treasury for shipment to Europe, The
poor showing of the granger roads and the unex
pected engaseuaents of go!<* played directly into
the hands of the bear leaders, and this, with the
prominence given the silver question, made it
comparatively- easy work to depress values. The
decline in prices ranged from yÂ» to 414 per cent,
the industrials and grangers scoring the heaviest
lojses. The decline brought in London orders,
and usually ' well-Informed firms with European
connections placed the buying for foreign account
at 40,000 shires. ." ,
The purchases stemmed the downward move
ment for a time and Major McKinley's speech to
the notification committee in which he heartily in
dorsed the platform of the St. Louis convention
also acted as a tonic but In the late afternoon trad-
Ing the market developed renewed weakness and
closed nervous. . Net changes show losses of i/i'a 4

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, tXMm June 29.-The work of liqui
dation continued in wheat to-day, and the result
was decidedly detrimental to values. Had there
been anything on which the bulls could have hung
their hones probably the inclination to dispose of
the;r property would not have been so great, but
there seemed to be nothing containing the least
encouragement. Before the opening curb trading
was at fractional reductions from Saturday's close,
due to receipts in the Northwest, which were
heavy. 611 cars arriving, asalnst 586 last Monday
and 264 a year aco. Chicago received 14 cars and
inspected out 16,582 bushels.

lushels in the visible supply did not tend to im
prore matters. Liverpool cables were quiet and
unchanged. Closing Continental cables were all
lower. The Knglish visible <tipplv increased 460
-000 busiiels and Liverpool stocks were 26Â£.0D0
bushels larger than on last Monday. The world's

wheat, although as a matter of fact there was no
essential eeason for anything better in the direct
situation. Receipts were heavy at 489 cars, and
342. 86U bushels were withdrawn from store.
Liverpool cabies were quiet. The visible sopply

The Druggist's Dilemma
An East Side druggist was startled the
other day when a boy came into his store
and handed him a crumpled note, the
handwriting of which he easily recognized
as that of the wife of one of his best cus
tomers, who lived a few blocks up the
street ana owed him a bill. The note read
as follows:
Dear Sir: Please send me by the bearer five
ounces of rat poison. My husband has just re
turned from Washington.
The druggist was undecided as to what
to do. He had about made up his mind
to call a policeman, wnen the boy, fum
bling in bis poctcets, pulled out another
bit of crumpled paper and said:
"Say, mister, here's the rest of that note.
I got in a scrap wid a feller cornin' down to
the store and he tore it in two." It read :
He is too tired to come down to-night, but
will stop in to-morrow and pay you ior this
and settle the other bill. Mbs. Smith.
The ciruggist looked relieved, and after
weighing out the poison went into his
laboratory and took a drink of nerve
tonicâ New York Evening Sun.

BLUED BY BEES,
Novel Complaint Made by
an Engineer at
Berkeley.
APIARY IN AN ATTIC.
The Owuer Said to Be Liable
for the Depredations of
Marauding Bees.
REASONING OF NO AVAIL.
So Official Notice Is Served to Abate
the Nuisance at
Once.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 29. j
The District Attorney will be asked to
issue a complaint for a very unusual alle
gation to-morrow. It is the second case of
the same nature that has arisen within a
month.
Little busy bees are small things to cause
litigation, but they ha7e stings, and it is
on account of this attribute that E. J.
Lough of Berkeley may have to answ3r a
complaint of causing cruelty to children.
R. McMillan, the engineer of the steamer
Piedmont, lives off Stewart street, near
Shattuck avenue. He has a wif* and lour
children and owns a beautiful home. Un
til three months ago everything was peace
able and happy at the McMillan home.
At that time their neighbor, Â£. J. Lough,
decided that he would run an apiary. He
bought several hundred bees and installed
them in the attic of his house. No objec
tion was raised until the stinging insects,
in their hunt for honey, invaded the pretty
garden of the McMillans. So long as the
bees confined themselves to the raspberry
boshes there was no trouble, but when the
bees began a crusade against the faces and
hands of the little McMillans there was
trouble.
On several occasions the children were
stung so severely that their faces swelled
and their eyes were closed entirely. The
children were doctored and some heavy
bills were paid, but Mr. McMillan could
think of no remedy. Recently the chil
dren have suffered so much chat the doc
tor has stated that there is danger of ,
erysipelas attacking the children. As a i
last resort the affair was reported to Mrs.
Prescott, secretary of the Children's Soci
ety, and she was asked to protect the little
ones from their sufferings.
Mrs. Prescott inspected the children and
found the three-year-old boy suffering in
tense pain. The secretary thought that a
call at the Lough residence would quickly
settle matters, but was disappointed.
Mrs. Lough said she could not help mat- j
ters and told Mrs. Prescott that this is a j
free country and that she does not propose
to be dictated to by neighbors. She further
said that she was not responsible 1 for her
bees after they left her premises.
Seeing that reasoning would not avail, j
Mrs. Prescott gave official notice that un
less the nuisance were abated within forty
eight hours she would apply for a war
rant. The section of the act that the !
secretary says applies to tbe case is the j
following:
Sec. 4. Whosoever shall willfully cause or
permit any child to suffer, or who shall Inflict
thereon unjustifiable physical pain or mental
suffering, and whosoever, having the care or
custody of any child, shall willfully cause or
permit the lite or limb of such child to be en
dangered, or the health of such child to be in- I
jured, or any person who shall willfully cause |
or permit such child to be placed in such a
situation that its life or limb may be en
dangered, or its nealth shall be likely to be
injured, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The question is of some importance
and the liability of bee-keepers has never |
yet been determined. At San Leandro I
recently complaints were made to tbe I
Trustees that bees were devastating berry {
fields, and they are now considering the i
best means to abate tbe nuisance.
WANT THE CONVENTION,
Conference of National Educa
tion May Come West
in 1897.
Professor Brown of Berkeley Will
Make an Effort to Bring It
to San Francisco.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jnne 29. â Pro- J
fessor Elmer E. B. Erown, head of the
department of pedagogy at the State j
University, will leave for Buffalo,
N. V., to-morrow morning to rep
resent the University of California at the
National Educational Convention to be
held there early in July.
Professor Brown will make a special ,
effort to induce the convention to come to !
California in 1597 and in an Interview to- j
day he expressed much hopes of being
able to do so providing the National Con
vention of the Christian Endeavor Society ,
did not come to California at tbe same
time.
"It will be a great thing for the State,"
said Professor Brown to-day, "if we can
pet the Educational Convention in 1897,
but a still greater good will be accom
plished if we can bnn; sufficient pressure
to bear on the Legislature to carry through }
the biils now pending to increase tbe State
University land grants.
"If the bill is passed by Congress we will
get something like 320,000 acres of land
For the State University, in addition to the
46,000 which we now have under the land
grant law. We purpose at this convention
talking over the best course to pursue in
bringing tbe Legislature to see he matter
as we do.
"I will be away for about three weeks,
and stop off for a few days at Chicago
and at Detroit.'
Professor Brown will read two papers
before the convention, one on "Child
Study" in the Tornpkins School, and on*
before the Herbart Club on "Tbe Theory of
Creative Epochs."
Professor Merrill will accompany Profes
sor Brown part way. Professor Merrill goes
to the meeting of the National Philolog
ical Society at Brown University.
Athletes Will Entertain.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 29â The first
dramatic entertainment of the Crescent
Athletic Club will be given to-morrow
night in the clubrooms. The athletes who
ore to take part in the performance have
been rehearsing for some weeks and are
said to be ready to give an excellent pre
sentation of "The Two Advertisements."
The cast of characters will be as follows:
Samuel Jordan, a vain "young" old widower,
Dr. J. C. Anthony; George Jordan, his son, a
romantic lover with a consuming passion,
Walter A. Gompertz; Marcus Brass, an eccen
tric theatrical agent with wonderful assur

The play will be followed by a danco, C.

Will Not Take the Stump.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 29.â The pub
lished report that Mrs. Abigail Bush, the
pioneer woman suffragist, is about to
stump the State in behalf of the equality
movement is denied by Berkeley relatives
of the lady. Mrs. Bush is at present in
Vacaville. While in Berkeley she de
clined to take any part in the campaign on
being requested to do so by Mrs. Haight,
president of the Citizen Suffrage League of
Berkeley.
Republicans to Meet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jnne 29.â The Mc-
Kinley League, as the latest organized Re
publican club of Berkeley is called, will
hold a meeting to-morrow night in Odd
Fellows' Hall. The committee on by-laws
and permanent organization will present
its report.
HOME PRODUCTS.
The Exposition Heartily Indorsed by
Merchants Who Believe It Will
Revive Business.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 2t>.â The Board
of Trade directors have sent out a circular
to all members regarding the Oakland Ex
position, in which they say:
The citizens of Alameda County are enthusi
astically arranging to hold at the Exposition
buiMing. during the month of August, a home
industry exhibition oi the products end manu
factures of the county of AJameJa. The first
effort in this direction during the month of
December last year, Inspired by the activity of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
of California, met with such unqualified suc
cess that the management feels justified in en
larging the scope of the next exhibition so as
to occupy the entire block bounded by
Eleventh, Twelfth, Webster and Harrison
streets.
It has also been the means of bringing about I
a strictly home industry fair in .~an Francisco j
under the joint auspices of the Mechanics' In
stitute and Manufacturers' Association.
While last year's display of the manufact
ures and products of the county surprised and
gratified all the people, it is the intention to
leave nothing undone to magnify it to such an
extent that justice will be done to tne great
importance of these industries and their rela
tion to the prosperity of the entire State.
The growth of manufacturing has been of [
late years much greater than the people are |
generally aware of. As to viticultura:. horti
cultural and agricultural products, we believe
there is no county in the State that can equal
Alameda in quality and variety. With these
inspiring conditions before us.it is intended
to bring all our resources to the attention of
the people not only of this but adjoining coun
ties as well. It is therefore hoped you will
lend yonr valuable aid by making a creditable
display.
We would earnestly urge all members of the
Board of Trade to interest themselves in this
matter, especially tnose who are engaged in
manufactures or the production of any Articles
Of commerce to make an exhibit of the same.
This Is incumbent upon all members, in order
that we may do our part in the good work of
building up and making known the various
manufactures and industries of this county,
and thereby promote a revival of the business
prosperity of the community.
LOST HIS REASON.
Simon Brauler Goes Mad While Con-
fined In Jail for a Petty
Offense.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jnne 29.â Simon
Brauler, a young German confined at the
City Jail, went mad this morning and will
have to be committed to an asylum for
treatment. He was arrested early in
June for breaking a plate-glass at a sa
loon because he was driven from a free
lunch counter. He said then that he
coulu not secure worK or food.
He proved himself a model prisoner up
to hist Saturday, when, while assisting

Sacrificed All Worldly Interests
for the Sake of the
Church.
PRIEST TO THE PORTUGUESE.
Thousands of Loving Parishioners
Wept Around the Bier in His
Late Church.
Oakland Offick San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 29. (
St. Joseph's Church on Chestnut street
was crowded this morning with sorrowful
spectators. They had gathered to pay
their final tribute of respect and affection
to the remains and memory of the Jate
Rev. Father Fernandez.
As the venerable Father King officiated
at the solemn requiem high mass people
were sobbing in all part 3 of the church.
The assistants at the mass were Rev.
Fathers Pimental and Governo. Arch
bishop Riordan was present and pro
nounced the final blessing. The casket
was a rich one of black cloth relieveo. with
silver plates and it was covered with floral
offerings from the many members of the
church who had been suddenly bereft of
their beloved pastor.
Rev. Father Gloria preached the obitu
ary sermon in the Portuguese language.
The speaker referred to the sacrifice made
by the late priest, when riches were
his, and how he had given all to charity
and his life to labor for humanity. Father
Fernandez was born in Portugal, forty-six
years ago, and at the age of 14 went to
Brazil. After remaining there for six
years he came to California. At first he
worked as a shepherd and then as a miner.
He succeeded at the mines, but felt that
be was called to the priesthood, and, with
out counting the cost, he msde the sac
rifice. While mining he donated consid
erable money to the Church of the
Immaculate Conception at Watkinsville,
Siskiyou County, which he built almost
alone.
When he decided to study for the priest
hood he went back to Portugal and entered
at once on the work. He was bo diligent
that in two years he was back in California
and was ordained in San Francisco. He
went to Honolulu and also to China, and
some years ago* he was placed in charge of
the Portuguese congregation in West Oak
land. He at once set to work to build a
church and organize a parish. About live
years ago the handsome church was built
i from which he was buried to-day. Tl;e
priest's dying wish was that he might live
till he had seen all the debt on his church
paid off.
Many priests were present, at the church,
includine the Revs. Logan, Coyle, Cran
well, Burn, Serda, Scanlan, Cull, Butler,
Blavin, Hessler, Phillip-*, Laguna, O'Reilly,
i De Campos, Byrne, McNally and Alfred.
The interment was at St. Mary'a Ceme
tery. The Portuguese Benevolent Society
acted as escort to the remains, and there
was a great crowd at the cemetery to wit
ness the final ceremony.
The services were conducted at the en
trance to the receiving vault, and the two
draped flags that were crossed over the en
trance added much to the solemn effect of
the scene.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, June 29. j
Mrs. Wolfe, a sister of Meyer Cohen, the
Oakland newspaper maD who is now un
der arrest at Tacoma for passing a forged
check in this city, was in town to-day and
told a very different story of her brother's
trouble from that already published.
Cohen's friends, and they are legion, de
clare that he is evidently safe from prose
cution or he would not have surrendered
himself. They assert that Meyer was
broke in Tacoma, and that be thought the
best way to get back to Oakland was by
coming here at the expense of the State.
Cohen, it will be remembered, is the young
man wno was to have bean married to
Miss Hinda Greenberg at San Jose a week
ago, but who failed to show up at the wed
ding. Two days later a complaint for
forgery was sworn out against him.
"Meyer's sister was here to-day explain
ing matters," said Joseph Harris, a trustee
of the First Hebrew Congregation. "She
declares that the checks were drawn by
Greenberg. who was to have been Meyer's
father-in-law, and given to Meyer one
night when he was calling on his fiancee.
"He returned to Oakland and naturally
went to some of the Jewish merchants
where he was known to have it cashed.
For some reason which she knows not
Greenberg became uneasy and withdrew
bis money from tbe bank on which tbe
check was drawn.
"When the bank in Oakland sent it to
San Jose for collection there was no
money and it was returned. There was
no charge of forgery then, nor until after
he failed to be present at the wedding.
She declares that the charge was then
made out of pique and to get even with
him. She declares, he is innocent of any
crime and cites his readiness to return
and face his accusers on the charge of
theft preferred against him in support of
her position. We are now all awaiting the
young man's return with interest owing to
this new turn in the case."

A Peculiar Case of Paralysisâ Death
of an Old Residentâ Meeting of
City Trnste2s.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 29. â Health
Officer Dr. John T. McLean returned from
Washiugton, D. C, late Saturday evening-
He was sent to the capital last January by
the county and this city to nrge upon the
Government the necessity of completing
tbe tidal canal.
He is as enthusiastic, energetic and de
termined as ever that the canal shall be
completed, and he will leave no stone un
turned to impress the powers that be on
this side of the continent that tne work
has to be done.
In speaking of nis labors in Washington
Dr. McLean said that an appropriation of
between $800,000 and $900,000 had been
made for the completion of the pending
improvements under the continuous con
tract system, and the California delega
tion hud made representations to the
Government engineers to use the means at
their disposal for this year to dredge the
tidal canal and build a floodgate at its
upper end.
The original plan as laid out for the con
struction of the channel had never been
carried out, and as a consequence there
had been expended $1,800,000, the amount
originally intended to complete the whole
work, and still it is in a half-finished con
dition. This is because thousands and
thousands of dollars have been expended

Acute Paraph legia.
ALAMEDA, Cal., June 29.â C. H. Wall,
1718 Arbor street, was brought home
yesterday from Bartlett Springs, a help
less paralytic. He can see and hear, but
speech and motion are denied him. Mr.
Wall was enpagec! on the Daily Report as
advertising manasrer and had run down so
that he sought a change at Bartlett Springs
to recuperate and rid himself of an attack
of incipient rheumatism. Last Thursday
he wrote that he was feeling better and
intended returning after July Fourth.
On Friday his wife received a telegram to
go up at once and bring him home.
The case is a most interesting one from
a physician's point of view, for the
paralysis is said by the doctors to have
been induced Dv the excessive hot bathing
and over-exertion. This, however, has
no berains on the character of the water
itself.

ASSESSORS' AUTHORITY.
The Constitutionality of the Act At
tacked by the Postal Telegraph
Company.
The application of the Pacific Postal
Telegraph Cable Company for an injunc
tion to restrain County Assessor H. P.
"balton from selling the personal property
seized by reason of the refusal of the com
pany to pay the tax as assessed, instead ol
upon the valuation returned the com
pany, came up before Judge Ogden to-day
ana a temporary injunction was issued
upon the company putting up a $100u
bond.
The Postal company claims that the as
sessment of their property in Alameda
County is excessive and not in accord with
that of the Western Union, and that they
should be granted a restraining order until
the matter could be heard beioro the Su
pervisors, sitting as a Board of Equaliza
tion, as in daiault of thi9 their*property
would be sold without recourse upon an
arbitrary assessment made by the county
official.
The attorney for the company attacked
the constitutionality of the act of 1895
under which the Assessor is proceeding
and claimed that it was in conflict with
section 13 and others relative to the right
of citizens to seek remedy before boards of
equalization. He claimed that the sale of
I the property in advance of a hearing before
I the Board of Equalization would work an
I irreparable injury to the plaintiff.
As to the tirst point the District Attor
ney argued that the company had its
remedy by paying the tax under protest,
and then if the Board of Equalization
sustained the protest it could be rebated
by the Assessor. He also contended that
the power oi the Assessor to seize and sell
personal property must be exercised before
the first Monday in July, as then he must
turn the rolls over to the Tax Collector.
Judge Ogden siid he considered sui
ricient showing had been made for a tem
porary order, so granted it. The matter
will be heard on its merits early in July.

FOOTE GAVE THE LIE,
Almost a Fist Fight in the Oak
land Police Court at
High's Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 29. )
The trial of Gavin Dhu Hieh, editor of
the Times, for publishing an alleged libul
on W, J. Dingee. president of the Oakland
Water Company, lasted till late to-night.
An effort was made to close tho case to
night, but W. W. Foote, who appeared
as special counsel for W. J. Dingee, wished
to put on some witnesses who were not
present and continuance was Agreed upon
till to-morrow evening.
The Police Court was crammed all day,
and to-iÂ«ight when the City Council ad
journed all the members went direct to
the court. W. J. Dingee and W. E. Dargie
were the chief witnesses for tne prosecu
tion, and Editor High took tbe stand in
his own behalf.
Attorneys Beatty and Foote keiit the
proceedings very lively throughout, and
to-night the court had to interfere to pre
â vent what promised to be a physical right.
Mr. Foote asked Hi^h a question relating
to bis conduct while employed on "Cali
fornia on Wheels," which toured in the
East some time ago.
"That is an infamous question," said
Attorney Beatty.
"If you ?<ay that I would ask an in
famous question you are a liar," said Mr.
Foote.
There was some explaining, and the dis
tance between the two attorneys somewhat
diminished, when Judge Wood peremp
torily called them to order.
W. E. Dartrie testified that High had
come to him and told him that bethought
Dingee should give him a typesetting ma
chine and $150 a month for the purpose of
keeping him friendly.
Counsel for High attempted to go into
the financial affairs of Dargie in the spring
of 1895 for the purpose of showing that he
was indebted to Dingee, but the objection
to such questioning was sustained. In de
fense, High said he had not seen the libel
ous item till after it was published. He
denied having to leave "California on
for immoral conduct, and when
his testimony closed the case went over
till to-morrow night.

SOME STRANGE
SCHOOL CHANGES
Now Occurring at the
Cogswell Polytechnic
College.
L. A. BUCHANAN RESIGNS
He Was Sorely Displeased
With His Surrounding
Conditions.
J. H. CULVER TO SUCCEED HIM.
The Singular Story of a Famous
College and Its Venerable
Founder.
Since the close of the terra, two weeks
ago, the board of trustees of the Cogswell
Polytechnic College has accepted the
resignation of its principal professor,
L. A. Buchanan, Late Principal of the Cogsweil Polytechnic College.
Louis A. Buchanan. The vacancy thus
created will be filied upon the reopening
of the school, August 3, by the appoint
ment of James H. Culver, the secretary of
the Mechanics' Institute.
This leaked out yesterday, and more
surprises are soon expected to occur in
connection with the conduct of the college
and the institute.
Just at present the parties most inter
ested are, for personal reasons, reluctant
to talk.
Ferdinand Formhals of the board of
trustees of the Mechanics' Institute stated
that the resignation of Secretary Culver
has been received and will be formally
accepted at the next session of the trus
tees on Tuesday evening, July 7. The
resignation of Professor Buchanan ha 3
already Deen formally accepted and be is
now considering which one of the several
offers made him will be the most accept
able. He may, perhaps, enter the San
Francisco School Department, or he may
conclude to join the educational corps of
the Throop Institute ol Southern Cali
fornia. As yet he is undecided and will be
governed by the turn of future events.
So far as Secretary Culver is concerned,
it is virtually decided that upon the open
ing of the term next August he will
assume tlie principaiship of the Cogswell
Polytechnic College. The reason for these
changes are not quite clear. The air is
full of rumors, but nothing very definite
can as yet be stated.
Professor Buchanan is a practical me
chanic and was formerly an instructor in
the Leland Stanford Jr. University. At
the opening of the California (the James
Lick) School of Mechanical Arts he was
engaged by Principal George A. Merrill as
the head of the department of mathe
matics. From this position he resigned, a
year or two ago, to take the principalship
of the Cogswell Polytechnic College on
Folsom street. At that time the
financial affairs of the institution
were in an uncertain and un
satisfactory condition. A suit, filed by its
founder. Dr. H. D. Cogswell, to break the
deed of trust, was pending in the courts
and upon the decision depended the fu
ture income and status of the school.
Since then, under a decision of the Su
preme Court of California, the life of the
college is perpetuated and it has now an
assured income of $20,000 a year. Its con
trol is vested in v board of trustees, con
sisting of Dr. and Mrs. H. D. Cogswell,
Messrs. Culver, Ewing, Lewis, Doble and
Knight.
The appointment of J. H. Culver as
principal of the Cogswell Polytechnic Col
lege has caused considerable comment in
educational circles, it being argued that
the position can be properly filled only by
a trained teacher. In that line Mr. Cul
ver makes no pretensions.
He is an experienced man of business,
witii a mechanical turn of mind. Many
years ago he was superintendent of the
old Clay-street Hill Cable Railroad. In
1885, during the presidency of P.

Eczema made its appearance on my head in

B. Cornwall, he was elected secretary of
the Mechanics' Institute, which position
he has ably filled ever since. For several
terms he has served as a member of
the Board of Education, but further
than this is not known to have had the ad
vantage of any practical or professional
school experience. He has consented to
give all possible assistance to his successor
until after the coming fair, but will nom
inally take control of tbe school at the
opening of the term. Robert Cash and J.
H. Wood are among the prominent candi
dates for the vacant secretaryship.
Professor Buchanan is inclined to main
tain a discreet silence concerning the
troubles in the Cogswell Polytechnic Col
lege, and. incidentally, the causes which
led to his own removal.
One thing is well established, however.
Professor Buchanan entertains a cordial
dislike for the gentleman in whose honor
the college is named, and says that under
no circumstances would he remain^ at the
head of an institution with which the
doctor had any connection. Just the
cause of the trouble between the principal
and the founder of the school is not easily
learned. Professor Buchanan says that at
the proper time he will tell all he knows.
In the meantime he prefers to deal en
tirely in innuendoes.
"l"have nothing to say at present," he
remarked last night. "At no very distant
day, however, 1 shall have something
interesting to tell, and then â " and the
professor sighed.
"The entire faculty was dismissed about
five weeks ago without the slightest warn
ing, though I had previously resigned,
because of another situation in view which
was better in every way."
James G. Maeuire Guard.
A largely attended meeting of the James G.
Maguire Guard was held lust night in Judge
Sanderson's courtroom, Will D. Flinn, the
president, in the chair. After appointing va
rious ways and means committees they ad
journed till next Monday evening in the same
p'.ace and marcned in a body to the Metropoli
tan Temple to attend the anti-funding ratili
cation meeting.
TWO TEACHERS' CLUBS,
But Between Them There Ex
ists No Conflicting In
terests.
Distinct Purposes of the Teachers'
Club and the New Teachers'
Council.
There is not, as has erroneously been
supposed, the slightest conflict of interests
or antagonism existing between the "San
Francisco Teachers' Club" and tne "Teach
ers' Council," the organization of which
was recently authorized by a resolution
introduced in the Board of Education by
Director C. A. Murdock.
In fact, the aims and objects of the two
societies are quite distinct. Tbere is ro
good reason to suppose that they cannot
co-operate harmoniously and prove each
in its own sphere benericial to its respect
ive members and the School Department.
The purpose of the Teachers' Club, of
which Milton E. Blanchard of the Lowell
High School is president, is chiefly of an
intellectual character, while that of the
Teachers' Council will be more legislative
than intellectual.
The Teachers' Club marks the develop
ment of an idea that is of slow growth,
the necessity for unification. Last winter
it was reorganized with a constitution pro
viding for an active membership limited
to forty. Tbese-forty members alone had
tbe right to vote and possessed ostensibly
tbe power of regulating the affairs of the
club, the officers of whicn had co be se
lected from among them. The reason for
this numerical restriction was to insure
the attention to the needs of the club that
could advantageously be given it by a
small and select body.'
A line of work resembling the seminary
work of some of the larger educational in
stitutions was mapped out and tne co
operation of the University of Caliiornia
and the Leland Stanford Jr. University
was enlisted. Professor Bailey of the
University of California gave a valuable
course of lectures upon pedagogy, a French
class was established under the tuition of
Professor Roger, an accomplished linguist
and scholar of Trinity School. Pro
fessor Hudson of the Stanford University
gave a course of Saturday morning lec
tures on literature. A class in manual
training was also started. The privilege
of any or all these classes was open alike
to all the members, active or associate.
Serious objections were raised subse
quently to the limitation of the number
of active members, and the constitution
was, consequently, amended and this un-
American provision was abolished. The
club is now squarely upon its. feet and
hopes to be a permanent organization that
will in due time develop a true profes
sional spirit among the public school
educators of San Francisco. The line of
activity will be in tbe direction of af
fording an opportunity to teachers to pur
sue any course of study they may desire
under the direction of the best available
instructors. The universities are gener
ously disposed toward the club, and it has
been suggested that the work done under
the direction of its professors be accredited
as extension work.
The delightful reception held by the
club at tbe close of the term shows that
the social phase is not neglected. Follow
ing are the announcements of the studies
for the next term, beginning in August:
French classes and manual training con
tinned; course of lectures by Dr. E. E.
Brown, U. C. ; lecture by Professor G. H.
Howison, U. C; class in zoology, ten les
sons in laboratory, and six or eight lec
tures by Dr. W. E. Ritter, U. C. ; class in
literature, also general monthly meeting.
The Teacbers r Council will be organized
immediately after vacation.
Dr. imie, Not Dr. Case.
Through an error in yesterday's issue it was
made to appear that the address on "The
Fourth and Foreign Flags" had been delivered
by Dr. Case. This should have read Dr. Dllle,
who is the pastor of the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church, wbere the address was given.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 1896.
RED-VISAGED WAR
IN CHINATOWN.
Wong Family Withdraws
From the See Yup
Company.
LURID NOTICES POSTED.
Chee Tong Tries to Abolish the
Boycott on the Sam Yup
Company.
POLICE WARN THE FACTIONS.
Sergeants Helms and Harper Kept
Exceedingly Busy Tearing
Down Posters.
The strongest Chinese faction in this
City, known as the Wong family, under
the leadership of Chee Tong, has with
drawn from the See Yup Company, with
the object of breaking the boycott on the
Sam Yup Company.
This boycott nas been'oppresting China
town's poor for almost a year, and as its
effect has raised the price of all Cninese
commodities fully 20 per cent it is evident
that the poverty-stricken Celestials have
just cause for complaint.
This fact, however, is not considered as
being worthy of a second thought in the
minds of tne agitators, and in consequence
Chinatown is bubbling over with excite
ment. Highbinders are out in force dis
cussing the withdrawal of the Wong
family and trouble is imminent. An extra
force of policemen was detailed last even
ing to patrol the streets of the Mongolian
quarter. They were instructed that in
event of a riot or trouble of any descrip
tion they were to use all the means in their
power to preserve the peace.
Dp to a few weeks ago Chee Tong was
the secretary of the See Yup Company,
but he was discharged on some pretense
or other, and forthwith laid plans to equal
ize the score.
First, he got the Wong family to with
draw from the See Yup Company in order
to break up this boycott.
Then he issued circulars stating that any
member might buy wherever and what
evr he pleased and at whatever place he
could get what he wanted the cheapest.
He also stated that in case of any trouble
the Wong family would take a hand and,
if necessary, resort to force of arms.
Upon hearing this the See Yup Com
pany immediately posted circulars all over
tbe Chinese quarters. Groups were scat
tered through the streets yesterday deeply
interested in the lurid-colored posters.
Kong Chow, secretary of the See Yups
and a member of tne Bo Ong Tong So
ciety, was the person who issued the cir
culars, which are freely translated as fol
lows :
Members of the See Yup Company do not stir
up any trouble. We made a contract last July
to boycott the Sam Yup Company, and as the
Wong family has withdrawn we must see that
they are brought back into the combination.
Act'like gentlemen, and make no trouble on the
street. Use discretion so as to uphold the
honor of the company, but be firm and stand
by the contract.
The See Yup has twelve societies and
made a contract to boycott the San Yup
Company over a year ago last July. This
has caused many murders.
J. Harper, sergeant of the Chinatown
squad, and Sergeant Helms of the Cali
fornia-street station, the latter having
eight officers under his command, busied
themselves all day yesterday tearing down
posters and scattering crowds of jabbering
Celestials who congregated on the street
corners. The sergeants have informed
both factions that in event of trouble they
will also take an active part in the pro
ceedings.
THE CRAVEN CASE.
Lawyers Preparing for the Hearing,
Which Will Be Kesumed Thursday.
No one lifted a finger in the matter of
the Fair will yesterday or the matter of
the Craven deeds, unless the service of
formal papers upon the lawyers opposed
to Mrs. Craven-Fair in the ejectment suit
may be excepted.
Mr. Delmas was engaged in San Jose
making his argument in the Parker will
case.
George A. Knight was engaged in court
and tbe other lawyers in the case make no
admission of new discoveries of flaws in
the deeds or other developments whatso
ever.
The matter will come up for hearing be
fore Judge Slack at 11 o'clock Thursday
morning, when Mrs. Craven will take the
stand again and complete the story of the
theft from her of the ink will at or near Og
den, while returning to this City from New
York with both copies. She was at the
time hurrying here in response to tele
grams from Reuben H. Lloyd that warned
her that the trust will would be probated
if sbe delayed.
The hearing will probably run through
several days and the marriage contract
will be introduced before its conclusion.
Mrs. Haskins. Mrs. Craven's friend who
visited hei the day Senator Fair is said to
have written the pencil will, will be put
on the stand to tell what she aaw and did
on that day.
Mrs. Craven is still ill and refuses to
talk about the case.
THE FIGHTING ACTORS,
Sharkey Is Open for an Engage
ment to Tour Through
the Country.
Sam Fitzpatrick Writes That Fitz-
Simmons Is Frosted in London
and That Jackson Is Well.
Tom Sharkey remained over in Oakland
last evening. He finished his engagement
at the Alcazar on Sunday evening, and
yesterday he was looking up engagements
elsewhere. Before leaving for Oakland he
dropped in to see bis friend Gilleran of the
Windsor Hoiel, and smilingly informed
him that he had arranged with the Fraw
ley Company, which is at present playing
at the Columbia Theater, to travel with
the company through the State. During
the acts Sharkey and Needham were to
appear in a boxing bout of three or four
rounds. Gilleran seemed pleased to learn
that Sharkey was so very successful in
having consummated an agreement to that
end with such a prominent company and
wished him success.
Manager Friedlander of the Columbia
Theater, when spoken to on the subject
last evening, was very indignant that any
such report had found circulation.
'â¢Why, there's not a word of truth in it,"
said Mr. Friedlander, "and I can assure
you that this company will have nothing
to do with Mr. Sharkey or any other
pugilist. No, sir.tbis company can get
along very well without the necessity of
having to encage fistic talent."
Dan Lynch, Sharkey's manager, could
not be found last evening, but in all prob
ability if Fharkey will go on the road as a
star boxing performer he will join some
company which will be organized from
among the numerous actors about town
who are now looking for any kind of en
gagement that will bring them in an hon
est dollar.
Jim Corbett will leave to-day or to-mor
row for Baitlett Springs. He will be
joined by his wife and some friends.
After a few weeks at the springs Corbett
will journey East to Asbury Park, his old
training quarters.
Young Mitchell had a letter yesterday
from Sam Fitzpatrick, the successful
trainer and handler of noted pugilists.
Filzpatrick stated in his letter that he
had had a chat with Peter Jackson and
that the big colored pugilist was looking
first-class. The trainer did not say, how
ever, that Peter intended to enter the ring
again, and his silence on this point has
been interpreted as meaning that Peter's
days as a champion pugilist are passed.
It would be interesting to know what
Jackson Das to say now of Corbett.
Of Fitzsimmons, Fitzpatrick said that
the New Zealander was having somewhat
of a frost in England, and that the money
he expected to make on the stage is not
materializing.
Evidently the English people have a
very different opinion from Americans of
pugilists of the present day who have a
predilection for the stage. The actor
pugilist would not make his salt in any
country other than Araerioa, and Sullivan
discovered that, to his chagrin, when he
visited Australia with the intention of
returning home laden down with Austra
lian gold.
Fitzpatrick will soon return to this coun
try wish his charge, Champion "Kid"
Lavigne, and, of course, he will be ready
with man and money to talk business
with any pugilist or pugilistic manager,
Map Showing the Route of the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway as Far as It Is Now
Being Operated.
[Drawn from official records.]
with a view of matching Lavigne against
the highest bidder for cash.
Manager Gibbs ol the National Club
states that Mr. Trueman, president of the
Civic Federation, was present at the con
test between Corbett and Sharkey, and
that he occupied a seat in a box set apart
specially for him and bis friends. The
report that Trueman had telephoned
Gibbs and Groom for extra seats was
erroneous.
"1 received a telephone message at the
Pavilion that Mr. Trueman desired three
extra tickets," said Gibbs, "but I soon
discovered that the message was sent by
some enterprising individuals who thought
the scheme would work and that he could
obtain first-class seats without having to
pay a cent for them. I telephoned back
that the $5 tickets were all sold, but that
if heâ the one who telephoned â would put
in an appearance with his friends at the
door of tbe Pavilion some eood seats
would be provided for them. The scnemers
did not put in an appearance, much to the
disgust of a big husky scrapper who had a
well-seasoned hickory club in readiness to
give the telephoners a warm reception.
The Occidental Club has made all pre
parations necessary for its exhibition at
the Pavilion on Thursday evening. The
two "Billies"â Smith and Gallagherâ are
in splendid condition and a rattling good
ten-round contest can be looked for. If
Joe Choynski is in town on the evening in
question he will be selected to referee the
contest. Tom Sharkey. Tim McGrath and
Jimmy Anthony will act as Smith's sec
onds and Young Carkeet, Jim Jeffries and
G. Mulverhill will esquire Gallagher.
The preliminaries will consist of a ten
round bout between Long, 184 pounds,
and Jeffries, 195 pounds; also a six-round
bout between the clever lightweight boxers,
Danny Mahoney and Joe Sullivan.
A MARRIAGE AT SEA.
Attorney F. A. Roaal Holda That It
la Perfectly Legal in
Any Event.
Attorney F. A. Rossi holds that the
marriage of the Maglios â uncle and niece
last Sunday mornimr on a tug at sea out
side of the jurisdiction of the State, is a
lawful contract, inasmuch as the validity
of a marriage depends upon tbe law of
the place where it is contracted.
"One of the morning papers," said Mr.
Rossi, "had me making a long discussion
upon international law. I say there is no
such law involved in this case, and a mar
riage on the high seas is governed by the
agreement of the parties to the contract.
If it is lawful for the master of a vessel at
sea to marry a man and woman aboard of
his ship, then the law prevails in that
locality, and in 51 California the Supreme
Court has decided that under the laws of
this State the legality of the marriage de
pends upon the law of the place where
that marriage is contracted.
"In some foreign countries marriages
within a degree of consanguinity are law
ful and we have not heard that our courts
have declared such contracts illegal when
the parties have immigrated to this State.
"Speaking of this particular case 1 ad
vised the Maglios io take this step not
because I approved of it from a moral
standpoint, for I most emphatically do
not. It was a case of doing the best thing
possible under the circumstances. They
also obtained legal advice in Fresno and
were told that they could be legally
married at sea."
Struck Her Landlord.
M. Dittlebach, an old man, swore out a
warrant in Judge Joachimsen's court yester
day for tbe arrest of Mrs. Summers, 2910
Twenty-filth street, one of his tenants. A few
days ago he called upon her for his rent, when
be alleges she struck him iv the face, blacken
ing one of bis eyes.
ROUTE OF THE
VALLEY ROAD,
First Authentic Map of the
Southern Pacific's
Competitor.
FROM OFFICIAL DATA.
In Position to Draw From Two
Strong Tentacles of the
" Octopus."
NEW STATE RAILROAD CHARTS
Expected to Be Ready for Distribution
the Latter Part of This
Week.
Within a week the official railroad map
of the State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners will be ready for distribution. It
is nearly five years since the last map of
the commission was issued and several
new railroads have been added to the
transportation lines of the State during
this period, by far the most important be
ing the San Francisco and San Joaouin
Valley Railway.
Among the roads which will appear for
the first time on this map are the San
iTancisco and San Joaquin Valley: Ala
meda and San Joaquin; Monterey and
Fresno; Oakland, San Lea rid ro and Hay
wards (electric); Crescent City and Smiths
River; Bodie and Benton; Pacific Lumber
Company's; San Diego, Pacific Beach and
La Jolla; Mount Lowe.
The map last issued was brought up to
November 15, 1891, arid tne one about to
be published will record the railroad
development up to date. Six thousand
copies will be printed. 1000 of which will
Demounted.
Thare are already about 2500 applications
for them on tile in the office of the com
mission, 500 having come from foreign
countries. The latter are mainly from
banks and financial institutions.
They will be about 4x5 feet, and are
drawn on a scale of fifteen miles to tbe
inch. Little but the routes of the iron
rails will be shown on them, thus making
them peculiarly serviceable for railroad
information.
They will be more nearly accurate than
any other map published so far as railroad
lines are concerned, as the drawings were
made from official data furnished by each
road.
On the proof submitted yesterday the
Southern Pacific's great competitor, the
San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway, is shown only half way from
Stockton to Merced, when in fact the road
is completed beyond Merced and is in op
eration for wheat shipments two stations
the other side of that city. The attention
of the Railroad Commission will be called
to this matter to-day, and an effort will be
made by the Valley road people to have
their line shown on this map as far as its
route has been definitely fixed. This is
considered an important matter, as an
other similar map will not be published
for some years.
More than usual interest attaches to this
road and the route it is to take, as it is
recognized as the only genuine competitor
on a large scale that the Southern Pacific
has ever had within the State, and this in
terest has been intensified by its recent in
auguration of the war it is destined to
carry on against its rival. No authentic
map of the Valley road has heretofore
been published, for the simple reason that
none could be drawn, owing to the uncer
tainty of its route caused by right-of-way
litigation. It was only last week that the
last of these suits between Stockton and
Merced was settled.
The map herewith presented is from the
official records of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railway, and shows
that road as it will probably appear on the
revised map of the Railroad Commission.
The monopoly's great rival, it will be seen,
runs about midway between two of the
most profitable branches of the Southern
Pacific Company. It is thus in a position
to draw traffic from both, as it undoubt
edly will, and even though the Southern
Pacific meets the cuts of the monopoly
destroying road the people who have long
suffered from the exactions and extortions
of the Huntington properties are likely to
favor the road which has at last broken
some of the tentacles of the "octopus."
FOLSOM STREET FINISHED.
John W. McDonald Has Fulfilled His
Contract on Time.
John W. McDonald, who represents the
City Street Improvement Company, has
finished his contract in paving Folsom
street from Nineteenth to Sixth on time
with the conditions of his contract and
has turned that boulevard over to the City
in a thoroughly remodeled condition.
The old Folsom street that was is no
more, and now the old swampy and ill
tmved street is as smooth and even as the
surface of a billiard-table with the excep
tion of the block between Ninth and
Tenth, which is yet covered with cobbles.
The whole has been covered with a con
crete bed, upon which is spread a coating
of bitumen, making it one of the best
thoroughfares in tbe City.
. The Market-street Railroad Company
hÂ£s yielded to public policy and har
monized the portion between the double
line of tracks with the same material as
the balance of the street. This portion of
the work will be finished in the course
of a week, after which the residents and
the traveling public will be made glad
with the hum of the electric-cars, which
will go speeding along its line from the
water front to Twenty-ninth street.
For all this improvement the Mission
people with one accord feel grateful to A.
B. Maguire for the laudable interest he
has taken in their welfare and happiness.
SIX NEW ENSIGNS ARRIVE.
Just Graduated From Annapolis and
Assigned to the Philadelphia.
Six young naval officers, fresh from
the United States academy at Annapolis,
arrived at the Occidental last night.
Tney have been assigned to duty on the
cruiser Philadelphia and will go to Santa
Cruz to join their ship.
The party consists of C. M. Jozer of
Little Falls, N. V.; I. C. Wettengel of
Denver, Colo. ; G. S. Lincoln of Liberty.
Mo.; J. A. Kearney of Springfield, Oil;
Arthur Mac Arthur Jr. of Milwaukee,
Wis., and Mr. Wurtsbaugh of Jefferson,
Tex. There is only one homely man in
tbe lot, and ne is good-natured.
All of them were congregated in one of
hotel rooms last night celebrating the end
of a dusty railroad journey across the con-
tinent. Pink lemonade in small glasses
and Turkish cigarettes were the most evi
dent sources of good cheer.
Their class, which graduated June 5,
numbered only thirty-eight, twelve being
assigned to the engineers' corpj.
The prospective long wait for the peace
ful or violent retirement of superior offi
cers does not worry the young ensis.'DS at
present, for they are already planning a
summer campaign among the fair
babitues of Santa Cruz and Monterey,
where they have to put in a good deal of
time before the Philadelphia shall start
for Alaska.
HER PRETTY EYES FILLED
Miss Lansing Rowan's Hard
Ordeal at the Columbia
Theater.
A Thoughtless Jcke Spoken in Fan Is
One of the Causes of Her Great
Unhappiness.
You aak me the reason?
I know you won't laughâ
I've a little one dying at home.
â Dorkins' Night.
Miss Lansing Rowan had a sad heart
when she stepped on the stage last night
at the Columbia. The news of her father's
suicide in Batavia, N. V., on Sunday
almost v.n "itted her for any public func
tion. V. inager T. Daniel Frawley, ap
preciating her condition and sympathiz
ing with the young lady, asked her to re
main in seclusion with her sorrow for a
while, saying he would endeavor to have
Miss Tittball of Oakland assume her role.
It was to be the first night's production
of "His Wife's Father," and Miss Rowan
felt bound to carry out her contract and
appear. Besides that she said :
â¢"I would go simply mad if I were to re
main alone in ray room. I prefer to go on
and foreet."
Miss Rowan is a bright sunbeam in the
life of every one around her. She is loved
by her fellow-actors in the company for
her charming individuality, and they are
all unhappy that a cloud has come over
her.
Her lot is hardest because of being un
deserved, and the pain she suffers is more
poignant by the reason of hei alertness in
conversation. A few evenings ago she
was talking to a newspaper correspondent
who knew her to be a vigorous and ath
letic young woman. She spoke princi
pally on the topic of fencing, as she is an
adept with the foils.
"I fear no man!" she exclaimed, allud
ing to her particular ability as a swords
woman.
"Not even Corbett?" was asked.
"No, not even Corbett," she answered.
â¢'I would challenge him."
The nfws was telegraphed all over the
East arm was misunderstood apparently,
for it came back as if Miss Rowan was
posing as a pugilist.
Worse still, unkind people said her old
father, ill in health and generally broken
down, had committed suicide on that ac
count.
These are the reasons.why Miss Rowan's
eyes wer* perhaps a little red on the stage
and the tears filled them at times.
Two Buildings Burned.
At 10:30 last night a fire broke out at 13
Whitney street in the residence of Charles
Heidburn. The building and its c.n n t en ts
were destroyed, loss about $1500. Tue fire
spread to No. 15. occupied as a residence by
Police Corporal M. ShannHhan, which was also
burned. The loss was $ 1100. The fire wat
caused by the overturning of a coal-oil lamp.

vorces. Henrietta Hughes was separated from
Charles P. Hughes, because of the latter's will
ful neglect. The care and custody of the minoi
children were awarded to the plaintiff.
