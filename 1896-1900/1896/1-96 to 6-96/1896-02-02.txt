LONDON, Eng., Feb. I.â Ever since the
revolting butchery of Stambouloff the
people of Europe have been keeping one
eye on. Prince Ferdinand, watching to see
his feet slip in the blood of his victim, and
there is heightened dramatic excitement
about the task just now, for it looks as if
a week or bo must brinjr this cowardly
Coburger to a reckoning of seme sort.
He is arriving in Sofia to-night, after hav
ing been to Paris, where bis'doings remain
unknown, thence to Rome, where the Pope
sneered at him as too despicable for the
church's wrath and Ram polio showed him
the door, and to Vienna, where the im
perial officials declined to see him at all.
In his absence the Bulgarian Ministry
has issued invitations to the ceremony of
Prince Boris' conversion to the Orthodox
faith, called out the military to suppress
any possible disorder, and stand ready ap
parently to dictate terms to Ferdinand.
He left Vienna, saying sorrowfully to his
friends that probably he will have to
abdicate and that he must reach a final
decision within the next few days.
It is not so clear that the power of de
cision is any longer in his hands, but it will
be no surprise if next week sees him
either quitting Bulgaria altogether or pub
licly submitting to the baptism of his son,
which wiil be tantamount to putting the
7-rincipaiUy into the pocket of the Gzar.
i-jitlu.-r alternative must bring Bulgaria to
the from in Europe's anxious eye and
keep it there. There are other ways in
which all men see it likely that the East
ern question will be reopened next spring,
but none of which threatens the general
peace so nearly as this Bulgarian busi
ness. It is conceivable that Russia may,
â¢under the guise of an arrangement with
the Sultan, march an army corps . into
Armenia when the snow melts, as she is
expected to do, without meeting with
practical resistance from any other power,
but it is hardly believable that Austria
can sit still and see Bulgaria substantially
under the protectorate of the Czar.
As the Triple Alliance makes common
action binding only when one of the â¢*â¢"%
ties is invaded, Austria could not claim
Germany's assistance in such an emer
gency ; but it is now clear that Bhe is striv
ing to form another combination of her
own with England, Italy and Roumania
to help her to meet this' impending crisis.
It may be taken as fairly certain that
England's recent attempts to placate
France are preliminaries or accompani
ments to the proposition that she will
quit Russia and join this new league to
answer Kaiser Wilhelm's affront to Eng
land and his practical betrayal of his al
lies for the sake of the Czar's friendship
by arraying against this new Russo-Ger
man entente a general European league,
and this would delight Vienna and Rome
scarcely Jess than London. France, however,
weighÃ her enthusiastic hopes of Russian
assistance against her fears of Muscovite
treachery and her memories of German
conquest and spoliation, and hesitates.
If the matter could be fairly, argued in
France her choice would be less doubtful,
but her press is so largely under the con
trol of German syndicates and of others,
whose business it is at all hazards to keep
her making friends with England, that
there is rather a dubious chance of the
Chambers being brought round to see
things as they are.
Meanwhile the British flying squadron,
which was mobilized with such a startling
display of urgency, is being calmly held in
the Solent to take part in Prince Henry of
Battenberg's funeral. This remarkable
alteration of plans is ascribed to deference
to the Queen's wish, but it is hard to sup
pose that this would have been done if
something else had not happened to
change the situation. It is more likely
that the funeral services are in the official
mind as a welcome pretext for keeping the
squadron wher* it forms in practice a
huge addition to the channel fleet, and yet
affords no ground for diplomatic inquiries.
fThe notion referred to last week that there
was ill feeling growing up between Salis
bury and Chamberlain has made a marked
advance in the minds of the politicians
since then. Salisbury's speech last night
has been studied to-day with great intent
ness, and people find in it all sorts of hints
to confirm this suspicion. Especially does
his jocose treatment of the Transvaal busi
ness, in which he seems on the whole
rather to approve of Dr. Jameson than
otherwise, read like a deliberate attempt
to belittle Chamberlain's performances.
His curious and unsatisfactory eulosium
of the Monroe doctrine, too, though nomi
nally in answer to John Morley, is visibly
by way of a rejoinder to Chamberlain, who
was shrewd enough a week ago to-night
to see which way the cat was jumping,
and suddenly posed as more ardently de
sirous of American friendship than any
body else in the Ministry.
In fact, when Parliament meets ten days
hence it will be with the feeling in the air
that new and large party combinations are
possibly impending. The two by-elec
tions in London this week have shown the
Liberal party to be even weaker now than
it wa& when it amazedly picked itself out

of the mud last July. Its rank and file
begin to fear that it has been too terribly
mangled to go on holding up its head
alone, even if it could shake off the Rose
bery incubus which paralyzes at the top.
Rumors that Chamberlain may work his
chartered, company cards so as to put the
Tories in the. wrong, and be able to march
triumphantly back with most of his
Unionist followers into the Liberal camp,
and with an issue on which to sweep the
country when he goes before it as a Lib
eral leader, begin to filter through Liberal
circles. These no longer abhor Chamber
lain as they did a year ago, and they are
very sick over having risked and lost so
much for the sake of the home rule phan
tom. Who knows? Stranger things have
happened.
Very soon now the arrival in relays of
Cecil Rhodes and his lawyers, then Jame
son and his officers, then his paroled
troops will be imposing on Englishmen in
practical form the extremely embarrassing
task of settling what is to be done about
the whole vexatious business. Thus far
nobody seems to know what tribunal they
are to be brought before, or what the Min
istry's intentions in the matter are. Many
rumors are afloat about the difference of
opinion in the Cabinet on this point, hint
ing that Chamberlain in- his efforts to
secure a real trial is being opposed by
powerful influences in the interest of the
chartered company, but these stories are
probably born of surmise. There is a cer
tain crim humor in one aspect of the case.
A. doleful parent writes to the Tames
pointing out that these 400 Jameson troop
ers who are on their way home are mostly
young men whose parents sent them to
the Cape to try their fortunes, and will
now get them back on their hands with
nothing to do but fit them out again and
send them back to Africa once more, and
as they are largely sons of needy small
gentry this expense will be a grievous
blow to their parents, and he thinks that
the chartered company ought to be made
to pay the $50,000 or so that it will cost.
The first genuine test of the stability of
the Bourgeois Ministry will come appar
ently on the income tax proposal in the
budget submitted to-day. The scheme
differs in a remarkable way from all pre
vious attempts to apply a graduated scale
to income taxation, in that it separates
into different classes each individual in
come.
Thus a man with $15,000 a year pays 5
per cent on $6000, 4 per cent on $5000, 3 per
cent on $2000, 2 per cent on $1000 and 1 per
cent on $500, and the remaining sum of $500
is to be exempt. To this extraordinary com
plication in added the intricacy of a sys
tem by which deductions are to be made
on account of the number of children a
man has, which in the case of a large fam
ily might wipe off half of his taxation.
This putting of- a premium on popula
tion is only too excusable in France, where
people look fbrward with positive dread to
tke results of the quinquennial census in
the coming spring, but it makes the budget
easier for the opponents of the tax to as
sail. Their campaign is to be based broadly
on the fact that the proposed change, by
its concurrent abolition of the house tax,
will relieve of all taxation 5,500 i obo present
taxpayers, reduce the taxes now collected
from another million and put ,on the
shoulders of the remaining half million
the burden of not only making good this
huge deficit, but also of providing an extra
s\im of $1,200,000 above that the treasury
now receives. Harold Fbedekio.

FIGHTING IN THE INTEKIOK.
General Cavalla Surprised by Insur
gents and His Forces Defeated
With Great Slaughter.
HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. I.â The news of
the action of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee of the Senate was like a bombshell
here. The Spaniards bad relied on assur
ances that the United -States would refuse
to recognize the belligerency of the Cu
bans. All cables intimating the commit
tee's probable action were suppressed.
Frequent cables from Madrid were pub
lished stating there was no probability ol
favorable action. The Spaniards felt secure
and me Cubans had lost hope of recogni- â 
tion.
The first step created a tremendous sen
sation. The Government refused to per
mit the papers to publish the New York'
cables, but allowed them to print the
Madrid cables, stating that the Cabinet
held a session to consider the action of the
committee in favor of the recognition of
belligerency.
The Spaniards are highly indignant.
The newspaper organs of the Conservative
and Reform parties denounce the action
and refuse to believe that Congress and the
President will approve it. They declared
that if the United States took such action
they would lose more than Spain. They
called attention to Spain's additions to
the navy and increase of defenses for
Cuban ports, saying Spain is prepared for
any emergency.
The Cubans went wild with joy. Many
failed to understand that final action has
not yet been taken. The Cubans de
clared ail they wanted was an opportu
nity to build ships and get arms and am
munition. They said the adoption of the
report meant victory for the Cuban cause.
The feeling against Americana in Spanish
circles is increasing.
There is little doubt that further action
by the United States will make their posi
tion here uncomfortable. The American
residents would feel secure if a warship
were here. The moral effect alone would
be great. Germany is the only foreign
nation represented here now. She has
three schoolships in the harbor. The
French fleet is said to be coming. The
Americans declare that keeping the war
shipsr.away is an outrage.
General Marin took charge of the active
field operations in the hope of a decisive
battle with Gomez. He has a great oppor
tunity before the arrival of Weyler. More
troops are massed in the center of Havana
province than ever before. There are
strong fortifications at every station
armored cars are movable along the rail
road between the stations, and all points
are connected by telegraph. Yet Gomez
crosses when he pleases.
Marin started west for Guanajay Thurs
day morning and stopped over night at
San Antonio owing to tracks being re
moved and wires cut west. Marin be
lieved that both Gomez ana Maceo were
penned up in Pinar province. He in
tended pursuing them, making Guanajay
the base of operations. Gomez, instead of
continuing his march westward to meet
Maceo, moved around Guanajay, brushed
against Marin's pickets Thursday at San
Antonio, passed east through Banos,
struck the railroad line between Bejucal
and Quivican, twenty miles south of
Havana, crossing to the vicinity occupied
last week.
General Cavalla, moving up the line on
a train from Batabana with 800 men,
Thursday afternoon, was stopped by the
rails being removed. Supposing there was
only a small band of rebels he ordered the
troops to attack and found himself sur
rounded by Gomez and his party, in
danger of being wiped out.
The troops were saved by the arrival of
re-enforcements after losing many men.
The Government refuses to furnish any
information. The other sources place the
Spanish loss at 200 men. It is believed
this is exaggerated. General Marin
learned of Canalla's fight Friday morn
ing and changed his plan upon finding
Gomez behind him and moved back to
Rincon, theii southward to San Felipe,
where strong defenses have been erected.

. FRANKFORT, Ky.. Feb. I.â The Senate
bill to repeal the charter of the Southern
Pacific Railroad has been referred to the
committee of which Senator "William E.
Goebel, the author of the bill, is chairman.
The biH will be taken up before the com
mittee the first cf the week, and, it is said,
will be met with strong opposition, which,
as yet, has not openly developed.
Marked copies of a newspaper contain*
ing a history of the charter and urging ita
repeal were laid on the desks of every
member of ' the House and Senate this
morning and great interest is now being
manifested in the bill. A hot fight is in
sight, which promises to be of greater
interest than the Senatorial deadlock.
Senator Goebel declares there is no ques
tion as to the right of the Legislature to
repeal the charter and has been laying
lines in that direction.
The opposition will bring the greatest
fight in the House should the bill pass the
Senate and owing to the limited session
will attempt to prevent its coming to a
final vote.
The part of Governor Bradley's message
sent yesterday which referred to the
abuses of the system followed by railroads
doing business in the State under foreign
charters was well taken as far as Hunting
ton's system in Kentucky ia concerned, as
will be seen by a consideration of the lines
operated by him and his associates under
one name or another.
"Old Smoothing Iron" (John Echols)
has been no <mall factor in fixing the
'â¢integrity and morai durability' 1 of this
system, aad his associate, St., John Boyle,
has done his full part, and though now
associated with Echols in the receivership
of the C. O. and 8. W. Railroad finds
plenty of time to 'come to Frankfort and
fight against the bill to repeal the South
ern Pacific charter. Mr. Boyle has a num
ber of times been the candidate of the Re
publican party in Louisville for Congress
and once of the party for Governor.
In a matter of this kind, however, and
involving such vast interests, the Confed
erate lion and the Union lamb are content
to browse together In Hun tington's good
pastures, and even fight together for his
interests.

dent and managing director. The branches
in Kentucky are the Covington and Mays
ville road and the Lexington and Big
Sandy, which were mostly constructed on
subscriptions from the counties through
which they run, and then following the
usual course fell into Central Pacific hands,
as was projected from the beginning. The
general offices of this company are in
Richmond, Va.
Henry T. Wickham, son of the former
president of the Chesapeake and Ohio, is
the general attorney for the road. From
Louisville to Memphis the lines are under
the name of the Chesapeake and Ohio and
Soutli western, of which Echois is general
manager. By late litigation this line went
into the United States Court, and General
Echois and St. John Boyle are the receiv
ers. Connecting with it are the Owens
boro Falls and Rough and Green River
road, of which M. N. Monarch is receiver
and Echois general manager. Also, the
Ohio Valley Railroad from Henderson to
Hopkinsville, of which .John MacLeod is
receiver and General Echois manager.
The Paducah, Tennessee and Alabama
Railroad is also under Huntincton's con
trol, and a note from a recent communica
tion of Governor Bradley to the Legisla
ture in regard to a State suit against this
railroad will 6how the methods pursued
by it, as with other lines in the Hunting
ton system :
The recent case of the State of Kentucky vs.
tbe Paducab, Tennessee and Alabama Rail
road resulted in a judgment and return of no
property found, and pending notice by the At
torney-General and proceedings to place the
road in the hands of a State receiver, the road
went into the hands of a receiver in the United
States Court.
This same plan is pursued all over the
State. Every case of any consequence is
taken out of the State courts. Tbe State
of Kentucky is as powerless under the
Connecticut charter to the Newport News
HLNTINGTOX'S SYSTEM IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE;
[The heavy lines shew the several railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee operated by C. P. Huntington under the charter of the Newport
News and Mississippi Company. The line from Louisville to Lexington is leased from the Louisville and Nashville Covipany.]
and Mississippi Valley Company as the
State of California is under tne Kentucky
charter to the Southern Pacific Company.
So a long pull and a strong pull both to
gether is required to get rid of Hunting
ton's system.
Tbe Legislature adjourned early to-day,
bo as to give the members from the vicinity
a chance io go home to spend Sunday.
A number wiil, according to the usual
custom, â¢go to Louisville or Cincinnati.
This cuts off any possiblity of considering
the Southern Pacific repeal bill before
Monday night or Tuesday by the commit
tee. Indeed it is safe to say that with the
ali-absorbing Senatorial election taking
up so much of their time they will
hardly have a meeting before Wednesday
at tne earliest, and will not go so far as to
be ready to make a report before the latter
part of the week. In the mean time Hun t
ington's forces' are "making hay." His
men are all good workers and they know
just how to keep their mouths shut to out
siders while they are fixing in the several
approved ways the men they need.
Aa far as can be heard there are a few
men who are strongly in favor of the
Goebel bill, and they so express themselves
when questioned ; but while they will sup
port it when it comes up, they are not
making it their business to win over others
to its support. No one else is doing so.
On the other hand, Huntington's men- are
in force and active in getting members
committed to opposing the bill. They
recognize Goebel's strength in the Senate
and they are confining themselves princi
pally to the members of the House, where
they place their reliance in case the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee makes a report
favoring the passage of the bill.
The fight may be longer than antici
pated, and in the discussion other
committees, both of the Senate and
House, will cut some figure. The lists
of those likely to take any part are as fol
lows:

M. J. Edrington, chairman of the House

upon to do what is right. v
It will be noticed that the membership
of the two Senate Committees on Judiciary
and Rules is almost the same as that of
the Democratic Steering Committee. Will
they all act with Senator Goebel in the
matter of the repeal bill?

A BARON AT BRIDEWELL.
International Trouble Threatened
by the Imprisonment, of
a Hungarian.
Sent to the House of Correction for
Battling With Chicago
Policemen. â¢
CHTCAGO, 111., Feb. I.â Mark L.
Crawford, Superintendent of the House of
Correction, is at present entertaining a
real Hungarian Baron. The Baron is no
less a personage than Sigmund yon Mi
nulka, in whose veins courses the blue
blood of the Hungarian monarchy.
Crawford's entertainment of the Baron is
not a social event, as Baron Mihalka's
stay at the Bridewell is one of compulsion,
until he has worked out a $25 fine imposed
by Justice Clark of Hyde Park. It is
thought that the nobleman will be a guest
at tne institution for sixty-two days.
The Baron's detention at the workhouse
was caused by his interference with Police
men Burns and Breen of the Hyde Park
station, who were serving a search war
rant for a valuable otter hound lost by
Morrison, an architect. Morrison lives at
Fifty-third street and Kirn bark avenue.
On Tuesday Mrs. Morrison was told that
the animal, known as Jumbo, was being
kept in a flat building at 578 East Fifty
fifth street. She went to that number and
upon making inquiries found that Jumbo
was in a flat occupied by Baron Mihalka.
When Mrs. Morrison demanded the re
lease of her dog the Baron is alleged to
have demanded a reward, and when Mrs.
Morrison refused to make the proposed
settlement, it is claimed, he shut the door
violently in her face.
When Officer Burns displayed a search
warrant Mibalka, it is said, attempted to
close the door in Bums 1 face. A struggle
ensued, in which two policemen, Mihalka
and two women were considerably "mixed
ud for several minutes. The Baron, it is
said, nearly succeeded in tossing Officer
Breen over the railing of the third floor,
and it was only by using force that he was
taken to the Hyde Park station, where he
was later in the day released on bonds.
Mihalka failed to appear and his bonds
were forfeited and a fine of $25 wasim-.
posed upon charges of interfering with
and resisting an officer.
The Baron came to court a few minutes
later, and refusing to pay the- fine, he was
taken to the Bridewell. Mrs. Mihalka
went before Mayor Swift yesterday and
threatened to invoke the aid of the Aus
trian Consul if he did not make an imme
diate investigation of the case and release
her husband. Captain Aidricii was di
rected by the Mayor to bring his two offi
ceFS and all witnesses to his otiice at 2
o'clock, and at that time Mrs. Milhalka
with several witnesses and an attorney
presented themselves at the Mayor's office.
Attorney C. T. Butcher made a formal
demand that the Mayor Should take im
mediate action, ana after a lengthy argu
ment said he would give the officials
fifteen minutes in which to decide what
tuey were going to do. Before the expira
tion of the time, however, tne Mayor
ordered the ptficers to return to their
station, and then gave the attorney to un
derstand that he would take no action of
any kind. Mrs. Mihalka -now threatens to
have the two officers who arrested her
husband arrested on several charges, the
nature of which she refuses to divulge.

ances of $100,000,000 4-per-cent bonds to
take up the Government lien and all other
obligations for the company.
He gave . in detail the amounts of the
different mortgages on the company's
property end their relation to the debt due
to the Government, and Baid the reorgani
zation committee would either make a
proposition to the Government for a set
tlement of the debt or that the offer might
first come from tb.6 Government.
To a qnestion by Frye whether the pro
posed issue of $100,000,000 bond 3 fairjy rep
resented the value of the property owned
by the Union Pacific road Pierce replied in
the affirmative. Frye asked whether if
the bonds were amply secured the com
pany cpuld not pay the Government the
amount in cash, selling the bonds for that
purpose, .bat Mr. Pierce replied that they
would probably not be worth par in the
open market, but might ranee at from 80
to 90, while in the lone run they would be
worth par ana the Government would- re
ceive all that they represented.
Frye asked whether there was a bill
pending which covered the proposition.
Pierce said there was not. What he pre
sented was the plan of reorganization. He
represented the reorganization commit
tee.
Tweed, counsel for the Central Pacific
Railroad Company, stated the financial
and other conditions of that company as
differing essentially from those on the
Union Pacific, inasmuch as the Central
Pacific was a "going" road with the inter
est on its mortgages paid as it falls due
and with no floating debt. He presented
figures to show that the company could
pay the sixty millions, principal and in
terest due the Government, on an exten
sion of the debt for fifty years at 2 percent.
Collis P. Huntington, president of the
Central Pacific, said that he would prefer
to defer the statement which he desired to
make until the committee's next meeting,
showing that the Central Pacific was a
little better off than it appeared to be.
"Tbat willbe very agreeable news to the
committee," said Frye. The Senator also
added pleasantly, "They do say that you
have paid large sums of money to Sutro to
tempt him to stop these attacks in the
press. Is there any truth in that?"
Huntington replied that Sutro asked
him. to lunch at his place one day ; that he
told him he wanted to build a road from
San Francisco to his place, about eight
r iles, that he (Huntington) said he could
not do it then, but would some time; that
then Sutro said: "I am going to fight
you," and that Huntington replied, "Com
mence your fight now, d^ you," and got
up from the table and went away.
The case of tbe Sioux City and Pacific
Railroad, now owned by the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad, was presented by
David T. Little of Springfield, 111., who
advocated the passage of a bill to appoint
a commission whose findings shall be
binding on both the Government and the
company.
The hearing was adjourned until next

Hainer (R.) of Nebraska, and pending that
the House adjourned till Monday.
In the first hour of the session the fol

ACCESSION OF FORMOSA.
Japan Declares the Island to Be
Open to Home and Foreign
Commerce.
The United States to Establish Consular
Agencies at the New
Ports.
. .
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 1,-The
Japanese Minister to-day communicated
to the Secretary of State the following
cablegram whicn bad just been received
from the Imperial Government at Tokio,
and which is intended as the formal de
claration on the part of Japan to the
treaty powers of the accession of Formosa
and the opening of the island to foreign
commerce:
"Order and tranquillity having been es
tablished id Formosa, the Japanese Gov
ernment grants the followine privileges
and facilities to the subjects, citizens and
vessels of treaty powers being in or resort
ing to Formosa :
"1. The subjects and citizens of powers i
having commercial treaties with Japan
may reside and trade in Formosa at
Tamsui, Keejung, Anping, Taiwanfu and
Takaio, and the vessels of such powers
may visit and carry cargoes to and from
the ports and harbors of Tamsui, Keelung,
Anping, Taiwanfu and Takaio.
"2. Notwithstanding the exceptional
condition of affairs in Formosa, the. treat
ies of commerce and navigation and the
tariffs and arrangements existing and now
in force between Japan and other powers
are, so far as they are applicable, extended
to the subjects, citizens and vessels of
such powers being in or resorting to For
mosa, it being at the same time under
stood that all persons availing themselves
of .thÂ« above enumerated facitities shall
obey all decrees and regulations which
may at any time be in force in Formosa."
This notice, which is practically . an
imperial proclamation, makes the ne wly
acquired island as free to foreign trade as
any portion of Japan. As now issued, the
final provision is similar to the saving
clause usually inserted in such decrees,
and is chiefly significant in that under it
no extra-territorial jurisdiction is contem
plated.

lish consular agencies at the new open
ports. has already been made

SANTA FE RETRENCHMENT
Its Freight Offices in Half a

Grinding the Ax for the Decapita

â  Officials.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 1.-Orders were
issued to-day by President Itipley of the
Atchison, Topeka* and- Santa Fe Railroad
system to close the freight offices of that
company in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Min
neapolis, Omaha, Buffalo and Quincy, 111.
All the employes in these offices will re
ceive notice that their services are no
longer required by the company, with the
exception of the agent at Philadelphia,
who is transferred to New York.
President Ripley and his associates in
the new management of the Santa Fe
were convinced, on investigation, that the
business done from these offices was not
sufficient to warrant their continuance. in
furtherance of the present policy of re
trenchment. There have been numerous
reports and rumors since the first of tne
year that important changes and reduc
tions would %c ordered from headquarters
in the course of a month.
President Ripley left Chicago to-day to
be absent three or four weeks, and there is
some uneasiness at the general offices here
as to what officials are to be dropped, the
common report in railroad circles being
that the ax is being sharpened for such a
purpose. It is understood that other out
side freight offices are also to be abolished.

SILVER WINS
IN THE SENATE
Passage of the Substitute
for the House Bond
Bill.
FORCED TO FINAL VOTE.
Many Amendments Offered and
Argued,, but Quickly De-
COINAGE OF THE SEIGNIORAGE
â  â  â¢
The Measure Will Now Go Back
to the House for Con*
currence.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 1.-The
16ng struggle in the Senate over the ques-.
tion of the free coinage of silver termi
nated at 3 p. m. to-day in a victory for the
friends of silver. At 2 o'clock the discus
sion was closed.
Prior to that, however; Morrill (K.) of
Vermont bad offered an amendment Te
serving to the Government the seigniorage
on the silver coined and the Senate had
rejected it. Gorman (D.) of Maryland
had also moved to lay the substitute on
the table and that raoiion was defeated.
Thencame the concluding vote of 43 to 34,
and the bill thus amended passed by a
vote of 42 to 35. It* title was changed so
as to make it read, "To restore the coinage
of silver dollars and for other purposes."
All sections of the House bill are now
struck out. The bill now goes to the
House for concurrence in the substitute.
When the Senate, met at 11 o'clock this
morning, after taking a recess from 10
o'clock last evening, the attendance of
Senators was rather slim, there being per
haps twenty present.
The Vice-President laid before the Sen
ate a deficiency estimate of $?0,000 by the
Secretary of the Navy for the equipment
outfit of vessels for the navy already au
thorized.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska introduced a
bill to reduce public expenditures and for
other purposes^ which was referred to the
Finance Committee.
Morrili(R.) of Vermont, chairman of
the Finance Committee, then addressed
the Sen,ate in opposition to the free coin
age substitute report by that committee
for the House bond bill. The United
States, said Morrill, had beeu the friend of
silver to its own hurt, and he continued:
fit the late investments of nearly $500,
--000,000 in Bilver had been notoriously im
provident and unprofitable, the disastrous
results will appear as a drop in a bucket
when compared with what must flow from
the enormity of the present proposal, which
is to open all our mints to the free coinage,
not only of our own silver product, , but
that also of all the world, excluding nobody
from Dan to Beersbeba, and to tempt a
great increase in the annual product both
at home and abroad by offering United
States obligations for it at double the sum
it now commands in any other market."
Morrill said there were some gentlemen
who confidently predicted the overthrow
of the gold standard party as though that
would insure- the enthronement of the sil
ver standard party. He was not aware of
a single gold standard party in America,
but there is, he said, a large partyâ the
Republican partyâ in excellent health,
which proposes to maintain both gold, and
silver in circulation aud to keep both
metals in good health.
The Republican party, he declared, will
at its earliest opportunity seek the co
operation of the leading nations in the
coinage .of silver, and will in the mean
time aim to maintain the integrity of busi
ness affairs and the honor of the country
by the maintenance of every dollar of
money in the hands of the people without
depreciation at its full face value. Morrill
concluded his speech at 11:45.
Teller (R.) of Colorado replied to the
assertion of Morrill that silver was being
mined at a ridiculously low cost. He
maintained that cold and silver were to-
Sboth being mined at 25 cents an ounce,
had ample testimony to show that
had been mined at from 10 cents to
$3 au ounce, and it was unfair to say that
silver was a cheap metal.
Discussion proceeding under the five
minute rule, Daniel (D.) of Virginia op
posed the amendment proposed by Butler
(P.) of North Carolina, requiring the Sec
retary-of the Treasury to pay out either
gold or silver as the case may require when
the two metals were not at a parity as one
that was impracticable.
Gray (D.) of Delaware said that the
practical effect of such an amendment
would be equivalent to a declaration that
the Government was bound to cheat the
holders of its obligations if it could.
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky held that the
proposed amendment was contrary to the
very principle on which the friends of
free coinage based their claims.
Senators Jones, Harris, Teller and Du
bois urged that the substitute be passed
without amendment, and Butler (Pop.) of
North Carolina urged the adoption of his
amendment.
Cockrell (D.) of Missonri asserted that
there had never been any greater obstacle
to securing free coinage than the efforts oi
those who always wanted more than it
was possible to get. A free-coinage bill
was now possible, and Cockrell hoped it
would pass without amendment. Allen,
Butler, Peffer and Stewart (all Populists)
favored Butler's amendment.
Butler's amendment was defeated, 13 to
'60, as follows:
Ayes'â Allen, Brown, Butler, Cameron,
Cannon, George, Hill, Kyle, Peffer, Roach,

Butler's amendment sought to prohibit
any future issue of bonds, and required
payment of silver in redeeming United
j States notes when that metal is worth less
I Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska offered an
amendment depriving the Secretary of the
Treasury of the power to issue bonds
without the prior authority of Congress.
White (D.) of California thought it
unwise to unload the measure' with "Greek
amendments:" Gifts of that character
might result in the defeat of the sub
stitute.
Allen's amendment prohibiting the
future iasue of bonds without Congress
having declared the necessity therefor,
was defeated by a vote of 21 ayes and 54
noes, as follows :
Ayesâ Allen, Bacon, Baker, Berry,

Morrili (E.) of Vermont, offered an
amendment, providing tbat the seignior
aee equal to the difference between the
coinage and the commercial value of the
silver shall be retained by the -United
States. This was so fair a proposition, he
said, that be believed it would be agreed to
Gorman recalled the appeal of the Pr<Â» *.
dent to Congress to remain here dm og
Ihe holidays and construct a measure or
the relic* of the treasury. The ' Senate
Committee, hostile to the relief, had re
ported in favor of the unlimited coinage of
silver. It was, he said, impossible to have
this substitute become a law prior at least
to March 4, 1897. It could and would not
receive the sanction of the President.
Under tne conditions existing in.the Sen
ate the friends of free coinage could not
agree upon any proposition. He therefore
moved that the amendment offered by the
Committee on Finance be laid upon the
table.
It was defeated by a vote* of 43 to 34, as
follows:
Ayesâ Allison, Baker, Burrows, Caffrey,
Chandler, Davis, Elkins, Faulkner, Frye,

At 12:20 Baker (R.) of Kansas desired to
offer his amendment limiting the coinage
lo the America* product, and Lodce (R. )
of Massachusetts his amendment provid
ing for a $100,000,000 loan for coast de
fenses.
Cockrell (D.) of Missouri and Harris (D.)
of Tennessee insisted that the agreement
stipulated the final vote on the substitute
should be taken at 2 o'clock. A parlia
mentary wrangle then followed.
Various amendments were withdrawn
and the final vote on committee amend
ments was proceeded with.
The committee amendments prevailed
by a vote of 43 to 34. The vote was as fol
lows:
Ayesâ AUen, Bacon, Bate, Berry,

So the free coinage substitute was
agreed to.
Lodge, when the bill was taken from the
committee of the whole to the Senate, of
fered his amendment providing for the
issue of $100,000,000 of bonds for a coast de
fense loan. Teller moved to lay the
amendment on the table and that mo

TATTEESALL'S HOT SUITABLE.
Decision on the Merits of the Two
Buildings Made on the Question
of Accommodations.
CHICAGO, 111.. Feb. I.â The next
Democratic nominee for the Presidency
wijl be named in the Colliseum at Sixty
third street and Jackson Park. This was
the decision of the sub-committee of the
National Democratic Committee this even
ing after an executive session of over four
hours, and it means that an audience of
not less than 15,000 will be afforded an op
portunity of greeting with acclaim the
same of the successful candidate.
It was also decided to locate the head
quarters of the National Committee at the
Palmer House. There was an informal
discussion on the appointment of a ser
geant-at-arms, the only names mentioned
being John S. Cooper, president of the
Cook County Democracy, and Elijah
Brooks of Indiana. It was agreed, how
ever, that no definite selection should be
made until the rrext meeting of the sub
committee, which will be held in this city
upon a future date to be selected by Na
tional Chairman Harrity.
The members of the committee spent
the morning in an inspection of the Col
liseum, which is still in course of construc
tion, but under contract to be completed
by May 1. and of Tattersall's, the only
â¢>ther auditorium that has been submitted
for its consideration. No attempt was
made by the local committee to influence
the Nati-onal cemmitteeraen in reaching
a conclusion between the two buildings.
"When the party was at the Colliseum there
was some hesitdncy in expressing a favor
able opinion on account of its distance
iroiu the center of the city, while fears
were expressed that the close proximity
of the main line of the Illinois Central, the
tracks of which are also used by the Michi
gan Central, -and other roads, might tend
to create a din that would be embarrassing
to orators or interfere with the rollcalls.
The committeemen were assured, how
ever, that the railroad officials would put
a veto on the tooting, of engine whistles
in the vicinity, and that tbe noise of the
runnin E trains would not penetrate within
the structure.
In some particulars the sub-committee
men were favorably impressed with Tat
tersall's. but there were strong doubts as

to its ability to hold anything like the 15,
--000 people for whom tne managers claimed |
they could make provision. It was ad
mitted by the engineers of the structure
that not more than 7500 people could be
seated on the ground floor, but it was
claimed that safe galleries could be erected
in which an equal number might be ac
commodated.
When the committee went into execu
tive session, extra blue prints of the inte
rior of Tattersall's under the proposed ar
rangement were sent for, and it looked for
a while as though the Uolliseum was in
disfavor.
The decision hinged solely on the ques
tion of accommodations, and, after the
matter had been thoroughly canvassed
and representatives of both structures
called in to explain dispuped points, it
was decided by a unanimous vote to accept
the offer of the Colliseum.
In announcing this action to President
Dickinson of the company owning the
structure, Chairman Harrlty stated ex
plicitly that the committee had decided to
require seating accommodations for 15,000
people. The Colliseum people had pre
viously shown that the interior of their
structure could be so arranged as to pro
vide for 20,000 without crowding, but the
committee was of the opinion that 15,000
was the safest figure as a maximum.
SENATOR CULLOM WILLING.
Ready for the Presidential Xomination if
It Is Tendered.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. I.â Senator Shelby
M. Cullom departed for Washington this
evening, and left behind an understanding
with the Republican party leaders in Cools.
County as to his position as a Presidential
candidate. He tola all whom he conferred
with that he would : 'be pleased to have the
support of the Illinois delegation in the
convention," which admission is consid
ered by thc-party men as a declaration of
a "receptive candidate," such as Benjamin
Harrison is said to be by his friends.
Senator Cullom intimated to his party
associates that he disapproved of any
statesman seeking the Presidential nomi
nation, and preferred not to publicly an
nounce himself as. a candidate for the
honor. Prominent Republicans did hot
speak enthusiastically of the senior Sena
tor as a Presidential possibility, but re
garded him as the foremost Republican
from Illinois in public life and, naturally,
the favorite son, who would be a good card
for the Illinois delegation to hjld np their
sleeves to play as a contingency.
BROTHER ERWIN DEMANDS A SHARE
Objects to the Compromise Settlement Made
in the Vast Estate of A. J.
Davis.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. Lâ A bill Vas filed
in the Federal Court here this morning by
Erwin Davisof New York, a brother of A. J.
Davis, the multi-millionaire whose fortune
has been contested for in the courts of
Montana several years on account of the
will, which it was alleged was a forgery.
Last March the children of John A. Davis,
a brother of tbe deceased, agreed to a com
promise settlement with their combative
cousins and other relatives who contested
the will, and a.division of the vast estate
was decreed by the court. John A. Davis
had died during the litigation.
Now Erwin, another brother, attacks the
compromise, which left him and his
brother Calvin and his sisters out of the
settlement. He exhibits a copy of an
agreement sighed by all the brothers and
sisters of the deceased that half of the
money received should be given to Erwin
-in consideration of his furnishing the
money to fight tbe claims of Mrs. Bagett's
children.

COMPLICATIONS
IN THE TRANSVAAL
An American Consul to Be
Sent to the Cape Town
Vacancy.
MR. OLNEY IS RETICENT.
The Secretary Will Not Speak of
Independent Action in Behalf
of Hammond.
KNIGHT NOW AFTER MANYON.
Violated Consular Regulations in
Cabling Direct to the State
Department
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. I.â ln view
of the complications in the Transvaal
arising out of the arrest of American citi
zens there, the President will soon appoint
a Consul at Cape Town to fill the vacancy
there, which has existed since Charles H.
Benedict of Minnesota died some months
ago. The present Vice-Consul and Acting
Consul, Mr. Knight, is an Englishman,
born in the colony.
President Cleveland and Secretary Olney
have the matter of the appointment of a
Consul under consideration, and may be
expected to decide very soon.'
Secretary Olney declined to say any
thing to-day about the news from Johan
nesburg that he had cabled a declaration
to the effect that the United States would
act independently of England in seeking
a settlement in the case Of Hammond and
the other Americans arrested. Whether
or not Mr. Olney has sent such a dispatch
he will undoubtedly adhere to that posi
tion whic.h has been the consistent policy
of the administration.
Secretary Olney also declined to be seen
with reference to the statement that Vice-
Consul Knight of Cape Town had threat
ened to suspend Mr. Manyon, pur con
sular agent at Johannesburg, for com
municating directly with Secretary Olney
instead of through Mr. Knight, his imme
diate superior. As a matter of fact, Mr.
Monyon did violate a consular regulation
in cabling directly to Secretary Olney, but
he had the excuse that Mr. Olney, who
has little regard for red tape, sent .him di
rectly a cable that did not pass through
Mr. Knight's bands. Mr. Manyon is a na
tive of New York, though he was ap
pointed consular agent as a resident of
South Africa.
CHICAGO WHEAT ADVANCE^.
Considerable Excitement Among .&pecu~
lators in the Pit.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. I.â Another ex
cited and upgrade wheat market was ad
ded to-day to tue list of those which have
made trading sensational during: the last
two weeks. The price started with a jump
of 1% cents and at the end of the session
a rise of 2% cents had been recorded for
the day. The opening of the market was
a surprise to the trade and set the pit in a
ferment. Yesterday the closing price was
66 for May and when bu&iness began to
day a wild shout went up for it at 66%
cents to ffiH cents. The ostensible reason
for the unexpected advance was Liverpool
sending quotations. showing a big advance
in the face of a decline for the day before.
Armour was a heavy open seller, both on
the first and second advance, the market
receding in forty minutes to 66}-g cents be
fore it took a whirl again to 67.
CENSURE FOR MR. BAYARD
Two Resolutions Reported by the
House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
Adopted by a Strict Party Vote, With
the Exception of Newlands of
Nevada.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Feb. I.â A reso
lution censuring Embassador Bayard for
the sentiments expressed by him in his
recent English speeches was. adopted by
the House Foreign Affairs Committee this
afternoon. Two resolutions were re
ported.
The first censures Mr. Bayard by name
for the language used by him in his Bos
ton and Edinburgh speeches, and incorpo
rated with this will be a second resolution
expressing the disapproval of the com
mittee of our representatives abroad dis
cussing American political affairs and dis
playing partisanship and the condemna
tion of political parties or other reputable
organizations-of American citizens.
This conclusion was not reached until
the entire subject of Mr. Bayard's alleged
indiscretions had been fnliy discussed by
the committee. The discussion was pre
cipitated by the calling up by Chairman
Hitt of the foregoing resolutions, which
were prepared respectively by Pearson of
North Carolina and Cousina of lowa.
Party lines were at once strictly drawn, the
â Democrats opposing the cen â c of Em
bassador Bayard, while the Republicans
insisted that his offense deserved a rebuke
from the American Congress.
McCreary of Kentucky and Money of
Mississippi championed Mr. Bayard's
cause. The Democratic leaders refused to
agree to any proposition which might re
liect upon our Embassador at London,
whereupon the Republicans decided that
the two resolutions above referred to
should be agreed to.
The resolutions were adopted by a strict
party vote, with the exception that New
lands of Nevada, a representative of the
silver party, joined the Republicans,
while the Democrats unanimously opposed
them. All the members of the committee
were present except Draper (R.) of Massa
chusetts.
Chairman Hitt will present the resolu
tions with a majority report to the House
on Monday. A report embodying the
views of the minority will probably be
submitted by Dinsmore of Arkansas.
Chairman Hitt declines to make public
the text of the resolutions.
The preamble of the first resolution re
cites the language used in both speeches,
and condemns Embassador Bayard for its
use. The tenor of the second resolution
does not differ from that outlined above.
It is said to take tne form of a rule of con
duct for embassadors and other represen
tatives abroad, reaffirming in stronger
language the rules in vogue at the State
Department during the period that Mr.
Bayard filled the office of Secretary.
UNREST IN THE
GERMAN CABINET.
Rumors Continue to Float
of Resignations of .
Ministers.
THE CRISIS POSTPONED.
But There Is a Prospect t)f Further
Trouble in Increasing Credits
for the Navy.
HONOR TO THE LATE DIPLOMAT
Emperor William Sent a Big Army
Detail to Embassador Runyon's
Funeral.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. I.â The rumors
which have been in circulation here of the
impending resignation of Prince yon Ho
henlohe, the Imperial Chancellor; Herr
yon Boetticher, Minister of the Imperial
Home Office and representative of the
Chancellor, and Herr Hollman, the head
of the Imperial Admiralty, have been
traced to journalists who claim connection
with. high official sources of information.
The rumors, of course, created a great stir
until they were semi-officially denied,
when the interest they had awakened sub
sided. If 'there is nothing behind these
reports the Government officials have had
themselves to blame for the circulation in
choosing as mediums of spreading in
formation upon previous occasions men
whom they are now obliged to repudiate.
In spite of these officially inspired
denials, however, some responsible news
papers persist in the assertion that a
ministerial crisis is merely postponed. In
support of this contention the Neve
Nachrichten recalls the circumstances that
the late Chancellor, General yon Caprivi,
upon the eve of his dismissal from office
received orders from the Emperor to
assure the Ministers of the several federal
states that the then current stories of a
Ministerial crisis, were positively without
foundation. Nevertheless General Caprivi
was relieved withrn a very few days there
after.
The Hanover Courier insists that a crisis
is latent, the Emperor persisting in his
notion of asking the Reichstag for a large
increase of naval credits for the construc
tion of additional warships, etc., which
Prince Hohenlohe ha 3 declared to be
impossible.
Within the ministerial circle. Prince
Hohenlohe is credited with having taken
a more hopeful view regarding the voting
of "increased navai credits by the Reich
stag, assuming that he is able to manage
a coalition of the Conservatives and Agra
rians or the National Liberals and Agra
rians. The chief difficulty in' the way of
such a combination, however, is the fact
that since the defeat of the.Kanitz grain
monopoly proposal the majority in the
Reichstag is bitterly hostile to the Minis
ters.

reconcile the situation, and has chosen the
Unterhaus as the scene of its first ap
i proaches- to an entente. Herren Heyde
brandt and Strachtwitz, Agrarian mem
bers of the Unterhaus, having declared
that Count Kanitz's proposal had taken
second place, the monetary question com
ing, first. Herron yon Puttkamer and
Plauth., Conservatives, next declared that
such a decision in regard to the legislative
programme ought in no wise to separate a
party from the Government.
Then Baron yon Hammerstein-Loxlen,
Minister of Agriculture, following his
cue, assured the Agrarians that the Gov
ernment was in no respect hostile to them.
Chancellor Hohenlohe watched his best
chance for a deal in furtherance of the
Government's monetary scheme for naval
purposes, and seized the opportunity to
say that he bad always regarded the
Agrarians &r, the proper representatives of
the agricultural interests of the country,
and more in the same vein. A further ex
change of courtesies of this character fol
lowed, and the whole proceeding is held
in ministerial circles to corroborate their
contention that a project is on foot looking
to a coalition with a view of securing the
desired navy credits.
The public are clearly indifferent to the
matter of constructing new warships, as
evidenced by the fact that the movement
in favor of calling for a large public sub
scription for the purpose of building
cruisers has collapsed, the total sum col
lected in weeks having been insufficient to
pay the expenses of the required agitation.
Dr. Stoecker, formerly court chaplain,
has resigned his membership in the Con
servative party owing to the opposition
caused by bis refusal to declare himself
against the Christian socialist movement.
The Colonial Council is discussing a new
emigration law, which proposes that all
emigration from Germany shall be state
directed. The aim is to regulate emigra
tion so that the main stream thereof shall
be guided to the German colonies instead
foreign countries.
The Emperor has again offered to confer
upon Dr. Miquel, Prussian Minister of
Finance, a hereditary barony, bat the doc
tor has declined the dignity upon the
ground that he is not sufficiently wealthy
to support the dignity and title after he
shall cease to be in office.
Concerning his refusal the Voerwaerts,
the socialist organ, maliciously remarks
that Dr. Marquel refused the barony be
cause he was afraid to face the disclosure
of letters which, when he was a young
man, he wrote to the socialist agitators,
Marx and Engel, denouncing the nobility.
The Emperor paid a special honor to the
late Embassador Kunyon by sending six
teen officers, drawn from each regiment of
the guards now in Berlin, to the memorial
service, held in St. George's Episcopal
Church, all of whom were attired in pa
rade uniform.
This distinction corresponds with the
usage in Germ any at the obsequies of brig
adier-generals who have served in actual
war. Mrs. Runyon is rapidly recovering
from the shock caused by her husband's
sudden death. It is the intention of the
members of the family to give her a change
of scene and she will shortly go to Dresden
and Wiesbaden.
Robert T. Kneebs, the American trotting
horse owner, who is in prison here under
the conviction of having started a "ring
er" on the Berlin and other German tracks,
has offered a large amount of bail for his
release pending the hearing of his appeal
against bis conviction, but the Judge to
whom the application was made refused,
and told the lawyer who applied that he
would not let Kneebs out of piison if he
furnished $100,000 bail.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Feb. I.â Senator
White writes as follows to President Morse
of the Chamber of (ioinraerce regarding
the defenses of San Diego harbor:
Washington, D. C, Jan. 26, 1896.
Philip Morse K*q., President Chamber of Com
merce, San Diego, CaVâHy Dear Sir: Yours of
the 18th met. received. I note what you say
regarding the construction of proper harbor
defenses at tan Diego. The officers here are
fully informed with reference to this matter,
and San Diego is one of the places named in
the bill now before Congress, and which is
being investigated by the Committee on Coast
Defenses, of which I am a member, as to the
proper places for effective fortifications. If
tne bill passe 3at all, San Diego will be in
cluded.
It is entirely impossible to select one plac
and legislate for it. There is absolutely r
chance of .passing a bill for San Diego alon
If we inaugurate a fight of that kind, th
larger places will come in, and we will prob
bly be omitted altogether. Our plan is to joi
our fortunes in one comprehensive andgenei
I rogramine for the proper guarding of thepri
cipal harbor? of the United States.
The only two plates in California for whie
extensive work is recommended in Jhis regar
are San Diego end San Kraneiseo'. There ar
a number of place>, including four or five
leading points on the east coast, where lands
have been donated under the same conditions
specified in the deed, a copy of which you iv-
ClOGÂ£.
Nothing special is being done at these points
regarding tne coast defenses, and they are
waitine, just as San Diego is waiting, for an
appropriation. .The late war talk has doubt
less resulted in awakening the country to its
defenseiessness, and 1 hope we will be able to
get the bill through. I certainly am heartily
in favor of it, and will, it Is needless to fay, do
everything in my power to protect Sau Diego
It must be remembered that the great busi
ness centers of the East are practically defense
less. I see nothing adequate to prevent the
bombardment of New York, Philadelphia, Bos
ton, Baltimore, etc. Yours, very truly.

SANTA ROSA STRIFE.
Wesley Mock Says He Will Thrash the Per
son Who Impugns His Motives
in the Water Suits.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. I.â The legal
battle over the construction of the new
water works goes merrily on. The plain
tiff's attorneys have made some sensa
tional moves in the course of the litiga
tion, while the defendants have contented
themselves with purely defensive tactics.
But it is now declared by some of the
most prominent persons connected with
the defense that from now on the city will
assume the aggressive.
In an interview recently had with the
plaintiff, Mr. Mock said to a Call repre
sentative: "I am acting in my private ca
pacity as a citizen for the good of the com
munity and am not the tool of a corpora
tion, as has been stated." Mr. Mock
further said he did not propose to be
tailed a "tool" and would inflict personal
chastisement upon the first person who
applied this epithet to him.
In an affidavit filed yesterday Attorney
Lynch declared that Mock had been re
fused permission to inspect certain docu
ments on file in the olfice of the City Clerk,
and asked the conrt for an order compel
ling City Clerk Mobley to allow plaintiff's
attorney and assistants to ir.ake photo
graphic copies of tne bids cf Robert Effey
ana Garratt & Co., which are alleged by
Mock to be in the same handwriting. Upon
this showing Judge Daiatrerfield ordered
tiiat C. L. Mobley and the Mayor and
Common Council of this city show cause
before him on February 2 why an order
should not be made requiring them to give
the plaintiff and his attorneys an opportu
nity to inspect and photograph the* bids of
Eobert Effey and Garratt & Co.

Money and Jncelry Stolen by a Chinese
Servant in a Hotel.
OROVILLE, Cal., Feb. 1. â John
Hussey, a guest of the United States
Hotel, when eating breakfast yester
day, remembered having left $200 under his
pillow. He hurried to his room and found
a Chinese servant coining out of the door.
Discovering that the money was missing
he accused the Chinaman of stealing it,
and later swore out a warrant for the
Mongol's arrest.
Search was made, but the money could
not be found, but in the Chinaman's trunk
there were found a diamond ring and gold

OORFA'S SECOND MASSACRE.
There Was Great Loss of Life, Destruction
of Property and Thousands
Made Destitute.
BOSTON, Mass.. Feb. I.â The following
letter from Oorfa, Central Turkey, dated
Tuesday night, December 31, gives an ac
count of new massacres:
"We have had our second massacre and
most terrible this time in the destruction
of life as well as property. It began Sat
urday noon, December 28, and continued
all day Sunday. Special efforts were made
for my safety, for which I am grateful, as
some 240 came under the shadow of my
Lome and were spared, and because I can
serve to some extent the suffering.
"Thousands are hungry in our city. I
wish I could represent it and the need of
i all possible aid. With winter upon us it
iis appalling. Our pastor is buried, with
j many of his congregation, in the usual
order of things. He leaves orphans. A
delegation of prominent citizens paraded
the city, led by martial mnsic, near the
closing scenes. . .
"Before night two camel loads of bed
ding were secured and promise of more to
morrow, with some grain prepared for
ordinary food.
"A calm, late effort at estimating the
loss of property by the first affair here was
$660,000, and that was chiefly shops.
"All homes are now emptied, almost lit
erally to, and the loss of life is sufficient to
satisfy for their previous 'deficiency' in
that line, which caused great regret as
they heard from other cities. It cannot be
told, yet I long for wings and power to
portray it till it burns into the soula of
early Christian nations. Gregorians suf
fered much damage."

LEGAL BATTLES OF
SANTA CRUZ EDITORS.
Warring Newspaper Men Are
Now Waging Their Strife
in Court.
DUNCAN M'PHEBSON'S VICTORY
Appears as His Own Attorney and
Is Found Not Guilty of
Wrong-Doing.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. I.â Editor
Duncan McPherson was acquitted of the
charge of disturbing the peace this morn
ing in Judge Gardner's court. Mr. Mc-
Pherson personally conducted his defense
ana as he waived the right to a jury the
trial was brief.
Many witnesses.who saw part of the strug
gle between Mcl'herson and Wright, were
examined, but no one was found who had
the hsfrdihood to acknowledge that the
row disturbed his peace. On the contrary,
the testimony rather showed that the
crowd enjoyed the fight. It was shown
that the fight was carried on from the
sidewalk to the middle of the street, and
that Expert Wright stumbled, and grab
bing Mr. McPherson's beard drew him
into the mire with him, and the opponents
were found struggling in this position
when arrested.
Editor McPherson's whiskers received a
great deal of attention from the specta
tors, as they figured prominently in all the
testimony and croESrexaminatipn. The
whiskers were badly mutilated; a Pa
checo pass rah up the center, the hairs of
which are highly treasured by several
young men ahout town. After the Dis
trict Attorney placed all his witnesses on
the stand Mr. McPherson arose and
calmly and thoughtfully gave His version
of the fight:
"I was walking down Pacific avenue. I
turned back. I heard a voice, 'McPherson,
McPherson.' It was apparently a friendly
voice. I turned around. There was J. L.
Wright. He approached me. He ob
jected m strictures on the expert's report
in that morning's paper. I said I did not
have the paper with me. I did not want
to be cross-examined without my testi
mony. He called me a vile name many
times. I kept saying, 'That's all right,
that's all right.'
" 'Your paper is a blackmailing sheet,'
said he.
â¢"That's a lie,' said I.
" 'You are a blackmailer,' said he.
" 'You are a liar,' said I.
"He struck me a. wild blow. I struck
him in return. He grasped me by the
whiskers. I kept on striking him. He fell
either over the curb or from the force of
my blows, I know not which. I fell on
top of him. I fell on my knees and was
about to put my fist in his eye when we
were separated. If the court desires, I
will read from the Sentinel what Mr.
Wright referred to."
But his Honor assured the defendant he
was already conversant with the articlf.
Then Mr. McPherson desired to call Mr.
Wright as his witness, but the court in
formed him Mr. Wright could not be
found, as he bad gone hunting, and any
way he had the privilege of declining to
testify. So Mr. McPnerson closed his
case and Justice Gardner acquitted him.
.Wright's case is set for Wednesday.

any manufactuiing business on its own
account.
The Horseshoe Bend Vineyard has been
often described. It is a wonderfully fer
tile little oapis of alluvial soil that lies in
the middle of a wilderness of jimesal
covered mountains some four miles north
of Hunters Valley and about the same
distance south of the flourishing town of
Coulterville. It is in the very center of i
the best prospected part of this county,
and is an ideal situation for a central dis
tributing plant.
"Within easy distance from the Horse-
Bhoe Bend it would not be difficult to
enumerate a hundred mines that are suf
ficiently prospected to utilize cheap power
if they could pet it. Among the most
prominent are the Merced Gold Mining !
Company, with thirteen mines; the Crown
Lead, with five or six; the Cabinet group,
the Keystone croup. the Tyro, the Rob
erts mine. Maxwell & Cathay's Bonanza,
Red Banks, the Tom Brown mines, Bar
ter's mine, tue Virginia, Mrs. Camiasiona's
mine, Martini's mine, the Quail, Mrs.
Jeffery's Bird mine, James Lindsay's
No. 7 mine, the Alice Clark and Black
Geld, the Champion, Williams' mine,
Joyce mine; Captain A. H. "Ward's Pinon
Bianco group, comprising one and a half j
miles qn the great mother lode; the But
terfly, Rogers* mine, Peterson's mine,
Quartz Gulch mine, the McAlpine, a great
property on the mother lode, the Red
Cloud, the Louisiana, the Bower Cave
group, the Bandarita, with its 1368 feet of
tunnel, so straight that standing at the
inner end of it you can see the daylight;
the Martin & Walling mine, the Haslo,
Ollie Fisk'a mines and the Scanlon mine.
These are all on the north side and a list
equally long of well-prospected properties
in Hunters Valley and toward Hornitos
could be given. Every mine named is in
a position to use cheap power just as Boon
as it is available.
The water power is to be taken from the
Merced River &t a point about a mile above
the Horseshoe Bend. A favorable location
has been selected for the dam, which will
be thirty-five feet in height. At the bot
tom it will be twenty feet in length; at
twenty -five feet high it will be thirty feet
long, and on the top it will be sixty-five
feet long. The ditch and flume will have
a fail of ninety-three feet, equal to the
river's course of four miles around the
Horseshoe Bend. At the dryest Eeason
of the year the power company calculates
upon 10,000 miners' inches of water and
1800 horsepower. For eignt months in the
year the company expects water enough to
generate 3500 horsepower, and the ditch
and flume will be made sufficiently large
to carry the water.
The plant as arranged so far will consist
of three 500- horsepower generators three
generator switchboard panels, three ex
citing dynamos, four step-up and four
etep-dow n converters, one distributing
Bwitchboard panel, twenty-four miles of
No. 2 copper wire, weighing 31,200 pounds,
etc. There will also be a number of
motors, as the Bend Power Company un
dertakes to furnish motors to customers
who make contracts for any length of
lime.
The price the company proposes to
charge its customers is $5 per horsepower
a month. At the present time the expense
of producing steam is from $12 to $15 per
horsepower, and two years hence, at the
present rate of consumption of cordwood,
the hills would be bare of timber and
steam power, except in a few localities, at
a price almost prohibitive. If it be con
sidered that concerns using 100 horse
power will save $1000 a month, in itself no
mean profit, it can scarcely be wondered
that Mariposans to-day are jubilant over
the announcement that the Bend Power
Company is to break ground as the first
central distributing power plant on the
Merced river.
H. H. Clark, the general manager. of
the Horseshoe Bend vineyard, is the pro
moter of the Bend Power Company. In
the rapid development of Coultervile and
its neighborhood Mr. Clark has taken a
prominent part in every progressive move
ment having for its object the advance
ment of the district. While interested to
a moderate extent in mining, he has for a
long time past made up his mind that the
surest road to wealth was to provide the
power first with which to carry on
operations.
Wort will probably be begun in about
six weeks' time. The ditch and flume, the
buildings, the machinery and the laying
of wires to different points of consumption
can all be done before and during summer,
but it will be necessary to wait until the
Bnow-waters in the Merced abate about
October next before it is possible to build
the dam. When the river is low enough
the dam can be put into position in a
couple of weeks, and, everything else
being in readinress, the electric power can
be immediately turned on for consumers.
"Nearly forty years' residence in the
county of Mariposa," said Judge J. M.
Corcoran of the Superior Court to-day,
"has enabled me to speak understanding^
of her actual wants. I am thoroughly
convinced that there are hundreds of gold
bearing quartz veins within the county,
which cannot be profitably worked by
steam power, but could be worked with
good profit when a cheaper power is ob
tained."
This is the universal opinion and is
evinced by the special resolution in which
the Board of Supervisors went out of its
way to mark its sense of the importance of
the installation in Mariposa County of the
third largest electrical distributing power
plant in the United States of America.
-* SPOKANE SENSATION.

THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
Limit of a Sheriff's Authority as
Custodian Decided by
Justice Dwyer.
Edward Summersett Arrested for. Rob
bing His Brother-in-Law â Burg
lars Loot a Dwelling.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Feb. I.â Justice Dwyer
this morning rendered a decision in the
suit of A. M. McCabe against Sheriff Lyn
don and A. Secchi to recover $32 on an at
tachment belonging to Secchi and now in
the custody of the Sheriff, that establishes
the limit of authority of the Sheriff as a
custodian of the property of a person in
his charge.
Secchi was convicted in Justice Gass'
court of stealing a locket and sentenced to
serve 100 days in jail. Secchi had $32 on
his person when committed, and this he
delivered into the custody of the Sheriff.
McCabe subsequently brought a civil
suit against Secchi for the loss of the locket
and was awarded $90 damages. Sheriff
Lyndon refused to turn the money over to
McCabe, contending that he had become
the involuntary bailee of property of his
prisoners, and that the property was in
the hands of the law and not Bubject to
garnishment.
Justice Dwyer held that the Sheriff, who
made the rules himself by which he came
into possession of the property, and which
he could alter at his will, was only ah in
voluntary bailee, and the property was
not by reason of his possession in the
bands of the law, and ordered the Sheriff
to turn the money over to satisfy the judg
ment obtained by McCabe.

Pass Away After Years of Serv
ice at the Reins.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Feb. I.âRich
ard Doherty of Purissima, San Mateo
County, who died in San FrancifCO yester
day, was a native of Boston, ageu 62 years.
He was an old friend of A. Underbill of
Redwood City, and the two were drivers
on the Bowman & Gardner Omnibus line
of stages in Ban Francisco along in 1854-58,
when tne fare from the old City Hall plaza
to the Mission at Dolores and Sixteenth
streets was $1 each wav on Sundays, and
50 cents on weekdays. In 1858 Doherty
drove on the Omnibus line from the plaza
to Fort Pcint, in San Francisco.
For the last thirty years or bo Mr.
Doherty had lived in San Mateo County.
He owned the Pescadero House, which he
nfterward sold, and also the Purissima
House, which was his late home. At one
time he conducted the stage line between
Haifmoon Bay and San Mateo. Doherty's
place at Purissima has always been a
great resort for sportsmen from San Fran
cisco who come down to fish, hunt or
spend a vacation.
8. L. Knight, a veteran stage-driver, died
at his home at Woodside to-day, atred 68
years. "Sinie" Knight arrived in San
Francisco in 1852, and went to the mines in
Tuolnmne County. He came to San Mateo
County in 1853 nnd settled at Woodside
where he engaged in lumbering and other
pursuits. For ten or twelve years he was
Wells, Farpo & Co.'s agent at Redwood

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
I.â The boarders of Encina Hall, the
young men's dormitory, last night gave
their second reception and dinner to the
boarders of Roble, the co-eds' dormitory.
The affair proved fully as successful as its
predecessor, notwithstanding the fact that
no dancing was allowed.
The original plans were to have the din
ner followed by dancing, but the authori
ties would not consent to allow the wor
shiping at Terpsichore's shrine, tliough
heartily in favor of the dinner. For a
time it seemed that the movement had
been squelched. A meeting of the board
ers was called and several -speeches were
made to prove that no dinner could ever
be considered au fait without dancing to
"top off." "No dancing, no dinner and
no reception," seemed to be the motto
with a few, but there were others who
argued that mere childishness caused the
opposition to the dinner, and that the
evening might be made very satisfactory
by other methods than the one proposed,
so the dinner was given.
in addition to the hundred "co-eds"
present, there were nearly a score of
faculty members with their wives. The
following programme was given after the
banqnet:

READY TO BEGIN TRAINING.
Porty Athletes Who Aspire to Positions
on Stanford's Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
1. â In answer to the call of Track Captain
Toombs fully forty men appeared at the
gymnasium this morning and announced
themselves as ready to go into training
for the coming season.
There was a fair showing of new men,
but many vacant places were noticeable.
Copeland, who made the half mile last
year in 2:01 and won first place for Stan
ford, is not back. R. K. Culver '97, a good
all-round athlete, will not re-enter the
university this semester. Knowles '96, the
quarter-mile sprinter, has not returned to
Stanford this year. These and a few others
leave several important places to be rilled.
Captain Toombs says that he will besrin
work on his new material at once, and all
the athletes will go into training now,
though it will not be severe for some time.
Among tue likeliest new men to appear
are: Rollie Wilbur '99, who is strong in
the shot-put and is a hammer-thrower of
considerable ability; John Brunton '99,
excellent at the shorter sprints and devel
oping as a pole-vaulter; Holbrook '97, who
entered from the University of Michigan,
and is said to sprint well in the 100 yards.
It is expected that several other new
men may prove valuable, but as yet they
are unknown quantities and will require a
great deal of training. All the old athletes
are going in to make a good showing this
year, and Stanford feels that her field
record this season will be a credit at least.
SHASTA'S NEW RAILWAY.
The Iron Mountain Company Com
pletes Its Roadbed in That
County.
Plans for Another Line From Missouri
to California Are Being
Considered.
CHICO, Cal., Feb. I.â J. A. McLean, a
railroad contractor and builder, who has
just completed the roadway for the Iron
Mountain Railway in Shasta County, is in
this city.
In conversation with Mr. McLean a Call
representative questioned him regarding
railroad news, and about the first thing he
said was that be thought it would be but a
short time before a new railroad would
pass through the Sacramento Valley and
that Chico would, no doubt, be one of its
touching points.
Mr. McLean stated that plans are being
HORSE-SHOE BEND.
[From a photograph. J
considered to run another through rail
road from Missouri to California. The
Burlington and Missouri Railroad manage
ment has already constructed its road
from Missouri to Billings, Mont., and its
engineers are now in the field making sur
veys for a continuation of the road to the
coast. Mr. McLean does not know the
plans of the company, but he understands
its intentions to be to enter California
from the north and passing down the Sac
ramento touch the principal cities on the
route.
The population and natural advantages
of the lands on tiie eastern side of the
Sacramento River are far superior to those
on the west, and this the Burlington and
Missouri Company will take into consid
eration in building the road in this State.
In a short time, probably next July, the
surveyors will be througn Northern Cali
fornia. The company is following the line
ol the old Union Pacific survey, and Chico
is on this line. A surveyor was through
Chico a couple of years ago looking over
the proposed route, and the report he
made will no doubt be pretty closely fol
lowed when the survey is made through
this valley.
Mr. McLean thinks the road is sure to
come in the near future, and with the sub
division of ranches and colonization branch
roads are sure to follow and Northern Cali
fornia and Chico will treble m population
and wealth.
PORT TOWNSEND FIASCO.
Charge of Assault and Battery
Against Mrs. Scott Is
Dismissed.
The Domestic Who Swore Out the
Warrant of Arrest Fails to
Appear in Court.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. I.â ln
the police court to-day, as a result of the
failure of Miss Wilcox to appear, the
charge of assault and battery recently
made against Mrs. John N. Scott, a
prominent society leader of this city, was
dismissed.
Mrs. Scott's arrest, made by Captain
Furlong of the night police force, created
a sensation. The woman who swore out
the warrant was a domestic in the employ
of the Scott family, and according to the
story told by her at the time she was
brutally beaten and disfigured with a
piece ot stove wood in the nands of Mrs.
Scott. Soon after the alleged assault was
committed Miss Wilcox left town.
Unusual interest has attached to the
case on account of the prominence of
Mrs. Scott, who, besides being a promi
nent factor in Puget Sound social circles,
is a sister-in-law of ex-President Harrison.
During that gentleman's regime Judge
Scott was appointed superintendent of
construction on Puget Sound, and on
Cleveland's succession he was superseded
ana has since resided here. Judee Scott is
ex-Commander of the G. A. R~. Depart
ment of Washington, Idaho and Alaska.
SAN BERNARDINO HIGHWAYS.
Plans and Prospects Discussed With
Members of the State Bureau.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. I.â A
meeting of considerable importance was
held in this city to-day between the Board
of Supervisors and two members of the
Bureau of Highways, J. L. Maude and R.
C. Irvine, appointed by the last Leeisla
ture.
A mass-meeting had been called and a
number of prominent citizens were in
attendance, and considerable good ad
vice was given and received. The
committee has been traveling by
wagon throughout the State, obtaining
personal knowledge of the condition of the
highways so that it can report to the next
Legislature as to the cost of putting rock
crushing plants in each county and oper
ating them. To a Call correspondent one
of tne committee said:
"Our object is to have fine macadamized
ro.nis from one end of the State to the
other, and the outlook is most encourag
ing."

FRESNO'S GRAND
JURY REPORTS
Scathing Arraignment of
Supervisors and Other
Officials.
NEGLECT THEIR DUTY.
They Fail to With Cer
tain Sections of the County
Government Act.
ALLOW EXORBITANT CHARGES
A Demand That Many Useless Depu
ties Be Taken Fjom the
Public Crib.
FRESNO, Cai., Feb. 1. â The Grand
Jury made its final report to Judge Risley
to-day. Taken in conjunction with the
partial report made December 6 last its
arraignment of derelict officials, especially
the Board of Supervisors, is very severe.
Several small sums have been covered into
the county treasury during the sitting of
the jury by persons who had made over
charges or had neglected to account for
moneys.
Summary of the arraignments and
strictures is as follows: The jury finds that
the chairman of the Board of Supervisors
has failed utterly to comply with section
19 of the county government act, requir
ing his signature to the minutes of its
proceedings.
This, they declare, jeopardizes the valid
ity of the proceedings of said board. Sec
tion 24, siime act, requiring published
statements as to the financial condition of
j the county, and the proceedings of the
board, has not been complied with. The
burden of both representations, however,
is an arraignment of the Board of Super
visors over the bill of Armstrong & De-
Guerre, San Francisco, for repairs to books
at courthouse. Relating to this matter,
the report says:
"In our partial report we set forth facts
that a certain bill for repairs of county
books, presented to tne county by Arm
stron & DeGuerre of San Francisco for
$1899, was a fraudulent bill, by reason of
certain items of work which were not
done, and by excessive and exorbitant
charges for work which was done."
During recess the jury employed an ex
pert, who made a report that the firm of
Armstrong & DeGuerre had made an
overcharge of $803 U3. Payment on the
warrant in favor of them was estopped by
advice of the District Attorney, based on
the former report. The jury now recom
mends the payment of $1042 25 for this
work.
Attention is called to the illegal em
ployment of "road deputies," who directed
work in many parts of the county and
piled up bills to the amount of ?1760 for 1895.
This should have been done by the Super
visors themselves, for which extra pay of
$500 had been provided.
On the question of deputy assessors the
report says:
"In our partial report we called the at
tention of the court to the fact that, con
trary to law, nineteen deputy assessors
were paid from the county treasury for
services performed in assessing during the
year 1895. We deem this matter of suffi
cient importance to again call the atten
tion of the proper officers thereto, and
recommend that steps be taken to recover
the money so illegally paid out."
The report recommends the abolition of
the Horticultural Commissioners, and
says :
"We find that Fresno County has been
subdivided into three districts and a Com
missioner appointed for each district. We
believe the eeneral provision of thÂ« law
creating such commission a /rise one, yet
with such investigation as has been pos
sible during our session we can but ex
press our dissatisfaction at the results ob
tained from the service of said commission
and the money expended."
Referring to the office of Game Warden
the jury says:
"We do not find in this connty a suffi
cient amount or variety of game in need of
protection to warrant the/ outlay of $60 per
month or any other sumf; hence we advise
that the salary and allowance for expense
now paid to tne Game Warden be discon
tinued."
One sentence in the report referring to
the city police on the question of unlaw
ful games at a few cigar-stores is as
cllows :
"The evil complained of is so generally
known that we are amazed that he City
Marshal ai;d the police under his control
have never taken any effective steps to
correct it. The far-reaching consequences
of this terrible state of affairs compel us
to be most outspoken in its condemnation,
and its abatement should receive at once
the attention of both the couDty and city
authorities."
The report winds np by touching on
favoritism, and says, in part:
"There is too much favoritism shown for
political friends and services, without re
gard to the necessity of a great deal of the
work done or to tiie efficiency of those em
ployed; and if it is further considered
that labor in all branches has materially
declined within the past few years, any
sum expended now should cover at least
one-third more ground than in the past."
A plan for county supplies is follows:
"In the purchase of all county supplies,
the proceedings should be such as will
protect the interests of the county. Free,
fair and open competition should be the
unvarying rule where any considerable
amounts are involved. This course has
not been followed by the Board of Super
visors."
BAXTA BARBARA. MXBTERY.
Peculiar Evolutions of a Strange Steamer
in the Harbor Â»
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. I.âAn
other mysterious steamer to-day appeared
in this harbor, sailing around and around
outside the kelp and several times direct
ing her course in such a manner that she
seemed about to run into the wharf, but
finally starting for the north, the direc
tion whence she came. Her strange actions
were observed by hundreds of people on
the bench and boulevard, and are the sub
ject of general comment to-night.
A mysterious steamer yesterday soent
the entire day in the channel. This craft
appeared early in the morning opposite
Anacapa Island, and some six miles off
shore. She resembled a Panama steamer
in appearance, and was thought to be dis
abled, as from dawn to sundown she
worked her way some twenty-five miles up
the channel, being still in sight
to the northward, apparently opposite the
Hope ranch, when night closed in. There
is reason to suspect that to-day's stranger
was the same vessel returning, but those
who most closely observed her declare
that she was by no means disabled, as she
cut the most astonishing figures during
her evolutions here. The Vessel is believed
to be a smuggler.
Santa Barbara's Fire- Alarm System.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Feb. I.â The
Gamewell fire alarm system 5s in full
operation in Santa Barbara to-day, with
nine boxes, including the central, the city
being being subdivided into thirty- four
stations. This is an improvement which
has long been needed in Santa Barbara,
where destructive fires have on different
occasions gained hopeless headway on ac
count of the difficulty of sending notice to
the volunteer fire company.
Eureka Incendiaries.
EUREKA, Cal.. Feb. I.â A second at
tempt was made last night to burn the
High School building here. The mis
creants, however, were frightened away
by a shot from the watchman, who was
lying in wait for them. The first attempt
was made about a week ago. The build
ing was put up a few years ago at a cost of
$36,000.
A PORT ANGELES SCHEME
Dr. Stanley to Undertake the
Propagation of Eastern
Oysters.
Will at Once Establish an Extensive
Plant on a Lagoon at Sequim
Bay.
PORT ANGELES, Wash., Feb. I.â Dr.
E. H. Stanley of this city is about to un
dertake the propagation of Eastern oysters
on the Pacific Coast. He has just com
pleted preparations for the establishment
of an extensive plant at Sequim Bay,
â¢where he has leased 400 acres of land from
the Government, including a lagoon cov
ering 100 acres. The doctor proposes to
propagate on the park system, which has
been extensively adopted in France.
For many years Dr. Stanley has made
an exhaustive and scientific study of oys
ter culture, and the fact that volunteer
propagation of Eastern oysters in San
Francisco Bay has been reported by C. H.
Townsend of the Fish Commissioners'
Bteamer Albatross convinces him|that these
waters are adapted to this purpose. The
doctor has the salinity and temperature of
the water in the lagoon under perfect con
trol and has made several experiments in
this locality during the past year. As each
oyster breeds from~ eight to ten millions of
spat, the industry is likely to prove a prof
itable one and the result will be watched
with interest.
Dr. Stanley is also mailing preparations
for the shipment, of a carload of Eastern
oyster seed, which is to be planted in the
park.

TRAGEDY ON A
TRAIN NEAR POSO.
Unwarranted Killing of a
Tramp Who Stole a
Ride.
HIS SKULL CRUSHED IN.
Murdered and Hurled From a
Flatcar Because He Had
No Money.
AN EMPIOYE UNDER ARREST
â â â __
i
Accused by a Companion of the Dead
Man of Having Committed the
Crime.
BAKERSFIELP, Cal., Feb. I.â The
body of Ambrose Plant was found at Poso,
twenty miles north of here, last Sunday
morning. It was on the railroau track,
and it was supposed Plant was a tramp
and had fallen from a train and been
killed. Such was the impression given
out and such was the verdict of the Cor
oner's jury. But now it appears that this
was entirely erroneous, and Robert Gilles
pie, an employe of the railroad company,
living at Tulare. is in Bakersfield Jail to
night and will have to answer to a charge
of having murdered Plant. The dead man
was well connected in Omaha and Wash
ington, and his body has been sent to the
latter place for burial.
The solution of the mystery is due to
Henry B. Williams, another tramp, not a
professional, who was on the train when
Plant was killed and was "beating" his
way north. It was a freight train, and at
Caliente, forty miles south of here, Gil
lespie got aboard to go to Tulare. He is
the man in charge of pumps at all stations
between Caliente and Tulare. While on
the train he got acquainted with Williams
and the two became quite chummy.
Shortly before reaching Poso Gillespie
borrowed a 45-caliber revolver from Will
iams, saying he was going to "fax" some
one in a gang of tramps riding elsewhere
on the train. He went up to Plant, and
what he said is not known, but it is sap
posed he asked for money and was re
fused. Then he swung the heavy revolver
around and brought it down with full
force upon Plant's head, crushing the
skull and causing instant death.
The man's body rolled from the flatcar
to the track, where it lay until found in
the morning. Plant never moved a muscle
after being hit.
Gillespie subsequently boasted that he
had thrown the man off -the train at Poso.
Williams came back to Bakersfield and
told the story of the death of Plant, and
to-day Gillespie was arrested at Tulare
and brought here to answer. Gillespie
has been in other trouble before and bears
the reputation of a bad man. He has had
trouble at Tulare and San Diego.

THEIR ROMANCE
RUDELY ENDED.
Two Pretty San Francisco
Girls Who Ran Away
From Home.
DETAINED AT OAKLAND.
They Were Bound for Stockton
and It Is Supposed They
Intended to Elope.
GOOD ADVICE OF A PRIEST.
Father McSweeney, Summoned to Talk
to the Girls, Persuaded Them
to Return.
Oakland Omcfc Sajj Francisco Call,^
90S Broadway, Feb. 1. )
"What might have been an unhappy
romance was prevented last night by the
good counsel of Rev. Father McSweeney,
pastor of St. Francia de Sales Church.
Owing to the clargyman's advice two at
tractive youns ladies of good family are
now with their parents at the Mission in
San Francisco instead of being partici
pants in a projected runaway or possibly
in au elopement to Stockton.
Early in the evening two good-looking
young ladies were noticed wandering
about Fruitvale, seemingly with no object
in view. They walked up and down the
same streets and attracted considerable
attention in the district, which is a suburb
of Oakland, and where strangers are some
what scarce.
It was evident to Constable Quinlan that
the young ladies were out for no good
purpose, and he questioned them. As
thÂ»ey refused to tell him who they were and
where they came from, be took them into
custody. Both girls were shout 16 years
old and were elegantly dressed.
They gave proof in their conversation of
good breeding and conducted themselves
very modestly. Constable Quinlan did
not care to release them, so he brought
them to the County Jail.
Sheriff White questioned the two girls,
but they would not divulge their names
and absolutely refused to tell where they
came from.
'â¢Is tnere any one for whom I can send,
or tell that you are here?" asked the
Sheriff, being unwilling to place his guests
in a cell.
"If you would like to send for a Catholic
Driest we will talk to him," said one of the
girls.
Sheriff White .thought that the girls
were in earnest and Bent a messenger for
Rev. Father McSweeney. When the
priest arrived the girls broke down and
told him their story. They said their
names were Miss Murphy and Miss Annie
Green and that they lived near Emanuel
Baptist church in San Francisco.
They said they had trouble with their
families and had made up their minds to
run away from home.
They had planned to take the boat to
Stockton, but as they found that it did not
leave till late at Bight they came over to
Fruitvale to pass away the time, intend
ing to go to San Franciaco to take the
steamer.
For a long time they rebelled against the
advice of the priest, which was that they
should go home. It was an unusual sight
that was seen in the gloomy jail, the
priest bending over two pretty, weeping
girls, and urging by all that they held
dear and holy to abandon their fatal career
and acknowledge their shortcomings and
return to their parents.
Sheriff White, too. pleaded with all thÂ«
eloquenre of a father. In the end the
words of wisdom prevailed and the girls
consented to go home if the Sheriff would
send a lady with them.
Mrs. Prescott, Oakland agent of tne Cali
fornia Children's Societ}-, was sent for and
consented to take the girls home. Deputy
Sheriff White accompanied the party
acros3 the bay.
The girls led the way to the Mission-
Ptreet cars, and when near Bartlett street
the little company alighted. It was evi
dent that the large house near by was the
home of the girls, for they ran away from
their escort and disappeared in the base
ment.
Deputy Sheriff White pursued them, in
tending to see that they were safely deliv
ered to their parents, but the young ladies
<vi -ently knew where they were, and for
nearly half an hour he searched in vain.
Mrs. Prescott finally rang the bell of the
house, and was not at all kindly received.
Only when the deputy appeared and
Btated that the girls were in his custody,
>>nd that he would summon police help to
find them, did the occupants of the house
consent to supply light and aid in the
search.
Finally the girls were found, and with
penitent features they went back to their
parents. Having satisfied themselves that
the young ladies were really at home the
deputy and the agent returned.
--"I felt earnestly for the poor girls," said
Father McSweeney to-night, "and I de
termined that I woulp: not give up until I
had succeeded in breaking their stubborn
wills. I could fee at a glance that they
were girls of refinement and very tender
in years, and they would not have been in
Stockton a day before some villain would
mark them for his prey. I think the
Fruitvale Constable did a very wise act in
taking charge of them, and I feltthankful
to Sheriff White for sending for me as
promptly as he did."
Mrs. Prescott declined to speak about the
matter, declaring that she was pledged to
secrecy.
The young ladies would not say whether
they had planned their excursion with the
help of others, but it is thoueht that the
timely arrest of the girls prevented an
elopement.
TEE FUND GROWS.
As Much as 875,000 Subscribed for the
Young Men's Christian Associa
tion Building fund.
The weekly meeting of the boards of di
rectors and trustees of the San Francisco
Young Men's Christian Association will
be hold in the directors' room at the asso
ciation building, to-morrow evening, at
which time matters relative to the large
work of the institution will be discussed.
One of the most encouraging reports
which will be presented to the meeting
v.-ill be the fact that the subscriptions have
reached $75,000, and that other sabscrip
tions will probably be made within the
next few days.
The success which has attended the can
vass thus far is an incentive to the com
mitteo to. put forth renewed diligence to
secure $25,000 more in order to make
the pledges binding, as it was understood
when the committee started out on this
special work a few months ago that no
pledges would be binding until at least
$100,000 had been subscribed toward the
indebtedness. This amount secured, the
property will be placed in a position be
yomi any possible financial failure.
J. J. Valentine, president of the associa
tion, takes a very deep interest in ihe can
vass, and the other gentlemen associated
wich him are giving much thought and
time to it. Many people are becoming
thoroughly interested and there is but
iittlo question but that the total amount
necessary will be subscribed within the
next few weeks.
Xext Thursday evening there will be a
special open night at the institution, when
younc men and their lady friends will be
admitted by complimentary invitations.
During the evening Dr. W". W. Case will
deliver a lecture on phrenology, and
make several examinations. His subject
will be "Human Nature Phrenqlogicaily
Considered." Young men desiring to at
tend may secure complimentary tickets by
applying at the association office.
M'LANE FILES HIS ANSWEH.
He Claims That He Signed Notes for
9100 Under Duress.
The defense in the suit of Curry vs. Mc-
Lane that was begun in the Justices' Court
a few days ago has put in its answer,
which contains some interesting Btate
ments.
McLane and the plaintiff bad some dif
ferences over a financial transaction and
the former was arrested on a charge of em
bezzlement. He signed a note in favor of
the plaintiff in the case for 5100 in consid
eration that the accusation be withdrawn,
which was done' and the case dismissed
in the Police Court. Recently suit was
begun for interest on the note. * In his an
swer McLane claims that the note was
signed under duress, and that it is, there
fore, not binding on him. lie alleges that
neither the note nor interest is due and re
fused to pay.
CERCLE FRANCAIS BALL
Members and Their Lady Friends
Enjoy a Terpsichorean
Fete.
Decorations of the Clubrooms and
Hallâ A Scene of Animation
and Rare Beauty.
A background of gentle green, formed
by a graceful grouping of living box and
palm and fern, served to throw into clearer
and more exquisite relief the loveliness of
San Francisco's French maids and mat
rons at the last night's ball of the Cercle
Francais. The affair was in the nature of
a club social in that no guests were in
vited, but every detail of the delightful
event wa3 carried out in a manner which
certainly evinced no small amount of the
national savoir faire on the part of the
able committee, which was composed of
J. Kahn, 1. Goodman, S. Godchaux, A. E,
Grogan, Louis Cohn, F. Hanak, H. Da
vergy, L. Kauffmann, I. J. Ascheim and
F. Seghezza.
Floods of radiance from countless incan
descent lights illuminated the club's ele
gant quarters, which were adorned with a
splendor almost regal. Palms were every
where, transforming the clubrooms into
veritable bowers, while the perfume of in
numerable flowers filled the air. Union
square Hall, which communicated with
the clubrooms, was magnificently deco
rated, hangings of daintily tinted crepe de
chine alternating with festoons of box
and myrtle, while flowers and lights gave
sweetness, brilliancy and beauty' to the
scene.
The grand march opened at 9:30 o'clock
and was a magnificent sight. About llX)
couples filed into the hall to the inspiring
strains of Mendelssohn's "Harvest Fes
tival March," which was brilliantly ren
dered by Ballienberg's orchestra. E.
Meyer, the genial and experienced floor
manager, did much to render the affair a
success, introducing some novel and
effective features into some of the. dances
and evincing a desire to make the lady
guests enjoy the club's hospitality.
He was ably assisted by L. Bocqueraz
E. Dubedat, "J. D. Abram's, P. Belltmaus,
M. Klein, M. Goodman and A. Gump.
The most prominent families in the
French colony were represented, and the
fact that all the participants were ac
quainted rendered the affair yet more en
joyable. At midnight a delicious colla
tion was served, after which the dance was
resumed until near daybreak.
SKELLY WANTS A CHANCE.
He Demands That the Garbage
Franchise Be Not Given
to Merle.
The Merchants' Association Asks a
Stay of Ten Days to Fur
nish Data.
Another factor has entered into the legal
fight over the garbage crematory that
seems inevitable if the Board of Super
visors ratifies the action of the Health and
Police Committee in practically giving the
franchise to L. V. MerJe.
R. B. Mitchell, attorney for F. E. Sharon,
whose bid is generally conceded to be the
highest, has intimated plainly that his
client will go into court if tbe board backs
up the committee, and now A. M. Skelly,
the third bidder, has warned the Super
visors in a courteous way that he does not
intend to let the matter drop.
He sent the following communication to
the board yesterday :
San Francisco, February 1, 1396.
To the Honorable Board of SupervisorsâGen
tulmej;: The undersigned begs respectfully
to call your attention to a bid made by him for
the franchise to cremate garbage, which was
duly advertised for as required by law.
In the daily press it appears that the com
mittee of your honorable board intends to
recommend an award or the franchise to a bid
der therefor by the name of 1,, v. Merle who
Did the sura of Â¥5500 for said franchise ]i
this be so I desire to inform your honorable
board that I am a higher bidder than the aaid
Merle, and that if there is any discretion iv
your honorable board I am entitled to receive
said franchise, being a higher bidder in this
the percentage contained in my bid will real
ize Â« > the city and county on the gross receipts
a sum exceeding $100,000 during the contin
uance of said franchise.
As it Is, I am content to abide by your de
cision if you can exercise discretion, bat if not I
claim to be a higher bidder than Merle and en
titled to the franchise if tbe other percentage
bid is informal and not in conformity with the
notice inviting proposals. .Respectfully sub
mitted. A. M. SKELLY.
The Merchants' Association is crowing
more and more anxious to have a hand in
the disposal of the garbage cremation
franchise, and has addressed a communi
cation to the ooard requesting that i:o ac
tion be taken in the matter of awarding
tne franchise for ten days, or until it can
have an opportunity to look over ana pre
pare a quantity of data regarding Eastern
garbage crematories that has just arrived
from a number of important cities.
The association does not want the con
tract itself, but is mereiy interested in see
ing the franchise sold to the greatest ad
vantage, that the City may benefit as much
as possible.

WHAT THE NEW CLIFF HOUSE LOOKS LIKE FROM THE BEACH.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist from the architect's plant.]
Sutro Railroad and the dedication of the 1
new Cliff House.
The opening of the new road was an
epoch in the history of San Francisco. It
punctuated the time when the domination
of the Market-street Railway Company
ceased and the rights of the people began.
The fare to the Cliff House, at the extreme
western side of San Francisco, wa3 origi
nally 10 cents. Mayor Sutro sought to
Cave it reduced. He wanted all the people
to enjoy the privilege of traveling from
the ferries to the heights for a nickel. The
street railroad company objected, and
then began the fitrht, which was continued
with ceaseless energy down to this time.
At the outset Mr. Sutro charged an en-.
i trance fee to the grounds of the cliff. This
act naturally injured the traffic of the rail
road. Tne result was that a- little more
than a year ago the street railroad com
bined to Teduce the fare to the cliff to 5
cents. But this was after the Mayor had
decided to build a street railroad inde
pendent of what he calls the "octopus"
This road was formally opened to the
public yesterday. And ther9 was great re
joicing along the line. The property own
ers and inhabitants were jubilant over the
dawn of a new era. Flags waved from
house tops and bunting floated to the
breeze. It was indeed a gala day ; a day of
rejoicing, a day of deliverance.
The new road is well equipped. It is an
electric line and excellent time is made.
There was a great contrast yesterday, ex
emplifying the feeling of the people be
tween the crowded cars on this road aud
the empty vehicles of the octopus.
. Mr. Sutro seemed very much pleased
over the openinu of the road to which he
has given much time and invested a large
Bum of money. The people along the
route lighted bonfires at night as an evi
dence of the pleasure within them.
There were great crowds at the opening
of the new Cliff House yesterday. It is a
rnagniticent building, handsomely propor
tioned and richly furnished. The recep
tion-rooms, parlors, billiard-rooms and
dinine-room and observatories all over
look the sea.
There was a band concert throughout
the day, given by Cassasa's band. A ban
quet was tendered the guests in the large
banquet hall at the new Cliff House.
Members of the Board of Supervisors, City
officials, men of affairs and other promi
nent citizens were in attendance.
The table extended tne whole length of
the long room, and the menu included
everything worth eating. It was a least
for the gods. In addition to the soup,
lish and fowl there were long sentences of
white wine, and extended paragraphs of
red liquor.
Mr. Sutro aat at the hea.d of the table.
He looked as contented as Caesar after he
had carted his own and other people's for
tunes across the turbulent sea. The fact
is the Mayor is at home at a luncheon.
Having dined with several of the crowned
heads and a few of the Presidents, Senators
and generals of the United States, he is
entirely on speaking terms with the polite
requirements and duties of a host. 1-/
Of course the Mayor made a speech. He
said many nice things about struggling
humanity and excoriated the few individ
uals who are striving to control the des
tiny, of the ereat people ;of ; California.
The : Mayor /was sarcastic, . severe and
vicious. He denounced the "octopus" ana
cried long live the people.
"The building of this little one-horse
road," said the Mayor, "is of little impor
tance, yet it involves a principle.' The oc
topus has long dominated this country,
and as great things sometimes grow from
small circumstances there is no knowing
what may be the end." ';}â¢â  I*. --â "â¢
Mayor Sutro then dwelt at length upon
the beginning of the National Government
and showed how it was the best kind of
a government for the whole people. The
constitution had bequeathed liberty to all
men. -v/- : :..-â  > â  â â â  . .â â >; \ '.;â¢â¢;_â¢
"To-day," he declared, ."it is no longer
an ; American Government. It is an
oligarchy of capitalists upon tho Arn<Â»riran
people. Three-quarters of the Senators of
the United States are elected by corpora
tions. It was*my fortuneâ or probably my
misfortuneâ to spend ten winters in
Washington, and during that time I be
came acquainted with nearly all the great
men of the nation."
The Mayor said that C. P. Huntington
was at work durins much of this time.
H â¢ declared that after getting the neces
sary franchises to build the railroad he
was interested in he and his associates
stole all the money in si^ht. Then the
Mayor told about "the corruption that Jed
up to the downfall of the Roman republic
and felt that the same end would follow a
corruption of the Government in this
country. He compared Huntington to a
highwayman who had held up the whole
people.
''And now," said the Mayor, "he has the
effrontery to go before Congress and ask
that hia thievery be condoned, that the
debt upon the Central Pacific be extended
100 years. What impudence! Here is a
man, the greatest criminal outside of the
penitentiaryâand every man at this table
knows I am telling God's truthâ robbing
the people and undermining the Govern
ment of our country. And still the people
are indifferent. They amuse themselves,
go to the theaters and attend the races,
without a thought as to their danger and
their destiny. Why, the people should
ring the fire-bells and arouse the people to
their imminent danger."
Mr. Sutro dwelt at length upon the
corruption that permeates the Congress of
the United States, and declared that a
man might as well go out and speak to
the seals upon the rocks us to appeal to
the National legislators for justice or
sympathy.
"This little one-horse road," said Mayor
Sntro in conclusion, "is a thorn in the
side of Mr. Huntington, and I tell you to
day that if I live five years longer I will
blot out the octopus from the face of the
earth."
The Mayor was cheered to the echo.
James H. Barry, editor of the Stat, made
a ringing speech. He responded to many
calls.
"I will never take off my hat," he said,
"to a man because of nia political or social
position, but lam always ready to salute
the man who stands for the people. I ad
mire Mayor Sutro for the fight he has
made against the greatest conspiracy of
the time. The Southern Pacific has bribed
the courts and Congress and has de
bauched the State. Better indeed, that
the Nation should lose $80,000,000 than
that the funding bill should pass. Let us,
however, defeat this monstrous bill and
stand in the god-like attitude of men."
! . J. Taylor Rogers then reviewed the his
tory of the funding bill.
Major J. F. Smith followed in an elo
quent speech. He said tbat the "one
horse road,' 1 of which the Mayor had
spoken, was a step in the right direction,
as it would eventually bring about the in
dependence of the people.
"The advancement and education of the
whole people," fee said, "means a higher
civilization, and the man who works t%
that end is a philanthropist." *
Sup rvisor Taylor said that the prosper
ity of ban Francisco depended on such
men as Mr. Sutro.
"We are all Interested in the growth of
the City." he said, "but the City cannot
grow unless the country develops. This
development has been retarded by the
railroad. No abundant harvest willbene
fit us unless we have a market. And what
will be the use of a market unless we have
reasonable freight rates.
"The building or the San Joaquin Val
ley Railroad," continued Colonel Tavlor,
"is a commencement in the right direc
tion. We owe our thanks to the men who
have been the promoters of this railroad.
When the new read is a success others will
follow. I believe in corporations, but I
believe in having thorn subservient to Jhe
the law, whether National, State or muni
cipal."
A. Sbarboro spoke in praise of the great
work of Mayor Sutro, whose health was
driuiK with bumpers of wine and nloritied
in speech and song.
J. M. Wilkins, manager of the Cliff
House, made the closing speech. He spoke
in complimentary terras of Mayor Sutro
and the public spirit that inspired him to
carry to a successful termination the many
sreat enterprises with which his name had
been associated.
The assembly then dispersed and the
guests wandered through the great build
ing and looked out upon the sea.
WHY PINKERTON IS HERE
Making Contracts With Local
Corporations and Hunting
a Swindler.
TO DO THE RAILEOAD'S WORK
A Chicago Bank Cashier Who Stole
$152,000 Traced to San
Francisco.
William Pinkerton, the head of the cele
brated Chicago detective agency, is in this
City. He arrived here early last week and
has since been quietly transacting much
important business and living in retire
ment at the Baldwin Hotel. Mr. Pinker
ton is a man who likes to keep in the back
ground, which is well understood wherever
he troes, but on this occasion of his visit to
San Francisco he has more than ever be
fore evaded notice â his mission being of
such significance it was best performed in
secret, without the mention of his name.
' The most interesting feature of his visit
is said to be the closing of contracts with
large corporations in tliis City. In addi
tion to that work he is understood to be
looking ont for a Chicago bank cashier who
absconded recently.
From a reliable source it was learned
yesterday that Pinkerton was in treaty
with the Southern Pacific to take charge
of the railroad company's detective busi
ness over the entire system, performing
exactly the same work as it has been doing
in the Oregon division in connection with
the Portland office. He is also said to
nave made a contract with the Pacific
Mutual Insurance Company to attend to
that corporation's Eastern business in its
detective department. The identity of the
other corporations with which he is deal
ing is Kept private.
When the Southern Pacific Company
abolished its detective bureau recently, an
officer of the company stated that it was
done for the purpose of giving the bureau's
business to Pineerton's agency, which had
already performed many a special bit of
work for the railroad people. The suc
cessful hunt and capture of train-robbers
in Oregon, and conviction through the
efforts of Pinkerton's men, placed the
Chicago detectives in an exceptionally
favorable light before the high officials of
the railroad and, it is said, led to the con
tract which is now being closed, or may
have been signed. Pinkerton's local rep
rebeutative has been John Curtin, but it is
now thought highly probable that an inde
pendent agency of the Chicago detectives
will soon be established in this City and
maintained with a special force of men.
Pinkerton i 3 credited with having told a
strange story to some friends a day or two
ago. This was about the cashier cf a Chi
cago bank, who was traced to San Fran
cisco, but no farther. As the story went,
this cashier was a daring fellow, whose de
falcations were so enormous as to place
him in the foremost rank of bank swin
dlers. He took $152,000 from his bank
without raising the slightest suspicion,
and indeed, was not suspected of fraud
until after he disappeared. When the
bank directors ascertained the true state of
affairs in the cash accounts they decided
to maintain the strictest secrecy.
Instead of making known the startling
deficit, they quietly, in conjunction with
stockholders, put $152,000 new capital into
the bank and continued business as if
nothing out of the way had happened.
This, it was explained by {he detective,
had been done to save the bank, because if
the truth were known confidence in the
institution would be instantly shattered
and the bank ruined in consequence.
It was given out that the cashier had
resigned and gonÂ« to fill another position
in some Eastern city, and this explanation
removed suspicion.
The detectives, however, set out to find
the cashier, and were rewarded by picking
up his trail. He was traced to San FranÂ°
Cisco, but beyond there was no clew.
Whether the fugitive managed to get out
of the country on a ship or steamer could
not be satisfactorily determined, and so a
doubt exists as to the fellow's whereabouts.

A COSTLY EAiE-CUT:
Arrest of a Barber for Making an Over
charge of Fifty Cents.
Alfred Bell, a barber, was arrested last
night by Policeman G. A. Anderson on a
warrant sworn to by L. Btaynaro, charg
ing him with misdemeanor embezzlement.
The offense committed by the offending
barber, as alleged by Staynaro, was an
overcharge cf 50 cents on a hair-cut. Bell
claims that the man who caused his arrest
came into his shoD a few days ago and
after taking a seat in the chair informed
him that he wanted a hair-cut, a hair
singe, a shampoo and a shave. His orders
were followed as closely as possible and he
was charged 65 cents. The mar. imme
diately objected to paying 65 cents, and
offered to pay 15 cents, but the
barber insisted on having the iull price
for his labor. Staynaro linally paid the
bill and immediately went to the City
Hall and swore out a warrant for the ar
rest of the barber.
Hell says that he will have Staynaro ar
re^ed on a charge of perjury as soon as he
is released.

HIS LORDSHIP MUST PAY
A Justice Court Judgment Ob
taiied Against J. Talbot
Clifton.
HIS ARTISTIC SENSE SHOCKED.
t
Andirons and a Fender That Were
Ordered and Not Paid For by
the Nobleman.
Lord Sholto Douglas i%not the-only scion
of the English nobility who holds the dis
tinction of having been summoned before
the courts to explain why he does not pay
claims against him, for J. Talbot Clifton,
erstwhile patron of the turf and leader of
the sporty Four Hundred, has joined the
ranks of those who writhe under the hound
ings of plebeian plumbers.tailors and attor
neys who want their money.
J. Talbot is nothing if not particular in
the things which go to make up the rou
tine of daily life, and the lack of harmony
in the color of a portiere and the furniture
of a room is as serious a shock to his nerves
as the loss of a favorite dog is to the
average man. This delicate sense of the
beauty in art was the indirect cause of his
being sued because of his neglect to pay
a bill for one pair of andirons and one
fender.
One cold day in November last his lord
ship was recHning in an easy chair in front
of the grate in his leased apartments, when
suddenly his eyes dilated as they saw the
paraphernalia of the heat-giving fireplace .
Heavens I they were entirely out of keep
ing with the fittings of the mantel and
with the costly furniture of the room.
Such a discord of color and design could
not be tolerated for a moment. With the
perspiration standing out on his noble brow
and hands that opened and shot convul
sively he sprang madly for the bellrope to
summon his valet.
The violent jingling of the bell convinced
that worthy that nothing less important
than a case of life and death had agitated
his master, and he flew to the rescue with
goods usually labeled "handle with care"
in either hand.
His lordship's look of distress, as he
gazed at the offending fender and irons
alarmed the menial, and he was about to
run for a physician when J. Talbot recov
ered his speech, and in a weak and sepul
chral voice said :
"Take 'em away."
Tne valet was some time in learning the
cause of his lordship's anger, his own ar
tistic sense not having been developed in
the upper tendoru, but he finally un
tieretood, and hurried for a tradesman to
remedy the matter. His steps led him to
the establishment of Bush & Mallet, on
Post street, where he straightway ordered
the most expensive fender and set of and
irons in the place, and sent the firm's de
livery wagon on the gallop to install them,
lest his lordship should have a hemorrhage
through tating a second glance at the
grate.
His fears were ungrounded, for J. Talbot
bad taken flight, and the valet soon had
the new appiiances in place and a roaring
fire burning. He was congratulating him
self that all danger was past when his
master returned, arid casting one wither
ing glance at his servant kicked the fender
into the fire, declaring that the valet had
no more taste than "the beastly landlord;
yon know." The new articles were no
more appropriate, though far more costly,
than the ones they had superseded.
The firm that furnished the goods re
fused to take them back, claiming that
the fire and the kick from the aristocratic
foot had made them unsalable except as
scrap metal. J. Talbot demurred about
footing the bill, eagerly as he had footed
the fender. Then the firm decided not to
dally with his lordship, but placed the
matter in the hands of one J. S. Reed,
vulgarly known as a collector of bad debts,'
and the latter brought suit in the Justice
Courts for $75, the value of the articles.
Though served with a summons J. Talbot
disdained to put in a defense, and Justice
Kerrigan when the case came up yester
day promptly gave judgment for $75 prin
cipal, $1 10 interest and $G 50 costs.
Unle&s the judgment is settled soon an
execution against some of the noble scion's
property will be issued.

William G. Layng, editor of the Breeder

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896,
Co.ist Trotting-horse Breeders' Associa
tion:
Without good thoroughfares there is no In
centive to drive good horses.
Some people say the bicyclists are destroying
the interests in horses. The bicyclists are de
veloping a feeling in favor of horses and for
road riding.
Mr. Brunning of the Ban Francisco
Bicycle-dealers' Protective Association:
What wo want in this City Is for all sections
to combine for once to perfect one main thor
oughfare from water to water.
Market street should be nnved first and then
there would be a Parting place for the different
boulevards. It would pay every merchant on
Market street to chip in and help out on the
proposition.
With one conspicuous model street it woujd
only be a matter of time before the streets
branching from it would be similarly per
fected. Such was the experience in Chicago.
C. F. Grunsky, ex-president of the
Technical Society of the Pacific, member
ship 200:
The pyrpose of the engineer really is to make
the best possible use of materials available.
Ban rrancisco Is expending annually nearly
$2, 000,000 in road and sewer construction,
and four-fifths of that amount is spent on
roads. With such a -sum we ought to tret the
very best pavements aud large areas of them
every year.
Z. TJ. Dodge, attorney for the Van Ness
Avenue Improvement Club:
The first thing that a stranger notices Is the
condition of the streets. Any one that hiss
been to Paris remarks upon the beautiful
boulevards. But It took long experience to
perfect them.
Here public and concerted action is lacking,
and It will require a good Dooming of the
proposition of first-class pavements to awaken
the people generally to a realization that
money spent for permanent improvements is
always well invested.

Judge F. H. Kerrigan, chief consul of
the League of American Wheelmen:
The secretary of the National Farmers' Con
gress submitted and estimated that the total
annual wagon transportation in the United
States is equivalent to about 000,000,000 tons,
costing $2 per ton for the average liaul of
eight mile*. Sixty per cent of the cost, or a
total of Sj-C00 ,000,000 a year, he attributed to
the bad- condition of the roads. Thnt meant
that one-quarter of each year's products was
lositothe producers through the bad roads.
It is economy to have good roads.
A MUSICAL EVENT.
Prominent Men Will Tender a Benefit
Concert to the Saturday Morning
Orchestra.
The Saturday Morning Orchestra has so
repeatedly and successfully given its
services, in the cause of charity that its
many friends will learn with pleasure tbat
a number of prominent gentlemen in this
city are desirous of tendering a benehtcon
cert to the orchestra, which has so long
worked for others.
The following letter was recently re
ceived by. Mrs. S. S. Wright, president of
the Saturday Morning Orchestra;
Mr g. 8. & Wright. Pretidmt of the Saturday
Morning Orchestraâ Dear Madam: We, the un
dersigned, are all friends and well-wishers of
tho Saturday Morning Orchestra, of which you
have been so long the president, and we trust
that nothing may occur to interfere with the
continuance and the prosperity of that orgau
izatiou.
It is well known how readily and willingly
the young ladies composing the orchestra have
responded on every occasion for charity, and
how successful the results -have been, but we
realize that the concerts that the orchestra
has heretofore given for charitable purposes
have involved not only a Meat deal of time
and hard work on the part of the young indies,
but rlbq a considerable expenditure of money
by the organization, and we, therefore, sug
gest that a concert might be given this season
for the benefit of the orchestra itself.
Believing that the interest of people in San
Francisco in the young Indies' orchestra would
make such a concert successful, we beg; leave
to tender to the Saturday Morning Orchestra a
benefit concert to be given at such time and
place ac may be determined upon by your
board. We remain very respectfully, Charles
Webb Howard, A. B. McCreery. F. A. Hyde, J.
L. Rathbone, W. C. Little, William Aivord,
William Thomas, Edward J. McCuteheon,
Winfleld 8. Jones, Edward Bosqul, H. P. Tevig,
George W. McNear, Pelaro W. Ames.
To this Mrs. "Wright has replied, on
behalf of the young ladies:
To Charles Webb Howard and othersâGentle
men: The young ladies of the Saturday
Morning Orchestra desire me to say that they
accept with much pleasure and many thanks
your kind courtesy, and they respectfully
suggest Monday evening, February 17 and the
Metropolitan Temple as a desirable time and
place for the benefit concert so cordially ten
dered. I have the honor, gentlemen, to be
yours, very respectfully,
Joanna Ma.yka.kd Weight,
President of the Saturday Morning Orchestra.
Thero is no doubt that the concert
will prove a brilliant society event, for the

Suing for Libel.
George Greenzweig. the jeweler who failed a
few days ago, has brought suit against Al
phonsp Judis to recover $-.20,000 damages for
libel. He charges JndiÃ with saying that he (
the plaintiff, had fraudulently acquired a large

THE BOUNDING BILLOW
Another of the Old-Time Whalers
Is to Be Sold and
Broken Up.
_____
WAS A BONANZA IN HER TIME.
Boat-Steerers Paid Premiums to Secure
a Berth When She Was
Fitting Out.
The old whaler Bounding Billow that
for forty-two years has braved "the
stormy winds tbat blow" has probably
made her last voyage. Sl-e is now being
dismantled in Oakland Creek and as soon
as everything tbat can be taken out of her
has been removed the hulk will be sold to
the highest bidder. It will then be taken
to California City and burnea in order to
save the copper and iron.
The old vessel will make a great bonfire
as her timbers are soaked with oil from
the thousands of whales taken in the
frozen Arctic and the Southern Seas. With
her will go one of the few remaining
relics of the old-time fleet that at one
time made their headquarters at New
Bedford and Nantucket asid brought
wealth and prosperity to the inhabitants
of those towns. Steam is now driving the
"wind jammers" out of the whaling busi
ness and in a few years there will not be a
sailing vessel clearing for Point Barrow.
Old-time captains who cannot pet anybody
to fit out a whaler for a cruise say the busi
ness is played out, but the successes of
the Pacific Steam "Whaling Company tell
a different story.
In her time the Bounding Billow has
probably brought more "oil and bone"
into this port tha.n any other whaler of
the old class. She was almost invariably
successful and many a time boat-steerers
have paid a bonus to get a chance to ship.
The last time she went out was in 1892.
She brought back 700 barrels of oil aud
7000 pounds of whalebone, but this did not
Say expenses, and as the agents, Wright,
owne & Co., about that time pot into
difficulties the vessel was laid up in Oak
land Creek. When she was fitted out for
her last cruise about $3000 was spent on
her outfit, and it is this sum the receiver
of the Wright, Bowne & Co. estate is try
ing to recover.
The b9ats, running gear, canned goods,
equipment, such as oars, rowlocks, rope,
harpoons, etc., have been sold to vessels
now fitting out, and the Andrew Hicks
will take some of them with her when she
sails in a few days. This has raised a row
between the owners and the ship-chand
lers. The latter say that the sale of these
goods ia injuring their business, but the
receiver says: "I am doing the best I can
by tbe estate of Wright, Bowno & Co.,
and if you don't like it you can lump it,"
By the sale of the Bounding Billow in
this way it is expected that quite a large
sum will be secured. Had she been sold
as a whaler, fully equipped, the chances
are that she would not have brought more
than $2500, but with all her equipment
gone the chances are that she will bring
that sum at auction this week. Her masts,
spars, sound timber and old iron and
copper will well repay the purchaser.
The Bounding Billow was built at Chel
sea, Mass., In 1854. She is 240 tons gross
burden, 119 feet long, 27 feet 5 inches
broad, 12 feet 2 inches deep, and was origi
nally owned by J. & W. R. Wing of New
Bedford. About two months ago there
was a prospect of fitting her out for an
other cruise, but the necessary money
could not be raised, so the scheme fell
through. Now the old bark'a days are
numbered.
ALONG THE FRONT.
The New Railroad and Steamship
Line Between San Jose and
Alvlso Being: Blocked.
Captain Redstone of the navy-yard tug
TJnadiHa had a rather unfortunate experi
ence on bis initial run to San Francisco
from Mare Island. The trip was made in
the fast time of two hours and five min
utes, but the captain was too eager to dock
and make a record and thus got into
trouble. The tide was against him, and
before stern way couid be got on the tug
she went crashing into Washington-atreet
wharf, carried away a number of the piles
and did oth'-T damaee to the superstruc
ture. The steamer's starboard bow was
damaged and the new paint was scraped
off in a number of places.
The Unadifla will be used *sa towboat to
bring the cruisers to and from the navy
yard, a transport to carry marines and
sailors to and front- San Francisco and a
frei^htboat to carry supplies to Mare
Inland. She is a very handsome craftâ
and fpst. In fact, 6he is far better than
her builders calculated upon. A full de
scription of her was given in The Call
two m >i)ths ago. Before docking at Wash
ington-street wharf the Unadilla went to
the coast-defense steamer Monterey with
orders for Lieutenant-Commander Wad
hams, who is temporarily in command.
Captain Kane is away on sick leave and
was to have reported for duty yesterday,
but as he is pot yet able to be about the
lieutenant was instructed to remain in
charge.
Captain Kane has been a very sick man
with malaria, but his relatives say that he
wilt be about again in a few days, but will
not be oft sea duty until he receives his
appointment as commodore.
The German bark H. Hackfeld, which
arrived from Honolulu yesterday, had a
catastrcphe during the voyage. On Janu
ary 25 last, when almost in sight of land,
Frederick Druckhamraer, a lad aged 17
years, fell from aloft and was drowned. In
his fall from the royal yard he struct the
rail and sank at once. The Hackfeld spoke
the sealing schooner Penelope with a catch
of twenty-rive seals.
The steamer Corona of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's line will succeed
the Pomona pn the Eureka run this week.
The Mexico will be put on the southern
route and the Pomona will be laid up for
repairs.
The City of Everett, since her with
drawal from the Panama route, has been
chartered by the Dunsmuirs and will in
future carry coal from Nanaimo, B. C.
The following notice to mariners has
been issued by the Lighthouse inspectors:
"The Noonday Rock bell buoy, which
recently parted its moorings and went
adrift, has been replaced in its old posi
tionâ6oo yards southwest by south from
the rock."
The American ship Aryan, now out
seventy-six days from New York, has $25,
--000 worth of steel rails on board for the
new railroad being built by Piper, Aden,
Goodall & Co., between San Jose and
Alviso. The company is having consid
erable dimtulty in securing its right of
way, and all the blame is iaid on the
Southern Pacific Railroaa Company. Con
demnation suits have been begun.but the
| cases are being blocked in the courts*nd
Messrs. Pryor and Goodall are getting
tired of going to San Jose only to find that
a continuance has been granted.
Both of the gentlemen returned from a
trip over the proposed road yesterday and
said that all the arrangements were" per
fected except for the terminus at Alviso.
They have, however, arranged for lots ad
joining the ones in dispute, and on them
j the rails will be stored as soon as they ar
rive. At AJviso, Piper, Aden, Goodall &
Co. will connect with the railroad by
steamer and freiL'htboats, and in this way
save a large sum yearly to the farmers in
Santa Ciara Vailey. The Southern Pacific
is blocking them at every step, however,
and the chances are that there will toe' con
siderable litigation before tne matter is
settled.
MRS. FURY ALSO BLAMED.
Coroner's Inquiry Into the Sunny
[side â  Fatality of
Monday.
The Verdict Charged Both the Railroad
and the Dead Woman With
Negligence.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury at the
inquest held yesterday by Dr. Hawkins to
inquire into- the cause of the death of Mrs.
Ellen Fury, the Sunnysicle dairywoman
who was run over by the 8:15 A.M.San
Jose and San Luis Obispo train No. 5 of
the Southern Pacific last Monday, blamed
both the dead woman and the railroad
company. It read :
We find that the cause of death was acci
dental but due to negligence on the part of
both parties.
The railroad was well represented by the |
employes on the train, and the statements
of Engineer D. B. Fitield, Fireman Robert
R. Clement, Brakeman E. L. Gerst, Com- 1
ductor F. D. Eaton and Baggage-master
A. J. Dale were corroborated by Train
Dispatcher E. A. Steininger as to the
speed of the train, and by Br iktman A.
W. Tesche as to the constant sounding of
the automatic bell.
The rate of speed at which the train was
said to be going was eight miles an hour.
Orders to go at that speed, the train
dispatcher said, had been given because it
was feared the condition of the track was
bad aud possibly dangerous after the
storm.
Engineer Fificld said he blew the danger
whistle as soon as he saw the woman and
her cows on the track, which was when
the train was only about seventy-five feet
away, j'iie track is straight there and a
person could see a train almost as far dis
tant from Sunnyside as Bernal. One of
Mrs. .Fury's cqwe was on the track and she
got it off, but in doing so the woman her
self was struck. The engineer said he
stopped the train as suddenly as he could.
The woman was not on the track when
the engineer first saw her, but the cow was,
and he explained that he slacked up in an
ticipation of the woman's possibly trying
to cross the track.
All the railroad men said it was the cus
tom for the automatic bell to be kept
sounding ail the way from Valencia street
to Ocean View. This vas controverted by
Mrs. Annie Eweli and her little daughter,
Essie, who live a short distance from the
scene of the accident, and who were eye
witnesses. They did not hear the bell
ringing, they said, and Mrs. Ewell thought
â¦he train was running as fast as the Mon
terey flyer. Little Essie had made an
effort to help Mrs. Fury when she saw the
j woman's danger.
From what the eight-year-old Essie said
it appeared that Mrs. Fury was more in
terested in preventing any accident to the
train than in the saving of her own cow,
and that she was trying to get the cow off
the track to preveut any probable ditching
of the train. By the irony of circum-
I stances the woman lost her own life.
HEALY'S HOSTILE HISS
An Animated Little Scene Be
tween the Captain and
Daniels.
AFTER THE BALL WAS OVER.
Failure of the Old Commander's Effort
to Sustain the Role of
Peacemaker.
â¢â¢Captain Healy is hissing through his
teeth at me," exclaimed Lieutenant Daniels
at yesterday's session of the Healy inves
tigation.
"No, I am not, sir," retorted the captain
hotly.
"I can't stand this thing any longer,"
pleaded the usually gay and debonair
young lieutenant in piteous tones.
The captain emitted a vague, rumbling
sound, which forcibly reminded the by
standers of "curses not loud, but deep."
"Listen to him, listen to him," vocifer
ated Mr. DanieJs, in great excitement.
"He means that I'm lying."
The surrounding oliicials, however, were
unable to translate the captain's rum
blings, which most of- them did not hear
at all, and Lieutenant Reynolds ordered
the much perturbed Daniels to continue
his testimony as to his superior's alleged
misbehavior on the high seas.
"On the sth, 6th and 7th of June," pro
ceeded Mr. Daniels, glancing apprehen
sively at his commander, who glared fero
ciously in return, M the captain was more
or less under the influence of liquor. We
were then in the vicinity of Chierkoff
Island, on the way from Sitka to Unal-,
aska. Ido not mean that tho captain was
intoxicated to the point of insensibility
during the entire three days' time; but he
drank a great deal. On the 6ih he made a
brutal and unprovoked attack upon two of
the wardroom boys while h6 was intoxi
cated, and on the following day, at 3
o'clock in the morning, he was drunk
again."
F. Sumi, one of the boys said to have
been assaulted by the captain, then gave
his testimony through a Japanese inter
preter. He said the captain had never
been unkind to him and* denied that he
had been ill used by the old commander.
Captain Healy hud treated him like a
father, and had even gone so far as to get
one of the passengers â a gentleman named
Hamilton â to give him lessons in English.
In response to an incisive question by
one of the captain's attorneys tne boy said
that Daniels had tried to influence his tes
timony by promising him that he should
have the place of cabin-boy to the new
captain, whereat Daniels moved uneasily
iv his chair and the judge-advocate raised
his eyebrows as though he had just re
ceived an interesting piece of information.
T. Ohno, the other Japanese boy, cor
roborated his companion s testimony as to
the captain's unvarying kindness and de
sire to have the witness take lessons in
English,
Chief Engineer Coffin of the Bear was
next called upon to testify. He recollected
seeing Captain Healy take a drink now
and then, but had never seen him intoxi
cated. He denied specifically that the
captain was drunk at any time dnring the
three days mentioned by Lieutenant
Daniels. He also gave an account of a lit
tle difficulty at Dutch Harbor, Unalaska,
on the 28th of June, on which occa
sion Daniels had testified that Captain
Healy' s demeanor was, to say the least,
eccentric.
The employes of the Alaska Commer
cial Company, shortly after the Bear's ar
rival, gave a ball iii the company's build
ing to which the officers of the Bear and of
the Rush were invitea. No notice was
given the Bear's officers that the ball was
to be a recherche affair, and they attended
in whatever attire seemed most comforta
ble to each. On arriviner at the scene of
revelry they found to "their dismay that
the officers of the Rush were brilliantly
arrayed in all the splendors of full dress.
Believing themselves to have been griev
ous'y slighted, the Bear's officers returned
to the cutter in great indignation, and on
arriving thither unbosomed themselves
to Captain Heaiy.
Captain Healy, Coffin went on to relate,
was much incensed at the manner in
which his subordinates had been snubbed,
and, on the evening of the 28th of June.sum
moned Mr. Gray, an agent of the Alaska
Commercial Company, aboard the cutter,
and in tho presence of the officers asked
him for a explanation. Gray asked what
complaint bad been made. The captain
ordered the officers to state their grounds
of grievance. To his great surprise and in
tense disgust Lieutenants Dorry, Emery
and Daniels, who had been loudest in
their complaints on the night of the ball,
refused to say anything. Seeing the ridicu
lous position in which their silence placed
him, by making him appear desirous of
stirring up strife without reason, Captain
Healy became very angry and retired from
the cabin. The witness was certain that
the captain was not intoxicated at the
time, though he was much Irritated and
complained bitterly that his men had
tried to make a fool of him.
First Lieutenant Buhner, next in com
mand after the captain, and at present in
charge of the Bear,' testified that he had
been with Captain Healy for five years,
and had never seen him drunk at sea. He
corroborated Coffin's story of the "after
the ball" episode at Unalaska and denied
that tho captain was intoxicated at the
time. Being asked when he considered a
man drunk, Mr. Buhner answered:
"When, by reason of drinking to ex
cess, his physical or mental faculties are
impaired."
"And Captain Healy 's faculties were not

BLACK'S DUNNING LETTER.
Postal Laws Apparently Violated by a
San Jose Bicycle Agent.
The postal authorities are considering
the advisability of prosecuting Lew C.
Black of 82 South Second street, San Jose,
agent for a bicycle company, for having
sent a dunning letter to H. H. Jones of
room 5, Custom-house, upon the envelope
of which had been printed, in red type,
diagonally across the face of it, "Collection
Department."
The contents of the letter demanded a
remittance of $3. which Jones says he does
not owe, although he has been frequently
dunned.
Section 332 of the postal laws makes an
offense of the kind punishable by a fine of
$5000 or imprisonment for five years, or
both,. as the maximum penalty. The word
ing of it covering the case in question is
substantially: "Any matter impressed
upon the envelope calculated by the terms
or manner or style of display and ob
viously intended to reflect injuriously upon
tne character or conduct of another.' 1

taken to San Jose.
NEW TO-DAT.
In the filling of prescriptions the average person
is in the dark a3 to the cost and the contents of the
medicine, consequently has to rely on the honesty
and reliability of the Druggist who dispenses the
drugs. The . majority of the Druggists of San
Francisco pay a commission of 25 to 50 per cent to
the physicians who send their prescriptions to
them. This being the case, bow can the "Com*
mission Druggist" be hottest? For instance, a
physician writes a prescription for one bottle L'ta-
terine, regular price 76c bottle (actual wholesale
cost 66c). On , this the Commission Druggist
"d! vies" with the physician 25 or 60 per cent. To
a person on the outside It looks as if the Druggist
was out and injured/ BUT HE IS NOT. He just
substitutes a vile imitation of Llsterine costing 50c
per gallon. â¢ There are, on the other hand, a re-
spectable class of physiciansâ and they are nu-
merousâwho will not accept commission from any
Druggist. This element of the profession we cater
to and have their entire confidence, as they know
we take no liberties with their prescriptions, filling
all prescriptions exactly as ordered and pay no
commission to any doctors. The confidence In ut
held by the public of San Francisco is proven by
the fact that we dispensed over 80,000 prescriptions
in 1895. a larger number than dispensed by any
store in the State. -

ON PRINCIPLES
OF THE A. P. A.
President Hudelson Opens
the Official Dis
cussion.
OPPONENTS QUESTIONED
Rabbi Voorsanger Contributes a
Letter on "Church and
State."
EEV. DR. WENDTE'S PERORATION
Oakland's Unitarian Divine Considers
His Argument Closed and Sub
mits His Case.
The following communication from the
pen of the A. P. A. .State president has
been received by The Call:
To the Editor of the Calfâ Dear Sir: In order
that your readers may the more readily follow
me in my discussion of A. P. Aism and may
finally obtain a clear and adequate conception
of all that is included in the words American
Protective Association, I have deemed it proper
in view of the magnitude of my subject to
subdivide it into departments and to discuss
each department by itself. These subdivisions
of my subject, which, with youi kind permis-
Bion, I propose to discuss are:
Firstâ The principles or objects of the
A. P. A.
Secondâ The A. P. A. Interpretation of A. P.
A. principles.
Thirdâ The correctness of the A. P. A. inter
pretation.
Fourth â Some reasons for the existence of
the A. P. A. and kindred organizations. â 
In my discussion I shall endeavor to avoid
pedantic expressions and high sounding
phrases. I shall where possible use ordinary
â¢words and use them in their ordinary sense.
1 shall endeavor to use open, straightforward,
easily understandable argument, avoiding
both sophistry and hair-splitting quibbles;
my sentences may be taken for what they say
â upon the face of them, and he who looks for
or expects to find some hidden Cleaning therein
Will burely be disappointed.
As, Mr. Editor, the principles of any indi
vidual largely if not wholly determine his
character, so the real character of the Ameri
can Protective Association may be most easily
and most rapidly divined by a careful examin
ation Â«f the objects for which it was organized,
and for that reason I quote herewith a state
ment of those objects. The statement Quoted
is that formulated by the Supreme Council of
the American Protective Association and is
therefore authentic.
OBJECTS OF THE A. P. A.
Firstâ The American Protective Association
is organized for the purpose of puri.'ying poli
tics; is a non-sectarian and non-partisan or
ganization composed only of true American
citizens without regard to nationality.
Secondâ While we unite to protect "our coun
try and its free institutions we attack no man's
religion so long as he does not attempt to make
it an element in political power.
Thirdâ Our aim is to preserve and maintain
the Government of the United States and the
Declaration of Independence as set forth by
the founders against the encroachment of all
foreign influence.
Fourthâ We regard all religio-political or
ganizations as the enemies of civil and relig
ious liberties.
Fifthâ lt is in our opinion unsafe and nn
vim- to appoint or elect to civil or military of
fices in this country men who owe supreme
allegiance to any foreign king, potentate or
ecclesiastical power or wno are sworn to obey
Buch power. I
sixthâ We are in favor of maintaining one
general unsectarian free school system and
will oppose all attempts to supplant it by any
sectarian institution. We are opposed to the
use of public funds for any nectarian purpose.
Seventhâ We are in favor of changing our
immigration laws in such a manner that they
will protect our citizen laborers from the in
fluences of pauper and criminal labor which
though the instrumentality of European propa
gandist societies is rapidly supplanting our
free and educated American citizens in every
line of industry; but we do not oppose honest
and educated immigrants who come for
the purpose of becoming American citizens
and who will forswear allegiance to all for
eign potentates and powers.
Eignrthâ We are in favor of putting into office
honest and true patriots who are qualified and
â who owe allegiance only to the stars and
stripes.
A FEW QfESTIONS.
Now, Mr. Editor, inasmuch as no discussion
can reach any logical conclusion or be otherwise
profitable unless both parties to such discus
sion start from a common premise, going back
far enough to reach such common premise, I
will, with your permission Âask our opponents
a few questions, referring by number to each
section o.f the foregoing statement of the ob
jects of the A. P. A. and referring only to the
principles embodied therein.
Mr. Yorke opposes the A. P. A.
Firstâ The American Protective Association
is organized for the purpose of purifying poli
tics." Does Mr. Yorke deny that our politics
need purifying or does he object to their puri
fication ?
[The second clause of this section merely
makes a statement as to "the iwembership of
the A. P. A. and has nothing to do with the
principle set forth in the beginning.]
Secondâ Does Mr.- Yorke object to our ''at
tacking no man's religion so long as he does
not attempt to make it an element in political
power," or would he object to our attacking
any religious organization which attempted to
become a factor in politics ?
Thirdâ ls Mr. Yorke hostile to our aim to
preserve and maintain the Government against
all foreign influence ?
Fourthâ Does Mr. Yorke regard religio-politi
cal organizations as friends to civil and re
ligious liberty? \
Tifthâ ls it, in Mr. Yorke's opinion, safe and
wise to put in office men who owe supreme al
legiance to a foreign power?
Sixthâ ls Mr. Yorke an enemy of the free
public school system and does he favor sup
planting it with a sectarian institution?
Seventhâ Does Mr. Yorke oppose protecting
our citizen laborers from European pauper and
criminal labor and is he hostile to honest and
educated immigrants who purpose becoming
American citizens and -who will forswear alle
giance to every foreign power?
Eighthâ Does Mr. Yorke oppose putting into
office honest and true men, patriots who are
qualified and who owe allegiance solely to the
stars and stripes?
I have also two questions to put. not only
to P. C. Yorke, but also to every one of your
readers. They are:
Question Aâ Are not the foregoing principles
those to which a* principles every truly patri
otic American should be able willingly aud
proudly to subscfibe?
Question Bâ Are not you willing to subscribe
to these as your principles?
Mr. Editor: Not wishing to impose upon vout
courtesy or to encroach further upon your
valuable space at this time 1 will reserve for
another letter the demands of the A. P. A., as
set forth in its platform. Respectfully,
â. A â B. F. Ht'DKLSON,
State President of the California A. P. A.
HIS LAST LETTER.
Rev. Dr. Wendte Reviews the Con
troversy With the Rev. Father
Yorke.
Rev. Charles W. Wendte, replying to the
Rev. P. C. Yorke, writes as follows:
Oakland, Jan. 30, 1896.
To the Editor of the, .San Francisco Callâ Dear
Bir: This long-continued discussion should
come to an end. It is becoming too voluminous
to be any longer interesting. I have succeeded
in my purpose to get certain information be
fore the people and show what -an Intelligent
und fair-minded Protestant has to say on the
points at issue. I hope I have also shown that
a man may differ vitally from others on re
ligious questions and yet prove himself a
gentleman and a Christian in their discussion.
Besides, I am tired of being belabored with
accusations of dishonesty anil fraud and epi
thets neither just nor polite by my angry
opponent. Something may be forgiven a man
who is still smarting under the rough handling
he has received from previous encounters. But
I fear Father Yorke"s rude manners toward me
axe characteristic of ;he scurvy uiatmcut
which Catholic polemists, with few exceptions,
mete out to their opponents. There would
seem to be something in the habitual attitude
of one who believes himself the representative
of a sacred caste and infallible church on
earth which promotes in him an arrogant and
unlovely temper, and unfits him for the cairn,
judicial treatment of a disputed question. To
this must be added the deep-rooted aversion
whith my adversary displays toward members
of "non-Catholic communions.
1 call attention to the fact that while in this
discussion I have said many appreciative and
kind things concerning the Catholic church
and my Catholic neighbors, Father Yorke,
"with a singular lack of generosity, has not
uttered a word of sympathyor goodwill for
Protestants, to whose broad tolerance and
friendliness the very existence of his church is
owing to-day.
If Father Yorke is simply writing his letters
to produce an effect on his Catholic con
stituency their belligerent tone is less difficult
to understand. But I thought he had under
taken to conduct this discussion on a higher
plane to arrive at the truth and show us
Protestants the superior reason of his side of
the question. If this was his purpose he has
prevented its attainment by his mistaken
methods.
THE ISSUE RESTATED.
In this series of papers' I have discussed
chiefly the question of St. Peter's primacy at
Konie and the American Protestant, as con
trasted with the Roman Catholic, theory of the
relation which church and stale ought to bear
toward each-other in this Republic.
On the first of these topics I maintained:
First â Peter was never invested by Jesus
Christ with any extraordinary authority or
spiritual supremacy above the other di6ciples.
Secondâ Even if he had been so invested there
is nothing to show that this authority was or
could be transferred to succeeding generations
of disciples. This transfer is purely an as
sumption on the part of the Roman Catholic
church and without foundation in fact or rea
son. Thirdâ Peter was never Bishop in Rome.
Fourthâ Peter never abode in Rome for any
such term as is claimed for him in the official
declarations of the Roman Catholic church.
This would have been a physical and chrono
logical impossibility. Fifthâ Peter was, in all
probability, never in Rome at all. He may
have visited it for a brief stay after Paul's
death, but there is no real evidence for it ex
cept the general tradition a hundred years
later; while, as we have seen, there is consid
erable testimony of a negative character
against the supposition.
My opponent has sought to weaken or over
throw these assertions. An impartial reading
of this discussion and of the authorities cited
will, I believe, show that his interpretations
of Scripture are forced and against the plain
sense of the Gospel and that the arguments he
bases upon them are misleading. Let an in
telligent public judge for.itself. My opponent
evidently lays more stress on ancient legend
and tradition than modern historical criticism
and an unbiased conscience will allow. He
seems, indeed, to have an inkling of the weak
ness of his claim to Scriptural and historical
attestation, for he tells us that he himself finds
a stronger warrant for the divine right of his
church in the fact that the Papacy still exists
to-dr.y in all its splendors and powers. God,
he concludes, has thus given witness to its
supreme and eternal right to rule over men's
souls.
But this is a very fallacious argument. By
parity of reasoning, the absolute personal rule
of. the Czar of Russia might be held to be
divinely instituted, nnd to be perpetual, be
cause it exists in the plenitude of its powers
to-day. But the Nihilists have blown some
large hores in that claim. Every sane politi
cal thinker feels assured that the overthrow of
the autocracy and introduction of constitu
tional guarantees in Russia Is not far away.
Even so the Papacy has been deprived of two
thirds of its former prestige and power, and
the day is not far distan t when it will be over
thrown or transformed, and the Catholic citi
zens of this country will refuse to be vassals,
even in a spiritual sense, to a Roman or any
foreign potentate whatever. History has
already judged the Papacy, and shown it to be
a human and fallible, not'a divine and infal
lible, institution.
CHVRCII AND STATE.
As regards the second topic of discussion, I
Claimed that the Roman Catholic theory of
church and state was that of theocracy, or the
supremacy of the church and the subordina
tion of the state. I sought to prove this
by citing the testimony of popes, councils,
scholars and prelates, and the general courses
of action pursued by the church of Rome
through the centuries down to this very day.
Father Y'orke has denied the validity of cer
tain of these witnesses, especially those drawn
from Hittell. He has succeeded in impairingor
destroying the relevancy of a few of them, but
none that are essential to my argument.
The great historic proofs furnished by Popes
Gregory VII, Innocent 111, Boniface VIII and
Pius IX, and the utterances of eminent Cath
olic theologians and teachers remain, monu
mental testimonies to the truth of my asser
tions. But, as "actions speak louder than
words," so the doings of the Roman Catholic
clergy, their constant interference in the poli
tics of nations, their attitude of hostility to
civil governments, to-day as well m in olden
time (as witness France, Itaiy, Belgium, Aus
tria, Prussia, Bavaria, Mexico and the South
American States), all irrefutably prove the cor
rectness of my definition. Even Switzerland,
the freest country under the sun, and the best
governed, has had to expel the Jesuits for
their political intrigues. In the United States
the hopeless minority of the Roman Catholic
elements among us prevents any large inter
ference of the clergy ot thax communion in
ourpoliticallife. But the massing of Roman
Catholics In large cities and their clannish
political courses are constant sources of dis
cord. The Roman Catholic church is an influ
ence of importance which politicians have to
reckon in every city election. If the Roman
Catholic church were more powerful in this
country, it would unquestionably seek to con
trol and largely to destroy our existing insti
tutions. A striking instance of the truth of
this assertion Is furnished by the Concordat
which Rome made, comparatively recently (in
1863), with the republic of Ecuador. I'will
cite and summarize a few ot the articles of this
now famous compact through which Ecuador
has remained a vassal of Rome, and Protes
tants are forbidden to worship in public in
that country. â¢
Article I. The Catholic religion is the relig
ion of the State. Xo other worship is to be per
mitted in the republic. .
Art. HI. Every book prohibited by a bishop
is to be confiscated by the republic.
Art. VI. The Government is to lend the
Bishop a strong hand in the suppression of
any who may try to lead astray the true be
liever (i. c. Protestants. C. W. W.).
Art. VIII. An ecclesiastic can only be held
responsiDle before an ecclesiastical tribunal,
even in cases of misdemeanor which fall under
the common law.
Art. IX. The Holy Father permits ecclesias
tics to pay taxes, but in case they do not they
can only be persuaded to it by the church
authorities.
Art. X. Every church and every convent
shall be empowered to offer asylum, and no
criminal shall be siezed therein without the
express consent of the ecclesiastical authori
ties.
These citations show convincingly what is
the ideal conception and true doctrine of the
Roman Catholic church on this subject. They
render preposterous tne claim of Father Yorke
that his church is most favorable to republics,
while Protestantism is most in harmony with
monarchies. Montesquieu in his epoch-mak
ing book, "The Spirit of the Laws," did not
think so, for chapter V of book XXIV is headed :
"That the Catholic religion is most agreeable
to a monarchy, and the Protestant to a repub
lic." The whole organization of the Roman
Catholic church, with its ranks and dignities
and supreme power lodged, in the Pope, is dis
tinctly monarchical in form. The p-oiestant
churches are with lew exceptions as distinctly
democratic in principle and constitution. It
is a matter of common history that the New
England commonwealths which inspired the
later republic were modeled after the Congre
gational system of church government, which
has been copied from the free, simple forms of
the earliest Christian churches, which in turn
has been derived from the Jewish, synagogue.
CATHOLIC ASCENDENCY.
Will the Catholic church ever gain the as
cendency iti this country ? Ido not believe it
although they themselves do. A polished and
cultivated gentleman, at one time an influen
tial Catholic, writes me: "Be sure, the last
hope of that tremendous but, thank God, van
ishing power, is in this great country of the fu
ture. The dominion over it would somewhat
reconcile them to the loss of the Old World.
To attain that supreme object of their ambi
tion they are ready to use every possible means,
lawful or unlawful, open or secret." So speaks
one who knows it well from the inside. It at
least behooves Americans to be watchful and
prepared, to learn our weakuess and increase
our strength. "Eternal vigilance is the price
of liberty."
CATHOLIC TOLERATION.
In this same way the claim that the Cath
olics who settled Maryland were actuated by
exceptional or genuinely tolerant motives has
long been completely exploded. The most
eminent writer on American history now liv
ingâProfessor John Fiske of Harvard â said in
a lecture 1 heard him aeliverlast October, that
this liberal policy of Lord Baltimore was
rather, from necessity than choice. Fiske
tells us:
"The Catholic proprietors of Maryland wished
to make their province a desirable home for
Catholics who .were inclined to leave Eneland;
and the only possible way of accomplishing
this without interference from the British
Government was to pursue a policy broad
enough to include Catholics along with all
other kinds of Christians in its benefits. A
similar necessity confronted Charles II and
James 11. In order to secure as much protec
tion as possible for Catholics without interfer
ence from Parliament it was necessary to pur
sue a policy broad enough to include Quakers
alonp with Catholics. For such reasont James
refrained from disturbing thÂ« liberal Dutch
policy in New YorJt. For such reasons both
these biusrt Kings supported the scheme* of
William Perm. in whose proprietary colonies
of Pennsylvania and Delaware the principles
ol toleration were carried, out on the whole
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896.
more completely than anywhere else in
English-speaking America."
MR. WENDIE'S ATTITUDE.
That I have not replied to Father Yorke's
question, "What I would do if own my church
came in conflict with the State," was solely
due to the fact that the query seemed to me ex
cessively absurd. I thought it only a joke on
his part. But as he really seems serious in
asking it, I. will gratify him. I would obey the
State as the supreme power in the land, the
highest possible expression of the. popular
will. Having done this, I should yet not be
cut off from the exercise of my religion. I
should follow Jesus' teaching and retire into
my own closet and pray to my Father which
seeth and heareth in secret. That is good
Christian and Protestant doctrine. It is only
the Romish church which persists in thrusting
the priest and the altar between the individ
ual soul and its Maker. Of course, social wor
ship is helpful and delightful, and I would
seek by every lawful means to recover this
Tight of public worship for myself and my
fellow believers. In a republic like
ours that would not be difficult. In
deed, a true republic would never take
away this right unless it could be shown that
this worship was directly hostile to the safety
and perpetuity of the State, in which ca?e it
ought to be suppressed. So the American
state suppressed certain features in the Mor
mon Church. Some day it may intervene, as
European and Catholic Governments have
done again and again, in certain of the tem
poralities of the Roman Catholic church in
this country, should these ever become a
menace to popular liberties. The state would
do this just as calmly and legitimately as she
would curb and restrain any other great cor
poration which jeopardized "her welfare. But,
if all my endeavors to secure freedom of public
worship were unavailing I should emigrate,
following the example of the Pilgrim fathers.
THE AMERICAN DOCTRINE.
To the theories of the Roman church I op
posed the true American doctrine of church
aud state, viz.: "In spiritual concerns, the ab
solute independence of the church; in tem
poral affairs, the subordination of the church
to the state." Moreover, I affirmed that the
power of deciding what were properly to be
considered temporal affairs was vested, not in
the church, but In the civil tribunals of the
state. This last point is especially important,
because the Roman Catholic authorities, even
in this country, teach to the contrary. 1 cited
in support of this the Jesuit Father Jouin's
work, which is used in the parochial schools
and colleges of California. Father Yorke, in
deed, accuses me of leaving out a final conclu
sion of Jouin's, which he quotes. But, in so
doing, he himself contrives to leave
out the opening and important pas
sages of Jouin, on. which my argu
ment was chiefly built. I shall not go
into hysterics about the matter and fiercely
denounce my opponent for so doing, but will
assume that it was an inadvertence, and sup
ply the deficiency. Let us look at the whole
extract as now given by both. Says Jouin, p.
804: "The church has to legislate on all mat
ters belonging to faith and niorais; she does
not frame laws relating to purely secular con
cerns; she proclaims only the rules of right
and justice revealed by God, in accordance
with which the State's legislation must be.
The State, taking for its guidance this revealed
law, may enact its own laws and adopt what
measures it deems fittest to attain the end of
civilized society; and as long as it remains
within its own sphere it neither will nor can be
interfered with in the least by the authority of
the Church.' 1
That is to say the church lays down the re
vealed laws, which mustcontrol the legislation
of the State. Now, there is but one true and
infallible church, according to Jouin's pre
vious reasoning, that of Rome. The State
must take this revealed law from her for its
guidance, and remain within its own sphere,
in which case the ''authority of the church"
will not interfere with it. Does not this con
firm my statement of Catholic doctrine? But
let us go on with Jouin.
"When, in doubtful cases, a collision might
arise, it is evident that, to preserve the union
between both powers, the state must yield to
the church, since she is the higher power, and
she ulone is competent to determine the limits
of hey own jurisdiction."
Tnis is the main point, which Father Yorke
omits in his requotation. "The church is the
higher power." "The state must yield to her."
Could there be a more complete vindication
from current Catholic and Jesuit opinion of
my theses â the Roman Catholic theory ranks
the church as a higher power than the state?
But Father Jouin.explains: "No fears need
be entertained that the church ever will en
croach upon the rights of the state and curtail
its authority, because, not being a human in
stitution, she' is guided by the Holy Ghost."
Considering whtt mischief and wickedness,
on this theory, the Holy Ghost has led the
church into during its long existence, this as
surance will not be very comforting to the
American people.
But, finally, Father Yorke asks us to observe
that Jouin offers a further proviso of safety:
"Ifauyof the local authorities of the church
presume to interfere unduly with the rights of
the state, the Pope will ever be ready to re
strain their ambition."
TJjat is to say. the Holy Father, in case in
justice is done our nation by the Roman Catho
lich church aud Holy Ghost, will intervene In
our behalf. How grateful we ought to be!
Picture the American people waiting submis
sively for the Pope at Rome to decide whether
they or his Holy Ghost and Roman Church are
in the right about these temporal questions!
Truly, if I did not transcribe this last sentence
of Jouin it was because it seemed too pitiful to
quote. In calling attention to it Father Yorke
has greatly weakened his defense.
But Jouin adds: "Moreover, the church
wields a spiritual power only; she has not, as
the state has, material power at her disposal.
Hence, as history amply testifies (sic!), the
encroachments of the civil power are the only
dangers threatening the harmony between
church and state."
And, to prove this Jouin in succeeding pages
denounces the civil marriage and the "godless
education" now prevalent among us, two in
stitutions which are the cornerstones of the
Republic, and- which were in full vogue long
before there was a Catholic church within the
limits of our young nation. Is not this an
tagonizing thesute? Whatsophistry all thisis!
But lei Americans reflect that thisis the phi
losophy of the relations that ought to exist be
tween church and state in this country, wnich
is taught to hundreds of thousands of Catholic
youth. Surely, while such doctrines are being
instilled into the minds of the children in
their charge, have we not a right to doubt the
entire loyalty of the clergy of that church to
our American political institutions? Must we
not regard Fathers Yorke, McGlynn and the
rest aa the exceptions and not the rule? The
very fact that my opponent's frank and man
ful assertion of Americanism should have
created such general surprise in the commun
ity speaks more eloquently than words the
prevailing and, as it would seem, not un
justifiable doubt of the entire loyalty ol the
ecclesiastics of his church.
THE A. P. A.
I have a certain right to say this, for I was
one of the first to protest publi.cly in the news
papers against the formation of the A. P. A.
and its methods. There is perhaps a score of
ex-Catholics in my own society, some having
joined it since this discussion began.
I represent in this discussion no party and
no sect, but simply the interests of historical
truth, Protestant principles and the American
spirit. lam conscious of doing it very inade
quately, lama very busy man; within ten
days I have made thirteen public addresses.
Even this article has been written almost en
tirely in the cars traveling through the San
Joaquin Valley, and I have had no one to help
me with counsel or service. Entirely without
prejudice or passion, I love my Catholic breth
ren. I would gladly see them adopt views
that seera to me more rational and truly help
ful. But it must be only through the force of
inner convictions. I would readily give my
life, if it need be, to secure them ever that lib
erty oi worship which they now enjoy. I be
lieye them to be loyal and patriotic citizens of
the Republic, despite the ofttime misleading
counsels of their spiritual guides on this sub
ject. Unless their children's minds are tam
pered with at school (as vide Jouin) their de
scendants will be equally so. May God grant it!
JESTOT CASUISTRY.
I had hoped that this discussion might
be carried on without any reference
to the well-worn and hateful themes
ol tne Catholic Inquisition, the Jesuits
and "Bloody Mary." But my opponent
has insisted upon dragging in these aud other
issues quite aside from the main question and
only tending to obscure it. However, as he
has made charges against both myself r ud the
Protestant cause, I must in conclusion anwt.er
them.
First, then, my opponent charges me with
unacquaintance with the casuist Catholic
literature of two and three hundred years ago.
I am glad to say I am not an adept in it, for I
cannot imagine a more useless knowledge to a
man imbued with the modern spirit and seek
ing to gain the information that is of value
to-day. When I desire information- on this or
any other subject outside of my immediate
line of study, I simply consult the specialists
who have made it their life work. In vaSn
does FatherYorke seek to discredit this German,
French and English scholarship. It has
stood the tast of a century or more
of examination and criticism; its results
are perfectly well known to all competent and
impartial students, and are not to be belittled
by a parish priest or two in Ban Francisco. The
manner in which my opponent seeks to break
the force of my citations and summaries of Ro
man Catholic and especially Jesuit doctrine
is very characteristic of the polemical methods
of his church. First, he indulges in various
sneers about my latinity, scholarship, etc. I
will only reply that I have enougn of both to
serve the purpose of this discussion, and cause
hather Yorke much evident uneasiness and
trepidation. Second, hequibblesaboutchapter
and page, omitting to note that in all proba
bility he is using a different edition from that
to which I referred him. Next, he finds a pas
sage which has some likeness to the one quoted
and prints this side by side with my own cita
tions, as if it were the one intended, and then
cries "falsification 1" "forgery 1" Or he pur-'
posely presents my summary of the views of a
writer oa if it had been intended as aa
exact quotation of him; or he drags in
other passages that have little or no relevancy,
or wanders off into discursive explanations
that explain nothing and only serve to con
fuse and obscure the real point. And back of
all is the possibility of his being misled him*
self by the garbled and imperfect editions
which the Catholic church sometimes employs.
In my third article I cited the case of a per
sonal friend who bad been led out of the priest
hood and communion of the Church of Rome
by discovering, through the aid of the British
Museum Library, that his Catholic authorities
were untrustworthy. I have just received a
letter from that gentleman in which he writes:
"What you say of my experience in London is
all true, except that I had bad a Jesuit train
ing of twenty years. I made my full novitiate,
but did not feel called upon to take their vows.
I remained in friendly relations with them un
til my doubts arose, or for ten years." He asks
me to withhold his- name, as he does
not wish to expose himself to malicious
persecution, a request which, after my
recent experience, I can appreciate. My asser
tion that the Jesuits have justified the perse
cution and even murder of heretics is correct.
It is equally a matter oi record that â  they
.argued in favbr of regicide. Says Lecky, after
summing up the evidence, "There can be little
doubt that the Jesuits looked with a very in
dulgent eye on all attempts at assassination
that were directed against a deposed sovereign
who was in opposition to the church." My
testimonies showed tljat they indirectly en
couraged and abetted and afterward gloried
in it.
Having said this much in vindication of my
own honesty and the truth of history, I frankly
sjate that this point is a matter of indifference
to me and in no way affects the important
issues between myself and Father Y'orke.
In closing, a word on toleration.
I am much gratified to find my opponent
cuing "Lecky's History of Rationalism in
Europe" as a witness. It shows that he con
siders him as a competent scholar and trust
worthy authority, lie is right in this opinion.
To read Lecky'sbook is itself a liberal education,
especially his chapters on persecution and the
secularization of politics. But Father Yorke
stopped too soon in his quotations. Let me con
tinue them. Says Lecky (vol. 11, p. 4) :
"Nothiog can De more egreeriously absurd
than to represent the inquisition as something
unconnected with the church. It was created
by a Pope and introduced into the chief coun
tries of Europe by the sovereigns who were
most devoted to the church, and composed of
ecclesiastics and directed to the punishment of
ecclesiastical offenses * * * and long re
garded as the chief bulwark of Catholicity.
Although all the atrocities it perpetrated do
undoubtedly fall upon the blood-stained church
that created it, it is nevertheless true that one
or two Popes endeavored tp moderate its
severities."
Again he says "that the church of Rome has
shed more innocent blood than any other in
stitution that has ever existed among man
kind will be questioned by no Protestant who
has a competent knowledge of history. * * *
Llbrente, who had free access to the archives of
the Spanish Inquisition, assures us that by that
tribunal alone more than 31,000 persons were
burned and more than U90.000 condemned to
punishments less severe than death."
" "The number of those who were put to death
for their religion in the Netherlands alone in
the reign of Charles V has been estimated by a
very high authority at 50,000, and at least half
as many more perished under his son. Upon
the 15th of February, 1568, a sentence
of the Holy Office condemned all the
inhabitants of the Netherlands to
death as heretics, only a few persons
expecially named were excepted â¢ â¢ â¦
â¢'Three millions of people," says Motley, "men,
women and children, sentenced to death in
three lines!" "These atrocities were * * â¢
inflicted by a triumphant church with every
circumstance of solemnity and deliberation."
Lecky goes on, page after page, to chronicle
the terrible annals of their persecution. "The
massacre of the Albigenses, which a Pope had
instigated, and the massacre of St. Barthole
mew. for which a Pope returned solemn thanks
to heaven." â¢ â¢ â¢ "It can surely be no ex
aggeration to say that tne church of Rome
has inflicted a greater amount of unmerited
suffering than any other religion that has
ever existed among men."
PROTESTANT PERSECUTORS.
Lecky then shows his impartial reading of
history by treating in the same frank and con
demnatory spirit of Protestant persecutions.
As Father Yorke has made a frightful cata
logue of this Protestant intolerance and
cruelty, I will not repeat it here, except to
quote Lecky's comment : "The Protestant per
secutions were never so sanguinary as those of
the Catholics (owing, he says, to the compara
tive weakness.of clerical influence in Protest
ant countries), but the principle was affirmed
quite as strongly, was acted on quite as con
stantly, and was defended quite as pertina
ciously by the clergy." The only two excep
tions to this among the latter, he tells us, were
Zwinglius, the Swiss reformer, and especially
Sociuius, the founder of my own or Unitarian
branch of the Christian church. His plea for
toleration was so earnest that, as Lecky says,
it was long reckoned the distinctive tenet of
his sect. It remains so to-day. Catholics no
where receive kindlier, more appreciative
treatment than at ttxe hands of Unitarians.
No wonder that when our great leader, Dr.
(.'iianiiiii.tr, died, the bells of the Roman Catho
lic cathedral in Boston were tolled in honor
of his memory by the Bishop.
PROTESTANT INTOLERANCE. â¢ .
But this may be said in partial palliation of
this intolerance displayed by Protestantsâ that
they did not originate the persecuting spirit,
but received it as a diiect legacy from the
mother church. It is not so surprising that
meu whose hearts were still anguished with
the horrors of the Inquisition, the night of St.
Bartholomew or the ravages of the Thirty
Years' War should thirst for vengeance and re
taliation. The Catholic church cannot excuse
her outrages in the same way. At the time
her persecutions were at their highest she was
comparatively the mistress of the world and
had nothing to fear from her napless victim^.
Secondly, while the central principle of the
Roman churchâ namely, her infallible author
ityâif lully developed leads inevitably to per
secution, the central principle of Protestant
ismânamely, the rignt and duty of private
judgmentâ the more it is developed leads to
tolerance, charity and mutual forbearance.
"A mitiuii cannot be strongly Catholic and at
the same time tolerant, but that a nation may
be strongly Protestant and exercise the widest
tolerance is shown by both England and
America to-day."
"To the Reformation," says Lecky, "is chiefly
due the appearance of that raiionaiistic spirit
which at last destroyed persecution. \Vhile
the Protestant world for a long time after the
Reformation pursued the same path of spiritual
tyranny and oppression which had been taught
her by Rome, the growth of Protestant princi
ples is finally putting an end to all intoler
ance and oppression. The Reformation, the
most glorious event in modern history, taught
men to think and to think for themselves on
religious subjects; it set free the individual
conscience, it broke the shackles of ecclesiasti
cal despotism, it gave new opportunities for
growth, intellectual, moral, social, politicalâ
to oppressed and priest-ridden nations, it
made modern science possible, and enlarged
the number and tcope oi human interests."
THE NEW AGE.
The age and country in which we dwell is a
beautiful exemplification of this growth of a
rationalistic, liberal, humane and truly Christ
like spirit. The reign of fire and sword in
religion is over for us. The era of reason, con
science and good will has begun. No person
is in any serious danger of persecution because
of his religious views. If any church among
us should attempt to abridge his personal
rights our secular state, the supreme authority
in the land, would speedily intervene to pro
tect him. Under this broad charter Catholics
and Protestants, Jew and freethinker, live to
gether in comparative harmony and peace.
The only -disturbing elements are the clergy,
both Cathotic and Protestant, especially the
former, ano certain iorins of native American
ism more ardent than wise. For political
discussion in a republic inevitably assumes
a heated and partisan form. The creeds
of the churches are practically the same as
they were under the old dispensation of hate
and fear. The pretensions ot the clergy are
but slightly modified. It is the spirit of the
age which has changed. A feeling of brother
hood has been developed, men have come to
learn that goodness is of no sect; that charac
ter is above creed, life more important than
thought. The necessities of social life have
compelled men of diverse religious opinions to
live side by aide with each other. If they fol
lowed the teachings of their respective creeds
or churches there would be continual strife be
tween them. But now they follow their rea
son, their consciences, their hearts, and rise
above their sect into a eerener, sweeter atmos
phere of mutual confidence and good will. The
reformation which has benefited the Catholic
as well as Protestant branch of Christendom, the
rise of republican institutions, and finally the
glorious advent of modern science, have been
the forerunners, the Messiahs of the better era
that is now surely dawning upon mankind.
All this does not bar out an intelligent, fair
minded and courteous exchange ot opinions
on religious or any other topics. Nay, it im
plies free and candid discussion as a means of
arriving at truth. But in all it presupposes
chari ty, that spirit of good will and kindliness
which the apostle ranks highest among the
Christian virtues, and which I have been most
concerned to preserve in this series of articles.
In conclusion I may say let Catholics and
Protestants alike, while true to their inmost
convictions, maintain this spirit toward each
other's worship and there need be no fear that
the peace of our Republic will be broken by
any theological or ecclesiastical discords.

CHURCH AND STATE.
Dr. Voorsanger Explains His Posi
tion In Regard to the Great
Controversy.
Dr. Voorsanger sends the following com
munication to The Call:
_, San Fkancisco, February 1, 189t5.
To the Editor of The CallrSia: Ideemmy
self unfortunate that your reporter, listening
to my words of last night, should have gone
away with a wrong impression. The language
he attributes to me in his report of my lecture,
curiously headed "Treason in the Pulpit,"
represen ts neither the letter nor the spirit of my
words. In so tar as he attributes to me an at
tack on the Roman Catholic Church I would
flatly contradict him, and I will be supported
by every member of the numerous audience,
Jew and Christian, that did me the honor to
listen to me.
I refuse to be drawn into a controversy,
which, to my mind, can determine nothing,
and in view of the work I hope to do during
the ensuing four weeks, I deprecate the suspi
cion thus cast upon my attitude in the matter
of "church and state" by the dangerous lan
guage your reporter puts in my mouth. The
best I can do, at present, to convince your
readers of my attitude, is to quote from my
manuscript, and I will simply add that this
manuscript, line upon line, without alteration
or correction, will be presented next Friday
morning in my paper, Einanu-El. -But first
let me quote your reporter:
There is among us a body of believers, claiming
to be true and patriotic citizens, while recognizing
ana obeying a foreign spiritual power. What can
we think of such a system? only this: tne tribute
of loyalty and submission which Jhis body is
vowed to pay to its distant sovereign must detract
from their fealty to the constitution of our country
and make them less perfect citizens.
Nothing that has been said in the recent
controversy between Father Yorke and a num
ber of other citizens approaches the above lan
guage in viciousness. 1 am simply incapable
of such utterance. It is out of harmony
with my well-known attitude toward all re
ligion, and it contradicts the sentiments
to which time and again I have given
publicity. Had your reporter followed my
suggestion he would have gone home
with me to make an abstract from
my manuscript. But he preferred to rely on
his "notes," and the result is that I am placed
before the Catholic community in the attitude
of questioning their patriotism. Let us see
whether my manuscript bears out that charge.
1 began as follows:
"The present agitation in our country, grow
ing out of the orgauizatian of a society that
seeks to impose a religious test upon voters or
office-holders, is calculated to destroy the
faith of hundreds of thousands of citizens in
the integrity of the constitution of the United
States. The founders of that society appear to
base their agitation upon the supposed aggres
siveness of hierarchical institution that is
accused of holding the spiritual power from
which it derives its existence superior to the
civil compact under which the nation pro
ceeds, ana of gradually absorbing the ele
ments of power, wnich would enablo a strong
majority to oppress a weak minority. It is not
necessary for the purposes to which we shall
devote the ensuing evenings to investigate
that extravagant claim, nor can it be profit
able to arraign this new organization for the
stirring up of hatred and for resuscitating the
worst elements of controversy that divide a
nation and drag it to the brink of civil war.
Denunciation at this time would add fuel to a
fire already burning too fiercely."
In speaking of persecution I used the follow
ing language:
"In one particular direction the influence of
the church in the state created a factor which,
from our point of view, though we consider
this matter in a broad, liberal spirit, with fair
ness and without bias, cannot \>e construed as
anything but deleterious. That factor is per
secutionâan expression of clerical attempt to
control conscience, or an expression of clerical
wrath because of its inability to dominate a
dissenting minority. â¢ * â¢ It would be;sheer
nonsense to attribute that unfortunate capa
city for persecuting minorities to the Roman
church alone. England' s nistory tells of Cath
olic martyrs; the story of the New England
sects tells of nonconformist bigotry and intol
erance. * â¢ â¢ I doubt whetner a Jewish uni
versal church would be more merciful than
any other. It seems to be an inherent fault.
Let us thank God its strength Is exhausted."
The following, is verbatim et literatim, the
conclusion of my "Treason in the Pulpit":
"The nature of the union entered into by the
colonies was of a purely civil, political and
commercial character. Religion, as a determi
native policy, did not enter into this alliance.
The princes of the church or the ministers of
the gospel seem to have thoroughly understood
this great principle, that the theory of self
government for once and all reduces the
church to a moral and educational function,
subject to all the laws created and enacted by
the consent of the people. This principle was
fully understood by the Roman Catholic abbes,
who sat on the benches of the constituent as
sembly of France after the dethronement of
Louil XVI, and it was likewise understood by
the American churchmen who helped to for
mulate the principles on which the
constitution rests. Under the provisions
of that instrument, notably its first
amendment, the civil compact of the people
can never be disturbed by any church. Under
the benign operations of that compact no
church cun assert its superiority over any
other, except in so far as it leaches its own
doctrine within the precincts of its schools and
meeting-houses, where the rights of free
speech renders it competent to formulate and
promulgate its received doctrines and its plan
ef salvation. Ido not believe that any intelli
gent citizen of our country holds his church or
its authorities superior to the great instrument
that controls 70,000,000 of people. I do not
believe that any church seeks to aggrandize
itself at the expense of the great civil com
pact.
It is high time we understood that loyalty
in our country has a new and more powerful
meaning. The Roman church may retain its
aristocratic forms, yet its spirit in every coun
try conforms to the popular institutions it
finds there. It is, in our country, like all
j other churches, a moral agency, subject to
every provision of the moral and civil com
pact entered into by the States. It possesses
the right of every moral agency that conforms
to the laws of the commonwealth. Its right to
educate its children is constitutional. Its
right to assemble peacefully and promulgate
its traditions, its doctrines and its theology is
constitutional. Its right of conscience is con
stitutional. To arraign it now for the
former intolerant attitude of the church
in other countries, an attitude result
ing from its alliance with temporal
power, is the expression of a fear that
the constitution of the United States, of -the
various States, and the good sense of the
princes of the church are worth nothing in de
termining the mutual relations of the uuits
that compose this great Nation. Such non
sense is hardly worth considering were it not
unfortunately the fact that many people can
be befooled by the rantingsof political conspir
ators. That is the bane and the curse of tne
period. â  * * * If the Roman church has
spoken truly, of which there can be no doubt,
it conforms to the opinion of the relations of
church and state I have here briefly expressed;
let other sects beware lest they generate the
suspicion that they, not their presumed foes,
design to overthrow the peace of the country."
How do these words harmonize with your
reporter's "Treason in the Pulpit"? Obediently
yours, Jacob Voorsangee.
THE CHINESE WIN.
Test Case of Earn Joy, the Atlanta Fair
Actress, Goes Against the Fed
eral Authorities*
According to a brief dispatch received
by Leong Lam, the local manager of the
company of Atlanta Fair Chinese actors
which began an engagement at the Wash
ington-street theater last night, Kam Joy,
the $2200 18-year-old girl arrested by In
spector J. D. Putiiain to make a test case
of the status of the actors and actresses,
has been discherged by United States
Commissioner VanDyke,
Leong Lam's informant was his friend,
Wong Wing, who sent the telegram. The
Chinese interested are elated over the out
come of the case, and Fong Ching, % the
general agent of the Atlantic Fair exhibit
ors, feels confident that the Federal author
ities will not soon try to make out another
case. Evidently Attorney Itiordan's logic
has proved effective with Commissioner
Van Dyke.
The Washington-street theater was
packed until long after midnight. It was
the first night of the engagement of a
troupe of thirty-four actors and actresses
brought from Los Angeles by Leong Lam.
Tong Ching, who is best known as "Little
Pete, J> ordered the doors to be thrown
open at 11:30 p. m., and a tremendous
throng of Chinese surged up the entrance.
The performance last night was a sort
of historical play, as most of Chinese
pieces are. It exemplified the warring of
the six independent kingdoms of Chung,
Choy, Chew, Ngai, Yin and Ji 1000 years
ago and the diplomatic success of Shew
Chung who managed to consolidate them
all into one federation.
The costumes were, of course, gorgeous
and the stage setting full of high coloring.
The costumes are said by Leong Lam to be
worth a total of $6000.
To-night the life and adventures of Loy
Kong, a hero of Western China of 800 years
ago, will be presented. Loy started in a
poor boy and finally became Viceroy, ac
cording to the play.
Wanted in Stockton.
Rudolph Gatz was arrested last night by
Detective Graham on a warrant from
Stockton, charging him with obtaining
money by false pretenses. He opened a
saloon in Lodi, and after he sold out he
went to Nathan &Kohlberg, liquor-dealers,
S.tockton, and got $5 on his representation
that he still owned the saloon. The more
serious charge of forgery will be preferred
against him wheu he is taken to Stockton.
MAYOR SUTRO CRITICIZED
Members of the South Side Im
provement Clubs * Are
Indignant
THEY IMPUGN HIS MOTIVES
They Claim That He Is Actuated by
Self- Interest in Neglecting
Their Districts.
Mayor Sutro is severely criticized by the
South Side Improvement Clubs for vetoing
the Folsom-street appropriation. After
the resolution appropriating $35,000 toward
bituminizing this much neglected thor
oughfare had passed the Board of Super
visors unanimously, the members of the
improvement clubs, who had been assidu
ously working for nine months for the re
paying of this street, considered their fight
won. They were only concerning them
selves with such petty details as having
water and gas companies agree to lay their
pipes before the improvement in order not
to have to reopen the streets, when Mayor
Sutro's pen cast a shadow over their hopes.
"It is a grievous in jnstice," said Dr. A.
T. Rottanzi, president of the South Side
Improvement Clubs. "Had the proposed
improvement been such as .to enhance the
value of property in the vicinity of the
Cliff House the resolution would not have
been vetoed."
C. T. Spader expressed his views as fol
lows: "Confidence in South Side property
would return if the property-owners could
only convince our City officials that the
South Side is part of the City of San Fran
cisco. The Street Committee recom
mended and the board passed a resolution
setting aside $35,000 from the street fund to
repair Folsoni street. Our Mayor, to
whom San Francisco i 9 bounded* by the
horizon as viewed from the Cliff House,
has seen fit to veto this resolution, on the
grounds that the street fund should be
used on the public streets of the City, and
that Folsom street is a county road in San
Mateo County.
"The South Side property-owners ap
peared before the Street Committee and
convinced them that $2500, previously set
apart for bituminizing Oak street along
the panhandle of the Park, should be ap
plied on Folsom street, where the traffic is
great, instead of expending it on a street
along the park, when all the travel is in
inside the park. It may be of interest to
note that there is no veto on record
against tne appropriation tor Oak street.
Is it because Oak street at this point lies
within the limits of the City, as viewed
from the Mayor's standpoint?
"The facts in regard to Folsom street
are: First.it is in a horrible condition
and has been to for a number of years, the
result of the carelessness and indifference
of our City officials; second, the railroad
has to be reconstructed on Folsom street,
which necessitates the raising of the street
to the official grade.
"Third, there is a public necessity for a
good thoroughfare leading out of the City,
and Folsom street is the best suited as to
location and grade for such outlet. Over a
third of this street is already bituminized.
After a continuous fight of months on the
part of the property-owners, supported by
the entire press of the City, the Board of
Supervisors has become convinced that
it is better, as a matter of economy as well
as necessity for the business and traffic of
the City, that the street should be repaved
throughout.
( "It is to be hoped that the Board of Su
pervisors will not sustain the Mayors, as
such action would be a damper on real
estate values and the spirit of improve
ment in the South Side district."

That is Priceless and Exceedingly Cheap.
Rheumatism, Catarrh, Blood Diseases, Chronic Afflictions, Dyspep-

Tracey, California, is a bustling, bright, energetic little place, and its people are
law-abiding and God-fearing. There are many romances and dark tragedies in con-
nection with Tracey, but it is the Tracey of long agoâ not the Tracey of the hour.
Among its representative citizens is he who is so nicely shown with his family. They
are happy, joyous people, for they have good health and they know how to keep it
It was not always thus. It was but a short time ago when Mr. Sprott Deane languished"
and sickened. Try as he did no relief came to him. He was in despair. He was never
sick enough to give in, but just well enough to be around, although he kept up hero-
ically. Just when his troubles became most irksome he commenced using the blood
laxative, Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
Day in and day out, before breakfast, dinner and supper, Mr. Sproit Deane went
according to bottle directions and took Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla.
He improved steadily. He became stronger and stronger, until now he is so de-
lighted with the effects of Joy's Vegetable Sarsupariila that his sensitive nature cives
way and he joyously tells the people of California that Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is
a good liver and kidney regulator; tine for the bowels, and that it never ieaves any
unpleasant taste or feelings. There are those who would be for getting you to take a
substitute. Don't you do it. Don't let any druggist talk yon away from good health
tind that is really the embodiment of California's favorite family remedy Joy's Vege-
table Sarsaparilla. It is really a very cheap treatment-f 1 per bottle. Go by "the bottle
uirectiouSi
W. McEwen, I. Schwartz, G. L. Center
and Dr. T. A. Rottanzi, constituting a
majority of the executive commttee of the
Improvement Clubs, met in Dr. Rottanzi's
office, to discuss the situation. The fol
lowing communication was given for pub
lication :
Strange how the smallness of human nature
crops out even in High places. Our Mayor, for
instance, shows his shallow and small nature
in spite of his desire to chine as a philan
thropist and a great man before the people.
While he presents to the public a yvhoie column
declaring the injustice of placing the Pest
house on the Almshouse Tract, because of the
injury it would do the occupants of the Alms
house and the people ol the Mission and South
San Francisco districts, still he is in favor of
leaving the Pesthouse where it is and let the
people Qf the Mission ami South San Francisco
suffer for the next twenty-five years, as they
have in the past.
His first objection is that the Almshouse
Tract is about the geographical center of thÂ«
City. If tlie Pesthouse is placed there it will
scatter disease over the thickly populated por
tions of the Mission and South San Francisco â
showing as it were a great solicitude for these
sections.
The value of the taxable property on the
South Side out as far as Twenty-sixth street, ac
cording to the Assessor's books, is $96,000,000.
The location ot the Pesthouse on the Alms
house Tract will depreciate property valnes in
this district at least 5 per cent, which would
be a loss to the City of $480,000.
His fifth point is that ambulances carrying
patients to the Pesthouse must pass for several
miles through some of the best parts of the
City and along Golden Gate Park and the chil
drens'playgrounds.
He takes the pains to write a whole column
of matter denouncing the Pesthouse being
placed on the^lmshouse Tract ( and still is de
sirous to expend $500 on the old tumble-down
rookery that has been rotting for a quarter of
a century and is unlit for hogs. He sympa
thizes with the unfortunate inmates of tho
Almshouse, but is satislied to .leave the old
rookery for the- unfortunates. He has no re
tfpect or sympathy ior the taxpayers on $90,
--000,000 who reside in the South Side or Mis
sion districts. It is all wrong for the property
to depreciate 5 per cent if the Pesthonse goes
on the Almshouse Tract, but it does not trouble
him if it depreciates 20 per cent with the Hos
pital and Pesthouse where they have been for
the last twenty- five years, with the ambu
lances of both institutions passing the very
doors of that district for a distance of two and
a half or three miles, where we have about
40,000 children passing to and fro at all hours
of the day.
Such sympathy, such philanthropy deserves
contempt, especially when it is taken into
consideration thiu his Honor the Mayor owns
the property surrounding the Almshouse Tract.
He shows his sympathy for the South Side
and Mission districts by vetoing the only ap
propriation made for their benefit. He thinks
$35,000 too much to be spent in bituminizing
Folsoni street, but he is in favor of spending
$30,000 in surveying the sand dunes *nere
there are not more than a dozen houses in the
whole district. He did not object to spending
$52,000 in bituminizing Onk and Fell streets,
adjoining the panhandle. There is little travel
on these streets, the traffic being nearly all
within the park.
He talks about the $96,000,000 assessed val
uation of the Soutn Side and Mission districts,
which yielded in taxes over $2,000,000. What
have they got out of this? Our good City Fathers
allowed us $6500 for a sewer on Fifteenth
street, built to carry the overflow from the
park district; also $1000 for the improvement
of South Park, making $8000 in all.
Nine months ago the property-owners real
ized that Folsom street must be repaired from
Nineteenth to the wharf, on account of tho
settling of the roadbed and the changing of
the horsecar line to a trolley system. Hence
clubs were organized and committees ap
pointed to wait on the Board of Supervisors to
induce them to provide for the repaying cf
Folsom street in the tax levy. Part of this
street has been paved with cobblestones for
forty years and a portion with basalt blocks
for tweuty-five years. No portion of it has
been repaired to any extent during that period.
No appropriation for this work was made.
Efforts were then made to have part of the
$500,oot) set aside for the maintenance of
streets appropriated to Folsom street. Tho
Supervisors unanimously agreed to spend $35,
--000 in bituminizing the street, and if it had
not been for the action of our philanthropic
Mayor, the work would have been started
within twenty days.
We now appeal to the Honorable Board of
Supervisors to stand by the South Side and
Mission districts, and override the unwise ac
tion of the Mayor.
Another meeting of the executive com
mittee will be held Tuesday evening. -Â«^

Event.
LOGAN REGAINS HIS SPEED
The Flood Hurdle Stake Gathered in
by Cicero, a 15 to i Shot in the
Eetting.
When early risers awakened and saw
more rain falling they thought how kind
Providence is to the rich, and in their
minds pictured Millionaire Walter Ho
bart's great mud horse, Bright Phoebus,
ealloping in for the Rancbo del Paso
stake. He didn't do anything of the sort,
and his failure to do so cost the race
going: public, as well as his owner, thou
sands of dollars. The stake mentioned
was one of the two special attractions of
fered by the California Jockey Club on its
programme yesterday. It was for three
year-olds of 1895, over a mile and a six
teenth, with a puaranteed value of $1500 to
tho winner. The other, the Flood stake,
was for the jurn ping-horse division, two
miles over eight hurdles, with $1200 as the
prize lor the fortunate horse.
The downpour of rain again left the
track in a sloppy condition and the
: scratches Were numerous. The attend
ance, considering the threatening aspect
of the weather, was good, and the betting
livelier than for some time past.
The usual reverses followed in the wake
of the favorite, but three out of seven jiet
tii)Â£ to the wire in the lead. Middleton,
winner of the last race, was backed down
from 50 to 1, and those "in on the know"
made a mild "killing."
Although shouldering 127 pounds, the
talent looked upon Bright Phoebus in the
nature 'of a "pipe" for the fiancho del
Paso stakes, and when even money was
posted against him in the opening betting
his friends flooded the ring with coin.
Gradually the price was swiped to 7to 10,
but a rumor paining credence that he had I
warmed up lame in his preliminary gallop, i
again sent his odds back to evens. A j
second plunge was made, and 7 to 10 were :
the prevailing odds around post time. A i
well-known plunger's money forced the !
odds against imp. Star Ruby down from
4t03t0 1. The Elm wood stock farm were
in some demand at -V,.,. with a straggling |
play on the o:ily other starter, Arnette, at
It and 15 to 1. The race needs little
description, for it was virtually an 'eend
to "eend affair. Doggett on the imported
horse made play for tbe lead from the flag- I
fall, and passing the stand tiie first time
was slightly behind Instailator with Dog
gett riding him hard. At the first turn
he gained his point, and turned into
the back stretch a length clear of the
Brutus horse. From this on, there was
practically but slight change in the posi
tions, Star Ruby maintaining his advan
tage throughout and passing tne wire a
good length ahead.of Installator. who had
held on to second place throughout the
running. Tlie favorite, wiio seemed to
lack his usual showing of speed, and on
which Miller was seen to be urging before
half the distance had been covered, was a
fair third. Sam Doggett rode the winner
in his usual masterly fashion, being
praised on all sides by the critics.
The Flood stake resulted in a grand
upset. Most of the coin went in on April,
St. Urandon, Carmel and Janus, the latter
horse being a slieht favorite in the bet
ting. The chances of many of the starters
were kiiled off at the post, there being a
tedious delay of over half an Hour, during
w-hich the spectators- manifested their dis
approval by various sorts of demonstra
tions. Gold Dust headed the field for over
a mile, when Carmel showed in the lead.
The latter horse piloted the vay until
nearing the bend for home the second
time, when J. Owens en Cicero assumed

and finished in the ruck.
Seven ordinary sellinp-platers started in

choice. He led from flag-fall, winning by
four lengths, with Belle of Stonewall in
the place, about the same distance ahead

Notwithstanding the poor showing made
by Logan in Friday's handicap, he was
backed off the boards to win the six and a

winner. Taking the lead from Moderocio,
a 20 to 1 chance, turning into the
stretch, he came home a handy winner by
two lengths. Peter the Second was a bad

IN THE LAND OF THE KURDS.
Dr. Catharine Scott's Story of a Journey
to Nineveh.
Mrs. Catharine V. C. Scott, M.D., enter
tained a party of physicians ana other
friends at her home, 727 Geary street, last
evening by telling them the story of her
tour of Koordistah with a caravan.
Dr. Scott is the daughter of a mission
ary who lived at Seir, Persia, which
was her native town. Although the trip
was taken many year 3 ago she has a dis
tinct recollection of all the details of the
journey through that Asiatic Tyrol.
It was an interesting story told in an in
teresting way. Her description of the
mountain-walled home of the savage
Kurds brought up a vivid, mental picture
of the wild fastnesses of the land. She
told in graphic style the story of the visit
tv Nineveh's ruins, populated by jackals
, and hyenas, and the narrow escapes from
: the depredations of the robbers. There
| were descriptions of perilous ascents of
almost perpendicular rocky walls and of
| crossing the swaying hempen bridges
I across well-nigh fathomless chasms.
j Tragic incidents in the journey were the
j death from fever of one of the women
I missionaries in the party and the fate of
j the native who was stung by a scorpion.
The story closed with the word picture
of the funeral of the missionary in a rude
little Kurdish viliage.
Dr. Scott's guests were Dr. and Mrs. J.
S. Ballou, Dr. Laura A. Bland, Dr. and
Mrs. William Boericke, Dr. and Mrs. C. B.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896.
THE RIGHTS OF MINERS.
Judge Beatty's Important De
cision in the North Star
Case.
MR. LINDLEY GAINS A POINT.
Defendant May Back Up Its Claim of
Extra Lateral Rights With
Its Patent.
A decision of great importance to min
ing interests was rendered by United
States District Judge Beatty of Idaho yes
terday, sitting as a Judge of the United
States Circuit Court at San Francisco. It
was in the case of the Carson City Gold
and Silver Mining Company against the
North Star Mining Company. The suit is
for $825,000 for ore taken out by the North
Star people from beneath the surface area
of the property of the Carson City com
pany during the three years preceding
September, 1894.
Both companies own adjoining prop
erties in the Grass Valley district, Nevada
County. Evidently the Carson City com
pany has proceeded on the theory that its
property rights extended downward in a
perpendicular line regardless of the natu
ral course of veins. It seems, however,
that Congress has passed laws providing
for extra lateral rights, which permit
mine-owners to follow from the apez the
natural course of their ore-bearing veins
even though it may incline beyond the
perpendicular of the boundary line of an
other's property.
In this case the question of extra lateral
rignts, however, was somewhat obscured
by the question of whether the owner of
the extra lateral rights should be per
.mitted to introduce his mineral land
patent as evidence of those rights.
When the suit came up before Judge
Beatty for hearing last Wednesday 'At
torneys Ellis and Dickson of Salt Lake
City, on behalf of the Carson City Com
pany, objected to the admission "of evi
dence offered by the North Star Company
to sliow that it had simply followed the
natural course of its vein.
The inclined shaft of the North Star
mine extended downward to the 2400-foot
level and from there quite a number of
minor shafts and drifts were tunneled.
The North Star people represented that in
sinking their shaft they were dome no
more than tukiug advantage of their ex
tra lateral rights by following their vein.
The shaft developed into a veritable net
work of burrowihgs beneath the surface
area of the old Irish American mine,
which had become the property of the
plaintiff.
The evidence was in the nature of a
series of elaborate models, charts and
diagrams made from surveys of Charles
E. Uren. Judge Beatty yesterday over
ruled the objection of the attorneys for
the plaintiff, and allowed the evidence to
be introduced. It was a great victory for
Curtis H. Lindley of this City, t: c princi
pal attorney for the North Star mine, ami
it may indiciate that the suit will termi
nate favorably to his corporate client.
But apart from the question of lateral
rights which is yet to be definitely deter
mined the value of a patent as conclusive
evidence is a matter of absorbing interest
to the host of miners and other land
owners. Judge Beatty settled this point
yesterday. He remarked in commencing
his oral opinion that the principle in
volved was a novel one and he had no
direct guiding precedent to follow.
The North Star mine's title was based on
a patentâ a consolidation patent â applied
for in 1869 under the law of 1866, but not
issued until the act of 1872 was passed.
This patent covered 3140 feet of the North
Star lode, with surface ground of irregular
form, covering an area of about sixty-rive
acres. As the law of 1866 permitted the
holding of an original claim on a lode to
the extent of only 3000 feet it was manifest
that the company had secured title to
numerous clainis by purchase and had in
cluded them all in the one application,
and the patent was issued for the entire
property without specifying the com
ponent parts. In deciding the patent to
be conclusive evidence of the facts in
volved Judge Beatty said:
In view of the numerous adjudications as to
the invulnerable character of a patent, I will
avoid the appearance of egoiism by any
lengthy discussion of the subject. It is well
settled, however, that by any collateral attack
there are very few open avenues for successful
assault upon a patent. It is itself an open and
indisputable declaration of the existence of all
those facts and of the performance of all those
acts which the law declares are the conditions
of its existence. There may have been no dis
covery of a ledge, the locator may not have
been a citizen, he may have neglected to per
form any oi the vital acts which constitute his
right to a patent, but it declares to the con
trary, and we cannot contradict it.
When the Supreme Court in Smelting Com
pany vs. Kemp, 104 U. S., refused the inspec
tion of the land office record, upon which the
patent was issued, which was offered for 'tho
purpose of collaterally attacking the patent,
It in effect held that the patent was tne evi
dence that its-holder had regularly and fully
performed every- act which the law demanded
to entitle him to his patent.
It seems the established doctrine of that
court that collateral attack on a patent can
succeed only when, upon the face of it, it is
void, or when the Land Department has in
some way exceeded its jurisdiction. But it
must be far exceeding it 3 authority or juris
diction upofc some ground as a matter pt law
as distinguished from errors committed in its
conclusion of facts.
As to the validity of the patent Judge
Beatty next proceeded to show by refer
ence to the Supreme Court decision that
though the law of 1866 limited the dis
tance along a ledge that can be included in
any one claim to 3000 feet, neither it nor
the law of 1112 put any limitation upon
the number of claims or length of lode that
could be included wiihin any one patent;
in short, there was nothing to prevent aii
owner from patenting all his purchased
locations under one patent along with or
separate from his original claim.
S"o far as the question of lateral rignts
went Judge Beatty practically anticipated
thfi possible final outcome of the case. All
the claims composing the North Star pat
ent were located anterior to the act of
1872. As already stated the proceedings
for the patent were commenced under the
act of 1866 and the patent was issued after
the enactment of the law of 1872. Section
2 of the act of 1866 provides :
That whenever any person, or association of
persons, claim a vein or lode ot quartz â¢ â¢ *
it shall be lawful for said claimant or associa
tion of claimants to tile in the local land office
a diagram of the same, so extended laterally
and. otherwise as to conform to the local laws
customs and rules of mines, and to cuter such
tract and receive a patent therefor granting
such mine, together with the right to follow
such vein or lode, with its dips, angle's and
variations, to any depth.
On this as a basis Judge Beatty made a
declaration respecting extra lateral rights
for which the following partial condensa
tion may serve as a syllabus:
It is evident that what the statute granted
was the ledge. There was no direct grant of
any surface ground, but only of such as the
rules of mines allowed. It was not required
that either the boundaries of the claim or the
course of the ledge should be marked out.
It is well established that the miner could
foilow his ledge along its course wherever it
might run for the distance he claimed and
located it, the only direction given by the
statute being that he would follow it into its
dips, angles and variations to any depth
which meant directly downward.
The reasonable conclusion deduced from the
law was that his underground ownership of
the ledge must be limited by and within two
parallel planes drawn at right angles to the
general course of the ledge, at the end of it.
Now, ihe miner, in pursuing his ledge between
the planes of his end lines as he has last laid
them upou the surface, may expect at anytime
to meet any number of other miners who are
likewise pursuing their rights. As the law of
2872 is thus far construed, one more destruc
tive of mining interests could hardly be framed
Kepriou 9 of the act of 1872 expressly pro",
vided that any rights then existing should not

be affected, so that under the law of 1866 a
miner had the right to follow his ledge to its
full extent along its underground course on
its true dip to any depth. Such right con
tinued after the act of 1872, ior the law
granted the ledge, and the surface rights were
mere incidental appendages for more perfect
enjoyment of the chief grant, the ledge.
It seems, however, that the authorities con
clude that tho right to follow the course of the
ledge is controlled by the patent lines and tbe
right to follow it under the surface by the end
lines, but if his patent is procured prior to the
law ot 1872 or entirely under that of 1866 it is
not evident why his end lines must be parallel
or why the underground rtghts must be gov
erned by those end lines as fixed in his patent.
The law it-self made no such provisions.
In conclusion Judge Beatty reasoned
that it had not been necessary for the de
fendant to change its end lines and obtain
new patents. To do so would have been
simply to conform its lines to a right
already granted to it. The consolidation
of all its claims under one patent in effect
accomplished whatever result the plaintiff
might have reasonably demanded.
In his allusion to the usual construction
of the act of 1872 and the confusion of
riehts which has resulted therefrom,
Judge Beatty remarked that it was most
unfortunate that the dissenting opinion of
Chief Justice Waite in the Elgin case, 118
TJ. 8., could not have been justified under
the law and adopted.
STREET SPRINKLING,
Business Men Demand That the Super
visors Take Action.
The delay of the Board of Supervisors in
making arrangements for the sprinkling
of the streets as soon as the rains shall
cease has caused the Merchants' Associa
tion to send the following communication:
To the Honorable Board of SupervisorsâGen
tlemen: Herewith we respectfully submit a
petition signed during the past three days Dy
825 representative business firms of this City,
requesting your honorable board to carry into
effect at the earliest date the system of street
.sprinkling proposed by thifi association and
heretofore adopted by "your board, for which
the necessary funds have been provided and
are now available.
The entire mercantile and tax-paying portion
of San Fraucisco stands ready to sign this pe
tition, but we deem it unnecessary to present
your board with any additional evidence of
the importance and justice of this request.
Hoping thac this matter will have your prompt
and favorable consideration, we remain, etc.

Y. M. C. A. VICTORIOUS.
The Football Team Wins a Game From
Mount TainalpaU Military Academy.
Tfce Y. M. C. A. football team added an
other victory to its list yesterday after
noon, defeating the Mount'Tamalpais Mil
itary Academy eleven at San Rafael by a
score of 18 to 6. Plate, for the Y. M. C. A.,
did himself credit, and showed hia tre
mendous power in bucking the line and
breaking the interference of vhe academy
boys. In this he was well assisted by Da
vidson and Frank Bishop. The ground
being wet and soft was too slippery for
fast playing, but the Y. M. C. A. boys
played their backs for their bucking game
and never failed to gain the required dis
tance.
The academy boys played a hard, fast
game, but were clearly outclassed. Moyer,
Schmidt and Hogg were most oonspicuona
for their good work, the latter scoring the
touchdown.
The Y. M. C. A. team is anxious to get
on a match with some club in Stockton,
Santa Rosa or other place whose average
does not exceed 137 pounds for Washing
ton's birthday, February 22. Challenges
may be addressed to A. J. Morrison, mana

The Junior Order of American Mechanics

from all parts of the State, who will assem

A committee has been appointed to ar

VTHOLESALE BURGLARY.
Three Stores Entered, but Nothing la
Secured.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. I.â Burglars
went through three stores on. Washington
street last night, and from the manner in
which they operated it is thought it is the
some gang who ransacked six stores in
Alameda two nights ago.
The burglars entered an alley in the
rear of the Blake block and entered by the
the rear windows. They entered the La
Mode millinery store and secured $1 in
pennies and a few stamps. An entrance
was made by prying up a window with
jimmies. The next entrance was made
into the New York teastore next door. A
rear window was unfastened and the
thieves went in and took 65 cents from the
cash drawer. The last place entered was
the Oakland sLoestore.
To enter the slioestore much ingenuity
was shown. The burglars found a ladder
in an adjoining unfinished building, but it
was too short to reach the ground. They
got a rope and tied it to the ladder, which
they then lowered from the window. By
ascending this ladder hanging from the
building in course of construction they
were able to pry open a window and enter
the shoestore basement, but could not get '
into the store proper. The police think
the burglars must De sailors as they were
so nimble. . .
TIRED OF HER CHARGE.
Mrs. Manning Thinks the County Should
Care for John Rogers.
OAKLAND, Cal., Feb. I.â Mrs. A. Man
ning of Third and Jefferson streets took
compassion on the old centenarian and
offered him a temporary home after read
ing tixe story of his abject poverty in The
Call. For five days she has practically !
forced the old man to accept the hospi- !
tality of her home, but as she is not very
well endowed with this world's goods she
thinks the Supervisors should take the old
man in charge.
Yesterday a member of the Catholic
Ladies' Aid Society visited the miserable
barn where Rogers lives and gave him a
bed and some clothes, but as he is utterly
destitute he needs food and attention
daily. "I have reported his horrible
place as a nuisance at the City Kail," said
Mrs. Manning to-day, "but nothing has
been done. The Catholic Ladies' Aid
helped him some, but he needs to be
placed in some home to end his days. He
is 104 years old, and it is a shame that he
is not provided for. My husband and I
have done what we but we are a long
way from being rich and we feel that we
have dene our part."

CHAOS AMONG TEACHERS.
The Annuity Fund Is Not Being
Collected and Somebody
Is to Blame.
The Banks Are Anxious to Get Rid of
the Funds That They Have
Held Back.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 1. j
A crisis has been reacfied in the matter
of the teachers' annuity fund that is of
interest to every teacher in the State, as it
affects not only the safety of money
already contributed, but also their chances
of benefiting by the provisions of the law
in the future.
A meeting of the Oakland teachers was
held to-day and the matter was thoroughly
discussed. The idea seemed to prevail
that the officials who were charged with
the duty of collecting the 2 per cent each
! month from the teachers refused to do it,
claiming that the law was inoperative. It
was also stated that in San Francisco the
law seems to be working fairly well and
that six teachers are now receiving their
monthly pensions. On this showing it
appeared that the officers in Alameda and
other counties must bt; delinquent in their
duties.
The practice in this City has been for
Superintendent McClymonds to stamp on
! -each warrant, "Deduct 2 per cent for
! teachers' annuity fund." This money was
j intended to be retained by tiie County
Treasurer when he paid the warrants".
Tnis Treasurer Sanford refused to do un
less County Superintendent Garlick col
lected it and handed it to him in a lump
suru. Garlick wouid not do this and there
was a deadlock and many of the teachers
were forced to stop paying because no one
would take it from them.
There is still another complication. For
many months of the year the funds are
in such condition that the banks cash
I nearly all the warrants, and when they
have clone so they have always retained
the 2 per cent, and they have it yet. They
want to give it to somebody, but nobody
will receive it.
By Sanford refusing to receive it the
teachers now claim that they are delin
quent and cannot partake of tne benefit of
the fund not draw out what they have put
in. Tne banks have aiso stated "that they
will return it to the teachers if it is not
taken by the officials. One of the High
School teachers made a formal demand on
Superintendent McClymonds a few weeks
ago to cease stamping his warrant, but he
declined.
The teachers submitted several questions
to the City Attorney regarding the mut
ters. They were as follows i
"If the payments to the fund are stopped
will it debar the teacher from entering the
fund when the law is modified ?"
City Attorney Peirsol says "no."
"How can a teacher stop at any time?"
"They never stop; the payments once
started are compulsory."
"If they do stop can they get the money
back?"
"No."
Teachers are therefore afraid to take
their money back from the banks, and
City Treasurer Giipin has stated that they
will not accept it after this month. City
School Superintendent McClymonds has
refused to stamp any more warrants and
the whole affair is in a state of chaos,. with
the teachers' money and interests at stake.
At to-day's meeting one teacher from
each schooi was appointed a committee to
find out how many of the teachers bad no
tified tfie Superintendent that they would
accept the terms of the act and what they
owed to the fund. The meeting adjourned
to March 7, when the committee will re
port and an attempt will be made to for
mulate some course that will protect the
interests of the teachers.
BAUK OP ENGLAND NOTES.
They Are Never Beitaucd and Are Al
ways Crisp.
No note out of the 50,000 or 60,000 now
issued daily is ever issued twice. If, as a
depositor, you should draw any amount
in notes at the bank and pay them back
into your account ten minutes afterward,
they would be canceled.
So, also, any notes received by you from
any other bank in London are always new
ones, crisp from the Bank of England
presses of the day before. The' signatnre
is cut off immedia ely after a note is paid .
in; and the cancellation department pro
ceeds to file them in their regular order,
taking notice and keeping account of all
notes which have not been returned.
One of the curiosities of this department
is a Â£25 note which was paid in after be
ing out 111 years. The Dank note library
is also here with albums containing old
bank notes of very large amounts, with
the names of noblemen for whom they
were issued. There is also the Â£1,000,000
bank note, a bit of paper which in its day
was worth $5,000,000 and was issued for
convenience in closing an undertaking of
unusual moment.
The records of this department are of
invaluable assistance in checking forgery,
and. the canceled notes, which are kept for
a period of about rive years before being
burned, are constantly under examination
by Scotland Yard detective in search of
stolen money, or other people whose notes
have been lost. The strange stories of
single notes which this department can
furnish are many, and are ready-made
plots for any num ber of romances, but they
are too numerous to be told in this article.

THE OPPOSITION AT OAKLAND.
Business Men Who Say They Want to
Have Some Other Dredging
Done First.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 1, 1896. f
Dr. J. T. McLean, who has long been iden
tified with the work of the State Board of
Health, has gone to Washington as a dele
gate of the Harbor Improvement Associa
tion to urue the necessity of finishing the
work on the tidal canal. Before starting
he met with the opposition of some of the
interested business men.
The trouble all arose out of Dr. McLean's
memorial to Congress, which has the sig
natures of a great many men of Oakland
and Alameda, though some of the signers
now declare that they are opposed to it and
did not understand its purport when it
was presented for signature. There were
present Dr. McLean, President Mantlel of
the City Council, President M. J. Keller of
the Board of Trade, Edson Adams and J.
P. Taylor. They had arranged to meet
Dr. McLean and discuss his memorial
with him, as they were doubtful as to its
meaning.
Exception was at once taken by Mr.
Manuel to the plan outlined by Dr. Mc-
Lean which ignores the lower part of Oak
land Harbor proper and provides for a big
appropriation for the Alameda and
Brooklyn districts.
The first objection was raised to the
name of Dr. McLean's document. He has
captioned it "A plea of one hundred thou
sand people, based on important sanitary
and economical reasons, for the speedy
completion of Oakland Harbor."
Edson Adams denied that 100,000 people
were in need of this appropriation as a
sanitary measure and objected to the re
flection cast on Oakland. If Alameda
needed it that city only represented 15,000
people.
Dr. McLean was greatly surprised to
find that Mr. Manuel had signed the me
morial without knowing what it meant.
Mr. Manuel said he was opposed to it and
had signed it because he had understood
that it was for the general improvement
of the harbor. He. urged the doctor to
leave his memorial with them and to
make no further use of it. This Dr. Mc-
Lean declined to do, but said that he
would not present it unless assured that it
was the sense of the community.
Dr. McLean had drawn up his memorial
to Congress, and had taken it for granted
that 100,000 people would call him blessed
for it, and. at the last moment, these men
repudiated it, and hinted tnat the doctor
was working more in the interest of the
town of which he was an official than of
Oakland. Then to crown all, he was asked
to leav-e his memorial at home, so as not
to make it necessary for another memorial
to be sent contradicting his document.
Then another matter was brought up.
Dr. McLean asked what could be done
toward his getting that $250 that the Coun
cil offered to appropriate, but which tne
Auditor refused to pay. Very little en
couragement was received, and all the
doctor could hear was advice about leav
ing his memorial behind.
Dr. McLean went to Washington last
night and his memorial weÂ»t with him
and now the Oakland men who are op'
posing him are going to reach Congress"
man Hilborn with the view of seeing thai
Dr. McLean does not inadvertently tarnis,:
the rating he gave himself before the par
ticipants at yesterday's gathering.
Dr. McLean head 3 "the movement to
have the tidal canal dredged out as a sani
tarj' improvement, and the value of the
canal for that purpose has not been pub
licly questioned.
The railroad company has always op
posed the canal completion, according to
the general understanding of the matter,
and it is expected that its representatives,
at "Washington and Oakland will follow
out the present fight to it on the lines of
the opportunity afforded by the Oakland
men who are eager to have the lower part
of the harbor thoroughly dredged out be
fore completing the canal.
The men who do the dredging at Oak
land harbor say that the lower channel
will never be kept from filling up until the
canal is constructed, and that the dredging
in the lower harbor will all have to be done
over and over again.
Dr. McLean has gone to Washington,
and will conduct his tight at hre own ex
pense.
It is anticipated that a movement in
support of Dr. McLean's measure will be
inaugurated immediately. The people of
Oakland are in favor of the completion of
the canai and the general completion of
the Oakland harbor improvement plans;
but some of the business men, like Edson
Adams and Mr. Taylor, have pre erty or
business interests which make it desirable
for them to have the lowtr portion of the
harbor dredged before any other work is
done, and the railroad interest is to delay
the caral-dredging as long as possible and
nave the improvements made where they
will be most useful to the company.
ALAMEDA'S NEW CITY HALL
All of the Municipal Officers
Have Moved Into Their
Respective Quarters.
What the Alameda Preachers Will
Preach About To-DayâPo
lice Affairs.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. Iâ AH of the
municipal officers excepting the Recorder
have moved into the" new City Hall and
taken possession. It was intended to have
a public reception, dedicatory exercises
and a banquet coincident with the formal
occuDancy, but the work of paying the
vestibule had not been completed, and as
that is of considerable moment, so far as
the show-off is concerned, the ceremonies
had to be postponed. The front door will
be thrown open and the general public in
vited to inspect the big building on Febru
ary 11, from 9 in the morning till 5 in ihe
afternoon. Every resident of Alameda
who is at all interested in his town and its

with electric lights, inside and out:
An appropriate order of exercises has
been arranged, and the printed pro
grammes will be unique in shape, like the
building itself, with a picture of it printed
in tint on the cover, and the names of all
the officials, together with figures and sta
tistics regarding the construction of the
hall, are among the contents, as well as
the programme of exercises. The pro
grammes will be elaborately printed and
will constitute a souvenir of the occasion.

MUCH SLASHING OF RATES
What the Statements of Rival

The Effect of Competition Has Reduced

One-Half. '>.[â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 1. â¢ j
The two rival water companies have
â¢filed their statements with the City Clerk,
from â  which the rates i for the ; next year
will be computed by the Council. 'V- ;
The figures are of great interest, as they
show for the first time -just what business
each of the rivals is doing. That there has
been some heavy cutting of rates is clearly
apparent, for while the Contra Costa Com
pany's list of ratepayers is about the same
as last year their receipts are only about
one-half as large. The old company now,
serves 8700 houses and the new Oakland
company 7000. The income of the new
company was $90,641 and of the old $183,736.

There is much speculation as to how the
rates will be fixed. The law f authorizing
the fixing of rates never contemplated that
there might be two companies in one town
and a literal interpretation of its provisions
would mean that the cost of the two plants
be added together and the rate fixed so as
to pay.6 per cent on the total , amount j In
vested in water j plant. fc The â¢ Council will
not ;do this, but j| neither Jdo they .* as yet
know what they are by law required to do.
.Crystal Gazing.
In various forms it is very widely dif
fused. The Hurons used water; the
Maoris, blood ; the Egyptians, ink (as
every one knows). Glass balls are at
present popular, and we have read about
one gentleman who "'scried" in a brass
doorhandleâ but he was insane. On the
other hand a sane lady has done marvels
in a glass Sauterne ! Unless a large num
ber of reputable persons are fabulists, star
ing into a clear depth does produce (in
them) hallucinations liie the "hypnagogic
illusions" with which many people are
famil : ar. On this little-regarded fact in
psychology the whole superstition of
crystal gazing, with its invocations and
fumigations, its "calls" and its camphor,
has been baaed.
The late Dr. Mayo would have num
bered this among the truths involved in
popular superstition; but in the supersti
tion of the evil eye no rare or obscure
phenomenon of human faculty seems to
be concerned. It is a widely diffused
fancjy, no more; but as to the exact ranpe
of its diffusion, outside of Europe, Islam,
the region of the Semitic races and India,
we remain uncertain. The presence among
savages of amulets used in the Old "World
against the evil eye only raises a pre
sumption in favor of the belief itself. For
â wnat is good against the evil eye may
also be good against Vuis, Brewin, Mrart,

THE ANNIE PARKER CASE.
No Reason for Belief That the
Young Woman Has Gone
East.
A LETTER FEOM MRS. WOODS.
The Latter Is at Her Old Home in
Maryland and Will Go to
Work There.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. X. )
John F. Woods, the rnaa who was a
friend to Miss Annie Parker, the missing
dressmaker, denies that his wife is trying
to secure a divorce from him ana that.
Annie Parker has probably gone East to
be a witness in the case. "When asked
about the matter he said:
"My wife is not thinking of doing any
such tiling. Here is the best proof of
what my wife is doing," and be handed
his visitor a letter postmarked at Em
mettsburg, Md., only a week ago. One of
the passages read as follows:
I am praying to God that he may deliver you
from the demon of drink that is now destroying
your manhood. lam still with my folksand
am looking' for ah opportunity to do some
work, as I am without a dollar and I do not
like the Idea of living on charity.
As soon as I can earu some money I will send
you some, as I know you must need it! I am re
gaining my strength and hope that there may
yet be some brightness in our future. Your
loving wife, Jennie.
"Does that loolc as if she wa3 seeking a
divorce?" asked Woods. "As to Annie, I
can only say what I have- said already, that
I fear she has carried out that old desire of
hers to meet death, but as to entering into
a conspiracy with my wife to help her get
a divorce, that story is cruel."
The police say that tney are confident
that Woods haS had nothing to do with
Miss Parker's disappearance. They are
â¢41so BurÂ« that the Parker family has not
told all that they could tell regarding the
actions and behavior of Miss Parker be
fore her disappearance.
Albert Paiker, the Drother, said to-day
that he was certain his sister was not alive,
but beyond that he would not speak.
A letter was sent to each of the local
papers on Friday suggesting that Miss
Parker and Mrs. Woods nad arranged to
meet-in the East, where Mrs. \VOOd3 might
obtain a divorce. The letter was not pub
lished in this paper.
SPEAK-EASIES MAY OPEN
Berkeley's Liquor Ordinance
â¢ Declared Unconstitu
tional. .
Work on the Campus Commenced.
Rodgers* Case Not Endedâ A De
structive Fire Avoided.
â 
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. I.â Berkeley's
liquor ordinance was to-day declared in
valid by Judge Frick and the way is once
more open for "speak-easies" to resume
operations. Judge Frick's decision was in
the appealed case of George H. Strieker,
who was recently convicted of storing
liquor without a license, the charge being
one growing out of the numerous raids on
the private liquor-dealers of East Berkeley
made by Marshal Lloyd last October.
A State law prohibits the selling of
liquor within a mile of the State Uni
versity, but it has been decidedly ineffec
tual up to last year, when a Berkeley
ordinance was passed making it unlawful
to store liquor without a license and au
thorizing the Marshal to enter any estab
lishment in which he might suspect that
liquor was kept.
The ordinance was framed so that the
strict regulations as to the storing of liquor
appeared as precautions against fire, but
the real intent was to give the Town Mar
shal authority that woulH enable him to
see that the State "mile limit" law was
not violated.
Acting under the new ordinance, Mar
shal Lloyd made a number of raids on the
11th of last October,;and as a result George
H. Strieker, A. Berg, Joseph Doran, Fred.
Fonzo, Mrs. Silvershille, Mrs. Thompson,
Jacob Lentz and John Higgins were ar
rested nnd charged with storing liquor
without a license, liquor being found in
each of their establishments by toe Mar
shal.
The charges against ell of the parties
named rest ui>on the same grounds as that
against Strieker, and the success of his ap
peal from a conviction will result in a dis
missal of all the other cases.
Judge Frick decided that the regulations
of the ordinance prohibiting the storage of
liquor without a license are unconstitu
tional. His decision leaves the liquor sit
uation at East Berkeley as it was six
months ago, and unless the State officers
take more vigorous steps to enforce the
law than they have in the past, there ia
nothing to nrevent the reopening of the
"speak-easies" in which liquor has for
many j'ears been clandestinely sold in
East Berkeley.
The First Blow Struck.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. I.â The first
practical step toward the consummation of
the plans of Regent J. B. Reinstein to lay
out the university grounds with new walks
and drives was taken to-day. Several of
the large evergreen trees near the proposed
Center-street entrance to the grounds were
felled by the university workmen.
The large ovpress at the turn in the road
near Lovers' lane fell beneath the stroke
of the woodman's ax. The trees all along
the> route of the new walk have been
blazed to direct the course of the wood
choppers, and nearly all Dr. Hilgard's
plants along the course have been removed
and transplanted in other sections of the
botanical gardens.
The students are awaiting with anxiety
the call of Regent Keinstein to take up
the pick and shovel . and begin work.
Meanwhile the co-eds are discussing the
practicability of serving lunch to the
"student iabbr" brigade. The majority of
the.m, however, seem to favor the idea of
letting the boys get their sandwiches and
coffee througn some other source.
May Have More Trouble.
BERKELEY, Cal,, Feb. 1. â Harry
Rodgers, the academy student who had
five university boys arrested last week on
a charge of battery, the cases against
whom were dismissed yesterday by Judge
James, stands a chance of coming into
further pnbLcity. To-day several of the
supporters of the college men who were
more or less implicated in the affair ex
pressed their intention of prosecuting
Rodgers for libel nud defamation of char
acter. Though the Judge in rendering
his decision stated that he believed from
the testimony presented that the col
legians were in a state of perfect sobriety,
while one of the strongest points offered
against them by Rodger^ was to the effect
that they were intoxicated, the univer
sity men feel that the statement of the
Judge and the winning of the case were
insufficient, and consequently have threat
ened'revenge on their accuser.
University Boating.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 1.-Boating
promises to form more of a feature in uui
versity athletics during the coming season j
than at any time heretofore. Though the |
accommodations at the clubhouse in Ses- i
sions basin, on the Oakland estuary, are |
not so complete as they were before the
two destructive fires took place, yet the
newly erected house furnishes ample room
for the housing of boats, barges and sculls
owned- by the association. Nearly every
afternoon a large number of students go
from Berkeley and Oakland for practice m
the new sculls. This afternoon all the
boats owned by the club were in use, and
several members of the old crew, among
whom were Cole, Trew, Easton and Mor
row, were out in their rowing costume.
A Dangerous Blaze.
BERKELEY, Cat,., Feb. 1.-A small
blaze, which at one time threatened to
destroy one of the principal blocks of
Berkeley, occurred last night at East
Berkeley station in the dressmaking parlor
of Miss Hansen on the corner of SHattuck
avenue and Center street.
The fire is supposed to have been caused
by a pet doe which was left in the room
with a lamp. The lamp was overturned
and exploded, causing a conflagration
which burned the carpet of the room and
several articles of furniture. The blaze
was smothered by blankets by R. L.
Taber and Mr. Starr. The loss is estimated
at $20.

DR. PRESTON'S CRUELTY
Grave Charges Against the Phy
sician Are Made by
His Wife.
Mrs. Preston, Once a Society Belle,
Driven to Beg From Public
Charities.
Dr. Walton H. Preston, the well-known
physician, was sued yesterday by his wife,
Mary B. Preston, for a divorce. The com
plainant accused the doctor of almost in
credible cruelty and desertion.
And this is the sequel to a.brilliant event
in society at Saginaw, Mich., not quite ten
years ago, when Dr. Preston Jed his beauti
ful bride to the altar. There followed a
brief spell of happy wedded life, the young
couple occupying a prominent place in San
Francisco social circles.
The dream was only a dream after all,
for this happiness was like the existence
of a butterfly, and Dr. Preston and his wife
dropped out of the gay whirl. Then fol
lowed the dissensions in the physician's
home that are now alleged to have cul
minated in cruel treatment, family jars,
desertion and the helpless wife knocking
at the doors of the Associated Charities
and of Masonic benevolence to save herself
and her two little children from starving.
Such is the story related in Mrs. Pres
ton's appeal to the courts as set forth in
legal language, and even more is told
therein.
Dr. Preston has elegant offices at 20
O'Farrell street, but for a year or more has
not maintained a domestic establishment
in his wonted style, having taken up the
retired life of a bachelor in apartments.
His wife declares that he receives a large
income from the practice of his profession,
and she believes it to be at least $500 a
month. Yet she is compelled to live with
her two children in indigent circum
stances, depending upon the assistance of
public charities for support.
The Prestons* were married June 9, 1886.
The issue of their union was WaJton, a boy
of 9 years, and Marguerite, now 3 years of
age.
Mrs. Preston charges that her husband
for more than a year past has failed to sup
port either the children or herself, not
even with the common necessaries of life.
She has during that period been compelled
to depend on the charity of kinsfolk and
friends, while the husband has been earn
ing large sums of money. She goes even
further, claiming that she has been forced
to apply to' the Associated Charities and
the Masons of San Francisco for support
for herself and the children in order to
procure food.
All her jewelry had to be pawned, and
her mother, living with Mrs. Preston, had
to sell and pawn her effects to keep the
wolf of hunger from the door. The laun
dryman refused to return her garments
because the bill for washing was refused
payment by the doctor.
With regard to cruelty Mrs. Preston ac
cuses her husband of treating her in "a
cruel and inhuman manner many times,
so often that a record of times and dates
would fill a volume"; also of calling fcer
vile names, which she hesitates to men
tion. The vulgar language, she says, was
part of her daily life.
She was accused of unchastity and other
crimes. Many days she was compelled to
go without food for herself or the children,
particularly in March, 1594, when the
doctor gave her 15 cents in one week to
buy luxuries for the table.
Once the infant child was exceedingly
sick, but the doctor would not attend it,
although he fed the babe on raisins
secretly until its life was despaired of. At
another time, in June, 1895, the older child
was injured in the knee, but the father
refused to care for the little boy; who had
to be taken to tho* public hospital for
treatment and relief.
Several dates in 1894 are quoted as occa
sions on which the doctor abused, threat
ened to stab, insulted, assaulted and re
viled his wife. Once, after calling her vile
names, he threw her down upon the floor
and left her back and srfÃt blue from
bruises inflicted by him in his fit of pas
sion. Again he vilely insulted her and
accused her of disreputable conduct, and
in August, 1894, the wife was beaten and
frightfully bruised. She claims to have
been in fear of her life in addition to suf
fering intensely in body and mind through
his brutality. "In the end the doctor de
serted his wife, leaving his family desti
tute.
Mrs. Preston wants the custody of her
children, wants alimony and expenses oi
court, as well as a divorce.
America's Opportunity on the Seas.
When war was renewed in 1803 between
England and France the rule of 1756 was
again asserted by Great Britain as binding,
while indirect trade between neutral ports
and the ports of an enemy was again al
lowed, but under the new proviso that the
, neutral ship did not on her out ward, voy
age furnish the enemy with goods contra
band of war.
This privilege of indirect trade was in
valuable to American ship-owners, and for
two years the ocean commerce of- ail Eu
rope was in their hand.'. The fortunes
they thus accumulated were enormous,
while Great Britain saw her own manu
factures displaced by those of Continental
nations, and the colonies of her enemies
prospering as never before.â "Life of Na

tances of the wreck and the death, cen
sures the company and iis watchman in
the. following language:
We further find that the washout causing
the wreck in which the. deceased was killed
was due to the fact that the railroad culvert
of the Southern Pacific Company at the place
was not of sufficient capacity to carry off the
flood of water, and that John Murphy, the
Southern Pacific watchman, was guilty of
criminal yitgligence in not flagging the trains
after having been warned of the dangerous
condition of the track in that vicinity.
There were three witnesses heard yester
day â Charles L. Gill, fireman on the
wrecked train ; Mr. Culverwell, resident
civil engineer of the coast division of the
road, and C. L. Harber.
Charles L. Gill, fireman on the wrecked
train, testified as follows:
Train No. 19, on which I was firing, vai
wrecked between South San Francisco and
Baden station at about 0:10 p. m., caused by a
washout. I had no warning -of danger before
the train was in the washout. Engineer Keyer
said to me before starting from San Francisco:
"We have ordtrs to look out for sand at Indus
trial School, between switches at Ocean View
and the cemeteries." I saw some one standing
on my side of the track, the left side, in the
wagon-road near the first switch from this
place going toward Baden station, with a
switchlight in his -handâ that is a lantern with
two white and two red sides to it. He wag
standing not more than five feet from the rail
road track. He made no signal.
Any motion made by the person at that time
and place would have caused us to stop. He
made no motion nor did he give any signal to
stop. I looked back at him until we turned
the curve and I could no longer see him, and
all the while he remained still. When I first
saw the light I thought it was on the swiich-
Btand, as it seemed to be about the right place,
and the white light was exposed. I did not
know it was on my side of the train until the
pilot passed and then I saw that some one was
holding it. When we passed him I saw the
red light, which was toward and at right
angles to the track. Had the red light been
exposed or displayed as we approached the
switch, I would have told the engineer that the
swith was wrong, and the train could have
been stopped.
I told the engineer about seeing the light,
and he immediately applied the airbrake*.
He then asked mÂ« if it was a red light, and I
told him it was a man holding a switcn-light
with the white side exposed, but I said, "We
had better run slow, anyhow." He gave the
brakes a little more air and started the train
up. Usually the switch-lights are in place
when No. 19 reaches Baden, but sometimes
the switchman is putting them in place, and
our natural conclusion at seeing the man by
the track was that the switchman was waiting
till the train passed to put up the switch-light.
A man who has worked on a railroad any con
siderable length of time should know enough
to give a danger signal. A light raised up and
down is ordinarily a signal to go ahead, but
had we Seen a light moved that way that
night we wouid have been apprehensive and
would probably have stopped.
At Baden station I was on the lookout.
From Colma it is down grade, and the fireman
has little work to do until Baden is passed. I
am sure I would have seen any kind of signal
at Baden station. The regular danger signal
is to wave a light or in daylight any object
across the track. We were running about six
miles an hour when we ran into the washout.
No rails seemed loose at the approach to H.
The night was murky and the headlight did
not light up the track any distance ahead.
When the engine went over I suppose the rails
were carried with it.
C. L. Herbert was recalled and testified
that from inspection h.e believes the
groa.id has been filled at the scene of the
wreck some two or three feet by the recent
storm.
The resident engineer of the coast divi
sion of the Southern Pacific Railroad testi
fied as follows:
I have charge of the track, bridges and
buildings of the coast division of the Southern
Pacific Company. I passed over the line be
tween South San Francisco and Baden stations
on the Saturday night preceding the wreck and
between 10 and 12 o clock Sunday morning
and the track was then in good condition. A
truck-walker passes over each section of the
road once each day. He uses a velocipede in
going over. his section* The section men in
time of stormy weather are required to be on
duty and ready to turn out at any time of the
day ot night. I think the culvert near where
the wreck occurred is large enough to carry the
water under any ordinary circumstance.
I cannot state what the height of the em
bankment was in the vicinity of the wreck
when that portion of the road was constructed.
Ii; is the duty of any employe of the railroad
knowing of d&r.ger to give warning or signal
the engineer. The track has been overflowed
before, but there has never 'been a washout
prior to this. The section of track walked at
this end of the line is from Valencia street to
San Mateo. It has never been the practice on
the coast division to have regular foot track
walkers. Every section is patrolled each day
either by the gang on the handcar or a man
specially detailed.'
With this the jury retired and found
the verdict as given above.

A Stubborn Patriot to Whom This Coun
try Owes a Great Debt.
In a storied burial-ground in Frederick,
"in his narrow bed," sleeps one whose
name never fails to stir the heart of the
old Marylander with lively emotions of
admiration and affection â Governor Tom
Johnson, that audacious and stubborn
patriot, of whom John Adams said
that he was one of four citizens of Mary
land and Virginia "without whom there
would have been no Revolution,"
although, in affected, scorn of him,
a British officer, writing to his people
at home, had assured them "there is no
need to be alarmed by all this noise
in the colonies, wnich is mainly made
by a man named Tom Johnson." "That
pestilent rebel", of the British War Office
was the trusty, loving friend of Washing

mander-in-chief of ail the armies of the
United Colonies; member of the first
Congress and of the convention which
adopted the constitution of the Unit-d
States; first Governor of Maryland and an
associate justice of the Supreme Court; and
he was twice urged to accept the portfolio of
Secretary of State. He was in liis day the
first citizen 01 Maryland, and in ail the

BROWN DECIDES
NOT TO PREACH
Undesirous of Creating Dis
sensions Among the
Church Members.
MRS. BROWN EXPLAINS.
She States That Mattie Overman
Is Under Her Particular
Protection.
LETTERS TO MRS. COOPER.
Expressions of Commendation and Sym
pathyâThe Author of the Stock
ton Charges.
Two persons, most prominent in the
First Church trouble, had a complete
change oi heart yesterday.
Dr. Brown, almost at thÃ last moment,
decided that he would not occupy the
â pulpit to-day, and Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
found that she could not conscientiously
again hear him preach, and therefore de
tided that she would not attend the ser
vices if the accused pastor occupied the
yulpit. Her change of purpose was caused
by the receipt of two startling letters
within the past lew days.
In view of the many aspersions that
have been made on the retention of Miss
Overman under the roof of the pastor who
Las been accused jointly with her, Mrs. C.
O. Brown yesterday made a brief state
dent to the public explaining the situ
ation.
Among the significant developments of
the day was the visit of the deacons and
trustees to Dr. Brown with a petition re
questing the pastor not to occupy the
gpulpit of the First Church, but to which
petition the pastor refused to make any
reply till he had prayed over the matter
end consulted his attorney.
Letters of commendation and sympathy
continue to pour in upon Mrs. Cooper from
.all parts of the State, as well as from resi
dents of this City. Interesting excerpts
from a number of these are given else
where. They serve to indicate the wide
nprea'd interest that prevails in the matter
(â¢in and out of church circles.
are pending between Mrs.
"Davidson and Carroll Cook, and there are
â strong indications that the accused woman
iwill be defended by this well-known crim
inal attorney.
Dr. Brown had a consultation with J. .T.
Valentine yesterday concerning the fraud
ulent "Valentine" letter, and was made
cl.id by obtaining the opinion of Mr.
Valentine that the forced communication
â¢was not written by the same hand that
ipenned an authenticated letter written by
J-the pastor.
: It also developed yesterday that Mr.
; "Warren's name is appended to the charges
ililed with the standing committee against
[Mrs. Stockton.
BROWN NOT TO PREACH.
But the Pastor Is Determined to
Preserve Ail His Legal Rlffhts
in the Church.
Â» <~Dr. Brown has decided to refrain from
in the pulpit of his church to
,day. This action wa9 taken, so it is
iclaimed, from a desire to prevent any dis
isensions amone the members of the church.
! But Mr. Brown does not intend to relin
quish any of his legal lights as pastor of
the Eirst Church, nor does he propose to
ff>!ace himself under any obligation to the
Jchurch authorities. He will seiect the
âºâ¢"supply" and will defray any extra ex
ipenses incurred by his failure to till the
duties of his position.
His action was the result of deep delib
eration, and was not due, it is alleged, to
jany pressure brought to .bear oh him
feither by the deacons, the standing com
iciittee or the trustees, though it iainown
.that all but a few of the gentlemen referred
<o joined in a strong petition to the pastor
asking him not to preach to-day.
The unfortunate minister will, however,
iattend the services with his family,
i Professor R. R. Lloyd will occupy the
! pulpit of the First Church to-day.
jAS TO MATTIE OVERMAN.
!Mfs. Brown Says the Woman Is Un
der Her Protection and Will Be
[\ Till No Longer Needed.
i Â£â¬t was made public lo the several news
paper offices last evening, that Mra. C. 0.
jÃrown bad a statement to be given out
jfhrough them to the public. In response,
â¢'Call reporter rang the door-bell at 1703
fGeary street, a little later. The house was
dark save for a little rim of light around
the blind of a room on the upoer floor.
Presently there was a thin, small, muffled
voice from behind the unopened door, that
[when it could be understood, inquired:
"Who's there?"
The answer being given the door opened
â¢warily, just enough to admit of an en
velope being slipped through.
[ "This is the statement," said the voice.
"It is contained in this. That is all."
The man on the outside touched but did
not take away the letter. "Tell me," he
eaid, "if Dr. Brown is to preach to
morrow?"'
"Take this," said the muffled feminine
voice. "I can tell you nothing more."
The letter was about to drop on the out
side. The door closed and the voice still
talking became unintelligible.
The statement was from Mrs. Brown. ' It
was very brief. It is as follows :
I wish the public to understand that Miss
Overman is in my home under my protection
by mv own invitation, and she will remain un
til all proceedings requiring her presence are
over - Mrs. C. O. Bbown.
Dr. Williams says Dr. Brown made the
reason of Miss Overman's stay at bis
bouse perfectly clear to him.
"He told me," said the pastor of Ply
mouth Church, "that M.ss Overman was
detained by order of court, as she was an
important witness in the Davidson case."
A call at the District Attorney's office
brought forth information which will
doubtless be a. surprise to Dr. Williams
himself. It was stated that as Miss Over
man did not appear at the preliminary
hearing she could not possibly he held by
an order of the cpurt to appear at the
trial proper.
VISIT THE PASTOR.
Deacons Endeavor to Persuade Him
Not to Preachâ Dr, Warren's
Position.
Neither the deacons, trustees nor stand
ing committee seem to be sure of the line
Dr. Brown xviJl follow to-dayâ that is, as
far as concerns his appearance in the pul
pit of the First Congregational Church.
..^Yesterday sereral members of the stand*
ing committee, who are deacons, visited
Dr. Brown at his home on Geary street
and for over two hours argued and then
pleaded with him not to attempt to preach
to-day.
It was pointed out to him that the con
gregation was already seriously divided
and that if he continued his defiant atti
tude it would wean certain people from his
standard who were already hovering near
the other side.
The reverend gentleman listened pa
tiently and courteously to all that was
said and then in firm but polite tones told
the visitors that he would follow his orig
inal programme. He explained that it
was absolutely necessary to do this in
order to protect his legal rights.
Judge Louderback had put the situation
very plainly before him, and he could not
do other than follow the advice of his
counsel.
Then the visitors tried another tack.
They pleaded with the reverend gentle
man to forego a little of the wisdom of his
attorney and accede to the wishes of the
dissenting members of his church, who, in
spite of their opposition, were still a part
of nis flock.
Regardless of all that had gone before
and what was probably yet to coire, it was
ritrbt that the pastor for harmony's sake
alone should forjret a few of his legal richts.
This sort of argument Beemed to make
some slight impression on Dr. Brown,
though he was careful not to commit him
â¢self either way. He told the visitors that I
he would carefully consider all that had j
been said, though lie would not undertake
to give a.n answer before to-day.
"This was as far as Dr. Brown could
go," said one of the visitors, "and. as he
expressed it himself, his conscience would
not allow him to take such a step until he
had prayed over the matter, *vnd again
consulted his attorney."
Deacon Dexter, when asked yesterday if
Dr. Brown would preach to-day, said :
"I really do not know positively, though
I understand that he will. He has not
consulted me about it, and so I know ab
solutely nothing."
The standing commit cc has not as yet
been officially notified of the desire of a
member of the church to have Mrs. Stqck
ton's record investigated. Dr. Warren, for
many year 3 connected with the Congrega
tional missions, is the author of the re
quest, and it is not his purpose to allow
the matter to oe tabled, as svas a similar
demand on the part of Dr. Brown some
months ago.
The demand for an investigation was
handed to Deacon Barnard with the re
quest that it be given to the chairman of
the board. Ho far this has not been, done,
and if Deacons Dexter and Barnard are
correct there is every probability of its
never reaching that bod}' in an official
way.
"Dr. Warren handed me hi 3 written de
mand for an investigation of Mrs. Stock
ton," said Deacon Barnard last night,
"and we had a long talk about it. It
was finally agreed to leave i(- to the wis
dom of the standing committee as to
Whether it would be wise to institute an
inquiry of that kind at this time or wait
until â well, until after Mrs. Davidson has
been heard.
"The committee will not meet until
Wednesday night, and the matter will be
suggested to the members at that time.
If it is their wisdom to go ahead, then Dr.
Warren's written protest will oecome an
official document. Personally I do not
think the matter of sufficient importance
at this time to authorize a special meeting,
and that is why I have not turned it over
to the secretary or chairman. lam of the
opinion that the matter will be tabled."
Dr. Warren's friends resent the imputa
tion that he will allow the standing com
mittee to convince him that it is wise to
postpone the investigation into Mrs.
Stockton's alleged falling from grace, and
incidentally blackmailing Dr. Brown. He
proposes to see that they take it up at
once, and any delay on their part will sub
ject them to no little trouble.
The prayer meeting next Wednesday
night promises to be fully attended, and if
indications are to be believed, replete with
dramatic incidents. Dr. Brown has given
it out that he intends to officiate on that
occasion, whether it pleases certain mem
bers or not.
These "certain members" are equally
determined that he shall not lead. Thfs
opposition movement is led by many of
the most prominent women of the church,
and now that Mrs. Cooper has taken such
a determined stand they propose to up
hold her. One lady stated yesterday that
a set of resolutions strongly condemning
Dr. Brown would be presented at the meet
ing and a vote by roll-call demanded.
These resolutions have not yet been
drafted, but a committee will be at work
on them to-morrow. This movement i 3 in
direct opposition to that headed by Deacon
Barnard. It will be remembered that at
the last meeting this gentleman offered a
set of resolutions expressing confidence in
the pastor and indorsing the policy ne had
pursued.
APPROVE MRS. COOPER.
An Extraordinarily Strong: Line of
Letters Indorsing the Kinder
garten Teacher.
Mrs. Cooper came to the determination
yesterday that she would after all not at
teud the First Church to-day if Dr. Brown
preached. Her change of neart was by
the receipt of two letters â one coming yes
terday and the other the day before. In
speaking of the matter Mrs. Cooper said:
"These two letters have strongly affected
me and have made me feel that it would
be better not to go. I could not con
scientiously hear him preach." In con
clusion she stated that she would take her
usual Bible class, however, and would at
tend every business meeting.
One of the strongest stimulants to Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper in her present trying
position is found in the large number of
letters she receives daily commending her
for her stand for '"truth," "Christianity,"
"justice," "the church," "womanhood,"
and, in fact, all that goes to make up in
tegrity in. character of man or woman.
Each epistle received is promptly an
swered, whenever name and address is
given.
She was found yesterday busily at work
answering a very large mail that had come
to hand containing further words of cheer
and encouragement.
"Would you have any objections <o giv

was asked.

replied Mrs. Cooper, "and I cannot reveal

writes this:
1 see by tho evening paper I)r. Brown has
dodged behind a lawyer again ! And the "abso
lute explanation nbn est inveiltus. "Legal"
advice? Well, it savors more of law than of
gospel (John xi :39), and if the pastor's reputa
tion does come forth in newness of life after
Jour days, or four- months, it will be little
short of a miracle. And if it should appear,
after all, that he is innocent from the great
transgression, I hope his own bitter and sore
experience will tend to purge him of the ruf
fianly brutality that he evinced toward Pro
fessor Herron. â¢ â¢ â¢
Well, truth is mighty and "the eternal years
of God are hers."
A gentleman who stands very high in
public esteem, both in the church and out
of it, writes:
May God help my dear friend ! You have
done nobly in the cause of truth, virtue and
the cause of Christ and the church.
I thank God I wag spared the pain and dis
grace and humiliation of your insult by the
church you so greatly honor by your member

by no means proud of my connection with the
first Congregational Church, but as a 'member
I offer you an humble apology for conduct that
would disgrace a Buckley primary.

degrading drama, "There is a God in Israel!:"

MRS. DAVIDSON'S CASE.
Her Attorneys Are Not Desirous of
Having It Delayed-The Joint
Committee to Testify.
Owing to the failure of the short-hand
reporter to rile his transcription of the tes
timony in the Davidson preliminary hear
ing it has been impossible for the District
Attorney to file an information against
the accused woman. The last pages of
the testimony were filed only a few day 3
ago. The prosecution has until February
9 to take this step, and it may now be
looked for any day. It is understood that
the attorneys lor the defense are anxious
to have the case come to trial at an early
date, despite the fact that Dr. Brown is
desirous of deferring the meeting of the
council to try him till after the trial of
Mrs. Davidson. It is also learned that Dr.
Brown and every member of the joint
committee are to be put on the stand and
be asked to explain in detail their reasons
for seeking to force the trial of Mrs.
Davidson in a criminal court in advance
of that of Dr. Brown before an ecclesiasti
cal council.
It was stated some time aeo that Judge
Bahrs would have the Davidson case as
signed to him. The latest report is that it
will go to Judge Wallace.
WROTE TO CARROLL COOK.
There Are Strong Indications That
Mrs. Davidson Will . Employ
Him In the Case.
Negotiations are pending between Mrs.
Pavidson and Carroll Cook with a view to
having the latter handle her case when it
comes up for trial in the Superior Court.
Some time ago a friend of Mrs. Davidson
called on". Mr. Cook and made overtures for
his services in the case, but Mrs. Davidson
was unable or unwilling to meet the pe
cuniary conditions. Mrs. Davidson has
now opened negotiations direct and the
same obstacle prevents the arrangement
being consummated.
Another condition is a.lso exacted by Mr.
Cook before he will take the matter in
hand. He will require that all other at
torneys be first paid their fees in full and
that he have sole charge of the case. He
asks this on the score of professional
ethics. Mrs. Davidson has requested him
to call on her at the County Jail, but he
declined.and will not comply until she is
without other counsel. There is said to be
some prospect, however, that he will be
her attorney when the case cornea to trial.
THE VALENTINE LETTER.
According: to the Judgment of the
Bank President It Was Not
Written by Dr. Brown.
Energetic steps were taken by Dr.
Brown yesterday to remove all suspicion
of his having written the "Valentine" let
ter. On Thursday he wrote Mr. Valen
tine, denying the authority of it, or that
he had inspired it, and yesterday he made
a personal call on Mr, Valentine at thelat
ter's office.
A comparison of the fraudulent letter
and that written by Dr. Brown to Mr. Val
entine induced the latter to express him
self in the following words : â 
"I have no hesitation in saying that, in
my judgment, the two letters were not
written by the same hand."
SCHISM PREDICTED.
Deacon W- H. Brown Talks Freely
of the Situation In the
Church.
William H. Brown, the member of the
First Congregational Church who insisted
at the stormy prayer- meeting last week
on knowing whether the rastor would con
tinue to fill the pulpit while the case
against Mrs. Davidson was pending and
until he had himself been tried by a coun
cil, is not really entitled to the "deacon"
which people attach to his name, unless
"once a deacon always a deacon", is
applicable.
He was a deacon in a Congregational
church in the State of New York a few
years ago, and has since been a member in
good standing in the First Congregational
Church of this City.
He was persistent in his demand for an
answer to his question, for upon that de
pendeu his vote on the adoption of the
resolutions. If the pastor had expressed
an intention of remaining in seclusion un
til such time as he should be invited to
appear before the nublic eye, Mr. Brown
says he might have concluded to vote for
the resolutions. As it was, he will veto
them as far as his ballot is concerned.
"I think Mrs. CooDer's stand was a
noble one," he said." "The hisses that
greeted her were from Dr. Brown's
friends, and I am informed his son, Val
entine, started them. The Young People's
Society of Christian Endeavor is doing a
noble thing, in my estimation. It may
lead to a schism in the church, but I fear
that will come at any rate.
"Before I knew Dr. Brown well I used to
quote him so frequently that I came to be
called 'Dr. Brown' by my fellow-employes.
The past few weeks I have been protesting
very strongly against that nickname,"
said Mr. Brown dryly.
"Dr. Brown's course would lead us to
believe that he would sacrifice his own
good name as well as that of the church in
order to convict Mrs, Davidson. He should
be reminded that there are other interests
to be considered besides those of
himself and the alleged extortionist. 1
reminded him of this fact in a letter which
I wrote him after the prayer-meeting. I
thanked him for his honest answer to my
question, but advised him to reconsider it
for his own sake as well as that of
the church. I told him that since the
church waived its right to a council which
it might call immediately if it chose,
he should consider the wishes of a great
number of bis congregation and waive his
right to the pulpit for the present."
BACON INDEBTEDNESS.
The Pioneer Printing Firm May Settle
With Creditors at Forty Cents on
the Dollar.
The Bacon Printing Company that suc
cumbed recently to competition and un
prosperous limes and turned over its
effects to settle an indebtedness of $16,000,
has been filially completely sold out.
I. Zellerbacb, trustee for the numerous
creditors, has just cleared up accounts

About $9000 was received from the sales.
Wa?e claims amounting to $1200 bad to be
paid first. Then there were other ex

It is estimated that the creditors will re
ceive from 25 to 40 cents on the dollar.
Chutes and Trolleys.
The new excitement of "tripping the trol
ley" is attracting many devotees, and ladies,
strange to say, are the principal patrons. The
young aeronaut, Miss Millie Viola, who haa
been unfortunate in her attempts to ascend
for the last two Sundays, will this afternoon
make another attempt. If there is no rain to
day, however, she is confident of making a
clever air voyage and landing. The chutes
are also attracting much attention.

OF CPHVINTINGTON
"O reader! Had you in your mind
Such stores us silent thought can bring,
O gentle reader ! you would find
A tale in everything.
What more I have to say is short,
And you must kindly take it ;
> It is no tale; but should you think,
Perhaps a tale you'll make it.''
Poverty Hollow was rightly named. It
is the place in Connecticut where Collis P.
Huntington was born and educated, but in
a general way its productions are meager.
I know the region well, for it is over
looked by my native hills. It has also
been overlooked by Mr. Huntington since
he grew rich, for people about there might
like to get somebody to pay off their home
stead mortgages.
In youth I roamed through woods and
fields and streams that Huntington had
known; the magnate's sliding places and
Bkat.ng ponds became mine. Huntington
had fished where I fished, and as vainly.
V>e missed being 'boys together' by half
c hundred years. â 
So it is with feelings of neighborly re
gard that this sketch is written, and with
due.pride in the achievements of my kins
man.
Poverty Hollow is an outlying district
Site of the House in Which Mr. Huntington Was Born.
[From a photograph taken fir "Tlie Call."]
of the town of Harwinton, Conn., and is
situated among the Litchrield hills as
snugly and securely as Sacramento in the
lap of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
Terryviile and Thomaston are adjoining
villages on the south. The first clocks in
America were made at Terryviile, but
Thomaston has gained control of the in
dustry, and at the latter place Hunting
ton obtained the timepieces for his early
peddler's outfit.
There is the wealth of beauty in the
scenery at Poverty Hollow, but lacking is
the wealth that pays taxes. Six poor
though picturesque farms are still worked.
Four rival Bawmills are the delight of
amateur photographers, and anything but
the delight of the struggling owners. And,
yes
still site the schoolhouse by the road,
A ragged beggar vanning,
and the beggarâ town pauper, at any
rateâ is the only surviving schoolmate of
Collis P. Huntington.
Men of the locality remember Hunting

a Farmer.
IFrom a photograph taken for "The Call."}
ton, but only one went with that illustrious
native of the Hollow to the school which is
still preserved.
Hiram Miner would have had the dis
tinction, but he was sent to a neighboring
district. He started out in life richer than
Huntington, and he considers himself
richer yet, in all that is worth having,
though nearly ail others in the Hollow are
poor. If Hiram were in Congress his vote
would be counted against the funding bill.
Erastus Baldwin was "Young Russ"
sixty years ago. He belonged to the
Canipville school wnen the boys of that
institution used to walk down through
Fluteville to wrestle the Poverty Hollow
boys, and he is honored by tradition as
the only youth who could throw yonng
Huntington. He and Mr. Miner own
railways, the little structures on which
| huge logs are run to meet the buzzing
I saws, and they say that they would not
give them up to own the Southern Pacific
and Congress. There isn't any money in
the sawmills, but the owners have opinions
of their own about wealth.
Go down along the brook from Erastus
Baldwin's unshingled, half-boarded saw
mill; follow the road that follows the
brook on its winding way through, the
brush and trees: and you will come to an
other sawmill. That is the Samuel Bald
win placeâ for Baldwins are numerous
among the 'Litchfield hills. Below the
pond where the old wheel turns is the
solid stone foundation of a structure that
is gone.
The vanished building was a millâ the
Huntington mill.
"Uncle Bill" Huntington, or William,
as the natives never knew him, had a
carding-mill there when his son, Collis,
was born. He ran the mill for year? and
he saved money, for when he died, though
everybody thought him penniless, the
retatives found about $3000 stored away.
The pretty stream flows westward from
the Samuel Baldwin place, wiih wooded
hills at the left bank and a sweet little
valley on the right. Down the valley, five
hundred yards or so, a little white school
house marks an abrupt turn of the road.
That is the Poverty Hollow School,
where Huntington repeived his early
training. The outer board covering of the
building has been renewed, and. there are
new shingles, but no other, changes have
been made. So few are the families about
there now, the sons and daughters of the
older inhabitants having lone ago moved
away, that the school is closed.
Just around the corner from the school-,
house and at the west Bide of the road re
poses the farm where Huntington, the
railroad millionaire, was born.
The house is gone. A large stone, one

that couldn't be got out of the ground
without blasting, marks the northwest cor
ner of the rilled-up cellar. The well, on
the side toward the road, remains but a
slight depression in the ground.
Down across the field, however, and
twenty yards or more from the site of the

Early Education.
[From a photograph taken for "The Call."]
J house, stands a rickety, dilapidated collec
| tion of boards and shingles and beams.
That is the Huntington barn, and the
present owner is sentimental enough to
preserve it while paying interest on his
$3000 mortgage. The roof is caved in, the
j sides are open, but it is the barn that the
j Huntingtons owned, and so it will stand
J as long as nature lets.it, or as long, at any
rate, as the present owner can keep the
bank from foreclosing.
Two months ago I roamed again over j
the old region of Poverty Hollow, and the
man who accompanied me was Lyman
Mather, the only one remaining of Hunt
ton's school-fellows.
Mather is several years younger than
Huntington, who is 76, but he is broken
down and feeble. He was a farmer at the
Hollow, but now he is penniless and alone
and he boards with the William Humiston
family at the expense of the town. Har
winton has no poorhouse, its plan being to
"board out 1 ' the paupers.
"I remember Collis Huntington well,"
slowly said old Mr. Mather, as he hobbled
along with his cane. "He's got richer
than 1 have. There ain't many on us left
now; he an' I are about the only ones liv
ing of all that used to go to school down
here.
"Collis is the only one that's ever made
much money. He's made more in a month
than the rest on us have in all our livÂ«s.
The Barn at the Old Homestead of the Hnntlngtons.
[From a photograph taken for "The Call."]
But some on us have done about as much
wort as he has, I guess.
"At school he was a reg'lar harum
scarum. He was a wild sort of a feilow.
He was allus a-stubbin' around barefoot in
summer. I recollect that very well.
'â¢An' he was a reg'lar daredevil. If
there was any danger anywhere around
he would jump right plumb into it, fust
thing. He was allus having trouble with the
teacher. William K. Peck was one o' the
teachers; they was allus at it. Collis was
olaer than I was, and he was a big fellow
anyway, an 1 he looked like a perfect
mountain to me."
"Oh, he was bright enough, but he'd a
good deal rather cut up .than study.
"His father, 'Uncle Bill,' was a queer
sort of a man. He ran the carding-mill
down here. The mill's gone long ago, an'
so's'Uncle Bill. We used to bother him a
good deal, having fun with the old man ;
but one time he up an' took an ol' pistol
an' shot one on us, a fellow named Bid
wellâliked to kill'd him. They had him up
for it. Mrs. Huntington was a prettynice
sort of .a woman. She was very partie'lar
about the family going to Harwinton
every Sunday to church.
"There was a lot of 'em in the family.
Solon was the oldest boy. He got pretty
rich, but not with any help from Collis, I
guesa. He died less than ten year ago.
Collis was the second. He don't come
around here now. Joseph, the third son,
died young. Then there was Rhody an'
Elizabeth an' Susan an' two other girls.
It was a pretty nice family all through,
and Collis, I guess, was about the only one
that seemed to be wild or rough.
"Collis could read an' write an' cipher
when he quit school. Ha quit when he
was 14 an' went to wort at Orson Barber's, j
where Horace BarDer now lives. That's
just above the old Huntington place. He
got $5 a month an' board doing man's
work on the farm. He stayed there two
years an' he- saved every cent that he
earned. That's the way Collia Hanting
ton began.
"There ain't many men that have made
as much money as he has, but he didn't
earn it all at Orson Barber's.
"At 16 he went to peddling notions an'
things. He bought his outfit with the
money he earned on the farm, an' I guess
he had some left. He sold pins, needles,
tape, thread an' little combs that we used
to all want. He carried these things in
two little tin trunks that were, I suppose,
about two foot longr, a foot wide and six
teen inches high. He held one of thesÃ in
each hand, with a strap over his shoulders.
Every two or three weeks he used to come
back, when he had to get a new stock, an 1
he peddled that way for several years, un
til he had about $5000.
"When the gold excitement broke out
he quit peddling an' started for California.
He put his $5000 into whisky, another man
going in with him as partner, an' the cargo
was shipped around the Horn. Collis an'
his partner then started for California by
the isthmus route. I believe the partner
died on the way. Of course the whisky
was wutli consid'dble money when it got
to California; an' about the railroading
and other things you know more than I
could tell.
"Collis* father, 'Uncle Bill,' usedtocome
arouna an' sharpen scissors after the fam
ily broke up. He used to come around an 1
stay over Sunday, kind o' visiting, I sup
pose. That was after his wife hadgone to
live with one of her daughters. Every
body thought he was poor, but when he
was dead they found $3000 or more. He
died about twenty-five year ago, I guess
it was.
"CoJlis has got pretty rich, but if fifty or
a hundred million dollars won't give a
man a little leisure what's the use of hav
ing it."
Mr. Mather, who has nothing but leisure,
went with difficulty about the Hollow and
told of his schoolmate and of the incidents
of his boyhood. Then he turned back
toward the house where the town supports
him, aud as he went he said :
"Yes, Collis has made a good deal o'
money, but he hain't much soul."
"These ol' folks are kind o' gone," is the
way that one of the natives told of the
passing away of Mr. .Mather's generation.
Most of them have "kind o' gone" ' in the
way of their ancestors, and the ancient
churchyard on Harwinton Hill has graves,
that far outnumber the living inhabitants
of the town, except on cattle-show days.
In all the families, however, there are
Huntington traditions, stored carelessly
away in tne minds of the local patriarchs
like the antique, inherited furniture and
old firearms in the garrets. One of these
traditions preserves an incident of the rail
road man's experience as a youthful
Yankee peddler.
"Wiilard Weed o' Wolcottvllle went t'
peddlin' with Huntington/' is the way
that the story is related, "an' I've heerd
Willard tell't himself, They come t 1 a fine
place up in Dutchess County, State o' New
York, when they was a-walkin' 'long 'n'
carryin' their little tin trunks.
11 'I ain't a-goin' in there,' says Willard
Weed. 'Can't sell nothin' 'n a place like
that'n.'
" 'Y'aint?" says Huntington t' him.
'Well, I be. I ain't a goin' t 1 slcip no
body.'
"S' Huntington he started in t' th 1 yard,
carryin' his two trunks "long, when a. man
comes t' th' door, 'n' shouts out t' him,
'We don't want nothin' here.'
" 'Better let me show y' what we've
cot,' says Huntington. 'V' might want
suthin 1 . 1
" 'Don't want to buy nuthinV
" 'V' might want suthin'.'
" 'Told you I didn't, so go 'long. 1
" 'Got everythin' y' want, hey y'?'
'"Yes, Ihev!'
" 'Well, y're derned well off.' "
Huntington may have made mistakes in
his life, but he did not make any when he
chose Hi Miner to pose as a farmer for the
pucpose of buying up land along a coveted
right of way. Mr. Miner is an educated
man, but he can pose as a New England
agriculturist in a way that would edify
and enlighten the most devoted admirers
of Denman Thompson.
It wus many years ago, and this man
was then, as now, right in . his prime.
Huntington was acquiring land for his
Soutnern railroad route, and hia greatest
trouble was in the prices that were de
manded. So he had his surveyors stake
out a fictitious route, and then he sent for
his old friend, Hi Miner, to buy up, as a
farmer, the land that was wanted.
"I went down to New York to see Hunt
ington when he sent for. me," said Mr.
Miner in giving his contribution to the
Southern Pacific history. "He Jived at
that time on the road right alongside of
the tunnel, but I hear he's built himself a
new house lately.
"Well, he wanted me to go with an
other fellow and buy up a lot of land" for
him. He' said he thought they'd know I
was a farmer, and that I'd know about
what land was worth for farming pur
poses. The man going along with me
would know what it was worth to the rail
road. The upshot of it all was, though,
that Huntington decided to build on the
road he had staked out to fool them, and
so 1 didn't have to go. But I had a visit
at Huntington'i, and I naven't been down
to New York since then."
Erastus Baldwin came to California
about twenty-five years ago. he worked
as a section hand on the Central Pacific
Railroad, but never relinquishing his
school-day claim to supremacy in wrest
ling he visited the magnate on a social
footing of equality, and he says that he re
fused to recognize Huntington when he
thought the latter had been drinking.
"Young Russ" has not been so successful
in business as Hi Miner, though the two
are rival sawmill - owners. He is the
philosopher of Poverty Hollow, however,
and among his native trees he finds peace
and comfort, and good timber enough to
give him a living. At 74 years he is hale
and vigorous, and he can wrestle yet.
"Col aiid I were boys together, and we've
been men together," said Mr. Baldwin. "I
haven't anything against Col and he
hasn't anything against me, though I was
the only boy about here that could ever
throw him.
"Oh, yes; we used to have some good
wrestling-bouts in those days. Toe Pov
erty Hollow boys were a big, strong lot of
fellows, and Col was the biggest and
toughest of 'em all. I was going to school
in Campville then, and over there we had
a teacher who was pretty spry and who
knew a good deal about wrestling in a sort
of scientific way. This teacher used to
give us lessons, and I got so that there was
nobody in our school that could handle
me, even if I was the smallest of the lot.
"We got a challenge from Poverty Hol
low, and so we came down here one Satur
day to wrestle it out. Several matches
were tried, and Col got the best of every
body he tackled. Finally he tackled me,
and I gave him the prettiest throw you
ever flaw in your life."
The historian laughed so loud at the
memory of his victory that the hills about
the Hollow laughed with him in their echo,
and a loose board fell from the old mill by
way of applause.
" 'By jingo!' said Col, 'you be a good un
if you be small!' "
And again the peaceful hills became
merry over the battle that they remem
bered.
"I threw him every time he stood up
till he said he was satisfied," continued
Mr. Baldwin, and he paused in contem
Poverty Hollow, With the Schoolhouse on the Left and the Samuel Baldwin Saw
' mill in the Distance.
[From a photograph taken for "The Call."]
plation of his' superiority over the rest of
the world. He added.:
"You speak to Col about that when you
go back to California. Tell him that I
guess I could do it yet."
Once more the man and the admiring
hills laughed, out upon the^ Hollow, and
Mr. Baldwin's ancient horse strolled
around the corner of the mill to see what
the fun was.
"Col has never been here since he went
away," the narrator continued, "but I
went out to California and saw him. He
has a pretty pood property there, I puess,
but I'd rather be pottering away about the
old Hollow here.
"I went out to the mines first, but they
wanted to have me go to work down in a
well 700 feet deep for $5 a day. I told 'em
I wouldn't do that sort of labor for five
thousand a day. 80 I got a job on the
railroad where they were building a line
One of the Little Ponds in the Region Where Huntington Went "Slubbing" Around Barefoot.

[From a photograph taken for "The "Call."]
from San Francisco to San Jose. A man
named Ackerson was foreman â you don't
know him, I suppose. Perhaps he ain't
there now.
"While I was w>th the railroad I went
tip to San Francisco and called on Col.
We were glad to see each other. He of- !
fered me a jotvon. another section, but of
course I didn't want to be under any ob
ligations, so I told him I guessed I'd quit
railroading.
"After that I met him on a railroad
train, but he looked to me as though be
had been out celebrating a little too much
and so I didn't recognize him. I pre
tended not to see him at all.
"When I left the railroad, as I told Col
I would, I didn't know what I was going
to do. But they wanted an engineer on a
steamboat and I made an application, as I
had learned to run an engine atone of the
mills here. I had to go before a board
of experts and answer a lot of questions
before I could get my license.
"They questioned me pretty closely and
finally they asked what I would do under
certain circumstances if the engine would
not work. I told 'am and they said I was
right and that I could take the job.
" 'Now,' says I, 'you've been asking me
a lot of questions â just let me ask you
one or two.'
"They laughed, but they said f*o go
ahead. So then says I:
" 'Suppose things happened just as you
said and you fixed the engine just as I told
you I would, and still it wouldn't work.
What could be done then?'
" 'I don't know, 1 said one of 'em. 'What
would you do?' â 
11 'I'd throw the whole dern thing over
board and quit the job,' says I."
Then the hills made known that they
heard and understood and the aged horse
kicked up its heels and frisked away.
"I went all over California; and down to
Mexico like a fool; and I made a voyage
to the Sandwich Islands. But wherever I
traveled I paid my fare, so that Col
wouldn't think I wanted any favors from
him just because we were boys together.',
Mr. Baldwin told of the difficulties the
are encountered in wresting, subsistence
from the natural conditions in his native
region, but he expressed satisfaction that
his quiet life in the Hollow is better than
anything that Huntington can know. And
his words at the end of the interview were,
as he turned back to the tattered mill:
"If you see Col out in California give
him my regards."
The house in which the Huntington
family resided was a plain little story-and
a-balf structure. The pable end was* to
ward the roadway. A huge stone chimney
was out of all proportion to the rest of the
building, as measured by the modern
ideas of the architects, though quite the
fashion at the time.
Just at the front of the house was the
old well with the tall "pole" contrivance
that added to New England picturesque
ness until a lot of enterprising agents in
vaded the land and induced the people to
adopt a modern invention.
Lyman Mather occupied the house dur
ing some of his better years. Soon after
he abandoned it the building was pulled
down, the cellar was filled up and the site
became a mere part of the ninety
acfe farm. The old well afforded
a burial place for some of the
"stun" that had to be hauled away to
make room for the pumpkins to grow. A
covering of soil was than given and now
the circular depression is hardly notice
able.
Against the relic of the old barn, "down
across the lot," a later barn was erected
years ago. The roof over which
Huntington and the other boys climbed
and chased in the Poverty Hollow
schooldays has been partly broken down
by the snow and storms of many winters,
but the wrecked end of it sways and
dangles, and is a tenacious tribute to the
excellence of the material turned out by
the sawmills of the Hollow.
The farm is a poor one to-day; it was
probably never any better. Most of it is
called meadow land, and grass grows on
it, though the term ".meadow" is there a
little bit of politeness that the farmers re
tain for mutual satisfaction and encour
agement. Much of the stone has been
piled up in long rows, that wili serve as
fences until the world ends. Visitors won
der why so much work was done to divide
a little farm into so many sections â like
building lots on the map of a new Western
city â but the Rtone had to be put some
where, and old wells are not often avail
able.
Though the stone walls are numerous,
and broad and high, there is stone enough
still scattered over the ground to macad
amize a boulevard, and plowing would be
both dangerous and difficult but that the
farmer of the region is skilled in the art of
dodging such obstructions.
The Huntington farm sections that are
not annually plowed up or reserved as
"meadow" are pasture lots and the wood
| land, and the only level bit of ground in
the whole place is where the Huntington
house used to stand.
Poverty Hollow is a quiet, modest
pretty little bit of the New England back
woods, hidden away in the hills, and itÂ»
can only be reached by the most mislead
ing sort of by-roads. It is entirely un
i known to the people five or ten miles
away, and the world would never have
heard of it but for its production of the
man who owns the Western railroads.
Why or when it received its name no '
man in that region of patriarchs can re*
i member, and there is no man in that
region who cares.

HORSES
l /^ m^\^ NB Â°* Jbe . latter-day subjects
ft \\ of which the public hea.rs a great
: IB â¢ â  â¢' II : deal is that of "the passing of the
SaE^/ horse." ; It .is rather amusing,
then, to note in this connection
that the cavalry of the United States is con
stantly in need of good, suitable horses,
and that it is exceedingly difficult to. find
them, Good horses will forever be in de
mand, but the sooner the other kind passes
the . better.' it will be for everybody con

for the cavalry horse. : .Men will never be
able to supplant the equine steed in this
particular with any mechanical invention.
It looks strange that in the whole United
States, where there are over 16,000,000 of
horses, the Government should have diffi
culty in procuring only from 700 to 1000 a
year for its Cavalry service. These, horses,
pi course, are purchased by contract, but
the contractor is compelled to fulfill rigid
requirements, and he not infrequently
emerges from his contracting >, experience

with the lesson of a loss to profit by in the
future.
During last month twenty-eight horses
were accepted at the Presidio, and are now
being trained in the service. These new
horses came from Oregon. The contractor,
perhaps, found that better bargains could
be made up in the Webfoot State, where
horses were a year ago so plentiful that
cayuses were slaughtered for meat, and a
horse-cannins? factory was successfully es
tablished at Portland.
The Government is not particular where
the animals come from so long as they
come up to tne standard.
To be explicit, the model cavalry horse
is in color either bay, sorrel, black or gray,
is sound, well bred and of superior class,
gentle under the saddle, free from vicious
habits, with free and prompt action at the
walk, trot and gallop; without blemish or
defect; of a kind disposition and with easy'

eyes large and prominent; vision perfect
in every respect, phouiders loner and slop
ing well back; cheat full, broad and deep;
forelegs straight and standing well under;
"barrel" large and increasing from girth
toward flank; withers elevated; back short
and straight; loins and haunchea broad
and muscular; hocks well bent and under
the horse: pasterns slanting, and feet
small and sound. Ahorse under five years
old will not be purchased unless he is an
especially fine animal, well developed.
Any animal that does not meet the re
quirements, in every respect will pot be
bought.
According to the cavalry records an
average of only one horse in fifteen has
been accepted heretofore, land it is said
that often thirty or forty horses are passed
by in succession.
From $126 to $250 is paid for a cavalry
horse, a comparatively small price even
for desirable roadsters; but thia is ex
plained by the fact that the cavalry horse
is useless for breeding, and, as a rule, ia
not fast enough to make a racehorse.
In the United States cavalry service
there are ten regiments of twelve troops
each, sixty men to the troop, and there are
over 7000 horses. The average wording life
of a cavalry horse is about fifteen years,
and about 10 per cent of those in the serv
ice die or are discarded every year. Each
cavalryman trains and cares for his own
horse, and no discrimination is made, the
soldier roughing it on the plains getting
Just as good a mount as the soldier parad
ine in the City.
When a horse is purchased it is sup
posed to be already broken to the saddle
or to harness. The animal is then as
signed to a trooper, who puts it\hrorigh a
course of training. . The horse soon recog
nizes him &s its master, and in a surpris
ingly short time obeys bis signals andper
fqrrus its. duty like a veteran. The mowt
difficult tning to teach a horse is to be
come accustomed to the discharge of fire
arms. They get so that the firing of a
carbine near their heads will hardly at
tract their attention.
A soldier trains his horse for about a
month before it is allowed in the cavalry
drills. If a horse is found on inspection
to be in poor condition the inspector is
never in doubt as to the responsible party,
for the soldier who rides tlie steed is sup
posed to oare for it and watch it, and he is
the one who gets the blame if any fault is
found with the management or treatment
of his horse.
Sometimes strong attachments spring up
between the horse and its rider, and a soJ
dier has been known to divide the water in
his canteen with his thirsty steed while out
on a desert.
The "monkey drill," as it is called, is on
interesting sight. The cavalrymen ride
out on the beach at the Presidio, and there
go through any number of maneuvers and
evolutions. They practice jumping hur
dles and wrestling on horseback, rapid
turning, and the animal" is taught to lie
down, in such a manner as to furnish a
protection to the trooper, who aiay thus
tire from cover upon the enemy. The tac
tics are as diverting to the animal as to the
rider, and both seem to enjoy the "monkey
drill."
Horses of one color are given to one com
pany and their names usually begin the
letter which classifies the conpany. Thus,
Company D will have Dandy, Dobbins,
Dickens, etc. The horses soon learn to
which company they belong. They may
all be gracing together in the fields, but
when the bugler sounds the stable call
they will all quickly assemble â the bays to
themselves, and the sorrels, grays and
blacks to their respective commands.
It is said that the Government, not be
ing satisfied with the contract system of
purchasing its cavalry horses, will soon
make a departure by purchasing throujrh
its agents direct from the owners in the
open market.
When a horse becomes unfit or unde
sirable for service he is turned out im
mediately, and on advertised days these
animals are auctioned off to the' highest
bidder. The examination of a horse by
the inspecting board and veterinary sur-

THE PACIFIC-UNION CLUB
More Talk of a New House for
the Wealthy Insti
tution.
A Season of Great Prosperity and
Good Dinnersâ The Presi
dent's Leg.
At the Pacific-Union Club there is still
talk of a irew building, but the members
who wantrÃ new clubhouse are said to be
in the minority. It is acknowledged that
the present establishment is a very ex
pensive one to maintain, and that a great
savfng could be effected if the club were
housed in a building of a different plan.
The Paeinc-Union is enjoying a season
of prosperity. Although the coat of ad
mission is S2OO and the monthly dues are
$10 for each member, many candidates for
membership are registered.
Mr. Crawford, the present manager of
the Pacific-Union, ia regarded by leading
members as one of the most capable man
agers in the United States, yet under his
immediate direction the restaurant is con-
ducted at a loss of $800 a month. This
however, cuts a small figure in the estima
tion of the members. It is their idea that
the dinner at the Pacific-Union should be*
up to the standard established by Del
mo nico of New York.
In the wealth represented by members
c ollectively there are but few clubs in the
world surpassing the Pacific-Union, and
as they have tbe money to pay for the best,
they want the best that the market can
pro duce.
The members of the club never get ex
cited over the event of an .annual election.
In fact the annual election is not much of
an event, as the club is governed by a board
of fifteen directors, five of whom are chosen
annually. This boai'd elects the president
and appoints the standing committees.
The important officer of the club is the
chairman ol the house committee, and that
position is now held by Alfred Bouvier.
Ihe president is Joseph Crockett, but the
president does not rule by any means. As
a general proposition what the house com
mittee says goes, and if the president can
bring some influence to bear on this com
mittee he may be able to exert some power
in the direction of ciub affairs.
The Pacinc- Union as an institution does
not aspire to club fame. It has no literary
aspirations to gratify, no. artists to re
ward and no writers to punish. One news
paper man is a member of the club and
SCRUTINIZING A NEW ARRIVAL
[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
what he says of literature, anoient or
modern, is accepted straightway as the
law and gospel of the institution. One
day he pronounced the decree, justly too,
that Carlyle's Cromwell Was great litera
ture, and straightway Millionaire Blank
asked Multi-Millionaire Dash, "Have you
Carlyle's Cromwell?" The latter re
plied, "I suppose, I have it in my library
at home; I have everything there." "You
are fortunate," observed Mr. Blank, "for
the oracle says it is a great book."" Tne
knowledge of possession was sufficient,
and the millionaires dined.
Ab far aq one can observe, the legs of
Joseph Crockett, the president, are of uni
form length, yet the club gossi > goes that
the president had one of them pulled in
London when he invested |3000 fn cham
pagne. Harry Veuve is accepted as the
club authority on champagne, even as the
solitary newspaper msn ig exalted as the
guide in literature. Veuve did not com
mend the London champagne, and so 100
cases, a quantity quite in excess of the
president's demands for private consump
tion, remain unbroken. To depart from
Harry Veuve's judgment on wine would
GETTING INTO THE MARCH STEP
[Sketched by a "Call 1 ' artist.]
be too dangerous an innovation for a con
servative institution to countenance. The
president's enterprise in seeking in foreign
lands a wine of superior quality may be
appreciated, but hrs example in seeking to
usurp the prerogative of Veuve cannot in
a spirit of conservatism be commended by
the club.

Ashmore, considering ber "aa a compan

You may call it a nightmare, lads, if you will â my stars! 'twas a rare old dream
To be dreamed in this played-out bulk of a ship stuck fast in the mud of the stream-
True, anchored forever and aye, my lads, till she rots on the scum of the tide;
For never again will she cut the brine or the waves of the tempest riae.
But the dream put life in her corpse, my lads; pnt youth in her olden frame;
Put voices of death in her speechless guns, that'll never again flash flame.
I dreamed that a fleet from the Eastern worid was blocking the Golden Gate;
We had brandished the doctrine of sage Monroe, and had roused up the foreign hate.
Came a call for ships, and a call for men, and an order of quictt attackâ
And the Independence was mustered in for the lead on the foeman's track.
Like magic, dressed in a glory of sails she seemed, and the seamen smiled
When the old craft welcomed the eager wind, as the mother a long-lost child.
And never they recked of the wooden walls, and never the decks of pine,
And never they recked of the smooth-bore guns, though the rust had eaten their shine.
But in every seaman's soul there burst the fire that blazed of yore,
When the despot 'roused the patriot wrath on Liberty's Eden shore.
They felt the pride that Decatur felt when defiance his squadron hurled,
'Neath Gibraltar Heights, when this same old ship drew the wonder of all the world,
They felt the pride that a Bainbridge felt, as ne gazed from her deck that day,
When Barbary's pirates vanquished knelt, and bent was the haughty Bey.
They felt the pride that a Shubrick felt at Guaymas and Mazatlan,
When the Aztecs bowed to the conquering flag that the free winds love to fan.
They felt the pride that the victor feels who never has known defeat â
The ship had a soul, and her soul was men that the worJd can never beat.
.â¢
Oh, a freeman's fight is not one man's fight, for there comes with the rush of the flood
The strength of heroes of eld to his soul, their hero-fire to his blood;
And the single freeman becomes a host; his brand is a dozen brandsâ
Not a foe but shrinks from the blade that drinks war's wine as it turns in his hands.
[The Independence, now umdjs a receiving ship at Mare Island, was launched at Boston in 1814. She was a 7^-gun ship of the line, the first of that class built by our Government, carried 800 merv and cost $500,000. Her
first cruise was to the Mediterranean, and when she arrived at Gibraltar, bearing the broad pennant of Commodore BaUbridpr, she created no little sensation, as the British officers there had reported that the Americans
were not permitted to build ships of the line. In 1836 she was razed and her armament reduced to fifty- four guns. The Independence was always a favorite with seamen, being a fast sailer and a comfortable ship J
ICE BOUND ON THE GREAT SALT LAKE
Curious Incident on a Sheet of Water That- Never Freezes.
The large percentage of salt in the Great
Salt Lake prevents its waters from ever
freezing over, and yet a curious incident
â was related to me of how a small pleasure
steamer got icebound a dozen' years ago off
the east end of Antelope Island. My in
formant was the captain of the cattle-boat
that makes irregular trips back and forth
to carry stock to and from this largest of
the Salt Lake islands. I will give the story
as nearly as possible io his own words:
"It was a cur'ous thing that once hap
pened to me an' Cap'in Dahls," he began,
with a preliminary undoing of the knot of
his soiled neckherchief. "I want much
used to sailoring at the time, an' the.
cap'in often took me with him on short
trips be made with his small steamer, The
Susie. One day be got word a boat was
becalmed off North Antelope. We
steamed out to see, an' found a sheep- boat
boun' for Carrington Island. There was
three men aboard an' 200 sheep, an' they'd
ben out ten days an' hed no food an'
scarcely any water left. We give 'em a
fair divide o' the grub aboard the steamer,
an' taxing 'em in tow, made our way out
in the main body o' the lake, where we
left 'em close in to Carrington. It was
getting late when we started back, an' just
op'site Bear River Bay we found
ourselves in a stream of ice which
had come down from the swollen
rivers that emptvinto the lake hereabout.
At first it was "only provoking to. be hin
dered by the broken sheets of ice, but
fin'ly it K ot bo we couldnt 'make no head
way- The cap'ia said he'd sailed roun'
the world four times an' never waa ice
bound beforeâ an' that, too, in a lake that's
too salt to ever freeze. He was acting as
engineer, an' at last got so mad that he
cussed an' swore an' complained o' ray
steering. At last we bad to give it up till
morning, an ' then it want no bettei
mere was no wind to break up the ice an'
it kep closing 'bout us till we could see
nauthing but it on all sides. The cap'in's
temper got worse when the bread aa'
â¢v? n i. Was all gone an ' he growled out:
JUJtcn me ever going to sea again with a
green hand fur crew.' I was pretty riled
an' said something back 'bout a fool of a
cap'in, who thought himself at the north
pole. "We'd always ben good friends,
but after that neither of us spoke
more'n we's 'bliged to all that day
an' the next night. When the
second morning came an' we saw it was
still calm, we got reckless an' piled in the
wood till we got up steam, an' commenced
bucking ice at a great rate. We saw the
glassy sheets give way to right an' left, an'
tin'ly we waa clear of it so we could go
right ahead. It was Sunday morning, an'
the sea an' mountains looked so bright an'
peaceful that I saw the pucker in the
cap'in's fored smooth out, an' he com
menced to whistle soft an' ole hymn tune
we both knowed. I struck in where the
line repeats, an' when we'd ended up he
said: 'Say, Duffy, you don't mind my
FAST IN THE ICE ON GREAT SALT LAKE.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2. 1896.
'Tis a phantom band that fights at his side, and no more can perish hi? causa
Than steel can shatter the deathless shade that scorns the flesh and its laws.
For God, truth, justice and freedom, allâ these phantoms lead in the fray;
In peace, on history's page aligned, they are guarding our glory's way..
It was so that the Independence sailedâ she was manned with a double crew,
And one was phantom and one was flesh â and swift o'er the waves she flew.
Oh, never she stopped till her broadside guns on the foeman's fleet glared prime.
Then shot and shell poured out of her sides like the flow of the seconds of time.
The enemy's iron missiles sank in the sponge of the wooden hull,
Yet the ship rode fair, while the phantoms worted-the guns with never a lull.
Oh, the men in the flesh were blind with smoke, and the heat was the heat that slays,
But we knew from the start that the odds were ours in the old ship's day of days.
Oh, we knew the fight would be fierce and shortâ we felt it, lads, in our bonesâ
And we felt that God had a hand with us, and we laughed at Davy Jones.
But lo! the phantoms have left the guns, and the clouds have cleared away;
Tho foe that remains in the wreckage lies by the gate of the Golden Bay.
Now cheers from a hundred thousand throats ascend from every shore,
As the wondrous ship, with her wondrous guns, glides back to her home once more,
Till she moors again in the muddy flow, and vanish the shroud and tiie sail;
Till the phantoms fade, when the need is dead, at the close of the fiery tale.
And all that remains is the big, gray hulk, like the ghost of an era past,
And the rust is devouring his iron meal in the guns that have pealed their last,
But the flag waves over the wooden mass, and her glories for aye are fresh,
Though the best of her crew is a phantom host, and a handful those in the flesh.
You may call it a nightmare, lads, if you willâ my stars! 'twas a rare old dream,
To be dreamed in this played-out hulk of a ship stuck fast in the mud of the stream;
Yes, anchored forever and aye, aiy lads, till she rot 3on the scum of the tide;
For never again will she cleave the brine or the billow 3of ocean ride.

Lunches for Schoolboy*.
An investigation of the question of
schoo lunches has been made in Boston
recently, and arrangements have been
made for the furnishing of cheap lunches
in the high scnools at a cost of rive and
ten cents. A delicate point under consid
eration is how to furnish lunches to those
children who are unable tp pay for them.
In serving lunches at the noon hour it is
found that there is a decided tendency to
eat too fast. One visitor kept tally on the
boys, and found a boy who broke the rec
ord by getting away with three sand
wiches, a piece of cake and a cup of choco
late in four minutes, by the watch.
INTERESTING STRORY OF A SONG
A Baltimoreak Tells How Star-Spangled Banner Was W-ritt
There have appeared during the last few
years in various periodicals and daily
papers articles purporting to give an abso
lutely true account of the circumstances
under which the words of the "Star
spangled Banner" were written and the
occurrences which led to their composi
tion by youne Francis Scott Key of Mary
land, says K. D. Lawrence of Baltimore in
the New York Post. Each of these articles
has been mofe or less correct in its state
ments, the best of them having appeared
the Youth's Companion several years Bgo.
No one of them, however, gives the story
in its entirety as it is held in the two fam
ilies by whom it is treasured with pardon
able pride, as linking their names with the
far-off past of their country's struggle for
independence and with the composition of
what may be called her National song.
As a direct descendant of the family to a
member of which the song was dedicated
by Francis Key, I have had the story told
me many times by those who knew well
and delighted in relating every incident of
it; besides which I possess family papers
and letters giving many little items, in
teresting and amusing, connected with it,
which have certainly never been pub-,
lished.
There resided in Upper Marlborovlgh,
Prince Georges County, Md., in the early
part of this century an old gentlemanâ a
physicianâ Dr. William Beanes. He was
a member of one of the oldest families in
Maryland, a family whose estate was held
under deed of g'ft from Lord Baltimore in
1604. That deedâ a quaint old paperâ is
still in existence. Dr. Beanes was a man
known throughout his State for hi 3 ster
ling qualities and large-hearted hospitality,
as weli as for many eccentricities and a
somewhat quick temper. He is thus de
scribed to me by a very charming aged
lady who as a child knew him well, and ;
who is yet living, She adds: "Dr.
Beanes was my father's physician. He
was the kindest and most lovable of men
and wonderfully patient and gentle witn
little children, to whom he was devoted,
and he was the only gentleman I ever
knew who invariably wore ruffled shirts."
The doctor's hospitality was, perhaps,
the best known, as it is to-day the best re
membered, of his traits. Even in those
days when hospitality was â especially in
Maryland and Virginiaâ so marked a char
acteristic of the people, Dr. Beanes was
considered remarkable for the heartiness
of the welcome which he extended to
strangers as well as friends. A doubt was
often merrily expressed by his intimate
friends whether if his Satanic Majesty him
self had presented himself at his door the
old gentieman might not have asked him
to walk in and rest and take a glass of
wine. They . entertained, however, no
slightest doubt that had the fiend proved
a genial and gentlemanly personage Dr.
Beanes wo.uld have joined in* the proffered
refreshment, would have chatted and joked
and might so far have forgotten himself as
to invite him to call again.
Beyond question Dr. Beanes loved the
land of his birth. There are instances in
his life which evidenced this fact. Yet it
was quite impossible for him to be any
thing but courteous and hospitable to the
officers of the British vessels lying at
anchor in the rivfr near the family planta
tion whenever they came on shore. They
were gentlemen, they were genial com
panions; they liked a joke, enjoyed a good
story, ana they also greatly enjoyed the
doctor's rich dinners and fine ola wines;
and in spite of such trifles as differences of
political opinions and existing warfare be
tween their respective countries the old
man liked and cordially entertained them.
It came to puss one afternoon âthe
memorable 14tb of September, 1814 â that a
party of officers from Admiral Cockburn's
ships, then lying at the mouth of the
Petuxent River, whose waters washed the
shore of the Beanes family plantation,
were dining with the doctor.
Over their wine these gentlemen lingered
longer than usual, and must have indulged
rather freely and talked somewhat reck
lessly. They were aware that the bomoard
ment of Fort McHenry was decided on for
that very night, and after leaving Dr.
Beanes' house to return to the ship it;
occurred to them that they had very
nearly, if not quite, betrayed what was to
take place. To say the least, they felt that
they had talked more than was prudent.
ii they had done so, however, the doctor
had not fully understood the matter, for
he had taken no alarm as to that or any
immediate action on the part .of the
British.
They returned to the house where they
had so lately been entertained and made
the old gentleman their prisonei. It is a
fact that finding him preparing to retire
they gave him scant time for redressing,
ana actually carried him off without his
wig or his spectacles.
Now, Frank Key, a young lawyer, one of
his near neighbors, and a relative by mar
iage, was one of the first notified of his
dilemma. He lost uo time in applyingâ
under flag of truceâ to Admiral Cockburn,
on board his vessel, for the doctor's re
lease. Instead, however, of securing his
old friend's liberty he was himself detained
a prisoner during" the bombardment, then
just beginning, and which lasted beyond
midnight. The doctor and he were per
mitted to be together and but for their re
straint they were treated with perfect cour
tesy. I have never heard that either one
of them ever bore the least personal re
eentment to their captors.
Frank Key watched as far as, in the
darkness of the night, was possible the
bombardment of the fort; but Dr. Beanes,
with his aged sight and deprived of- his
glasses, was as one blind indeed. And all
through the memorable night his oft-re
peated question touched his young friend
most deeply. "Is the flag yet flying?"
were the words with which the old man
constantly appealed to him; and when at
earliest dawn it was seen that, the flag did
indeed still wave over McHenry, on a scrap
of paper torn from his pocket' note-book
young Key wrote the words of the "Star
spangled Banner," and gave them to his
old friend.
Later on, when first published, they
were dedicated â as indeed seemed appro
priate â to Dr. Beanes. The following
morning both gentlemen were put ashore,
and returned to their homes.
It is hardly necessary to stty that from
this adventure Dr. Beanes learned to re
strict his love of entertaining, to some ex
tent, to friends, and at any race not to
extend hospitality to British 'officers until
peace should be declared, however de
lightful as dinner companions they might
be. His experience was, as long as he
lived, the theme of many a jest, which he
always seemed to relish heartily.
It is related of his wife, who is described
as one of the gentlest and sweetest of old
ladies, that she particularly delighted to
remark, whenever thereafter the doctor
seemed about to indulge his slightly pep
pery temper, "My dear, I think I shall
have to send for Admiral Cockburn.."
MR. MURPHY OF SALEM
The Bank Defaulter From Massa
chusetts Identified in the
Prison.
City Marshal Hart of the Eastern City
Will Come to Take Him
Back.
It is now considered almost certain that
Private Detective Chappelle made no mis
take in arresting tbe man on Friday after
noon oh suspicion of being Clarence Mur
phy, who stole |60,000 from the Salem
(Mass.) Savings Bank.
Yesterday morning John D. Eaton of
410 Van Ness avenue visited the City
Prison. He formerly lived in Salem and
was a member of the Board of Aldermen.
He had known Murphy from his child
hood, and after studying the appearance
of the prisoner for a few minutes he ex
pressed the opinion that tbe man was
Murpny.
'â¢It is seven years since I left Salem,"
said Mr. Eaton, "and, of; course, seven
years makes some change in a man's ap
pearance. When I last saw Murphy he
was boyish in appearance and the beard
he now wears makes him look decidedly
older. It was my first impression that
Murphy was not as tail as the prisoner,
but I- must be mistaken, for I see the de
scription sent out by City Marshal Hart,
an oid friend of miue, gives Murphy's
height as 5 feet 11 inches, which tallies
with the heieht of the prisoner.
"As I remember the case, the bank lost
$100,000 through Treasurer Simons and
Murphy. Simons died after tne discovery
of the shortage by his own hand, as every
one believed. The bank never recovered a
dollar. Murpby's escape was a most sen
sational one."
The police received a dispatch yesterday
that John W. Hart, City Marshal of
Salem, would start on Monday to take
back the prisoner, and asking that he be.
held pending his arrival.
Another man, who did not want hia
name mentioned, saw Murphy in tbe
prison and asserted that he was the man. I
Murphy and his wife had lived with Him \
in Alameda, and lie knew ho was a bank
defaulter from the East.
Murphy is as silent as a clam. He posi
tively refuses to make any statement, and
answers any question by the reply, "I
have nothing more to say." He limped in
his gait yesterday from the effect, of his
jump out of the window of the detectives'
room. Policeman urophy, who overtook
the fugitive, was the recipient of many
compliments yesterday. He is a bright
young patrolman and has already an en
viable record. It is argued that he should
be entitled to a portion of the reward
offered for Murpby's capture, as if- it had
not been for him the probability is that
Murphy would have effected his escape.
AN ACUTE ADVERTISER.
Sets the Press of Australia Objecting
and Has an Issue of Post Cards
Withdrawn.
One of the clerks of the City delivery
department at the main postoffice has a
penny postal card of Australia which is
worth a half crown though it was issued
less than three montns ago. Its extreme
value is due to the fact that the entire
issue of many millions was suppressed be
fore it had been out three weeks. This
action was taken in deference to the ob
jections of the press.
The post cards were not immoral. The
objection was wholly a matter of esthet
icism. Tbe entire public was shocked by
the progressiveness of the Antipodean ad
vertiser.
A man with the inventive faculty largely
developed offered to supply the province
of Victoria with all the necessary postal
cards, free of cost, p.n condition that he be
allowed the space of about one and a half
inches on one side for advertising. This
meant a saving of many thousand dollars
to the Government and the offer was ao
cented.
The result was that when the postal
cards appeared they looked as if the Gov
ernment ran a grocery. The stamp was
hardly visible in contrast with the heavy
blue ink in an ad of some "pure American
leaf" chewing tobacco and somebody
else's lager beer. The effect can be under
stood from the following note received
here a few days since on one of the ob
jectionable cards :
Melbourne, Nov. 2, 1895.
Dear : This post card was issued less than
a month ago and caused such a howl tr.at tiiey
were withdrawn this week, and are now worth
sixpence and will probably soon be worth a
half crown. You may find it useful for your
collection. * * *
This is only one instance of the progres
siveness of "Australian advertisers. Not
long ago a series of stamps were issued
and sent an extra time through the
presses, so that when a letter writer picked
up a stamp to lick it his eyes fell on "Use
Somebody's pickles. They are the best."
The idea of the advertising postal card
is said to have originated with ex-Post
master-General Wanamaker.

SOCIETY
THE past week has been especially
eventfu^ in social circles. Lunch
eons, dinners, theater parties, mu
sicales and dances followed in
bewildering succession, each en
tertainment being not only elaborate but
in some manner characteristic and novel.
The next week will be devoted almost
entirely to smart weddings, after which,
with the exception of a few small dances,
the season of '95-96 will close brilliantly
with the Art Association bal masque.
The last dance of the Friday-night Club,
which was to have been held on Friday
evening last, was on account of the illness
of Mr. Greenway postponed to April 17.
The last dance, of the Monday-night
Dancing Ciass will be held on the evening
of February 10, and the last Friday fort
nightly meeting . will take place on the
evening of the 14th. It is to be rather
more elaborate than the previous efforts
of this club and is to partake of the nature
of a leap-year cotillon. Miss Hobart is to
lead.
Owing to the excessive crowding of
Lunt's Hall at the previous dance of the
Friday Fortnightly the patronesses an
nounce that they are compelled to decline
to issue any invitations for their concluding
dance, to be held in February, and that
there will be absolutely no deviation from
this rule; also that invitations issued for
precedine dances will not hold trood or be
recognized for the concluding dance.
Early as it yet is the merits of the
various watering places and summer
resorts are being eagerly discussed, and
people who have country estates and have
been passing the season in them are
already preparing to depart ior their in
terior homes.
The weddings next week offer a pleasing
variety for those who will be fortunate to
attend. The Grant-Pond wedding to
morrow evening is to be a church wed
ding and will be followed by a reception
at the residence of the bride, 2017 Lyon
street.
The nuptials of Miss Jarboe and Jerome
Case Bull will be solemnized on the morn
ing of February 6. The bride-elect i 3
â pending the few days previous to her
marriage, accompanied by her mother, at
the Jarboe place at Santa Cruz.
The Hooker-Goad wedding, which was
at first intended to be a very quiet affair.
will take place on Wednesday at 5 o'clock,
at the Goad residence on Washington
street. Five hundred invitations have
been issued for the event, which will doubt
less be one of the handsomest weddings
â¢ver celebrated in this City. It will prob
ably be the last fashionable event for some
time to come to be celebrated in the Goad
mansion, which has been the scene of so
very many elaborate functions. Mr. Goad
has decided to place this elegant residence
on the market, and after the wedding, ac
companied by his two other daughters, the
Misses Genevieve and Aileen Goad, will
leave for an extended European visit.
Easter receptions are already being
planned and eagerly discussed. The most
notaole already promised is the reception
and cotillon to be given by Major and Mrs.
.Darling on Easter Monday. Through" the
courtesy of General Graham the Presidio
hoproom has been placed at the disposal
of this generous host and hostess. The
affair is in honor of Mrs. Darling's daugh
ter, Miss Catherwood. Mrs. General Gra
ham, Mrs. J. D. Fry, Mrs. J. H. Jewett,
Mrs. H. L. Dodge and Mrs. LoughborouKh
will assist the hostess to receive her many
guests and Miss Catherwood will have &a
assistants the Misses Graham, Misses
Hooper. Mh>B Lincoln and Miss Lough
borough.
The affair is not only to be elaborate in
all its details, but many surprises are
promised.
The only Easter wedding yet announced
is that of Miss Jennie Masten, daughter of
K. K. Master, and Mr. Ewell. It is to be
celebrated in Easter week, although no
definite date has yet been decided upon.

NEWHALL COTILLOB.
One of tie Prettiest Events Given During
the Winter Season.
â  To Geoxge Aimer Newhall belongs the credit
of having given the most successful and the
prettiest cotillon of the season. The one
Wednesday evenii.g at his residence, on the
southwest corner of Van Ness avenue and Sut
ter street, was the most original affair of tne
kind which has ever been attempted in San
Francisco.
The novelty was that Mr. Newhall had ar
ranged with four of Mb friends to entertain at
dinner the guests that had been invited to the
cotillon. Elaborate dinners were served, and
at their conclusion the host and hOÃtesses mar
shaled their forces, so to 6peak, for the great
event oi the evening, and proceeded to the
Newhall residence.
At their home, 711 Pine street, Mr. and Mrs.
Mountford 8. Wilson entertained the following
Indies and gentlemen at dinner: Dr. and Mrs.
McMonagle, Mr. and Mrs. J. D. Harvey, Mr.
and Mrs. Robert J. Wood?, Mr. and Mrs: Snin

proper arrangement of such an affair is no easy

things that seem ; trivial/, yet â  which : must be

of these had received their due share of atten
tion, however. *â¢ vy : â :â /,â¢ â ; . . â¢ . â¢â " ." â¢ "
The figures of the german were all new and
the favors exceptionally handsome and novel,
having been sent out- from New. York specially
fox this dance. The i cotillon was led by Mr.
Newhall without a partner. *">- ' :-..'. -.-. â â¢'
The first figure danced : was double circles.
When the dancers had completed the circles
they formed into baskets and then backed once
more into double lines. The grand s right â¢ and
left followed until partners were reached, when
a waltz concluded the figures. â ' â  â  . . *
In ; this ; figure â¢ the â -â  ladies received '- little
statuettes showing daring riders of the gentler
sex putting their mounts to hurdles of formid
able dimensions. The 'gentlemen - received
similar tokens, the ; riders, however, â  being of
the sterner half .; of * humanity. Not a little
ingenuity had been bestowed on the devising
of these favors, and when they were displayed
considerable merriment resulted. â¢ ;-â â â  -'â â â 
Military Flags was the name of the next fig
ure. The ladies and gentlemen, having formed
in the center of the floor, turned ' and faced
each other. The flags were then crossed in the
center, forming an arch. ;, ~
. Under this all the dancers passed, and' when
the last couple had dene -so they marched to
the head of the room, the gentlemen going to
the right and the ladies to - the left until they
met at the other end of t the hall, when the
polka was danced. '. Silken flags of all nations
were borne by the dancers in this figure, the
resulting combinations being both . pleasing
and perplexing. :-â¢ â  : ' .
For favors the ladles received military hel
mets, kepis and fezes andjthe gentlemen artifi
cial frjiit., â¢-â ':' . v"-: "' "<â¢â 
The third figure, danced was called The 1
snake. In this eight couples took out a like
number and formed lines in the center of the
ballroom, back to back. They then marched
in couples and circled around the room, the
gentlemen passing between. the ladies until
they reached their original positions. Â
Cupids, diligently sharpening their, arrows,
were the iavors received by the ladies and upon
the gentlemen were bestowed little jeweled
hearts pierced by arrows. . " â  "
The fourth figure was simple enough, but
quite pretty. It was â¢ called The Musical
Chair. . Two : rows of â  chairs were placed- back
to back in the center of the room, and on these
the ladies were seated. The gentlemen then
marched past, continuing their progress until
the signal was given, and the lady opposite
whose chair a gentleman found himself became
his partner and they waltzed.
For this figure the favors for the ladies were
small tambourines, little pianos and watering
pots, and for the gentlemen miniature banjos
and violins. . â¢â¢â '.â¢â .'...
Quite a quaint figure was the lastâ Sur
prise. In the center of the room were placed
screens with six panels of tissue paper, behind
each screen six ladies being concealed. - The
gentlemen formed a circle around the panels,
and when the signal was given a lady broke
through the paper panel and danced with the
gentleman who happened to be opposite.
Miniature sewing-machines and work
baskets were the favors received by the ladies
in this figure, and each â of the gentlemen was
made happy by the gift of a little pug dog in
bronze. â¢ . ' y :;.- .. .;'â -'.
It was ha.'f an hour alter midnight when the
last figure was concluded, and then the guests
proceeded to the large supper-room in the
upper story of the house. Here a collation
was served on small tables, at each of which
were seated six persons. The tables were
decorated with violets '< and with ribbons of
a shade to match the flowers, and an elabo
rate supper was served. The menu was as fol
lows:

Another very elaborate tea yesterday was the
one given -by Mrs. William Alvord at her resi
dence on Broadway. The Alvprd residence is
of itself so very elegant that but little decora-'

FATHER CROWLEY`S TRIP
He Will Visit Youths* Directory
Boys in Their New
Homes.
A Supervision That Is Maintained
With Happy Results Over
Many Rescued Lads.
Rev. D. 0. Crowley, director of the
Youths' Directory, will" leave .town this
week for a tour of the State. The object
of his trip is to look after .boys who have
passed through the directory and are
placed in good homes in the country.
While buying his ticket' yesterday m the
Southern Pacific office, Father Crowley
talked with enthusiasm about his plan of
watching over the boys' welfAre.
"I am. about to start out on a tour that
will be quite an extended one,'* he said.
"My route will take in the Ban Joaquin
and Sacramento valleys, and I shall also
travel about through the Santa Clara and
Salinas valleys and down the coast rail
road as far as San Luis Obispo. I make
this trip at regular intervals just to see
how the boys are getting on and how they
are treated by those having charge of
them.
"Our work in the Youths'jDirectory does
not end in the institution itself. We take
in boys from 'die streets' and other places
and when they are able to do anything we
find them homes or positions. In this
way a large number of promising lads are
distributed throughout the State. They
like country life and grow, into line, able
young fellows in the open air; and, besides,
they are better â¢' morally and mentally in
their new homes and under the influences
of their pleasant surroundings. This is a
wonderful difference irorn the life they
would have to lead if- left in the City to
drag along an existence in the streets. It
is the saving of them."
"How are they educated?"
"We look out for that. We always
stipulate that the boys must be sent to
school every day until' they reach the ace
of 14 years. After that it is not part of the
agreement With their employes or guardi
ans, although many of the boys are al
lowed to continue attending school.
"In the mornings and evenings they do
chores around the housfe or farm and
make theruself useful.
'"If we lind that a lad is not properly
treated we take him from that home and
find him another place, or, if he is dissatis
fied, we give him a change.
"On my tour I visit each and every one
of these boys and see for myself how they
are being cared for and how they are pro
gressing. The work is well worth the
trouble, and is more than repaid by the
results accomplished."
LUCEEO IS ACCEPTED.
Charles Fair's Yacht Has Finally Been
Turned Over to Her New Owners.
The yacht Lucero, which was built for
Charles L. Fair, at Seattle last year, has at
latit been accepted. Several days ago in
structions were received by the attorneys
of "the young millionaire directing them
to make a settlement of the matter. The
yacht was at once turned over to George
A. Knigbt by Robert Englebrecht, the
builder. The price of the yacht waÃ orig
inally placed at nearly $20,000, but whether
this entire sum was paid for her is not
made known.
As soon as the transfer 'was made the
Lucero was taken over to Oakland Creek,
where she will be housed over and allowed
to remain until the return of the new
owner. Mr. Faif is now on his way from
Europe and will arrive in this City not
later than February 21. There is 'pome
likelihood that the Lucero will soon be
put in condition for a trip to Alaska in
the early part of summer.
BAB'S ADVICE TO WIVES
She Tells Them Just What to
Do to Hold Their Hus
bands.
MAKE THEM SELF-SATISFIED.
The Head of the House Should Also
Be Developed Into a Creature
of Habit.
â¢ NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 28.-T heard a
clever woman give as her idea of the best
method of holding a man this answer:
"Make him a creature of habit." Do you
know how much truth there is in that?
If you are in doubt about amm try it.
Get him in the habit of sitting in a certain
chair,, and he finds most others uncom
fortable; get him in the habit of seeing
your face smiling at him across the din
ner table, and he is rather upset when he
is opposite another woman. That woman
who understood a man who had loved
many women, that woman who was
neither young nor beautiful, Mme. de
Maintenon, said of Louis XIV: "He
is used to every chair in my room, and
if their places were changed it would
annoy him. He is used to walking a cer
tain distance every evening to see me, and
to go further or less would be a trouble to
him. I know the things that please him,
the food be likes, I know what annoys
him, I know the people who are pleasant
and those who are unpleasant to him, and
I never contradict him unless I feel that
he is in remarkably good health and
anxious to impress UDon me now much
more he knows than I do. Then I start a
little discussion, but in it I never give a
hint of the great knowledge I possess.- I
permit him to come out conqueror, and he
forgives me and loves me all the more be
cause of my seeming ignorance. After a
man has t>assed 40, the woman he loves is
the woman he is used 10." I wonder if
this is true? lam tempted to believe it.
Did you ever realize the value of magic
wordsâ words that will bring you blessings
or words that wiil result in your suffer
ing? Words that you could utter to your
friends and words that said to your ene
mies will bring all sorts of trouble upon
them? Of course, the most important of
all words is "abracadabra." This, written
on a bit of parchment and put in a silk
bag, worn about the neck, will drive away
all evil spirits and bring good health to
you. Could this have bee a the begin
ning of the scapular? People who were
very wealthy got precious stones or
bits of gold and had this mystic word
written upon each and then the pre
cious bit was covered with a golden cass,
not unlike a locket, and swung on a string
of pearls, gold or of diamonds, as one's
desire or purse permitted. By the by,
this was the name Cagliostro gave to his
favorite horse. If you have the chills (and
oh! is there anything worse than a chill,
unless it ii the fever that comes after it?)
then have "Abracalan" written on your
parchment, and the chills will disappear
as rapidly as your monthly allowance. It
appears, according to history, that there is
a certain amount of sex in these words, for
what cures a bad headache, a fainting
! spell or indigestion in a man will do no
good whatever to a woman. For these ills
a man should have, either on the parch
ment in his bag or on his shirt cuff, or, in
deed, wherever it is most convenient, the
word "Anamzaptas," while a young
woman with a leaning toward headaches
and these other ills requires "Anam
zapta."
For general use around the house, when
the kitchen lady is insubordinate and the
children all show symptoms of getting
the measles, the word "Agla" is handy.
It wouldn't be a bad idea for the people
who have discovered its good qualities to
have it painted on stiff cardboard in very
large letters, fiame it, and permit it to take
the place of the worsted motto which in
many bouses has formed the chief deco
ration (?).
If, to use the language of that immortal
Mr. Chiramie Fadden, "you're chasm'
yourself around the country" and meet a
snake, you need not trouble to
use his favorite phrase, "Tell," but
instead draw yourself up in the most dig
nified manner,.Btare the serpent in the eye
and say "Osya." I do not know now to
pronounce this word, and I bÂ«g that no
body will ask me if the "y" is soft or
hard ; one of the charms about the mystic
words is that you can pronounce them as
you please, for it is doubtful if, west of
Calcutta, anybody but a few Oriental pro
fessors knows just how they should be
uttered. I should like you to feel that I
am giving you much that is fjcfod in offer
ing this mystic slang; but it seemed to
me that, as words don't amount to so very
much, there could be no harm in trying
them. In that they are unlike patent
medicines. If you have a ruby or a sap
phire, or even an emerald sufficiently
large to take it, get the word '"Bedooh"
engraved upon it, ana all the money you
want will come to you.
If somebody woulji only prove thrs, I
would pawn the entire furniture and be
longings of "The Hut" to get a ruby and
to have the dinky word put on it. But,
alas! although 1 have heard the tale and
am repeating it, I have never even met an
Oriental gentleman who had struck it rich,
so to sa}', by his mystic word. When you
have an enemy and meet him, hurl the
word "Abraxas" at him, and immediately
a ladder will fall on him, or if it is a she,
her hat will go out of fashion, but what
ever happens you will get the best of it. A
really, righty enemy, one on whom you
wish all 6orts of dreadful things to fall,
can be made to suffer dreadfully if you
send him a sheet of paper with "Abra
zapta" written on it. It seems to me that
if these letters were spelled out on chil
dren's blocks there would be a great run
on a'a. Perhaps it is because it is the first
letter and therefore difficult to learn. Well,
I don't care very much, for in my own
name I have the mystic letter A bounded
on each side by the mystic letter B, so
thoueh you can't linci Venezuela, there is
no difficulty in discovering Bab.
FISE FOR THE SEA.
Herring That Remain a Day on Shore
and Then Are Thrown in -
Deep Water.
Yesterday on the deck of almost every
one of the long line of fishing-smacks that
rock beside the pier at Fisherman's wharf
heaps of tine fat herring were lying to be
given back to the sea again when the little
fleet reached deep water.
One fisherman was stowing away a large
fifty-pound box in the stern of his boat.
When asKed what object he had in throw
ing the fisn away, he affected an air of
great stupidity and said: "You want to
buy; you come down to fish?"
Collector L. J. Morris said : "The fish
ermen throw away much less fisii now
than they formerly did. I haven't noticed
the boats particularly when leaving for
the fishing grounds, but I don't have any
doubt but that they do throw away fish.
"You can hardly blame them. It is a
hard thing to gauge the market exactly, so
there is bound to be a surplus after the
market is supplied. Now if they should
sell what is left for half or quarter the
price they ordinarily get, you see the next
day tiiey would not sell a fish at the
present rates, for purchasers would wait
until the reduced rate period of the day
arrived.
"They must protect themselves, you
know. As it is, they scarcely make a liv
ing and they work hard for what they eet
too.
"I agree with Commissioner Chad
bourne about a free market on the
wharves. These poor chapa would stand
more of a chance then. Now they are en
tirely governed by the uptown markets.
Then, too, the tugboats that use drag
nets for fishing enter into a strong compe
tition with them and do a hundred times
better business.
"I have seen a fleet of forty smacks that
at the end of a week had made but $200.
This you see averaged about $5 to a boat;
hardly enough to pay for wear and tear
on the nets. Still if these fellows got to
gether and staid together they might do
far better than they do now."
PSYCHICAL LECTURES.
Three New Courses .Are Arranged by
the California Society.
The California Psychical Society, which
was incorporated November 4, 1895, has
felt so encouraged over its unexpected suc
cess that special courses of lectures have
been arranged. At the recent meetings
addressed by Mr. J. J. Morse of London,
National Hall on Ellis street was well
filled, and much real earnestness in psy
chological study was shown by those pres
ent.
The first course began Friday night in
Golden Gate Hall", when Mr, Morse lec
tured on "tome Fundamental Principles
of Psychic Science." Other lectures of
this series will be delivered by Professor
Edward Howard Griggs of Stanford Uni
versity on "The Scientific Study of the
Higher Human Life," February 14 at 8
p. m.. and by Dr. David Starr Jordan on
"The Evolution of Mind," March 6 at 8
p. m. The second course will include Rev.
Charles W. Wendte, Rabbi Jacob Voor
sanger and Dr. Joseph Le Conte.
Sunday evening discourses will be given
by Mr. Morse in National Hall during
February as follows, the general subject
being "The Evolution of a Soul": Febru
ary 2, "Its Birth"; February 9, "Its Bat
tles"; February 16,- "Its Eclipse," and
Feoruary 23, "fts Triumph."
TO MAKE GOOD SAILORS.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner's
First Orders to the Naval
Battalion.
Divisions Are to Be Treated as Ele
ments of One Ship's Crewâ New
Formations.
Louis H. Turner, lieutenant-commander
of the Naval Battalion, has issued his first
order, and in it he commences at once the
organization of the battalion upon strictly
naval principles.
The first provision of the new order
allows the wearing of red service stripes
by enlisted men, onÂ« stripe for each re
enlistment of three years. The stripe will
run diagonally across the sleeve between
the elbow and the wristband.
The order also directs the commanders
of divisions to assign to each member a
number, to be known as the "ship" or
"watch* number, the First Division using
the numbers from 1 to 100; the Second
Division from 101 to 200 ; the Third Divi
sion from 201 to 300; the Fourth Division
from 301 W 400, and the Fifth Division
from 401 to 500. The odd numbered men
shall constitute the starboard watch, and
the even-numbered men the port watch,
and a quarter-inch band of white tape
upon the upper seam of the sleeve o! the
odd-numbered men, and a similar band
similarly placed on the left sl%eve of the
even-numbered men shall be used to desig
nate their proper watch.
The aivision commander will also assign
each member to a squad, a boat crew, a
gun crew and an infantry section. The
naval "section" formation will be the basis

The "Whipping-Post.
The old whipping-post still flourishes in
the county jail down at Newcastle, Del.,
and the "cat" wieWa a great moral influ
ence in the community. According to a
well-known Delawarean who was in town
yesterday it seems that tobacco is the
bnly solace of tne inveterate law-breakers,
who are regularly sentenced to the post.
They claim that" it strengthens their
nerves, and enables them to bear the
strokes of the lash with greater fortitude.
Some time ago a colored man was sen
tenced to twenty-five lashes. He was one
of the "regulars," and having no tobacco
was all of a tremble. His nerve seemed
completely gone. He writhed under the
first fifteen strokes, and then yelled, "Foh
de Lawd's sal , Mister Sheriff, gimme a
chaw of eatin.' tobacco!" The official
paused, granted the request and went on
with his unpleasant task. With a piece of
the weed in his cheek the culprit did not
seem to mind the remaining ten strokes in
the least.â Philadelphia Record.SAN FRANCISCANS
WHO HAVE BEEN
DECORATED
DECORATIONS.
NOT a few of the citizens of San
Francisco have been honored^y
our own Government or py
foreign rulers with medals or
emblems that are valued for
their historical associations as well as for
the fact that they render especially memo
rable the occasion of the presentation, and
are eloquent prooi of appreciation of ser
vices rendered. These decorations are, as
a rule, a matter of intense pride with their
possessors. They tell of distinguished
consideration from exalted powers; of
the grateful recognition of valorous con
duct or of services of acknowledgment in
the civic branches of government. The
stories connected with some of these dec
orations are exceedingly interesting, and
on the whole they make reading that is
neither uninstructive nor unprofitable.
One of the very ancient decorations of
European royalty is that of the order of
Christ, which was established by King
Diniz of Portugal in August, 1318. The
order was created shortly following the
Crusades, and was intended as a perpetu
ation of the order of Templars. Persons
distinguished for their deeds and works are
decorated with this order by the Portu
guese ruler. It is a red-enameled cross
with a golden border, and depends from a
ecarlet ribbon, like the Legion of Honor
medal. The only possessor of this historic
medal in San Francisco is Dr. Bourgoue
non de Marville, who, by the way, is a
Frenchman.
General W. H. L. Barnes enjoys the dis
tinction of being the only man not of
Scandinavian birth who is entitled to wear
the decoration of the order of St. Olaf.
The story of how the honor came to him
The Order of St. Olaf.
will bear repetition, as it is full of human
interest and not devoid of beauty, [n 1878
there came to the port of San Francisco the
American ship Sunrise with a crew that
was taken aboard in the northern part of
Norway, at Trondhjem. This is about
the latitude of Iceland. The natives there
aie a hardy race, and this crew was a pick
of hardy men, all first-class sailors, but
not one of them able to speak English.
The captain and mate of the vessel beat
those men almost out of God's image.
The captain's name was Clark; the
mate's, Harris. Arriving here the mem
bers of the crew told their countrymen of
this City the story of brutal treatment.
The Scandinavian societies asked General
Barnes to brine action against the captain
and mate. Clark and Harris were in
dicted on seventy-one counts. General
Barnes assisted United States District At
torney (now Judge) W. W. Morrow in the
prosecution of the cases. The defendants
were abJy represented, but were convicted
on every count, fined $5000 each and sen
tenced each to a term of five years in
prison.
The Scandinavian societies then brought
to General Barnes a sack of coin contain
ing about $750 in halves aud quarters col
lected from their countrymen. The gen
eral declined the proffered money, telling
the committee to go and give it to the
wounded sailors, and that he would con-
Chevalier of the Crown of Italy.
eider his services as so much done for
American decency.
Time passed, and one day the Consul
for Sweden and Norway asked General
Barnes to make an appointment with him.
This was done, and when the appointed
day arrived the Consul marched into the
general's office at the head of a crowd or
people and handed him an autograph let
ter from King Oscar.
Hi& Majesty addressed the general as
bis friend and said:
I have learned through my Consul of your
advocacy of the cause of some of my subjects
and of the results which followed. These
things give me great satisfaction, and I can
truly say to you, in the name of Him who is
infinitely greater than all kings of earth,
"Whatsoever thou hast done unto the least of
these, that thou hast done unto me." I send
you the order of St. Olaf, with appropriate
decorations, which I hope you will accept as a
memento from your friend, Oscar.
Thia decoration is an eight-pointed
Greek cross with sapphire center, upon
which is embossed in gold on one side the
rampant lion of Sweden and on the other
_Jie motto of St. Oiaf, which, translatedÂ»
means, "True and faithful." The medal
is further adorned with emeralds, diamonds
and pearls. The order dates back a thou
sand years.
There is an amusing side to this story as
well. It appears that a council was held
at Stockholm with reference to the advisa
bility of conferring the St. Olaf decoration
on a foreigner. The opposition was very
strong, and, despite the fact that the
President of the council declared that it
was the King's wish that General Barnes
should be so honored, the council threat
ened to vote down the proposition. The
question was at a critical stage, but the
president of the council rose to the im
portance of the occasion. He was some
what of a politician himself.
"Why, gentlemen," exclaimed the presi
dent, "do you know who tne man is on
whom the King desires to confer his royal
favor? Do you know that his fame extends
to the remotest bounds of civilization? Do
you know that he ranks to-day as the great
est lawyer in all America ? You are all mili
tary men, my brothers, and need I tell
you more than that General Barnes stands
second only in rank to that unapproach
able commander, General Grant? Not
only that, but he is one of the foremost cf
living statesmen, and it is conceded that
he will be the next President of the United
States. Can we not afford to honor such a
man when lie has so nobly and honorably
and successfully defended the subjects of.
Sweden when they appealed to him, poor
and wronged strangers in. a strange land
on the other side of the world?"
These arguments were invincible. The
opposition faded away like fog clouds be
fore the powerful rays of the sun. The
president was compelled to suppress an
involuntary cheer just before the vote was
taken. By the time the roll was called
the fog was nowhere; the sun everywhere.
General Barnes received the unanimous
sanction of the council for the honor of the
order of St. Olaf.
The only other Scandinavian decoration
in the City is that held by the Swedish
Consul, Henry Lund, who has received
the medal of the order of "Wasa, which is
awarded for valuable civic and military
services to Norway and Sweden.
Colonel George Washington Grannis is
the possessor of a beautiful gold medal,
which is illustrated on this page, and
which calls to mind the story of an event
unparalleled in the history of naval war
fare. The medal was presented by the So
ciety of 1812 to Mr. Grannis, as the eldest
son of a survivor of the famous crew of the
American private armed brig General
Armstrong. Mr. Grannis' father, who be
came Captain Alva Grannis, shipped un
der Captain Samuel C. Keid on the Gen-

eral Armstrong, which carried seven guns
and a crew of ninety men.
The privateer played havoc with British
commerce, frequently sailing into the
British Channel, sinking a merchantman
and invariably escaping after hot pursuit
from English cruisers. Shewas one of the
terrors of the sea to the craft that flew the
Union Jack, and her destruction was no
doubt prayed for in strong language by
many a British captain. The Armstrong
left the port of New York on the 9th of
September, 1814, and on the 26th of the
same month arrived and cast anchor in
the neutral port of Fayalfor the purpose of
obtaining a supply of fresh water. The
crew was employed that afternoon in tak
ing the water aboard. About sunset of
that day the British brig-of-war Carnation
appeared suddenly in sight, followed by
the British ship Rota, of 38 guns, ana a
74-eun snip, the Plantagenet.
The squadron was commanded by Cap
tain Robert Lloyd. The fleet anchored in
the harbor of Fayal about 7 p. m. and some
suspicious movements among these vessels
indicating an intention to violate the
neutrality Jaw of theport induced Captain
Reid to order his brie to be warped in
shore close under the guns ol the castle.
This prudential step was taken by Captain
Reid to avoid collision with the over-
M'helming force in his presence and to pre
serve, if possible, the neutrality of the port
from violation. "While he was thus en
deavoring to place his brig as near as
possible under the guns of the castle, four
boats approached his vessel filled with
armed men from the fleet.
Captain Reid hailed them and re
peatedly warned them to keep off. They
did not heed him. Knowing that the ob
ject of the crews in the boats was the cap
ture of the brig, and finding his admoni
tion unavailing lie ordered his men to fire,
and they did. The fire was returned by
the boats, killing one and wounding an
other on the brig. Several of the assail
ants were killed and wounded, and the
boats retreated to the fleet and prepared
for a more formidable attack. Meantime
the Armstrong was placed closer to the
shore and to the castle, hoping that no

further attempt would be made to violate
the neutrality laws.
Soon after midnight twelve or fourteen
boats, supposed to contain 400 men, with
small cannon, swivels, blunderbuses and
other arms, made a violent attack on the
brigr, when a conflict of unequaled severity
ensued, lasting forty minutes, and ter
minating in the total defeat and partial
destruction of the boats and immense
slaughter of the assailants. Every man in
the brig was a host in himself.
In this brilliant defense the Americans
sustained a loss of but two killed and seven
wounded, while the British loss was be
tween tivo and three hundred killed.
At daybreak on the morning of the 27th
the British ships began a heavy cannon
ade on the Armstrong, and' her captain,
deeming further resistance unavailing,
abandoned her, and she was soon after
ward set on lire by the Bri .sh.
The survivors of that ccaflict are all in
their graves, but the medal of honor in
each case will go down through the gener-

ations. Colonel Grannis says that he often
questioned his father about the fight at
Fayal, but it was a subject that the sire
avoided. The very mention of Fayal acted
like a shock to his nerves. The midnight
scene of flame and death was so deeply
impressed on his mind that the breath
ing of that name seemed to bring again
that hour of slaughter. At such times he
would cover his eyes with his hands and
silence would be the only answer. The
colonel prizes the medal more highly than
he would any decoration that royalty could
confer.
General James Coey, ex-Postmaster of
San Francisco, is a member of the
Medal of Honor Legion of the United
States. It is composed of those officers
and enlisted men of the regular army
ana navy ana volunteer .forces of the
United States to whom medals have been
presented by the President in the name of
Congress, as having most distinguished
themselves by their gallantry in action and
other soldier-like qualities during the war
for the preservation of the Union and the
constitution, 1861-65; and also all soldiers,
seamen and marines to whom, for distin
guished services in any war of the United
States, the Secretary of the Navy has
awarded medals of honor pursuant to act
or resolution of Congress.
In accordance with an act of Congress,
approved March 3, 1863, General Coey was

presented by the Secretary of War with a
medal of honor for distinguished bravery
at the battle of Hatcher's Run, Va., Feb
ruary 6, 1865. The particular incidents of
thia action, relative to General Coey,
are recounted in the records of the
War Department at Washington. He
was major of the One Hundred and
Forty-seventh New York Volunteers
attached, to General S. W. Crawford's
division. At Hatcher's Run, when the
commanding officer on the right of the
One Hundred and Forty-seventh had
fallen, General Marrow (brigade corn
mander) complimented Major Coey with
the additional command, although the
latter was one of the youngest officers of
the brigade, bogi in years and rank.
His brilliant service was no.ted. ana
when General Morrow fell he was ordered
to take command, but was prevented by a
serious wound.
"Captain Coey" is mentioned repeatedly
for heroic conduct in the earlier war re
ports from his division. He was wounded
many times, and at Hatchers Run, after
being borne from the field unconscious
and apparently lifeless, - returning to
consciousness, he rode back on the horse
of an ambulance sergeant and accom
panied the final charge that won the day.
Although Major Coey's life was then de

when the flag of truce appeared on April
9, 1865, when the war was ended.
On that day he was appointed brevet
coionel.
Three of the leading Italian residents of
San Francisco have been honored by King
Humbert with the order of Chevalier of
the Crown of Italy. The distinguished
three are Joseph Calegaris, Dr. P. de Vecchi
and E. Moro. A pious tradition says that
the crown of Italy was made out of the
nails which were used in the crucifixion of
the Lord Jesus Christ; that these naila
were found in the year 395 on Mount
Calvary by Helena, the mother of Con
stantine the Great, and that she had a
diadem made out of them and presented it
to .her son, the Emperor.
Subsequently the diadem came into the
possession of Pope Gregory I, who made a
present of it to Queen Teolinda, who, wish
ing that the precious relic should be held
sacred, donated it to the cathedral at
â¢ Morza, with the injunction that future
Kings of Italy should wear it. It was then
called "The Iron Sacred Crown of Italy."
The crown remained almost undisturbed
in the church of Morza till in 1859, before
the Italian war of independence, and in that
year the Austrian Governmentâ then in
possession of the whole of Lombardy â or
dered it removed to Vienna.
After the war of independence the dia
dem was returned to the Italian Govern
ment. Victor Emmanuel created the order
of Chevaliers of the Crown of Italy in 1808
to celebrate the event of the occupation of
Venice and the annexed territories, as well
as the fact that by such annexation the
Order of Cross of Christ.
unification of Italy was almost complete.
The order is conferred upon those who,
whether* Italians or foreigners, have con
tributed to the welfare of Italy. The
King is the grand master of the order.
The medal of the Legion of Honor of
France adorns the breast of Gustave De
longrave, the French Consul. The order
of the Legion of Honor was instituted by
Napoleon in 1802, the order that had been
celebrated under the old monarchy having
been abolished by the French Revolution.
AH soldiers upon whom sabers of honor
had been conferred and all citizens of suf
ficient merit were declared eligible. The
decoration of the Legion of Honor is a
white-enameled, five-rayed star, on ribbon
of watered scarlet silk. Under the first
empire the star Dore a portrait of Napo
leon, and a wreath of oak intl
laurel, with the words, "Napoleon, Em
peror of France." On the reverse side was
the French eagle grasping a thunderbolt,
and the legend, "Honneur et Patrie." At
present, however, the obverse side of the
star bears the effigy of the republic and
the words "Republique Francaise." The
reverse side containH two tricolor flags
with the original legend.
Baron yon Schroeder takes pride in a
military decoration received from the
royal grandfather of the present ruler of
Germany. The Baron held the rank of
caDtain of cavalry in the Franco- Prussian
war of 1870, and so distinguished himself
as to obtain the award of the order of the
Iron Cross. This military order was
created in 1813 by Frederick William 111
to reward meritorious conduct of soldiers
in the war that was then being waged
against the first Napoleon. The iron cross
is black with a white border. It is very
highly prized by those who are entitled to
wear it.
The German Consul-General Adolph
Rdsenthal wears the order of the Red
Eagle, founded by Frederick I of Prussia,
and also the Commander's Cross of Franz
Josef of Austria.
O. Lohan, tne German Vice-Consul, has
two bronze medals, earned by him in the
Franco-Prussian war, in which he held the
| rank of first lieutenant. He has also been
invested with the order of the Ritterkreuz
by the German Emperor and with the
order of the Chevalier's Cross by Franz
Josef, Emperor of Austria.
The only member of the Danish order of
Dannebrog in the State of California is
John Simpson, Consul of Denmark in this
City. King Waldemar 11, called the Vic
torious, who reigned in Denmark from the
year 1202 to 1241, went, at the request of
the Pope, to Estland, on the bay of Fin
land, in the year 1219 with a fleet of 1400
ships and landed an army in order to sub
due the Estlanders, who were heathen,
and to convert them to Christianity. A
desperate battle (called Voliuer Slaget)
was fought at Reval. At first the Estland
ers were victorious.
The monks who accompanied, the
Danish army had gone to a nill in view of
the battle-field and were praying fervently
for the success of the Danes. The tradi
tion runs that suddenly a red banner, with
a white cross, the emblem of Christianity,
descended from heaven, and the monks
bore it down to the plain.
The sight of the banner so inspired the
Danes that they turned defeat into victory,
and since that memorable day this banner
has been the national ensign of Denmark
and is called Dannebrog. In commemora
tion of the event just described the King
founded this order in the same year, 1219.
The members are called Knights of the
onler of Dannebrog
A second degree of the order was founded
by King Frederick IV in 1671 and a third
by Christian VII in 1808. The order is be
stowed for valorous and meritorious con
duct in the service of the Government or
in science and literature.
The inscription on the cross should be
read in the following order: Gud og
Kongen, meaning, God and the King.
LEO THE EDITOE.
They Pope a Careful Keviser, "With the
Head of a Healthy Journalist.
According to the rumors from Rome the
Pope is now finishing anew pontifical doc
ument, addressed to the dissenting
churches, and claiming the supreme au
thority of the Holy See from the time of
St. Peter.
And just here it may be interesting to
note how the Pope gets out his encycli
cals. Leo XIII at first studies his sub
ject. When he forms the outlines of it in
his head he sends for one of the cardinals
or prelates who are in his confidence,
explains his general plan to him and re
quests him to develop it. This Cardinal
or prelate whom the Pope selects for his
collaborator is always a most eminent
Legion of Honor.
theologian. He works out and amplifies
the rough draft which the Pope confides to
him. When this is done he brings it to
his Holiness, who gives it the first re
vision, adding to it, correcting it or mak
ing excisions, as his judgment dictates.
When the Pope is satisfied with this first
study he turns the matter over to iiis
"Secretary of the Latin Letters," whose
function it is to translate the Pontifical
documents into Latin. This prelate is a
distinguished Latinist. When he receives
the first text of the encyclical, which is
always in Italian, he stretches it out in
long and elegant Latin periods. This done
the document is printed in the printing
establishment of the Vatican. The Pope
then gets the proof of it and immediately
begins to revise and correct it. Leo XIII
is hard to please in this matter.
He is very particular and often passes
sleepless nights meditating over the
cadence of a period. It is not the
perfection of style alone that he
aims at; betakes the greatest care to pre
sent his thoughts in all their shad-es and
shapes, fearing to let a single word go be
yond Ms idea and thereby leave room for
false interpretations. Sometimes the Pope
sends the encyclical to Cardinals and other
high ecclesiastics with the request for their
opinions. These learned men read care
fully the Latin text and return it to the
Pope with their observations. The Pope's
proof, loaded with notes, additions' and
excisions, is finally sent to the Vatican
printers, who return it to his Holiness in
its final form. At last the Pope has his
encyclical in proper shape; but it fre

THAT GARBAGE CONTRACT.
The Merchants' Association
Wants to Be Heard on
the Subject.
FIFTY YEAES IS TOO LONG.
Mr. Dohrmann Says It Would Be a
Direct and an Indirect Tax on
the People.
The Merchants' Association is very
much displeased with the manifest haste
of the Board of Supervisors in disposing
of the garbage question by awarding a
contract for the destruction ot the City's
refuse for as long a term as fifty years.
The association maintains that such a con
tract will give the successful bidders a
monopoly of a business for half a century
and that the public would be more heavily
taxed thereby than it is at present.
An effort was recently made to get the
Supervisors to defer definite action in the
matter until the association could present
figures and facts for the enlightenment of
the board. This was not done and the as
sociation yesterday sent the following
letter:
Gentlemen : Tnis association requested yonr
honorable board at its last meeting to post
pone action relative to the garbage franchise
until further data and Information could be
submitted upon this subject. In appearing
before your Healtn and Police Committee we
were informed that It was too late for any argu
ment upon thiÃ question, and now learn that
this committee will recommend the award of
this franchise for a period of fifty years far the
small sum of $5500.
Under these circumstances we reluctantly
address you again upon this subject, and it is
only on account of the great importance of
this question to San Francisco that induces us
to request you to give tnis communication
your special consideration.
We ful'y realize that the present method of
garbage disposal is obsolete and dangerous to
the health of the community. A decided im
firovenient in this direction is certainly abso
utely necessary. Were a franchise for a lim
itdd number of years now under considera
tion, or a provision included by which, in case
of necessity, the City wouid itself undertake
the disposal of garbage upon lair terms, tnis
association would gladly see the change con
summated without the least objection or de
lay. The award of this franchise, however, tor
the long period of fifty years in consideration
of the trifling sum of $5000, is a step that as
suredly should not be taken without the most
serious investigation and study.
We regret our inability heretofore to throw
light upon this subject, but will be able to pre
sent a detailed and complete report within ten
days. Therefore, unless the law compels the
award of this franchise at once, a short delay
is surely a reasonable request to make,
especially as it can be granted without injus
tice to any one interested.
There is. moreover, a grave uncertainty as to
which bid is really the highest, and upon this
question it would also be advisable to collect
the necessary data before final action is taken.
We would, therefore, respectfully request that
a time be set by your honorable board, when
facts and figures upon this question may be
submitted, and when other parties who wish
to do so may appear before you for this
purpose.
In conclusion, permit ns to correct a state
ment erroneously reported, that this associa
tion desires to bid upon the franchise for gar
bage disposal. This is not so; this association
neither could nor would be interested in any
such undertaking. On the contrary, we be
lieve that if possible the City itself should un
dertake this important work; or let it upon
such terms and conditions that will enable the
City to do so later, if impractical at present.
W r e certainly have no personal preferences as
to the successful bidder for this franchise. We
are deeply interested in this subject as citizens
and taxpayers, just as you gentlemen are, so

that the best possible terms are secured for the
benefit and welfare of the City and all its tax
payers and residents.
President Dohrmann of the association
had a few remarks to make upon the sub
ject. He said that Ihis is by far too im
portant to be rushed through without due
consideration, and all the association
wants is one week to present facts to show
the importance of the subject. In the first
place, the officers of the association do not
believe that the fifty-year contract is in the
interests of the City and the people. The
experience of officials of other cities shows
that garbage can be handled by the mu
nicipality at a great profit and to the trreat
relief of the people.' New York, Buffalo,
Columbus and other large Eastern cities,
to say nothing of the European cities, have
their own crematories and take, garbage
away from the householder gratis.
The reports of Colonel Warring, Super
mt ndent of Streets in New York, show
that the city derives a big revenue from
the sale of scrap iron, bones, brass, paper,
sacks, ratra, and a dozen other things that
find- their way to the dumps. These arti
cles at least pay for the free cartage of the
garbage from the houses. The product of
the crematory is converted into fertilizing
substance, also a source of profit. In some
cities the heavier product is converted
into brick' for cheap buildings. These
crematories, said Mr. Dolirmann, are con
ducted upon a very small direct tax upon
the people, and they are rated as the most
profitable of the cities' sources of revenue.
In speaking of the proposition of the
Supervisors to let the contract for a term
of fifty years Mr. Dohrmann said that a
great injustice will be done to the public.
The same system of cartine away the
garbage will be employed. The tarbage
gatherers will be obliged to charge higher
rates for their services, because they will
â¢ have to pay the contractors a fee of so
much per ton for disposing of the waste.
Thus it will be a direct and an indirect tax
upon the public, and it would be an out
rage to saddle such obligations upon the
people for half a century. With the march
of progress new methods will be devised
for disposing of garbage, yet for the small
sum of $5500 the City will be prevented
from keeping up with the times. This will
be burdensome from the start, but it will
be obnoxious before the contract expires.
What the association desires is that if
the contract be let it shall be upon
the agreement that the time shall not be
greater than five or ten years. If it is let
for a longer term the contract should con
tain a stipulation that the City could pur
chase the plant so as to dispose of garbage
on its own account.
Mr. Dohrmann is satisfied that but few
understand the importance of the ques
tion or the great profits in handling the
City's earbage. He says that he is sure
that, if understood, there would be many
who would bid for the contract and givÂ«
better terms. Even as it is it is a matter of
doubt whether the bid 6n which the con
tract was awarded was the best for the
City. At any rate the association'wants
the final settlement delayed for a few days,
so these matters may be determined.

THE CUBAN QUESTION.
The complicated relations between the
United States, Cuba and Spain, which are
now apparently drawing to a final settle
ment, have been furnishing country
with diplomatic problems for more than
fifty years. They have, in fact, engaged
the minds and energies of almost all of
our great statesmen from the earliest days
of the republic, and Adams, Clay, Web
ster, Everett, Clayton and Marcy, as well
as later Secretaries of State, have had to
deal with them. In tne present juncture
therefore it cannot be said that a new
issue In diplomacy confronts us. Our
statesmen have had full time to maturely
consider every aspect of the problem, and
it would seem we ought to be able to adopt
now some decisive course of action and
carry it out to the end without further
hesitation.
From the very first our diplomatists
made it known to Europe that the United
States would never permit Cuba to be
wrested from Spain by any European
power. Moreover, it was declared to be
the policy of this country to maintain that
attitude in regard to the island on our own
responsibility aud without seeking any
foreign alliance to confirm it. Thus in
1825, when the British Government sug
gested a tripartite agreement by which
Great Britain and France were to join the
United States in declaring that Cuba
should not be taken from Spain, Clay de
clined to enter into such an agreement.
Our course was to be strictly the outcome
of our own volition, and in no wise depen
dent upon anything in the shape of an en
tangling alliance.
In 1851 the question was reopened by an
attempt on the part of the British and
French Governments to induce the United
States to join them m a pledge not to
make any effort to acquire Cuba, but Sec
retary Everett declared first that the
treaty-making power under the constitu
tion could not permanently bind the Gov
ernment not to purchase Cuba as it pur
chased Florida and Louisiana; and, sec
ond, that no administration in this country
could stand for a day against the popular
odium which would result from making a
treaty with a European power which
would stipulate that at no future time
should Cuba become independent, or under
proper circumstances be annexed to the
United States.
A few years later the attitude of the
American "people toward Cuban affairs
was largely affected by the slavery ques
tion which at that time complicated every
issue that arose in our politics. In the
controversy resulting from the seizure of
the American ship the Black Warrior by
the Spanish officials in Cuba, many be
lieved that the slave-holders were in
clined to take advantage of it for the pur
pose of annexing Cuba and adding more
slave territory to the Union. This fear,
which found frequent expression in Con
gress, weakened the force of the adminis
tration in dealing with the subject, or else
at that time we might have brought the
long vexed problem to a conclusion either
by annexing the island or at least ridding
it of Spanish domination.
Prior to the outbreak of the irrepressi
ble conflict on the slavery question public
sentiment in all sections of the Union
and in both the great parties was dis
tinctly favorable to annexation. In an
article on "Secretary Marcy, the Cuban
Question and the Ostend Manifesto," pub
lished in the Political Science Quarterly
for March. 1893, Sidney Webster points
out that the conservative policy pursued
in regard to the island by Fillmore, Web
ster and Everett was distinctly unpopular
even with the Whigs both in Congress
and in the newspapers. Leading organs
of that party regretted that the adminis
tration did not acquire "the pearl of the
Antilles" and so prevent the incoming
Democratic administration from achieving
what seemed at that time the certain glory
of annexing the island.
Public opinion has changed to a great
extent since those days. With increasing
strength we have grown conservative.
There is no strong annexation party at
present in the country. Nevertheless
every one feels it is time the long running
sore should be definitely and permanently
healed, and whatever course to that end
may be adopted by the President and the
Senate will doubtless find an almost unani
mous support among the people.
A PAIE PEOPOSITION.
The State Development Committee has
made a record which entitles it to public
confidence. At an exceedingly small ex
pense it has already done much good in
making known in the East the superiority
of California fruits and has largely in
creased the sales of our products in that
way. So encouraged has it been by its
success that it has issued a proposition to
the fruit-erowers of California which they
cannot afford to ignore.
The basis of this proposition is that the
committee will forward the interests of
those who assist it with funds, and will do
tbis in exact and fair proportion to the
amount of assistance extended. This is to
be done without any interference with any
of the existing methods of shipping or dis
tribution, the idea being simply to adver
tise the fruits and thus create a demand
for them. The means to this end will be
lectures illustrated with stereopticon views,
and free cooking schools in which the art
of preparing California fruits for the table
will be taught. This work will be re-en
forced D 7 employing competent men to
canvass grocers and urge the handling of
California products. Minor features of the
undertaking will be the distribution of
printed matter and the display in jars of
California fruits, conspicuously labeled, in
show-windows throughout the East.
Such a course will have an ulterior effect,
the value of which should not be over
lookedâit will brine individual labels into
notice. A grower who contributes to the
work will naturally desire not only that
his name shall appear on bis product, but
will take care that what he offers for sale
will be of the best qualitj. The Develop
ment Committee will be prepared to receive,
and forward all orders. The general effect
will be the encouragement of individual
efforts to produce the best results.
The greatest profits in fruit culture in
this State have been made on the articles
which have been grown and prepared for
markfit with the greatest care. It has been
generally in ordinary articles sold in large
bnlk and prepared without special tare
that losses have been encountered.
COMING PROM PLOEIDA.
A killing frost of two or tiiree years ago
unhappily destroyed all faitb in Florida
as the Home of the orange. At the
same time it turned adrift an army of per
sons who had tasted the sweets of the in
dustry and would not be comforted in any
other occupation. Unwilling to return to
the hard and commonplace life represent
ed by other industries, they cast about for
some place in which they might resume
the business to which they had become so
strongly attached, and now it is an
nounced that they have found California
to be all that they want, and are preparing
to rehabilitate themselves in this State
with broad acres of orange groves.
Let not the orange-grower 3at present in
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 3896.
California be dismayed at the prospect.
To transfer a large incl ustry f rom an At
lantic State is something besides increas
ing competition in the marketing of a
product Experience has shown us over
and over that if we employ the resources
at our command for reaching consumers
ready for our products there will never be
such a thing as overproduction. That
aside, an increase of the bulk of produc
tion means a decrease of transportation
charges and an increase of a local consum
ing population. In addition it means a
necessity for extending the market, and
that in turn means a reflex benefit to
every industry in the State and such a
widening of the fame of the State as will
inevitably add greatly and steadily to its
population and wealth and to the comfort,
and prosperity of its people.
Thus passes forever the greatest glory of
that picturesque peninsula that separates
the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic
Ocean. Even though its climate had
proved suited to the orange industry, and
even though the fruit which it produced
wa3 sweet and toothsome, the peninsula is
hardly more than a vast sandspit, lacking
the inexhaustible fertility of the soils of
California. Besides, lor all the beauty of
the pellucid streams and splendid pine
forests of Florida, there was the ever
present menace of malaria, practically
unknown here, and an absence of that re
markably invigorating quality of climate
which is so distinguishing a feature of
California.
It is not alone in the marketing of whole
fruit that the good results of the orange
industry may be secured. Cordials and
syrups from the pulp, aromatic extracts
from the rind and medicines and perfumes
from the blossoms are valuable products
of intelligent industry. It is a wonderful
business in all its phases, and the condi
tions which make it possible are a pledge
of an environment the most pleasant and
beneficial that the heart could desire.
THE SUTEO CELEBEATION.
The formal opening yesterday of the en
terprises which Adolph Sutro has estab
lished on the ocean side of our peninsula
was a celebration of an event of uncom
mon importance. Besides being the throw
ing open of a group of attractions which
have been installed on the beach, it was
the beginning of the operation of an elec
tric road, constructed by the same pro
prietor, for reaching them comfortably and
economically. The scheme is thus made
complete, and for its magnitude and value
to the City, and especially for its fitness to
the natural conditions which obtain here,
is the greatest private enterprise of the
kind ever undertaken in America.
Not only that, but it is a wise investment
as well; for not only may it be reasonably
expected that the investment will yield a
handsome return iv itself, but it will pop
ularize, render easily accessible, and doubt
less greatly enhance the value of the vast
unimproved properties which Mr. Sutro
owns in that vicinity. This presumption
is mentioned merely to show that those
wealthy residents who are content to sit
idle and permit the enterprise and indus
try of less favored citizens to make their
property valuable might take a profitable
hint from the enterprise which Mr. Sutro
has displayed. If a few more of our
millionaires had a tithe of his energy,
public spirit and business sense, this City
would quickly become one of the greatest
in the country.
The peculiarity of his unique investment
is that it is devoted exclusively to means
for affording wholeso-ne pleasure. This
robs it of an appearance of sordidness.
Other wealthy citizens have made great
and expensive improvements which are
exceedingly valuable and wholly indis
pensable, because they are utilitarian; but
Mr. Sutro's achievement is so distinctive
and picturesque, and so perfectly comple
ments the natural charms of the City, that
it has a character with which no every-day
business investment can be compared.
His improvements include the rebuild
ing of the famous Cliff House with a struc
ture of elegant design and great dimen
sions; the most extensive and costly baths
in the world, having no rival in history
except the gorgeous baths of ancient
Rome; in connection with the baths a
nucleus of what promises to be one of the
most interesting museums in the country ;
an electric road more handsomely equipped
than any other. In addition should be
mentioned Sutro Heights, which, though
comparatively old, are part of the group
of fine attractions which Mr. Sutro has
created. All these properties and im
provements have a value running far into
the millions.
Mr. Sutro's public spirit has not stopped
there. He has announced that he will at
once deed the heights to the City. This
garden will be a splendid gift, as likely he
could pell it for more than a million
dollars. He will follow this with a gift to
the public of his library, the value of
which is incalculable. He has already
presented the State with a large site for
the Affiliated Colleges of the State Uni
versity, will furnish another site for the
library and has offered a site for the Wil
merding School.
It should not be forgotten that it was
Mr. Sutro alone who forced the Southern
Pacific people to reduce fares to the beach
from ten cents to five. To what extent
this has contributed to the happiness and
savings of the people may be imagined.
It is a pleasure to recognize and applaud
public spirit manifested on so splendid a
scale. This is just what San Francisco
needs from other of its millionaire*. The
fame which the City will enjoy from the
enterprise of this one man will extend to
the ends of the earth, bringing its benefits
to all, and by this act alone he has written
his name in broad and imperishable char
acters on the history of California.
A STEONG MEMOEIAL.
The memorial addressed by the commit
tee recently appointed for expressing the
views of California on the proposed fund
ing bill contains nothing of a conspicuous
character but what is already familiar to
the readers of The Call. Indeed, so many
are the reasons for not passing a funding
bill,- and so calamitous would be the re
sults of the act, that the space which tlie
committee gave itself in which to set forth
the case would have been inadequate.
Nevertheless the document is doubtless all
the stronger for being short, and all the
more effective for containing none but the
strongest points.
It remains now to be seen what recep
tion this petition will have at Washington.
In his desperation Mr. Huntington has es
tablished a literary bureau for "molding
opinion." at the National capital. At
present he is saying nothing about his
famous "equities," but is confining his ef
forts to an attempt at showing that the op
position in California to the funding bill
does not proceed from the "best citizens,"
and is merely the frothy mouthing of pro
fessional agitators aud chronic malcon
tents.
The people of California may take what
consolation they can out of this shir which
Mr. Huntington is pleased to cast upon
them, if it lacks any clement of insult
and defiance we are unable to discover it.
Such a policy Jias become so habitual with
him through thirty years of practice that
it is not surprising either that he should
find it natural and convenient in the
present emergency, or that he should scorn
to consider any of its possuile consequences.
Through this memorial the people of
California make their plea fora righteous
consideration of the case at the hands of
Congress. We have been forced by Mr.
Huntington's genius to beg merely that
right shall be done ; that the laws shall not
be violated; that the infamies which the
Southern Pacific has practiced all through
its career shall not be coadoned; that this
Government shall not be made the tool of
unscrupulous private ends; that a mo
nopoly of transcontinental shipping shall
not be fostered, and that the burden which
already oppresses California so heavily
shall not be increased and extended. That
is all. We want the law to take its proper
course, knowing that in such an event the
problem will be solved.
We cannot recall an instance in the
history of America when any State has
been placed in so humiliating a position as
California in this emergency. . That Con
gress should permit itself to be dictated to
by one man to the prejudice of the Nation
and the ruin of one of its States is in-.
credible. We trust that this dignified ap
peal from California will receive patient
and patriotic consideration.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"Have a smoke, boys."
Mr. Hugo Keil took a handful of cigars out of
his vest and passed them around among some
friends who met him in the dining-room of the
Occidental Hotel.
"Must have touched a nickel-in-the-slot .
machine, Hugo," suggested a friend looking
sidewise.
"Well, something of that character," re
sponded Mr. Kell, "and I wish to state that
the man who owns the nickel machine is a
separate and distinct kind ol human being all
by himself. Have you ever noticed the expres
sion on the face of a cigar-dealer when any
body is playing his interesting yet concealed
card game th-fouEh the medium of a nickel?
For instance, when you come up and -lay down
a half and ask for change in nickels he smiles,
rubs hi? hands and inquires if you feel lucky.
It is always best under these circumstances to
say yes, so as to prepare him for the shock that
invariably smites him if you win anything."
"But do you ever win anything?" said
somebody who had just appeared on the scene.
"Wait a minute and I will show you how the
HUGO KEIL BEATS THE MACHINE.
denier takes it when you do pull down a few
smokes. Well, as I was about to say, you begin
to drop your coin into the slot and whir) after
whirl is taken, but without satisfactory results
to yourself. Of course you keep on playing in
the hope of getting at least oue cigar, just as a
souvenir if nothing else. Finally you go broke
or else quit in disgust and then â oh thenâ the
man behind the counter rubs his hands in glee,
splits his face open witn joy and remarks that
you had better try it again, expressing the be
lief that your luck, will change, or else that
everybody can't win. He will keep up this front
of contentment as long as you are losing, but
when you winâ that is, when you win good and
hardâ a straight flush or something like that,
with perhaps an occasional full handâ you will
see oue of the most complete and interesting
pictures of dismay, griet and misory combined,
that was ever exhibited anywhere on earth. I
saw one of those pictures to-day.
"Here, boys, take a smoke, all of you, and I'll
tell you how the cigarman took the shock: I
happened to be passing his stand, and just as a
sort oi flyer stepped in and deposited a nickel
in the slot. I then pressed down the lever and
spun the cards. All red â three heartsâ four
heartsâ all hearts. Aceâ king and queenâ a
jackâ and by George a tenspot. Wow. Twenty
cigars. Straight flush. Well, sir, the dealer
looked into the machine, played with his jaw,
looked things over carefully once more and in
quired in a low and pained voice, 'Whal kind
do you smoke?' But when I had taken several
handfuls, he hauled down a book and began
to figure up how many straight flushes had
been rung up since breakfast. In less than one
minute he had counted up something in the
neighborhood of 1000, and I left him figuring
on how he could pay his rent. He protested
that he was being ruined by tne machine, but
I notice he has had it in his stand nearly a
year. Have a smoke, I say. The cigars are on
him this time."
The other day, at almost noon, two men
clambered down the stairs at the corner of
Sutter and Kearny streets into the well-known
coffee-saloon of Pan Davis, the old pioneer.
"Give mo a couple of fried eggs, some po
tatoes and a cup of coffee," said one of the
men, who was tall and slim and had a cork â¢
leg.
"Give me two dozen fried eggs, some potatoes
and a cup of coffee," said the other.
"I was astonished at this last order," said
Mr. Davis yesterday. I# l thought I had not
heard aright and asked again.
" 'Give me two dozen fried eggs,' he eaid. '
'Never mind how it may sound. I'm a little
hungry. I've got the money "to pay you.'
"He was a big man, whom the man with the
cork leg called Parsons, and who, I under
stand, is a telegraph operator. I thought if he
vas willing to pay for them I could stand it, so
I went and cooked two eggs for the first man,
whose name is Frank Howard, and then I
cooked two dozen eggs for Parsons. I cooked
a panful of one dozen first and gave them to
him, and while he was eating them I cooked
the second dozen.
"He ate the whole twenty-four, drank his
coffee, and then each paid his bill. I charged
$1 50 for the two dozen eggs, and the man
went away just as though he had only eaten
an ordinary meal."
For some time a man has been visiting dif
ferent restaurants and eating colossal meals of
eggs. He is known as the man with the boa
constrictor appetite and has caused consterna
tion in different hostelries.
Davis says this is the first experience of the
kind he has had, though he is an old caterer.

A CHAKMIXr. ENGLISH BOOK.
IN these days of diseased and morbid
fiction it is exceedingly pleasant to
discover here and there a writer whose
morals are sound and who is blessed
with a wholesome instinct of the pen
It has been a vc-ar since "The Golden
Age," by Kenneth Grahame, was pub- i
lished in thi3 country, and so far as a
limited inquiry has informed me it has
never become "popular" in this country â
a fact not to be wondered at when we con
sider the fine irt with which the book has
been constructed.
It is written by a man who while he
Writes occupies a boy's point of view, and
it perfectly achieves its purpose in present
ing the stupidity of grown-ups and the
fantastic imagery as well as the sordid
real life of healthy children. The chap
ters constitute a series of pictures and
happenings of childhood, and while the
surface is surpassingly delightful we can
easily see beneath it into still depths j
where the sadder and harder lessons and
errors of life are read. The author calls
the grown-up folk of his boyhood environ
ment "Olympians," and his prologue has
this to say of them:
Looking back to those old days, ere the pate'
Bhut to behind me, 1 can see now that to chil

things would have worn a different aspect.
Hut to thos â¢ whose nearest were uncles and
aunts a special attitude of mind may be al

enough as to the needs of the flesh, but after
that with indifference (an indifference, as I
recognize, the result of a certain stupidity),
and therewith the commonplace conviction
that your child is merely animal. At a very
early nge I remember realizing in a quite im
personal and ki:;dly way the existence of that
stupidity r.nd its tremendous influence in the
world, while there grew up in me, as in the
parallel case of Caliban anon Sou-bos, a vague

Age" reveals. However droll arc the
creations of Mark Twain and the happily
forcotten Peck, there is a forthright and
brutal coarseness in them that your gentle
man-Englishman avoids as he would
leprosy. In all the mischievous pranks of
tbese English boys of whom Grahame
i writes there is that sound and clean at-
I mospherti which the better classes of
Great Britain breathe from their infancy.
Ar.d that goes to the root of many things,
which we need not pry into here, but
which mean much to the student. No
American is as good as an Englishman if
he prefers what is bad in American litera
ture to what is good in English; and for
the education of American readers it is
well that every possible encouragement be
given to the American interests of British
writers.
One of the chapters is entitled "Alarums
and Excursions." The author and his
brother Harold had just agreed to play
that the\' were Cavaliers and Roundheads
respectively. But a spirit of unrest per
turbed Kenneth. "Instead," he exclaim?
[in recounting the incident, "of active
'pretense' with its shouts and perspira
tion, how much betterâ l heldâ to lie at
ease and pretend to one's self, in green
and golden fancies, slipping the husk and
passing, a careless lounger, through a
sleepy imaginary world of gold and
green !" Presently the combat began.
Then once more in this country's story the
mail-clad kni?hts paced throucrh the green
wood Bhaw, questing aaventure, redressing
wrong; and bandits, live to one, broke and
fled discomfited to their caves. Once again
were damsels rescued, dragons disemboweled,
and giants, in every corner of the orchard, de-
Erived of their already superfluous number of
ends; while Palaintdes the Saracen waited for
! us by the well, a:id Sir Breuse Pite vanished in
! craven flight before the skilled spear that was
his terror and his bane. Ouee more the lists
were dight in caraelot. and all was gay with
j shimmer of silk and gold; the earth shook
I with thunder of horses, ash-staves t\e>v/ in
splinters, and the firmament rang In the
clash, of sword on helm.
While the battle wai thus raging it hap
pened that a troop of cavalry came past
along the highway. The boys had never
seen a sight so wonderful and inspiring
"Down the road they came, two and two

One of the most charming sketches in
the book is entitled "Sawdust and Sin "
It seems evident here that the author has
invested his childish recollection of that
scandalous occurrence with the profounder
observation of a rich adult imagination
But that matters nothing, so exquisite is
the art of its teliing and so fine the humor
jof the conceit. For that matter who can
I place a limitation on the imagination of a
child, especially if he be of the order with
which some of us have become familiar?
In this sketch little Charlotte, a sister
has two dolls â one a bnxom English
maiden, with stout calves, riaxen hair and
remarkably innocent-looking blue eyes
and the other is a slant-eyed Japanese
male doll. Charlotte is trying to teil them
a wonderful story as she props them up
against a stump, but an evil design which
the Jap evidently has on the English
maiden entails all sorts of comical and
embarrassing hai.penings, to the great dis
comfiture of Charlotte's purpose. I have
intimated that there is a broad dash of in
sincerity in this delicious tale, but I know
of nothing finer in its way in the whole
range of English literature.
These hints must suffice to give an in
sight into the character of the book. It
may have been surmised that the extracts
j which I have presented were given more
for the purpose of analysis than review.
No doubt it has been already discovered by
every one of culture who may read this
that the English in which the story is told
is of .a rare and tine sort. Since Steven
son's death there are precious few who can
handle the language with the skill here
displayed. Stevenson covered tlie whole
range of the possibilities residing in the
language, from the elegance in his essays
to the "homespun" in "The Waster of
Ballantrae.'" Grahame discovers much of
this facility, but he is usually more direct,
with here and there a strong ruggedness,
of which Kipling, above all other living
writer.-, is the master, English is so rich
in idiom, and its idioms in themselves are
so strong, that it is good to find a writer
who can handle them so well as Grahame.
' The tendency of American literaiure'is
to ignore these rich resources of the lan
guage. If our sentences be but smooth
and our periods round and resonantâ if,
indeed, we but show that'we know some
thing of Latin and Greekâ we are emi
nently content with ourselves, forgetting
that the very soul of our language is of
Anglo-Saxon birth. English writers still
rest under the old spell, and a blessed
thing it is; and Kenneth Grahame (if that
is his name) deserves the thanks of every
lover of good English for putting forth
this happy little book of his. A genera
tion of Americans may yet arise who will
be able to appreciate its beauties and draw
benefit from its graces. W. C. Morrow.
THE STATE.
"The State, Its Functions, Its Rights
and Its Political Organization," is the
title of an essay to which a first prize has
been awarded by the American Philosoph
ical Society, held at Philadelphia for the
promotion of useful knowledge. The com
mittee of judges awarding the prize was
composed of J. Randolph Tucker of Vir
ginia, Jam?s C. Carter of New York,
George F. Edmunds of Vermont, E. J.
Phelps of Connecticut and C. Stuart Pat
terson of Pennsylvania. Tne author,
.George H. Smith, is a Californian, a resi
dent of Los Angeles, and in addition to
this prize essay is the author of several
other works on law and jurisprudence.
The essay is prefaced by an introduction
giving a general review of political the
ories advanced by leading thinkers from
Aristotle to Austin. From this review the
conclusion is drawn that political science
in its present 6tate is beyond all other 3
prolific in logical fallacy. 'Many examples
are given of the confusion resulting either
from bias or the careless u?e of such words
of vague import as state law, power, sov
ereignty, etc. Mr. Smith himself defines a
state as an "autonomous society of men,"
and regards government or political organ
ization, not as an essential element, but as
an inseparable accident of the state.
A clear distinction is thus made between
the Government and the state, and this
distinction forms a salient feature in the
theory worked out in the book. The
state, gays Mr. Smith, must be conceived
as consisting of tbe government and the
people. The end and the corresponding
function of the state is to promote the
happiness or well-being of the people in
every respect, but the agencies by which
this is effected are twofold, namely, by
government, which is organized force, and
without the intervention of government
by the natural influence of men upon each
other and by voluntary co-operation
Hence the end and corresponding function
of government is not co-extensive with
that of the state, and a proposition which
may be true of the one is not necessarily
true of the other.
The theory thus announced is worked
out%ith careful elaboration. The various
chapters deal with the nature of die state,
the functions of the state generally, the
nature' and method of jurisprudence, the
doctrine of natural right, the just powers
of the state and the principles of political
organization. The work is an important
contribution to the department of philoso
phy and displays wide reading and exten
sive study of the subject as well as clear
thought and marked powers of analytical !
reasoning.
G I.OKIES OF THE 'CHAFING-DISH.
"The Bachelor and the Chafing-dish" is
the title of a book that will readily com
mend itself to clubmen, and, in fact, to
men in general, who. the author says,
"have an instinctive fondness for meddling
with everything appertaining to the art of
cookery." The writer, Deshler Weld, has
gathered together in this book some valu
able recipes from fascinating sources in
cookery; triumphs of well-known bon
vivants in clubs, yachting circles, army
and navy, and "tbe dreams of fair women,
God bless 'em." Mr. Welch declares that
the "most important piece of machinery
in woman's domain is usually relegated to
an engineer of faultlessly persuasive ignor
ance. I have partaken of a more elaborate
and tasty dinner got up in a yacnt's
small galley than I have ever had from
'Bridget's' great kitchen, with all her con
veniences, and I have attended informal
dinners where everything served was
cooked directly in front of me on a chaf
ing-dish, with but very little trouble,
that produced a feast worthy of the
gods." He hails the chafing-dish
as a "civilizer," and maintains that it is
certainly an important factor nowadays
in breaking formality and bringing people
around a festive board under the happiest
sort of circumstances. "Its very general
use by both men and women, its con
venience for a quick supper or for a dainty
luncheon, and its succes as an economical
provider where it is necessaryâ all this is
putting the chafing-dish on a queenly
dais."
The author observes that he has had the
pleasure of knowing many distinguished
men in various walks of life, and he
thinks his most beguiling hours in tbfir
company were when some new culinary
"creation" was under discussion. "No
â¢ man understood the .value of â  a genial host
in 'I this v. respect '; better ,;; than ; the elder
Sothern, nor . could â¢ any man , turn ' a spit
with more energetic interest than Dion
Boucicault. Â£ But . men's V stomachs f Â« have
always been their I weaknesses, and it has
fairly been said that jiff women wished to
control the lords of creation it was 'only
necessary to treat I them | as kindly as they
would the bruteâfeed them !" *,' [Published

NEW KINDERGARTEN WORK.
A new volume of the International Edu
cational Series; containing "The Songs and
Music of : Friedrich Froebel's ; Mother
Play," has been published by D. Appleton
& Co., New York. The book will be : - in
valuable to kindergartens. The songs have â 
been newly translated and furnished with
new : music â ; prepared and arranged by
Susan 'E. Blow, who says in the preface:
"The poems in this volume are not - literal
translations of '?â¢ those >in ' the original '
Mother Play, but attempts to cast Froe
b'el's ideas into truly poetic form. A few
songs have been added in order to develop
the } thoughts i suggested in : some of the
! more important plays, j and a series of
Wandering Games has been given to illus
trate Froebel's method of genetic evolution.
Since most of the melodies in the original
Mother Play have - been .' condemned by
competent | critics,' new music is given in
this volume. This , music ; consists in part
of melodies written ;by ; composers <of ac
knowledged merit and in part of selections
from folk songs. A few of the best melo
dies in the original Mother Play have been
retained, and, finally, simeof the music of
Karl Reineke has-been used." The illus
trations are reproductions from the well
executed cuts of the Wichard Lange,edi
tion, long since out of print and now very
difficult to procure. The volume is edited
by W. T. Harris, LL.D. [For sale by Wil

THE FATHER OF THE FOREST.
A superb little bouquet of fresh verse by
William Watson, whose democratic inde
pendence and spirit are said to have lost
him the poet laureateship of England, has
just been issued by Stone & Kimball of
Chicago. "The Father of the Forest,',' the
longest poem of the collection, is an ad
dress to an old yew tree, which is besought
to answer such queries as these:
â¢ Old EmpÂ»ror Yew, fantastic sire, '- i; â ", .-.
â¢ Girt with thy guar^ of dolard Kings,
What a^es hast thou seen re. ire
r - Into the dust of alien things? â  ' â¢'â -;-â¢.
What mighty news hath siortned thy shade,
â  Of .armies perished, realms unmade
The poet pictures the thrilling events
and historical epochs which have marked
the centuri s of the old yew's existence,
from the Roman invasion, and then fan
cies the tree to murmur, as if in response
to the questions of his thoughts: ;
Who prates to me of arms and kings, '
. Hero in this court of old repose â 
Thy babble Is of transient things, ,
â  Broils, and the dust of foolish blows.
Thy sounding annals are nt best
The witness of a world's unrest. ; ,
Finally the yew, with welcoming eye,
sees approaching that millennial condition,
wherein Earth,
Wise from all the foolish past, â¢ . . . '
Shall venture hall at last .,
The advent of that morn divine " ' .
When nations may as forests crow.
Wherein the oak hares net the pine,
Nor beeches wish the cedars woe; â 
But all, in their unlikeness, blend .
Confederate to one golden endâ .
Beauty: the vision wherennto
In joy, with.panlings from afar, â¢ â "
Through sound and order, form and hue,
And mud and clay, and worm and starâ ' â 
Now touching goal, now backward hurled,
Toils the indomitable world. '
Watson's verse is nearly all character
ized by strength and richness. He breathes
truth without fear or favor,' and crowned
heads do not escape their, just deserts
wh n he deals with history, past or ; pres
ent. One of the poems of the new volume
OLD MAN JUCKLIN'S CHIEF DIVERSION.
[Reproduced from Opie Read's new novel.]
is dedicated to Henry Norman, the Eng
lish correspondent who created world-wide
comment by defending the American side
of the Venezuelan controversy in a leading
British journal. The book also contains
that now famous sonnet, "The Turk in
Armenia," in which Watson impeaches
England's inaction while it witnessed the
horrible atrocities of the Turks. "The
Tomb of Burns" is a brave tribute to the
favorite Caledonian bard. Here is an ex
ample of the stanzas to nature's poet:
With Bliatterlhg ire or withering mirth,
He smote each worthless claim to worth.
The barren fi? tree cumbering earth
He would not spare.
Through ancient lies of proudest birth
He drove his share.
Watson has a soft place in his heart for
Americans, and it is quite possible that
his poetry may be more widely admired in
this country than in the land whose rul
ing power made the poet more popular by
its frown. [For sale by William Doxey;

HIS PERPETUAL ADORATION.
Under this somewhat mystifying title J.
F. Flint has written a wholesome and in
teresting picture of soldier life during the
last war in this country. The hero, Rob
ert Armstrong, not only fights his coun
try's battles at the head of his regiment,
but wages the "warfare that goes on under
the skin," and in this, too, comes out vic
tor. Of the materials afforded by this dual
warfare the author gives us a readable
narrative, which is, nowever, somewhat
maried by his own attitude toward it.
"Why," he asks in his preface, "should
vice eclipse virtue in latter-day art and
literature?" The only apparent an
swer to this question is that it does
not. There is, unquestionably, much
that is weak and vicious and pernicious in
modern literature, but there is, on the
whole, much. more that is wholesome and
true, that makes for literary and artistic
righteousness, and Mr. Flint's naive as
sumption, that in putting forth a simple,
straightforward story of a man's battle
with and victory over the forces of evil
within himself he has given the world
something unique, is as untrue as it is ab
surd, it is an assumption which materi

A DAUGHTEK OF HUMANITI.
This is a story by Edgar Maurice Smith
dealing with certain phases of the intro
duction of women into mercantile life.
The heart of the author has evidently been
deeply moved by the struggles of young
women to earn an honest livelihood In onr
great cities, and some elements of this
struggle he has woven into a narrative,
which he dedicates to "Every pure woman
struggling to gain an honest livelihood."
That the book is an entirely serious study
of a very painful side of life roust be con
ceded, but it is not a study that, from the
standpoint either of art or utility, should
have been made in the form of notion.
Judged by literary standards the work is
sufficiently poor to be irritating, a circum
stance whicn must interfere with its use
fulness. This is a pity, for the world needs
much of the information Mr. Smith has
gathered and might make use of it were it
presented in more legitimate form. [Bos

OPIE BEAD'S LATEST NOVEL.
"The jucfclins," by Opie Read, is in line
with that author's best work. It is a
good, wholesome Southern novel, abound
ing in pathos and humor. Nobody can
read the passages relating to old man
Juckiin, who had a craze for chicken
njrhting, and whenever he got vexed went
out and set his two favorite fowls to pick
ing and scratching each other, witnout
feeling refreshingly amused. His daugh
ter, 'â¢Guinea,' 1 is a sweet character that
the reader will be certain to admire. Mr.
Read himself thinks "The JucklinÃ" his
best work. It is published by Laird &
Lee of Chicago. Price, $1.
"THE PUKPLE COW."
If the author of the "Purple Cow" had
only known what the English Premier ex

are not familiar with that remarkable pro

opinion that it ia quite as forcible as

THK FEBRUARY MAGAZINES.
McClure's Magazine takes its first grasp
; of the reader's attention with eight por
traits of Lincoln (several of them very
rare), some twenty other Lincoln pictures,
and an account, abounding in vivid per
sonal details of Lincoln's misfortunes as
a country merchant, of his entrance into
the Legislature, and the beginning of his
acquaintance with Douglas, of his work as
a Village postmaster and a deputy county
surveyor, of his study of Shakespeare and
Burns and a copy of BlacKEtone found by
chance in a barrel of refuse, and of his ro
mantic courtshiu of Ann Rutledge, and
his affliction at her death shortly before the
time appointed for their marriage.
The Lee family of Virginia is the subject
! of a series of profusely illustrated articles
which will constitute a leading feature in
Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly during
the current year. The February number
contains the initial article of the series,
entitled "Tho Ancestors of General Robert
E. Lee, and tho Times in which They
Lived," written by Mrs. Roger A. Pryor,
embodying many rare portraits, coats-of
arm.Â«, etc. Tins same February number
of Frank Leslie's also contains beautifully
illustrated articles upon "A Roman
Festa," by Theodore Tracy; "Sardinia,"
by Charles Edwardes; "The Social Settle
ment in America," by Rufus R. Wilson;
"West Point," by Carl J. Becker; "Art
Students in Paris"; and stories, sketches
and poems by Howard Paul, George Edgar
Montgomery. Dr. J. H. Porter, J. F. Sulli
van, Ella Rodman Church, Lena L. Pep
per and other popular contributors.
The complete hovel in the February issue
of Lippincott ; s is "Ground-swells," by Mrs.
Jeannette H. Wai worth. It is a readable,
lively, and "up-to-date" tale. Dr. Harvey
B. Bashore gives an interesting epitome of
the furthest researches of geolocy in a
rapid sketch of "The First Days of the
World." "The Aerial Monasteries of
Greece 1 ' are described by Charles Robin
son, James Knapp Reeve writes of "What
Men Drink." "The Child and His Fic
tions" is a p-leasant paper by Elizabeth
Ferguson Seat. Frederic M. Bird points
out certain "Paralyzers of Style," some of
which are intended to have a precisely op
posite effect, while some are the result of
mere carelessness. The poetry of the num
ber is by Joseph Wharton, Charles G. D.
Roberts and Clinton Scollard.
Among the articles of special interest in
the Century is one on "Pope Leo XIII and
His Household," by Marion Crawford, a
personal account of the daily lite of the
Pope, accompanied by portraits and pic
tures from photographs of the Pope's
private apartments taken for this article
and not elsewhere accessible. Henry M.
Stanley retells "The otory of the Develop
ment, of Africa." Captain Alfred T.
Mahan, the distinguished naval critic,
contributes the first of several papers on
Nelson's naval victories, dealing with
"Nelson at Cape St. Vincent," which is
illustrated with portraits and diagrams.
A paper written before the President's
Venezuelan message, but dealing with the
present situation, is "The Palmerston
Ideal in Diplomacy." by Edward Mortimer
Chapman. A picturesque paper on "Cer
tain Worthies and Dames of Old Mary
land" is contributed by Dr. J. W. Palmer
(himself a Marylander). It includes por
traits and pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds,
Sir Peter Lely, Charles Wilson Peale, Rem
brandt Peak-, Sully and others. An illus
trated paper on Puvis de Chavannes,
president of the Salon of the Champ-dc-
Mars, derives additional interest from the
fact that his decorations for the Boston
Library have recently been put in position.
The article is fully illustrated with pic

THE THEATRES
LAST week was a stagnant one, as
far as dramatic novelties were con
cerned. True, the Frawley Com
pany sustained its popularity
with a play in which it has not
appeared before, though the drama itself
is well known here ; and at the California
Theater "Old Kentucky" showed that it
was not old enough to have ceased to at
tract the public. But the pleasant, smooth
acting in "Men and Women," and the al
luring sensationalism of "Old Kentucky,"
backed by "The Editor" at Morosco's, and
the perenniai "Inon" at the Tivoli; even
these combined attractions could not
dazzle us into thinking seriously that
we were keeping up with the march of
histrionic progress. In fact, if we com
pared the latest styles of the season,
as displayed in last week's New
York theaters, with what was offered
us for sale at the theaters in this city, the
comparison of a newly decked store to a
last season's bargain counter sprang
unbidden to our minds. Sarah Bernhardt,
in "Izyel," Crane in "Governor of Ken
tucky," the Daly Company in "The Count
ess Guchi." Stuart Robson in "Mrs.
Ponderbury's Fast," "TneStrange Adven
tures of Miss Brown," at the Standard,
etc. â they are names to us, these new
plays, names and nothing more, but we
can buoy ourselves up with the hope that
if we live long enough, and the plays sur
vive a sufficiently lengthy period, we may
in liruo behold some of them.
"The play's the thing to catch the con
science " say some of the moralists who
uphold the drama, and who do not think
it a sin to cut Shakespeare off in the mid
dle of a sentence. The conscience catching
play was tried at the Alcazar last week,
but statistics as to its beneficial moral re
sults are not yet at band.
The event of the coming week will be the
reappearance of the Tavary Company.
"Aida" will be the opening performance,
and strangely enough the event marks an
anniversary of twenty years since the same
manager, Charles H. Pratt, first brought
"Aida" to San Francisco.
Baldwin Theater.
Grand opera will ba the programme at
the Baldwin for the next three weeks,
during which time we are to witness no
less than fifteen different operatic produc
tions, staged and sung by the Marie Tavary
Grand Opera Company. The organization
has this season eclipsed its former achieve
ments,and now stands as a complete and
Btrong combination of lyric talent. Its
list of artists embraces such brilliant sing
ers as Mme. Tavarv, Mme. Lichter, Thea
Dorre, Bella Toml'ins, Sophia Romani,
Annie Frankiyn, A. L. Guille, Payne
Clarke, Max Eugene, A. Abrahamhoff,
William Shuster, William Stephens and
S. H. Dudley.
Marie Tavary is a singer who has a
record of many years of successful work.
Thea Dorre, the prima donna mezzo
soprano, is a singer and actress who ha? a
great career before her. Added to a fine
voice and a spiendid vocal method, she
has the dramatic talent tnat modern lyric
drama requires of a successful prima
donna. Last year, as Carmen and Santuz/a,
sue made a warm place for herself in the
hearts of the San Francisco public, and
this year she has added a marvelousiy
successful interpretation of Mignon to her
prima donna roles.
Anna Lichter, the secunda donna, is
said to be a very gifted singer and actress.
Another new member of the organization
is Miss Bella Tomlins, a young contralto,
who is said to be the possessor of a fine
voice.
Among the male members of the com-

pany new to us comes the barytone, Max
Eugene, and the basso, A. Abrabamhoff.
The favorite tenor, A. L. Guille, will again
be heard, as will Payne Clarke and William
Stephens.
The opening opera to-morrow nieht will

be Verdi's "Aida." This will be followed
on Tuesday night by "Carmen." Wednes
day matinee "The Bohemian Girl." On
Wednesday night Marie Tavary will be
heard in the role of Valentine in Meyer
beer's "The Huguenots." The bill for
Thursday night is to be "Mignon," for
Friday night "Cavalleria Eusticana" and
"I Pagiiacci." The Saturday matinee per
formance is to be "Martha' 1 and in the
evening "Lohengrin."
California Theater.
The Kimball Opera Comique Company,
composed of sixty people, singing, dancing
and merry-making in the operatic extrav
aganza, "Hendrick Hudson Jr.," will be
the attraction at the California Theater for
one week, commencing to-morrow ni^ht.
The leading character is Corinne, who
has a good opportunity to display her
talents. The several costumes of Hen- '
drick Hudson, ranging from the rakish
cap and swaggering high boots of the
dauntless explorer to the Jace mantilla
and crimson shirts of a Spanish coquette,
all enhance her beauty. It is said she
never before sang so well as this year.
The extravaganza is said to be cleverly
constructed and brightly written, and
the scenery is new and every costume was
made expressly for this season.
The organization contains a number of
specialty performers, the most prominent
of which are: Ben F. Grindell, Charles
Fostelle, Lindsay Morrison, Harry Dicker
son, J. Henry Mack, Frank Hayden, Otto
Craft, the Nichols sisters (Mabel and
Lulu), Lillian Kuott, Fanny Decosta and
Georgia Rush.
After its brief season of burlesque the
California Theater will offer Us patrons a
treat in a fortnight of classic tragedy under
the most favorable conditions. Thomas
Keene, a great favorite here, where his
first success was won and his career suc
cessfully begun, will come to that house on
Tuesday night, February 11, supported by
a Jarge company of players selected for
their excellence in legitimate roles, for
a series of productions, with fine scenic
effects and stage accessories, of such plays
as "Louis XI," "Richard III," "Riche
lieu,' 7 "Hamlet" and "Othello." The
opening will be "Louis XI."
Grover's Alcazar.
The play for the coming week at the Al
cazar is "The Arabian Nights," by Sydney
Grundy.
Arthur Huramingtop, during his wife's
absence, reads "The Arabian Nights" and
is much struck by the adventures of the
Caliph Haroun. He determines to pursue
a similar course himself, and putting on
several disguises frequents various parts
of the city in search of adventures. Some
funny situations are brought out through
these adventures.
The cast will contain all the favorites of
the company and a funny performance
may be anticipated.
The Wednesday "Pop" matinee will con
tinue the icecream and cake service.
Columbia Theater.
The Frawley Company begins its fare
well week at the Columbia Theater to
morrow night. The company will not ap
pear again in this City till summer.
As "Men ana Women" has proved the
banner performance of the present season,
it has been decided to give that play for
the coming week.
The American comedienne Miss Katy
Putnam will be an early attraction at the
Columbia Theater, presenting for the first
time here her new picturesque comedy
drama by C. T. Dazey, the author of "In
Old Kentucky," entitled "The Old Lime
Kiln."
Grand Oi>erÂ»-House.
The first San Francisco production of
" Bins of the Night," by Frank Harvey,
will be given to-morrow evening at the
Grand Opera-house.
Harvey is the author of such well-known
works as "The Wages of Sin," "The Land
of the Living," "Woman Against Woman"
and "Fallen Among Thieves." "Sins of a
Night" is said to eclipse them both from a
literary and dramatic standpoint.
Tivoli Opera-Home.
To-morrow evening at the Tivoli Opera
house will be given the initial perform
ance of the new American opera, "The
Gentle Savage." The book is from the
pens of Estelle Clayton, the well-known
actress, and Nym Crinkle, the celebrated
dramatic writer of tue New York press.
The music was composed by a very talented
young musician, the late E. I. Darling, and
is said to be bright and catchy.
The story of th c opera is said to be sim
ple and striking. In order to make the
production a worthy one new scenery,
costumes and accessories are to be pro
duced. The ballet, which was a feature of
"Ision," has been trained by Miss Cook in
several characteristic Mexican dances.
The dancers will be accompanied in
thesp dances by a typical Mexican orches
tra under the direction of Senor Bai>cho.
The howling swell, the modern Indian,
will be played by Ferris Hartman.
John J. Ilaffael will be the young Amer
ican officer, Lieutenant Arlington; Martin
Pache, the Mexican Sancho Mendingo;
Thomas C. Leary. the merry sergeant;
little Gertie Carlisle, his companion the
drummer-boy Tippy ; Laura Miliard, Lola

Bon-Bon. [
At the Orptaeuirs.
To-morrow evening three new acts will

be added to the bill at the Orpheum, and
those sustaining tbern are all well known
in their lines.
CarrolJ Johnson, the celebrated min
strel; Bill Carter, the well-known come
dian and banjoist, and Emmonds, Em
merson and Emmonds, a clever comedy
trio, will be the new aspirants for the
plaudits of Orpheum patrons.
Rachel Walker, who b?_? become a
great favorite, will still continue on the
bill and will introduce a number of new
songs. De Bessell, who proved the great
est novelty last week, will continue his
rapid clay modeling. *
Bush-Street Theater.

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" will oDen this after
noon at the Bush-street Theater.

warm praise for its performance of the
play based on Harriet Beecher Stowe's
popular story.
Soiuh'h Band.
John Philip Sousa's band opened at
Washington on January s its eighth semi
annual tour, which will conclude at Man
hattan Beach in July. Sousa's novelties

The coming recitals by the great Pader

evening of Monday, February 10, and the
afternoons of Wednesday, the 12th, and

amount of interest among music lovers
and amusement seekers in "general.

cers of the Cristoforo Colombo will attend

A GHOULISH PLAY.
But It Pleases Gay and Careless
Paris.
Some of the plays now running in Paris
pile horrors on horror's head. "Une
Mere," a translation from the Swedish of
Mme. Ellen Ameen, wrestles with the
problem of whether deformed children
should be destroyed, and settles it with a
Spartan affirmative.
This horrible play is, however, anodyne
when compared with the ono that succeeds
it, "Les Flaireurs," by Charles Van Ler
bergh, a Belgian, who calls it a "symbol."
It is impossible to imagine anything more
lugubrious, more terrifying, than this
nightmare of a play, the whole action of
which passes in one and the same seene â
a miserable garret- room, in which a poor,
j wretched old woman is lying at the point
of death on a mattress, with a young girl,
her daughter, at her side.
The Flaireurs are the precursors of
death ; the bearer of the water and sponge
to wash the body, the man with the
shroud to clothe the same, and the man
who brings the coffin; they cail for their
prey, the dying old woman. They
come knocking at the door, one after
the other. The terrified young girl
refuses to open and throws herself
against the door to keep out the
intruders, while the old woman sits up
in bed and opens her eyes wide with ter
ror. In the midst of a dreadful, unearthly
noise, and as midnight is striking, the
door suddenly opens and they all enter,
unseen, however, as they are but symbols;
with them enters death (personified by
a ray of light, like that of spring, in the
Valkyrie) who with his icy breath blows
out at the same time, the two candles, and
the life of the old woman. Never has the
terrible been more strikingly portrayed,
with more art, intensity and violence than
in these symbolic scenes, which are full of
the horror of death, of the dread of the un
known. Maurice Maitterlinck has already,
in "L'lntrus," tried to similarly express the
atmosphere of death; with an art, how
ever, less violent and more refined, he does
not produce the same impression oi its
horror.
HIS IiAST WISH.
How the Berkeley Faculty Will Start a
Bosewald Memorial Fund.
Every one remembers the touching in
cident connected with the late J. H. Rose
wa'd's death. He was to have delivered a
musical and illustrated lecture on "De
scriptive and Characteristic Music" at
Berkeley for the benefit of the Poor Stu
dents' Loan Fund on the very night on
which he died. Mr. Rosewald was so de
sirous to help the good cause and so
anxious not to disappoint his audience
that he did not realize the grave charac
ter of his brief disease aad died while ex
pressing a hope for his immediate recov
ery for the evening's work.
The Berkeley faculty is desirous to
honor his memory by starting a Rosewald
memorial fund in. connection with tne
students' loan fund. It is believed that
this fund ought to be the result of the
musician's last effort, and so his lecture,
which he did not live to deliver, will be
given under the auspices of the university
faculty at tne Columbia Theater on
Friday, February 21, at 3:30 p. M.
Messrs. Beel, Jaulus and Coffin and the
Misses Morey and Weigel have promised
to carry out the musical part of the pro
gramme, while the text will be read by one
of Berkeley's most popular professors.
The lecture and the death of the writer
are so pathetically interwoven that they
cannot fail to appeal to the friends of the
worthy charity to be benefited as well as
to the many friends whom the genial and
liberal-mlnaed musician left to mourn
him.
Dramatic Brevities.
"A Milk White Flag" comes to the Bald
win next month.
Hoyt's "A Texas Steer," with Tim Mur
phy, is booked for the Columbia Theater.

Theater in "A Wicklow Postman."
Jessie Bartlett Davis is suing a Western
publishing house which put her portrait on
the title page of a sensational novel.
Richard Mansfield is one of the Baldwin's
attractions for April as is also Augustin
Daly's company, headed by Ada Rehan.
Fay Templeton is composing a com
panion song to "I Want Yer, Ma Honey,"
which she will sing this week in "Excelsior
Jr.," in the theater part of Hammerstein's
Olympia.
A PLUCKY LITTLE WOMAN.
Mrs. Cornelia Burbank Arrests
Mrs. Hawley Alias Jane
Simpson.
Eighteen Months Ago Mrs. Hawley
Stole Her Sealskin Jacket and
Disappeared.
A woman who has been wanted by the
police for the past eighteen months, was
captured yesterday afternoon on Mason
street by Mrs. Cornelia Burbank of 1111)4
Leavenworth street, one of her victims,
and taken to the City Prison.
in October, 1894, the woman called at
Mrs. Burbank's lodging-house to engage
rooms. She said her name was Mrs. Haw
ley, and her husband was a sea captain.
She had been living in Australia, but, as
her husband had procured the command
of a ship trading along the coast, she had
decided to live here. She had arrived by
the Cicy of Puebla from Victoria, and her
baggage was on board the steamer. The
rooms suited her and she made herself at
home.
She told Mrs. Burbank that she had
nothing but English irioney, which the
landlady refused to take, and to accommo
date her till she got the money changed
she gave her $1 25. Then she complained
of the cold and asked Mrs. Burbank to
lend her a wrap till her baggage arrived.
Mrs. Burbank gave her a sealskin jacket,
which cost $75, and she left the house with
it to buy a few things, but she never came
back.
Mrs. Burbank reported her loss to the
police, and about the same time the police
received complaints from several other
ladies about the same woman, who had
told them much the same story and had
taken her departure with some articles of
value belonging to them.
Mrs. Burbank met Mrs. Hawley on Ma
son street yesterday afternoon and, recog
nizing her, demanded her sealskin jacket.
Mrs. Hawley at first denied her iden
tity, but Mrs. Burbank was persistent and
finally she suggested they should go to her
room and talk it over. Mrs. Burbank re
fused, and, although a little woman, Mrs.
Burbank compelled Mrs. Hawley to walk
with her to police headquarters. On the
way they met Policeman Gaynor and he
rang in for the patrol wagon.
At police headquarters Sergeant Colby
remembered that several complaints were
registered against her and ordered her to
be locked upon the charge of embezzle
ment, Mrs. Burbank being the complain
ing witness. She gave the name of Jane
Simpson, a native of Australia. She did
not deny she was the woman Mrs. Bur
bank had been looking for, but said she
had received the sealskin jacket as a pres
ent, and it was a "moth-eaten thing any
how," which was emphatically denied by
Mrs. Burbank.
It is likely that other charges will be
preferred against Mrs. Hawley, alias Jane
Simpson.
YPA ADDIS' APPEAL.
Her Ex- Husband Has Moved That It Be
Dismissed.
C. A. Stbrke has filed notice of a motion
to dismiss the appeal of Yda Addis Stoike
from the decree of divorce which her hus
band sued for and which was granted to
him.
The motion to dismiss will be made
upon the ground that the decree of divorce
orders the plaintiff to pay sufficient
alimony to the defendant, and that, as the
alimony has been paid, she cannot com
plain of any errors in the court below, as
she ha 3 reaped the fruits of such judgment,
whether right or wrong. The motion will
be made on the further ground that the
defendant moved to set aside the mdf
ment and degree appealed from, and she
cannot therefore appeal from a judgment
which she is attempting to have *et aside.
T-he divorce was granted to Storke by
the courts of Santa Barbara on January
14, 1895. Mrs. Storke is the authoress
known as Yda Addis.
At California-Street Church To-Day.
Services of unusual interest will be held to
day in St. Pawl's Episcopal Church. California

mon. A special musical service will be given
at each service by the vested choir of mixed
voices.

seems a long way back from then to the
quaint products of the artist's childish
skill." About twenty-five yearaairo. while
young Gibson was ill in Boston, his father,
to amuse him, began cutting out of paper
with a pair of scissors figures of dogs, â 
horses and cows. The lad soon found that
ke, too. could make pictures, and the little
fingers were soon busy turning out silhou
ettes of everything that attracted his I
childish fancy. He became as skillful I
with the scissors as many an artist is with i
his brush. ' He showed no desire to draw, !
however, "and of all who marveled at his i
knack of picture-making, and wondered j
what would come of it, probably no one ;
imagined that in later life he would win a :
brLliant reputation with his pencil.' 1 j

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896.
THE FREE PUBLIC MARKET
Edward F. Adams of Highland
Grange Discusses Its
Benefits.
THREE STRONG REASONS FOR IT.
Commission Merchants Often Sell to
Themselves at Prices to Suit
Themselves.
Edward P. Adams of "Wrights,, who was
appointed first by Highland Grange in
Santa Clara County and subsequently by
the California Fruit Exchange to confer
with the Harbor Commissioners relative
to the free public market, was in the City
yesterday. He is heartily in favor of the
proposed measure, and believes that it will
prove satisfactory to the shipper as well as
the consumer. Speaking to a Call re
porter on this subject he said :'
Regarding the proposed market there are
two entirely distinct propositions involved,
having only a slight chance connection. Upon
the one hand the. Merchants' Association de
sires the establishment of a series of Iree retail
markets . scattered over the City on the Eastern
plan. Upon the other the producers living at
a distance from- the' City desire a regulated
wholesale market on the water front. The
fact that when the Merchants' Association
took up the matter it found us dealing with
the Harbor Commission, and also tne fact that
an overflow from the wholesale market would
afford the opportunity at small expense for an
experimental -free market, brought us to
gether.
The Merchants' Association, also, is a broad
gauge institution, having regard to the general
interests of both City and State. It iully recog
nizes the importance of our movement, and
lends its a*d to it. As it is well organized and
effective, I am seeking -to have it assume the
leadership in the entire enterprise, both lor
the wholesale and retail markets.
There are three reasons for a wholesale mar
ket: First, a desire ior the most economical
method of marketing; second, quantity of per
ishable products shipped to this City; third,
the removal of some existing abuses. We 6tart
with the general proposition that the water
front is the place where the City and country
ought to deal together. The producers should
own the goods until they reach the water
front, and when they come inside of it they
should be the property of somebody else who
has put, his money into them. There is the
saving of cartage, the saving of rent, and the
concentration of business to the convenience
of both buyers and sellers, all in the interests
of economy.
In regard to the second proposition, San
: Francisco is now largely supplied by cull fruit
which will not bear the expense of Eastern
transportation. This is not altogether true.
Canneries will notbuv cull fruit, and much of
that which we call culls is of the very best of
fruit, but too ripe for a- ten-day journey. The
greatest evil is its miserable method of pack
j ing, unfitting it for family use. It is my belief
i that a concentration of this evil, together with
the market organization and the suggestions
and efforts of the inspector, will result in the
introduction of some new small, neat and con
venient packages which will get the fruit to
the tables of tne consumers in something of its
original freshness. The natural emulation
among growers resulting from the daily exhi
bition of their fruit side by side will tend to
bring this about. This will be good lor con
sumers, for they will get better stuff, and it
} will be good for producers, for they will sell
j more of it. I think our home market the best,
I and we have never half worked it.
What are the abuses complained of? In the
first place,- commission merchants do both a
commission and private trade. This some
times results in sales of produce by agents to
themselves at prices fixed by themselves, the
owner supposing it to have been sold to third
parties. This practice is the foundation and
excuse of all the evils complained of except
downright steeling by false returns, which is
unquestionably done sometimes by disreputa
ble men who are liable to creep into any busi
ness. Then there are more or less actual
frauds every year when rascals succeed in get
ting consignments and decamp with the entire
proceeds. Thf result of ihe system as it now
exists is a belief on the part"of the growers
generally in the entire rottenness or the com
mission business in this City. This belief is
not justified by the facts, but itexists, and we
wish to remove the conditions which lead to It.
It is not my intention to dispense with com
mistion men. "Nobody who understands the
business would either expect or desire it. The
stuff must be sold by somebody, and for the
most part, upon eight to thirty days' credit.
We want it sold by responsible people who un
derstand the business and who are prepared
for proper pay to take the labor and risk of
collections. The growers have ho orÃanigation
effective enough to market the material, and if
they had it would cost thousands and thou
sands of dollars to educate their agents.
How do I expect the market to correct the
abuses? Simply by the fact that the market
being on State property, tne Harbor Commis
sioners may prescribe the regulations under
which business may be done there. These
would simply be buch as to insure that no
trading should be done- within the wholesale
market, except for account of owners, or by
the owners themselves, and that every trans
action should be a public record. This, with
an inspector to see the regulation enforced,
and perform sundry other duties implied by
the name, is, in my judgment, all that is
necessary to make San Francisco the most at
tractive market in the country to the fruit
growers. And that is what both City and
country need.
As it now stands few producers deal here if
they can he.lp it. To repeat, we desire the
commission agents to go down on the wharf
and sell our goods for us and give us all the
receipts, less charges. What business they do
on theirow.n account is none of our affair, but
we don't want the two businesses mixed up.
What special difficulties are in the way?
The most serious difficulty is the change of
point of delivery of the Southern Pacific broad
gauge lines from King and Townsend streets to
section 4of the seawall. This involves a very
serious problem for the railroad to consider.
It would seem simple, but it is not. It would
cause them a good deal of initial expense. So
far as I can understand it, however, I think
the expense to them would be far less than the
gain to the community.
The immense volume of fruit now landed at
King aud Townsend streets now has to bear a
mile or more of rough cartage, wcich is in
jurious to the fruit and costs the growers about
$20 per car. The usual charge is 2 oents per
crate, or $1 66 per ton, although other freight
is moved, I understand, at about 50 cents per
ton over the same route. I have conversed
with some officials of the company, and they
fully appreciate the importance of the matter
and are approaching the subject in a spirit
which promises a satisfactory, solution. There
are other difficulties of the "same nature, but
far less serious, in connection with river steam
ers now discharging at other wharves. None
of the difficulties, however, are insuperable.
Another matter is the question of available
room. Until the tonnage during the three
most congested months has been computed we
cannot estimate the room required.
This; however, is certainly a matter that can
be managed by the Harbor Commissioners
within a little time, if not at first. If public
convenience requires it a T wharf can be ex
tended from section 4 to accommodate all the
Bteam traffic, leaving the present shed en
tirely free for that coming Dy rail. President
Colnon expressed nhnseifto me as favorable
to that proposition should the traffic demand It.
What further steps are to be taken in re
gard to the matter? Well, the first thing is a
formal conference between the Harbor Com
missioners and a committee appointed for the
purpose by the Merchants' Association, at
which all legal and other questions involved
will be discussed and the place apparently
most feasible determined.
Next the tonnage to be handled daily during
the busy season is to be estimated and the ques
tion of available room and convenience of de
livery considered. We shall then know the
essential elements involved in the problem.
There will then be called a public meeting to
which will be specially Invited a few of the
largest producers, representatives of producers'
organizations, representatives of the transpor
tation interests, and others presumed to have
special knowledge of the subject, or interesta
in it. The general public will alro be invited,
and any one who has anything to offer, pro or
con, will have the opportunity to do so. At
the close of that meeting the public will be
fully advised as to all the essential factors in
the case and will proceed to exercise its com
mon-sense.
If a market is found to be desirable and feas
ible a way will doubtless be found to get one.
If found undesirable or impracticable it will
be dropped. N6ne of those actively engaged
in the movement are as yet definitely com
mitted to anything except a thorough investi
gation. With my present information the pro
ject looks to me desirable, feasible and likely
to be accomplished, but further study may
show that I am mistaken, in which case I shall
of course Change my opinion. I think that is
the attitude of all ot us who are at work
upon it. __________________

CHEAP JAPANESE GOODS
The Cotton Industry of the
United States in Great
Danger.
Manufacturers in Japan Will Soon
Flood the Market With Cheap
Labor Products.
The special joint committee from the
Manufacturers and Producers Associa
tion ana the Chamber of Commerce, mas
ing an investigation of the dangers arising
from the importation of products of cheap
Japanese labor, are not letting the grass
grow under their feet. Reports have 'been
made to both bodies, and the latter con
sidered the case of such importance that
the committeemen were instructed to
carry out the suggestions made in their
report. One was that a general meeting of
both organizations aud all others inter
ested be called with the view of presenting
a memorial to Congress to make an official
investigation and provide f6r such pro
tection as the case demands. No time has
been lost by the joint committee, which
has issued the following call to hundreds
of citizens of this loculity:
To the Manufacturers and Producers' Associa
tion of California and San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce: On Friday, February 7, 1896, at $
P. M., in the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce, 58 Merchants' Exchange, there will be
a joint meeting of the members of the Manu
facturers and "? roducers' Association of Cali
fornia and of the Chamber of Commerce, for
the purpose of considering the question of the
"Japanese invasion of. our manufacturing
field" and taking such action as may be
deemed wise and expedient.
Addresses will be made by prominent per
sons, who are fully conversant with the sub
ject. His hoped that every member of these
two bodies will be present and take purt in the
discussion of this most important question. By
order of the joint committee,
Hugh Ckaig, Chairman.
Julian Sonntag, Secretary.
At that meeting interesting addresses
will probably oe made by Julian Sonntag.
"William Rutherford, Hugh Craig, who
will preside, George H. Collins and others^
All of these gentlemen have been gather
ing data upon the subject of American
laborers competing with the seven-dollar
a-month coolies of Japan, and the Ameri
can manufacturers competing with those
of Japan. Much of the information they
have obtained has been published in The
Call.
Some new and important information
will be preoented that they have not had
the opportunity of securing before, bear
ing upon the manufacture of cotton goods
by the Japanese for the American markets
at prices that will, if not checked, close
every cotton-mill in the United States.
The information comes from no less an au
thority than Colonel John A. Cockerill,
special correspondent for the New York
Herald. Colonel Cockerill is now in
Tokio, Japan, antf, in a recent letter to his
paper, he sounds the alarm of a danger
that threatens the cotton industry of the
entire United States. Under the date of
January 3, he says:
A. 11. Butler, a California capitalist, who has
successfully ''promoted" a waich company iv
Osaka, and who has been trying for some time
to induce the Japanese Government to estab
lish a line of steamers between Osaka, Yoko
hama and Salina Cruz, on the west coast of
Mexico, has been compelled to give up his
project, temporarily at least. Mr. Butler, some
time ego, made acomtrination of cotton goods
manufacturers in Osaka, which is now known
as the Japan Cotton Trading Company. It was
in the interest of these manufacturers that he
proposed to establish the line of steamers re
ferred to, his theory being that cotton could be
taken from our Gulf States from Galveston to
Coatzacoalcos, the eastern terminus of the
Tehuantepec Railway, carried across the isth
mus and thence by steamer to Japan, at a
much less cost than by the way of Liverpool
and the Suez.
The Mexican Government was greatly inter
ested in the enterprise and was willing to
afford all facilities. The Tehuantepec Railway
is 130 miies in length and i 3 now open to
traffic. Mr. Butler being interested iv the
Tepustete iron mine, some forty miles south of
San Diego and directly on the* coast, hoped to
be able to introduce this high quality of iron
in Japan incidentally in connection with his
subsidized line of steamers. But the Japanese
have many projects on hand and they are
greatly taken up now with their proposed
direct line of freight and passenger steamers
between Yokohama, Kobe, Nagasaki and Lon
don. As for iron, they insist that they have
all they, went at home. As a matter of fact
they have not as yet developed any iron de
posits of a high character, though the country
may be full of it. â¢
Last summer Mr. Butler went to the United
States to investigate the cotton business. He
found that the railwayi of Texas would charge
him 65 cents per hundred for hauling cotton
from San Antonio or the interior to Galveston..
To ship from there to the Gulf terminus of the'
Tehuantepec Railway would add another
heavy charge, and at this point he was forced
to drop the matter. He, however, secured a
rate with the railways reaching San Francisco
from the cotton belt, whicn he thinks will
enable him to begin shipping American cotton
to Japan by the established lines. He has con
tracts with forty-two manufacturers in Japan
who will take only American cotton from him,
and he will begin with a monthly shipment of
something over 4000 bales. He expects soon
to run this up to 5000 a month, and he hopes
to double this shipment in th,e course of a year.
He will be able to place American cotton at
the door of the Japan manufacturer at some
thing like 20 cents a pound, and he predicts
that from this time forward not a bale of our
cotton will reach- Japan by way of Liverpool.
The Japanese will still continue to be con
sumers of large quantities of India cotton,
mixing Its short fiber with the American sta
ple, and henceforth turning dut a better qual
ity of goods. The manufacturers here expect
to place their sheetings and prints in the
American market, and they Will certainly do
so unless by the tariff. As to the
line of steamers between Japan and some port
of the American coast that will probably come
when the Japanese are able to build all of their
own ship* at home. While on this subject it
may be mentioned that the Mitsu Bishi ship
building concern of Nagasakiâ a Japanese or
ganizationâ lies just taken a contract to build
a 7500-ton merchant vessel lor the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha people. The Mitsu Bishi people
propose to duplicate the s-hips, five in number,
which the compa-riy has recently ordered in
England. They have never built a vessel of
such tonnage, but they are willing to lose
100,000 yen or so for the sake of the experience
and in the way or patriotism. The Japanese
spirit oi to-day is to build and create every
thing possible at home, and to not permit a
dollar to go abroad which can be kept in Japan.
While the joint committee bas had an
intimation that the Japanese proposed to
make an endeavor to control the cotton
industry of the future, the date upon the
subject were out of the reach of the inves
tigators, as they were only obtainaole in
Japan. Colonel Cockerill's letter will add
great strength to the argument to be pre
sented urging Congress to take immediate
steps in the matter. Many of the people
in the East have viewed the recent anti-
Japanese agitation of the West with much
suspicion, and several papers on the other
side of the continent have intimated that
the danger was more imaginary than real.
Those who are interested in the iocal
agitation believe that the Japanese under
taking to absorb the cotton industry will
alarm those in the Eastern, Middle and
Southern States who are row engaged in
the manufacture of cotton goods, and that
California's demand for protection will be
seconded by those in those sections.
Another matter of no small consideration
is the fact that there is an apparent desire
of avoiding American railways in the
shipping of the raw material to Japan.
Mexico is another country where labor
and fuel are cheap, and the cost of trans
portation of freight across Mexico would
necessarily be lessthan where the men get
higher wages. The completion of the
Nicaragua canal will further cheapen the
cost of shipping the raw cotton to Japan.
It can then pc loaded on vessels and sent
to Japan direct without the expense of
twice handling, as would be necessary in
sending by water, rail and then by water
again. Every reduction in the cost of the
raw material would permit a correspond
ing reduction in the price of the manufac
tured goods when returned to the Ameri
can market.
The subiect of cheap cotton goods will
form one of thÂ« chief matters for discussion
at the coming mass-meeting.

IN CHILDHOOD`S REALM
ANEW MONTH bows to us this
morning, his arms laden with
primroses and his fingers spark
ling with amethy3ts.
"We are glad to see you. Sir
February, and hope you will bring to us a j
little more of sunshine than did your
brother January.
We are glad to see you, Sir February,
because you do bring to us two of the
year's best daysâ -birthdaysâ St. Valen
tine's and that of our own dearly beloved
Washington.
Ah! there is another birthday, tooâ of
one whom we all loveâ which comes in
this second month of the yearâ Charles
Dickens, who was born in the land of the
primrose, and who wrote of children, "I
love these little people; and it is not
a slight thing, when they, who are so fresh
Jrom God, love us."
So February is a precious month, isn t
it? And we are all glad that it will last
one day more this year than it has for a i
long time.
Now for the primrose and the amethyst;
the sentiment of the flower is "early
youth," and of its mate in the mineral
â world, "peace."
By the dewy gleam, by the very breath,
Of the primrose tufts in the grass beneathâ
Vpon thy heart there i* laid a spell
Holy and preciousâ U guard it well.
â Twamley. ;
The February -born will find
Sincerity and peace of mind,
Freedom from passion and from care,
If they the amethyst will wear.
The primrose is one of the first flowers of j
the year, its name being taken from the
Italian and meaning "the first spring
flower."
The nome of the primrose is England !
and there it blooms sweetest and best. No ;
flower is so dear to the heart of the Eng- !
lishman as the primrose.
The day which has been dedicated to
Lord Beaconsfield, April 19, has come to
be known as "Primrose day." and his j
followers have clubs or societies, which
they call "Primrose leagues," having for
their emblem a cluster of primroses, be
cause it was the favorite flower oi this
statesman, just as the great Napoleon best
loved the modest violet, and just as the
lowly cornflower was so precious to Kaiser
William.
So on April 19 millions and millions of
this "field duckling" are used for decora
tive purposes, houses, market stalls, j
tiorses, carriages and children being decked i
â with as many blossoms as possible, and j
yet if you should ride out into the country
not one flower could be missed from sunny
fields or fragrant hedgerows, such prolific
bloomers are they during the spring
months.
In some parts of England much super
stition hovers around the primrose, it
being considered an omen of ill luck for a j.
person to enter a farmhouse with less than |
a generous handful of the blossoms, as a
fewer number is supposed to have a very
serious effect on the number and well
being of the tiny members of the poultry
flock.
The amethyst is a lovely stone, worthy
of our devoting a little time to its study,
which will be of; most interest to the ones
whose birthday stone it is.
We find that it is really a variety of
quartz or rock crystal of a fine violet-blue
or purple color. But you say you have
seen amethysts of other shades than these. I
Yes, I know, but they are not so colored i
by nature, but are produced by submitting
the blue amethyst to the action of fire, i
Wherever manganese is found there the j
young student of geology may be quite i
eu-e of having his efforts rewarded if he be I
looking for amethyst quartz, nature hay- j
ing used oxide of manganese to produce j
the fine color of the stone.
The gem is found in all parts of the
world, but tbe very fiaest ones come from i
Carthagena, Spain.
In our own country Maine possesses, !
probably, the greatest store of amethysts, i
But, boys and girls, when vacation comes j
"OVER WENT THE BARREL."
[From a drawing by a "Call" artist.]
and you go for long trarcps and rides over
hills and through vales keep your eyes
open for manganese, then look for Febru
ary's precious stone. If you are successful
please write to the "Children's Page" of
The Sunday Call and tell us all about it.
A 3lischievoug Bear.
Not long ago I read in an Eastern paper
a very amusing story about a little boy and
his pet bear.
The story told how Harry's papa had
been away up north on business, bringing
to his little son on his return a comical
looking ball of soft fur from which peeked
two bright eyes and a little pointed nose.
Harry was perfectly delighted with his
odd pet, and as the bear grew older, many ;
a rough-and-tumble frolic did they have to
gether. The bear grew very rapidly, so by
the time he was seven months old he was
quite large and heavy.
He spent his time in the back yard, of
which he had the freedom, sleeping and
resting in a large box iv one of the far cor
ners.
One warm day, while Harry was at
school. Master Bear, growing tired of his
monotonous existence, thought he WQUId
take a walk and try to find something good
to eat. So off he started, heading for the
kitchen steps, which he clumsily mounted,
only to be confronted by the fastened
screen-door. But this did not long prove a
drawback, for the naughty fellow Taised
his front paws and soon tore a hole large
enough to admit his whole body.
On entering the kitchen he sniffed the
air for a moment and then made straight
for the pantry door, which was slightly
ajar.
There was a large jug of molasses setting
on. the floor of the- pantry, and Master
Bruin was immediately seized by a strong
desire to examine it; so sitting down on
his haunches and drawing it toward .him,
first smelt and then licked the cork of the
jug. My, how good it did smell and taste,
and how he wished for more! After
vainly endeavoring to find the contents of
"HE ATE AND ATE AS NEVER BEAR DID BEFORE."
[From a drawing by a "Call" artist.]
the jug he became impatient, and uttering
a disgusted "ugh" dashed the jug with
such force against the wall that the cork
popped -out, and much to his surprise the
longed-for liquid poured in a stream all
over the floor. Then didn't he have a
feast ! He ate and ate as never bear did
before, filling eyes and nose and ears as
well as mouth with the sweet, sticky stuff.
There Harry's mother found him when
she came to prepare dinner sitting in a
pool of molasses, a picture of perfect bear
ish content.
When the little boy came home from
school a few moments afterward she called
to him to come ana escort his "sweet" pet
back to his own Quarters.
This proved to be no easy task, for, after
vainly endeavoring to coax the beast away
from his treasure, when Harry took hold
of him to try to pull him out' he became
very angry, and growled and clawed so
fiercely that the little boy was forced to
beat a hasty retreat into the kitchen.
The beur rushed around the pantry in a
rage and finally, in his indignation,
jumped on top of the flour barrel, the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896.
cover of which being loose, of course baby
bear fell in an ignominious heap to the
bottom, where he lay struggling and kick
ing, while his master shouted with laugh
ter. At last the poor beast gave such a
desperate kick that over went the barrel
and he made good his escape.
Harry had to sit down on the floor and
hold his sides, they ached so from excess
siye laughing as he saw his disgusted pet
rush through the kitchen and out through
the hole in the kitchen door like a streak
of lightning, leaving a trail of white flour
behind him all the way across the yard,
never stopping until he was safe in the
Shelter of nis own box.
It proved a source of great amusement
to the little boy for the next few days to
stand and watch the bear pick the sticky
dough off his furry coat and put it in his
mouth, wearing all the time a look of such
injured innocence.
I can assure you that Harry's pet could
never again be induced to mount the
kitchen steps.which I am sure was perfectly
satisfactory to Harry's mother, while the
sight of a jug would send him at once in a
perfect fit of terror straight to his box,
where he would remain for the rest of the
day. .
Diamonds and Coal.
A Jittle boy whom I know very well,
having heard some one remaric that coal
and diamonds were of the same composi
tion, went into the cellar one day pro
vided with a large hammer and very soon
commenced to whack away with it at a
great chunk of coal which was lying on
the floor.
His mother, on hearing the racket,
called to nim to find out what he was
doing. "Smashing the coal to find dia
monds for you, mamma dear," was the
reply.
The Letter Box.
Ever so many letters this week, from
bright boys and girls, answering the ques
tions which were published in last Sun
day's Call.
They didn't answer these because they
ran a chance for winning a paper doll or a
tin whistle, either, but just because they
are bright young Americans who are
eager for knowledge.
One letter there is from a little girl who
did not answer the questions. We are
very glad indeed to get letters like hers,
and hope many more will come.
I am not going to ask any questions '
to-day, but you all know that St. Valen
tine's day will soon be here, so I Bhould
like you to find out as much as you can
about the saint and his birthday, and how
and why we celebrate it.
No matter if you can just find out one
interesting item with reference to the day,
please write it in a letter, and then we
shall all know it too.
Following are some of the letters, iust
as they were written :

THE DONALD~SEEIESâ NO. XIV.
FOR TINY BOYS.
To-day I'm going to tell the tiny boys
three little stories, or about three "little
times" in Donald's life, that will let you
wee chaps know how very much he has
always loved all kinds of animals.
When he was just old enough to stretch
forth his chubby fists for what he wanted,
he would scream and kick with delight at
the sight of a horse, or dog, or cat. And,
I am sorry to say, when he was about
one year old he loved his two little kittens
so hard and squeezed them so tight that I
am sure they did not live to be very old
cats.
One day as Donald and his mamma were
out walking they saw coming toward them
a very cross dog that was really the terror
of the neighborhood. (Maybe boys', strings,
tin-cans and stones had something to ao
with his temper).
Mamma walked into the street, calling
to the little boy to follow her, so as to give
the doe the freedom of the sidewalks; but j
Donald failed to obey. When mamma
looked around to understand why he had
not come she saw him gently stroking the
animal's shaggy head.
"Why, Donald, how do you dare to
touch that creature?"
"Oh, mamma, don't be afraid," he an
swered. "Don't you know, I looked
straight into his eyes, and then he knew I
was his master and let me pat him right
away."
Once upon a time, when Donald was
about 4, in the sweet Maytime of the year,
the family left town to spend a few weeks
in a delightful mountain glen. One day,
when they were returning from a long
walk, a snake suddenly glided across the
patn in front of them.
"Look out. Donald, there's a snake,"
cried his brother. "Oh, where, brother?"
shouted the child. "Let's catch him by
the tail quick and take him home to be
our pet snake." Without one particle of
fear off the boy darted to catch the snake,
but Mr. Snake proved too swift for him
and was soon far out of Donald's reach, so
the little boy was forced to give up his
wished-for pet.
I shall never forget the first day Donald
spent in San Francisco.
His mamma and he had occasion to
cross Montgomery street about the middle
of the block.
Before they had reached the opposite
sidewalk Donald suddenly stopped and,
pointing to the cobblestones, exclaimed,
"Look, mamma, look!"
"At what, dear?"
Her First Mouse.
[Reproduced from Wideawake.]
"Do they have to walk on those?"
''Whom do you mean, my child?"
"Why the poor horses, mamma." .
"Yes, Donald ; they do."
"Well, but don't it hurt their feet to
walkover these hard stones?" questioned
the child.
All the rest of the afternoon Donald
wore a puzzled expression, as if trying to
reason out now men can treat the horses
who work for them so faithfully in such a
heartless way.
Silk Spun by Spiders.
One day I was watching a fine large
spider completing his web, says C. Kay in
the Pittsburg Dispatch. The stayropes
were already stretched across the open
[Margartttt Lippincott in Wide Awaked
window, and beginnine where they crossed
he was hobbling round and round fasten
ing the crosslines of fresh shiny silk.
Suddenly it occurred to me that I might
reel out that silk for mv own use â or
amusement. Keally, 1 fancied myself on
the verge of a great discovery. Why
might not a most beautiful fabric be made
of that glistening material? Who could
tell what might come of it?
8b I managed to get hold of the end of
the strand, and began to draw it out.
Now if there is anything that a spider par
ticularly detests it is to be robbed of his
silk; no pack-peddler values his stock half
so highly. As soon, therefore, as my vic
tim perceived what I was at he reached
hack with a claw and snipped the thread.
This was repeated several times.
Then I Baw that 1 must devise some
means for preventing this sort of inter
ference. So I cut a small round hole in
a bit of cardboard and made a slÂ»tfrom
the hole to ttie edge â see cut. Tbis ar
rangement I slipped about mv spider's
wasp-like waist. As his legs were on one
side of the card and his abdomen with the
spinners on the other he could nolonger
meddle with the thread ; neither could h a
get out of the sort of pillory in which I
had placed him. He wasn't hurt in the
least, but he was altogether helpless and
in the worst,of humors. Then I got hold
Reeling Silk From the Reluctant Spider.
of the strand with a oair of tweezers and
proceeded to draw out as much silk as I
pleased, winding.it about my finger.
But this process wa3 slow, and did not
satisfy me. I wanted spider's silk in bulk ;
my head was full of schemes for producing
a new aird beautiful fabric from this bright
and elastic material. I therefore mounted
si spool upon a spinale in such a way that
I could make it rotate with great speed by
means of a band running from a wheel â
Ddcl Between Spider and Large Ant.
about eight inches in diameterâ which I
turned with a crank. To this spool T at
tached the end of the thread, and set my

The spindle sang like a humming-lop as it
spun on its bearings, reeling his precious
silk from that disgusted scider until the
glistening thread cdvered the spool as with
a sheet of varnisii. An angrier insect, I
fancy, never lived; but what could he do
about it? And. afterward I fed him well
by way of compensation.
Thus far my plans had worked to perfec
tion; but when I endeavored to utilize the
material co unscrupulously obtained, like
many another thief, I became involved in
difficulties. I found that the adhesive
strands, so perfectly adapted to the own
er's own business of fly-catching, were not
so well suited to manufacturing purposes
as I had fondly hoped. In fact, they had
glued themselves together bo firmly that I
was never able to unwind them from the
spool, and my invention, though highly
interesting, did not prove remunerativeâ
a lucky thing for the spiders.

I know that the sky is blue on
II account of the thousands and
j XL thousands of millions of atoms of
dust floating in the atmosphere.
"Were it not for dust we would lack light
on Mother Earth and the heavens â¢would
be an inky black.
Suppose a room absolutely dark, save a
hole through one of the shutters. A ray
of light will dart through the small open
ing and one can observe tiny particles of
dust dancing in that bright sunbeam of
light. As a matter of fact it is not "the
light" we see, tut simply a reflection,
caused by these motes of dust. "
As it is with the shaft of light in the
darkened room, so it is on a large scale
throughout the air. The many millions
of particles of dust catch the light, reflect
ing it back and forth from one to another,
bo making the atmphere luminous.
It is for this reason that, were it not for
the dust, the sky would appear black, as it
does at night when there. is no moon.
The sun would appear as an immense
glowing ball. The moon and stars would
be visible throughout the day. Everything
would appear different. Where the light
touched the eves would be dazzled by the
brilliancy. The mellow softness of the
shadows would become an intense black
and the outline of object!, harsh and
angular.
The sunlight, which has been analyzed i
by means of the spectroscope, consists of
all the colors of the rainbow, their total
forming the white light. This white lieht
going through a crystal prism is broken
up into its seven component, the so-called
fundamental, colors. These seven distinct
colors of light are the result of the differ
ent lengths of ether waves, blue heading
the list as one of the shortest, yellow being
on* of the longest waves. Thus the
finest dust molecules being up high
est in the atmosphere reflect only
the blue light, imparting that tint
to the heavens â¢ above. In mining dis
tricts and those where factory engines
abound, where the air is full of large par
ticles of coal and other dust, even on an
otherwise clear day the sun will have a
reddish tint. The cause of it is that the
particles of dnst are too large and too low
in the atmosphere to reflect the blue light,
only the red being reflected. For this rea
son the sky in the country will be blue
while above a large city on the same day
the heavens may present a grayish or
whitish color, on account of the dust
atoms being rather large, and, therefore,
not reflecting the blue light. â  . ;â¢ '
The reason that in southern parts of the
globe and near the equator the sky is very
blue lies in the fact that the sky is much
drier and the dust molecules, not being en
larged by moisture, are thus enabled to re
flect the blue color of the sunbeams. â New

Novelties In Cycles.
. . In their presence at the National cycle
show In vast numbers the people of New

ress. There were nil kinds of bicycles
and bicycle appliances. The catalogue
showed nearly 400 exhibits of various

the great Madison-square Garden was cov
ered. Among the exhibits which attracted
most attention were the bicycles equinped
for army use. The new army tandem,
mounted with a 40- pound automatic rapid
firing machine gun, was on exhibition for
the hrst time. These machines have been
equipped in the most thoroughly com
plete and convenient manner, and yet
without carrying an extra ounce or inter
fering in any possible with the rider or
v riders.
The tandem is finished in the regulation
manner, with enameled frame, nickel-
Tilated handle bars, hubs and sprockets,
althongh it presents quite a different and
perhaps even more attractive appearance,
on account of the acconterments of war
which are attached to it, and stem to add
a more stanch and perfect appearance to
the machine. On either side of the steer
ing head, and clamped or attached with
perfect security, are steel enameled gun
rests, which are lined with leather and
made exactly to fit the barrel of the guns,
and attached to the main upri-ht in the
same way are rests of the same kind, with
the exception of being made a trifle larger,
in order to hold the gnn grip. Fitting
most securely in these rests, and yet in
such a manner that they may be easily
and quickly detached at a moment's
notice, are two 12-shot repeating magazine
carbines.

are two regulation six-shooters, encased
in holsters. Also on the right side, ex
tending almost the whole length of the
machine, attached in front to the steering
head and in the rear to the lower center
tube, is a jointed flagstaff in a tight-fitting
neat-lcxoking canvas case, and in no way
hindering the action of the machine or
riders. On the front handle-bar and
strapped in a peculiar manner, so that
there is no possibility of their coming
loose or causing any annoyance, are two
tightly rohed blue "regulation army over
coats. On the rear bars, strapped in the
same fashion, are a double pair of gray
army blankets. The guns, revolvers and
all are so ingeniously attached that uoth
ing can interfere in the slightest degree
with the riders, and the additional weight
of the various accouterments, which take
in everything essential for a march in
times of war and peace, is hardly percep
tible.

THE IiOCOMOTIVK WHISTLE.
How It Developed I'roin a Little Tin
Horn.
When locomotives were first built and
: began to trundle their small loads up and
down the newly and rudely constructed
railways of England, the public roads
! were for the greatest part crossed at grade,
and the engine driver had no way of giv
ing warning of iiis. approach except by
blowing a tin horn. But this, as may be
imagined, says a writer in Cassier's Maga
zine, was far from being a sufficient warn
ing. One day, in the year 1533, so runs a
story of the origin of the locomotive
whistle, a farmer of Thornton was cross
ing tho railway track on one of the
country roads with a great load of eggs
and butter. Just as he came out upon
the track a train approached. The engine
man blew his tin horn lustily, but the i
farmer did not hear it. Eighty dozen
of eggs and fifty rounds of butter were
smashed into an indistinguishable, un
pleasant mass, and mingled with the i
kindling wood to which the wagon was
reduced. The railway company had to
pay the farmer the value of his fifty
pounds of butter, his 960 eggs, his horse
and his wagon. It was regarded as a very
serious matter, and straightway a direc
tor of the company went to Alton Grange,
where George Steplienson lived, to see if
he could not invent something that would
give a warning more likely to be heard.
Stephenson went to work Hnd the next
day had a contrivance which, when at
tached to the engine boiler and the steam
turned on, gave out a shrill, discordant
sound. The railway directors, greatly de
lighted, ordered similar contrivances to be
attached to all the locomotives, and from
that day to this the voice of the locomo
tive whistle has never been silent.
VALUABLE FIDDLES.
raganini'i Instruments la the City of
Genoa.
The beauty and sweetness of Sarasate's
tone are often commented on by people
who never think of the tone being in any
way due to the fineness of his instrument.
As a matter of fact. Sarasate ha 3 two
Strads. One is the renowned "Boissier"
Strad., which he managed to secure in
Paris for Â£1000 an hour or two before Hill
of London sent an offer for it; the other is
one that has been used by Paganini, which
came to him through his son Achille. Of
course ttfe latter instrument has an addi
tional value from the circumstance of its
former ownership. Paganini had several
valuable violins, "and the instrument which
he used in his later yearsâ a Guarnerius.
dated 1743 â would prooably command
something like Â£5000 if it could be put in
the market just now; indeed, the sum of
Â£2400 has already been offered for it and
refused, and a report was lately circulated
that Â£10.000 had been tried. But the in
strument cannot be sold. Paganini him
self bequeathed it to the city of Genoa,
and the municipal authorities there are
keenly alive to the value of the treasure.
They have it bestowed inagiasscase in
the recess of a wall, which is again incased
in heavy French plate glass, the whole
being closed by a massive door. Every
two months the seals are broken and the
violin played upon for ahout half an hour
in the presence of city officials, and then
it is replaced and put under municipal
seal. This, of course, is done to keep the
instrument in good condition.
Paganini came by the viohn in a curious
way. A French merchant lent him the
instrument to play upon at a concert at
Leghorn. After the concert t'aganiui
brought it back to its owner, when the
latter exclaimed, to the delighted astonish
ment of the player: "Never more will I
profane the strings which your fingers
have touched; that instrument is yours."
The Genoa people have been in luck in the
matter of violins. Sivori, who died last
year, was a pupil of Paganini, and Paga
nini presented him when a youth with a
very fine Guarnerius instrument. It was
therefore but natural that Sivorl should
wish his violin to rest beside Paganinis,
j and so to-day for a small fee you can see
both instruments in the municipal niche
at Genoa.â Comhill Magazine.

The line is divided into equal parts of fifty I

same ratio to an hour that a knot has to a j
nautical mile, the ship runs at the rate of

It is not outside the realm of possibility
that in the century soon to dawn the
horseless carriage may be as familiar on
the public highway as the bicycle is to
day; as familiar, in fact, as the family con

roads are a prime requisite for the success
of the motocycle, but good roads are
bound to come, and it is to be hoped that
the agitation for them that has been set
on foot all over this country will not be

Poison for Arrows.
The following account Of the method
used by Bushmen of Namaqualand to
poison their arrows is given in the Scien
tific African: "Some resin, either from
the gift-bol or from one of the members
of the Euphorbia group of cactus-like
plants, is first obtained, and the sticky
substance is placed on a stone. The Bush
man then poes with a forked stick to look
for ring-halse or black night artder, not
the puff-adder which is called ring-halse.
Having found the snake, by a dextrous
thrust of the stick the animal is imprisoned
just behind the head by the two prongs of
the stick. The prepared stono is then
placed in the mouth, and the upper jaw
forced rieht back. By this somevrhat
rough treatment the poison glands become
compressed, and two drops of poison are
forced out on the fan^s and caught on the
stone. The poison is theri well mixed
with resinous matter, and is ready for use.
In the earlier days a more complicated
preceiure was adopted, through the
medium of a witch doctor. The whole
head of the puff-adder was obtained and
put in a pot along with the resin, and
beetles and noxious herbs added to the
incantation of the witch doctor. The
whole was stewed up amid great excite
ment. When the contents of the vessel
were properly mixed, the sticky compound
was collected by stirring it with a stick, to
which the matter adhered, and, on becom
ing cold, remained on the stick as a black
knob, and formed then aa article of
barter."
A Fine Cruiser.
The Argentine warship Buenos Aires,
the fastest ocean-going vessel in the world,
as demonstrated by her recent trial trip,
is also said to be one of the best armed
cruisers afloat. Her principal armament
consists of two 8-inch quick-firing guns,
four 6-inch quick-firing guns and six 4.7
--inch quick-tiring guns. There are also
ten 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and six
1-pounder Mnxim-Nordenfeldt automatic
guns. All the large guns are 47 calibers
in length. Cordite was used throughout
during the gunnery trials, which were
considered remarkably snecessful by ex
perts.
FIRST DAYS OF THE WORLD.
The Time When Moll ask I^fe Reigned
Supremo.
When geology took up the world's his
tory, in early Archaian days, 300,000,000
of years had already passed since the
molten rocks of the sun-like earth had
formed from the condensing nebulae.
The cooling of the exterior nad gone for
ward with remarkable slowness, but at
last it was hard, solid rock; the thick,
j heavy vapors had begun to condense and
| waters, hot and acid, covered the world, or
| at least its greater part.
' Over the continental region the sea was
more or less shallow and the breaking and
grind ing of the ocean's bed laid the nucleus
for. future land. .
A triangular island slowly appeared
above the waste of waters in what is now
the Hudson Bay region; there appeared,
too, a narrow strip, which, in centuries to
come, was to 'be the Highlands: of the j
Hudson; there was also a coast line in the
broad area covering the Rockies; small-isl
i ands dottci the great northern seas where
Noway and Sweden now stand. 'â  ..
As time passed the waters slowly be
came cooler and at last life, lowly life. ap
peared in some structureless pfants and
animals. â  . ' â  '- ".'â 
: A warm and equable climate covered this
land, and a clouded sky tempered the rays
of the sun; but t ha rocks were yet bare,
and no sounds filled the air save tho e of a
lifeless and voiceless natureâ surging
qi the waters and the raging of the ter
nâ  pest:..: But ii gnu'ual change was* taking
place; the seas adjoining these primordial
islands became shallower; corals and sea

which will, it- is said, : reduce to a mini-;
mum the danger of collisions of cable-cars
on the bridge. :It is probable that within la
short time telephone connections will be
made ; between ; all the 2 trains running on
the. bridge and the train dispatcher,' in
charge. This vrM give the dispatcher
almost instantaneous command over all
trains. : . ; ' â 
Assistant Engineer Kingsley L. Martin
.has conducted experiments which . have
shown that, the plan is feasible. The ex
periments heretofore have been with the
electric light j trolley wire strung over the
bridge, with a ground circuit in the truck
of the car. In the future this will be
abandoned, and a metallic circuit,. which
gives ; much more ; ; favorable ' results * than
the ground circuit, will be substituted.
â¢ Under j the ; proposed J system the train
dispatcher will sit In his office and wear a
head telephone," and 5 ; will have a long-dis
tance . transmitter i and. signal bells before
him, as well as the apparatus he now uses.
At both ends of every train there, will be
a head telephone and a transmitter," so ar

. Shoots 600 Times a Minute. v
The "Maxim" gun, which has \ figured
prominently in recent reports from Vene- i
zuela and the Transvaal, can shoot eleven
bullets a second or 666 a minute. ; ; It is ! a
light affair and ' looks like ' a { small, slim
barreled cannon mounted on a tripod.
The gunner sits upon a saddle behind the
gun, and can swing %itv to right or left or
elevate or depress the barrel as easily as
though it were a revolver. The gun loads
itself. The cartridges are strung on belts
which hold from Â£ 150 %to 400 1 rounds each,
and this belt is fed automatically to the
breech |of 3 the : gun. ; The " loading, firing
, and ejecting mechanisms are worked by
the recoil of the gun. The first cartridge
is fired by pressing a button, and after
that, G66 times a minute, every kick of the
gun throws out the exploded shell, inserts
a loaded one and explodes it. This is
kept up as long as the button is pressed or
until the belt of cartridges is exhausted.
The steel barrel is encased in a water
jacuet which keeps the gun cool.
Eyes of Animali.
The owl's eyes have no muscles hy
which they can' be moved. This deficiency
is atoned for by extraordinary flexibility
in the muscles of the neck, by which the
owl can move his head with incredible rap
idity in any direction.
A deer's eyes command a wide field of
vision, and the animal can see behind as
well as before, though not so distinctly,
for when alarmed by a noise from the rear
the deer will always turn, so as to gain a
clearer view of the object.
A mole's eyes are believed to give the
animal rlothing more than an impression
of light, which is probably painful or at
least annoying, the sensation prompting
the creature at once to burrow into the
earth and escape the annoyance.
The eye of the cat, like that of the horie,
is provided with a false eyelid, which may
be moved indepenaently of the outer or
true lid. It is often employed by a cat
when obliged to face a very bright light,
and is believed to act as a shade.
Oysters are provided with eyes, but the
oyster's eye is not located where public
opinion places it. What is called the eye
of the oyster is the great muscle which
holds the shells together, and which is
separated by the knive of the opener.
When the snake sheds his skin the Bkin
of the eye comes off with the rest. Trans
lucent in most parts, the sÂ»kin O7er the
snake's eye is perfectly transparent.
Blue-eyed cats are always deaf. The
physiologists have in vain attempted to
explain this curious circumstance.
The ostrich is believed to see objects
behind him as well as those in front. Per
sons standing directly behind an ostrich
can see the pupils of his eyes, and, of
course, are tbns easily seen by the animal.
The common house fly is said to be pro
vided with 10,000 eyes; that is to say, his
two compound eyes have each 8000 facets.
By this singular arrangement he is enabled
to see in every direction aÂ«d to elude with
great skill and success the many dangers
that threaten his daily existence. â St.

Washington's Dignity.
Great as he was in every other direction
profoundly as he appreciated and much as
he enjoyed the dinner, General Washing
ton by his presence generally spoiled the
pleasures of the feast, said Chauncey De
pew In a recent speech. The severity of
his manner, his reticence % and the distant
majesty which enshrined him destroyed
the freedom which is necessary to the full
appreciation and enjoyment of. the occa
sion. The grandfather of General Coch
ran was surgeon-genera! of the staff, and
be used to tell the story cf the effort made
by tiie younger members to break through
this reserve and brinjr the commandor-in
chief into conn-ection and sympathy with
both the serious artri the hilarious inci
dents which happended after he retired.
The novel method of producing this result
was that the Lest raconteur should tell the
story which had proved the greatest suc
cess, and then that Governor Morris, the
most brilliant, audacious and b(;st loved of
the officers, should slap the general on the
back ar.d say: "Old gentleman, how do
you like that?" Washington was first as
tonished, and then a grieved expression
came over his face; then lie slowly rose
and with great dignity retired from the
room. This was the first and last ex
periment they made upon General Wash
ington.

Some Royal Crowns. .
The crowns of Spain, Portugal and
Poland are all three of the same form and
are described by Colonel Parsons in his
"Genealogical Tables of Europe" as "ducal
coronets heightened up with eight arched
diadems supporting a mound, ensigned
with a plain gold croEs."
The crowns of Denmark and Sweden are
of almost similar shape, consisting of the
eight arched diamondn arising from a
rcarquis' coronet (a circle of gold bordered
with ermine, set around with four straw
berry leaves and four pearls on pyramidi
cal points of equal height, alternate),
which conjoin at the top under a mound
ensigned with a cross bottone.
The Kings of most other Continental
countries are crowned with circlets of gold,
adorned with precious stones and height
ened up with trefoils and closed by four,
six or eight diamonds supporting a mound
surmounted by a cross. The trefoil upon
the crown is thought to be of Gothic
introduction.
We find it upon the coins of Clovis and
his sons, which has induced antiquarians
to call it the fleur de lisâ the lily of France
â represented in gold on a blue ground,
but the fact is these trefoils were used on
Constantinopolitan crowns before the time
of the FranKs and afterward on those of
German princes in no way allied to Char
lemagne, Aubrey, a celebrated authority
upon heraldry, was of opinion that the
fleur de lis is really nothing more than a
spear head adorned, no flower of the lily
kind having the middle part solid.
The Sultan of Turkey wears over his
arms a tuiban, enriched with pearls and
diamond?, under tsvo coronets, the iirat of
which is ? made of pyramidical ,; points,
heightened up with large *; pearls, and the
uppermost is .- surmounted with crescents.
; SURVEYING A FARAIXEI-.
The Longest Line Ever 'Surveyed la the
' > Â» World.
No exaggeration can be attributed to the
scientific press in declaring the survey of
the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude,
just completed, to be ? the greatest contri
bution to science ever given 'â ' by a Govern
ment. : The prime I object was accurately
and 'j precisely to determine the figure of
the earth, for, though . north ' and south
lines had largely contributed to this final
result, yet for absolute exactness in astro
nomical calculations an east and west line
of the furthest possible extent had to be
run. The -; thirty - ninth parallel from
Point Arenas ;' to Cape May; ;N. J.i
was chosen kas Â« the * stretch :of â  ter
ritory best adapted for the work, and the
United States is now credited with : having
finished the, longest line ever surveyed in
this world. . Uncompahgre, where this
thirty-ninth parallel of latitude crosses the
continent, is a noted mountain among
the National surveys and Government
expeditions, has ; repeatedly been the
station for those intrusted with exploring
and geological pursuits. Haydeji's party,
who occupied it during the field of investi
gation from ; 1873 'to â  1876, placed its ; alti
tude at 14,235,' while other estimates put it
some 300, feet in excess of that. Uncom
pahgre is in high favor with the geode
sians \ because of its easy access " and the
roomy summit, the latter being nearly
five acres in extent, with a gentle incline.â

. A . young girl who was in the house with
Mr. Whittier and of whom ,he was very
fond went to him one day with tearful
eyes and rueful face and said: "Mv dear
little kitty Bathsheba is dead, and I want
you to write a poem to put on her grave
stone. I shall bury her under a rose bush."

said in solemn tones: â¢

THE LATEST FASHION
GOSSIP
FOR
WOMEN
AND
MEN
EVERYBODY is talking about the
dinner dance and the domino
party. Both passed off with
great eclat The very youthful
set predominated at the Presidio
and had the most delightful time possi
ble. It was a leap-year affair and the girls
enjoyed enforcing their authority, in fact
thfir sway is being immensely appre
ciated by the beaux. One informed me
that three charming maidens were going
to see that he had a eood time, for one of
them had invited him to dance the co
tillon, another had engaged him for sud
per and the third, really I forgot what the
third had undertaken to do, at all events
this young man deserves lots of attention.
He has such charming manners and is so
unaffected that his head is not in the least
likely to be turned during '96, and I trust
the men who have been in the habit of ac
cepting every possible invitation and have

been scarcely civil to their hostesses may
be left severely alone and taught a lew
wholesome lessons.
At both of the large teas on Saturday
Fan Francisco's four hundred are fully
represented.
Much is expected of the Mardi Gras ball,
the management being in most excellent
hands, and with such spacious and beauti
ful apartments it should be a perfect suc
cess and close the season in a blaze of
glory.
I must now tell you about my illustra
tions, as you see evening toilets are upper
most in my mind, and small wonder, when
I have seen such a number lately, and
from now until Ash Wednesday all the
pretty girls will be dancing their feet off,
and will declare after each dance that they
never had a better time in all their lives.
One of the gowns is novel, the back, which
you cannot see, being entirely of white
tulle over white duchess satin, the front
being of the satin decorated with trails of
chrysanthemums, which reach the knee,
and trim the bodice as well. Bands of
silver sequin embroidery are used with
especially good effect.
The white satin frock is exceedingly
simple; but artistic^o a degree, the bodice
being draped with pale green chiffon,
caught on the bust with diamond orna
ments and falling with pearl-fringed ends
to the hem. The bodice of the third ball
costume is a soft mass of white chiffon
scattered with rose leaves, upon which
dewdrops of diamonds appear to have
fallen. Round the decolletage are double
frills of diamond-studded, ace ordion
pleated chiffon, and the full skirt shows
three inches of the accordion-pleated chif
fon studded with diamonds and headed
the rose leaves and dewdrops. This
last gown is worn by Miss Studholme in
"An Artist's Model," which is running in
New York, and is the creation, of a well
known English house. In the same play
is noted a pink satin skirt decora :ed with
gold and silver sequins, with lace on the
Kips; and a plain skirt of pale green has a
bodice draped like a handkerchief, elabor
ately jeweled ; a green and white- brocaded
skirt shows a bodice of emerald green vel
vet with an applique of heavy lace, the
top portion of the sleeves of this being
clost-ntting, with three frills a la Marie
Antoinette, while the belt is white.
A dainty gown of white satin is lined
with pale pink, having shoulder straps of
roses, the short sleeves displayine the top
portion of the arm bordered with sable;
the bodice of this overhanging the belt,
which is of pale pink. In the second act
the weary travelers arrive from Paris just
in time for the fancy dress ball, and ap
pear in the most interesting of ulsters,
"all bearing the Directoire indelibly im
pressed upon their outlines," yet all differ
in detail. One of drab cloth has facings of
black and white striped velvet, another of
gray with yellow facings, and perhaps the
best of all is cut like a redingote ana is of
green cloth faced with black. The hats for
these are said to oe picturesquely appro
priate, all being of the three cornered, or
punchinello shape. All the actresses also
wear huge ruffles of black lace with equally
large bows.
Another play which has greatly taken
the fancy of New Yorkers is much like
"Charlie's Aunt" in character. It is cailed
"The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown."
The character of Miss Eupheinia Schwartz,
German, girl in an English boarding
school, is taken by Miss Nita Allen. Her
acting is excellent and so are her frocks;
one has a yellow satin skirt with trim
mings of black lace, the bodice being gay
with many colored spangles; another of
white has" frills edged with black, the
colors being of yellow enriched with gold

embroidery, odd combinations being the
order of the day. Of coursÂ«, many stage
eowns are appropriate only before the
footlights or for a fancy ball, hut nowadays
only the cleverest of designers are em
ployed in creating such gowns, which nat
urally abound in good suggestions for the
woman who desires to be thoroughly up to
date, and that is the reason I so carefully
keep my readers posted concerning the
latest creations of the stage.
At tne Fortnightly cotillon the girls
were as delightfully pretty as ever, es
pecially those in gauzy, fluffy frocks, for
organdies, muslins, chiffons and mulls
made even the least beautiful dainty and
pretty. Tlifc older members of the club
wore handsome silks and laces. A wise
niaiden never makes the mistaKe of wear
ing a sown of a very decided hue which
may clash with other colors, as the result
is bad. However, I know of a case where
a very handsome little brunette desired to
mate herself conspicuous and well known
from the first. She made her debut, very
correctly, in the whitest of white gowns,
and at once realized that dozens of girls
wore white, pale blue, light, pink and
Nile green, so she would nave noth
ing to do with such delicate shades,
and forthwith appeared at her next
dance In a most fetching toilette of
crimson and black chiffon, red roses nest
ling in her hair; -her next venture was. a
vivid orange frock with a touch of green.
Both of these costumes were perfectly suc
cessful, the Detite brunette was declared a
belle at once, but then she had rarely per
fect taste and all the attributes of a belle,
but oh, how the other girls would have
liked to have extinguished her, for such
vivid garments made their dear little
frocks look so faded and washed out when
she appeared, and of course this young
girl was very incorrectly garbed, as she
dressed as a woman five years her senior
might have done, as far as colors were
concerned, although to be sure the fabrics
and styles were suited to her age.
A gown I greatly like is the property of
a tall, slender blonde. It is made of the
palest pink satin, the hem being trimmed
with two rows of white spangled ribbon,
roses adorning the froÂ«t of the decolle
tage.
Black and white has been so popular for
the past two years that most expected this
spring would' see the last of it. However,
those best informed write from Paris that
white and black will be again worn this
spring and summer. To be sure, there is
a considerable difference between black
with a touch of white and white with a
dash of black. Nita Allen showed the
effectiveness of this combination wnen sue.
had three dozen white ruffles which com
posed her skirt edged with black. White
India silks sprigged with black wili be
soon en route from the East. However,
torquoise blue will probably be the color
of the spring-summer.
The craze for Delft china has been and
is so tTeat that designers of fabric combi
nations evidently nave come to the con
clusion that the same shade of blue as we
see in the china on a white ground will be
equally popular in silk, so many of the
latest taffetas (summery-looking weaves)
show Delft-blue figuresâ usually flowers;
warp printed in white.
Last summer we had a new line, and an
other one has just been imported which ie
far more beautiful. It is like cloth of sil
ver, its surface being described as soft and
j glossy, of a perfect silver gray. Many of
the grass cloths and other linens h"ave
small dots brocaded over them which look
like embroidery.
Organdies and grenadines will be much
worn. The grenadines are arriving in
great numbers, some being .as thin as
mousseline de soie, while others have large
canvas-woven squares. Many have fine
velvet stripes and some have wide, solid
colored stripes alternating with rose vines
that also form stripes. The dark-ground
organdies are also unusually attractive
and are to be had in black, blue and dark
Prussian blue and navy covered over with
beautiful floral designs quite different
from the large stiff pansy and rose designs
seen a few seasons ago. * Even newer are
the patterns which show wide stripes of a
solid color on a white ground; narrow
stripes in rose, lilac, black, blue or green
alternating with white stripes of the same
width, and all over Persian patterns with
floral and scroll effects in varied colors.
It seems entirely too early to begin a
discussion of fabrics which are to figure in
garments for the next two seasons, and
yet Lent has always been selected by those
who prided themselves on being "before
hand ' as the proper time to make up all
the wash dresses at home, so the dealers
are hastening to unpack great cases of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1896.
AN EVENING COSTUME.
most ethereal weaves suitable for the
warmest weather, while the .snow in many
places is still lying on the ground.
All of us are interested in shirt waists,
which are to be as popular as ever, so
Vogue thus replies to a correspondent
who desires to learn what are to be the
newest sum per styles for washable shirt
waists: Shirts for the coming season are
to be made of cheviot, linen, percale,
batiste, linen, lawn, or in fact any of the
washable materials. The collars are about
two inches high, and turn over perfectly
straight, with straight corners comine
very close together instead of slanting
from wiiere they turn, as fftrmerly. The
collars are detachable, thus enabling one
to have several for each shirt of the
material of which the shirt is made, and
of white linen. On the shirts of the thin
materials which are to be much worn next
season the collars are of white linen.
Sleeves are very full at the top and finely
( athered into the armhole. Where
they join the cuff they are luller than
last year. Some of the cheviot shirts have
bishop's sleeves, butthev are not as pretty
as in the thin stuffs, as it makes them rather
bulky. The cuffs are about three inches
deep, and are made of the same material
as the shirt and may have square or round
corners, the square being smarter. The
thin shirts, such as lawn and batiste, have
bishop's sleeves and turned-back cuffs,
with which no sleeve-links are worn, but
buttons only under the cuff, where it is
turned back. If one prefers they may
have embroidered bands to finish the
sleeve. Many of these thin blouses have
fancy fronts, insertion let in, eaibroidered
bands or fine tucks, and with them may
be Worn satin stocks, and pleated belts of
different colors.
Girls, do not purchase any more black
crepon for shirts, as those, of black satin
are far more fashionable. They must be
of good quality, and in the end will prove
less expensive than those of crepon, for the
crepon must be made over a good silk, and
becomes rusty and dowdy, while the
satin wears well and makes an excellent
foundation for flounces of black lace,
grenadines, etc.
1 also give this week a back view of an
excellent tailor gown. Nothing could be
simpler than this costume, and no one
can deny its charms. It is made in a dark
purple tone of cloth. The large collar is
of white kersemere hemmed with a strap
ping of black satin. The coat is loose in
the front and fastens with a double row of
smoked pearl buttons set in steel, and on
the skirt (and it is an admirable one) the
strappings extend themselves to the
knees at the front seams, and these strap
pings I consider most disfiguring, and no
novelty of this kind will be taken up by
toe wise. In all other respects this gown
is worthy of commendation and imitation,
as it is suitable for all ordinary occasions.
The sacque-backed coat is now an indis
pensable garment for fashionable women.
The sleeves are of moderate dimensions,
and the back hangs in graceful pleats,
which are pre-eminently becoming to most
figures.
A Redfern gown of black cloth is in per
fect taste, it is of black clothâ the finest
ladies' cloth made. It has a jaunty jacket
with an inner waistcoat of violet velvet
showing a small Vest of white cloth. I
have seen a model for early spring. It is
a rough, checked tweed dress with a collar
and revers of plain drab cloth. Only a
good tailor can put these strappings on
correctly, as it is a delicate and extremely
difficult piece of work.
In fashionable drawing-rooms tea tables
are never seen now, for at 6 o'clock the
butler or maid serves the tea from a large
tray, usually of wood with carved edges,
covered with an exquisitely embroidered
lace edged cover. A wooden tray is most
used, as one writer wisely remarks that
"tne tray may be of silver, but one large
enough for the entire service would be too
heavy," and it should be remembered that
demitasses and spoons should never be
used for tea.
An ingenious cream and milk pitcher
combined has appeared in solid silver; it
holds milk in one side and cream in the
other. This will be appreciated by tea
drinkers, as many maintain that cream
utterly spoils tea, while others will have
cream', but if tea is not taken a la tlusse
milk is most correct.
A cracker jar of crocodile stone and
silver, made in exact imitation of the.curl
ing stones used in the north, is an attrac
tive novelty for my lady's table.
It is hard to realize, but in just about
three weeks from to-day Lent begins, so
we are beginning already to hear a great
deal about fancy work, which can be done
during the forty days. For instance,
many girls like to make pretty and expen
sive Easter gifts. Let us recommend to
them to try for linen picture-frames some
of the rococo designs, which long ago
superseded the flowered effects. When
gold thread is introduced in the conven
tional figures the frame is finished off with
a narrow gilt-beading in place of the heavy
watered paper. These frames are now
used for dainty bits of landscape as well as
for photographs.
Many sofa cushions are usually made
during the penitential season, and for
them art linens are to be had in almost
every conceivable artistic shade. These
are much used for sofa cushions, as is also
a new material in black and white â a cross
between linen and denim â which, em
broidered in ti:e bright silks and linens, is
especially adapted for piano and table
covers. Sofa pillows of the cloth embroid
ered in heavy all-over scrolls in blues, yel
lows and reds are extremely effective and
bear a close resemblance to the imported
Austrian embroideries.
The present fancy for Delft china has
caused the revival of the old onion pattern.
Such designs are not easy of execution, as
the work must be closely embroidered in
white silk, outlined with the blue. The
design calls for a round center piece, and
is most effective when fringed. The linen
must be very closely outlined in the white
silk, leaving a margin of two inches; this
can be frayed out up to the circular out
line without fear of raveling when laun
dried. The onion can be had in different,
sizes, suitable for center-pieces, caraffes
and individual plates; the last, of course,
are only used on the bare polished table.
It is quite wonderful how fleurs-de-lis as
a design for table linen retain their popu
larity. For example, five fleurs-de-lis scat
tered over a piece of linen twenty inches
square can be made artistic by drawing
close in white filo floss one way, uaing the
finest gold thread to darn across. Such a
centerpiece should be scalloped in white
with pale yellow shot in, forming an
irregular upper edge. The same design
carried out in white and that lovely new
shade of dull green i 3 even more to my
likine.
The most exquisite of sets are of the
finest linens and lawns witu insertions of
Honiton and point lace braid in ribbon
bow-knot and raised rose designs. The
latter is made by the lace being put on in
rows on the linen, which Is then cut out,
that the prevailing color of the luncheon
may appear beneath the roses. These in
sertions and edges may be had in all
widths, doylies being made of the nar
rowest. One set which caused me mo3t
warmly to express my artistic satisfac
tion was a combination of the lace braids
and the finest drawn work I have ever
seen.
A delightful dinner table I also ad
mired had the Delft pattern carried oat
as I have suggested, and in the center
stood a tall Delft lamp with fluted shaft
mounted on a base of the same supporting
the bowl. The napkins each had a tiny
onion design in one corneF.

In New York the Knickerbocker Riding
Club held their first meeting a few days
ago at Durland's Riding Academy. As
usual the fashionable set keep thisclnb
very exclusive, and each year it continues
to increase in popularity. It was organ
ized by Livingston Center some years ago,
and is now in the hands of Messrs. Fred
eric Pierson and Edward Thomas. It is
an interesting sight to watch the club ride
to music and form figures and quadrilles
in the ring. After the regular meeting is
over the most expert indulge in jumping.
When the season i- over the club gives a
dinner, which is always a social event.
The Knickerbocker Bowling Club is al
most equally successful, and this season
it is predicted that the competition wi.l be
fierce over the "scores rolled up for the
silver bowi." In San Francisco there
should certainly be a riding club well
patronized, as the wheel can never take
the place of the horse, and yet how unsuc
cessful all attempts have been of late to
form such an organization.
Fox-hunting is very popular in Balti
more, the clubhouse of the Green Spring
Valley ana the kennels of the EJkridge
Club being well attended.
A man writing to Vogue wants to know
how he had best have a frock coat made
and of what material, as he is only to have
one such coat. Many are in the position
of this inquirer, so I quote the reply: "If
you are to have only one frock coat it is to
be assumed that you intend to make it last
for a long timeâ say two, three or four
years. You should get a coat which is not
extreme in any respect. The men who
buy a great many clothes go from one ex
treme to another. Not so very long ago
they were making frock coats reaching
many inches below the knees. There are
men now who have gone to the other ex
ireme and maKe them far above the knee.
You will be always right, however, and
look well dressed if your frock coat
reaches just to the knee. Th> re is sub
stantially only one material; that is black
vicuna."
"Never have trinkets been less worn than
this season," is the remark of a New
Yorker, and such is the case as nowadays a
well dresÂ»ed man never allows his watch
to be visible and bunches of seals are things
of a bygone generation.
The ultra fashionable are again wearing
long frock coats winch have at once be
come popular and look well on very tall
men. They are being made in gray with
Droad collars of black velvet and cuffs.
Green is the color in London, all busi
ness suitings having a mixture of green in
them, and as for ties the rage is for black
ties with green patterns on them, and the
briclit green Tecks :ire in great vogue, and
even cigar-cases are made of green leather,
although cigar cases of polished silver are
considered in good form in New York.
From New York comes the information
that the high-banded turned-down collars
are the favorites for informal -dress, and
vary in height from 2% inches to 2 inches.
For full dress the best shape is the new
straight standing collar, which laps at the
buttonhole, the spacing gradually increas
ing until the top of the collar is reached,
whim the ends are sli htly poked. The
collars that stand straight, and break
slightly under the chin, are called poke
collars; however, the bent point collar is

As the English language, has well-settled
rules of pronunciation and is welt able to
deal in its own manner with almost any
possible combination of letters brought
into it from other languages, it would
seem to be not only permissible, but
proper, for English-speaking people to
pronounce foreign names according to
English analogies. It is not incumbent
upon Americans or Englishmen to farnil*

nmple, before they may venture to pro

news. It is enough, as a general rule, to
give to the odd combination of sounds pre
sented" to us in dispatches from Janan,
Bulgaria, the Transvaal or Venezuela such
utterances as the laws of our own lan
guage prescribe. Hit or miss, life is too
short to master the orthoepy of every
tongue, and we must be content to do
the best we tan in our own way. Espe
cially is this the case with proper names
that have long had a place in the English
language and have had a recognized Eng
lish pronunciation. It is m^re affectation
to convert Paris intoParee, or ape the Ger
man pronunciation of the name of Wag
ner, the well-known musician and com
poser, by giving a v twist to the first letter.
Paris is Paris and Wagner is Wagner, the
names being common and well under
stood. A person in the first enthusiasm
of his acquaintance with a foreign lan
guage may be pardoned for airing his su
perior knowledge when uncommon names
not .adopted in common English speech
are in question, but he becomes ridiculous
when he undertakes to impart a foreign
accent to familiar names. There is a story
of a New York clerk named Gordon, who,
after a month's stay in France, became
"Gor-r-rdong" and refused to answer to
any other appellation. His case was an
extreme one, peruaps, but it illustrates the
vice (too common) of using with excessive
ostentation foreign instead of the more
useful and intelligible English pronuncia
tions.
With respect to Latin and Greek proper
names a stricter rule may, perhaps, be con
ceded to apply. These languages are the
implements of culture. The rules of pro
nunciation applicable to words transferred
from them into English are simple and
few, and well within the reach of every
one who pretends to a classical education.
A false accent is, accordingly, nnpardon
able, and among classic scholars correct
ness of accent is the accepted test of sound
and thorough training. But in the sounds
given to particular letters there is room
for the manifestation of vanity or im
mature judgment. Cicero's name during
the lifetime of the great Roman orator
was undoubtedly pronounced Kikero,
and Ctesar was Kaisar. Other con
sonants and all the vowels were
in classical Latin pronounced in a way
which our English letters once followed,
but from which they have now for the most
part departed. At college it is well to learn
what is thought to have been the true
Latin pronunciation. All Knowledge is use
ful. But it is unnecessary in quoting Latin
after leaving college to aim at a cainful
Consistency. In respect, indeed, to names
like Cicero and Caesar, which have been
domesticated, so to speak, in the English
language, the/usual rule applies. They are
to be pronounced like English words, only
taking care to get the accent on the right
Byilable. The English-speaking American
people accept, ir fact, the common-sense
rule that pure English is always preferable
to a potpnilrri of German, Latin and other
pronunciations. â Baltimore Sun.
HAPPINESS.

That life contained such bliss;
Tliat from a. tiny germ could grow
Such happiness aa this.
At last I read the lesson taught
In Joy's mys erious eyes
As in some sweet wild creature's, caught
And brought me as a prize.
And this is lifeâ that irksome gift
I longed to put away â
The headlong force that strong and swift
Throbs In my veins to-day !
Thorp Is a host ef secret signs
And symphonies haif sung,
As if I read between the linet -

And throueh it all a meaning runs
I surely used to know;
I must have lived and felt it once

A sweet new message lurks between
The pulsing waves of light;
Dear God, till now I have not seen
Thy lovely world aright. â ScrtbDer**.

went up rapidly under lively, trading on call, the
cause being a further advance at Chicago and Liv

a break after the recent rise seem to have made a
break themselves.- It is the general opinion that
Wheat has gone up" to stay. up. Of course there
will be fluctuations. Trices will fail back again
every now and then, 1 but nobody, expects to see
Wheat again as cheap and demoralized as it has
been for the last two -years or so. No. 1, $1 13*4

THE DELUSIVE
ROYAL FLUSH
Offered as Bait in the
Nickel -in -the -Slot
Machines.
DOCTORED INSTRUMENTS
The Prevalent Gambling Fad
Made to Bring in Heavy
Returns.
POOR CHANCES FOR PLATERS.
The Cards Are Fixed in the Machines
So as to Easily Defeat the
Players.
"Who hasn't dropped a nickel m the Slot
Â©f those seductive little machines to be
found almost in any place where men most
do congregate?
Who, also, has not on some occasion,
ielt himself clever or lncky when the
nickel therein placed brought forth either
cigars or drinks far in excess of the amount
expended in the venture?
These successful occasions remain in-
A HARD GAME TO BEAT.
delibly impressed in the. player's . mind,'
and the hope of a recurrence has been as
disastrous alike to the youths and grown
men of this State as the worst implements
for gambling that have been prohibited by
police regulations.
It is almost an axiom that a man play
ing faro-bank for the first time, 'â¢ without
even the knowledge of how to place his
checks on the layout, will win ; his wager.
"Whether it is that .Providence looks out
lor the innocents, or some other inexpli
cable reason, the virgin player's luck when |
: he takes the initiatory degree, is always
a source of anxiety, to faro-bank dealers. : /
It is only after he has had the first taste
of blood that he is expected to rush in and
Jose, yes. keep on losing until some fine
day he has landed himself behind prison
bars.
It is the same thing with the nickel-in
the-slot .machines. They are located in
nearly ail the saloons and cigar-stores in
the City, eating up nickels as fast as the j
"tiger" cat,' eat up dollars.
It is a common thing now for clerks in
downtown houses, boys in retail stores
and promerLaders along the thoroughfares
to form poois. They each put in a few
nickels and play the machine, expecting
to win at lea.it an equivalent in drinks
and cigars to the" investment.
The players* always bear in mind some
previous winning, and forget entirely the
subsequent losings, and tuey go ahead.
The machine whirls around thousands of
. times daily, and the saloon man or cigar
dealer sits baak in happy contentment
: from the knowledge that he has all the ad
â  vantages and cannot but quit winner.
The desire for playing these machines
i has become so â¢ great'that in most of the
' ale houses of , this City â  the players have
found it necessary to place their winnings
to their credit, or else take tickets or metal
I checks entitling "â  them . to drinks at some
! future time. It is not that the winnings
I are so great as compared to the number of
! nickels' dropped in the slot, but that the
1 gambling interest beine once aroused the
' player keeps on feeding the machine hop- '
ing for some good stroke of luck which
will bring to him tickets f enough to off
, ctand the money expended. Seldom, if
; ever, this occurs, and the player : finds
himself overwhelminely out of pocket, but
j "with tickets galore ! which he .' must " pack
( around or fill himself and friends up with
i 'beverages undesired at the time. . '
I In every way these nickel-in-the-slot
machines are against the public good,
i and, strange to say, while they were
â  .gathered in, confiscated and broken up by
â¢the police a year ago, , they are now per
j mitted to run everywhere with open doors
i end unmolested. â 
â¢ The craze for this kind of gambling has
, â¦become so great that the handlers of the
.machines are brazen in their methods : of
i dealing with their i customers. They cut
i! Â»ip head cards with alluring prizes.
"Free Drinks" , or "Free Cigars" in big
iblack letters top the quantities that may
tie won. â  â  â  .
In some saloons four quarts of ; cham
pagne are â¢ given if the : player secures a
'. -royal : flush. That appears to be vary
| tempting. A straight flush wins one quart
of champagne, and four aces one pint â of
; ' champagne:- For these same hands in the
â  rotation mentioned 100,50 and 18 "cigars
â¦are given to the successful player. c From :
I these top hands down to ; a j pair .of : aces
1 drints or cigars are dispensed - s in accord
i ance with, the .proprietor's judgment of
j the value of the hand. - i > ..,';.-,:':-.
i .-'â¢ If these little machines only were
â¢ straight and honest, and the player had a
1 fair chance of winning an equivalent of
' the money ne invests, one element of
wrong, would be i removed. , But \ such .is
: not the case. 'When the machines were
introduced here ? a short time prior to the
I Midwinter Fair, they were comparatively.
â¢ new and as fair as such a game could pos
sibly ' bt. r Since . then, however, > like in
, many, other things ' success brought ' about
y, a greed for more. . - V .
l. Like ;'" the . ; man of , the ; golden egg
story, â¢ the . machine handlers were i 'not
â  satisfied with their rich â  harvest, and they
j have doctored their - games :so that at this
| time the goose is being killed. : * ; â 
â¢; .' It seems superfluous to describe the ma-'
i chine. , In its ordinary appearance iit is
â¢ already^ well . known, but \ few people ex
.-" cepting the owners know of * its inside
â¢ workings. In fact, the proprietors of ' the
establishments where they are in operation.
:â¢ find it judicious to make some excuse in
â  not r acquiescing to the request of acus
! tomer to see the inside works. ;., ; :. '.:; T
' '.: The reason is obvious to anyone who has
} investigated the affair. It is composed of
: five little : cylinders or drums, on f each of
: i which ll- are : ten cards. This â¢; makes fifty ; .
; cards ;in *, all, or two i less than a ; complete
1 deck. Hence,' these two missing cards are
i an element against four of a kind coming
! out at all times, and lessening the players'
chances in making even a pair or three of
\\n kind in the two missing suits. But this
|is only a small matter. "; . - : -
i It is in the distribution of: the cards on (
the cylinders that the jobbery is done.
While* the remaining fifty cards are
placed, they are arranged in silch a way
that there is not a machine running in
this City to-day with more than one royal
flush in it, if there is even that much.
Speak to a proprietor of a machine, he
will look at you in perfect amazement if
you eVen supg'est this possibility. He will
try to make you believe that the usual
four royal flushes in an ordinary deck of
cards may be turned out at any time, but
it is not a fact. And to prove this a cus
tomer has but to insist on the runner of
the game opening up his machine, if he
will.
It is not that the five top cards of each
suit are not on the cylinders, but that in
each suit, excepting one, two ot the cards
necessary in the royal flush happen to be
on the same cylinder; and but one can pos
sibly snow up.
Therefore, in the machines where there
is but one royal flush to be had it may
easily be computed what few chances a
player has to draw it. To get the first
card it is one chance in ten. To get the
second at the same time is one in a hun
dred, the third card one in a thousand,
and so on. In other words, it is one
chance in one hundred thousand for a
single royal flush to come out. Is it there
fore astonishing that the saloon proprietor
can risk four bottles of champagne against
a nickel?
As to the four-of-a-kind cards the ma
chines are usually all right, excepting with
the jacks and tens. In a machine exam
ined yesterday by a Cam, reporter and an
artist of The Call's staff both the jacks
and tens were short.
The cards calculated to bring about
straights and flushes are also.placed so as to
minimize the 'chances of them. And it
is so with the hands calculated to" bring
good returns to the players.
If people will go into saloons or cigar
stores to drink or smoke it would not be a
bad idea^ to buy their requirements out
right. At all events it is a good thing to
let the nickel-in-the-slot machines severely
aione.
HIS DEATH AN ACCIDENT.
Verdict of the Coroner's Jury in the
Cage of Russell Warren.
Russell Warren, the old printer who was
foreman of the Chronicle for so many
years and who was found asphyxiated at
his home, 620 Folsom street, on Thursday,
was said by a Coroner's jury yesterday to
have come to his death by accident.
It came out that he had, the evening
before, maae arrangements with a friend,
Harry Loy, which discounted any sus
picion of suicide. The supposition is that
Warren turned off his gas when lie re
tired and by some accident turned it on
again.
Warren was very popular among those
who knew him well and his untiraely
death is much regretted.
GUARDSMEN ARE ANGRY.
Officers of the Defunct Third
Regiment Vote Blank
Ballots.
Members of the Nationals Say Their
Only Fault Was to Have a
Majority.
There were a sorry lot of National
Guardsmen assembled at the armory at
the corner of Gough aud Page streets last
evening. They were representatives of
Companies A, E and H, which had just
reluctantly moved from their late quarters
at Tenth and Market streets.
Captain Conley of Company A was
mournfully directing his men as they
groped about with lanterns, no gas fixtures
having yet been erected, stowing away the
paraphernalia.
These three companies, all of the de
funct Third Regiment, feel as if they were
being pursued by fate. As one of the
members remarked, '-It looks as though
somebody is always trying to give us th c
worst of it" â  .
At the election held in the armory of
the Nationals, on Ellis street, near Polk,
the companies in question feel that they
sustained an irreparable injury. Accord
ing to their story, ex^Captai n John Tilden
had made arrangements with them to
have the members of the old Third Regi
ment and the Nationals, vote for either
J. F. Smith or J. C. O'Conn or for lieuten
ant-colonel. Either of these would have
been satisfactory to the members of the
late Third, but when they learned that
Tilden was engineering his forces to elect
Victor Duboce, a distinctly National can
didate, the Third rebelled. Tilden then
told them, so they claim, that their votes
were immaterial, as he could elect any
man he chose without them. An addi
tional sting was added to this boast by the
fact that a count of noses indicated that
he could make it .good.
When the evening for the election ar
rived tbjj officers of the Third, fifteen in
number, duly attended and cast their bal
lots, but, when the returns were canvassed
fifteen ballots were found unmarked; and
these were the ballots cast by the officers
of the Third. As a restflt Charles Tilden,
Charles Baxter and Captain Mangel were
elected majors and Duboce was elected
lieutenant-colonel with 20 votes out of a
possible 33, with no opposition. At the
conclusion of the election the victorious
Nationals invited the vanquished Third to
a banquet. Tho scorn with which the in
vitation was rejected was not altogether
silent and a free fight at one time looked
imminent.
The explanation of Captain E. C. Sutliffe
of Company G, which with Company C is
one of the companies known as the
Nationals, does not entirely accord with
the story as told by the officers of the
Third- "All is fair in war," he . said, "and
the only thing they have to complain of is
we had more votes. There was no boast
made that we could elect any man we
wished. They said all they wanted was
their late major, Thomas Drady, for major
of the new regiment. There were three
vacancies to be filled. We made all three
nominations, Charles Tilden, Charles Box
ton and Thomas Drady, their man. On
the first ballot Tilden and Boxton each
received 20 votes and Drady received 15.
''Had they all voted for their man, he
would have received thirty votes. As it
was he lacked three votes of receiving
enough to elect. Another ballot was re
quired, and as they refused to voie for
their own man, we "put up J. H. Mangel
and elected him. They did not nominate
any one for lieutenant-colonel, but in
sisted on a ballot and then voted blanks."
As a result of the clash, several of the
officers of the olu Third, including Cap
tain Fitzpatrick of Company E, are said
to contemplate resigning.

"THE AMERICAN DOLLAR DOG.
Death of the -Famous Canine Detector
of Counterfeit Money.
Tony, "the American dollar dog," died
at Cheyenne, Wyo., last Tuesday,
aged 8 years. When Tony was a year old
he was found to have an unaccountable
craving for American silver dollars. He
would refuse to touch any other kind of
coin, and as his passion for American dol
lars was fostered by his owner, George W.
Brown, he soon became an expert in dis
criminating between a good do-liar and
a counterfeit.
Tony would refuse to pick up a counter
feit dollar, a Mexican dollar, a 5 franc
piece or $20 gold piece, but would catch a
good American dollar in his mouth before
TONY, THE SILVER DOLLAR DOG.
it could reach the ground whenever one
was thrown to him. He became the talk
of the town and wa9 always shown to vis
itors as one of the attractions of the city.
Hundreds of these visitors were credulous
of the stories told of Tony, but went away
convinced after trying him with good
and bad coins. The dog's wonderful
faculty was fully tested wnen he was
about two year.s old, when he was taken to
Denver, and in the presence of a number
of bank officials and other coin experts
tested with coins by the United States
Treasury Department. Scores of counter
feits, some of them excellent enough to
deceive the ordinary bank cashier, were
thrown to him, but he refused to pick
them up, while he would jump for joy
and eagerly snatch up every good dollar.
Upon one occasion a dollar of doubtful
appearance was given to Tony's owner.
Thinking it was counterfeit, Mr. Brown
threw it to Tony, who without hesitation
picked it np. Mr. Brown accepted the
coin as good and included it with his next
deposit at the bank. The bank cashier
thiew it out and declared it counterfeit.
Mr. Brown then sent the co;n to the
Treasury Department, where it was found
to be genuine.
The wonderful faculty of the animal led
his owner to utilize him formonev making
purposes and for almost a year Tony was
a dime museum star in Denver, Salt Lake
City, Butte and other Western cities, al
ways attracting attention and never mak
ing a failure in discriminating between
good and bad coin. The constant work of
picking up coins wore out the clog's front
teeth, and he had to be retired from the
stage. Although his teeth were almost
gone Tony's love for silver dollars did not
I diminish and even in his last and fatal
I sickness he could only be kept quiet by al
i lowing him to play with an American* sil
ver dollar. Tony's death was caused by
dropsy ana a cola contracted on a recent
trip on which he was taken to Denver and
Salt Lake City. 1 ony was a cross between
a Yorkshire setter and a bulldog. Aside
from a bright intelligent face he was not
very prepossessing in appearance, being a
typical ''yellow dbsj-" His owner valued
him at $5000 and refused numerous tempt
ing offers for him.
The Word Blotorman.
A& the word rnotorman is already in
common use to. designate a man whose
occupation is to operate a motor which
propels a car, it seems quite consistent
with good logic and good usage to extend
the use of this term to include those whose
occupation it will be to operate motor ve
h.'cles, whether Dublic or private. In the
case of public stapes and omnibuses this
extension will be easy, but the aristocratic
term, "coachman," is likely to prove more
obstinate, because of the love of the aristo
cratic classes for terms which separate or
distinguish them from anythinc public or
common.
But if the men whose occupation it is to
operate a motor vehicle is to be called a
motorman why may not the term apply
also 1o a man whose occupation it is to run
and care for the motor boat? With the
increased demand for motor vehicles and
boats will come a corresponding demand
for men competent to manage them.
Those who take up this work will consti
tute a special branch of skilled laber, and
for the entire class no better word appears
than "motormen."
An Old Kail way.
There was a railway in'f all working or
der in 1805 (perhaps the Surrey Iron Rail
way). I have an advertisement card of
this line dated "Wandsworth, Bth Jany.,
1805," in which it is stat'd that the Croy
don and Merstham Iron Railway is open
to the public, and that the tolls vary from
Id per ton per mile for dung to 2d per ton
per mile for chalk, brick, etc. ; 3d for lum
ber, metals, coke, corn, Hour and potatoes,
and 3d tier caldron for coals. A memor
andum in manuscript at the back of the
card indicates that sixty miles of the line
cost Â£50,000, that each wagon carried two
and a half tons, that one horse drew two
wagons, and that the carriage cost 4d per
ton per mile, besides the toll. The gauge
of the rails appears to have been 4 feet 2
inches.â Notes and Queries.
