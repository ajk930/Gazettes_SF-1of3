Cleveland Cables Kruger in
Behalf of John Hays
Hammond.
SENTENCE IS COMMUTED
But the Punishment of Those
Convicted in the Transvaal
Is Yet Undecided.
BOERS HOLD THEWINNING HAND
Telegrams Show That Jameson Acted
Under Instructions From High
Sources.
PRETORIA, South Africa, April 30.â
It is rumored that President Kruger has
received a personal cablegram from Presi
dent Cleveland regardin?.Tohn Hays Ham
mond, one of the leaders of the reform
committee, who was sentenced to death
for hiph treason.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April SO.-Sec
retary Olney, on the 2Mh inst, telegraphed
the Secretary of State for the South Afri
can Republic that it was assumed that the
death sentence of Hammond and other
American citizens was imposed with the
understanding that the sentence would be
commuted, and that he would like assur
ance on that point. The answer came this
morning from tue Transvaal Secretary as
follows:
"There was no talk of an understanding
between the Judge and the Government
before the sentence of death was pro
nounced, but before the reception of your
telegram the Executive Council had re
Â»otved to let mercy take the place of jus
tice and not to enforce the death penalty."
Secretary Olney later in the day re
ceived a second cablegram, which ex
plained why Yice-Cons:il Knight's mes
sage haa not stated the nature or severity
of the sentence of Hammond. The second
cablegram was from Mr. Chapin, the agent
at Pretoria of Grace & Co. of. New York.
He said that the substitute sentence of
Hammond and the four others condemed
to death had not been decided upon. As
for those who were sentenced to two years'
imprisonment, three years' imprisonment
and $10,000 fine the Executive Council had
taken no action.
The petition signed by the Senators and
R'spreFentativeJ asking clemency for Ham
mond will be cabled immediately.
Evidence of tha Duplicity of the Englinh
in the Raid.
LONDON*, E>B., April 30.â A dispatch
from Pretoria to the Times says that the
health of John Hays Hammond is in
such a state as to cause great anxiety.
He is obliged to eat ordinary prison fare,
which in the state of his health is any
thing but beneficial. New rules go into
operation to-day, the correspondent says,
which permit prisoners to have better
food and enjoy many comforts now denied
them. The leaders condemned to death
are coiifined in one small room, where
they are visited by crowds of friends and
relatives.
A rumor is in circulation on the Stock
Exchange that the Transvaal Executivp
has imposed a punishment of five years'
penal servitude, with banishment at the
end of the imprisonment, upon Ham
mond, Rhodes and the other reform com
mittee leaders whose sentence of death
T *as commuted yesterday.
In the House of Commons to-day Cham
berlain said that he was informed that the
presiding Judge who imposed sentence on
Rhodes, Hammond, Farrar, Phillips and
the other members of the reform commit
tee in the High Court at Pretoria bad been
borrowed from the Orange Free State. His
name, he said, was Gregorowski and he
was of Polish nationality.
Dalziel asked whether the selection of
Judge Gregorowski was an indication of
impartiality or corruption, and Chamber-
Jain made no reply. Dalziel gave notice
that he would ask the question again for
mally.
A vastly different aspect has been put
on the Transvaal trouble by the publica
tion of a number of cipher telegrams,
translations of which will be found below.
It has been claimed by many interested
persons that Cicil Rhodes, the head and
front of the British South Africa Com
pany, and other officials of that concern
were not cognizant of the intended raid
into the territory of a friendly State and
had no knowledge that a revolution was
pending in Johannesburg.
Some critics of the company, notably
Mr. i^abouchere, M. P., editor of Truth,
held that the company's officials were
fully aware of the intended movements,
and scathingly arraigned them for their
duplicity and hypocrisy. This called down
upon his head vituperative abuse from
ceitain journals, against whicn there is
more than a suspicion that they are sub
sidized by the company.
It appears now, however, to be pretty
firmly established that the event has justi
fied Sir. Ltbouchere's charges, and this
fact is admitted even by the papers that
have heretoforo been firm in their defense
of Mr. Rhodes and Ins colleagues. The
publication of the telegrams will prove a
rather severe blow to tlie cock-sure di
plomacy of Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, who has been
lauded on all sides for the great skill he
had displayed in the negotiations with
President Kruger.
A careful review of all the facts since the
trouble beiran will show that every move
on the diplomatic chessboard has been
won by the man, whom many of the Eng
!i;hmeÂ« characterized an ignorant Boer.
He may be ignorant, he himself has even
confessed that he has little learning de
rived from books, but ail through the
trouble he has shown that for the Trans
val he is the right man for the place he
holds. He is a natural-born diplomat,
who has made Mr. Chamberlain bis toy
throughout. His keeping all knowledge
of the incriminating telegrams from pub
lic knowledge until the moÂ«t opportune
moment arrived for their publication is
considered, even by those who can in no
sensa be called his admirers, as a master
stroke of diplomatic sagacity. It leaves
the whole crowd of "chartered free-boot
ers," as they have been termed, without a
leg to stand upon.
So convincing is the proof of their com
plicity in the crime that some of their
apologises intimate that the dispatches are
forgeries, "or that they have been willfully
mistranslated. There is convincing evi
dence, however, that they are genuine,
and that the translations are correct. They
prove that for some time prior to Dr.
Jameson's raid into the Transvaal the
leading official.* of the Chartered Company
were fully aware of what was going on,
and that Dr. Jameson was acting under
instructions from some one high in the
councils of the company. When the crash
came the prime movers in the revolution
ary agitation scurried for shelter, and Dr.
Jameson, thoueh perhaps equally guilty
with tbem, was made a scapegoat for all
their wrong-doing in this direction. As
the case at present stands President Kru
ger is master of the situation, and con
siderable interest is felt as to what the
next move on the part of Mr. Chamberlain
will be.
It is noticeable that the papers that were
so bitter in their comments upon the
Transvaal Government when the an
nouncement was madeof the severe sen
tences that had been passed upon the Pre
toria prisoners are now rather more than
mild in speaking of the matter, which is
very good proof that the publication of the
dispatches has had the effect that Presi
dent Kriiger undoubtedly intended it to
have. Messrs. Rhodes, Beit and Harris
will very likely be called upon to explain
their connection with the conspiracy, and
a further explanation will be due from Mr.
Rhode* of the assurance he gate to Mr.
Chamberlain during his reeeni, visit to
England.
PRETORIA, Sor-rit Africa, April 30.â
A great sensation has been caused here by
the publication of a series of telegrams
that were entered as evidence at the trial
of the members of the reform committee.
These telegrams, it is claimed here,
show beyond any doubt whatever that the
raid of Dr. Jameson was not the result of
a desire to protect the women and children
of Johannesburg, in the event of a rising
there, as lias been argued by certain Eng
lish newspapers, but was the outcome of a
carefully prearranged plan on the part of
certain individuals of the South Africa
Company to seize a portion of the Trans
vaal, a portion well known to be the rich
gold reef of "Witwaters Rand on which
Johannesburg is located. Some of the tel
egrams were in cipner and on their face
were apparently harmless business mes
sages that had passed between different
men connected with Johannesburg and
the South Africa Company.
At the time Dr. Jameson and his com
panions were captured by the Boers the
Jatter found in the doctor's bag a key for
code messages- This was taken possession
of by the authorities, who later obtained
the message- containing words correspond
ing -with those in the Key. In certain cases
the words in the original messages could
not .be deciphered by the use of the key,
and in these cases the code words were
read as in the dispatches.
The dates of the aispatches ranged from
December 7 to December 29. Following
are extracts from the messages:
December 11â Colonel Rhodes, Johannes
burc, to White, Male Icing: Inform Jameson
not to send more horses before January. No
room for them.
December 13â Stevens. Cape Town, to Colonel
Rhodes, Johannesburg: Jameson wires most
strongly urpiag no postponing shareholders'
meeting. Let Hammond inform weak part
ners that any delay most injurious.
December ISâ Hammond, Johannesburg, to
Cecil Rhodes, Cape Town: Cannot arrange re
spective interests without Beit. Flotation
must be delayed until his arrival.
December 18â Dr. Wolff, Johannesburg, to
White, I'itsani: I suggest that you immedi
ately instruct Major Grey to forward as soon as
possible 200,000 rounds of his surplus ammu
nition to Gardner Williams.
December 21â Colonel Rhodes, Johannes
burg, to Charter, Cape Town: Inform C. J.
Rhodes stated chairman won't leave unless
special letter inviting him. Definite assurance
been given by all of us that on date flotation
you and he will leave. There must be no de
parture from this, as many subscribers agreed
to take shares on this assurance. You re
sponsible for chairman's departure.
December 21â Han is, Cape Town, to Colonel
Rhodes, Johannesburg: Beit has telegraphed,
urging start flotation new company. Reply
when you can start float, so I may advise
Jameson same day.
Harris also sent a dispatch similar to the
above to Dr. Jameson at fitsani.
December 23â Harris, Cape Town, to Colonel
Khodcs, Johannesburg: Boit has wired Phil
lips, assuring him thtt chairman starfs im
mediately the flotation takes place. No invi
tation necessary.
December l!3-Harris, Cape Town, to Jame
son, I'itsani: Company wiil be floated next
Saturday midnight They are very anxious
that you do not start before 9 and secure tele
grnph office silence. AVe suspect Transvaal
getting slightly aware.
December 26â Cecil Rhodes, Johannesburg,
to Charter ,Cape 'Town: Absolutely postpone
flotation. Leonard left last night Cape Town.
On the above date Harris re peated the
last-mentioned dispatch to Dr. Jameson,
adding: "You must not move until you
hear again. Too awful. Very sorry."
On the same date Jameson's brother
telegraphed to Johannesburg to Dr. Jame
son, informing him that it had become
necessary to postpone the "flotation"
through unforeseen and unexpected cir
cumstances, and "until we have C. J.
Rhodes' absolute pledge that the officers
of the imperial Government will not be
insisted upon."
On December 27 Harris sent a dispatch
to Dr. Jameson, referring to a share
holders' meeting to he held on January 6,
and requesting him to wait patiently.
On the same clay Harris sent another
dispatch to Dr. Jameson referring to the
distribution of the British South Africa
Company's police.
On December 28 Harris, in another dis
patch to Dr. Jameson, stated that Leonard
and Hamilton had informed him that the
movement was unpopular in Johannes
burg. This message concluded: "Wecan
not have a fiasco."
On December 28 Dr. Jameson telegraphed
to Dr. Wolff at Johannesburg saying:
"Meet me as arranged before you leave,
which will enahla us to decide the best
destination. Make cutting to-night with
out fail. Have great faith in Hammond,
Lawley and miners with Lee-Medford ri
fles."
The Harris whose name appears in the
foregoing dispatches is evidently Dr. Har
ris, secretary in South Africa of the Char
tered Company.

CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., April 30.â The
cause of yesterday's fire is a matter of
speculation. A waitress in the Portland
Hotel was in the kitchen when the blnze
first broke through the partition-wall, and
she states that the fire originated in the
Chicago Restaurant, adjoining the hotel.
But the fire burst out simultaneously from
so many places as to still leave the iru
pression that arson was committed. Coal
oil fumes were detected about the school
house to-day, and some women created a
sensation this afternoon by telling of see
ing two men trying to set lire to a resi
dence near the reservoir. One unknown
man was killed yesterday, one shot and a
number of suspicious characters were ar
rested during the night and locked up in
boxcars, in lieu of any bettor place to con
fine criminals.
The burned district of yesterday covered
seventeen blocks. The Masonic Temple
building was but partially destroyed, ana
there the mass-meeting of citizens was
held to-day to consider the grave situa
tion. . Committees â¢ were named to take
charge of relief work and headquarter*
were opened at the Midland Terminal
Depot and at the two schoolhouses.
Men, women and children, cold, hungry
and worn out with their hardships of the
night, flocked about the depot when the
relief train from , Denver and Colorado
Springs arrived at 6 o'clock this morning.
Their wants were soon satisfied, the tents
were rapidly set up and by noon pome
thing like order prevailed. What provis
ions were saved from the fire commanded
fancy prices, beef selling at $1 a pound
and bread 25 cents a loaf.
The First National Bank opened before
9 o'clock in a warehouse and money was
issued upon demand. The Bimetallic
Bank will open to-morrow morning. In
the burned .district of Saturday's fire the
work of erecting temporary building* wÂ»
3
resumed, and the piles cf salvage from
yesterday's lire, which had been carried
there, were put in something like order to
day.
Trains of supplies of all kinds came in
late to-day and more is announced. The
generous response of the entire State is
greatly appreciated, and while there wil!
be many cases of Hiffe : ig during the
coming two or three day the people will
soon ho able to Ta â â¢>- ,' thcui.^elver
There is a determination plainly shown
to rid the camp of undesirable crooks and
tramps. At noon fifty tramps were lined
up and drummed out of town. All arrested
suspects were later on sent to Colorado
Springs. A vigilance committee has been
formed, and no mercy will be shown to
violators of good order. I his committee
will work quietly, and wiil not give out
anything to the public. The result of this
policy has been wholesome, and few com
plaints of thieving have been made.
It is impossible to state to-night how
many were burned in the fire yesterday.
All kinds of rumors are afloat and many
persons are missing, borne ivive gone out
of town and some are off on the hills with
friends. At the improvised morgue are
tbree dead bodies â that of Charles Griilith,
a miner: the unknown incendiary shot by
Floyd Thompson, and an unknown miner.
The revised list of the injured is as follows:
John Rose, broken leg; Claude Stanton.
badly brqiifed; E. W. Lewis, cut and
bruised ; Tom Sewall, leg injured; George
L. Ryden, burned and bruised; J. W.

head and legs; John Youngstrum, slight
cuts; Charleg Kagodali, skull fractured;

LOS ANGELES, Cxr,., April 30.â The de
ception, duplicity and forgery to which
Collis P. Huntincton's Los Angeles man
agers have resorted in the past in making
a showing from this city presumably in
favor of the Santa Monica harbor scheme
have been brought to licht and exposed by
affidavits from the parties who circulated
the many false and forged documents. It
is an exposition of double dealing to the
point of utter amazement.
To-morrow morning when this darinp
mess of perfidy is published to the world
the public will know for the first time how
to account for many apparent incon
sistencies in connection with this double
harbor fight. Petitions have, from time
to time, been forwarded by Hunttngton'a
henchmen in Washington purporting to
come from "labor organizations" and "cit
izens of Los Angeles" in great numbers
and with hundreds of signatures. The
Chamber of Commerce and Free Harbor
League here, favorable to the San Pedro
appropriation alone, have been at their
wits' end to account for these numerously
signed petitions favoring Santa Monica.
The first inkling the people here had of
the=e wholesale forgeries was contained in
the Times here this morning, in a dispatch
from its special correspondent at Washing
ton. The very first name forged was that of
Colonel Otis, editor and manager of the
paper. From Washington comes tele
grams from committees of the Chamber of
Commerce and other friends of San Pedro
making inquiry as to purported messages
from various prominent citizens and
bodies of men here favoring Huntington's
schemes. When it was discovered tnat
petitions sent by wire had been forged,
inquiry as to mail petitions were sent to
day by the Free Harbor League to Patter
son and Hazard, representatives in Wash
ington of the league and the people. The
following response was received here this
afternoon :
Washington, D. G., April 30, 1896.
To T. E. Gibbon : Have just prepared for
Wells full copies of petitions mailed to White.
Many signatures evidently written by same
person. W. C. Patterson,
H. T. Hazard.
These are undoubtedly the petitions re
ferred to in affidavits of Lowden and Man
ning hereafter appended. In addition to
this dispatch, Hon. John F. Humphreys
of this city, a member of the Chamber of
Commerce and Free Harbor League, re
ceived this afternoon the following:
Did you and Workman (referring to ex-
Mayor Workman) forward me a postal tele
gram April 16, containing petition of large
number of members of Chamber of Commerce
favoring Santa Monica and inner harbor (Saa
Pedro)? See original postal office.
Stephen M. White.
To this Mr. Humphreys immediately
sent the following:
: To Senator Stephen M. White, Washington, D.C.: \
We did not. c Any item with our names thereto '
favoring Hun ting ton's Santa Monica scheme is
& forgery. Long list of forgeries published in
to-day's Times. Great indignation exists here
about it. . The people realize if Hunting- ;
ton gets recognition now he is strong enough
to defeat San Pedro later on.
John F. Humphreys.
The first and most startling affidavit is
that 'of George Anderson, who manipu
lated the whole business for Huntington's
local managers. These affidavits have
been procured, by the Chamber of Com
merce here and the Free Harbor League.
They , we.* a, given to the correspondents
late this afternoon, and to-night will be
telegraphed to Senator "White, Congress
man ' McLachlan and Patterson and Haz
ard, and will be made public there to
morrow. This, it is believed, will defeat
one of the biggest steals ever attempted on
the National treasury for private ends.
These affidavits will be corroborated by
statements from fifteen out of twenty- two
labor organizations of this city, who de
clare that t.he names of persons purport
ing to belong to said organizations are
fictitious from . beginning to end. The
league has also the affidavit of E. D. Mor
ris, referred to in Anderson's affidavit, fully
corroborating all the allegations in regard
to himself. : ; ' â¢
According to Anderson's affidavit, he em
ployed one E. D. Morris to procure names
to petitions favorable to Huntingdon, with
out regard to residence or occupation, and
â¢hat the whole was manipulated and paid
for at so much for each petition ; that J. P.
Carrere, editor of the Evening Express of
this city, made the bargain with him; that
said Anderson filled a clerical position on
the Express and that J. M. Crawley of the
Southern Pacific knew about the arrange
ment; that he employed E.D.Morris to
secure the signatures, and that as fast as
Morris brought in the petitions he (Ander
son) took them to said Carrere.
Morris, in his affidavit, tells how he
wrote the names of any one he could think
of to the petitions and got signatures from
loafers about saloons and similar places
and at Santa Monica. Two supplemental
affidavits are given as follows :
State of California, County of Los Angeles. â
W. Lowden, being first duly sworn, deposes and
says: That he is a citizen of the city of Los An
geles, by occupation a waiter, and is ac
quainted with E. I). Morris; that some three
weeks ago the said E. D. Morris came to him
and asked him to sign his name to a petition
addressed to Senator White and Mr. McLach
lan purporting to be from the citizens of Los
Angeles and asking them to endeavor to secure
the appropriations tor San Pedro and Santa
Monica harbors which the House Committee
on Rivers and Harbors had at one time agreed
to recommend; that he signed his own name
to said petition, and at the request of Mr. Mor
ris signed several other names, probably seven
in all; that in signing such names he was not
endeavoring to get the name of any particular
person, but signed such names as came into
his mind, without reference to any individual
to whom they might belong.

SANTA ROSA, Cal., April 30.â The
carnival holds full sway to-night, for the
Queen has just been crowned with pomp
ana pageantry, and as President J. C.
Sims expressed it: "The peerless Queen
has revealed herself to her loyal subjects,
and- has issued a proclamation of banish
ment to consuming cares."
The weather all day has been glorious,
and the preparations for to-morrow's pro
cession have been progressing merrily.
To-night the city is one mass of brilliant
carnival colors and fragrant ftower3. Even
the oldest inhabitants say they scarcely
know Santa Rosa in her '9t> carnival dress,
so greatly have the decorations trans
formed the city. The courthouse, from
dome to stairway, is resplendent in red,
green and - yellow bunting. Streamers
flutter from the apex of the dome to points
all along the parapet, the columns all en
twined in carnival colors, and the statue
of Minerva, which surmounts the struc
ture, wears a tri-colored cap and waves
aloft the American flag.
The square surrounding the courthouse
is one mass of red, green and yellow, for
scarcely one of the buildings has omitted
to decorate, and Fourth street presents
one long vista of fluttering flags, arches
and incandescent lights. Most of the
stores wear the carnival colors, many of
them being resplendent in artistic decora
t.ons, where moss, flowers, bunting and
colored lanterns play a conspicuous part.
There are six arches distributed along
the principal streets, and strings innu
merable of fluttering streamers cross and
reerosa the principal <uree;. Elaborate
decorations nave been lavished upon the
Donahue depot, and even the streetcars
wear carnival colors and are garlanded
with flowers. Wherever a convenient spot
offers pretty airy-looking booths have been
erected along the route of to-morrow's
procession, and in these booths the weary
wayfarer can find food and cooiing drinks
for an almost nominal sum, while he sits
to eat under garlands of roses and ever
green.
Last year visitors came in such hordea
that even bread ran short, but for the
present carnival enough provisions have
been laid in to feed an army. People have
been arriving in town all day, and before
8 o'clock this evening there was a dense
throng assembled outside the Athenaeum
to see the Queen and her cortege arrive.
Her Majesty's procession was led by
Roncovieri's Band playing the ''Fiesta
March," recently composed by the band's
conductor. The Queen rode in a barouche
drawn by six milk-white horses with white
satin trappings, her coach being lined
with satin and furs of white. The maids
of honor followed in gayly decorated car
riages. It was well on toward 9 o'clock
before the strains of the band announced
the approach of the royal procession. By
this tiroe^the.crowd outside tht Athenaeum
had increased and every seat in the build
ing had been taken, while people were en
camped in the aisles on stools.
While waiting for the Queen there was
plenty of time to admire the decorations.
The roof was festooned in carnival colored
bunting, Chinese lanterns and cypress en*
circled the gallery, and the platform wag
banked up with masses of lilies, ferns and
palms.
The throne was white, on a dais of white
bearskin, and overhead was a huge pink
and white butterfly. As the commotion
outside warned the people within the
theater that the procession had arrived,
there was a loud and prolonged applause.
The queen and her attendants adjourned
to the anteroom, while the band took the
platform and played the overture to
"Robin Hood."
President Sims, who delivered the in
augural address, said among other grace
ful things:
"The Santa Rosa rose carnivals have at
tracted particular attention and have
achieved a special glory. The residents of
this community annually make princely
preparations for them, ami all take pride
in their success. Thanks to the kind
efforts of the people and of the press of
this State, failures are as yet unknown.
To thesu carnivals all are invited and
given a fitting welcome."
The speaker went on to pay a graceful
compliment to the queens of the various
festivals and spoke warmly of tha
athletic sportWind their beneiicial influ
ence on the young people. : 'In conclu
sion, let me say to those who have favored
us with their presence durine this festival,
that with the fragrance of our flowers, we
mingle the sweeter fragrance of our wel
come."
As soon as the applause aroused by the
president's speech had subsided, a bugle
blast from the entrance, answered by one
from the platform, announced the advent
of the Queen. The band struck up the
"Coronatioa March," the doors were
thrown open, and a train of eight little
maids in white entered, throwing flowers
in the Queen's way. The children, who
all looked about 8 years old, were led by
Mable Ware and Marguerite Kingston.
Next came the maids of honor, dressed
two and two alike, in dainty shades of
white pink and green organdie. They
were: Dacia Fairbanks and Henrietta
Camel, Petaluma; Lena Brash, Clover
dale; Annie McLain, Healdsburg; Sadie
Me Mullen, ISebastopol; Edith Brooks,2
Irma Wood, Carrie Frear, Lillie Hill and
Kate Lewis, Eanta Rosa.
Miss Rose (Â£rooks of San Francisco, the
maid of honor, was gowned in soft poid
colored organdie. Queen Laura moved
Blowiy down the aisle, followed by twelve
picturesque Jittle Hoys," dressed as pages.
Charlie Thompson and Tom Gale held
her sv.eepinp Watteau train of white satin
ana tulle, which was garlanded with pink
roses.
Her corsage, which was cut decollete,
was also trimmed with roses and her large
sleeves were draped with white tulle. Her
Majesty.v.'hoisapretty, jtiquante brunette,
was deliberate and verv dignified in all her
actions. She ascended the platform amid
applause, and Miss Lena Hoag tripped up
the steps of the theater and made a pretty
little coronation speech to Queen Laura,
concluding with "I crown you Queen of
the Roses."
The crown, a gorgeous, glittering thing
of pearls and diamonds, sat as comfortably
on her Majesty's head as if she had been
in the habit of wearing one all her life.
Its rays caught the light and glittered in
quite a regal fashion as she ascended the
throne and settled herself back gracefully
to receive the homage of Mayor Jesse, who
had ji^t appeared on the scene staggering
under the weight of a huge gilt key. The
first thing the Mayor did was to hand this
outwar.l and visible sign of the possession
of Santa Rosa into Queen Laura's keeping,
and as her Majesty took the key the Mayor
Mid:
"Most Gracious Majesty: The moment
has arrived when your many loving sub
jects call for you to ascend the throne
amids-t a wealth of flowers, bedecked
streets and buildings, with the air laden
with sweet perfume and insence to Queen
Flora. Amidst a vast array of beautiful
maidens, fair ladies and gallant men there
is a universal voice saying, 'Let her
Majesty be crowned,' and the wish of the

Scare.
A WARNING TO WEYLER.
Gomez Again Advancing With
a Large Force of Faithful
Followers.
HOT FIGHTING IS EXPECTED.
Several Minor Encasements in Which
the Spanish Forces Are
Routed.
HAVANA, Crux, April 30.â A dynamite
bomb caused the explosion in the captain
geueral's palace Tuesday and not a gas
engine as reported. The noise was tre
mendous and caused intense excitement
in the palace and vicinity. The general
and officers rushed about giving orders.
General Weyler left the room greatly ex
cited. Only one person was hurt and he
slightly. The others escaped miraculously.
The whole palace was shaken by the force
of the explosion. Clouds of dust blinded
all persons inside and many windows were
broken. The bomb destroyed the parti
tion wall of the principal counting-room
and broke two *safes. The bomb was
placed in the watereloset at the southeast
corner of the palace, on Mercedes and
Obispo streets. The occurrence is the
general topic of conversation. It is be
lieved to be the work of laborers. The
police are making diligent search, but no
arrest has been made. Strong measures,
it is said, will be adopted to prevent a
repetition. This happened at 11 a. m.
Gomez's advance is confirmed. It is
now reported he has enterad Matanzas
province with a strong force of 10,000 or
12,000 men, five pieces of artillery and
plenty of ammunition. It is presumed an
attack on the trocha on both sides in com
bination with Maceo will follow, and hot
lighting is expected.
News of a bloody battle near Zanjo,
province of Santiago de Cuba, has been re
ceived. General Munoz tried to prevent
General CaliytO Garcia from crossing the
Canto River. Munoz organized a strong
Jand column and, ordering gunboats up
the river to co-operate, left Munzanillo to
intercept Garcia. The latter, with Rabi's
column, made a junction with the forces
of Maria Rodriguez, from Camazuey. The
combined insurgent forces attacked Munoz
as he was advancing and defeated him.
Munoz lust over 200 killed and 400
wouhded. But for the gunboats Munoz's
column would have been destroyed.
Munoz retreated to Manzanillo, and Gar
cia is now operating witnout opposition.
Colonel Andanaz has- arrived at Holguin.
He reports that his command had two en
gagements with rebe's near Zanjo and
Caibaguan. The insurgents had many

neighboring cune lields. The garrison re
pulsed an attack from the trenches, using
artillery. The troops had two wounded.

That Account of Hit F.ieape Frotn Morro
( n-tit- Branded a fake.
PORTLAND, Or., April 30.â "What's
the sense in publishing snch abominable
bosh as this?" exclaimed Senor Francisco
Sancho this afternoon in the Portland
Hotel loboy, as he handed The Call corre
spondent the morning paper containing an
Associated Press dispatch from Spring
field, 111., headed "Escaped From Morro
Castleâ Interesting story told by Walter 8.
Whitcomb."
"The merest glance at the map of the
slightest bearing upon Morro Castle puts
the stamp of 'fake' on the story, although
there is nothing particularly bad about
that phase of the matter, but the fake is
so outrageously weak that it make one
who knows anything about Cuba and the
condition of affairs there simply exas
perated. In the first place there is no
such port or province on the island as Del
Rio, which translated means the river. In
the second pliÂ»ce, would a pass from An
tonio Maceo be a proper paper with which
to enter Havana, a city occupied by Span
ish troops? Again, thÂ» fellow states that
at night he was confined in the great,
dingy tower, after being placed in Morro.
I was born in Havana and have spent
many pleasant hours playin* about the
weather-beach front of Morro Castle, and
the only tower I ever saw about the fort
was that used as a lighthouse, which is
not higher than the fourth story of one of
the business blocks of Portland, and also is
not fitted with cells, all prisoners being
placed in dungeons of the fortress and in
that portion facing toward Havana.
"But the bribing of the guard and
swinging off into the Gulf of Mexico
to swim to a boat and escape is
the silliest portion of all tha story.
Had the fellow who wrote or told the
yarn but taken the trouble to procure
a photograph of Morro, he could readily
have seen how impossible such an attempt
would be. The only facade of the fort
which ia really swept by the sea id that
fronting directly on the harbor entrance
and at the oase of this wall are sharp,
jasgert rocks whicb even at hieh tide are
not wholly covered. To attempt to clam
ber over these to deep water would mean
to be shot through and through from the
rifles of a dozen sentinels in'the parapet
above. On the weather and landward
sides are Bandy boaches patrolled day and
night by soldiers. If this fellow Whit
comb would only tell how he managed to
drop into the 'Gulf of Mexico,' as he calls
that part of the Atlantic Ocean which
sweeps into Havana harbor, he would con
fer a favor on many Cubans who have
friends and relatives now confined within
the walls ol the fort."
Charges of Conspiring Against Baker and
Hill to Be Investigated by the
Grand Jury,
CHICAGO, III., April 30. âOn complaint
of William Skakel, tbe "bucket-shop king"
of Chicago, the Grand Jury to-day decided
to investigate charges of conspiracy pre
ferred by him against President William
T. Baker of the Board of Trade and Civic
Federation; John Hill Jr., chairman of
the bucket-shop prosecuting committee
of the Board of Trade; Thomas Candy, a
civic federation detective who obtained
evidence against the raided bucket-shops
and others. The alleged conspiracy is in
connection with the procuring of Justice
Court warrants on which the successive
raias were made by the police. The Grand
Jury did not return a bill to-day in the
new cases against SKakel, which have been
considered for two days. The investiga
tion of the Board of Trade officials was
taken independently of the State's Attor
ney, who repudiates tbe Skakel complaint,
although aadressed to him.
Tells of His Peculiar Experien
ces in the Prison at
Cincinnati.
With Boyish Simplicity He Tries to
Fasten Pearl Bryan's Murder
Upon Another.
CINCINNATI, Onio, April 30.â When
court opened in the Jackson trial this
morning Attorney Crawford asked for the
letters written by Jackson. When they
were produced Crawford passed them to
the prisoner, who read them seemingly
with great care. After he had finished be
took the stand. He detailed his life up to
the time he first met Peari iiryan, which
was during the holidays of 1894. He re
ferred to the conversation he had with
Wood at various times on the subject 01
Pearl Bryan's, condition. He s&id Wood
was very much concerned about her, and
if something was not done soon he said he
would have to leave town.
Jackson said the last time he saw Pearl
alive was the Wednesday before her body
was discovered. He says it was on Tues
day night that ha was with her at Wal
hngford's saloon.
Jackson detailed minutely all the cir
cumstances in connection with his move
ments lor the three days immediately pre
ceding and those immediately following
the murder. He fixed the hours of his
meals, his arising in the mornings and his
reiiripg at night with exactness. Skil
fully and witu wonderful tact and cunning
he told, wiLh the simplicity of a boy, be ii
feigned or genuine, oi all the damaging
evidence against his own character, while
the entire drift of his testimony was 10
make Woods the betrayer of the girl and
Walling the supposed and only man di
rectly concerned in her death.
The sensation of the afternoon proceed
ings was in that part of Jackson's testi
mony relating to his prison experience.
On this point his counsel drew him out
fully.
Some of his statements were highly sen
sational. Alluding to his experiences in
Cincinnati, he said that before his removal
to Kentucky Chief of Police Dietsch came
to him alone and said to him that a re
moval to Kentucky most probably meant
ueatii as soon as he reached Kentucky
soil. He said after Colonel Dietscli had
worked on his fears he pulled out his
watch and said: "Now, Jackson, I'll jiive
you rive minutes to tell about this murder
and tell me where the neaJ is." Jackson
says that Dietsch paced up and down the
flour for some time with hia watch open,
but not being able to get a confession from
him lei't.
Colonel Nelsou announced that the
prosecution wouid not cross-examine
Jackson.
Relief Refused the Southern Pa
cific in the Matter of
Reduced Rates.
Western Trunk Lines Protest Against
the Encroachment of Terri-
torial Rights.
CHICAGO, IliÂ», April 30.â The chair
man of the Transcontinental Passenger
Association to-day refused relief to tbe
Southern Pacific in tbe matter of making
reduced rates to tbe convention of the
American Society of Civil Engineers to be
held in San Francisco next July. The
competitors of the Southern Pacific voted
against making any reduction in rates, al
though the Canadian Pacitic is reported to
have offered concessions, lhe Southern
Pacific will probably give notice of inde
pendent action.
The Northwestern gave notice to-day
that it would make the same rates from
ti.t* Atlantic seaboard to Australia via
San Francisco as the Canadian Pacitic
make via Vancouver.
At tbe request of the Northwestern a
proposition to remove trans-Pacific busi
ness irum the Western PassengT Associa
tion agreement haa beeu submitted to a
vote.
Western trunk lines are protesting
against what is considered an arrogant en
croachment of territorial rights on the
part of the board of manaeers of the Joint
IraUic Association in relation to the issue
of joint rate sheets. Although a Western
or transcontinental road wants to reduce
rates on its line and pay the Eastern con
nection it!- full proportion of the through
rate the Eastern magnates nave decided
that Mich rate sheets cannot be issued
without the approval of the board of man
agers. The compiler! of the Missouri
Kiver, Kansas City and Illinois rate sheets
have already been taken to task in this re
spect, but the Illinois official has entered a
vigorous protest against such interference.
A number of roads will not comply with
the demands.
NEW YORK, N. Y., April 30.â James

Premier Meline Makes a
Statement to the
Deputies.
RECEIVED VERY COLDLY
Interrupted by a Radical Who
Declares the Constitution
Is Violated.
THIS CAUSES A BIG TUMULT.
Various and Needed Reforms Are
Promised by the New
Ministry.
PARIS, France, April 30.â M. Meline,
President of the new Council of Ministers,
made a statement of the policy of the new
Cabinet in the Chamber of Deputies to
day. The Chamber received tue state
ment very coldly, scarcely half of the Dep
uties applauding his utterances, and the
Socialists interposing their accustomed in
terruptions.
In the Senate the Ministerial declaration
waa read by M. Darlun, Minister of
of Justice. As he was beginning the state
ment M. Girault, Republican Radical,
shouted: "It is useless to read it; the
Cabinet is unconstitutional."
A tumult ensued, but after it subsided
M. Darian proceeded with his reading and
at the conclusion he was applauded.
In his statement M. Meline made an
appeal for reciprocal goodwill toward the
Ministry on the part of the Chambers,
which, he said, would solve and settle all
discords. He placed the fiscal reforms
before the Chamber as matters of the first
importance. The probate laws and the
laws regulating the traffic in drink, be
saiil, would be introduced in the
budget and would be operated under a
system which dispensed with an inquisitor
or any other arbitrary measures, and
assured a better division of the direct
taxation, thus relieving small taxpayers.
The Government, he said, would vigilantly
apply the economies which the nation
demands and simplify the present com
plicated administration. They would also
spare no effort to aid the interests of agri
culture, to complete the national defense,
to regulate the hours of labor and the
liability of employers and to organize pen
sion funds.
M. Goblet, Republican Radical Socialist,
offered an interpellation, saying that un
der the circumstances of its formation the
Cabinet had violated parliamentary rules.
The Cabinet, he declared, did not repre
sent the Republican majority of the
Chamber. It was the result of a plot
formed by the Moderates, who, in order to
give the country such a Ministry, had pro
voked a conflict Jjet ween the Senate and
the Chamber of iVputifes. The Premier,
he said, must render an account of his vio
lation of the constitution. The programme
of the Cabinet was contrary to the de
mands of a majority of the Chamber, as it
rejected the income tax. It was in fact, a
ministry in defiance of the majority of the
Chamber.
M. Descbanet, Republican, said univer
sal suffrage w:is. certainly supreme, but to
declare that the Chamber of Deputies was
omnipotent and the Senate powerless was
a negation of the sovereignty of the people.
The Bourgeois Cabinet, he said, had for
five months exercised upon the Chamber a
sort of moral blackmail.
'Ihe president, M. Brisson, interrupted
the speaker and demanded that he with
draw his expression in regard to tho late
Ministry.
M. Deschenet modified the expression
by substituting the words "outside the
Chamber" for "urpon the Chamber," and
continued, saying that during his term of
office as president of the Council of
Ministers M. Bourgeois had not executed
â  single reform, but had merely propagated
collectivist doctrines.
Ex-Premier Bourgeois maintained that
either dissolution of the Chamber or re
vision of the constitution was the only
proper solution of the situation.
Premier Meline replied that the Cham
ber must now choose between a policy of
the conflict with the Senate or a policy of
conciliation.
The Chamber, by a vote of 279 to 251,
refused to give prior' tv to the proposal of
M. Henri Ricard, reaffirming the Cham
ber's right to preponderance in the repre
sentation of the principle of universal suf
frage.
The Chamber then adopted a resolution,
which received 660 affirmative votes,
affirming the sovereignty of universal suf
frage.
The Chamber, by a vote of 531 to 196.
approved M. Meline's declaration, and
then adjourned until May 28.

Generous Action of the Chicago Mineral

CHICAGO, III., April 30.â At a special

One of the Murderers of the
Meeks Family Pays the
Death Penalty.
With His Brother George, Who
Recently Escaped, He Committed
a Fearful Crime.
CARROLLTON, Mo., April 30.â Bill
Taylor wa^ hanged here to-day. At ten
minutes to 11 Father Kennedy placed a
crucifix in Taylor's hands and the march
to the scaffold began, Taylor walking with
a firm step. His nerve never deserted h ini
after ascending the scaffold.
Taylor's legs were then pinioned, he
kissed the crucifix held by the priest,
Sheriff Allen waived a white handkerchief,
the trap was sprung noiselessly and Tay
lor dropped. His neck was broken, and
the body hung motionless. In ten minutes
he was declared dead and the body was
cut down.
Old Mrs. Meeks had forced her way into
the jailyard with her blind son George,
and was an interested spsctator. Five
thousand people surged about the inclos
ure surrounding the jail, but there was no
disorder.
The crime for which Taylor was hanged
was the murder, on the night of May 11,
1894, of Gus Meeks, his wife ar. 1 two little
cnildren. George, Bill's brother, was to
have Deen hanged with Bill, but he es
caped from jail and has not yet been cap
tured. On the night of the murder the
two brotners called at the Meeks home
and induced Mr. Meeks to leave for an
other part of the country, promising to
assist him. The Meeks family started
away that night in a wagon, with all their
belongings. Next morning the dead
bodies of four of the family were found
under a haysiack on George Taylor's
farm. The sole survivor, a girl aged seven,
gave the alarm and posses were organ
ized to capture the Taylor brothers. It
was several weens before thuy were appre
hended.
The first trial resulted in a disagreement
by the jury; but on August 3 the jury in
the second trial, after being out a few min
utes, found the prisoners guilty, and Judge
Rucker sentenced them to be hanged. The
case was appealed, but the lower court was
sustained. Pending the carrying out of
the sentence tne two brothers escaped, but
Bill was captured. The Supreme Court of
the United States refused an appeal for a
stay of proceedings. Governor Stone also
refused a like appeal, and the execution of
to-day followed.
Bill Taylor was a lawyer and banker in
Lynn County. He had a bad reputation,
but held his place in society by reason of
his wealth. He had been arrested on
several charges, the latest "beinz stealing
cattle. Gus Meeks, tue murdered man,
was an accomplice in this crime and was
the principal witness against Taylor, which
was probably the reason for the quadruple
murder.
letuptrane- Women Have at Last Called
In Their Petition.
CHICAGO, III., April 30.â There is con
siderable jubilation among the members
of the various branches of the National
Keeley League over the report that the
Women's Christian Temperance Union
has abandoned its advocacy of the Eujflish
scheme of imprisoning inebriates in State
institutions. Petitions in favor of this
project have been scattered throughout
the country by the department of legisla
tion of the union, of which Mrs. N. B.
Ellis of New Jersey is National superin
tendent, and the Legislature of every
State that has held a session since tne be
ginning of the year has been petitioned to
enact laws imprisoning drunkards from
one to two years as a measure of reform.
The Keejeyites have made a vigorous
fight against the iaea and have, so it is
claimed, aroused public sentiment on the
subject to such a pitch that the depart
ment of legislation of the Women's Lnion
has decided to call in its petition and al
low the issue to go by the board.

to increase the number of battle-ships
from four to six. Gorman's amendment
to reduce the number to two was the
proposition before the Senate when it met
and remained so when it adjourned.
Speeches were made by White of Cali
fornia, in favor of coast defenses rather
than of an increased navy; by Allen of
Nebraska, predicting the collapse of the
Democratic and Republican parties â the
former within three months and the latter
by the 4th of March, 1901, and by Gorman
of Maryland in enforcement of his views
as to the necessity of that economy in ap
propriations.
Immediately after the routine business
the naval appropriation bill was taken up,
the pending question being the amend
ment offered by Gorman (D.) of Maryland
reducing the number of Sattle-ships pro
vided for in the bill from four to two, and
the addition to that amendment offered
by Quay (R.) of Pennsylvania to increase
the number to six.
White (D.) of California, while declaring
himself ia favor of an effective navy,
argued as to the greater necessity for
coast defenses, particularly on the Pacific
Coast. He quoted statements of Generals
Miles and Craighill and of Admiral Walker
in support of his argument.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska spoke of the
interest which he had felt in the debate of
the last two days and which he said dis
closed to the country the fact that the
issue to be made in the approaching Presi
dential campaign was the issue of tariff,
rather than the issue of financial reform.
The financial condition of the treasury
would not warrant an appropriation for
four battle-ships unless there was an over
shadowing necessity for the Nation to
prepare for some contemplated war. In
the course of a lone speech Allen asserted
that the McKinley act had not produced
sufficient revenue, and he declared Mia
belief, if the Harrison administration had
remained in power, it would have issued
United States bonds before the 1st of April,
1893. He remarked that rumor had it that
Secretary Foster would have profited
largely by their issue.
Piatt (R.) of Connecticut asked Allen to
give his authority for that statement.
Allen naid that he made no such state
ment, he merely mentioned it as a rumor.
He had read at the time in the press dis
patches that Mr. Foster was to make two
and a half million dollars out of that
transaction.
In the course of a long speech, Allen pre
dicted the disruption of the Democratic
and Republican parties and the uniting of
the people under the banner of Populism
(or some other, like name), having for its
| motto, "A Government by the people, for
I the people and of the people."
At the closo of Allen's speech (at 4 p. M.),
the question was stated to be on Quay's
amendment to Gorman's amendment in
creasing the number of battle-ships to six.
A point of order was raised by Gorman
against Quay's amendment, that it in
creases the approDriation without an esti
mate, and the point was sustained.
Remarks favoring the bill for four battle
ships were maae by Call (D.)of Florida
and Bacon (D.) of Georgia, the latter giv
ing as a reason for his position the fact
that there was now a surplus in the treas
ury.
Gorman contradicted that statement
and showed that the surplus in the
treasury was more than covered by appro
priations made oy Congress, but not ex
pended.
"Every Senator knows," he said, "that
it will take every dollar now in the
treasury to meet current expenses and
these extraordinary appropriations, and
then will occurâ before December next, in
my judgmentâ precisely what occurred
last year. The moment the treasury has
not a working balance the money sharks
will make another raid on the treasury
go'd. It will be run down below the
$100,000,000 limit, and then will follow the
sale of bonds again."
Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire said
he would be willing to see Gorman's
amendment adopted if an appropriation
were made for torpedo-boat destroyers
and torpedo-boats. The reduction of
battle-ships to two would bo a saving of
from ten to twelve millions. He there
fore gave notice of an amendment appro
priating $4,500,000 for thirty torpedo
boats and torpedo-boat destroyers.
The bill went over without acrion.
Hale stated that if it was not passed at 6
o'clock to-morrow he would ask then for
an executive session.
House bill increasing the pension of
William Grose of Newcastle, Ind., briga
dier-general of volunteers, to ?100 a month
was passed with an amendment making
the pension $75.
The Senate at 6 p. m. adjourned until to
morrow.
Three Contested Election Cases Are I)ia-
posed Of.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 30.â The
House to-day disposed of the three con
tested election cases from Mississippi by
adopting the resolutions reported from
the Elections Committee confirming the
tittle of the sitting members, Allen, Wil
liams and Spencer, Democrats, to their
seats. The contestants in these cases
based their claims for the seats upon an
alleged violation of the Federal law regu
lating the representation of Mississippi in
Congress by the constitution of that State.
The committee declined to make a declara
tion upon that question.
A bill was passed increasing the pen
sion of General William Grose 01 Indiana
from $20 to $75 a montb. Five hours were
then devoted to a further discussion of the
bankruptcy bill, the general debate clos
ing with to-day's session. The principal
speakers were De Armond (D.) of Mis
souri, Tawney (R.) of Minnesota, and
Bailey (D.) of Texas, against the bill, and
Burton (R.) of Missouri, Culberson (D.) of
Texas, and Ray (K.) of New York, in fa
vor of the bill. The latter two admitted
their conversion from an attitude of
opposition to a bill containing the invol
untary feature. The discussion developed
the fact that the House was practically
unanimous in favor of a bill providing for
voluntary bankruptcy â the difference in
opinion was as to the incorporation of the
involuntary feature.
The letter of Governor Upham of Wis
consin, offering to Congress the statue of
Father Marquette on behalf of the S*ate ol
Wisconsin, was referred to the Committee
on Library.

Delegates Instructed to Present

Statesman.
GREAT WAVE OF ENTHUSIASM
Strangers Shake Hands, Friends Em
brace and Women Hug and
Exchange Kisses.
BPRINHFIELD, III., April 30.â The op
ponents of Governor McKinley'a Presiden
tial aspirations capitulated to-day before a
terrific onslaught of the friends of the
Ohio statesman. By a majority of 329 in a
total vote of 1335â a majority as unex
pected to the supporters of the Ohioan as
it was staggering to Senator Ctillom and
his friendsâ the Republican State Conven
tion instructed the four delegates-at-large
from Illinois to the St. Louis convention
not merely to vote for and support the
Ohio candidate, but actually to present his
name to tiiat body as the candidate and
choice of Illinois for the .Presidential nomi
nation.
It is true the form in which the resolu
tion was adopted â the substitution of Me-
Kinley's name in the Cuilom resolutionâ
waa due to the over zeal of a delegate who
anticipated the regular JtcKinley indorse
ment which was to have been presented by
the spokesman of hi^ following, but in the
enthusiasm and uproar that attended the
contest between the two factions this point
was lost to consideration, and as a result,
by the record as it stands, the Illinois dele
gation to St. Louis may, should it see fit to
carry out its instructions to the letter,
claim a share with tne Buckeyes in pre
senting to the convention the favorite ton
of Oiiio.
That the outcome was a crushing defeat
for Senator Culiora and the Chicago ele
ment that for years has held the Repub
lican party fast i;i its iron grip, is con
ceded alike by vanquished and victors,
and the result will be to make the coun
try Republicans for years to come more
]><>ter.t than heretofore in the councils of
the party. All that j<ood per.eralsbip, in
fluence and trading of votes for the va
rious candidates on the Hrate ticket could
do was done by the defeated faction to de
. iree expression of the McKinley ele
ment. It captured the committees and
dictated the principal nominations and up
to within an hour of the crucial test even
the McKinleyitea wore almost willing to
con ftss that their fight had been a losing
one. The turning point came when a can
didate for Auditor, who was especially
championed by an anti-Catholic organiza
tion and to whom the machine had
pledged its lull support, was defeated by a
Limed veteran of the war by less than
a baker's dozen of votes. The sentiment
attached to the old blue uniform had
more to do with the result than any other
consideration, but the friends ot the de
feated candidate, and they ran up into the
hundreds, charged treachery upon the
machine.
From the moment the result of the bal
lot was declared it was evident the oppo
sition had lost its grip, and when the op
portune moment arrived not only did the
delegates who had received instructions or
indorsements stand to their guns, but the
unlnstructed brigades poured broadside
after broadside into the anti-McKinley
ranks.
Before the last county had recorded its
vote the majority of the opposition was
tumbling over itself in its eagerness to se
cure seat3 in the band-wagon, and before
the clerks had been given time to foot
the figures for an official: announcement
the chosen country champions of Senator
Culloin and the leader of the Chicago fac
tion were shouting against each other to
securt the substitution of the name of Me-
Kinley for that of Cullom and to advocate
toe adoption by acclamation of the resolu
tion as amended. Three of the proposed
deleprates-at-large whose names were to
have gone on the anti-instructions ticket,
Nixon and Patterson of Chicago and ex-
Governor Fifer, will go to St. Louis under
the new conditions, while keeping their
company will be the especial net and pride
of the country McKinleyites, the vener
able "Uncle Dick" Oglesby.
To-night with bands and bann?r?, glee
clubs, torches, red tire and songs of tri
umph, the visitors had undisputed pos
session of the capital city.
Chairman Berry called the impatient
delegates to order at 9:45 o'clock. To pre
vent a repetition of the demonstration of
yesterday, when the galleries created pan
demonium whenever a McKinley cham
pion made himself conspicuous, the issue
of general admission tickets for the second
day had been restricted one-half.
Nominations for Secretary of State were
called for. Speeches were barred. Five
candidates were named â John A. Reeves
of Decatur, George C. Kankin of Mori
mouth, James A. Kose of Golconda, Isaac
>'. Pearson of Macomb and Homer j. Tice
of Greenview. Rose was nominated on
the third ballot.
The following candidates for Auditor
â were placed in nomination: C. J. Kinney
of Winnebago County, J. EL McCullough
of Champaign County, Thomas B. Needles
01 Washington County and N. B. Thistie
wood of Alexander County. After the
liist ballot Needles and Thistlewood with
drew and Mr. McCullough was nominated
on the second ballot.
Nominations for Treasurer were than in
order and. the claims of Henry L. Hertz of
Chicago, Dr. George A. Sellars of Peoria,
Charles Fetzer of Springfield and Mayor
Albert F. Schoch of Ottawa were presented.

Just as soon as ti:e attorney-generalship
had been disposed of the decks were cleared
for the resolution on instructions. -The
chair insisted on absolute order and the
sergeant-at-arma compelled order and all
on the floor to be seated. This accom
plished. Senator Fuller of Belvedere
mounted a chair in the center of the Chi
cago delegation and submitted a resolution
iufiiruciirig the delegates at large to be
selected to present to the National Re
publican Convention the name of Shelby
M. Cullom as the choice of Illinois for the
Presidency. The cheering with which this
was greeted was confined almost entirely
to the left wing of the hall, the Chicago
men getting up on chairs, waving hats and
handkerchiefs and yelling frantically for
"Cullom and victory."
When the resolution had been read a
second time by the clerk there was a
cyclone of "noes," hisses and groans.
â With considerable heat the chair appealed
for order, declaring that he would keep
the convention in session all night unless
he could secure sufficient order to enable
each side to have a fair and honest hear
ing. This had its effect and Senator Fuller
forced his way through the crowd to the I
platform, where he made a short Bpeech. I
The speaker concluded somewhat abruptly.
He had scarcely turned his back when
Delegate S. H. Bethea of Dixon, anticipa
ting Speaker Calnoun, jumped upon a
ohair and moved to substitute the name of
McKiniey for that of Cullom in the resolu
tion. The demonstration that greeted the
mention of McKiniey was terrific. Two
thirds of the convention and the thousands
in the gallery rose en masse and cheered
for three consecutive minutes and the
tempest was repeated when the chair re
peated theÂ°amendment.
Speaser Calhoun was then recognized
and eulogized McKiniey, and ex- Attorney -
General Hunt made a brief speech in
behalf of the Ohio man. The shouts of
"vote," however, rendered his utterances
almost inaudible, and then Senator Fuller
closed the debate with a final plea for Cul
lom.
At this juncture Delegate Messick of
East St. Louis moved that the instruc
tions for both Cullom and McKiniey be
tabled. This was met with a storm of dis
approval, and Calhoun made the point of
order that under the resolution adopted
yesterday a direct vote should be taken
without evasion or subterfuge. But the
chair ruled against him and accepted the
situation.
A ballot was ordered on the motion to
table, and this time there was no necessity
for an appeal for order from the chair.
Delegates and spectators alike kept tab,
and the silence was only broken by the
cheers that greeted the heavy McKiniey
votes from uninstructed delegations. Cook
County gave the Ohioan 82 votes, or about
half of what had been anticipated, but the
country district, immediately lollowmg
rolled up their tens and scores and hun
dreds against the senior Senator from
Illinois.
Here and there a delegation that was in
structed for McKiniey gave a solitary vote
the other way, but in the overwhelming
majority the instructions were respected
and indorsements regarded as just as good
as instructions. The only notable viola
tion was that of this (Sangamon) county,
the twenty delegates from which, in sDite
of McKiniey instructions, voted solidly
for their fellow-townsman, Senator Cullom.
When Stephenson County had been
passed, with fifteen counties still to hear
fronu the motion to table was defeated by
ten majority. .There was an attempt to
renew the. enthusiasm of '.. a few moments
before, but the delegates wanted the full
vote, and it was not until Woodford, the
last county, on the list, had been called
that the pent-up feeling broke loose. Then
the convention wenti.nto hysterics. Cheer
after cheer followed and banners and
lithographs of Ohio's ex-Governor were
waved in a dozen parts of. the hall.
Tiie footing of the convention, secretaries,
gave the result as 834 against tabling the
instructions to 502 in favor, a majority of
329, but before the vote could be announced '
Senator Fuller was on his chair to move
that in t.he resolution which he had pre
sented the name of William McKiuley be
substituted for that of Shelby M. Cullom.
This capitulation of the opposition again
let loose the enthusiasm and it swelled
into a cyclone when Alderman Madden, on
behalf of the Cook County machine, fol
lowed suit with a motion that the substitu
tion of McKinley's name be made by ac
clamation. The compact was sealed with
a mighty shout and then for ten minutes
the victorious element gave itself up to a
general jubilation. Men who had never
met before shook hands like old acquain
tances, frienas embraced friends, and the
women on the platform kissed and hugged
each other. But the defeated Chicago men
took, the situation hard. They sat glum
and morose and refused the invitation of
the victors to make the best of it and join
with good grace in the jollification.
Presently they ' had a small revenge.
The report of the committee appointed
yesterday to name delegates at large, and
which had been made up in Cullom 's in
terest, was presented. It named William
Pen n Nixon of the Chicago Inter Ocean,
R. W. Patterson of the Tribune, ex-Gov
ernor Fifer of Bloomington and David T.
Littler of Springfield.
The McKiniey majority of the Chicago
Three Hundred wanted Mayor George B.
Swift substituted for William Penn Nixon
and another tedious rollcall was in order.
Two hundred and fifty Chicagoans voted
against the Mayor, and, aided Dy Mr. Nix
on's large personal following in the county
delegations, succeeded in defeating Swift
by a majority of 105â720 to 615.
It was now after 7. o'clock. The great
building was in darkness save a few
spluttering are lights that only served to
intensify the gloom. The convention had
been in continuous sesr.ion for over ten
hours, but the delegates were not inclined
to maKe another day of it. Littler with
drew his name for elector and the Mc-
Kinleyites chose the venerable ex-Gov
ernor Oglesby in his stead. Patterson and
Fifer were acceptable to them, and their
names went through with a rush.
A couple of colored delegates got the
floor at this juncture to make a plea for
the recognition of their race on the list of
National alternates, and their oratorv
made so good an impression that W. Cha
vis of Adams County, a colored Republi
can leader, was elected in the place of
Georere W. Perkins of Pope, one of the
nominees of the committee.
The other names in its report, J. W. Ells
worth and Charles M. Pepper of Chicago
and Senator P. T. Chapman of Vienna,
were unanimously confirmed, and General
Horace Clark of Mattoon and Kabbi PZmil
Hirsch of Chicago were selected as electors
at large. Amid considerable confusion
Chariman James H. Gilbert read the re
port of the committee on resolutions and it
was perfunctorily adopted.
The features of the platform are em
bodied in tie following synopsis:
The present administration of Grover Cleve
land, by bad administration of good Republi
can laws and the enactment of bad Democratic
laws, has demonstrated that the Democratic
party is constitutionally incapable of manag
ing the affairs of this great nation.
The Republicans of Illinois are unyielding
and. emphatic in their demand '. for honest
money. We are opposed, as we ever have been,
to any and every scheme that will give to this
country a currency in any way depreciated or
debased, or in any respect inferior to the
money of the most advrnced and intelligent
nations of the earth. We favor the use of sil
ver as currency, but to the extent only and
under such restrictions that parity with gold
can be maintained.
The Republican . party from the time of
Lincoln has been \ devoted irrevocably to the
doctrine of protection to home industries, and
we hereby renew and reaffirm our faith in this
fundamental principle. We believe in a tariff
that will produce a revenue sufficient to meet
tbe wants of trie Government honestly and
economically administered and high enough
to insure to home labor regular and remunera
tive employment. We believe in reciprocityâ
the reciprocity of James G. Blaineâ re-enforced
by experience and an earnest wish to extend
our foreign commerce to the fullest extent
consistent with the control of our own markets
in the sale of articles that can be profitably
produced at home.
We believe in the exercise of a genuine
American spirit in all our intercourse with
foreign nations and are opposed to the exten
sion of monarchical institutions upon any
part of American soil; we condemn the vacil
lating and un-American policy of the present
Democratic administration and advocate a
firm, vigorous and dignified policy toward all
nations. And to that end we recommend the
further strengthening of our coast defenses
and such an enlargement of our navy as shall
command the respect of other governments
and will more effectually promote our peace
ful relations with all the world. We believe
that the sympathy of this Nation should be
extended to all peoples who have been driven
by oppression and wrong to take up arms in
behalf of self-government, and wo therefore
express our sympathy for the people of Cuba
in their struggle for independence.
The exact wording of the resolution of
instruction as adopted oy acclamation is
thus recorded by the official stenographer
of the convention :
Kcsolvcd, That the delegates to be elected by
this convention to the Republican National
Convention be and are hereby instructed to pre-
Bant to said National Convention the name of
the Hon. William McKinley of Ohio.
After the selection of three trustees of
the 8tate University the convention ad
journed sine die.
merce, growing out of the appropriation
of a little moie than $3,000,000 for the im
provement of Santa Monica harbor, Cali
fornia, will be carried into the Senate, Mr.
White of California having prepared a
minority report for that purpose.
Mr. "White contends that his appropria
tion was not placed in the bill at the sug
gestion of either of the California Senators
or at the instigation of the member of
Congress from the district in which Santa
Monica is situated. He strenuously con
tends that all these members of Congress
were opposed to It, and that the over
whelming sentiment of the people of Cali
fornia is in the same direction. Officials
of the Government, he says, charged with
the management of harbor improvements
have uniformly and unanimously re
ported against the breakwater proposed to
be constructed at that point.
Other reasons given are that the action
of the committee establishes a dangerous
precedent, as it disregards the carefully
formed opinions of the board of engineers ;
the location of this extensive work is arbi
trary,and is at a point demanded by private
I interests only; its ultimate success is but
problematical ; the proper site for a harbor
is at Si'.n Pedro and not Santa Monica; if
there be a doubt a committee should in
quire into the subject as bet-ween the con
tending sites and a contract should be
made only on a full report.
Mr. "White further refers to the desires
of the Southern Pacific for the location
agreed upon by the majority, ana attrib
1 utes it to the fact that at that point the
' road has no rival, while at San Pedro it
, has competition. "No doubt," Bays Mr.
White, "the wharf at Santa Monica would
never have been built if the owners of the
structure did not feel themselves able to
overthrow the report of the engineers and
overcome local desires. Had it been sup
posed that the Government would make a
deep-sea harbor at San Pedro the venture
would not have been made."
1'rctidcnt Cleveland Itoes yot Approve of
the Appropriations.
WASHINGTON. D. C, April 30. -The
river and harbor bill will probably come
up for consideration in the Senate to
morrow afternoon after the naval bill is
disposed of. The bill will be vetoed by
President Cleveland without doubt. He
has been carefully reading the reports of
boards of United States engineers recom
mending San Pedro for the deep harDor
site, but whether he will make the Santa
Monica appropriation the basis for his
veto is, of course, only a matter of con
jecture. It is known that he objects to an
outright appropriation of $10,000,000 car
ried by the bill, in view of the low p. ate of
finances of the Nation, and opposps tbe
ultimate expenditure of $<J0,000 ,000 addi
tional (under the continuous contract
system), which future Congresses will
have to provide for; but those who have
talked with him lately believe that he
will also have something to say about the
Santa Monica job.
Senator Frye, chairman of the Commerce
Committee, which reported the river and
Harbor bill, said to The Call correspond
ent to nigbt: "Yes, I have heard it ru
mored that the President intended to veto
the biil, and I believe that he will do so."
Senator Perking of California says the
bill will undoubtedly pass over his veto,
however, as two-thirds of the members of
both houses have enough "pork" in the
barrel to insure their votes. Mr. Perkins
said: "I shall certainly stand by ray col
league, Mr. White, in his fight against
Saata Monica, but if the Senate should
refuse to eliminate this paragraphâ and
the bill goes to the President and is vetoed
by him â I will vote to override the veto,
for although the Santa Monica appropria
tion is objectionable, there are so many
features in the bill of vast benefit to Cali
fornia that I would not feel justified in
voting against the bill in its entirety."
If the bill comes up in the Senate to
morrow Senators White and Perkins will
both speak against the Santa Monica ap
propriation. Senator White's speech wili
follow the lines of his minority report.
W. C. Patterson, president of the Los
Angeles Board of Trade, said to The Call
correspondent to-nisut:
"I consider Senator White's minority
report the most forcible and comprehen
sive statement of the harbor situation
which has yet been made. It is dignitied
and yet pungent and scathing. It bristles
with statements of fact which cannot be
controverted, and which should be over
whelmingly convincing to any unbought
and unpurchasable mind. Since observ
ing for two weeks the methods which are
being used to defeat the project of a deep
water harbor at San Pedro, and having
been told that the only hope of securing
anything is by joining a combination with
G. P. Huntingto-n and yielding to his de
sires I have modified my previous conserva
tism. I have reached the deliberate con
clusion that the people of Los Angeles had
infinitely better receive no appropriation
at all for a deep-sea harbor than to sur
render their sell-respect by bowing at the
shrine of King boodle and becoming his
craven beneliciaries. If this be treason,
make the best of it."

THE FLOWER SHOW EXERCISES.
Germania Hall Crowdedâ Many Visit
ors From All Over the Country.
The Baseball Game.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., April 30.â San
Mateo County's floral revels are now fairly
on, and these are Redwood City's gala
days. The Queen of the carnival of roses
was crowned last night; necessarily, there
fore, Redwood City awoke at a later hour
this morning.
Now that the coronation ceremonies
and ball are things of the glorious past,
people realize how great the success really
was and what a dazzling spectacle they
witnessed.
This afternoonâ a little late, because the
decoration committee's work was delayed
a little â the great flower .thow opened in
Germania Hall, and this evening the for
mal opeuing exercises were held. The
hall itself was beautifully decorated with
foliage and blossoms, roses and evergreens
predominating, though there was lots of
line ferns and some wild flowers. The
front of the stage was covered with gar
landa of pink roses and green foliage, and
in the center of the hall was a hiirh tower,
built of ferns and trimmed with roses.
One could scarcely mention in detail all
the exceptionally pretty features of the
fair of roses, but some of the special ex
hibits really demand notice. One of these
is Mrs. J. B. iN'hroeder's table, near the
entrance to the hall. On a large semi
circular table, covered with a Nile green
cloth, are a wonderful profusion of sweet
peas and roses. The sweet peas predomi
nate. They are of many varieties, giving
an exquisite perfume, and of monster size.
Mrs. Schroeder has also a smaller table,
showing oranges which were grown at her
home at Bay Kulge.
Another feature of the fair ia the corner
table of Sirs. James A. Robinson of Red
wood City. Behind it is a lattice-work
niece filled with red roses, and on the
tables in front are big roses in vases â
altogether a collection that would make
its owner rich if it could be transported to
New York by some magician's wand.
Indeed, a stranger from the East would
think Koine magic alone could produce
all this profusion of blossoms in April,
and, of course, he would be quite right in
his guess. There is a deal of magic in it
all â the magic performed by Dame Nature
for her favored sons and daiif/uters of the
Santa Clara Valley â a magic beyond the
wildest dreams of Kabauli-t or M ahiit :na.
Mrs. George C. Jloss' collection is quite
unique in its way, even for San Maieo
County. All her flowers arc watched and
nursed by her own sympathetic hand, and
she has red roses as bi^ as a football, Paul
Neyrou roses and callas as high as the
tallest man. Mrs. Ross' place is at Wood
neath, Belmont. She has two large tables
at the fair. One of these is devoted almost
entirely to the beautiful pelargoniums; the
other table groans under a burden of
Shirley poppies, snapdragons, sweet peas,
maidenhair ferns.
Just above Mrs. Ross' tables is the
Queen's dais, upon which the throne rests
in a perfect fairy's bower of roses and
delicate greiT) thinps. All in all the deco
rations of the hall are very beautiful.
Flowers abound lavishly and in exotic
abundance. The whole hall is a fairy dell,
from which one hesitates to depart and
regrets that it cannot be photographed in
its existing colors. Some of the other
notable features of the fair, together with
the names ot their lady patronesses, aro as
follows:

Queen Lillian and her maids of honor
held high court at Germania Hall this
evenine. J. J. Bullock was the Prime Min
ister for the time being, and presided over
the exercises. These began with a very
neat little speech by Mr. Bullock, in which
he announced the formal opening of the
San Mateo County tloral festival, after
which he introduced as the orator of the
evening A. J. Thatcher of this city. Col
onel E. F. Preston was to have delivered
the address of -he evening, but at the last
moment his law business called him to
Stockton. So Mr. Thatcher was induced
to perform the important function. He
congratulated the Free Kindergarten As
sociation upon the splendid success that
so far had attended their efforts, and also
congratulated San Mateo County st large
upon the success of this its tirst carnival
season, and upon the enthusiasm and un
selfishness with which everybody seemed
to have entered into the spirit of the oc
casion.
Mr. Thatcher spoke of the eeneral bene
fit of floral festivals in this State. They
not onlv helped greatly to advertise Cali
fornia in the East, but they served as oc
casions of healthful outings lor the people
at large, induced many people of the city
to get out into the country and enjoy na
ture's own beauty and freshness. The
festival also did much toward bringing out
the true spirit of mutual help among
neighbors, and the desire to work together
harmoniously for a common good. San
Mateo County would be immensely bene
fited by the present festival, he felt as
sured, and this would be but the begin
ning of many future successful floral carni
vals.
Mr. Thatcher's address was succeeded by

Among the noticeable private decora
tions in Redwood City is one of the big
show windows of Einstein & Small, the
dry-goods merchants, on Main street, next
to The Call oilice. There is a very taste
ful display of plants, grasses and flowers
here that attracts a good deal of attention
from the visitors, and is an additional
pride of Redwood City.
Across the street is the Magnolia Res
taurant, run by F. A. Fouts. Its interior
and exterior has been appropriately dec
orated for the occasion. There are, indeed,
on every hand, not only in Redwood City
but at San Mateo ami in other parts of the
county, many evidences of the hearty sup
port accorded this floral festival by the
people of Pan Mateo County.
As the bicycle track is not in good con
dition, the tournament scheduled for Sat
urday afternoon has been postponed, but
in its stead will be the boss baseball game
of the season in Fan Mateo County, De
tween the Eedwood Citys and the Menlo
Park boys. The match will be held at the
Daseball grounds inside the bicycle track
at Redwood City. It will be a hot game
from start to finish, for the two teams are
pretty evenly matched. There is a purse
of $25 for the winning team, and this will
not cool the ardor of the players.
P. P. Chamberlain, the County Treasu
rer, is manager of the game and the um
pire is yet to be chosen. The teams are
composed as follows;

Working for the Fiesta.
HEALOSBURG, Cai,.. April 30.â Even
a Btrangcr visiting this city would note
that something unusual was on the tapis.
Carpenters are blockading the business
thoroughfares, and piles of lumber are
stacked on the grass plats of the public
square to be used on the band stand and
queen's stand. Great piles of evergreens
are stacked up to be used in covering
arches, towers and stands, and the festive
small boy is intently watching the pro
ceedings.
This all means that Healdsburg is pre
paring for its second annual floral festival
to be held here, commencing on Wednes
day of next week. The festival directors
are busily at work arranging details lor
the fiesta and giving instructions to the
sub-committees, and everything is so that
the big show will be ready to open on
schedule time, will be at their
best during the dates, for the cold weather
kept the buds back, and now the warm
sun is bringing them out in all their
splendor.
"Queen Alice Haigh has selected her

will do duty are the Misses Nellie I'etrav,
Lena Zane, Edna Biddie, Violet Luedke,

Bad Day for Lovern and
Ardell at Their Ex
amination.
TEE OMINOUS THIRTEEN
Testimony of the Thirteenth Wit
ness Causes Defendants
Uneasiness.
IS A SALVATION ARMY MAN
And Tells How He Furnished the
Powder for the Job and Then
Became Scared.
VI8ALIA, CaiÂ», April 30.â At the pre
liminary examination of Lovern and
Ardell, the prosecution to-day introduced
thirteen witnesses and adjourned until
morning. Leon Goldstein, clerk for the
Sweet Company, testified that Si Lovern
purchased 10 cents worth of cheesecloth
on March 18, Lovern remarking at the
time, "I want it for the old woman to hang
outside." The sample of cloth and the
piece around the lantern was similar to
that sold to Lovern.
Eugene Kequard, alias Frenchy, the
porter of Lovern & Ardcll's saloon, swore
that on the 18th he was carrying in wooti
at the French laundry when Lovern came
to him and said, "Frenchy, I want you to
go and get my two guns and dog-collar."
He could not remember the time of day.
There were several men in the saloon
when he gave them to Si and walked
away.
M. L. Weaver, gunsmith, identified the
two guns broughc to hiB shop by Billy Ross
and afterward delivered to Requard, or the
man known as Frenchy, on the morning
of March 18.
Tlie thirteenth witness, John Haines â a
Salvation Army man â said his name was
"Mr. Haines." He had been acquainted
with Lovern four years and with McCall
and Britt two or three months. Was in
troduced to McCall by Ben Hicks. He ad
mitted having had conversations with
Lovern, Ardeil, McCall and Britt about
the attempted train robbery.
Witness was cutting wood near his
home when McCaJl came by and asked
him if he wanted to "make a stake" easily.
He said '"Yes." McCall then told him he
meant to rob a train and wanted him to
stand in. They met a few times and tne
matter was mentioned again. Finally,
two or three weeks after, McCall invited
witness to go to Visalia and confer with
Lovern and Ardell about the matter. He
did so on Saturday evening, attending the
Salvation Army meeting first. Was intro
duced to Lovern by McCall as his friend.
Lovern, Ardell and McCall were in tbe sa
loon consulting together. He talked
awhile with them, they assuring him that
their plan was a good way to make a for
tune soon. Next Saturday night, after
meeting again, he visited the saloon and
had another talk with the three. Lovern
showed him the guns and said he would
have them fixed up well ; also a sixshoot
er. At the next visit Lovern urged him to
stay with them and not back out, as there
was a good stake in it. The three were
there again. Lovern assured witness that
he and Ardell would be there at the rob
bery if they were needed. Lovern also
said he would furnish the guns. This
meeting was the Saturday nignt before the
attempt.
All were to get a share of the money
captured. Haines was to furnish the giant
powder, as McCall said he didn't have
any, and Lovern and Ardell thought it
would look suspicious if they bought it in
town, and woodchoppera generally had
some. On March 17 he brought the powder
to McCall and Britt. Next day McCall
told him "it was generally the third man
that gave these robberies away." He,
being the third man, got frightened and
quit.
Haines' testimony, beine; different than
the counsel for defense expected, caused
the defendants to shift uneasily in their
seats, also causing counsel and clients
to put their heads together.
What Millionaire Jilist Sate Where the
Itntn Has Cut.
VISALIA, Cal., April 30.â When George
D. Bliss, the ruillonaire stock-raiser, was
put on the stand to-day to testify in the
contempt proceedings in the Farmers'
Ditch Company case, as published ex
clusively in The Call of April 21, on being
asked if he saw anything on that Sunday
when he visited the scene of the cutting
of the dam, "Yes," he said, "I saw there
a gang of outlaws."
After one or two more questions and an
swers had gone into the record counsel for
the Kaweah and Mill Creek Company,
who had not understood exactly what Mr.
Bliss said, objected and wished to have
the term "outlaws" stricken out.
Judge Cross said the objection should
have been made sooner and overruled their
motion.
Later witness spoke of seeing J. J. Fulg
ham there and said the rest of them
seemed to look up to him as though he
were a pod. Mr. Bliss said he thought Mr.
Fulgham was too good a man to be up
tbere working on Sunday. He designated
tuo whole crowd at work on the dam as
outlaws ard too cowardly to do that work
on a week day. He told them there that
this business would cost somebody $10,000;
also, that they were all guilty of violating
an injunction and were in contempt of
court.

Wat Hunting Hint* on a Strawberry
Ranch Tt'lth Ttca Gun*.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 30.â
Sheriff Hick9 this afternoon received a
telephone messace telling him that the
dead body of an unknown bov had been
found in a canyon near the Stow ranch,
beyond La Patera, some sixteen miles
away. No explanation has been made of
this mysterious affair beyond the intima
tion that the lad may have been one em
ployed on a Chineso strawberry ranch in
the vicinity.
To-night the Sheriff and Coroner brought
in the body of the boy reported as killed
on the Stow ranch. The boy proves to be
Eddie Dotty, a lad of 15, better known as
Eddie True, whose mother and stepfather
live in this city. The young fellow was
engaged as a strawberry-picker by some
Chinamen, lessees of thu Stow ranch,
owned by a son of the late S. P. Stow of
Han Francisco, thirteen miles from here,
the Â«( one of the tragedy being in a canyon
a mile above the Stow residence.
The Chinaman states that birds had
been destroying his berry crop of late, and
he gave the boy a commission to slisot
them while he and another Celestial and
a smaller American boy were picking ber
ries.. He heard the report of she gun
about 9 o'clock this morning, but sup-
Dosed Eddie had shot a bird and did not
ever, look in the direction from which the
report came, when, realizing some fifteen
minutes later that the boy had DOC called
out or moved, he crossed the filed to inves
tigate the causa and found the lad lying
dead. â¢ . .
The chin and one side of the face were
torn away by the shot, which evidently
severed the jugular vein. The boy was
carrying two guns and it is believed that
he stumbled, causing one to discharge.
There seems every reason to credit the
Chinaman's statement, which ia confirmed
by all the circumstances. A Coroner's
jury has been subpenaed and wll hold an
inauest to-morrow.

they had invested togetner with a number
of friends in this vicinity who were unable
to make the trip.
The leader of the expedition was a for
mer resident of this county who had
borne an excellent reputation and who
proves to also wield a facile and flowery
pen. He had induced a considerable col
ony to invest in the valley to which they
were traveling on his representations that
it was a small paradise containing some
20,000 acres of rich, tillable soil, beauti
fully wooded and watered, with valuable
deposits of the richest rock salt and di
rectly on the surveyed line of the Salt
Lake City and Los Angeles Railroad.
Every stage of the journey was marked
by an enthusiastic and highly coloied let
ter from this gentleman, published in a
local paper, describing in romantic lan
guage the delightful country through
which the party was traveling, the splen
did hunting and glorious prospects before
it. Suddenly the tinal letter stating that
on the next day the goal would be reached
wasabruptly followed by the news pub
lished by the local press that the writer
had returned in wonderfully quick time
across country, and that his companions
would be along in a few days.
These gentlemen have now arrived and
tell a story of grewsome experience with a
sorry ending. They state that after being
led across a dreary country where water
and fodder were lacking, and suffering
every discomfort and privation, they
came to the alleged paradise, which proved
to be a small and barren tract, of which
the valley portions were poor anil worth
less and the mesas above tho reach of irri
gation. Some lines were made by a sur
veyor, and the sections for which some of
the party had paid proved to be worthless
rivor-bed.
Their leader and organizer at this junc
ture went off to look up some horses, and
it is a matter of general gratification
among the rest that he never returned, as
they were then in a mood to organize- a
necktie party on the spot. They made
their way back across the deserts and
mountains they had crossed and entered
Santa Barbara wiser and more contented
men than when they left.
The extent of the loss entailed by this
wildcat colonization scheme cannot at
this moment be ascertained, although it is
known that about 10,000 acres had been
filed upon, a large number of the in
vestors having in good faith paid their
first installment of 25 cents an acre and
an additional quarter on every acre to
their guide for locating the lands.
A meeting of those interested has been
called, and some steps will be immediately
taken to retrieve their losses.
1 he most bitterly disappointed among
the group are at a loss to account for the
extraordinary fraud perpetrated upon
them, and their locator seems bewildered
and unable to explain his behavior. While
he has pocketed a considerable amount of
money, he has made no attempt to escape
the law's clutches, and has offerea to turn
over what property he possesses to make
good the losses sustained.
Meanwhile, several Santa Barbara men
with nice bank accounts who had author
ized friends in the expedition to select
locations for them are congratulating
themselves on their escape.
Dramatic Scene in the Court
house Over the Custody of
Annie Reger.
H?r Mother Takes the Girl From the
Foster Parents, but Loses
Her Again.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 30.â There
was a dramatic scene at the Courthouse
to-day when Judge Clark decided that he
had no jurisdiction in the contest for the
guardiar;.Â«hip of Annie Roger, tbe 14-year
old daughter of Mrs. Kate Kusack, who
came all the way from Seattle to Los
Angeles to got possession of her child.
Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Hendricfcs, who
have cared for Annie since Bhe was a babe,
had applied for letters of guardianship,
which were denied and Mrs. Kusack was
informed that she waa at liberty to lake
her offspring.
All the interested parties were in court
when the decision was made, and Mrs.
Kusack, assisted by her attorney and a
strong man hired for the purpose, forth
with proceeded to seize the girl, who
clung to her foster parents ana sobbed
hysterically. By sheer force she wai
drac^ed. screaming from, the courthouse,
hurried into a hack, driven rapidly to the
Southern l'acihc station and placed aboard
a train for San Pedro, where Mrs. Kusack
intended to board a steamer with the un
willing girl lor Seattle.
{Sheriff Burr this evening received a tele
phone message from Mrs. Kusack, at San
I'fdro, informing him that Annie had
given her the slip and was making her way
back to Los Aujjeles. The Sheriff waa
requested to look out for her, but he re
fused to inteifere.
Annie's mother was a domestic in the
Hendricks family lor many years, and
allowed them to keep the child for four
years after she married Kusack.
It was not until Bhe was nearly prown
up and her stepfather wanted her as a
waitress in his restaurant at Seattle that
the mother demanded and secured the
custody of her child by a decree of court.
But Annie ran away from her mother and
joined her foster parents in Los Angeles,
where the legal contest for her guardian
ship t was revived upon Mrs. Kusack's ar
rival here a short time ago.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 30.- Sheriff
Borcwart of Kern County has written
Sherff Burr of this county, stating that
there is a man who lives in that county in
a way to invite suspicion that he is hiding
from arrest. He stays in a secluded part
of the mountains, does not leave the local
ity and always goes heavily armed. He
is described as beinc G feet, 30 or 35 years
old, dark complexion, of Irish descent,
and gives his name as Jim Johnson. He
always has two pistols on him. The
Sheriff wants to know if such a man is not
wanted in Los Angel s. The supposed
bandit is not known here.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 30.â H. K.
Kelton, a young man who came to this
city from West Bay City, Michigan, a
short time ago for his health, committed
suicide in his room at 811 South Main
street this rooming by sending a bullet
into his brain. The young man evidently
braced himself against the bureau, and,
looking into the mirror, placed the muzzle
of the gun directly over the temple. Death
was instantaneous.
Deceased was about 21 years of age and
nearly dead with consumption. His
father is at the head of a large hoop manu
factory at West Bay Citv, Mich. He was
immediately notified of his son's death.

Grand Jury Foreman Arrested
on a Charge of Criminal
Libel.
Reflections Were Cast Upon the
Supervisors' Methods of Making
Appointments.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., April 30.-John
Weil, foreman of the Grand Jury, has
been arrested on a charpe of criminal
libel, sworn to by J. M. Morrison, chair
man of the Board of Supervisors, as the
result of statements made in the late re
port of the Grand Jury, which reflected
unjustly, it is claimed, on the actions of
the latter gentleman and his colleagues.
The main charge which has incensed the
Board of Supervisors is set forth as follows
in the complaint:
We, the Grand Jury of Sacramento County,
have thoroughly Investigated the matter and
manner of appointments by the Supervisors of
Sacramento County composed of said John F
Dreman, J. W. Todd, J. M. Morrison. William
Gurus and Thomas Jenkins, and found that
they nave been for several years corruptly sell
ing appointments. The deal is always a cash
transaction, and when an applicant for sn an
pointment is in doubt about being able to ray
their price and make the office pay they have
advised, him how to manage that part of it,
and such advice is never in the interest of the
county.
It was in evidence before the Jury (meaning
thereby the Grand Jury of Sacramento County)
that they (meaning thereby said John F. Dre
man, J. W. Todd, J. M. Morrison, William Cur
tis and Thomas Jenkins) held the office of
License Collector to be worth to the Supervisor
ring $1200 lor a two years' appointment. This
corruption was found to apply to several of
the more important appointive offices under
the control of the Supervisors, he.the said John
well, then, there and at all times, well know
ing the *ald defamatory libel to be false and
the same was and is false.
It is also claimed that warrants will be
sworn to against June Harris and John
Sheehan, proprieton and editors of the
Sunday newt, :i weekly paper issued in
this city, charging them with criminal
libel in bavin* repeatedly published de
famatory reports of the actions of the
Board of Supervisors. The latter are dis
tinctly on the war path and threaten suits
against every member of the late Grand
Jury.
After Four Months the Search for Young
XtcGrade Hat Iteen Abandoned.
ETREKA, Cal.. April 30.â William Mc-
Grade and wife, with a partv of five men,
have just returned from Wild Grass Prai
rie, where they have been searching for
four weeks in hopes of finding the body of
their aon William, who was lost on a
hunting trip in the redwoods last January.
After all means have been tried they have
reluctantly decided to abandon the search.
The merchants of Eureka have fitted out
expeditions thoroughly provisioned to en
able Um relief parties to make systematic
searches. The services of Indian scouts
have been secured, and rinullv, William
McGrade. father of the boy, ha* superin
tended the ."eurch in person and his wife
has done the cooking for the party. The
density of the timber and the wild 'growth
of underbrush make it difficult for a thor
ough search. Young McGrade has proba
bly fallen over a bank into a canvon or
been drowned in an attempt to ford some
stream swollen by the winter freshets.
Shipped From San Frnncitro to Seattle
and Stranded.
PORTLAND, Or., April 30.â Kenneth
Rose .Jones, a seven-year-old tourist from
San Francisco, bound for Seattle, landed
here in a stranded condition this morning.
The conductor of the train on which he
arrived turned him over to the police, with
whom he will remain until the Aid So
ciety makes arrangements to forward the
boy to his destination. Little Kenneth
carries with him a note stating his name,
and that his destination is Green Lake
Seattle, to visit his grandmother, Mrs.
Mary D. Rose, and his aunt, Miss lsie
RoÂ«e.
His parents, who work in a restaurant
on Third street, between Mission and
Howard, San Francisco, furnished him
with transportation to this city only,
trusting to luck that charitably disposed
people would see to his further transpor
tation. The child had but 40 cents when
he left home. He was very hungry.

Dazzjing Carnival of Water
and Electricity Is
Proposed.
NATIVES AT THE HELM.
The Return of Their Delegates
to the Grand Parlor Is
Awaited.
UNIQUE FEATURES SUGGESTED.
To Be the Grandest Celebration of Its
Kind Ever Held in the
State.
STOCKTON, Cal., April 30.â Next Mon
day evening the Native Sons will hold a
meeting in their hall in the Austin build
ing to hear the formal report, of the dele
gates to the Grand Parlor at San Luis
Obispo. These are District Attorney Nut
ter, Georjre Catts and H. R. McNoble. At
that time the matter of arranging for the
entertainment of the crowds that will be
in this city on Admission day will be
brought up, and probably an executive
committee of six or more will be appointed
to carry out whatever plan of entertain
ment that may be decided upon.
L. E. Frankenbeimer has been one of
the most active workers in securing guar
antees of funds to carry out the Admis
sion day celebration. He said this morn
ing that the members of the executive
committee would probably bo made the
heads of the various sub-committees to be
appointed on- decoration, reception, enter
tainment and the !Qd^ so that there will
always be some one on hand to report
what the sub-committees are doing vfhen
the executive committee meets.
"It is very hard ju9t now to say what
the main feature of the celebration here
will be," said Mr. Frankenheinier. ''There
have been several suggestions made,
among them that of holding another car
nival on a very large scale. Sacramento
had an electrical carnival last year, and we
could use electricity to great advantage
here in decorating the city. We shall
probably do this wherever we caD within
the amount of money we have for the pur
nose of display. An immense electrical
arch at the head of the channel would be
a pretty feature, while clear down the
channel the heads of the piles could be
utilized by stringing Iinesof electric-lights
along the banks. There is no end to the
display that could be made here on the
water.
"I understand that Sacramento is goinj;
to hold a regatta there on day.
We will see if they will not abandon the
idea and let us hold bv.e on a larger scale
than has ever before been attempted. We
did all we could to aid them last year, and
I think they will do this to aid us this
time. They are too near Stockton to do
anything to detract from what entenain
ment we have here, and be-ides we have
the finest body of water in the State for
rowing. We may ask the Stockton Ath
letic Association to take in hand the
arrangement of a monster field day here,
and Â«et a St:He meet of the clubs belong
ing to the Pacific Athletic Association.
All these matters will be discussed by the
members of Stockton Parlor just as soon
as our delegates return from t-an Luis
Obispo.
"Tnere will be an immense amount of
work, and for that reason we will proba
bly pet to work without delay to plan
what to do on Admission day. The parlor
is open to any suggestions that may be
made as to what would he a fitting enter
tainment to provide for the thousands
who will be in the city on tho 8th, 9th and
10th of next September.'
There have already been a number of
vpry valuable suggestions m.vl-> as to what
sort of a demonstration to hold. Among
them the idea of another water carnival
has been advanced, with tableaux on the
waters of McLeod's Lake depicting scenes
from Shakesj-eare and other dramatists'
and poets' works, fÂ«t:ch as Cleopatra 1 ? bar<e,
and other things of a like nature.
Electrical fountains can be easily ar
ranged in the lake, whose waters ere
never very deep, and the shores, which are
wooie.l ou one side, could be turned into
aa pretty a scene as can bo arranpod any
where. .Last year the Fourth of .Juiy com
mittee, with only a few hundred dollars to
operate with, made a very creditable dis
play on the night of the Fourth, for the
reason that this city has natural advan
tages over nearly uny other for any dis
play on the water.
Mr. Frankenheimer suggested to-day
that all the launches from Belvedere could
be brought up here, as those who partici
pated in the carnival held there some
time ago had all tho paraphernalia yet that
was used in that display, and could utilize
it here on Admission day night.
It is very probable that the Board of
Supervisors will undertake the work of
decorating the courthouse, and if this work
is done properly with electrical effects it
can bo seen for twenty miles about, as the
country here is so level.
That tne citizens will unite with the na
tives to make the celebration the greatest
thing of its kind that has ever been held
in the State there can be no doubt, and the
work will be mapped out very eoon by the
committee from the local parlor.
Body Found Which May lie That of a
JUairmor* Victim.
VALLEJO, Cat,., April 30.â As Walter
Buckles and E. T. Armstrong were com
ing over from the Contra Costa Bide in a
small sloop about 21 o'clock tin- morning
when within about 200 yards of the navy
yard, near the lighthouse, they discovered
the body of a man floatinz in the water.
A line was made fast to hi* legs and he
was rowed up to Vallejo near ihe terra
cotta works and word sent to Coroner
Trull, who â¢ had the body brought to
Callener's undertaking warerooms.
The man has the appearance of beine an
English sailor, as lie wears an English
seaman's coat with braid upon it. He also
wears blue overalls, and the supposition is
that he is one of the crew from the ill
fated ship Blairmore that turned over in
San Francisco JBay.
Appearances indicate that he is a colored
man. The hair is mostly off from his
head. Just above the forehead is a scar.
No valuables or other thing was found on
hia person to lead to the identity of the
man, who is large and powerfully built.
Heavy brogan shoes are on his feet.
At an inquest this evening nothing fur-
ther was developed, except that the body
was that of a white man about 6 feet hisjh,
and that he wore n black plaid coat re
sembling a pea jacket, and wore a blue
shirt with two pockets in front. Over the
undershirt was a white shirt with narrow
stripes. He wore no stockings. He was
about 40 years old and had the appearance
of being a seafaring man.
Coroner Trull will hoid the body until
the day after to-morrow, in case any one
desires to come from Blairmore to recoe
nize him. There was about a week's
growth of beard on his face. The only
hair on his head was a small piece about
an inch long in a depression over the right
eye. The body is badly decomposed and
no tattoo marks are visible on his person.
No one is missing in this section.
A Gigantic Project Which 1'rotuisea
JMueh for San Bernardino.
8AN BERNARDINO, Cal., April 30.â
The great Victor reservoir project made a
forward movement to-day.
Fonr years aso ttie scheme to impound
the water of Mnhave River was conceived
and active wo r k commenced to carry out
the great vrojecta, which means the con
verting of an immense area of now worth
less lands into beautiful farms and pro
ductive orchards.
Surveys and estimates wero njade of the
probable cost of the dam, canals, reser
voirs, etc., and the figures swelled up into
the millions.
ifatters were progressing favorably when
the financial panic enveloped the country,
and all negotiations stopped.
At last the Columbia Colonization Com
pany, composed of Eastern capitalists,
with H. P. Sweet of Los Angeles as gen
eral manager, undertook to carry out the
great scheme. Near Victor the Alojave
River pours its water through a narrow
EOige of solid rock, an ideal place for such
a dnm as the one proposed.
The proposed reservoir will impound
186,000,000,000 gallons of water, or twenty
six times the capacity of the great iJear
Valley system. The country which will
be supplied with water is very fertile and
only requires water to mate it very pro
ductive.
To-day a deed was placed on record con
veyinc 10 the company nearly 5000 acres
of land within the reservoir site. The con
sideration was if V 0,000. The grantors. Brown
and wife, reserve all rights to use the
land until water from the Mojave River
shall by a dam be laised to a level with
the house and said Jands. Mr. Sweet
stated to The Call reporter that work
will immediately be commenced and
prosecuted until the great project is com
pleted.
Jiesult of Trouble Jiettoeen a Watchman
and a JUine- Owner'* Son.
SOXORA, Cau, April 30.â W. E. Nevills,
son of Captain W. A. Nevills of the Raw
hide mine, was shot twice in the left leg
below the knee at Quartz Mountain this
evening by one Harrold, nijjht watchman
of the App mine, one of the Nevilla group
of mines.
It seems Nevills and Harrold had some
troubla at the mine a few 8ven ings ago,
while Harrold was on duty. This evening
about 6 o'clock they met in front of Har
rold's house and had some angry words,
when Nevills drew his pistol and fired,
HftrroJd returning the fire, two shots tak
ing effect in Nevills' leg, Harrold escaping
injury.
Nevills drove over to Jamestown where
Dr. Congdon extracted the bullets. The
wounds are very painful, but not neces
sarily serious. Xevills is at the Fisson
Hotel in Jamestown. His father. Captain
Neville, has been in Sau Francisco several
davs, but will return to-night. No parti
culars regarding the nature of the quarrel
can be learned at this time.

fessional baseball season in this city, a
game between Seattle and Tacoma under
the auspices of the new Pacific League
being scheduled for the afternoon at Y.
M. 0. A. Part.Building Trades to Enforce
the Working Card
at Once.
WILL DELAY NO LONGER.
A Mass-Meeting of the Unem
ployed at 115 Turk
Street.
TO ORGANIZE COMMITTEES.
Large Bodies of Men Will Strike
Every Non-Union Jjb They
Caa Find in This City.
May 1 is not to pass without a demon
stration on the part of the lal>orin
people. As predicted in The Call on
Thursday the Building Trades Council
has decided upon radical measures to
enforce its working card and the first
movement will be taken to-day.
Last night after a Ions and spirited dis
cussion tne council decided that it was of
no use to dilly-dally with the principles of
unionism any longer. Nothing remained
but to strike every "unfair" job in San
Francisco and tight the non-union men
and enemies of organized labor to the
bitter end.
This does not mean a general striice at
the present, hut such a course may have
to be resorted to ii the plan adopted fails
to accomplish the desired results speedily.
The council's working card went into
effect April 1, but in many cases it was
more honored in the breach than in the
observance, and manv union men are !
working with non-union men. Further- i
more, the carpenters sent out notice to all
building contractors that on May 1 they
would demand $3 as the minimum wage
for nine hours' work.
Last night, Business Agent Mclvor. in
asking for instructions, c-illed attention to
the condition of affairs.
Delegate Zant offered a resolution thai
the affiliated unions stand no more non- '<
sense, but proceed to enforce the card
fcystem.
The plan finally adopted shows more '
judgment than in 'some difficulties of re
cent date. It was to call together at 10
o'clock this morning, at 115 Turk street,
ail the unemployed members of the un
ions affiliated with the Building Trades
Council. In iaot it will be a bie mass
meeting.
Committees of from twenty-rive to fifty
men will be appointed for each of a dozen
districts in the City. These committee?,
under the direction of the two business
agents and the crievance committee, will
sally forth in bodies and call a strike on
every "scab" job in their respective dis
tricts. No union job? will be molested,
but there will be trouble for the non-union
ones.
In the first place, demands will be made
on the contractors that the non-union
men be unionized or discharged.
In the event of a relusal the union men
at work, if there tie any, wiil be ordered
out and the objectionable job will be
''picketed" by a goodly number of t&e
committee.
To make it still plainer, the life of the
non-union workman will be made miser
able as well as tha: of the unfriendly bo?-*.
By a simultaneous strike of this descrip
tion the union men expect to unionize the
City by force of munbers.
The unions that will participate in this
movement are the five Carpenters' unions,
Lathers', Plasterers', Iron-roofers', Cornice
workers', Laborers' or Hodcarriers', Stone
cutters', Glaziers', Painters" and several
other organizations, numbering nearly
50CJ0 men. Of this number there is a re
markably small proportion at work, and
it is believed that tae committees them
selves will be small armies.
These will march over their respective
districts in bodies and no doubt present a
formidable appearance to the non-union
workmen who nave refused to fraternize
with their fellow-workmen.
In the afternoon at 3 o'clock a second
mass-mieting ol the unemployed working
men will be held at 115 Turk street to
further perfect the plans and instruct the
committees.
It is douotful if more than one or twe
jobs wiil be "struck" to-dav, but on Sat
urday arid Monday the ac'ti-e work will
begin.
If moral suasion with the non-union
men ana unfriendly contractors does not
succeed, there is little doubt but that a
general strike of all the building trades in
the City will be ordered. At any rate,
lively times among tiie trades unions may
be expected within the next ten days.
The matter of providing a fund for the
relief of tho&e men who will be ordered
out on strike was ditcussed by the council
and referred to a special committee.
The Union Beermakera Are Indorsed
by the Building Trades
. Council.
The United Brewery Workmen's Union
Is preparing for another biz right with the
Brewers' Protective Association unless the
members of the latter organization agree
to a settlement of the old troubles.
Secretary Walters recently sent a letter
to the association asking for the appoint
ment of a conference committee to discuss
the situation, bnt later he was informed
that for some reason the letter was never
:ead, and under these circumstances he
decided not to open the fight until after he
vras folly informed of the stand of the
boss brewers. However, last night he
sent the following letter to the Building
Trades Council.
To the offirrm anri memben of >h<: Butldtvg
T ada OowkUâVklubw Wop.kmkn: The L'nited
Brewery Workmen's Union of San Francisco \n
faced with an alternative of giving Tip their
union or lighting for their recognition. We
bave tried by every honorable means to aToid
this conflict, but have been met by insults and
repulses. We are now determined to make a
i final test of strength, and ask your sympathy
! and moral support when the time of action
arrives.
We desire an expression of your opinion and
! ideas at this time, us a knowledge of such Is
â  vital to the suc.ess of our plans. We take it
' for granted that the helping hand of fraternal
. friendship will be extended to us by you, and
; ask such assurence as a matter of detail and
i preparation only.
Fraternally yours, United Brewery Work
man's Union. Joskvh Walters, Secretary.
The council unanimously promised the
Brewers' Union its support. Simiiar
action will no doubt be taken by the labor
council to-night. As stated by Walters
his purpose in this course is to learn of the
attitude of the other unions in case it
comes to an open fight.
In such an event steps will be taken to
introduce union b3er from the breweries
j of adjoining towns. Here is where the
! labor union support will be wanted to bov-
I cott the one and patronize the other.
This means but one tilingâ a cheap beer
j war, which the bosses are only too anxious
to avoid.
St. Mary's College Tarish Picnic.
There will bfl a picnic and outing of the

National Electrical Exposition
Will Open on Monday
Next.
' Aided by Electricity Its Governor
Will Fire a Ponderous Gun
in This City.
The mighty report of a ponderous
cannon in I'nfctn square, fired with a
golden key, on which rests the hand of
New York's Governor, Levi P. Morton,
will herald to the people of this City the
turning of the first wheel of the National
Electrical Exposition on the evening of
May 4 in New York City. Before the echo
of this cannon's report has died away
arnong the hills the machinery in the far
away metropolis will be in full swing, and
many thousands of people will witness a
sight of almost unparalleled grandeur.
In connection with the opening cere
\ monies of the Electrical Exposition it is
proposed to start the machinery by a
I current, that is looped around the whole
I continent.
The Postal Telegraph Cable Company,
; through its vice-president, W. H. Baker,
i offered its tine service between New York
and San Francisco for the purpose. Mayor
Sutro and General Forsyth, the latter be
ing in command at the Presidio, not being
satisfied with the silent electric messenger
which would speed through this Citv, pro
, posed to have the wires connected with a
; cannon in some central location that all
raignt be apprised of the great exposition 1 ?
opening. Arrangements are now being
made with the Postal officials for the exe
cution of this intere>ting plan, with the
; co-operation of a long string of offices
scattered over the <<000 miles of wire.
The company has equipped its lines with
heavy copper circuits and believes that it
! can illustrate in a most interesting man
ner the instantaneous character of the
transmission on the evening of May 4.
1 The merest pressure of the golden key
i will then flash the signal to the Golden
\ Gate, will cause the cannon to belch forth
a merry salute and. will then be back to
the exposition buiidine in the twinkling
. of an eye.
One of the most interesting exhibits to
be seen at the exposition will be a tiny
, model of the Niagara Falls Power Compa
| ny's plant, whose ereat original will itself
furnish the power by which the miniature
i model will be operated.
jÂ«o well planned is this miniature mode',
â¢ that it shows the city of Niagara Falls and
; surrounding locality, from a point just be-
I yond the line of the power-tunnel on the
north, to the center of Goat Island on the
south, and from a point beyond the Clifton
House, Canada side, on the west, to a
point beyond the big tunnel-canal on the
east. The model is 12 feet long by 3 feet <>
inches wide. The height of the model
when on exhibition is about six feet, but
one-half of this is in a line glass case,
I which protects it from meddlesome hands
and mist.
The power-houses, wheel pits, cross sec-
I tion of the canal, turbine wheels and the
â  tunnels are all faithfully reproduced from
j the original. When power is applied water
i will flow down the penstocks and shafts.
As the water passes from|the turbine it
| enters a drift or small tunnel leading to
1 the main tunnel and is carried through it
i to the gorge below.
In the construction of the model the
scale used was one of about 100 feet to an
inch and a half. All the streets and build
ings shown are perfect in form and direc
tion, and one acquainted with the city of
Niagara Falls has no trouble in locating
well-known places. The total number of
i buildings shown is 197. while the number
; oi trees which grace the streets of the city
in the model is II.jO. Every one of the
trees Mr. Allen, the model maker, suc
; ceeded in locating with precision.
Although held under the auspices of the
j National Electric Light Association, the
j exposition is far from being restricted Â«.o
j the field that was covered by the associa
| tion when it was formed. As a matter of
' fact the exposition will accentuate and di
: rect attention to the remarkable fact that
I central stations are rapidly undergoing
; evolution, and every day they become Ies3
; and less plants for mere lighting, and
, more and more reservoirs for the supply of
! current for a wonderfully wide range of
uses, many of which are barely yet known.
In all events, the exposition will serve
i as a stimulus to another period of pros
i nerity in the electrical industries, but San
! Franciscans will have to be content with
t!.e boom of the great caisson as it her
alds the inauguration of the gigantic ex
hibition.
That Is the Fourth District's
Contesting Combi*
nation.
A SIGNIFICANT MOVE.
What the Success of Kelly and
Mahoney Would Mean to
the Party.
REVIVAL OF "GOOD OLD TIMES"
Martin Kelly and J. H. Mahoney Make
a Play to Float in on the
McKinley Tide.
The Kelly-Mahoney-Rainey delegation
from the Fourth District met last evening
and in accordance with directions received
from Martin Kelly and Jerry Mahoney
j adopter, resolutions pledging the delega
tion to McKinley. This move is a bright
exposition of Kelly- Alahoney politics.
The idea of Martin Kelly and Jerry Ma
honey caring anything about or knowing
anything about "protection," "money,"
or any other National issue is one to make
botti horses and bicycle-riders laugh.
Kelly and Mahoney want their delegation
seated in the State Convention that they
may obtain some measure of local politi
cal power, and as a shrewd play they are
very naturally shouting "McKinley."
Kelly and Mahoney are trying to float
into local power on McKinley 's name and
hope to play their practical tricks in such
! a way that they may take advantage of
j the McKinley sentiment and with the aid
â¢ of their brass band and their shouting win
enough sympathy to accomplish recogni
tion by the State Convention through
making their "whoop"' hide the dements
of their cause.
As the opposition to the Kelly- Manoney
delegation is composed of the mass of the
Republican party of the Fourth Congres
sional District, and as the regular delega
tion nominated and elected by the people
of the district represents the Republican
sentiment of the district, the outcome oi
an issue between the party and two dis
carded bosses who have raised one of its
banners as a political trick is not in
doubt.
The Kelly-Mahoney aelegation repre
sents the McKinley sentiment of the
Fourth Congressional District exactly as
Martin Keliy represents the Republican
ism of the Fourth Congressional District.
Among the regular delegates to the
.State Convention arc more sin
cere and intelligent friends of McKinley
than there are in the Kelly-Mahoney dele
gation, but the regular delegation goes as
a body of free and representative
, Republican voters, the majority of
whom are in favor simply of a
delegation to tne National Convention
unfettered by castiron pledges, while the
Kelly-Mahoney delegation stands forth as
a ounch of votes pledged to MlKihIcv,
wholly that Martin Kelly and J. H. Ma
honey may gaiu thereby a tactical advant
age in the Mate Convention in their little
play for local political power.
The manhood and the Republicanism of
the State Convention will deal with this
fact and this contemptible motive, along
with the facts in the case, which disgrace
this contest, born in fraud and fathered
by two of the most disreputable renegades
j that afflict the Republican party in Cali
fornia.
A contest, the strength and force of
which consists of three things: Kelly and
Mahoney, the noise they can make ana
7300TOtea which were added to the 300
which the "push" of Kelly and Mahoney
could muster at the late farcical primary.
The success of Kelly and Mahonev at
the State Convention means the entry of
Sam Rainey into the Republican politics
of San Francisco.
What a foothold by Sam Rainey in San
Francisco Republican politics means is
well understood by the people of San Fran
cisco, and is fairly well understood by the
Republicans of California.
If any broad political fact i? well known
it is the one that now and for a dozen
years Sam Rainey's political partners on
the Republican side have been Martin
Kelly and Jerry Mahoney.
The ascendency of Kelly and Mahoney
in San t rancisco politics means that these
two conscienceless und corrupt district
bosses will make any and all local politi
cal combinations that may be to the com
mon advantage of thete freebooters.
Jerry Mahoney is the political creature
of Sam Rainey, who gave him the first po
litical job a dozen years ago. For twelve
years Mahoney and Rainey have done
politics together in the way that municipal
bosses who care nothing about party do
politics.
Sam Rainey was Jerry Mahoney's po
litical friend and sponsor twelve years
ago; he has been his friend and political
| co-worker ever since, and the story
! of how Sam Rainey and his
gang turned out at the last pener.il
election find helped knife J. T. Kurke, the
Democratic candidate; Williams, the inde
pendent Republican candidate, and ihe
| general Republican ticket that Jerry Ma
i honey might go again to the State Senate
| is an old one to every politician in that
part of the City.
Martin Kelly was a Fire Commissioner
j once by grace of Sam Rainoy, and Martin
Kelly did for years fumble the Fire Depart
ment, which was owned by Sam Rainey.
For four months, Sam Rainey, Martin
Kelly and J. H. Mahoney were in almost
daily open consultation, up to the time
Rainey went to San Bernardino County.
There is in San Francisco no political
combinntion so surely established as
that composed of Sam Rainey and his old
and tried friends, Jerry Mahoney and
Martin Kelly.
The success of Kelly and Mahoney in
politics means now, as it always has
moant, the entry of Sain Rainey into the
politics of San Francisco.
It I* Feared That Many Miners Perished
in a Colliery.
LONDON, Exc, April 30.â An explosion
of firedamp took place to-day in-tae Micfc
eiheld colliery. About a hundred men
were in the mine at the time. As soon as
possible rescuers entered the mine and
soon succeeded in bringing twenty-five
men to the surface. All of them were
terribly burned and some will undoubt
edly die.
The rescuers are still in the mine, but
are working under great difficulty. It is
feared that the others have all perished.

Orders Issued for the Trial
Trip of the Battle-Ship
Oregon.
The Pacific Funding Bi 1 Will Sooa
Be Considered in the House
of Representatives.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 3O.-The
Navy Department to-day sent orders to
San Francisco for the trial of the Oregon.
The conditions of the trial trip will be the
same as those in the case of the Indiana
and Massachusetts, and the trial will take
place over a thirty-one-knot course in the
Santa Barbara channel, just outside of the
old Olympic course. The California build
ers are expressing confidence that they
will be able to match the 16.20 knot9 of the
Massachusetts when the trial is run off,
which will be as soon as the board can re
ceive the instructions mailed to-day.
The Cam correspondent to-night re
ceived definite information that the Pacific
lunding bill would be made a special or
der for consideration in t'ue Hou.se of Rep
resentatives on Tuesday, May 12. This
corner from Speaker Reed through a mem
ber of Congress. There have been reports
circulated here to the effect that the Presi
dent would veto the bill if it passed Con
gress.
"The passage of this bill would furnish
an excellent chance for the President to
make campaign material for his party.
His veto of the Santa Monica job and the
funding bill would striKe a popular chord,
and I have no doubt he would veto both, 1 '
said a Pacific Cua>t Congressman to-day.
WhM this was "suggested to Senator
Frye, however, he .-aid: "While I have no
doubt the President will veto the river
and hai bor bill he will not veto the Pacific
roads Dili."

Some Fine Sport Furnished Race
gcers Opening Day at
Ingleside.
FORTUNA GETS IN AT 30 TO 1.
George Palmer Bsat Scarborough by
a Close Marginâ Mt. McGregor
II Dumped the Talent.
Ingleside track was favored with Beauti
ful weather for its reopening day. Many!
of the sport - loving public who had |
been recuperating during the Bay Dis
trict's spell of racing again turned out in
numbers and the ring presented almost as
animated appearance as early in the sea- !
son when the game was fresh. Needless
to remark, the fair sex did full honor to
"Itdies.* day." They occupied the greater
part of the grand stand and grew hysteri
cally enthusiastic over some of the many
close finishes.
The suort was tar above the average.
The driving rinishes precluded all chance
of there being many "lobsters," although
the performances of one or two horses did
not reflect much credit on their riders.
And, witnal, while the racing was excel-)
lent, it was a disastrous day for the talent.
Two of their hardest downfalls were on j
Olive and Mt. McGregor II, both favorites ]
of tno "cinchy" order. Montalvo, the |
jumper, and George Palmer were the only
winning first choices.
The swell upset of the day occurred in
pacific Coast Jockey Club's W inter fleeting, ingleside Track. Seventy. third dÂ«y, Thursday,

the third event, a seven-furiong run, for
which Olive went to the post a top-heavy
favorite, bacKed from twos down to 9 to 10.
Joe Terry and All Over, the second *nd
third ciioices, respectively, both went back
in the betting. The favorite and All Over
made the running to the far turn, where
the latter fell back, and Joe Terry took
second position. Into the stretch Olive
gradually forged ahead and appeared to
hold the race safe, when McClain suddenly
brought the 30 to 1 shot, Fortuna, on from
third place, and in the hottest sorr of a
drive snatched the race by a short nose.
Joe Terry was a good third."
The bookmakers chalked up 1 to 2
against Montgomery in the betting on the
opening race, a rive and a half furlong
dash for maidens, but he did not seem to
stand in very high favor with bettors, and
the greater portion of the coin went in on
the 2>i to 1 second choice, Carnation. Be
fore reaching the stretch the latter had
passed Montgomery, and at the wire beat
him out easily by three leuths. Yucata n
a 100 to 1 sbot, finished in the show.
A selling affair at six furlongs followed.
Nervoso, with Willie Flynn up, opened a
pronounced G to 5 choice over the other
seven starters, but receded until 3 to 1 was
obtainable. This price was later backÂ«Kl
down to 2. Red Pike, Irroa and Encino
were all fairly well supported at longer
odds. Red Tike showed the field the way
to the stretch when he had enough. Irma
thea took up the running, but was passed
by both Encino and Warrago, the former
winning easily by three lengths.
The betting on the two-year-olds, with
nine facing the starter, was sharp and
brisk. Around post time it was 9 to 5 and
take your pick against either George Pal
mer or Adam Andrew. Long odds were
laid against the majority of the other
starters. Adam Andrew showed promi
nently in the lead for a while or until the
pace grew too hot for him. Straightened
for the wire, George Palmer took com
mand, and in a rattling drive with the 20
to 1 outsider, Scarborough, who came fast
on the inside, gained the verdict by a nose.
Sister Adele ran a good race, finishing a
cood third.
A hot tip out on Artemus at one time
made him an equal choice in the betting
with Montalvo, but a reaction took piace
and he closed at 8 to 5, with evens the best
offer against Cochran's jumper. The other
entries were not greatly in demand. Arte
mus led for a bit, but grew weary early in
the game, falling back in the bunch. It
was then only a gallop for the favorite,
who passed the stand the easiest of winners
over Silverarlo, a 15 to 1 shot.
Another big plunge made on Mt. Mc-
Gregor U, the favorite for the last race of
the day, a six-furlong spin, helped swell
the winnings of the bookies still more.
Opening up at 2 to 1 a tremendous play
cut his odds to 4 to 5. Summertime and
Kovuisky both had twos chalked against
them at the opening, which prices were
greatly lengthened out at post time. The
odds-on favorite was in front almost from
the jump and appeared to be winning
hanailv, out opposite the drawpate appar
ently wanted to run out and then prop
ping waa beaten a head by the fast coming
summertime. Kowalsky was a poor third.
The winner went to the post 4 to 1.
TRACK AND PADDOCK ITEMS.
Fourteen book-makers handled the coin
in the ring yesterday.
Fortuna pulled up very lame after her
race.
On Wednesday, Cadmus, the conqueror
of Pepper in their great contest for the
Ormonde stake, was given np by a veter
inary. Yesterday the crack racer, who
has been suffering from bowel complaint,
showed signs of improvement, and it is
now thousht that his Â«reat sameness
will pull him through, and that he will
again face the flag.
The Spreckels colors thrice flashed past
the wire in front yesterday.
The run Scarborough marte yesterday
was a vast improvement ever his race in
the stake at the Bay District the day pre
vious.

terday.
Thomas Williams With War
rants for the Men Who
Plugged Horses.
The President of the Jockey Club
Investigated Matters Himself
to Some Purpose.
Thomas Williams, president cf the Cali
fornia Jockey Club, hunted up Judge
Campbell late last night and had him
issue two warrants for the arrest of two
men whom he suspects of the crooked
work which was done at the track last
Tuesday.
When the mare Marjorie was ready to
come to the post last Tuesday, it was seen
that she was distressed. It was thought
that she had been drugged, but it was
found her nostrils were plugged with fine
silken sponges. This led to further inves
tigation, and it was found that the mare
Decision, who had run very shy, had been
treated in the same way.
Nobody knew anything about the trick,
and at the time investigations were use
leys, but since then Williams heard some
thing which led him to suspect two men,
and so he hunted up Jud^e Campbell.
The Judge was found just leaving the
Tivoh, Dut he went up to the City Hall
and issued the warrants and about 1
o'clock this morning Williams and some
officers started out to serve them.
At 3 o'clock they were still hunting for
the miscreants.
Ihf Building Trade* Council to Take
the Matter to Washington.
Aside frnni its action upon enforcing the
union working card the Building Trades
Council last evening transacted considera
ble other business. By a vote of 12 to 9 it
decided not to recognize the shinglers'
delegates to the council because of differ
ences between the carpenters and shinglers
relative to their respective lines of work.
Another complaint has been sent to tnis
City from the carpenters working in Mill
Valley, Marin County. A letter was sent
to Business Agent C. F. fcchadt of the
council, which says:
J. W. Anderson, a contractor, is advertising
in the San Francisco papers for carpenters
and bringing them here to work on a nine
hour job. Several members of the .San *ran
cisco have come here not knowing that they
wore acting in any way different from the
other carpenters here.
The facts are that all the jobs here, with
this one exception, are union jobs, and about
twenty or thirty union carpenters are at
work.
Anderson gets the men on the representation
that all the jobs hero work nine hours.
We leave it to your discretion to do what you
think best to prevent this man obtaining anv
more men under these pretense*. We have
already seen him and can gut no other reply
than that he proposes to run his job to suit
himseif. We have got two men away and will
do all we can to get the remainder away.
The Polishers' and Yarnishers' delegates
were admitted to the council.
Business Agent Mclvor made a report
upon the violation of the eight-hour Fed
eral law in the painting of tue battleship
Oregon. He said he had called upon
United States District Attorney H. S.
Foote, who hesitated and showed his dis
inclination to enforce the law against the
big Union Iron Works sub-contractor who
was doing the painting.
Foote turned P. Mclvor over to a deputy,
who imitated his superior. The council
decided to place the matter in the bands
of the grievance committee wite instruc
tions to communicate with the Pacific
Coast Keuresentatives and the Justice De
partment at Washington. It will be
pushed so far as the labor unions of this
City are able.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Among Democratic candidates there are
np favorites.
It is Mayday everywhere, but nowhere
like it is here.
To-day Europe longs for a froiic and
prepares for a fracas.
A delegation loses half its power when
deprived of all its freedom.
One faction or the other at the Chicago
convention must either bolt or crawi.
See Redwood or Santa Rosa as you
pleaseâ you will have a bis time at either.
Cripple Creek now understands that
there is such a thing as beintr too red hot.
Democracy claims to be looking for a
Moses, but it is really hunting around for a
golden calf.
Gorman in the role of au economist has
shown himself one of the best comedians
in the Senate.
There is already enough compressed sir
in the democratic National machine to
run it or bust it.
The fake journalism that demoralizes
trade can be ruaue a losing trade if tiie
merchants combine.
Democracy mny j'et decide to fling
Cleveland into the ring again by way of
throwing up the sponge.
California should no tuSt. Louis pledged
only to the Republican party, the National
â¢welfare and the interests of the Pacific
Coast.
Protection to American industry in its
fullest scope is protection to American
civilization and the social development of
the people.
Spring in the East has brought an un
usual number of cyclones, flood3 and bliz
zards, but in the meantime we rejoice in
our festivals.
In the new French Cabinet Premier M.
Meline will hold the portfolio of agricul
ture, aral there is bonietning in the fact
that is significant of j^eace.
Barnev Barnato believes that by shutting
down his mines in the Transvaal he can
make the Boers open their eyes to the sit
uation, and perhaps hs can.
The Cripple Creek method o! dealing
with fire-thieves by shooting them on the
spot was rather lawless, but it seems to
have suited the occasion it was made for.
Having received the indorsement of the
Democratic Convention in Pennsylvania
the Pattison boom is now a little bigger
than Harrity's mouth, but not much big
ger.
The only logical solution of the Demo
cratic problem this year is for the conserv
ative members to join the Republicans
and let the otner fellows go to the Popu
lists...
England may well rejoice in her surplus
â¢while she has it, for her chances of finding
big Trars on her hands before the year is
over are liabilities that may reduce it
before !ong.
The Kelly-Mahoney combination did
not get on the rolJ as they expected, but
all the same they got a roll on that will
land them in the mud when the State Con
vention meet 1 ?.
Since they have indorsed the Cleveland
administration uny one who refers to the
Democrats among the Micliiganders here
aiter will put the emphasis very strongly
on the "ganders."
After hunting around Democracy has
found a number of candidates ready to
enter the Presidential race, but, unfor
tunately none of them belong to the
Presidential class.
The Boera may bluster a good deal about
the British and American miners who
have developed the wealth of the Rand,
but they are too wise to kill the goose that
lays the golden eggs.
The Kelly and Mahoney combination
vociferously asserts itself to be a supporter
of McKinley, but to the wiser friends of
the Ohio statesman it seems more like a
dead weight on the movement.
Whatever may be said by the partisans
of the various favorites among Republican
candidates, the rank and file of the party
Jcnow tbat an unpledged delegation of
strong men is the common-sense of the
situation.
Wolcott's letter expresses the senti
ments of the great mass of Republican
bimelallists. It would be better to have a
Republican administration, even wittj the
gold standard, than to turn the country
over to Democratic bunglers or unbal
anced Populists.
As an illustration of the way in which
Southern Democrats are getting together
for the campaign it is worth noting that
the Richmond (Va.) Times says: "Bland
is an admirable specimen of the humbug
and winabag to put in the lead of such a
Falsiaflian, Moldy, Shadow, Wart, Feeble
and Bull-calf party as the Missouri conven
tion would make of the Democratic party."
In the whoie course of the discussion
concerning the attitude which the Cali
fornia delegation should take at St. Louis
there has not been advanced a single valid
argument by those who desire that the
delegation ehaii stand for one man in
antagonism to all others, and who urge
that the delegation be pledged to vole for
that man first, last and all the time.
All that has been said by those who
favor guch a pledged delegation is that
California bas a favorite among Republi
cai. candidates for the Presidency and that
her representatives at the National Con
vention should not even consider the
claims of any other. It requires an ex
treme Dersonal partisan to see any wisdom
in a policy of that kind. U it were car
ried out ia every State in the Union there
would be no advantage at all in holding a
National Convention. Everything in the
form of deliberation, counsel and careful
study of the situation would be set aside
and men voting from preferences, passions
or prejudices would determine the leader
ship and the policy of the party without
regard to great National considerations.
Fortunately the extreme partisans of
any particular candidate are not suffi
ciently strong to dominate the Republican
party of California at this juncture. The
common-sense of the majority has begun
to assert itself and is made evident through
the voices of the press and interviews
with prominent Republicans of all sections
of the State. These men differ in their
personal preferences. Allison, Cullotn,
McKinley, Morton and Keed have each
earnest supporters among them. All of
them, however, see the advantage to Cali
fornia of having an uninstructed delega
tion at the convention, and that advantage
they are too wise to forego.
As the discussion proceeds, this view of
the case becomes more and more appre
ciated by the rank and tile of the party.
The one way of faithfully representing
California Repubiicani.^m is by sending to
8t. Louis a delegation of strong men, un
plfdged and un trammeled. That is what
should be done, and all signs now point to
the conclusion that it will be done.
In his letter to Irving W. Howbert,
chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee of Colorado, Senator Wolcott lays
down a rule of conduct that seems ad
mirably to meet the diHiculties presented
by a divergence of views on tqe silver
question. Although written as a sugges
tion to the Republicans of Colorado, who
are unanimous for free silver, it applies
equally well to all other silver Republi
cans. He says:
When the Republican State Convention
meets on May 14 it may aeciine to be repre
sented at St. Louis or it may select delegates.
It" the latter, the duty of the delegation, in
my opinion, will be to attend the convention,
make the host fight possible for bimetallism
in the committee on resolutions and on the
floor of the convention, if there shall be an
opportunity for discussion oefore the whole
convention, and after having insisted by every
proper method upon the duty of the con
vention to declare in favor of the restoration
of silver as a measure of valne equally with
gold, to acceDt the will of the majority of the
convention and endeavor to secure the nomi
nation of the candidate most friendly to West
ern interests.
There is no sacrifice I would not make to se
cure the remonetization of silver, both because
in my opinion prosperity will never return to
us until bimetallism at the former ratio is re
established and because the appreciating
value of gold and the shrinkage of the values
which necessarily follow this appreciation
must bring only disaster and poverty and
suffering to all the people of this country who
Rre not lenders of money. To secure the un
limited coinage of silver, I would count carty
ties as nothing. At this moment, however, the
situation which confronts us is this: Both of
the two great parties are apparemly opposed
to free coinage by the United States. The
Populist party favors free coinage, but only as
a means to secure more currency and as a
stepping-stone to unlimited paper money, and
it unites with its free coinage advocacy social
istic and paternalistic doctrines which are
daugerous in tendency and which would be, if
adopted, destructive of free institutions.
This exhibits a true party spirit and
means that the comprehensive aims of the
Republican party are too great and of too
vital interest to the welfare of the country
to be destroyed by factional dissension.
At the same time, astute as Senator Wol
cott is known to be, there is a chance of
error on his part when he assumes that
"the two great parties are apparently op
posed to free coinage by the United
States." In any event it is the duty of
free-silver Republicans to make as hard
and persistent a fizht as is possible with
out disrupting the party, trusting to time
and to the pressure of their influence
within the ranks of the party to win a
peaceful victory in the end.
The reports from the floral festival now
being held at Redwood City show that the
intelligent residents of San Mateo County
have bounded at a leap into the front
rank of progressive citizens, who under
stand the value of these festivals and ap
preciate the opulence of the material
which nature has placed at their disposal.
A queen serving as a perfect complement
to the beauty and grace of the flowers is
already in possession of the town, wield
ing her floral scepter with imperious
grace and puissance, and the coronation
ball was an event to be remembered. The
festival will come to a close to-morrow.
The fact that the festival is held for a
local charitable purpose removes from it
somewnat that broader aspect observable
in festivals heid for the general advance
ment of the community. That, however,
is merely a surface view. The people
have proved just as responsive and their
efforts have been as prodigal of artistic
and picturesque results as though their
carnival had been planned on broader
lines. As San Mateo County contains a
generous share of the wealthy people who
povern the destinies of San Franci.sco, it is
uncommonly well equipped to make a fes
tival of this kind an exceptionally attract
ive affair.
In indorsing ex-Congressman Eland for
the Democratic nomination for President
the Democracy of Missouri emphasizes its
right to be called the biggest fool wing of
all the wings of the general parly. If the
Republican party were not absolutely sure
of having more electoral votes than it will
have any use for, the nomination of Mr.
Bland would be most weicome, but as it is
it would make victory too easy to give
spirit and energy to the campaign. The
Republican nominee will want to see
some show of opposition to bis election,
otherwise the race would grow unsuffer
ably monotonous.
Aside from being something of a bimetal
list, in vhich he shoyrs that a few gleams
of the light of advancing civilization has
penetrated his denBe Bourbonism, Mr.
Bland is as closely wedded to untenable
economic principles as one could be. He
still breathes the same kind of political
atmosphere that inspired James Buchanan,
and he believes that moss upon one's back
is necessary to a clear and comprehensive
understanding of ti.e science of govern
ment. But in that he is not far behind
Carlisle, Gorman, Morrison and the score
or more other aspirants for the honor of
being knocked out by the nominee of the
St. Louis convention.
Putting aside the better phases of his
theory of a financial system for this coun
try, which are really sound and sensible
in spots, Mr. Biand has always been a
consistent Democrat in supporting his
party's time-worn opposition to the doc
trine that the world moves and that civil
ization does not advance with the wrong
end to. Mr. Bland is an extremist on the
tariff question. He would turn all cus
tom-houses into free storage places for
foreign pauper labor made commodities,
and he would cordially invite India and
Argentina to fetch their wheat to our
mills to be ground into flour for American
consumption. But after all Mr. Bland is
a representative Dencocrat, except that he
is not a gold monometallic, as are nearly
all the leaders of that party. The Dem
ocracy of Missouri makes a fool of itself in
trying to create a great statesman out of a
backwoods politician. Nevertheless, Mr.
Bland ought to be deemed eligible to make
application for the Chicago nomination,
even if it is the fact that what little lie
knows about the science of finance is all he
knows about any question of .National in
terest.
The Colorado Senator Scores Populists
and "Bows" Himself.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The letter of Senator Wolcott of Colorado,
which appeared in the news columns of The
Call tnis morning (April 30). is a notable pro
duction and challenges attention; but within
the limits of a brief letter It is impossible to
consider it in detail, as I would Imj only too
glad to do. I note the fact that it was trans
mitted from Washington while the great de
bate between his colleague, Senator Teller, and
Senator Sherman of Ohio on the silver issue
was in progress, and I quite agree with Senator
Sherman, the ablest Champion of the gold
standard of values, that "'the time has come
fora linal settlement of the silver question by
the people"; and 1 further ugree with him that
"each party should BtSte its position honestly
aud manfully." In this view of political duty
Senator Sreriuan is in full accord with the
gold-standard advocates ia both of the old par
ties.
S nator Wolcott declines the issue, although
he represent* a silver Slate, and declares in
his letter that. "There is no sacrifice I would
not make to secure the remomtizatinn of sil
ver.' aud again that. "To secure the unlimi'ed
coinage of silver 1 woold count party ties as
nothing.'' One would say that Senator Wol
cott is explicit enough, and that the logic of
his position, thus explicitly stated, would
place him Inside Senator Teller, who said in
debate with Senator Sherman that when his
party ceased to represent the views he held to
be paramount to the country's weltare he
would cease to act with his party. He had
helped to form the Republican party by leav
ing the Deniocraiic party, In compliance with
this principle, and if his party now declares
for the gold standard he will leave his party.
Hut Senator Wolcott declines this issue also.
Up finds nimself "between the devil (the Popu
list party) and the deep sea" (political ob
livion), and he becks to make his way to safety
by the same means so successiullv employed
by Senator Hill of New York, who in per
plexity lias alwavs found a way out by ex
claiming, "1 am a Democrat."
"Under these circumstances and condi
tions," says Senntor Wolcott, "1 desire to be
counted a.- a Republican." and assures us that
he is "still hopeful" that his party "may on
this great economic question yet rank itself
on the side ot humanity and civilization," and
trusts that "some common ground may be
found upon which bimetallists untainted "with
Populism may Mnnd."
Just how n ucli "hope" and "trust" he may
have that his party "may yet rank itself on
the side of humanity and civilization" can be
â MO In this statement: "At this moment the
situation which confronts us is this: Both of
the two great panks are apparently opposed
to free coinage by the United States," and he
bows to the will of the gold-standard majority.
Quite as a matter ol course Senator Woleott
pays Mime attention to the Populists. "The
Populist party favors free coinage," he says,
"but only as a means to secure more currency
and as a ttepplng-stoM to unlimited paper
monty." Hut he iailed to move this to be a
fair sta'enient by quoting the Populist Na
tionfil platform adopted at Omaha, in which
the third section of the linanciai flunk reads
as follows:
'â¢We demand that the amount of circulating
medium," including gold, silver and paper,
"be speedily increased to not less than $50 per
capita," the estimated volume of money in
circulation at the close of the Civil
War, the era of greatest prosperity ever
known in t.'iis couutrv, as Senator Wol
cott himself will freely admit. If that means
â¢"unlimited paper money" Senator Wolcott
may find that a surprisingly large number of
intelligent American citizeis are quite ready
to vote for it. It would seem that Senator
Wol colt has so little respect for Populists that
he is willing to put himself on record over his
own signature as capable of making a gross
u-raent of their" position on tbe money
question, which any intelligent man will
know to be false and intentionally misleading
by simply reading the Ornaha platform. A
man of senator Wolcott's conceded ability and
his high position is in a bad way who can re
sort to such puerile tactics in order to excuse
himself for bowing to the will of the gold
standard majority when he represents a silver
State. Poor Wolcott! Poor Pettigrew! Barely
the cause of "humanity and civilization" will
prosper with Kuch faithful champions aud
brave defenders.
But these dangerous Populists arÂ« not to be
let off by Senator Wolcott merely by a gro.^s
misstntement and perversion of their position
on the money question. A* a further excuse
for his desertion of the constituency which
sent him to the Senate of the United States to
protoct and defend their Interests as a State,
waxing warm and growing bold he relieves his
feelings in these withering words: "Thare is,
in my opinion, one event which might involve
our country in worse disaster than mono
metallism, and only one, and that would be the
triumph of Populism." Of course there is a
chariuble view which fair-mindi-d men
can take of Senator Woicott's statÂ«- of mind and
it is this: If be has no mure delinitu knowledge
or better understanding of the principles of
the Populist party than lie displays in stating
their financial demands nil men of generous
impulse will readily excuse him in his hour of
weakness wiien he yielded to the syren of the
gold standard and humbly Petttgrewod him
self, for in his present Mate of mind it would
seem unkind to hold him to a strict account

One of the best known men of the Northwest

Ex-Mayor Konald is a Democrat of a pro
nounced type. He is also a laryer. The gen
tleman came from Missouri in 1S75 and settled
at Lincoln, near Sacramento. In 1832, im
pelled by the boom in Washington growing
out of the building oi the Northern Pacific
road, he moved to Seattle, then as now the
largest place in Washington. It had, as Mr.
Konald said yesterday, between 0000 and 70UO
peqpli-.
'â¢Sow, as near as I can figure it," he said,
"we have about 55,000 or 50,000. We did
have about 00,000, but the dull times lessened
the number some, and between 3000 and 4000
have gone to Alaska.
"There has been great interest in these
Alaska mines. Old-time residents at Seattle
tell me there has been nothing like it since
the Fraser River excitement. Steamer after
Eteamer has been thronged wila men, and
schooners were brought into requisition. Even
then the men who wanted to go couldn't pet
off. There were too many. S tea nib hip owners
had to stop selling tickets.

Yrrka Journal.
As the time draws near for our State and.Con
gressional Conventions to meet at Sacramento,
the sentiment ol nearly the entire press of the
State eeems to favor sending an unpledged
delegation to St. Louis. Wuile many stanch
Republican newspapers throughout the State
have a personal preference among the promi
nent men mentioned for Presidential honors,
yet they believe in placing their own personal
desire in the background and act for the best
interest of the State. A delegation which is
hampered by pledges is never in a position to
do anything for their State, unless their man is
fortunate enough to receive the nomination,
and even then oftentimes they receive little
consideration, as everything worth having ia
given away to gain the support of those who
are working in the interest of some other can
didate. It is very much like a man throwing
all the bouquets to his opponents, feeling that
his friends will be loyal at Â«ny rate, but some
times they learn to their t-orrow that the
friends like an occasional bouquet.
If the California delegation is sent un
pledged the cnanees are fuvorable for Califor
nia naming a Cabinet officer, which would
doubtless be of uniol.l benefit to this State. The
big fight niftiif to bring the National Conven
tion to San FrancD-co and the visit of a num
ber of men of National reputation to our
shores, has brought the great resources and
needs for their development under the notice
of our Eastern friends, and If we can get a
good man in a Cabinet position, together with
the attention we have already attracted, we
would certainly obtain a great deal of benefit.
A pledged delegation is almost sure to earn
the enmity of the candidates they are not sup
porting, and when they finally see their man
cannot get in, and are compelled to go into
another camp, they do so with a feeling that
they are of very little consequence, and are
usually treated accordingly.
We have good, honest, upright men in the
Republican party in this State, who can be in
trusted to work for our interests. They are
personally interested in the welfare of the
State, and are familiar with all the principles
which are essential to the prosperity of the
country and to California. We don't want to
select these men and then tell them that we
cannot trust them or rely upon them to do
what is right, but we must lay out a pro
gramme which they must follow regardless of
consequence*. The press of this State has
spoken for an unpledged delegation, and
when the press makes a fight for anything
they usually get it, so we believe we are abso
lutely safe in predicting that California's dele
gation will go to St. Louis free to do a; they in
their judgment believe is for the best interest
of the State, ami if their efforts shall result in
gaining nothing for us we can at least feel
that they ucted honestly and with the highest
motives, which they are sure to do when in
trusted with our confidence.
The Tali, is making a vigorous effort to have
the detection from this State go to the Na
tional -Republican Convention uninBtructed.
It claims, ana rightly, too, that the delegation
will have more influence in the convention
for California's future interests if the members
are left free to art after they reach St. Louis.
If the delegates go instructed for any man
they cut no figure in the contest, as they are
counted beforehand; but if they arc there to
deliberate and select the best and most avail
able man they will be consulted, and can get
con.cessions.from the loaders of any candidate
who desires their vote. The (alt. wishes a
member ot the Cabinet for California. This
State is entitled to a Cabinet position no matter
which party may succeed at the polls, Dut it
will never get even the promise of such a po
sition if the delegate vote to the National Con
vention is instructed and thus pledged before
hand to support some particular candidate.
This applies to the Democrnts and Pooulists
as well. The result of the Presidential cam
paign cannot be foretold. The people of "the
United States are apt to surprise the politicians,
and the assured air of victory which the Re
publican press now assumes may be changed
after they hear the people's verdict. It will be
well, then, (or California if all political par
ties send their wisest and best men to repre
sent them in the National conventions, with
the view to select the best men as candidates
and to secure reroanitioa for the State in (he
coming administration.

TnK Call is agitating the sending of an un
pledged delegation to the Republican Nation
al Convention at St. Louis. It claims that it
would have more weight and might possibly
dictate who would be the standard bearerâ
that is, if the contest is close, and they have
the balance of power. They would then be in
position to make terms and could at least get
a Cabinet office for this State. Heretofore
this coast has been ignored at Washington, all
because we had no pull with the powers that

We believe with Thb Call that In
the event of the election of a Republican
President the chances will be excellent for a
seat in the Cabinet coming to California if an
unpledged delegation is sent to the National
Convention. It doesn't take but one good eye
to see the weakness and impotence of a delega
tion that is tied hand and foot by a Pledge.
This is not on our side of the nouse and is not
our pir, but we would like to see California in
a yos tion to command recognition from the
next President, whether he is to be a Demo
crat or Republican.

DEVELOPING GOLD PROPERTIES.
What the Gold Hnmta Eichakge Propose
Doing.
To the Editor of the Han Francisco Callâ Sir:
Your timely editorial of the '27th inst., headed
'â¢Gold Mining Prospects," is clearly on the line
of work laid out by the Gold Mining Exchange.
To select and examine meritorious properties
will be its direct purpose. The monev re
ceived from the Bale of tnese shares will be
applied only to development purposes, and
correct reports will be regula r ly furnished to
stockholders and the public. To avoid compli
cations stock which may be subscribed for at a
stated bedrock price will be held in escrow by
the company, receipts beinn given in their stead
until such time as the mine is paying its own
expenses. Sufficient treasury stoek being thus
provided for all necessary development work
and the erection of tbe most improved ma
chinery, assessments will not be necessary.
\Vith the exchange to guard over the funds of
the company, a guarantee of safety will be
spread about ihe investors.
The well-known frieudliness of The Call to
the mining industry and its lurge circulation
and Influence throughout the coast will be the
means of great assistance to the Gold Mining
Exchange in its efforts for the development
and exploitation of many of our great gold
properties now lying idle for want of capital.
Very truly, Walter Turnbull.

Anxiety is felt for another of the New- :
castle (N. S. W.) coal fleet. This time it is ;
the Craigmore, sist*r ship to the unfortu
nate Blairnjore now at the bottom of Mis
sion Bay. She is out : 88 days, and 40 per
cent reinsurance has f : been paid on her.
Coal men have faith that she will turn up,
however, a? ; her cargo is from the Greta
mine, and that is a coal ; that. ;^so; far. has
never caueht fire. When 40 per cent re
insurance is paid, however, it shows : that
the underwriters have become frightened
over the losses on the Alexandra;
and Republic.

Clever Ruse of Mrs. Golding,
Who Was One of His
Sureties.
She Got Him to Accompany Her to
Judge Low's Court and Sur
rendered Him.
A lady and two men entered Judge Low's
courtroom yesterday afternoon while a
case vasjin jprogress and created a mild
sensation by .interrupting the proceedings.
V'T want to surrender this man." said
the lady; excitedly, as she jabbed her fore
finger several times on the shoulder of one
of the men. "This is Frank Stocking and
Lam on his bond."
"Come here, Stocking," said the Judge
{ from the bench, and Stocking, who seemed
struck dumb with surprise, walked me
chanically forward, followed by the lady,
who was Mrs. Golding.
There was a brief conversation and the
Judge ordered the bailiff to take Stocking
to the City Prison.
Stocking, alias Williams, was arrested
some weeks ago on the charge of perjury.
He went on a bond accepted by Judge
Conlan in which he declared he was the
owner of property on Octavia street. An
investigation by Judge Conlan revealed
the fact that Stocking did not own the
property, hence his arrest.
The case is on Judge Low's calendar for
to-day. His sureties, Mrs. Golding and
George Duffield, became alarmed that he
might not face his trial, and yesterday
tney went to him and prevailed upon him
to accompany them to court, telling him
the case was to be heard yesterday instead
of to-day. Then Mrs. Golding sprang her
surprise upon him.

evident that it will soon regain some of its old
spirit. In tne circular to iho members the
committee says: "As we very seldom come to

Proceedings Looking to the Pur

Improvement Clubs to Receive Ass'st
ance From the Old Jewish
Cemeteries.
The Mission Improvement Club is deter
mined to leave no stone unturned in se
curing for the residents of Sunshine Val
ley a park out of the next appropriation
levied by the Supervisors.
To accomplish this end the improve
ment club, through its executive commit
tee, sent a written communication to L.
Brown, president of the Jliils of Eternity,
and Abraham Anspacher, president of the
Home of Peace, the two cemeteries which
the improvement club are anxious to se
cure for park purposes. The letters con
tained a request for a friendly exchange
of ideas as to the price for which the ceme
teries association would be wiJling to sell
the property.
in response to this invitation the presi
dents met Messrs. Mag-uire, Center and
â \Valker of the improvement club and ex
pressed their willingness not only to sell
the property for the purpose^itended, but
promised to make the price as low as possi
ble. They could not state at what price
the property could be offered until the
1 subject should bÂ« brought before the ceme
j :eries association, which they promised to
I do at an early date.
Both Messrs. Brown and Anspacher
j have issued a call for a meeting of the
i board of directors of their respective asso
: ciations for the early part of next wet k, at
which definite conclusions will be arrived
i nt and a price fixed at which the propertv
will be offered to the City.
When this is clone the Mission Club
will present the facts to the Supervisors
and ask that the amount be included in
next year's tax levy. ;
The views of botti the presidents of the
cemeteries were expressed yesterday.
Mr. Brown said; "Speaking for the Hills
of Eternity association, I am in favor of
selling the property to the City 'or park
purposes cheaper ttian I would to private
individuals. On no account will I be a
party to placing a fancy price upon the
ground simply because it is sought for by
the people. We are willing to bear our
pro rata of taxes for public improvements
â and I must say that this is one of tnat
class which meets my most hearty in
dorsement.
"The Mission people are entitled to a
public park, to a high school and to many
other things asked for by this improve
ment club. I will bring this matter be
fore tne directors at the next meeting, and
a selling price will be fixed at which the
property will be offered. "'
The same sentiments were expressed by
Mr. Anspachcr, when spoken to, and he
also promised to bring the quesa'on before
tte directors of his association at a meet
ing called lor next week-
Judge Van Reynegum is of the opinion
that the property can be purchased at a
less figure by the City than if offered at
public auction.

Judge Coffey Clearly Defines
the Powers of a
Trustee.
Heirs Need Not Abide by Improper
Investments Made With Their
Funds.
Trustees under wills probated in Judge
Coffey's court havejhad a few pointers Riven
to them from the bench, in a decision
rendered yesterday in the adjusting of the
accounts of John Berminghani and 8. T.
Spence, who were trustees under the will
of A. H. 'Wilcox. The estate amounted to
over $600,000.
Spence died some years ago, and Berm
ingham continued to serve aJone. When
the heir came of age and the accounts of
the estate were investigated it was found
that $10,0S5 had been invested in San Luis
Obispo Bituminous Rock Company's
bonds. These bonds the heir refused to
accept, and it was might to make Berm
ingham liable for the amount. Berming
ham maintained that the court had no
right to review the acts of a trustee under
a will, and besides that, he said the bonds
had been purchased by Spence without his
knowledge, as they ha'd agreed to manage
separate parts of the estate.
Judge Coffey said the trustees should
have acted tosether, and he held Berming
ham liable for the money. In doing so he
said :
The theory of counsel is that trustees can
do what they please with trust propertyâ give
the children what they like, and it concerns
nobody. It istdangerous doctrine, surely, but
it is not true doctrine in equity or law. There
is nothing in the will that absolves the trus
tees from liability from loss through improper
investments or relieves them from using good
judgment nnd sound discretion tn the per
formance of their trust. In making invest
ments they are required to obey the law, and
they will not be permitted to say they are
above the law. The court would be derelict in
its duty if It undertook *.o force him to accept
the reminiscence of an era of inflation and
speculation for the substantial coin his father
left him. â  â¢>"."'

Rev. Dr. Birch, the Noted Eng
lish Divine, Coming
Here.
For Fifteen Years His Pulpit Oratory
Drew Audiences of 5,000 in
Manchester. : ; .
Calvary Presbyterian Church is to have
a new pastor for a month; beginning prob
ably with the second Sunday in May.
The Rev. Dr. John Hemphill is goine
away for a vacation and the great English
divine, the Rey. Dr. Willis in Lincoln
Birch, has offered to fill the pulpit in his
absence.
Dr. Birch only recently arrived in this
State. He came here from New Zealand
primarily in search of a climate tr>at
j might benerit his wife's delicate health.
I 'r. Hemphill says that his temporary
successor comes more highly recom
mended than any other man he knows of.
That great English clergyman, the late
Charles H. Spurgeon, wrote of him: "He
[Birch] has done as mnch In the ministry
and in orphanage work as the foremost
man in England, and all upon the most
self-denying terms." And John D. Con
nolly, United States Consul in New Zea-
I land, also wrote: "No man has more gen
erally extended the right had of fellowship
to the poor and lowly than Pastor Birch
durine his ministry in New Zealand."
For lifteen years he preached in the his
toric Manchester Free-trade Hall, where
he had a constant congregation of 5000 per
sona, attracted by his remarkable powers
as a pulpit orator. Later be went to New
I Zealand as the successor of the Rev.
Thomas Spurgeon, at Auckland.
At present the Rev. Dr. Birch is in Los
Angeles, where he is studying the fruit in
dustry with the intention of working up a
. fruit trade with the Australian colonies.
j His idea is to have dried and canned fruits
j shipped directly from California instead of
; from England."
He is also working on an all around the
! world ABC guidebook, which he pur
poses soon to publish.

Appointed Inspector of Sidewalks
by the Board of Super

ORDINANCE TO BE ENFORCED.
Contracts for Street Work Recom
mended by the Committee
Yesterday.
The necessity of a more complete in
spection of sidewalks in this City, and the
more rigid enforcement of the laws relat
ing to them has led the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors to waste no
time in appointing a successor to John W.
Reid, the inspector who oied recently, and
at yesterday's meeting of the committee
George W. Elder was named for the place,
subject to the approTal of the board at its
meeting on Monday next; . . .
â  Numerous complaints have been made
of late regarding violations of the sidewalk
ordinance. Citizens and taxpayers have
objected to the manner in which the side
walks have been fenced in where new
buiidings were being constructed, and to
the numerous obstructions in the way of
merchandise and empty packing-case*
that have been allowed to block up the
sidewalks in the business portion of the
City. â â ;â â â -'â  .â ;':â  >;â :â :,/â â â ;â ; â  Â£.;-C.; > 'â :â  :' . ' :â 
Mr. Elder has for sonie time been the
pavement expert of the Street Committee,
paid by Chairman Spreckels out of his own
pocket, and will probably fill both posi
tions in the future. . .
Some conflict with Superintendent of
Streets Ashworth regarding the payment
of the salary of $100 a month. Hied by the
committee, is expected, as the Superin
tendent and the new appointee are not on
the best of termn, and the former has al
ways contended that the Supervisors have
no right to make such an appointment,
because the salary comÂ»s out of the Street
Department funds, and no special provi
sion has been made for it. Should the
Superintendent refuse to sign Elder's sal
ary* demands the next tax levy will prob
ably contain a provision for the office.
The committee deci<ied to recommend
the awarding of street work as follows:
Sewer in Bryant, from Twentieth to
Twenty-first, Daniel Kelleher, for $500;
grading ot M street 9611m from Twelfth to
â  Thirteenth, to M. C. Hogan, $2500; paving
with bitumen of Cherry, from Hacramento
to Clay. Robinson Nugent, $2500; also
Laurel, from Sacramento to California,

Columbia building in high glee. . ; 'â /; -;,â â

church. ;.= : - -".'..â¢â¢'â .â  '-:.C-;'' : :. "''>->-:
They speculated as to the identity of the
new pastor, but no one was mentioned for
that position, according to Dr. : McDonald's
statement, and nothing had been done or
was on foot looking toward the â¢â¢ naming of
' a successor to the vacant pastorate.'. â¢ â¢ ; :
: â¢ In fact the doctor, \vho has been at the
bead of the anti-Brown forces for months
past,, did not seem , to know any ' more
about the affairs of the church than the
elevator boy. K ; ' .
iS Deacon Morse denied the report that
there hitd been . a meeting of D:. Brown's
friends yesterday morning. lie said that
Dr. Brown would occupy the pulpit on]
Sund.iv and that the deacons would meet
I sometime next week and talk over the
| matter of a successor to the ex-pastor.
I Tims iar nothing had been done.
The resignation, he added, had come
j upon the membership as a surprise ana
j nothing whatever had been done regard
i ing plans for the future. He had not
heard any person spoken of as a successor
to the doctor.
"Although this whole sad affair has
been the occasion of much talk and scan
j dal," said Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, "I re
j gard its outcome wit'u satisfaction. The
| First Congregational Church will now
[ have an opportunity to recover the ground
1 it has Io3t iu the past four months. If tne
DuDuque Conference wants Dr. Brown
they are privileged to take him. The con
tention of his friends that the affair re
sulted in a victory for him is ludicrous.
He is to-dav without a church, and he has
no ofiicial standing in Congregationalism.
Is that a victory? lam glad the matter
is ended. I never pursued Dr. Brown in a
spirit of vindictiveness, but I desired that
truth should prevail. I was opposed to
Dr. Brown because I haa irrefutable evi
dence of his guilty acts, not because I had
any personal enmity toward h:m.
"The 29th of the month," added Mrs.
Cooper, '"seems to be Dr. Brown's un
lucky day. The doctor's complaint against '
Mrs. Davidson, which opened the scandal,
was filed on the 1'itth of last December; on
the 29th of the following month I ap
peared on the scene, and to wind up the
whole unfortunate affair Dr. Brown pre
sented his resignation on the -"^th of
April. If he is at all superstitious he will
decide to give the 29tb day of each mouth
a irtde berth in future."
"Only a noble man, inch as Dr. Brown
is recognized to be, ?;ould dare take the
stand which he took and held," remarked
Charles G. Nagle, barrister-at-law, the ex
pastor's attorney.
"He sacrificed himself in order to avert
dissension, and while acting solely for the
benefit of the church, managed to cover
himself with glory and honor."
Other prominent members of the church
expressed themselves for or against their
late spiritual father, but no one, so far aa
learned, Went s^> far as to accuse the Kev.
Dr. Brown of managing his case in n
.bungling fashion. The general verdict of
friends and foes was:
"Dr. Brown can hold his own and keep
his head as hich as ever."

The lecture was devoted to a discussion

machinery in which a loose screw renders
harmonious action impossible. , .- â ":'
"; "Those who are familiar with machinery, .
whether it be a sewing-machine, . a .. mow
ing-machine or a steam engine," said the
lecturer, "Know that a loose screw | affects
the running of the machine, causes un
steady motion or a pounding of the loose
joints, and. sometimes makes so much
'noise that. the loose point is plainly . dis
cerned. Again, the screw may be so hid- â¢

The Rose Show Opens as an

Rare Blossoms.
WITH SIX HUNDRED VARIETIES
A Un : que Display of Flowers From
Historical Gardens cf the
State.
The ordinarily beautiful Maple and
Marble rooms of the Palace Hotel have
been converted into a temporary conserva
tory, in which all the choicest roses and
other flowering products of amateur and
professional gardens are artistically dis
played in almost endless variety.
It is the thirteenth semi-annual Kose
Show of the State Floral Society, an or
ganization the sole aim of /which is to en
courage the cultivation of home gardens
and the propagation of new and beautiful
flowers. And the great increase in varie
ties due to ambitious competitors is one of
the best evidences of the succesa of the
society's efforts.
Primarily the object of the show is not
the encouragement ol professional florists,
but their exhibitions set a standard that
furnifhes the amateur an object lesson,
ana at the same time indicates what may
be accomplished in the way of new varie
ties. ' :â¢.:." â â â â ;â -.. '.â¢: :â¢;' . â¢ ; â  â  â â .â 'â  ;â 
Probably the most attractive large dis
play is that of John H. Sievers, who has
on exhibition seventy-five enormously de
veloped new seedling carnations tnat have
yet to be named and a number of exquisite
orchids and other tropical flowers and del
icate ferns. But the great long-sternmed
carnations, with their extremely unusual
colorings, are a noteworthy feature of the
show.
Then there is the large exhibit from
Golden Gate Park, occupying the entire
end of the Marble room, and including as
spec! Â» features the Cocas Weddelena, the
most delicate and dainty of all the palm?,
and the caricature plaut, with its little
Humanlike faces doited all over its large,
beautifully veined clothlike leaves that
| rival fancy dress patterns in their attrac
tive appearance. \ 'â â 'â .-â - :-.'-
John Rock has an exhibit of all kinds
of flowering shrubs and Professor Emory ;
E. Smith of Palo Alto, the manager of the \
committee of arrangements, says it is the
finest display of the kind ever made in
California. It includes tue historical
Breath of Heaven, ribbon grass, and many
shrubs combining variations of nearly all
the primary colors. But these are not all.
There are in the same exhibit over 1U0 va
rieties of roses.
Whatever may be the poetic suggestive
ness of the flower-bedecked and lragrant
rooms there is one little table that has
about it a sentiment greater than that as
sociate! with all the others combined.
Mrs. W. S. Chandler, California's most ex
tensive collector of wild flowers, has con
ceived the idea of displaying flowera from
ail the historical places in California, from
gardens that have old romantic associa- i
tions or that have witnessed some event |
in the early history of the Golden State. ;
For instance, there is a great cluster ol i
rich Cloth of Gold roses from a foriy-vear- j
ola bush in the old Larkin garden in Mon
terev, where the papers were signed an
nexing California to the Union.
Mrs. L. O. Hodgkins has a unique dis
play of nice varieties of flowery cacti tuat
lorms a particularly beautiful collection of
rare blossoms.
Then passing over the great display of
roses, for there are 600 varieties on exhibi
tion, and mentioning oniy briefly some of
the individual flowers as examples, there
is the fragrant and delicate white San
Juan flower from Mexico; rhododendrons
in great variety and in wonderful color
ings; white, pin k-sV/eaked and delicately
tinted clematis; "Mrs. Cleveland," a beau
tiful new California eeedling rose of a rich
red; the "Rainbow," a California product
from the Papa Gontier; a new rose with
waxy. Dink petals liqhtly streaked with
blood red; the "Bell Sicbrick," a new
Eastern *ose first exhibited in California,
and bavin-; rich, pale pink petals; "La
France de '89," a La France rose of dark
wine color, while the original of the name
is so different; azalias originally from the
slopes of the Himalaya Mountains, and
others from China, purple, A'hite, sainion,
cream, magenta, lavender; the "Rosa Ru
gosa," a peculiar wine-colored California
seedling single rose from the Japanese va
riety; new .-jiant California seedling;
white Marguerites with stems a vard lonÂ»r;
a first exhibit by Professor Emory E.
Smith of a variety to be introduced'next
year.
Amateur exhibitors whose display? are
particular features of the 6how are Mrs.
E. Lewellyn of San Lorenzo, with a fine
array of peonies, clematis, rhododendrons
and roses; Mrs. Theo Sachan, also of San
Lorenzo, with a collection of 150 varieties
of roses; Mrs. W. H. Smith of Berkeley,
roses; Charles Alborn of Alameda, with a
very large collection of roses, carnations
and pelargoniums, and Mrs. Stanley
Stephenson of Alameda, fine roses.
Some of the flower-lovers prominent at
yesterday's preliminary exhibit were: D.
J. Staples, John L. Howard, Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, Mrs. W. C. Burnett, Eiisha
Brooks, principal of the Girls' High School;
Supervisor Der.man, Dr. Behr of the Acad
emy ol Sciences, Mr. and Mrs. Rockwood
of Chicago, Mrs. Laura Immery of Grand
Uapiils, Mich., Dr. F. I. Forman, John I.

B. N. Rowley, Mrs. Horatio Stebbins, Mrs.
Austin Sperfy, O. D. Baldwin, Dr. John
Wagner, Dr. Charles Bri^-ham, Mrs.
Charles B. Dean.
To-day will see the exhibit completed in
all its details and perfected whera the late
storm made yesterday's display slightly
backward. All in all, it is pronounced the
equal of the Lest show yet given, and that
in the face of climatic difficulties.

One of the Questions for the
Methcdist Episcopal Con
ference.
TO OPEN TO-DAY IN OHIO.
Shall Delrgates of the Weaker Sex
Be Seated or Rej-cted ?â A
Vexing Problem.
The General Conference of the Metho
dist Episcopal Cnurch will open to-day in
Cleveland, Ohio. Many people prominent
in the Methodist Episcopal Church of this
State will be among the delegates and
visitors.
The General Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal Church meets once in four years.
It is composed of about 600 delegatesâ 200
laymen and 400 ministers. While the
ministerial delegates ars in the majority,
yet the laymen may. demand a separate
vote on any question, and such question
cannot be passed unless a majority of the
laymen are in favor of it.
The General Conference in the law-mak
ing body of the church. The only restric
tions placed upon it are known aa the
"aii restrictive rules." These relate to
the articles of religion or the creed of the
church, the Episcopal form of church
government, the right of a minister or j
member to trial and appeal, and the i
alienation of the proceeds of the publish
in p houses from the Bupport of the super
annuated ministers.
These six reatrictive rules may be
changed by a vote of three-fourths of the
ministers in the annual conferences and a
vote of two-tnirds majority in the General
Conference. These restrictive rules have |
been in effect the constitutional law of the j
church. Aside from these safeguards, the !
General Conference can do as it pleases by
a majori ty vote. In the General Assembly
of the Presbyterian church its legal enact
ments must be approved by the presby
teries before they become law. In the
Congregational and Baptist associations
the deliverances are not binding on the in
dividual church and come simply as recom
mendations.
The aieeting of the General Conference is
attended with much excitement, because
the least change in the machinery of the
church will effect eve-y local church to
the full extent of the change. Another
thine which makes the General Conference
specially exciting is the elections.
Its patronage is very large. It elects
bishops for life, secretaries for the various
benevolent societies, editors of all the Ad
vocates, book agents and committees and
boards of management for the term of four
years. Posts oi honor are 'filled until the
number reaches hundreds. Not all these
are salaried ollicers, but many of them
are, and others are affected by the consti
tution of these committees and boards of
management.
There are several questions to come be
fore the present General Conference, which
meets in Cleveland May 1, and will proba
bly continue until near the close of tne
month. These questions have been agi
tatint' the church for a decade. They
have been put off by compromises and
temporary devices from time to time, but
all the while growing more intense.
The first of these is known in church
parlance as the '"Woman Question." In
the General Conference of 18Â»8 four
women were elected delegates, but they
were not seated, because it was claimed
the constitution of the church deoarred
them. A constitutional amendment was
sent down to the annual conferences, but
failed to carry. In 1892 the amendment was
reversed and was so woraed that unless
three-fourths of the ministers voted for
continuance of the law as it is, the con
struction of the constitution should be
that women were eligible to membership
u the General Conierence. This was
looked upon as revolutionary and was pen
erallv repudiated by the church. The
original amendment of 1888 was taken UP
flml pent the rounds of the conferences,
but it was defeated by the small number
of lifty-seven. Four women delegates
have b< en elected to the present General
Conference. The opinion of some is that
they should be seated, and that the action
of the two former general conferences
should be ignored.
They claim that each General Confer
ence is a law unto itself. Others think
that inasmuch as the church has already
voted on the question twice and it has
failed each time, that it would be a flag
rant and radical violation of ail law to
consult the church accoiding to the forms
of law and then proceed directly opposite
to that decision. The conservative party,
the opponents of the women, claim that
the question should be sent down to the
churches again! An analysis of the vote
shows that' the West generally favored
t e admission of women by a large major
ity. New England also favored them by
a gaod majority, but the Central J-Jast was
strongly the other way. New Yorfr,
Pennsylvania and the surrounding States
were more conservative. It is due to the
women to say that most of them prefer to
come into the law-making body of the
church by the retruJar constitutional
amendment and not be crowded in
through the backdoor by a mere majority
vote.
The second great question that has agi
tated two preceding general conferences is
the removal of the time limit in the pas
toral appointment. When Asbury had
his way in the early davs ministers were
changed every six months. This a little
later oecame lixed at a term of one year,
still later two years, then three, and in
18sS it was extended to five years. The
aggressive reformers in the church are
now urjring that it, be removed altogether.
To an outsider this would eeem to be a
simple and easy thing to do, but the Meth
odist itinerancy is a unique organization.
To make the appointments at all upon any
other than an crbitrary basis every pastor
must surrender his appointment at the
session of his conference. If the whole
work can be adjusted as well Dy his return
Tie is returned. The key to the arch is the
"time limit." The fact that one man's
time has expired is a reason why all the
members of the conference must stand on
an equality with him. The time limit
beinsr taken away there would be no as-
Burance that a pastor desiring a change
could have an appointment.
The "time limit" is really the key to the
itinerancy. To remove it will be equiva
lent to changing tfce whole Methodist
ministry to the independent basis of Con
gregationalism.
To ihose unacquainted with the working
of the General Conference it may be of in
terest to explain tnat the conference is di
vided into iarge committees.
All matters pertaining to the Bishops
and their administration are referred to
the committee on episcopacy, amendments
to the book of discipline to ttie committee
on revisals. etc., etc., and the great battles
are often fought in these committees be
fore the matter comes betore the General
Conference for final action.
The election of Bishop is always at
tended with intense excitement. It means
a good deal. It is a position of great
honor, a life term, a free passport to all
parts of the world. It is eeneraliy conceded
that four new Bishops will be elected.
Who these fortunate persons will be is a
question of much speculation. Dr. Earl
Cranston, now at the" head of the Western
Publishing-house, Cincinnati; Dr. John F.
G=>ucher, president of the Woman's Col
lege, Baltimore; Dr. John K. Day, presi
dent Syracuse University; Dr. Frank
Bristol of Evanston and Dr. Henry A.
Battg of Drew Theological Seminary are
doubtless among the strongest candidates
for tiie episcopacy. No one can certainly
forecast the action or a general conference.
Two-thirds of the delegates are new hands
at law-making and unacquainted with the
candidates for the episcopacy, never nav
ing been in a general conference before.
They are usually conservative.
The delegates are from all parts of the
world â Germans, Swedes,! Japanese, Chi
nese, Africansâ so that it is quite impos
sible to analyze the opinion of a general
conference touching any great interest in
advance. Tue booming of candidates is a
sure way to defeat them. It is supposed
that the delegates will make up their
minds as to the fitness of candidates in a
quiet and unbiased manner. All "candi
oating" is strictly against the traditions of
the church, but as long as there are places
of ..onor and salaried offices to fill and
human nature is as it is there will be
some "striving among the brethren for
the best gifts.
To change laws which affect 2,500,000
members is a grave responsibility. It is
therefore probable that many of the radi
cal changes proposed will never seethe
light. Hundreds of the memorials will
be strangled in the committees.
Judge Hunt to Sire the Next
Entertainment of the Press
Club.
The Enlargement of the Library,
Increase of Membership aud Pros*
perity of the Club.
The Press Club is preparing to give a
uniqne midsummer jinks in its handsome
rooms in the Thurlow block, on the even
ing of June 6. At the last meeting of the
board the date was set.
Superior Judge John Hunt, who for the
place is probably unsurpassed on the coast,
and who for his dry humor and rare
talents otherwise is widely known, is to
sire the jinks. He is acting in connection
with the entertainment committee, and is
enlisting much of the best talent of the
club. It is believed that it will be by all
odds the best jinks yet given.
The club has had a signally prosperous
career during the past few months. Dur
ing the present administration seventy
five additional members have been ad
mitted, and others are asking for mem
bership. The new members are profes
sional men of high standing, and they as
well as the old members are taking great
interest in the institution. ' â 'â  "â 'â â 
--Its- finances have been put on an abso
lutely sound busis. Its billp are paid with
promptness as they are agreed upon, and
its credit is as good as that of a bank.
The library facilities have been doubled
and new books are being constantly added.
Several new and valuable pictures have
also been recently secured.
Mrs. K. S. Hart, niotlier of the late Wil
liam. N. Hart, has presented to the club
about fifty volumes formerly belonging to
that well-known newspaperman. Also a
large collection of Samoan relics, including
warelubs, cymbals, a larpe volume of photo
graphs of the wrecked Vanaaiia, Trenton
and ot..er warships.
These were obtained by Mr. Hart at the
time of the Samoan war. when he was
there as a special correspondent, and at
this date, and because of this association
are of great value. There are other thines
in the collection, and all are liiphly prized.
More room is beginning to be needed by
the club,, but as the management believes
it best to procrcss soiidly and safeir, no
immediate effort will be "made to net other
rooms. The increased number of mem
bers constantly in the. rooms -fittest in a
partial way the prosperity of the organiza
tion. .... . ..

the Local Postal
System.
STREETCAR DELIVERY.
A Scheme to Centralize the
Working Forces at the
Water Front.
AIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT.
The New Bui'ding Will Be Used as a
General Delivery and for Ad
ministration Purposes.
The establishment of a postoffice at the
water front, where toed iff eretit car lines
terminate at the foot of Market street, Has
been rinally agreed upon. It is the inten-
tion ol the State Board of Harbor Com- â¢
missioners to erect a separate building for ,
the convenience of the postal service on
the site at the ferries now occupied by the .
baegaee-room of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
This new scheme will virtually despense
with tne usefulness of the new postotlice
and United States Court building, which
the Government proposes to erect on the.
Bite, purchased for. the purpose, at the i
corner of Mission and Seventh streets. It
will bi used, however, as in administra
tion building and as a general delivery.
Anyway, the scheme is to centralize the
working forces of the postal department
at the wator front.
The main Postoflice will then be U3ed
sjlcly as a general delivery, and at the
pace the Government architect is proceed
ing with the plans, according to reports
from Washington, there is some doubts
about the time when work will be actually
bepun on the new building. It may be
commenced in the lifetime of the young
est inhabitant and it may never be com
menced- .
Meanwhile the new Postoffice at the fer
ries will be buiit. The idea is to central
ize the business of the Postoftice at the
water front. How this metnod wii- suc
ceed remains to be Been. Thus far it is
only an experiment.
This contemplated innovation is the re*
salt of the streetcar postai system in tro
uuced at Boston,' Philadelphia, New York
and other large cities, and in the course of
human affairs is expected to become a
pern'anency in San Francisco.
. it the reason why the postal author
ities are anxious for the erection Gf a sep
arate postofiice at the water front, and al
ready plans have been completed for the
building. It will \>e two stories in height
and will be pavilion-like in it= interior ar- I
rangement. The second story will have i
gallery encircling the entire building, and
there will be a large skvlisrht in the csnter i
of the structure which will be sufficiently
large to accommodate the entire working
forces of The Postoffioe.
A money-order department, stamp win
dow and general delivery will also be
maintained at this branch, which will in
every way serve the purposes of a central
omce, and in the course of time it is
Loped the public will become so accus
tomed to the ferry postoffioe that no other
will be required.
According to the new streetcar postal
receiving and delivering system, which
has met with the encouragement of the
Postal Department at Washington, the
mail streetcars will receive and deliver
the entire mail of the City, and as all the
streetcar Una terminate at the ferries it is
i bought that San Francisco will be much
better served bv the new system.

An Eastern Finn Looking to the West
for Investment.
Secretary J. A. Filcher of the State
Board of Trade yesterday received a letter
from a firm in Indianapolis asking if there
are a sufficient number of steam bakeries
in this City to warrant the establishment
of a plant here for the manufacture of
steam-bakery machinery, etc.
Mr. Filcher in reply said thai there were
but few bakeries of that class in this Citv,
but that there were between 300 and 400
bakeries of all kinds here. In conclusion
he said:
"Such a factory as you contemplate
ought to supply the large bakeries of Port-
land, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, Utah,
New Mexico, and probably all of them
would be glad to give support to your en
terprise, yet I would not cave you estab
lish it on our recommendation without in
vestigating the subject further."
N. Diers, a Saloon-Keeper, Vic

N. Diers, a saloon-keeper at Fifth air
Folsom streets, reported at police head
: quarters yesterday morning that he had
': been robbed of bis valuable gold watch
: and chain, diamond pin valued ai $150 and
; $3 in silver by a woman.
Late Tuesday night he said he went into
| Carr's saloon, on McAllister and Larkin
streets, and was having a drink, when an
i attractive woman came up to him and the
j bartender introduced her to him. He did
! not remember her name.
He treated her, to several drinks. He
' drank so much that he fell asleep and did
j not awaken till yesterday morninc.
.; He found his watch and chain, diamond
I pin and money eone. Not only that, but
I his new hat nad disappeared and an old
j one had been substituted for it.
â¢ He was firmly convinced that the woman
' robbed him as soon as he fell asleep, but
' he is puzzled to know who could have
stolen- his hat. He feels sure he could
â  identify the woman acain. -Ho could not
'gut any satisfaction -from the saloon peo
ple and accordingly made his complaint to
â  the police. . : :

necessarily militate against the existing rela
tions of any person belonging to any Evangeli
cal church" There are large portions of Scrip
ture embraced iu the writings of the ancient
prophets which are seldom or never discussed
in the pulpits. And it Is to recover and propa
gate this portion of the Bible that tho ieagut- is
proposed. Dr. Morgan is expected to speak of
the "Seven Apocalyptic Seals" next bunday.

Hill, Russell, Pattison and Car
lisle as Presidential
Timber.
A WESTERN MAX IS WANTED.
Preferences Expressed by Several
Leading Demociats of Cali
fornia.
The meeting of Democratic conventions
in some of the Eastern States and the
voice of Pennsylvania instructing for ex-
Governor Pattison of that State have
caused Democrats in San Francisco to
taik of Presidential cardidates. The
National convention of the party will be
held in Chicago some time in July, but
the interest in the coming event is not
sufficiently active to c^use the lights of
the party in this region to remember the
exact day of the meeting. It is acknowl
edged, however, that a convention will
be held and a candidate be nominated.
John BogÂ£S of Colusa may well be
designated as one of the war-horses of the
Democratic party in this State. His
Democracy dates back to the days of
Jackson. He has served his party in
National and State conventions, in the
Legislature and in public boards and com
missions.
In that notable convention of Democrats
at San Jose ten years aco, when George
Hearst was defeated lor the gubernatorial
nomination by General Stoneman and the
Southern Pacific, John Bogcs was the pre
siding otlicer and gained laurels for wis
dom and patience. The "sage of Colusa,"
as Mr. Boggs is called, was in town yester
day. He spoke of Democratic possibilities
in a nominating sense.
He said: "I believe the Democratic can
didate for President should come from the
West. I am not sure that Carlisle is just
the man we need to lead the party in the
next campaign. There will be no* trouble
in finding good men, but 1 am inclined to
think that it would be a mistake to nomi
nate au Eastern man.
"The convention at Chicago," continued
Mr. P-opgs, "should not meddle too much
with the money question. The settlement
of thai issue should be left mainly to Con
gress. Our representative in Congress
will understand the subject fully as well
as the delegate to the National conven
tion. It should be understood that the
candidate of the convention should, if
elected President, allow Congress to legis
late on the matter without executive in
terference."
Arthur Rodgers, regent of the univer
sity, lawyer and orator, is a sound-money
Democrat. This means that he is opposed
to the coinage of too much silver at the ra
rate of 16 to 1, but that is not his definition
of sound-money doctrine. In gazing about
for the discovery of another Democratic
Moses Mr. Rodgers permits his eye to rest
on ex-Governor Russell oÂ£ Massachusetts.
The attributes of statesmanship which the
Massachusetts Moses may not in fact pos
sess are readily supplied by Mr. Rodgers'
imagination, which does invest Mr. Rus
sell with political genius and great patriot
ism.
"Mr. Rr.sseil belongs to the school of
pure-minded and able statesmen. He
commands the greatest influence and re
spect where he is best known. His t-u
perior abilities have brought his n;Â«nie to
attention. A man of liis type BhoaR! se
cure the Democratic nomination for Presi
dent."
"But he is a hard-money Democrat,"
interposed the interviewer.
"So tun I; so am I," rejoined the recent.
"When a Droad-miivie.! Republican Presi
dent cuides the destinies of France and an
able-bodied Democratic President holds
the reins of Government in the Fnited
State? Raphael Weil is happy. The se
renity of his joy imparts to his counte
nance a licht -'like that the limners gave
to the beloved dbciple." To Mr. Weil's
mind there may be in the future other
Democratic Presidents in this country, but
Cleveland is the one and only true Hoses.
Speaking of Democratic possibilities he
said:
"Russell is a good man. Pattison is an
able man. Carlisle is well known for his
ability, but lie lias been in public life a
long time and his position on the question
of finance has not been consistent. Whit
ney is a strong Democrat, but Russell be
longs to the your.g ana progressive ele
ment of the party and would make an ex
cellent candidate."
Dr. George Chismore, the new president
of the Bohemian Ciub. who mav become
famous as the only Democrat elected to
office in the year 189*i, gives free rein to his
admiration for David i>. Hill tl Now York.
The genial doctor reads all of Hill's
speeches and regards the Senator as one of
the foremost statesmen of the uay.
"Hill's reply to Gorman," said Dr.
Chiamore, "was masterly. His defense of
the administration stamped him a ttates
man. Then, he is sound on every public
question. 1 doubt if the Democratic con
vention could nominate a better or a
stronger candidate."
John E. Budd. brother of California's
Governor and a Regent of the State Uni
verity, in speaking of Democratic Presi
dential timcer, said: "The nominee of
the Democratic convention should come
from trie West. Kill, Russell and Patti-
BOO may be able men, but tiie people
demand a Western man. I cannot say
now to whom the nomination should be
given."
Jere Lynch, ex-State Senator, is giving
more attention to the workings of the Hale
<Â£ NorcrosB mine than to political subjects.
'It is too early," he remarked, "to talk
of Democratic candidates for President.
There will be plenty of time to consider
the subject after the Republicans name a
candidate."
Ex-Postmaster "William Bryan is a Demo
crat of the old school who has held office
nmler Federal and local anspices. He
says that the Occidental Club lias no favor
ite candidate for the Democratic nomina
tion. In rppard to Car.'isle, Mr. Bryan re
marked: "Outside of the Federal office
holders I do not hear much talk of Car
lisle. I hear occasional preferences ex
pressed for Whitney. I think he has a
strong following in the party. He is rated
as a statesman of nn-t-Huf^ abilities, and
would command the full strength of the
party."

Mrs. Geary of 208 Jones street and a lady
friend were standing at Ellis and Market
streets last night watching the parade of
the Salvation Army when she felt some
one abstracting her purse, containing $10,
from l.er pocket. She turned quickly
round and noticed a man, who slunk
away. She searched for a policeman, but
could not find one, and then she and her
friend hurried to police headquarters and
reported the theft.
Detectives Graham and Gillen were
detaihd on the case and in less than half
an hour they arrested Jacob Ganib and
took him to "Mrs. deary's house. She at
once identified him as the man who had
been standing beside her. He was taken
to the City Prison and booked on the
charge of grand larceny. Mrs. Geary will
swear out a warrant this morning. When
searched $15 in gold and 15 cents in silver
were found in his pockets.
Ganib said lie was a blacksmith and
came from Crescent City a few days ago.
He denied rt**flng the purse.

Mysterious Disappearance of a
Prominent Young Church
Member.
WHEBE IS THOMAS BARNES?
A Pathetic Air That It Is Thought
Made Him Temporarily
Insane.
The mysterious disappearance of Thomas
Barnes, a bright and highly respected
young man, is causing the greatest alarm
among his friends and the congregation of
Trinity Methodist Episcopal Cnurclj, Six
teenth and Noe streets, of which he was a
prominent member.
Before coming here about a year ago
Barnes was a schoolteacher in Oregon and
had a first-class certificate. As he failed
to get a position as teacher he had been
working for some time for A. Bonig, 86
Clipper street, who has a cracker route for
the American Biscuit Company. He lived
with the Boniir family.
A week ago last Wednesday Bonig and
Barnes started together to go over the
route. Barnes was sent to the grocery on
Eighteenth and Capp streets for an order
ami that was the last seen or heard of him.
Mr. and Mrs. Bonig waited patiently for
a clay or two expecting that he had possi
bly met some friends and would turn up
all rigtit, hut as time wore on they became
anxious about him and called rpon Rev.
Dr. Bovard, pastor of Trinity Methodist
Church. Barnes was treasurer of the
Young People's Society of the church and
~aa a favorite with theentire congregation
and the pastor; as he took an active in
terest in the work. His room was visited
and in the pockets of the trousers lie wore
on Sundays the ruouey belonging to the
society was lound.
It then dawned upon themtlnu some
thing serious must h:ive happened to the
young man. All his clothing and other
personal effects were in his room and he
had taken notbinsr with him except the
clothing he wore. The day before his dis
appearance he received $1H as wages and
he ar>part>ntlv had that amount with him,
as it was not in his room.
It was decided to notify the police and
Detective Harry Reynolds was detailed on
the cato. He has made the most diligent
inquiry, but has been unable to find the 'â 
Slightest trace of the ruissins young man.
Tim-e weeks ago to-night Barnes was at
theEpworth Methodist Episcopal Church
at an entertainment. A dialogue was
given there which he thought seemed to
outline li is career in leaving home. He '.
came to Dr. Bovard the following Monday j
and said he thought that it had been made !
as a thrust at him. He seemed to be labor- !
ing under some sort of hallucination. He
was very much excited over it and seemed
to think something underhanded regard
ing him had been done.
Looking for a theory for his departure,
Dr. Thomas Fle.chef, one of the gentle
men associated with the church, who has
taken an aciive interest in the young man
on accouut of liis earnest enaeavor in the
cause of Christianity, said yesterday tha: â 
the young man had " taken a stronginter
est in the work of the Floating (,'hristian
Endeavor Society, of which the Mariners'
Church is trie headquarters. "If this dia
logue worried him," said Dr. Fletcher,
â¢"if lie thought he had wronged his par
ents in any way by departing, he might
have quietly embarked on one of the ships
ond gone home in that way. 1 think my
self that he is mentally "deranged from
some caune or other, though np to this
time he showed himself to be a good, sen
sible boy, and was always in a good humor
and working during his leisure hours for
the advancement of religion."
Mrs. Bonig also throws some little light
upon the mystery. She says that on Sun
day night previous to his disappearance
Barnes accompanied her to church. Dur
ing the service one of the ladies in the
choir aang "Where Is My Wandering Boy
To-night?" and he appeared to be deeply
affected by the air and the pathos of the
words. He was strangely absent in his
manner all that night and was worse the
following two days.
He was a young man of exemplary
i habits. He neither smoked nor drank,
i and all his spare cash was spent in buying
lawbooks, which he read wljh avidity.
His ambition was to become a lawyer, and
his nights were spent in deep study.
Bennies being treasurer of the Young
People's Society of the church he was a
member of the Band of Hope and of the
Forosters' organization.
In his room was found a letter from his
! brother J. B. Barnes, 63 Woeppel avenue,
j Buffalo, N. Y., and the police have Com
municated with him. His parents are
believed to be in Chicago.
Barnes is an Englishman by birth, 26 or
I 27 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches tnll, light hair,
; blue eye?,8Ciooth face marked with pimples.
] When thinking he has a habit of covering
j his face with his hand. He wore at the
j time of his disappearance dark clothes and
a blacK Fedora hat. He was not known
to be keeping company with any young
lady.

The Government Closes Its
Case in the Railroad
Suit.
STATE RIGHTS DISCUSSED
Legislative Acts Relied On to
Defeat the Railroad Com
mission.
ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY
"This Great Government of the
United States Is Contending for
Principle, Sir."
In the United States Circuit Court yes
terday. District Attorney Foote. after talk
ing all day on the intervantion of the
Government in the case of the Southern
Pacific against the State Board of Railroad
Commissioners, closed his argument. He
spoke as follows:
"If the court please, it is not necessary,
perhaps, to advert to the fact which is so
patent to all men, and especially to those
who have either listened to the arguments
here, or read them as printed, that there
has perhaps never, in the history of judi
cature been a case which lias been more
ably argued by distinguished counsel than
this case has been upon the part of the
Kuilroad Commission. And from the fact
that the Attorney-General and Judge
Hayne are gentlemen who have alwavs
been my friends, and for whom I enter
tain the highest respect and affection, it is
hardly necessary for me to pav them any
fulsome compliments as to the" method in
which they have presented this case to the
court. ]iut it is certainly a source of
graiitication to all those concerned that
this great case has been presented with so
much ability and ingenuity and so much
of that p;.re instinct of gentility which
belongs to the first-class lawyer. "We are,
if the court please, to be congratulated
upon this fact.
"The truth is. in view of the fact that at
this lime, when this great debt to the
Government of the United States, t>y
means of which this National highwa\ of
the Central Pacific and Union Pacific, and
all the lines which entered into that
Bcheme at that time, were inaugurated by
the tiovernment, being considered from
the standpoint of a National highway,
and the time having come when the vast
debt which is due from' that road is about
to mature; in view of the fact that the
security by which the Congress of the
United States in its wisdom, by its various
acts from L862to 1M:'., attempted and en
deavored to secpre to the Government of
the United Slates the payment of this
debt by the sinking fund has proved al>or
ti\t>, has not turned out as expectations
seemed to warrant; and in view of the
fact that this great question as to the set
tlement of al! these facts has been precipi
tated by that and by tne decision of this
court, indorsed by the unanimous bench
of the Supreme Court of the United States,
that there was no liability upon stock
holders, it became a matter of the most
momentous importance to the Govern
ment of the United States.' .
Mr. Foots then paid his respects to the
court, referring particularly to the "pa
tience and clear mind" which Juiige Mc-
Ktiina had brought to bear upon all ques
tions coming before him.
"It is very important for us to consider
in the outset what haa actually been done
by way of legislation by this body of Rail
road Commissioners," continued the Dis
trict Attorney. "It seems to me that we
have but to turn to what are termed, and
whic.i I am willing to admit for the saue
of argument are. their legislative acts to
find that there can oe out one consf ruction
placed upon that. 1 can see no difference
whatever as to the scope and effect of
these legislative acts witli iespect to the
K per cent reduction on grain rates and the
â¢Jo per cent reduction as to all other mat
ters."
Mr. Foote went over the ground of the
resolution, which declared that the trans
portation rates of the Southern Pacific and
its leased lines were unjust to the shippers
of the State and that an average reduction
of 2o per cent should be made on the rates
in force since December, 1894. He defined
the position of the Pacific roads toward
the United States and the lien the latter
has on the former.
"The whole history of tli is Railroad Com
mission shows from the time when these
pledges were attempted to be exacted us
to one of the Commissioners, who says he
did not make it, Â«nd the othÂ«>r of whom
aaniits he didâ from the time that polit
ical policy was inaugurated by the con
vention 01 one of the great parties of tins
State, antil the time when it was crystal
lized and consolidated into the language
of tins legislative act, there could 1* no
conclusion that a sound lawyer could
arrive at other than that the" Hoard of
Railroad Commissioners meant exactlv
what they said, and then 1 was to come
here to meet the declared issue, that these
gentlemen had undertaken to regulate a
corporation called the Southern Pacific
Company, which had leased these lines,
and valid leased lines, including the Cen
tral Pacific in this State, upon which this
Railroad Commission claimed the right
and Jurisdiction to reduce rates.
Mr. Foote argued tbat ia view of the fact
that the Government had a lien on this
property for money advanced it was not
legal to cripple agencies of the Government
by acts which impair the obligation of a
contract. He paid that any such action
was against the constitution of the Gov
ernment. The Railraod Commission in
sisted that nothing was involved in the
case but the grain rates, and upon that
theory had attempted to minimize the
scope of the suit.
Mr. Footo contended that the case in
volved the 25 per cent reduction as well as
the 8 per cent reduction.
The resolution showed that the Commis
sioners decided on an absolute 25 pet cent
reduction, and that, too. without any ex
press qualification or condition.
"What the Government insists upon is
to preserve intact its rates under the Thur
man act, nnd whether the reduction
threatened in this case is much or small
it presents a strong c:;Â«e for equitable in
terposition of this court. It is no answer
to the principle involved that the loss of
of a few thousand dollars only will be suf
fered by the Government. Jf the State
can reduce this sinking fund to the extent
of $3000 then it may and probably will pro
ceed to extinguish the fund altogether.
Mr. Hayne â Does not the act of the
State say "Subject to the laws of the
State?"
District Attorney Footeâ Yes; but the"
whole act must be taken, together with
reference to what was then being done.
There was nothing granted bv the State of
California to this corporation but the
mere skeleton right to be a corporation,
and here was the natural purpose of Con
gress endeavoring by this legislation to
make a great National road and to fur
nish the nnewa of war by which it should
be built and to give security to the rest of
the people of the Vnite<l States that they
should have some chance for repayment.
The courtâ Do you consider in the
course of your argument Judge Hayne's
contention that these acts must all be
viewed with reference to the right of Con
gress to regulate interstate rommerce and
the right of the State to regulate interstate
commerce.
Mr, Foote â I say that is a false quantity.
I say tnere is nothing in the view which* I
lake that involves the question of inter
state commerce at all.
The courtâ Then you dp consider all the
elements of Judge Hayne's contention.
â¢Mr. Foote â I consider it in that light,
yes; that is the view I take of it.
Then followed a long argument between
the court and the District Attorney over
the question of State rights. At 2:30
o'clock Mr. Foote finished his argument,
after which court adjourned until Tues
day morning at 11 o'clock.
A Prominent Nevadan Succumbs
to the Dreaded Miner's
Consumption.
His Ambition Was to Help the Real
Workers of the Country â An
Honorable Career.
Hon. Eric O. Leermo, familiarly known
among his friends as "Aleck" lieerrao, for
many years a prominent citizen of Ke
vatia. died in this City recently, his mal
ady being miner's consumption, an insidU
ous and much-dreaded disease of those
who toil to develop the mineral resources
of the country.
A few weeks ago Mr. Leermo came to
this City, desiring to improve his health,
yet scarcely daring to hope that the
change of ciimate would be of material
benefit. He seemed to realize that the
doom of death was pending, for he knew
ttie nature of his disease and spoke of it
calmly as one of the frequent consequences
that may hefall the br.ive-hearted men
who delve in the depths of the great gold
and silver mines of Nevada and California.
One of Mr. Leermo's last remarks was
that those who thus risk their lives In the
vitiated atmosphere of the mines, in addi
tion to the ever-threatening accidents,
were certainly entitled to all the compen
sation that they ever received. In this
view Mr. Leermo is sustained by Bach
men as John Mackay, the late Senator
Fair, the late Senator IIearÂ«t, Lolonal E.
D. Boyle, D. B. Lyman, R. P. Keating: and
in fact all the prominent mining engineers
and superintendents ever known on the
Pacific Coast.
Mr. Leermo was born in Norway, Sep
tember 1, 1842, and came to the United
States early in life with his father and
mother and settled in Wisconsin. He left
the family roof while a young boy and
came to the Pacific Coast in 1860. After
prospecting for gold in several mining
camps he drifted over to Nevada and
located in Gold Hill in 1864, where he was
active in the organization of the Miners'
Union of Lyon and Storey counties.
He was president of the Gold Hill Union
and at one time represented Storey County
in the Legislature.
A man of some inventive genius Mr.
Leermo spent considerable time and
money in that direction, but never real
ized anything from his inventions. They
were considered meritorious, but he lacked
the means to develop his plans.
It was one of Mr. Leermo's ambitions to
ameliorate the condition of the real work
ers of the count ry, and in this direction
he bent his energies to securing an amend
ment to the constitution of Nevada in the
interest of organized labor unions. He
was frequently prominent in political
affairs, and it is said that at one time he
was offered the appointment as Lieuten
ant-Governor of Nevada by the late Gov
ernor C. C. Stevenson.
The funeral services were conducted by
the Knights of Pythias, of which order
Mr. Leermo was an honored member. At
the grave, in addition to the touchine cere
monies of the I'ythians, there was singing
by a select choir, and an address was de
livered by Hon. George H. Morrison, who
paid an appropriate tribute to the high
character and honorable career of the de
ceased. He was buried in Cypress Lawn
Cemetery on April 20th.

The Old Howard Presbyterian
Church Sold for a Ware
house.
HISTORY OF ITS VICISSITUDES.
Little Carpenter-Shop in 1850 That
Grew to Be a Mission-Street
Landmark.
The old Howard Presbyterian Church
that has been a familiar landmark on Mis
sion street for thirty-one years has passed
into other hanus to become a sort of ma
chine-shop and warehouse.
While the sale has not yet been made
public, it is privately asserted by members
of the church that Thomas Day & Co. are
the purchasers of that part of the prop
erty on which the church building stanus
â 78 feet front by 115 feet deep â and the
price agreed upon was $600 a front foot.
There still remains unsold twenty-two
feet front, comprising that part of the lot
devoted to the old chapel. When that
shall have been soid the proceeds will be
turned over to the building fund of the
congregation's new quarterp, consisting at
present of a large chapel near the pan
handle entrance to the park, ami which
will be ready for occupancy in about two
months. Meanwhile the congregation
will probably continue to hold services in
the old building, although the organ has
already been removed.
The history of Howavd Presbyterian
Cirirch is one of trying vicissitudes, fol
lowed by remarkable revivals, each one of
which was a timely infusion of new lite
and vigor into a declining hope.
\Y. L. Palmer, a member of the congre
gation for the last forty-four years, as the
oldest member of the church is in a posi
tion to review its record.
It was on the 19th of May, 1S50, he said,
that the first Sunday-school was held in
an old carpenter-shop on Mission street,
near Second, in a district then known as
Happy Valley. That was the nucleus of
the chuÂ»ch itself, which was organized on
the lfith of September of the same year
with the Rev. Samuel II. Willey as its
first pastor.
On May 1, 1S64, the Rev. Mr. Willey
was pucreeded in the pulpit by the Rev.
\V. W. Martin, and he in turn was fol
lowed by the Rev. II. Brodt. In Auril,
18G5. the celebrated H. M. Scudder, D.D.,
became the pastor, and one of the earliest
events in his successful labor during six
years was the move made in 18t>5 into the
new church on Mission street, the build
ing that has now ended its usefulness as a
place of worship and has been sold lot and
all for barely more than the building cost.
Tnc original lot for the church had been
given by W. D. M. Howard, an old pio
neer, after whom Howard street was
named and in whose honor the church re
tained its name even after it was moved
from Howard street.
In 18G7 the membership had grown to
301 from fifteen communicant? in is r >l,and
the Sabbath-school enrollment was 400.
Following the Rev. Mr. Scudder came
the Revs. II. B. Carpenter and A. S. Fiske,
and during their administrations the
financial depression came and left its
gloomy shadow upon the church. The
great decline ot values precipitated the
congregation deep into debt, and in order
to avoid publicity the church property was
voluntarily turned over to the mortgagees,
and when tne Rev. Dr. Robert Macken
zie took charge of affairs in 1880 the church
was actually renting the property it for
merly owned. Through his efforts and the
more* prosperous times of 1880 and 1881 the
congregation was able to repurchase the
property and had nearly paid for it when
in 188(J Dr. Mackenzie was succeeded by
the Rev. M. N. Cornelius. The late JDr.
Hanson Irwin was also pastor and pre
ceded the incumbent, the Rev. F. R.
Farrar.
Three great turning points made the his
tory of the church â one in 188G under
Evangelist A. B. Karle, another in 1880 un
der Evangelist Dwight L. Moody, and the
third in 18U2 under the Rev. B. Fay Mills,
and each time there were large additions
to the membership of the church.
It was often remarked that the building
was unusually plain, and particularly so
with a spire so generally considered a dis
tinctive feature of Presbyterian archi
tecture. Mr. Palmer explains that there
were three considerations at the time for
this: the fear of earthquakes, the addi
tional expense of a spire ana new ideas in
architecture.

General 1 arrett talks of bringing the

Major Diss says that the troop numbers
eighty men, and nearly every man owns
the horse that he rides. The horses are
not half broken-down Jivery plu^s of all
conditions and ages, bnt are active and
superb steeds. The troopers are first-class
young men of the county, and many of
them can ride like Comanches.

John F. Pinkham, marshal of the society,
read the usual services, supplementing
them with a short address, the main feat
ure of which was:
"There is another of us gone to the great

upon his life and his manhood, for he was
a pioneer, and. like all who have gone be
fore him, he had the virile traits of the
hardy men who built this great State."

Favorable Report as to the Con
dition of Mrs. Booth-
Tucker.
Scenes of Enthusiasm at Last Night's
Salvation Mee ing in Metro
politan Temple.
Consul Mrs. Booth-Tucker is in a fair
way to recover from her recent severe ill
ness. When a man from The Call made
inquiries at her rooms at 1141 Market
street the nurse said her mistress was
resting easily, and according to the pre
diction of the physicians would soon be
able to be on her feet again.
"Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!" cried
a thousand voices, as Major Alice Lewis,
the consul's secretary, announced that the
ladywas improving In health.
"Yes, praise the Lord," continued the
lady major, "though still confined to her
bed, Mra. Booth-Tucker is getting better.
All her engagements have been postnon ed
for a week, in which time we hope to have
her among us, well and strong, and able to
fight the battle against Satan for the
world's salvation."
A strong chorus of "Hallelujahs,"
"Amens" and loud drum-beats greeted
this announcement, after which Major
Lewis continued :
'"We have telegraphed to Commander
Booth-Tucker, asking him to come to his
wife's aid, so we will have them both with
us, and we have every reason to hope for a
Pentecostal season. Brigadier Keppel's
child will be dedicated to the service of
the army as soon as the commander comes,
and we hope others may follow our dear
brigadier's examine in thus devoting his
little one to the labor of salvation."
Another burst of hallelujahs and a can
nonade of drum-beats welcomed this in
telligence.
Staff Captain Mclntyre opened the de
votional exercises with a song, being fol
lowed by Mrs. Ensign Bull, who led in
prayer.
Captain Michael Flaherty, an ex-Cath
olic, then related his experience. He said
he was first attracted to tne army by the
resonant drum, and having attended a few
meetings, made up his mind to cast in his
I lot with the organization. Two brothers,
I who were sent after him to bring him
back to his old faith, also went over to the
army, and one of them. Captain John
Flaherty, gave his experience.
A strong and impassioned appeal to the
impenitent W8s delivered by Captain
Marian Evans, who is in charge of the
Salvation Army dive at the intersection of
Sacramento and Kearny streets.
"Gathering up the Gems From the
Slums" was the refrain of a song given by
Captain Fannie Fields, and she sang it
well, the Diano accompaniment bv Mr?.
Minnie Burchard adding much to tne
effectiveness of the rendering.
Major Lewis gave some interesting paees
from her experience in India, calling par
ticular attention to the conversion of a
tire-worshiper in Bomoay. She dwelt
earnestly upon the necessity for a special
exercise of divine power within the soul
as a requisite of real conversion.
The San Francisco, Sacrameuto and
Charioteer bands, composed entirely of
Salvationists, gave a well-rendered fan
tasia of popular hymn tunes, with varia
tions, after which 'Major Fritz MalaD, an
Italian convert, spoke at some length on
the value of time and the need of repent
ance. He drew a striking word-picture of
tr.e last judgment, and in response to bis
urgent and repeated calls six persons pre
sented i themselves at the "mourners'
bench" to be prayed for. Much enthu
siasm was manifested arid the meeting
was Toted a splendid success.

To intermediate points, or points common
with those named above, rates by freight train
will be the same.
Shipments must be released. Incase such
release is not given, or the conditions named
herein are not fully complied with, the regu
lar rate provided by the Western classification
will be charged.
The Union 1'acific system notifies all parties
that H will only take .laily by its passenger
train No. 8 not exceeding three carloads of
fruit, and that it will not take by Its passenger
train No. 2 any.
The Atehisoii system, for its line via Grand
Junction, will take daily by its passenger
trains not to exceed two cars per train.
The Rio Grande Western Railway and its
eastward connecting lines, viz.: the Denver
and Ilio Grande, Burlington and Rock Island
routes, Missouri I'aciticltailway, the Atchison
route via Grand Junction, under restrictions
as to the number of cars for latter as indicated
above, hereby notify all interested that they
will take daily by the through passenger
truins from Ogden any number of cais, re
frigeraior or other, but only when same are
equipped with passenger-car trucks and air
brake?, charging for refrigerator-cars their
proportion ot 25 per cent additional to the
rates provided herein for service by approxi
mate passenger-train time.
The carload rates named above will apply
only on shipments from one consignor at one
shipping point, consigned and to be delivered
to one consignee at one destination. Cars will
D<M be allowed to be stopped in transit at any
intermt'diutf point to complete loading or to
partly unload.
Kau-s named above apply from fruit-ship
ping points on the Southern California Kail
way and only from main iine fruit-shipping
1 1 " 1 1 1 1 s on the Southern Pacific Company's
l'acific system.
The only green fruit that will go forward
earlier than the end of May is the cherry â
thut is, the early varieties, and the quan
tity of these will depend largely on the
weather. If it remains cool there will be
comparatively few early shipments, as the
weather now prevalent has a tendency to
make the fruit grow rather than ripen.
It was explained at the office of the
Southern Pacific Company that shipments
in ventilate.! cars of that company and its
connecting lines will move under this
tariff.
Shipments in refrigerator cars of the
refrigerator companies having contracts
for the moving ot deciduous fruits will De
moved under rates arranged with the re
frigerator companies, who make an addi
tional charge for the icing and care of the
fruit in transit over and above the rates
fixed by the carriers. In ventilated cars
the minimum weignt will be 20,000 pounds
and in refrigerator cars 24,000 pounds.
The companies that will do business this
season in the refrigerating of California
deciduous fruits in transit are the Conti
nental Fruit Company, the Fruit-growers'
Express, the Santa F"e Fruit Refrigerator
Line, the California Fruit Transportation
Company and the Goodell California Fruit
Line.
Shipments in refrigerators will not be
handled by passenger trains, because under
the regulations governing the movements
of fruit on passenger trains it is required
that the cars shall be equipped for Dassen
ger service; that is. shall have passenger
couplers, air signals, and generally con
form to the Master Carbuilder's rules for
passenger trains, and refrigerator cars are
not so supplied.
Ventilated fruit cars furnished by the
carriers can run in passenger trains when
such cars are equipped for passenger serv
ice, and such cars can be furnished as a
rule on the requisition of shippers.
A Street Parade and Demonstra
tion Will Be Held This
Evening.
Followed by a BiÂ§ Mass-Meeting in
Metropolitan Templeâ Programme
of Exercises.
The socialists all over the civilized world
will to-day (Mayday) hold a grand
demonstration.
This day was selected a lone time ago by
the socialists in the Old World as an oc
casion for the workingnian to take a holi
day and rest. In other words, the opening
of the spring, the bursting into life of trees
and buds and flowers, is a fit occasion for
the man who labors to throw aside cnre
and free himself from the fetters of toil.
Socialists, who really come up from the
ranks of the employed, took this view of
the occasion, and thus May 1 has become
not only tne laboring man's day all over
the world, bnt tlie socialists" day as well.
That it will be observed in this City has
been stated in The Call, but the principal
features and exercises will take place in
the eveninp. This matter was placed in
the hands of a committee of arrangements,
consisting of H. Warnicke, Theodore
Lynch, John Lutz, Henry Rosenblough
and H. Salendrr.
Letters inviting all laborers and unions
to participate in the exercises and parade
were sent recently, and many have an
swered that they will assist in mafcinp a
grand event in the early historv of social
ism in San Francisco.
At 7 o'clock this evening all of the so
cialist branches and the labor unions will
assemble at the headquarters at 115 Turk
street and form into a procession. The
socialists in the line will be the American,
Liberty, French, Jewish, German, Italian
and Scandinavian brandies ol the Social
ist Labor party of this City and the Oak
land branch. There will also be delegates
from San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego,
Sacramento, Stockton and Ventura.
T;ie local trades unions which have sig
nified their intention to parade are the
Woodworkers, Barbers' Association of San
Francisco, Fraternity of Hotel and Restau
rant Employes, Bakers' Union No. 24 and
the Confectionery Bakers' Union.
The procession will start about 7:30
o'clock and march down Turk street to
Market, to Third ami Market, where the
countermarch will be made back to Metro
politan Temple. The procession will be
headed by a band, and over the column
will float the red flag of the socialists. The
latter disclaim that the crimson banner is
an emblem of blood, violence and anarchy,
and say it is the emblem of peace and uni
versal brotherhood. Hence its universal
adoption.
On arriving at the Metropolitan Temple
P. Ross Martin will assume charge of the
meeting, officiate as chairman and de
liver the address of welcome. After this
the.Social Mannercbor wili render popular
airs. This will be followed by a recitation
by GÂ»orge Aspden.
The first speaker will be James Andrew,
and his subject will be the -'Mayday Cele
bration." A violin solo and a song by
Miss Martha Aspden will follow. The
next will be an address by Paul Grott
kau, who will give way to the musical
trio, Professors Dietz, Se'lo and Parnelie.
One of the most brilliant speakers in the
cause of universal brothernood is Mias
Jane A. Roulston. She will make a spir
ited address upon the principles to which
she is so ereatly attached â socialism, its
aims and objects. E. T. Kinesley, another
earnest worker in the cause, will also oc
cupy the platform. The conclusion of the
programme will be more music by the So
cial Mannerchor. It is expected that Met
ropolitan Temple will be tilled to the
doors.
He Discovered Selkirk, Sacked Guaya
quil, and Invented Dover's Powder.
Not many persons who have taken a
Dover's powder have any idea of the ro
mantic career of the man who gave his
name to the preparation. Professor Osier
of Johns Hopkins University, in a paper
puulished in the Lancet, tells his story.
Thomas Dover was born in Warwick
shire about itiGO, and after studying at
Cambridge, and with the famous Dr.
Sydenharu. settled down at Bristol, for
centuries the home port for adventurers,
privateers and slave traders. He was
nearly 50 when he joined in a commercial
and piratical venture with a number of
Bristol merchants. Two ships, the Duke
and the Duchess, were fitted out lor a
voyage to the south seas, from which Wil
liam Dampier, the circumnavigator of the
world, had brought wonderful tales of
Spanish riches. DamDier, who had ;
come to erief in his last expedition
to those regions, was taken along as
pilot, while Dover went as third in cony â 
mand of Captain Rogers, and appears in
his narrative as Captain Dover. The ex
pedition was memorable for two events.
On February 1, 1709, the ships arrived off
the island of Juan Fernandez and Captain i
Dover, who was sent ashore in the pin
nace, brought back with him to the ship a
couple of days later a man clad in goat :
skins, who had been left on the island lour
years and a half before. This was Alexan
der Selkirk, the original Kobinson Crusoe.
Later the expedition sailed up the South
American coast and found what it was i
seeking in the two cities of Guyaquil,
which it attacked and sacked. Dover led
the van and cured the sailors of the plague
which broke out after the capture of the
cities. After cruising in th* Pacific for
another two years for the Spanish treas
ure ships they returned to" England in
1711, having collected plunder to the value
of $850,000. Dover's share made him f\
wealthy man and left him free to wander
about the world for some years.
He settled down in London as a phy
sician in 1731, carrying into his practice
the pugnacious habits of his buccaneer's
life. To attract public attention he pub
lished his book, "The Ancient Physician's
Legacy to His Country; being what he
has collected himself in forty-nine years'
of practice designed for the use of all
private families." The book ran through
eight editions, the last apparently being
published in 1771. On page 18, on the sec
tion on gout, is given the formula for his |
famous powder:
"Take opium one ounce; saltpeter and
tartar vitriolated each four ounces; ipe
cacuanha one ounce. Put the saltpeter
and tartar into a redhot ruorlar, stirring
with a spoon until they have done (laming.
Then powder them very tine, after that
slice in your opium, grind them to a pow
der and then mix the other powders with
these. Dose, from forty to sixty or sev
enty grains in a glass of white wine posset
going to bed, covering up warm and drink
ing a quart or three pints of the posset;
drink while sweating."
The publication of the book made a great
noise and brought Dover into many quar
rels with his fellow- practitioners, who
treated him as a quack, as they did Syden
ham for that matter. He carried on "a bit
ter war against apothecaries, too, and died
in 1742. His powder is still in the British
pharmacopceia.
A statement just published shows that
of the 1SS,277,OOO tons of coal which the
mines of the United Kingdom yielded dur
ing the year 1894, no less than 42,G87,000
tons were disposed of to the foreigner.
This was by far the largest coal exporta
tion of which any country could boast,
and it was the result of a process of steady
development.
Miss Lydia Tilton, who died last week
in Hanover, N. H., at the age of 89 had
been a member of the College Church of
that place and a constant attendant at the
services for seventy-four years.
President Sylvain Weill's Res
ignation Was Given
Forever.
FRENCH SOCIETY TROUBLES.
A General Meeting Will Have to Be
Called Soon to Nominate New
Candidates.
The resignation of Sylvain Weill. as
president of the Societe Francaise de
Bienfaisance Mutuelle, followed by those
of ten out of fifteen directors Gf that insti
tution at its meeting Wednesday night, hat
thrown the French colony into a fever of
excitement.
President Weill has held that office
seven times, and thrice he has been vice
president. These honorary offices and the
fact that he was a member of the board of
directors of the society as far back as
1867, have educated the 4000 members of
the society in the State to believe that
without him at the helm, the whole thing
wouid go to pieces.
The Call in yesterday's issue gave an
exclusive account of how Mr. Weill aud
the ten directors came to resign their port
folios.
Yesterday two of the only four directors
in fifteen who did not resign were closeted
With Mr. Weill pleading with him, in be
half of the Frenchmen of this State, to
withdraw his resignation.
These gentlemen were fuil of assurances
that the other directors would follow Mr.
Weill's example in going back into the
society as they had in quitting it.
These gentlemen were Messrs. Lemoine
and Bocqueraz, and they were joined by
P. A. Bergerot, one of the men wno re
signed out who declared that he hud done
it in a moment of excitement, believing it
the best policy, but who would withdraw
his resignation.
It is well understood that, in addition
to Mr. Bergerpt's resignation, those of
Messrs. 1'ogothey and Carraine are to be
withdrawn.
It is not unlikely that Secretary J.
Deschamps will also go back into the "fold,
for the simple reason that without him
I the remaining director?, who are new in
their oilice, can hardly get along without
his aid. He reserves his right, however,
to retire as soon as the interests of the
society will be sure of protection.
Byivain Weiil was seen at his place of
business yesterday afternoon. He was
flushed with tiie excitement of standing
off his friends and advisers, who wishes
hiru to again acsunie the reins of the
society.
"I cannot accede to these requests, as
flattering as they are," he said. "I re
signed out of principle, not liorn a spirit
i of anger.
"The cause of it is plain : Drs. Brighar.i
and Boyd have served gra'.is and with the
most satis;actory results for the society
during many years. To not re-elect thorn
j was an affront the committee never should
i have inflicted upon men to whom they are
morally indebtedâ capable men, who have
been of inestimable benent to our organ
ization. I as president of the society re
signed because I did not want to lend my
backing to this faux pas. 1 regret that
my resignation was followed by those of
ten other directors, especially th'at some of
those who resigned were voters in favor of
Drs. De Marville and Mayer, as against
Drs. Brigham and Boyd.
"These directors, as L told them at the
time, should have had the courage of their
actions, and, having secured the election
of De Marville and Mayer, they should
have stood by their guns and not Bur
rendered.
"The only thing to do now with the
society is to call a general ni"eting, which
I wiil do in a day or so, that candidates
may be presented for election to take the
places oi the directors who have resigned.
I will not allow my name to be placed be
fore the meeting.
"I have got enough of the whole thing,
and will not again have anything to do
with the executive end of the society until
those fractious elements in it can see that
they cannot conduct the institution as
well as did the old board. â '
It is likely that the general assembly
will be called for two weeks from next Sun
day.
Dr. Bourgognon de Marville. the newlv
elected surgeon, stated last evening tha't
he would make no changes in the person
nel of the hospital, and that it wa< not
likely that any but very minor positions
I would be shaken up a bit. The cursory
I observation he has had of the Freiun
| Hospital has impressed him with the opin
ion that it would be nard to better its ser
vice.
J. F. Mastin has filed his promised suit
against the Harbor C'ommiÂ«.sion. He prays for
an injunction from proceeding under the con
tract allowing the stone from the Coluia quar
ries to be used, and he asks that th>- contract
be annulled and that the commission be com
pelled to use Oregon stone. The case will be
tried before Judge S.atk.Partial Adoption of the

FREE RIDES PREVENTED
Manager Kruttschnitt the In
ventor of the Gate Now
Being Used.
ITS EFFECT ACROSS THE BAY.
Alamedans Will B? Compeled to Pay
Fares on Local Trains as the
Oaklanders Now Do.
As the re-ult of the practical and theo
retical ingenuity of General Manager
.1 ulius Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pa
. tic Company, ail the trains of this com
. re de'tineJ m all probability to
have the steps leading to the platforms of
t c rars guarded by a gate.
Aiout a year airo Mr. Kruttsehnitt took
a trip over the Chicago and Alton Railroad,
which has had the gated cars in use for
the pas: two or three years with very sat
isfactory results, and was much impressed
with the innovation and concluded to
adopt the device on the Atlantic system
on one of the regular passenger trains
running between Houston and New Or
leans, the one doing the heavy local busi
ness.
ButMr.Kruttschnitt conceived a collaps
able gate, designed to give even better re
sults than any in use, as his invention
differs from all others in that it extends to
the lowert step, thus completely closing
the entrance to the car platform, and
effectually preventing any one from jump
ing on the car while it is in motion, in
connection with the adoption of the sate
on the division mentioned a rule was put
into effect requiring all passengers to show
theix tickets before entering the cars, sim
ilar also to that in vogue on the road from
which the idea of the gate was taken.
Speaking of this innovation yesterday
Xt, Kruttschnitt said:
"It is a good thing, as seen in the er
penenoe of the Chicago and Alton road.
It keeps people who have no business on
the train off it at the stations. In the
South particularly when a train stops it is
invaaed by idlers and loafers, who go into
the cars to pet a drinfc of ice-water or t
buy a paper from the 'batcher.'
'â¢It also prevents accidents by doing
away with the practice of people jumping
on and off trains while they are in motion,
and furthermore it permits of greater at
tentian being given Â«by conductors to the
running of their trains by making the
man at the gate look after tickets, leaving
the conductor nothing to do but take the
tickets up.
'â¢In tde South the nuisance of people
riding on trains without having provided
theinseives with tickets has become very
great, particularly so with the negroes,
who seeui to have an inherent objection to
buying a ticket. He will never buy one if
he can help it, and trains are often delayed
while the conductor is trying to collect
fares from the darkies.
"In the sugar season a large number of
laborersâ negroes and whitesâ are sent out
to the sugar plantations, and the negroes
will never buy tickets."
"is it not the intention to extend the
new departure to the Pacific system, and,
in fact, to all the passenger trains of the
company?" was asked.
"That," answered Mr. Krutt6chnitt, "I
cannot say at this time. This is really an
experiment ona large scale, and on its re
sults will depend what we shall do else- |
where. The litting of cars with gates is a
; matter of considerable expense, and their
i adoption also requires an extra man to
every two coaches, which, means double
the number of men now on the trains.
"Another evil with which this will do
away is the practice that manv indulge in
of riding between stations without buying j
tickets, hoping that they will not be !
noticed by the conductor until they reach
their destination. It is this idea on the
part of the negroes in the South which
gives us so much trouble.
"Now, take another view of it from the
standpoint of the traveling public. It has
been proven a great convenience to them ;
acro^ the bay. Before we put the gates
on the cars over there the coaches were
usually unduly crowded by people who (
really had no right on the train*. Now,
those who ride find things much more
comfortable.
"The matter of debarring those who
have no tickets going aboard trains is not
a new thing by any mean9 in the East.
There, where they have a pretty heavy
passenger traffic, no one is allowed in the
trainshed except those who have tickets,
and where the gate-cars are used the gate
men are simply transferred from the
station to the train."
On being again asked if it was not con
templated to introduce the pate in this
section Mr. Kruttschnitt replied that they
were now arranging to place gates on all
the trains running between Houston and
New Orleans, and when this had been ac
complished and the results appeared to
warrant it the change would undoubtedly
be made on the Pacific system also. Mr.
Kruttschnitt stated, however, that he
could not even approximate the time when
this would be done.
Among the most important effects of the
general adoption of this system will be, of
course, the complete deprivation of the
| privilege now enjoyed by the people of
Alameda of riding free on the local trains
running between that town and the Oak
land ferry landing.
He Has Been Dangerously Sick With
Pneumonia, but Is Now Better.
United States Minister Albert S. Willis
of Hawaii, who arrived here from Hono
lulu a week ago yesterday, has pneumo
nia and is quite ill. At one time his case
was reeardtd as very dangerous. Dr.
McNutt is attending him.
Mr. Willis took cold on the steamer the
day of his arrival. The next day he went
forth in the rain and caught an additional
cold. On the following morning, when he
had expected to start, he was too ill to get
out of bed, and he has been there ever
since. His wile and son, who arrived with
him, are by hia tide.
It was given out yesterday that the Min
ister's condition was improving. It will
no doubt be some time yet before he can
resume his travels. There were many in
quiries about Minister Willis yesterday.

Miss Lillian Ashley Arrives
From Pasadena Ready
for Court.
WHAT SHE SAYS ABOUT IT.
The Big Trial for $75,000 Damages
Will Begin Before Judge Slack
Next Monday.
Miss Lillian A. Ashley of Pasader.a, the
young woman who is suing Millionaire E.
J. Baldwin for $76,000 for basely deceiving
her, was among the arrivals here yester
day. She has come to consult with her at
torneys, preparatory to the beginning of
the trial on May 4.
Crittenden Van Wyck have the case
in hand for her, and Lloyd & Wood and
Henry E. Highton are going to do all they
can to assist gay Mr. Baldwin to hold on
to his ducats. It will be recalled that
some months ago, when he filed an answer
to Miss Ashley's preliminary suit, he al
leged that his reputation was so notorious
around the country as a Lothario that it
should have been impossible for him to
.have deceived any lady by any sort of
specious argument. This was one reason
why he thought he ought to hold on to j
the $75,O(tO, or any other sum Miss Ashley |
might desire.
Apparently the young lady does not feel
in the njood to grant the millionaire's re
quest, however, and she thinks she can
j make a showing that will not add laurels
j to the erstwhile lucky man's position.
Wuen seen yesterday Miss Ashley was
just setting forth on matters pertaining to
i her case. Sue appeared as a rather tall
j young woman, with dark eyes, a high,
I rather intellectual face and dark hair. Her
manner is modest and retiring.
"My attorneys have asked me not to be
interviewed or go into the details of the
case," said Miss Ashley. "The trial will
begin almost at once, and will, i hope, be
carried through without delay."
At the office of Crittenden Van Wyck
it was stated that the trial would open
on May 4 and that an order had been
made for the 25th in&t as the time for the
direct interrogations, thug giving both
principals time to file their bills of ob
jections. H. C. Cbamblin and K. Y.
Harder will have to do with that part of
the business.
The trial, which is to begin before
Superior Judge 5?lack on Monday next, will
no doubt attract great attention. Baldwin
is so well known and the sum sued for of
so large size that throngs are sure to
attend. The young lady is by no means
devoid of attraction and she will doubtless
arouse deep interest.
Most of the testimony will be by deposi
tion. There have been several taken,
aggregating several hundred pages. The
deposition of Miss Ashley herself is spread
over four hundred and fifty pages. It prom
j ises to be a notable suit. ,
Zeigler and Green Are Still Growling
Over Refereesâ The Men In
Good Condition.
This evening the Olympic Club wiil take
possession of the Mechanics' Pavilion for a
few hours.
Tbe grand fistic exhibition of which so
much has been said and written will be
held under the auspices of the club, and ac
cording to all appearances an immense
crowd will witness the contest.
Zeigler has strongly objected to every
man who has been named by the Olympic
Club for referee. The other boxers who
will take part in the evening's entertain
ment have entered no objections against
the clubs selecting a referee whose duty
it will be to decide all bouts according
to the good or bad performances of the
contestants.
Zeieler is afraid that the Olympic Club
cannot select from its members a man who
will not show some partiality to a club
representative in a boxing bout, conse
quently he bot>es that Manager Kennedy
will select some person who is not a mem
ber of the Olympic Club for referee. Ken
nedy will make his selection to-day, and,
according to his own way of putting it, it
must go rain or shine.
The first eventâ a 10-round "go" between
Zei^ler and Greenâ will be called at 8:30
sharp. This will be followed by four six
round bonta, all of which promise much
excitement to the spectators.
Strange Word Left by a Suicide in thÂ«
Park.
To the already Jong list of suicides is
added that of a man in the old 40er's
raining camp in the park yesterday even
ing.
The body was found by A. Johnson of
the Bay District trade at 8 p. m. The
body lay full length in some shrubbery.
It was evident that the man was about 45
years of age. His height was 0 feet and
he possessed dark hair ana a heavy, dark
mustache.
Near the body lay a barkeeper's apron,
on which was embroidered the initials,
"O. W. H." Tiie suit he wore was a cut
away of a dark material.
Several small scraps of paper lay near
the body. On examination they prove<i
to form "a note, which read as follows: "I
can feel the poison working. I have noth
ing to live for. My wife is a good woman,
but obstinate. I am dying beautifully."
Professor Syle'Â» Lecture in Lincoln

Secretly Carried on in This Country
During the Crimean War.
In the North American Continent the
spirit of adventure is strong. During the
Crimean War I was an attache at the
Washington legation, and as this was
about forty years ago, I do not suppose
that I am disclosing secrets in saying what
then occurred. We received orders to re
cruit a force for the Crimea. This was a
fad of Lord Paninore, who was then War
Minister.
Sir John Crampton. our Minister, vainly
wrote to explain that this might get us into
trouble witn the United States Govern
ment. The only reply was an order to
obey. So we did. I was sent to New York
to look after the recruiting there. We had
a ship In the harbor and we found no
difficulty in filling it. A recruiter got $5
per man, and the man $5, accompanied
with many promises of good things.
When the ship was full it was sent to
Novia Scotia, where we had as
Governor an old soldier with the
reputation of being able to knock any regi
ment into shape. The Government of the
United States soon got wind of our pro
ceedings at New York, and at Niagara,
wnere we had a Hungarian employed to
slip recruits across the frontier. The re
sult was that the members of the legation
at Wastiington and the Consuls at New
York and one or two other places received
their passport?. What particularly amused
me was that the Consul at New York had
had nothing to do with the matter.
But we hau elaborated a far grander
scheme. We had found a sort of filibuster
ing general, who had agreed to provide us
with several thousand men, who were to
be recruited In Texas and the adjoining
Southern States. These were to be com
manded by the general. The negotiations
went off because while we were prepared
to give him the local rank of general in the
Crimea he insisted upon beine made what
ne called a full general in the Britisharmy.
To this we could not assent.
I never could discover what became of
my New YorK recruits. They were landed
in Nova Scotia, and soortly afterward the
Governor telegraphed that they had re
belled, and that tie was going to take steps
to reduce them to a fitting state of dis
cipline. This was the last heard of them.
The Governor was somewhat of a dun
dtrheaded man. We wanted (I forget
why) to have a ship sent from Nova Scotia
to Jamaica. We had a cipher dictionary,
but I could not rind the word Jamaica in
it, bo I telegraphed ttie code words for
"jam" and "acre." Thii was too much
for the Governor's intelligence. Again
and again he telegraphed to ask where the

graphed back referring him to the code
words for 'â¢jam"â "acre." Finally we had

In 1S91 it was decided that the appoint
ments in the British Foreign Office should
be interchangeable with attacheships in
the diplomatic service, and the entrance
examinations were then made the same.
The limits of age are 19 and 25, and the
nomination rests with the Foreign Secre
tary. The scheme of examination em
braces French, German, Spanish, Portu
guese, Russian, Latin, and tne History of
Europe. In 1*92 shorthand was added by
direction of Lord Rosebery, then Foreign
Secretary. The examination in modern
languages is of a very seaching character.
Vacancies are few â about four annually â
and an examination fee of Â£6 is demanded.
Attaches receive no salary until they serve
two years; then they take the place of
third secretaries, with a salary of Â£150.
Second secretaries receive Â£H00 to Â£500,
while commercial attaches get Â£1000 to
Â£1300.
The prospects of clerks are excellent, for
the diplomatic service comprises 132 mem
bers, and Â£1000 is by no means an uncom
mon salary. There are twenty-six Minis
ters with "salaries running from Â£1250 to
Â£6000, while those of Embas3adors vary
from Â£5500 to Â£9000 a year. It is note
worthy that the British Embassadors now
at Washington and Constantinople re
spectively commenced their careers as
junior clerks in the Foreign Office.âCham

Mormon Missionaries Who Are
Bound to Samoa and
Tahiti.
ALL OF THEM ARE YOUNG MEN.
It Is Their Life Work, They Say, and
They Wi 1 Never Come Back
But to Visit.
A delegation of enthusiastic Mormon
missionaries arrived here yesterday and
are at the Russ. The missionaries consist
of A. P. Hitchcock of Richmond, Utah;
David Neff, A. R. Curtis and Jerry C.
Curtis of Salt Lake, and William McDer
mott of Clifton, Idaho.
They are all young men and are bound
to Samoa and Tahiti to labor among the
natives. Messrs. Neff and Curtis will go
to the latter place by the first sailing ship,
and all the others to Samoa on the Mari
posa to-day. None of the young Mormons
have ever done any foreign missionary
work.
"We believe we can do some good to the
natives of those islands, said one of them.
| At any rate we are willing it. Our
church already hasmissionariesthere, who
have met with success.
"The lirst thing we will do will be to
learn the native language. We have books
printed in our publishing-house in Salt
Lake suitable to the needs of the
aboriginees. We will study these books
with them, and I doubt not we will get
along very well.
"In all probability we will stay awav
several years before we can even see this
country again. This is our life woric. We
do not expect to ever give it up."
The young men all aeem imbued with
the responsibility of this undertaking and
are destined to make the most of it.
Council May Fence It Up to Save Male-
ing Kepaira.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 30.â The Coun
cil is wrestling with the problem which is
presented by the Eighth-street bridge over
the estnary to East Oakland. It has been
declared unsafe, and yet it is used by an
electric line and the public at large. The
Finance Committee lias decided thaj it will
be cheaper to fence up the street entirely
than to pay some big damage awards.
There are no funds available this fiscal
year to make the necessary repair3. Street
Superintendent Miller considers this the
proper thing under these circumstances,
as th<Â« city would be very liable to get
into some big damage suits if the bridge
was not immediately repaired or closed.
City Attorney Peirsol was instructed to
look up the law as to whether the city bad
power to fence up the tracks of an electric
line, as would have to be done if the bridge
was fenced. He will present a resolution
to the Council Monday night in accord
ance with his findings.
The bridge carries the 30-inch water
main of the Contra Costa Water Companv,
and the company is now taking the pre
liminary steps to remove it to the Twelfth
street dam. This move is in accordance
with a recent resolution of the Council.
A horse belonging to the Western Meat
Company was so seriously injured on the
bridge recently that it had to be killed.
There is now a bill before the Council for
$ti'JO. Another big break is reported in
the old structure, but the floor will be
patched so as to stand until the necessary
legal steps can be taken to close it to all
traltic.

Ordaining prnyer, Professor George Mooar.
Kight hand of fellowship, Rev. W. D. Wil
linint-, ]).l>., of San Krancisco.
Charges to the new minister with general
address, President J. K, McLean.
Will Take Their Medicine.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 20.â A meeting
of the members of the suspended Lyon
Post, G. A. K., was held last niirht, and it
was practically decided that the best thing
to do was to wait quietly till the ninety
days were up, and then to commence
again and forget about the recent troubles.
A committee of two was appointed to con
sider the turning out of the members on
Memorial day. Thev cannot parade as a
post, so they will probably appear as an
independent body of veterans.
Daughters of Liberty.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 29.â Ookland
Council No. 3, Daughters of Liberty, will
give their next monthly entertainment
and dance at Washington Hall, East Oak
land, to-morrow. The principal feature of

which will be rendered by the ladies and
gentlemen of the council. Icecream and
cake will also be served.
Board of Trade Officers.
OAKLAND, Cat.., April 30.â The newly
elected board of directors of the Oakland
Board of Trade met to-day, with M. J.
Keller in the chair, and elected officers as
follows: J. P. Taylor, president; H. O.
Trowbridge, vice-president ; George B. M.
Gray, treasurer, and Craigie Sharp Jr.,
secretary. The latter was elected a dele
gate to the State Board of Trade. Steps
wiil be taken to establish a permanent
exhibit of manufactures and products of
the county.
Nonsuit Denied.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 30.â The plain
tiff in the case of J. W. Tompkhis and
wife against George S. Montgomery, the
Salvationist, closed their case and a
motion for a nonsuit was denied. The de
fense is now putting in its case. Mrs.
Tom pk ins wants $30,000 damages for in
juries received in a runaway of a four
borse stage claimed to be the line of the
defendant.
Drilling Firemen.
OAKLAND. Cal., April 30.â Chief Fair
of the Fire Department is doiug all in his
power to increase tiie efficiency of the
men under him and is being met half-way
by them. He has instituted a system of
house drills, consisting of familiarizing
the men with their work.
Â» â¦ â Â»
BERKELEY, Cal., April 30.â Residents
of Berkeley on University avenue are con
sidering a proposal to transform the street
into a beautiful boulevard. The avenue is
one of the longest and straightest thor
oughfares in the town, stretching from the
university crounds to the bay. It is pro
posed to line the avenue with shade trees
and have it kept in first-class condition
for a driveway. The work of planting the
trees could be done by the town if favored
by voters, and it is probable that at the
next general election the proposition will
be submitted to the people.
Dr. Watson's Visit.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 30.â Dr. John
Watson of Queen's College, Kingston,
Canada, who is to be the guest of the
Philosophical Union of the university, and
who will deliver several philosophical ad
dresses before that body, is expected to ar
rive in Berkeley to-morrow morning.
Dr. Watson will speak in the new First
Presbyterian Churcu on Monday evening
on "Philosophy From Descurtes to Lieb^
nitz," and on Tuesday evening on "Kant
and Absolute Idealism." He will be the
cuest of Professor Howison while in Berke
ley.
Berg May Go Free.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 30.â The case
of A. Berg, formerly of tne Acheson Hotel,
who is cnarged with violating the liquor
ordinance, will probably be dropped as a
result of the failure of the prosecution in
the case of Doran. The witnesses against
Berg are the same individuals who were
placed on the stand at the trial of Doran,
and as they refused to give the testimony
expected of them at that time, it is pre
sumed that tlieir evidence will also be
worthless in the hearing of Mr. Berg, who
is charged under circumstances similar to
those of Doran.
Woman Suffrage 'Workers.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 30. â Mrs.
Eleanor Carlisle and Mrs. R. P. Thomas
of the Citizen Suffrage League of Berkeley
are endeavoring to organize a woman
suffrage society in West Berkeley. I tie
proposed to establish a West End branch
of t he Berkeley League.

BERKELEY, Cal., April 30.â The uni
versity student theatrical company W'.ich
produced Instructor L. D. Syle's adapta
tion of Conereve's "Love lor Love," at
Shattuck Kali, two weeks ago, will present
the play again next Saturday evening at
the Columbia Theater, in San Francisco,

A Prussian General Who Won a Victory
Without Knowing It.
The allies were holding their own with
difficulty toward Kulin, when suddenly
appeared on the sky-line of the moun
tains to the north the head of a column of
troops. They w ore blue coats and shakos,
and the French at once sent ud loud
cheers, for they looked upon the new
comers as the relief sent by Napoleon. So
they attacked more furiously than ever.
But soon smoke appeared upon the moun
tainside and artillery commenced to play
against the rear of Yandamme's little
army, and the French realized that in
stead of comrades they had Prussians
making an attack upon tbeir rear.
It was the corps of General Kleist, on
his way from Dresden, who was taraily
joining the allies by way of Nolleiuiorf.
When Vandamme saw that his retreat was
threatened, he at once attacked Kleist's
Prussians with all the force he could spare,
still facing the Austrians and Russians,
who now had an easy tight of it. The
allies had a decided advantage in cavalry,
and they soon surrounded the French, so
that Vandamme's only hope was to
breaK through where Kleist Darred the
way.
And so well did Vandamme right that
Kleist, who did not know what was going
on among the Russians and Austrians,
thought himself beaten, and sent a mes
sage to that effect. His men were carried
away along with the wreck of Vandamme's
army, and that nL-ht French and Ger
mans lay down in the woods about Kulm,
completely exhausted, each iti doubt as to
the result of the battle. Both sides agreed
not to tight any more, but to become pris
oners next morning of whichever side
proved to have won the day. Next morn
ing the news was known that Vandamme
had been captured, along with 10,000
Frenchmen and a long list of cannon and
other trophy.
Nobody was more surprised than Kleist
himself. He had seen nothing of the bat
tle excepting disorganized Prussians right
ing impotently, an then being carried
away amidst a stream of fugitives- He
had stumbled upon the scene at 10 o clock
in the morning; had been attached and
had got decidedly the worst of it. He rode
despondently to his tiijrht quarters at Ar
be>au after the day's work was done, and
confided to an intimate friend that he ex
pected to be tried by court-martial for
failing to cut his way through the French,
and thus joining the allies. His despon
dency was heightened, no doubt, by the
consciousness that i>e had not in hh de
feat dode anythingÂ»to relieve the military
â¢ fame of his country. He considered his
career as ended. What, then, was his sur- |
prise to be waked in the middle of the [
night to be told that he was tie winner of !
a glorious battle, that he fad been the
savior of hi* country, and that his King
proposed cloti.ing him with splendid
honors.
Poor Kleist thought it all a dream or a
joke. But it all came true. He was made
a Count Kleist of Nollendorf, and triven a
splendid estate worth three hundred
thousand thalera. He has a grand monu
ment in Berlin, equal to that of Scharn
horst or Stein.
Vandamme, on the other hand, had
made an excellent fight of it; had counted
upon the assistacce of Napoleon, which j
never came, and been defeated. The Czar I
sent him to Siberia, and had him trans
ported like a hiphwaymRn, exposed at
every posthouie to the hootings of the
mob. Â«
Such are the fortunes of war. â Poultney I

An Insane Man Turned Away
From the Receiving Hcs
pital.
JUDGE SANDERSON'S OBDER.
I. G. Fredrickson's Friends Finally
Appealed to the Court for
Assistance.
It took an order of court signed by Supe
rior Judcre Sanderson to get I. Q. Fredrick
son, a man whose mental condition ren
dered it necessary that be should be
restrained, into the Receiving Hospital
yesterday to await an examination by the
authorities as to his titness to be at large.
Fredrickson's friends have noticed for
several days that his actions were strange,
and yesterday they came to the conclusion
that his mind was unbalanced and that
he should be taken care of in some secure
place until he either recovered or was de
clared insane.
He was accordingly placed in a hack
and conveyed to the Receiving Hospital,
where the physician in charge was re
quested to admit him until he could be
taken care of elsewhere, the representa
tion being ma'le that he was likely to in
jure himself or others if not kept in re
straint. The answer was that the hospital
was full and that the man must be taken
to some other institution. In vain the
friends who were caring lor Fredrickson
expostulited. The physician was obdu
rate, and the man, who was becoming
violent, was taken to the City Prison, his
friends not knowing where else to leave
him. Here he was put into an ordinary
cell, the prison furnishing no other ac
commodations, and those who had inter
ested themselves in his behalf hurried off
to ascertain what course to pursue to havÂ«
him properly earea for.
An attorney was consulted and he coun
seled calling on the Superior Court. Judge
Sanderson was indignant when he learned
of the refusal of the Receiving Hospital
authorities to admit Fredrickson.
"Draw up an order of court directing
the physician in charge to admit this man
immediately," he said, "ana I will
sign it."
Within a few moments Fredrickson's
friends had procured the order and were
back at the prison, where two stalwart po
licemen were keeping a sharp watch on
the man to prevent his injuring himself
by dashing his head against the iron bars
or stone wall- of the cell.
The Receiving Hospital people made no
further objection to receiving Fredrickson
when the order of court was presented to
them, and he was made as comfortable as
the circumstances would permit. It is be
lieved that Fredrickson's aberration is not
of a permanent character, and that with
proper treatment he will recover within a
short time.
An effort will be made 10 have Judge
Sanderson join with Judge Kebbard in
trying to induce the Supervisors to make
proper provision for insane patients at the
Receiving Hospital.
Among women it is always considered
good manners to go around to the back
door of a neighbor's hou^e when on a bor
rowing errand, to the side door when on
an informal visit and to the front door
when making a formal call. â From the

the trades In May wheat came to-day. The longs

unimportant changes In crop prospects. It stated
that some central localities still lacked moisture.

not hold so well late in the session, the demand
showing no urgency, but Immediately prior to the

Survey of the Situation From a Can
ner's Standpoint. ..V.-: ;, ; : \.'.
The Cutting Tacking. Company has the following
forecast of the fruit crop this year, as regards the
recent frosts:
Aside from the business aspect of the market the
principal feature of interest baa been the continued
frosts, occurring at intervals during the past thirty
days, that have been unparalleled in the history of
the fruit industry of the State. It was supposed
for awhile that the early frosts in March were of
temporary effect and short-lived in their results,
and such might have been the case had they not
been followed by others of a still more severe
character, not only for one or two days, but for a
week or more. Of course, it is unreasonable to
suppose that the Dimness community as a whole
will agree in the conclusions that we have been
forced to arrive at, that th.. 1 crop as a whole has
been seriously damaged, Because they have been
over and over again deceived in this respect in
previous years, but the fact remains, nevertheless,
and although we are always slow to believe reports
of such serious damage, in the present case we Â«re
forced to state, as an honest conclusion, that the
crop us a whole baa been damaged to the extent of
fully 40 per cent.
we do not say by this that there will be 60 per
cent of an average crop, but rather that the crop
: of the present year has been damaged in that pro
portion. This damage applies In a general way to
ail fruit localities la the State, although it was
confined for <julte a while to certain localities,
notably those north of the latitude of Marysviil.-,
during the lirst half of March, since which date
both the frosts and continued cold weather and
ra.lus have operated disastrously in all other locali
, ties without exception, so that there is no fruit re
gion in the state, large cr small, out what has been
visited -and the crop depleted thereby. This ap
plies â¢ especially to almonds, apricots, cherries,
| peaches and prunesâ pears and plums have not, as
a whole, been treated so badly.. â¢ . â â  . .'â¢â¢
I Although our information is special and reliable;
we are not fully convinced yet of the tinal damage,
because the recuperating forces of the deciduous
fruit-tree are immense, and good results may.yet'
follow It the weather be propitious: but us it will
take fully a month to arrive at such couclu sion we.
j feel that it is proper to put the facts as they- now.,
appear and .follow them later by -further informa
. tion as it may â â come to US. - At present we are "ii

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 30. f
The bright sunshine of to-day cheered
the hearts of the Fabiola Floral Fete man
agement as nothing else could have doue.
Out at the trotting park, where the
f. esÂ»a is to be held, many busy squads of
men worked till far into the niglit finish
ing the stands, completing the fences aud
running the heavy roller over the cycling
track. The headquarters of the lete in
the Central Bank building were no less
busy than was the scene of to-morrow's
gayety and contests. President Davis ana
Grand Marshal G. B. Daniels issued their
final orders and made their last arrange
ment, and when the day closed everything
that could be done to insure a highly suc
cessful fete had been clone.
To-morrow the whole city will be given
over to gayety. The department at Wash
ington has given permission for the Post
office to be closed as oh a legal holiday;
the banks have agreed to suspend busi
ness, the residents have said that the day
shall be a general holiday, and so Oakland
will transform itself into one gteat enter
tainment committee to receive the thou
sands of visitors that will come from all
the surrounding counties.
The order of events is as follows:
10:30 a. m.â Preliminary heat bicycle races.
12 M.â Lunch.

Considerable interest is being shown in
tne novelty class. The veteran firemen
will enter it with their old hand engine,
'â¢Vigilant 9," and will probably take the
prize, although the class is a wide one and
leaves ample room for surprises.
The Fabiola souvenirs this year eclipse
all formor efforts in this line. The books
8re now out, and the neat make-up re
flects much credit on the committee which
had charge.
The attractive volume contains eighty
pagos, exclusive of cover?, and is printed
on the best o! book paper. It is descrip
tive of Alameda County, though the cus- j
tomary tedious descriptions are entirely i
hbsent. instead, the various attractions i
are portrayed by over forty tine half-tona
cuts, and as a handsome souvenir the vol
ume is well worth the small amount
charged for it.
Amen? the illustrations are the "Golden
Gate," scenes at the fete of '95, cuts of
various prominent buildings and streets, '
views of Lake Merritt and Lake Chabot, i
pictures of the High .School, Fabiola Hos
pital, State University, Young Men's
Christian Association and Mills College,
and many descriptive bits of rural life and
agricultural products of the couaty.

That Theme Handled by J. M.
Lewis, the Theological
Graduate.
The Pacific Seminary ths S:cn? of
an Ordination and Alumni
Banquet.
Oakland Office Sax Frvncipco Call,)
808 Broadway, April 30. f
The commencement exercises of the Pa-
J cific Theological Seminary were held this â¢
morning in the chapel of that institution.
There were three in the graduating class:
.T. M. Lewis, wno received the degree of
bachelor of divinity, and Messrs. Arthur
j P. Alexander and Alfred Bailey, who took â 
j the English course and received the usual '.'â 
I certificates.' 'â  â '.-. .â¢â /. â  :,'V â  ."'â .: / i
There was a large attendance of friends
of the graduates and the institution. Mr.
| Alexander's subject was "Foreign Mis
j sions,'" while Mr. Bailey considered the
I "influence of Christianity on Our Civiliza
\ tion." ' â¢ " . ;â  '. â â¢ : â ' [ ."' _ ; :â â  - _'â¢ ;
The interest centered in Mr. Lewis, as
; he *v as to be ordained a minister during
tbe alternoon. His subject was "Christ
and the Novel." He said:
"Novelists tell us that it is the province
! of fiction to please. Yes, but fiction has
no moral right to degrade. The tendency i
I in modern literature is to reveal the un- !
clean, the impure, the loathsomeness, the !
beastliness of human life. It deals with <
', characters wallowing; in the mire of their i
; own immorality. It pictures a society :
in the sewers of its animalism. And I
t ii, forsooth, is called 'art.' It is false.
There is no inspiration in it. It suggests
; no thought of a higher life. It lifts no soul
I to a purer atmosphere. It has the odor of
j hell about it. 3ola, the Nero of modern fie- |
' tion, defends himself and his school in this !
i class of literature. 'If.' he says, 'I have j
I once shown you every known detail of
J every known sin, and the list, it must be j
i confessed, is a Ions one, you will then be
glad to Tvalk purely in" your appointed
path. You will remember what I have
described to you and be cautious.'
"It may be 'a study of character,' but it
is a study of character in its immoral ;
i phases. It is a study of the beast, and i
not of the man. Its heroes are Eeducera,
1 courtesans, liars and hypocrites. It turns '
its face away from the true, the noble and
the good. It ignores the divine in man. ;
It denies a beneficent God. Ana men sit
in the gloom of their own ruins, sad and ;
.disconsolate, weighted down with the per- |
sistency of evil, with no heaven of inspira
tion to inspire them to the ideals of life.
Faith i3 lost amid the debris of Humanity,
and man 'wandeTS in eternal space, ray
iess and painless.' Such a literature par
alyzes. Its influence disintegrates the
foundation of character, It sneers at re
ligion,it mocks, at sin, and teaches the
mind new possibilities of crime.
"This is a poor apology, poor philoso
phy. MuÂ«t a man go down into hell to
know what heaven is? Must a man asso
ciate with licentiousness to know what
purity means ? Must a man have fcept
step with Deelzebub to Ijarn to walk with
Christ? We are uttering no bigoted pro
test against iictioti. "We are simply bring
ing the ethics of Christianity to bear upon
it. Nor are we advocating the namby
pamby literature of someâand this some
is largeâ Sunday school libraries. We are
simply demanding a manly and healthy
tone for the nobiest of all art, the art of
letters. But the French realism â^nd trie
tendency .is increasing in American litera
ture-^-in" which this art is clothed, prt-sents
a morbid appearance. It is naturalistic,
niaterialistic, in all its conceptions. Kay,
t presents false views of life, a false
psychology, a false morality."
The young man was ordained this after
noon, and durine the evening the aluomi
enjoyed a banquet, during which speeches
ii toasts were the order from many who
had spent their closing schooldays within
the walla of the institution.

Fire Department.
AL.AMEDA, Cal., April 30.â The trus
tees of the Fire; Department relief lund
held a meeting in the Chief's office last
night. The only business of importance
was the consideration of a resolution sent
by Sherman Hose Company No. 3 to stop
all payments to the relief tund when it
has reached the amount of $1500, and only
resume them to keep the total at that
figure.
The resolution was made to prevent the
money accumulating faster than it is
wanted, so that in the case of a paid Fire
Department coming into existence â one
of the possibilities of the futureâ there
would not be too lar.e a nestegg to
revert to the city. When the question
came up to remit the subject to the com
panies interested in the matter the six
trustees were found to be equally divided
in opinion. Those against the resolution
wanted the limit raised to $Jo00. Eventu
ally Chief Krauth changed his vote to the
ayes and the matter will now be consid
ered at the Slay meetings of the com
panies.

. . by a Kunavay.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 30.â Mrs. O. S.
Orrick and a little daughter bad a narrow
escape from serious if not fatal injuries on
Broadway shortly after noon to-day. Mrs.
.1 Orrick was driving up the street, when a
spirited team of .C. A. Heron's came dash
ing toward her.
At first she aid not notice it was a run
away, as there was a man in the buggy.
When she realized that the team was un
controllable it was too late to avoid a col
lision. In attempting to turn out the
other buggy was given a chance *o lock
: with its rear wheel the rear whee of her
: carriage.
Both carriages were demolished, and
Mrs. Orrick and her baby daughter were
i thrown under the buggy and thÂ» drivtr of
j the other vehicle upon the pavement. 1.
: M. Hloper ol San Francisco, at the risk of
i his life, rescued the little girl from under
the horses' feet after the animals had
I fallen.
The horses broke loose and continued
on their way down Broadway. Hundreds
of willing hands made but" a moment's
work to extricate Mrs. Orrick from
the debris. They were able to walk
into a drugstore near by, where Dr.
Frank Adams rendered assistance. He
found that they had escaped with a few
scratches, but baa fear of the nervous
shock that follows. Later Mrs. Orrick
was taken home. She is a sister of Irvine

Military Students at Berkeley
Don't Like to Be

Lieut. Winn's Method of Preventing
His Class From Cribbing in
the Examination.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 30.â The stn
denis at the State University who took the
military examinations to-day are much
incensed at the new system of keeping
guard over them to prevent "cribbing"
which was introduced this morning by
Lieutenant Winn.
Dunne the entire periods of the exam
inations, both morning and afternoon,
officers and "non-coms" were detailed to
pace up and down the aisles for the pur
pose of reporting to the department any
one who was caught "giving or receiving
information." The slander, a3 it is re
i yarded, of thus assuming that such espion
age is necessary has aroused much indig
nation in the student body.
The "war department" of the university
has always been unpopular with the
students and the innovation of to-day's ex
aminations will probably not tend to mend
matters.
No More llorsecara.
BERKELEY, Cal. April 30.â The Clare
mont, Ferries and University Street Rail
way Company is about to substitute gaso
line motor power for the horses now in
use on the system between East and West
Berkeley. Preparations for the change
have already been begun and the horses
will all be retired wituin a month. The
cars will be enlarged by lengthening the
platforms at each end. It is said that the
gasoline motors to-be used will enable the
curs to move with as much speed as a
trolley-car, thus giving qu:.k communica
tion between the two ends of the town;

Close of A. K. P. Harmon's
Long Life of Activity
and Success.
WAS A PIONEER OF '49.
He Took the Nucleus of His Big
Fortune From the Early
Gold Mines.
MET WITH MUCH ADVERSITY.
But He Triumphed Over All, and at
His Death Fnled Many Honorable
Positions.
Oakland Office ban Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, April 30. j"
After three-quarters of a century of
active life A. K. P. H&rraon died this
morning at his |residence on Webster
street. About a year ago his wife died and
since then he has been in failing health
and for the last four months it has been
apparent that the end was not far away.
A. K. P. Harmon's life was one continu
ance of successes. At the time of his
death he was a director of the Bank of
California, director of the Security Sav
ings Bank, vice-president of the Arctic
Sieam-whaling Company, trustee of Mills
Colleee, president of the Mountain View
Cemetery Association and president of the
Chollar, Potosi, Imperial, Silver Hill and
Challenge mining companies.
He was born at Scarborough, Cumber
land County, Me., in 1821. He served as a
clerk in early life in Portland, Me. In
1848 he left the East for California, taking
passage first to Chagres. At that time no
through ticket3 were sold, and the journey
was a dangerous one. It did not frighten
young Harmon, though, and on arrival at
Chagres he walked across the isthmus to
Panama, where he remained six weeks and
then took passage on the Oregon for San
Francipc >.
As an idea of the discomforts of travel in
those days it may be mentioned that Mr.
Harmon and hi9 companions made the
trip up ChÂ« coabt In a room improvised out
of the two forward deck boats.
It was April, 1849, when Mr. Harmon
finally landed in San Francisco. He did
not tarry in that settlement long, but at an
early opportunity took passage on a small
schooner for Sacramento, paying $30 for
the privilece of being on board the boat.
An oi team was now secured, and Mr.
Harmon and his friends proceeded to
Coloma, where they went to work in the
mines. His tirst day's labor was rewarded
with an ounce of dust, and under tbese
encouraging conditions he worked for
quite awhile. He left the diggings, though,
to participate in thÂ» rush to Spanish Bar, j
where tie again encountered good luck i
and amassed quite a small fortune.
The subjoined biographical sketch is
furnished by Henry B. Livingston, histori
ographer of the Society of California
Pioneers.
The deceased was born in Scarborough
Me., July 13, 1821. Hia lather, John M.
Harnion, was a prosperous farmer of 'â â 
Oxford County.
After acquiring the rudiments of a
common school education in his native
town the lad when 14 years of age went .to
Portland, where he served as clerk in a
grocery-store during the following two
years. For a>irnilaT period he acted in a ;
like capacity in Scarborough, and at the '
expiration of the iatter term journeyed to i
Darien, Ga. He again resumed clerking
lor two years, when he' .began trading on
his own account. He opened a farstore,
and subsequently, under the name and firm
of Boothby it Harmon, continued in busi
ness until 1847. On the dissolution of this
partnership the young merchant met with
his first serious loss in the destruction of
his effects by fire.
At the outbreak of the eold fever in
California Mr. Harmon, with character
istic impulsiveness, resolved to be in the
van of the grand army of adventurers I
bound to the new El Dorado of ttte Occi
dent. A company of four companions
with himself was organized and duly
christened the "B. 0. R. Co." Without
loss of time they hastened to New York
and set sail for Chagres early in Decem
ber, 1848. A tedious delay of nearly two
mom. >s on the isthmus was happily ter
minated by the arrival from New York
via the Strait of Magellan of the steam
ship Oregon. He had no steamer ticket, â 
but fortunately through the kindly offices
of Agent Kandell he secured passage at
the regular rates. As an illustration of
the exorbitant prices demanded for tickets
it may be stated that at this time the late
J. B. Bidleman paid $950 at auction for a
Bingle fare^to San Frauciaco. Owing to the
crowd Mr. Harmon was compelled to sleep i
every ni>;ht in a quarter boat.
On* April 1. 1#49, the ship entered the
Golden Gate. She found the sister steamer ;
California swinging at anchor in this bav, i
a forlorn craft, her crew having deserted
and vamosed to the mines. In order io
save his own sailors Captain Pearson of
the Oregon ran his ship under the guns of
the United States man-of-war Ohio, and
her commodore, Catesby Jones, held the
iacktars on board the frigate until the
Oregon was reaay to leave on her down
ward trip to Panama.
Mr- Harmon and company pitched their
tent on Clay street, but at the expiration
of a week chartered a schooner and sailed
I up to Sacramento. The restless udventu
j rers here hired a team and pushed on to
Coloma, then the busy center of tne min
ing region. His first days digging
yielded him $16. A big enterprise was
that of turning the channel of the middle
fork of the American River at Spanish
bar.
A party of thirty-six, of whom Mr. Harmon
was one, entered upon t-e work, but aban
doned it without realizing a dollar. After
i digging with fair success for four months,
he turned his back on the Sierras, came
down to San Francisco and took a trip to
tne Atlantic States. He purchased mer
chandise in New York, shipped the same
to California and realized verv hand
somely on the speculation. He had a
i partner on Montgomery street named
i Quimby. They built a store on Merchant
i street, which went down in the big fire of
1850. The structure was rebuilt, and in it
the firm did business until the dissolution
of partnership in the fall of '50.
The theater of our argonaut's enterprises
! was now changed to Sacramento. Here
he became associated in the boot and shoe
trade with T. S.Mitchell. They fitted up
aline store, for not only city trade, but
country customers.
It became a popular emporium. Thither
resorted the rough dieter,; who cheerfully
paid his six ounces (?:Â»G) lor "No. 12 hip
< rubbers"; and here, too, the buxom dame
1 from just "the plains across" came to be
titted to ladies' "six" gaiters. The fire
; which on November 2, 1852, nearlv blotted
j Sacramento from existence, burned their
store, which was soon rebuilt. The title of
the firm was subsequently changed to
j Knight, Mitchell <fe Child*, and again to
j Harmon & Co. During his residence in
the capital city, Mr. Harmon identified
himself with various eleemosynary and
social societies, and was universally re
garded as a Dublic-spirited and in flue n
! tial citizen. His removal to the Bay I
I caused profound regret in the circle of his I
; numerous menus.
tor upward of thirty-five years the sub
! iect of this biographical sketch was active
j ly engaged in extensive mining enter
: prises. He was the official head of some
j of the richest, most substantial ana per
j manent Nevada companies. As president
! of those powerful organizationsâ the Chol
i lar, Potosi, Jackson and others â he man- I
; aged the same shrewdly and successfully,
i He invariably enjo3ed*the fullest cpnfi
| deuce of nis associates, whq never doubted
â¢ his ability and integrity.
Our deceased pioneer was first married
in New York to Miss Marietta Randall.
By her he had a daughter and son, the
former born in Portland and the latter in
I Sacramento. She died in 1876 at Oakland,
; and two years thereafter he wedded Miss
| Sarah Johnson in Portland, Maine. Her
death occurred last year in Oakland.
For a quarter of a century prior to his
; demise Mr. Harmon resided in the beauti
! ful suburban city of Oakland. Hern lie
! erected a beautiful homestead, including
j a spacious conservatory, fitted with rare
I exotics, native flowers and shrubbery,
i thereby enhancing the attractiveness of
â  the grounds, which are picturesquely laid
out and cared for with exquisite taste.
During his long resilience in Oakland,
â¢ Mr. Harmon was foremost in promoting
; the best interests of the community. He
ever showed iiimsell to be a representative j
iman in the truest sense of the word. Of !
I great business capacity, of unswerving in- |
! tegrity, his counsel and advice were eagerly \
[ sought after and cueerfully availed af. ,
In i>olitics the deceased was an earnest i
and conscientious Republican, and in his
religious belief a Cohgregationalist, the f:
family attending the church of that de- '
nomination while under; the pastorate of
j Rt-v. Dr. J. R. McLean. \ 0 â¢ .'
In social life Mr. Harmon justly com
! manded the respect and esteem of his fel
j low-men and the sincere affection of his
devoted friends. His unostentatious acts
â  of benevolence have lightened many a
; troubled heart, and li is kind words cheered
many a perturbed spirit.
His loss will be deeply deplored in this
community, and more especially by the
Association of California Pioneers, of which
he Jaad lor many years been a life mem
ber, and frequently an incumbent of va
: rious offices within their gift.
The funeral notice will be found in an- !
other column of the present issue of this 1
journal.

ASSAULTED BY J. LEWIS
The Victim Thrown Down in a
Deserted Alley and Se
verely Used.
POLICEMAN BOBLES' CAPTURE.
Heard the Struggle in the Dark and
Succeeded in Arresting the
Offender.
Another supposed strangier is behind
the bars of the City Prison, and unlike
those who have preceded him he is in a
measure self-confessed and was also caught
in the very act of throttling a woman of
the half world in a dark and deserted
alley off Montgomery street, near Wash
ington.
It was at an early hour this morning
when the crime was committed, and at
that time, the electric lights being out, it
was dark as pitch.
Officer F. Robl, who patrols Mont
gomery street, was walking aloug his
beat, when he was startled upon reach
ing Merchant alley, to hear the gurg
ling sound of a strangling human being.
His mind being full of the recent out
rageous murders, he quickly arrived at the
conclusion that another helpless woman
was beint: assassinated and rustied up the
alley. Just as he reached the center of the
block, he heard si man's voice cry out: "II
you cry, I will strangle you to death as I
did the other notorious women of your
class."
This spurred him on in his search and
finally he spied a lar^e man with his
tinkers clutched around the throat of a
woman who was pivstrate on the pave
ment.
The would-be assassin and the officer
saw each other at the same time ami the
former released hi* hold on his victim and
sprang a* if to escape, hut Kobl was too
quick for him and soon hail him safely
ironed.
The woman then got up and both were
started lor the California-street Police
Station. On reaching the light it was ob
served that the victim of the assault was a
young colored woman.
When they reached the station a mes
senger was dispatched for Detective Ben
Bohen and in the meantime the man was
charged with battery. Up gave the name
of John Lewis and said that he was an
iron-molder by occupation. He failed,
however, to explain the motive which led
him to assault and nearly murder the
young colored woman.
When Detective Bohen arrived the girl
toi<l her story. She said her name is
Isabella Morris and that she livÂ«s in
Hinckley alley. "I was going through
Merchant street, " slÂ»- said, "in order to
buy some medicine at a drugstoie on
Montgomery street, near Clay. As I
reached the center of the block the prisoner
jumped on me and threw me to the
ground. He gra&ped my throat with one
hand and placed the other over my mouth
to prevent me from making an outcry.
"To add to my terror he kept cautioning
me not to make an outcry, as he said that
in event I did he would strangle me to
death as he had strangled several other
girls of mv class during the last rive
months. This failed to silence me, how
ever, but I could make no outcry and only
a gurgling sound came from my lips when
I tried to scream.
"Finally he released hia Lold and I im
mediately saw that it was a policeman
who had turned the tide in my favor. 1
honestly believe that if he had not been
interrupted in his work I would have been
strangled to aeath."
While she was telling her story the
prisoner stood by but never offered to
contradict her statements. When she had
finished he was led back into his cell
mumbling incoherent sentences as he
wal ked.
Detective Bohen, although he is not sure
that Lewis is responsible for the recent
murders, is not certain that he is not, and
he will be heid pending a lengthy inves
tigation, in any event he will be convicted
of assault and battery, and while he is
serving his sentence the detectives will
have ample time to look up his record.

The Meteoric Jules Mersfelder
Proved a Clever Imi
tator.
SIDE BY SIDE IN A STORE.
Keith Went Wild and the Artists
Grinned â Eccentricities of the
Young Painter.
Something has happened in art circles
in this City to disturb the even temper of
William Keith and to set the artists all a
laughing. Gossip of the studio has it that
the eminent landscape painter is furious
and indignant. At the same time the artists
draw mental pictures of Keith in his gal
lery on Pine street tearing out his hair
and fuming all afcout the oriental carpets.
And the innocent cause of it all â Jules
Mersfelder, votary of what he used to call
the "quality school," is far, far away.
Mersfelder's meteoric career went out in
San Francisco quite recently. His fading
away from the local artistic firmament
contained a pathetio story hidden beneath
the surface, and, unconsciously, it was ac
companied by a little transaction which
ruflled the lofty soul of his beau ideal-
Keith. Bringing the subject down to the
present, there are paintings by Mersfelder
and Keith side bv side in a Geary-street
art store, and only competent judges of
technique in 'painting ran distinguish
which is Keith s and which Mer?felder's.
Such a thing became possible through
the ambition of the young artist.
"It dawned upon me early in my
c.reer," he excluinied one d:iy in the
Press Club, "that it was ray destiny to be
distinguished as an exponent of the qual
ity school of painting. I went East and
studied, and was recognized in New York,
where my pictures had the place of honor
in the exhibition."
He produced a well-worn catalogue with
a sketch of a marine painted by him and
exhibited in the New York Academy of
Arts.
"That is proof of what I say," he con
tinued. "1 despise pretensions.
"I met Innes there, and found that he
and I were following the same ideals. We
painted in the quality school. Now that
reminds me. People out here have said
that 1 imitate Keith. Ridiculous. Keith
is a great artist, I admit, but he is work
ing in the same direction. That is all
there is in the similarity, of our work.
There is soul in the landscape when
painted in the impressionist, quality
style."
Then some friend of Mersfelder tendered
him a benefit concert in Golden Gate Hall,
ile had been exceedingly unfortunate in
disposing of his pictures ever since he
painted the panorama of San Francisco
lor the Columbian Exposition. The con
cert gave bim a new startand with the
generous !oan of costly Turkish rugs and
draperies he fitted up a studio in the St.
Anne's building.
"Now, indeed, do I feel inspired to per
form great deeds," Mersfelder exclaimed,
as he reclined on an oriental couch. "If
the artists of San Francisco were not j?al
ous of me, if they would only give me a
chance I know my pictures would create a
sensation."
He worked industriously for a month.
He went into the country and made
sketches of trees, and painted half a dozen
large scenes of glades in the forest. "A
Fojtcj Morning in the Oaks," "An Open
ing in the Forest" and "Sunset." the last
representing the glow of evening glinting
upon an autumnal scene tinging the foli
age with fantastic hues. These were the
best efforts of the month, not devoid oi
merit, and remarkably similar to some of
Keith's picture*. But the second month's
rent upBft the ambitious young artist's
nerves. The luxurious draperies of the
East were returned and Mersfelder disposed
of his whole stock of pictures to the Geary
street dealer for â "a song."
It seems that some of Keith's paintings
were in the same store, one of them a $ 1500
beauty lately purchased by C. IV Hun
tington.
As the story goes, Keith dropped into
the artstore the other day. The first thing
his eye met was this picture, and then be
side it were the copies of Mersfelder'^, all
looking so nearly alike that the uninitiated
might easily believe the one artist painted
the entire iot. The master of landscape
went wild at the sight and angry words
Jollowed, with the result that the dealer
and he are friends no more.
"The pictures were like peas in a pod,"
an artist explained when laughing with
fellow-painters over the story.
Mersfelder vanished from the City im
mediately after selling his pictures. He
met Chris Jorgensen on the Sacramento
train, and confided to him that he was co
ins to bis only iriend in New York. The
artists and connoisseurs here had con
spired against him, so he declared.
Whereat be wept bitter tears. He had a
ticket to Sacramento, and appeared in
styliph attire. â¢
And now a story comes from Sacramento
of a wonderful <lash maae there by the im
pressionist artist. It was told in Chris
Jorgensen's class at the capital. Accord
ing to it Mersfelder went to the best hotel
in town and pave out tbat he was there on
a contract with Mrs. Crocker to paint some
great historical picture. Anyhow, he got
the best apartments in the hotel, and set
the place by the ears with language that
passed through his sombrero. He put on
tremendous airs, and talked big things
about art, and Mrs. Crocner s order in par
ticular, till at last the people imagined
that Raphael had come back again to
earth and somehow alighted in Sacra
mento. This did not last long, however,
for Mersfelder had to subdue bis soaring
fancies abruptly. The latest account is he
lost himself somewhere at the other side
of the Capital city.
No AdmUalon Charge To-DÂ»y at the
Murk Hopkins Institute.
To-day being the first Friday of the
month of May, the superb spring exhibi
tion of patronage by San Francisco artists
will be open to all, free of charge, at the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. An the
weather indications point to a bright,
sunshiny day. a very large throng may bo
expected. Possibly the existing record of
2000 admissions on a single day may be
surpassed.
The paintings displayed at the magnifi
cent mansion on the hill are hiehly credit
able and worthy of careful study. Nothing
is more gratifying to W. G. Stafford, the
genial secretary of the Art Association, to
Mr. Martin, the manager, and to the lead
ing teachers, Messrs. Stanton, Joullui
Matthews, Yelland and Tilden, than pub
lic appreciation of tne work of local artists.
.Several directors have sipniiied a desire
to be present to-day and assist Mr. Martin
in extending a cordial welcome to all visit
ors. The teachers, as well as the pupils,
vie with Mr. Searlosintha purpose to make
the institute popular.

Beautiful Gateway Being
Built for Stanford
Campus.
SYMBOLIC OF SUCCESS.
Massive Designs in Stone, Sur
mounted by Bronze
Sphinxes.
WILL BE THE MAIN ENTRANCE.
Designed by C. E. Hodges, and to
Be Completed Before Com
mencement Day.
As a fitting monument to Mrs. Stan
ford's ultimate triumph in the great Gov
ernment suit for $15,000,000, a beautiful
gateway is being erected at the main en
trance to the university campus.
It is the first substantial building in
keeping with the original designs of the
extensive quadrangle group that has
been attempted since the death of Senator
Stanford nearly three years ago; for soon
after that the estate became involved in
the litigation that barred all its sources of
revenue and left the university dependent
solely upon Mrs. Stanford's private for
tune for its necessary expenses, amount
ing to nearly $1000 a day.
In Hie minds of students and visitors first
passing through the portals, the new
sphinx-crowned pillars will hereafter
be associated with victory and wisdom, and
when the present seniors shall go out from
their alma mater at the end of this month
as graduates, content in the assured pros
perity of the institution, the sentiment
connected with the new gateway will leave
a lasting impression of one of the best tra
ditions of the college.
Each gatepost is formed of rough-hewn
yellow sandstone blocks, with four stone
pillars at the corners, and on the top of
tins substantial pile 13 to be a solid block
of stone as a pedestal fora bronze Egyptian
sphinx that will surmount the whole anu
make the top of the gatepost fully eighteen
feet above the ground.
From the accompanying sketch, made
from the designs of Charles Edward
Hodges, the university architect, may be
gained a good idea of the general appear
ance of the whole structure, which will be
completed about May 13.
Mr. Hodges is hIso authority for the
statement that the long-expected and
much-neded large auditorium or hall for
popular lectures will probably soon be
built.
The temporary chaptl building with
seats for 400 has long been made to accom
modate over 600 on special occasions, when
the extra persons have had to stand in
compact bodies and occupy every avail
able space on the sills of the tiers of small
windows peculiar to the Moorish architec
ture.
It is probable also that this deco
rative gateway marks only the beginning
of more extensive buildings to be erected
on the campus in accordance with the
elaborate but uncompleted plans suggested
by the present beautiful quadrangle.
The gateway marks the Palo Alto en
trance to the grounds, and is within 100
yards of the railroad station. At it begins
also the Palo Alto avenue, a broad drive
wav skirted by fan palms and leading to
thÂ« quadrangle, a mile to the southward,
and yet not half way across the great tree
covered campus, which covers an area of
4800 acres.
G. Uccelli of Ocean View had his father-in
law, G. Ghiorso, arrested yesterday morning
on a warrant. He said that Ghiorso on
Wednesday chased him out of his house with
a shotgun, and ne tooK refuge in the House
of Correction. He was also chased by his
father-in-Kw's bulldog. Ghiorso then went
into Uecelli's house and let all his wine out on
the floor. Ghiorso blames Uccelli for beinjr
unkind to his young wife.

The State has brought suit against the City
for $7000 due for criminals' keep at the
Whittier Reform School. The City does not
repudiate the debt, but claims it has do
money, so the State must wait as other cred
