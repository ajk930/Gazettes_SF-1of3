Are Maintained.
SECURE IN STRENGTH.
Love of Peace Had Been Taken
as a Sign of the Nation's
Weakness.
AS TO THE FLYING SQUADRON.
Not Intended as a Menace to Any
Country, but for Use in an
Emergency.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 21.â The Right
Hon. Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of
State for the Colonies, delivered a speech
to-night at a banquet given by natives of
Queensland residing or visiting in London.
A few weeks ago, he said, Great Britain
seemed to stand alone, surrounded by
jealous competitors, and was assailed with
altogether unexpected hostility. Long
standing differences appeared to suddenly
come to a bead and assume threatening
proportions.
The quarters whence she might have
looked for friendship and consideration
confronted her instead with suspicion and
even hate. England dad to recocnize that
her success, however legitimate, was im
puted as a crime ; that love of peace
was taken as a sign of weakness, and her
indifference to foreign criticism as an in
vitation to insult.
He regretted to be forced to admit that
such feelings existed, but he rejoiced, see
ing that they did exist, that they had
found expression. No better service had
ever been done the nation, tor it had
enabled her to show her face to the
world. England, while resolute to
fulfill her obligations, was equally
determined to maintain her rights.
[Cheers.] England, if isolated, stood
Becure in the strength of her own re
sources, in the firm resolution of her peo
ple, without respect to party, and in the
abundant loyalty of her children from one
end of the empire to the other.
At the conclusion of his speech, Mr.
Chamberlain was heartily cheered and ap
plauded.
The Right Hon. George J. Goschen,
First Lord of tl>e Admiralty, made a speech
at Grinstead to-day, in the course of which
be said he wished to dissipate the alarm
ing rumors that were in circulation.
Referring to the flying squadron he said it
was intended for use in case of
an emergency in any direction.
It would go to Berehaven without
taking sealed or other orders except to
proceed to that place and await instruc
tions. The squadron was not intended as
a menace to any country, nor was it des
tined for any particular quarter nf the
world. It would be used as otner squad
rons are used.
Mr. Goschen ay^Dealed to the public if
they heard that the squadron has been
ordered anywhere not to imagine that it
had been sent to menace anybody. The
disposal of the squadron could not be
guided by political considerations while
the situation remained as it is now.
He denied the rnmor that the Govern
ment meditated placing another squadron
in commission. Nevertheless it could not
afford to rest on its oars. It did not pro
pose to adopt sensational measures, but
would continue as hitherto to steadily
augment the number of ships, guns ana
men in order to maintain supremacy on
the sea and to secure ihe nation from
panic whenever there were clouds on the
political horizon.
The announcement is made that the re
view of the flying squadron by the Queen
has been postponed until Wednesday.

LONDON, Exc, Jan. 21.â The Times
to-morrow will give unusually promi
nence to a Washington dispatch
sent to it by its correspondent,
Mr. Smalley, asserting that he
has personal knowledge of the existence in
the White House and the State Depart
ment of a strong and cordial wish for an
early and complete settlement of the dis
pute with Great Britain on terms that will
involve no discredit to either Government
and also the existence of the belief that
such a settlement may be speedily reached.
Mr. Smalley adds that good advice has
already been given to Venezuela and may
be given more effectively.
The Times, commenting on the forego
ing and Mr. Smalley's assertion that there
had been a sudden change in the spirit of
the Senate, will express its pleasure at the
cheering news. The absence of a desire to
hasten Senator Davis' resolution, it says,
Will allow time fur the forces that are work
ing for peace to operate.
The paper notes the conciliatory and
modest language of Justice Brewer's let
ter to Secretary Olney, but says it must be
obvious to the Americans themselves that
the origin of the Venezuelan Commission
and the manner in which its creation is
regarded in the United States make it al
together Impossible for Great Britain to
recognize its doings either directly or indi
rectly.
Lord Salisbury's original objection to ar
bitrate concerning districts settled years
ago by British subjects and under British
law still holds good, but the American
Government must be well aware of the
perfect willingness on this side to
discard the Schom burg line and arbitrate
on all the disputed \ territory, exclud

zuelans have permanently settled. * This

and advocates the immediate call of a

The Temps' Harsh Criticism of Davis'
Resolution,
PARIS, France, Jan. 21.â The Temps.
in an article on the Anglo-American dis
pute, asks whether Senator Davis imagines
that Europe will accept without protest
the extravagant innovation contained in
his resolution anent the Monroe doctrine,
or if the States of Central and South Amer
ica will submit to slavery without protest

regret that he helped to create the frame
of mind in which the resolution originated.

LONDON, Eng., Jan. 21.â The Chronicle

reasonable and fair request. The commis
sion, it will add, has done its best to set
aside the peremptory character that Presi

to it. That is a point of which a sensible

The London Globe Object* to the Comtnia-

LONDON. E.vg., Jan. 21.â The Globe this
afternoon comments angrily on the letter
of the United States Venczeuelan Commis
sion, suggesting that Great Britain and
Venezuela be invited to submit to the
commission all of the evidence in their
possession. The Globe says:
"Great Britain will never allow this
monstrous claim to determine the territory
of a British colon}' within its jurisdiction.
No power could admii it except at the close
of a long and disastrous war. Were such
a demand made by any other power, our
only reply would be to hand its Enibassa
dor his passports and mobilize the fleet.
Will these pernicious commissioners un
dertake to answer for the effect upon their
own countrymen of forcing the Premier
to snub the American Secretary of State."
DISPLAYED STATESMANSHIP.
The Request of the Venezuela Commission
Is Approved.
LONDON, Exg., Jan. 21.â The Daily
News will to-morrow say, in connection
with the letter of the Venezuela Commis
sion requesting Secretary Olney to ask
Great Britain and Venezuela to lay before
the commission their sides of the boundary
dispute, that Justice Brewer displayed
genuine statesmanship in drafting the
letter. It adds that the request furnishes
Lord Salisbury an opportunity that ought
not to be lost. The Prime Minister would
act with wisdom and dignity if h.e com
plied with the request.
MOfF FOR LAXD FORCES.
Important Chanties to Be Made in the
British Army.
LONDON, Eng., Jan. 21.â The Pall Mall
Gazette says that the Cabinet will imme
diately consider the matter of making im
portant changes in the British military
equipment.
The mystery of the flying squadron still
continues unsolved. No one knows what
its destination is, or if it have any destina
tion. In fact there is a growing suspicion
that thf squadron was organized more as
a warning to the world at large than for
any otner purpose, and was intended to
show how ready England was either to
protect herself or to attack any other power
with which she might have trouble.
The only thing that seems definitely
settled in the whole thing is that the fleet
is now going to the American coast. This
is stated positively by officials who are in
position to know what they are talking
a bo at.

ROME, Italy, Jan. 21.â The Osserva

oliicially denies the statement contained
in a dispatch recently published by the
London Chronicle that the Pope, through
Cardinal Satolli, had made a semi-official
offer to President Cleveland to act as ar
bitrator in the dispute between the United
States and Great Britain. It also denies
that his Holiness offered to act as arbitra
tor in the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute in
1895, and that his offer was refused by
Great Britain.

Prime Minister of this colony, saiJ that
New Zealand was specially interested in
the Venezuelan and Transvaal disputes
owing to the American and German in
terests in Samoa. The colony, he added
was thoroughly British, and the practical
way to strengthen the home Government
was to be in a position to defend the
colony's rights and to prepare for the

PHILADELPHIA, Pa.. Jan. 21.â L. W.
Adams, a mining engineer from the dis
puted Venezuelan territory, arrived in this
city to-day on the British steamship
Schihallin, from Demerara.
He has been working in the Venezuelan
gold fields as the representative of the
New York and Guiana Gold Syndicate
Company. When he left the Orinoco
River everything was quiet, but the miners
were still at work in the disputed territory,
the gold having been discovered to be
richer as the rivers trace towards the Bra
zilian border line.
There was but little excitement at the
actual scene of the trouble, but at Caracas,
La Guayra and other cities in Venezuela
excitement against the English ran high.
At St. Lucia, the Britis-h coaling sta

This is the nearest station to Venezuela
and the only place where, in the event of
war, coal could be procured to supply the
British warships. Mr. Adams states that
hundreds of gold miners have recently
arrived at the gold fields from the Un ited
States.

HIS LAST RESOURCE.
LIVES LOST IN
RAGING FLAMES
Three Men Sacrificed by a
Dangerous Experiment
With Gas.
TWO EXPLOSIONS ENSUE.
One Workman Killed Instantly
and Two Subsequently
Perish in the Fire.
MUCH PROPERTY DESTROYED.
Insurance Companies Will Refuse to
Pay the Policies Because of
Irregularities.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Jan. 21.â The
building on Crown street, opposite Orange,
occupied by English & Mersick and two
other firms, was destroyed by fire this
â¢nomine, which started from an explo
sion. Three lives were lost.
The killed : Joseph C. Hauser, machin
ist, aged 38; J. T. Toof, aged 40; Harbona
Stevens, aged 21.
About 10:30 o'clock- this morning Frank
P. Phlegar Sr., a machine jobber, was ex
perimenting with acetylene gas in his shop
on the second floor of the building.
Around him were a corps of assistants,
and it is said that Phlegar was working
upon some sort of regulator to control the
delivery of the gas from steel cylinders in
which it is kept under high pressure,
sometimes as high as 2000 pounds to the
square inch. Definite knowledge as to the
conditions of the experiment cannot be
had, since the Phlepars positively refuse
to talk to-night, beyond acknowledging
the experiment.
It is known that when the explosion
occurred the Phlegars, father and son, and
five men were working about a cylinder of
the gas. One of the men, Joseph Hauser,
a toolmaker, was killed by the explosion.
His right leg was torn off at the ankle and
the left leg horribly twisted. Charles Fox,
an engineer, himself cut and bleeding,
carried Hauser's body out of the building,
which was then rapidly being enveloped
in flames. Frank Pblegar Sr. was burne^
anH cut.
The force of the explosion tore down the
ceiling, and when the department came
ana before water was put on the fire which
resulted, a second explosion was heard.
This was doiibtless caused by a small tube
of the gas.
When the explosion occurred, there were
fifty persons in the building, and a mad
rush to escape occurred. Happily all of
the employes escaped except the three
mentioned. It is said that Toof and
Stevens, both employed by E. J. Toof, re
mained bebind to lock a safe and secure
some valuable papers.
Soon after the fire broke out Stevens was
seen at the window and was told to wait
a moment and a ladder would be sent up.
He answered that he would get some
things from his desk and throwing out
some books went away from the window.
He was not seen again.
How Toof met his fate is not known, but
he was found very near Steven's body.
It was not until 2:30 o'clock, three hours
after the tire was under control, that the
bodies of Toof and Stevens were found by
the liremen., wiio were tUeo clearing a.wuy
the debris. Both bodies were burned
beyond recognition and were identified
only by means of peculiarities of clothing
or by papers in the pockets.
The losses and insurance are as follows :
English & Mersick, carriages and hard
ware, first floorâ Loss, $50,000; insjuance,
$58,000. Frank P. Phle^er, jobbing ma
chinist, second floorâ Loss, $30,000; insur
ance, $_', r >,000; Kdwin J. Toof, sewing ma
chine attachments, third floorâ Loss, $10,
--000; insurance, $30,600.
The buiiding was valued at $15,000, and
is insured for that sum. It is altogether
within the bounds of possibility that all of
the insurance policies may be subject to
contest, and, indeed, may be invalidated.
It seems that the insurance companies re
gard acetylene gas and the materials which
enter into its manufacture in the same
light as (hey do gasoline, and do not per
mit the gas to be made or used in any in
sured building without a special permit.
The insurance agents who placed the poli
cies on the burned buildine said to-night
that no such permits had been issued by
them.
Hauser and Toof were married and
leave families.
SALVAGE MEX IN THE 2t UIXS.
Four Lives Lost During a Big Fire in St.
Loui*.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 21.â At 10 o'clock
to-night fire destroyed the five-story
building at 415 North Broadway, occupied
by A. S. Aloe & Co., opticians. The rear
of the building abuts on a ten-foot alley,
and through this alley runs a mass of elec
tric wires, which rendered the work of the
firemen difficult and hazardous. Three
men were shocked into insensibility by
contact with wires, and Foreman Hynes
of an engine company fell from a ladder
and was seriously injured. Twenty-two
streams of water were poured ineffectively
upon the blaze.
While the salvage corps was covering
showcases on the second floor the floor
collapsed and went to the basement. Four
of the salvage men are in the ruins, and
there is no hope of rescuing them. They
are in the center of the building, covered
with wreckage and heavy packing cases.
Cries for help grew fainter as time passed,
and at J.l o'clock they had ceased. Their
names are: Reine Miller, James Roddy,
John Glenville and Harry Kirley.
While the firemen were working to save
their unfortunate comrades the fire took a
new start, and the rescue was for the time
abandoned. The stock was the most com
plete of its character in the West, and the
loss will be fully $200,000. Insurance is
ample. Adjoining business houses suf
fered considerably from water and smoke.
B. Aloe, a member of the tirm, was mar
ried this evening in Philadelphia.
GENERAL EWING'S DEATH.
Failed to Recover From the In
juries Inflicted by a
Cable-Car.
He Made a Gallant Career as a Jurist,
a Soldier and a States
man.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.-General
Thomas E. Ewing, who was injured yes
terday by a cable-car, died this morning.
It was thought that the general was not
badly hurt and a speedy recovery was
looked for. Bad symptoms set in, how
ever, at a late hour last night, and General
Ewing gradually sank into unconscious
ness, dying this morning.
The direct cause of death was the forma
tion of a blood clot on the brain, caused by
a fracture of the skull.?. During the night
his physicians commenced an operation
with the hope of < removing the blood clot,
but -found after they had made a few in
cisions that further work in that direction 1
was dangerous. ' General was in an
unconscious state froÂ» too time be was
struck by the cable-car until his death.
His vitality wrs in such a depressed state
that his physicians deemed it wise not to
complete the operation unless the patient's
condition improved. General Ewing sank
rapidly after 3 o'clock in the morning.
The police on being informed of General
Ewing's death said that John Kelly, the
gripman of the car which struck General
Ewmg, would be rearrested on the charge
of homicide. He was arraigned in the
Yorkville Police Court yesterday and pa
roled.
General Ewing was born in Lancaster,
Ohio, in 1820. He was President Taylor's
private secretary in 1849 and 1850, studied
law, became Chief Justice of Kansas, and
was holding that office when the Civil
War broke out. He left the bench, re
cruited a Kansas regiment and became its
colonel, serving with such distinction that
he became a brevet major-general. After
the war he did good work in Congress. He
declined renomination and settled in New
York, where he practiced law.
FORGED PROMISSORY NOTES.
Arrest of the Manager of a Lumber Com-
pan/ Who Played a Huge Game
of Fraud,
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Jan. 21.â
Charles Aulteneperger, general manager
of tLe Seyfert & Wise Lumber Company's
branch at Minden, lowa, was arrested this
evening on a oharge of forgery.
From the facts disclosed Aultensperger
is alleged to have played a game of fraud
on a gigantic scale. Aultensperger's plan
seems to have been to put into his pocKet
all the cash he received from the farmers
and then forge their names to promissory
notes.
These notes he would send to the home
office. When due they would be returned
to. him for collection and if hard pressed
he would dig up part of the money and
forge a new note for the balance. His
forgeries are said to approximate nearly
$10,000 and his victims to number about all
the wealthy farmers for miles around Min
den.

ANTONIO EZETA'S CRUISES
Munitions of War on the Barclay
Golden Narrowly Escape
Seizure.
The Campaign Against Salvador Has
Ended in the Usual
Fizzle
PANAMA, Colombia, Jan. 21.â The Star
and Herald says: The vessel Barclay
Golden, which arrived here yesterday hav
ing on board General Antonio Ezeta and a
number of others who are alleged to be
filibusters agninst Salvador, is supposed to
have on board a quantity of arms. It was
the intention of the authorities here to
seize them, but Mr. Vifquain, the Amer
ican Consul, found that the Barclay
Golden's papers were in proper shape and
he protested to the Governor against the
seizure of anything on board of her. The
result of his protest was that the Governor
promised not to seize the arms.
The Barclay Golden is a vessel of only
250 tons burden, with a crew of eight men.
She had on board ten passengers, includ
ing Generals Antonio Ezeta, Casin and
Villatoro. The master of the vessel, Cap
tain Hansen, and the crew made affidavits
before Consul Vifquain that the vessel was
chartered at San Francisco for legitimate
business by General Casin.
When she arrived at Acapnlco, General
Ezeta and the other passengers boarded
her. Soon after it was discovered that the
passengers' baggace contained munitions
of war. The captain was compelled to
â top at San Salvador, and some of the
party landed. They soon afterward re
turned and fired shots at people on shore.
Ezeta's men having been guilty of
mutiny the United States warship Alert
will prevent them from having anything
further to do with the vessel.
The object of the Colombian Govern
ment in desiring to seize the arms and
ammunition on board the vessel was to
prevent the Liberals here from getting
possession of the war material, as it was
feared they might do.

May Reopen the Dispute Over
the Falklands.
WASHINGTON, D. C. ; Jan. 21.-The
cable announcement that Lord Salisbury's
note presented to the Government ai Rio
de Janeiro demanded that Brazil should
accept arbitration to decide the ownership
of the island of Trinidad before February
12, in default of which the island should
be considered as belonging to Great Britain
without further appeal, has caused serious
comment here, which has not been dimin
ished by the further statement that Brazil*
had definitely refused the proposal andi
had demanded that (treat Britain should <
immediately restore the island to Brazilian '
control; nor has the situation been ren
dered less acute by the intelligence con
veyed in a United Press cablegram from
Buenos Ayres announcing that the Argen
tine Government had canceled the English
cable company's concession and had
made common cause with Brazil. In oiri
ciaJ circles deep significance is attached to
the concerted action of the two largest
South American republics in directly an
tagonizing British claims to American
possessions.
Minister Mendonca of Brazil spent half
an hour by special appointment with Sec
retary Olney at the State Department this
afternoon, and it is suspected that the in
terview related to the decisive stand Brazil
had taken in regard to Lord Salisbury's
note. The Brazilian view of the matter is
that to expect them toarbitiate the owner
ship of Trinidad would be as unreasonable
as to ask the United States to arbitrate
the possession of Block Island if England
should suddenly occupy it on the ground
that the United States had not hitherto
made a good use of it ; or, as another ex
ample, that the United States would
tamely submit to England's establishing a
colony on an uninhabited Florida key un
der the British flag because it was a desira
ble cable station and fit for nothing else.
A naval officer who is intrusted with the
duty of keeping account of the submarine
cables of the world explained the Buenos
Ayres dispatches to-day as follows:
"An English company holds an exclusive
concession for coastwise cables in Brazil,
the concession having about twenty more
years to run. Sir John Pender, the cable
king, Beveral years ago determined to se
cure telegraphic communication between
his great system and the Pacific coast of
South America, which is a lucrative field
for teiegraphic enterprises. To that ena
he entered into negotiations with all the
South American countries for concessions,
being successful in almost every country
except Brazil, where he was antagonized
by the English company, which, under ita
exclusive right, operates all the lines from
the Amazon to the Rio Plata. He asked
Brazil for the use of the island of Trini
dad as an intermediate station, but the
English company in Brazil opposed this
and defeated it through the very fact that
Trinidad was Brazilian territory and there
fore part of its own absolute concession. Sir
John Pender went ahead, however, with
his negotiations with other countries until
a sufficient time had elapsed for an Eng
lish warship to go secretly to Trinidad and
land there a number of Sir John Pender'3
employe!*. The English flag was raised,
the cable company's operatives were left
in possession and the warship steamed
away again. The only inhabitants of
Trinidad to-day are Sir John Pender's
men taken there by the British Govern
ment.
"The concession secured from the Ar
gentine Government, which was especially
favorable to that country, provided for the
construction of a cable connecting with,
the company's main line on the African
coast and proceedine thence to Trinidad,
tne new port of La Plata, the Falkland
Islands, and so on around to Chile, the
Argentine Government giving the right
for the landing at La Plata.
'â¢It is learned from a member of the
diplomatic corps, who has the confidence of
South American representatives, that Ar
gentina's action in canceling the conces
sion is due to President Cleveland's special
Monroe doctrine message, and is inspired
by the hope that the United States wlh
recognize the right of Argentina to the
Falkland Islands, which were forcibly
taken by Great Britain with the acquies
ence of the United States subsequent to
the Monroe doctrine's enunciation. The
islands were owned and settled by Spain,
and thus became part of the Buenos Ayrea
Republic.
"Argentina vigorously protested when
they were seized by England, and in a
proclamation declared that, though Ar
gentina was unable to resist the powerful
force of England, it continued to firmly ad
here to its claim to tb*Â» lightful ownership
of the territory. Under these circum
stances Argentina, on the 15th inst., in
formed the cable company that it consid
ered the proposed landing place at Trin
idad as illegal, and that it could not
recognize any alleged permit to use the
Falkland Islands. Consequently, by its own
terms, the concession fell to tne ground.
"It is intimated that a specially accred
ited Minister from Buenos Ayres will soon
come to the United States to endeavor to
reopen the dispute as to the ownership of
the Falkland Islands in view of the stand
taken by President Cleveland on the Vene
zuelan boundary dispute. President Cleve
land Ui aw ' tot annual iji^sps^ }?,Â£?Â£*2
cress in ISBS, referring to this question,
6aid:
" 'The Argentine Government has re
vived the long dormant question of the
Falkland Islands by claiming from the
V-iited States indemnity for their loss, at
tributed to the action of the commander of
the sloop-of-xvar Lexington in breaking up
a practical colony on these islands in 1831
and their subsequent occupation by Great
Britain. In view of the ample justification
of the act of the Lexington and the dere
lict condition of the islands before and
after their alleged occupation by Argen
tine colonists, this Government considers
the claim as wholly groundless.'
"Friends of the Argentine Government,
however, claim that tnis referred wholly
to claim.- which the Argentine authorities
were then proxfing against this country,
and as the; have now been definitely aban
doned, for amicable reasons, they believe
the United States will not disregard the
prtx fa of ownership which can now be pre
sented, as they are similar in all respects
to tho^' o| Brazil am! Venezuela which
have been espoused by Secretary Olney."

CONSPIRACY OF LA MAFIA
Assassins" Are Banded for the
Commission of Various
Crimes.
Secret Service Agents Believe That
They Will Flood the Country With
Counterfeit Money.
NEW YORK.N. V., Jan. 21.â The Re
corder says this morning: The secret ser
vice authorities, of which Chief Hazen is
the head, recently received information
from a trustworthy source that the Mafia â
that ter-ibie secret society of assassins â
has perfected its organization in this
country in a stronger manner than ever
before, and has planned a gigantic scheme
oi crime. The fresn impetus to the Mafia
is the result of the recent discharge from
ral prisons where Federal prisoners
are confined of â  a number of desperate
murderers and leaders of counterfeiting
gangs, who have just finished long terms
of imprisonment.
Although the police in this country have
Bteadiiy denied that thÂ« Mafia has obtained
a foothold here, the secret service operators
have baen .convinced by the most positive
evidence- that tue society is in a most
flourishing condition and is prepared to
tarry oat its schemes of crime upon a
stupendous scale.
The evidence collected by the secret ser
vice men shows that the Mafia has its
a^eiUs in every locality where Italians
eoncregate, and has very strong and active
organizations in this city, Chicago, New
Orleans, Boston, St. Louis, San Francisco,
Buffalo, Toledo, St. Paul. Kansas City.
Pitts burg, Charleston and other large
cities in the East and "West.
The new scheme of the Mafia is in the
counterfeiting line, and the plan involves
a simultaneous movement in all parts of
the country. A large amount of spurious
coin and bank notes are to be put out at
the same time, in order to flood the coun
try before any report is made to the Fede
ral authorities of the existence of the
spurious money.
The Mafia's plans are disseminated by
messengers, who know full welj that death
awaits them if they are discovered or give
any information about their business. The
records of the secret service show that
nearly all the counterfeiting done m this
country is the work of the Mafia. The
secret service agents are baffled in their in
vestigation of the Mafia's worn by the
scarcity of informers among them. The
man who turns informer condemns him
self to death, and the murder will be done
in a way which will prevent detection.
The secret service agents, though handi
capped, are doing a splendid work by get
ting at the bottom of facts in this stupend
ous conspiracy ot the Maria, and they con
fidently expect to block the game and
arrest at least a few of the leaders in the
scheme.
CRIMES OF THE TURK.
Reliable Reports of Nearly I.tMOO JT/ur

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â The Inde
pendent of January 23 will say: State
ments in regard to the massacres in East
ern Turkey have come to us from a
perfectly reliable source, showing that in
a sm^'.l portion of the empire in the
vicinity ra llarpoot and Diarbekir there
were within one month, commencing with
the latter part of October last, over 5000
houses destroyed and nearly 13,000 Ar
menians butchered in a hundred or more
villages in that district.
The details of the atrocities committed
by the Turks and Kurds are sickening and
are simply a re7>etitioii of those reported
from otner parts of Armenia.

Protection Demanded for the
Industries of This
Country.
CAUSES OF STAGNATION.
Tinkering With the Tariff and
Disturbance in the Mone
tary System.
TWO IMPORTANT CONVENTIONS.
Men Who Employ Thousands Meet at
Chicago and Talk of Needed
Legislation.
CHICAGO, Ilk, Jan. 21.â Approval of
the measure of legislation popularly
known as the "McKinley bili." denuncia
tion of* that designated as the "Wilson
bill" and a demand for prompt action by
the National Legielature to the end that
the present industrial depression might
give way to a season of prosperity, were
the keynotes of two important conven
tions of representatives of commercial
and manufacturing interests that opened
in this city to-day.
One, the second annual convention of
the National Association of Manufacturers,
was held at Central Music Hall ; the other,
a general convention of textile manufac
turers, called by the association of the West
and South, assembled at the Palmer
House. At both the addresses w&re
pitched in the same key. The tariff re
form law of the last Congress was held to
be responsible for the prostration of home
industries and the disturbance to the
monetary system, repeated changes in
legislation affecting manufacturing inter
ests were forcibly deprecated, and a halt
was called upon what was characterized
as li the persistent efforts of politicians" to
disturb and harass the trade and industry
of the country. The proceeding of both
conventions will be resumed to-morrow.
"What the meeting of the National Asso
ciation Jacked in numbers was more than
made up by the earnestness and enthu
siasm Jhat were manifested. Those present
represented nearly every State in the
Union and industries wide and diversified.
Samuel Allerton, the millionaire packer
and mammoth farmer, sat side by side
with Hon. Warner Miller of New York,
and Senor Gregorio E. Gonzales, special
envoy from the Government of Mexico,
Charles Heber Clark of Philadelphia, and
Thomas McDougall of Cincinnati were
seated on the platform. M. E. Ingalls of
Ohio, president of the "Big Four," was
represented for the session by a proxy,
and special representatives of George M.
Pullman, P. D. Armour, the Peering Com
pany and the American Book Company
answered to their names.
Altogether President Thomas Dolan of
Philadelphia confronted an audience rep
resenting many billions of invested capi
tal and giving employment of scores of
thousands of wageworkers when he arose
to deliver the annual address. He was at
tentively listened to and frequently ap
plauded as he told of the progress of the
new organization and its brilliant pros
pects for the future.
After the report of the treasurer, show
ing receipts during the year from all
sources of $20,000 and expenditures in the
promotion of American trade of $11,000,
had been presented, the various commit
tees were announced. This concluded the
general business of the session and Thomas
McDougall of Cincinnati, one of the found
ers of the organization, closed the day's
proceedings with an energetic speech,
which provoked t tumultuous applause.
A mention in a personal reference to the
name of William McKinley brought out a
storm of cheers, twice renewed, and re
peated when he denounced the meddling
with the McKinley act as the crime of the
century. Concluding, he said:
"We need statesmen. What should we
think of a government which is constantly
running in debt when it has unbounded
resources to produce a revenue beyond its
expenditures? Nothing but the potent
voice of the united manufacturing indus
tries of the country will be able to say to
these so-called statesmen: 'We want ac
tion ; we want such legislation as will ena
ble us to secure a permanent home market
against foreign pauper labor.' "
A resolution of sympathy with the
Cuban patriots, and one introduced by
Charles Keber Clark of Philadelphia call
ing for an immediate investigation of the
printed statements that Oriental manu
factures were being imported in large
quantities, and recommending action
against this new menace to American in
dustries, were read and referred, and the
convention adjourned.
THE TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS.
Delegates From, Many States Attend
Their Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 21.â Fifty dele
gates from Western and Southern States
were present at the convention of Textile
Manufacturers, and which was presided
over by George S. Bowen of Elgin, 111.
Extracts from letters from 200 manufact
uring firms in Georgia, Louisiana, North
Carolina, Mississippi, South Carolina,
Alabama, Kentucky, California, Oregon,
Ohio, Indiana and Michigan were read.
Nearly all contained bitter criticisms of
the last Congress, deplored the present
stagnation, and urged the re-enactment of
the McKinley bill.
President Bo wen, in his address, said
textile interests were confronting a con
tinual decrease in prices, and that manu
facturers were afraid to buy raw material,
because after making it up they could not
sell the finished product except at a loss.
C. H. Mason of Illinois, chairman of
the committee on resolutions, said that
the country waa approaching a great crisis
in its industrial development and needs,
and that it was plain to have prosperity
we must have a return to protective duties.
It had become so much a question of self
preservation with the Asiatics now invad
ing this market that not only protection
but prohibition would be necessary, just
as the Chinese were shut out, because they
wiere not adapted to our civilization.
[Cheers.]
A lengthy report from the committee on
resolutions was then adopted. The salient
paragraphs read :
Resolved, That we denounce British free
trade as a scheme to protect British manufac
turers iv our own market against the com

petition of our own manufacturers; as a
scheme to enable British capital and labor to
deprive American capital and labor of the just
protection of our laws; as a scheme to dupe us
into producing articles which contain much
material and little work, ana generally as a
scheme to make England the workshop of the
world.
Resolved, That we favor the policy of tariff
protection because it multiplies the establish
ments which give employment to labor and
capital at home.
Resolved, That it should he the policy of
Congress in framing the free list to adopt the
reciprocity principle, bo that those countries
which will opeu their markets to the entrance
of our manufactures shall alone be privileged
to free admission of specific articles of their
own growth into our markets, as was done
under the authority of the MeKinley tariff.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â The
Post this morning says, upon Senator
White's authority, that Associate Justice
Field will soon retire, but hones to be al
lowed to name his own successor, and
that, if so, he will name Judge Ross of the
United States Circuit Court for the South
ern circuit of California. Senator White
said to The Cali- coresspondent to-day:
I; I donM: know why such a statement
coming from me should be printed in the
Post. I certainly gave out no such in
formation. All I know about Justice
Field's intentions is what 1 have seen in
newspapers from time to time for several
years. It is true that I am friendly to
Judge Ross and naturally assume that
others are, but I know nothing about Jus
tice Field wanting Ross to succeed him,
though I must say Ross would be an ex
cellent man for the place."
Justice Field said to a friend last night,
"I am ready to retire at any time if I am
allowed to name my successor," but to
day Field gave out a statement to the
effect that the Post's story had no founda
tion in fact.
Or INTEREST TO TJBj: COAST.
Plant to Build a Hand From Sausalito
to Point Honita.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 21.â Acting
chief of engineers of the War Department
Mackenzie has written Senator Perkins
concerning the construction of a road from
Sausalito through the Lime Point military
reservation to Point Bonita. Mackenzie
states that the construction of a good road
would be of advantage to the Government,
but that a poor one would not. The good
road, he says, cannot be built for |2250.
He, therefore, recommends that Congress
be asked to make an appropriation for the
construction of the road, or that the Sec
retary of War be authorized to use the
proceeds of a lease for the purpose of the
road construction and maintenance. In
these recommendations Secretary Lamont
concurs, and Senator Perkins and Con
gressman Barham will endeavor to secure
the necessary appropriation from Con
gress.
The Senate to-day passed a bill restoring
John Clyde Sullivan as paymaster in the
United States navy. Paymaster Sullivan

mitted to practice in the United States
Supreme Court, on motion of Mr. Maguire.
The Senate passed a bill appropriating
25 per cent of the proceeds of the sales of
mineral lands to the establishment of
schools of mines in California and other
mineral-producing States. The bill will
go through the House.
The resolution granting certain war ma

Order.

Demanded.
THE CUBAN QUESTION TOUCHED.
Two Resolutions Relating to Arrest of
Citizens and the Progress of
the War.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â The
House of Representatives to-day passed
its third appropriation bill â that provid
ing for urgent deficiencies for the current
and past fiscal years, reported yesterday.
The total amount carried t>y the bill as
prepared by the Committee on Appropri
ations was $4,415,923 and as passed by the
House $4,420,403, the only amendment
made of any importance being one to ap
propriate $5000 for the survey of the Chico
pee lands in Wisconsin. Nearly three
quarters of the amount named in the bill
was for court expenses, largely fees of wit
nesses, deputy Marshals and commission
ers, and much of the debate on tlie bill was
devoted to the necessity of reform in the
system which now prevails.
Early in the day a joint resolution pro
viding for an increase of twenty in the
number of reports and documents fur
nished the State Department gave rise to
a discussion of the printing bill passed at
the last session of Congress. It was criti
cised by Cannon (R.) of Illinois and de
fended by Richardson (D.)of Tennessee,
who managed its passage through the
House.
Resolutions were agreed to calling UDon
the Secretary of the Treasury to inform
the House whether or not, in his opinion,
the provisions of the law ior the safety of
the public in ocean travel were sufficient,
and if so, whether not they were beine en
forced ; and for a statement of the reasons
for the delay in the construction of the
San Francisco Postoffice building.
A bill was passed affirming and legaliz
ing the issue of|certain bonds authorized by
the Legislature of New Mexico for public
buildings.
In his opening piayer Chaplain Couden
invokea the blessing of God upon Miss
Barton, president of the Red Cross Society,
and her party in their trip to Turkey.
Castron (R.) of New Mexico, from the
Committee on Territories, reported a bill
to affirm various acts passed by the Legis
ture of New Mexico and it was passed.
A resolution of inquiry reported from
the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds by Hilborn (R.) of California was
agreed to, calling upon the Secretary of
the Treasury for the reasons for the delay
in the construction of the San Francisco
Postofhce building.
Crisp (D.) of Georgia asked what had be
come of the unfinished business â the re
port of the Committee on Rules.
Speaker Reed stated that all the pro
posed amendments save ore had been
agreed to and were in force.
Crisp said that the report as a whole
had not been disposed of, and yet those
officials were enforcing the changes recom
mended by tbe committee. It was not
proper to proceed in that manner, he said.
He had intended at the proper time to
offer a substitute for the whole code of
rules.
Dalzell (R.) of Pennsylvania stated that
it was the intention of the Committee on
Rules to hold a meeting shortly and when
the committee made its report the gentle
man from Georgia (Crisp) would have an
opportunity to offer his proposed substi
tute.
The House then, on motion of Cannon
(R.) of Illinois, went into committee of the
whole to consider the urgent deficiency
bill. A brief general debate ensued upon
the subject of the fee system of paying
officials of the United States courts and
the necessity for its reformation if not
abolishment, in which Cannon, Sayers
(D.) of Texas, Henderson (R.) of lowa,
Xorthway (R.) of Ohio, Swanson (D.)of
Virginia and Daniels (R.) of New York
participated.
Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas sought to
amend the paragraph making an appro
priation to pay the salaries of court officials
in Indian Territory by specially designat
ing L. L. Stowe, a marshal, and J. B.
Walker, an attorney, one of whom died
and the other resigned after a few months'
service without having been confirmed by
the Senate. The amendment was offered
to meet the ruling of Comptroller Bowler
that he cannot pass salary accounts of
officers not so confirmed. After a brief
discussion, in which the Comptroller's
policy was made the subject of some criti
cism, the amendment was adopted.
Lacey (R.) of lowa discussed the neces
sity for a reform of the fee system in
Federal courts, presenting some striking
figures. The consideration of the bill
having been concluded, several unimport
ant amendments being added, the com
mittee arose and the bill as amended was
passed.
At 4:15 o'clock the House adjourned
until to-morrow.
SESBIOS OF THE SEXA.TE.
Sixty- Five Sills on the Calendar Are Hit-
posed Of.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â Neither
the financial question nor the Monroe doc
trine engaged any part of the time of the
Senate to-day. When at the close of the
morning hour the House bond bill with
the free-coinage substitute came up as the
unfinished business Teller (R.) of Colo
rado, who had the floor to speak upon it,
readily consented to a suggestion to post
pone his speech till to-morrow, and Jones
(D.) of Arkansas, who haÃ the parliamen
tary management of the bill, just as read
ily consented to have ihe bill go over for
the day.
The Cuban question, however, came in
for a measure of attention indirectly in
connection with two resolutions offered by
Call (D.) of Florida, one in reference to
the arrest of United States citizens in
Havana and the other calling on the State
Department for copies of reports of
United States consuls in Cuba relating to
the progress of the war on that island.
Both resolutions were referred to the Com
mittee of Foreign Relations after a brief
discussion in which Hoar(R.) of Massa
chusetts ridiculed the nation that the
Senate was a "constantly loaded cannon,"
ready to be "touched off" at any Senator's
direction, and then Sherman (R.) of Ohio,
chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, remarked that the resolution
would be setting an example that might
give the Government a great deal of
trouble.
Most of the day's session was gnent in
disposing of bills on the calendar that
were unobjected to. Some sixty-five meas
ures were passedâ a majority of them
private pension bills.
In the routine business of the morning
hour a "service pension bill" was re
ported to the Senate from the Committee
on Pensions without any recommenda
tion and wa3 placed on the calendar.
A resolution was offered by Call (D.) of
Florida, requesting the President of the
United States to inquire into the arrest
and forcible removal of Mark O. Rodriguez,
a citizen of the United States on board of
the United States mail steamer Olivette, in
the harbor of Havana on the 15th inst.,
and also into the arrest of Louis S. Someil
lan and his son in Havana, and if no just
cause for such arrests exists that the
President shall demand their immediate
aelease. He subsequently modified the
resolution so as to make it one of inquiry
merely, at the suggestion of Hoar (R.) of
Massachusetts, and at the further sug
gestion of Sherman (R.) of Ohio it was re
ferred to the Committee ou Foreign Re
lations.
Call's resolution, calling on the State
Department for reports of Consuls in
Cuba on the war now existing there, was
taken from the Vice-President's table and
referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.
Push's resolutions, relating to the pay
ment of United States obligations in silver,
was then laid before the Senate, but it went
over.
A resolution to pay a year's salary to
the widow of the late Captain Bassett, the
assistant doorkeeper, was referred to the
Committee on Contingent Expenses.
The calendar was then taken up and
several unimportant Dills passed.
At the close of the morning hour the
bond bill was laid before the Senate as the
unfinished business, Teller (R.) of Colo
rado tawing the floor to address the Senate
upon it. At the suggestion of Hoar, how
ever, with the consent of Teller and of
Jones (D.) of Arkanas, in charge of the
bill, it went over for the day, and the
calendar was proceeded with.
Senate bills for bridges across the Co

UPHOLDS BOWLER'S ACT
Secretary Carlisle Says the Comp
troller Did Not Exceed His
Authority.
But the Judiciary Committee Will
Proceed With the Proposed
Investigation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.â The
Judiciary Committee to-day considered
the Boatner resolution which recites the
action of the Comptroller of the Treasury
in refusing to countersign the warrants in
payment of the money appropriated for
the sugar bounty, and after some discus
sion a substitute, prepared by Ray of New
York, was adopted. This gives the Judi
ciary Committee authority to inquire as to
the condition of the law on the subject of
the right of the executive officers of the
Government to refuse to enforce orcomply
with any provisions of any act of Congress
on the ground of its alleged unconstitu
tionally or for other reasons, and to re
port to the House by bill or otherwise.
Er.y to-day received a letter from Secre
tary Carlisle, under date of the 20th inst.,
in which he replies at iength to Ray's re
quest for information whether there is pre
cedent or authority on the part of the
Comptroller for declining to pay the
bounty.
The Secretary shows the care with which
the Comptroller investigated the subject
and the conclusion reached by him that
the constitutionality of the appropriation
was at least doubtful, and that he deemed
it his duty without allowing or disallowing
the claim to have the question referred to
the Court of Claims for adjudication,
which the Secretary, after hearing written
and oral arguments upon the question,
agreed to.
Secretary Carlisle in conclusion shows
that the original Boatner resolution was
based upon certain statements contained
in the preamble which are erroneous.
"For," he continues, "the Comptroller has
not refused to perform a ministerial act or
execute a statute passed by Congress; nor
has he nullified or attempted to nullify
any act of Congress. On tne contrary, he
has proceeded under and in accordance
with the statutes of the United States,
wnich expressly authorized him to cause
claims of the class to which this one be
longs (the Oxnard Beet Sugar Company)
to be referred to the courts for adjudica
tion of the constitutional questions in
volved."
FAVORS THE CABLE.
The House Commerce Committee Considers
McCormieh's Sill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21. -The
House Commerce Committee to-day con
sidered the bill of McCormick of New
York for the construction of a Pacific cable.
The bill ia in charge of Bennett of New
York, who will see Secretary Olney with
relation to the effect upon his Govern
ment of landing the cable on the Marshall
Islands in the South Pacific, these islands
being owned by Germany.
The discussion in the committee devel
oped a sentiment favorable to the proposed
cable, provided the company shall see that
all the privileges desired by the United
States Government are granted.
In favor of Minor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.-The
House Committee on Eleetkms No. 2, John
son of Indiana chairman, to-day decided
the election case of Campbell against
Minor from the Seventh New York Dis
trict in favor of Minor, the sitting member.
The report was unanimous.
AN EXPLOSION
OF NATURAL GAS
One Man Killed and Four
Others Were Fatally
Injured.
DIED BEFORE HUNDREDS.
Spectators Horrified by the Ter
rible Fate of an Engi
neer.
BLOWN VERY HIGH IN THE AIR.
Gruesome Experience of Those in the
Vicinity of a Wrecked Pump
ing Station.
RED KEY, Ind., Jan. 21.â A terrific ex
plosion of natural gas at 7 o'clock to-night
shook the town from end to end, killed
one man and injured four, it is believed,
fatally.
The pumping station of the Ohio and
Indianapolis Gas Company is located on
the main street here, and a 12-inch main
leading to the building burst with awful
force. The pipes were buried &ix feet
underground, but the force of the explo
sion threw them about like cordwood and
rendered the street impassable.
The pipes were torn up as far as the
pumping station, and here the escaping
gas was ignited by the flame in the boiler
room. The station was completely wrecked
and two buildings adjoining destroyed.
Palmer Godwin, the engineer on duty,
was instantly killed and his body burned
to ashes before the eyes of a hundred hor
rified spectators, who were unable to reach
him.
Joseph Watkins, chief engineer of La
fayette, who was in another part of the
station, was fatally injured. Three other
men, whose names are not known, are
also believed to be beyond recovery. The
force of the explosion blew these men 150
feet from the station.
Immediately after the explosion the
debri3 took lire, and as the town boasts
but a small Fire Department the wreck was
destroyed.
The loss on the pumping-station alone is
$100,000, and that on the other buildings
about $10,000. There was great danger for
some time of the fire spreading, and the
citizens turned out and rendered all the
aid possible to the Fire Department. The
explosion was caused by a pressure of 300
pounds on the 12-inch main.
This is the center of the Ohio and Indi
ana gas-fielda, and tnis company supplies
nearly a hundred cities from this station.
They of course are shut off from their sup
ply of pas to-night, and considerable suf
fering will result, as the weatner is cold.
SARAH APPEARS XOUTHFVL.
Mme. Bernhardt I'lar/s in JVeur York
After a Lomj Absent*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â Sarah
Bernhardt appeared last ni?ht at Abbey's
Theater in "Izeyl," after an absence of
nearly five years from the American stage.
It was fif teeÂ« years ago that she acted here
fir3t, and those in the audience last niijht
that remembered her debut as Adnenne
Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater must have
found occasion for some rather optimistic
reflection as to the flight of time and its
proverbial ravages.
There was nothing about the perform
ance last night that was quite so striking
as the remarkably youthful appearance
of the French actress. Those in toe
audience who had seen her before were
amazed at the extent to which she
retains the appearance and illusion of
being a considerably younger woman
than they know her to be in reality; and
the yonnjier playgoers, whom she faced
for ttie first time, saw a woman who has
been famous for twenty years, and looks
as though she might dignifiedly con
tinue, so far as her personal charm goes,
to exploit her genius for years to come.
She is stouter, but none the less attractive
in her own way through the change, and
nothing of her sinuous grace has been lost.
Mme. Bernhardt acted as perfectly as
she has ever played any role, her genius
and technique never failing to make its
certain and sure effect. The few words
she spoke in the first act assured her hear
ers that her beautiful voice had lost none
of the charm for which it is noted. The
scenery and costumes were appropriately
beautiful, and her associates afforded her
a most capable support.

TRIBES IS INDIA*' TERRITORY
Dawes Will Recommend That Congress
Act Arbitrarily.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.-A Sun
special from Washington says: Ex-Senator
Dawes sayÂ» that the commission of which
he is chairman had abandoned all idea of
persuading the tribes in Indian Territory
to organize themselves into a Territorial
jrovernment, and would recommend that
Congress take arbitrary and heroic meas
ures to accomplish' that end.
"Tlie trouble is, " said Dawes, "that we
cannot get at the people. The govern
ment of all the Indian tribes is controlled
by a few men. The Seminoles are con
trolled by one man. Nothing they favor
can be defeated ; nothing they oppose can
be accomplished, and it is very profitable
and satisfactory to them to let tbiogs run
on indefinitely .as they are now. We have
recommended that Congress pass an act
dissolvine the tribal relations of the live
nations that occupy the Indian Territory
and provide a Territorial government like
that of other Territories, giving United
States courts jurisdiction over land ques
tions."

Republicans Preparing for the Conven-
t ion at Ht. Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Jan. 21.â The members
of the sub-committee of the Republican
National Committee, representative busi
ness men's league and Architects Taylor
of St. Louis and Adler of Chicago were
busily engaged to-day examining the
plans of the_ proposed convention hall in
the Exposition building.
The committee does not seem inclined
to accept the plans of the local architect,
and in accordance with the views of Mr.
Adler have suggested changes which if
carried out would involve an outlay of
Â£2">,000, and would interfere with the pur
pose for which the Exposition building
was erected.
As a compromise, President Kennard of
the Business Men's League has directed
Architect Taylor to draft plans for a wig
wam to be erected on Twelfth street, in
front of the new City Hall, and to be capa
ble of seating 20,000 persons.

The papal messenger. Bishop Shanley of
South Dakota, will arrive here next Tues
day. The Archbishop it is said will call a

that the event will not take place until

HONOLFLU, Hawaii, Jan. 15.â Late
news received from Hawaii by yesterday's
steamer shows that the eruption in xhe
crater of Kiiauea still continues. Man
ager Peter Lea of the Volcano House
telephoned to the purser of the steamer
Hall just prior to her departure for
Honolulu that the volume of lava in the
crater was still increasing and that it had
reached within 200 lect of the top of the
] it, which is the level of the Moor of the
main crater.
Lee expected that in less than a week,
if the rise continued, the lava would be
flowing into ihe main crater itself, which
is situated directly below the Volcano
House and is three miles in diameter and
â¢t deep. When this happens the
view from the verandas of the hotel at
â  is simply magnificent ana awe
inspiring.
Hundreds of people have already gonn
to the volcano from Hilo and other places
on Hawaii, and every steamer from Hono
lulu is crowded with sightseers. The Ala
nieda is expected to bring a lot of tourists
to-morrow, and they will certainly be in
big luck. A big excursion is being planned
to leave hers next week, and among the

I>r. Bowie, late of the Belgic and now a

charge that any case at all resembling
cholera occurred on the Belgic last Aue
ust. President Smith of the Board of
Health states on the contrary that they
have the strongest evidence that such
fatal cases did occur on that ship; also
that a Chinese passenger, while being
taken from the Belgic to the quarantine
on a scow, contaminated the harbor water,
dying the next day, his attendant dying
soon after, before any alarm of cholera
was given. A week later cholera began on
tne shore adjacent.
A strong movement is in progress for
the coming season of the Legislature to
license the importation of opium and its
pale to Chinese only. Many honorable
men favor this for the reason that the
present illicit importation and traffic ex
erts a very corrupting influence upon
officers of the police and customs. The
President and Cabinet believe that any
legalizing of the traffic must increase the
consumption.

BESIEGED BY IDLE MEN
Lively Experience at the Chicago
and Grand Trunk Rail-
way Station.
Those Who Could Not Secure Employ
ment Threw Bricks, Hissed
and Howled.
CHICAGO. 111.. Jan. 21.â Several hun
dred tramps besieged the Chicago and
Grand Trunk railway station at Forty
nir.th and Halstead streets yesterday.
They had concreeated in the expectation
of being taken to Fish Lake, Ind., to
worn on the icefields of a packing firm.
The story had gone around among all
the tramps at the police stations and
railroad yards in Chicago that the packers
were in urgent need of what men they
could secure for harvesting their ice and
would pay $1 a day wases and furnish
board and a free ride to Fish Lake. So
the men gathered at Forty-ninth and
Halstead at an early hour.
But when Foreman Burnam of the com
pany appeared and said that owing to the
warm weather only twenty-five men would
be taken the crowd of hungry, disap-
pointed men became an angry mob. They
hooted the foreman, threw bricks at the
station, broke part of the partition inside
the building and shattered the south
windows.
A call was sent to the Harrison-street
station for a patrol wagon load of police
men, but the officers at the station misun
derstood the situation and no help was
was sent. Detective Aaron Levy of the
Gtand Trunk Railway and Agent Weeks
stood the mob off with revolvers, and
finally succeeded in picking out twenty
five men, who were furnished with tickets
and started on their way rejoicine.
As the train pulled out at 9:20 o'clock
the mob threw bricks and hissed and
howled. They loitered in the vicinity for
some time, and did not leave until Agent
Weeks told them more men would be
needed at Fish Lake as soon as the weather
became colder, and unless they went at
once they would not be taken next time.
SECRETARY SMITH PROTESTS.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.âSecre
tary of the Interior Smith has sent a pro
test to Chairman Lacey of the House Com
mittee on Public Lands againbt the pas
sage of the bill agreed upon by the com
mittee last week providing for free home
steads on the public lands in Oklahoma.
The Secretary represents tlvat the loss to
the United States under this bill will be a
little in excess of $15,000,000. The Secre
tary contends that the proc eds from the
sales of these lands are to be deposited in
the treasury to the credit of the Indians
to recompense them for the cession of the
lands. If the homesteaders are relieved
from payment the Government will be
obliged to appropriate the money to recom
pense the Indians unless the treaty stipu
lations are to be entirely ignored.

and Butte County is the scene of the first
affray. Something in the nature of an in-
Lord Sholto Douglas, Who Figured in an Unpleasantness With a Butte County
Musician.
[From a recent photograph.]
j ternational clash occurred in Oroville this â 
I morning, and Britain's colors, bravely
| borne by Lord Sholto Douglas, the direct
descendant of "Black" Douglas and of
Lord James Douglas, who took the heart
| of King Bruce of Scotland in a silver casket
to the Holy Land, were trailed in the dust.
When the smoke of battle cleared away
j the eayle and the lion were led meekly
enough to a police court to be unleashed
again after satisfactory explanations had
been made to hi 3 Honor.
The collision occurred at 9:30 o'clock this
morning, as the result of a feud originat
ing in Oroville last night, when Lord
Douglas and his theatrical company gave
j a performance.
Petite Lady Douglas sang several songs
which seemingly did not please the noble
i ear of his lordship, and while the Oroville
orchestra of five pieces (Professor Barr,
leader) was playing its sweetest strains the
Douglas stepped before the footlights and
apologized for Mrs. Sholto's poor singing,
j declaring that she could not render the
j proper kind of melody when accompanied
j by such music as Oroville furnished.
Now. if there is anything Professor Barr
j is proud of it is bis orchestra, and such a
reflection as was cast upon it could not go
unnoticed. Calming himself, however,
the baton-wielder resolved to sleep over
the matter, but this did not remove the
desire for gore which the Englishman's
insult had aroused. Barr concluded he
must have satisfaction, and this morning
he met Lord Sholto and submitted an ulti
matum. It was, in effect, that an apology
must be made within three minutes or
British blood would flow.
The Douglas were never accused of
cowardice. Sholto himself has a little
more backbone than his appearance in
dicates, and he refused to apologize.
Then Professor Barr landed a "duke"
upon the lord's domain, just to one side
of the proboscis, and the lord, feeling the
insult, colored upâ that is, 1113 eye did.
Somehow it happened that four Secre
tary Olneys, in the guise of constables,
j were present and the two enemies were
separated, placed under arrest and taken
to the Wilson d'hote, where a charge of
battery was placed against them. During
the engagement Lord Sholto had made a
feint at the professor, over the shoulder of
the jailer, and the otticers thought Jailer
Boyle was beinr; attacked. This caused
the arrest of the lord.
When the case was called, Professor
Barr was released on his own recognizance
and his trial set for next Friday before
J.udge Hills. Lord Douelas explained the
supposed attack on the jailer, stating that
he was only defending nimself, and was
released. He was assisted to his carriage
and driven off in state toward Marysville,
where the company played to-night.
Lord Douglas' left optic was in deep
mourning when last seen in Oroville.
WILL SUM VIS OUT THE TERM.
Captain Bermlnghain Says He Will Xot
Jictire at I'reaent.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 21.-Cap
tain John Bermingham, United States Su
pervising Inspector of Steam vessels, ar
rived to-night. The National Association
of Inspectors will meet to-morrow. Cap
tain Bermingham says he expects to re
main in Washington until February 1 and
will not return to San Francisco before the
middle of next month. Concerning ru
mors that he would resign his office the
captain said:
"I have no idea of resigning at present.
My friends won't allow rae to. I have
eight or nine months to serve yet and ex
pect to remain in office during this time
unless something unforeseen occurs."
The suggestion was made that the
marine engineers would recommend John
Bulger of San Francisco to succeed him
and Captain Bermingham said:
"He is my assistant and a good man."
It is understood that the California Con
gressmen who would have to recommend
a successor to Captain Beruungham are
averse to his resignation and want him to
serve out his term, as there are so many
candidates for the place.
THE SHORTSTOP TOURITAMEXT.
Edtoard JUcLaughlin Defeated Joseph
Capron of Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 21.â Edward Mc-
Laughiin, the Philadelphia billiard player,
at the shorstop tournament defeated Joseph
Capron, the Canadian, this afternoon in
a brilliant game, scoring 400 to Capron's
217. The loser did not do as well as last
night, and his form indicates ho will not
be one of the purse-winners. McLanghlin,
however, surprised the spectators with his
performance.
Neither of the players made much of a
showing at the start, except for Capron's
high run of 57, which kept him ahead of
McLaughlin until the tenth Inning. The
quiet, careful Philadelphian reserved his
strength and skill to the last three innings,
when he made 228 caroms by careful posi
tion play across the table and at the foot.
He also distinguished himself by scorine
the high run of the tournament so far, 114,
missing a long single-cushion shot. His
nursing of the ivories was superb. Score:
McLaughlin,4oo; average, 21 1-19; highest
run, 114. Capron, 217; average, 11 8-19.
Sutton, the Canadian, met his second
defeat to-night in a game with Magtrolio,
which was not much above the average.
Score: Maggolio, 400; highest run, 72;
average, 13 1-30. Sutton, 225; highest run,
69 ; average, 10 25-30.

WANTED AT SANTA ANA
The Alleged Slayer of Mariano
Cuero Arrested at Los
Angeles.
Sheriff Nichols Makes the Capture
After Months of Dili-
gent Inquiry.
SANTA ANA, Cal., Jan. 21.â Sheriff
Nichols of this county made an important
capture at Los Anseies Saturday night.
On the night of October 12, 1X94, a Mexican
named Mariano Cuero was murdered on a
vacant lot at the corner of Fourth and
Birch streets, in this city. He lived sev
eral hours after he had been attacked, but
could give no information to aid in identi
fying the assassin other than that his as
sailant was an American.
Two brothers named Gleason, tourists
from St. Louis, were eye-witnesses of the
affair and cot a view of the mnrderer.
They returned home and Sheriff. Nichols,
who was City Marshal at the time, learn
ing of their knowledge of the crime, cor
responded with them in regard to it for
some months. The Gleasons returned to
Los Angeles this winter and the Sheriff
through their aid located the murderer of
Cuero in that city. . He is G. G. Southern,
a former resident of Newport, where he
farmed rented land. He was arrested
Saturday night and biought here to-night
and lodged in jail awaiting preliminary
examination.
Southern figured in the courts on sev
eral occasions for disturbing the peace,
once for burglary and again for assaulting
a man named Bolan, ami is considered a
dangerous man. He takes his arrest very
coolly, but Sheriff Nichols is confident
that the evidence against Him is conclusive.

ROMANTIC SUIT
AT SANTA CRUZ.
Descendants of King George
IV of England Are
Litigants.
PROPERTY IN DISPUTE.
Great-Grandsons of the British
Ruler Seek to Recover Val-
liable Land.
CLAIMED UNDER A TRUST DEED.
Their Uncle Accused of Having Blort-
gaged a Large Tract Given Into
His Hands for Keeping.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 21.â A pecu
liar and romantic case is being heard be
fore JudÂ«e L/Ogan of the Superior Court in
which 100 acres of valuable land near
Aptos is in controversy and descendants
of King George IV are litigants.
Samuel M. Shortridge and Attorney Mc-
Murray, the latter representing Gunnison,
Booth & Bartnett, appeared as counsel,
the former for the plaintiffs, the several
children of John S. Ord, who sues Ann E.
Ord for the recovery of a deed to the prop
erty. The father of the plaintiffs is a re
puted grandson of King George.
When the King was the Prince of Wales
he married, and one of his offspring was
brought to America when a child by a
Captain Ord, who gave the child his name.
This boy learned his own history after he
had attained manhood, and was known as
James Ord. Ho became the father of ten
children, of which family John S. and
William M. are here engaged in litigation.
Some years ago John gave a deed of
trust to William for his (John's) children.
The deed was never recorded, and later
William married Mrs. Ann E. Williams,
of whom he had borrowed money, giving
a mortage on the property in dispute,
which she foreclosed. Plaintiffs contend
that she had knowledge of the deed from
John to her husband.
The case has onoe been submitted and
was reopened by a cross bill, which Judge
Logan to-day held should be only an
amended answer opposing plaintiff's de
murrer. The case will come up for final
hearing next week.
I>EMA\I>S JtIG DAMAGES.
A Suit That Threatens the Beet-Sugar In-
dustry of the State.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Jan. 21.â A case of
great interest to this county, ana incident
ally of vast concern to the State, occupied
Judge Logan's department of the Superior
Court to-day. Samuel M. Shortridge ap
peared as counsel for the defendant, the
Western Beet Sugar Company, whose fac
tory is located at Watsonville.
The company is being sued by James
Struve, represented by City Attorney Cas
sin of Santa Cruz, for $20,000 damages and
an injunction against the dumping of pulp
from the factory. Mr. Shortridge pre
sented a demurrer this afternoon to the
defective complaint, and the court sus
tained it, requiring the plaintiff to amend
the defects.
The story of the case is that the plaintiff
has a piece of land adjoining the property
of the sugar factory and claims that he is
being damaged by the operation of the
factory. The dumpage is on the laud
owned by the Western Beet Sugar Com
pany and is as necessary to the making
of sugar as the raising and grinding of the
beets. â¢
Should the plaintiff maintain bis suit at
law the county must be deprived of the
large industry provided in the raising of
sugar beets and the manufacturing inter
ests of Watsonville be sreatly retarded.
Having provided its own land on which to
dump the pulp from its factory the de
fendant company desires only that it shall
be left alone to continue the industry.
â¢ It is said here that Struve puts a high
price on the damages he alleges to have
sustained. Mr. Shortridge said to-day
that if Claus Spreckels and others engaged
in the industry must pay $20,000 to all
their neighbors and stop dumping the
pulp from their factories, the beet sugar
industry would soon be dead in California.

SUMMIT'S wetting: AT AIT END.
Light Fall of Snoic Succeed* the Down
pour of Sain,
SUMMIT, Cal., Jan. 21.â For the first
time in nine days a break occurred in the
heavy clouds this evening and a few
patches of blue sky appeared to the
mountaineers almost as an oasis in a
desert.
For thirty-six hours, up to late this
evening, the wind has been blowing al
most a hurricane and rain falling in tor
rents, which is a phenomenal occurrence
on the mountains at this season. The
snow, which measured seven feet in depth
before the rain commenced, has reduced
to less than five feet, caused by the warm
downpour.
An army of watchmen is patrolling the
snowsheds, and the least sign of danger
cannot remain long unnoticed. No fur
ther damage has been reported. A larpe
force of men is at work making permanent
repairs at the late washout near Cisco,
Snow is now falling lightly, but the back
bone of the storm is believed to be broken.
WINNERS AT BAKERSFIELD.
Ravena Captures First Prize in the Opening
Series of the Field Trials for
Bird Dogs.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Jan. 21.â Tho
second day of the field trials was far better
than the first in point of attendance and
fair weather. The storm had cleared up
and the sun shone brightly. The location
was changed from the Stockdale to the
McCiung ranch, where there were plenty
of birds and better cover for handling the
dogs.
The tirst brace were Peach Mark and
Jilt, who were put down to finish the trial
stopped by heavy rain yesterday. They
were down nearly an hour. Then Lady
Staraboul was put down to run a bye, ac
companied by old Sims, a noted dog in
past years. This closed the first series.
In the second series the first brace were
San Carlos and Black Beauty, and they
were down 45 ruinutes. At i:2O o'clock
Ravena and Peach Mark were cast off and
ran 18 minutes. Young Dick and Jilt fol
lowed for 10 minutes. Then San Carlos
and Ravena were again run, followed by
Lady Stamboul and Black Beauty. Lady
Stamboul was finally matched with Peach
Mark.
At the conclusion the judges awarded
first place to Ravena, San Carlos second
and Peach Mark third. The all-age stake
will commence to-morrow. Thursday will
be ladies' day and on Friday an amateur
race will be run.

ZOS AX G EXES SHOOTIXG.
Jaincs Bath* Jcalou*y Lead Almost to
Murder.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Jan. 21.â James
Bath is in a cell at the city jail, charged
with assaulting his wife with intent to
commit murder. The alleged assault was
committed early yesterday morning.
Bath drew a revolver and fired point blank
at his wife, the ball entering her left hand
between the thumb and forefinger^
Bath is a laborer and lived at 545 Ban
ning street. He had for some time past
been jealous of Mrs. Bath, and had threat
ened that he would shoot her. Whether
or not the wife gave her husband cause
for jealousy the neighbors do -not seem to
know. Yesterday matters came to a
climax, when Bath attempted to kill his
wife with 44-caliber bullets.
After firing at the woman, he ran out of
the house and across the street to a lumber
yard at Alameda and Jackson streets,
where he hid himself. Here he was found
by Officer liicco and arrested. Mrs. Bath's
wound is not serious. She will swear to
the complaint upon which her husband
will be prosecuted.
Mrs. Bath this afternoon made a state
ment, in which she claims that when her
husband pointed the revolver at her she
grabbed it. Had it not been foi this the
bullet would have entered her body.

without knowing in any degree what they
mean, or what responsibilities and trials
they bring. The highest and best thing
that any woman can do is to bear and rear
healthy, intelligent children. The accom-
plishment of this end depends almost en-
tirely upon her health and particularly
upon the health and strength of the organs
distinctly feminine. The state of the chil-
dren, both intellectual and physical de-
pends on the mother. 'If she doesn't care
enough for her own comfort and happiness
to take the proper care of herself, she cer-
tainly ought to do it for the j sake of her
children. To a very large extent,* the des-
tiny and achievement of a man is decided
in the months before his birth. During
that time is determined whether or not he
is to be of robust health and strong intel-
lect. During that time, his mind and body
are started on the path that they will follow
through â  life. Circumstances may influ-
ence him, but he cannot get away from the
effects of pre-natal influences. One of the
principal uses of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription is the preparation of prospective
mothers for the time of trial and danger
that comes when a child is born. The " Pre-
scription" is strengthening and invigorating
and lessens pain and danger. ,It insures the
perfect well-being and the perfect health
of both mother and child. Every woman
should know these things before she really
needs to know them. There . are many
things in Dr. Pierces "Common Sense

SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Jan. 21.â Reports
lorn the Feather and Yuba rivers are to
me effect that these streams are running
Dank full and still seem to be rising. The
Sacramento River is rising rapidly here,
find will continue to rise until the im
mense surplus of water from tributary
streams is carried off. To-nis:ht the Sacra
mento marks over twenty-two feet, and
the prospects are that it will be at least
two feet higher by to-morrow night.
The washout which occurred near Dun
nigan yesterday has been repaired, and all
trains are running north by the way of
Davisville. Along the line of the Central
Pacific, over the mountains east of here,
all damage has been repaired, and trains
fere running on time. The overflowed
track near Marysville, caused by the rise
fn tne Feather River, is still a bar to
through travel in that direction, and the
prospects are that it will continue so for
two or three days longer at least. At the
present time local passengers for points
north of Marysville arc transferred around
the inundated section of track in wagons.
Reports from as far up the Sacramento
River as Red Bluff are that the stream at
that point is still slowly rising.
T,he indications now are that the storm
is entirely passed. Not a cloud is visible
from Sacramento to-night, and the at
mosphere is turning cold.

Trurkee's lee Tfealera May Be Robbed of
Their Annual Harvest.
TRUCKEE, Cat.., Jan. 21.â 1t has been
alternately snowing and raining here for
the past twenty-four hours. The wind
- furiously, and, although no damage
has been done, precautions are being
taken to prevent injury to property. The
rainfall for the storm, taken at noon to
day, measured 5.30 inches, not including
four inches of snow. The precipitation for
the last twenty-four hours was .60 of an
in Oh.
Extra men are being detailed to do duty
as tracK-walkers through the mountains.
Tiie Truckee River is booming, and all the
creeks and small streams in the vicinity
are overflowing. This is the wettest season
for fifteen years, as rain is seldom known
to fail here during the middle of winter.
The heavy rains have washed most of the
snow from the ground, and teamsters,
delivery-clerks and others were obliged to
abandon sleighs for more appropriate
vehicles with wheels.
The Digger Indian, who is usually an
authority on weather, says there will be no
more heavy falls of snow this, winter. This
is conceded generally by old residents and
citizens alike to be a fair prediction. The
rains are a great menace to ice dealers,
who have not narvested their fall crop,
and it is feared that what is now on the
ponds will be spoiled. About one-fourth
of tlje usual amount of ice has been har
vested.
Tne ice palace has suffered considerably
from the rain, but should cold weather set
in it could be repaired in a few dayÃ.
Sonoma County Benefited.
PETALUMA, Cal., Jan. 21.â Though
the river was greatly swollen by the rain
storm, only on Sunday night did it over
flow its banks, and though it caused in
convenience no real damage was done.
The sun shone brightly to-day. While the
gales were severely felt, Sonoma County
has much to be thankful for in the visita
tion of the rain ; the crops are well started
and the entire country fresh and green.
For the last forty-eight hours the rainfall
amounted to 2.31 inches.
Cassation of Main at Merced.
MERCED, Cal., Jan. 21.â From and in

rainfall was 8.28 inches. This evening a
stiff north wind is blowing, indicating that
the backbone of the storm has been broken
at last in this part of the San Joaquin Val
ley. The rivers and sloughs are all brim
ming full of water, but up to the present
time there have been no advices as to any
damage resulting from high waters.

FRESNO. Cal., Jan. 21.â After interm
inable delays, nitcnes and legal complica
tions, covering a period of two years, there
seem to be splendid prospects now for the
sale f the bonds of the Monterey and
ire.' j Railroad and (he early construc
tion jf this line. President Jones was in
Fresno yesterday with completed legal
papers for the signature of Secretary Moul

the bond issue will be base]. To a Call
correspondent Mr. Moultrie said:
"All is now ready for placing the bonds,
and we have not the least doubt but that
they will be floated, and that cor v ruction
will soon begin."
The road will be 160 miles in length, and
will pass through Holiister and some of
the BaÂ»t grain and fruit country on earth.
The directors have secured "the water
frontage long sought by the Southern Pa
cific at Monterey, said to be worth $1,000,
--000. With the" completion of this line,
which now seonis assured, the Valley road
and a branch of the Denver aud llio
Grande, Fresno will be the greatest railroad
center in California. Right of way for the
former road has been secured through
Menterey and San Beuito counties, and
arranged for this county. In Monterey the
plan of advertising for street franchise was
pursued with no opposition bids. This
road will have marine connection at Mon
terey for San Francisco.

of this district made an important illicit
-distillery arrest und siezure here this after
noon. Simon Seropian, an Armenian in
differently acquainted with American laws
and customs, has been operating a small
| still on Fresno street and making grape
| brandy for over two years. He seems to
I have intended no concealment of his
! operations, and was greatly astonished
when notified that he was a criminal. He
j had amassed quite a fortune in the busi-
I ness, supplying the local market witn his
I product.
Only a small quantity of brandy was
found, and this was taken to the bonded
warehouse. Seropian was taken before
United Stales Court Commissioner Prince,
who released him on bonds of $2000 and
i his examination was set for to-morrow.
The still owned and operated by Ser
opian had never been registered. Quite a
bit of excitement was created by the ar
rest, since the Armenian is well known
here and has had business relations with
many people in the town.

MT. HAMILTON'S SNAKE
The Big Reptile Again Seen After
Remaining in Hiding for
a Year.
Wounded by Woodchoppers While
Ensconced in the Trunk of a
Hollow Tree.
6AN JOSE, Cal., Jan. I.â The giant
snake that was seen in the vicinity of
Mount Hamilton by Jacob Wandall about
a year ago has again put in an appearance,
and the settlers in that vicinity are mak
ing a determined effort to capture it. The
reptile is said to be fully fifteen feet long,
has a broad, flat head and is of a brownish
color.
A few days ago, as a party of wood
choppers was cutting a hollow white oak,
the ax of one was driven througn the hulk.
This was followed by a loud rumbling and
hissing noise inside, and when the ax was
withdrawn it was covered with blood. The
men hastily withdrew a few feet to watch
developments.
A few minutes later they were startled
to see the huge snake emerge from a knot
hole about ten feet from the ground and
make off through the brush. That the
snake was badly cut is shown by the trail
of blood left.
The woodchoppers say the snake was
fully fifteen feet long, and from all ac
counts it is the largest ever seen on this
coast.

EACH AFTER A REWARD.

Arguments.
TILT IN MR. BUDD'S OFFICE.
Captain Lees Resents an Insinuating
Remark From Major An
derson.'
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 21.â The de
tectives and other people who think they
are entitled to the $1000 reward offered by
the State for the arrest and conviction of
Ivan Kovalev, the Weber murderer, had
another lively round in the Governor's
office to-day, and part of the proceedings
looked rather squally. The remarkable
feature of the strife is that each of the four
claimants is certain that without his work
Ivan Kovalev would have escaped con
viction. Photographer Stevens, who fur
nished the information to the San Fran
cisco authorities that led to the Russian
murderer's arrest, stated to the Governor
during the hearing that he had placed all
of his interests in the hands of Captain
Lees. That was the reason why he had
not put in a claim.
Captain Lees had his inning yesterday
and to-day. The claims of E. L. Bennett,
W. T. Hamilton and George Jost were
heard. The evidence wnich Bennett pro
duced tended to show that Stevens met
him in June, in San Francisco, and ex
citedly tola him that he knew who killed
the Webers in Sacramento. He told Ben
nett there was a big reward and offered
him a share of it if he would go to Sacra
mento with him and lay the matter before
the proper authorities. This Bennett did
not want to do, but suggested that they
go to Captain Lees. Stevens demurred to
this, and seemed to be afraid to have any
thing to do with the San Francisco police
force. Seeing that he could not get him to
go along, Bennett, unknown to Stevens,
went to Captain Lees and told him all
about it, but Captain Lees made light of
the story. Bennett believed that it was
the information that he gave to Lees at
that time that led to the arrest and con
viction of Kovalev.
W. T. Hamilton wanted the reward,
because he had found the murderer's cast
off clothing in a barrel back of the Weber
store a few days after the crime. He
The Man Suspected of Being the Calpella Stage - Robber, Who Gives His Name as
John Schneider.
. [From a photograph taken in the County Jail at Vkiah.}
claimed to be a detective by nature, saying
that he had inherited the instinct.
G. .H. Jost, the last claimant, had
met Kovalev on the night of the murder
in front of the building in which the crime
was committed. At the trial he had iden
tified Kovalev positively as tne man whom
he saw on that night.
During the afternoon proceedings there
came near being a fracas between Captain
Lees and Major Anderson, who acted as
attorney for Bennett in pressing the letter's
claim. Stevens was being questioned by
Anderson when Lees interrupted him.
"1 want you to leave that man alone
when I am talkins to him," exclaimed
Anderson to Lees. "You have had him
where you could get at him whenever you
wanted to, and I think you have primea
him sufficiently."
"Don't you say anything like that to
me, sir," retorted Lees, growing very red
in the face. Anderson repeated the re
mark about the captain's having primed
Stevens, whereupon Lees jumped to his
feet. At this Crisis the Governor inter
fered, declaring that if the belligerents
did not behave he would take a hand in it
himself. With this they cooled down and
later in the day were shaking hands like
old friends.
All evidence in support of the several
claimants was in by 4 o'clock, and the
Governor announced that he would hear
the arguments of their attorneys in his
office to-morrow morning, concluding by
saying that he hoped but little more time
would be consumed, as he had already
given up two days in trying to determine
who should get this $1000.
STANFORD ELECTION.
Juniors Choose Officers After an Exciting
Contestâ Chris Henne the
President.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
21. â The junior ilass held a meeting this
afternoon, at which the regular election of
officers took place. The campaign had
been carried on actively for a week past
and the election was hotly contested. No
less than five candidates were in the field,
and the result was that a larger number
than usual turned out to vote.
Four ballots were taken for president,
Chris Henne being the successful candi
date and Harry Hazzard his closest com
petitor. Other officers were elected as fol
lows: First vice-president, F. V. T. Lee;
second vice-president, B. M. Palmer; sec
retary, Miss Effie McFadden; treasurer,
M. T. Pratt; baseball manager, G. B. Cul
ver; football manager, Charles M. Fickert.
A class council was also elected.
Special interest attaches to the election
of a class president at this time, for the
junior presidency is regarded as the high
est ol class honorary positions. It is the
junior president who leads the junior hop
and oversees various class functions and
ceremonies. Take it altogether, the honor
is, and always has been, eageriy sought
for.
In addition to the election, Mr. Spencer,
business manager of the class annual,
made a report on the condition of the pub
lication and the probable amount needed
for getting the work completed. On his
recommendation a class assessment of $2
was levied on each member.

of articles stolen, among which were two
pearl-handled revolvers which played an

UKIAH'S CAPTIVE BANDIT.
Evidence Against the Alleged
Overland Stage Robber Is
Accumulating.
United States Officials Take Charge of
the Case and Will Prosecute
the Prisoner.
UKIAH, Cat,., Jan. 22.â Great excite
ment still prevails here over the capture
of the man supposed to have robbed the
overland stage on two occasions within
the last three weeks and who, while re
sisting arrest, shot and wounded ex-Sheriff
J. M. Btandley. The prisoner gives his
name Â»s John Schneider and appears to be
taking matters easily. In conversation
with a Call correspondent in his native
language to-day he stated that he had
come to America from Germany less than
j three years ago. When it was suggested
to him that there was danger of his being
j lynched, his only answer was, "Give me a
good gun ana I will make them sick."
Deputy Sheriff J. L. Johnson to-day ap
peared before United States Commissioner
T. L. CJarothers and made affidavit to a
complaint charging John Schneider with
j having, on December 31, 1895, taken from
Mage-driver Theodore Howard United
otates mail. Upon this complaint Com
missioner Carothers issued a warrant and
i ordered Schneider put under arrest.
| l nited States Marshal Barry Baldwin was
â  notified and deputized Sheriff Johnson to
I serve the warrant.
Schneider was called out of jail and the
I warrant read to him. He pleaded entire
j ignorance of the affair, but expressed him
seif as highly displeased at being com
pelled to go to San Francisco for trial.
He was glad, he said, that his preliminary
examination could be held here. Two
complaints were filed to-day, charging
Schneider with robbing the overland stage
last Wednesday and with assault on Stand
ley. Evidence is steadily accumulating
against the prisoner, and the Sheriff and
his deputies are searching for more.
"Spud" Howard, the driver of the stage,
was to-day confronted by the prisoner,
who was dressed in the clothes he wore
when arrested and with a handkerchief
over his eyes. Howard would not say
whether he "was the man who halted him.

Under England's
Colors.
NOW A BRITISH CRATT.
The Schooner Ida Etta Regu

Port of Victoria.
OTHERS WILL SOON FOLLOW.
Complicated Nature of the American
Sealing Regulations Causes
the Trouble.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Jan. 21.-
Araong the passengers bound for Victoria
yesterday was a well-known American
shipmaster who was going for the purpose
of putting his vessel under the British
flag. The gentleman in question was
Captain W. A. Hughes, master and owner
of the sealing schooner. Ida Etta, late of
Seattle. According to his story it will not
be long before every vessel in that profit
able trade will be under the protection of
her Royal Majesty.
On the IGth of January, 1895, Captain
Hughes applied to Deputy Collector Burns
of Seattle for clearance, it being his inten
tion to hunt on the Japan coast. His
vessel at the time was recorded in the cus
tom-house under enrollment and license,
and according to the Treasury Department
regulations no vessel can go to a foreign
port with such papers. What should have
been done by the official was to take up
the enrollment and license and iysue in
lieu thereof a register, under which, after
proper clearance, the vessel would have
been legally entitled to go to a foreign
port. This seemed, however, to be un
known to Burns, for clearance was regu
larly issued. aDd the vessel sailed away to
the land of the Mikado.
On arriving there the American Consul
reported the matter and Captain Hughes
was notified that upon returning to the
United States his vessel would be seized.
Captain Hughes was a good American
citizen and expected that an explanation
would clear away the cloud hanging over
his little craft, through no fault of his, but
he also took the precaution to be on the
safe side. Accordingly on his return he
cleared for Victoria and then came over
to see about the case. As a result the
United States will lose one of its vessels.
Captain Hughes was informed that he had
violated the laws in going to a foreign port
under license and enrollment and that his
vessel would be seized at the earliest
opportunity.
Hughes determined that the oppor
tunity would never be offered, and his
vessel is now regularly registered as a
British craft and can claim protection of
the crown in any part of the civilized or
uncivilized globe; and, what is more, in
case of need she will be protected.
Information from another source is to
the effect that two other schooners in the
same tradeâ the Ainsworth and the Mor
rellâwill be forced to the same extreme in
the Dreruises.

STOCKTON ASYLUM SUIT
Action to Obtain Judgment for
the Maintenance of a
Woman.
Citizens Will Protect the Rights of
Frank Curran's First Wife
and Child.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 21. -James A.
Louttit, acting as attorney for the Board
of State Insane Asylum Directors, this
afternoon commenced suit against Frank
Curran to recover judgment for the main
tenance of Curran'a wife at the institution.
There is quite a sensational story back of
this suit. In November, 1885, Mrs. Curran
was committed to the asylum, F. T. Bald
win being at that time Superior Judge.
Shortly before she had given birth to a
girl, and her illness resulted in insanity.
The babe was taken charge of by a relative,
who has since cared for her.
About a year and a half ago Curran took
a trip to Ireland, and while there married
a second time. In December last he ar
rived in San Francisco on his return from
his native country, bringing with him his
second wife and a child.
Mr. Louttit will see that the issue of the
first marriage is not cheated oat of her
birthright. Besides the action Drought by
the asylum directors suit will be instituted
by some one for guardianship of the insane
mother and also of her child. The guard
ian will then look after the interests of
mother and daughter, and see that they
obtain their share of the property which
Curran owns in this city and county. The
asylum directors have sued Curran for
$1385.

MIND SHAKEN?
Fear That the Minister Is
on the Verge of a
Serious Illness.
NO VISITORS ADMITTED.
Dr. Williams Denies That Miss
Overman Has Asked for
a Hearing.
MRS. TUNNELL STILL HIDING.
It Is Now Alleged That the Pastor
Introduced Miss Overman as
His Niece.
Dr. Brown is in a critical condition, and
the present state of his mind gives peculiar
significance to the certificate of his medical
attendant, presented to the investigating
committee on Friday night. In this Dr.
George H. Palmer stated :
"I find him threatened with serious ill
ness, and, in my judgment, any excite
ment or unusual mental exertion may be
attended with serious results."
It is not physical illness that is threaten
ing the unfortunate pastor. It is some
thing much more serious .than bodily ill
that his friends and family fear.
His intimates as well as his physician
have heretofore been loth to go into par
ticulars regarding his ailment, but in view
of the doubt as to the seriousness of
the minister's condition, one of the friends
of the family yesterday considered that he
was bat doing a kindness to the pastor to
make public the character of his affliction.
"Dr. Brown," he said, "is threatened
with brain fever if not with something
worse, and has not been really responsible
for anything he has said or done for some
time past. The present trouble has
weighed heavily on his mind ever since he
decided on the exposure and arrest of Mrs.
Davidson.
â¢lit' has brooded and brooded over the
matter, and has refused counsel or aid
from every one, so far as the ecclesiastical
eide of the complication is concerned. In
fact, he has chosen to be his own attor
ney, and has simply made a mess of it,
thereby making the mental strain under
whicn he has now been for nearly a month
more intense as each step was made.
"Take his utterance of last Wednesday
night during the prayer-meeting. Would
any normal and reasonable man show such
indiscretion, to put it mildly, as to antag
onize without good cause the entire press
of the City?
"Oii the following day his wife found
him standing up in the center of his study
and gazing blankly about. Sue approached
him and asked him what troubled him.
Jl is answer was, 'Where am I?' Mrs.
Brown informed him that he was in his
study .uid asked if there was anything he
â¢wanted. "Yes, 1 he answered, 'there is
something I want, but 1 can't think what
it is.' it was finally ascertained that he
wanted his dressing-gown.
"Friday he was saying the customary
prayer before breakfast, when he stopped
in the middleof a sentence and was unaDle
to complete it. In conversation he finds
it impossible to retain the continuity of
an idea and breaks off frequently to ask
â¢with a puzzled look, 'What was I saying ?
Where wa- I .
"When I saw him on Sunday he was
lying on a couch, while hot- water applica
tions were being used on his forehead.
He should in reality have been in bed
then, but he is hard to control. This scan
dal is continually preyingon his mind and
makes him too restless to be kept in bed.
"His physician has prescribed absolute
mental rest, and Dr. Brown has been or
dered not to read anything in the news
papers pertaining to his case. He has, of
course, perfectly lucid intervals, and for
the past two or three days has shown
signs of improvement, though not to any
marked extent."
Dr. Palmer, when asked yesterday as to
the condition of Rev. Dr. Brown, simply
replied that he was somewhat improved.
"Will you state the exact nature of the
trouble that Dr. Brown is suffering from?"
was asked.
"I cannot tell you anything further than
that he is somewhat better," answered the
doctor.
"Is his malady of a physical nature, or
is it one that simply affects his mind?"
was then asked.
"I am very sorry to say that I am not at
liberty to discuss his condition in detail or
state his ailment," was all the physician
would say.
That Dr. Brown's condition is en
tirely understood and appreciated by a
few members of the investigating commit
tee and by his family is not disputed.
Deacon Dexter, Dr. \Villiams and Mrs.
Brown are thoroughly aware of the seri-
ousness of the situation, and it is probably
this knowledge which makes them more
than ordinarily reserved. The pastor's
wife absolutely refuses to answer any
questions pertaining to her husband's
health.
Deacon Dexter said yesterday that while
Dr. Brown was a very sick man, he would
in all probability be able to attend the
Dext meeting prepared to give his version
of the grave charges resting against him.
"I have not seen Dr. Brown to-day," said
Dr. Williams, "because I have been too
busy to call. I understand, however, that
he is a very sick man â more in mind than
body. Just how ill be is Ido not care to
say. though his condition is unquestion
ably serious. It is absolutely necessary
that he have rest and perfect quietness for
the next few days; otherwise I would not
care to be responsible for the result.
'â¢Of course any visit I might make to Dr.
Brown world be purely of a social nature.
Deacon Dexter has charge of ah business
pertaining to the investigation, so far as
Dr. Brown is concerned, hence it will be
readily seen that any attempt on my part
to prove such a. matter would be entirely
out of place."
In view of Dr. Brown's serious mental
condition, as reported by his friends and
corroborated by the attending physician,
it is not thought possible that he will be
able to attend the regular prayer-meeting
to-night. As senior deacon D. Gilbert
Dexter will in all probability conduct the
services.
Deacons Barnard and Dextei and Dr.
Williams emphatically deny the state
ment published in the Examiner of yes
terday that MisÂ» Overman at any
time askoa permission to read her version
of the affair before the committee. Â«
"The story is without foundation in
fact so far as this committee is con
cerned," said Dr. Williams yesterday.
"Miss Overman has never intimated, by
word or deed, any desire to be heard,
though I have no doubt she expects to be
called at the proper time.
''If she has written a statement we are
not aware of it, informally or otherwise.
I say 'we,' because I have attended
every meeting of the committee and I
know that no such request has been re
ceived from her. The statement was also
made that the future meetings of the com
mittee would be open to the public.
While I sincerely trust that such a policy
will be followed, there was nothing Baid
at the meeting last night to indicate such
a course.
"I wish to say right here that a wrong
impression seems to prevail concerning
the position of Deacon Dexter. He is gen
erally credited with beinu' most anxious to
avoid a public inquiry. Such a conclusion
is entirely wrong and does the gentleman
a great injustice. Mr. Dexter wants every
thing to be open and aboveboard, and is
doin'i: nil in his power to bring this about.
lam not prepared to say who it is tnat
oppose a public inquiry, because that
would be betraying a trust. But I do
know tuat Mr. Dexter is not of that num
ber."
The action of the committee as a whole
in insisting that ihe sessions be conducted
behind closed doors has caused consider
able unfavorable comment. Yesterday a
prominent member of the board of inquiry,
under the promise that his name would
not be used, consented to make the follow
ing statement:
"From the very first I have fought
against secret sessions, as have other mem
bers of the committee, but not caring to
offend any one the majority have yielded
to the silent arguments used by the few.
Now do not misunderstand me. There has
never been any actual discussion over the
advisability of secret meetings, but from
a word dropped here and there every man
on the committee understands just how
his fellow-juror, so to speak, feels .
"From what I can gather the following
gentlemen favor open sessions: Dr. Wil
liams, Dr. Mooar, Dr. Pond, Dr. McLean
and Deacons Dexter and Barnard. Those
who by action or otherwise have indicated
a preference for a secret investigation are
Deacons Hatch, Vasconcellos and Dewing
and Folger and Westgate of the standing
committee. One or two of the last named
gentlemen gave evidence of weakening at
the last meeting, thoueh they may be just
as strong in that direction as ever next
Monday night.' 1
The announcement made some days ago
that Dr. Pond would decline to serve on
the committee appears to be without
foundation. The reverend gentleman is
now at Santa Cruz on business, but he has
written Dr. Williams a letter declaring his
intention of being present at the next
meeting. The last named gentleman said
yesterday that Dr. Pond's apparent un
willingness to serve was not due to fear of
public opinion, but to business matters
which demanded his attention. He had
been induced, however, to lay aside all
these things, and would unquestionably be
present at ail future meetings.
Mrs. Tunnell is not in San Francisco,
and there is very little likelihood of her
coming here until after the trial of Mrs.
Davidson. Just what her testimony
would be in open court is purely pÂ»*oble-
matifal, but her hasty departure after
the Sunday night visit to Dr. Brown
creates the impression that any statement
she might be called upon to make under
oath would be unfavorable to all con
cerned.
Mrs. Tunnell, or rather Mrs. Fowler, for
that is her proper name, is still in hiding
in Tulare county. Her wearing apparel
which she left at 1041 Mission street, has
been shipped to her by express. This
would seem to indicate that her stay in
the lower country will be poverned by the
developments in the Brown-Davidson
scandal.
It Will beremembered that in the first
developments of this case it was alleged
that Dr. Brown introduced Miss Overman
to many people as his niece. This was on
the occasion of the joint trip to Tacoma by
the water route. It is probable that the
pastor will be asked by the committee to
explain this, and also another event of
practically similar nature.
Shortly aftor Miss Overman first came to
San Francisco and at the same time a
regular inmate of the pastor's house, she
became prominent in the First Congrega
tional Church. It is alleged that on her
first visit to the church she became a
member of Dr. Brown's Bible class. It is
now alleged that she was introduced by
the pastor as his niece, and was so looked
on for a long time.
Gradually, however, it became known
that she was merely a portege, so to speak,
and while that did not lessen her popular
ity, it caused considerable comment. The
apparent platonic friendship of Dr. Brown
for Miss Overman soon d'spelled any suspi
cions which might have been aroused and
so the matter was allowed to drop.
It was not until the accusations of Mrs.
Davidson became public property that the
Bible class episode was recalled. Now the
committee will ask Dr. Brown to explain.
No arrangements have as yet been made
by the committee for the introduction of
Mrs. Davidson's statement. Mrs. David
son will be given a hearing beyond any
doubt, but whether in the committee-room
or branch County Jail has not been de
cided.
TO-MOBROW'S AUCTION.
A Large Attendance and Spirited Bid-
ding Anticipated at the Sale-
Judging from the numerous inquiries
made the indications are that Baldwin <fc
Hammonds auction sale of the property
belonging to the Pacific Improvement
ConiDany will draw a big crowd to-morrow
and there wiil be active competition for
the property.
While the inquiry is confined principally
to the lots near the power-house of the
Market-street Kailway Company, and
especially to those on Market and Valencia
streets, the other property on the cata
logue will probably develop numerous bid
ders. The lots in the block bounded by
Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Valencia street and
Albion avenue are very desirable and
should bring good prices.
The auctioneers announce that they will
be prepared, if necessary, to meet the low
est views of intending purchasers and this
announcement should attract those who
are hunting for bargains.
The sale takes place at 12 o'clock noon
to-morrow at the salesroom of Baldwin tfc
Hammond, 10 Montgomery street.
Flood's Home Released.
The attachment levied by the Ponohoe-
Kelly Bank upon the property on Eddy street
held by the wife and daughters of .1. W. Flood,
the defaulting cashier, has been released.
When first the trouble for Flood began Joseph
A. Donohoe assured him that Mrs. Flood and
her daugnters snould not be deprived of their
home. Acting upon z that Flood deeded his
property on Eddy street to them, but afterward
ihe.-bank attached the property to the full
amount of $1:19,000, the sum ol Flood's short
age, although the property was not worth near
that suxn.:'Flood pleaded guilty and was sen
tenced to seven years' imprisonment, 'and
now, in pursuance of Donohoe's prolate, the
attachment lias been released. - â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1896.
DEATH OF A. PAGE BROWN
The Architect Succumbed to In
juries Received Last
October.
WAS PROSTRATE FOR MONTHS.
Career as an Architect in This City.
Noted Buildings Which He
Designed.
A. Page Brown, an architect well known
in San Francisco and New York, died at
Burlingarne, San Mateo County, yesterday
at 8:25 a. m. Death was the result of in
juries inflicted in a runaway on October 7.
At the time of this accident Mr. Brown
was driving a spirited horse, which be
came unmanageable and dashed the cart
into a gully. Mr. Brown was so badly
hurt that he was never able to get about
again. During a long period of suffering
he was unconscious most of the time. He
was moved from one bed to another in the
same room to afford him relief, but during
all the time he was completely prostrate.
A. Page Brown came to San Francisco
from New York in 1888. He took a lead-
THi: LATE A. P.VGK BROWN.
[From a photograph by Taber.]
ing position among architects at onie, as
the reputation which he had gained in
New York had extended to California.
His career in this City was one of great
activity. He was the architect of the
handsome Crocker building, of the A. N.
Towne house on California street, the
Donahue buiiding, the Crocker monument
in Mountain View Cemetery, the Alham
bra Theater at Redwood City, the Califor
nia building of the World's Fair, Chicago,
the Y. M. C. A. buildine on Ellis street,
the Administration building of the Mid
winter Fair, and the cottages of Bur
lin game. His design for the union depot
at the foot of Market street was accepted
by the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners.
Mr. Brown was 3Â»> years of age last Octo
ber. He was born in New York and was
educated there, graduating with honors at
Cornell University. He married in New
York a daughter of Judge Roger A. Pryor.
In the ante-bellum days Judge Pryor was
a member of Congress from Virginia, and
during the war espoused the cause of the
Southern Confederacy. At the close of
the struggle he went to New York and be
came a leader at the bar. Mrs. Pryor gained
some distinction in recent years as a con
tributor to the magazines, and Page Brown
was highly pleased with his mother-in
law's literary achievements.
Mi. Hrown's family consisted of his wife
and three children. He was not a rich
man by any means, but it is reported that
he carried ' life Insurance policies to the
amount of $75,000.
In the full meaning of the term he was
progressive and public-spirited and men
who knew of his talents and energy and
tact predicted for him a professional ca
reer of exceptional renown. He was a
member of the Bohemian, Pacific Union
and University clubs, He was also a Ma
son of California Lodge, a Knight Templar
of California Commandery, a member of
the Institute of Architects and the Mark
Hopkins Institute of Art.
William H. Crocker, who was intimately
acquainted with Mr. Brown, went to Bur
linsame yesterday.
The funeral services will be held to-mor
row, Thursday, at the family residence in
Burlingame, on the arrival" of the 10:40
a. m. train from San Francisco. The in
terment w.ll be private.
AGAINST PRESERVE CLUBS
The Sportsman's Protective Asso
ciation Is Aroused to
Action.
Prominent Speakers Who Addressed
the Meetingâ Will Fight to
a Finish.
The Sportman's Protective Association
held a very large and enthusiastic meeting
last night at K. of R. B. Hail. Mason and
O'Farrell streets. W. J. Ahem presided,
and made the opening address, in which
he explained the objects of the meeting,
which were to provide measures to com
bat the actions of the preserve ciub3, which
are trying to defeat the aims of the sports
men at large.
About one hundred new members joined
the club, among whom was John Lee, of
the firm of Christy & Wise, who spoke as
follows:
"i have been a resident of this State for
twenty-six years and was one of the first
to join the Cordelia Preserve Club; but a
few years ago I made a visit to my native
country, England, and there saw a practi
cal illustration of the pernicious system of
preserve clubs and the thought then
dawned. upon me that I was espousing a
cause that in my younger days 1 was
strongly opposed to, and on my return
to ihis City I immediately "resigned
from, tbo Cordelia Preserve Club, since
which time I have fought the preserve
club system because I do not wish to see
the old country laws regarding game in
troduced into this grand and free State."
George \V. Dennis Jr., who was ap
pointed a committee on laws and super
vision at a recent meeting of the associ
ation, read the opinions of some prominent
attorneys on the question of blockading
navigahle sloughs. They all considered
the actions of the Cordelia Preserve Club
as being decidedly illegal. The association
will have the United States Grand Jury
and the Attorney-General take action
against, the Cordelia Club.
The next meeting of the association will
beheld on Tuesday evening, February 4,
at its regular meeting quarters.
HOBBED A NOBLEMAN'S SON.
Warrant Out for Sadie Moore Alias
Lizzie Cook.
Arthur Burgher, who says he is a son of
an Austrian nobleman, swore out a war
rant in Judge Conlan's court yesterday for
the arrest of Sadie Moore, on the charge
of grand larceny.
! Burgher said he had been in this City
! about six months. Three years aÂ»o he
i left home for a trip around the world! He
had visited Italy, Turkey, Siberia, China,
< Japan, and in July last he reached this
continent.
Monday night he left the Grand Hotel,
where be bad been a guest, to see the
I sights and by chance met Sadie Moore,
J better known as Lizzie Cook. They visited
I several pleasure resorts together and had a
j jolly time. After Burgher returned to his
| room he discovered that his money had
j disappeared. He had about $80 when he
met Sadie and although he had spent
about $50 while in her company, he was
! $30 short. He told his friends at the hotel
that he had been robbed and they advised
1 him to have Sadie arrested.
MERCED'S LICENSE LAW
It Receives Some Support From
a Supreme Court De
cision.
The Law Cannot Be Tested by Trying
Individual Cases of Op
pression.
The high license ordinance of Merced
County has been supported by the Supreme
Court in an appeal from a decision in favor
of the county, the action being one to coi
lect licenses under the law.
The principal contention was that the
court erred in excluding evidence offered
] by defendant to show that tiie effect of the
i ordinance in question, if enforced, is vir
: toallv to prohibit the retail traffic in
j the county of Merced.
In deciding this point the Supreme
Court admits that the power to regulate
for the purpose of revenue is not the power
to prohibit, and an attempt to accomplish
the latter object under pretense of regula
tion cannot be upheld ; in other words the
right to prohibit the sale or traffic in in
toxicating liquors is entirely separate and
distinct from the power to impose a license
tax thereon, for revenue purposes, and an
ordinance which in terms proceeds under
the latter power, but in its effect amounts
to an exercise of the former, will not
stand.
The questionjof the evil effects of the law,
the Supreme Court announces, cannot be
determined from the effects of the ordi
nance upon one man. The .Board of Su
pervisors in passing the law is presumed
to have acted in good faith, and it cannot
be assumed that, while pretending to fix
the tax for revenue, they will make it so
large 39 to prohibit business. When a
court hears evidence to determine whether
or not a license tax be so high as to pro
hibit business, they take upon themselves
the exercise of a legislative power. The
Supreme Court, therefore, says that
whether or not an ordinance be reason
able is a question to be determined from
the ordinance, and it must be upheld un
less, as a matter of law, the court finds it
is so evidently unreasonable as to be be
yond the proper limitations of a law-mak
ing body.* It is not a question of fact to
be determined upon the varying circum
stances of each particular case.
the law be reasonable or not is for the
court to decide and not for a jury, and so
evidence as to ita individual effects is not
admissible.
TWO NEW CORPORALS.
Patrolmen W. F. Geimann and Michael
SJnumliHii Promoted.
Two promotions were made by Chief
Crowley yesterday, which were acknow
ledged to be richly deserved. William P.
Geiuiann and Michael Shanahan were pro
moted to the rank of corporal.
Geimann is a native son and joined the
department on October 16, 1891. He was
at once assigned for duty in the Property
Clerk's office, where he remained till last
week, when he was transferred to the
Chief's office. He is a popular young
officer, and as the Chief remarked yester
day "he is a very competent cierk."
Shanahan was" born in Ireland and joined
the force on December 9, 1889. He is an
efficient orlicer and was one of the six men
selected for mounted duty in the Mission
district last month. He will have charge
of the mounted squad, under, of course,
the direction ol Captain Gillin.
The golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs.

THE FERRY DEPOT MUDDLE
Attorney Stratton Diametrically
Opposed to Attorney Fitz
gerald.
THE COMMISSIONERS WILL ACT.
Ex-Superintendent of State Dredgers
W. Cruse Was Completely
Exonerated.
Attorney Frederick S. Stratton is of the
opinion that the Haroor Commissioners
should go ahead with the building of the
new ferry depot. When the board met
yesterday he presented a statement which
began as follows:
At the inception of my employment as
special counsel by your board I found that
with reference to the adoption of plans and
specifications and the preliminary steps look
ing to tne execution of contracts for the pro
posed building, you had followed the pro
visions of section 2524 of the Political Code,
and it was understood that you had not pur
sued the method required by the general
building act of March 28, 1876.
Not being responsible, therefore, for the
situation in which I found your board as to
which of these laws should have Deen pursued,
I have endeavored to view the questions in
volved impartially and judicially.
The result has "been to unhesitatingly con
firm the opinion which I have heretofore ex
pressed to you, that the section of the Political
('ode referred to, and not the buildidg act of
1 H / (>, should control.
Unfortunately, however, the Attorney-Gen
eral has till along dissented and has expressed
himself in writing as convinced that the
building Ret of 1870 should alone be followed
in the letting of contracts :or the new
ferry and passenger depot.
He then referred to the fact that the At
torney-General as chief law officer of the
State would have great power with the
Boftrd of Examiners, and pointed out that
he (Stratton) had "labored assiduously to
harmonize the building act and the Politi
cal Code," in order to show that the proper
steps required in each had been pursued.
Attorney Stratton then goes on to say:
The building act requires that all specifica
tion^ and plans mv.it iirst be approved by the
Governor, Secretary of State and Treasurer,
after which proposals inviting bids shall there
upon be published.
But the building act does not require the ap
proval of the Governor, Secretary of State and
Treasurer to be evidenced in writing, and I
am of the opinion that i* they were orally ap
proved by them then this preliminary and
important objection will have been success
fully mci.
Tne Governor, in his conversations with me,
had in your presence, is positive as to the ap
proval by himself and the Secretary of State,
and it has only remained to determine whether
or not the Treasurer had, through his deputy,
likewise given his approval.
The Attorney-General has, as I understood
him, announced to me that if such approval
bad been made by the deputy of the Treasurer,
and if the Governor would further so certify
sueli facts in any written communication, then
we could doubtless harmonize all the remain
ing steps to be followed by both the building
act and the Political Code.
The various contractors and their attorneys
have ail along, and with propriety, bitterly
compluiued at the embarrassments of the situ
ation and have sought at your hands some so
lution of tiie difficulty, and I think, therefore,
that you should take some definite steps -with
out further delay, so as to determine what your
portion would be, and, if necessary, enable
any person or officer aggrieved to test the mat
ter in some appropriate proceeding.
I do not think that the board should, unless
their duty is plain, disavow their own jurisdic
tion ami impugn the correctness of the steps
which they have already taken in this matter.
I call your attention to the fact; that, al
thoueh the Attorney-General is the highest
law dllicer in the .State, and while any opinion
given by him should undoubtedly receive the
consideration and should be entitled to the
respect which the known ability and learning
of that officer entitles it, still such opinion no
more determines the law than does the opinion
of any attorney to whom the questions might
be submitted.
The Attorney-General himselt freely con
cedes this, and, provided you act in good faith,
any stops pursued by you in this matter would
free you from all criticism and question of per
sonal liability.
The lowest bid in each cace and for the vari
ous parts of the depot work have been accepted
by you. This, therefore, constitutes a con
tract between the State and the various con
tractors. The execution of the written instru
ments embodying all the terms as to specifica
tions and proposals, together with the accept
ance of any Did, while perfectly proper and
necessary for certain purposes, does not, how
ever, render the rights of the contractors any
more binding than they now are.
Should you continue to refuse, or to delay en
tering nto such contract, then, as a proposi
tion of law. the contractors would have an
election either to enforce their rights as evi
denced by the acceptance of their bids, or they
could treat the contracts as rescinded by
mutual consent.
Mr. Rtratton then recommends that the
board go ahead and act on its original
plan, and concludes by saying:
Should the Board of Examiners refuse to ap
prove any warrant issued by you for this work,
then] as I have heretofore argued the same
question before Judge Sanderson, which was
followed by a favorable decision on his part, I
should be very glad to avail myself of auy op
portunity to appear in the Supreme Court as
amicus curia; and present my views on the
points involved.
I therefore recommend that you, by resolu
tion, call upon the contractors, and each of
them, to forthwith appear at a time and place
named to enter into the contracts heretofore
submitted to you for adoption.
After the reading of the report it was de
cided by President Colnon and Commis
sionpr Chadbourne that all the bondsmen
should be required to be in attendance at
2p. m. to-morrow. At that hour the con
tracts will be signed and the contractors
can begin work at once. Then when the
first bill is presented to the Harbor Com
missioners they can refuse payment, and
the case will be carried to the Supreme
Court.
It is all not plain sailing, however. Gov
ernor Budd does not seem to be satisfied
about the matter. After the Harbor Com
missioners adjourned yesterday a telegram
was received by President Colnon stating
that in view of the fact that there was a
difference of opinion among the attorneys
in regard to the law of 1876 and the code,
that it would be better to have an agreed
case submitted to the Supreme Court.
This mixes up matters considerably, but
the chances are that the bonds will be
signed to-morrow, and that the first pay
ment for work done will carry the case
into court.
When the depot question was disposed
of the Simpson Lumber Company ap
peared by its secretary and objected to be
ing charged wharfage for lumber that was
allowed to remain on the wharf over
twenty-four hours. It was shown that it
was not a permanent occupation, but that
every lumber vessel that discharged left so
much of a surplus which was carted away
as quickly as possible. In the circum
stances President Colnon moved that the
chief wharfinger be instructed to deal
leniently with the company.
Superintendent of Construction Patter
son got into trouble with Commissioner
Chadbourne. The former O. X.'d a bill of
D. Kelso's for teaming work done in haul
ing rock to the seawall lots. The account
went back to last September, and nothing
accompanied it to show what the money
was being paid for. This made Chad
bourne angry, and he refused to pay the
money until an itemized bill was sub
mitted. Patterson attempted to explain
the situation, but the colonel refused to
accept anything but an itemized account.
If D. Kelso wants that $160 which his bill
calls for he had better do what Commis
sioner Chadbourne wants, and explain
what he has done in order to have a claim
against the State for $160.
William Cruse, the ex-superintendent of
dredgers, whom Haste accused of receiv
ing a percentage from firms who did work
for the State, nad the following concerns
represented to deny the allegation: Cali
fornia Machine Works, Phelps Manufac
turing Company, W. F. Boswell it Co.,
William Deacon (Main-street Iron Works),
Golden State Foundry, J. C. Hendry cfc
Co., Brufifit Siowa & Co.; White J3fos.,
Crockard & Co., Thompson & Sons, and S.
P. Nelson & Co. President Colnpn ques
tioned them all very closely, and at the
conclusion said, "Mr. Cruse, the result is
very fluttering to you," in which sentiment
Commissioner Chadbourne heartily con
curred. During the questioning it was
brought out that nearly all the men ex
amined were Republicans, and President
Colnon jokingly remarked, "To the victors
belong the spoils."
Since Mr. Colnon has been on the board,
however, the regular routine has been
changed, and now everything required by
the State on the water front has to be put
up and given to the highest bidder. In
this way all supplies are purchased and
repairs to tugboats and dredgers made.
A new system is in force, and the presi
dent is determined to see that the water
front is run on a purely business basis.
IN NEW HANDS.
Chase's New England Home Bakery
Passes into the Hands of Gano
Coleman,
The beautiful bakery at 1923 Fillmore
street known as Chase's New England
Home Bakery has passed into the hands
of Gano Col em an.
It will be remembered that this estab
lishment was erected a little over a year
ago. The amount of money expended in
every detail attracted a good deal of com
ment at the time. The salesrooms and
offices are elaborately decorated, the
delivery wagons are the prettiest driven
through the streets, and the bakery proper
is very large and furnished with every
facility for producing the very best results.
Gano Coleman.
"What was at the time considered as
lavish expenditure has proved a profitable
one.
"That the time is ripe fora large bakery
run on modern lines is evident," said Mr.
Coleman, the new proprietor, yesterday,
"and while I have retained all the old heip
I have taken steps to conduct the business
on a larger scale, and in a still more satis
factory manner."
Mr. Coleman was born and bred in the
South, his birthplace being Augusta
Ga. For several years past he has re
sided in San Francisco and for the last
eight years he has been identified with the
big grocery-house of Goldberg, Bowen &
Leibenbaum. His many friends wish him
continued success in his new business in
vestment. â

CROCKERY FIRM ASSIGNS
L. Altschul and Company Un
der Examination by
Creditors.
THEIR LIABILITIES $18,000.
The Assets Were $10,000 Which, With
Other Resources, May Permit
Resumption Soon.
The crockery business of L. Altschul &
Co. of 42"_' Bansome street is in the hands
of an assignee, pending an investigation
by a committee of creditors to deciie
whether to have the linn continue the
business or to close up accounts with the
stock on hand.
On January 16 Altschul, realizing hia
position, caused by a depression of busi
ness, too active competition and an ina
bility to collect, appointed .Philip Stern
his assignee, and Monday afternoon about
thirty of tbe local creditors met at Attor
ney Abraham Kuef's office and ratified
the appointment of the assignee and com
mended the choice made.
The liabilities amount to about $18,000,
and are divided among thirtv-flve local
creditors and twelve Eastern creditors.
They are all commercial debts with the
exception of three or four money loans
covered by merchandise securities not
included in the list of asseis, which is
valued at about $10,000. It is asserted that
the assets and tne liabilities would nearly
balance if the pledged debts were counted
as assets.
The sentiment expressed by the credit
ors at Monday's meeting was in favor of
Altschul's continuing the business and be
ing allowed time in which to settle his in
debtedness.
A committee of three, representing the
American Import Company, S. L. Jones <fc
Co. and Marsh, Kidd & Co., was appointed
from the commercial creditors to appraise
the value of the stock ana to decide upon
the advisability of continuing the busi
ness. The committee is composed of ex
perts in the crockery and glassware busi
ness and will make its report in a few days.
Meanwhile the assignee will go on with
the business.
CLEARED HER DECKS.
The Monterey Made Ready and Her Big
Guns Trained on the City.
There was an exhibition drill on board
the battle-ship Monterey yesterday. It was
a pretty exhibition, and those who wit
nessed it were highly pleased with the
movements of the crew and the easy and
ready handling of the big guns.
Lieutenaut Wadhams was in command
of the men. The deck was cleared for ac
tion in almost less time than it requires to
tell the story. The big guns were trained
on the City in order to show how easy it
would be to drop projectiles into the cen
ters teeming with commercial life.
"Big Betsy." "Big Ben" and the Hotch
kiss guns were handled witn a quickness
that greatly surprised those who witnessed
the drill. The movements of the men
showed that they were thoroughly in
touch with the arts peculiar to battle
ships.
The display demonstrated to the satis
faction of the experts present that the
Monterev is thoroughly equipped for
coast-defense purposes, and that the decks
can be cleared for action almost in the
twinkling of an eyj.

as fcoruu of the words of the speech were

any man can be accounted a diplomatist
who undertakes to talk Latin in an after
dinner speech.
THERE IS NO EXCUSE.
If there were conceivable good reasons,
either oh the score of justice or policy, for
extending the debt of the Pacitic roads,
fair-minded persons could be found in
abundant numbers to support such a
scheme. In California, where of necessity
the case is better understood than any
where else in the country, there is a unan
imity of opinion against such a scheme,
and this opinion isen titled to respect from
the country at large and particularly from
Congress.
Nothing could be more deplorable than
the bitter antagonism existing between
the Southern Pacitic Company and the
people of California, for that very feeling,
acting independently of the causes that
have produced it, has been exceedingly in
jurious to the State. Such a condition of
affairs exists in no other State of the
Union. Iso other railroad in this country
is so hated and feared by the people whom
it serves.
This cannot be explained on any as
sumption that the people of this State are
unreasonable or that they cherish a preju
dice against capital. On 'the contrary,
some of the largest and richest corpora
tions flourish here, and some of the
strongest of them have the confidence and
respect of the people. All that have been
reasonable in their relations with the pub
lic are treated with all due consideration.
But when a powerful corporatiou, what
ever its business, follows the methods
which have distinguished the conduct of
the Southern Pacific, it must expect to
meet with the bitterest opposition that a
common sense of outrage will in
spire. The people had already believed
that the company had resorted to prac
tices of a character to outlaw it, but this
impression was given tangible force by
the irrefragable testimony brought out in
two of the most famous legal investigations
ever held in this country. One was the Col
ton suit, in which the widow of one of the
four men who built the Central Pacific
sued the surviving partners for an
accounting. In that trial disclosures of
the most astounding and staggering kind
were madeâ among others thatC. P. Hunt
ington, over his own signature, coolly dis
cussed in letters addressed to Colton the
regular business of controlling Congres
sional legislation in favor of the company
by corrupt means.
That was only a small part of the infamies
discovered. The Pattison railroad inquiry
went further into material matters and
showed how the people and the Govern
ment had been grossly swindled in the
I construction and management of the
| property. The wonder is less that an an
| tagouisin exists than that it is not far
I deeper and more relentless than it is. In
comparison with the wrongs which they,
; the people, have suffered, the vigor of their
present protest is very feeble and inade
quate. It is upon their knowledge of the
past that their fears of the future are
based. They know not only that the pas
; sajre of a funding bill would perpetuate
i the evils which have oppressed them, but
that these evils will of necessity De in
creased. The State is now carrying a heav
ier burden than it can bear, and it is call
ing upon the country to save it from de
struction.
THE ASTS AND CEAFTS.
The initial exhibition given under tne
direction of the Guild of Arts and Crafts is
I a remarkably successful beginning. The
art of printing, from its origin to its latest
i development, is the subject under present
I review, and a surprisingly large and com
! prehensive collection of specimens has
been assembled. The exhibition has in its
intrinsic beauties, aside from its industrial
I interest, an attractiveness of a rare order.
The guild is an association of enthusias
i tic promoters of esthetic advancement and
its membership embraces practical work
era in various lines of art and others who
have sympathy for the movement thus un
â¢ dertaken. Its usefulness csn be made very
extensive, the mere effect of membership
in it conducing strongly to the advance
ment of higher culture in matters within
! its scope. It can elevate the general
standard of a taste in architecture, interior
decoration, painting, prints, furnishings
and many other things.
At present, so far as we are informed,
its purvit-w is limited to those matters
which have a universal home and value.
In time we shall expect it to expand its
field to embrace artistic possibilities pe
culiar to California. There is abundant
time for all that. Meanwhile it is very
likely soon to be that membership in this
guild will be regarded as a cachet of refine
ment. Still better than that wonld be its
endowment by gome wealthy Californian
after some such generous fashion as that
set by Mr. Searles -with regard to the Hop
kins Institute of Art.
The merit of such an attention will be
determined by the conduct of the guild it
self. If it discover a high order of business
sense and keep down any possible tenden
cies toward internal jealousies it is sure to
command respect and exercise power. It
has the opportunity of doing a fine and
lasting service to the people of the City,
and as its spirit must be democratic it
should be able to carry its benefits to
all classes ready to accept them.
CLEVELAND'S POBEIGN POLICY.
Reports from Washington concerning
the attitude of the administration toward
Cuba are uncertain and somewhat conflict
ing. It seems fairly assured, however, that
a decided step of one kind or another is
under consideration by the Cabinet and
the rapid march of events in the island
may lead to its announcement to Congress
is a very short time.
It is rather unfortunate that at this
juncture the administration should be so
much discredited by its home policy and
so much out of favor with the people on the
eve of a Presidential election. The situ
ation is such that many patriotic people
will be led to suspect tljat the President
is seeking to get up something like a war
excitement in order to distract attention
from the serious blunders committed in
his tariff and financial measures. If such
a suspicion finds place in pome quarters at
home we may be sure it will be accepted
as truth by not a few people abroad. The
natural result of such suspicions will be to
weaken the effect of the language of the
administration and make the possibility
of war more probable than it would other
wise be.
This weakness of the administration
makes it imperative that both branches of
Congress should give it prompt and effec
tive support. It is most satisfactory,
therefore, to note that in neither House
has there been any notable attempt either
to hamper the action of the President or to
cast suspicion on his motive. The attitude
of the Republican leaders has been
thoroughly and constantly patriotic in the
whole matter. Without condoning in the
slightest degree the mischief caused by the
free-trade deficit tariff and the offensive
manner in which the bonded debt has been
increased, all Republicans have heartily
sustained the President in the general
policy he has adopted toward the settle
ment of the foreign question.
These facts must be borne in mind when
the time comes for Congress to act upon
any policy Cleveland may adopt toward
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1896.
Cuba or the formal indorsement, of resolu
tions defining the scope and limit of the
Monroe doctrine. Such questions will, of
course, cause differences of opinion on
matters of detail, and therefore give rise
to what may prove to be prolonged debates
in both Houses. The discussion, however,
will not imply any opposition to the Mon
roe doctrine as a principle, nor any
attempt to weaken the administration in
dealing with a foreign nation. However
the debates may range the virtual una
nimity of sentiment on those two proposi
tions has been made evident and declared.
It seems that the time has come when
the United States must make clear to all
the world the policy it intends to pursue as
the controlling power of the Western
hemisphere. It must make clear also the
further fact that its Pan-American policy
will be determined at Washington, and
not by some court of arbitration held
elsewhere. Matters of detail like the
boundary line of Venezuela may be sub
mitted to arbitration, but the Monroe
doctrine will not be. Questions of
autonomy, independence or indemnity be
tween Cuba and Spain may be arbitrated,
but the right of Spain to transfer the
island to some European power will not
be. On this hemisphere the United States
is to be supreme, and Europe is not to be
here at all. To that extent the country
will support the administration against
all foreign cowers, and will deal with the
deficit tariff and bond syndicates as mat
ters of strictly home politics.
KINDS OP MILLIONAIRES.
Tne death of the man llippey, who shot
and tried to kill J. W. Mackay a year or
two ago, and who for the offense was con
victed of Bimple assault and sentenced to
a short term of imprisonment in the
County Jail, has brought to light a story
to the effect that Mr. Mackay had made
arrangement* to live in California and
employ his great fortune in the develop
ment of the State's resources, but that he
abandoned the idea in disgust when a
jury of intelligent citizens brought in a
verdict so manifestly unjust, and deter
mined to employ his great wealth in spme
country where elementary justice is better
understood and more impartially admin
istered.
"With the merits of that case The Call
has nothing to do. If it is true that its
determination decided a man of Mr.
Mackay's wealth, industry and public
spirit to withdraw from California the
exercise of the power which we might
have employed for its advancement the
State has suffered a grievous misfortune,
and that is something which every good
citizen will deplore, even though we may
be able to outlive it. But if that verdict
was unjust it did not represent the spirit
of the people, and it would be unfair on
the part of Mr. MacKay to charge it to the
intelligence, wisdom and justice of Cali
fornia.
It is a significant fact that the million
aire who has not made his fortune by
grinding the poor or setting trap 3 for the
avaricious and unwary, and who employs
his fortune in great industries which
afford sustenance to thousands and de
velop those natural resources from which
the people draw their living, need have no
fear of an assassin's bullet or of an unjust
verdict if a crank, attracted by his promi
nence, assaults trim. It is tne nature of
things that strength, of whatever kind,
employed for the benefit of the race,
makes a popular idol of its possessor.
Money is one of the most tangible of all
forms of power, and its wise use brings as
many blessings to its owner as to its bene
ficiaries.
The people have an instinct of selection
that is as potent as their appreciation and
gratitude. As every man who is very rich
must be weil known, each one of them has
his proper standing in the popular esti
mation; each has been tried by his own
deeds, and the estimate of him is founded
on a sense of common human justice.
The people of California know all their
great millionaires; know how these im
mense fortunes were made and how they
are employed; know whether this em
ployment works a general benefit and has
a foundation in right conduct, and stand
as ready to reward as to punish. No man,
however rich, is above the operation of
this human pressure, and it is only the
wise use of wealth that brings its pos
sessor the finest and most lasting benefit.
A BOSTON OPINION.
It has been customary for the advocates
of the gold Btandard to assert that the
movement for the remonetization of silver
is confined to the West, and has no sup
port whatever among the intelligent
classes of the East. This assertion, though
unfounded in fact, has been so often re
peated that many persons have accepted
it as truth, and it is worth noting, there
fore, that even in Boston itself an in
fluential class of citizens is opposed to the
retirement of greenbacks, even if the
drain on the treasury should be such as to
compel a resort to payments in silver.
A clear declaration to that effect is
found in the report of a committee
appointed by the Massachusetts State
Board of Trade to consider certain
financial resolutions offered by the Mer
chants' Association of Boston last De
cember. The report declares "it would
not be policy for the United States treas
ury to redeem their notes outstanding in
gold, that it would not be policy to issue
gold-bearing bonds in payment thereof."
After an exhaustive review of the condi
tion of our finances as a basis for argu
ments to sustain the conclusion reached,
the committee says:
Does any merchant believe that It is wiser to
withdraw non-interest-bearing notes and re
place them with those bearing interest? Would
any bank withdraw its circulation, destroy its
notes and remain in business? If the bankers
of this country attempt to emulate the "syndi
cate," and draw blood money from the Govern
ment, and otherwise embarrass it, it should be
our duty, and we hope the pleasure of the
Treasurer, to pay every demand in silver dol
lars, and the country would sustain him.
It appears from the summary of the pro
ceedings of the meeting given in the Boston
Journal that the report of the committee
was not altogether pleasing and several
speeches were made against it with the re
sult that the report was tabled. It there
fore cannot be taken as the opinion of the
Massachusetts State Board of Trade. We
may be sure, however, that those who
wrote tho report are not the only solid
men of Boston who hold the views it so
tersely declares. There is not so much
difference evidently between Eastern and
Western sentiment as some people would
have us believe, and the Boston committee
was in thorough accord with the people of
the Pacific Coast in saying that under the
conditions named it should be our duty to
pay every claim against the Government in
silver dollars.
The cooking school maintained at the
Atlanta Exposition by the State develop
ment committee, in which lessons and
lectures on the art oi cooking the food
products of California were given, has re
sulted in a largely increased demand for
our dried fruits from States where they
were scarcely known before. Through the
eagerness of customers to purchase, the
merchants of Atlanta are now compelled
to keep in stock all varieties of California
dried and canned fruits.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
One of the best known naturalists of the
Pacific Coast is George W. Dunn, for well onto
fifty yoars engaged in hunting and collecting
specimens. The range of his investigations
has been from the British line to Panama.
He has discovered a number oi new speci
mens of insect life. Mr. Dunn, who is now 82
years old, recently Bpent some time in the
Sierras near Truckee. He went to get conifera
Beeds, rare lily bulbs and butterfly tulips. He
collected largely on Castle Peak, in the Sierras,
which is over 9000 feet high.
Since the naturalist got back he has been
searching among the gray sand dunes for
curious bugs and insects of various kinds. He
6ays the average person has no conception of
the colonies of millions on millions of wonder
fully constructed and beautifully colored in
sects to be uncovered in these waste places.
They are worth good sums of money, too, when
caught and forwarded to different scientists of
the country. The naturalist said yesterday :
"Perhaps the most cheerless and altogether
gloomy view that wo anywhere behold is in
George W. Dunn, the Octogenarian Naturalist Who lias Found Strange Colonies
in the Sand Dunes.
[Sketched by a "Call" artist]
the vast fields of ever-drifting sands that are
so abundant everywhere along the ocean shore.
They show no signs of animal lite, and only
now and then in some depression or where
there is a little moisture a little stunted vege
tation may be seen.
"Yet the same dreary place is full of animal
life. The insects are nearly always hidden in
the sand, and are only seen running about
when the wind has blown them from their hid
ing-places in the loose sand. There are many
different families of insects living in harmony
there. By brushing your hand through the
sand you expose many to view, and all will
commence t,o hide themselves again as soon as
they find themselves uncovered.
"They spend their whole lives covered with
sand. They lay their eggs, the young are
hatched, and the larvae or young live in the
same place. Some are carniverous, others live
on vegetation. The most conspicuous insect
found always in the sand is the beautiful His
ter sellatus, which is colored with bright-red
and black markings, the red resembling a sad
dle, and thus taking its specific name.
"By making a sweep through the sand with
your hand eereral are brought to view, always
folding their legs against their body and lying
still for gome time as though dead. Later
they commence to bury themselves again in
the sand.
"Another very pretty insect, of a shiningblack
color, is the Hister sexstriatus. It lives in the
sand with the other insects of the same habits.
There are many others, none very large, but
among them one curiously marked Curculio, or
snout beetle, the Trigonoscuta pilosa, of the
same family as the Curculio, which is so de
structive to the plums.
"The most curious of all is the Cicindela,
or tiger beetle, bo named from its
voracious habits. Their curious mark
ings resemble a tiger. The young ones
live iv the sand, while the mature insect
may be seen on any Bunny day running about
on the sand and capturing and devouring acy
insect smaller than itself. They are very shy,
and not easily taken. One must have a net to
take them with facility. They lay their eggs
in the damp sand, and they are hatched there,
the young making a hole in the damp sand
and remaining there, with their head just
even with the surface of the ground.
"In that position they capture any small in
sect that comes near enough for them to seize
with their sharp jaws, and then drop down in
the hole and eat their prey at their leisure.
'The Cicindela hirticollis, or hairy-necked
beetle, Is another species that may be seen on
almost any sunny day in the sand of the dunes.
The young of the tiger beetle, or larvae, is hide
ous in appearance. It has a very large head,
with very large jaws armed with teeth on the
inside, with a. large hump on its back which
ends in a movable hook, which aids it in
climbing up its deep hole to near the top, when
it always lies in wait for some insect. They
are so pugnacious that if you thrust a straw
in the hole they will seize it and bang on till
they suffer themselves to be drawn out. Many
others could be mentioned which live together
in seeming harmony, but of many diSerent
families."
THE NEW DIXIE.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
UTILIZING THE TIDES.
A San Francisco Engineer Feels
Confident That It Can Be Done.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
An item has recently been published regard
ing a "wave motor" now building at Capitola,
Monterey Bay, which I hopeâ though do not
believeâ may be a success.
However, whatever result may be achieved
by this or other wave motors, there can ba no
shadow of a doubt that "current motors" fur
nish the cheapest power in the universe.
It has been a matter of wonder for a quarter
of a century iast past that the superb current
power of San Francisco heads has been allowed
to waste its potentiality for human services.
Being a practical civil engineer, acquainted
with the mechanical branch as well, serving
for years as shipmaster, surfman and wrecker,
having held a license as "pilot from San Fran
cisco to sea and return, lf I think myself enti
tled to express my long-settled conviction that
the daily waste of the hundreds of thousands
of horsepower, which could be 60 easily har
nessed, is little less than sacrilegious on the
part of San Francisco.
The waves are uncertain, coy at times, and
hard to harness always; while, on the con
trary, the tides are as regular as the stars in
their course and easily controlled.
Any navigator who knows the giant force
and the resistless rush of the outpour from
our great system of bays and tributary rivers
will agree with me aH to the power, and any
capable and "new style" mechanical con
structor â¢will as readily'consent, I am positive,
to the ease of conversion of said power into ac
! tion for the good of mankind upon an hour's
! consultation thereon.
I have made a success of several of the inven-
I tionsof Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt (whose son
i I have the honor to be), and as well succeeded
| With inventions of my own. My whole life has
! oeen a sdries of hard, practical contests with
! Nature's groat forces. I simply state these
| facts to establish my "right to the floor," and
I defy any 40-year-old man to show as thorough
all-round training for such a matter as "har
nessing the tides of San Francisco heads" as I
can prove.
If provided wijh proper backing, I would
stake my life, if that were allowable, on pro
ducing a comparatively cheap and wholly effi
cient "cunent motor" that would give my na
tive City of San Francisco the pre-eminence of
the Pacific as a manufacturing center. Very
respectfully, Edward A. yon Schmidt.

MATRIMONY.
A very old man, nearly 90 years of age, be
ing asked what he had done to live so long an-
swered: "When I could sit I never stood. I
married late, was a widower soon and never
married again." But a learned Bishop, who
was married four times, thought differently,
for he was so well pleased with his matrimon
ial ventures that he placed this motto on the
wedding-ring of his four th marriage :
"If I survive,
I'll make it five."
âLife.
TO CHRISTEN THE KENTUCKY.
The honor of christening the new battleship
Kentucky lias been bestowed by Secretary ller
bert on Miss llarriotte B. Richardsou. Miss
Richardson is a resident of Lexington and is
considered as one of the most beautiful belles
of the Blue Grass State. She is 5 feet 5 inches
tall, of superb form, has hair of a light brown,
gray eyes, aquiline nose, a beautiful mouth
:uid pretty teeth. Her manner is charming.
She is a brilliant convorsatioualist and a most
attentive listener. Her father, William Hall
Richardson, Is the son of Marcus Richardson,
whose father was Captain William Hall Rich
ardson of. Revolutionary fame. Her mother
was Miss Jane Shore Stamps, who was one of
Bourbon County's most noted beauties and a
daughter of Captain Thomas Stamps, a near
relative of Jefferson Davis.
Miss Richardson was born and raised within
a few miles of Lexington, on her father's beau
tiful blue-grass estate, Elk Hill, which adjoins
the famous Dixiana Farm, where Major B. G.
Thomas, the oldest breeder of thoroughbreds
in America, raised all the horses that have
made his name famous from one end of the
country to the other. Miss Richardson was a
great pet of the oid Major when she was a
little girl, and she has often ridden King Ban
Fellow craft, Himyar and other noted horses
MISS HARRIETTE B. RICHARDSON.
that have made their home at Dixiana. She is
one of the best horsewomen in Kentucky, and
it is her boast that she cau ride any horse that
any man can ride. She is fond of outdoor
sporta, and is one of the best rifle shots in the
State. She does not belong to the "new
woman" cotorie, but believes that woman's
sphere is home, and that her highest aim
ought to be to make man happy.
A Lexington correspondent of the New York
world tells how Miss Richardson came to be
selected to christen the big fighting ship. Her
sister is the wife of Colonel James K. Forney
of the United States Marine Corps, and the two
sisters have received much social attention in
Washington, New York and Brooklyn. Misa
Richardson is an acquaintance of Secretary
Herbert, and when Congressman Bennett of
Brooklyn gave a little impromptu supper at
the Shoreham after the opera tru over, the
Secretary proposed to Miss llichardson that
she christen the new battleship Kentucky. She
accepted the proposition, but itisisted that it
would be the proper thing to break a bottle of
old Bourbon over her prow instead of the;
usual bottle of champagne. The Secretary saw
the good taste in this, and immediately agreed
to allow Mi.ss Richardson to have her own way
about the matter. Therefore, instead of cham
pagne, a bottle of forty-five-year-old Bourbon
whisky from the cellars of Major B. G. Thomas
will be broken over the Kentucky's bow.

LADY'S CAPE.
The shape of the cape shown here is circular,
the kind that is so easily made and takes so
little material. The outside and lining aro
cut exactly alike, basted together face to face,
stitched together all around excepting at the
neck. It is then turnei over and pressed on
the edges and the cape is done, but for the
neck-finishing. This is simply a straight band,
over which is sown the ruche, either of ribbon
triple box-pleated, net with ribbons stitched
on it, also box-pleated, or of chiffon, four
3-inch wide pieces being doubled and gath
ered very full to the neckband.
A cape of brown velvet, edged all around
with a fringe of sable, had a 4-inch strip
of velvet pleated into the neck, the top edged
with the sable. This was worn over a longer
cape of brown cloth, which made at once a
warm and dressy wrap.
A cape of green velvet after this model was
edged "with Persian lamb fur and worn over a
black cloth cape. Such a wrap is delightful for
the theater, where the heavy plain cloth cape
can be laid aside and the rich top worn. Then,
also, it makes a complete garment of itself for
milder days and affords an easy and com
paratively cheap way of remodeling a plain
cape. It also makes it possible at little ex
pense to have a dressy wrap and a plain one,
if the cloth cape be provided with a separata
ruffle collar for morning wear. Black velvet is
oiten chosen for these capes. A lace collar or.
points of lace are much used lor trimming
with edges of sable.

BROKE THE TOBACCO TRUST..
Tobacco Manufacturers Losing Ten
Millions a Year.
Great Excitement in St. Louisâ No Pos-
sibility of Preventing Still
Greater Loss in '96.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 21.â Colonel Wm. Kir-
choff, General Western Manager of the
American Tobacco Company, has been a
user of tobacco all his life, and for years
lias smoked as many as twenty cigars
daily. After using a few boxes of Xo-To-
Bac the desire for tobacco is completely
gone and he is wonderfully improved in
health. His cure is attracting a great
deal of attention and comment, and many
prominent St. Louis business men are fol-
lowing his example. People are just
waking up to the fact that the continued
use of tobacco is very injurious.
An interview with Mr. H. L. Kramer
the originator of Xo-To-Bac, develops the
fact that within three years it has reaohed
an enormous sale, almost entirely upon
merit alone. Over 1,000,000 boxes'of No-
To-Bac have been sold and 300,000 tobacco-
users cured. At the present rate Xo-To-
Bac will cure in '96 from 200,000 to 300,000
and, as Mr. Kramer says: "It is always thÂ«
worst cases that want a cure â those vho
have chewed and smoked from boyhood
some of them thirty, forty and fifty years!
and we even have records of cures after
sixty years of tobacco-usine. So you can
see that, if they are spending an average
of $50 a year (this i 3 a small amount), the
cure of 200,000 tobacco-users in '96 would
result in the loss of tne sale of tobacco
amounting to over $10,000,000, which wil
be saved to the cured."
No-To-Bac is truly a medical wonder, for 4
it not only destroys the desire for tobacco
but invigorates the nervous system and
marvelously increases weight and strength.
Like all great successes, Xo-To-Bac has
many imitations and substitutes, and the
public should be warned against them.
No-To-Bac is the original tobacco-habit
cure, and is sold underan absolute guaran-
tee to cure the tobacco habit by your own
druggist.

ALONG THE WATER FRONT
The Officers of the Steamer Coptic
Blew Up a Derelict at
Sea.
TROUBLE ON THE M'NEAR.
Louis Williams Lost Overboard From
the Schooner James A.
Garfield.
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Company's steamer Coptic arrived from
Honpkong via Yokohama and Honolulu a
day ahead of time. She made the run from
the Hawaiian Kingdom to this port in 5
days 17 hours, beating the best previous
record. At Honolulu 1350 tons of cargo, 360
Chinese and 270 Japanese were discharged
in fifteen hours and the steamer was ready
to sail six hours before her advertised time.
The Coptic only brought 35 cabin pas
sengers and 65 Chinese and 3 Japanese for
San Francisco. Among the former was J.
Rernusat, an attache of the French con
sulate at Shanghai.
About the only excitement of the run of
the Coptic from Hongkong was the blow
ing up of a derelict. In the China Sea the
hulk wa3 sighted, and the caDtain of the
ocean liner thought it dangerous. A boat
was called away, and when the steamer
had come to a stop Chief Officer Seal by
was instructed to go and blow up the
derelict. On closer examination it was
found to be the remains of a three-masted
wooden ship, but there was nothing to
show its name or nationality. A charge
of dynamite was lowered into the hold, a
train was laid by the men, and when
Olticer Sealby fired it everybody pulled for
their lives. A few seconds later there was
a dull exi>tosion, a small fountain of water
sprang into the air, and when it subsided
the derelict was gone.
The bark McXear, which arrived from
Departure Bay yesterday, had a lively
time of it outside, and her owners are go
ing to have an equally interesting time in
port. From Pu et Sound it took the ves
sel thirty-four days to get to San Fran
cisco, and during that time she has been
in almost every storm that has raged
along the coast s-ince !aH December. She
was driven back again and again, and had
it not been for Captain Pederson the men
would have taken command and run the
vessel back to Port Town^end.
Now that the bark is safely in port there
is liable to be some litigation as to who
will control her. G. H. Thompson is the
managing; owner, but Captain Pederson
holds the controlling interest. The former
has chartered the vessel to R. D. Chandler

The British bark Sharpshooter, which
was wrecked in the Gulf of California and
towed here by the tug Fearless, was sold
at public auction yesterday by the United
States Marshal. Bidding was lively and
finally the hull was knocked down" to J.
Johnson for $2"260. It is. understood that
the purchase was for A. P. Lorentzen tfc
Co., and that the Sharpshooter will be re
fitted and put in the Hawaiian trade.
The schooner James A. Garrield from
Grays HarDor lost a man overboard during
the "gale that proved so disastrous to the
steamer >"oyo. It was in latitude 40 dec.
19 milt, north, longitude 125 deg. 15 mih.
west, and a heavy sea swept over the ves
sel and carried Louis Williams overboa 1.
An attempt was made to lower a boat, out
it was smashed into small pieces against
the schooner's side.
The cabin passengers by the steamer
Coptic were :
P. If. Blanchard, Dr. T. H. Clark, Mrs. G. M.

The steamer Czarina has put into Rio de
Janeiro with her machinery out of order.
She was purchased by the John D.
Spreckels Bros. Company to carry coai
from Marsh Held and was on her way here
from Pensacola, Fla.
Owing to the delay in getting papers
and the risk of seizure on their return to
port nearly all the American sealers will
go out under the British flac this season.
Among those now fitting out and which
will fly the Union Jack are the schooners
Emma it Louise, Lily L and Edward E.
Webster. Their owners say that they are
not going to risk seizure on their return to
port and be put in the same box as the
Bowhead and Sophie Sutherland.
MAY FOLLOW HIS FRIEND
The Confidential Man of Dr.
Robinson Is at Death's
Door.
Left a Fortune While Lying Seriously
111 in the Lane Hospital in
This City.
J. H. Redington, who was for years the
confidential man of Dr. Somerset Robin
son, the eccentric ex-naval surgeon who
recently died at Paso Robles, and who
comes in for a large share of the valuable
estate of the deceased, is on what will
probably prove his deathbed at the Lane
Hospital.
Dr. Robinson, who was well known in
naval circles for years past, was very much
averse to the presence of human beings
other than members of his own sex and
never permitted women to come near his
abode if he could avoid it.
After his retirement froni the service,
nine or ten years ago, he picked out two
men as companions for his declining years
who cherished the same feelings regarding
the gentler sex as himself, and these
formed his company and bodyguard to
prevent the incursions of prqdatory fe
males.
One of these was T. H. Redington, the
man who will hardly live to come into
possession of the fat legacy left him by his
late friend. Redington remained with
Dr. Robinson until about two months ago,
when a throat disease, that had been
making rapid inroads on his strength for
some time past, made it necessary for him
to seek a specialist for relief. He came to
tnis City and went to the Lane Hospital,
where he lias since been an inmace.
A recent operation deprived him of the
power of speech, and it is hardly believed
he will survive much longer.
Telegrams that came yesterday apprised
him of the fact that "his employer was
dead, and that be had been generously
remembered in the will.
The s .ock caused by the sad news
affected him seriously in his enfeebled
state, and the physicians at once pre
scribed absolute rest, and allowed no visi
tors to see him.

land.? She is reported to have left last Sunday.
The supposition is that she is fleeing from the
reach of subpenas to compel her to testify in
the suit against her mother which is low
pending before Judfre Belcher. Should she
have gone to Portland, she will be subpenaed
when the steamer arrives there, and held un
til she can be reached by the Sheriff of this
City.
TIN FOO'S GOOD NAME.
Postal Inspectors no Longer Suspect
Hira of Complicity "With Sam
Yick's Postoffice Larceny.
It is not likely that the postal inspec
tors will try to make a case against H. Tin
Foo, whom they arrested a few days ago
In the hope that he would enable them to
catch Sam Yick, the letter-thief. Sam
Yick has not yet been caught.
H. Tin Foo is one of the two presidents
of the Chinese Merchants' Association,
and stands very high among his people,
man in Ciiinatown believes that Tin
Foo had anything to do with the pilfering
of the letters ol Fung Hai & Co., Tsue
ChongWing Mon Kee' & Co., and Chong
Ying Lung & Co., and Postal Inspector
Munro also stated yesterday that he
thought Tin Foo did not have anything to
do with the Postoftice larceny.
Tin Foo's explanation that he was not
aware of Sam Yick's crookedness se- ms to
have been quite satisfactory. The inspec
tors were working at considerable disad
vantage in this affair owing to the talka-

AYRES ON HIS WAY EAST
The Wheeler & Wilson Agent Is
Supposed to Be Going to
Bridgeport.
He Owes Nearly $20,000, and His
Property at the Local Store
Has Been Attached.
Alvin D. Ayres, general Pacific Coast
agent of the Wheeler & Wilson Sewing
Machine Company, failed to report at his
office, 1368 Market street, yesterday, and
the place has been attached.
The story of Mr. Ayres' disappearance
was told in yesterday's Call, but there
was an intimation that the man might
possibly be on hana in the morning with
$19,990 to liquidate his indebtedness to the
company. He did not appear, however,
and the Sheriff has a deputy in charge of
all those goods which the missing man
might c aim as his own.
Mr. Dunne, tne bookkeeper of the
Whepler it Wilson Company, is adverse to
eoing into details as to Mr. Ayres' short
comings, as he is only temporarily at the
head of the local concern, and unless he is
instructed by the niiiin office at Bridge
port, Conn., he will not talk of the ac
counts.
However, he felt he could say that Mr.
Ayres had left the City and neither he nor
Mrs. Ayres knew where Mr. Avers had
gone. He did not doubt that the" missing
man had started for the East, and that lie
might be on his way to Bridgeport,
Conn., to straighten out his affairs with
the home office.
Mr. Ayres 1 position in this City was
mainly that of a buyer oE poods, at bed
rock prices, from the Wheeler & Wilson
Company. He ran into that company's
debt through elsewhere purchasing ma
chines for making buttonholes. The ma
chines he sold on the installment plan,
and lately, during the business depression
he found it difficult to make collections. '
IS HE INSANE?
Samuel B. Thompson, the Aged News-
dealer. Slakes Things Lively In
the Receiving Hospital.
Samuel B. Thompson, the aged news
dealer, who was held by Judge Conlan on
Monday to answer before the Superior
Court on three charges of felonious as
sault, was placed in one of the steel tanks
at the Receiving Hospital to await his
preliminary examination on other charges
Last evening he became so violent that
his hands were manacled behind his back.
Thompson had distinguished several times
by releasing himself when strapped in his
cell in the City Prison, but he found the
steel handcuffs beyond his power.
He appeared determined to do some mis
chief, and by contorting his body he suc
ceeded in wrigtrling his legs through his
locked arms, which brought the handcuffs
in front instead of behind. The only
thing in the cell he could tamper with was
trie water-pipe. He tore his clothing in
shreds and then broke the pipe. The
water poured into the cell and the noise
attracted the attention of the attaches of
the hospital. The flow of water was
stopped and Thompson was dragged out
of the. steel cell and placed in a padded
one. . A suit of old clothes was procured
and he was marie to don it. He remarked
that it was the first bath he nad had for a
lonir time.
Wlieii he was held to answer on Monday
his attorneys stated that they would have
him taken before the Insanity Commis
sioners, as they believed he was insane;
and Thompson is doing everything possi
ble to confirm that belief.
Pace Has Returned.
Detective Anthony arrived in the City last
night from New York with J. L>. Pape, ex-
Pistrirt Attorney, who was indicted by the
Grand Jury for embezzling $4342 belonging to
Lewis Lichtinger, an insane ward. Page on
being asked at the City Prison if he had any
statement to make, replied in the negative.
WAS ALMOST ENGULFED.
The Steamer Noyo Caught in
Last Sunday Night's
Southeaster.
LIFEBELTS WEEE DISTRIBUTED.
Very Few of the Passengers Ever
Expected to Reach Land
Again Alive.
The gale of Sunday night raged along
tbe coast and in consequence all the ex
pected steamers and sailing vessels are
overdue. The Walla Walla from Puget
Sound ports was twelve hours behind time
lost night and the Noyo was tiouble her
usual time in making the run from Fort
Bragg.
Very few captains who have arrived dur-
ing the last few weeks have a more thrill
ing experience to tell than Captain Levin
son of the Noyo. The steamer was caught
in the southeaster, part, of her deck load of
lumber was washed away, the remaining
100,000 feet was jettisoned, the waves took
command of the vessel and the engine
room was flooded. The fires under the
boilers were drowned out and the pas
sengers were told to get lifebelts. Just
when things were at their worst the steam
schooner Albion hove in sight and pave
renewed hope to the crew. She remained
alongside of the disabled craft for twelve
hours and then stood on her way.
The Noyo was out from Fort Braeg thirty
six hours when caught in the gale
off Point Arena. She had on board the
following passengers: Harry Witberg and
wife, J. J. Mcllison, A. Olnes. Mrs. Baul
leud, E. Olsen, D. Dondon, George Don
dero, E. Meach, J. Blain, John Ketchum,
J. Brown, P. Everson, Miss G. Goldech,
Mrs. Steoferd, Harry Height, Miss B.
Kimball, Mrs. Campbell and Fred White.
No*, one of them was hurt, and the only
person on board who bears any trace of
the hurricane is Purser Littlejohn, who
was struck on the head by a piece of flying
lumber.
In telling about the storm yesterday
Captain Levinson said: "When the
steamer left Fort Bragg a heavy sea was
running, but we thougnt nothing of that,
and all Sunday morning we made fair
time. Sunday afternoon the wind began
to increase until at midnight it was blow
ing a Hurricane. Some of our deckload
was washed away, and I ordered tiie re
mainder jettisoned in order to save the
vessel. The fires in the engine-room were
drownca out, and. as our position seemed
desperate, I ordered the passengers called
and told them to get on lifebelts. The
crew behaved splendidly, and never
shirked obeying an order, even though it
was at the risk of their lives. In the
morning the storm abated somewhat, and
the Albion stood by us until we got our
fires relit and were once more under
steam."
"It was an awful voyage," said one of
the passengers. "The waves carried' away
part of the decKload, but it was not enough
to help the steamer. Then a huge wave
came along nnd flooded everything. The
tires under the boilers went out and in a
few moments the Noyo was helpless.
Captain Levinson ordered the decldoad
thrown overboard, and while this was
being done a piece of lumber flew out of
the hands of two of the men and a splinter
from it struck Purser Littlejohn in the
forehead.
"Captain Levinson managed to put trie
vessel about, but the attempt to set Bail
was a failure, as no canvas could with
stand the force of the gale. It ;vas then
that all the passengers were warned and
we started out to get lifebelts on. Some
oi the women and children were too sea
sick to move and they had to be helped
into places of safety. During the wboie
dreadful time Captain Levinson never lost
his bead, and directly the Albion was
sighted ne flew signals of distress. She
came within hailing distance and Captain
Lundquist said he would stay by us. He
did so until the gale went down and onr
men were able to pump out the engine
room and get tire under the boilers.
Then we came on to San Francisco and
arrived yesterday morning."
The Novo does not seem to be much the
worse for the gale she went through, but
shipping men say that the escape of both
vessel and all on board was little short of
miraculous.
GAME-DEALERS FINED.
Three of the Men Arrested for Selling
Wild Ducks Pleaded Guilty.
Judge Joachimsen was very lenient with
the men who were arrested for selling
came out of season. Three of the game
law offenders pleaded guilty yesterday and
were lined $5 each. Their names are, E.
Paolini, A. Boldachi and Philip Laurel.
It was stated tnat the dealers in panic
intend to continue in the business of buy
ing and selling: birds, but as Game Warden
Mocan has his war paint on it is presumed
he will continue to arrest all those who
transgress the game law. The season for
the sale of wild ducka and quail enaed on
the 15th inst.
A large consignment of wild ducks,
which were shipped from Clarksburg a
few days ago to a commission merchant,
arrived in very poor condition, and as a
consequence the lot, consisting of mallards
and canvasbacks, was dumped into the
bay.
Barney* Mining Claims.
Alfred 8. Barney is suing Daniel Murphy,
H. Brown, John Apple and F. Monaghan for an
accounting of some mining property and for
$50,000 damages. He claims he purchased
from them for $27,000 some mining claims in
the El Dorado region in Lincoln County, Nov.,
under certain conditions of payment. He de
veloped the mines at once, and before he had
paid for them tney were worth $250,000. The
defendants, he says, upon learning this, took
forcible possession, and now he is suing to
have them ejectia, for an accounting and for
damages.

MAKING A SHORT CUT
Judge McKenna Finds a Neat
Way Out of a Di
lemma.
He Admits the Entire Pattison Re
port as Evidence in the
Railroad Suit.
Judge McKenna decided yesterday
morning to consider as read all the report
of the Pattison committee, the reading of
which would take up nearly a whole
month in the injunction suit brought by
the railroad company against the Railroad
Commissioners to prevent the latter from
reducing freight rates.
Ex- Judge Hayne, for the Commissioners,
argued on Monday last that the railroad
attorneys were pleased with the delay in
trying the case by having the 1500 pages
of the report read, simply that they felt
strong in the fact that they had been
granted a restraining order, which, he in
timated, would be more pleasing still if
the reading could be continued ad infini
tum.
The court believed that counsel on either
side could decide on those parts of the
voluminous report which would be neces
sary in the arguments and that they could
be stipulated when the contestants would
come together again on February 3.
Ttie decision of the court, to all appear
ance, is satisfactory to all concerned. At
torney Herrin, in his arguments to date,
has held that lie believed speedier proeress
could be made by not wading through a
lot of testimony that could have no bear
ing on the issues. He believed that it
would have been better to get up pleading
and to have proceeded to the taking of
testimony. This, he claimed, wouia have
brought forth a final decree even sooner
than a decision could possibly be had in a
preliminary injunction.
Between this date and February 3it is
expected that the factions represented will
be able to present their arguments, picking
out those portions of the report material
in the case at issue.
NEW PATROL WAGONS.
Two Covered Vehicles Similar to Those
In Use in New York to Be
Recommended.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners to-night Commissioner Gunst will
submit for the inspection and considera
tion of the board photographic views he
has just received from New York of the
patrol wagon in use there by the Police De
partment. The views are three in number.
One shows the wagon from a side view, and
the other two the rearâ one with the seats
in position and the other with stretcher in
use.
The wagon is much lighter than those
now in use here, and it serves also the pur
pose of an ambulance. The seats can be
lowered when necessary and a swinging
stretcher placed in the body of the wagon
so that the patient is freed from the annoy
ance and inconvenience of jolting.
Another advantage the wagon possesses
is in having a roof over it with covers
front and rear, which are kept in a roll on
top, and are lowered during rainy weather.
Two new patrol wagons are required for
the new stations, and if it is decided to
purchase two vehicles similar to those in
New York, one will be placed for use at
the Central police station and the other
probably at the California-street station.
The use of covered patrol wagons has
been recommended by Chief Crowley in
his annual reports for years back.
The S. F. and N. P. Election Postponed.
By consent of all persons interested the elec
tion of officers by the stockholders of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad' Com
pany, which had been set for yesterday, was
postponed until February 11, three weeks
hence, to await the outcome of the legal pro
ceedings now pendinar in the Marin County
Superior Court Wore T udge Angelotti.
FIRE ALARMS COME HIGH
Extramen Complain of the
Charges Made for "Clarke
Gongs."
THE CITY'S POLES AEE USED.
How a Private Enterprise Is Conducted
Partly at the Expense of San
Francisco.
Occasionally the worm turns and wants
to krjow why ana wherefore.
This is the case with the firemen who
are being charged $2 a month each for
gongs which have been put in their homes
to fill the place of the big fire bells on the
engine-houses, which in many cases have
been removed.
Extramen who are connected with the
Fire Department are not as a rule expected
to sleep in the engine-house of the dis
trict in which they belong, and conse
quently stay at their own houses.
Aa a great many of the 800-pound bells
have been removed from the towers lately,
it has been necessary for the extramen to
put private tapoers in their homes, so
as to be warned in case of fire. For these
tappers, which are known as the "Clarke
gongs," the firemen are compelled to pay
$2 per month or probably lose their job
through failure to hear a fire alarm. In
the event of a hit;h wind or stormy weather
the whistle alarms are frequently of no
value, and consequently private alarms
are essential to the preservation of the
extraman's job. He simply has to put
them in or run the risk tnat follows failure
to appear at tires in his district. The non
arrival of a fireman when ne is wanted,
generally results in his being "broke," to
use the term that means dismissal among
liremen.
Chief Sullivan, interviewed yesterday
regarding the matter, said:
"1 regard the charge of $2 per month as
very high, and have always thought that
$1 would be enough. Extramen make only
135 per month out of their positions, and
they should not be expected to give up
such a proportion of their earnings to be
called to fires.
"In a great many cities of smaller popu
lation there are fully paid fire depart
ments, and extramen are done away with
altogether, but here we have them still,
and the City should pay for the electrical
service necessary to warn them of fires.
Of course the ."-team whistles are valua
ble, but if firemen want tappers they should
have them, and the charges should be rea
sonable. lam not over-familiar with the
matter and would suggest that you see
Mr. Clarke, who is the gentleman who puts
in these tappers or gongs for the firemen
who want them.''
"Does Mr. Clarke use the City's poles for
his wires?"
'â¢I do not know ; but it is probable that
he does."
"Has he any right to use them?"
"Well, not to any great extent, that I
can see, unless he has a franchise. But
you had better see him about it. He will
have no hesitancy in giving you all the j
information you want, as he has been in
the business a great many years."'
Later :n the day Mr. Clarke was visited
at his office in the telephone building, and
in answer to the question of whether or
not he had a franchise to use the City's
poles, he admitted that he had not.
l> Do you find it necessary to use the
poles of the City to run wires into the
homes of the firemen who are compelled
to \ise your gongs?"
"Occasionally; but as a rule I run them
over the housetops, as most of the extra
men live on the side streets, and there are
no poles tnere that it would be possible to
use."
"It is claimed by a great many firemen
that private citizens use the gongs, and
that the City's poles are used to rnn tne
wires. Is there any truth in that?"
"Well, I have a few subscribers outside
of the liremen, and whenever I find it
necessary to use the poles of the City I use
them. But that is not often."
There is a great deal of complaint among
the firemen of San Francisco over this
gong service and the charges are bitterly
complained of.
The firemen claim that Mr. Clarke's en
terprise is conducted as far as possible .on
the poles of the City and that if he had not
the use of them the Fire Department
would have to make some provision for
calling the firemen together in case of fire.
Chief Sullivan is of the opinion that the
City ought to have control orall such mat
ters and that the loVest possible rates
should be given the firemen who are com
pelled to use gongs in their houses.
The most general complaint is that if
Mr. Clarke is utilizing the City's poles to
conduct a private enterprise he ought to
be in a position to give a lower rate to the
men who are forced to do business with
him.
The Fnlding-Bed Closed.
Tne Supreme Court has reversed the ruling
of the Superior Court in the case of Grace
Lewis against Joseph T. Terry. The suit was
for damages for injuries sustained by the
plaintiff by the collapse of a foldine-bed pur
chased from the defendant. The folding-bed
was purchased from Terry by a third party,
from whom the plaintiff rented a room con
taining the aforesaid folding-bed. The
bed closed down on her arm one even
ing and broke it, and she sued Terry, the
one who sold the bed, for damages. The de
murrer was upon the ground that there was
no contract of sale between the plaiutiff and
the defendant, but the Supreme Court recog
nizes an implied contract on the part of the
salesman to sell folding-beds that are safe.
The demurrer is therefore overruled.

HOME DYES THAT ARE FAST.
Easy to Make Beautiful Colors With the
Reliable Diamond Dyes.
Scores of women in San Francisco are
to-day wearing dresses of fashionable color
that would have been thrown aside long
ago had it not been for Diamond Dyes.
With a 10-cent package of these simple
home dyes even the novice can dye a fast
and beautiful color equal to the work of
the professional dye-house.
Cloaks, capes and shawls are readily
dyed, so that a faded garment will look
as though it was right from the shop.
Out of the 50 different kinds of Diamond
Dyes 12 are special fast colors for cotton
and mixed goods that will not crock or
fade, even when washed in strong soap-
suds. These dyes are made from a pecu-
liar combination of dye stuffs, and cannot
be had except in the Diamond.
For over twenty years Diamond Dyes
have been the standard home dyes, and
have taken the place of crude dyestuffs
and unreliable package dyes in all parts of
the worjd. This marvelous success has
naturally inspired more or less worthless
imitations, sold to the trade at a less price,
and which a few. unscrupulous dealers
urge upon their customers. The only way
to insure success in home dyeing is to use
only the Diamond, the strongest, fastest
and most successful of all dyes.

G. A. HUBBELL TO
FATHER YORKE.
The A. P. A. Editor Writes
About the Oaths of
Bishops.
CLAIMS OF THE CHURCH.
Declarations Purporting to Have
Been Made by a Bishop of
Illinois.
CHINIQUY'S CASE SET FORTH
Rights of an Ex-Communicant of the
Catholic Church as Interpreted
by Mr. Hubbell.
The following communication has Deen
received by The Call from G. A. Ilubbell
<>i (he American Patriot:
San Francisco Callâ Deab Sir: The
mission of tbe Jesuits in the United States is
4ent upon the Roman Catholic Bishop.
The Bishop must in person every three or ten
years give account to the Holy â  <i â -â¢â¢
C. YÂ«.rte attempted to tret rid of the
including the Bishop's oath, taken by
this pagan system by saying they
were forgeries. To cite Dowling was a waste of
time.
We ask indulgence to produce the Bishop's
oath this time in Latin and English from a
Komnn Catholic sourceâ the Pontificale Ro
manura. The oath differs from the other only
i;i a very few unimportant phrases.
The Pontificate Romanura contains the Latin
(burled from the common people), the prayers,
readings and forms to be observed in various
ecclesiastical rites in which a Pontiff (Bishop)
officiates. It is issued by the order of the
Popes.
The oath is as follows:

PETER YORKE KNOCKED OUT.
The Subject-Matter of His Challenge Al
. -, ready Settled by an American
Court.
And Sworn to as Correct by a Roman Catholic
Bishop.
Editor American Patriotâ Dear Sir: While so
much dust is being stirred up by the fellow
whom Christ told to "get thee behind me
Satan," it may not be out of place to publish
the following for the benefit of your readers.
I see no good to be accomplished in the Rev.
Mr. Ross taking up the gauntlet thrown down
by Peter C. with a pull-back string attached to
it. The subject matters therein mentioned in
the challenge have already been proven to be
correct in statement before a legal court and
sworn in statement before a legal court and
>m to dv no less a person than a Roman
Catholic Bishop in authority, and are now a
matter of court record and there preserved
forever. '^- ; â¢â¢<â '
In 1882 a copy of the Knnkakee Times, pub
lished at Kankakee, Illinois, came to San Fran
cisco, whicn contained a communication over
the signature of Vox Populi. On learning
the name of the author of the communi
cation, a correspondence was opened with him,
and it was learned that he was un eminent
lawyer of that place, the Hon. Stephen R.
Moore, who also was Notary Public. In his
<>, whicn continued a communication over
signature of Vox Populi. On learning
name of the author of the communi
on, a correspondence was opened with him,
it was learned that he was an eminent
yer of that place, the Hon. Stephen R.
re, who also was Notary Public. In his
letters in reply, bearing date of May 15 and
June 3, ISSi. he said:
You ask, 4 *\Vhat Judge was upon the bench fit
the time the suit was brought (you mean trial)
when Bishop Foley was required to 'translate from
the works of St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Uguori?
Who were Chlnlquy's attorneys, etc.?" â¢
You ask me to give you the facts in regard to the
examination of Bishop Foley when we made him
make the translations. ,
We knew ilia: lie was the head of authority- of
the Church of Illinois. We knew, that he would
not dare deny the authority of the books as bind
log on the church. If .Mr. Chlniquy would swear
to the books being authority, it would be denied by.
all Catholics, when they could not deny it. when
the proof came from the Bishop.
We wanted to show, also, that it was authority
in the church to-day, as well as at the time they
were published. This could only be done by forc
ing the Bishop to Iâ¢ a witness. We knew he would
go away from the jurisdiction of the court, so he
could not be served with process, If lie knew what
we wanted. Our statute allows any person whether
ollicer or not, to serve ;* aubpena. We pot the
process, and In my possession on the evening be
fore the trial; and took the evening train for
â¢or not, to serve Â» subpena. We got the
ss. and In my possession ou the evening be
the trial, and 1 took the evening train for
Chicago, I found a friend in Chicago to go with
me. 1 knew that it' I sent up my. name he would
refuse to see me. My friend sent up his card, with
request to see the Bishop; This was about 9
o'clock at night. After a long delay, he CUM
to the library. He was much " astonished
when he saw me, and looked at his
card to assure himself that no mistake bad oc
curred. I introduced my friend, who politely read
the process, commanding him to appear upon the
next day at Kankakee and testify in the case, at
the same time tendering him his witness fees, be
ing 5 cents a mile and $1 for the clay's services.
Ho indignantly refused the money and declared he
would not attend, lie thought the courts h -d no
power over him. He recognized no authority but
the authority of the church. 1 assured him that
be must do as he thought beat; but he must take
the consequences. It would be a contest between
him and the court, and 1 had never seen the court
fail to enforce the orders of the court.
He sent for the attorney for his diocese, Hon. B.
O. Caulncld, and after the interview he had no
difficulty in concluding to obey the process the
court.
Judge Charles 11. Wood was on the bench, Judge
William usgood (formerly associate counsel with
.Lincoln and Paddock) and myself.
When Bishop Foley went on the witness-stand
we wanted Judge Osgooi to handle him, but be de
clined. I had my subject well In hand and was
quite familiar with the original, and after he made
a few attempts to evade me lie came down to the
work and made a good witness*. He never forgave
me for it, however. He really felt that h s high
position had been lowered. It was the first time
that any lawyer bad done such a thing. Â . .**
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servant, Stephen It. iiooHE.
The following is his communication referred
to, published in the Kankakee Times.
THE CHUKCH OF BOMB AND LIBERTY OF CON
SCIKKCE.
In one of your past issues you told your readers
that the Rev. Mr. Chiniquy had gained the long
and formidable lawsuit instituted by the Roman
Catholic Bishop to dispossess him and his people
of their church property. But you have not yet
given any particulars about (be startling revela
tions the Bishop had to make before the court in
reference to the still-existing laws of the Church of
Rome against those whom they call "heretics."
Nothing is more important for every one than to
know precisely what those laws are.
As I was present when the Roman Catholic
Bishop Foley of Chicago was ordered to read in
Latin and translate into Knglish those laws I have
kept a correct cony of them and I send it to you
with the request to publish it.
The Key. Mr. Chiniquy presented the works of
Saint Thomas and Saint Lttuori to the Bishop, re
questing him to say, under oath, if those works
were or were not among the highest theological
authorities in the church of Home all over the
world. After a long and serious opposition on the
part of the Bishop to answer, the court having said
he (the Bishop was bound to answer, the Bishop
confessed thai these theological works were looked
upon as among the highest authorities, and that
they were tnuxht and learned in all the colleges
end universities of Rome as standard works. Then
the Bishop was requested to read In Latin and
translate into English the following laws and
fundamental principles of action against the here
tics as explained by Saints Thomas and Uguori:
[We omit the Latin and give the translation by the
Bishop.
An excommunicated man is deprived of all civil
communication with the faithful id such â  way
that if he is not tolerated they can have no com
munication with him, as It Is in the following
verse:
â¢â¢It is forbidden to kiss him, pray with him,
salute him. to eat or do any business witti him.
[See uori. vo . IX, page 163.
'â¢Though heretics must not be tolerated because
they deserve It, we must bear them till, by a sec
ond admonition, they may bo brought back to the
faith of the church. But those who, after a second
admonition, remain obstinate In their errors, mast
not only he excommunicated but they must be de.
livered to the secular power to be exterminated.
â¢"Though the heretics who repent must always
be accepted to penance as often as they have fallen,
they must not, inconsequence of that, always be
permitted to enjoy the benefits of this life. â¢ * â¢
When they fall again they are admitted to repent,
but the sentence of ueath must not be removed.
(St. Thomas, vol. iv, pa^i 01.] .
"When a man is excommunicated for his
apostasy it follows from that very fact that all
those who are his subjects are released from the
oath of allegiance by which they were bound to
obey him." [.St. Thomas, vol. iv, page 94. J I
The next document of the church of Rome
brought before the court was the act of the Council
of Lateran, A.D. 1215. â â¢ââ â â â â 
" We excommunicate; and anathematize every
heresy that exalts itself against the holy, orthodox
and Catholic faith, condemning all heretics by
whatever name they may be knownâ for though
their (aces differ, they are tied together by their
tails. Such as are condemned are to be delivered
over to the secular powers, to receive due punish
ment. If laymen, their goods must be conrihcatea.
If priests, they shall be tirst degraded from their
respective orders and their property applied to the
use of the church in which they have officiated.
Secular powers of all ranks and degrees are to be
warned, induced, and if necessary, compelled- by
ecclesiastical censures to swear that they will
exert themselves to the utmost in the defense of
the faith, and extirpate all heretics denounced by
the church who shall be found in their territories.
And when any person shall assume government,
whether it be spiritual or temporal, he shall be
bound to abide by this decree.
" If any temporal lord, after having been ad
monished to clear his territory of heretical deprav
ity, the metropolitan and the bishops of th
province shall unite In excommunicating him
Should he remain contumacious a whole year, the
fact shall be signified to the Supreme Pontiff, who
will declare his vassals released from that tin
and will bestow his territory on Catholics, to be
occupied by them on the condition of exterminat
ing the heretics and preserving the said territory
In the faith. :
'â¢Catholics who shall assume the' cross for the ex
termination of heretics snail enjoy the same indul
gences and be protected by the same privileges as
are granted to those who go to the help of the Holy
.Land. We do decfee, further, that all who may
have dealings with heretics, and especially such as
receive, defend or encourage them, shall be ex
communicaied." "He shall not be eligible to any
public office. He shall not be admitted as a wit
ness. He shall neither have the power to be
queath his property by will nor succeed to any In
heritance. He shall not bring any action against
any person, but any one can bring an action
again.st him. Should he be a judge, his decision
shall have no force, nor shall any cause .be brought
before him. Should he be an advocate, he shall not
be allowed to plead, Should he be a lawyer, no in
struments made by him shall be held valid, but
shall be condemned with their author."
The Roman Catholic Bishop swore that these
laws had never been repealed, and that they were
still the laws of his church. He had to swear that
every year, he was .bound under pain of eternal
damnation, to say, in the pretence of God, and to
read in his Brevarinm (his prayer book) that "God
himself had inspired" what St.Thomas had writ
ten about the manner that heretics should be
treated by the Roman Catholics.
1 will abstain from making any remarks upon
these startling revelations of that Roman Catholic
high authority. But I think it is the duty of even
citizen to know what the Roman Catholic Bishops
and priests understand by liberty of conscience
The Roman Catholics are as interested as the
Protestants to know, precisely what the-teachinrs
of their church are on the subject of liberty and
conscience, and hear the exact truth as coming
from such a high authority that there Is no room
left for any doubt. v/. '. Vox Topoti.
As already stated, the Hon. Stephen Moore
of Kankakee, 111., the attorney for Rev. Charles
Chiniquy, was the author of the article signed
"Vox Pojmli," and it was the record of the
court as above given on December 30, 1880,
ana will be found on pages 070, 077 and 678
of Rev. C. Chiniquy's "Fifty Years in the
Church of Rome.", , : â¢ ->â  '

This will readily be seen is the authority and
text most closely followed by Peter C. Yorke
in his inhumations, and the proceedings of
the court at Kankakee, 111., with Bishop FoVey's j
evidence and translations, prove Peter's men

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1896.
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Some Matters of Interest Dis
cussed at Its Annual
Meeting.
THE FUNDING BILL SCORED.
Gist of Resolutions Passedâ Addresses
of the Retiring and Incoming
Presidents.
; Many of the City's merchant princes at
tended the annual meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon.
Among those present were: R. G. Sneath,
William L. Merry, A. Gerberding, George
Davidson, Louis Sloss Jr., L. H. Clement,
Hugh Craig, John L. Howard, Louis B.
Parrott, F. Chapman, Charles M. Yates,
A. B. Field, Arthur E. Towne, George A.
Newhall, Charles Nelson, F. W. Van Sick
len, 11. T. Scott, A. J. Ralston and others.
Ow;ng to the absence of President W.
H. Dimoiid in Southern California the
meeting was called to order by Mr. Craig,
I proceedings commencing with the reports
of the secretary and treasurer. Secretary
Clement reported that during the past
year three members of the chamber had
died, thirty had resigned and two had
been dropped from the roll. During the.
year 111 new members had been secured,
the total being now 384, as against 308 on
the Ist of January, 1895.
These reports being approved, the ad
dress of the retiring president, W. H. Di
mond, was read by the secretary. It was
! in part as follows:
Gentlemen of the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco: After two years of service as
presiding officer of your body and many years'
service as a trustee, in this, "my final report to
you as president, I may be pardoned for im
pressing upon you at this time my views re
j garding several important measures as yet not
consummated, but for which the Chamber Of
Commerce of this City has long and strenu
ously labored. â¢ â¢ â¢ â 
Recent developments at home and abroad
have brought to the front the importance of
the isthmian canal under American control.
The pamphlet on the subject .recently disiriD
uted by this chamber, the exact knowledge and
[ unquestioned eloquence of our members who
( have advocated the building of . this canal,
j leave practically nothing to add to the litera
ture on the subject.
One of our honored members anC Senators
â  from this State has already introduced a bill
I in the Senate, and is using his best endeavors
j to have a measure adopted by Congress that
will speedily bring about the "construction of
tnis most important waterway, considered
} either from a commercial or military stand
point. The measure, also urged by a member
of the House from this State, may become a
statute by legislation; although such crave
subjects are now before Congress this "vital
measure for the Pacific Coast is liable for the
time being to be laid aside.
Should that unfortunately be a fact this
chamber should redouble its* efforts to bring It
before the next Congress, never wearying of
the good work, but persisting until all obsta
cles are overcome and success crowns our
efforts. It may perhaps have escaped your
notice that a. hook entitled "The Key to the
Pacificâ the Nicaragua Canal," written by an
; eminent English engineer, calls attention to
the fact that Great Britain will lose and the
United States gain by its construction. Here
is an extract: \
â¢â¢Through the Suez canal England haÂ« at
present the advantage of the United States as
regards China, Japan and Australia by about
2700 miles. The Nicaragua canal made, the
Atlantic cities of the United States will be only
1000 miles farther from Hongkong and Centra;
China generally than Britain; 1200 to 1900
miles nearer the northern ports of China, Korea
and Japan; 2700 miles nearer the average of
the western ports of South America ; 1300 mil
nearer New Zealand. The canal will bring
New Orleans 1000 miles and the gulf ports
from 700 to 1000 miles nearer again than N.-
York. The canal will place the States in touch
with .".00, 000.000 people with whom at present
they have comparatively little intercourseâ
namely, the people of China, Japan, Korea,
Australia, Malaysia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru
and Chile.
"This means, of course, that the supremacy,
control, etc., we (the British) at present possess
in the trade of Eastern Asia and Australasia
Mil);b3 strongly attacked by the|United States."
Another important subject, to my mind, is
the development of interior water transporta
tion. On ttie-lth of November last the people
of the State of New York voted to expend
$9,000,000 to improve the canal system of the
Stateâ a system that for at least five months of
every year is locked in the icy grasp of the
Aictlc frosts. The millions expended by the
State have not only returned an Immense
profit In building up its manufactures, its
cities and townsâ giving cheap transportation
and making its farms valuableâ but returned
in actual cash, over and above first cost, inter
est and cost of maintenance, $10,000,000 net
profit since DeWitt Clinton declared the Erie
canal open to traffic.
[I there not a possibility of combining State
and private enterprise with the well-expended
but all too meager fund from the National
Government to tut our interior waterways in
a condition that will approximate the grand
system of rivers end canals in the Empire
State? There seems to be much food for
thought in this important subject, of interest
alike to the city merchants and the country
producer. This fact may be emphasized by
quoting the statement made public a few
months since, that in spite of Pittsburgh mag
nificent railroad facilities, 5,000.000 bushels,
or about 186,175 tons, of coal were shipped by
river late in the fall, requiring 57 towbouts
323 barges.and 70 flatboats to carry it.
The chamber during the past year has in
creased its usual expenditures by issuing the
Nicaragua pamphlet and by sending to the
Trans-Mississippi Congress able representatives
of California commercial worth. That the
money was well expended results prove, ana
the enterprise sho*n by this chamber in the
tmst in such direction should not be allowed to
flag. â 
The direction of the affairs of this body passes
into able hands, and in taking up the labor
the new board finds the organization finan
cially in a prosperous condition with an in
creased membership, unanimity and enthu
siasm among its members. True, death has
removed from our membership able and
earnest men. â¢
William Norris, William Steinhart and
Robert F. Bunker, all have gone where busi
ness cares cease to trouble. But our ranks have
been recruited with young and enthusiastic
San Franciscans, and the loss from our coun
cils of skilled and tried labor for the advance
ment of our City, State and coast must be made

and not found wanting, who for years have
been working for our mutual advancement.
. I cannot close without thanking my fellow

again calling attention to the unflagging, dis
interested labors of Senator Perkins at Wash

their gallant efforts to promote in Congress
the welfare of our State. To our secretary is
due the thanks of the trustees and the cham
ber for his efficient work, particularly his suc
cessfu. efforts to Increase the membership of
this body, which after deducting deaths and
resignations shows a net gain of seventy-six
members for the year, a result largely due to
his personal efforts, -.To the whole chamber
for the honor conferred in selecting me to pre

The following memorial to Congress was
next read: :^'viT:;t;V
To the Honorable Senate and House of. Represen
tatives in Congress Assembled.: Your memorial.
Ist, the Chamber of Commerce of San Fran-
Cisco, respectfully and urgently reiterates it
prayer to preceding sessions, of your august
organization for the speedy construction of th
Nicaraguan canal under control of the United
States Government, with such wise and con
servative provisions as shall secure low tolls
and freedom from discrimination to American
shipping. / , ; â  .-. â â¢.â -.. ..â ...-.-.
The American people nave no special inter
est in the technical details of construction
These should be agreed upon by the civil engi
neers, experts in the matter, who have given
years of study and careful examination of the
best methods to be adopted in overcoming th
obstacles which . nature has placed : before
them. It is enough for us to know that we are
fully warranted in the assertion that, above all
canal, routes between the great oceans, that
through Nicaragua offers the greatest induce
ments for construction and the least obstacle
to successful canalization. ;â¢/...â¢ ...â¢-. :;i
Neither is the cost a question "to be 'consid
ered by our people, provided it be limited to an
amount on which a moderate revenue will be
remunerative, a point on : which no hones
doubt Is entertained. The necessity for th
Nicaragua canal is | Imperative to our country
commercially; politically, and for the National
defense. It is a peaceable and effective asser
tion of the Monroe doctrine if built under the
control of the Government of the United States
and Nicaragua.
It is an abandonment of the Monroe doctrine
n permitted to be constructed and controlled
by any European power. Were a "referendum"
to the American people a possibility we are
confident ahe demand for "an American canal
under American control, 1 ' for the security of
American influence, prestige and prosperity,
would be practically unanimous.
The greatest statesmen of our country, irre
spective of party, are on record for the bene
ficent work which will be the crown of Ameri
can patriotism. The development of our com
merce, our industries, our international influ
ence, our political and military safety, all de
mand tne prompt construction of the Nicar
agua canal under the control of the United
States Government.
Confident that our Government will no
longer delay action on this great enterprise,
without which the Pacific Coast languishes in
an arrested development, we subscribe our
selves with high respect, your fellow-citizens,
The Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco.
A brief resolution was also read and ap
proved favoring the laying of a submarine
cable under American auspices to the
Sandwich Islands.
The following resolutions were passed
amid much applause:
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
ban Francisco, impressed with the advantages
of peace and comity between all nations, is
none the less convinced that a conservative
and honorable assertion of the National policy
oi self-protection is an absolute necessity to the
welfare of the republic and a duty to its citi
zens.
Resolved, That, having these principles in
view, this chamber cordially approves the
position of the President of the United States
on the Monroe doctrine, and congratulates the
Government upon the unanimous approval ot
the American people of a National policy so
necessary to our peace and National prosper-
ResoJved, That attested copies of these resolu
tions be sent to the President of the United
States and to the California delegation for
presentation to the Fifty-fourth Congress, now
in session; also, that copies be furnished the
public press, with request for their puDlica
tion.
In the matter of the proposed resurvey
of San Francisco Bay and its tributaries,
with a view to improved coa3t and harbor
defenses, the following resolutions were
introduced:
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
San Francisco respectfully urges upon the
honorable Fifty-fourth Congress of the United
States the prompt enactment of Senate bill
334, introduced by Senator Squire, providing
for the Immediate increase ot coast and harbor
defenses.
Resolved. That this chamber cordially ap- I
proves and urges prompt action upon the vari- j
ous suggestions made by members of Congress I
for increased naval construction as a necessity j
for the National defense. The money raised i
by the taxation of our people and expended I
both in increased coast defenses and the naval '
forces oi the republic returns at once to the j
avenues of labor and industry, and is not for a j
moment to be considered in "comparison with ;
the honor, prestige and safety of our country.
Resolved, Tnat attested copies of these reso
lutions be forwarded to the President of the
United States and to the CaliTornia delegation
for presentation to both houses of the Fifty
fourth Congress.
After resolutions had been adopted regu
lating tbe lay-days of vessels laden with
coal from foreign and domestic ports, the
niembeis of the chamber expressed them
selves as follows in relation to the funding
bill:
Resolved, That the Chamber of Commerce of
Pan Francisco, having under consideration all
the conditions involved, and having reference
to the message of the President of the United
States to the Fiftieth Congress, recommending
the Government to secure itself by legal pro
cess against financial loss in its relations with
the subsidized overland railroads, urgently
protests against the refunding of the indebted
ness of these railroads by legal enactments.
Resolved, That, wnile the question of the
management of railways by the Government
udmits of n fnir discussion, the obligation of a
corporation to pay its debts is as binding as
that of an individual debtor, and when unable
to ao this the ordinary process of laws should
prevail, otherwise our people have a right to I
complain that while citizens generally are {
made to obey the. law, rich corporations and '
millionaires are exempt.
Resolved, That the people dependent upon '
the line of the subsidized defaulting railroads, j
in the case of their debt being funded, must '
endure the burden of excessive cost of trans- !
poriation for the many years of the extension !
demanded, an obvious injustice, which will I
retard the development of the dependent ter- j
ritory; whereas a change of management,
either directly by the Government or by lease,
under proper restrictions, will develop the ter
ritory ami increase the value of the railway
itself". For these valid reasons, this Chamber
of Commerce favors foreclosure by the Govern
ment as the result of default in the payment of
the debt owing it.
Retolved, That attested copies of these reso- |
Unions be sent to the l'resident of the. United I
states, the Pacific Coast delegation in Congress j
and to tbe committee in the Senate and House
of Representatives having the measure under I
consideration; also, that copies be furnished i
the public press requesting its support.
Hugh Craig, the incoming president,
then read his inaugural address. After re
ferring to the prosperity which he said had
characterized the past year as contrasted
with the preceding year, Mr. Craig said
regarding the Venezuelan question:
The threatening of -war which for the last
month have excited the newspapers and Wash
ington politicians, thanks to the eommon
-I'li-e of the ordinary people of the Anglo
! Saxon race, are being relegated to the past, and
! the sneer of those who have pointed to the two
| j;reat sections of the Englisn-speaking people
with the remark, "See haw they love one an
other," will certainly be disappointed, for it
would be the crime of the century Bboald
"Brother John" and "Brother Jonathan" bo
unable to settle by arbitration the wretched
question of some Venezuela boundary. We
must not, however, allow this to be used as a
feint, or as a "red herring to be drawn across
I our scent," and forget that our "Kanuck
i cousins" are charged with bung a "little too
previous" in establishing custom-house offices
on what they claim is our Alaskan boundary.
A member of our chamber has within the last
thirty days informed me that his shipments of
manufactured clotbiug to the upper mines
of the Yukon have entirely ceased because
of the obstructions by Canadian customs
authorities, who permit Dominion manufac
tures to enter free and impose duties upon us.
Our countrymen in the republic of the isles
have been blessed with an abundant sugar
! harvestâ more than we can refine or consumeâ
i and have already drawn upon our port for
10.000 tons of shipping, and will probably re
quire 10,000 tons more, thence to New York.
We may fairly hope that during the coming
year an empowering act may be passed at
Washington facilitating a protectorate for that
youngest of republics, if not annexation to our
own country.
Going further afield, our kith and kin in
Australia are recovering from the wreckage of i
their financial institutions in 1893. Increased !
prices for their staples give them more pur- I
chasing power, which will increase trade be- I
tween our coast and their colonies. They have j
been unfortunate, however, in a short harvest, |
which has become our opportunity, for our j
overflowing granaries have been already I
drawn upon for some 25,000 tons of bread- !
stuffs, which may be increased to something
like 100,000 tons before their next harvest.
Indeed, late reports advise a shortage there of
over 200,000 tons.
The cessation of war between Japan and
China must lead to increase of the commerce
of our port. Already 500,000 bales of cotton
have been arranged for by Japan and are now
in course of transhipment to this City by rail,
and thence to its ports and destination by
steam. The possibilities in the womb of the
future for trade with the 400,000,000 of China
and the 40,000.000 of Japan cannot be pre
dicted, but certainly must inure to the ad
vantage of our port.
The energies of the Japanese population
when applied to manufacturing for export are
likely to make themselves felt in the marts of
the world, and they may become the "Yankees"
oi the Orient.
Alaska has poured her tribute of $1,750,000 !
from her mines and 800,000 cases of salmon
from her fisheries into our treasuries and ware
houses. Her possibilities for expansion are
limited only by the enterprise of our mer
chants.
Returning for a moment to our immediate
commercial requirements, it will be the duty
of each and every member of the Chamber of
Commerce to second our efforts to obtain an
appropriation for the removal of dangers to
navigation at the approach to and within our
own spacious bay of San Francisco.
I am informed by Professor Davidson, who
has made a specialty of the subject, that upon
one small indent of our harbor, where a cor
poration's influence has been made todoiu
wor)Â»at Washington, appropriations have been
secured amounting to $1,750,000, and to our
neighbor across the bay, the rising city of Oak
laud, we may 6ay "well done." But would you
believe it, during all that period the appropri
ations for San Francisco harbor have not ex
ceeded $100,000?
The newly elected officers of the cham
ber to soon be installed are: Hugh Craig
president; John L. Howard, first vice
president; Lonia B. Parrott, second vice
president; William L. Merry secretary;

HOPE FOR CONSUMPTIVES
Four Patients Declare They Are
Getting Strong and Well
on Lymph.
DR. HIRSCHFELDER'S METHOD.
A Sufferer in the City and County
Hospital Pitches Hay After a
Short Treatment.
There are three patients afflicted with
consumption in the City and County Hos
pital who declare that the lymph treat
ment of Dr. J. 0. Hirscbfelder has produced
extraordinary results for the better,
and these sufferers are now hopeful that
they may recover. One of them, William
John Davis, denies everything that Willie,
a fellow-patient, stated regarding the new
method of treatingconsumDtion. Willies
account of his alleged experiences in the
City and County Hospital, in effect that
Dr. Hirschfelder's injections for consump
tion were cruel and not efficacious, were
declared by Davis yesterday to be incor
rect.
One poor fellow, who on entering the
hospital little more than two months ago
could barely breathe, and for that reason
was positively unable to undergo the slight
est exertion, could not be found in the
consumption ward yesterday. After a
hunt about the institution he was found.
"Where were you?" the doctor in charge
of the ward asked.
"Out in the hayloft, helping a man
pitch hay,' : was the reply.
This man was James Card, 41 years of
age, laborer by occupation, who "entered
the hospital November 25, and began to
undergo the lymph treatment December
23. He looked sickly, of course, but had
little of that hue characteristic of the con
"l'm feeling pretty strong now," he
said in reply to a question as to his condi
tion. "I've been working up in the hay
loft. I took the treatment first December
25. I was pretty bad then, for up to that
time I had not picked up much, but I've
gained twenty-four or twenty-five Dounds
since."
"Fifteen pounds, isn't it?" interrupted
â¢No; twenty -five pounds. You did not
weigh me since January 7, and I've gained
ten riounds since. 1 weighed 1M pounds
Saturday when I weighed myself."
Regarding his present condition Card
spoke like a man in the full enjoyment of
health.
"At the present time I feel better than
for the last year," he said. "I've been im
proving fast ever since taking the lymph
treatment, been gaining in weight and
strength; and my wind is a great deal bet
ter. I couched very bad when I came in
here, but don't cough hardly at all nowâ
at night tiir.e very seldom, and for the last
four or rive nights none at all. My appe
tite is as good as can be, and I feel I'm
atting well fast."
'What do you think of the treatment?"
'As long as I've improved under it I
give it credit for the good it has done. ' I
feel that if I'd been on the outside with
out this treatment I would not have im
proved that way. Before December I
could hardly get up or down stairs, my
breath was so short, but that doesn't
bother me much now. I'm beginning to
feel like work again.' 1
William Carr, another patient under Dr.
Hirschfelder's treatment of injections be
tween the shoulders, said ho had improved
steadily under it. He is 26 years of age.
a laborer, and was admitted to the hos
pital December 16. While the ravages of
the disease had progressed far in his case
he was by no means a promising subject,
presenting as he did to the doctor a con
stitution wrecked from the excessive use
of alcoholic iiquor; and besides consump
tion had taken a firm hold of him. De
cember 31 he was placed nnder tiie lymph
treatment and practically every day since
then he has been triven an injection. The
Kstorv he told of his case is as follows:
he first two injection? made me a
sick, but after that I did not notice
any bad effect from it. At first 1 did not
feel much improvement, but my cough
soon began to go away and that made me
feel easier.
"I gained two and a half pounds in
ei^ht days and began to feel better and to
have a better appetite. My color has im
proved since I took the injections, and I !
feel now that the treatment gives me cause |
to hore that I will get well. I sleep
soundly on account of not coughing, as I
used to do, and after so much sleep all
night I feel good and rested in the morn
injr, and that is different from how I felt
before taking the treatment."
William John Davis, 62 years of age
who entered the hospital October 21. 1895^
in a very bad condition, began to take the
lymph treatment November 4, and now he
is wildly enthusiastic over its effect upon
him.
"When 1 came in here on October 22."
said he, "it was to die; not to live. I bade
ray friends good-by forever. Two weeks
after I commenced to take the lymph
treatment and in two weeks more found
the benefit of it. lam fast getting better.
My cough has disappeared and I sleep
will at night. I did not weigh 100 pounds
before taking it. My weieht went up to
10"M, to 111^. and now my steady weight
is 110 pounds, a gain of ten pounds.
"The injection is so good 1 could not
help but compliment Dr. Hirschfelder for
the good it has done me."
A private patient of the physician who
has introduced the treatment has been re
ceiving injections of the lymph for nearly
two months, and says he feels new blood
in his veins already. He is J. D. Maddox
of Santa Rosa. A few months ngo Mr
Maddox learned that he was stricken with
i phthisis. A member of his family, who is
a physician, advised him to try the lymph
treatment, and he came to San Francisco
and took rooms at 619 Hyde street, where
he was seen yesterday.
Mr. Maddox, like the two young suffer
ers in the hospital, had much of the color
of health without the hectic glow. His
eye, too, as with the others, was almost
normal, and his manner and spirits be
i trayed a mind full of something more than
I hopeâ a belief that he wouid eventually
return to health and happiness through
the medium of this as yet practically un
known remedy.
"Had I any friend afflicted with con
sumption," he said, "I should must cer
tainly recommend this treatment. As for
| myself, I would not give it up now for any
I consideration on earth, it has Deen such a
wonderful success in my case. Mv brother,
a graduate of Cooper Medical College
told me I ought to try the treatment
which Dr. Hirschfelder was introducing,
and I took his advice. I came to town and
have visited the doctor's office daily to be
treated, and 1 am beginning to feel myself
improve day by day."
THE VETERAN FIREMEN.
Installation and Banquet of Those
"Who Ran With the Old Ma
chine.
The annual installation of officers, re
union and banquet of the Veteran Volun
teer Firemen's Association were held last
evening in Pioneer Hall on Fourth street.
Financial Sacretary .Fohlmann reported
that he had received from all sources dur
ing the year $2769, and that thirty-three
new membership accounts had been
opened. The financial condition is better
now than it ever has beer.
During the year there were six deaths of
members. The membership-roll shows at
present 296 names. The trustees' report
showed a balance in bank December 31,
1894, of $1932 57; dividend No. 11, $46 3o;
received from treasurer, $300; dividend
No. 12, $45 28; balance in bank December
31, 1895, 1232420.
The retiring president, J. H. Mahoney,
who has held the position for the past two
or three terms, congratulated the members
upon the healthy condition of the associa
tion and thanked them for their help and
support during his occupancy of the presi
dent's chair. Then he installed the fol
lowing newly elected officers:
President, J. S. Marshall ; first vice-president,
S. Bunner; second vice-president, George Car
lisle; third vice-president, William 11. Miller ;
financial secretary, G. Pohlmann; recording
secretary, William A. Scollay; treasurer, W.
Fahrenkrug; directorsâ W. Kautinger, John
Foley, Thomas Cornell, F. Terramorse and Ala
Harris; trustees â K.Harold, Fred A. Will and
Colonel H. J. Burns.
At the conclusion of the installation the
members and their families retired to the
banquet hall, where a splendid repast of
everything that could tempt the appetite
was spread. Over 200 people sat down to
the table. A string band waÃ in attend
ance. Speeches and toasts were made and
responded to by many of the banqueters.
At the conclusion Gus Pohlmann sang
that ever popular fireman's song, "We
Ran With the Old Machine," and the en
tire assemblage joined in the chorus.
Murder in the Second Degree.
The trial of William Sierp was concluded In
Judge Bah r's court last evening, and the case
was given to the jury. Sierp was charged with
murder lor -having killed Emanuel Marino
during a saloon row on October 12 last. The
row took place in the saloon which is in Hinck
ley alley, and the killing was done out in the
street. The jury last night brought in a ver
dict of murder in the second aegree with a
recommendation to mercy. He will be sen
tenced on Saturday.
B'NAI B'RITH HALL TO GO
It Is to Be Disposed of to Pro
vide for a More Suitable
Structure.
A Building to Cost Not Less Than
$150,000 to Be Constructed on Van
Ness Avenue.
At the session of the Grand Lodge of the
Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, Dis
trict No. 4, which begins on Sunday next,
two of the most important measures that
have ever come up for consideration before
that body will be decided.
One of these is the proposition for the
construction of a magnificent new build
ing on the lot at the corner of Fell street
and Van Ness avenue, owned by the B'nai
B'rith Endowment Association, and the
sale of the present site and building owned
by the B'nai B'rith Hall Association.
The lot of the Endowment Fund Asso
ciation has a frontage of 120 feet on Van
Ness avenue and 100 feet on Fell street,
and is valued at about $100,000. On this
it is proposed to erect a structure to cost
not less than $150,000. It is proposed to
make this building the home of the order
and to equip it with every modern appur
tenance that will make it attractive for the
older and the younger members, as well as
for the children of the members.
Among other features it is understood
that Grand President Abraham Jonas will
recommend that a lecture-room, a reading
ing-room and a gymnasium be made part
of the institution, the idea being to pat
tern it as much like the popular building
of the Y. M. C. A. as possible.
The prospective changes outlined have
been the subject of discussion in every
subordinate lodge connected with the Dis
trict Grand Lodge for some time past, and
the sentiment among the individual mem
bers is practically unanimous in favor of
the new enterprise. The delegates to the
Grand Lodge, who are all past presidents
of the subordinate lodges, have not been
specially instructed to vote in favor of the
new building, but, as expressed by Grand
Secretary .Levison, "They are all men of
intelligence, and they will vote for what
ever they think best."
B'nai B'rith Hall and its present site is
owned by a stock company known as the
B'nai B'rith Hall Association, the share
holders of which are members of the vari
ous subordinate lodges, the subordinate
lodges and the Grand Lodge. It is the
purpose of the Grand Lodge to buy up all
the shares of the individual members and
the subordinate lodges and then to sell
the site and structure and use the pro
ceeds in the construction of the proposed
new building. There is a standing
offer of |125,000 for the Eddy-street
property as it exists to-day, but it
is believed that by waiting a short time
they will be able to get probably some
thing in the neighborhood of $140,000.
And the only opposition to the general
scheme is on this point. Some of the
members are opposed to beginning opera
tions on the new structure Defore the old
one is disposed of, as they are opposed to
becoming seriously involved in debt.
The new structure will stand in the name
of the B'nai B'rith Endowment Fund As
sociation and will be devoted entirely to
the needs of the order.
Another proposition that is to receive
attention is that relating to monthly dues
or assessments. Under the present rules
every married man who becomes a mem
ber of the order is compelled to join the
endowment branch, which gives his widow
or heirs $2000 on his death and provides
a weekly benefit of trom $8 to $10 a week
daring the illness of the member. For these
privileges and benefits the monthly dues are
now $2 50 for all members alike, regardless
of age at the time of affiliation. This
amount has been found inadequate to
meet the needs of the order, and a new
feature is to be placed before the Grand
Lodge for its consideration, in which it is
proposed to fix th-e assessments of mem
bers according to their age on a graduated
scale, the older applicants paying the
higher assessments.
The election of officers will take place on
Tuesday next.

PREPARING A MEMORIAL
The Sub â  Committee Is Almost
Ready to Render a Final
Report.
FUNDING OPPONENTS HOPEFUL.
Important Information Regarding the
Fight in Washington Arriv
ing Daily.
From the number of letters received by
Mayor Sutro during the past two days re
lating to the fight which the Committee of
Fifty is making against the funding bill it
is evident that the big anti-funding con
vention held at Metropolitan Temple on
Saturday last nns had a strong effect on
the community and the State at large.
A majority of the communications are
commendatory of the efforts of the com
mittee, while others offer suggestions for
points that can be urged against the bill
when it comes up before Congress for de
bate.
Mayor Sutro is still possessed by a fear
that the railroad lobbyists will manage to
secure votes that would otherwise be
recorded against the bill, but feels that
the chances of defeating it were never
stronger than at the present time, when
the people appear to be taking a general
interest in the matter. Not a day passes
that the Senators and Representatives are
not bombarded with broadsides of Colton
letters, hints on how National lawmakers
are bribed or appeals for the welfare of
California. At the same time the news
bureau in the Montgomery block is keep
ing the committee's agents in Washington
apprised of every move of the railroad
magnates that comes to light on this coast,
and reports from the capital are received
daily.
The nature of these reports is as a
general thine kept secret, the committee
not desiring to allow the advocates of the
bill to know just how much information
they are possessed of. Some startling
facts have been learned, however, regard
ing the work of the railroad lobbyists, and
this information will be put to good use
when the debate is opened, if not before.
Some Congressmen will be surprised to
know how much their movements have
been watched.
The memorial whicb is to be forwarded
to Congress as the expression of the
people of California regarding the funding
bill is taking shape and will be made
public within a day or two.
The sub-committee on memorial, which
consists of Messrs. Sutro, Davie, Doyle,
Highton, Gibson, Caminetti and Estee
has held several meetings, exchanged
ideas, and is now working on the docu
ment daily. The plan pursued is to have
each member draft a memorial according
to his own ideas, and the document which
is to go on to Washington will be made up
from the best points of all these.
The members of the original committee
are much pleased over the action of the
Chamberof Commerce in passing the reso
lutions that were adopted by that body
yesterday. The assistance of an organizat
ion representing such a large element of
the commercial world as the chamber does
is expected to have a decided effect on
Congress. The resolutions will be sent on
to Washington in full.
For Government Ownership.
A mass-meeting of those in favor of Govern
ment ownership of railroads has been caTed
for to-morrow evening at Metropolitan Temple.

ABOUT PROFIT ON BEER.
The Secretary of the Brewers'
Association Tells of the
Business.
ANNUAL OUTPUT OF THE STATE.
The Combine Will Not Reduce the
Price of the Malt Liquor It
Manufactures.
"The article published in The Call this
morning about our movement to fight the
brewers' combination," said Frank Marty
yesterday afternoon, ''drew a large num
ber of interested saloon-men to my place
to-day, and tliere is no doubt in my mind
that we will make a success of it.
i-"fore a week is over we will have
-:i signatures to the petition to make
a good showing.
"You say that the combination has
added another brewery to their list. Well,
that's all right That will not affect us,
fur we will get all the beer we need from
outside the City, and if we meet with
any opposition in that then wo have an
ther remedy. We will build another
brewery large enough to supply the de
mand. That is the least of our troubles.
It might delay our plans for a little time,
but that would not exceed two or thre?
monthsâ just long enough to build our
cry.
"The brewers declare that they cannot
make beer for less than $4 a barrel.' 1 and
peaker smiled as he said this. '-Why.
it does not cost more than SI 50 to make
it. so you can see what profit there is in
the L nth the protit they make
ould certainly spend what they did
the counter, but n they have decided
upon "the course they have announced
they must abide !>y the consequences, for
we intend to carry "out our plan, and from
the support already promised 1 feel sure
that we shall succeed.
"I cannot at this timo say more abont
our plans than has already been published
in The Call. In the course of a few days
we shall be able to make a showing that
will astonish the brewers. They have
formed into a monopoly and we will try to
break it."
lolph Mohr. secretary of the Brewers'
iation, in conversation on
the subject of tne movement of which
Frank Marty is the acknowledged head
and front, said: "That will not amount
_. In talking to saloon-kei
and I have talked to a ureat many of them,
: that they are well satisfied with the
new arrangement, and they appro iate
that it is to their interest that it should be
as it is.
"The new schedule of rates does not in
crease the rates. On the contrary the
saloon men are gainers. I'nder the old rule
they were charged $5 r>o a barrel and the
uriver was allowed to treat to the extent, of
50 cents a barrel and the saloon man was
bound to treat in return. Now they get
the beer for $."> nei and do not have to treat,
so they are *in' tne amount it would cost
them in liquor or cijars.
"Beer cannot be furnished cheaper than
it is, for it costs a little over $4 a barrel to
maKe and deliver to the purchaser; and if
it were cheaper saloon men would use a
greater quantity, and by so doing would
furnish to tie prohibitionists and
the high - license people an excuse
for continuing tiie attack on the saloons.
They would have an opportunity to urge
that there was an increase in intoxication,
but that, I contend, would not be true, for
it is a well-known- fact that beer does not
contain more than 5 per cent of alcohol,
and for that reason is one of the most tem
perate drinks used.
â¢'ln is?.")," continued Mr. Mohr. "the out
put of beer in California was 300,000 barrels.
Sow it is 800.000, of which between s">o 000
and KOO.OOO are brewed in this City. In
tne ! ' beer-making there is used
yearly 1,000,000 centals of barley and grain
In the Bute, between 5000 and 6000 bales of
hops, weighing iijO pounds each, also
raided in this State; between 800 and 1000
hones are employed, and the kegs run up
into the millions. One thousand men are
employed in the business, whose wages in
Sate amount to $20,000 a week, "or
000 a year. Then there are coopers,
carpenters. bricklayers, foundrymen,
smiths, horseshoers and others who
make a living out of the business, and
everything used is Californian, except that
which cannot be procured here. This, of
. is exclusive of the bottled beer
brands, of which I have no statistics. The
money derived from the business is spent
in California.
â¢'The list of breweries published in The
Call this morning is not complete, for
since the circular was printed and sent out
one more, the St, Louis Brewery, has been
added, and you may say that all the brew
eries are with us.
"I have no means of knowing where
those who are interested in the movement
against us will obtain the supply they re
fer to, but they will not get it from Sacra
mento nor Han Jose. Vallejo at one time
shipped beer to this City, but does not do
so now and will not."
A prominent individual who has had
more or less to do with the English beer
syndicate said that those of the opposition
movement who assert that they want the
money to remain in this country probably
refer to the English syndicate. "If they
do," he added, "they are laboring under a
mistake, for the English syndicate has not
been sending any n.oney to England."
A LAWYER'S ERROR.
His Own Act Invited Irregularity and
Thus Secured Hin Client a
New Trial.
A new trial ha 3 been granted to E. G.
Hawley, alias Edward G. Hay wood, who
was convicted of burglary in the Superior
Court. The reversal was based on the ir
regular proceedings which were allowed
after the case went to the jury.
The jury had been out several hours,
when the members asked to be allowed to
address the court. They stated that no
agreement could be reached unless they
were allowed to view the premises where
the bur/lary took place. This the Jurjge
finally allowed after the earnest request of
tfendant and his counsel, and after a
motion to that effect by counsel for de-

juryti vi.-.v i he premises. He denied the
motion to discharge the Drisoner and or

a new trial. Mr. Massey was the attorney
for the defendant and Mr. Tilden was of

HOMING BIRDS RACE.
Heavy "Weather Delays the Winged
Travelers so That Another Trial
Must Be Made.
Owing to the bad weather none of the
homing pigeons liberated at Marysville
yesterday reached this City within the
time limit of twenty-five miles an hour.
Another race will therefore be run, proba
bly on Friday.
There are two prizes for the race. A
gold medal and $5 goes to the winner and
a silver medal to the bird that arrives
second. Five fanciers were to have flown
bints, but A. Carlisle and Otto Boyd lost
their biras in the training. The only ones
represented were Edward G. Koenig, 2925
Jackson street, six birds; T. W. Leydecker,
Alameda, three birds; G. T. Marsh,
Twelfth avenue and Clement street. City,
one him. The birds were liberated in
Marysville, at 11:08 o'clock yesterday
morning. As the weather was cloudy and
there was a strong south wind the birds
made slow progress. The course is about
100 miles, hence the flight had to be com
pleted by 3 o'clock in the afternoon to
score. No birds arrived within that time.
Up to 6 o'clock last night only one bird
had reached its Joft. Tins was "X 135," a
young bird belonging to Mr. Koenig. The
bird reached its home at;>:2s p. m. It is of
noted stock, its father having brought a
message from Portland, Or., to this City
after having been away from its cote for
two and a half years.
FORD HAS RECOVERED.
The Charge Against Him Dismissed for
Lack of Prosecution.
The case against John B. Ford, charged
with an assault to murder his wife, wa9
discharged by Judge Campbell yesterday
for lack of prosecution.
In November last Ford, blinded by jeal
ousy ami liquor, tired three shots at his
wife in the Rosedale House, 321 Ellia
street, each taking effect. She recovered
and was able to visit him at the City
Prison on December 27. Early next morn
ins Ford cut his throat with a rqzor, sev
ering the windpipe, and it was thought he
could not recover. Dr. Fitzeibbon took
particuiar interest in the case and under
his treatment and the careful nurs
ing of bis wife Ford was able to leave the
hospital yesterday afternoon. He was
taken to '.')7 Taylor street, where his wife
has been J â¢ ing. Husband and wife are
now thor >ughly reconciled.
BALDWIN'S BIG MORTGAGE
A Concentration of Interests Was
the Only Object in Borrow
ing so Large a Sum.
California Should Be Advertised by
Large Property -Holders Im
proving Their Lands.
The heavy morteage effected by E. J.
Baldwin with the Hibernia Savings and
Loan Society, which appeared exclusively
in yesterday's Call, was not a renewal of
a mortgage nor was it an original one, but
rather a concentration of mortgages here
tofore held by individuals at various rates
of interest, covering various portions of
Baldwin's property. To bring his indebted
ness and liabilities into something of a
concentrated form he gave what may be
termed a "blanket" mortgage to the
Hibernia Bank, which will enable him to
pay off aii the other incuinbrances and
henceforth deal directly with one insti
tution.
Heretofore mortgages on portions of
Baldwin's property have been in various
hands. For instance on the annex, which
adjoins the hotel proper on the east side
there were two mortgages: one held by
Boyd & Davis for (250,000 and another by
Maurics Dore for $Su,oOo. This property
has only lately been purchased by Mr.
Baldwin and added to the hotel proper. In
another case his Santa Anita ranch con
sating of 2700 acres had a mortgage of
$100,000 hanging ovÂ»r it. This was held by
another private individual and so on witFi
almost all of his real estate. It was to dis
pose of those mortgages that he covered
all iiis property with one mammoth indebt
edness at one fixed rate of interest.
This was the explanation given by
"Lucky" when spoken to yesterday by a
Call- reporter. And in addition to this
Mr. Baldwin became quite enthusiastic
over his enterprise in this City and State,
He said: "'I have made my money in
California and I have spent it in Cafifor
nia. I have not sought Europe for either
climate or society, nor for Dlue-blooded
associates.
"Tlie companionship of the honest, hard
working men is good enough for me. I
am one of them, and whatever money I
have made or property acauired came
from the soil of this State, consequently it
belongs here.
"1 am improving my property both in
this City and elsewhere. 1 am now build
in? a front 165 feet in length to my Lake
Tahoe house, and will have electric lights
all over the grounds about the buildings.
Again, I am spending quite a sum of
money in the basement of the hotel.
"This basement, besides the entire hotel,
will be lighted by electricity, which I will
supply myself, and in all I am giving em
ployment to hundreds of workmen.
'â¢The Santa Anita ranch will also come
in for its share of improvements this
spring. So long as I have money I will
keep spending it on improvements. It is
true, I am getting old and could afford to
take things easy, but this Â»s not my nature.
I must make myself useful while I am
here. I did not need to take such a big
mortgage as I have just taken on my
property, but I like to have plenty of
money to improve with. What other rich
men do with their wealth is none of my
business. I will keep mine circulating be
tween the people and the bank and vice
versa. This is the way, at least I think so,
of advertising the State. Improve it and
then the Eastern people will find out for
themselves whether it is a good place in
which to live or not."
KELLY IS IN LUCK
The Toung Window-Smasher Finds Two
Kind Friends.
Thomas Kelly, the young man who
smashed a window in Chinatown in order
to get into prison, where he could obtain
enough food to keep him from starv
ing, is in luck. Yesterday morninc
P. H. 0. Sandy, 410 Sansome street, and
Dr. Scnlesinger, McAllister street, called
at police headquarters and asked per
mission from Captain Healey to see Kelly.
They went to the prison and questioned
KelJy about his Philadelphia experience,
and his answers were satisfactory.
They then waited upon Judge Joachim
sen, and on their representations the
charge of malicious mischief was dis
missed. Dr. Schlesinger promised that
Kelly would have plenty to eat and drink,
and Sandy will give him employment.
This satisfactory outcome of Kelly's ex
perience may result In many more broken
windows In Chinatown, as the City is full
of deserving young people who are not
able to find employment by which they
can support themselves.
A Burglar Charged.
George Paul, alias Ueorge Miller, the amateur
burglar, who entered the residence of General
Dimond early Saturday morning, has been
identified as the man who forced an entrance
by the kitchen window into the residence of
Ernest DeniCke, Mason and Sacramento streets,
about two weeks ago. He was frightened away
before he had time to take anything, yester
day charges of burglary and having burglars'
tools in his possession were registered against
him at the City Prison.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1896.
TRUE BLUE WAS A STAYER.
Captured the Two-Year-Old Event
After a Long Delay at
the Post.
LIZZIE H FIRST AT 7 TO 1.
Colonel Weightman Performed Poorly.
Game Nephew Took the Mile
Run Easily.
Ten two-year-olds started in a three and
a half furlong dash at Inglesiie yesterday,
and they caused starter Caldwell a world
of trouble. Each rider evidently had or
ders to get away in front, for nearly an
hour and twenty minutes elapsed before
the starter could drop his bunting to any
thing like a fair line-up. Walter Hobart
had two grand-looking youngsters entered
in Investigator and The Sinner, the pair
ruling 7to 5 favorites in the ring. Gordon,
a black colt by Tremont, who finished
third one day last week, was second choice.
liOrd Chesterfield and Colonel Wheeler,
both racy-looking individuals, sported the
Burns & Waterhouse colors and com
manded third call in the betting, being
backed down from 7 to 4.
There was not much to the race when
they were finally sent away the first part
of the running but the Hobart pair and
Bergen ; the trio swinging into the stretch
clear of the others. Investigator, who
had been running in third position, now
passed bis stable mate and the Corrigan
entry and as the wire was neared, although

tiring badly, looked a likely winner. Sud
denly a dangerous contender sprang up.
True" Blue, a 12 to 1 chance, had been
gamely striding toward the front from the
rear and a sixteenth from home challenged
the leader, who was unable to respond
and was cleverly beaten out by a length.
Bergen, who seems to be of the improving
kind, was a good third.
The attendance was quite up to the aver
age, and some lively speculating was in
dulged in. On account of the long delay
at the post in the two-year-ola event, the
management were compelled to postpone
the deciding of the last race on the card
until the day following.
The track, which is drying fast, was too
heavy for very fast time. Favorites cap
tured two events; a second choice and two
outsiders proving successful in the others.
A. five-and-a-half-furlong dash, with
eleven starters, opened the day's sport.
Summertime was made a 2 to 1 favorite,
and after getting away poorly, made a
great run around her field, and showed in
front as the stretch was reached. Gradu
ally drawing away, she won easily, four
lengths in front of Artist, the second
choice. Crawford was the show horse.
The black filly Lizzie H was overlooked
in the six-furlong run that was third on
the card, the crowd allowing hsr to run
unbacked at odds of 7 to 1. The bulk of
the coin went in on Hazard and Unity,
both closing in the betting at 11 to 5. Car
rie U set a merry clip to the far turn,
where she was passed by Mount McGregor
11, who led inio the stretch. Garner then
sent Lizzie H out, and she passed the wire
two lengths before Pique, who finished
strong under Coady's riding. Unity was
only a fair third.
Andy Blakeley's jumper, Colonel Weight
man, was plunged on to win the mile-and
a-sixtetmth hurdle affair, and made a very
poor showing. Three Forks was in front
the whole way, and, although stopping
badly at the end. won by three lengths
from the fast-coming Cicero. Silverado
was thin?, eight lengths away.
Bookmaker George Rose's Nephew, a
member in good standing of the magnifi
cent cripple division, took the last race of
the day, over a mile, starting an even
money "choice, backed down from 7 to 5.
Road Runner took the lead from Ike L
turning into the backstretch and showed
the way to the straight for the wire. Dos
gett then shook the favorite up, and he
came on and won easily by a length and a
half from Mollie R. Road Runner was
third, but a short head further off.
POPULAR LADIES' DAT.
The Gate at Picturesque Ingleside Free to
the Fair Sex To-Day.
This, the concluding day of the meeting
at Ingleside, will be Ladies' day, the gate
as usual being free to the members of the
fair sex.
The track will be in good condition and
the management have made a special
effort in arranging a racecard above the
average for excellence. An event out of
the ordinary groove and one that is bound
to excite great interest will be the two
mile contest. Stamina and staying quali
ties serve in good stead in a contest of
this sort, and with the game Cadmus,
Julia O, Cicero and J 0 C among the start
ers, a grand struggle may be looked for
ward to.
Professor Huber's band of soloists will
render some selections especially selected
for the occasion.
Track and Paddock Items.
Young Garner landed two winners yes
terday.
McFarlane, who was extensively backed
to win the opening event, was almost left
at the post.
True Blue, winner of the two-year-old
race, is a full brother to Carmcl.
The stewards have decided to decline the
entry of Pescador in future. The horse is
a notoriously bad actor and ofttimes the
chances of many a good horse are ruined
by the unruly one-eyed horse at the post.
For the first time at the meeting the
claiming clause, which permits of an
owner having an entry in a race claiming
any one of the other starters, regardless of
where the animal finishes, upon payment
of the entered selling price and hrst money
of the purse contributed for, was taken
advantage of yesterday. Unity, the chest
nut gelding by Kossington-lJnite, owned
by Louis Kzell, was entered in the third
race to be sold for $400. The horse fin
ished third, and was claimed by ''Tom"
Griffin, who started Carrie M in the race.
Owner Ezell received $72f> for his horse.
Griffin lost the stake horse Henry Young
out of a selling event in 1893.

While the election of directors was being
held in the business office the private
room of President Staples was visited by
almost all the insurance men, as also quite
a number of the personal friends oi Mr.
Staples in the City, who Hocked in to con
gratulate him on his thirtieth anniversary
as president of the company. The popular
first vice-president, Mr. Dutton, who has
been connected with the company for
twenty-nine years â as secretary for twenty
five and in his present responsible posi
tion for the past four years â received his
share of the good wishes of his numerous
friends.
PARDINI FOUND GUILTY.
It Took the Jury Only Three Minutes
to Reach a Veritict in the
Case.
After tbree minutes' deliberation the
jury which has been trying the case of
Eugene Pardini upon a chai ge of felonious
assault, found him guilty. The principal
witness against him was Minnie Logan, a
little girl 12 years old.
Pardini was one of the North Beach
gang, whose doings created such a sensa
tion a few rnontns ago. Ratz, another of
the gang, will come up to-day, and Meyer
and Lane are awaiting trials.
May Hunt Fur Animals.
A circular was received by Collector of the
Port Wise yesterday from Secretary Cnrlislo

of April 16 so far as to allow white men mar
ried to natives and engaged in otter hunting
in Alaska prior to March '2, ISO 3, to enjoy the
privileges of fur-animal hunting in that ter
ritory. The former circular excluded all white
men married to natives from this privilege.

REV. FATHER CARAHER'S STIRRING ADDRESS
Two Thousand Persons Are
Turned Away From
the Temple.
ON STANDING ROOM LEFT
Audience Carried Away by the
Eloquence of the Catholic
Divine.
OTHER CLERGY CRITICIZED.
Scathing Comments on the Division of
the Churches North and
South.
Metropolitan Temple was packed last
ni.cht.
Of the five or six thousand persons who
were desirous of attending the meeting
held under the auspices of the Young
THE REV. FATHER CARAHER.
[From a photograph.]
Men's Catholic Union, and listening to the 1
eloquent Father Caraber of San Jose, at j
least two thousand were disappointed.
The sidewalk in front of the temple was i
crowded with men, women and children at
7 o'clock, and after the doors were opened \
there was a continuous line, twenty I
abreast, struggling on the way up the i
broad stairway.
At 7:45 o'clock officers at the entrance
announced to the anxious and pressing
crowd that all the* seating and standing '
room was taken up. Even this was not
conclusive. The crowd pressed on, ap
parently determined to gain entrance at
any cost, but the doors were effectually
barred, and at least 2000 persons left the
building with great reluctance and disap- j
pointment. As it was, the auditorium and I
galleries were filled almost to suffocation. !
The stage was occupied by members of
the Young Men's Catholic Union, over
whose heads waved in graceful festoons
the National colors in flag and bunting.
After an organ voluntary J. H. Sullivan
of the Young Men's Catholic Union was
introduced as chairman of the meeting.
He made a few introductory remarks,
which were at once eloquent and pointed. !
He referred in sarcastic terms to the
patriotic speeches delivered from the plat
form on which* he stood by members of
the A. P. A.
"I believe," he said, "that it is the duty
of every earnest and honest Catholic
to resist the charges made by the
ranting orators of that aggregation known
as the A. P. A., and to show the people i
that on the head of loyalty and patriotism
we are equal with, if in fact not ahead of,
those who would seek to impugn our loy
alty to the Republic. There have r^en
utterances from this platform that no
honest Catholic should listen to or hear
repeated without burning indignation,
and as a representative of ' the union I
take great pleasure in thus publicly brand
ing such calumnious utterances as false
hoods." :-' -V:^
Fresh applause followed Chairman Sul
livan's short address and the audience j
seemed on the point of insisting for some
thing more of the same kind from the
same source.
T. J. Walsh sang a patriotic solo entitled
"The Sword of Hunker Hill" with good
effect, and the vast audience found a vent
for the pent-up enthusiasm engendered by
the chairman's address and the numerous 'â 
and apropos side remarks interpolated by !
the vociferous members of the audience. .
The Rev. Father Caraher, the speaker of
the evening, was then introduced, the I
words of the chairman being drowned in
the tumultuous applause. He said:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
As already announced, the subject of this
address is "Calumnies Against Catholics."
For well nigh two years San Francisco and j
several cities and towns of this State {
have frequently witnessed outbursts of
religious bigotry. - Sunday after 'Sunday
during a portion' of that ' time from this
platform upon which I am now standing, the j
most unchristian and infamous attack.- have
been made upon Catholics and everything
they hold sacred and in veneration. Every
foul calumny against Catholics that has ever
existed or that could be invented has been
hurled against us in this temple and circu
lated afterward in the public press.
The forbearance of our people under such
strong provocation has been really wonderful,
! considering their numbers and strength, and
considering also the fact that they have been
i attacked at their own doors ana in a city that
has been founded and, in a preat measure,
â¢ brought to its present state by Caihnlics.
Among the most ribald and rabia of the
speakers have been men professing to be minis
sters of the gospel, but the gospel which they
preach is not thatof brotherly love and Chris
tian forbearance; on the contrary, it is the
gospel of hate and dissension. If we ex
cept a court-martialed and disgraced general
who strutted upon vhis platform a few mouths
aeo, our detainers have been chiefly
uimaturalized foreign ministers or min
isters who have been given an in
definite leave of absence by their
congregations in Kentucky and elsewhere, on
account of the ir crimes and scandals, nn occa
sional pettifogging lawyer has appeared upon
the scene and screeched against â¢â¢Romanism."
but he has always proved himself to be a liar,
instead of a lawyer.
Oi the audience that throngs this temple on
Sundays, many come through idle curiosity to
listen to the rant and ravings of political buf
foons, while others come to have their morbid,
unchristian feelings gratified by listening to*
attacks on "Popes" and "Popery."'
In taking up the daily papers two items of
news are now sure to strike the eye of the
reader. One relates to the brutal atrocities
committed by the Turks and Kurds upon
Christiana in Armenia; the other relates to the
savnge onslaughts made by the A. P. A. Kurds
upon the Catholics. It is cheering, however,
to know that our enemies are being routed,
horse, foot and dragoons, in the Eastern States,
and before many months shall have passed
they will meet on this coast with a crushing
York town.
In exposing to-night some of the vile calum
nies that have been hurled against Catholic
Irish 1 give no offense to fair-minded Protes
tants and non-Catholics, and should I utter a
single offensive expression I recall it here now.
I regret deeply that the demon of religious dis
cord should have been let loose upon this once
peaceable City, but all can easily see that he
I has not been loosed by Catholics, and that they
j are now driving him back to his dark, loath
j some dungeon.
Calumnies against the nuns or sistersâ From
the first appearance of our enemies until this
| moment they have been heaping calumnies
j upon the heads of the nuns or sisters of the
j Catholic church. The latest calumny that I
, have seen against the sisters comes from the
poisonous pen of the Rev. or rather Irrev.
j Bowman, who writes that the offices in
j Washington are overrun by begging
i nuns, who extort money trom the employes.
Most of the calumnies, however, are so grossly
I obscure, so shocking to -the moral sense, that
I they could only be repeated by a Henry or a
Hubbell, a Bowman or a Brown. But we must
remember that this war upon the sisters is not
made on' account of their religion, for the
A. P. A. 's respect every form of religion, par
ticularly the Catholic. It is waged against
them on account of their interference in politics
and their voting at elections at the dictation
of the Pope. I teel, ladies and gentlemen, that
I should make a public defense, feeble though
it be, of a class of Catholics who cannot de
fend themselves. There are no more defense
less persons in creation than those nuns or
sisters. They can use neither voice nor pen,
hand nor loot in their defense, and the ruffian
that would assail their virtue, whether he be a
.minister or a layman, should have the flesh
torn oft" his filthy carcass by the cat-o'-nine
tails. Catholic sisters are respected on account
of their purity and self-sacrifice by the Turks,
the Arabs, the Hindoos and the pagans of
every nation, and are only defamed by your
spurious A. P. A.'s. Our sisters are not only the
I purest women that walk the earth to-day, but
| among the greatest benefactors -of society.
j Their schools and academies are not only seats
of learning, but also nurseries of virtue, whore
many of our best non-Catholic ladies have re
ceived their mental and moral training.
They take the place of mothers toward
orphans and waifs of society, and
clothe, feed and educate them with trifling
expense to the â¢ State. They receive with
open arms tbe exposed, famishing foundling
: and warm it into life with a mother's tender
: care. These sisters so foully defamed by the
A.' P. A. scum, by ruffianly Orangemen and
I beetle-browed Scandinavian" Mormaus, devote
their lives in hospitals, pesthouses, tents and
quarantines, to the sick ana suffering, the
plague-stricken and incurable, and many of
them perish at their posts of duty.
When this Nation was divided into two hos
-1 tile camps, and its lifeblood was flowing like
water, our sisters were to bo found upon the
battlefield binding up the bleeding wounds of
the. soldier and cooling his parched, feverish
lips with water, amid â¢ the bursting of
shells and the whizzing of bullets. With

influence in politics? They are men and min
isters belonging to those sects whose preachers
have always been notorious with their
meddling in politics, and who have always
been the worst types of political demagogues.
For years the timbers of this temple rang
every Saturday evening with the political
harangues of a Baptist minister, who gener
ally made Catholics his targets, with the Pope
in the center. But when that minister was
shot down upon the public street and when a
calamity greater than that which crushed the
house of Atrena fell upon himself and his fam
ily, he found that Catnolics were his best
friends and ever afterward he had only praise
to bestow upon them and their spiritual head
in Rome.
In the election campaign of 1875 a Methodist
minister, now a Bishop, was a party candidate
for Superintendent of Schools of' California
and was frequently to be seen in the thick of
battle fighting for the spoils of office, and now
his brother ministers are screechinsr like
night owls against trie imaginary interfering
of priests in politics.
But let us go Eastward for a moment. Toward
the end of the Presidential campaign of 1884
our calumniators were guilty of a political
crime in the city of New York that should seal
their lips forever. The majority of the voter?
of this Republic had made up their minds to
vote for Maine's favorite son, for "the invinci
ble Rupert of debate, the whit.e-plumed warrior
of Navarre," Jnmes G. Blame. Irishmen had left
the Democratic ranks as they Ehould have
done and vowed that they would vote for the
man who had roasted Salisbury in his burn
ing speeches and who had fearlessly lilted up
his voice in behalf of downtrodden Ireland.
The great statesman had his hand almost upon
the Presidential prize when a band of big
oted parsons, who must have come up from
the darkest corners of Dante's inforno, inter
vened and complimented him upon his nn
comnromising hostility to "Rum, Romanism
and Rebellion."
The telegraph wires were redhot with these
words before they were cold upon the lips of
Parson Burchard, and on election dRy the sun
set upon the slaughter at the polls of "the most
typical American statesman that the republic
lm-i produced since the days of Abraham Lin
coln.
Some of these exponents of liberal Christian
ity, albeit Protestantism, who would heap cal
umny upon the head of the Catholic church
are held up to public view with a glory shin
ine upon them, such as the person the Rev.
Brown. Revs. Case and Bovard are also ex
tremists in matters Qf Protestantism in its ref
erence to the Catholic church and the hierar
chy. As representatives of Methodistism the
last two divines mentioned are specimens of
their classâ narrow and bigoted. Methodist
ism has ever r>een uncharitable.
Without a falVen Martin Luther in Germany
you would not have a Rev. Father Waugh to
cackle prayers here on Sunday afternoons, nor
a Quitzow to preside. And without a fallen
John Knox in Scotland you might not have a
Rev. Mr. Uibvonor a Ross; and oh, what a loss!
When, therefore, ourenemies make onslaughts
on fallen priests they are violating the fourth
commandment, which obliges them to honor
and respect their parents.
B|The Methodists accuse the Catholics of being
disloyal to the Union. Every one knows that
the late schism between the North and South
caused a split in the church. What of that
kind of Christianity? No more loyal sub
jects in the Union were enlisted' in the
army of the North than those who were repre
sentatives of the Catholic faith.
But such men as the Rev. Brown represent
the element in the Protestant church which is
antagonistic to Catholicism. May we hope
that this is not the pure element of Protestant
ism.
And new, O glorious Republic! O Catholic
Columbia! I salute thee to-night, and with
ten millions of my co-religionists I offer thee
my homage an:l renew to thee my vow of un
swerving fidelity. Thy form is f'nirer in my
eyes than any form that ever rose up be
fore the vision of painter or of
sculptor. May thy sacred soil never
be polluted by the foot of any tyrant, may
thy liberty, civil and religious, never suffer
the least diminution and mayest thou always
be as free as the wind that sweeps over thy
boundless prairies. May all bigotry be stifled
â within thy borders and be succeeded by char
ity and brotherhood. May thy children in
crease not only in numbers, but aiso in virtue,
intelligence and patriotism. May new stars
continue to appear upon the firmanent of thy
flag and may thy flag, the emblem of liberty,
ever float over a Tirtuous and united and pa

COMPETITION BY WATER.
It Plays an Important Part in
the Commerce of San
Francisco.
Traffic Manager Curtis Preparing a
Table of Rates to Oregon and
Washington.
No means that will aid San Francisco in
maintaining her position as tho metrop
olis of the Pacific Coast is being neglected
by Traffic Manager W. B, Curtis of the
Traffic Association.
As an outcome of the present deter
mined three-cornered rate war between
the Southern Pacific Company, the Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company
and the North Pacific Steamship Com
pany the rales by water to Portland have
been forced down to $1 a ton, and under
these conditions a favorable opportunity
exists for San Francisco to compete with
Portland for the trade of Eastern Oregon,
Eastern Washington and other sections
that are ordinarily tributary to Portland.
It is also claimed by Mr. Curtis that San
Francisco would be able to secure a larger
portion of the trade of the southern part
of Oregon as against Portland were it not
for the position taken by the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company, whose pol
icy is and has been, so it is claimed by Mr.
Curtis, to build up Portland at the ex
pense of San Francisco. This it accom
plishes, it is asserted, in two ways. The
first and most important is> by entering
into an agreement with the Northern Pa
cific Railroad Company by which rates are
niade from $3 to $9 per* ton higher to points
in Eastern Oregon ana Eastern Washing
ton from San Francisco than they are to
the same points from Portland. This
naturally gives Portland a considerable
advantage over San Francisco in securing
the business of the sections named.
Another way In which the Oregon Rail
way and Navigation Company assists the
Portland merchant to The detriment of
the merchant of San Francisco is by mak
ing a $1 per ton rate from Portland to
Coos Bay instead of maintaining the reg
ular rate of $3 per ton.
The North Pacific Steamship Company
has two steamersâ the Empire â¢ and the
Alice Blanchardâ plying between
here and Portland via Yaquina and Coos
bays, and they are carrying freight north
bound to Portland for $1 a ton. maintain
ing, however, the regular rate of $3 a ton
from Portland to Coos Cay.
Recently the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation v Company put ion the steam
schooner South Coast, it is claimed to
drive the Empire and the Alice Blanchard
from this route.
In view of these facts the Traffic Asso
ciation is preparing a table of compara
tive rates from San Francisco to the inte
rior points of Oregon and Washington to
show the merchants of San Francisco the
advantages of shipping to those points via
Portland on the steamers of the North
Pacific Steamship Company. The local
merchants, in the circular to be sent out
from the office of the Traffic Association,
will be urged to patronize the North
Pacific Steamship Company for two im
portant reasons. It will he" claimed that
this company is a local organization and
working directly and continuously in the
interests of San Francisco, and that
by supporting it the merchants will
at the same time be cultivating
an influence that will effectually
prevent a restoration of the high rates
that previously prevailed to Portland from
this City, and which acted as an effective
bar to the trade of the Northwest. It will
not be long, it is expected, before the
Southern Pacific Company and the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company will
patch un the differences that now exist be
tween them, and which brought on the
present bitter rate war. When they do, it
is claimed they will endeavor to put all
rates back to where they were before tiie
fight began. But with the existence of a
competing water route, such as that now
being operated by the North Pacific Steam
ship Company, this will prove an impossi
bility.
The steamer Empire leaves to-day for
the north, and will be followed six days
later by the Alice Blanchard. They will
then alternate every six days.
THE COUNT CAPDEVILLA.
A Nobleman of Barcelona Who
Thinks Cubans Will Be
Defeated.
OWNS RICH TOBACCO LANDS.
He Says Seven-Tenths of the Insur
gents Are Negroes and That They
Can Never Win.
Among the arrivals at the Occidental is
the Count Salvador Capdevilla de Puigr y
Perella of Barcelona, Spain, who has re
cently been for some time in Havana.
The Count is among the most conspic
uous of the Spanish nobility. His family
is well on to 1000 years old, and the ruined
castles of the Capdevillas antedating him
are scattered from Seville to Salamanca.
The brother of the Count is the Count
Gines Capdevilla, oue of the foremost art
ists of Spain.
The Count Salvador is a very handsome
man, who has not yet reached 30 years.
His face shows the pure Castilian blood
and his bushy black hair and dark eyes
tell of life for many generations under
semi-tropical suns.
For over 100 years his family has owned
tobacco plantations in Cuba, and he nas
been there in connection with their inter
ests. The Count is a warm advocate of
the cause of Spain in the war with the in
surgents of the Pearl of the Antilles, and
he :>ays he is convinced that Spain will
eventually win.
The cause of the war, he thinks, is mis
understood in this country. Seven-tenths
of the insurrectionists are negroes, so he
says, and should they be successful they
would soon repudiate the whole Cuban
rule, and revolution would follow revolu
tion.
"I am a liberal Spaniard." said the no
bleman, "but I cannot think that the
Cubans are yet prepared for self-povern
ment. It is almost 400 years now since
The Count Salvador Capd. villa de Puig y I erella of Sp?la, Who Is Now Hero.
[From a photograph.}
Cuba was colonized by Spain. As the
aborigines gradually tended toward ex
tinction the importation of slaves began.
"From 1820 to 1840 over 13,000 were
brought from Africa and landed there.
Shortly afterward the slave trade was sup
pressed, but it soon revived again.
"The negroes soon outnumbered the
Spanisli residents and soldiers, and rose in
revolt. They were soon subdued, how
ever. Then followed the bloody insurrec-
tion of 1848. in which 10,000 negroes were
killed. Colonel Narciso Lopez then nn
successfully attempted to revolutionize
Cuba. After this followed many filibus
tering expeditions. Finally the republic
of Cuba was proclaimed, with freedom to
the slaves, and Cespedes was elected Presi
dent. Well, war followed, which was kept
up for ten years, and it was a bitter and
relentless war, too.
"It is the descendants of these people
who fought the Spanish in those times
that are now fighting against Spanish rule,
or, as they put it, to throw off the Span
ish yoke. I think a great deal of some of
these men, particularly the whites of
Cuban blood, but they are so far in the
minority that, in my opinion, they. cannot
succeed. *
'â¢It is a good thing to my mind that it is
so, for if the insurgents could win the
raising of crops would be neglected and
Cuba be overrun with pauperism. Besides
this an element of discord would be found
in the sons of slaves who have been educa
ted abroad.
"There are many of these in Havana,
and in the event of the independence of
Cuba they would demand the offices. This
the rank and file of the negroes would
com hat, for they have no love for the edu
cated neeroes.
"As it is, the lands and wealth of the
islands are in the hands of the Spaniards
almost entirely, [f every few years the
plantations, stores and homes of the Span
ish are to be desolated, it would be better
to turn them all over and give up the con
test. Still the Spaniards will never do it.
When the sreat Emilo Castelar said 'Cuba
now for Spain, and always for Spain,' he
voiced the sentiment that lives strongly in
every Spaniard's heart.
"Spain has Christ anized and civilized
Cuba. Mhall she give up ttie country
now? Captsin - General Campo3 would
hayÂ« won a signal victory over ihe insur
gents ere this were it not" that the officers
under him have been dissatisfied with his
humane policy.
"From late advices which I have re
ceived from Spain I learn that the dissatis
fied officers are soon to be satisfied. Prime
Minister Canovas Castillo has decided to
order a more vigorous mode of warfare.
_ "This simply means a war of extermina
tion. The results will be terrible, but
with the insurrection ended Spain will
again set to work to rehabilitate and re
build her desolated possession."
The Count Capdevilla spent some time
at Cripple CreeK on his way here. He
does not think much of the hurly buriy of
the excitement t:iere.
"Men are coming in from all directions
with blankets on their backs," lie said,
"and throngs of them have no place to
sleep except out in the cold and snow.
Their wives and children are waiting for
them to build homes there, but in many
cases the men fall into bad habits, includ
ing drinking, and they are worse off than
at the beginning.
"Some of them expected, apparently,
to find lumps of gold in the street. Tbey
won't get any. There are stumps, stones
and snowbanks everywhere in the camp
and surrounding it. "it is not an alluring
place. I have Jetters from some of my
friends in Spain about it. I shall not
urge any of them to go there."
By a singular circumstance, the Count
accidentally met Raymon Banana, the
California-street millionaire, yesterday.
The former is a native of Barcelona, and
fifty years ago came to California as a
priest. During the' gold excitement he
left the church and took advantage of h;s
opportunities to make a fortune.
He was an intimate friend of some of
the members of tne Count's family, and
was overjoyed to meet the Count.
The latter will be here for several days
at least. He went from Cripple Creek to
the Northwest and has only "just arrived
here. The Count is a great reader, taking
particular interest in the poetry of differnt
nations. He is also greatly interestede in
pictures.
ONE DEPOSITOR HAPPY.
Pacific Bank Directors Must
Pay Matthew McGowan
in Full.
The Judgment of the Lower Court for
$25,577 71 Affirmed by the
Supreme Court.
The directors of the Pacific Bank must
pay to Matthew McGowan $25,577 71, the
amount of a judgment awarded him by
the Superior Court in his suit against the
directors of the Pacific Bank to recover
the amount of a deposit.
He sued the directors each for his pro
portion of the amount. In answer it was
contended that by the terms under which
the Pacific Accumulation Loan Company,
the predecessor of the Pacific Bank, was
organized the stockholders were expressly
exempted from liability, and, further, that
as the Pacific Bank never elected to con
tinue its existence under the provisions of
the Civil Code the corporation was not
affected by the provisions of the code in
regard to corporations, and hence no lia
bility could be imposed on the bank di
rectors.
The act which the directors relied on
was that of April 11, 1882. This act in
section 27 announces that "corporations
formed under this act, and the members
and stockholders thereof, shall not be sub
ject to the conditions and liabilities con
tained in, and shall be exempt from the
operation of, an act concerning corpora
tions, passed April 22, 18.30."
If this section is intended to declare that
the stockholders of a corporation formed
under the provisions of the act should not
be individually and personally liable for
any portion of its debts and liabilities,
then, the Supreme Court says, it was in
plain conflict with section 36 of article IV
of the constitution of 1849, which says that
"each stock holder of a corporation or joint
stock association shall be individually and
personally liable for his proportion of all
its debts and liabilities."
It was further claimed under this con
struction that if part of the act was uncon
stitutional, the whole must necessarily be
so, but the Supreme Court holds that this
does not follow. It had already been de
cided that if some provisions of a bill are
unconstitutional they will not vitiate
the remainder of the act unless the ob
noxious provisions contain the elements
of the act itself. It was also urged that
the Legislature had no power to change
the liability of stockholders under the
provision of the Federal constitution
which prohibits the States from passing
laws impairing the obligations of con
tracts; but the Supreme Court answers
this contention by quoting the constitu
tion of 1840, where it says: "Corporations
may be formed by general laws, but shall
not be created by special act except for
municipal purposes. All general lawsand
special acts passed pursuant to this sec
tion may be altered from time to time or
repealed."
Under this authority, it is held, the
Legislature had the power to change the
law in regard to the liabilities of stock
holders without violating any provisions
of the Federal constitution.
It was also contended that the Pacific
Bank was originally organized as a savings
bank, and that the stockholders of such a
bank cannot be held liable for its debts.
But the Supreme Court snys that by the
Dronsions of the constitution of 1849 all
stockholders of all corporations were
made liable, without regard to the charac
ter of the business transacted. Besides, it
was shown that the bunk was receiving de
posits and was doing a general banking
business, ana it was further shown that
since 1856 the bank has been advertising
Itself as a commercial bank.

INTERIOR PLANS READY
The New City Hall Dome Is
Now in a Fair Way to
Be Completed.
RESULT OF MR. SHEA'S WORK
Marble and Ornamental Glass to Cut
an Important Figure in the
Calculations.
Architect Frank Shea of the City Hall
has completed his general plans for the
interior of the dome and the result of his
labors was presented to the City Hall Com
missioners at their meeting yesterday.
Mr. Shea explained that his object had
been to make the rotunda an inviting
main entrance to the hall and that in pur
suance of this plan he had chosen materials
for the finishing and embellishment of
this portion of the tower that are noted
for their durability and beauty. He stated
that the finishing of the rotunda includes
the placing of the floors in all the galleries,
the setting of the first-story pavement, the
finishing and ornamentation of all the
colonnades, cornices and railings and the
covering of the entire wal! surfaces and
the inclosing of the rotunda with an in
terior dome of glass, rising from the tops
of the interior columns now in place.
One of the main features, he said, would
be the great staircase that would afford
acce ss to all p rt'ons of the building from
the most central point. The circular bal
ustrades, cornices and staircase railings
are to be of wrought and cast iron and the
pavement and wainscoting to a height of
fifteen feet are to be of marble.
The frame for the interior dome will be
a light steel structure and the glass used
will be of the ornamental kind. Mr.
Shea's report concludes as follows:
" I would respectfully recommend as
the only proper course that the general
scheme of decoration for the rotunda as
outlined be approved, to the end that the
space, situated as it is beneath a dome of
greater height than any similar structure
in the country, may present when com
plete such an apnearance as to appeal to
the best taste arid win the approval of the
people."
Mayor Sutro seemed afraid that there
was not enough money in the funds set
aside for the hall to finish the dome on the
plans outlined by Mr. Shea. On beins in
formed that there was abundant money
available to do the work he expressed him
self as mucn pleased with the plans with
the exception of one or two minor details.
He believed that while Architect Shea's
design for the Mosaic floor was very pretty
the Mosaic workers should be allowed to
present their own designs. He also feared
that the marble jvainscoting would be too
expensive.
Attorney Creswell overcame this objec
tion by stating that he understood that
several marble dealers were willing to fur
nish the material at the cost of dress
ing it.
Auditor Broderick was opposed to the
plans on the ground that they were too
elaborate and not in keeping with the or
namentation of the remainder of the build
ing.
" By making the dome bo costly and ar
tistic," he said, " the contrast with the re
mainder of the buildinc will be too great.
It will remind us of a man with a plug hat
and ragged clothes."
After some discussion and some minor
changes, the plans were ordered placed on
file, and Architect Shea was instructed to
receive plans and jpecifications for the
completion of the work.
As the contractors for the exterior of the
dome have been notified that no further
extension of time will be granted them,
the entire structure is in a fair way to be
completed in the near future.

Strange Charges in the Suit
for Belle Wilson's
Estate.
WILLIAM FORD'S FRIEND
How the Mulatto Woman Became
the Ward of a Promi
nent Man.
DISCLAIMED BY HIS PEOPLE.
Claimants Aver It Was an Unholy
Alliance With the Negro Mother
Who Was Rich.
The filific yesterday afternoon in the
County Clerk's office of a petition for the
revocation of the probate of a will brings
to light an extraordinary state ii affairs in
the life of a man who at one time was
prominent as a politician and office-holder
in this City. This man was William Ford,
once a prominent merchant, a politician,
Tax Collector. Fire Commissioner and
) resident of the Board of Fire Cominis-
Bioners.
The action is entitled, "In the matter of
the estate of Isabella Elizabeth "Wilson,
also called Belle E. "Wilson, deceased,
Wilson Davis, Uraphrey Davis, Sarah
Steele, Minerva Hogan and Mary Xetly.
plaintiffs, vs. A. C. Freeze and Heloise
Chamberlain, defendants. "
The defendant, Freese, is the Public Ad
ministrator, and Mrs. Chamberlain, the
proprietress of "The Beresford," is a sister
of the late William Ford.
The petition sets forth that Belle E.
Wilson, as she was called, died in this City
on September 1, 1594, of consumption,
having been a victim of that disease for
many years, and that she died intestate
and left property, real and personal, of the
value of $20,000 or thereabouts; that on the
17th of September, A. C. Freese filed a
document purporting to be the last will
and testament of Belle E. Wilson, in the
following words:
Messrs. O'Farrell & Co.
It's mv desire and wish
that all my property shall
go to Mrs. Ileloise Chamberlain.
Isabella E. Wilson.
San Francisco. August 25, ISO-i.
Witnessâ William Ford, Thomas Palmer. '
That on the 11th of March following
Freese qualified as administrator and^re
ceived his tetters.
Belle E. Wilson was a mulatto, and the
petitioners, who set forth that they are
next of kin. are cousins and residents of
the city of Salisbury, Rowan County, N. C.
Heloise Chamberlain, it is set forth, is a
resident of this City, or no kin to the de
ceased, but in the alleged will is named as
sole devisee and legatee.
Several grounds of contest are set up. i
The first is that Belle E. Wilson "at the \
time of the making of the supposed will
was not of sound and disposing mind, but
on the contrary, was of unsound mind
and mentally and physically incompetent
to make or sign the alleged will, or to
make or sign any will whatsoever."
The secoi d ground is that the alleged .
â will was not her will and the plaintiffs aver,
â¢upon their information end belief, that the
signature to the will is not the signature 1
of said deceased and that the same was
not signed by her, and that the same was
not signed by. any other person in her
presence and by . her direction that the
witnesses purporting to have signed tire
same did not do so at the request of the
deceased nor in the presence of each other.
The third ground of contest is that
Said alleged will of the said deceased was
procured to be made and signed by the said
deceased by means of and as a direct result of
fraud exercised and practiced upon said de
ceased by the persons and in the manner Here
inafter set forth, and on that behalf your
petitioners represent and show:
That the mother of said deceased was one
Eliza Wilson, who died in this City on the 21st
(lay of January, 1593; that one William Ford,
being the une person who purports to have
signed the alleged will of said deceased
as a witness thereof, for many years lived
with the said Eliza Wilson in this
City; that said deceased resided with- paid
couple in their common home from the time
when she was a child of tender ape until the
time of the death of her mother; that the dead
Ileloise Chamberlain, one of the defendants
is a bister of said William Ford, and
at all times mentioned herein has re-
Bided in this City, and during said times
vras au<l Is now engaged in the
business of keeping a lodging-house; that
upon tne death M .r.a Wilson, William Ford
caused and induced the deceased to take
apartments in the lodging-house kept by
Helois'; Chamberlain, and thereupon deceased
moved into defendant's lodging-house and re
mained there until she died on the Ist of Set>
tember, 1894. . . r
Thar i n the 25th of August, 1894, and for a
:ne prior thereto and continually for a
.â .rig time after the death of deceased William
lord an<l Heloise Chamberlain conceived and
entertained the fraudulent purj>ose. de
?:en and intent of gaining for them
servea an undue advantage over th<-se
â ners in the disposition of the
estate of Belle E. AVilron by fraudulently in
ducing her to make a will wherein she would
to them the whole of her estate; tlat
pursuant to the fraudulent purpose, <lesign
and intent Fora importuned deceased
many times within the presence and
hearing of third persons to make a will leaving
her property to him, whereupon deceased al
ways refused to make such will, or anr will,
Baying that she had no intention of mating a
will, and that Bhe would not make a will in
favor of him or of any one else.
Plaintiffs further allege that the real estate
firm of O'Farrell & Co. were the ag-nts of Helle
3". Wilson to manage certain property belong
ing to her and collect the rents therefor, and
Ford knowing this fact drew the will In his own
handwriting and fraudulently represented to
Belle E. Wilson that the s/ime was simply an
order on her agents for money due her/and
that she had no intention of making an in
fi rumen t testamentary in character; that
Ford, in order thereof to better ac
complish his fraud, inserted the name of his
Bister, Heloise Chamberlain, in the instrument
as sole legatee of deceased, for the reason that
he could not be a legatee and a witness at the
anmc time, all of which was done by and with
the consent and concurrence of Heloise Cham
berlain.
Plaiatiffs further allege that deceased fre
quently and during all 6aid times expressed
great dislike ana contempt and hatred
against Heloiso Chamberlain, and they
}iH<i no affection for each other: that
William Ford contrived to and did lime
exclusive access to deceased on the day upon
which, the alleged will purports to have been
made apd signed, and contrived to and did
induce deceased to repose great personal con
fidence in him during all the times herein
mentioned.
In the fourth ground of contest it is set
forth that Belie K. Wilson "was of the age
of 37 years, and for a long time prior to
her death, including and at the time of
making and signing the alleged will,
â vas suffering from consumption and that
the disease produced in her great phy
Â»ical and mental weakness; that by rea
son thereof the deceased, during all said
was rendered weak in body and
und irritable and sensitive and sus
ceptible of flattery and prejudice, and to
the influences and artifices of designing
]'<-rsons, and was also, by disease, unable to
care for herself and wholly dependent
upon those about her; that William Ford
was a confidante of said deceased, and
represented her in dealing with third per
sons, end was consulted by deceased about
her business and peraonal'affairs, and that
deceased depended upon him for advice,
aud acted in accordance with his wishes in
ell things."
The petition closes with a prayer that
tne document admitted to probate be de
creed not to be the last will and testament
or any will of the deceased ; that the let
ters issued to Freese be revoked, and that
the court grant such further relief as is
meet in the premises. Nowlin & Fas-
sett and Napbtaly, Friedenrich & Acker
man are the attorneys for the petitioners.
The document referred to in this peti
tion was filed and after due time an order
of distribution was about to be made when
It was discovered there was an error in the
name, therefore the proceedings were dis
missed and new proceedings commenced.
Mrs. Hcloise Chamberlain is an old lady
now. She comes of a good Southern fam
ily and moved in select society of San
Francisco. Her husband was a well-known
pioneer attorney here, and Mrs. Chamber
lain and her family are highly respected
by people prominent in social life, and she
names some of the best families among
her nearest friends.
She was indignant last night over the
suit, declaring it to be a fraudulent claim
all through and that the court would
eventually decide in her favor. At present
she is landlady of thÂ« Beresford boarding
house on Bush street, and her daughter
conducts the fashionable Sutherland Hotel
on Suttor street.
"I knew nothing of the disposition of
this estate until it was left to me. and
then I was not going to refuse it," she
said. "The property came to me on
account of my brother, who had befriended
those people." I did not seek it. Nobody
has ever yet accused me or any member
of my family of doing wrong, and our rec
ord here in San Francisco from the earli
est days is t>roof of what I say.
"This young woman, Belle Wilson, died
in the Rossmore on Stockton street, and I
was at her side when she passed away. I
had that house at the time. She had a
top room which she furnished herself, and
there she lived like a 1 miser. I understood
that her property consisted of three small
lots and enough money to keep her alive.
But all this is something for the courts to
try, and my attorney, Judge Barry, is at
tending to it.
"I have been informed it is a scheme
between Jake Kauer and Ackerman, and
most certainly 1 know this much; everv
tning in those legal papers is false. Ii is
a monstrous proceeding:, an outrageous
attack on an unsuspecting and defense
less woman.'! ,
BIRTHS NOT REGISTERED.
Why the San Francisco Death
Rate Shows Unfavorably
in Figures.
Physicians Are to Blame for the
Error â A Comparison With
Other Cities.
The Health Office is having much trouble
in inducing physicians to send in reports
i of the births that come under their obser
. vation while engaged in their professional
duties. Owing to the neglect of the med
icos San Francisco has gained an unenvi
able name as a place where the deaths far
outnumber the births and many desirable
peoplp who would otherwise locate here i
are deterred from so doing by this cir
cumstance.
The difference between the birth and
: death rate in San Francisco is believed to
be about the same as m other cities, but
from the showing of the Health Office
books the contrast is very marked. In or
â  der to show physicians and the general I
! public the ill turn they are doing the City |
I by neglecting to register the births that oc
. cur the Health Office has prepared the fol

In Brooklyn and New York the compari
son for the last week in December makes
the following showing:
New Yorkâ Population 1,907,245, deaths
774, births 1254."
Brooklynâ Population 1,105,000, deaths 432
births 005.
Thus it appears that among the large
cities of the country San Francisco is the
only one that has a death rate greater than
the birth rate, an assumption not borne
out by the facts.
BIBLES FOR SOLDIERS.
Work of Quaker Missionaries in
Different Parts of
Japan.
What the United Effort of Three
Great Bible Societies Is Accom
plishing.
The Rev. George Braithwaite of London,
a Quaker missionary representing the
British Bible Society, and the Rev. G.
Binford of Canada, also a Quaker, both of
whom have been engaged in mission work
in Japan, are at the Occidental.
Rev. Mr. Braithwaite has been for ten
years in Japan, and has traveled all over
that country, distributing Bibles ana other
religious literature. He haa been forced to
leave Japan for a time because of rheu
mative fever, and Mr. Binford has come
along to take care of him. It was all the
latter could do to get Mr. Braithwaite off
the steamer Coptic, in which ttrey canje,
and get him up to the hotel.
The reverend gentleman, while lying in
bed, told a Call representative of the work
of scattering Bibles throughout the Mi
kado's realm. He said the British, Amer
ican and National (of Scotland) Bible so
cieties had united in the work of printing
and circulating the BiDle and New Testa
ment in Japan.
"We distributed about 150,000 copies of
the Gospels to the Japanese soldiers dur
ing the recent war," he said, "and over
the Empire we have sent them far and
near. Some of the books were made very
small, in order that the soldiers could carry
them conveniently.
"The Bibles and Gospels are all printed
in Japan and in the Japanese language. We
can print them there far cheaper than we
can elsewhere. The printing and bind
ing of one entire Gospel can be done for
less than 1 cent.
"During the war I wanted a list of books
for soldiers who were about to go to the
front, and from Tuesday morning to Fri
day evening I printed 5000 copies. This
shows the speed at which the work was
done.
"We are making, I think, good progress
with the people, though at times it looks
discouraging."
Mr. Braithwaite will go to San Diego to
try and recuperate. Both he and Mr.
Binford will afterward return to Japan.
A Bad Quartet.
Samuel Olson, a carpenter, was drugged and
robbed of $17 and an overcoat in a lodging
house on Third street, last Thursday night.
Policeman T. L. Ryan was detailed on the case,
and yesterday as a result, Maggie Sullivan was
booked at the City Prison for grand larceny
and petty larceny, Carrie Turner for petty lar
ceny, James Hoy for petty larceny and James
O&tes for vagrancy.

IN THE CLUTCHES OF CRITICS.
Everybody Has Something to Show You
and the Entertainment Is Varied
and Novel.
People who are troubled -with that tired
feeling should drop around to the exhibi

street, and fall into the clutches of some
critic who wants to explain thiugs to those
who will listen.
As a rule the critic is easy to spot, but at
the Arts and Crafts exhibition be appears
in the most unexpected guises and crops
up all over the place.
If you feel a hand on your shoulder and
hear a pleading voice begging you to come
over to such-and-such a place and see
something line, the best thing you can do
is to get right over there at once and have
done with it.
"Come with me," says the voice, "attd

the old masters and you will not tind one
equal to this particular produc â "
"Who made it?" ytm may inquire.
"I did," answers the critic in astonish
ment.
Then the voice comes into your ear
again and another hand firmly draws you
to the old books. "These," says the per-

you, "are the oldest books in the entire
world, bar none. There is a written testi
monial from the curator of the British
Museum that this volume of Shakespeare
is the first ever issued and is worth a great
many pounds. At the further end of that
case is a cony of the Rig Veda, the oldest

There various ways to tell old books,
but it would be a difficult task for one to
explain. This case of books is worth some

them by the Kensington Muse â "
"May I ask to whom they belong?"
"Why, certainly. To me."
"Come here just a moment, I want to
show you a black-and-white picture,"
says another voice, and you are hauled
clear across the room. "Here we have
something that is destined to go down to
history as one of the linest things ever
made by any artist west of New York.
Observe that Gustav Dore effect. Prob
ably not another artist in the country has
succeeded in getting that effect tins

understand as the masterpiece in black
and white among the entire collection of
pictures."
"Yes, I see it is good and the artist's
name is ."
"That's me," he answers, without a
blush and without an apology to Lindley
Murray.;
No sooner have you recovered from the
shock of this description than you are
gently led among tbe posters. "Do you

your informant. "That is by all means
the finest specimen hi all this collection.
None compare with it in any way. Peo
ple stand spellbound before it and are ap
palled at its richness and remarkable
drawing. Did you ever see anything with
so much force and character in it?"
"I never did. To whose collection does
it belong?"
"To mine."
"Ah!" exclaimed the man who is de
voted to zinc plates, "here's the thing to
see. I want you to have a close look at
this specimen. Now take it in your hands
and hold it just so in the light and you
will see that it is perfect in every line.
See? Can't you see it? Just a little more
toward the window so the light will strike
the surface. There you are. There you
are. Isn't it a magniticent piece of work?
The other zinc cuts here are really no
good, but this is perfect. How do you
like it?"
"Very much, indeed, and may I ask who
made it?"
"1."
No sooner have you been appalled by
this latter information than you are told
to hasten over to the fine bindings.
"Now, take that book in your hands
and examine it closely, my dear sir.
Is it not the finest work you ever
saw? All I ask you to do is to exam
ine it from an unprejudiced standpoint.
So you have looked it over carefully, have
you? Well, all right. Would y OU like to
know who bound that book?"
"Yes."
"Our nouse," and the gentleman who
knew his business tucked tne volume back
in the case.
A little later the visitor begins to realize
that all the finest things in the collection
are those which he is shown, and it is gen
erally a safe bet that the individual who
created or owns any of them is the best
informed regarding their superior points
and is, consequently, competent to dis
cuss them.
By the time you have gone the rounds
you are convinced that the best specimens
[of printir â¢. binding, painting and draw

j great deal that does not gHtter is irold.
But it is really a fine collection, and a
credit to San Tranciscp, despite the gen

and producers.

THE BIG BUILDING INSPECTED.
Illuminated From Basement to Garret
for the Edification of the Many
Visitors.
Electric lights blazed in every part of
the Youner Men's Christian Association
building last night. The great structure
was open for inspection from the garret to
the gymnasium, natatorium and shooting
gallery in the basement, and several hun
dred men, young and old, traveled over it
after having listened to a specially inter
esting programme in the auditorium.
The "evening" was given to celebrate the
forty-third anniversary of the association.
A great many invitations bad been given
out with the idea of introducing to young
men not members the many advantages of
the institution. The entertainment was
successful in every way.
General W. H. L. Barnes was the speaker
of the evening. He was introduced by
Louis J. Titus, and announced that there
was one thing in which he took great com
fort. That was, that though he might say
the wrong thing in the right place, yet he
was in no danger of saying the "right
thing in the wrong place, ana â getting
lined for it."
Here he paused. Then the audience re
membered Secretary McCoy's experience
with Judge Murphy during the Durrant
trial and it was several minutes before the
speaker could proceed.
General Barnes declared that he was
heartily in sympathy with the movement
being carried on by the Young Men's
Christian Association. He had, when a
boy, looked with pity and something of
aversion on the "good young man." But
the "good young man" then was usually
thin, lean, round-shouldered ana wore
spectacles. The gymnasiums were gen
erally in the smallest of back buildings,
and the young men who used them were
looked upon as being on the highway to
the devil.
The speaker contrasted this state of
affairs with the picture he had seen when
he had stepped one evening into the gym
nasium of the association. He saw in it
the greatest exhibition he could remember
of general culture and desirable develop
ment in young men.
General Barnes then urged upon his
hearers the necessity of applying them
selves to getting knowledge. The neces
sity of not neglecting opportunities, he de
clared, made him so provoked with some
ministers when he heard them sniveling
and whining that he at times wanted to
do personal violence to them.
One of the features of the evening was
the performance of the "Fin deSiecle"
orchestra, consisting of Miss H. Hill, lirst
violin; Frank Kupple, piano; C. T. Auger,
flute; E. Cowan, first violin; A. B. Levy,
cornet; A. Nidder, 'cello; A. Greenbaum,
clarionet, and E. Oppenheiraer, second
violin. The Knickerbocker Quartet of
male voices sang several songs and was
encored at every appearance. Dr. W. P.
Sprague recited "Falstaff's Imaginary
Encounter" and he was recalled twice.
Before the conclusion of the programme,
Secretary H. J. McCoy told how tlie build
ing had been planned for the young
men of the City in onier that every phase
of moral, social and physical development
should be assisted and provided for.
And the only requirement made in order
to Bhare these benefits was that a "man
should be a man."
When the audience was dismissed, it
broke up into small groups. These were
guided through the building by mem
bers of the association, and at the sight
of the splendid accommodations there
were many expressions of surprise that
they could be given for the small sum re
quired. _____________
Human Nature During a Panic.
Baltimore's terrible casualty was not a
lesson ; it was an exhibit. It showed how
strong is animal instinct in human nature
that has not been trained by education of
both mind and body. The details of the
catastrophe indicate that most of those
who participated in the fatal panic were
people who had never learned self-control
or practiced cool reasoning. They had an
instinctive idea that tire meant death to
all in its way, and when the cry was raised
they started, as so many timid animals
would, to fly for safety, without waiting to
ascertain whether or not they were in dan
ger. It would be as idle to use this inci
dent as a lesson to others who may be in
a theater when a cry of tire is raised as it
would have been to try to argue with this
panic-stricken crowd in its wild flight.
Alky one who has mind enough at such a
time to look about him and see where tne
danger is, if there be any, has wit enough
to avoid panic, but the frequent oocur
rente of just such incidents as this shows
what lies under the superficial stratum of
modern education and intellectual devel
opment.âPhiladelphia Ledger.

NEW YORK. N. V., Jan. 21.'â Business at the
Stock Exchange continues dull, the sales to-day
footing up only 139,000 shares. The opening of
the market was strong; prices in the first half hour
of trading having advanced ' i@l ' 4 per cent. The
rise was bused on Washington advices that the
outlook for a speed] settlement of the Venezuelan
boundary question had improved. The Impres
sion that the new Government bond loan will be
heavily over-subscribed also ltd to some buying at
this time. The engagement of $2,500,000 gold
bars for shipment to Europe announced a: an
early hour was ignored so far us the stock market
was concerned, and the rumors of heavy ship
ments late in the week also fell Hat.
In the afternoon the Industrials and Western
Union ruled weak. Chicago Gas fell from 66y a to
641-j on reports from Chicago that the secretary
of suite of Illinois on thendviceof Attorney-Gen

right the matter, Tobacco was. feverish, ranging
between 77 i â â¢ and 791,8, closing at 78 bid. West

earnings and increased competition.
The market closed barely steady. Net changes

â  j CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, Jan. 21âValnes were rather
soft at the opening to-day, some of the grain that
was bought yesterday seeking purchasers this
morning. The advancing tendency which was
shown around yesterday's close was checked by
fair receipts at Chicago and in the Northwest, 138
and 342 car* respectively, ana by the indifference
of the Liverpool market, which advanced VÂ»d on a
reported poor demand. Pit traders turned'"buyers
in the first half hour and succeeded In bringing
about a rally later, affording support to prices
through constant purchases. The world's ship
ments for last week officially reported by tne
Board of Trade were 5.139.000 bushels. Local in
spections from store were 95,694 bushels. Export
clearances were liberal at 450,151 bushels, Includ
ing wheat and flour.
Kradstreet's reports on stocks proved disappoint
in? to holders who found in the comparatively
moderate decrease In the world's visible supply of
1,937,000 bushels reason for disposing of the wheat
bought earlier. Prices became decidedly weak
declining to - puts. Closing Continental cables
were lower. May wheat opened from- Glfigc
to Â«13/se, sold between 6iya and 02i^c, closing at
61 Vs@t>l Vzc. V2 C under yesterday, mated re
ceipts for to-morrow, 56 cars. .
CORN â Responded promptly to the advances
and declines in wheat.' The trade possessed no
particular merit, an ordinary business being trans
acted. Liverpool cables were quiet and i/id higher.
' Receipts were 871 cars. There were no withdraw
als from store. Bradstreet's reported an intrease in
Available stocks of 1,4.08,000 bushels. Export
clearances were 382,774 bushels. May corn opened 1
at 291/ic sold between 29 Vg and 29fy8C, closing at
29y B @29Vic, VB@Vic under yesterday. . Esti
mated receipts tor to-morrow. 380 cars. .
' OATSâ The market was quiet, with the trade un
eventful. The tone was In sympathy with that of
wheat and corn. Receipts were 363 cars. No oats
were taken from store. , Bradstreet's gave an in
crease In available stocks of 378,000 bushels. May j
closed V8'? ;l lower than yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 210 cars.
FLAX WbÃ steady to firm. Cash, 9iy 2 @92c;
May, 9f> ! <4(ai96 l /Â±c. Receipts were 28 cars.
PRO Although not booming in the
way which was seen yesterday, provisions were
nevertheless strong and disposed to rise h gher to- 1

the yards with prices 5c higher. The bog question
being the vital consideration in product naturally
prices for the latter made gains. Prompted by the
weakness of grain, holders were induced to sell
later, reactions taking place all around. May pork

OLD CONFEDEEATE SONGS.
They Are Sung Again for Charity in
15alt imoro.
The audience at Music Hall Tuesday
night was in fancy transported for two
hours into the sunny land of cotton by the
unique character of the programme of an
entertainment gotten up for the purpose of
aiding in the purchase of additional ground
for the Confederate burying lot in London
Park.
Familiar old plantation songs were sung
in chorus and played by a military band,
but the energetic "Jonnny Rebs" who got
up the programme were determined to
pive a rare treat to themselves and those
of their comrades who were fortunate
enough to listen to the entertainment. So
they put "Dixie" on the programme in
four or five places, had "Stonewall Jack
son's Way" and their own Maryland Line
camp song rendered by good singers, and
in addition published a fancy programme
pamphlet, in which were printed these and
half a dozen others of a similar character,
among them '"Maryland, My Maryland,"
and "The Bonnie Blue Flae." On the
title-page was printed in colors the em
blem of the Maryland Line Association â
the flags of the Confederacy and the State
of Maryland blended.
"Dixie" got a creat welcome every time.
No sooner would the band get as far as the
third or fourth bar of its swinging march
melody than the whole audience would
burst into cheers, while many of them
beat time with their feetâ on its third
repetition one gray-haired Confederate in
the center of the lower floor could no
longer restrain himself, but let out with
all the lung power of which he was
capable the ear-piercing "rebel yell" of
thirty years ago.
"ifncle Dan Emmett, the veteran min
strel, who Wrote "Dixie," is making a fare
well tour of the country this year. He is
more than 80 years old, and the only part
which he takes in the minstrel "show
which he accompanies is to lead the or
chestra while his famous composition is
sung. He wrote "Dixie" originally for
Bryant's minstrels before the war. Scores
of new verses were written to the melody
after it had spread, tut this is the way he
wrote it :
I wish I was In de land ob cotton,
'Oimraon seed and sandy bottom,
Look a-way, look 'way, a-way, Dixie land.
In Dixey's land, where I was born in,
Early on one frosty mornin'.
Look a-way, look 'way, a-way, Dixieland,
Den I wish i was in Dixie.
CHORUS.
Hooray! Hooray:
In Dixie's land we"'ll take our stand,
To lib an' die in Dixie.
A-way, a-way, away down South In Dixie,
A-way, a-way, away down South Irf Dixie.

question should be Mr. Taggart's.
Another document he has is a copy of
the Washington Globe of 1342, which re
fers to a bill for the relief of William T.

The Harrison-street School was accepted
from the contractors, although somemem
t^ers of the board expressed themselves as
not at all satisfied with the way the work
was done.
The rule requiring teachers to reside in
Alameda County was so changed as not to
affect teachers employed at the time the
rule was adopted.
The hour of closing the High School

any great opposition. The earlier was
chosen only two weeks ago, but was not at
all satisfactory.

OAKLAND. Cm., Jan. 21.â The town

burglars.

had examined it, and so to get into it
thr<;e holes were bored in the front of the
safe in the vicinity of the lock. A fuse
was left in this, they evidently having
been Bcar*d away before having had an
opportunity to complete their job.

taken last night to continue the show to
Saturday night. The exhibition will,
therefore, close to-morrow (Wednesday)

brought about by the desire of some of the

originally stipulated. To-day's attendance
was very large, and there will be a special

Oakland Office San Frakcisoo Call,)
90S Broadway, Jan. 21. f
William H. Fair was elected Chief of the

Commissioners Wilson and Peirsol. Mayor
Davie said that the present chief was one
of the most efficient ever in office, and did
not attend the meeting.
For several weeks the two commission
ers have been manipulating a change, but
OAKLAND'S FIRE CHIEF, WILLIAM 11. FAIR.
[From a photograph.]
bo much pressure was brought to bear
on them in behalf of Fred Campbell that
they hesitated till to-day. Yesterday an
other candidate appeared in the person of
G. W. Woodward, a well-known Grand
Army man and a member of several secret
orders. He petitioned the board, and it
was thought that as Peirsol is aG. A. R.
man Woodward would be accepted as
a compromise candidate. But this after
noon a resolution was read by the clerk
declaring the office of Chic of tne lire
Department vacant. Both commissioners
voted aye, and the resolution appointing
Fair was introduced and passed by the
same votp.
W. H. Fair is the engineer who refused
to take the train out of Sacramento that
was taken on its fatal journey by Sam
(Mark, who perished on the demolished
bridge. He has never been heard of in
politics and his fight was a short one. He
first thought he would like to be a police
man and his application is now on file. A
few weeks ago he became more ambitious
and thought he would like to be Chief of
the Fire Department. He made his fight
quietly and won. He is an expert en
gineer and has passed the Southern Pa
cific examination, but since the 3trike the
railroad has not had an engine for him.
Fair's appointment was to have been
made last week, but it was delayed and it
was stated that his chance was gone. At
noon to-day Campbell and Woodward
both felt confident, but as events proved
their hooes were groundless.
Unless the Council passes an ordinance
creating an office of first, assistant Chief
Fair will have his hands full. An ordi
nance was passed last night abolishing the
position of second assistant chief and Fire
Warden and the ordinance creating the
office of first assistant and Fire Warden
was beaten. A3 the first assistant's office
was abolished three months ago Chief
Fair is much more at the head of the de
partment than any of his predecessors.
MRS. COOPER CONFESSES
She Tells a Berkeley Audience
Why She Is a Woman
Suffragist.
Dr. Wendte a Sympathizerâ A Stu-
dent Unmercifully Beatenâ Mr.
Morford's Death.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 21.-Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper told a large audience at the
Congregational Church of Berkeley to
night how she came to be a woman suf
fragist. Prior to her remarks Rev. Dr.
Wendte of Oakland gave a brief address,
in which he referred to the few privileges'
which women were allowed to enjoy only
a short time ago, what a change for the
better in their behalf has taken place in the
last decade, and what greater things for
them are yet to come.
"I am a woman suffragist." said he, "be
cause I was born one, because it was bred
into my very bones. I would be glad to
see many men to-day driven out of posi
tions which they hold to gi7e way for
women who are far more competent to fill
them. I hope to see the time," said Dr.
Wendte, "when women will bo professors
in the University of California. There
are many women in the country to-day
whom I dare say are well able to fill such
positions with the greatest of credit. Any
influence which wili tend to broaden the
sphere of woman surely will tend to better
the community."
Mrs. Sargent, president of the State Suf
frage Society, interposed a few remarks.
She entered a strong plea for the passage
of the amendment to the State constitu
tion striking out the word "male."
Mrs. Cooper followed in her character
istic forcible manner of address. She said
that in asking for the privilege of voting
woman is not seeking charity, but justice.
"The logic of experience for the. past
seventeen years," said Mrs. Cooper,
"has taught me that woman cannot do
justice to horself, her friends and her
country without the right of citizenship.
"The statement has been made that
women are good and pure because they
are out of politics. It is a poor rule that
does not work both ways. If it works so
well on the women why not try it awhile
on the men? Where is there a just man
who will say that men should do tne voting
and women pay the taxes? If men will
continue to hang the women, they at least
ought to be permitted to ask the reason
why. The right to freedom and the right
to vote spring from the same origin. Laws
should not be made for man nor for
woman, but for mankind. The rights of
men and women should ever be reciprocal.
Political nght9 reserve no sex, and there
fore the word 'male' should be stricken
from the State Constitution of California.
"Men of California, it is for you to decide
whether woman shali receive her just in
heritance; it is for you to determine
whether she shall have equal political
rights and equal responsibility with yon in
the administration of State and National
affairs."
A Student Unmercifully Beaten. |
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 21.â Harry
Rodgers, Â« student in Boone's Academy,
was the victim of an unmerciful and un
provoked Hogging on Saturday night by a
number of university students, for whose
arrest he swore out warrants to-day. He
was returning home from San Francisco
on a late train and after Reaving Berkeley
station was assaulted by the students,
i who he says were in a high state of in
j toxication. They claimed as a reason for
giving him a drubbing that he had been
| paying an undue amount of attention to a
1 certain young lady fri?nd of theirs.
This Rodgers flatly denied. Without
further preliminaries they threw their vic
tim on the railroad tracK, where each took
a turn at giving him a round of hard
! blows. Rodgers blew a police whistle,
; which wa3 responded to by a night watch
man, who stated ttiat it was out of his line
of business to lend assistance to any one
in that kind of trouble; that he was em
> ployed by the storekeepers to watcti their
, places of business at night. After an hour
iof cuffing the university men allowed
Rodgers to go. He has sworn out three
j John Doe warrants for their arrest. An
attempt was made to serve them 7 to-day,
1 but without avail.
Death of Mr. Mnrfnr.l.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 21.â An inquest
was held to-day on the body of Charles
A. Morford of Lincoln street, North
Berkeley, the bookkeeper in the employ of
D. P>erdine & Co. of San Francisco who
was instantly killed last nieht at Berry
man station, North Berkeley, by the
engine of the local train.
The Coroner's jury, after sitting for two
hours, returned a verdict of accidental
death.
Mr. Morford was unmarried and lived
witn his sister, Mrs. A. M. Kennedy, near
| the corner of Edith and Lincoln streets.
! The jury recommended that the Board of
i Town Trustees pass an ordinance com
pelling the Southern Pacific Company to
maintain suitable lights at Berryman sta
tion and all other stations within the town
, limits of Berkeley.
Berkeley's Truant Officer.
BEBLELEY, Cal., Jan. 21.â At the
! meeting of the Board of Education last
night it was decided to retain the services
of Truant Officer Esmond who was ap
pointed a short time ago as an experiment.
| Reports as to the work he has accom
! plished in the various districts were made
i oy himself and by the teachers whonq
i truant pupils he has been able to discover.
I Principal Waterman stated that the mere
fact that a truant officer is in town keeps
many boys from running away from
school.
Director Norton stated that the Lorin
school is badly overcrowded, and accord
ingly suggested that an addition be made
to the building. Plans for the annex will
be presented at the next board meeting.
Want the Managership.
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 21.-Clas9 and
varsity politics are again forming the
topics for discussion in the corridors of the
university buildings. In addition to the
candidates for the various class offices
come the aspirants for tha fi foot
ball managership, which is probably
the most important and responsible
position to be entrusted to a student.
Those who have made themselves known
p.Â» candidates for this position are Dwight
Hutchinson '98, J. F. Rein bard t '97 and
F. P. Taylor '97. All three of these men
are experienced players on the gridiron,
lieinhardt having played left tackle in the
last intercollegiate.
1 c (torn of Guardianship Secured.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Jan. 21.â Two years
ago George W. Blakeley, who lived at
Lorin with^his wife and family, was sent to
the Agnews asylum.
The children were sent to the Temescal
home, and with the exception of an occa
sional visit to the home Mrs. Blakeley has
disappeared. Their house, partially built,
has been permitted to go to ruin, and now
Blakeley's affairs are to be straightened
out by his friends. They obtained letters
of guardianship over the children to-day,
and it is supposed that this will cause the
mother to come forward and help in un
ravetiog the business tangle of her hus
band.

PERSECUTING A CHILD
Rev. Dr. Hobart Investigates
the Case of Laura
Fusch.
WITH A CHRISTIAN FAMILY.
A Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Who Has
Been Made a Victim of Calumny
. and Spite.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 21. j
Although little Laura Fusch is con
scientiously doing her duty as a domestic
in an East Oakland family, and although
Rev. Dr. Hobart and Mrs. Eddy of the
First Baptist Church have pronounced the
cruel calumny as being viciously false, the
Jocal agent of the Chilren's Society is still
searching for the girl.
4l Dr. Hobart and myself went out to the
place where Laura is engaged, this after
noon," said Mrs. Af. J. Eddy to-night, "and
we found that she went there within a~
couple of hours of leaving the Dlace where
she was employed in the dining-room.
The story of the young lady as published
in yesterday's Call is true in every
particular. The story first published
was a cruel wrong, and to repeat it
without any investigation is heartless.
Mrs. I'rescott's conduct is beyond my
comprehension. She is in office for the
purpose of preventing cruelty to children,
and in this case she is actually causing
cruelty. If she had come to us we could
have willingly told her the truth."
Miss Laura Fusch was seen to-day and
said she had never spoken to any reporter
except a Call man. "The story pub
lished in to-day's Chronicle is a very cruel
one." she said. "No one came to see me,
although it would have been an easy mat
ter to find me. It says I went back to the
hotel a few days alter the 'elopement' it
talks about and said that 'the partner
ship' I made with the two men was not
satisfactory and I had broken it off. I
took everything belonging to rr.e from the
hotel when I came to this house, and I
have never been back there since and
have not seen any one connected with the
hotel."
The situation in regard to Laura Fusch
would be ludicrous did it not cause pain
and anguish to an innocent little sufferer.
She was visited to-day by the Rev. Dr.
Hobart and Mrs. Eddy," and yet the agent
says the society is making "strenuous
efforts" to "rescue" her. All her ac
quaintances at the church sympathize
with her, and are doing their best to set
matters right. Members of the church
who have investigated the matter declare
that "the story of the elopement with the
bibulous cook and porter have been told
by the proprietor of the Hotel Wilson out
of spite, because the girl left without giv
ing notice."
Laura is but a child, 15 years of age, and
the influential First Baptist Church is
determined that her good name shall be
preserved.
Mrs. Prescott said to-night that the in
terview attributed to her in to-day's papers
is false. She says she is only trying to get
the facts in the case, and up to the present
time she has only succeeded in hearing
the side of the story told by the girl's late
employers.
WATCHED BY AN OFFICER
Sad Plight of Two of the Per-
formers in "Old Ken-
tucky."
Chickens That Were Not the Work
of the Propertyman's
Art.
There are a couple â of obscure actors in
the "Old Kentucky" Company, now play
ing at the California Theater, whose names
do not figure on the programme, and who
have never in any way sought to advertise
themselves. Notoriety,- however, has been
thrust upon them.
It was on account of these actors that an
officer, representing the majesty of the
law, went to the California Theater, hright
and early last, night, and having secured
a seat in the first row, which commanded
an uninterrupted view of the stage, he
watched the performance with the/ stern
and judicial air of a man who is ready to
make an arrest at a moment's notice
if circumstances are grave enough to war
rant it. During the second act, when the
two actors hold what in tiieatrical par
lance is known as the left center of the
stage, the officer redoubled his attentions.
His object was twofold; he wished to see
whether he would be justified in making
any arrest and he also wished to assure
himself that the two actors were of flesh
and blood and not property dummies.
It must be explained that tha actors,
though alive, are not human beings but
chickens. Their modest share in the en
tertainment is to stay in a coop till a
pickaninny yanks one of them into the
glamor of the footlights, plays upon its
feathered back as if it were a violin and
afterward makes it perform a pas seul to
the inspiring music of a breakdown.
On Monday night there were spectators
in the audio nee who did not leiish the
chicken's share in the entertainment, and
yesterday several of them called upon Sec
retary Charles Holbrook of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
lodged complaint. The burden of their
allegation was that the pickatininy han
dled" the bird with unnecessary roughness
and that he banged its little feet roughly
on the rloor, as well as flashed it before the
footlights in a manner that terrified the
little creature and cansed it to endure men
tal anguish, as well as bodily pain.
"If the charges made were not exagger
ated," said Secretary Holbrook yesterday,
"the chicken is being tormented, and we
can put a stop to its further appearance
on the stage. It is our duty to investigate
complaints, but we have to be quite sure
that it is not a dummy chicken. There
was a baby at the Bush-street Theater
onee â but that's another story. The
propertyman in that case was cleverer
than most of his kind."
Secretary Holbroot's officer, who at
tended the theatert last night, will report
that the chickens are alive and that they
are of the common or barnyard variety,
when he meets his chief this morning.
What else he will report is not to be
divulged until to-day, out if the alleged
bodily pain and intense anguish have im
pressed tnemselves iiDon the officer's mind
it i 3 probable that both chickens wilt have
to retire permanently from the stage as a
profession.
MICHAEL M'CARTHY'S PLAINT.
He Begins Stilt Against William Blaney
for 8399 for Malicious Arrest.
Michael McCarthy has begun suit in the
Justice Court against William Blaney for
.$299 for malicious arrest.
McCarthy was arrested on November 4,
1895, on a warrant sworn out by Blaney
charging him with threats against life, and
was imprisoned for twenty-four hours in
the City Prison, being compelled to give
$500 to secure his release. On being beard
the case was dismissed.
McCarthy alleges that "many persons,
whose names are unknown to him, hearing
of the said arrest and supposing the plain
tiff to be a criminal, have erased to respect
him, and he has been otherwise injured in
his good name and reputation and health,
and whereby and by means whereof he
hath sustained damages in the sum of ?299."
INSULTING LADIES.
H. Skirm and Philip Waltz Convicted
by Judge Conlan of Disturbing
tbe Peace.
H. Stirm and Philip Waitz, the two
agents for enlarged photographs, appeared
in Judge Conlan's court yesterday morning
to answer to the charge of disturbing the
peace. Captain Gillin was present to prose
cute the cases.
Mrs. J. W. Coffey, 2830 Sixteenth street,
Â«nd Miss Annie Williams, who were in
sulted by the two defendants on Monday
afternoon, gave theirtestimony, which was
in effect tnat the men tried to* force their
wares on the ladies, and that when the
ladies refused to buy the intruders in
dulged in vile and insulting language.
The Judge commented severely upon the
conduct of the defendants. "If I had been
around the house at the time," he said, "I
can assure you, you would have been laid
up in the hospital for as long as I intend
to sentence you." He expressed his re
gret that no greater charge could be placed
against them, but he intimated that he
would give them the full penalty.
Prosecuting Attorney Hogan expressed
himself in similar terras, and requested
that the severest penalty be administered.
The defendants were ordered into cus
tody and will appear for sentence to-day.

THE CAREER OF MAGUIRE
Incidents in the Life of a
Veteran Manager of
Theaters.
HE ACQUIRED GREAT WEALTH.
The Houses of the Drama Which He
Established and Managed in
This City.
Thomas Maguire, whose death in New
York waa announced by the dispatches
published yesterday, held sway in San
Francisco as a manager of theaters for
nearly a quarter of a century. At one
time during a period of his greatest pros
perity he was reputed to be worth a mil
lion dollars, yet the wires say he was des
titute when he died, depending for sup
port on a pittance from the Actors' Fund.
Thomas Maguire came to San Francisco
from New York in 1840. He was then
about 25 years of age. Not much is known
of his early life in New York beyond the
fact that iie was a hack-driver. When he
went East in 1864 he wore diamonds, dis
played a superb golden watch and had
plenty of money to spend. He put up at
the Metropolitan Hotel, and while making
night rounds was robbed of money and
jewelry. He made a protest against the
hack-drivers whom he suspected, and de
manded restitution on the ground that he
was once a New York hackman him
self. The story goes that they refused to
surrender tne spoils on the ground that
Maguire was rich and could stand the loss.
He acquiesced in that view of the case and
no arrests followed the incident.
In 1652 Maguire built the Jenny Lind
inoraas .naguire, me veteran l beater
Manager, Whose Heath In Destitute
Circumstances in New York Was Re
ported in Yesterday's Dispatches.
[From a photograph taken in 7575.J
Theater. It was on Kearny street, near
Washington, on what is now the middle
lot of the old City Hall site. On the
Washington and Kearny street corner was
the famous El Dorado.and on the Mer
chant street corner adjoining the Jenny
Lind was the Union Hotel. The ground
covered by the three buildings was subse
quently sold by Maguire to the City and
the City Hall erected thereon.
Tlie enterprising manager purchased the
San .Francisco Hotel on the north side of
Washington street, between Kearny and
Montgomery. He tore down that build
ing, and in 1854 erected on the same site
Manure's Opera-house. In that house
many of the "greatest actors that the world
lias produced were presented for the first
time to the playgoers of San Francisco.
Maguire secured for his theater the best
talent available, and success seemed to
smile on his ventures.
In 1862 he built the Academy of Music
on Pine street, and then his misfortunes
began. The venture broke him and he
never rallied again to maintain success for
a prolonged period. He leased the Eureka
Theater an Montgomery street, between
Pine and California, but'the business there
was not profitable. Mr. Maguiri's last
active work in this City was performed as
manager of the Baldwin Academy of
Music, now the Baldwin Theater. In" 1875
Mr. Baldwin built the house and in 1876
the theater was opened under the manage
ment of Tom Maguire. In 1878 or 1879
Maguire went East and resided there until
hi 9 death.
Old timers Who knew Maguire well
assert that much of his prosperity achieved
at the Maguire Opera-house on Washing
ton street was due to the excellent business
qualities of his first wife, whose maiden
name was Douglass.
Victim of an Explosion.
Welch Hanlon, the old man who while work
ing for Contractor Perrine in a quarry near
the Seven-mile House on November 9 was
horribly injured by a premature explosion,
died at the City and County Hospital yester
day. At the time of the accident Hanlon, who
\va? C>o years old, was "tamping" a hole which
had just been "sprung." The powder of the
fuse became ignited by the intense heat and
the explosion followed without warning of any
kind. Hanlon's right arm was blown off and
his eyes were burned. His companion also
lost his eyes.
Kate â Just look, these boots are ever
so much too big. Maryâ Yes; you must
have given him the number of the street
instead of the number of your shoe.â

JOSEPH C. PIERCE DEAD.
A Former Berkeley Athlete Sud
denly Expires at Santa
Barbara.
WAS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM.
Prominent at the State University
and a Member of All the
Varsity Teams.
Hiram Pierce, a Santa Barbara lumber
merchant, who arrived from the south a
few days ago, on a business and pleasure
trip to this City, left for his home last
night by rail, in response to a telegram
announcing the sudden and unexpected
death of his young brother, Joseph, yester
day morning.
Joseph C. Pierce was well known in San
Francisco and vicinity during his college
days at Berkeley, for among his fellow-col
legians there was probably never a more
generally popular man than "jolly Joe"
Pierce.
Prominent in athletics from the time he
I entered college in '91 with tUe claÂ« of '95,
he established at Berkeley an unprece
dented record as an all-round athlete. He
, was center rush on the varsity football
I team, catcher on the varsity baseball team,
a weight thrower and tug-of-war's man on
the varsity track team, a member of the
varsity crew, a member of the varsity band
and of the Chi Phi Fraternity.
But more than for his ability as an ath
lete Pierce was liked as a good fellow, for
he was the personification of the jovial,
light-hearted young collegian.
Handsome, over'six feet in height, and
weighing over 200 pounds, he was a fine
physical specimen of California manhood.
His college course was suddenly cut
short about two years ago by the death of
his father, followed a few months later by
the death of his bister. After leavins the
State University young Pierce took charge,
with his brother, of his father's lumber
business and became a member of the
firm, one of the oldest in Southern Cali
fornia.
Blood Poison the Cause.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 21.â
Joseph Charles Pierce, aged 23, died in
Santa Barbara this morning of blood
poisoning, the result of an absceas formed
during an attack of tonsilitis.
Visitors to the Santa Barbara flower fes
tival last spTine will remember Pierce as
the merry clown who, with several of his
friends in outlandish costume, drove a
hoary mule decorously clad in pantalettes.
The frolics of this merry band, whose
identity was carefully concealed at the
time, and in all of which Mr. Pierce was
the ringleader, performing the most ex
traordinary acrobatic feats to the delight
of spectators, was the one touch of genu
ine fun whicii relieved the esthetic strain
of the festival.
The dead man's only brother and busi
ness partner, Hiram Pierce, is in San Fran
cisco, and the funeral will not take
place until after his return on Thursday
afternoon.
RICH MINES IN CHINA
A Local Chinese Millionaire Is
Soon to Help Develop
Them.
Several Hundred Thousand Dollars*
Worth of Machinery to Be
Shipped.
Lee Wee, one of the leading wholesale
merchants and importers of the Chinese
district, has gone into mining. He has
been in San Francisco since 1852, most of
the time a merchant.
Within the past few years he determined
to be a n-iner of Chinese gold and silver,
and within the next two or three months
half a million dollars' worth of muchinerv
will be shipped to the empire from this
City.
It is well known to students of history
that the superstition of the people has
retarded, if not absolutely prevented, the
opening and development of gold, silver,
copper and other mines in China. If the
body of a long-ago-departed Celestial is
known to repose in a hillside, the miner
must be intrepid to bury so much as the
point of his pick in that precious soil.
Lee Wee knows this as well as anybody,
and, in speaking of the superstition of his
countrymen yesterday, said: "It's all fool
ishness. I'm as good a Crnnaman as any
of them, but 1 don't believe in any of that
stuff. I live too long in the United States."
LeeÂ»Wee is too shrewd to embark in a
wildcat scheme or to invest his thousands
in an enterprise for the development of
mines unless he knows that he can get at
those mines despite the prevailing super
stition?. His agents are in communica
tion with the Lmperor, and Lee Wee did
not come to a definite conclusion until lie
was officially assured that his expensive
machinery and operations would be pro
tected.
Lee Wee, though an officer in the Nine;
Yung Company, one of the largest Chi
nese organizations in the United States, is
very much American in his ideas. Ho
educated three of his relatives, Nep Yune,
Yung Kin Song and Tou Chong, at the
university, and also procured a special
instructor for them in mineralogy, mining
and civil engineering. Two of the sons
are now in China, and the third one re
cently returned with a large collection of
ore specimens. Some of the ore from the
province of Quong Soy, near Canton, is
very rich, assaying as high as $800 a ton.

MANUFACTURERS TANGLED
Changed the By-Laws and Will
Hold an Election in
February.
SEVERAL DIRECTORS OBJECTED.
A Proposition to Hold a Home Product
Exposition in the Pavilion Next
April.
The directors of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association met yesterday and
it was the most important meeting held
since its incorporation last September.
Two propositions were under considera
tion, the holding of a grand home indus
try exposition in the Mechanics' Pavilion
and the holding of an election of directors
next month. The second was the most
important, for according to several of the
directors it involves points that are not
fully understood. In other words, they are
satisfied that there is a dusky complex
ioned gentleman in the association's fuel
aggregation.
At a special # meetin- last week the presi
dent, H. T. Scott, sprung a surprise upon
the majority of the board by advocating
that the second convention of manufac-
turers be held in the latter^part of next
month; that the board of directors resign
and that an election of a new board be
held. He explained that the association's
lirst board of directors was elected a year
ago and that when the association was in
corporated last September another board
of eleven directors was elected by the
stockholders to continue in office for one
year. However, he added there are many
members who have the idea in their minds
that the annual election should be held in
March, instead of September. He for one
did not desire to have the appearance of
hanging on 10 the position. He desired
the members, although they are not stock
holders, to have something to say as to who
should be the directors.
This proposition was sprung upon the
meeting immediately after another rumpus
had been patched up. A week before Di
rector Sprouie had made an effort to re
move Secretary Mead, Assistant Secretary
Dingle and Promoter (recently named
manager) Tacy from office. A private
letter showed that he wanted to place his
friend Professor Emorj' E. Smith, late of
Stanford University, in as general mana
ger. The plan failed to carry, for an in
vestigating committee reported that the
affairs of the association had been well
con tucted and that there waa no reason
for making a change. Shortly after came
President Scott's proposition for another
election, five or six months after the last
election. But little was said of the propo-
sition at the time, as neariy all seemed to
be taken by surprise. Directors Sproule,
bonntag and Keller were appointed as a
committee to look into the question, and
the committee met before the regular
meeting. Sproule and Sonntag favorrd
holding the election, but Keller opposed it
upon the ground that the present board
had been legally elected in September by
ti:e members of the association when this
body was incorporated. Furthermore, the
suggestion that all the members should
lender their resignations in order that a
new board might be legally elected would
inspire the members with distrust, particu
larly after an investigation, and more par
ticularly just preceding a movement to
hold a home industry exposition. At
any rate, he maintained that the effect
would be confusing and demoralizing
tipun the members of the association.
However, he would not file a minority re
port, and the ideas of Mr. Sproule and
Mr. Sonntag prevailed, and with the re
pon favoring the holding of an election
was a recommendation that the incorpora
tion's by-laws be changed so as to permit
of holding an election.
The regular meeting was called, with
Vice-Presideni Sonntag in the chair and
Directors Moore, McLaughlin, McGlynn,
Sbarboro, Keller, Currier, Saroni, Bowers
and Secretary Mead present. The iirst
ii-uttpr taken up was the following report
of Manager Tacy upon the proposed ex
position :
The office force of the association has been
engaged since the Ist of January in the com
pilation of the annual report :>ubraitted at the
meeting of the board of directors on the 16th
in>t., gathering iniormation for the commit
tee on Japanese question, preparing reports
for committees and preparing matter for the
contemplated exposition of home products.
We have secured a temporary option on the
>iechanies' Pavilion lor the ias't two weeks of
March and the month or April, but find that it
will be neoes-ary to make application to the
board of directors of the Mechanics' Institute
to secure a lease of the building for exposition
purposes. That l>oard meets to-night (January
21) and we would suggest that some one' be
authorized to appear uefore them and apply
for a iease of the building for the above-stated
time, or secure an option for thai period. The
board of directors will not meet again for
two weeks.
If it is intended to hold the exposition in the
month of April it is necessary that action on
this matter be not delayed, as considerable
time will be required to prepare for it. In
order to save time we have prepared a pros
]>ertus, forms for application for space, rules
and regulations and drawings of the building
to submit to the proper committees, when each
are appointed.
We are also preparing blank forms to get tbe
desired information for the new directory of
home products.
We think that it would be of considerable
benefit to the association to print and dis
tribute the report of the special investigation
eommitiee and the secretary's annual report at
once, and would request authority to do so.
Respectfully submitted.
B. EL T\( v, Manager.
Director McGlynn went to the support
of the proposed exhibit with enthusiasm,
and urged that Manager Tacv be author
ized to secure the Mechanics' Pavilion and
po ahead with the arrangements. He said
that space enouch could be sold to exhibi
tors to more than pay for the rental, and
thus the association would be making
money.
The others hung back, for the February
election specter was evidently before their
.. Director Keller said he was sure
that it would be a success if taken hold of
properly, bat if there was a lack of inter
est, too much self-interest or discord man
iiested it would not be a success. Mr.
Mead suggested that a committee of three
investigate and decide upon the feasibility
of the proposition. In the couise of the
remarks a -de by others the February
election was mentioned. This brought
l>:r ctor Bowers to his feet with an in
quiry aa to what was meant. The annual
election does not take place until Septem
ber, he said. An explanation was given.
Mr. Bowers looked greatly surprised, but
ma .c no remarks. At last it was decided
to send Directors McGlynn and Currier
and Manager Tacy to see the Mechanics'
Institute people about the leasing of the
Pavilion.
It was also decided to print and dis
tribute 3000 copies of tne secretary's re
port before the election.
The next business to be discussed was
the report of the special committee on the
annual meeting and â  the election and
amendment proposition, and the first ob
stacle encountered was the discovery that
Directors Moore, Saroni and Bowers had
quietly left the meeting and a fvo-thirds
majority of the eleven directors was lack
ing. Saroni had left in order to catch the
Oregon train. The others gave no reason,
but they simply left. At last the obstacle
was overcome by the discovery that the
by-laws could be changed by a vote repre
senting two-thirds of the paid-up stock,
and forty of the sixty shares sold being
represented in the meeting, the special
committee presented the following report:
Your special committee appointed at the last
meeting of the board oi directors to investi
gate and report upon the question of holding
an annual election of the association at an
ear'.y date met this afternoon, and after giving
the matter full and careful consideration your
committee begs to recommend that the annual
meeting of this association be held in San
Francisco on the first Wednesday in February,
and that the provisions of the by-laws be
amended to conform thereto.
This brought out Director Sbarboro, who
sa ; a :
I would like to know something about this
matter of holding another meeting and elec
tion within six months after one election
when we were elected for a year. There is
some motive behind all this that I fail to see.
What is it? It would look strange to the mem
bers of the association, who would want to
know why all the directors arc so anxious to
offer their resignations. I for one could not
give any explanation. None of us have done
anything wrong that we should get out, and
the report of the secretary and the investi
gating committee shows that the association
has been well and ably managed. There is
something back of all this, and I am not pre
pared to act until I am better informed.
Chairman Sonntag gave as an explana
tion the same arguments as used by Presi
dent Scott at the last meeting.
The report of the committee favoring
the holding of a convention and an elec
tion on the first Wednesday in February
was put to a vote. Director Sproule voted
aye. A second later Director Keller
slowly voted aye. Directors McLaughlin,
McGlynn, Sbarboro and Currier and
Stockholder Mead were silent and did not
vote. In other words, the two stockholders,
representing rive shares apiece, carried
the point, although no doubt the recoids
will show that it was carried by forty out
of sixty shares. Later Director Currier
said thÃt he did ,not and would not vote
upon a matter he did not understand.
The next proposition was to amend the
by-laws so that the electton could be held
in conformity with the foregoing resolu
tion.
Director McGlynn said that the matter
of making too radical changes had better
be carefully considered and added:
Maybe the members of the association may
consider that we are anxious to keep a hold
upon the management of affairs. Better be
regarded as autocratic than to have our bucket
of milk kicked over. It is all right to show
ourselves straightforward and upright, but I
have heard of men standing so straight that
they fell over backward, and it looks to me as
though that is just what we are likely to do.
Director Sbarboro again went to the
front and said that he feared the directors
were Jikely to get into an unhappy
tangle. They were elected when the asso
ciation was incorporated and every mem
ber was thoroughly informed and had his
voice in the selection.
However, after a little further talk the
amendment was carried and the meeting
quickly adjourned.
DECIDE ON A FAIR.
Tho Mechanics' Institute Will Hold
an Exposition of Its Own In
September.
At the conclusion of the meeting of the
j board of trustees of the Mechanics' Insti
| tute last night a committee from the Man
ufacturers' Association, consisting of L. R.
Mead, M. McGlynn and S. H. Tacy, re
! quested of the board that the association
they represented be allowed the use of the
pavilion during the month of April or
May for an exposition or extiibition of
manufacturers and producers' wares.
Mr, Mead stated that the manufacturers
i did not desire to conflict with the Me
: chanics' Institute in any respect, but that
j they hoped that the exposition they
! intended to give would prove a forerunner
â  of a series of expositions given by manu
j facturers and producers in this City, and
j also in the cities throughout the State.
The bjard went into executive session
; and decided to refuse the request of the
committee. They also decided fo hold a
! fair in the pavilion, heginnintr September
1 and ending October 3. They stated as a
reason for not granting the request of the
! outside committee that their own arrange
; ments would be interfered with by an
! other fair and it would work inharmoni
| ousiy for botn the institute and the manu
| facturers.
FOR A PUBLIC MARKET.
The Merchants' Association's Special
Committee at "Work on the Subject.
The special committee of the Merchants'
I Association having under consiaeration
| the project of establishing a free market,
in this City held a meeting yesterday and
considered the subject-matter discussed at
the last meeting. On that occasion W. H.
Mills, E. F. Adams, V\*. P. Rowley and
j others favored the establishment of such
ian institution. The committee decided
' that it is clearly evident that a free mar
ket is a necessity and will be of great ben
efit to the producer and consumer. It was
further decided to recommend the accept
ance of the Harbor Commissioners' offer
; of a place for a market on the water front.
i It was held that this would do for a begin
: ning, and it is hoped, that in time it will
I be used more as a distributing point for
' other public markets to be placed in dif
ferent parts of the City.
This is the substance of the report that
will be submitted to the association at the
meeting Thursday night. It will also be
recommended that the association give an
1 opportunity to those who oppose a public
market to be heard, and to any property

Contesting Her Son's Will.
Margaret M. Latson has filed a contest of the
will of her deceased son, Frank L. Latson, on
the ground that the one offered for probate is
not the lnst will.
After her son's death a will dated January
12, 1884, was filed with the County Clerk.
This will left all his property to his wife. The
claim is made that i:i February, 1884. a second
will was executed, by which a good portion of
his estate was left to his mother. The contest
was therefore fileti.
In Germany a merchant was recently
fined neavily for Using a quotation from
the Bible at the head of an advertisement.

A NEW PHASE OF
THE NOE CASE
The San Miguel Titles
Quieted Thirty-Five
Years Ago.
JUDGE NORTON'S DECREE.
It Forever Bars All the Noe
Rights and Titles to
the Tract.
THE DISCOVERY A SURPRISE.
Several Attorneys Give as Their
Opinion That the Decree Is
Most Important.
A decidedly new phase of the celebrated
Noe case, which has been dragging in
the courts for some time, was revealed
yesterday by old records and the decree of
a former suit which without doubt quiets
the title held by the property-own
ers of Noe Valley. This news, here
given for the first time, will be
joyful tidings to many people having
holdings in the old, often legally fought
over, San Miguel Kancho.
In 1852 Adolph H. Boric began suit
acainst Jose Jesus Noe. Miguel Noe, Maria
Dolores Noe, Splivalo Noe, Vincents Noe,
Richard Roman, l<=;iac X. Thome and Tuily
R. Wise in the Twelfth District Court for
possession of one-half of the San Miguel
Rancho a part of which is in Noe Valley.
1 1 contained 4fiCO acres, excepting 47 blocks
and about 100 acres of land, which would
leave something like 4350 acres. The de
fendants were the children and heirs of Jose
Jesus Noe. the grantee of the rancho, and
they claimed the one-half share of their
dead mother, which the old man Noe had
disposed of when the entire square league
of land had passed out of his improvident
hands.
But the Superior Court in 1856 or 1857,
in the case of Noe vs. Card, brought by
the heirs to determine the ownership of a
fifty- vara lot, decided that a Mexican grant
was not common property deeded to hus
band and wife, but was the separate prop
erty of the grantee, and he could dispose
of it as the sole owner.
On November 17, 1860, Judge Edward
Norton entered the following decree,
which was found yesterday among the
musty old court records in the Clerk's
office, and which places a new aspect on
the case:
INow therefore it is ordered, adjudged and
decreed that the title of t.he plaintiff to the
above described premises is a good and valid
title against the said defendants, and each of
them ; and that the said defendants, and each
of them, and all persons claiming by, through
or under them be forever barred of all right,
title, estate and interest in the said premises
and every par: and parcel thereof.
Edward Norton,
Judge Twelfth District Court.
P. Parsons, for plaintiffs.
Tully R. Wise, for defendants.
The present Noe suit was brought by
Miguel Noe, Vincente Noe. Catalina Noe
and Catalina Splivalo, October 28, 1895,
against the following property-owners on
the old San Miguel Rancho:

Roe, Nancy Roe, Mary Roe, Jane Roe and Ella
Roe defendants.
The plaintiffs, represented by Philip I.
Koscialowski, seek to recover an undivided
one-half of the rancho, being the old
Senora Noe one-half claim. In the new
complaint the rancho is said to contain
4443 38-100 acres.while in the suit of thirty
hve years ago it was put at 4500 excepting
two tracts. The geographical description
and location in the two instruments are
worded a little differently, but both desig
nate the tract in dispute as the San Miguel
rancho.
Attorney Koscialowski for the plaintiffs,
when interviewed yesterday, stated that
he had never heard of the Boric vs. Noe
suit, and recourse to the volume of court
indices of California cases in his office
failed to resurrect any mention of the case.
Joseph Naphtaly of the firm of Naphtaly,
Friedenrich & Ackerman, attorneys who
represent the Home of Peace Cemetery,
was surprised to hear of the former suit
and Judge Morton's important decision.
"Where did yon find this story?" asked
Mr. Naphtaly of the newspaper man.
"Oh, a Call reporter found it among the
records at the City Hall, and thought
tbere might be something in it."
"Well, I believe there is something in it,
It's my opinion that every one of those
tenants in Noe Valley holding title from
Boric are safe in their possession, and
their property is as safe as the coin in
their pockets. The decree, if you have
quoted it properly, forever bars out the
Noe claimants, and the plaintiffs in this
case, like the defendants in the former
suit, haven't the ghost of a case. But,
| mind you, they haven't a ghost of a case
anyhow, and especially in the question of
the cemetery which I represent. The
statute of limitations makes that case
ours. But it is a good story, young man,
and will be good news, no doubt, to the
San Miguel rancho people."
Isaac N. Thorne, the attorney whose
name is mentioned as one of the defend
ants in the suit of 1888, had forgotten the
details of the Boric case and its decree.
He believes thai Judge Norton's decision
settled the case against the Noe people
thirty-live years ago, even if the Card case
did not three years prior to that date. Mr.
Thorne gave the following short history of
the San Miguel Rancho:
"In 1852," said he, "Jose Jesus Noe,
after the death of his wife, sold the entire
tract of league square to William Cary
Jones, brother-in-law of Mrs. Jessie Ben
ton Fremont, and B. F. Strode, attorneys
of land claims. I believe the price was
?200,000, but I think Noe only got $100,000.
In 1853 they conveyed it to John Y. Homer
who laid out the Homer Addition now
known on the maps. Homer mortgaged
the tract to Mayor Garrison, which mort
gage was transferred to Pioche & Bayer
que, who had been liquor merchants.
Pioche went to France, where he per
suaded a number of his capitalist
friends that money would draw 3
per cent monthly in California. They
entrusted funds with him and the
two liquor-dealers launched out as bank
ers. They loaned money on everything,
and were soon at the end of their and their
friends' resources. Pioche went back to
France for more funds and was imprisoned
for fraudulent transactions. He escaped
going to a penal colony and returned to
Sa*i Francisco to be found dead somewhere
in the seventies in his room on Stockton
street. The tract got into the hands of the
French bank, by which it was sold out in
parcels.
In 1857 the suit was brought against Card
for the possession of a 50-vara lot. The
civil law then in force in the territory ac
quired from Mexico held that all property
was common and children could inherit
their mother's half of the estate. But the
Supreme Court decided adversely, and
we dropped the case, discouraged. I
tnink that settled the question, and if
it did not, Judge Norton's decree certainly
does. It strikes me that this is an im
portant discovery."
ATHLETIC INQUISITION.
The Investigating Committee of the Pa
cific Athletic Association Begins
Work.
A committee appointed by the Pacific
Athletic Association to inquire into the
amateur or professional standing of mem
bers of the associated clubs began its
inquisition last evening. The committee
consists of W. H. Humphrey, W. R. Berry,
John Elliott and J. L. Jaunet.
Last evening was devoted to an examin
ation of athletes as boxers, wrestlers, etc.
Thirty-two members were to have been ex
amined, but only the following were pres
ent: F. H. Sm'itb, C. Cathcart, J. A. Mc-
Ginley, Joseph P. Reay. J. H. Manon,
Charles Staamburg, Mr. Brown. Stewart
Carter, F. F. Hughe*, Charles Tie, Joseph
A. Fields, James Delaney, F. C. Muller, L.
H. Fentress, Henry Butler, Cnarles A.
Reno.
Among those questioned last night only
one was found to answer satisfactorily, in
the person of James A. McGinley. Those
whose answers led the committee to be
lieve them to be bordering on the profes
sional realm will be further examined,
and if their guilt is proved will be punished
by fine or suspension.
Nearly all of those examined were found
to have received medals that were not
properly inscribed and sums of money
over the $40 limit.
Next Monday evening the Olympic Club
baseball team will be examined, as charges
have been made against nearly all the
members of professionalism. After the
examiners have passed upon those of the
baseball team the athletes of all the clubs
will again bÂ© dealt with in turn.
The examination includes those who
have competed in events and received
prizes during the year 1895-96.
A translation of a collection of sacred
poems of the Aztecs, the original of which
is in the National Library of Mexico, is
to be made by Rev. Julio Cabelero of the
diocese of Pueblo.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1896.
FIENDISH WORK
ON JESSIE STREET
Mutilation of a Horse on Ac
count of Spite for the
Owner.
BLINDED AND BEATEN.
Nearly Killed, the Animal Was
Hauled Up by Ropes and
Left Suspended.
THE OWNER IS A TEAMSTER.
Thomas Harkins Thinks That Some
Worthless Fellows Are Guilty.
Arrests Expected.
One of the most revolting cases of
inhumanity that the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals has
TO BE THE FASTEST STEAMER OF HER SIZE IN THE WORLD.
[Drawn from the original plans.}
ever been called upon to investi
gate was reported last Monday. Po
liceman George Delmar, who was detailed
on the case, enjoined silence till yesterday
afterroon, as he feared that publicity
would make him lose track of the offend
ers. In the evening, however, he had ob
tained enough information to justify him
in believing that ho would make the
necessary arrest to-day.
On Monday morning the officers were
called by telephone to go quickly and
shoot a horse in the stable at the rear of
43 Jessie street.
The horse belonged to a teamster, Thomas
Harkins of 48 Jessie street, and for spite to
the owner, it is presumed, some one had
broken open the door of his stable, either
during the night or early in the morning,
and had mutilated the animal with fiend
ish ingenuity.
The animal's eyes had been gouged out
with a piece of iron pipe, its flanks had
been cruelly beaten and its feet and hoofs
battered out of shape. The wretchesâ for
one man could not have performed the
deed â had then tied a rope round the ani
mal's body and its neck, and had sus
pended it a few inches above the floor to
the roof of its stall, so that it was in a state
of semi-strangulation when found in the
morning by its owner. Such was the
wretched animal's strength and vitality,
however, that it required several shots to
kill it after the arrival of the officers.
Tom Harkins, the owner, is an intel
ligent, hard-working young teamster, who
has a stand at the corner of Second and
Mission streets. When seen last night in
his little home, on Jessie street, he said:
"I went to the stable at 11 o'clock on
Sunday night to water the horses, and
they were all right then. On Monday
morning I was almost overcome by the
sight in the stable.
"The door opens outward, but it had
been battered in, and that may have ac
counted for the other two horses being un
touched, as they would be hidden from
the people in the end stall by the door.
"I cut down the horse that they had
mutilated and found that it was standing
in a pool of blood and had no eyes. Help
was procured and we did what, we could
for the animal, but we soon saw that the
most merciful thing was to have it shot,
for the creature was suffering terribly."
When asked whom he suspected of
having committed the deed, Harkins
said, "Some of the fellows around here.
I stick to my business and don't drink,
and dome of them seem to bear me a
grudge for it. I should not be surprised
to find them lying for me some night;
it's pretty lonely after dark across the
vacant lot that leads to this house, and
the fellows who mutilated that horse are
murderers at heart and would not hesitate
to use up a man in a brutal, cowardly
way."
When asked whether he intended to
move from the neighborhood the team
ster replied emphatically that he was not
going to be driven away by any outrages;
if they attacked him he would hit back
and try to give them a taste of the using
up they gave his horse.
Officer Delmar hopes, however, that he
will be able to arrest the miscreants and
let them work out some of their murder
ous tendencies in the State's prison.
JAMES LICK MEMORIAL.
ltronxe Tablet for the Library of the
Mechanics' Institute.
At the regular meeting of the board of
trustees of the Mechanics' Institute last
evening the joint committee on finance
and library rooms and building, consist
ing of Grove P. Ayeis, Ernst A. Denike,
Henry Koot, E. H. Cole and Ferdinand
Formahls, submitted three recommenda
tions regarding the deprivation of privi
leges of members who have become de
linquent in the payment of dues.
The recommendation which stated that
a member should be deprived ol booke it
he is delinquent one quarter was adopted
by the board.
A recommendation excluding a member
from the rooms when he is denied the
privilege of takinc books was lo3t.
The third recommendation, which read:
"Shall the librarian accept the applica
tion for membership from a person whom
the board has ordered dropped from the
institute owins: to non-payment of dues?"
was adopted with the provision that he
f>ay up all bia past dues; otherwise the
ibranan should not receive such applica
tion.
The passage of this latter recommenda
tion occasioned quite a lengthy discussion.
Chairman Halliaie before theamendment
authorizing the board to determine differ
ently in special cases was of the opinion
that much injustice might be done
should the recommendation of the
committee directing the librarian
to refuse application of membership
be accepted as it stood. He stated that a
member might for a period of years be ab
sent from the institute and therefore be
unable to enjoy its advantages, and that
according to " the recommendation he
would not be entitled to the privileges
unless the dues of those years.were paid.
After an exhaustive elucidation of the
state of affairs by Mr. Leggett his amend
ment to the recommendation was adopted.
The Aboard by a vote of 5 to 5, one
member not voting, resolved not to make
ttie experiment of introducing musical
books â such as instrumental pieces, songs
and operatic scores â into the library.
It was also decided to Keep the reading
room on the basement floor until the pop
ularity of its location there or on the
third floor was further investigated and
made clear to the Board.
The special committees appointed to in
vestigate the National School of Electricity
reported that department to be in a satis
factory state and conducted in accordance
with the regulations of the board. It was
decided to grant an extension of privilege
to the school.
Mr. Leggett, chairman of the James
Lick Memorial Committee, reported that
the committee had selected a bronze tab
let, costing $250, bearing a medallion of
James Lick, beneath which would be in
scribed the words: "James Lick be
queathed to the Mechanics' Institute
$10,000 for the purchase of mechanical and
scientific works." The committee recom
mended that the tablet be placed in a con
spicuous place in the library hall. The
recommendations of the committee were
adopted as read.

pensive as possible and at the same time
thoroughly instructive.
The party will leave San Francisco for
New York early in April in a special car,
which will stop over at Salt Lake City,
Colorado Springs, Chicago and Niagara
Fails. One week will be spent in New
York visiting the spring exhibitions and in
general sight-seeing. Reaching London
about the Ist of May the party will spend
two weeks studying the exhibitions, the
national museums and in seeing the great
city and its suburbs, with special attention
to the different types of character there
and along the route. The next stop will
be made in Rouen, the great storehouse of
Gothic architecture. One month will be
spent in Paris visiting the salons, the
Louvre, Luxembourg and in general sight
seeing. Excursions will be made to Fon
tainebleau, Barbizon, Chartres, St. Cloud,
Versailles, etc.
Leaving for Holland about June 15,
short stops will be made at Brussels,
Antwerp, Bruges and Ghent. The next
two months will be spent in the ideal little
Dutch village of Kijsoord, situated on a
beautiful river between Rotterdam and
Dordrecht. Here Mr. Reaser will direct a
class in figure and landscape painting. Ex
cursions will be made to all the princioal
Dutch cities and galleries, including a day
or two at Scheveningen, the most charm
ing of Continental watering-places. A
unique feature of the trip will be a week's
journey in a big sailboat through the
Dutch canals, stopping at picturesque lit
tle out-of-the-way places, and seeing the
fascinating Dutch peasant life as few tour
ists are privileged to see it.
The party will return to New York
about the middle of August, reaching San
.Francisco early in September.
Mr. Reaser has spent many years in
Europe and is thoroughly familiar with
the country. He has attained considera
ble prominence as a painter.
*v plan has created quite a stir among
the young people who paint, and if the
present indications amount to anything
the party will be entirely made up in a
short time.
All Agree.

! __ S ' .
BEING BUILT BY THE SCOTTS.
Other Projects to Popularize the At
tractive ' Mountain Lake â An
Electric Railroad.
What is designed to be the fastest craft
of her size afloat in fresh waters is now
being constructed at the shipyards of
the Union Iron Works. She is being built
to the order of D. B. Bliss and his son, C.
T. Bliss, well-known capitalists of Tahoe,
ana is to be used largely for excursion pur
poses on Lake Tahoe.
She is to be a steel twin-screw steamer,
and will measure 168 feet 9 inches over all,
17 feet and 10 inches beam, and her ex
treme draft will be six feet. Her guaran
teed speed is to be 23 VÂ£ knots per hour, and
her cost will be $70,000. She will be put to
gether in this City ready for launching and
when it has been ascertained that every
bolt and nut is perfect she will be taken
apart again and transported by rail to
Truckee. From there she will be hauled
by team to the shores of the lake recon
structed, launched and christened.
This new and svrift vessel will take the
place of the Meteor, which is at present
engaged in carrying the mail to the vari
ous towns located on the shores of this in
land sea.
It is expected to have the new steamer
in service by the first of June, when the
summer excursion season to Lake Tahoe be
gins. The Central Pactic Railroad Company
has already made arrangements with the
Blisses to run at least one special excur
sion train a month to Truckee during the
summer. The train will leave here Satur
day night and return on Monday, thus
giving the excursionists all of Sunday for
pleasuring on and about the lake.
In furtherance of their plans the Blisses
are also projecting an electric broad-gauge
railroad from Truckee to Tahoe, a distance
of about thirteen miles, at a cost of about
$200,000. Th eelectricity for the power neces
sary to operate the road will be derived
from the magnificent falls that exist in the
vicinity of the lake.
Another feature of the grand plan to
make Lake Tahoe and its vicinity a great
and popular summer resort is the construc
tion of a fine hotel on the shores of the
lake near Tahoe. This will have accom
modations for about 150 guests and will be
furnished with every requisite for con
venience and comfort.

Xout They Will Dabble in Mining Stock*
at the Windy City.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 21.â The Chicago
Mineral and Mining Exchange was for
mally opened in the New York Life build
ing this afternoon in the presence of the
members and interested outsiders, who
crowded the callroom to the doors. Fif
teen mining properties of good standing
are already listed, but no business was
transacted to-day.
President John Marder delivered an ad
dress explaining that the board would not
be limited to dealing in gold and silver
stocks and properties, but would extend
its facilities to all valuable minerals. It
would be the aim of the board to bring the
dormant raining interests of the country
into a vitalized activity. He regarded
mining as a perfectly legitimate business,
not beneath the highest standard of bank
ing, manufacturing or merchandising.
Many notable mining men from the West
ern fields were present. A rush of appli
cations for listing is expected from the
West, but all will have to pass a rigid ex
amination.

JHlbb Ellen nenrh law Make* Her Metro-
politan Debut.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 21.â Miss El
len Beach Yaw, a young Californian
soprano, who made a highly successful
tour through the provinces last season,
made her metropolitan debut at Carnegie
Hall this evening. Her voice is of pure
soprano quality and a most remarkable
range, with the breadtn and depth of a
contralto in the lower register, and easily
reaching the heights affected by Di Murska
and Gerster in days gone by, and retaining
throughout its entire register a roundness
and volume truly remarkable in a young
woman of such slight physique.
Miss Yaw had the valuable assistance of
Signor Campanani of Abbey and Graus 1
forces, Maximilian Dick, violinist, and an
orchestra under the direction of Herr An
ton Seidl.

HABITS OF THE WEATHER
Mr. Hammon Gives Some Inside
Facts About Storm Centers
and Rains.
The Storm Swoops Across the State in
a Flying Wedge Until Tackled
by the Sierras.
"Part of the storm has escaped," said
Mr. Hammon, the weather prophet,
yesterday.
"After cavorting around the State a
while, it started East, but smashed up
against the Sierras ana was caught like a
wet sponge on a high stone wall. Then it
backed up somewhat and struck out over
a new trail to the northwest, and a good
deal of it has got away from us."
Mr. Hammond said all this in other
words, the more strictly scientific phraseo
logy taking up fifteen minutes of Govern
ment time.
The storms go East from here, always,
and they never know any better than to
pitch head first into the mountains. This
and other like habits have long been
studied by the weather observers, and
from the time the first indication of rain is
noted the general route of the storm can
be mapped \n advance as artistically -as.
the Federal appropriations will permit.
Meteorological phenomena, as the ap
prentice in the Weather Bureau usually
remarks, are much more reliable along this
coast than anywhere else in the country.
Therefore, it is possible, when once on the
trail of a storm, to form fairly accurate
predictions. The only trouble is that the
observations cannot be extended west of
the coast, and a traveling deluge is apt to
sweep in from the ocean just when the
whole State has been placarded with :
"Fair weather to-morrow; followed by
more the next day."
If there were some islands out in the
Pacific Ocean from 100 to 300 miles from
here, and if England didn't own them, the
United States could establish observation
stations that would enable Mr. Hammon
to tell all about the prospects and assur
ances of rain. As it is, however, each
storm swoops in on the coast unannounced,
and it is as uncertain a thing as a flying
squadron in Bantry Bay.
"Why do the rainstorms always come
from the north, though the wind blows
from the west?" asked a Call reporter
yesterday.
"They don't," said Mr. Hammon
This man up .on the . Mills building
knows all about the weather, and he vol
unteered to turn his "high pressure area"
of information in the direction of the in
quirer's "low.'' V 1 l " c "V
"Tu h M "in. a S era 3 to come from the
north, he said, "when in reality the storm
is moving west. The storm area moves
something wV M yin<t wedge in a foot
ball game. When the apex of the wedge
strikes the coast and continues across the
country the sides of the wedge extend
farther and farther north and south. So
to the people soutn of the storm center the
ram seems to come from the north, but to
those north of the center it apparently
comes from the south. J
orl'^r lt i is tru ? . that the storm centers
are almost invariably north of San Fran-
CISCO* . - .
â¢ *Â£" n Â«. ot Â£ er - DOlnt in answer to the query
is that the wind does not blow from the
W i 11 is coiner to rainâ not as a
rule. The wind in this vicinity is usually
from the southeast before a storm. That
is because the storm comes from the west
or northwest, and the winds blow from
every d irection toward the storm center.
Yes, a strong southeast wind in the
winter is a good San Francisco indication
of rain."
Mr. Hammon told many tilings. Why
the wind blows from the west on summer
nights attracted by the heated land; how
the storms in the summer skirmish away
up to the north of British Columbia and
how the "flying wedge" of the storm cen
ter is successfully tackled by the Sierra
Nevadas and has to make a quick run
around the ends to make even a touch
down in the arid goal of the East.
He explained these thincs in the scien
tific jargon of the Agricultural Depart
ment, for the weather officials do not
know much about football.
There was a thunderstorm here at 1
o'clock Saturday morning, but even at
that hour in the night it didn't get
through unobserved. Mr. Hammon has
it tagged and scheduled, and he says it is
the very same thunderstorm that the
steamer Peru encountered away out in tha
middle of the Pacific Ocean on January 8
and January 10. Mr. Hammon knows
all about that storm, and he can recognira
it if he ever sees it again.
The rain for the twenty-four hours cor
ered in yesterday's reports was very
heavy â nearly as heavy, in fact, as that
which, by a computation the week before,
weighed 10,800,000,000 tons. Some of the
figures, representing inches and fractions
of inches, are as follows:
San Francisco, .28; Sacramento, .40;
Fresno, .74; San Luis Obispo, 1.78; Los
Angeles, .32; San Diego, ..%; Indepen
dence, .74; Calistoea, .47; Santa Rosa, .43;
Glen Ellen, 1.20; El Verano, .50.
"It is remarkable," said Mr. Hammon,
"that at Glen Ellen the rainfall was about
three-quarters of an inch greater than at
Santa Kosa and El Verano, a few miles on
either side."
There was an exceedingly heavy rain all
over Lake County, and the creeks there
are so high that even the stages that carry
the mails are stopped, the water covering
the roadways in some places.
