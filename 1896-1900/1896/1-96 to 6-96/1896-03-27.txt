Sultan of Turkey lately demanded that
the Egyptian Government explain the ob
ject of the Soudan expedition. In reply

accord with Great Britain, intended to re
cover the territory lost by the revolt in the
Siudan. The Sultan has tbns forced
Egypt's hand by eliciting the admission
that the ultimate object of the expedition
is to rescue the Soud*an from the Mahdists.
In the House of Commons to-day Cur
ron, Under Secretary to the Foreign Office,
announced that the Government has not
received any protest against the expedi
tion up the valley of the Nile. The Sultan,
he said, bad inquired the nature of the
military operations proposed, and expla
nations had been given.

numerous precedents for the expenditure
of a portion of the Egyptian reserve fund
with the consent of a majority of the
powers comprising the Egyptian public
debt commission. It was the ordinary
method of procedure.

House that the military authorities of
both England and Egypt had approved
the Dongola expedition, and added that

NOT IN CANADIAN TERRITORY.
An Erroneous Report Said to Have Been
Made by the Boundary Com
missioners.
OTTAWA, Ont., March 26.â The joint
report of the International Boundary Com
missioners appointed to ascertain facts
and data necessary to the permanent de
limitation of the boundary line between
Alaska and Canada has been presented to
Parliament. The report shows that the
surveyors of the two countries agree ap
proximately in their observations. The
summit of Mount St. Elias is found to be
2.41 statute miles east of the one hundred
and forty-first meridian, that is to say, in
Canadian territory.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â
Mount St. Elias is not in Canadian terri
tory, to-day's report from Ottawa to the
contrary notwithstanding. General Duf
field, superintendent of the Coast GeodÂ«tic
Survey, and the representative of the
United States on the joint boundary com
mission, whose report has been presented
to the Canadian Parliament, says that
while it is true that the mountain is 2.41
statute miles east of the one hundred and
forty-first meridian, it is furthermore cer
tain that its highest elevation is exactly
ten marine leagues from the coast, and
therefore it is happily one of the chief
boundary monuments between American
and British possessions. The records of
the official surveyors establish this beyond
question.
TOR IKCOME TAX.
Tlie Principle Accepted by the Chamber
of Deputies.
PARIS. Frakce, March 26.â After a close
struggle the Chamber of Deputies to-day
accepted the principle of the income, tax.
Prime Minister Bourgeois raised a question
of confidence against an amendment of
fered by M. Guillemot and the amendment
was rejected by a vote of 288 to 272.
M. Deumer, Minister of Finance, then
demanded a vote on M. Dron's resolution
of confidence and on the principle of the
income tax.
The conference paragraph was adopted
by a vote of 297 to 249. Finally an amend
ment offered by M. Pourauerv de Bosserin,
which was similar to that of M. Dron, but
leaving the settlement of the most strongly
opposed details of the income tax bill to
the Budget Committee, was carried, the
vote standing 286 to 270, the Government
accepting the amendment.

RIVAL CLAIMANTS MAY CLASH.
Trouble May Grow Out of the Change in
the Channel of the Missouri
River.
LINCOLN, Nebb., March 26.â County
Attorney Burnham and Sheriff Glasgow of
Nemeha County to-day called upon Gover
nor Holcomb, seeking his advice and as
sistance in the event of a clash between
rival claimants for land in Neraeha
County, this State, and Atchison County,
Miss. The threatened trouble, which has
assumed a serious aspect, is the result of
the Missouri River changing its channel,
leaving a part of what was NebraAa an
island. The settlers on this land utilized
the old river bed, or the Nebraska half of
it as accretions to their farms.
Under a law passed by the Missouri
Legislature the whole of these accretions
were claimed by the State, and recently
filings have been made by Missouri claim
ants on the disputed territory, which com
prises between 3000 and 4000 acres. So
stubbornly have the original settlers re
sisted that there is fear of bloodshed.
Governor Holcomb advised caution, prom
ising to consult with Missouri officials
looking to an amicable settlement.

BUTTE, Mont., March 26.â The biggest
of all contests recently entered in the
Davis will case was begun to-day by Mrs.
Elizabeth A. Smith of California, a niece

Her Own Life.
PORT JERVIS. N. V., March 29.â 0n
Sunday evening Jacob Snyder and his
wife, Frances, who live in East Main
street, this city, were taken suddenly iJI
with arsenical poisoning. Jacob died
last Tuesday, but Mrs. Hnyder lingered
along until early this morning, when she
died.
The Snyders' only danghter, Mrs.
Martha Whittaker, who is suspected of
having administered the poison, has been
under the surveillance of the police since
yesterday morning. She was debarred
from the presence of her parents by order
of the physician last Sunday, at which
time it was first ascertained that' they had
been poisoned. Mrs. Whittaker was prac
tically a prisoner in the sitting-room, be
low the room where her mother lay suffer
ing all day yesterday, a policeman stand
ing guard .on the outside of the building.
When Mrs. Snyder was found to be in a
dying condition at 6 o'clock last evening
the daughter was admitted to her presence,
As soon as she entered the room the
mother called out, "Get her out of my
sight." The daughter did not leave the
room, but remained where her mother
could not see her. When her mother died
Mrs. Whittaker swooned and fell to the
floor.
Shortly after she was seized with nausea,
and Dr. Swartout was hastily summoned.
He found her evidently suffering from the
effects of poison, and administered anti
dotes. The physician was again called at
7 o'clock and later at 11 o'clock.
Coroner Harden took an ante-mortem
statement from Mrs. Snyder on Tuesday,
the substance of which he will not make
known until the inquest, a jury for which
was impaneled this morning.
Autopsies have been performed on the
bodies of both the victims and the stom
ach, intestines and other organs showed
violent irritant poisoning by arsenic.
These will be sent" to a New York chemist
to be analyzed.
A box of rat poison from which about two
spoonfuls had been taken is in the posses
sion of Coroner Harding. .
Mrs. Whittaker by the death of her par
ent? would have come into the possession
of $3000 insurance, $2000 of which was on
the life of the father, payable to the wife,
and $1000 on the life of Mrs. Snyder, Day
able to her husband. Mrs. Snyder made a
will on Tuesday eyening in which she de
vised her property so as to deprive Martha
of the $2000, but the $1000 insurance on her
own life she could not change,
Mrs. Whittaker asserts her innocence of
the crime. â¢

CINCINNATI, Ohio, March 26. â A
special to the Post from Louisvilie says:
A case of tnc most inhuman treatment of
a father to a son came to light this after

several other gentlemen.
For two years the boy had been chained
to the floor of a stable, and only on a few
occasions was he allowed the freedom of
the lot, and then it was under the guard
of some member of the family. The boy
lives with his father, William Hendon,
about two miles from Jeffersontown. Two
years ago he ran away, a/id when his
father found him he said the boy should
not repeat it, and, it is claimed, securing
a chain he welded it to the boy's leg and
fastened the other end to tfie stable floor.
The chain was not more than two feet in
length, and for two years the boy re
mained a prisoner. This morning he se
cured a horseshoe, pried the staple off and
ran to Jeffersontown with the chain still
dangling to his foot. Action will be taken
to prosecute the father for his inhuman
treatment.

Rev. Johnson ForceH to Admit That JBÂ«
>foÂ» Wrong.
FRESNO, Cal., March 26.â Evangelist I.
T. Johnson, whose sweeping declaration
reflecting on the chastity of a large
proportion of Fresno's daughters,
has brought upon himself the execration
of most of this city's respected citizens.
His declaration that these things were
told him by a friend does not helD his
cause, from the fact that he stoutly re
fuses to divulge the name of his in
formant. The Republican here contained
the whole story this morning, including
an interview between City Editor Max
well, a Caxl correspondent and the Rev.
Mr. Johnson. The subject of the inter
view has been discussed on the streets here
all day, and the remarks of incensed
fathers and brothers were anything but
complimentary to Evangelist Johnson's
judgment and disposition. The unwitting
evangelist has been busy all day trying to
patch up a denial to the reporters. He
made a frantic effort to obtain a refutation
of the Republican's story through an
afternoon paper, but was ordered out of
the office by Circulator Osborn, who threat
ened to use his boot in case the evangelist
did not leave at once. The preacher beat
a precipitate retreat.
At an indignation meeting this after
noon a large body of men congregated on
the streets near the place where the meet
ing was held, and violence to the preacher
was feared for a time. A committee wai
appointed at the meeting to guarantee
protection to the offending clergyman
until he could- get out of town. The meet
ing prepared and Johnson signed the fol
lowing statement :
Do you believe that the statement made by
you concerning the chastity of thegirls of this
city, which you claimed was told you by a
friend, was untrue, and that you made a mis
take wheu you repeated that statement? An
swerâl do; and furthermore I will apologize
to the community for having made the same.
I. T. Johnson.
JohnÂ«on promises a long statement,
which he says will exonerate him of an
evil intent and threatens dire calamity
upon the local newspapers. A second
meeting was held at the City Hall to-night
which was attended by hundreds of peo
ple, but the addresses are temperate and
considerate.
The following preamble and resolution
was adopted.
Whereas, Certain slanderous and unwar
ranted statements, reflecting upon our commu
nity and our public schools and churches,
have been given circulation through the local
press and admitted to have been made by one
Rev. Johnson, an evangelist conducting meet
ings in one of our churches, now therefore,
Resolved, That we, the citizens of Fresno in
mass-meeting assembled, do most in
dignantly resent the wholesale slander that
has been thus cast upon our community, our
churches and our public schools and denounce
in unmeasured terms the Rev. Johnson in
giving publicity to such slanderous reports as
have been admitted by him, and pronounce
them absolutely false and without any founda
tion whatever, and we do advise the said
Rev. Johnson immediately to depart from our
city; and further suggest that he never return.
Johnson is either in hidine to-night or
has surreptitiously left the city.

GENERAL CASEY.
Green to Have Charge of;
the Construction of the
Library Building.
CHOSEN BY THE SENATE
Ex-President Harrison Permitted
to Accept Medals From
Brazil and Spain.
THE JUDICIAL APPROPRIATIONS
Opposition to the Plan of Placing
Certain Officials on a Fixed
Salary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â None
of the matters ttiat came before the Senate
to-day was of much public interest or im
portance. One-third of the time was con
sumed over a joint resolution appointing
a successor to General Casey in the matter j
of the construction of the new library
building, nearly as much time on an
amendment to the legislative appropria
tion bill allowing a third clerk to the Sen
ate Committee on Pensions, and all the
rest of the time on a motion made by
Sberman of Ohio to strike out of the
legislative bill all the sections in relation
to the compensation of United States dis
trict attorneys, marshals and clerks.
Morrill (R.) of Vermont reported from
the Library Committee a resolution to rill
the vacancy caused by the death yesterday
of General Casey, in charge of the con
struction of the new library building in
Washington, by the appointment of Ber
nard R. Green at $5000 a year. The reso
lution was advocated by Morril!, Hale and
Yilas. Hill (D.) of New York inquired
why the charge of the work should not
pass into the hands of General Casey's
army successor.
Yilas explained that Green had been
General Casey's assistant from the begin- j
nine of the work and that it would do no
good and might do harm to make a change
now. He thought that Green should be
allowed to finish the work now so near
completion.
Af ter further discussion Hill said he
would not insist upon his objection, al
though it struck him that it was not
proper to legislate a man into office by
name, "even before the burial of the dis
tinguished general.''
The discussion extended over more than
an hour and a half and was further par
ticipated in by Senators Allison (R.) of
lowa, Proctor (K.) of Vermont, Gorman
(D.) of Maryland, Cockrell (D.) of Mis
souri, Cullom (R.) of Illinois, and Chand
ler (R.) of New Hampshire.
In the course of it much stress was laid j
upon the fact that the building will be
finished within the time fixed for its com
pletion and for less ttian the estimated
costâ about $6,400,000. The joint resolu
tion wu then parsed.
The joint resolution reported yesterday
by Sherman (R.) of Ohio from the Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, authorizing
Benjamin Harrison to accept certain
medals presented to him by the Govern
ments of Brazil and Spain during his
term of service as President of the United
State.<, was taken up and passed.
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska introduced the
following resolution, which was laid on
the table:
Resolved, That Congress should by appro
priate legislation without further delay re
store silver to the free and unlimited coinage
at the ratio of 16 parts of standard silver to |
one part gold, and should by appropriate leg
islation withdraw from the Secretary of the
Treasury any power he may now have to issue
the bonds or other interest-bearing obliga
tions of the United States until the necessity
therefor shall be declared by Congress, and
that Congress should not adjourn until these
things have been accomplished.
A joint resolution providing for the ap
pointment of a commission under the
direction of the. Secretary of "War for the
preliminary survey, with plans, specifica
tions and approximate estimates of tne
coat thereof, for the construction of a ship
canal of approved width and depth from
the lower shore of Lake Michigan to the
Wabash River ami for the further inves
tigation of the practicability of the con
struction of such waterway, was taken
from the calendar and passed.
The legislative, executive and judicial !
appropriation bill was taken- up and all
the amendments heretofore agreed to in
committee of the whole, except such as
were specially reserved, were agreed to in
bulk.
About an hour was consumed in dis
cussing an amendment to give a third
clerk to the Senate Committee on Pen
sions. The amendment was assailed by
Allen (Pod.) of Nebraska, and was de
fended and advocated by members of the
Committee on Pensions. In the course of
the discussion Gallineer (R.) of New
Hampshire, chairman of the committee,
stated that the assistant clerk was his son
and that he performed his public duties
with fidelity and efficiency.
Sherman (R.) ot Ohio moved to strike
out all the sections of the bill in reference
to the compensation of United States
district attorneys, clerks and marshals,
putting those officials on a salary basis in
stead of on the basis of fees. He made an
argument against the proposed change,
one of his points being that such a com
plete reorganization of the judiciary de
partment of the United States ought not
to be made in an appropriation bill, but
ought to be careiully considered in all its
details by the Judiciary Committee.
Sherman's motion was supported in
Bpeecbes by Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts,
Chandler (R.)of New Hampshire and Hill
(D.) of New York on the ground chiefly
that legislation of a general character
should not be placed in appropriation bills.
Without disposing of Sherman's motion
the bill was laid aside, Cullom, -who is in
charge of it, giving notice that he would
try to have a final vote on it to-morrow.
A bill for the admission of Arizona as
a State was rep orted from the Committee
on Territories and placed on the calendar.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed: House bill granting
to the Duluth and Northern Dakota Com
pany a right of way through the Indian
reservations in Minnesota, with an amend
ment; Senate bill to fix the times of hold
ing the United States District Court in
Sitka and Juneau, Alaska; Senate bill for
the construction ot public buildings at
Cheyenne, Boise City, Idaho, and Helena,
Mont., to cost, the first and second not
over $250,000 each and the third not over
$500,000.
The Senate then, at 5:20, adjourned un
til to-morrow.

GENERAL HIPPOLYTE GONE
News of the Death of the Presi
dent of Hayti Officially
Received;
One of the Rulers of the Troubled
Island Who Was Not Over
thrown.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.-Sec
retary Olney this morning received a cable
gram from United States Minister Smyth
at Port au Prince, Hayti, announcing the
death of President Hippolyte.
LONDON, Exg., March 26.â Dispatches
received here to-day confirm the report of
the death of General Hippoiyte, President
of Hayti.
General Hippolyte was about 65 years
of age, and of coal black complexion.
He was the political idol of the pure
blacks uncontaminated by creole mar
riages. General Legitime, whom he dis
placed, was a mulatto and Ihe hope of
the creole population. Politics are still
somewhat primitive in Hayti, and the
color of a candidate's complexion is more
closely regarded than the planks in his
platform. Hippolvte was the son of a
prominent Haytian professor, who was
educated in the normal schools of France
at the expense of his Government, and on
his return founded a military college at
Cape Haytien, which is still the most
prominent educational institution on the
island.
Hayti has had sixty rulers during ninety
years of existence. They have been vari
ously called emperors, presidents or kings,
as Haytian fancy dictated. Fourteen
have been overthrown, assassinated or
driven into exile.
Many attempts to overthrow Hippolyte' s
control were made. An attempt to assasi
nate him on one occasion is described by a
correspondent as follows:
It appears that about 2 a. m. a sentinel
discovered the would-be murderer of the
President lurking in the palace. The
eentinel sprang upon the intruder. The
feflow was armed with a sharp dagger and
made a desperate resistance; Tne sentry
Shouted for help, and President Hippolyte
and others rushed to the scene. The sen
try was already wounded and nearly ex
hausted when rescue came, and Hippolyte
and his friends succeeded in capturing the
assassin.
The prisoner confessed that he was from
Jacmel and that he had come to Port au
Prince with the purpose of killing Hip
polyte. He said that there were hundreds
ready to execute the same purpose in case
that he failed. The prisoner wa3 defiant
and appeared to glory in the attempt and
said that he only regretted that he had not
been successful.
Hippolyte ordered that the prisoner
should be shot at once, and that the cap
tain of fie guard and the sentries who
were stationed at the entrance of tbe pal
ace and who had obviously been guilty of
treasonable negligence, if not of deliberate
treachery, should also be shot. The or
ders were forthwith earned out, and the
condemned persons were shot to death in
the garden of the palace. The sentinel
who had detected and seized tbe assassin
was munificently rewarded and promoted.
The Late General Hippolyte, President of Hayti, a Keport of Whose Death Is
Officially Confirmed.

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â The
House ; spent ; most i of to-day !s session in
discussing, in committee of the whole, tne
motion offered by Hanley (R. ) of Indiana,
member of the Committee on Naval Af
fairs, to amend the naval appropriation
bill for the ; ending June 30, 1892, by
providing -for ~ the construction .of . six
battle-ships' instead of four as recommend
ed by the committee. * ~ * .'â¢> '
. . The motion was supported by Hanley,
Johnson (R.) of California, and Cum
mings (D.) of New York, and . opposed by
Hulick |(R.) of Ohio, Robinson (R.) of
Pennsylvania, and Boutello (R.) of Maine.
The motion was lostâ 32 to 134. Without
further amendment \ the bill was reported
to the House and passed as recommended
by the committeeâ the first appropriation .
bill of the session to â¢ pass unscathed
through the House. |Â¥ . : : 'y ".'. ;
Among the miscellaneous business
transacted was the passage of two or three
private bills, the presentation of a con
current resolution ,by Heatwole (R.) vof
Minnesota, authorizing the - appointment
by the President of a banking and cur
i rency commission to consist of nine
I citizens to act with the. Comptroller of the
â  Currency and to report their recommenda
tions and conclusions to Congress, which
was referred to the Committee on Banking
and Currency, and the presentation of the
report of the Congressional Commission
on the opening of,- the Chickamauga
'National Park by Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio.
Cannon (R.) of. Illinois "reported the
sundry civil * appropriation bill for the
year ending Juue 30, 1897, and gave notice
he would a-sk the House to consider it to
morrow. '. ; '
Heatwole (R.) of â  Minnesota offered the
following concurrent . resolution, which
was referred to the Committee on Bank
ing and Currency: .
Whereas, In view of. our present inadequate
banking and currency system it is desirable
that Coneress have . the aid . of such - recom
mendations as a non-partisan commission of

political economy and banking to act with the
Comptroller of the Currency as such commis
sion, and that said commission be requested |
to report its conclustons and recommendations
to Congress. â  -â¢ _...-_
By unanimous consent.a number of bills
were passed," among 1 them the House bill
authorizing the Gulf, Colorado and ; Santa
Fe to acqnire depot grounds in Davis,
Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory.
Grosvenor presented the report of the
Committee of Inauguration of the Chicka
mauga National Park, which was ordered
printed. â  Consideration of the naval ap
propriation bill was resumed in committee
of tbe whole, three hours being; set .apart
for debate ,on the paragraph authorizing
the new warships and torpedo-boats.
Hanley .' (R.) of '.Indiana .'_â â  offered an
amendment increasing the number of sea
going coast-line battle-ships from four to
sis, and supported the ; amendment in a
speech of some-, length. He quoted from
Boutelle's speech addressed ,to ; s Holman
(then a - representative ' from â¢ Indiana), in
avoir of an increase of the navy, and said
that the people of the West had heard that
appeal of the gentleman from Maine and
i were nOw ready to respond to it in sup
| porting ; appropriations for building ? the
ships he advocated.' .-t- ; â¢ r â 
Hulick (R.) of Ohio, a member of the
i Naval Committee, also supported the ; bill.
Johnson (R.) of California criticized j the
! Naval Committee for not going far enough
' in the matter of providing for the increase
in the navy. He advocated ' the- building
of -ships in order, that American citizens
might be fully protected wherever j they
went, and that the badge of an American,
citizen would be what it was to the Roman
citizen, his JEgis of safety the world over.
Robinson (R.) of Pennsylvania defended
the action and report of the Committee on
Naval Affairs, and, in beginning, alluded
to Hanley's argument as the "forensic
son? and dance of the young man from
Indiana.''
The closing argument in support of the
motion to increase the number of ships
was made by Cummings (D.) of New
York. He said he had heard with great
j pleasure the speech of Hanley coming
i from the State it did. It compared favor
ably, he said, with that statement made
on the floor of the House by another rep
resentative from Indiana, that six canal
boats were enough for the navy of the
United States. Cummings paid a glowing
tribute to the value of the services of the
naval arm in all ages, giving It credit un
der Lord Nelson for having been the di
rect cause of Napoleon's downfall.
Bontelle closed the debate on the para
graph, defending the propositions of the
bill as reported. Hanley's amendment
was defeatedâ ayes 32, noes 134.
Fisher (R.) of New York moved an
amendment authorizing the President in
his discretion to direct the construction of
one or more of the new ships in the navy
yards. The amendment was disagreed to.
Hilborn (R.) of California moved to
amend by authorizing the building of five
of the torpedo-boats on the Pacific Coast,
instead of one, as provided in the bilL
The amendment was rejected.
Low (R.) of New York moved an amend
ment to increase the number of torpedo*
boats to fifty, forty-five of them to have a
minimum speed of twenty^-four Knots, and
to cost nOt more than an average of $75,000
apiece.
Doolittle (R.) of Washington moved to
amend by authoiizing the construction of
four torpedo-boats on tbe Pacific Coast.
The motion was defeated.
Tate(D.) of Georgia, moved an amend
ment to the provisions of the bill that no
person not a citizen of the United States
shall be employed in the future in the
preparation of the plans or specifications
of the battle-ships of the country. Ruled
out on a point of order.
Mercer (R.) of Nebraska moved to insert
a proviso that one of the ships be named
"Nebraska" and made a humorous speech
in support of the motion, which was
defeatedâ Bo to 57.
Hilborn (R.) of California offered an
amendment directing the construction of
one of the torpedo-boats at each of the
navy-yards at wnich the necessary plant is
in existence. Lost.
The committee then rose, the bill was
reported to the House and passed
Cannon (R.) of Illinois reported from the
Committee on Appropriations the sundry
civil appropriation bill for the year ending
June 30, 1897, and gave notice that he
would ask the House to-morrow to enter

COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, MarcÃ 26.â
The dignity of the United States court
w4fc raffled to-day by a right which took
place between three Federal prisoners and
a witness wbile the prisoners, in charge of
a marshal, were being taken from the
courtroom.
Charles G. Burns, William Petty and
Samuel Long are on trial for counter
feiting, and "Curley" McÃee, an old pal
of the gang, testified against them. At
tempts have been made at different times
to get even with the man who "peached,"
and this noon the quartet met at the en
trance to the courtroom.
The alleged counterfeiters were hand
cuffed and closely guarded, but, notwith
standing this precaution, Burns made a
iunge with his free hand, which staggered
McÃee, and, surrounding him. the trio
began to beat and kick him. Officers
hastened to the rescue, and using their re
volvers as cudgels soon had Burns lying
insensible on ti>e floor.
All three prisoners are serving peni
tentiary terms on minor offenses, and are
looked upon as bad men to deal with.

An Important Bill Providing for
the Appointment of a
Commission.
EVILS THAT REaiTIRE REMEDY.
Danger of an Invasion of Manufac
tured Articles From Japan
Pointed Out.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â 8y
direction of the Committee on Education
and Labor Senator Perkins to-day re
ported to the Senate a till authorizing the
appointment of a non-partisan commis
sion to collate information and consider
and recommend legislation to meet the
probrem presented by labor, agriculture
and capital. The bill provides that the com
mission shall be composed of twenty
one members; that "the five mem
bers representing labor shall be ap
pointed by the President from those
nominated by labor organizations
which are National in character, having
the largest number of members and being
most representative, character and numer
ical strength to be considered, and not
more than one person shall be appointed
from the organization ; that of five mem
bers to report on agriculture, three shall
be appointed on the recommendation of
the National Farmers' Alliance" and In
dustrial Union and two on the recommen
dation of the National Grange and Patrons
of Husbandry."
The report accompanying the bill says:
"The universal dependence upon trans
portation companies is a fact or a question
of prosperity or lack of prosperity of agri
culturists which demands attention. In
some States, as in California, this factor is
of supreme importance. In others Jess.
The fact that oranges- from Spain
â¢and Italy compete successfully with
oranges from California in the great
markets of the country is wide bear
ing. The cost of transportation of
California fruit to market is 90 to $1 per
box while foreign fruit pays 32 cents. In
less than carload lots it now costs about
$2 a box to lay down California fruit in
New^ork. Spanish oranges pay 50 cents
a case, but the case is twice as large as
that containing fruit with which it com
petes. These facts tend to show one of the
principal causes of complaint that is now
being made by a very important industry
of a great State and the present case would
fairly come before such a commission as is
proposed.
"Lower freight rate 3 and a measure of
protection by tariff from domestic fruit
would revive the now languishing branch
of horticulture, and the facts stated above
are emphasized by the report of United
Stales Consul Seymour of Palermo, that
during the year 1894 there were exported
from that port eight times as many lemons
and oranges to the United States as the
entire exportation to all other foreign
countries during the same period. Cali
fornia and Florida suffer from this compe
tition of fruit raised on the shores ol the
Mediterranean, and the prosperity of two
great States of the Union is disastroasly
effected to the benefit of the people of
another race, country and hemisphere.
''And trivial indeed will some of them
appear when we shall be face to face with
that industrial competition which is
being forced upon us by Japan. It is but
a few years ago that this remarkable
nation began to establish manufactories to
supply goods which it had hitherto pur
chased abroad, yet even now there has
arisen alarm in Englana, Germany and
our own country regarding the influence
which Japanese manufactures will have
upon their prosperity. And this
alarm is not without cause. The
grave importance of the question
raised by the marvelous development of
Japanese manufactures has been fully
recognized by the National Association of
Manufacturers of the United States, which
has requested Congress to appoint a com
mission to inquire as to the invasion of
our own home markets by Japan. The
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion of California in February called a
meeting to discuss the Japanese indus
trial question, at which Julian Sonntag
called attention to the fact that it is
a dangerous fallacy to contend that the
Japanese can never compete successfully
with America and England in commerce
and manufactures. - To-day, he said, one
cannot go into a dry-goods store and tell
French and Japanese silks apart. Carpets
from Osaka rival those of Egypt, Turkey
and Persia and are being exported to
America in large quantities. The great
newspapers of the country have recognized
the importance of the industrial revolu
tion in Japan and are discussing it se
riously. Writers of magazines devoted to
economics are giving the matter their
attention. In March number of Gunton's
Magazine appears the following :
There is no country in which economic
changes are likely to create so much industrial
surprise if not dislocation in the next quarter
of a century as Japan. During the last quar
ter of a centery Japan has been rapidly west
ernizing her civilization' and is now rapidly
westernizing her methods of industry. At the
present rate she Is progressing it may not take

WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.âAb
sistant Secretary of the Treasury Harulin
and Captain Shoemaker, chief of the
revenue cutter service, said to The Caw. .
correspondent to-day that the report of the
court-martial in Captain Healy's case had
not been considered.
Hamlinsaid: "The report of the find
ings embraces 1500 pagas of typewriting.
As yet it has not been examined. Xot an
individual in this department- knows its
contents, and all stories of approval or dis
approval are fakes, pure and simple."
A letter was to-day submitted to the
House Committee on Rivers and Harbors
signed by tne Senators and Representa
tives of the ' California delegation asking
that the contract for the construction of
San Diego jetty be xn3de a continuous one.
The same .request will be made for San
Pedro harbor.
The members of the California delega
tion have all received dispatches signed by
the Ship-owners' Association of the Pacific
Coast asking their support of the House
bill removing discriminations against
American sailing vessels of the coast
trade. This bill is known throughout the
country as the pilotage bill. It is possible
that all the members of the California
delegation will support the measure.
Pensions have been granted as follows:
California: Original â William Hughes,
Soldiers' Home, Los Angeles; John Py
peorge, San Francisco. Increase â Ci3rence
E. Goodwin, Santa Rosa. Original, widow
âHenrietta J. Fay, Redland.

A card from' Ambrose Bierce.in the Star,
declaring that if Huntington's charges
against the Examiner were true he would
resign his position with that paper, is an
interesting topic of gossip in the California
colony here.
The following postal routes will be dis
continued in California after April 30:

rin County, from Petaluma; Pyrema, Kern
County, from Bakerstield.
The Senate Commerce Committee to day
reported a bill granting American registry
to the steamship Kahului of San Fran
cisco, Captain Nelson's vessel. Some criti
cism was heard to-day among California
Congressmen, who declared the vessel was
an old English-built hulk, unworthy to fly
the American flag._ The Kahului has
been engaged in foreign trade, but her
condition practically unfitted her for long
voyages, but now as an American ship she
can ply in the coastwise trade.
The following are among the items car
ried .by the sundry civil appropriation
bill, reported to the House to-day: Goat
Island wharf, $30,000; for suffering natives
of Alaska, $19,500; Humboldt Bay (Califor

forcement of the Chinese exclusion act,
$125,000: reyenue cutter for the Pacific
Coast, $125,000.
Sam B. Solomon of San Francisco died
at Garfield Hospital at 10 o'clock to-night.
Two weeks ago a piece of chicken bone
lodged in his throat, pus formed around it
and his throat and head swelled to twice
their normal size. To-night an operation
was decided upon, but Solomon died on the
table. The bone, an inch long, was re
moved after his death.
Mr. Solomon was well and favorably
known in San Francisco and Sacramento.
He was often at the State Capitol during
legislative sessions and he was a familiar
figure in California headquarters at Na
tional conventions. Of late he has been'
employed in Senator Perkins' committee
room.
MEDICAL IXSPHiCXOR KERBRXER.
There Was Good Season for His Dismis
sal From the -Vary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 26.â After
holding it back for more than a week, Sec
retary Herbert to-day made public the
indorsement of President Cleyeland
in the case of Medical Inspector
Edward Kershner.wno was dismissed from
the navy on March 9 on conviction of a
"violation of a lawful regulation issued by
the Secretary of the Navy" and of .scan
dalous conduct tendine to the destruction
of good morals. The charges involved
perjury, and the court-martial sentenced
the medical inspector to dismissal.
Secretary Herbert many months, ago
sent the case to the President with the rec
ommendation that the sentence be con
firm Al, buttt President did not act until
March 17. In his indorsement of the sen
tence the President says:
"I have examined all the' proceedings in
this case and everything bearing upon it
with the utmost care and would have
been glad to find a justification for.a mit
igatiou of the sentence imposed. I have
not been able, however, to escape the' con
viction that Medical Inspector Kershner,
with an unworthy intent and an insubor
dinate spirit.violated an importanf salutary
regulation of the Navy Department. lam
also fully convinced that to conceal his
fault he deliberately.and under oath gave
evidence before a court of inquiry which if
it did not technically constitute perjury
amounted to a plain and intentional sug
gestion of falsehood and a willful sup
pression of the truth."
Secretary Herbert on March 19 appended
the following:
"Medical Inspector Edward Kershner,
IJ. S. N., accordingly ceases to be an offi
cer of the navy from the date of this
order."
MAT CHRCK THEIR LAUDING.
The Opposition io the Booth-Tuckers to
Cause Complications.
NEW YORK, N. "Â», March 26.-Com
missioner Booth-Tucker sailed from Liver
pool for America yesterday. He and Mrs.
Booth-Tucker started by the St. Louis last
Saturday, but received news of the serious
illness of their youngest child. Mrs.
Booth-Tucker was so ill that she could not
leave the steÃmer, so She continued her
voyage, while her husband returned to
care for the child, which has materially
improved.
It is just possible that Mrs. Booth-Tucker
may not be permitted to land in New
York. It was reported yesterday that an
attenjpt would be made to prevent both !
Mr. and Mrs. Booth-Tucker from landing, j
it being neld that they come here contrary
no as alien contract laborers. Thow
who object to Mr. and Mrs. Booth-Tucker
coming cite the case of Rev. Dr. Wai pole
Warren, who a few years ago came here
from England to become the â  pastor of
Holy Trinity Church. It was decided in
Or. Warren r Ãcase that he was liable to
the provisions of the law and Holy Trinity
had to pay a rine.of $1000 for importing a
preacher. It is held that either Mr. and
Mrs. Bootb-Tucker come here as contract
laborers or else they must admit that they
are in the employ of an English religious
organization to do missionary work in this
country.

STOWED AWAY IN A TRUNK
Decomposed Body of a Man
Found Packed in Chloride
of Lime.
Ghastly Discovery Made by Men Who
Purchased Some Unclaimed
Freight.
CHICAGO, 111., March 26.â Packed in
chloride of lime and badly decomposed,
the body of a man was this afternoon
found in a box by Carl Hoff of Austin, 111.,
one of the purchasers of a lot of unÂ«
claimed freight which .was storei in the
warehouse of Wakem & McLoughlin in
South Water street. The box was marked
"D. M. Morgan, 166 South Morgan street,
Chicago."
Philip Greiss and Carl Hoff, both of
Austin, came into the city to-day to buy
unclaimed freight in Wakem & Mc-
Loughiin's warehouse. The goods were
delivered at the house of Koff, who is a
contractor. Hoff ordered Frank Ahlgrim
and Charles Ramus, two of his employes,
to open the boxes. The. first one opened
contained a new trunk. Around it was
packed a layer of sawdust.
The trunk was opened and inside was
found a hermetically sealed box of zinc
made to tit the trunk. This being broken
open was found to hold the corpse of a man
badly decomposed. It had first been
doubled up and wrapped with small rope
and then packed in tight with chloride of
lime. The men were horrified at their find
and with Hoff went to the police station at
Austin and reported their experience. A
patrol- wagon was sent for the body and it
was taken to the County Morgue. The
police are now working on the case, trying
to discover where the body came from and
why it was so packed. The name of D. M.
Morgan does not appear In the Chicasro
Directory.

NEW YORK, N. V., March 26.â A plan

C. P. HUNTINGTON
California Congressmen Are
Startled by a Strange
Report.
SANTA MONICA HARBOR.
Money for Its Improvement Said
to Be Appropriated in the
House Bill.
SOME VERT FINE WORK DONE.
Agents of the Railroad Influence
Statesmen to Some Unpopular
Legislation.
WASHINGTON. D. C, March 26.-The
California members of Congress, especially
those from Southern California, Bowers
and McLachlan, were startled this morn
ing by a report that the House Committee
on Rivers and Harbors had included in
the river and harbor bill (which will be
presented to the House on Tuesday) an
appropriation for improving the harbor at
Santa Monica, where the Southern Pacific
wharves are.
The river and harbor bill is not com
pleted, and as the members of the com
mittee are pledged to absolute secrecy, it
cannot be learned certainly what amount
has been provided for Santa Monica. But j
that any amount is appropriated at all is \
what surprises the Californians. No dele
gation nor any individual has been before
that committee to urge any appropriation i
for Santa Monica, but it is shrewdly sur- |
mised that C. P. Huntington and his
agents have been getting in their fine
work.
Over a month ago there appeared before
the River and Harbor Committee a aele
gation from the California River Conven
tion to urge improvements for various
waterways of the State, and San Pedro es
pecially. It was pointed out by several of
the speakers that as between San Pedro and
Santa Monica California people were almo.st
unanimous .'or the former, and that sev
eral boards of Government engineers had
reported against Santa Monica and in
favor of San Pedro. Senator White stated
this very plainh' to the committee and al
though Huntington was present he had
nothing to say in reply.
The California members are in a predica
ment. They know that if they don't op
pose an appropriation for Santa Monica, i
they will displease their constituents, but I
are fearful that if they do fight the Santa |
Monica appropriation it will endanger that j
which they hope to secure for the inner j
harbor at San Pedro. It is customary in!
the River and Harbor Committee when a
State cannot agree on what it wants to
settle the matter by giving nothing, and
as the committee is economically inclined
anyhow, this may result if the Califor
nians oppose the Santa Monica proposi
tion. ______________________
PORTABLE X-RAY A.PP ARATVB.
Edison's Practicable Application of the
Roentgen Vibration.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 26.â The
most practicable application yet made of
the Roentgen rays is that on which Thomas
Edison has been experimenting for several
days, and which he expects to perfect this
week. Edison gave up fluore scent photog
raphy when he began his search for means
to aid the eyes in penetrating solids. He
has made a portable X-ray apparatus,
which ne will exhibit at an electrical exhi
bition in Now York soon, and which he
believes can be constructed so cheaply and
reliably that one can he placed in every
dispensary and hospital.
The apparatus consists of a double-tube
vacuum pump attached to a wooden up
right, the exhaust mercury pipe running
into a small wooden box* alongside the
pump, in which the tube is placed. The
electrical current is furnished from an or
dinary battery and induction coil under
the box or any other convenient place, and
the wires leading through the bottom of
the box obviate any possibility of surgeon
or patient receiving a shock.
When a patient arrives at a hospital the
surgeon will turn on the current and place
the portion of the body to be operated on
across the top of the box containing the
tube, fasten over his eyes the new fluoro-
Bcope, a large field glass without lenees,
the outer end being covered with paper
coated with the tungstate of calcium crys
tals. The cover of the box offers no mate
rial resistance to the passage of the rays,
and the surgeon is enabled to examine the
injured patient at leisure.
BEXJAMIX FRAXKLIX WILL.
It Is Admitted to Probate in a Massa
chusetts Court.
BOSTON, Mass., March 26.â The will of
Benjamin Franklin was allowed in the
Suffolk County Probate Court to-day by
Judge Grant, on petition of Mayor Quir.cy
as a foreign will, having been probated
about a century ago in the Orphans' Court
in Philadelphia. The probate of the will
here is deemad necessary in view of a
legal disposition of the "Franklin fund,"
which was created by the will of Franklin,
and now amounts to several hundred
thousand dollars. There was no opposi
tion to the probate and it was admitted
upon the credit of the certificate of the
recorder of the Orphans' Court.
ROBBED MAXY I'ERSOXS.
Arrest of Two Xegro Highwaymen Who
Operated in Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., March 26.â Harry
Kent and Charles Hunter, two desperate
negroes who have been wanted by the
police here for highway robbery, were
captured this morning. Ten people have
already identified the men as robbers who
held them up at the point of a revolver,
and the police beiieve they can trace
thirty or more robberies to them. It was
the p"!an of the negroes to hold up only
people witli satchels whom they believed
to be just about leaving the city. Many
people living in other cities have been
Btojiped by them. When the men were
arrested to-day much . valuable plunder
was discovered in their den.
MESSAGES OF CHEER SE.\T.

BALTIMORE, Md., March 26.â Since
the news has gone forth of the great des

composer of "Kathleen Mavourneen," is
nearing the end of bis long struggle, mes
sages or cheer have been pouring in on the
old man, who shows the most enthusiastic
appreciation of the attention that is being
shown him. .

made happy by the receipt of more than
$300. A good deal of this has been sub
scribed here, but $185 was sent by C. S.
Brainerd of Chicago that was collected from
the muÂ«ic trade of that city.
A New York admirer sent $10 and the
Actors' Fund $20. Manager Edgar Stra
kosch of the Music Hall has interested
himself in calling the attention of theatrical
managers and friends to the situation, his
first response coming- from Charles Froh
man of New York with the inclosure of a
check for $15. This made the old man
quite cheerful, and though the end may
come at any moment he snows the best of
spirits.
RAIDS OS THE BUCKET-SHOTS.
Arrests Made at the Instance of the Clvie
federation.
CHICAGO, 111., March 26.â Five bucket
shops were raided this afternoon. The
arrests were made on warrants sworn out
by a man supposed to be a dummy in the
employ of the Civic Federation. The
places attacked were William Shakel's
places at 124 Clark street. 73 Jackson street
and 119 Clark street. The Rialto Com
mission Company in the Rialto building
and Perry & Smith at 9 Calhoun place
were also raided. Fourteen clerks were
gathered in at the Rialto Commission
Company's offices and sixteen employes
were arrested in the other houses. It is
rumored that the other bucket-shops will
be raided to-morrow.
HAS JOJIX WALSH'S HEART.
Gruesome Object in the Possession of
Coroner Arbuckle.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, March 26.â Coroner
Arbuckle has in his possession a gruesome
object. It is the heart of John Walsh,
who was murdered Tuesday night on the
west end of Central Viaduct in front of Ed
Murphy's saloon. The police found Walsh
dead in the gutter with a gaping wound in
his left side. At the post-mortem exam
ination the heart was cut out and placed
in a glass jar. It plainly shows the knife
wound, and will be held in evidence. John
Gallagher is in jail charged with the mur
der of Walsh. Gallagher was arrested
while attempting to escape in a boxcar.
The murder was the result of a saloon
fight. _
WOK AFFECTIONS AND MONEY.
Act* fork Police Looking for a Hwin-
dling Lothario.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 26.â The
police are looking for Joseph Schmidt, who
until Friday last boarded "at. 248 East Sixty
fifth street. Schmidt is accused by five
young women of iaving won their affection |
and incidentally of having stolen their J
money. How many more victims have I
fallen prey to Schmidt the police are un
able to determine, butthey have reason to
believe that fifteen is a conservative esti
mate.
Schmidt is rather a fine-looking man
about 30 years of age. He is gifted with
a winning way and a slippery tongue.
With these endowments he has laid siege
to susceptible feminine hearts, and in each
has seemed to have won.

CLOVERDALE IS AGITATED
Much Interest Manifested in the
Outcome of a Peculiar
Lawsuit.
Plaintiff Was Once the Betrothed of
the Man She Now Sues
for $900.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., March 26.â Mnch
interest is manifested in this county over
the approaching lawsuit of Gregory vs.
Williams for a claim of $f<oo. Mrs.
Florence Gregory, the plaintiff, is the
wife .of a promising young oculist of
Healdsburg. The defendant, 0. C.Williams,
is a young man of considerable means
and a partner in the local firm of
Brush, Williams & Co., whose financial
standing is above par. Both parties are
long-time residents of Cloverdale and well
known in this county. Mrs. Gregory (nee
Marshall) was engaeed to Williams for
about five years, but from time to time the
marriage was postponed, and she claims
that during this engagement she gave de
fendant $900 as part of an investment in
the Klint residence, with the intention of
making it their future home.
But "there's many a slip 'twixt the cup
and the lip." The expected wedding
failed to materialize. The engagement
was broken off, and instead, during last
January, Miss Marshall married another
of her admirers, young Gregory of Healds
burg. Her father, A. S. Marshall, opposed
the marriage, and here comes the peculiar
part of the case, in tha'< lie ,in
tne meantime made the final pay
ment and consummated the purchase
of the property, and has now
taken the Williams side of the caee. He
is a capitalist, owning much realty in this
and other countries of the State. The
daughter has also considerable money in
her own right, left by her uncle, Hugh
Marshall. The attachment served on
Williams yesterday was promptly re
leased, he giving a bond with the father of
plaintiff as suraty, and the case will go to
the Superior Co.urt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1896.
McKINLEY MEN
WERE SHOT OUT
Lively Proceedings at the
Texas State Republican
Convention.
FOB ALLISON AND REED.
Delegates Favoring Them Elected
by the Leaders of the
Element in Control.
FURY OF THE OPPOSITION.
_________
They Charged Upon the Platform and
Then Held a Convention of
Their Own.
AUSTIN, Tex., March 26.â Repub
lican State Convention to elect delegates
to the National convention met again this
morning at 10 o'clock and immediately ad
journed until 1 o'clock, as the committee
on credentials was not ready to report.
This was ominous for the McKin-ley men
and foreshadowed that their delegation
from contested counties would not be
seated.
In caucus last night, however, they had
captured many of Chairman Cuney's col
ored voters and had formed a perfect or
ganization for to-day's contest, and they
were ready for any emergency. It came
at 1 o'clock, when Cuney called the con
vention to order and announced that the
committee on credentials was ready to re
port. The committee's report recom
mended that the votes of eighteen coun
ties represented by proxies favoring Mc-
Kinley be thrown out. Tnere were con
tested delegations from eighteen counties,
and the committee in some instances rec
ommended the throwing out of the Mc-
I Kinley delegation and in the others seated
i both contesting delegations, giving each
half a vote. They threw out the McKin
ley delegation from Gray son County
headed by Chairman Grant of the State
executive committee and McKinley's
State leader.
At the conclusion of the reading of the
report a minority report was sent up, but
Chairman Cuney promptly ruled it out of
order, for the reason, he stated, that it had
not been prepared and signed in the com
mittee-room. Yells and applause fol
lowed his ruling and the wildest confusion
prevailed, pending which an effort was
made to gag the McKinleyites with the
previous question on a motion to adopt
the majority report. The previous ques
tion was withdrawn, and Webb Flanna
gan offered a substitute for the majority
report, but Cuney ruled it out of order
and for an hour the whole convention was
in tumultous excitement, pending which a
motion to adopt the majority "report was
made and declared carried.
The report of the committee on resolu
tion's favoring sound ' money, protection
and tariff on T sugar, lumber, cattle, wool
and bides was read and declared adopted.
Cuney, 1 Ferguson, Makemeson and Ter
rell, slated last night, were declared elected
delegates to the National Convention, the
two first being Aliison men and the latter
for Reed. Amid great confusion Chair
man Cuney declared the convention ad
journed sine die.
The McKinleyites at once made a rush
for the platform and were met by Cuney'a
followers. A rough-and-tumble fight en
sued. One negro delegate drew a six
shooter, but police officers, who were on
the platform anticipating trouble,
promptly gathered him in. Webb Flan
nagan and Chairman Grant, of the execu
tive committee, were knocked down. The
officers soon quieted the excitement.
Cuney's followers left the hall and the
McKinley faction proceeded to organize a
convention with 621 delegates, of whom
over one-third were colored. A negro was
elected chairman and the meeting was
harmonious. A sound-money and protec
tion platform was adopted and the follow
ing McKinley delegates to the National
convention elected: Frank Hamilton of
Austin, R. F. Smith (colored) of Colorado
County. Dr. W. Davis of Forth Worth and
Chairman John Grant of the State execu
tive committee. The convention then ad
journed sine die.
Both conventions elected two electors
from the State at large.

Drafted and Volunteering.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 26.â One
of General Harrison's most influential ad
herents among the Indiana politicians

two different matters." The inference is
that he would accept the nomination.

Laborers Employed in Bui/ding the St.
Louis Convention Hall Threaten
to Strike.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., March 2.6.â The laborers
employed in building the Republican
N ational Convention hall threaten to strike
unless a sub-contractor discharges the non
union men at work on the iron truss work
and girders of the building. The serious
nature of the threatened trouble will be
understood when it is recalled that
organized labor instituted a strike on the
Minneapolis building in 1892, and party
leaders afterward asserted, that it was one
of the causes leading to the defeat of the
candidates chosen in that hall.
MesKer Brothers are the sub-contractors,
and reluse to dismiss their non-union em
ployes. They are backed up by Chief
Contractor McClure, who declares that if
the labor unions interfere in the matter,
he will discharge union men and fill their
places with non-union workmen.

LUX CASE AT REDWOOD.
Special Administrator Crowe
Succeeds in Gathering in
$67,000.
No Money Yet Paid Out in the Sense
of an Actual Distri
bution.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., March 26.â
tor eight years the heirs of Charles Lux
have b^en trying to get seme money out of
the Lux estate, or a share of the profits of
the immense business of Miller & Lux,
but without much success. This con
dition of affairs finally brought about the
temporary removal of Jessie Sheldon
Potter as executor of the Lux estate, and
the appointment of Public Administrator
James Crowe as special administrator in
Potter's stead.
Like the proverbial new broom Special
Administrator Crowe has done some clean
sweeping and has just jrathered in $(37,000
which ne holds suoject to order of the
court. This money represents some of the
profits of the Miller & Lux bnsiness.
Tine firm of Miller & Lux has always
been very careful in making payments on
account of the Lux estate, ana on the Pot
ter trial it was claimed by Mr." Delmas
that no money was ever paid out in the
sense of an actual distribution, but that
such pay meats were always doled out at
advances or loans, for which notes were
taken in return as secuiity.
In the present case, when the books of
Miller (fc Lux showed a profit that should
be apportioned to the Charles Lux estate,
the special administrator and his attorney
pot iv their fine work and drew down the
$(57,000 as above mentioned, with the un
derstanding that the court should order
the manner of its distribution.
As soon as it became known that there
was some money in sicht Special Admin
istrator Crowe was the object of much at
tention, and the next of kin of Charles
Lux (the German heirs) were notified that
counsel for Executor Potter would make a
motion that they (Mastick, Belcher &
Mastick and George C. Ross) be .allowed
$25,000 on account of attorneys' fees.
To-day being probate day in tne Supe
rior Court tne matter came before Judge
Buck in regular order. The German heirs
filed an objection to the making of any
order for the payment of $25,000
or any other sum to the attorneys
for executor or executors of the
will of Charles Lux on the grounds that
only two' days notice had been given
these contestants of the application; that
the fees of the various attorneys
of the representatives of the estate
could not yet be properly apportioned
or fixed, and that the services of the
attorneys applying for such order have
been valuable chiefly to Henry Miller as
surviving partner of the firm of Miller &
Lux, and should be liberally paid for by
him, and so far as they have been neces
sary, expedient or in any way of value to
said estate, have already been paid tor, as
shown in the accounts of the executors on
file in the matter of said estate.
Attorney George C. Ross stated to the
court thai he had intended to make an
ex-parte motion for attorney's fees on be
half of attorneys for executor; but, as At
torney J. H. Campbell was unable to be
present and wished to be in court when
the motion was" made, he would defer to
Mr. Campbell's request, and asked that
another day be set. The matter was there
upon put over until Saturday, April 4.
A. Chinese EroduM.
SEATTLE, Wash., March 26.â A mem
ber of the Wa Chong Company, one of the
biggest concerns on the Pacific Coast, said
to-day that with the advent of worK on
the great railway to be constructed from

an exodus of Chinese laborers from this
country. Thousands, he declares, w:.o
have a knowledge of or who have been
doing such work in the United States will
return to their native land in order to
seek employment on and help construct
the jrreat highway which the Emperor in
January gave 'lsu Lang a franchise to
build.

Contest
AND GETS THE DALT CUP
One Hundred and Four Gunners
Participate in the Slaughter
of the Birds.
BIGGEST CONTEST ON RECORD.
In Many Instances Scores Are Tied
and Some Rich Stakes Are
Divided.
LONG BRANCH, N. J., March 26.â The
grand American handicap shoot was con
cluded to-day at Elkwood Park. The
moneys were divided, but the Â»iue ribbon
honors of the wing shooters for 1896 be
long to O. R. DicKey of Boston, who took
first place in the shoot-off as well as the
silver cup, value $500. presented by the
Messrs. Phil Dalv Sr. and Jr. to the win
ners of the great event.
The entries numbered 109. Five men
withdrew, leaving a field of 104, which ex
ceeded by two the largest number of con
testants that ever took part in the grand
prix at Monte Carlo, the premier event of
European pigeon shooting;.
When the two rounds were all shot at 2
o'clock this afternoon tight men had
killed twenty-four birds and thirteen had
accounted for twenty-three. The purse of
$1000 with the extra entrance fees amount
ing to $1710, was divided as follows: The
first eight highest guns to divide the $1000
purse and 56 per cent of the extra money;
the remaining thirteen high guns to
divide 44 per cent or the balance of the ex
tra money. The ties for places for the
Daly cup were to be shot off, miss and out.
The first eight men thus sot $244 70 each
as their share, and the next thirteen men
took $57 87 apiece. The shooting of the
ties resulted as stated, in the champion
ship won by Dickey, with Sim Glover of
Rochester, who was on the thirty-yard
mark, second, and G. W. Coulston of
Brooklyn (28 yards) third.
The weather to-day was almost perfect,
and those who faced the traps for the sec
ond round had nothing to complain of.
\\ hen darkness compelled an adjournment
last evening eleven of the competitors had
clean scores to their credit. They had not
been very long at the traps, however, be
fore the top-notchers began to climb down,
and the callant eleven dwindled with
startling rapidity until only three re
mained with clean scores to their credit at
the close of the nineteenth. The fortunate
ones were Heikes, Carl yon Longerke and
B. W. Claridge. A fast and low left quarter
fell dead out of bounds in the twentieth
and relegated Heiites to the second divis
ion, and a low-flying incomer disposed of
Yon Longerke in the same round. Claridge
failed to get on terms with his twenty-first,
and the straight scores were over.
The two leading divisions then shot off
tneir ties, miss and out. Dickey graased
six straight and took first place and the
cup. Glover missed his sixth, as did Carl
ston, but in shooting off the tie for second
place Glover won. Heikes lost his fifth
and took fourth place. Fen Cooper failed
to score his fourth bird and Thomas
missed his second, so they took fifth and
sixth places respectively. CubDerly won
seventh place from Carl yon Longerte.

CARROLL MURDER TRIAL.
The Widotc of the Victim Triea to Convert
Hit Slayer.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 26.â At
the trial of Louis J. Harman to-day for the
murder of Thomas Carroll the interesting
fact was developed that the murdered
man's widow visited Harman in jail, not
to condemn him for his crime, but to offer
him spiritual consolation.
Harman himself, on the witness-stand,
related how Mrs. Carroll came to inquire
after the welfare of his soul. To her ques
tion whether he was a Christian he replied
that he had been baptized in the Metho
dist church, and while he made no great
pretensions to piety he had always consid
ered himself a Christian in the general
sense of the word. She then read portions
of the New Testament to him, especially
such passages as had reference to the shed
ding of human blood. To all of this Har
man listened patiently, but it caused him
no pangs of conscience, as he claimed he
killed Carroll in self-defense.
Harman then related the circumstances
of the shooting, his testimony making it
appear that Carroll was the aggressor in
the quarrel and rushed at him with a
knife. He denied that either he or Car
roll was drunk, but admitted that both had
been drinking beer. The case is nearly
ready for the jury.
A. CHARITABLE JURY.
Acquit an Embezzler lieeause They
Doubted m* Sanity.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 26.â
Lloyd V. Nanscawen. Postmaster of Vi
salia, was tried in the United States Dis
trict court to-day for embezzlement, it be
j ing charged that he appropriated $700 of
Uncle Sam's money to his own use. It
â¢was proved that there was a shortage of
about that much in . his accounts. The
jury, however, took the view that Nans
cawen was not in his right mind when he
committed the act. and accordingly ac
quitted him.
There were many character witnesses
who testified to the defendant's integrity
and good business qualifications until c
recent illness which seemed to have
clouded his mind and left him incom
petent. The shortage was due to careless
ness rather than theit, hence the jury was
lenient. Nascawen was a soldier in the
Union army, and some of the testimony
went to show that one phase of his de
mentia was the importance that he placed
on his efforts during the .great struggle.
He claimed to have given valuable sug
gestions to General Grant which saved the
Union army, and told -nfany tnrilling
stories of how he helped to preserve the
Union.
MAT XASXEItJ: SERIOUSLY ILL.

company, which has been playing an en
gagement at the Bnrbank Theater here, is

mented by worry . over the business
troubles of the company, Manager Cooper
of the BurbanK having decided to dispense
with the services of the company, which
is now breaking up and stranded. :
i William 7 R. Dailey, whose play, "The
Crime of a Century, has just been upheld

cision. He thinks "The Crime of a Cen

stage, will help him out of his present
financial troubles.
CAUGHT CHOKISG A WOMAX.
Jo* Angeles Police Think They Have
Jack the Strangle!'.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 26.â The
police made a capture to-night that they
beiieve may turu out to be Jack the
Strangler, who has lately created such a
reign of terror in the tenderloin
district of San. Francisco. Shortly be
fore midnight a tall, well-dressed young
man about 24 years of age, smooth-f iced
and wearing auburn football hair, entered
an Alameda-street crib with the evident
intent of spending the night with the
frail inmate. There was nothing in his
manner to inspire fear, nor did anything
occur to provoke his anger, but suddenly
he sprang at the woman as she lay upon
her cot and, clutching her by the throat
with both hands, he began to strangle
her.
She managed to make enough noise to
attract the attention of three policemen
who were passing the place. As the officers
entered the room he let go his victim and
tried to escape, but they soon got hold
of him. He was foaming at the mouth
and his eyes bulged out and gleamed like
those of a madman. When asked
his name he said it was Frank
P. Jackson and that he was from
Ontario. On fnrther questioning
he said he came here from San Francisco.
On being accused of being Jack the Slran
gler, he neither admitted nor denied the
accusation. The officers believe it was his
purpose to kill the woman, but on the
police register ne is simply charged with
battery.
THE TAXDERBILT PARTY.

Mount Lowe.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 26.â The
Vanderbilt party, after spending last night
at Santa Monica and taking breakfast in
their private dining-car on the long wharf
at Port Los Angeles, returned to Los An
geles at 10:30 a. m., but went through im
mediately to l'asadcna and Mount Lowe,
where they sp.-nt the day as the guests
of Professor L avo. The day was cloudy,
which obstructed their view of the valley
from the mountain's crown, but they
nevertheless expressed themselves as
greatly pleased with the wonderful scen
ery. They remained at Pasadena to
night, will visit Riverside and Redlands
to-morrow, then proceed to San Diego,
taking in L6s Angeles again on their re
turn trip.
A SCARCITY OF OIL.
As a Result Prices Will Be Raised by
the Exchange.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 26.â The
stock of oil in storage in the local fields
has been reduced 30,000 barrels since
February 1. As the result of this brisk
movement, the Oil Exchange expects to j
raise the price from 80 to 90 >
cents a barrel within the next few
days. Some of the big operators are eet- i
ting into a tight pinch as the price of oil j
increases. One of these men, who had a j
contract with the Paente Company, is re- i
ported to have been called upon by them
CO supply' lo,ooo barrels under their con- !
tract. This would mean an enormous loss
to him, and it is said that he repudiated!
the order and will not fill it.

volver, struck the woman in the center of !

of the theater disarmed and held him j
| until the arrival of the police patrol, when '
j the body of the dead woman and the man
j who had taken her life were removed to

to tell how the shooting occurred Ire said : I
"i was going to marry Kittie. We were i
I to be married on the sth of May. and to- i
night I went down to talk to her about it. j
1 asked her if it was all right and she re
plied : 'Oh, T don't know; if I had a gun
I I'd kill myself.' This nettled me, and j
I said: "'Well, I'll get a gun j
if that's all you want,' and went out and I
cot this pistol. I came back and handed
her the gun, because I thought she was
only bluffing. Then she gave it back, say
ing, 'I dent want that; I was only fooling.'
"Then I ordered the drinks and we â¢
walked back in the corner of the theater, I
joking and talking. While we stood there
I took out the pistol to see what make it
was and I must have had my finger on the
trigger and it went off."
One of the employes of the theater who I
happened to be in the vicinity of the pair I
states that she heard the woman say, ''I'll
have it for you to-morrow," and then
heard Englehart retort, "Well, you'd
better." The next moment the shot rang
out, and Kittie gave a groan and sank to
the floor.
The inside of the dead woman's left hand
iis badly powder-burned. The bullet had
passed through it before it entered her
neck, and she must have caught the muz
zle of the pistol when Englehart pointed
i it at her.
She had been married previously, and
has a five-year-old son, although her
former husband had left her some three
years ago. It could not be ascertained
whether a divorce had ever been procured
or not.
Englehart, who was born in this city,
was living with his parents at 422 L street, j
and for some time has been deeply in- i
fatuated with the woman, who was old
enough to be his mother.
The other waitresses who are employed in
the place claim that the pair had appar- j
ently been on the best of terms during the I
evening, and as far as they knew there had
not been the slightest symptoms of any
quarrel ; on the contrary. Englehart
treated her with great liberality and,
seemed to be on the best of terms, but the
officers are convinced that the shooting
was a cold-blooded murder.
MINE BUILDIXGS BUSSED.
Total Destruction of the Golden Summit
Workt in Sutte County.
CHICO, Cal., March 26.â The Golden
Summit mine, formerly owned by Hon.
George C. Perkins, was destroyed by fire
this morning, resulting in a total loss of
the building and contents. The mine is
situated near the Chaparral House, in
Butte County. The blaze was first discov
ered in the woodshed, and there being
nothing at hand to light the fire with the
building was soon consumed.
About twelve or fourteen men were sleep
iug in the house and they lost nearly
everything they had. One man lost $180,
another $100 and two others $25 each. The
total loss will reach between $2500 nnd
$3000. The building is thought to have
been partly insured.
No clew is known as to how the fire orig
inated.
Some of the men are in town purchasing
clothing to take the place of that they lost.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1596.
STANFORD'S BIG
FISH COLLECTION
Dr. Gilbert and Assistants
Make a Hani at '
Panama.
HUNDREDS OF VARIETIES
The Doctor Gives Many Interest
ing Reminiscences of the
Expedition.
LIVELY SPORT WITH SHARKS.
Sickness of the Partyâ Progress of the
Canal â Thirty Cents a ' Day
for Labor.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal, .March
â The numerous barrels and boxes of
! fishes which Dr. Gilbert and his assistants
1 collected "while in Panama have not yet
been opened, as the six barrels of alcohol
needed to preserve them have not corte.
Dr. Gilbert and his assistantsâ Messrs.
Pierson . '97, MacGregor '97, , and Stark
specialâ left for Panama December 6, 1895,
and arrived at the university March 19,
; 1896. All of the members are bronzed by
i their contact with the tropical sun, and all
can tell interesting reminiscences of their
trip. Dr. Gilbert gave an interesting de-,
scription to a Call reporter.
'â¢Yes," said the doctor, "this was my
i third trip to Panama. In 1880 I was mak
ing a census of the fishes of the coast for
the United States Census. Bureau and re
turned by way ot Panama. In 1881 I re
turned to gather specimens for the Smith
sonian Institution. I was also then con
nected with the Indiana University. I was
in Panama during the winter of 1881 and
collected some very valuable specimens
and some new spec : .e3 and made my field
notes. I took my collection to the Indiana
University for .study and classification,
and unfortunately the whole collection,
with my classification and field notes, was
destroyed by fire.
"During the thirteen years' interval
none of the species were rediscovered, so it
was determined to make this last expedi
tion, which was only possible through the
generosity of Timothy Hopkins. The trip
cost $1000, although a proportionate re
turn will be made by the museums receiv
ing duplicate specimens. The present ex
pedition was the most successful. Only
185 varieties were collected in the second,
while in the last about 275 were secured.
We rediscovered all the new species, with
many more besides. We were discovering
new fish up to the day we left.
"On the day of our departure we saw in
the market a new variety of shark about
six feet long. All our fish had been packed,
but we purchased alcohol and carried this
valuable specimen home as personal bag
gage, j ;--.-. ;,>â¢'â¢ , . â¢;â¢ .'_ .. .
"We took along about ten gallons of the
juice or the hava tree, a poison which
kills the fish if poured in the water in ; large
quantities. We would pour some of this
fluid in the tide pools, which would stir up
the fishes in the depths, so that they would
come to the surface, where we would
catch them with dipnets. Many valuable
specimens were secured in this manner.
We obtained permission to use dynamite
from the Governor and killed the fish in
that way. We used an electrical hand
dynamo to transmit sparks to an electric
cap imbedded in the dynamite, and thus
discharged it at the proper time. The
fuse method is unreliable and dangerous.
For skeleton collections the dynamite
method is useless, for it breaks the fishes'
bones, although no external wound is
given. We made a good collection of
skeletons.
"We were somewhat affected by the
tropical sun, and none of us were wholly
well during the entire trip. Mr. Mac-
Gregor was sick for two weeks with the
malarial fever, and Mr. Stark was sick
one week. The rest, were none too well.
The medical, attendance was good. Our
hotel offered fair accommodations and
was cool, because of the proximity of the
beach. Our laboratory, which we fitted up
in a house near by, was very warm.
"The sickness of our party came at an
inopportune time, as we were planning an
exnedition to the Atlantic; coast. . How
ever, I did get as far as the top of the
ridge, where the canal makes the big cut..
A new company is working on the canal
now, and hopes to demonstrate the possi
bility of its construction and thereby in
fluence capital to invest. Labor is very
cheap, and the company employs about
2000 men, who receive about 80 cents a day
in Colombia money, which equals about
30 cents in gold. Prices are high, how
ever, as foreign goods pay a duty of 10 per
cent.
. "The Bay of Panama is a very pretty
sheet of water, although its low shores are
not las picturesque as the : . high, rocky
shores of San Francisco Bay. In the I
middle are some islands, high, rugged and !
picturesque; around wnich we used to fish
in a boat. It. 'was very ; exciting, as, after
we had exploded the dynamite the sharks
would rush in great numbers for the
fish and dash the spray over the
boat. The frigate birds would swoop
down, and seize the fish. Our boat was
clumsy, and often we would be going for a
very fine specimen several feet off only to
see it grabbed by a bird or swallowed by a
shark. We - worked with dipnets, and
olten had a very hard time to yet our
share of the spoils. Sometimes the bay
was rough and the fish would be dashed
on the rocks, and it was very dangerous to
approach the rocky shores, and we ; . nar
rowly escaped swamping several times. It
was exciting at times and had its pleasures,
although most of it was hard work."
The Intercollegiate Debate.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., March
26.â The date for the Intercollegiate debate
has been set for .April 25, the day on which
the two colleges will compete on the track.
The Berkeley debaters wished it to be held
on the 18th on account of their examina
tions in May, but the Stanford people
wished to have it on the 25th, as more
Stanford students could attend. This cives
one week more preparation to the Stanford
debaters, which they will use to good ad
vantage.
AVBVRX TEACHER'S SUIT.

AUBURN, Cal.. March 26.â T. L. Her
bert, a schoolteacher, bas commenced suit
for |30,000 damages against the railroad
company. On the evening of June 18,
1895, he was driving to his home below

POMOXA'S WOMAX SUFFRAGISTS.
Close of a Series of Meetings âA. Xeto
Woman's Politics.
POMONA, Cal., March 26.â The woman
suffragists of this city have closed a two
days' series of meetings, addressed by Mrs.
Helen M. Gougr.r and several local speak
ers. The meetings have been well at
tended by ladies, but comparatively few
gentlemen *vere present at any of the
sessions.
Mrs. Gougar made a strong appeal for
the granting of suffrage to women in the
interest of the prohibition of the liquor
traffic. Aside from that issue she plainly
indicated that she is a radical free-trade
Democrat on the tariff question and a
Populist on most other subjects. She said :
"Any man who will help to drag the old
tariff cadaver forth from its resting-place
into a political campaign ought to be
killed politically beyond the power of
resurrection."
She said further that the money question
was the cause of all the ills of this country
and referred to Ignatius Donnelly as the
leading industrial writer of this country.
Among other radical reforms Mrs.
Gougar advocated Government ownership
of railroads, and loudly denounced C. P.
Huntiogton and the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company.
The woman suffragists are enthusiastic
over the meetings, but few voters in this
locality take any stock in Mrs. Gougar's
extreme Ideas on industrial and financial
subjects.
THE NEWS OF SAN JOSE
A San Francisco Lady Sues to
Recover $2500 Worth
of Jewelry.
Martin Ortega, a Man of Many Crimes,
Commits Another Highway
Robbery.
SAN JOSE, Cal., March 26.â Caroline
Colton Martin of San Francisco commenced
i a suit In the Superior Court to-day against
C. A. Armstrong of this city to recover a
set of diamonds and pearls valued at $2500
or their equivalent.
The jewels consist of a brooch and ear
rings set with diamonds and pearls, and
so arranged as to be converted into a brace
let. In the complaint the plaintiff alleges
that Armstrong came wrongfully into
possession of the jewels on October 29 last,
and although she has demanded her jew
elry he has refused to return them.
The suit is the sequel of an escapade of !
Charles M. Comstock. The latter was
formerly much respected in society in San
Francisco, Oakland and elsewhere, and
was reputed to have wealthy relatives in
the East. In October of last year he ob
tained the jewelry from Mrs. Martin, who
is a daughter of General Colton, under
false pretenses. After getting possession
of the- jewelry, consisting of a number of
fine diamonds, he pawned them in San
Francisco for $1100. Subsequently he bor
rowed $250 from C. A. Armstrong in this
city. To secure Armstrong he gave the
latter the pawn tickets, and he redeemed
the jewelry for $1100. Comstock disap
peared : about this time, and Mrs. Martin
made a demand for the return of her jew
elry. This was refused, an it was not pro
posed to reimburse Armstrong for what
he had been out in the transaction.
The suit begun' here yesterday is to de
termine whether or not Mrs. Martin can
secure the return of her valuables without
satisfyiug any claim that Armstrong has
in the premises. >.^ â¢â¢ v : Â«.Â»*.

ATTEMPT TO ROB
THE BALLOT-BOX.
Incident of Santa Rosa's
Contest for Carnival
Queen.
THE THIEF IS FOILED.
Guerneville to Send a Thousand
Votes in a Lump for Its
Favorites.
MISS SARA HALL IX THE LEAD
Mrs. L. W. Burris Is a Splendid
Secondâ How the Other Leaders
Stand.
SANTA KOSA, Cal., March 26.â A
daring attempt to rob the ballot-box in the
Carnival Queen contest was made here
to-night.
The box, which is about two feet square,
occupies a prominent place in the store of
C. A. Wright & Co. on Fourth street. It
is situated about twenty feet from the
door, and is generally under the watchful
eyes of Mr. Wright or some cf his em
ployes.
To-night about (5:30 there was no one in
the store but George Day, one of the clerks,
Mr. Wright having stepped into an adjoin
ing store, and every one else connected
with the store being at supper. Mr. Day,
who was engaged in the back end of the
store, saw a well dressed man enter the
store and proceed directly to the ballot
box. Thinking that it was one of the
numerous voters who wished to send bis
favorite candidate a little nearer the top
of the list, Day gave the man no further
notice. The stranger seemed to be deeply
absorbed in scanning the list of probable
Queens, and kept out of the clerk's sight
behind the box.
Finally the suspicions of the clerk be
came aroused by a loud crackling noise
from the box and he rushed to the front of
the store. The thief evidently did not
relish the idea of a tussle with the robust
form approaching and without further
delay took to his heels and was quickly
lost to view.
An examination of the box showed that
the thief had forced open the sliding door
from which the ballots are removed and
that he had evidently used some force in
doing so. -
Mr. Day could give no definite descrip
tion of the man as it was just in the dusk
of evening, but feels certain that he was a
stranger. It is not thought that the thief
succeeded in abstracting any of the money,
with which the box was fairly well loaded,
the noise made in breaking open the slid
ing lid having instantly warned Mr. Day
of his purpose.
The voting to-day wa3 more than usually
brisk and the friends of Miss Sara Hall
were unusually active. The rumor that
the wheelmen had decided to cast their
votes for Mrs. Burris led many to believe
that this popular lady would greatly in
crease her lead.
Rumors were also abroad that Guerne
ville would send in 1000 or more votes for
Miss Custer, the favorite from the red
woods. But when the votes were counted
more than two-thirds of the little white
envelopes bore the name of Miss Sara
Hall, and the beautiful daughter of Super
visor Hall now leads by about ten votes.
Among the new names found in the box
to-night is that of Miss Sarah Jacobs.
Miss Jacobs is a handsome brunette, of
fine form and pleasing manners, and has
hosts of warm friends.
The vote for the leaders now stands as
follows: Miss Sara Hall, 321; Mrs. L. W.
Burris, 3ll; Miss Mattie Foisyth, 165; Miss
Annie Koch, 127; Miss Alice Ayers, 102.
A LOS OATOS MANAGER.
Alleged' to Have Victimized Many Ac
quaintances and Skipped."
LOS GATOS, Cai,., March 28.â H. J.
Butler, manager of the American Insti
tute at Los Gatos, is pursuing a course
which will undoubtedly. get him into the
toils of the law.
â  For the past two years he has been man
ager of the. institute, during which time
he has made several trips to this city upon
business, forming many acquaintances!
Monday he arrived in town and promised
to remain until the following day, during
which time he would straighten some
claims against the institute. He, however,
as far as can be. learned, did nothing in
the way of -settling the indebtedness. He
did succeed in getting a professional gen
tleman to indorse a draft at the Modesto
Bank on the Los Gatos Bank for $50.
The check was sent into the bank, but
re turned to-day not honored. Accom
panying the returned check was a letter
fro in the Los Gatos Bank announcing the
fact ; that Butler has \no account at r the
bank, and further that the drafts drawn
by him had been returned to Napa, Mar
tinez and other points where i he had
drawn on the bank ; and victimized ac
quaintances for $50 in each instance.
It is believed that Butler has gone south.
When here : he said he had just arrived
from Humboldt County. .

EUREKA TRADE DISPUTE
The Oregon Railway and Naviga
tion Company Finds Some
Supporters.
Say They Feel Like Taking Advan
tage of the Opportunities
Offered.
PORTLAND, Or., March 26.â Relative
to the opposition of San Francisco mer
chants to the maintenance by the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company of a
steamer line to Eureka, it seems that the
Oregon company has little to fear, since
the 'Eureka Chamber of Commerce has
just sent a letter to the Oregon Railway
and Navigation people expressing, it is
understood, the chamber's appreciation of
what the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company has done for Eureka, and re
ferring favorably to the Oregon company's
attitude in the dispute over the division of
trade between Eureka and San Francisco.
The letter states that the men-bants and I
shipping men feel like taking advantage i
of the opportunity offered to say they are !
glad the Orpjjon company takes "a hand in
the competition and that there is no dis
crimination.
EEL MITER RAILROAD.
ltÂ» Completion Will Cut Off the Portland
Trade.
FORTUNA, Cal., March 26.â1t is cur
rently reported here that the Eureka and
Eel River Railroad, which is a prom
inent railroad of the county, running
south toward San Francisco a distance of
about thirty-five miles, intersected by the
Pacific Lumber Company, which extends
further south a distance of some eighteen
miles following the Eel River, has been
bonded to San Francisco parties sup
posed to be interested in the Donahue
line. The gap from the terminus of the
Pacific Lumber Company to the Donahue
lino is about eighty-five miles. It is a
country totally undeveloped at present
and with a railroad will make homes for
thousands of people. If this connection is
made it will undoubtedly cut off the Port
land (Or.) trade from tliis section of the
country. The Portland wholesale houses
have for some time been sending repre
sentatives who have been receiving large
orders owing to the cheap rates from
Portland.
CHASGE OF SCHEDULE.
Twelve Hours to He Saved, Between St.
Fnttl and Portland.
PORTLAND, Or., March 26.â 0n the
first of the month there is to be a genoral
change in schedule on the Oregon Railway
and Navigation trains. Passenger trains
between Portland and Hnntington will run
via Walla Walla for the first time. The
time between Spokane and Portland will
be shortened, and on the first the Great
Northern will run through cars to Port
land, having entered into arrangement
with the Oregon Railway and Navigation
Company for an interchange of cars and
mileage.
One important advantage of this move is
that the time between St. Paul and Port
land will be shortened twelve hours.

Departure of Edward Everett Bale.
BANT A BARBARA, Cal., March 26.-
The Rev. Edward Everett Hale, who with
his family has been spending the last two
months in close retirement at the lovely
Hazard residence on Mission Hill, left for
his Boston home to-day.
TWO SAILORS STABBED.
C. Peterson Probably fatally Wounded
and W. Alexander also Severely Cut.
Late last evening as William Alexander
and C. Peterson of the Sailors' Home and
H. 1. Butler of the revenue cutter Bear
were walking along Pacific street, near
Kearny, they were assaulted by a gang of
young men.
In consequence a general fight ensued,
which culminated in Alexander and
Peterson being severely stabbed, the latter
probably fatally, Butler beinf severely
bruised about the head and chest.
At 1 o'clock this morning a '-nan who
fave his name as James Graham, but who is
nown to the police as Jas. McMillan, was
arrested and identilied as one of the gang
who had assaulted the sailors. He could
not be charged with the cutting, but was
detained without bail pending an investi
gation.
TRIED TO STRANGLE HER.
Robert Boyd Arrested on a Charge of
Assaulting; Iloaa MÂ»rtin.
At 2 o'clock this morning Robert Boyd
was arrested on Pine street, near Dupont,
and charged with having tried to strangle
Rosa Martin, a woman of tiie town.
The woman stated that Boyd entered
her room, tnrew her upon the floor and
seized her by the throat.
She screamed for help and her compan
ion ran to her assistance, and Boyd tried
to escape, but fell into the arms of Offices

Quite a Number, but They Have
Been Sold by a Weil-Known
Merchant Who Believes
in Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla.
REARM STREET HAS ITS SAI.
It Is as Enthusiastic as Market Street
and Without a Dissent
ing Voice.
Tt would be unfair to suppose that there
are not some people to he found in San
Francisco who do not heartily indoi3e on
their own experience the great home rem
edy, Joy's Vegetable Farsaparilla, for in
dubitably there are many people who have
not used it, and possibly a few of those
â who have not would be in better health
to-day if they had. At least that is begin
ning to dawn upon my mind. The way in
which the prominent business men in this
City leave their own interests in order to
say nice things about Joy's Vegetable Sar
saparilla is astonishing. To the inter
viewer it seems almost unprecedented.
What is usually weary work has in this
instance proved interesting and encourag
ing. Ask any merchant as to whether he
has ever heard of Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilla and the chances are about ten to
one that he will say "Yes." If he has
heard of it the chances are more than one
hundred to one that he will indorse itâ
that he will say that it is good. He will
say, "It dees what it was intended to
do," and further that he knows whereof
be speaks, either from experience or from
some one whose word he is unable to
doubt.
It seemed to be the fairest way, as I had
decided that I had got a clear expression
of the Market-street opinion, to go on to
another good business street in search of in
formation about Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparil
ia. It was this way : It appeared to be possi
ble that one section of the busiest part of
town might feel kindly disposed toward the
remedy, while another part, equally im
portant from a commercial standpoint,
mieht not, and so far as commercial inter
ests are concerned, possibly Kearnv and
Market streets may be allowed to divide
them, and so with my instructions plainly
in front of my nose to get an unbiased
opinion as to the merits of Joy'? Vegetable
SBrsaparilla, I determined yesterday to
talk to a few Kearny-street merchants, and
I chose the biccks which were most fre
quented. It is far better to get the opin
ion of a man who is well known and whose
word may be depended cm than it is .to
hunt up some individual who has never
been heard of before, and who probably
will never be 1 heard of asrain, so 1 went no
farther north in my investigations than
Bush street. Every man I met indorsed
the remedy, includine a man who bad
sold a quarter of a million huts since he
has been in business, and a querulous
shoe merchant who declined to give his
name for publication. Here's what they
have said :
ABE HARSHAT/L VOICES THE POPULAR OPINION.
There is a sign, and a brass one at that,
inscribed Abe Harshall. outside the store
12 Kearnv street. It indicates the name
of one of the most popular Native Sons
who is in business in the City. Mr. Har
shall, as his window very plainly indi
cates, is a tailor, a "custom" and not a
ready-made one. He has in stock cer
tainly one of the finest selections of im
ported goods that one could find in the
City, and while it would scarcely seem, j
wise to ask a man who has made his repu
tation largely on the fact that he carries
imported cloths as to whether he would
fi>eak favorably of what is strictly a home
product, I thought it best to interview
him, keeping ever in mind the desire to I
produce an impartial statement as to the j
general opinion as to the merits of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Mr. Harshall met
me courteously, and said in reply to my
query: "I certainly approve the use of
sarsaparilla in spring time, and, I thinfc it
is a good thing to keep in the house the
â whole year round. So far as the best is
concerned, I have no hesitation whatever.
in indorsing Joy's. We have tried it, and |
we know that the Californian remedy is
certainly best of all. Sarsaparilla, of
course, of any kiud, is good, but the ques
tion has always appeared to me in this
way. Do we know what we are getting
when we buy what is called sarsaparilla
from a drugstore ? I am convinced from
what my friends tell me and what I knew
myself that Joy's is purely a vegetable'
sarsaparilla, and if this is true it is cer
tainly the only safe one to take. I know
a score of people who take it regularly,
and more than one of them swear by it."
Now, all this was said in the clear, keen,
straightforward way in which Mr. Har
ghall says everything. He is very popular.
Since he has occupied his store, No. 12
Kearny street, he has made more friends
than possibly any man in his business has
made in the same length of time. He says
he is a "popular price" tailor. Certainly
he is a good ail-round fellow, and person
ally popular in every sense of the word.
His patrons include some of the best people
in the city, although his prices are mod
erate, ana whenever he makes a customer
he invariably holds that customer's trade
and his friendship, too.
A QUARTER OF A MILLION HATS.
I skipped a block, or nearly a block, and
dropped into Mr. Col man's large hat
emporium at No. 130 Kearny street. Mr.
Colman is a man bo well known to every
newspaper man in town that, even if I
were not in search of information, I think I I
should have gone in to shake him by the
hand. He wore the usual smile that be
tokens nothing wrong with the liver, or
conscience either, and when questioned as
to the business he was doing, be said he
was glad to be able to report increasing
trade.
"You do a pretty good business always,
Mr. Colman?" I asked.
(Here, in parenthesis, it may be stated j
that Mr. Colman is the San Francisco
agent for Dunlop's hats).
"Well, yes; I have no reason to com
plain. I have been in the hat business for
the past seven years."
'During that time how many hats have
you sold, Mr. Colman?"
"Well, I suppose nearly a quarter of a
million," he replied after some consider
ation.
"And what is your opinion of Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla, may I ask?"
"I have not taKen the remedy myself,"
was the reply, "but I suppose I can tell
you bow highly some friends of mine in
dorse it.'
"Well, what have you heard about it?"
"I have heard repeatedly from friends
of mine, in whose integrity I put the
utmost confidence, that it is an excellent
blood purifier and general tonic. They
say too, that it always does good. They
tefi'me that it relieves dyspepsia, and from
what they say you may quote me as in
dorsing Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla in the
most emptiatic way. 1 ' .. ' .
Mr. Colman has been in San Francisco
for the last forty-one years, and during
that time be has built up, purely by bis
own effort and a conscientious spirit of
rectitude, a trade which increases steadily
and regularly. There is no better place in
the City to buy a hat than at 130 Kearny j
street.
MB. CUMMO'GS TAKES IT To THE STORE.
The rain wa3 coming down and I was
getting wet on the east side of Kearny
street, so I made a diagonal cut across to
the west side, and the first shelter that
seemed inviting was the jewelry-store
which has been so many years conducted
under the name of Cummings' Sons. W.
Cummines, who is no*vthe sole proprietor,
although" the old firm name is still
retained, met me and in reply to a few
queries stated that he had been here for
twenty-one veais, nearly all of which time
he has spent in his present line of business.
Probably Mr. Cummings has devoted him
self as faithfully and as conscientiously
to business as any man could do, and the
result has been tbe confidence of the
public. "Do you know anything of Joy's
vegetable Sarsaparilla?" I asked him
rather abruptly.
"Well, do I," said Mr. Cummings in
reply, "just pardon me a moment." He
walked back to his office and produced a
two-thirds used bottle of Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. "That is what I know about
it," he said. "I think so much of it as a
remedy that I am never without it. We
ase it in the family at home, and we use it
regularly and continually, and I always
have it with me in the store."
"You may think it curious," he con
tinued, "but that is one of the things that
I put in the safe at night."
"For what do you use it, Mr. Cum
mings?"
"I have worked so hard," he. replied,
"that I often feel run downâtired out. I
feel that nay system needs invigorating,
and 1 have yet to see the time when Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla did not bring me
relief; and let me add," h.e went on, "that
my wife is as enthusiastic as 1 am about its
merits, and we think so highly of it, in
deed we feel that it is such a good blood
purifier and system- builder, that we give
it to one .of our children who is a trifle
deaf, and I really have belief it will help
the aeafness."
"But is not that rather more than you
could expect of it?" I queried.
"Well, it has done so much for us all
that I even hope that it may help deaf
ness, but at any rate I am sure that as a
tonic and blood purifier it cannot be ex
celled."
This is the opinion of a man who has
been a business leader, a man of commer
cial importance and a man whose integ
rity no one will doubt, and the high praise
for the great home remedy was absolutely
voluntary. It was indeed startling to a
degree. Mr. Cummings has sold within
the last two years prooably about $20,000
of silver and plated ware alone, and with
him business appears to be on the.in
crease, a fact which may encourage some
of the people who are inclined to be a little
bit blue at this moment. He has got push
and energy, and has got talent and tact,
and he has tne somewhat rare character
istic of being able to tell his customers the
truth about everything which he tries to
sell. This sort ofpolicy wins in the end.
MR. M. E. FRANK, THE GKEAT FURNISHING
GOODS MAiN.
By the time I bad finished my interest
ing "chat with Mr. Cummings Jupiter
Pluvius had seen fit to discontinue
work (possibly for the lunch hour), and so
I recrossed the street in order to see Mr.
M. E. Frank of 238 Kearny street, one of
the most genial men and one of the most
sensible talkers that does business on the
big cross-town thoroughfare. Mr. Frank
is invariably "head over heels" in busi
ness. He is bright, brisk and full of life
as well as of business, and while I inter
viewed him he continued all the time to
be doing something. As a gentleman's
furnishing goods man his standing in the
City is unique. He has been over twenty
years in the neighborhood in which his
store now is, and during that time, for the
number of square feet that his various
places of business have occupied, it is
probable that he has had more money pass
through his hands than any one.
"Do you ever use a sarsaparilla?" I
asked him.
"Yes, I do, and I have some which I
take regularly."
"Did you ever take Joy's?"
"I am taking it now," "he replied.
"Why do you take it?"
"Because I think it is a good spring
medicine; because I invariably feel bene
fited from its use, and because it is a
home remedy. It isjmade here in Califor
nia, and as long as 1 find any Californian
product to be good, I believe in helping
the 'chap around the corner.' I am in
favor all the time and every time of trying
to keep our money at home. I make my
living from Californians, and I am quite
ready to do whatever I can to help all
Californians. Of course, as far as this
particular remedy is concerned, it has ex
ceptional merit, and that may have in
duced me to use it, but I am delighted to
know that so good a remedy as it is, is
pnrely a home product. My heart and
soul is in California, my heart and soul is
in her productions; my heart and soul is
in the interests of her people, and no one
can ever say that they can find me lacking
in any way in supporting home industry.
And in conclusion, Mr. Frank said, "Yes,
you can quote me as saying Joy's Vege
table fcarsaparilla is without doubt a most
valuable remedy, and I know it, because I
have proved it."
For over twenty years the man who
chooses to look for bargains in hosiery,
neckwear and shirts has been accus
tomed before buying to see what M. E.
Frank had got. "Mr. Frank is progressive
and aggressive to a degree. If there is a
late style he has it. If there is a new
pattern Frank's is the place to look for it,
and possibly the reason he is enabled to
sell things at such extremely low rates as
he does Ts tnat he started business with
an idea to accept a minimum of profit,
seeing that evidently he would be enabled
by this commendable business principle
to make a big "turn over." Personally
Mr. Frank is a most amiable man, and
his seven or eight employes have been
selected with a good deal of care. Mr.
Frank knows that it â¢is pleasant to be
treated as a gentleman, and he insists that
every customer who comes to him shall be
treated in a similar way.
MR. F. SCHOETfLEB TALKS.
Down came the rain again, so I had to
seek shelter once more on the west side of
the thoroughfare. I walked straight into
the store of Mr. F. Schoettler, 329 Kearny
street, and found that genial gentleman
cutting a piece of imported goods. Mr.
Schoettler is one of the naturalized citi
zens of whom California is proud.. One of
those people who has brought capital to
the State, who employs labor and pays it
well, and who endeavors to adopt a busi
ness policy of "not hogging it all." His
business in twelve years has grown con
siderably, and now it represents probably
one of the nicest and best medium-class
trades in the City. Aske-d as to whether
he had ever used Joy's Vegetable Sarsapa
rilla, or whether he had ever hear,d of it.
Mr. Schoettler replied : "Yes, I have heard
of it very considerably. I have heard it
indorsed highly.' 1
"In what way?"
"As a blood purifier and as a tonic.
Sarsaparilla is recognized everywhere as
being an excellent remedy for purifying
the. blood, but when I say sarsaparilla, I
do not intend to be understood as meaning
any combination of mineral drugs. What
I mean is the vegetable sarsaparilla."
"You know that Joy's Vegetable Sarsa
parilia is purely a vegetable compound of
Californian soil, do you not?" I asked.
"Of my own knowledge, I cannot say
that I do," said Mr. Schoettler, "but I
have beard it stated time and time again."
"May I quote you as indorsing Joy's
Vegetable barsaparilla?" I asked.
"Certainly, not only on it; own account
as a remedial agent (and I have heard that
it is good for dyspepsia and liver troubles,
as well as being a good stomach regulator),
but I believe in supporting home .produc
tions. This is hardly necessary though in
the case of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla,
for I think it has proved its superiority
beyond a doubt."
This was the end of the first day's inter
views on Kearnv street. It did seem as
though one might have gone in every store
that there was and found indorsements. I
tried to see Julius Raphael, the great
clothier, but he was out. Had he been ac
cessible 1 should have quoted his opinion
as faithfully as I have endeavored to cite
tha> of other people. I was unfortunate
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1896.
enough to miss Frank Maskey, that great,
whole-souled candy man, and I could not
find Raphael Weill of the White House,
but it does seem to me tdat I got a fair ex
pression of the Kearny-street merchants'
opinions as to the merits of Joy's Vegetable
Sarsaparilla. It was one clean, straight,
unvarying indorsement. Condensed into
a sentence it might be allowed to run this
way â Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla is a
grand tonic, is an excellent blood purifier;
it helps tne kidneys and liver and the syij
tem generally. William Chenhalls.

It Was the Dog.
In a well-known street in London a
beggar was often seen plodding about with
a small dog. The dog was held by a piece
of chain, and had round his neck a
placard, with "Pity the blind" in large
red letters. Mr. T- â , passing one day,
dropped a sixpence into the man's out
stretched hand. "Halloa!" he cried, as
be was turning away, "was that a half
sovereign I gave yon?"
"No, sirâ no," answered the beggar;
"only sixpence."
"So," said Mr. T , "you are not
blind, then, after all?"
"Bless you, sir, no!" he replied. "You
see, the placard refers to the dog. He's
blindâ not me!"â Tit-Bits.

BELLRINGER WON EASILY
Beverwyck Handicap Steeple
chase a Gift for the
Jumper.
FIRST CHOICES FARED WELL.
Zamar II Scores Againâ Major Cook
Beat Babe Murphy a Blockâ La
Mascota in Front.
Racegoers who ventured oat in the
squally weather yesterday did not see
much of a contest for the Beverwyck stake,
decided over tbe full steeplechase course,
about two and a quarter miles. The guar
anteed value to the winning jumper was
the tidy sum of $1500, and six accepted the
handicapper's allotments. Bellringer
looked nicely placed with but 153 pounds
to shoulder and he was rightfully made a
prime favorite, the general price in the
ring being 8 to 5, although nearing post
time a shade better was obtainable. JO C
looked well treated with 134 pounds up,
but â he has been performing with poor
success of late and v/as practically friend
less, going back in the betting from 1 to 12.
Nestor and Arundel looked to have an out
side chance, but My Luck, delegated to
carry 150 pounds, was held in altogether
too high esteem by the handicapper, and
although commanding considerable back
ing, cut no figure in the running. The
favorite alternated with The Lark in tak
ing the jumps in the lead, until the tenth
hurdle was reached, when Spence gave
Bellringer his head and he snreadeagled
his field, passing the stand fully fifteen
lengths in front of Arundel, lighting for
his head. The Lark, who tired badly the
last quarter Of a mile, finished in third
place. With about twelve pounds more
on the back cf the winner there might
have been a semblance of a contest.
The showers of rain had made the track
heavy, but there was very little mud fly
ing. The favorites met with much better
success than on the preceding day, four of
the six sent into the starter's hands reach
ing the tape first.
A five-furlong scramble, run over the in
side course with tue weights raised twenty
eight pounds above the scale, was the first
event decided and resulted in a very easy
win for the 7 to 5 favorite, Huntsman, with
W. Clancy up, who led from start to finish.
Fond Hope, a 40 to 1 outsider, finished in
the place.
The good youngster, Zamar 11, appeared
for the first time in the colors of the St.
Louis turfman, Dan Honig, and celebrated
the occasion by capturing the four-furlong
dash cleverly "by a length, with the top
heavy 7 to 10 choice, Adam Andrew, at his
heels. The winner opened in the betting
at 6 to 5 and was allowed to- recede until 2 to
1 was offered against him, .finally closing
at 9 to 5.
"Jack" Folia nsbee's fast filly, La Mas
cota, looked the best of the eight that
started in the fourth race, a cheap five
and a half furlongs, selling affair, and was
heavily played at 4to 5. She was cut off
at the far turn, but got through next the
rail, swinging into the stretch and passing
Crawfoid, won at the wire by a length.
Banjo came strong at the end, taking the
place from Crawford.
There were but four starters in the mile
selling race, and the wise division "killed"
it. Opening at 9to 10, Babe Murphy was
played down to 7to 10. At the last mo
ment the educated money went in on
Major Cook, and from twos his odds speed
ily tumbled down to 3to 2. Little Hewitt,
astride the first choice, lost several lengths
making the first turn, and the Major,
opening up a big gap of daylight, won
pulling up.
The Jasc event was a six- furlong sprint,
ending in an easy win for the 3to choice.
Joe Terry, who outfooted Nelson through
the stretch. The latter was backed down
from 12 to 3 to 1, and looked a winner up
to the last furlong.
IT IS A PRIVATE AFFAIR
The Mexican International Ex
position to Be Held Next
Year.
Former Vice-President of the Mid
winter Fair Is the Poo-Ban
of the Enterprise.
Charles Asher of the Washoe Club and
one of the managers of the Baldwin Ho
tel has returned from a trip to Mexico
where he went on business on the 12th of
this month.
At the close of fhe Midwinter Fair in
this City, when Viscount Kene de Cornelly
first broached the proposition of an exhi
bition to be held in Mexico, Charles Asher
was his warmest supporter. He agreed to
put up funds and did, which enabled the
then impecunious Viscount to go to Mex
ico and enlist the good will of President
Diaz in the matter of strangers coming
into his domain to hold an international
exposition. This Cornelly did in a meas
ure, President Diaz agreeing to not inter
fere in the' matter. However, the Presi
dent has not as yet given the private en
terprise the oificial stamp of the Mexican
Government. Still, the promoters of the
affair expect that as soon as things are in
such condition as to satisfy Diaz that the
exposition will be a success he will author
ize an appropriation toward it and invite
all foreign governments to attend.
One of Cornelly's first moves was to or
ganize the Mexican National Exposition
Land Company. This institution pur
chased 600 acres of land belonging to Senor
Mario for about $250,000. This they
bonded for $750,000 through the New York
Trust Company, and immediately they
began the work of preparing the land for
the site of the exposition.
The executive corps of the exposition
was then given out to the public as fol
lows: Director-General, Ignacio Bejarano;
Juan R. Dos Pessos, representative of the
Mexican National Exposition ana Land
Company; German Bulle, general mana
ger for the United States, and Viscount
Rene de Comelly, director of concessions
and the foreign department.
Affairs havinir progressed thus far
Charles Asher decided it was about time
he take a little trip to see his old friend
the Viscount and make the latter keep the
promise he made over a year and a half
ago, that if he were successful in bringing
about a Mexican exposition he would give
Asher tne sole and exclusive gambling
privileges in consideration of the funds,
already advanced.
The Viscount redeemed his pledge, and
Mr. Asher has the concession now snugly
tucked in in his inside pocket. His vic
tory, however, was not exactly a walk
over, as others, namely, a Mexican who is
in the gambling business himself and who
pays the Government $20,000 per month
for the exclusive right to conduct gam
bling in Mexico, was after the plum. This
man, it is claimed, clears $1,000,000 each
year in the five "casinos" he runs. He
was favored by the Mexican contingent of
the executive committee, who kept put
ting Asher off day after day, promising
him an ans,wer "manana. 1 '
It was at this juncture that Viscount
Cornelly stepped into the breach and won
the concession for his friend. He ex
plained that the slight given Asher would
probably be resented, and the exposition
would suffer. But, the concession being
granted to an American would encourage
the people of the United States to exhibit
at and visit the exposition. The Mexican
gambler gracefully withdrew.
Now, it is confidently expected by Asher
that he and his associates â Mike Katztn
stein and Joe Ullman, the New York
bookmaker â will divide up a cold million
dollars profit at the close of the Mexican
exposition.
"Aside from the privilege of running the
Casino, which will be a magnificent Monte
Carlo." Mr. Asher said, "I have also se
cured concessions to run a scenic railway,
shooting the chutes and I will also form
part of the 'Mazzaroth Company.' This
is something entirely new. It is an
Egyptian illusion, the building being a \
representation of the pyramids of Egypt,
and, on the inside, an operating electrical
display of the planets, moon and solar
system.
"It is expected by the promoters of the
exposition that it will be a great success.
On the 14th of April Viscount Rene de i
Cornelly will leave for Europe to get more
concessionaires. The exposition will not
open until November. 1897, but, next
month, after an expenditure of $100,000 for
beautifying the grounds, the Mexicans
will baptize them with a great floral fete."
Perfumes for Horses.
There are some perfumes that are very
grateful to horses, however little credit a
horse may commonly receive for possess
ing delicacy of scent.
Horse-trainers are aware of the fact, and
make use of their knowledge in training
stubborn animals.
Many trainers have favorite perfumes,
the composition of which they keep a
secret, and it is the possession of this
means of appealing to the horse's esthetic
sense that enables so many of them to ac
complish such wonderful results.âPitts

COLLECTOR WISE UPHELD
Judge Morrow Decides That
Zante Currants Are
Dutiable.
IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA.
The Producer in This State Protected
and a Large Saving Is the
Result.
Judge Morrow yesterday rendered a
decision in the Zante currant cases,
holding that currants coming from
other places than the island of Zante
were Zante currants in the meaning
of the tariff law, and therefore subject
to duties. The Appraisers at New York
had decided that these currants wefe not
dutiable. This decision was reversed by
Judge Morrow. It means a great saving
to the California producer.
Collector Wise first brought the matter
up. He applied for a writ of review of the
questions of law involved in the decision
of the Board of United States General Ap
praisers at New York in the matter of the
classification of 500 barrels of currants at
San Francisco, which were invoice as
"Plum Pudding Label J Currants." The
Collector classified them as Zante cur
rants and assessed a duty of l] 4 cents
a pound thereon. The importers filed
a protest with the Board of General
Aprraisers, claiming that the currants
were not Zante currants, but currants
grown in the province of Greece, and
therefore free of duty as dried fruit not
otherwise provided for in the Wilson bill.
The Appraisers upheld the protest and
thereupon Collector Wise referred the
question to the United States court for
final adjudication. Judge Morrow re
viewed the testimony at great length and
held that the term "Zante currant" used
in paragraph 217 of the Wilson act was
employed in a commercial sense, as under
stood in this country, and applies to all
currants of that name or kind wherever

produced in foreign countries, and that it
has no reference, technically, to currants
coming alone from the island of Zante.
No restrictions or exceptions as to places
are either expressly or impliedly made
The court says:
The mere fact that the currants comprising
the importation In this case bear the namo
Zante, an island in the archipelago, is of itself
devoid of particular significance as indicating
that Gongress meant to tax currants whicS
come only from the island of Zante. As a mat
ter of fact, the evidence tended to show that
much larger quantities of Zante currants, so
called, are grown and exported from the
provinces of Greece than from the Island of
Zante, and that those grown on the mainland
are still known commercially in this country
as Za'nte currants. In other words, Zante cur
rants is the generic commercial term tor this
species of grape when dried into raisins. It
would be unreasonable to suppose that.Con
press, in imposing duties on Zante currants in
the general language employed, intended not to
tax those which come in much larger quanti
ties from other localities. Such an interpreta
tion would result in an unfair and unwar
ranted discrimination between foreign places
pi produce, which, in the absence of clear and
unambiguous words to the contrary, should
not be imputed to Congress.
MAKGUERITE'S MS.
I Discovery of Unknown Writings of the
Renaissance Queen.
Queen Marguerite of Navarre, the sister
i of Francis i and grandmother of Henry
j IV of France, has been accorded a promi
nent place in French literature, for her
collection of novels, the "Heptameron."
Besides this, the religious book, "Le
Miroir dv Chretien" (The Mirror of a
I Christian) has been known to be
i her work. Quite recently Professor Abel
j Lefranc. the secretary of the Col
' lege de France, made the important dis
i covery that a manuscript in the Na
tional Library, bearing the number 24,218,
contains heretofore unknown works of
Manrnerite of Navarre. The manuscript,
which was written about the middle of the
sixteenth century, contains in some 200
pages about 20,000 lines in verse ; there are
two epic poems; ten epistles in verse; two
didactic poems, "Le Navire" and "Les
Prisons," and a great number of short re
ligious songs,"Ciiansons Spirituelles." One
of the mostcurious poems in "Le Navire,"
which is so called becaiiae- Marguerite
compares herself in it with a vessel, which,
after the death of Francis I, has lost its
captain.
Countess Fritz Hohenan is a cousin of
the German Emperor. She has this winter
introduced the 'custom in Brussels for
ladies to ride to bounds astride. Beyond
this she hab organized a club of aristocraric
women who are to lend their countenance
to this most unseemly style.

<t i THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Rainey, Mahoney and Kelly may be
three of a kind, but it is a poor hand to
draw to.
The best thing Democracy can do will
be to drive Buckley to the woods and drop
Rainey in a cavity.
President Kruger may be pat enough in
the Transvaal, but if he ever goes to Lon
don his name will be Dennis.
Whether he comes for business, politics
or recreation Mr. Depew will rind a Cali
fornia welcome wide open for him.
On one point at any % rate the popular
Vote this year will be unanimous. All par
ties are declaring for an honest dollar.
The movement of the funding bill has
stopped for a time, but the buzz-saw of
public opinion keeps up its revolution.
"While one portion of the Democratic
camp is under a Rainey spell, all the rest
is Deginning to look like an arid desert.
The recent understanding between Eng
land and Italy has become an avowed al
liance, and now everybody understands.
The Southern Pacific Company can have
pr- rom popular agitations the moment
ii ing to give the people a rest from
mono A y exactions.
There are good reasons why Democrats
should be late in selecting a candidate for
the Presidency, but what are the Populists
wailing for ?
The control of 20,000 miles of railroad

MANUFACTURING VOTERS.
The Call's expose of the ease with
which Chinese may be made citizens and
voters without the formality of having
been born in this country throws light
upon a danger which is far greater than it
might be. The Supreme Court of the
United States has yet to pass on the ques
tion whether a Chinese born in the United.
States is an American citizen, entitled to
the exercise of the franchise, but it seems
that in anticipation of a favorable ruling
Chinese in considerable numbers are pre
paring to produce evidence of American
birth as a prerequisite of registration,
and that it will be difficult, if not impos
sible, to expose any fraud that may be re
sorted to.
The two ways in which fraud may be
practiced are the certificates admitting
Chinese to this port as American natives
and certificates of American birth made
by physicians. In the former case the re
turn certificate will be accepted as compe
tent evidence and in the second it would
be extremely difficult to prove fraud. In
view of the innumerable scandals which
have arisen out of the sale of Chinese re
turn certificates, the impossibility of find
ing doctors willing to make untruthful
certificates of birth cannot be assumed. It
had been supposed that it was only the
certificates with which the customs au
thorities had to deal that represented a
danger, but tha recent decision by the
United States District Court on the subject
of citizenship based on birth has opened
up a possible new avenue of fraud.
This State has excellent laws requiring
records of births, but their constant neg
lect is a ceaseless scandal. ThÂ»se laws
were not intended merely for statistical
purposes. That, however, is not the point.
They are mandatory and a penalty for
their violation is imposed. Their proper
observance would be exceedingly useful in
many ways affecting the identification of
persons, and their neglect may work in
jury both to individuals and the State.
Only recently the announcement was
made that those charged with the per
formance of this duty were grossly neglect
ing it. Threats were made that unless the
law was obeyed in future punishment
would ensue, but in the absence of actual
punishment the threat carries no terrors.
While it would be easier to produce
fraudulent certificates of birth in the case
of Chinese than of persons of any other
nationality, it is conceivable that aliens
from other countries will learn the shr9wd
trick which the Chinese can play and will
bring it into operation. Special attention
is called to this matter for the reason that
it is something new and requires to be
vigorously met. It may be taken for
granted that if the Chinese are to be made
voters an astonishing number of native
Americans among them will appear, and
that they will support tbe interests of
China by advocating free trade.
A SIMPLE TRANSFER SYSTEM
NEEDED.
General Manager Yining of the Market
street Railway Company in his extreme
anxiety to carry out the policy of making
the lines under his supervision return "all
the traffic will bear" is in danger of inflict
ing on the patrons of the roads annoy
ances and impositions that they will not
be inclined to bear.
There is probably no city in the world in
which a more complicated system of
transfers exists. And it is this unnecessa
rily puzzling contrivance which causes
more tumbling and trouble to both the
carrier and the carried than any other
single factor.
There is no reason why the entire inter
change of traffic between the various lines
cannot be placed on the simplest basis.
As it is now one line transfers at so many
as half a dozen different points; hereto
the westbound cars of one line, farther
along to the eastbound cars of another
road, then to the northbound cars of a
third and so ort for half a dozen transfers.
Then on the return trip of this same car
an entirely different order of transferring
prevails. The wonder is not that the. pas
senger does not get thoroughly confused,
but that the conductors are able to fulfill
their duties as well as they do in the
various iines of distributing and receiving
transfers, collecting fares and stopping
ana starting their cars to meet the re
quirements of passengers. All these com
plications of the transfer system are in
vented for the one purpose of preventing
a few persons who have more time to
â¢waste than most individuals from riding
indefinitely in a circuit for a single fare.
.There is little question that all this red
tape could be abandoned with but a
trilling loss to the railway lines and with
much increased comfort and convenience
-to tbeir patrons.
As the transfer system of the Market
street Railway Company- exists to-day
there are several hundred points at wnich
passengers are compelled to change from
one line to another in order to reach their
destination. In view of this the least the
company should do is to make the trans
ferring process as simple a3 possible. This
would be accomplished to a great extent
by making a transfer from one line to an
other available for a ride either way on
the car to which the change is made. Ex
cept to regular daily patrons of the street
cars a trip on them requires all the time
and study that accompanies the scrutiny
of time cards preparatory to an overland
journey to New York.
AN IMPORTANT TEST.
As the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors is doubtful if the City has
the power to make the proposed expendi
ture that will transform the center of Van
Ness avenue from Market street to Fort
Mason into a continuous park the ques
tion may eventually resolve itself into a
test of public spirit on the part of the
property-owners on the avenue. The pro
posed improvement contemplates a strip
twenty-one feet wide in tne middle of trie
street planted to grass, shrubbery and trees
with seats and six feet of the sidewalk on
either side planted to grass and palms. The
estimated cost of the whole is 17 cents a
front foot, besides the cost of excavating.
Generally the property on the street is
owned and occupied by wealthy residents,
whose capital and enterprise constitute an
important factor in the business and pros
perity of the City. Being the handsomest
thoroughfare in the City its property com
mands high value. In its present form all
that distinguishes it from a commercial
street is the accident of an absence of
shops, but as the road is level there is at
present no business reason why it should
not be a commercial highway as well as
Polk street, except that the values are too
high for any besides large commercial es
tablishments. To transform it into a com
bination of park and boulevard, as the pro
posed improvement contemplates, -would
be to render it permanently unfit for com
mercial purposes.
An investment of something like 20 cents
a front foot in such an improvement would
undoubtedly bring a very large profit in
the shape of enhanced property values. It
would not be possible to place such an im
provement in any other street in town.
Van Ness avenue so ornamented would
forever have a distinctive character of ex

ceptional value. Every street from the
fashionable quarter of the Western Addi
tion crosses it. One end of it opens upon
Market street and the other touches Fort
Mason and the channel. It forms the
most important link in the chain of bonle
vards with Fort Mason, Lombard street,
the Presidio, the park and Golden Gate
avenue. There is no street so fortunately
situated.
Doubtless tbe Board of Supervisors, act
ing upon a petition of a sufficient prop
erty frontage, might compel all the prop
erty-owners to contribute toward the im
provement. It would be very much more
graceful and a finer exhibition of public
spirit for- the owners to make the improve
ment on their own motion. Whatever
course may be determined upon the prop
erty-owners have an opportunity to set a
most valuable example of public spirit.
By reason of s climate which would keep
the park in bloom and color all through
the year Van Ness avenue might be made
the most beautiful and famous boulevard
in the United States.
A SUGGESTIVE REMARK.
Chauucey M. Depew's talk with a Gall
interviewer at Los Acgeles was that odd
mixture of raillery and seriousness for
â¢which this man with a facile tongue is
famous, but he made some observations
which indicate a radical fault on the part
of Eastern capitalists. This fault it should
be the duty of California to cure.
"Neither Mr. Vanderbilt nor myself,"
he said, "has ever been in California
before. You know we New Yorkers are so
well satisfied with ourselves and our local
habits that we do not travel much. Mr.
Vffnderbilt and I finally came to the con
clusion that we would break through our
crust of exclusiveness and see California
for ourselves, believing that in doing so we
would get into closer touch with the peo
ple of this great State, learn to appreciate
your more wonderful resources and possi
bilities and go back to our work.invigor
ated both in body and mind."
In denying that the visit had any sig
nificance in connection with the recovery
of the Pacific roads' debt, be said: "We
have been offered lots of things for sale
since we struct the West. Ranches,
mines and railroads galore are shoved it
us, each with the assurance that it is the
opportunity of a lifetime to make a for
tune, but we are not on the buy."
Mr. Depew was jesting in all this,
but the fact remains that the enor
mous capital and vigor of New York and
the other Eastern centers of money and
energy remain indifferent both to the op
poitunities for making fortunes in the
West and te the- National advantages
which would accrue from an intelligent
attention to these opportunities. It is
from the West that Uie sustenance of the
country is to be drawn. The inexhausti
ble gold, silver, iron and coal mines, and
the matchless agricultural resourcesjiardly
yet in the beginning of their development,
offer a promise and extend an invitation
that uothing but the most sordid stupidity
of Eastern money centers would think of
ignoring.
In all the broad region east of the Rocky
Mountains there exists no opportunity for
the development of individual prosperity
and the broadening of community charac
ter comparable to that which lies on the
Western slope. With, the exception of
Boston no Eastern city has seat an ap
preciable number of intelligent citizens to
sit at the banquet which nature has spread
in California, and even these have con
fined themselves to a particular corner of
the State. The whole situation makes as
pitiful a picture of neglected opportunity as
it is possible to conceive, and New York is
the head and front of the offending. Cali
fornia should be thankful to Mr. Depew
for confessing with so charming frankness
a sin whicii a Western man would be too
proud to acknowledge.
ENGLAND'S NEW ALLY.
The new treaty of alliance between Eng
land and Italy was the result of England's
fear that King Menelek's vic'.ory over the
Italian army would so encourage the der
vishes as to threaten the whole extent
of European civilization in Northern
Africa. The shrewdness of English diplo
macy in forming this alliance is manifest.
French hostility cannot resist his move
ment, which has the additional indirect
support of the Dreibund. The new alliance
means that international jealousies in
Europe aie to be buried, in the face- of a
common daty to exterminate slave-dealing
in Northern Africa.
Although Simonetti, the Italian Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs, has assured the
Senate at Rome that the alliance has been
formed for "defensive interests," he ad
mitted that if thft Dongola expedition was
aimed at the reconquering of the Soudan,
Italy must look to the restoration of Kas
sala. That means a war of conquest in
Africa. Already General Baldissera has
begun to move to the relief of Adigrat,
where the fugitives of the Italian army are
hopelessly awaiting extermination unless
Europe comes to the rescue.
England, in its advance up the Nile,
will not acain make the mistake that it
committed when it sent "Chinese Gordon"
in 1884 to oppose moral suasion against
the revolt of the Mahdi and his slave
holding followers. The bitter' lesson was
learned in the tragedy of Khartoum that
savage fanaticism was more potent than
civilized intelligence. Gordons own fol
lowers turned against him under the in
fluence of the Mahdi and Osman Digna.
Even Wolseley's expedition for the relief
of Khartoum failed tÂ£ rescue the Soudan
from the slave-traders' grasp, and served
only to fill the Dervisnes with a fierce de
termination to restrict the influence of
Ecypt to the coast.
The British now hold Suakin, which
is 400 miles north of Massowah, the
Italian base of supplies on the Red
Sea, but all the region on the Nile
below Wady Haifa is in the hands of the
Mahdists. The Kassala expedition would
be illogical unless we assume that the des
tination oi the English expedition is
Omdurman, the capital of the Mahdi, just
across the White Nile from Khartoum.
The Anglo- Italian alliance is undoubtedly
intended not only to restore Italy's pres
tige in Abyssinia, but also to recover to
England 'the whole of the Soudan from
Darfour to Abyssinia, and of the Nile Val
ley to Gondokoro. Menelek's victory and
twelve years of English apathy will make
the task difficult, but never before â¢ has
there been so powerful an association
of European interests in a common cause,
and this means the inevitable conquest of
all Africa between the second cataract of
the Nile and the Red and Mediterranean
seas. â  .

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
R. C. Btevenn, gonerai western passenger
agent at Seattle of Jin Hill's famous overland
road, the Great Northern, is one of the con
spicuous figures about the rotunda of the
Occidental. Mr. Stevens has. spent nearly all
his life in Chicago, and only went to Seattle a
couple of years ago. Things ire now and
strange to him. yet, and he 6ays he finds it diffi
cult to adjust himself to the new conditions.
Mr. Stevens takes no stock in the story pub
lished in a mining paper that the western
terminus ol the Great Northern has been
moved from Seattle to New Whatcom, on Bel
lingham Bay.
"Idon'tsee where they get the foundation
for this story," said he. "I have seen aud
heard nothing in regard to such a change. The
Great Northern has acquired terminal grounds
at Seattle, in the south part of the city, and is

[Sketched from life by a "Call' artist.]
going to build a big brick depot. There is to
be no change.
"I think the paper here got the story from
one at Bellingham Bay. It didn't come by
telegraph, and no other papers published it at
all. In regaTd to our road, we still have a
force of men working on the great tunnel in
the Cascade Mountains, and they will continue
to work at it till it is completed. I suppose it
may take two or three years yet. Meantime
the trains are being brought over by a switch
back. It only takes about two hours to cross.
"On April 5 we will inaugurate a new sched
ule for running our trains, so as to shorten the
time between the Pacific Coast and the East.
The running time will be reduced eight hours,
making the trip that much quicker than by
any other overland road. The Great Northern
trains will then make direct connections at
Spokane with the Oregon Kail way and Naviga
tion Company's trains from Portland, and also
at Seattle with the Northern Pacific trains
from Portland.
"We do not vestibule our trains. In place of
the vestibule we carry iron gates. Mr. Hill
has an idea, bo I am informed, that the vesti
bules-gather all the bad air and concentrate it
in the last cars, where the best passengers are.
For this reason he only uses iron or steel gates
to protect the passengers, and lets the air cir
culate in a natural way.
"No Pullman cars aro run. We have our
own dining and sleeping cars. Tne sleepers
are much like the Pullnans, except that the
berths are wider. We carry libraries, baths
and barbers, the same as on the best Eastern
roads out of Chicago."
LADY'S WAIST WITH BOX-PLEATED
BLOUSE FRONT.
The waist shown here has a- fitted lining,
over which the material is laid in box-pleats
in the front, the back being smooth at the top,
with four tiny pleais at the wnist line. The
lining fastens in the center front, the box
pleated front hooking at the shoulder and
under the arm-seam on the left side. The
sleeves are leg-o'mutton shape, and are shown
here with a trimming of lace. The same lace
is laid over the back at the top ip yoke fashion,
and is placed between the pieats in front to
simulate a yoke.
The model Is much used for silk waists, with
lace trimmings as shown here. A green and
black taffeta, with tiny black figure, fis ex
quisite to wear with black skirts, using black
lace for trimming. "
Violet silk trimmed with bUck or ecru lace
is exceedingly pretty, and blues of the bluet
shades are much used in the same way.
Crepon makes up very well after ibis model,
with lace, as illustrated. Or the trimminsr
may consist of a row of buttons on "tooth sides
ot each pleat, from the neck to the bust, using
twelve buttons on the central pleat and four
teen on the side pleats.
This latter mode of trimming makes it ap
propriate also ou woolens of light weight. A
gown of rose and black novelty goods was
trimmed in this way with black battons and
black belt and collar.
Thin wash fabrics make up most daintily
after this pattern, and the latest fancy is for
outlining the pleats with ruffles of yellowish
Valenciennes over lace of the narrowest width.
The collar of ribbon or material should be
adorned with two points of white nainsook
edged with the same lace.
Another pretty mode of trimming is to lay a
piece of ribbon between the pleats, turning the
lower edges up at the bottom to face points.
The ribbon is also laid between the side pleats
and the arm-size, extending over the shoulders
and meeting at the waist line in the back. A
bow of ribbon is laid over the end in front of
tbJc bust. '

NATURE'S HYBRIDIZERS.
What the Bees and Humming-birds Are
Doing in the Way op cheating New
Varieties.
To the Editor of the Sa/i Francisco Callâ Sir:-
While so much praise is pressed upon Luther
Burbank for his patient atod indefatigable suc
cess as a grand hybridizer with both flora and
esculents, a due share of praise should be
awarded to the successful wonders accom
plished by the little humming-birds and bees
in glorifying the flora and adding so greatly
to the value of the fruit and esculents of the
Pacific Coast. Their lifetime's pollinations
have not been in- vain.
In some twenty years' experience in Oregon
and California I have found that one could
procure entirely new seedsâ potatoes, beans
and corn especiallyâ from the "States," and in
less time than four years the wild and do
mestic bees had hybridized and created new
varieties by aid of their subtle means of
pollination. Ana the same effects with
native and exotic flora and herbal plants.
Judging from the present effects of the hum
ming-birds and bees hybridizing the eucalypti
in Southern California, I have not the slightest
doubt but. that in less than ten years' time
many varieties of the numerous family of
eucalyptus will have to be renamed. The
little workers can accomplish in months a per
fection of hybridizing that man can only suc
ceed in by yeors of patience and perseverance.

Right of Wayâ J. X., City. The law of this
State as to teamsters taking the right of a road
says:
When vehicles meet the driver of each must
seasonably turn to cue rUiit of. the center of the
highway so as to pass without interference, under
fi. penalty of $25 for every neglect, to be recovered
by the party injured. Where the whole breadth of
a highway is not worKed, the center of the worked
part is to be oeemed the center of the highway. In
time of snov,-, where there is a beaten track, the
center of that is to be considered the center of the
highway, but this section does not apply to ve
hicles meeting cars running on rails or grooved'
tracks. ___^
Minnehaha Falls â Subscriber, Clement,
Cal. The Minnehaha Kiver and falls
are in Hennepin County in Minnesota.
The Dakota Indians named the stream Minne
haha, which means "laughing waters." Half
a mile above its mouth, where the channel
passes over a limestone precipice sixty feet
nigh, the waters make falls of remarkable
beauty. These falls are among the most inter
esting of many picturesque surroundings of
Minneapolis and attract many visitors. The
city named provided a site of fifty-one acres at
the falls and there a soldiers' home was located
and opened in 1887.
Washington's Bikthdayâ C. J., Sacramento,
Cal. The earliest celebration of the anniver
sary of the birth of George Washington oc
curred in Richmond, Va., February 11, 1782,
that is the earliest of which a record can be
found. The Virginia Gazette four days after
the event, which was February 15, old style,
had the following: "Tuesday last, the birth
day ot- his. excellency George Washington, our
illustrious commander-in-chief, the same Â«vas
commemorated here with demonstrations
of joy." There were celebrations in honor of
the anniversary of the birth of Washington on
the 11th of February, old style, until 1793,
when the day was changed to the 22d of Feb
ruary to adopt it to the new style. During the
first term of Washington's "Presidency hi&
birthday began to be observed by visit* of con
gratulations, and as he received them he must
nave recognized the 11th of February as his
birthday* His first term commenced in 1789.
Hawaiian Landsâ J. A. R., San Lorenzo, Cal.
There are homestead lands in the Hawaiian
Islands that are either leased or sold by the
Government. An applicant for land must be
either a citizen by birth or by naturalization,
or one who has received letters of denization,
or ahy person who has received special rights
of citizenship. The applicant must be over 18
years of age, must not be under civil disability
for any offense, must not be delinquent in the
payment of taxes, must not have made any
false declaration in applying .for land under
the act, must not at the time be the owner in
his .own right of any lands ;n the islands
known. as "wet land," and must not be an ap
plicant for any other interest in land under
the act. Fulfilling these conditions he can ap
ply for one lot tor his own use and benefit.
The occupier of the land must. comply during
a period of six continuous years with certain
conditions, and at the end of that time, if they
are oompjied with, he is. given a lease for 999
years. The land act embraces eighty-seven
sections, and it can be consulted at' the office of
the Hawaiian Consul in this City.
A Freckled Faceâ J. a. R., San Lorenzo,
Cal., and A. R. J., City. There are several
varieties of what is commonly called freckles.
First, there is lentigo, small yellowish or
brownish-yellow irregularly rounded $pots
most abundant on the parts chiefly exposed to
the light, as the face and hands. In some
cases these spots are congenital;- in other cases
they seem produced by exposure to the sun's
rays, and in both cases they occur to persons
chiefly of light complexion. When the patches
are of a larger size than the ordinary freckle
tney are known as epbelis. Congenital soots ,
cannot be removed by any applications; but

A STATUE OF MERCURY.
The first piece of stone statuary ever used as
a building ornamentin this City still occupies
the same position in- which it was originally
placed. It is oh the top of the late Dr. Zeile s
building, on Pacific street, and has been but
slightly affected by the action ef the winds,
rains and sun of twenty-eight years.
The carving is a copy of the original Greek
statue of Mercury and is a creditable piece of
work. It was made for exhibition at the first
American exposition held in New York in
1858 and received an "honorable mention.
For soma reason it was impossible to dispose or
it in the East, although it was exhibited at
many different places. In 1867 it arrived in
San Fraiiclsco, after a long passage around tne
Horn, together with a lot of other carvinÃ.
They were in boxes made of three-inch planka
and strongly bound with iron. No one here
had ever seen anything of the kind, and it was
several days before Mr. Newhall, the con
signee, could find any person to undertake the
job of opening them.
When the carvings were first placed on view"
people could scarcely get uear the place, so
dense was the crowd clamoring for a sight.
Statue of Mercury. Said to be the First
Piece of Stone Sculpture Used as a
Building Ornament in San Francisco.
[From a sketch.]
Dr. Zeile was so much pleased with them that
he bought the whole lot at a price below
half of what was originally asked. The statue
ofMercury was carved of gray sandstone, and
the four others were of marble.
Dr. Zeile's building was then almost
finished, and he found the carvings just what
he wanted. A magnificent marble mantel was
in the collection, and he placed that in the
parlor, where it still is, and in almost perfect
condition. It is in the gothic style, and so
delicate is some of the work that it has the ap
pearance of lace. It is safe to say that there is
not such another piece of work on the Pacific
Coast, and very few like it in the United States.
It cost the doctor $ 5000.
The other marbles were placed in different
parts of the building, where they remained for
many years, but are now stored in a back
room. They consist of a statue of Minerva, a
head of "The Infant Caesar" and a head of
Aristotle. They are all excellent copies from
the originals. The statue of Mercury is ol the
least value on account of the material used,
but the whole collection could not bo dupli
cated to-day for less than $10,000.

ANOTHER WRECK
IN MID-OCEAN
The Schooner Helen Mer
riam Deserted by Her
Crew.
DISMASTED AND SINKING
She Was Run Down by the
Christina Steffens Off
Timber Cove.
WAS A VERY NARROW ESCAPE.
Captain Gruggel Says the Steffens
Had No Lights Out and Was
to Blame.
Another disaster must be added to the
already long litt that crowds the opening
The Crew of the Wreckei Schooner Helen Merriam Escaping to the Christina Steffens After the Collision Off Timber Cove Last Sunday.
[Drawn by a l ' Call " artist from a description furnished by Captain Gruggel of the Mtrriam.]
months of 1896. Half a dozen vessels are '
missing, collisions have been numerous
and fatalities frequent. Sealing schooners
have gone on the rocks, mail steamers
have Kroken down and others have run
short of coal, while deep-water ships have
on two occasions been compelled to race
for the nearest friendly port with their
cargoes on fire.
News of the latest disaster reached San
Francisco yesterday morning on the
schooner Bender Brothers. The Christina
Steffens and the Helen Merriam were in
collision off Timber Cove, and as a result
the latter is now at the bottom of the
ocean or floating around, a derelict. Cap
tain Fred W. Gruggel and the crew were
taken off by the other schooner, but they
had a narrow escape. Tne Steffens struck
the Merriam near the fore rigging on the
port side and the foremast went by the
board. In its fall the stays brought the
aftermast down also, and then the bow
sprit of the Steffens raked her fore and aft.
The Merriam was bound for Puget Sound
and had a quantity of hay aboard. A
strong southeast gale was blowing and the
schooner was bowling along with her sails
wing and wing and making steamboat
time. F^arly on Sunday morning she was
off Timber Cove, and it was there her
voyage ended.
The Christina Steffens was bound for
Timber Cove, but owing to the heavy
weather .she could not make port. The
schooner was closehauled and was stand
ing on and off awaiting the abatement of
the gale. A heavy fog hung over the
ocean and the lookout could not see 100
yards ahead. Without a moment's warn
ing the Steffens crashed into the Merriam,
and the crew of the latter made a rush
for the boat, as i.he crash of falling timbers
and the roar of rushing waters gave the
impression that the vessel had been al
most cut in two. Everybody escaped, but
the men lost most of their belongings.
The next morning there was no sign of
the Merriam, and Captain Gruggel came
to the conclusion that she had gone down.
The Steffens accordingly headed for Tim
ber Cove, but on the way the Bender
Brothers was met coming out and Captain
Gruggel and two of his men were trans
ferred to her and came to San Francisco.
"The collision took place about 4 a. m.
last Sunday," said Captain Gruggel yes
terday. "We were bound for Nehalern
| Bay, and as it was blowing almost a gale
from the southeast we were rushing along
at a great rate. The Steffens had no lights,
but ours were burning brightly, and Cap
tain Johnson acknowledges having seen
them before he ran into us. I had been on
watch all night and had only gone below
a short time when the collision occurred.
The Steffens struck the Merriam forward
of the fore rigging on the port side and
carried away both masts. Our bulwarks
were all smashed up, and the Christina
Steffens lost her martingale, some of her
neadgear and had her jib torn. We aban
doned the vessel, and at daybreak she was
gone. Some of my crew went into Timber
Cove on the Steffens, but 1 came to San
Francisco on the Bender Brothers."
The only insurance on the Helen Mer
riam was $1000, which was placed on her to
secure an advance rr;Â« le to Captain
Gruggel by his agent. Unless the Steffens is
proved to be in the wrong, the master
will, therefore, be a heavy loser. Captain
Gruggel was former ly master of the S.
Danielson, but about eighteen months ago
he gave her up and purchased the Helen
Merriam.
TJie Christina Steffens is a little over 70

tons gross burden, 75 feet long, 24 feet 3
inches broad and 6 feet deep. She was
built in Huruboldt Bay in 1876.
The Helen Merriam was or is about 74
tons gross burden, 80 feet 5 inches long, 26
feet broad and 5 feet 6 inches deep. She
was built in San Francisco. This collision
probably explains the telegram from
Collins Landing, which stated that a dis
masted vessel in tow of a two-masted
schooner had passed south last Monday.
The supposition is that the dismasted
vessel was the Merriam, so Captain Gruggel
may see his vessel again.
THAT COLTON OVERDRAFT.
The Case Has Developed Legal Points
Which Are Under Argument.
The fight for commissions for the sale of
the Colton house has dwindled down to a
point of law. This point is as to how far
Murphy's connection with the case in
volves the bank, or if he acted solely in
bis individual capacity.
The bank contends that it has nothing
to do with the sale of the house and it
wants the amount of the overdraft, as it
styles the deficiency. Mrs. Colton claims
that the bank has unlawfully allowed its
"broking" president to deduct from her
account the amount of the commission
which he thought he ought to have. The
question then arises whether or not Mur
phy took the $8000 before the money was
placed in the bank or afterward. The jury
in the case has been excused until these
questions have been settled.
The Fire Record.
An alarm was sounded from box 152 at 9:45
o'clock last night for a fire in a two-story frame
building at 492 Eighth street. It was occu
pied by \V. W. Wickerer; loss $25. A blaze in
Dr. Devlin's office at 405 Powell street at 10
o'clock last night did $20 damages.
DURRANT' S EXCEPTIONS.
The Last Stay of Fifteen Days
Granted Him Expires To-
Morrow.
The District Attorney and Judge Mur
phy Wrestling Over the Issues
Involved.
The last stay of fifteen days which was
granted to stop the execution of the court's
sentence in the case of Theodore Durrant
will expire to-morrow.
What further action may be taken by
the trial Judge will be determined by
Judge Murphy, who has been working on
the bill of exceptions presented to him by
General J. H. Dickinson and Eugene
Deuprey, Durrant's attorneys, and which
exceptions the District Attorney has
comDatted.
These differences of legal opinion between
the contending parties over the issues
involved during the trial have to be ad
justed by the Judge who presided over the
trial. In order to give proper considera
tion, to the objections of the defendant's
lawyers, and where these objections
are confpsted by the District Attorney,
Judge Murphy has adjourned his court
during the past week the better to enable
him to devote his entire time to a careful
perusal of the voluminous compilation of
matter involved in the findings.
After the bill of exceptions is finally ad
justed and signed by the Judge, the case
in its entirety will be forwarded to the
clerk of the Supreme Court, and once the
papers are there the Judge of the lower
court loses all further jurisdiction over the
person of Durrant. A further stay of pro
ceedings, with the privilege of permitting
the defendant to remain in the County
Jail, rests with the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court.
In the meantime it is probable that
Judge Murphy will to-morrow grant a fur
ther extension to Durrant to remain at the
Broadway hotel.
"This long delay over the bill of excep
tions is not our fault," said General Dick
inson, when speaking over the lone delay.
"We had our side ready and submitted it
to Judge Murphy seventy days ago.
"The d3lay with the findings ha* been
in the District Attorney's office and not
with our side."
"We are ready to go to the Supreme
Court at eny time and have no fear of the
result," said Eugene Duprey. "After the
District Attorney and Judge Murphy have
agreed on our bill of exceptions the papers
will be forwarded to the court of appeal
and until that time I have every reason to
believe that Durrant will not be disturbed
from where he is."
It was expected that the District Attor
ney would have his proposed amendments
rea-ly on the 13th inst. Failing in his ex
pectations Judge Murphy gave him fifteen
days' extension, which will expire to
morrow. _
Simple Assault Only.
Jasper Madison, the jockey, was on trial be
fore Judge Wallace yesterday on the charge of
assault to commit murder. Early in January,
durine an altercation in the Richmond saloon,
Bay District track, Madison stabbed Hugh
Murphy, the bartender, in the neck. The jury
last night returned a verdict of simple assault
against Madison.

A LONG THE WATER FRONT
President Colnon of the Harbor
S Commission Back From a
Vacation.
ANOTHER SHED CONTRACT LET.
Great Indignation Expressed Over the
Way Seized Sealers Are Being
Treated.
There was a full board present at the
usual meeting of the Harbor Commission
ers yesterday. President Colnon was back
from his holiday jaunt to Los Angeles, and
looked much better for his holiday. He
visited the Catalina Islands and was so
taken with the place that he has resolved
to visit it again next July. "A more beau
tiful place I never saw," said he yesterday.
"Not only is it picturesque, but new won
ders are sprung on you at almost every
turn. And the boom of the surge was
with us all the time. Yes, I'm going bacu
to the Catalinas again in the summer, and
will probably remain a couple of weeks."
The Chamber of Commerce wrote, ask
ing the board to extend tne belt railroad
from the foot of Broadway to the Southern
Pacific Railroad's depot at Fourth and
Townsend streets. A committee from the
chamber will be heard by the Commis
sioners next Tuesday, but the chances are
that nothing will be done, as the board
will not do any work in the direction of
extending the road until the seawall is
built.
McDermon & Co., the asbestos boiler
covering people, wrote objecting to giving
up their premises at the foot of Broadway
to the Southern Pacitic. They said the
firm had spent money in improving the
property and that some consideration
should be shown. The matter was laid on
the table.
George Schneider & Co. sent in a petition
with 112 signatures of residents of Alameda
attached, asking that the newsstand at the
ferry landing be allowed to remain. Joseph
A. Hofman asked for a similar privilege,
but nothing was done, President Oolnon
remarking that it was time the commission
went out of the "peddling business."
The stringers along the bulkheads be
tween the various piers are to be removed.
President Colnon said they were a nuisance
and dangerous to foot passengers. They
will be replaced by posts similar to those
at the fenies.
The \V T estern Union Telegraph Com
pany is about to remove its office from the
terry buiiding to the west side of East
street. It, therefore, asked for permission
to tear up the street in order to lay its
wires and also to drive a three-inch pipe
through the ferry foundation in order to
carry its telephone wires out to the
dolphin. The matter was referred to the
Chief Engineer.
A new shed is to be built on pier 8
and the contract was let to Gallowey,
Townley & Co., whose bid was $2654. The
next lowest bid was Healy. Tibbits & Co.,
$2693, and the highest was F. A. Williams,
$3423. Bateraan Bros.' bid was rejected as
it was not accompanied by a certified
check. ,
Captain John Burns of the Tropic Bird
will not go out in the barkentine next
trip. He is going to take a well-earned
rest ashore, and his place will be taken by
Captain C. W. Jackson of the American
ship Louisiana. First Officer Aggers of
the same ship will also take the place of
Chief Officer Murray of the '1 ropic Bird.
Sealing men in general are very much
exasperated over the manner in which the
Government has handled the schooners
Bowhead and Winchester. The way it
looks now it apnears to be a case of petty
persecution, and as if Uncle Sam was try
ing to ruin the owners of the vessels by
false kindness. When the vessels were
first seized they were appraised at $5000 by
the Government. Now that they have
been released the owners find that there is
over $4500 in charges against the vessels,
of wliich $1650 is United States Marshal
fees. Collector Wise has received instruc
tions to release the schooners, but District
Attorney Foote has not, so the matter is
in abeyance. The owners are considering
the situation, however, and they may
elect to allow Uncle Sam to keep the ves
sels until Senator Perkins and the Califor
nia delegation can lay the matter before
Congress.
The big tug Fearless is to have a new
14-inch wrecking-pump, and when it is in
position she will be one of the most pow

tain Dan Haskell tested the pump on the

tire satisfaction of everybody connected
with the towboat company.
The little Alaska steamer Jeanie has
been lengthened thirty feet and thor
oughly overhauled. Her engines have

day she made two knots more than before
she was remodeled.
The barkentine S. N. Castle, which ar
rived from Honolulu yesterday, reports
that on the night of March 25 she was in
company with a British bark. Her name
could not be made out.
Threatened H-iH Life.
Lucien Kochier, Jackson street and Trenton
place, swore out â warrants yesterday for the
arrest of Camille Laiioue oil the charges of as
sault with a deadly weapon and threats to
kill. He alleged that Lanoue on Saturday
last attacked him with a knife and since then
had threatened to kill him. Lanoue was ar
rested and released on bonds.
DR. BROWN'S CHURCH.
A Sfysterioua Light in the Basement
Causes the Police to Sur
round It.
A light in the basement of the First Con
gregational Church at an early hour yes
terday morning created surprise in the
Police Department.
The policeman on the beat called the
attention of Sergeant Shea to the light and
the sergeant got the men in the immediate
neighborhood together and they sur
rounded the church. Every door was
found to be locked, and the sergeant tele
phoned to the Central police station to
get the officer on duty at the Seventeenth
street fetation to find Janitor Pyke, who
lives at 753 Valencia street, and drive him
to the church in the patrol wagon.
The janitor was wakened out of his sleep,
but he positively refused to take a free
ride in the patrol" wagon and went back to
his bed. The sergeant on beine notified of
the janitor's refusal drew off his men, but
left a man to watch for developments.
The light was still burning when the man
reported off duty, and was no doubt ex
tinguished by the janitor later on. Why
it was left burning all night is a mystery.

FOR THE ALVISO ROAD
One Thousand Tons of Rails
Arrived on the American
Ship Aryan.
Material to Be Transhipped Into
Lighters and Taken to the
Terminus.
The American ship Aryan arrived from
New York yesterday with 1000 tons of rails
for the Santa Clara Valley Railway aboard.
She came' in under full sail and did not
need the assistance of a tug to reach an
anchorage in Mission Bay. The steel rails
will be loaded into lighters and taken to
Alviso, where they will remain pending
the determination of the condemnation
suits now in progress in San Jose.
It is the intention of the railroad com-,
pany to build from Alviso right : through
Santa Clara Valley and give the farmers
and residents a competing road. From
Alviso all the passengers would be brought
to San Francisco in fast steamers, while
the freight would come on a specially con
structed boat.
The promoters . were blocked almost at
the outset, however. ' Property-owners
would not give the necessary land, and
condemnation suits had to be commenced
in the San Jose courts. Ex-Railroad Com
missioner James Rea is one of the defend
ants, and his case is 'now on trial./ Rea
owns C 6% acres of land at Alviso. 'The
I railroad people want i / acres of this
{ property, and experts put :on the i stand
yesterday testified â¢ that the property was
worth all the way from $150,000 to $750,000.
When asked to put. a price on the three
acres Rea refused, hence the suit.
The matter has caused considerable talk,
but the. promoters of the new competing
road assert that it will be built, no matter
what comes or goes. â¢ Mr. Rea is skeptical
on this point and, says the Santa Clara
Railway Company 'does not mean busi
ness. -The latter, however, has its rails in
I port, \ a steamer ; contracted for and its
engines on the way, and the company con
siders that a sufficient answer. v
Should the company fail to .secure a
right of way the steel rails will be sold to
the highest bidder, the steamer will be put
on another route and the engines used on
another road. The chances are that the
road will be built, however, and then the
Southern Pacific will have another com*
patitor in the field. :â¢ .
The questions asked the .jurors were
peculiar. attorney for the. defense
asked, "If it. is shown that the Southern
Pacific is behind the scheme to block the
building of the road would that have any
influence on your verdict?" While ' the
! attorney for the- plaintiff asked, "If it is
proven "that the Southern : Pacific is in
favor of - ; this road : would that : influence
your verdict?" Also, "Have you any rela
tives in the employ; of the Southern Pa
cific?" and, " "Are you â¢ acquainted with
anybody in the management of the South
ern Pacific?" The tight promises to be a
lively one, but in the mean time \ the steel
rails on the Aryan will be discharged and
taken to Alviso in lighters. .

IMPROVED FERRY SERVICE
More Frequent Boats to Be Put
On When the New Depot
Is Ready.
ONE EVERY TWENTY MINUTES.
The Southern Pacific Will Not Run
Its Principal Trains Into Town
send Street.
Within a comparatively short time the
people of San Francisco and those residing
across the bay will be able to make the
trip to and fro on the broadgange ferry at
intervals of twenty minutes instead of
thirty, as at present, as it is the avowed
purpose of the Southern Pacific, vrnen the
new ferry depot is completed, to put on
boats and connecting trains to run every
twenty minutes on the broadgauge lines.
It was current report that the Southern
Pacific Company would not require as
much room in the new depot as it is now
utilizing at the foot of Market street. It
was stated that by that time its coast line
would be completed from Los Angeles via
Sania Barbara and San Luis Obispo, and
that ihe principal trains would De brought
in at the Third and Townsend street depot.
Manager J. A. Fillmore. when asked as
to the truth of this report, said :
"Why, that is the veriest nonsense. By
the time this new depot will be ready, the
increase in traffic on the suburban trains
will be such that to my mind it will be
necessary for us to put in a service that
will give a boat every twenty minutes on
the broadgauge line, and this may even
become necessary before that depot is
ready.
"\Vhen these twenty-minute ferry boats
are put on, they will at first run during the
early hours of the morning and the
evening hours, w'jen the traffic is heavi3st.
"With the completion of the coast line,
only one train will be taken away from
the'main line that now enters Oakland,
and tiiat will be the overland train on the
Sunset line. This will be run in at Town
send street, but it will not decrease the
number of trains now entering Oakland,
because we will have to put oh a local from
Los Angeles to San Francisco to take the
place of the threffeeh train. In fact, we
expect to see our trains increased by ten or
a dozen by the time this depot is com
pleted."
Among other rumors in this connection
was one to the effect that the Oakland re
uair shops were to be removed to Mission
Bay, where the company contemplated
building new ducks. This, too, was em
phatically denied by Manager Fillmore,
who said :
"I can't conceive how any one can im
agine such a thing as that the Oakland
shops are to be removed. They will all re
main where they are, and will be needed
in order to keep the locomotives and steam
ers that run into Oakland in repair. Tney
only change to be made in the location of
shops will be in connection with those
now at Sixteenth street. When the coast
roule is completed these shops will be
transferred so as to be alongside of the
main line."
Considerable work in the shape of im
provements in the roadbed of the Southern
Pacific are being made at the present
time.
In San Gorgonio Pass ten miles of road
is being replaced with the new pat'ern 75
--pound steel rails, supported on redwood
ties, with steel tie plates between the tie
and rail. This particular ten miles is also
being ballasted with gravel from the
Whitewater River. Five miles of this bal
lasting has already been completed.
A piece of heavy ballasting has also just
been completed between Hakersiield and
Pampa, a distance of thirteen miles, and
in connection with that ballasting the
company has also applied the new tie
plates.
These plates prevent the rail sinking
into the tie, and thus not only preserve the
latter, but aid to maintain the smoothness
of the road.
They Returned the Booty.
Representative White of Illinois has
had two very remarkable experiences in
his life, and both similar in character. In
1880, while leading the anti-Grant faction
at Springfield, 111., sneak thieves entered
his sleeping room at the Leland Hotel and
stole a valuable diamond stud out of his
shirt front. In the course of time it was
returned to him by the thieves with an
apology to the effect that they did not
know the stone was his. Just a year ago
this month his residence in Cnicago was
burglarized, and among the things taken
were his watch and chain and bis valuable
seal rin<:, once the personal jewel of Pius
Antonius, Emperor of Rome. Mr. White
was greatly disconcerted by the loss of his
ring and inserted a card in the paper offer
ing a reward for the stolen goods, no ques
tions asked. As in the first case, a part of
the booty was returned to him through
anonymous channels. This was the ring,
which he valued far more than his other
losses. The rest was promised, but has
never, so far, been forthcoming. â Wash

"HENRY MAYER"
AGAIN IN PRINT.
Alleged Author of the Val
entine Letters Defends
Brown.
REPEATS OLD CHARGES.
â¢
City Editor of the "Bulletin"
Declares That the Pastor Is
the Penman.
MRS. DAVIDSON WILL LECTURE.
The Convicted Minister Reminds Her
of a Human Rodentâ Brown's
Enemies Confident.
The man signing: himself "Henry May
er," but who is said by the Bulletin to be
no less a person than Rev. Dr. Charles O.
Brown, has written 'another letter, Dr.
Bader being the recipient.
This latest effusion is a voluminous docu
ment full of quotations, everything point
ing to a desperate attempt on the part of
the writer to pose as a ''newspaper man."
In part it reads as follows:
Sindaa, March 22.
I see by Tevis' official organs, the Chronicle
ami Bullelin, that Older, Simpson, Mrs. Cooper
ec al. "don't (not doesn't, as Older thinks re
porters write) know when it is time to let go.
The criminal libel written by a man named
Brooks at Older's order and published in Fri
day's Bulletin almost gave the proprietor of
that unreliable sheet a convulsion, so the next
day the whole subject was treated in a very con
s. native way. Even the truly Rood Mrs. Cooper
was mentioned but once by name, but her pet
story about a red-headed baby, which was
first given out by her in the Bulletin office
some weeks airo, was made to do duty in an
inferential way. Tne Chronicle next morning
was tame as compared with previous days.
Simpson contented himself witn giving merely
a synopsis of the Bulletin libel of the preced
ing evening. In each paper Older and Simp
son give each other good characters and in
dulge in bouquet throwing. - This brace of
jackals have been demoralized during the
past two days, mid been busy repairing their
damaged lines and trying to square certain
people by promise* to pay for -silence. Any
thing to down Brown or split the church is
now their yelp, and Mrs. Cooper is doing the
same in the church that they are doing out
side. As this will do for imitation of Brown's
handwriting, 1 will write the balance in my
own hand. * * *
The statement that there is no such man in
the city is a barefaced lie. Let me call this
man Older's attention to the long years we
have known each other, to the units we
worked together in The Call local-room under
City Editors Frank Ballinger and Dewey. how
we had desks together with old man McGrew
in the corner, to the time I left the newspaper
business on Sew Year's eve seven years ago,
and finally to the day less than a year ago
when 1 was given a package of this copy paper
in the editorial-rooms or the Bulletin.
The nice yarn about The Call reporter giv
ing this copy-paper won't wash. I send you
about one-half the quantity given me by
Older in the original wrapper, a copy of the
Bulletin of about the date I received the
paper. * â¢ *
Finally, unless the coin is produced for my
â work on the letters heretofore referred to be
lore next Friday night I will forward to the
Examiner for publication the two notes
written by Brown to Mr- . Cooper thai were my
models for handwriting together with eight
note* from the Bulletin office and three from
the Chronicle office. We will see how this suits
Older, Simpson, Cooper et al. The proof will
also be given relative to Simpson threatening
an Oakland police officer with: "I am the city
editor of tne Chronicle, and I will burn you up
and have you broke." Also bow two other
men across the bay were threatened with the
wrath of the Chronicle.
I'eople who dance must pay the piper or
Btaml the consequences. Henry Hayek.
Commenting on this letter Mr. Older of
the Bulletin says: :, :v
It would be viewing the foregoing document !
too seriously to make denial of the many lying '.
statements it contains. However, it might be'
well to inform Brown that his tool had given j
him some defective information. i"or instance,
Mr. Older did not work on The Call until
alter 2ir. Ballinger and Will Dewey were dead.
It is true that Mr. Mc&ewdid have a desk in
one corner of the local-room, and that point is |
the only one in the entira letter that is not ab- I
sol'.iteiy and unqualiSedly lalse.
The ropy-paper that has been used by the
Bulletin for years is white. That used by
Brown in writing the letter is manilla, of which
there has never been one sheet in this office.
In closing the letter the threat is made that
unless money is paid for writing the Valentine
letter the writer will reveal to the Examiner
two notes written by Brown to Mrs. Cooper, to
gether with eight notes from the Bulletin office
and three from the Chronicle. Of course there
are no such letters in existence. If Brown
wants pay for having written the Valentine
letter to the Bulletin why doesn't he send in
his bill openly and candidly and not resort to
such ridiculous subterfuges and malicious lies
as he has lately indulged in?
The contents of this latest letter show
clearly that this desperate and unscrupulous
man Brown has spent much of his spare time
in searching for inside information concerning
newspaper men and the interior workings of
newspaper offices. That he may have hired
some disreputable creature who has at some
time or another been a reporter on one of the i
newspapers here to furnish him with joints is j
easy of belief. It is undoubtedly some man j
whom drink has assailed, and who has been
dragged down by years of dissipation to a level
where he would for a small sum of money be
come a tool of the pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church.
Within Jive minutes after Mr. Rader had
left the editorial rooms of the Bulletin there
walked into the private room of the proprietor
of the paper a man who bore every appearance
of being a "thug." His menacing manner as
he passed through the local rooms frightened
the lady writers at work there, and they were
almost impelled to sound an alarm. He
passed into the room where the proprietor
was, however, and with a murderous look in
his eyes started swiftly toward him. But he
quickly discovered that the managing editor
was also in the room and had his eye on him.
This caused him to halt suddenly, and after
glaring at the proprietor for a few -seconds
. said his journey had been for nothing, and,
turning on his heel, left the room.
Mrs. Davidson was a bit more commun
icative yesterday than at any time since her
acquittal, though it was plainly evident
that she still struggled under the restrain
ing influence of Attorney. Knight.
"I am not just yet prepared to talk about
the case in ail its details," she said, "but
no harm can come from indulging in a few
side remarks. Concerning the sudden
falling down, so to speak, of Dr. Brown in
his prosecution of myself, I have only to
say that the end is not yet and I mean by
this that his troubles have only, just
beeun. ...
"This man reminds me very much of a
rodent â in fact he is nothing less than a
human rodent, getting in his deadly work
here and there and then barely escaping
with his life.
"I wish to be understood right here as
saying that I never followed the path of
one of these creatures without immedi
ately catching him before he could reach
a place of safety.
"I presume, now that the case is ended,
his partner in crime, Mattie Overman, and
the Tatter's adviser,* Mrs. Tunnel!, may - b3
expected in San Francisco any day. There
is certainly nothing to keep them away,
and further than this, Matiie Overman is
not the woman to go wandering'in a des
ert, when she can lounge in a palace.
"The defeat of Dr. Brown in the courts,
though I want to be understood as saying
that I never expected anything else, seems
to me to sound his death .knell. The
beautiful decorations of last Sunday re
mind me of a funeral without the . corpse
âthe latter only arrived Wednesday, . but
will no doubt be exhibited next Lord day
with great ceremony."
Mrs. Davidson has received a dozen or
more offtrs from "managers" who desire
to play her as a star attraction on the
lecture platform,, One enterprising fellow
declares she would draw "immensely" as
far east as Chicago, and if she will but
consent to "tour" it under his guidance he
will bedeck her in fine linen and silks.
Incidentally Mrs. Davidson was offered 25
per cent of the net profits.
Mrs. Davidson has already determined
to give one or more lectures at Metropoli
tan Temple, but the date has not been
selected. * Should this venture prove suc
cessful she will probably tour the Pacific
Coast States, the subject of the lecture
being "The moral side of Dr. Brows and
Martha Overman."
The opposition to Dr. Brown in the
First church seems to be much elated
over the acquittal of Mrs. Davidsonâ more
particularly the manner in which it was
brought about. Twenty petitions are
being industriously circulated, and when
the 200 mark is reached the trustees will
be asked to L-ecure another pastor.
If this protest should be put calmly
aside it is the purpose of the opposition to
call a council to pass on the case of Dr.
Brown. This means that the First church
must either let the present pastor go or
else become a tramp institution.
BANKS OF THE INTERIOR.
Two Examiners Visiting Financial In

Messrs. Fuller and Magee of the Board
of Bank Comnisisioners are now at work
in the San Joaquin Valley inspecting the
interior banking-houses. Yesterday a re
port on trie condition of the Fresno banks
reached the headquarters of tne commis

Commissioners gave a very encouraging
account of the financial status of the
raisin city and its suburbs. To-day they
are at work in Merced, whither they pro

CHINA TEAS GIVING WAY
Thomas Fairhurst on How They
Have Been Supplanted .
by Ceylon.
The Work of Missionaries in and I
About Foochow Almost With
out Results.
Thomas Fairhurst of Foochow, who has >
been raising and handling tea for twenty
live years, is at the Palace, on his way
home from London. Mr. Fairhurst says j
the Ceylon teas are now fast taking the i
place of the China teas in different parts j
of the world. The tea business in Ceylon j
is in the hands of Europeans, who had |
become expert in blending and in all the
details of * growing and marketing the
product. On the other, hand the Chinese
control the tea business in China. They
are not skilled in handling them and are
consequently losing hold in the markets
of the world. San Franciscans as yet
drink a good deal of Chinese tea, but in
the East, and especially in Canada, where
little coffee has ever been drunk, the
Ceylon tea is bought to a greater extent
than any other. .'.;â 
Mr. Fairhurst does not think much of
the Chinese railroad scheme recently ex
ploited here. He says the Chinese will
not under any consideration let foreigners
come in and run any railroad, and that
they will be extremely slow about making
any real grants looking to the building of
railroads by outsiders.
"The trouble is," he said, "that those in
authority in China do not want railroads
and the inventions of Western civilization.
The people would like to have them well
enough, but the officeholders are shrewd
enough to see that if they were introduced
they would lose their positions. And they
want to hold on to their fat places as long
as possible.
"Thi3 railroad project looks to me like a
mere scheme. Why, to build from Peking
via Hankow to Canton would require 1500
miles of road. It wouldn't touch enough
of the big ports, and, besides, a very large
part of it would be over a very rough,
mountainous region that would^ make it a
very costly enterprise. â¢
â¢'Talking about railroads in China, some
years ago an English company was al
lowed to build one eleven miles long from
Shanghai to the mouth of the Woo Sung
River. After they had it completed and
had run it awhile they offered to give it
outright to the Chinese Government.
The Government refused to take it in that
way, but the officials said they would take
it at cost. They did so, and paid the
money, and then they sent a lot : of men
who tore up the track and carried it and
the rolling stock away off to Formosa,
where they threw it down and left it as so
much rubbish. The Chinese people pat
ronized the road well, and it paid, but the
officials didn't want it. I
"It â¢ was ninety miles from Foochow
that those outrages occurred to the mis
sionaries. Ten persons in all were killed.
Of those who did it twenty-five were cap
tured and beheaded, five being brought
down to Foochow for that purpose. The
Chinese are still bitter against the mission
aries, and. for my part, I don't see what
good the missionaries do. One of them
admitted to me not long ago that their
work was of no avail. The missionaries
go there at about the same pay as they
could get at home, and when the warm
weather comes they,- go j and ' spend \ three
months at the seashore â all except - the
Catholics, who do not take this vacation.
The Chinese are a class of people who do
not regard truth, and who are almost im
possible to reach."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1896.
A BEAUTIFUL IONIC PILE
Magnificent Plans for the State
University's Main Build
ing.
PRESENTED BY J. W. DUNCAN.
An Auditorium That Would Seat
Five Thousandâ To Be Built
of Folsom Granite.
The plan to give the University of Cali
fornia a magnificent, permanent main hall
is as old, almost, as the university itseif,
but not until very recently has the plan
assumed definite shape and form. At the
last Legislature an appropriation of
$500,000 was asked for with a view of ex
pending most of the sum in the com
mencement of the great structure. But
the appropriation was not allowed and
for the time being the plan of the main
hall was abandoned.
But now another and far more definite
plan is produced, the architectural draw
ings of which are complete. These plans
are fathered by James W. Duncan of 726
Bush street, this City. They have been
examined and praised by several of the
regents, and Mr. Duncan hopes to have
them finally adopted and the work upon
them actually commenced within the next
year or two.
Mr. Duncan was the superintendent of
construction in 1870 of the present uni
versity buildings. He was also superin
tendent of construction of the new Mer
cantile Library building and of the Acad
emy of Sciences building. Mr. Duncan is
a man of wide experience in his line and
of much taste withal, as a glanoe at the |
drawings for the new main hall will evi
dence. While Mr. Duncan is not a practi
cal draughtsman, yet the plans were
drawn under his personal supervision and
according to an idea which he has long
cherished for the main building at Berke
ley.
It is plafined on strictly classic lines, j
being severely lonic throughout, and has
that splendid massive beauty and dignity
'' peculiar to all purely classical structures.
The total width of the building, from
and including both wings, is 420 feet. In
the center of this, extending back a depth
! of 205 feet, with a width of 180 feet, is the j
| auditorium, which, with its galleries on |
j three sides, is capable of seating 5000 per- j
| sons. The auditorium has a rear entrance
j and its stage and proscenium front is in
! the front of the buifding, backing the
main vestibule. Each wing has an area of
152x70 feet. It is calculated by Mr. Dun
can that these would be suitable for the
museum and library, the engineering and
photographing departments, the executive
i quarters, etc.
As planned, the great building is en
tirely fireproof. Mr. Duncan, who was su
{ perintendent of the Folsom prison works,
j is anxious to have the university building
made entirely ol Folsom granite, which
would be, he delares, an immense saving.
| As planned now the structure would cost
lin "the neighborhood of $1,000,000. This
| sum could be lessened by $400,000 if Fol
: som granite could be used.
Mr. Duncan is not insensible to the fact
: that there would doubtless be protests en
tered against the use of Folsoni granite,
I but if about $600,000 of the sum needed
1 could be raised by private donation the
' regents would then be at liberty to use the
I granite, without which such a magnificent
! structure as the one proposed could never
! be erected.
Professor Soule, who occupies the chair
of civil engineering at Berkeley, has exam
ined the plans presented by Mr. Duncan,
and like all who have seen them is heartily
in favor of them.
ART IN LONDON.
Wilbur A. Reaser's Interesting Lecture
at the First Unitarian
Church.
The lecture on "What I Saw in the Lon
don Studios," delivered in the lecture-room
ol the First Unitarian Church yesterday
afternoon by the rising young artist, Wil
bur A. Reaser, was well attended, the fem
inine element predominating.
Mr. Wilbur has spent many years of his
life in California and returned here a few
months ago, after seven years' study in
the celebrated art schools of London, Paris
and Holland.
The principal part of his paper was de
voted to Watts and Burne-Jones. It al?o
contained reminiscences of the pure Ra
phaelite brotherhood and of Dan to Gabriel
Rosetti, their leader. Of them he said:
"Outof the large body of paintersof whom
I promised to talk to you two men rise
pre-eminent â George Frederick Watts and
Edward Burne-Jones. What sudden and
delightful visions these names recall to
our eyes !
"I resent much that has been written of
Burne-Jones. I cannot for. a moment ac
cept the English verdict that he is the
freatest of living painters. His work, at
est so legendary, so pre-Raphaelite in
spirit, seems far removed from our day,
and yet it is linked with English ideals,
sentiment and literature.
"When I went to see Ford Maddox
Brown, who was in bed nursing the gout,
I told him that in San Francisco we had
reproductions of most of the pre-Rapheal
ite pictures and an art school with a mem
bership of over 100. He fairly gasped in
his astonishment and sent for Sevens, the
celebrated critic, to whom I was called
upon to repeat my statement. They ap
peared as astonished as if I were a native of
Ashanteeland and made the statement
concerning the natives."
A VETERAN'S SUICIDE.
John M. Gray Shoots Himnelf at the
Entrance to the Metropol
itan Temple.
John M. Gray, an army veteran, com
mitted suicide yesterday afternoon by
shooting himself in the right temple. He
had gone into the main entrance to the
Metropolitan Hall on Fifth street and shot
himself at the bottom of the steps, just
behind the door.
The report of the shot attracted the at
tention of a passer-by, who on seeing the
condition of the old man notified the po
liceman on the bsat. The ambulance was
summoned and Gray taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, but he died in a few minutes.
His body was removed to the Morgue.
In his pockets was a card on which he
had written: "A total wreck financially
and pnysically. A little left invest pocket.
Take something and don't make wry faces
at me. Branch, 861 Market street.-"
He was a cripple and had been iiving at
the Branch House, 861 Maricet street. He
was 67 years of ace and Was born in Ken
tucky. During the Mexican War he served
as first sergeant, Company E, Easton's
Battalion, Missouri Infantry, and during
the Civil War he was a member of Com
pany B, Seventh California Infantry.
Selling Lottery Tickets.
H. C. Mangels, proprietor of a cigar-store on
East and Clay streets, was convicted in Judge
Low's court yesterday of selling lottery tickets
and was fined f 100, with the alternative of
100 days in the County Jail.
IN RICHMOND DISTRICT
Complaining of the Market-
Street Railway Com
pany's Service.
No Relief Yet From the Sewer
Nuisanceâ lmprovement Under
Difficulties.
At a meeting of the Richmond District
Improvement Association Wednesday
evening the Market-street Railway Com
pany's service was warmly discussed. Su
perintendent Vining's recent economical
changes in the schedule of the McAllister
and Sacramento streets lines was especially
denounced. The cars are run so far apart
that long waits at the crossings are neces
sary, and the last car leaving the ferry a
half hour earlier is a source of incon
venience.
After a number of speeches J. G. Ma
loney introduced the following resolutions,
which were unanimously adopted by the
association:
Whereas, The consolidated railroad com
panies have withdrawn car service from their
lines leading Into .Richmond, evidently in the
interest of economy and cheap ideas brought
on.t by Manager Vlning, who has by his actions
proved himself and the people whom he rep
resents to be a cheap and retrogressive crowd;
be it
Jiesolrcd, That we ask all citizens of the City,
as well as Richmond, to patronize thos3 lines
which do accommodate and listen fo the peo
ple's wishes, the lines deserving of public sup
port leading into this district being the Sutter
j street, the Sutro and the Geary street railroad
lines, as those lines know the public wants
and do not resort to cheap Eastern notions and
ideas in treating with those from whom they
i derive their support.
Rexolrea, That we denounce the Silurian
ideas of the manager of the combine's lines,
and believe that the sooner it withdraws the
balance of its cars and allows better and more
: proKressive Hne3 to occupy the streets of our
| district the better off the district and its resi
j dents will be. Although we aimed to treat all
i lines alike: the action of the manager of the
combine's lines forces us to denounce its course
and ask all persons to assist those lines which
j are deserving of public aid and support.
"This is the only way we can adopt if
we would move Vining," said a prominent
member of the association yesterday. "We
have tried pleading and argument, so we
can only refuse 10 patronize the cars."
The property-owners around Twelfth
avenue and California street are waiting
for Contractor J. J. Flynn to take up the
sewer which he so peculiarly laid several
months ago. It seems to have been con
structed for every other purpose than for
draining the sewage from the locality.
The residents are obliged to dig holes in
their back yards where they may im
pound the matter that cannot escape
through the sewer. Two weeks ago Flynn
was ordered by the authorities to imme
diately take up'the piping and lay it down
properly. Me is taking his time evidently,
I as only a small excavation has been made
i in the street over the sewer and the prop
erty-owners are wondering how long tlie
nuisance will last.
"The Health Officer promptly took the
matter in hand," said J. Baily, one of the
I sufferers, "but the contractor seems to be
in no hurry about repairing the sewer.
Neither myself nor my neiÂ«hoors can use
j our closets or sinks. We have to empty
j all the sewage in pits dug in the soil. We
j have all paid for that sewer and get no use
i out of it. The value of property on mis
! block is deteriorating, because nobody will
j purchase under this condition of things.
\ I am agent for a number of Jots here, and
I have lost sales because I can't recom
mend the sewer system of this iocality.
| Flynn did another bad job on Thirteenth
avenue and the Street Department won't
accept it. Richmond district wants to be
progressive, but between a poor car service
on the part of the Market-street Railway
Company, the graveyards all around it
and cboked-up sewers, this part of the
City has a hard time."
The Railroad Blameless.
The Coroner's jury yesterday held the rail
road blameless for the death of Angus McDon
ald, who was killed on the Southern Pacific
track near Randall street on March 22. It was
agreed that Bertha L. Bryant, who was found
dead in her room in a Sutter-street lodging
house, came to he> death by carbolic acid ad
ministered by parties unknown. In the cases
of William Giles, whose body was found la ihe
bay, and Joy Gordon, who shot himself, ver
dicts of auicide were returned.
PETITION OF MERCHANTS.
Determined Effort to Get. the
Wiimerding School Lo
cated Here.
JAMES D. PHELAN'S OPINION.
Members of the Merchants' Associa
tion Strongly in Favor of
the Project.
More of the poor boys in San Francisco
will have a chance to learn a trade if the
gentlemen who want the Wiimerding
School of Industrial Arts located here can
carry their point, a considerable
time efforts have been put forth for the
practical union of the Lick Technical
School with the new Wiimerding School
of Industrial Arts. The Merchants' Asso
ciation, in particular, has interested itself
to this end, its members being a unit on
the proposition.
Yesterday afternoon the sub-committee,
to which the engineering of the movement,
so far as the association is concerned, has
been intrusted, held an executive meeting
in the rooms of the association in the Mills
building. Alfred Bouvier presided, and
there were in attendance F. W. Dohr
mann, Hugo D. Keil and J. Richard
tfreud, representing the Merchants' Asso
ciation; J. D. Phelan, representing the
Art Association; and H.J.Crocker, who
acted as spokesman for the Chamber of
Commerce, Jlr. Bouvier performing the
same office for the State Development
Committee.
The session was brief, the participants
being all of one mind on the matter under
consideration. Mr. Phelan, to whom the
preparing of a memorial to the regents of
the State University had been intrusted,
made a brief report ana submitted a
draft of the proposed memorial, which,
with a few additions, was accepted as
fully covering the ground.
"This memorial, remarked Mr. Phelan,
"will be presented to the Board of Ke
gents at their meeting on the 31st of this
month. In brief, it sets forth the many
weighty reasons why the Wiimerding
School should be placed here, where poor
boys are so plentiful, and where it could
do so vast an amount of good. It is dis
tinctly stated that no corporate union be
tween the two institutions is desired, but
at the same time we lay stress upon the
point that much can be' gained by having
the two schools near each other, in order
that one may supplement and perfect the
other's work, each institution being inde
pendent, having its own faculty and sep
arate management.
"We shall further ask, in accordance
with this view, that the regents permit
the Wilmarding School to be erected on
the Lick property adjoining the James
Lick Technical School, the Jand for the
building being leased from the regents; or
if this be impracticable then that the Wii
merding School be located near the Lick
School, so that the teachers and students !
of both may be mutually benefited b> r the
interchange of courtesies and by working |
together for tne ends common to both.
"It strikes me," commented Mr. Phelan, |
"that this would be a peculiarly happy
arrangement. The honored names of two
great philanthropists would thus be asso
ciated. Each institution, having the other
near it, would be in good company, while
neither would conflict with the other. The
Lick School, as I am informed, deals prin
cipally with the science of mechanics, the
practical, manual work done being chiefly
in the nature of demonstrations in c!asa.
The Wiimerding School, on the contrary,
will take no account of brains, but rather
occupy itself with the hands of its alumni.
There the boys will be taught to work, not
particularly to understand, saving as un
derstanding comes by practical work. This
consideration must make it evident how
admirably the two institutions would work
side by side. In the Lick School the boy
would learn the theory of his chosen trade,
and as soon as he should gain a fairly in
telligent knowledge of it he would be trans
ferred across the way to the Wiimerding
School, where he would be taught to turn
that knowledge to practical account."
A LITTLE PET TREE.
Mr. Craw of the Horticultural Commit'
sion H:ii a Queer Plant.
A pretty window ornament is a tiny
alligator pear tree which Alexander Craw
of the State Horticultural Commission
cherishes as the apple of his eye. The
tree is about six months old and is large
for its ane, being about three feet high.
No sordid dark-hued earth gives nourish
ment to its dainty thread-like roots â which
float at will â within the crystalline depths
of a transparent water jar.
Any one, says Mr. Craw, may have one
of these graceful and unique ornaments.
The alligator pear is easily procured at
most Jaree fruitstores. One end of the
pear should be cut off and the uncut end
allowed to rest above the neck of a wide
mouthed iar of water, the water barely
touching the fruit. Every week or so the
â water should be changed, the pear being
handled as little and as tenderly as
P9ssib!e. The germ within the pear will
soon commence to swell, and in a short
time will rend tue fruit aasunder, sending
up a tiny shoot of green whicli will grow
with astonishing rapidity. Mr. Craw's
tree has leaves averaging ten inches in
length by three in width, and is much,
admired by all who have seen it.

STREET FUNDS EXHAUSTED.
Xo More ContractH Can Be Paid Out of
This Year's Appropriation.
Superintendent of Streets Thomas Ash
worth has notified the Board of Super
visors that there is danger of a shortage in
the funds of his department if any more
contracts for street work are made during
the present fiscal year.
He stated In his communication tnat
the outstanding liabilities created by the
legislative action of the board in conjunc
tion with the expenditures that must ne
cessarily be incurred by tne Street Depart
ment in the reconstruction and repairs
of accepted streets, the cleaning and
sweeping of the same, the repairing and
cleaning of sewers and the maintenance of
public parks and squares would exhaust
the appropriation made by the board lor
the fiscal year ending June 30 next.
The Fire Department.
The Fire Commissioners yesterday afternoon
decided to loan Mayor Sutro a cart and hose
for tire protection at the Cliff House. George
Duncan, driver of engine 29, was tried on a
charge of using disrespectful language con
cerning nis superior officers and making mm
self generally disagreeable. He was found
guilty and was dismissed from the department.
CASE OF THE FAIR WILL
The Absence of Judge Slack Will
Postpone the Hear
ing.
Lawyers for the Principal Heirs Are
Still Undetermined as to Their
Future Action.
The absence of Judge Slack will un
doubtedly postpone any action in the Fair
will case, which stands on the calendar for
to-day. All the attorneys in the case are
absolutely mute as to what steps have
been taken, if any, looking to a reassemb
ling or a redistribution of the forces to the
iight.
There was to have been a meeting of the
attorneys for the children for the purpose
of deciding upon a course to be taken â
whether to join ex-Judge Paterson in his
opposition to the will of the 21st or
whether to join Delmas & Shortridge in
support of the will. The fact that the
counsel for the children presented the will
of the 24th to the court as the real and last
will of James G. Fair and opposed the will
of the 21st and afterward deserted that
will and assented to the probate of the will
of the 21st leaves their next action a matter
of reasonable doubt.
What their next move will be, therefore,
is a matter of considerable interest to all
concerned. As stated, ex-Judge Paterson
is in hopes they will.join him, but to do so
they will have to flatly repudiate their
previous and recorded position in court.
It is probable that some other Judge
will call the calendar for Judge Slack to
day, but whether a day for the trial may
be fixed cannot be said.

Employment Obtained by a Large
Number of Striking
Painters.
BOSSES EXPECTED TO YIELD.
The Building Trades Council Has Se
lected Two Temporary Busi
ness Agents.
There were no startling developments in
the strike of the union painters yesterday.
The men were greatly encouraged upon
learning that about 100 more of their num
ber had fonnd work with the friendly
bosses. They learned that several of the
prominent contracting painters were about
to open union shops. Every master
painter who comes into line adds to their
strength, they contend, in their fight with
their avowed enemies.
. Great preparations are being made for
the big benefit for the strikers to be given
in the Bush-street Theater next Wednes
day evening by the theatrical profession.
Already talent enough has volunteered to
give three shows, and it is all of the first
class professional order.
There is nothing new on the masters'
side ot the controversy.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening H. M. Saunders of
the Carpenters' and R. T. Mclvor of the
Painters' unions were selected as tempo
rary business agents for all the unions in
the council. Permanent agents will be
elected on April 11.
BETTER TIMES AHEAD.
The Striking Painters Are Greatly
Encouraged by Signs of Future
Activity In Trade.
The meeting of the striking painters yes
terday morning was more cheerful than
nny since the strike beeran. The reason
was because times are brightening for the
painters, and the majority expect to re
ceive employment before the middle of
next month. By that time the Building
Trades Council's card system will be in
operation and the only work done at all
will be by union men. In the meantime
there is every reason to believe that seme
of the bosses who are wavering between
the stand taken by the Master Painters'
Association and the demands of the
Painters' Union are likely to accede to the
latter in order to get their work done by
competent men and without trouble.
Reports were made at the meeting that
several of the larger painting contractors
are asking for union men to go to work
and are only prevented from coming out
openly and acknowledging the union by
the fear that some one will taunt them
with having been defeated. One or the
largest employers in the City is expected
to unionize his shop within thirty-six
hours, as he has several large contracts on
hand and the property-owners have but
little confidence in the non-union men
employed being able to do good work or
get work done on time. The man is really
an enemy of the union and he has no
great friendship for the masters' associa
tion.
Last Monday the union's initiation fee
i>ed from 25 cents to $10. Yesterday
live new members paid in their fees and
took the obligation. The union interpret
this to mean that even the non-union men,
who have held out since the strike began,
have become alarmed and want to be in
the union before it is too late. A victory
for the strikers will virtually drive the non
union men out of town, for after a few
days they may be blackballed should they
try to join, arid they would be driven from
every job where members of the Building
Trades are at work.
From all accounts between seventy -five
and 100 more painters went to work yester
day, which reduces the strike situation to
a considerable extent. The number of
iilie strikers who registered, as they are
required to do, was correspondingly re
duced.
President Rose, in discussine the situa
tion, said:
The hoys are feeling much better to-day than
they have before. While they were confident
of winning their fight there were times when
things did not look so encouraging as they do
now. I refer to the times when the out Vide
pressure was causing internal differences. I
am glad to say That these differences have all
been straightened out and the men have more
confidence in each other, in their cause and in
themselves than they had then. Ido not want
the public to think that this strike has not
caused considerable suffering among the mem
bers' famihes, but our relief committee has
done good work and cared for those who wera
in actual want. The public also has come to
our relief in a most generous manner. We do
not care to have the dark side of the strike
published, but I tell you it is rarely that a
strike takes place but what it is accompanied by
suffering, worry and too often privation and
want.
There is one thing I want to commend. In
our union are many men with families, and to
the^e the single men have given way with a
pelt-sacrificing spirit that is truly commend
able. The single men can stand idleness better
than the men who have families dependent
upon them. Their time will come before long.
THE BUILDING TRADES.
The Council Selects Two Temporary
Business Agents to Look After
Union Matters.
Considerable important business was
transacted at a meeting of the Building
Trades Council last evening. The dele
gate from Carpenters' and Joiners' Union
483 stated that his union had come to the
front in support of the painters' strikÂ°,
and after April 1, when the working card
of the council goes into effect, every job
on which non-union painters are at work
will be '-struck." Financial support will
be given when wanted.
Delegate McKenzie of the Plasterers'
Union was chosen as financial secretary,
vice Hanley, who is out of town.
Delegate H. M. Saunders stated that he
wished the Building Trades Council to
indorse a resolution he had to present.
trie called attention to the fact that Clans
Spreckels had recently given to the Pacific
Rolling Mills of this City the contract for
2200 tons of steel to be used in the con
struction of t lie new home of The Call on
Market and Third streets. This is of great
importance to the workmen of this City
and to those connected with the building
trades. Mr. SprecKels has by this act
taken a stand as a patron of home indus
tries and at the same time furnished
employment for a large force of working
men. "By letting this large contract toa
local manufacturer he will be the means of
distributing thousands of dollars among
the workingmen of this City. His example
should be followed by all others, Mr.
Saunders said, and added that he desired
an expression of appreciation from the
Building Trades Council and offered the
following resolution, which was enthusi
astically adopted :
Whereas, The proprietor of the new Cau
building has purchased the 2200 tons of steel
to be used from a local manufacturer, thereby
stimulating home industry and providing em
plovraent ior idle men; be it
Resolved, By the Building Trades Council of
Han Francisco, tnat thi? action calls for the
most generous approval on our part, and we
do hereby tender oui hearty thanks to Claus
Hpreckels for this evidence of his public spirit,
and urge others who depend upon the public
fur patronage and support to follow his ex
ample.
Under the constitution of the council
the business agent or agents shall be se
lected by the several unions composing
that body at a regularly called mass-meet
ing. So far no meeting has been called
for- this purpose, and, as the by-laws per
mitted, the council selected two. who will
act from April 1 until their successors are
elected at a meeting which will be held on
the morning of April 11. The business
agents elected by the council were H. M.
Saunders (the walking delegate for the
Carpenters') and R. T. Mclvor (who holds
a similar position in the Painters' Union).
These business agents will attend to all of
the outside business in tneir line for all
unions represented in the council.
The delegates were instructed to call the
attention of the members of their unions
to the bis mass-meeting which will be held
at 115 Turk street on the 31st inst., at
which the working card and other im
portant matters will be discussed.
SHINGLERS ORGANIZE.
They Will Form a Union and
Join the Building Trades
Council.
There are in thisCitv about forty shing
lers. Of this number thirty-five signed a roll
and organized a Shinglers' Union last
evening at 115 Turk street. Organizer
Zant of the Building Trades Council ex
plained the new card system to the mem
bers of the new union, which will at once
send delegates to the council.
The temporary officers selected were:
W. E. Doyle, president; J. F. Harney,
secretary; Benjamin McGrath, treasurer;
L. Smith, marshal.
A committee composed of George
Barker, Frank Gorman and J. T. Tierney
was selected to frame a constitution and
by-laws.
"The union will meet Thursday night
next to confer with the Building Trades
Council and again Friday night to go into
permanent organization.
THE STRANGLER AGAIN
Irene Phillips' Assailant Attacks
a Girl on Ellis
Street.
His Latest Attempt Has Satisfied Cap
tain Lees of the Fellow's
Identity.
The strangler who attempted to choke
Irene Phillips in her room on Sutter street,
has appeared in a house on Ellis street
and there endeavored to carry out bis in
sane desire on an unfortunate woman
named Petit. Both these women tell the
same story and have given the same de
scription of tJie strangler to the police
who are now searching for him throughout
the City.
The woman Irene Wilson, as she is
sometimes called, but whose real name is
Phillips, who has reported to the police
that a stranger attempted to strangle her
last Monday evening at 304 Sutter street,
was none the worse yesterday for the
alleged choking. She was called upon by
i Detective Ben Bohen, to whom, in the
presence of her sister, Frankie Phillips, at
21 Quincy street, she made a complete
statement of the affair and gave a precise
description of the man she believes in
tended her murder. Subsequently, with a
broad silken band about her throat to hide
the finger-marks of the strangler, she de
parted for the Bay District racetrack in
search of her prey.
The woman is very precise in her de
scription of her assailant, saying:
"He is a man 5 feet 8 or 9 inches tall',
stoutly built ana about 39 years old. His
medium-sized face is adorned with a
blonde mustache that does not quite hide
his very red lips or his tine set of white
teeth. "He wore a sack suit of dark mate
rial and a brown derby hat." The de
scription is completed with the statement
that "the man's hands are very soft and
velvety, but powerful."
Another woman| who had a narrow es
cape from the murderous clutches of the
strangle^ was Laura Petit, 212 Elhs
street, and she is congratulating herself
that another woman was in an adjoining
room, which saved her from the fate of
Mamie MrDermott and Bertha Paradis.
Her description of the man corresponds
in every particular with that given by
Irene Phillips of the man who tried to
strangle her Monday ni-iht.
He is apparently an Englishman, about
5 feet 9 inches tall, long blonde hair,
blonde mustache curled, small regular
teeth slightly blackened by the use of
tobacco or opium, large blue eyes with the
whites bloodshot, short neck and appar
ently SO years of age. He is well dressed
in a dart cheviot suit, stiff hat and carries
hi? overcoat over his arm.
The police have been in possession of
this description from different women
for some time, but, strange to say, he has
not yet been captured.
In speaking of his visit Laura Petit said
last night: "The man came to the house
last nitrht. As soon as he entered the
room I had an uncomfortable feeling that
I cannot detine, and somehow his bie,
bloodshot blue eyes sent a thrill of fear
through me. It'maue me watch him nar
rowly.
"He talked pleasantly for a'few minutes.
He invited me to sit beside him, and as I
did so I observed a peculiar twitching in
his hngers. And let me say, he had beauti
fui hands.
"He put his right hand on the back of
my neckand drew it round to my throat.
I took hold of his hand and threw it off,
teJline him not to do that. There was a
looK on the man's face that frightened me.
Three times he put his hand on my neck
and drew it round to my throat, and each
time I threw it off.
"I became so alarmed that I told him I
had friends in the next room and must go
to them. I rose from the sofa and as I did
so he stood up. His hands were twitching
convuisiveiy and I cailed out to my friend
in the nextroom that I would be in to see
her in a minute. She replied, ' All right,'
and suddenly the man's whole nature
changed. As I opened the door and let
him out he seemed a quiet nice gentleman.
"I reported the man's peculiar conduct
to Detective Anthony the following day.
If I had been alone in the liouse I would
have run outside and eiven an alarm as I
wa3 afraid of the man and had a feeling
that he might strangle me."
Yesterday afiernoon Captain Lees in
structed Detective Anthony to get an ac
curate description of the man from Laura
Petit and on comparing it with the descrip
tion of Irene Phillips' visitor the conclu- I
sion was plain it was the same man.
A Warlike Youth.
According to the Philadelphia Record
the war fever has struck the schools of
Philadelphia. "The boys' military organi
zations iii the public schools," it says, "are
discussing the advisability of marching on
Spain. A nine-year-old youth of one of
the uptown schools fairly exploded with
patriotism the other night. He has a set
of cards representing the flaes of all
nations, and he had industriously, by the
aid of colored crayons, made a number of
paper copies of the flag of Spain. Care
fully gathering up the copies he took them
down to the kitchen and, with' an air of
'determination, began throwing them one
by one into the tire. When asked what
he meant by destroying the result of his
labor, he sternly replied: 'Us boys are
goipg to show Spain that we ain't afraid
of her, and I'm burning up the Spanish
flag. That's what I'm doing. All us boys
are going to burn Spanish flags.' Then he
solemnly loaded up hip Fourth of July
pistol with caps and fired a salute in honor
of the event."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1896.
TO BURN THE GARBAGE
Alameda Is Getting Ready to
Establish a Crema
tory.
OBJECTIONS TO THE DUMPS.
Bay Farm Islanders Think That Their
Typhoid Fever Results From
the Present System.
The proposition to establish a crematory
at or near Bay Farm Island, for the pur
pose of burning the Alameda garbage
instead of dumping it on the island, the
latter method being in operation at pres
ent, has aroused much interest across the
bay, and is meeting with general favor.
The health officers say that the crematory
is necessary in order to ensure satisfactory
sanitary conditions if the garbage is not
to be removed entirely from this vicinity,
and with the furnaces in use about the
only nuisance that could be charged
against the city would be abolished.
Under the present system, most of the
garbage is hauled to Bay Farm Island,
â¢which is a part of Alameda, and is dumped
there. Another dumping ground is on
the lowland near Webster street and the
sstuary. Recently a tract of land near
the southern end of Mound street was de
voted to the same purpose, but the City
Trustees nave remedied the condition that
long existed there.
The offensive nature of thii system of
disposing ol the refuse materials from the
Alameda homes is the principal objection,
for the regular burning of the garbage at
the West End dumps removes the danger
to health.
Bay Farm Island property-owners, are
inclined to believe that the garbage has
been one of the chief causes of the typhoid
fever that ha"s caused a proportionately
large number of deaths on the island dur
ing several years and they will be glad to
have the conditions changed, but tbe
health officers declare that the garbage has
not been a cause of the sickness.
Dr. Thomas Carpenter, the veterinary
surgeon of the health board, has made
numerous official visits to tbe island and
in connection with his work he has studied
what he believes to be the real causes of
the typhoid.
"In the first place," said he, yesterday,
"there are no sewers on the island and the
land is so low that there is little natural
drainage. The impurities cannot be thor
oughly washed away by the rains.
"Decomposed matter is used to an enor
mous extent in fertilizing the gardens that
are numerous on the island. Asparagus,
which is grown in immense quantities,
and other vegetables are trimmed near the
houses of the market-gardeners and heaps
of the refuse vegetable matter decay and
are allowed to remain for months. With
these conditions and toe lack of drainage
it is no wonder that typhoid fever breaks
out on the island.
"Of course the dumping of garbage on ,
the island does not help matters any, but
there are more important objections for
the islanders to raise. With ordinary
sanitary conditions Bay Farm Island, sit
uated as it is, ought to be about as free
from disease as any place in the world."
Dr. C. H. Lubbbcfe, the health officer,
expressed the same views when inter
viewed by a Call representative.
"I have seen a typhoid fever patient on
the island in a room whose windows
opened on a heap of decomposed vege
table matter that was piled right up
against the house," he said.
"Surface wells are used by most of the
people on the island, and where the de- j
composed matter is spread so thick over
the ground it would be impossible to pre-.
vent the water from becoming con
taminated.
"The island is splendidly eituated. Sur
rounded by the salt water of the bay and
with strong and steady winds blowing
over the entire expanse, nature has en
dowed it with great advantages. There
ought to be no typhoid fever tliere, and
there need be none, even though the
dumping of garbage at one end is con
tinued. Only the islanders who allow the
decomposed matter to lie thick about their
premises have had typhoid fever."
Dr. Lubbock suggests that the planting
of rows of eucalyptus trees about the
entire island would result in a great im
provement and would give a decidedly
picturesque appearance. He says that the
trees, as they should be planted, would
not interfere with the sweep of the wind.
In regard to the disjjosal of the Alameda
garbage, Dr. Lubbock strongly favored a
crematory. He is opposed to the mainte
nance of dumps in Alameda, as the homes
of the people reach to almost every limit
of the city.
The City Trustees are to take up the
garbage question at their next meeting.
TWELVE YEARS OF WORK
Ladies of Lincoln Relief Corps
Celebrate Its Anni
versary.
Cards, Music, Dancing and a Sumptuous
Banquet Enjoyed by Three Hun
dred Guests.
Gray, scarred veterans and blushing
buds of maiden loveliness waged war
over card-tables, mingled in the dance or
joined Ea the pleasures of the table in
honor of Lincoln Relief .Corps' twelfth an
niversary, which was commemorated last
night.
Native Sons' Hall, on Mason street,
near Post, was given over to the merry
makers, who held high revelry. The meet
ing-rooms of the corps were filled with
card-tables, where the more sedate ele
ment congregated to enjoy a quiet rubber,
while the devotee" of the light-footed god
dess found a more congenial rendezvous
in the quarters of Lincoln Post, G. A. R.,
on the same floor.
About 300 guests were in attendance, the
ladies being beautifully gowned, while the
military portion of the male contingent
wore full-dress uniforms, putting the mere
civilian altogether in the shade.
The gathering was entirely informal,
but, perhaps for that very reason, most
enjoyable, the ladies of the corps doing all
in their power to make their guests feel at
home. About 9:30 o'clock a sumptuous
banquet was served in one of the lower
halls, during which the following toasts
were drunk, being responded to with ap
propriate, and in some instances very elo
quent addresses:
"Organization of Ltncoin Corps," C. Mason
Kinne. past department commander.
"Grand Army of the Republic," Charles E.
Wiigon, department commander; music,
"Marching Through Georgia."
"Woman's Relief Corps," Mrs. Geraldlne E.
Frlsoie, past department president.
"Lincoln Post In Its Relations to the Corps,"
H. W. Mortimer, post commander; music,
"Rally Round the Flag."
"Lincoln Corps in Its Relations to the Post,"
Mrs. L. Milne, corps president.
"The Name Honored by Post and Corps-
Abraham Lincoln," Hon. H. C. Dibble, past
post commander.
Music, "Tenting To-Night."
"Loyal Women During the War," Hon. A. J.
Buckles, past department commander.
"Loyal Women Since the War," Rev. E. R.
Dille.'past department chaplain.
Music, "Johnny Comes Marching Home."
The menu was excellent and varied, and
the banquet hall, with its hangings of
bunting and garlands of flowers, presented
a beautiful picture. The tables were ar
ranged in tne form of a Maltese cross, that
being the shape of the badge worn by mem
bers of the corps. Mr. Kinne presided
over the entire affair, but was heard to
remark that, the ladies having arranged
everything to work like clockwork, he had
nothing to do but look on with the puests.
Lincoln Relief Corps No. 3, W. R. C,
was organized twelve years ago, Mr. Kinne
installing its first officers. Since its or
ganization the corps has expended in its
charities over $6500 in money alone, be
uides large quantities of clothing, medicine
and provisions. The dues of the members,
who now number 175, would not be
sufficient to enable the corps to dispense
such liberal aid to the needy, and the
necessary funds are raised by the
annual bazaar by means of which^tbe
organization is enabled to be charitable
and yet remain solvent, having at present
$1140 in its treasury. All old soldiers in
need are aided, whether members of the
Grand Army of the Republic or not. Its
present officers are Mrs. L. C. Milne, pres
ident; Mrs. Frances Williams, first vice
president; Mrs. Edith Corastock, second
vice-president; Miss Hattie Adams, secre
tary, and Mrs. Ella Bailey, treasurer.
OUTING OF THE BUTCHERS
Arrangements Being Made for
the Great Event on
May 20.
Twenty Thousand Persons Will At
tend From Here, Stockton, San .
Jose and Sacramento.
The Butchers' Board of Trade is prepar
ine for its third annual celebration, which
will be held on Wednesday, May 20, at
Shell Mound Park and the Oakland race
track, both places being necessary to ac
commodate the crowd which will be enter
tained.
At the last celebration over 19000 people
were present. Every market will be closed
all day and not a pound of meat will be
sold in either San Francisco, Oakland,
Alameda or Berkeley.
The fine of $50 as a penalty for keeping
open on this day is rigidly enforced.
Though there are nearly 600 marKets in
the City but one violation of this order
was recorded during the two previous cele
brations.
It is the purpose of the committee to
furnish a varied programme at tne race-

track, commencing at 12 K. and lasting un
til 5 r. m., consisting of horse races, bicycle
races, trick-riding, bronco-busting, etc.
To avoid long waits between races it has
been planned to have some event come off
every fifteen minutes.
The programme at the racetrack and at
Shell Mound wilJ be carried out af the
same time, the hours for beginning and
closing being identical. At Shell Mound
a series of games and races for valuable
prizes will occupy the hours between 2 and
sp. m. Those who prefer can indulge in
dancing to fine music in the pavilion.
Bands will be stationed in the grand stand
at the racetrack, in the amphitheater at
Snell Mound Park and one each in the
pavilions.
Arrangements have been made with the
railway company to run excursions from
Sacramento, San Jose and Stockton, and
it is expected fully 5000 persons will attend
the annual celebration from those cities.
A low rate has been made, and excursion
ists will be carried to the gates of the park
without change.
A delegation from thegeneral.committee
will visit the cities named within the next
few days to complete arrangements.
The "several standing committees have
been appointed as follows:

A Well-Preserved Man's Story.
TV hen Mr. Depew sat down, amid great
applause, the health of Mr. iiobert Bonner
was drunk, and, contrary to his usual cus
tom, the veteran ex-editor of the New
York Ledger made a short response. He
said that although public speaking was not
one of his gifts, he could not forbear from
rising and joining in the testimonials
of regard which were being presented
to his old friend and journalistic asso
ciate, Charles A. Dana. He had known
Mr. Dana for over forty years â for a
longer time, in fact, than Moses tar
ried in the wilderness. As he gazed upon
the editor of the Sun and obaerved
how bright and vigorous he was, he
could not but feel that the psalmist, in
placing the limit of human life at three
score and ten, was laying down a rule to
wnich there were notable exceptions. "As
for myself," Mr. Bonner added, "I should
like to relate a little incident which attests
that a revised version of the psa lmist's
limit is also needed to cover my case. I
was down in Georgia not long ago, and a
gentleman to whom I was introduced said
to me: 'Mr. Bonner, are you as fond of
tine horses as your father used to be? J "â
New York Mail and Express.
It Would Be a Great Change.
"Here was something that was quite
new to me," said a 6troller, "a noiseless
truck; a truck with rubber-tired wheels.
It belonged to a manufacturer or dealer in
rubber tires. I caught only a glimpse of
the signboard on the side of it, and so it
was natural enough that it should have
rubber tires, but a truck with rubber-tired
wheels was very striking, all the same.
Suppose all trucks had rubDer tires ?"â New

BREAD SELLS FOR A SONG
Three Loaves Delivered in
Town for Five
Cents.
WAR AMONG ITALIAN BAKERS.
Dealers Carrying on the Fight With
Energy While Consumers Re
ceive the Benefit.
As a result of the w.ar between the
Italian bakers three loaves of bread can
now be purchased for 5 cents.
M. Bacelli & Co. of the Co-operative
Bakery at 436\4 Union street introduced
the cut, and in order to drive the firm out
of business the Union of Italian Bakers,
which is composed exclusively of manu
facturers and dealers, and which is a
powerful organization, established a store
at 1421 Dupont street, where three loaves
of bread are also sold for 5 cents. The
competition is carried on with much
energy and keenness, and the people who
purchase Italian and French bread are de
riving benefit from it.
Bacelli & Co. seem pleased with the
prospects of what promises to be a long
and bitter fight, as they say that they are
now selling on an average 3000 loaves of
bread a day, and by handling such large
quantitiesat low prices they can make the
business pay, though they confess that
they will not get rich at it.
F~. T. Guinasso of 1309 Dupont street is
president of the Bakers' Union which is
fighting Bacelli & Co. He says it is im
possible for the manufacturer to sell three
loaves of Italian or French bread for 5
cents and make a living in the business.
The dealers in the union sell two loaves
for a nickel. Formerly it was one loaf.
There are nine bakers belonging to the
nnion. They are as follows: P. T. Gui
nasso, 1309 Dupont street; C. Luccliesi &
Brother, 323 Broadway; Razzetto <fe Ur

"In February, 1895," said Mr. Guinasso
yesterday, "Levrero opened a place at 1407
Dupont street and commenced selling two
loaves of bread for 5 cents. This was the
beginning of all the trouble. Up to this
time the Italian bakers sold one loaf for 5,
{'ust the same as the French and German
lakers. This one loaf weighed almost as
much as the two which we now sell for 5
cents. These two weigh about one and a
half pounds. Well, when the cut was
made the old dealers got together and
started a bakery in opposition to 1421 Du
pont street and began selling three loaves
for 5 cents. Of course the place was run !
at a loss, but the union stood it, and Le
vrero was obliged to go out of business.
He had to compete with the union, ami,
as he could not make expenses, his busi
ness went to the wall. The union then
closed up its shop where three loaves were
sold for 5 cents, and the uniform rate oi 5
cents for two loaves was established among
the tiakers.
"We not only Bell three small loaves of
bread for 5 cents, and three large ones for
10," said Mr. Bacelli, "but we deliverthem
to any part of the City. We cannot supply j
the demand. Of course, our trade is done j
on a cash basis. We could not afford to
carry on a credit business at such low fig
ures for bread. Our sales average 3000
loaves a day. Of course, we do rot expect
to grow rich ; but we are paying expenses,
and that satisfies us while the combine
continues to try and drive us out of busi
ness.
"The union has gone to all the mills in
San Francisco, and even to Oakland, to
influence them from selling us flour, to
injure our credit. But we buy for cash,
and are independent of the mills and
dealers."
During the day there was a constant
stream of men, women and children
passing in and out of the bakery burdened
with bread at "three for 5."
At the beginning of the eighteenth cen
tury there were over 200 offenses in Eng
land that were punishable by death.

ARE IN LINE FOR
PARTY SUCCESS
Local Republicans Ready
for a Hearty and
United Pull.
THE COMING PRIMARY.
It Will Soon Be Called and Will
Be Free From Corrupt Boss
Domination.
WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE
The Headquarters of John D. Spreckels
Increase in Life as the Con
vention Nears.
Local Republican affairs are awaiting
the call for the primary election for the
selection of delegates to the State Gonvea- j
tion to be held at Sacramento May 5.
Within a very few days this call will be
issued by the County Committee, and the
party enthusiasm being shown in this Re- j
publican year promises that the voters of
the party will turn out in great numbers
on election day to deposit ballots whose
force will be felt in the National Conven
tion.
No contests of importance are yet in
eight, but as John D. Spreckels and those
committeemen and others who are work
ing with him in the interest of fairness,
clean politics and popular rule, have won
victories for open primaries in the Fourth
and Fiftn districts there will be an equal
chance for all tickets at the polls, and the
voters of the districts will say who shall
represent them at Sacramento in naming
-delegates to the National Convention.
Meantime the activity increases daily at
the headquarters of John D. Spreckels, at
850 Market street, where Republicans
actively interested in party affairs stream
in and out toward the close of each after
noon and until late in the evening. Mr.
Spreckels is constantly receiving congratu
lations of leading Republicans and dele
gations from district clubs on his complete
victory over tricksters, who began an effort
to manipulate the party to their own ends,
and on his bringing the dawn cf
an era in San Francisco politics when the
Republican party is freed from the domi
nation of corrupt bosses. The party has
become united under Mr. Spreckels' lead
ership, and the strength and decency of
the party has fairly started together on
the campaign that hears such certain
promises of success. Among the club
delegations that called at Republican
headquarters yesterday were representa
tive ones from the Thirty-fifth, Thirty- j
sixth and Forty -third districts.
As iB now generally understood the
County Committee will consist of
two bodies for the officinl con
duct of the coming primary. The
eleven county committeemen, repre
senting the Assembly districts in the
Fourth Congressional District, will issue
the call and supervise the primary in the \
Fourth District, and the seven members
representing the San Francisco districts
of the Fifth will act similarly for those
seven districts.
The Coneressional Committee of the
Fourth District has issued its certificate
and instructions to the county committee
men of that district, and the communica
tion displays the spirit and method that
will govern this Republican primary. The
official authorization to the County Com
mittee is as follows :
San Fkaxcisco, March 13, 1896.

P. J. Walsh, O. Bacigalupi, Thomas W. Chandler,
Republican County Committeemen of the City and
County of San Francisco, mthin the Fourth Con
gressional Districtâ Gentlemen: You and each
of you are hereby officially notified that at a
meeting of the Republican Congressional com
mittee of Beven of the Fourth Congressional
District, duly and regularly held on the 13th
day of March, 18ffe, a resolution, of which the
annexed is a copy, was duly and regularly
passed by said committee; that in accordance
with said resolution you have been constituted
a committee with the powers and duties
enumerated therein ; that as such committee
you have been given power to call and conduct
a primary election, under the auspices and
control of this Congressional committee, in
those Assembly districts in the City and
County of San Francisco embraced within the
Fourth Congressional District.
You are further requested that as soon as
such primary election has been held in your
district and the vote cast thereat has been as
certained by you, you will at Once certify
the vote cast at said election and the result
thereof to this Congressional committee of
seven, whiÂ£h Kill act as a returning board
thereon and will certify the result thereof to
the State and district conventions. You are I
hereby referred to the annexed resolution for
a more specific designation of your powers ana
duties as such committee. Yours respectfully,
Charles C. Bemis, Chairman.
Louis Pockwitz, Secretary.
The resolutions are aw follows:
Whekeas, At a meeting ol the Republican
State Central Committee from the Fourth Con
gressional District of the State of California,
duly and regularly called and held on the 4th
day of March, 18HG, in the City ol San Fran
cisco, at which said meeting a majority of the
said members from the said district were pres
ent, a resolution was duly and' regularly
adopted providing that the following
named seveii persons, electors and resi
dents of the said Fourth Congres
sional District, should be and were
thereby appointed as the committee of seven
persons from the residents of each district
who should set hs a Congressional committee
thereof, to wit: Nicholas Ohlandt. Louis
Pockwitz, C. B. Rode, C. C. Bemis, R. Kasmus
sen, F. Arata and Henry Leffmann; and
whereas, the above-named persons have duly
and regularly met and organized as such com
mittee of seveii as aforesaid; and whereas, it
is a sound and sate principle of
Republican politics that local self-govern
ment should De maintained and accorded to
the electors of each political subdivision of the
siiufie and district within which elections are
to be held, and that the management and con
trol of such elections should be placed in the
hands ot ihe regularly constituted committees
of the Republican party within such districts,
subject, however to the supervision of this
committee and in accordance with the resolu
tion* and calls of the Republican National
Committee and the State Central Committee of
the State of California, duly passed at the
recent respective meetings thereoi; therefore
it is liereby
Resolrul, Hrst, that the interests and suc
cess of the Republican party of the State of
California in the coining -state and National
campaign require that every effort should be
put forth and every means adopted by the
regularly organized age tides and committees

CHARGE OF CORRUPTION
Mrs. Rose M. French Makes an
Accusation Against a Po
lice Official.
A PLOT TO TKADUCE HER.
Dr. Dille Is Interested in the Case,
and Will Present It to the
Chief.
Serious charges against a prominent
police official will be preferred by Mrs.
Rose M. French when Chief Crowley re
turns.
The charges will give the details of an
alleged plot whereby the accused official
designed to so change the evidence against
Captain Lane as to secure his acquittal.
This was for the primar) r purpose of
bringing about the aged man's re
lease, but the secondary motive,
it is claimed, was to throw suspicion upon
Mrs. French's probity. She also claims
that an officer of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children is impli
cated in the plot.
The lady's charges will be corroborated
by a woman who is said to have been em
ployed for the double purpose mentioned
and by two members of the police foÂ«ce.
The woman who will give corroborative
testimony, a Mrs. Wilson, says that she
was assigned the task of weaving a web of
damaging evidence to show that Mrs.
French had sold out the prosecution in
the Nortn Beach case. It will be remem
bered that Mrs. French was in the em
ploy of the Police Department as
a special aid in securing testimony
for the prosecution in those cases.' It
was her duty to get the statements of the
children and to prevent their being inter
viewed by others. An effort was made by
an officer of the Humane Society to de
prive her of this custody, with the result
that he received a severe reprimand from
Chief Crowley.
Soon after this occurrence, the state
ment goes, the accused official engaged
the Wilson woman to make Mrs. French's
acauaintance, if possible, and to be seen
with her in public, especially at court.
Later she would be called upon to testify
that she and Mrs. French were acting
in collusion for the suppression of evidence
for the prosecution, for which they were
to receive a large sum of money. The first
step in the plot was the meeting between
the two women, which was to take place
in a corridor of the City Hall. Mrs. Wil
son was to accost Mrs. French and engage
her in conversation on some pretext as long
as possible, and while she was thus engaged
Chief Crowley's attention was to be called
to the meeting. This encounter was to
give color to the story the women would
tell later. Chief Crowley was not in his
office at the time, but one of his repre
sentatives was summoned and the ques
tion raised as to what was the occasion for
their protracted conversation.
Unfortunately for the plot the woman's
courage failed. She hovered near Mrs.
French like a bird of ill omen, but did not
speak to her. When she was summoned
to appear before the prime mover
in the pJot and gave her report
he said it did not signify whether
she had spoken to her or not,
so long as the purpose of her being seen
within talking distance was accomplished.
She was provided with a, list of questions
and answers in reference to the plan to
"sell out the prosecution" and instructed
to memorize them, which she did.
She was not called upon for tbis evi
dence, pre'jumably because a well-known
attorney pronounced it a game and refused
to connive in it.
Mrs. French learned of the plot by acci
dent a few days ago, and secured the
woman's statement in the presence of two
competent witnesses. She expects to pro
duce the witness in person for the little
court-martial it is expected will be held in
the Chief's office.
Dr. Dille, an active member of the Civic
Federation, is interested in the case, and
will assist in presenting it to the Chief.
The Book That the Reader Writes.
Not the least interesting of the books in
the British Museum is the volume where
complaints are entered. They till many
page?, and against each is written, after
the lapse of a few days, the learned com
ment of the superintendent. Mr. Fortes
cue, who has just retired from the post,
tells the following story with pardonable
glee: "I cannot," wrote a reader one day
in the complaint-book, "find any mention
of the works of Frey teg in the general cata
logue. Can it be possible that the officials
of this great library are ignorant of the ex
istence of this famous German novelist,
and have never heard of his works? It is
a blot on the administration of the library ,
that this great novelist's work 3 should not j
be accessible." The comment of the super
intendent upon this question was brief and
very much to the point: "The great novel
ist's name is Freytag, not Freyteg."â St.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 1896.
RAINEYITES SMELL
A LARGE RAT
A Reported Scheme of Sul
livan's to Appoint
Delegates.
NEW PLAN TO BEAT SAM
Occidental Club Will Move to
Market Street to Escape
Buckleyism.
WILL GET IN THE SWIM, TOO
There Will Now Be Fine, Large and
Convenient Buckley Headquarters
Downtown.
The latest plan of the anti-itainey
minority in the Junta is to beat out the
stableman by appointing the delegates to
| the State Convention instead of holding a
primary.
There is no official announcement to
that effect, but that scheme looms up in
the foggy, yet lurid air that envelopes
Sam Raiaey's own machine, and the
Rainey - Daggett people are eyeing
Sit with dark, determined looks
I and getting ready to shoutÂ«wbat is often
! called "blue murder." The Raineyites
are trying to find out if Chairman Sullivan
and Gavin McNab have any aces of that
color up their sleeves, but expect to be
ready with a good majority in the general
committee to select the delegates them
selves by ordering a primary, which
they can win like rolling off of logs.
Chairman; Sullivan and Gavin McNab
are not saying anything much these days
or making any announcements. No offi
cial move has been made in Junta affairs
since the meeting of the general commit
tee about two weeks ago, though under
the surface beavers' work is being
done, especially by Sam Rainey. At
the last meeting of the general
| committee chairman Sullivan's dictator
j ship was continued by authorizing him to
appoint a grievance committee to settle
the pending district troubles and a com
j mittee to prepare a constitution and by
: laws, something the organization has so
i far got along without.
As Chairman Sullivan will appoint the
law committee, it will, of course, iramethe
provisions relating to the selection of con
vention' delegates on lints that he and
otner anti-Raineyites may deem politically
wise. It may put in something about ap
pointment or delegates, and the right may
come upon the adoption of the constitution j
and by-laws in the general committee. As
the convention will not be held uhtil June
I 16, there is yet much time sto let things
i work and develop before calling another
I meeting of the general committee. The
â  appointment of delegates by any plan
1 favored by the anti-Raineyites would j
j mean that. Daggett would be dealt just a I
few delegates to Sacramento, and if this
proposition ever comes up in the Junta
' general committee there will be war then j
| ami there.
The Raineyites and the Daggettites are
I watchful and suspicious of Sullivan, and
| tueir kicks about his dictatorship are
I multiplying.
"Sullivan is in favor of home rule in '
j Ireland, but not in San , Francisco," said I
! one prominent member of the Junta yes-
I terday.
Mr. Sullivan is generally credited with I
! being opposed to primaries anyhow, be
i cause he believes that pure Democratic
| primaries are impossible in San Francisco,
! and that the interests of the party demand
that convention delegates be appointed by
the decent element of the party. Perhaps
he forgets what would be the consequences
of parting Raineyites and Buckleyites from
j their chief joy in life.
The Buckleyites are about to make an
'â¢â  other masterly move. They have decided
S that they have an astral body, and they
' are going to locate on Market street in it.
j Perhaps it would be more correct to say
| that they are going to get away, from
themselves.
Reduced to still more accurate terms the
! Occidental Club is coins? to move out of
| Buckley's big. fine," queer mansion at.
| Bii6h and Stockton streets, so that they
won't be Buckleyites any more. >At the
meeting of the State Central Committee
i the other day â  Gavin McNab told .that
Buckley owned the house, the carpets,
i the chairs, and the cuspidors that the
Bucklevites had used, and, of course, oth
; ers note the same thing. As Buckley is
j out of politics, it ;is bad : politics for the
! Buckleyites to seem so close to Mr. Buck
} ley, and the Buckley leaders have decided
j that it would be well to not be in Mr.
i Buckley's company so openly.
, There is another reason, too, and it is
another good one. The present Occidental
Club is out of the way : and people don't
| drop around unless they have specially
j important business as a rule, and head
j quarters are wanted that will ibe head
j quarters, where people < will come to re
j ceive the glad hand, and where there will
be life and the - boom 'of it. The "general
committee headquarters at 035' Market |
i street, opened two weeks ago, consists of
one room, and was selected as a temporary
place for the boys to come.
These general headquarters are for the
routine campaign business and for ' the
boys to drop in at. The Occidental Club
is a social-political , organization, : * and ;it
exists on a higher plane; It contains
Buckley's throneroom, line quarters for
the leaders to consult in, nice parlors to i
welcome strangers in and a fine sideboard
for Sam Sample to dispense ginger-ale at,
- So the Occidental is looking for adequate
Market-street quarters, where it will become
more prominent, ; more influential, more
lively and more a place where men will
come who are a little skittish about being
charged with going to see Buckley. V;
The â¢ general committee headquarters
will be : connected with it and there the
Buckley faction will take a new swing and
anew boom. â -Â :â :-. 'â  â >: â â  i :/: - ; â /-- yy_
SENATOR VILAS AND HIS PA.
The Young Man Was Always Overshad
owed by His Parent.
Senator Vilas never dawned as a ereat
light on the political horizon until the
Wisconsin Democrats sent him to the
Chicago convention which nominated Mr.
Cleveland for the Presidency. For many
weary years the man who has since made
I such a brilliant reputation as a Cabinet
officer and member of the United States
Senate was overshadowed and obscnred
by his father. The elder Vilas had an
abiding faith in himself and never quite
reached that degree of self - persuasion
that the younger bearer of his name
would ever set the world on fire with his
wisdom and sagacity. "Young Bill," as
he was called, was persistently crowded
to the rear to make room for his father.
The elder Vilas went to Wisconsin from
Vermont some time in the thirties and
settled at Madison. He was a man of a
good de?l of ability and a Democrat. Hs
uad a way of elbowing his way into power,
and of tilling the most important politi
cal offices which fell as spoils to the al
lotment of the Democrats, from County
Judge to Mayor of Madison. Whenever
there was an office which the Democrats
stood a chance of capturing the elder Vilas
was sure to be nominated. Young "Bill"
was often mentioned, but his sire was ever
the first in the race, and there was never
any room for the junior.
When the war broke out young Vilas
shouldered a musket and marched out to
fight the battles of his country. He fought
so well that when he returned home there
was ninch talkof nominating him for Gov
ernor by the Democrats. The wish, to
nominate him began to spread, and in a
short time the people were talking every
where of "William F. Vilas."
Vilas pere had the same name in
itials, and as the idea never possessed him
that young Bill could by the wildest
stretch of the imagination ever be thought
of for so eminent a position, even though
the nomination was bound to be largely
gratuitous, he quietly concluded that all
the agitation was over him. The State
convention met. The elder Vilas was
there as a delegate. Somebody got up
and placed in nomination William I.
Vilas, and there was a great deal of hur
rahing and shouting, and the band played
"Wiien Johnny Comes Marching Home."
But all this never phased the old squire in
the honest conviction that all this to-do
was over him, and in the midst of the
enthusiasm he ascended the platform and
solemnly assured the convention of his
acceptance of the honor which had been
conferred on him.
There was a painful suspense in the hall,
and everybody realized that an embarass
ing misunderstanding had been created.
For a while none of tne delegates could
find an explanation adequate to the dis
tressing situation. But finally one of the
delegates timidly rose to his feet and said :
"Squire, I reckon there is a misunder
standing here. This here nomination was
intended for young Bill."
The old squire looked painfully sur
prised and offended. He waited to the
front of the platform, and fastening his
eye firmly on the venturesome delegate,
exclaimed:
"What, young Bill for Governor? Not
much. He can wait just as well. If any
body by the name of Vilas takes the nomi
nation it's William F. Vilas Sr."
The old man said it, ruffled his brows
into a Jove-like frown, and sat down. But
the convention nominated him, and young
Bill had to wait until the magic name oi
Cleveland conjured up a new era in Demo
cratic history, which superseded the
regime of the elder Vilas.â Washington

TWO WAGNERIAN SINGERS
Concert at the Auditorium Where
Materna and Schott
Appear.
Ocdricek Makes Another HitâEn
thusiastic Applause for AH
the Performers.
The rain, which clattered outside on the
roof of the Auditorium during a great
part of the Materna-Ondricek concert last
night, had no effect in dampening the
ardor of the large audience within. An
exceptionally line musical treat was in
progress and it would have taken more
than a heavy shower to keep the musical
public from attending. None of the ad-,
niirersof Wagner that were present, and
their name was leÂ»ion, regretted baring
braved the elements to hear the concert.
In addition to Ondricek and Materna,
who are a host in themselves, the at
tractions included Anton Schott, the
famous Wagnerian tenor, Arthur Ficken
scher, pianist, and an orchestra directed
by Isidore Luckstone, with John Mar
quardt as concert-master.
Schott aroused as much enthusiasm as
either Materna or Undricek, which is say
ing a great deal for the impression he
made. He is an exceptionally big man
for a tenorand possesses a -Correspondingly j
big voice, which is turning somewhat to
barytone. This artist, who has been sing
ing in public for about twenty-live years,
has a much more distinctively German
method than that of Materna. Heaven
pave him a magnificent voice and lie uses
it jovially and lustily, eschews the vibrato
and sings with true artistic feeling.
If Ilerr Schott had had a maestro of the
old Italian school to "place" his voice in
his youth it would probably show less
signs ol wear than it does at present. It
is a magnificent organ still, but the voice
is greater than the art. Particularly is
thin apparent in the mezza voce,
which is husky, and in the apparent
Jack of power to execute the
gradual swelling and dying away on a
note, which Materna performs with fin
ished art. However, Schott, in addition
to a fine voice, has a number of effective
vocal tours de force, and all his solos were
enthusiastically applauded. His sing
ing ot the "Erlking" was lusty
and impressive, though the piano
passages were decidedly loud, Schumann's
"Two Grenadiers" was very well rendered
and the audience seemed* as if it would
like to hear Herr Schott sing "Ah Mier"
for the rest of the night, so wildly did it
applaud. The same may also be said of
Lohengrin's "Erzaelung und Abschied."
Materna by request sang her grand aria
from Wagner's "Rienzi," and sang it mag
nificently. She was obstinately encored,
and gave "Mem Bote" with such rich, full
tones and artistic feeling that people
clamored unreasonably for more, until
Materna by signs gave them to under
stand, in a very gracious way, however,
that ii was useless to persist. One of the
great features of the concert was excerpts
from the first act of "Die Walkuere," Fran
Materna being the Siglinde and Anton
Schott the Sigmund.
Franz Ondrieek's playing aroused the
wonted amount of enthusiasm. He
played the Mendelssohn concerto in Vhich
Marsick was heard here recently, and his
I verve and brilliancy were remarkable,
particularly in the final allegro niolto.
Although he did not give so many caden
zas as Marsick he aroused considerably
more demonstrations of approbation, and
the audience showed its respect for the
orchestra by hushing down attempts to
applaud during the orchestral portions of
the work. Luckstone conducted very sym
pathetically.
As an encore to the concerto Ondricek
played Schumann's "Night SonÂ«." His
"Hungarian Airs," by Ernst, were also
enthusiastically encored, as from their
brilliant execution they deserved to be.
Fickenscher proved himself to be a fairly
interesting pianist. His best work was
that done in the Liszt numbers, and in the
"Liebestot," from "Tristam and Isolde,"
which he gave as an encore and in which
he producea about the effect of an or
chestra.
The farewell concert of this gifted
combination will take place to-morrow
afternoon at the Auditorium.
Two Uats and No Head.
M. Lablache, the famous singer, was very
absent-minded. While at Naples on one
occasion. King Humbert was also there
and expressed a desire to make his ac
quaintance. On entering the antechamber
in the palace, M. Lablache found that the
gentlemen present were all personal ac
quaintances of his and asked to be allowed
to keep bis hat on as he was suffering
from a severe cold. A JHvely conversation
was cut short by the entrance of a cham
berlain announcing that the King would
receive M. Lablache at once.
In the momentary confusion the singer
forgot that he was wearing his hat, took
hold of another wiiich had been placed on
a chair near him, and went before his Ma
jesty, who, at the sight of him. burst into
a fit of uncontrollable laughter. Utterly
confused, M. Lablache asked humbly to be
informed of the reason of the King's merri
ment. "Let me ask you a question first,"
replied the King; "which is your hatâ the
one you are wearing on your head, or the
one you carry in your hand ?" "Confound
it all!" replied Labiache, joining in the
laughter; "truly, two hats are too many
for a fellow who has lost his bead."
HE WANTS PROHIBITION.
0. G. May Denounces the Cali
fornia Protective Associa
tion Project.
WOULD KILL LOCAL OPTION.
He Says There Is But One Way to
Get the Liquor Traffic Problem
Out of Politics.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ
Dear Sir: I was quite interested in an
article in a recent issue of The Call je
garding the purpose and policy of the
California Protective Association. As
"The Call speaks for all," I presume that
it will be pJad to voice the other side of tue
question also.
Its president, J. P. Edoff, tries bard to
make the California Protective Association
appear as innocent and benevolent as a
spring lamb, but some of your readers re
gard it as the most brazen and ravenous
wolf that has ever been turned loose upon
the public.
Mr. Edoft claims that the object of the
association is to secure a general censor
ship of the liquor traffic, then get the
entire whisky problem out of politics, ele
vate the traffic, secure a high grade of men
for their retail business and increase the
State revenue two or three million dollars, ,
besides other benelits too numerous to
mention. Now, let us see how Mr. Edoff
& Co. propose to accomplish all this and
just what it all means.
It is well known that under the local op
tion laws of California certain localities
have presumed to throw off the domina
tion of the liquor traffic and to abolish sa
loons. Other localities have placed a burden
some license fee and other restrictions on ta
loons which have reduced their number and
embarrassed the business. This state of affairs
has been quite unpleasant to the wholesale
trade, and so it devises a plan to "rectify 1 '
matters.
The substance of their delectable scheme is
simply this: To mass all the whisky lorces
(wholesale and retail) of the State and cen
tralize them in a single committee. Then se
cure a State law compelling every county in
the State to issue licenses to saloons. This
would do away with local option entirely and
not allow the local authorities any voice what
ever in the granting of licenses in their own
districts even.
This is the gist of the present movement by
the liquor traffic, and is but one of the many
ways by which a business that by common con
sent is'the deadliest foe of humanity seeks to
fasten itself, like the viper that it is, on a long
suffering public.
"Getting the entire whisky problem out of
politics," "elevating the traffic," increasing
the revenue, etc., are ail mere chaff and a
blind to cover up the real intent of the C. P. A.
What they actually want is to bind the op
posers of the- saloons, hand ami foot, by a State
license law, stick a saloon down in every
county, next to everybody's door and snap
their "fingers in the lace of the public with
Boss Tweed's taunt, '"What are you going to do
about it?' That's their game precisely, and
any one who takes the pains to look into their
history, or even into the article in Wednes
day's Call, can see it plainly enough.
Let OS notice Mr. X.'s inconsistency and in
sincerity. He says the object of C. IJ.1 J . A. is,
â¢â¢lirst to'get the entire whtiky problem out ot
politics," and then admits the association is in
polities, working the Legislature, the Gover
nor and the Supervisors of the whole State,
besides everything and everybody that can in
anyway be" worked to secure a law that will
crush all opposition and firmly establish their
saloons in e\ery part of the State.
That is, they go into politics to get out of
politics.
Besides this, it is notorious that the liquor
tratlic has long been, and still is, the most gi
gantic and unscrupulous corrupter of politics
that this round world has ever seen, not even
excepting the Southern Pacific Octopus; and
yet, Mr. E. has the cheek to tell us that all
| members of bis association are absolutely pro
hibited, under penalty of a #300 fine, or ex
pulsion, from engaging in politics in any way!
The Becoad object of the C. P. A. is to "ele
vate trte traffic."
That it has need of elevating even Mj. K.
tacitly confesses, for it is the most debasing,
destructive and fiendish ot any business on
earth. But how does Mr. E. propose to "ele
vate" if.' Simply by taking the last vestige
of control of the trattic away from the temper
ance people and placing it in the hands of the
whiskey men themselves.
That is the way Coll is Pelican and the South
ern Pacific want to fix up their railroad busi
ness, and the way Jay Gould and Rockefeller
liked to have matters arranged for them â with
this differenceâ that the greed of the liquor
traffic is a thousand times worse than that of
all the three others combined.
C. Pelican is said to have expressed his
patriotism and benevolence In this little epi
gram: "lam perfectly satisfied if my actions
meet the approval of one man, and that one
man is Collis P Huntington." Likewise Van
derbilt in this: "The public be d d!" It
Will require a rare genius to as fitly frame as
truthful an expression of the patriotism and
benevolence of the gang engaged in the liquor
traffic. A combination of the two given above
would make a good starter toward it.
Another of Mr. E.s ways of -'elevating
the traffic" is by keeping out of the saloon
business "those who do not bear a thoroughly
good reputation in the community in which
they intend to carry on their business."
Tne impression generally prevails, however,
that the saloons are the favorite haunts of the
bums, thieves, gamblers, adulterers and crimi
nals generally. Mr. E. knows -very well that
no person oi "thoroughly good reputation"
will associate with that class of people, much
less become the presiding demon of 'the hell
holes where they are manufactured and har
bored.
Again, the unselfish and patriotic assist
ance of the 0. P. A. is offered with
touching generosity to all the local authori
ties of the entire State to help them
root out all the saloon-keepers, "whose past
methods and present practices forfeit the right
to license privileges"! If the proposed effort
should prove fairly successful It would clean
out a large majority of the saloon-keepers and
cripple the C. P. A.'s wholesale trade. They
all know thai just as well as they know that
they are alive.
lv fact, there is no other business that has to
be so closely watched and hedged in by the
most rigorous laws and severe penalties as the
liquor traffic, and yet every now and then en
tire liquor plants are confiscated by the United
States Government on account of their rascali
ties. Many claim that the traffic is based on
dishonestyâ that there is no value returned for
the millions paid over the bars of the saloonsâ
that what is sold is a damage to the buyer and
to the community of which he is a member.
Again, Mr. E. is greatly astounded by the
refusal of the Senate Judiciary Committee to
indorse his brilliant little scheme for reform
and revenue. Perhaps the committee yielded
to their honest conviction that the industry,
intelligence, morality and general welfare of
their constituents would not be improved by
the enlargement of the drunkard and criminal
making business, represented by Mr. E., and
therefore decline to prostitute themselves aud
their high office to the traitorous work of
giving aid and comfort to the most dangerous
enemy of the commonwealth.
It may be that Mr. E. & Co. will consider
these views as too extreme and treat them
with contempt. In that case I refer them to
similar expressions by others, for whom it is
to be hoped they have some respect.
If they are willing to see their business as
others see it, let them read a few of the ex
pressions of the Supreme Court of the United
States on the subject. I will give only one,
which is of especial interest to < 'alifomia'ns, as
it was written by Stephen J. Field, a California
Judge, a Democrat, aud by no means a prohi
bition fanatic. The case also was Californian
being that of Henry Christenson of San Fran,
Cisco, November, 1890. In this decision the
Supreme Court said in speaking of excessive
drinking:
The injury, it is true, falls first iiDon him In his
health, which the habit undermines: In his morals,
which it weakens, and in self abasement which it
creates. Bui as it leads to neglect of business ana
waste of property and genpral demoralization it
affects those who are immediately connected with
and dependent upon him.
By the general concurrence of opinion of every
civilized and Christian community, there are few
sources of crime and misery to society equal to
the dramshop, where intoxicating liquors, in small
quantities to be drunk at the time, are sold indis
criminately to all parties applying.
The statistics of every S r ,ate show a greater
amount of crime and misery attributable to the
use of ardent spirits obtained at these retail liquor
saloons than to any other source. * * * There
is no inherent right in a citizen to sell intoxicating
liquors by retail: it is not a privilege of a citizen
of a suite or of a citizen of the United States. As
it is a business attended with danger to a com
muuity it may. as already raid, be entirely pro
hibited, or be permitted under such conditions as
will limit to the utmost its evils.
Mr. E. &. Co. may well make a note of the fact
, that this highest tribunal in the country, and
probably iii the world, brands his business as
one that is attended | with | danger-demoraliz
in? to health, business, morals and citizen
snfp; also that' the saloons are the unequaled
source of misery and crime; â¢ and yet Mr. E.
has the efiYontery to express surprise and in
diznation ai the refusal of the Legislature to
indorse his unscrupulous scheme to fasten this
devi fish on "he Itate that i, : might without
molestation fatten on the life blood of its cm
first to suggest. <He may thus, be " u ln dS
said to be stealing our thunder." Ah ! **dÂ«ea>
So Mr. E. you were more successful inmrni 1 !
I the Governor than you were the Legislature i
But instead of his "stealing your thunder â  as
you say, It looks ,as though^the whisky traffic
had stolen our Governor and were using him
to pull their chestnuts out of the tire. - M _ p
. Probably the Governor was in ? the same
lofty, patriotic business 'of " sealing j your
thunder" when he killed the Berkeley bill for
the protection of university s\ uden who are
away from the natural protection of their own
homes? If Governor Budd is working for you.
as you say, it is certainly a striking example
of what Judge Field calls "the demoralizing
effect of the traffic" ' , >Â,,
No, 1 Mr. E.s merry masquerade of ms
C. P. A. will not pass muster. :
The wollish teeth, claws and smell cannot be
i concealed by the lamblike covering ,of pre
tended reform and patriotism in which he
essays to parade his association. The only sat
isfactory way to reform a mad dog or a rattle
snake is to kill himâ and the only satisfactory
wav to reform or "elevate" a business that is
radically bad and deadly to everything good
is to kill it! .-- â¢ â  i
I take pleasure in commending this simple
method of: reform to the C. P. A., and have no
doubt but it would prove very efficient, and
not only "get the entire whisky problem out 01
politics," but also "elevate ' the traffic in a
manner altogether profitable and satisfactory
to the public. â¢ 0. G. May.

Two Americans were lately traveling by
rail in France in a railroad carriage, the
only other occupant of which was a quiet
old'gentleman. One of the Americans w;is
about to smoke, when the old party pointed
to a notice forbidding smoking. Somewhat
disconcerted, the smoker abandoned the
attempt, but in a few minutes more pulled
out a Bask and remarked to his companion :
"1 wonder if that darned old French skff
sicks objects to our taking a drink!" an<l
was horrified when the supposed old
French party said in the purest of Eng
lish : " I should like to join you, boys.'*â

The Rev. Joseph W. Riordan, ' S.J.,
president of Santa Clara College, lectured
on the "Catholic Confessional" before an
audience of 3000 people at Metropolitan
Hall last night. He said : â¢ â¢
Ladies and gentlemen: Three things mainly
at present disturb the peaceful slumbers
01 some of our fellow-citizens, or prospec
tive fellow-citizens, and they are the Pope, the
Jesuits and the Catholic confessional. The
rope, as we have been told again and again
â with these walls, is plotting and planning. Â»nd
unless we are all on the alert has the greatest
chance of succeeding in putting our country
and all of us into his pocket. [Laughter and
applause.]
'Ihe confessional, if we are to believe what is
Raid, is the great instrument pi the Jesuits iv
making papal recruits. As the Pope has been
60 ably defended by our'vicar-general and the
Jesuits by Father Yorke [applause] I have
thought that I "could not â¢ employ our time
better this evening than by saying a few words
about the Catholic confessional, not, indeed,
that I may convince those who will not be con
vinced, but that such as are desirous of know-
Ing the candid truth about confession may
know it.
I ask no favor in the discussion, I ask no
sympathy; I only ask fairness, American fair
ness, which considers arguments and not per-
Eons, truth and not preconceived opinions.
When I speak of the confessional I- am using
the figure of speech employed by our enemies,
which takes the container for the contained, '
the confessional for the manifestations that
take place or are supposed to take place in it.
The confessional itself is generally a very
simple contrivance. On the outside a wooden
frame with a few curtains pendant is all that
meets the eye. The inside consists of three
little compartments; a central one for the
confessor and two side ones for the penitents.
The central compartment contains a little
bench or seat. The side compartments con
tain each a kneeling stool. Aboard partition
separates penitents from confessor; but in the
partition a hole i is cut and covered with. a
screen of fine wire gauze, which with the dark
curtains prevent the penitent from being seen.
Such is the ordinary confessional as you your
selves may verify by a visit to our churches. .
But why is such an uproar raised against a
thing so simple Why such ceaseless warfare
of calumny and opprobrium? Because our
enemies realize the benefit of such an institu
tion to the church and to the world, and be
cause their hatred is such that they .would
rather deprive mankind of its benefits than
receive those benefits irom the hands of the
church. [Applause.!
Confession is indeed a fact; a living, uni
versal fact, co-ex tensive with Catholicity: a!
fact considered by Catholics as the truest test- i
of practical faith; a fact which, while in many
ways repugnant to our pride, is practiced in
youth, middle age and life's decline â nay, even
on the -bed of sickness- when- the beauties and
pleasures of life have abandoned us and the
angel of death is claiming us for its own. It is
a fact from which no rational individual or
class in the church is. exempt; the rich and
the poor, peasant and king, layman and Pope
all, without exception, are, ii" good Catholics,
practicers of coniession.
No wonder, then, that a fact so widespread
and of such importance should cause even
superficial students of our race and of its his
tory to seek its origin. Our enemies have a
ready answer. "It was called into being," they
&ay, "by the ignorant, corrupt, designing
priests of Borne, and was instituted- to fetter
consciences and to foster ignorance. -It is a
cesspool of iniquity, a spreader of corrupt
morals, a plague spot in this nineteenth cen
tury of liberty and of light."
Softly, ladies and gentlemen; we are not
seeking declamation, we are seeking proofs.
In what country, pray, did confession orig
inate? Who were the first to teach and to prac
tice confession? What are the original docu
ments on which you base your assertions? Tell
us these and you will confer a favor. "The
ignorant clergy of the Roman church intro
duced the practice, "-you tell us, and how is it
then that the learned members of thatchurch,
men who in every age for learning and enlight
enment have left the deepest impress | on their
times, and whose works even to-day astonish
us by the wealth of their erudition and the
broadness of their views; how is it, I ask, .that
such men admitted and defended and prac-"
ticed confession? How, if a cunnme and de
signing clergy, had given it birth, 'had this
cunning and designing clergy blundered
so egreglously- by binding itself by the
very same bonds by which it bound its dupes?
A cunning and designing clergy would have
said to its ignorant followers: "We who can
forgive your sins can also forgive our own,"
and yet the fact is that in the doctrine of the
Catholic church no priest, no bishop, no arch
bishop, no pope has the least power to forgive
his own link but must, like the humblest lay
man, apply for forgiveness to another priest.
The clergy have no privileges as regards con
fession; the only distinction is one of severity
toward them. â¢ They have . more means of
sanctificationâ are more guilty if they do
wrong.. Go to our churches on the eve of Rome
great festival and see the long line of penitents
at the confessional; see the priest who
from afternoon and evening nearly >up to
midnight has to sit in that stifling air, his
head oftentimes throbbing with pain, and see
â¢whether a clever, designing priesthood could
be stupid 5 enough to needlessly burden its
members with this thing. â .'â â â¢. â¢
You tell us tnat' a corrupt clergy invented
confession; if so it could and would evidently
have bo â¢surrounded it with conditions and
limitations that, while achieving its own ends,
it would exempt itself from annoyances and
inconveniences; but if you will make a calm
study of the confessional, and how the. priest
when called must go even at the risk of his life
to hear â¢ the confessions of the poor in their
hovels or in the penthouse, how he must go
when called in the night and in the tempest,
you will find that far .from seeking to avoid
annoyances it has multiplied them au hundred
fold. Have you stopped^ to consider when you
said that a corrupt priesthood has instituted
confession? Is there then no morality among
good Catholics? One would think that you were
speaking of the races of the Dark Continent in
stead of people with whom you live.. What do
you say. of a St. Vincent de Paul, with the

practice of the confessional ?- â %:â 'â  ;': â '
Calvin 1 was the first to deny the divine Insti
tution of confession, but Calvin was a little
over 1500 years too late. . Back ; through the
age* from century to century .we go and find
confession* practiced by the clergy.; and the
laity and inculcated in the writings. of the
fathers back to the days of the apostles and the
dawn of Christianity, when the Divine Master
breathed upon bis apostles and said: -"Receive
ye the Holy Ghost. Whose ; sins ye -.shall tor
give they are forgiven them; whose sins ye
shall retain they are retained." \ ;
These words are the words of Scripture.called
In question by no believer, for . they are sub
stantially the same in the ; Protestant. and in
the Catholic version." And ' hence ; though
heresies- arose about confession; there * was
never dispute about its origin. The Montan
ists and Novatians asserted that certain
grievous sins committed; after baptism could
not be forgiven by the church ; the aldenses
attributed the power of forgiveness rather to
the personal virtue of ; the priest than to the
rights his office, but neither denied teat
confession was instituted by Christ. The early
Heresies of the Nestorians andlthe Eutychians
and the great Eastern schism which cut off
millions from communion with Rome, never
â¢r a moment attributed confession to the
ignorant, designing, corrupt priesthood of
Kome," for through all the lons centuries of
separation they have clung to confession and
stUl cling to it just as we do. [Applause.]
But what is confession? Is it the going to a
Priest and giving so. much money to be re
leased from so much Bin, a kind of protective
tariff on crime, according to which by paying
scheduled prices you can be freed irom
calumny and slander and murder and sinful
indulgence? Is this Catholic confession? No.
Emphatically no. And again we ask. Can
people in our. own age and in our country be
found gullible enough to believe such stories?
Where is your vaunted education and enlight
; enment? Why not investigate for yourselves?
Confessionals are not so rare in our City;
neither are they defended by signs or pass
words, or sentinels; choose your time, choose
I your opportunity, find out ."the truth for your-
I selves and do not allow knaves or idiots to im
pose upon you. To offer money for the forgive
ness of sin would be a- crimeâ to receive it a
sacrilege. Though forgiveness comes through
j the hands oi the priest, it comes di
i rectly from God, and no amount of money,
no woTldly emolument/can compensate him
for the injury offered him by sin. But
what is Catholic confession? Is it the mere
manifestation of wrongdoing? No; it is this
but something more. It is the manifestation
of wrongdoing accompanied by sincere sorrow
for what we have done; a resolution to sin
no more; the absolution of the priest and the
acceptance of the penance imposed upon us,
with the intention of performing it.
In this description allow me to call your-at
tention to an important matter, and it is that
the church in the forgiveness of sins demands
all that any other church aemands and much
more. If we question the candid, upright
Proiestant as to how he obtains forgiveness of
his sins, he tells Ã¼b, "I confess my sins to Qod ;
I am sincerely sorry; I resolve to lead a new
life; my sins are pardoned." All that he re
quires, the church requires. The Catholic
penitent confesses to God; he must have a
. sincere, deep, universal sorrow for everything
that has been seriously wrong. This heartfelt
sorrow is the pivot of the confessional; noth
ing can replace it, nothing can atone for its
absence. Observe this* well, fur it is of the
highest importxnee in the discussion of the
confessional. But over and above what Pro
testants require for the remission of sin, the
church requires the manifestation to the con
fessor of faults if grievous.
But immediately there rises up before us a
hideous specter. "The priest is a man, like
! other men, and has. moreover, enough sins of
: his own to confess." This we hear urged as
If it were a triumphant refutation of the con
fessional. Why go to a priest if over his own
hfad hangs the sword of divine justice? That
the priests are men like other men does no;
I militate against confession; for were not the
! apostles men like other men? Were they of a
! diviner nature, or, Tather, were they not
chiefly rude, coarse fishermen, earning their
; bread on the waves of (Jaalee? Yet to them
| is the promise given, "Whose sins ye shall
forgive fhey are forgiven them; whose sins
I you shall retain they are retained^" Neither
; would the fact, if proved, that the priest has
! on his conscience as many or even more sins
than the penitent weaken our position. The
objection mixes the personal qualities of the
confessor with his official ones, and there is no
natural connection between the two. Let us
explain our meaning. Take an analogous
ease which may happen in our courts. A per
son guilty of some offense is brought before
I the Judge*. What would you say of the offender
\ if he would refuse to plead for pardon or to ac
cept mercy because the Judge on the bench Is
himself euilty of misdemeanors or crimes
againsc the law, perhaps greater than the cul
prit*'? The personal offenses of the Judge Jo
: not invalidate his official acts; and the pun
i ishment inflicted and the mercy granted are
ratified by the law, no matter how unworthy
! its minister may be, provided only that legal
| forms be observed and the decision be just.
The Judge can free others from the penalty of
the law. He cannot pass judgment on him
self and free himself, and so with the Catholic
i priest. The absolution which he dispenses to
j others will not save himself, will not lessen
the rigors of the judgment when, liite all
I other mortals, he too must stand before a bar
, which knows no favorites.
The confession is in ihe first place an institu
tion than which none is more democratic, for
it is the great leveler of mankind. It is the
soul and its Creator in the presence of his min
ister; wealth counts for nothing, social posi-
I tion counts for nothing; we have only tne
: offending creature pleading with his offended
i Maker. It teaches the sweetest of social vir
â  tues, pity, charity and forbearance, for the
; soul itself has need of all these virtues in its
' confessor. Confession is a great social purifier,
for hundreds of thousands of hearts weekly in
our glorious country go over the record of their
past lives in shame and sorrow if there be
t fault and arise in the strong purpose. of their
i wills to do right for the future.
Let us now take up the objections against
the confessional, and in doing so I shall give
them in the words of the American patriot, as
they are a fair sample of the 'opinions of such
people on tfl* confessional:
The first i-i that it is in the experience of
every man and oi every woman that if he< or
Â»he by any means comes to know the oin of
another, he or she hold that other as a slave,
to be used for any purpose, however vile. Fear
and suspicion of betrayal aFe the sources of
such slavery. This objectiou ' is said to be unÂ«
answerable.
The second is that priest and penitent are
after all flesh and bipod, and hence, owing to
the indelicacy of the communications made
in the confessional, they cannot avoid im
morality, especially as the priest is the un
married confidant of the other sex.
The thira is that the priest invades the
sanctity of the home and separates husband
and wife by being the recipient of secrets
which neither has manifested to the other. He
is the serpent of Eden, by suggestions and in
sinuations working the ruin of woman. .
And first of all let us ask: "Who is he that
takes upon himself to speak for every man
and for every woman?' We concede him in
deed the right to speak for himself and for
others whom he represents, but we object, and
object justly, to his lowering our common hu
manity to the standard of his own beastliness.
[Applause.] He may say: "If Iby any means
come to know the secret things of a woman's
heart she becomes my slave, and I can use her
for the basest purposes; and so can all who are
as vile, or as weak, or as beastly as myself";
but he has no right to plunge every mau and
woman into the mire in which he wuUows.
[Applause.] Is it the experience of every ordi
nary moral man devoted to his wife and fam
ily, that if, iv pasting along our streets, he
notices the common tvornen of the town mak
ing no secret of the vileness of their hearts, is
it his experience that he Mas no control over
his baser nature, but immediately becomes a
slave to them, as they in turn become slaves
to him?
Is such, I say, the experience of every ordi
nary moral man, or does the writer hold that
the're'are no moral men? And if it be as you
say the same between man and man then with
equal justice I say it is the same between
woman and woman; and the earnest, noble,
self-cacrificing I'rotestant matron who seeks to
lilt up the fallen and the outcast, whose heart
has been pierced by those tales of Buffering and
sorrow, stands, if your argument be unan
swerable, accused and convicted of the most
heinous crimes; she by some means has be
come possessed of the secrets of another's
heart. Perish the mind that could conceive
so base a thought. [Applause.] And are not
the secret scandals oi life daily made known
to the waola City? And does every faithless
wiTe or guilty husband as soon as known be
come the slave of all of bis or her
acquaintances? And again, are there
no upright, moral men of mature
years who, remarking the waywardness of
youth and lamenting the sad consequences in
future years, admonish, reprove, encourage?
Or must they, according to thisjunauswerable
argument, give way to- unlawful desires and
complete tne ruin already begun? Is it the
experience of every professional man, of every
lawyer and physician, that when client* in
criminal cases or patients who suffer fi'orn sin
lul excesses expose their condition, every law
yer, every physician irom that moment holds
such patieut, such client as a slave to be used,
should he so wish, for the basest purposes?
Humanity, ladies and gentlemen, may have
sunk low, but, thank God, it is not as low as
this. [Applause.] And if not the mere seli
respeci and dignity of the professional spirit
but the near ties of kinship are in question, a
brother who has learned* oi the Irailty of a
sister, a father that of a child, a son that of a
mother. Oh tell me not that it is in their ex
perience that trom that moment the nearest
and dearest to them on earth have become
their slaves in the sense of which you have
spoken. For the sake of our common naturo,
admit that your so-called unanswerable objec
tion is answerable and that it is not in the ex
perience of every man and evcy woman that
if, by any.rn.eans, his- or her secret becomes
known to another, be or she is from that mo
ment a slave, to be used for any purpose what
soever. But it ooinmon decency, pity for the
unfortunate, the professional spirit-, the ties of
kindred can possess a secret and not abuse it.
then can clso the sacred character of religion
in the heart of a Catholic priest. Moreover, in
his case the motives adduced, namely: fear
and the suspicion of betrayal ( have no place,
for the priest is bound to give up life itself
rather than betray the confidence reposed in
him. Is the fidelity oi the priesthood to the
sacredness of the seal of confession doubted ?
Listen to its enemies who advocate the passage
of a law to force the priesthood to a betrayal of
it S trust? What need of lorce if fidelity, were
not" kept ? [Applause]
The second objection is that priest and peni
tent are flesh and blood and are put into cir
cumstances too trying to- our nature owing to
ihe indelicate communications" that pass be
tween them; and this the more so, as the
priest is unmarried, l have yet, ladk-s and
gentlemen, to learn that personal purity de
pends upon the fact of being married or un
married, and 1 cannot subscribe to the impli
cation that as soon as your sons have reached
tiiefullnessof manhood and your daughters the
fuliness of womanhood that they must perforce
either xaarry immediately or resort to uaaatu

politan liull.

ral crimes. They are celibates in thestrictest
sense of the word, and, though unmarried, are
pure; if they can keep themselves pure iv
mind and in body for one year or two or more
before marriage you draw, the line arbitrarily
when you fix "it at any determined age.
You, personally, may not have been pure even
in the years of childhood ; but again I ask you.
why foice your own viloness upou-us as a stan
dard of humanity? [Applause.] Some unmar
ried persons are at times false to the duties of
personal virtue; some married persons are at
times faithless to. their marriage vows; but in
neither case is unfaithfulness due to the guilty
oue, but to unfortunate circumstances or weak
ness of the will. You sneer at the priest as a
confidant of the other sex, but your 6neer loses
its sting when we consider the style of mani
festation used in the confessional. The word
confidant has ah air of levity about it. It sug
gests the spiciness of scandal, the minuteness
of detail which no confessor could permit. The
confession of the mere nature oi criminal er
eeuea and the number of times made to a phy
sician would not, I think, constitute him a
confidant of his patient. Something more Is
required to lower his profession to such a level.
But the question recurs again and again, what
about the indelicacy of the confessional? And
again I ask, what about the indelicacy of the
various professions? And allow me to call
your attention to a great sophism, viz.: that
the manifestation of indelicate matters is
necessarily indelicate. The language of the
confessional is and must be delicate, for It is
the language of one who Is heartily sorry for
sin, and such language in certainly not calcu
lated to be indelicate or to lead others to imi
tation. But what am I sayitig? What am I
answering? Have you remarked the insulting
insinuation contained in the objection that
every man, every woman. that goestoconfession
has such a secret in his or h.er heart? Let us
put the objection clearer and say, '"I object to
my wile, my mother, my sister, my daughter,
going to confessitfii, because she would confess
to the priest the low, bnse desires which she has
harbored, the mean, immoral actions which
she has committed." Is this their idea of
womanhood? This their idea of those whom
they should cherish most? If they hold that
these are the pure creatures that as husbands,
fathers, brothers and sons they ought to hold
them, they cannot object to confession, for
there is r.o indelicacy for them to confess. If
they object to confession, then I leave .to your
judgment what we should trunk of those
who in the semblance of humanity are worse
than brutes. . [Applause.]
The third objection, that the priest invades
fhe sanctity of the home and separates hus
band and wife, falls to the ground for the same
reason that the others fell. It suuposes that
every husband, every wife, that goes to con
fession has some secret* infidelity to confess.
Tiie priest invades tne sanctity oT home!
Where is the sanedty of home according to the
objection? If unfaithfulness has taken posses
sion of the heart of one or of the hearts of boih
then has the angel of purity and of peace fled
from that hearthstone, and their criminal pas
sions and not the priest have divided them.
And if in penitence and in sorrow the guilty
party or parties should come to the priest as to
a friend for light and consolation and en
couragement to do better, what would you
have him do?
What would you, as a friend, do if the guilty
ono came to you in like circumstances?
Would you run to the other party and manifest
all? Or would you not rather bury the secret
in your breast apd strive to bridge owr the
chasm separating heart from heart? Could
any one in fairnesssay that you were separat
ing husband and wife because you concealed
what could bring about only discord and
8 trove to remove its cause, or would you
rather deserve the benedictions of your fellow
men that you had held another family to
gether? And if you deserve a benediction why
not a priest, if he perform alike Kindly action?
But, as 1 have said, the very foundation of the
objection is the universal moral corruption of
hearts, and bears, like its fellows, the stamp of
a low, mean mind.
Oh, you who have lost faith in the chastity of
woman, go to the confessional to recover it;
admire, as the confessor so often admires, the
purity of souls; and -know that if confidence
in womanly chastity, which, God- forbid,
should abandon all else, there-will still be one
to raise his voice iv defense of womanhood, iv
defense of the mothers and wives and sisters
and daughters of the very maligners of the
confessional, and that one will De the "man of
the. confessional." [Applause.]
Away back as far as 1313 a test case of the
priest and the law was made in the State of
New York. A person who stole a sum of
money went to confession, and of course could
not receive absolution without making resti
tution to the owner. He did so through his
confessor, Father Kohlman. The matter was
brought up in the criminal court and Father
Kohlman was put on trial, for the reason that
he who knows the name of a thief and will not
divulge it is subject to the same penalty as the
thief himself. The trial took place and the
ease was dismissed, the Judges deciding that
"As the laws of the United States permit the
free exercise of religion it is not lawful to
lorce a Catholic priest to do what is forbidden
by his faith."
The silence of the priest, therefore, is not
against the laws of our country, but in accord
ance with th^rn. Neither is his case a solitary
one in law. No one is obliged to incriminate
himself, and he is excused from answering ques
tions when, by answering, he would so incrimi
nate himself. The wife is not obliged to testify
against her husband nor the husband against
his wife; the law respects the union of their
hearts and the secret of either, if secret there
be, is safe in the other's keepiug.
If the confessional were indeed a defense of
evil, Â«, shield for evil, an encouragement of
evil, its action would be anti-social, and as
such to be repressed, but when it has for Its
direct and only object the withdrawing of the
heart from evil, the stirring up of sorrow, the
amendmenUof life, the confessional becomes a
real boon- to society. And is not the amendment
of the offender one of the chief aims of our
criminal law?
The Catholic confessional is the greatest in
centive of virtue, the greatest impediment to
vice. How many there are who are kept from
the noble ways of virtue on accountof troubles
and anxieties of soul. They know that they
have pinned, but cannot satisfy themselves of
the sufliciency of their sorrow: and bending
beneath a load that they consider above their
strength, not-knowing whither to turn, they
lay down their burden before their time and
pass away too often suicides. In the comfort
and encouragement of the confessional, hope
would have budded forth and blossomed, and
the sympathy of a father would have helped
to bring back and strengthen the erring soul.
That the manifestation of our sins to a tellow
mortal is an impediment to other sins goes
without saying. ' We easily lose sight oi- the
presence of. our Maker and add sin to sin re
gardless of that presence.
But confession is the means by which the
priests rule In politics! [Laughter.] Again,
let us study. facts. Examine the men who are
prominent in politics and tell me how many of
them enter the confessional. Enter into the
lives of those who do no.t go to confession and
you will find that the faster they got into poll
tics the faster they got out of the confessional,
because political methods and trie purity of
the gospel are oftentimes at variance. 1 do
not say that a politician cannot be a politician
and a good Catholic, but I do say that it takes
nerve and backbone to be "bolh. [Laughter.]
Politicians are too often guided by principles
of monetary expediency, rather than by the I
eternal principles of justice: they are inclined
to look after the sack Tather than the public
welfare; and knowing that reparation is duo
from them, tiad thÂ»t restitution must be made
by them before receiving aDsolution, unwill
ing to give up their sin, they stay awey from
confession. You make a great mistake when
you imagine that the priest likes to see Catho
lics mixed up too deeply in politics, for apos
tasy from the faith is but too often to be
, tracefl to political offices and to the crooked
roads traveled to obtain them. The confes
sional knows no politics, knows no parties; it
Knows only the laws of justice.
The confessional is a political machine! Try
it. There arc Catholics of all parties, not as
Catholics, but as citizens. There is among us
no Catholic party, as such, nor will there ever
be, unless persecution and the violation of our
constitutional rights force such a course upon
us, and then it will not be the confessional, but
the ostracism of bigotry and of tyranny that
will bring the thine about. For over two years
have Catholics been persecuted politically.
What has been their answer ? "Combine, Cath
.olics. to put down Protestants"; "Vote for none
"but a Catholicâne ver. Their cry has been,
"Our constitution now and forever, which
knows no distinction of creeds in public of
licesâvote for the right man. in the right
place." It this be the effect of the coniessional
1 say, "God bless the Confessional." [Applause.]
Such, therefore, is. the Catholic confessional,
instituted by the Savior of mankind for the
welfare of the individual and of the race. It
requires such manifestations only as even

polite society allows and far less than profes
sional life may require; it bears with it a heart
felt sorrow for the past, a firm resolve for the
future Calumniated indeed as if for so much
money you could be freed from so much
sin; slandered as if it were a means of moral
corruption; it stands before the world and in
vttes" dispassionate investigation, for it con
tains all the elements that any other form of
religion requires for the remission of sin and
demands much more. But this is its glory, as
it is the glory of the grand old church that
practices it, that the more you study it the
more you admire it. [Prolonged applause.]
IT CAME PROM KANSAS.
The Queer Petition Which Wai Pre
sented in the Senate Recently.
There have been more crank petitions
presented to Congress this session than in
any previous sitting of Congress for years,
says the Washington Post. In the Senate
especially the constitutional right of peti
tion appears to have been abused to a
great extent by Senators, who insist upon
reading them in full, and printing the
text of petitions and memorials of all
kinds and sorts in the Record. ThÂ« latest
contribution of this character was laid
before the Senate by Peffer of Kansas
yesterday morning, and it will, owing to
thfe fact that the Senator insisted upon
reading it, appear in full in to-day's
Record. It comes from General Hugh
Cameron of Lawrence, Kans., and is as
follows:
Your petitioner, the- undersigned, respect
fully asks your honorable bodies to make the
sth day of April a National holiday.it being
the day on which the King of the Jews, whom
Pontius Pilate caused to De crucified, April 3,
A. D. 33, achieved his splendid victory over
the grave.
The King of the Jews has always been the
true friend of the United States ot America.
He was with Washington and his companions
during their great struggle for independence,
and was also with the Union army through the
entire war to maintain that independence'
with union and liberty.
Your petitioner has an abiding faith that
your honorable bodies will cheerfully grant
his request, as well on your own account as
that of the multitude of his faithful follower?,
comprising all the Industrious poor people
(Goi's chosen people), many of whom are now
prayerfully waiting for fhe second coming of
said King, which, it is claimed, will be to the
United States of America.
Unquestionably, this King has done more to
establish and maintain free government on
this continent, ani to make the United States
of America a respectable Nation than any other
King; and, so we, as individuals and as a
Nation, ought not to be ashamed, with frank
ness and alacrity, to acknowledge that we owe
him a debt of gratitude which we will never
be able to fully liquidate.
For all these and many other obvious reasons
the undersigned hopes your honorable bodies
will, without delay, make resurrection day a
National holiday, for which we will coatinu
ally pray. .

DONE BY A POCKET COMB
A New Discovery of How to
Beat the Public Tele
phone.
IT IS EXPLAINED BY A PEDDLER
Directors of the Company Worried
Over the Sudden Decline
in Receipts.
The directors of the telephone company
are worrying over the sudden decrease in
the receipts from the public telephone with
the drop-a-nickel-in-the-slot attachment.
When this device was first foisted upon
the community it at once became popular
with hotels, restaurants, saloons, drug
stores and other places where iccommoda
tions to the public were formerly at par,
and' added many a nickel to the corpora
tion whose creation it is.
Some time ago John I. Sabin became
aware of the fact that his pet machine was
being tampered with, and that its useful
ness as a money-getter for his company
had been greatly impaired. This fact was
revealed to him through the great decline
in the earnings of the slot machine, and
he accordingly set his electrical engineers
and others about the task of ascertaining
the cause.
The agents of the company were long
unable to "drop onto" the scheme by
which the concern was euchred out of
the elusive nickel, but eventually their ef
forts were rewarded. They learned that it
was simply a little pocket-comb that had
caused the decrease in the earnings of the
telephone and created consternation
among the officials of the company.
"I'll show yon how it is done," said the
vender of pocket combs in ail uptown
restaurant. "It will save you many a
nickel. The comb only costs yon 5 cents
in the first place and you can beat the tele
phone with it every time. There is no dif
ficulty about it. It's the simplest kind of
a game. Talk about tapping the wire,
beating the slot machines or the street rail
way company on its transfer system, none
of them are to be compared with this new
discovery in point of simplicity and per
fectionâ"
And after calling up central the manip
ulator of the comb^-wben told to drop his
nickel â gave a dextrous stroke across the
rim of the transmitter, at tne same time
pressing the button, and the job was. done.
"It doesn't need an expert to do this
trick," continued the comb man, "and
every one that I have explained it to is
now playing the same graft. The beauty
of the scheme is that the telephone people
are unable to detect the operator unless
they catch him in the act. Is the game
very generally played? Well, I gueas.
Why, it is impossible for the peddlers to
supply the demand for combs since the
wrinkle became known."
SANTA ROSA'S FAIR ISLE
New and Sensational Elements
in the A. P. More
Estate.
Admitted in Depositions That Valu
able Papers Were Taken From
Deceased's Room.
The celebrated Santa Rosa Island case
has assumed a new phase and the grossest
fraud is about to be exploited by the attor
neys.
For several days past Messrs. Gunnison,
Booth and Barnett and J. B. Mhoon have
been taking depositions in the $30,000 suit
brought against the estate of A. P. More
by M. Watson, and many startling revela
tions have been made.
In those depositions it Us admitted by
Watson and John F. More, brother of A.
P. More, deceased, who owned Santa
Rosa Island, that they went to his apart
ments in the Palace Hotel and-took certain
papers.
Among those papers the attorneys say
they have reason to believe was the last
will of the island's owner. Said Mr.
Mhoon: "They admit abstracting certain
papers, and it is more. than probable a will
was among them. When it is understood
that A. P. More was supposed to have
died intestate, and that his brother, J. F.
k More, secured letters ol administration ,
in the face of great opposition from fifteen
of the heirs, thig suspicion is given much
color.
"The island includes 62,000 acres, several
thousand head of sheep and extensive im
provements. Its value is nearly $1,000,000.
After A. P. More, the owner, wasacquitted
of the charge of murder fur shouting a
Chinaman in 1888 he went to Chicago and
left the island in the hands of his brother,
John F. More. The latter continued in
the management and control of the prop
erty up to the time of his brother's death,
when as administrator his executive
authority was more exclusive.
"After securing letters of administra
tion," continued Mr. Mhoon, "John pre
sented a claim for $100,000. He was
granted about $60,000. While prosecuting
his claim Watson was his most important
witness. And in turn More became Wat
son's chief reliance in his first suit for
$30,000. The principal item in Watson's
$30,000 daim was a charge of $18,000 for
advice. He advised Mr. More not to sell
a certain lot of wool."
In the depositions taken by Messrs.
Gunnison, Booth and Bartnett yesterday,
John F. More corroborated the statement
of Watson concerning the taking of papers
from A. P. More's rooms at the Palace.
'"It is a rank case of fraud," said Mr.
Bartnett last night, "and the evidence ob
tained in the depositions gives promise of
great sensational developments in the near
future. You ace, there is $900,000 and a
little Pacific principality at stake."
ABOUT COEES.
The Sort of Boots That Brings Them On
and How to Get Kid of Them.
A chiropodist says: 4 'one of the most
popular corn-plasters is made in Baltimore,
but not long ago the manufacturer brought
his wife over to me to be treated for corns.
I asked him why he did not try to (Jure her
himself. He told me that his plasters were
very good things to sell to druggists, but
that they did not seem to benefit his wife in
the slightest. It is my experience that at
least 80 per cent of people suffer more or
less from corns. Washington is one of the
worst cities in the country in this line. It
is on account of the asphalt streets, I
think. At any rate, people who come
from other cities often develop some form
of foot trouble after they have been here
awhile."
"Who are your best customers?"
"Women always. They will persist in
wearing high heela and shoes that are too
short, for them. Now, a short shoe is much
worse than a shoe that is too narrow, for,
as the average person is not blessed with
high insteps, the toes are forced down
against the- end of the shoe, and either
corns or deformities of the joints result.
In my opinion Southern people have the
besj ieet. The reason of it is that they are
great horseback rider?. Holding one's feet
in the stirrups resuits in making high in
steps, and high insteps prevent the feet
from being forced down into the end of the
shoes. It is true that Southern women
like to Wâ¬Â£T high heels and tight shoes, but
the effect is not nearly as bad on them as
it is on Northern women with their flatter
insteps.
"Yes; bicycling is just ebout as good for
the feet as is .horseback-riding. The foot
gets freer play than it does in walking, a"nd
if the shoes are well made and properly fit
ted it lias a tendency to mane the feet
archeii and graceful. 1 firmly believe that
the fact that to many smail children are
now riding tiie wheel is certain to result in
better-shaped and healthier feet in .th-e
corning generation.' Parents really ought
to pay more attention to the condition of
their children's feet. They ought to take
more care about their shoes, seeing that
they fit properly and do not rub, or are not
too'loose. That parents do not, as a rule,
exercise such care is shown by the number
of chi'dren from 2 to 5 years of age who are
brought to me to be treated for corns and
bunions." â Washington Star.
Poison rings during the twelfth, thir
teenth and fourteenth centuries were -very
' common in Italy. The bezel of the ring
was a hollow cup, opened by a spring, and
designed to coiitain a quantity of poison,
to be used eitherfor suicide or murder.

POINTS OF SUPERIORITY.
ELECTRIC POWER.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
generates double the power of any other
Electric Belt made. The arrangement of
the metals is upon the most approved
scientific basis; the Voltaic piles, being
quadruple, so as to brin? out a steady,
powerful current; perfectly insulated, so
that, different from all other belts, the full
force of the current is conducted into the
weakened system in a continuous", life-
giving stream. It gives tone and energy
to the nervous system and all its depend-
ent organs. As "Electricity is life Dr.
Sanden'd Electric Belt is the modern life-
giver.
DURABILITY.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT is
positively guaranteed for one year. Every
Belt broken or by any circumstance,
whether the fault of the belt or the wearer,
having lost its curative powers of elec-
tricity within one year, is replaced with a
new one at no expense to the wearer. If
Dr. Sanden's Belt was twice its present
cost it would still be cheap, as no other ap-
pliance made tan be sold with this
guarantee.
CONVENIENCE.
DR. SANDEN'B ELECTRIC BELT is
applied on retiring at night and worn until
time of arising in morning. No care or
trouble 13 incurred in its use; no time is
wasted in using it, as itf soothing,
strengthening current absorbs- into the
weakened organs while you sleep. Benefi-
cial results are noticed in one night's use,
and the sleep is made sound and refreshing.
It quiets the nerves and builds up the weak
parts in a^atural, humane manner.

WAITS FOR HIS MASTER
A Little Dog's Lonely Vigil at
the City Receiving Hos
pital.
WANTED TO DEFEND HIS BODY.
Dunwald Has a Fractured Skull, but
His Canine Friend Will Not
Desert Him.
A little curly black dog, sans beauty,
sans pedigree, wanders disconsolately
| about the new City Hall, waiting patiently
j for his master, who lies seriously injured
1 on a cot within the Receiving Hospital,
1 furnishing a most touching illustration of
canine devotion to man.
On Tuesday last a call from Beach and
Powell streets took the patrol wagon to
that locality, and the policeman in charga
found an injured man, who had been
struck down in a quarrel, whose uncon
scious body was guarded by a little biack
dog.
At first the little fellow wa3 inclined to
resent any interferance with his master's
body, but when he saw that the police
were on a friendly errand he offered no
resistance, and trotted behind the wagon
while it conveyed his master to the Re
ceiving Hospital. There it was found that
the man was Henry Dunwald, and that
Ins skull had been fractured by a blow
from a hatchet.
The dog attempted to follow the man's
inanimate farm as it was carrind into* the
hospital, but being prevented, he lay down
on the pavement outside and patiently
awaited his master's return from within
the gloomy walls. Night came on, and
still he kept up his vigil, and when day
light again appealed he was found close to
the door turning appealing eyes to all who
appeared, as if asking for news of his
master. Another day passed, and still he
refused to leave, and then Matron Ed
monds of the hospital took compassion on
him and cave him â¢ food and water, which
he consumed as though tarnished.
The little fellow was in his accustomed
place yesterday morning, still waiting for
the master who tossed on a bed of pain
within. An unsympathetic gardener, who
perhaps did not know the reason of his
lonely vigil, caught him walking across a
flower-bed near the Receiving Hospital
door, and drove him away with a stick.
After that he contented himself with
standing in the street and gazing wistfully
at the hospital portals or running about
the corridors of the hall, searching dili
gently and patiently for the master.
Dr. Sherwood of the hospital found
him in the street yesterday and took him
to a neighboring restaurant, where he was
given ail he would eat. Where he sleeps
no one knows, but hardly an hour passes
during the daylight hours that he does
not trot around to the City Hall avenue
side of the hall and sit for awhile watch
ing the hospital entrance:
In life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is slill his master's own,
\Vi:<> labors, iight3, lives, breathes for him alone.
In the meantime Dunwald lies in a pre
carious condition in the hospital, and may
remain there for days before he can be
moved to nis home.
The balloon by means of which M. An
dree, the Swedish engineer, will endeavor
to reach the North l'oie will be capable o!
carrying three persons, four months' pro
visions, a sledge and a sailing-boat, and
will be sufficiently gas-tight to hover in
the air for thirty aays. Â
You Can Regulate Its Power.
DR. SANDEN'B ELECTRIC BELT is cojfa
structed with a patent regulator. No othet
Electric Belt has it. When you have placed
the Belt on the body and feel the powerful cup-
rent penetrating y&ur system you adjust its
I strength by turning to right or left a small
screw attachment, 'setting the current at any
desired force, and you cau then eujoy a restful,
I quiet sleep without being awakened in thÂ«
middle of the night by a sensation whicli
i makes you Imagine you are being electrocuted.
Those who have used the old-style belts knoir
what this is, and hundreds who have ditÂ«
carded them and are now being peacefully re-
! stored to health and strength by Dr. Sanden'i
Klectric Belt are testifying to the value of tha
::i;vv method. If you don't want to b* burned
. to death in your sleep use Dr. S&ndsn'*,
$5000 REWARD.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT gives into
the body a genuine current of electricity for
6everal hour* at a time. reward will be
paid for one of these Belts, which will not
generate a current which is perceptible to tha
wearer immediately after charging and applÂ».
ing to the body. ** r
IT CURES.
DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT is credited
with some three thousand cures on the Pacifit
Coast alone during the past ten years. Cures
in fact. Cures oi men who are manly enough
to proclaim to the world their recovery oi man-
hood and the means of getting it. Dr. San-
den's Electric Belt is no experiment, and the
names and addresses of hundreds of grateful
citizens of this State can.be found in the little
book, "Three Classes of Men," which gives full
information, a scientific diagnosis of all cases
which can be cured by electricity, and oticaa.

at the Stock Exchange, while extremely dull, was
characterized by a firmer tone than- on any

of late, were' almost entirely professional, but
among speculators the feeling was rather more
bullish owing to the improving railway traffic re
turns of Western roads. . The advance in the
posted rates of sterling exchange had very little
influence on the markets ror securities, partly for
the reason that the price of -cold bars was ad- :
vanced by the assay office from l-16th to 3-16ths |

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 26.â Wheat traders
failed to discover anything very encouraging in
the situation this morning and, as a consequence,
prices at the opening were at a discount from those
recorded at. the close yesterday. The Cincinnati
Price Current which usually carries some weight
in the market was interpreted bearlshly this morn-
Ing. Liverpool failed to. respond 'o the Improve
ment of yesterday in American markets and that
too had a part in defining the tone and direction of
prices. Northwestern receipts were # good at 476
cars, against t.78 last Thursday and 240ayear aao.
Chicago received 1 6 cars and Inspected out 85,676
bushels. Trade was slow most of the session, now
and then becoming enlivened,' but in a majority of
instances appearing almost stagnant. Around the
middle of the session prices firmed up, liberal ex
port clearances, 4Â»6.a10 bushels, and talk of
Armour buying exercising a favorable influence.
Closing: Paris cables were unchanged- to higher.
Berlin higher and Antwerp lower for California but
unchanged for Amercian spring wheat. May wheat
orened'from 6'2%c.i0 6VS4C, sold between 62 V&@
61Â£/sc and 634'gc, closing m 43y a Vie higher than
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 16
cars. â¢ . .
CORNâ This market differed in no respect from
what it has recently been., Sympathy with wheat
governed it and business moved along in a listless
fashion. Liverpool raoles were quiet and - un
changed. Receipts, 170 cars, were 60 less thun

vailed in produce at the opening to-day. A gain of

recovery before the close, final prices being a shade
under yesterday for May pork and May lard and
unchanged from yesterday tor May ribs.

â weeks the year's Wool from Kern County has been '
coming : forward ' freely, and ;up to : d-ate . tor the
month of March the total receipts from all quarters
foot up about 2500 bags, which includes something
likis 260 bags from Nevada. -Last year we had re
ceived for the same ; time â  over 9000 bags. Shear
ing commenced later this year, which accounts to
a Targe extent for the lighter receipts of Wool thus
far; then again ; there are not so many sheep in
Kern County this year S3 last, and the clip of the
county will not be so large by at least one-fourth.
As to trading in Wool there is none, either here or
in the country, and we .must. say the market out
look is anything but encouraging. . Stocks at all
seaboard points are. larger than at any former
time and dealers report no probability of any early
activity. . Eastern '. manufacturers In â¢ both . Wool
and cotton seem to be very much discouraged, and
though domestic Wools are 20% to 30% lower than
foreign stock yet they are taking no orders and the,
season of their greatest activity is rapidly passing
away without results. : No sales.". We quote Fall

TO NAME A CONGRESSMAN
What a Prospective Delegate in
the Second Ward Was
Told.
DENIALS OF COMMITTEEMEN.
Much Uncertainty Among the Two
Wings of Alameda County
Republicans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
COS Broadway, Marcn 26. \
A mild sensation was created to-day
when it became known that a man -who
had been asked to serve as a delegate to
the State Convention had been told that
the delegation would undoubtedly nom
inate a candidate for Congress.
Some of the ward ciubs, among them
the Fifth, have named committees for the
purpose of conferring and trying to formu
late a plan that will succeed in npsetting
the contemplated selection of delegates by
the Aiameda committeemen of the Third
District Congressional Committee.
One of the committeemen from the Fifth
Ward said to-day : "Jt is very clear that
the delegates to the coming convention in
tend to foist a candidate for Congress upon
us. We have been told that the ending of
the call, 'And for such other business, etc.,'
is merely formal and does not possess any
significance. We are accustomed to just
such political tactics in Alameda County,
and we arc prepared for them. A report
has iust reached me that a prominent
Republican in the Second Ward
has been approached and asked to
serve as a delegate. He was told
that it would be a part of his duty to help
in nominating a Congressman. This ef
fectually disposes of any doubt as to the
intentions of the committee of six who are
intending to run the Republican party of
this county during the coming campaign,
if we will permit them.
"Within the next few days the commit
tee appointed by the ward clubs will meet,
and it is the prevalent opinion that prima
ries may be held. It primaries are not de
cided upon the clubs will take no part in
the naming of delegates, and will ieavetbe
committee of six to work out their own
destruction in their own way.'
The Alameda committeemen of the
Third District deny that they have any
idea or right to interfere in the nomina
tion of a Congressman.
Committeeman Ingler says that it is
well understood among the members of
the committee that tho Sacramento con
vention was called for the sole purpose of
nominating delegates to the National Con
vention at St. Louis. "I am in favor,"
said Mr. Ingler to-day, "of giving the Re
publican? of this district full opportunity
to select their members of the convention
that shali nominate a Congressman, at
primaries to be called in accordance with
law. 1 '
Committeeman Morrison says that the
clause "and for such other business as may
come before this convention" applies tto
the State Convention only.
E. K. Taylor of Aiameda also says that
tho fear that the delegates to Sacramento
will se'ect a Congressman is without foun
dation.
THJEKK IS >*O TROUBLE.
Blrs. AVolfenden Kxplains the Affairs of
the Y. W. C. A. Home.
OAKLAND,Cai... March 26.â The trouble
in the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion Home is said to be the result of some
young ladies who prefer different rules to
those provided by a Christian home,
Mrs. Wolfenden, the secretary, was seen
at the home to-day. She said: "This is
neither a reformatory nor prison. All per
sons coming here can come or go as they
please, and if dissatisfied may go to the
matron, as to a motuer, and ask anything
within reason and get it. If they don't
like their treatment they can go some
where else. We never press them for their
board Dill and always assist those out of
employment to get Work. Our rules are
very simple. Lights in the parlors are
put out at 10 o'clock, but the girls can
keep their lights burning all night in their
own rooms if they so desire. The table is
always spoken of "as exceedingly good by
all who drop in to lunch.
"All of this trouble has come from out
siders who left some time ago and are
trying to get the matron out of her posi
tion. She has always given excellent sat
isfaction and will be retained. Of course
we regret to have the good name of the
institution assailed, but as it is only three
of the girls who are not in the home at
present I think it won't hurt much."
Another Electric Road.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â The fol
lowing letter was received to-day by those
seeking a bonus for the California Railway
Company, better known as the Laundry
Farm road :
Metsrs. Benham and Thomasâ Gentlemen: The
lack of interest shown by the property-owners
along our line in the proposed change from
steam to electricity has been considered by us.
Under the circumstances we have decided
not to accet>t the contributions, and you will
please return the contracts already secured to
the subscribers.
In compliance with your request and as a
recognition of your services we will supple
ment our present system with electricity, but
without restrictions as to amount of fare, num
ber of cars and when or how they will be run.
Yours truly, Wiluam Rank.
Work will begin upon the line as soon as
the weather will permit.
No Private Boxes.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â Chief of
Police Lloyd has asked the License Com
mittee of the City Council to recommend
an ordinance prohibiting the private
boxes in restaurants. No definite action
has been taken yet, but it is suggested
that a railing three or four feet high would
be sufficient. This is the result of the
charges against some all-night restaurants
a short time ago.
Fainting and Painters.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â J. H. E.
Partington, the artist, will lecture before
the Starr King Fraternity Friday evening

ANOTHER STEP.
Volumes of Water-Front Cage Appeal
Matter Go to the Supreme
Court.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â Harvey
Brown, representing the Oakland Water
.Front Company, to-day submitted an en
grossed statement, upon a motion for a
new trial iD the Superior Court, in the case
of Oakland vs. the Oakland Water Front
Company. It was in two large volumes
consisting of 2000 printed pages, with a
third volume of maps. The latter was eight
inches thick and contained twenty-eight
maps.
The statements included every docu
ment, deed, ordinance or legislative act
connected with the water-front transac
tions involved in this suit. The cost of
the printing of this work was $1380, and
was considered of so much importance by
the city of Oakland that 100 copies were
purchased at a cost of $4 per volume.
Judge OgdÂ«n ended the case, as far as
the Superior Court of Alameda County Ifl
concerned, by promptly overruling the
motion. The customary exception was
taken by the defendant. The case now
goes to the Supreme Court of the State
and will come up in July, when it is ex
pected that the case brought by ex-Attor
ney-General Hart and the Davie-Dameron
suit will come before the court for final
adjustment. The city also has an appeal
upon this same case upon a few points in
wnich the decision was adverse to the
city's interests.

Public Buildings of the lower House of
.Congress. Alameda, therefore, feels quite
elated on the chances of the appropriation
being put through and the building being
erected.
The statement that Congressman Hil
born made before -the Congressional com
mittee, as forwarded to a local paper by
Mr. Boatman, is as follows:
The city of Alameda is located on a peninsula
five miles long and one mile wide, opposite
San Francisco, with the San Francisco Bay on
one side and the Oakland Estuary on the other.
It is regarded as one of the most beautiful
find perfectly arranged cities of its class in the
United states. There are more than fifty miles
of macadamized streets and seventy-live miles
of patent stone sidewalks.
On account of the singular beauty of its lo
cation, its magnificent climate and wealth of
flowers, Alameda is the favorite residence
spot of San Francisco business and professional
men, who have adorned it with sightly reÂ»i
dences and captivating lawns.
In 1870 the population of Alameda was 1557 ;
in 1880, 5708; in 1890, 11,165, and Â«nee that
time there has been an unprecedented in
crease owing to the public spirit that has been
manifested, so that at the present time, as
shown by the school census and other reliable
sources, there can be no less than 17,000 in
habitants.
Alameda has a complete system of sewerage
constructed on the Wareing plan, which per
mits of automatic flushing of the pipes as often
as three and four limes every twenty-four
hours, thus keeping them thoroughly cleansed
of all sediment and deceyed matter.
The assessed valuation of all taxable prop
erty, as shown by the official returns, exceeas
the sum of $12,000,000.
The city nas five graded public schools of
eight rooms each, and a high school attended
Dy over 500 pupils.
The valuation of the public school property
amounts to Â£325,000.
A very desirable site Is being reserved for a
free library, on which it is intended at an
early date to erect a building worth $25,000.
The city has an artesian water system that
cost $500,000 and an inexhaustible supply of
pure, clear water.
Alameda has a paid fire department of five
| companies, splendidly housed and well
equipped.
A new City Hall has recently been erected at
a cost of $5*0.000 on a lot valued on a low es
timate at $40,000.
The city owns its electric light service, em
bracing both the arc and incandescent sys
tems.
Two lines of the steam railroads enter and
traverse the entire length of the city, connect
ing with two ferry lines, giving excellent ferry
service to San Francisco.
Three daily papers are published in Ala
meda, having large circulations and much in
fluence.
The principal industries embrace ship-build
ing and petroleum and borax refining.
The gross receipts of the Alameda postoffice
for the fiscal year ended June 30. 1895, were
$16,516 63. the amount paid for rent $392 and
the net receipts were $5855 17.

H. K. Field la Hurt Again.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 26.-H. K.
Field of 1717 Paru street, who had been
laid up for three months with a broken
leg, was out on crutches on Tuesday even
ing for the first time, and in attempting
to walk out to the Enciual Yacht Club's
house fell by the slipping of one of his
crutches and again injured the broken
member. The leg was not broken again,
but was so bedly wrenched that it will lay
him up some ten days longer.
Mr. Wheeler Kesigns.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 26.â L.
Wheeler, who has been ttfe superintendent
of the Alameda Electric Railway since it
first began operations, will shortly resign,
going East for a time. The cause of his
resignation is not given, but is understood
50 be criticism on the part of stockholders
at the annual meeting about accidents on
I the line.
It is computed that there are in London
some 50,000 families in such a miserable
plight that each family lias only one room
to live in.

They Can Snuff Defeat in

Oakland's Policemen Who Will Compete With Members of the San Francisco Force.
[From photogrnph by Novelty Fo'.o Co.]
with Winchester rifles will take their last I
practice shoot at Shell Mound to-morrow. }
For the past month the ranges at Shell j
Mound have been liberally patronized by j
the Oakland men, and they will certainly j
represent the best that the local force can j
do with the rifle when they meet their op- j
ponents from across the bay.
The Oakland team consists of: Nick ;
Williams, D. W. Swain, J. P. Sill, J. M.
Cockerton, Frank Schrader, C. E. Clarke, |
W. Kinesbury, L. E. Andrews, J. J. Mc-
Carthy, H. C. Arnest. J. P. Stahl and W. j
F. Peterson will be taken in case of acci
dent to any. of the chosen shooter?.
Much interest has been taken in the
match, Bad it is certain that the winning
team will have to do some fine shooting.
Williams, Swain and Andrews are crack
shots; but no one is doing any prelim
inary horn-tooting, for they realize that I
the men across the bay are not novices at
shooting.
The superstitious members of the local
force predict defeat because when the men
grouped this afternoon for their photo
graphs to be taken for The Call* there !
were thirteen in the group. Prison-keeper j
Swain is an old sailor, and consequently
superstitious. He it was who declared
that the word "topgallantsail" was spelled j
with a double "1" in the middle because
it would have been composed of thirteen
letters without it. Officer Sill, another
member of the team, is also superstitious. !
He persuaded the Chief of Police to change j
his star from 13 to 45 because of the un
luckiness of the number, and to this day
there is not a star numbered 13 in the de
partment. When the fact was made
known that thÂ»rÂ«Â» were thirteen in the
group the sanguine faces of the team sud
denly drooped, and they almost believed
that they saw the bill tor the sumptuous i
dinner that will follow the match charged
up to them.
This afternoon there was a meeting of
the whole department, and it was agreed
that the cost of the ammunition that had
been used in practice, and of the banquet,
if the other fellows are not held responsi
ble for it. shall be borne by all the mem
bers and not be conrined to the team
alone. i
SOURCE OF THE X-RAY
Berkeley University Professors
Believe They Have Dis
covered It.
Co-Eds are in Deep Trouble Over
Basket-Bali Mattersâ An Opin
ion on the Schools.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 26.ârrofes
sor Cory and Mr. Le Conte of the depart
ment of mechanics at the university, who
have been conducting for the most part
the experiments with the Roentgen ray,
believe that they are on the right road to
the discovery of the true source of the X
ray. If their experiments prove the origin
of the rays a discovery of world-wide im
portance snail have been made by them.
It has been the object of all the scientists
who have conducted experimentsjwith the
raj- to any extent to deiermine its source,
and no one is yet reported to have made
the progress toward that end which equals
the work done in the Berkeley laboratories.
The results which have been attained by
Professor Cory and Mr. Le Conte verify the j
theories advanced by Lodge. Porter, Hicks I
and other English physicists that the
origin of the rays is where the negative i
stream first impinges aj^inst the solid and {
gives up its negative charge.
In an interview this afternoon Professor
Cory made the following statement with
regard to discovery, or at least the sup
posed discovery :
"On Monday we tried to locate the source :
of the X-rays, and the result of our experi- j
ment seemed to verify tho theory that has j
been advanced by Lodge and Thompsonâ i
that the X-rays seem to be sent oat not
from the cathode, but from the solid that I
received the nevative charge from the !
cathode. Many experimenters have found j
that in the particulur tube used the X-rays j
seem to come from the anode; others that |
the X-rays come from the fluorescent glass.
From the results of the experiments in the
electrical laboratory of tne State Univer
sity :t seems that the source of the X-rays
depends on the tube and the shape of the
electrodes. In other word?, the X-rays
may come from the anode or the glass of j
the tube.
"Mr. Lance, a local photographer, de
veloped all of the plates, and th 6 induction '<
coil used was made by It. W. Lohman, '93,
a student in the college of mechanics.
Lohman has also made n Tesla coil, so
that any number of Crooke'a tubes may be
lighted by connecting a single wire to
them.
"The experiments are now being con
tinued with the hope of getting still more
light on the subject."
Experiments with the Tesla coil show
clearly that the ray can be produced
through the agency of a single wire.
To-day an apparatus was constructed for
proviu^ this fact. Two large pieces of tin
covered sheetiron were suspended at a
perpendicular distance of about eighteen
inches from each other by means of silken
cords. To the upper was fastened the
negative wire and to the lower the posi
tive. A number of tubes, both of the
Crooke's make, and the ordinary incan
descent were laid on top of the lower piece
of sheetiron and the current turned on.
The result was the producing of most
beautiful fluorescent rays, such as are
used in penetrating wood, leather and
other similar non-opaque objects.
The experimenters are intensely inter
ested in the prospects for discovering the
true origin of the Roentgen ray and pur
pose continuing the -work along the same
line they have begun on, with the hope
that their no\v only partially developed
theory will prove to be a living reality.
War Among Baaket-Ballevs.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 26.â There is
serious trouble in the co-ed basket-ball
carjp â trouble which may cause disrup
tion Hbef ore it is over.
The girls have begun to complain con
cerning the Btrict rules laid down as to
their diet and ceneral training, and then
egain .Manager Brownsil! of the Berkeley
nine and Manager Ktifferof the Stanford
team cannot agree as to the officials.
At first Berkeley wanted Mr. Magee and
Dr. Wood for officials and Stanford didn't.
The Stanford management thinks that
because the Berkeley girls had the choice
of place for playing the game, the cardinal
wearers should he conceded the right to
name the officials.
Manager Brownsill doe 3 not Eec it that
way, and so the merry war goes on. First
it v.iis decided to have tv;o gentlemen for
officials, then it was decided to have one
gentleman and one lady, and finally it
was determined not to have a man inside
the hall, but to put two ladies up for
officials. Having decided upon the .sex
for their officials, they cannot arrive at a
conclusion as to who they shall be. There
is one thing they have decided upon, how
ever, and that is that no man shall be
allowed inside the walls of the ampithfa
ter while the contest is on, not even a
physician to care for the dead and
wounded.
For a few days the players thought it
great fun to "go into training," but since
the novelty has worn off and they have
come down to the stern reality of muscle
making they feel differently.
Will Wear thÂ« Big "C,"
BERKELEY, Cal.. March 26.âSixty
six athletes at the university have been
declared by .the Athletic Association
eligible to wear the big "C" â the emblem
of athletic distinction. The right to be
stow this honor has been vested in Harry
Hirst 'M, chairman of the executive com
mittee. Those who are entitled to the
nonor must hold a U. C. or a coast record,
won points in a collegiate or Pacific Coast
championship, a Western intercollegiate
or an Eastern championship contest.
Football men who have played on the tirst
eleven, together with substitutes, will be
! entitled to a "C."
Those who have ployed on the baseball
team in a contest with Stanford and such
oarsmen as the committee decides deserv
ing will also be granted the privilege of
wearies the emblem.
The Athletic Association proposes to see
that no one who is not justly entitled to
the "trademark" by virtue of his athletic
distinction will be allowed to wear it.
They intend to have the insignia a prize
to be worked for.

"If you have me in mind," retorted
Guzman, "you are mistaken. lam not so
rich as reported, but bad I ali that is
credited to me I would still be poor, very
poor, in comparison with yourself and
thousands of men in this and other

STILL INVITING DEATH.
I
The Ordinance Requiring Guards
on Streetcars Totally
Ignored.
OPINION OF MAYOR DAVIE.
Had the Existing Law Been Carried
Out Many Lives Would Have
Been Saved.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 2& \
The ordinance regulating the speed of
streetcars and their manner of passing
each other will come up before the Council
next Monday night for final passage, and
' there will probably not be a dissenting
vote.
The measure provides that streetcars
should never pass within fifty feet of a
j street crossing and was introduced just
] after the fearful death of the two littla
Booth girls in West Oakland a few weeks
ago.
Two years ago an ordinance was passed
relating to guards for the cars and if its
provisions were enforced there would be
enough money received from lines to run
the city government for a year. The fol
lowing extracts from the ordinance show
its purpose and the penalties for disobe
dience:
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or
corporation operating cars for the conveyance
of passengers within the city of Oakland, pro
', pelled by means of wire ropes attached to sta
tionary engines, or by electrictU' or compressed
air or horses or mules to run, operate or use
the same, or permit or cause the same to be
run, operated or used, unless each car or
dummy shall have a suitable buffer or guard
appliance of suitable design and construction
for the purpose of removing from and clear
ing the track of persons and obstructions ; said
bflner or guard shall be placed hi iront of such
ear or dummy and attached to the frame of
Uie forward wheels or trucks thereof , and also
before the rear wheels, and shall run at a uni
form distance of not more than one and a
omit inches above the roadbed or rails over
which such car runs, and shall be so con
structed as to prevent persons or objects on
the roadbed of said car from being run over or
upon by any such car or dummy.
Within thirty days from and after the date
of the passage of this ordinance all persons,
firms and corporations owning or operating
cars for the conveyance of passengers within
i said city of Oakland shall adopt one or more
devices for attachment to their cars or dum
mies for the protection of life and the preven
tion oi accident, and shall within a further
period of ten days rile with the clerk of the
City Council a statement indicating and de
scribing the particular device or devices
adopttu by such person, firm or corporation.
If suoh device or devices are approved by the
said Council then it shall be the duty of each
person, firm or corporation owning or operat
i ing cars for the conveyance of passengers with -
| in the said city of Oakland, within a period of
sixty days thereafter and not later thau ninety
days from and after the adoption and approval
oj t llls ordinance, to.attach or cause to be at
tached to each car or dummy the particular de
vice or devices adopted by such person, firm or
corporation approved by this Council and
to keep such device or devices constantly at
tached to their cars and dummies when the
same fhall be in use. and thereafter no car or
dummy shall be operated or used without such
attachment or such improvement thereto as
mny be thereafter adopted by such person, firm
or corporation and approved by said Council.
Any person, firm or "corporation who shall
violate any of the provisions of this ordinance
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and
i upon conviction thereof shall be punished by
inline not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment
| not to exceed -50 days or by both, such rlne
I and imprisonment.
The continuing or maintaining of any viola
tion of this ordinance shall be deemed a new
offense for each day on which the same is so
continued or maintained and snail be pun
ished accordingly.
This ordinance shall take effect and be in
force ninety days after its passage and ap
j proval.
The records of the Council show that
t c ordinance was passed February 5, 1804.
For over two years it has been ignored by
all the companies, with two exceptions,
and during that time over a dozen people
have been killed. On the Oakland Con
solidated line there are eight men who
i have "killed their man," in t lie language
i of the road, cut their victims have more
frequently been children than men.
MayOr Pavie is preparing a communica
tion to the Council, in which he sets forth
I the fact that the enforcement of such laws
j as have been passed is of far more conse
i quence than the making of new ones. ; 'lf
the ordinance requiring guards had been
enforced," the Mayor, "several little
j children who are now in their graves might
stiil have cheered their parents' homes.
The new ordinance is all right, but the
carrying out of the law regarding guards
would prevent the periodical sacrifice of
life thai we see."

SUFFRAGE BATTLE OPENS
Miss Susan B. Anthony Begins
the Campaign in
Oakland.
Rev. Anna Sbaw, Mrs. Hays, Mrs.
Yates and Dr. Wendte on
the Platform.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 26.â The
woman's suffrage campaign was formally
opened at the Tabernacle tonight. There
was a large audience despite the constant
rain, and the various sneakers were very
cordially received. Rev. Dr. R. ,F.
Coylo opened the proceedings with
prayer, after wh ich Miss Susan B. Anthony
made one of her characteristic SDeeches
and paid a high tribute to the men of Cali
fornia, and prophesied a glorious success
for woman suffrago at the polls next No
vember. At the conclusion of her speech
she was y>rese:itcd with a large basket
of California poppies. In response Miss
Anthony made some appropriate remarks
about native flowers and native sons and
daughters.
"Hfty years ago," said the speaker, "we
were not presented with such things as
t!:e5C. What we received did not look so
sweet or smell so sweet, and they were not
handed to us by comely native daughters.
Our compliments in those days were not
handed to us so daintily as were these
California poppies. They were thrown at
us, ana were of such a nature that they
were not Quite so appreciable. It will not
be long now before there is a greater
change"
Mrs. Yates made a very successful appeal
for funds to carry on the campaign, and
was followed by Miss Anna Shaw and Mrs.
Hays. Rev. C. W. Wendte was invited to
the platform and congratulated the ladies
on the auspicious circumstances under |
which the campaign for woman suffrage i
has started. â¢
JORDAN'S POSITION.
The County Clerk Explains Why Affi
davits of Registration Are
Delayed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, March 26. )
The rapid response of voters to the no
tice to register hag deluged the office of
County Clerk Jordan. Some complaints
have been made to him, and to-day he is
sued to the press the following explanation
and instructions that will be of value and
use to every voter in this county:
Kindly through the columns of your journal
inform voters that those who have sent in their
aftlinvits of registration will receive postals as
soon as it is possible to examine, precinct, tile,
compile and register the same. Give your
readers to understand that the sending out of
postals is not a legal requirement, but that in
order to avoid mistakes and to put voters at
ease concerning iheir registration I have un
dertaken as soon as possible after affidavits are
received nnd before fhe close of registration to
inform all who have made such affidavit of the
fact of the actual entry of their names upon
the great register.
It is estimated that there will be about
22,000 names on the next great register. In
thirty-nine da;, s we have taken in nearly
13,000 affidavits, and there are now over four
months to secure the remaining 9000. This
great rush has necessarily delayed the sending
out of postals.
State for tne benefit of your readers whose
affidavits have been sent in, that if within the
next sixty days postals are not received they
should trieu make inquiries. After the rush
is over there will be less delay in sending out
postals, also please inform your readers that I
did hope to be able to furnish affidavits of
registration i>artly iilled out to each voter in
the county whose name was on the last great
| register and also in the last published dlrec
â  tories and tljose who were actual residents of
the different townships.
In the city of Oakiund 1 have prepared and
mailed over 10,000 ntch affidavits and am now
having affidavits prepared for the remaining
district-;. The task I Bad is a difficult one, be
cause it is necessary to segregate the names of
those who have already registered from those
to be registered, and this necessarily takes a
good deal of time.
Assure your readers that I earnestly desire to
have on the next great register the name of
every man in this county who is entitled to
vote, and to that end have appointed a largn
number of deputies for the accommodation of
the voters in the different districts of the
county and to facilitate the work of registra
tion. All I ask is that the voters will give rea
sonable attention to this matter which con
cerns them so directly and present their affida
vits as soon as possible. Very truly yours,
Frank C. Jobdax, County Clerk.
Their Hypothetical Tract in Kentucky.
John James Ingalls, the Kansas orator,
once bought a farm at long range and
when he went to inspect it found that it
was in the bed of the Mississippiâ very
low, and with no hope of recovery.
Two New York men, however, are in a
still worse fix than the fretful porcupine
of Kansas. Not long ago H. J. Jones and
J. T. Lamar of Syracuse purchased a hypo
thetical 200,000 acres of Kentucky, located
in Johnson County. They got it at a ercat
bargain â caught the seller in a piiich as
tiey thought, though subsequent develop
ments do not bear out this idea. As soon
as the transfer was made the New Yorkers
came to Kentucky to inspect their pur
chase. A faithful search has failed to re
veal any pa r t of it anywhere on earth or
in the heavens above or in the waters on
or under the earth. In fact, the only place
where they have seen any trace of the land
is in the large and enticing map which the
seller exhibited in making the sale, which
he was lei ml enough to give them along
with the deed io the mythical land. They
have nothing else to show for the good
money they gave to the man in a pinch
and will try to get relief through the
United States courts.â Courier- Journal.

ARBITRATION, NOT WAR
Business Men Declare in Favor
of Peace Between the
Nations.
PATRIOTISM WAS NOT IN IT.
4
Eloquent Addresses Delivered Against
the Arbitrament of War Be
tween Nations.
Under the auspices of the Chamber of
Commerce a meeting was held yesterday
to discuss the question of international
arbitration- There was a fair attendance
of prominent men. Hugn Craig presided,
and in calling the meeting to order ex
plained that it had been called in response
to a request from the New York committee
on arbitration.
Secretary Merry read the letter, which
asked the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce to meet and discuss the question in
the interest of peace among nations.
The chairman delivered an address, in
whicn he said :
Any one familiar with the history of the
Anglo-Saxon people, who remembers the
strains which are blended in our race, need
hardly be reminded tuat the lighting blood is
not monopolized by any particular section of
it. Lexington and Bunker Hill, Fort McHenry
and New Orleans, Do nelson and Vicksburg'
are a warranty that the race has not degen
erated in its inarch westward, and is "aye
ready" at the call of duty and country '-to do
or die."
The grit of Maryborough and Wellington is
reproduced in Grant and Lee, Sherman and
Jackson.
The statesmanship of Cromwell and Pitt is
equaled by that of Washington and Lincolp.
Notwithstanding his mighty victories on the
field General Grant abhorred war, and con
ceived his greatest success to have been the
accomplishment of the Geneva arbitration
' committee.
The tender heart of Abraham Lincoln was
strained to the breaking at the suffering and
destruction of life by war.
A well-known specialist has recently pub- â 
lished facts and figures claiming that the
American Nation in wealth-producing power
exceeds that of three of the greatest nations of i
Europe, with their populations of 127,000, i
What the future may have in store as the des
liny of our race can only Le conjectured.
But the man who raises his voice to incite
war and create irritation between these 190,Â«
000,000 of our own race "let his name be
anathema," for no punishment can fit the
crime. â¢
Certainly there can be no danger of our mo
tives being misconstrued if, as a nation, we
take the initiative in this movement for arbi
tration. The very fact that the people of our
country, outside of the professional politicians,
are demanding the appointment of a commit
tee of arbitration, to which shall be referred
for investigation and adjustment all and every ;
question now pending or that may hereafter
arise between the British Government and the
Government of the United States marks an
t-poch in the civilization of the century.
Should Providence thus inspire our good
President, that during the lite of her Most
Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, the objects
of this meeting shall be accomplished; shall
the scribe who records the marvelous story of
her reign not write it as thÂ» ''Golden Age ?'"'
Mr. Craig said he regretted exceedingly
that three gentlemen who were to have
spoken could not be present. He intro
duced Dr. Horatio Stebbins, who began by
stating his view of the. call was for amove- I
went that wouid'call for an international
conference that would establish a high
court of arbitration between England and
America. This, he held, was the import
of the meeting, and also to chronicle and
publish the expressions uttered at it as
part of the expression of public opinion
in America upon the question of arbitra
tion.
Dr. Stebbins spoke in favor of arbitra
tion and against force of arms. Arbitra
tion was, he declared, the subiimest idea
of humanity. In it men allowed them
telyes to be governed by an idea. Inter
national law was a new thought. The
application of arbitration was the unfold
ing and expanding of international Jaw
under a state of public opinion sufficiently
powerful to enforce itself. As he looked
round him, the speaker recognized in the
chair something of the temperament of
the Scotchman, he believed there was
some with the proud blood of the Hohen
zollern in them, others who once owed
fealty to the lily of France, and more than
likely some one wno had given allegiance
to the mighty Czar. And yet it was no
place to make distinctions; they were all
American citizens. Englishmen and
Americans were of one blood, divided only
by distance. These considerations were
worthy of all.
The secretary read the following letter
from Archbishop Kiordan:
Hugh Craigâ Dear Sir: It will be impossible
for me to attend the meeting in the Chamber
of Commerce on Thursday. I am, however, in
complete accord with the object of the meet
ing and you may append my name to the pe
tition asking for the establishment of a Na
tional Board of Arbitration, sincerely yours,"
P. W. Ri on dan.
A communication from Chief Justice
Beatty of the Supreme Court contained !
the following:
Hugh Craig, President, and William Merry, j
Secretary, Chamber of Commerceâ Gentlemen: J
I regret that a previous and imperative engage- I
ment will prevent me iron; attending your I
meeting on Thursday. I desire, however, in I
excusing my absence, to express my hearty
(sympathy with all efforts in the direction of I
international arbitration. Whether it is prac- 1
ticable to secure a general agreement 01 the
civilized powers to any plan for the settlement
of international differences maybe doubtful,
but the object is at least worth striving for,
and the establishment of a permanent board
of arbitration -to decide all controversies be
tween Great Britain and the United States
would, in my opinion, be a ion* step toward
its attainment, and would be of incalculable
advantage, not only to the countries immedi
ately concerned, but to the world at large.
I believe also that the plan is, to that extent
entirely practicable. Once let it become mani
fest that not only enlightenedjphilanthropists
but the great body of men representing the
business and commercial interests of the two
countries are seriously and earnestly in favor
of the principle of arbitration, it cannot be
doubted that the statesmen at the head of the
respective Governments will be found able and
willing to devise a plan for putting it into
operation. And let a permanent tribunal of
arbitration once be established, all me more
â¢ serious obstacles to a friendly and satisfactory
adjustment of future controversies are swept
away. For it is not the difficulty of discover
ing fair terms of agreement in such cases that
impedes a settlement to much as the more
serious difficulty of making a just agreement
acceptable to the people represented by the
negotiators. â¢ * *
Other letters in the same strain from
Irving M. Scott, Judge John Garber, John
J. Valentine and Rev. Robert Mackenzie
â¢were read and met with the hearty ap
proval of the meeting.
Captain Meyer said he was decidedly in
favor of peaceful methods of arbitration,
holding that what obtained in small com
munities should exist among nations. If
anything could be found to abolish war
with honor to both sides it should be
adopted. Peace was so much better than
war every intelligent man to-day should
fayor arbitration. Captain Meyer, there
fore, decided be would very gladly support
a motion for universal arbitration.
Robert M. Fornutn, resident partner of
Baifuur, Guthrie & Co., said it would be
disgraceful at this age it a serious difficulty
should arise between England and Amer
ica. He said he had lived in both coun
tries, and while in either one he always
felt be was dwelling among his own peo
ple*. [Applause.] He felt satisfied that it
would be a retrograde movement beyond
men's conceptions to have a war between
the two countries,' and one that would be
a blot upon the civilization of the nine
teemn century. -Nothing was further from
the minds of the people in England and
America than the thought of a. war. and if
war should be declared- it certainly won d
not represent the real sentiment of the two
â peoples. Tne speaker was satisfied; that
the people ; would abhor a war, yet he
would not dispute that the honor of ; the
country should be upheld above all else,
even at the price of war. He believed,
however, that if Great Britain and the
â  â  'â ":â â " ."'â¢â '-â â '' . . : -'- *â  .â â  ..'. â¢ â â â -â â â - HMn â  â  i
United States could go on together hand
in hand they would make for peace
throughout the whole world and for an
advanced civilization.
W. \V. Montague declared he was in
hearty sympathy with this feeling of
arbitration and hoped that the Ameri
can and English people could find
a point where they could settle
their difficulties. If the two peoples
would only set themselves to work in the
interest of a peaceful solution of inter
national difficulties they could overcome
every obstacle and become fast friends and
dwell together in peace and harmony.
Horace Davis read a long preamble and
resolutions, which set forth that ties of
blood between the two nations made it ad
visable to substitute arbitration for war,
and recommended to Congress and the
President that everything be done to pro
mote arbitration.
In introducing the resolutions he im
pressed his hearers that the arbitration
movement was headed by t!>e great men of
America. Mr. Davis added he was glad
that the movement- was taken in hand by
the Chamber of Commerce, the members
of which were used to peaceful ways, to
the settlement of their disputes by arbi
tration. War was normal in Central
Africa, but with the English and Ameri
can people it was a thing of a thousand
years a so.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsaneer said that it was
evident from the expressions of the speak
ers who preceded him that the people of
San Francisco were in sympathy with ar
bitration. The time has come when the
second sober thought of peace should pre
vail, and the barbarism of war among civ
ilized nations should cease forever. He
believed that the schools of the United
States had done a great deal of harm in
fostering the seed of hatred lor England.
The textbooks were too full of the idea that
when America conquered England was a
tyrant, and 6O on. Children should be
taught history in its true light.
It was time that men should set their
face against the dreadful arbitrament of
war. He would have the Queen of Eng
land and the mistress.of the White House
settle difficulties between the two nations.
Heexpiessed a hope that the resolutions
would bear good truit and moved the adop
tion of the resolutions, which were carried
unanimously.
ASKING FOR A FRANCHISE
People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany Before the Super
visors.
Will Reduce Rates Materially if
Allowed to Put Up Its Poles
and Wires.
The People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany, that recently petitioned the Board
of Supervisors lor a franchise to operate
I telephone and telegraph lines within the
City limits, was represented before the
Street Committee of the board yesterday
by Murtin Stevens, wno tried to induce the
members to recommend that the privilese
be granted.
Mr. Stevens stated that the company had
been organized for the purpose of com
peting with the present system, and that
if it was permitted to put up its lines it
would soon reduce rates. Some of the
committeemen wanted to knew why, if
the company was to start a competing
system, a maximum charge of $5 per
month v.ith ."> cents for each switch was
provided for by the proposed order. Mr.
Stevens stated that such a provision was
necessary to protect the company, as the
present franchise fixes these as the maxi
mum figures. He said that the company
intends to fix its rates at $3 for the rental
of the 'phone and 3 cents for each switch.
He stated that he had already been mak
ing contracts, and that he could produce
them to show that the rates were as rep
resented.
Supervisors Dunker and Benjamin ex
pressed themselves in favor of advertising
for bids for the franchise. They said the
public wanted competition in the tele- j
phone business, as the present rates are j
exorbitant. %% The City is now paying $300 !
a month for the Fire Department tele- ]
phone service," ?aid Dunker, "and I con
sider that outrazeous."
"We will agree to give the City the use j
of forty telephones free of charge," said
the agent of the company. "We will also
agree to give the City 2 per cent of the
gross receipts."
The committee commented favorably on
this proposition, but decided to lay* the
matter over for two weeks in order to give ,
the members a chance to procure copies of j
the proposed order and carefully examine
it.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL GEARY.
He Is Ordered Placed on the Retired
List.
Adjutant-General Barrett has ordered j
Lieutenant-Colonel D. Geary, division j
quartermaster, N. G. C, placed on the re
tired list with the rank of lieutenant
colonel on hi* own application.
Lieutenant-Colonel Geary enlisted in
Battery A, First United States Artillery,
January 9, 1868, was appointed corporal in
M arch of the same year, quartermaster !
sergeant in November and first sergeant I
the year following. After enlisting twice j
in the same regiment he was finally dis
charged as clerk from headquarters of the
Division of the Pacific in February, 1884,
to enable him to accept an appointment in i
the Police Department of tins City.
In April, 18S3, he joined the National
Guard of California as first sergeant ana
rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in
1892. He was in command of the National
Guard troops at West Oakland during the
railroad strike of 1894, and acquitted him
self like a soldier.
Count Leo Tolstoi is a vigorous hater of
Kneland. He says ihe Enfiish and the
Zulus should be herded together as the
two most brutal nations of the earth. His
chief regret, he declares, is that he cannot
spare the time to write a book about the
English people.

CONSUMPTION
CAN BE CORED
The Hirschfelder Fluid Has
Exceeded All Expec
tations.
SO FAR IT IS A SUCCESS
Within a Few Months the
Formula Will Be Given
to the World.
AUTOPSIES PROVE THE WORK.
One of the Greatest Discoveries in
the Annals of Medicine Made
in California.
Last November Dr. J. 0. Hirschfelder of
this City began to test on human beings
the efficacy of a fluid subcutaneous injec
tion" compounded by himself for the pur
pose of curing consumption.
He began with several patients in the
County Hospital, in an. advanced stage of
the dreadful disease, and whose recover y
â¢was considered hopeless by the physicians.
It was not expected that the new remedy
would cure the malady in its last stages,
but it was hoped that it would ease the
pain of the sufferers and give evidence
that the theory upon -which the injection
fluid was compounded was true.
The results exceeded the expectations of
the physicians in charge of the consump
tives' ward. After a week or so of the
treatment it was found that the irritating
and weakening night sweats and night
coughs ceased and that tnere was a gen
eral improvement, but the disease haa
gone too far and had weakened the sys
tem of the patients too much to give tne
remedy an opportunity of showing what
it would do.
Although Dr. Hirschfelder was anxious,
â BO the physicians say, to keep the matter
from getting into the press, for the reason
that premature publicity would do more
harm than good, the patients and their
friends nevertheless talked about the new
remedy, and the facts were investigated
and published by The Call. It was found
in the case of several consumptives that
Dot only did the night sweats and the
coughing cease, but that there was a gain
in weight, thus showing that the restora
tive process had begun.
One of these, a gardener named William
John Davis, was completely cured so far
ac outward appearances went, after three
â months of the treatment. His cough and
sweats stopped and he gained ten or twelve
pounds m weight.
When he came to the hospital he was so
vreak that he could not walk a block witu
out sitting down and resting for at least
five minute*. After he left the hospital
cured he went to work at his trade in Oak
land, and imprudently exposing himself,
contracted" another cola which carried him
off. He was more tnan W years old and
the second attack destroyed all his powers
of resistance.
Several physicians who had an oppor
tunity of seeing the old mans lungs after
death were positive in their opinion that
the Hirscblolder treatment had had the
effect of assisting nature in replacing the
lost tissue. Dr. Lane said that the appear
ance of the dead man's Junes was proof
that Dr. Hirschfelder had hit upon a cor
rect theory of curing not only consump
tion but the majority of other diseases.
A short time ago a committee of medical
men composed of Drs. Kerr, Lane, Ellen
wood and Gibbons was appointed for the
purpose of investigating the treatment.
Ihey visited the patients in the County
Hospital and also private patients in this i
City, and they were convinced that the
remedy was curing the disease. But when
they considered the fact that a long time
was required for the thorough cure of con
sumption and that the remedy had not
been applied earlier than last November
they judged it inexpedient to make a public
announcement of the formula. While,
thus far, the injected fluid had proved that
it was a potent curative agent, they pre
ferred to wait a little longer to watch the
future condition of patients who were be
lieved to have been restored to health.
Taking this view of the matter, they
were content with passing a resolution de
claring that they had investigated the
treatment and found the facts to be such
as to warrant the recommendation that
the treatment be continued until such
time as tiie committee shall deem it pru
dent to announce tnis most important dis
covery to the world.
A copy of the resolution was handed to
Dr. W. F. Southard, editor of the local
-medical magazine, and it will appear next
week. Dr. Southard said that Dr. Hirsch
felder had offered the formula of his dis
covery to him and the rest of the commit
tee, but they declined to accept it for the
reason that it would be injudicious and
premature to give it to the world at tnis
time.
It is reported that the remedy differs
from all other injection fluids used for the
cure of consumption and other diseases,
and that it is not c culture of bacilli or an
animal product. Thus far it has exceeded
the most sanguine expectations. The ex
periments at present are being conducted
with the view of ascertaining the precise
quantity of the fluid necessary for a dose
that will secure the quickest and best re
sults.
Dr. Hirschfelder was asked yesterday to
give some idea of the progress of the inves
tigation into the merits of the remedy, but
he positively refused 10 say anything
about it on the ground that a sufficient
period of time had not elapsed to place all
doubts at rest regarding its efficacy. He
refused to throw any light at all on the
â Ã¼bjeot and referred nis questioner to the
members of the committee. He added
that the publicity already given to the
matter had had a harmful rather than a
beneficial effect upon the public mind.
The cure for consumption has been the
Highest of all in Leavening Power. â Latest U. S. Go Report

Ab&olutely ; pube
coal for which thousands of medical men
have been striving for several hundred
years past. Koch thought that he had
attained it by the preparation of an injec
tion fluid which was to destroy the bacilli
of the disease, but after his discovery had
been announced to the world through the
medium of the medical and secular press
it was discovered that the Koch lymph
was a false alarm.
It was in order to avoid the humiliation
of a similar fiasco that the committee of
physicians appointed to investigate the
work of the Hirsehfeliler fluid resolved to
delay the announcement of its success un
til sufficient time had elapsed to render the
evidence unquestionable and uncontrover
tible. In fact the committee are already
conyinced that the cure for consumption
and for several other diseases has been
found, but through excess of caution they
wish to say nothing about it until the
cured patients shall have resumed their or
dinary vocations and be living witnesses
of the inestimable value of a discovery
which shall write the na.ne of California
in letters of gold upon the annals of medi
cine.
Handy With Ilie Mathlne.
Before Mgr. Massala was elevated to the
cnrdinalate he passed much time in
Ahys i:ilj, and was the prime favorite of
K.iig Menelek. One day the King asked
the future prince of the church to secure
him a sewing machine, of which he had
heard. The machine was shipped to Abys
sinia in parts, and no- one at the court or
in the following of Mgr. Massala could put
them together. At last the. King, despair
ing of outside help, took the machine to
his rooms, worked at it all night, and the
next morning sent for Mgr. Massala and
the Queen to show them his handiwork.
He had succeeded in putting the parts to
gether properly.

DOWNFALL OF A BANKER
George W. Carrick, at One Time
Ralston's Agent, Is
Destitute.
Called at the Police Station and Asked
to Be Taken to the Alms
house.
Hungry, ragged ami emaciated George
W. Carrick, at one time a weil-to-do prom
inent citiaen of this City, called at the
California-street police station yesterday
afternoon and asked to be taken to the
Almshouse. He told the station-keeper a
pitiful story of destitution and want and
said that unless he received aid within a
few days he would certavnly die of starva
tion. The old man's wishes were complied
with and he was taken to the central sta
tion from which place he will be trans
ferred to the Almshouse to-day.
During the boom on the Comstock in
early days Carrick was appointed by W.
C. Ralston, then president of the Califor
nia Bank, as sole agent for the bank
throughout the State of Nevada. In those
days the California Bank had immense in
terests in the mines of the Comstock, and
ihe least error might have precipitated its
ruin. Notwithstanding this fact Ralston's
confidence in his agei^t never weakened,
and Carrick held the position up to a few
months prior to the failure of the bank.
Finally the books, of the bank became
hopelessly tangled, and Carrick, who was
an expert bookkeeper, was brought down
from the Comstock and placed in the
position of head bookkeeper. He only
held his position, however, for a few
months when the bank failed. The failure
was quickly followed by Ralston'g death,
and Carrick, his best friend dead, began
to looK for other employment.
He finally secured a position of consider
able responsibility from the Southern Pa
cific Company, but reverses had weakened
the old man's mind and he eventually
gave up that office.
Since that time he has gone from bad to
worse, until now he is a physical and men
tal wreck. In all probability he will spend
the last of his life dependent upon charity
for a livelihood, a life which stands out in
bold contrast to his busy useful career
during the boom of the Cqmstock.
He Knew Court Painters.
When the picture of the Russian Grand
Duchess Olga, ' whom he later married,
was shown to the late King Charles of
"Wurtemberg,' he .looked at: the portrait
carefully and then, said dryly: "The por
trait is highly -flattering;; the ' hair is too
full, the eyes are too brilliant and the skin
too fresh. "But, your Majesty, you do
not know the Princess," answered "the ad
jutant, who had been sent from' St. Peters
burg. "No, that is true," said the King,
"but I know court painters." â¢ . *

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 27, 18S6,
TWO ROBBERIES
IN ONE WEEK
One Was Within a Block
and a Half of a Police
Station.
BOTH B7 THE SAME MEN
One Held a Revolver to the
Head of the Vic
tims.
MADE A PRETTY GOOD HAUL*
No Clews Left by the Footpads on
Which the Detective Force
May Work.
Two daring highway robberies in thickly
settled parts of the City have agitated the
police during the present' week.
One robbery was perpetrated less than a
block and a half from the California-street
' police station and the other only a few
blocks from the Harbor police station.
In each case two men committed the
robbery, one of them holding up his vic
tim at the muzzle of a revolver and the
other securing the plunder.
From the necessarily meager description
triven by the robbed men, their attention
having been concentrated more upon the
revolver than upon the footpads, the police
believe that the two hold-ups were done
by the same persons.
The first robbery was committed last
Tuesday night. A stranger from the
country had been visiting Chinatown and
at about 11 o'clock, when a few yards
north of California street, on Dupont, two
men standing in the shadow of St. Mary's.
Church stepped in front of him. One of
them poked the muzzle of a revolver into
the stranger's face and commanded him in
a gruff voice :
â¢'Throw up your hands, and don't let a
squeal out of you."
The man from the country shot two
brawny arms and sunburned fists toward
the zenith. He had no remarks to make.
In fact he was so much surprised and agi
tated at the black muzzle of the pistol that
his mouth was too full for utterance, his
heart being in it.
There was a grocery store on the oppo
site corner not more than 100 feet away,
and there was considerable travel from Du
pont street down California to St. Mary's
alley, and from the alley back again by
persons going slummine.
But this was not company ior the coun
tryman. Ho dared not call for help, be
cause the footpad with the pistol, cocked
it, making considerable noise in doing so,
and with an oath threatened to send a bul
let down bis throat if he uttered a sound.
The other highwayman rifled the coun
tryman's pockets with a skill and daxter
ity that betrayed long practice in tne agile
art of pocket-p icking. He took a gold
watch and chain and a few dollars in sil
ver. In another pocket was a purse con
taining considerable gold; but before the
robber could reach it the approach of sev
eral Chinamen alarmed him and his part
ner and they ran away.
The man who had been plundered was
so confused and alarmed that he remained
standing for fully a minute on the spot
where the robbers had left him, and by
that time they were out of sight in some
one of the many dark and dingy alleys
which exist in Chinatown.
He reported the matter to the police,
but owing to the fright into which the
thieves had thrown him he was unable to
give a very good description cf them.
The next affair took place on Wednes
day night between 11 and 12 o'clock on
Clay street, between Battery and Front,
the victim also being a visitor from the
country. He was rooming with a friend
on the City front, and was returning from
one of the theaters where he had spent the
'evening.
As he was walking rapidly through a
part of the street where the shadows were
the deepest two men stepped out of a da rk
doorway, and before he could have an op
portunity of using a weapon if he' bad one
the foremost highwayman poked a pistol
in front of his eyes and gruffly ordered
him to throw up his hands and to refrain
from reciting either prayers or stuoip
speeches.
The other man took from the victim's
pockets $30 in coin and a dep^ '-it-book on
the Hibernia Bank. Then, keeping him
covered with the revolver, they ordered
him to pursue the even tenor of his way
and not to look around or to disturb the
peace in any manner, under penalty of
being shot' in the baok.
The robbery was reported to the police
yesterday, but the description of the rob
bers was not very definite owing to the
darkness which existed at the place of the
hold-up.
With George the Srrangler on his weekly
rounds and two successful hold-ups in one
week the detective force cannot complain
of lack of work.
COMBINE IN LIGHT.
Consolidation of the Gas Company and
the Edison Concern Probably â¢
Effected. .
â¢Negotiations for the consolidation of the
San Francisco Gas Company and the Edi
son Light and Power Company are : still in
progress. The committee having the sub
ject under consideration consists of J. 8. .
Stetson, L. P. Drexler, Joseph ; B. Crockett
and George W. Prescott. ;
â 12 It is -believed' that ! a consolidation has
been , practically ' effected and that the '
combined; capital stock will consist â -. of
140,000 shares, of which the gas company
will have 100,000 shares. ; / . â¢ . â¢
J. B. Stetson was asked last, even ing if
the trust had been formed, as reported on
the street, but declined to be interviewed
on the subject. r . Vi;
Yesterday the stock of the gas company
again went to 84^i and only receded a
shade. The Edison stock wa3 quoted at
107^. ',:./.â :- /- -' -. â â  -â¢.- .â â¢; : -:-L:>
On the division of the stock, which gave
the gas company 100,000 shares, it was pro
posed that ; the Edison company should
have 33,000 shares for . its 20,000 shares al
ready out, and that the rest should !be re
served to meet the bonded and floating in
debtedness of the latter corporation. The
Edison' directors contended for a larger
share :of the t stock. It is ' surmised ' that
some concessions were made â to effect the
deal. V V
HOMER HENLEY'S DEBTS
They Became Too Much for Him
and He Is Declared
Insolvent.
He Owes Over Nine Thousand Dollars
on Various Loans and
Accounts.
Homer S. Henley, the singer, is bow.cd
down under the weicht of his debts, and
so he has petitioned the Superior Court to
relieve him by declaring him insolvent.
This was done yesterday morning.
Henley owes $9218 15, and the inventory
of his assets consists of a blank puge. The
items of his indebtedness are as interesting
as they are varied. The Jargesfilem on
the list is one of $8000, owing to D. Sped
ding of 514 Eddy street, the house where
Henley himself lives. Then there is $4 50
for confectionery, $105 50 for stationery, for
advertising $14; for lodgines at G. W.
Leik's, 30O'Farrell street, $100: for lodg
ings at the Burlington $8, for drugs $11, for
tailors' bills $211 (these include bills from
seven different tailors), for flowers $7 85,
shoes $5, professional services $20150,
groceries $253 25, cash borrowed from
various people $90, hat $4 50, dentistry $85,
laundry $74 85, cigars $7 86, meals at the
Oberon $7, clothing $15, furnishings $9 25,
livery $10, photos $7 50 and shirts $4 50.
Henley teaches music. He always ap
pears well dressed and with money in his
pocket, and his appearance as an insolvent
ia much of a surprise. He was recently
married, and still more recently has ac
cepted a position in the Tavary Opera
Company. _________^^_
MAY CONTAIN A JOKER
A Proposed Amendment to the
Constitution of the
State.
Bamkers, Lawyers and Capitalists
Carefully Studying the
Proposition.
The Legislature of 1895 proposed several
important amendments to the constitution
of California which will be submitted to
the voters for g ratirication at the next gene
ral election. The proposed amendment
relating to the assessment and taxation of
property may be regarded as the most sig
nificant, as it contemplates the overthrow
of the system of taxation wnich delegates
to the constitutional convention of 1879
worked so hard to secure and on which
the main fight for the adoption of the con
stitution largely longed.
It is known that money-lenders,
bankers and lawyers, representing insti
tutions which hold securities of great
value, are gtudyinj: the provisions of the
proposed amendments anu discussing the
chances of ratification by the people.
There maybe jobs lurking somewhere
in the proposition, as the .Leeislature
which proposed the amendments was not
overscrupulous or exceptionally in
telligent.
The amendment is numbered 33, and re
peals sections 4 and 5 of the existing con
stitution and amends section 1 to read:
Section 1. All property in the State not ex
empt underthe laws of" the United States or
tli is constitution shall be taxed in proportion
to its value, to be ascertained as provided by
law. The word "property" as used in this
article and section is hereby declared to in
clude moneys, credits, bonds, stocks, dues,
franchises and ail other matter and things,
real, personal and mixed, capable of private
ownership; provided that property used for
free public libraries and iree museums, grow
ing crops, mortgages, trust deeds, property
used exclusively for public schools, and such
as may belong to the United States, this State
or to any county or municipal corporation
within this Btate shall, be exempt from taxa
.tion. The Legislature may provide tor a re
duction from credits of debts due bona-fide
residents ot this State.
Sec. 2. Section 4 of article XIII of this consti
tution is hereby repealed.
Sec. 3. Sections ofanicleXll of this consti
tution is hereby repealed.
In order to convey to the reader more
information on the subject, the sections
indicated for repeal are repubhshed, as
follows:
Sec. 4. A mortgage, deed of trust, contract or
other obligation by which a debt is secured
shall for the purposes of assessment and taxa
tion be deemed and treated as an interest in
the property affected thereby. Except as to
railroad and other quasi public corporations,
in case of debts so secured, the value of the
property affected by such mortgage, deed of
trust, contract or obligation, less the value of
such security, shall be assessed and taxed to
the owner of the property, and the value of
such security Rhall be assessed and taxed to
the owner thereof In the county, city or
district in which the property affected
thereby is situated. The taxes so levied shall
be a hen upon the property and security,
and may be paid by either party to
'such security; it pan! by the owner of the
security, the tax so levied upon the property
affected thereby shall become a part ot the
debt so secured; if the owner of the property,
shall pay the tax so levied on such security, it
shall constitute a payment thereon, and to the
extent of such payment a full discharge
thereof; provided that if any such security or
indebtedness shall be paid by any such debtor
or debtors, after assessment and before the tax
levy, the amount of such levy may likewise be
returned by such debtor or debtors, and snail
be computed according to the tax levy for the
preceding year.
Sec. 5. Every contract hereafter, made by
which a debtor is obligated to pay any tax or
assessment on money loaned or any mortgage,
deed of trust or other lien shall, as to any in
terest specified thereon, and as to such tax or
I assessment, be null and void.
A DOG OF HIGH DEGREE
Arrival Here of a Son of Prince
Bismarck's Famous
Guardian.
WILLIAM I OWNED HIS SIRE.
Captain Wolters' Magnificent Canine
That Was Banished by
Bremen Police.
One of. if not the bluest-blooded dogs
that ever reached the Pacific Coast, if not
the entire United States, is dot housed at
the home of Charles H. Catterniole of 1522
Mason street, where his owner, Captain
VVolters, until recently master of the Ger
man bark J. C. Pfluger, is visiting.
The sire of this aristocrat among canines
is Yras, the great dog who invariably fig
ures in the photographs of Prince Bis
marck, Germany's grand old man, while
his dam id an equally celebrated bitch also
belonging to the Prince.
Sultan, as the dog is called, is of the
famous Ulmer breed, the greatest among
German dogs, and bears resemblance to
both the Great Dane and mastiff breeds.
He is 48 inches from the tip of his nose to
the base of his tail, stands 31 inches tall at
the shoulder and weighs over 180 pounds.
He is a rich brindle in color and walks
with the stately tread of a lion.
Sultan's sire and dam were once the
property of Emperor William I, who pre
sented them to Prince Bismarck. Both
were inmates of the famous Zahna breed
ing station in Prussian Saxony, and there
. Sultan was born. "While still a young
pup he was presented to Mr. Bremerman,
a director of the North German Lloyd
Steamship Company, who kept him until
his temper brought him under the ban of
the Bremen police, who notified his owner
that he must be killed, confined or exiled.
Just before the Pfluger sailed from
Bremen Mr. Bremerman offered Sultan
and another dog to Captain Wolters pro
vided he would make a substantial con
tribution to ihe city's poor. On the
mariner's depositing 160 marks in ihe
poorbox he became the owner of the pair.
On the Pfluger's arrival in this port the
other, dog, a magnificent fawn specimen,
was sold to John D. Spreckels for a hand
some price, but Captain Wolters refused
to part witU Sultan, though receiving
many tempting offers.
The discipline of a ship has moderated
Sultan's temper, and he shows no hostility
except when his master's physical welfare
is threatened, and allows those who visit
the captain to fondle him with impnnity.
Captain Wolters leaves for Germany
within a few days and Sultan accompanies
him. '
Cooper produced his best tales when a
young man. He always believed his first,
written when he was about 20 years of ago,
was his b^st.
