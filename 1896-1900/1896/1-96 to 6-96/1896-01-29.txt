An Elaborate Scheme for
Re-Funding Railroad
Debts.
CONSIDERED IN SECRET.
But There Was First a Public
Session of the House
Committee.
HUNTINGTON'S MEN AT WORK,
They Make Elaborate Statements That
â  Are Easily Picked to Pieces
by Maguire.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.â
House Committee on Railroads after its
session to-day went into secret session.
Every member was pledged to secrecy.
It was decided to send to Secretary Hoke
Smith for his opinion of the bill intro
duced by Representative Smith of Illinois,
the member of the Pacific Roads Commit
tee who last year supported Reiliy's bill.
Representative Smith's measure will be
the one adopted by the House committee,
and will in all probability be passed
through Congress.
After dealing with the Union Pacific it
provides that the Secretary of the Treas
ury be authorized and directed to ascer
tain the amount of the respective indebt
edness of the Central Pacific Company of
California and Western Pacific Railroad
Company on the first day of July, 1896,
upon the same principle as if the whole
sum of bonds and interest paid and to be
paid by the United States thereon and not
theretofore repaid by credits on account
thereof were to be paid to the United
States in cash on the said day, and said
sum shall be computed and ascertained as
follows: '777./i'4
"Firstâ The whole of the principal of
said subsidy bonds attributable to each of
said companies shall be added to the
interest paid or to be paid by the United
States upon the same, so as- to ascertain
the total amounts that would have been
due the United States for principal and
interest paid on bonds issued to each of
said companies at their maturity if no
payments or reimbursements had been
made thereon by the companies. "~ -7 a
"Secondâ From * the * same amounts so
ascertained shall be deducted any pay
ments or reimbursements made by or on
behalf of either of said companies upon
their indebtedness at any time before the
first day day of July, 1896, as shall appear
in the bond and interest accounts of said
companies, respectively, with the United
States.Â«@|
"Thirdâ Compute the present worth of
the amounts so found as of the first day of
July, 1896, on the basis that money is
worth 2 per cent per annum during the
period between the date of tbe average
maturity of said bonds and the first day of
July, 1864. From the sums so ascertained
there shall be deducted amounts in the
sinking fund applicable to said companies,
respectively, computing the value of any
' bonds in said sinking fund at their market
, value at the time of such computation, as
.estimated by the Secretary of the Treas
ury, and said sinking fund shall thereupon
be applied as' payment upon the debt of
such company to the United States. To
the total amounts so ascertained and re
maining unpaid, after deducting said
sinking fund, add the sum to be com
puted on such basis, assuming money to
be worth 2 per cent per annum, as to rep
resent the present capitalized worth of the
rebate of interest for ten years of 1 per
cent per annum on the total unpaid
amounts and on the sum so added for the
rebate of interest.
. "The aggregate amounts arrived at by
such addition shall be arrived at by calcu
lating upon such capitalization as would
be required to be paid in cash on said day
for .the purpose of completely discharging
their entire debts to the United States.
"The Central Pacific is authorized to
make, issue and to deliver to the Secretary
of the Treasury a mortgage, which shall
bear date of the first day of July, 1896,
covering and embracing the entire prop
erty of such company, as at present con
solidated, real, personal and mixed, in
cluding all right, title and interest of such
company in any stocks, bonds, or securi
ties or lands of any branch lines, or auxil

those which its successors or assigns may
hereafter acquire, subject to any bona fide,
lawfully prior and paramount lien, claim
or mortgage upon any railroad franchises
whose property is now owned by such
company, or which company may here

"But such mortgage shall not be con
strued to prevent the said company from

faith and for valuable consideration; nor
to prevent the railroad company from

in its land grant and apply the proceeds
thereof as required by the provisions of
any mortgage or liens thereon, prior to the

Huntington's lobby was actively at work
to-day. Huntington himself was busy.
Reilly of Pennsylvania (a statesman out
of a job) is here, and had a talk with the
railroad magnate to-night. He has prob
ably been employed as a lobbyist. J. C.
Stubbs is also here, accompanied by hi
secretary, W. C. Martin. John Boyd was
iv conference with ex-Representative (and
ex-Senator) Blair to-night. Another lob
byist , was * consulting with Chairman
Powers.
Representative Maguire said to-night
the committee would "rush things."
Mr. Boatner of Louisiana will probably
be the only member of the Pacific Roads
Committee who will vote against the
funding bill. He was a member of the
committee in the last Congress and stood
with Maguire. He thinks the committee
report will be almost unanimous for the
refunding bill. "I am the last of the
Mohicans," said he to The Call corre
spondent to-day. yA*'-p.
The House Committee on Pacific Rail
roads met at 1 o'clock this afternoon. Mr.
Thurber of New York spoke in a general
way for twenty minutes in favor of fund
ing the debts of the Pacific railroads, but
made no new or specially interesting point
in favor of the proposition, except that he
was an entirely disinterested person, look
ing to the public welfare. "
Charles H. Tweed of New York, cool,
smooth and eloquent, next addressed the
committee for an hour and a half in favor
of funding the debt of the Central Pacific.
He expressed the belief that the com
pany could pay its debts to the United
States Government in 100 annual install
ments, with interest at the rate of 2 per
cent. ' He said the company could not
give the Government a first mortgage on
any of the railroad property, because it
would have to arrange with its private
creditors for the extension or their first
mortgage claims and must give ; to those
creditors the same security which they
now hold ; but he said the company would
give the Government a mortgage upon all
of its property, including its ferry and ter
minal facilities at Oakland, the California
and Oregon road from Roseville to the
State line with also the road from Lathrop
to Goshen, which additional securities he
thought would greatly improve the Gov
ernment's position as a creditor. He said
that the earnings of the Central Pacific
road lor the last five years had ranged
from a little over $2,000,000 in 1891 down to
$42,000 in 1894, and ] estimated that the
company, 7 unless it should be obliged to
submit to further ' reductions in freights,
could afford to pay.the Government about
$1,250,000 a year on the new arrangement.
Grove L. Johnson of California, address
ing Mr. Tweed, at this point said : 7 "It has
been asserted, particularly in California,
by some politicians that if the Pacific Rail
road debts should be refunded the people
of California would be obliged to pay the
debts in increased freight charges over the
roads. Is there any foundation for such a
statement?"
Tweed replied: "No, sir, the proposition
is absurd. Freight rates on the Central
Pacific Railroad, as on all other railroads,
are kept down by competition and they
could not be increased to cover the funded
debt." ;
:In answer to a question* by Boatner
Tweed said he did not think' that the re
duction of net ; profits oh the Central Pa-,

cific from $2,000,000 to $42,000 a year had
been caused by a diversion of traffic to the
Southern Pacific road.
Hiiborn stated that he thought Tweed
bad conveyed a false impression concern
ing the character and value of the railroad
lands by stating that most of the land was
arid and mountainous and asked if a very
large portion; of the railroad grant land
was not at least claimed, to be very valu
able for their minerals, and also asked at
what value the lands were held by. the
company and .what had been realized from
the sale of land up to this time.
Tweed replied that many contentions
had been made concerning some of the
land of the company, but that he had not
come prepared, to answer any questions
concerning those matters, and, therefore,
could not throw much light upon them.
At this point Mr. Johnson said: ,
, "Mr. Hiiborn, I have introduced a bill
securing to the miners more chances than
they now have in their fight with the rail
road company for mineral lands, and hope
you will help me pasts the bi11." .,, -.
Hiiborn replied: "That looks like a con
fession that the miners have not hereto
fore had a fair chance." , Tz/AyAAT^TTf
Johnson retorted : "Oh, no, ; that don't
follow at all;* but my bill will give them a
better chance."
Maguire then, by leave of the commit
tee, proceeded to cross-examine Tweed
concerning the Central Pacific's proposi
tions, its alleged new securities and iv re
lations to the Southern Pacific Company
of Kentucky. Tweed .' admitted, in reply
.to Maguire's questions, that the, Goshen
and Lathrop road was mortgaged to the
extent of about $40,000 per mile, and that
the mortgage would be prior to the Gov
ernment's mortgage under the re-funding
arrangement. T : ;
He would not admit that the road was
worth less than $20,000 per mile and did
not know that a ; new and better broad,
gauge railroad is now being built through
the San Joaquin Valley at cost of $10,000
per mile. He admitted that the Oakland
terminal facilities were subject as a first
lien to $16,000,000 blanket mortgage of the
Central Pacific Railroad and that the mort
gage would be prior to the Government's
claim under- the re-funding scheme. He
also admitted that the road from Niles to
Oakland is specially mortgaged at $30,000
per mile independently of the blanket
mortgage. He also admitted that the Cal
ifornia and Oregon road between Roseville
and the State line is mortgaged for at least
$10,300,000 which would also be prior to
the Government's claim.
Tweed having stated that the California
and Oregon road was built by a local conÂ»
pany and afterward acquired by the Cen
tral Pacific â by purchase, Maguire pro
ceeded to cross-examine him on that point,
stating that the reoort of the Pacific Rail
road Commission showed that at least the
northern half of the road had been built
by the Contract and- Finance Company,
consisting really of ] Messrs. Huntington,
Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker, under
contract with the Central Pacific Railroad
Company, and that they had paid them
selves for the building of roads $8,400,000;
whereas the construction of the road had
cost them * only i $3,500,000 and had then
mortgaged the branch road for $11,400,000.
He asked Tweed if| that part of the report
of the Pacific Railroad Commission was
not true. *
Tweed said that part of the report, he
thought, could not be true.
Johnson objected to this line of question
ing by Maguire on the ground that it had
nothing to do with the matter pending be
fore the committee..
Maguire said: "I think the questions
are pertinent and material. These . people
are offering alleged additional securities
to the Government as an inducement to
an extension ' of credit. I want to show
that the alleged additional securieties are
worthless because they are already mort
gaged far beyond . their value."
Johnson replied : "They have made no
such offer, as I understand it."
Maguire proceeded to question Tweed
about the lease of the Central Pacific
Railroad to the Southern Pacific Company,
showing that the Southern Pacific Com
pany by lease controls : all : the lines o i
railroad running to or from California be
tween Siskiyou Mountains â  arid : Tehachapi

BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 23.â Last Sunday
night the steamer^ J. W. Hawkins, com
manded by Captain Woodrow, sailed from
New York with a party of between seventy
five and 100 men bound, it is claimed," for
Cuba, where the party was to enter the
ranks of the insurgent army. When the
steamer was off the eastern end of Long
island she sprang a serious leak, and the
water gained so rapidly that all bands
were obliged to take to the boats.
Monday morning the : men were picked
up by passing schooners, among which
was the three-masted schooner Helen H.
Benedict, Captain Brockett, ' bound from
Norfolk for Boston- with a cargo of coal.
The Benedict picked up twenty-five of the
men and landed them at Vineyard Haven
late last nignt, from which place they were
transferred this morning by the steamer
Susie D and landed at Woodsboll, where
they took an early train for New York.
The four-masted schooner Alice B.
Crosby, Newport News for Boston, fell in
with another boat from the steamer about
sixty-five miles southeast of 'Sandy Hook
lightship, which contained twenty
persons, but owing to - the rough - sea only
thirteen were â  saved, the other- ten being
drowned.' The Crosby landed the sur
vivors at Woodsboll this - morning, where
they took a train for New York this after
noon. ' Ââ¢ y "" â¢ '.
â¢ Another vessel, a three-masted schooner,
picked up a number of the wrecked people
ana it is supposed put back with them to
Delaware breakwater. ".. The men were
mostly Spaniards and would say very little
concerning the disaster. It was said,
however, that the steamer's true destina
tion was Cuba; that her cargo consisted of
$25,000 worth of ammunition, one gun on
board having cost $5000. /
The J.; W. Hawkins was a steamer of 125
tons net and â  188 tons gross. .' She was
built at Kennebunk, Me., in 1880, arid'
hailed from Onancock, Va. The steamer
has been engaged in the fishing, business,
but lias been lying idle in Baltimore har
bor for some months.
Two weeks ago a Mr. Tinsley appeared
in Baltimore, and desired to purchase 'the
steamer for a Mr. Smith of New York.
Those interested in the sale noticed that
plenty of money for the purchase was ap
parently at hand; : but whatever sus
picions the sellers may have entertained
they. were very careful to keep to them
selves, and in an incredibly short time the
boat was delivered to her new owner free
from debt. She was at once taken to New
York, where it is alleged a little band lof
men were gathered in readiness -.toi get on
board, .their intention being to join the
Cuban army and . fight 7in the ranks. In
spite /of .the vigilance^ of the 'Spanish
authorities, the steamer was fitted for sea
and the men were taken safely ,on board.
Last Sunday night r she sailed from ' that
port, commanded by Captain Woodrow.
Unfortunately, ho.vever, the : boat ;, was
unfit for sea and the hasty preparations
had \ allowed no time for 7 a thorough ex
amination of her bottom, for she had pro
ceeded only as far as eastern end of
Long Island when she sprang a dangerous
leak and began to settle in the .water. Tln
spite of all the crew could do the leak
gained with fearful rapidity and in a short
time it was apparent that ; they must take
to the boats or go down with tbe vessel.
\lt is. believed there were between 75 and
100 men on board, and they had barely
time to get into the small boats before the
steamer went down.
TAKEN TO NEW YORK.

NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. The ocean

ran up alongside and after an hour's dan
gerous work got the men on the Dalzell.
After the tug got under way it was agreed
that I put one man off at Pier 8, North
River, and ' I did so. He said he was a
gunner. I did not catch his name. ; None
of them made any secret about their ef
forts to reach Cuba and their fight for her
freedom.
"The most dejected person on board
was an old man, who told me he was
Garcia and was in charge of tbe expedi
tion. He was accompanied by his son
Carlos Garcia. Garcia seemed ' completely
broken down. He said that the Cubans
had played one of ' their strongest cards of
the revolution in sending out this expedi
tion, and that more than $200,000 worth of
arms and ammunition had been lost by the
sinking of the Hawkins."
â¢ Garcia then related to Captain Denyze
the story of the wreck. He said:
"We .loaded the steamer James W.
Hawkins for the expedition at Port Morris.
All day the hatches were closed, and no
body ever had any suspicion that we had
thousands of dollars' worth of arms in her
hold. All the work was, done at dead of
night. â¢ We sailed on Friday night and
went out by Long Island Sound. We had
excellent weather until Sunday, when it
began to get rough. On Monday morning
early the vessel 7 sprang a leak. ... The
waves and wind just opened her seams.
Pumps were fl manned, but they soon
choked with coal and became useless. Then
the. men got buckets and bailed for their
lives.. The water gained inch by inch,
and finally the coal went overboard and
the costly* arms , and ammunition. It
broke ,our , hearts ito throw these arms
away, but we had to keep the vessel afloat
somehow. Gradually the Hawkins set
tled down, and at 11:30 o'clock on Monday
morning we took the lifeboats and deserted
the sinking steamer. 7; Half an hour later
the ' Beebe â  hove *in sight \ and took us on
board..* At the time the Hawkins went
down she i was forty-five miles south
southeast of r Barnegat, and .the sea was
very wild." :
' Captain Denyze said that the men saved
nothing but two valises filled with United
States bank notes. These are in the posses
sion of General Garcia.

Four were' Americans and nine Cubans.
They left for New York by train:-/-
As the Cubans could talk no English it
was * difficult to obtain any ;in formation

NEW YORK, N. Y.\ Jan. 28.â The final
gathering of the filibusters was in a mar
ble-yard at Port Morris, at One Hundred
and Thirty-eighth street, where there is a
dock, late Saturday night.
General Garcia, his son and 170 other
Cubans, who had enlisted for the expedi
tion, met in the yard and the Hawkins
tied up 7at this dock. Then it was
found that there were more volunteers
than the steamboat could carry. It was im
possible to take more than 120 and it was
necessary to sift out fifty m en. This an-
nouncement was made after two men had
deserted and had been chased away in the
darkness.
- After the chosen band had been sifted
and the 120 had got aboard the Hawkins
steamed away for the Sound. The arms
of the boat consisted of two Hotchkiss
rapid-fire guns, 1200 Remington and Win
chester rifles and some revolvers.
There was plenty of ammunition for tne
Hotchkiss guns and 1,000,000 cartridges for
the rifles. General Garcia also had taken
along 3000 pounds of dynamite and ma
terials for making heavy explosives.
REGARDED AS A MISFORTUNE.

Jloxcncnst.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Jan. 28.âSev
eral prominent Cubans were seen this
evening regarding the disaster to the
steamer Hawkins, which had a cargo of
arms and ammunition besides a party of
Cubans bound for their native country.
While they admitted that it was a mis
fortune and caused general regret they
seemed to be by no means downcast be
cause of the mishap.
"On the contrary," said one of the lead
ing Cubans of the city, "we are ready to
make still greater efforts in behalf of the
struggle to free our country. We Cubans
have to purchase vessels, arms, everything
under difficulties. Such purchases must
be made and very quietly. . We are there
fore exposed to deception. Those who
purchased the Hawkins were evidently
deceived regarding her seaworthiness."

Register to-night says:* - : 7y"f;
\ It is asserted this afternoon on the high

Cuban insurgents had been fitted up on the
coast of Long Island, only a short distance
from this city, and sent safely to the island

the insurgents' cause. For several months
the work of fitting out the craft has been
in progress and it was stated that the last
vessel was a brigantine and left its port on
the coast only a month ago.
The vessels 1 have been able to
make such an unsuspected escape
through the ' fact that the Govern

them at the New York end of the Sound,
while the boats slipped away by Montauk
Point and New London. The main value
of the supplies for the Cuban cause lay in
the arms } shipped. These were obtained,
it was stated, from the manufacturers in
this vicinity and were transported to the
objective point on the coast quietly, where
they were taken on. board the boat and
got away later. The insurgents have
found, it is said, nearly as many and as
willing hands in executing the mission as
the slaves found in the celebrated under

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Jan. 28.â 0f course
C.*P. Huntington does not read the Louis
ville Courier- Journal everyday all the way
through, but he always manages, through
the watchmen that he has at every point
of danger, to keep well posted as to what is
going on concerning his interests. When,
therefore, he learned that an article had
appeared in the paper giving a synopsis of
an address sent out to the people of Ken
tucky by the Mayor of San Francisco, call
ing upon them to repeal the charter of the
Southern Pacific Company, he felt called
upon to say something in his own de
fense/ In his reply, published in Mr. Wat
terson's journal to-day, Mr. Huntington,
among other things, says:
The men who assisted me in getting the char
ter and allowed their names to be used in that
connection were honorable men and their fel
low-citizens very well know that such men as
Henry D. McHenry, General John Echols and
their associates would not do anything dishon
orable. They knew what the purpose was, and
the charter has never been used for any other
purpose. ,' " ; ".'-.,*-.V"-'
Now, in regard to those gentlemen to
whom Mr. Huntington refers as assisting
him in getting the Southern Pacific char
ter. Henry D. McHenry is dead. Nothing
further need be said of him. therefore,
than that he was one of the incorporators
of the old Elizabethtown and Paducah
Railroad, which had become bankrupt,
and about the time of the organization of
the Southern Pacific Company passed into
the hands of Mr. Huntington and his
associates and is now operated by him as
a part of the Newport News and Missis
sippi Valley Railroad, which forms the
link in the Southern Pacific's transcon
tinental system' from Louis rille to Mem
phis, Term. Mr. McHenry was at the time
a member of the Democratic National
committee and a man of great influence in
the State.
General John Echols, next mentioned,
has been \ the . general manager jof Mr.
Huntington's interests in Kentucky ever
since he obtained control of the Newport
News and Mississippi Valley Railroad, and
he is the second vice-president of that
organization. He is no tyro in dealing
with legislators in the matter of charters,
and on account of his suave and facile
ways of managing things goes in this city
by the sobriquet of "Old Smoothing
iron,' ' which he acquired at the time Mr.
Huntington obtained the Short Route
Transfer Railroad along tbe river front in
this city.
Previous to his coming to Louisville he
had charge of Mr. Huntington's Chesa
peake and Ohio Railroad, from tidewater
to Huntington, W. Va. He has been con
nected with Mr. Huntington's interests
ever since 1868. '
Of the other incorporators of the South
ern Pacific Company two certainly were
incorporators of the . bankrupt Elizabeth
and Paducah Railroad. One of themâ
Samuel Coxâ had been associated with Mr.
Huntington in various enterprises for
years previous. That these gentlemen
were not entirely disinterested in getting
the charter for Mr. Huntington's So uthern
Pacific Company is well known in Louis
ville. They were working for their own
interests and their master's.
The part of Mr. Huntington's letter
stating that they desired a charter in a
State where the laws were stable is rather
amusing to people who know the facts.
The ease with which sucn a charter could
be got in this State at that time is well
proved by the number of such acts passed
by the various State Legislatures from the
date of the war up to 1890â several thou
sand in number.
As indicated yesterday Mr. Hunting
ton's forces are gathering at Frankfort to
fight the Goebel bill.
General Basil W. Duke, James P. Helm
and St. John Boyle went up yesterday. The
first named is regularly retained by the
Louisville and Nashville Railroad; the
second is a prominent railroad attorney
frequently employed by Mr. Huntington,
and the last is one of the receivers of the
Ohio Valley Railroad, controlled by Mr.
Huntington.
H. E. Queen of Covington, a fellow
townsman of Goebel and one of Hunting
ton's main dependents, is also there- with
others skilled in such work.
California should not waste any time.

NOW BEFORE THE
SUPREME COURT
Argument Commenced in
the Suit Against Stan
â¢ford's Estate.
CONTENTION OF COUNSEL
Government Attorneys Set Forth
the Liability of Railroad
Stockholders.
OBLIGATIONS OF AIDED LINES.
Mr. Choate Says That the Senator's
Widow Is Not Responsible for
Any Indebtedness.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.âArgu
ment was heard to-day by the Supreme
Court of the United States in the famous
suit brought by the United States against
the estate of the late Senator Stanford of
California, as a stockholder in the Central
Pacific Railroad Company, to establish his
liability for the debts of that corporation
to the Government. Among the auditors
was Mrs. Stanford, to whom the determ
ination of the litigation means much.
Among other Californians noticed were
Senator Perkins, Colonel John P. Irish,
Hon. Tirey L. Ford and George H. Max
well of San Francisco, Thomas H. Bond" of
Lockport and Senator Stewart, besides
Russell Wilson of counsel for Mrs. Stan
ford. Many ladies were present, some of
them being personal friends of Mrs. Stan
ford. The argument was opened by Assist
ant Attorney Dickinson and will
be closed by Solicitor-General Conrad.
Mrs. Stanford was represented by Joseph
H. Choate of New York. The suit was
originally begun in the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Southern District
of California, the -demand being for the
sum of $15,237,000. Both in that court and
in the Circuit Court of Appeals the Gov
ernment was defeated and the case comes
to the Supreme Court of the United States
by appeal from the judgment of the Court
of Appeals against the United States.
The Assistant Attorney-General and So
licitor-General in their argument stated
that the liability sought to be enforced
was created by the law of California, which
it was insisted bound stockholders of cor
porations to answer personally for their
debts in proportion to their holdings of
capital stock. Mr. Stanford was a stock
holder in the Central Pacific Railroad
Company and the Western pacific Rail
road Company, two California corporations
chartered in 1861 and 1862 respectively, and
consolidated by authority of California in
1870 under the name of the Central Pacific
Railroad Company.
It was alleged that these companies be
came indebted to the United States for
bonds of the United States which were
loaned to these companies under the
United States statutes of July 1, 1862. to
aid them in building their railroads; that
the companies became obligated to pay
the United States the amount of these
bonds at their maturity, together with all
ot the interest upon the same, and that all
of the same was an existing indebtedness to
the United States. The bonds loaned to the
Central Pacific Railroad Company of Cali
fornia amounted to $25,885,120; those
loaned to the Western Pacific Railroad
Company amounted to $1,970,560. . All
were thirty-year bonds, bearing interest at
6 per cent. The first four installments of
the bonds loaned to the Central Pacific
Railroad Company of California," amount
ing to $2,36:.,000, have matured, and have
been paid by the United States, and all of
the interest which accrued up to the filing
of the bill has likewise been laid by the
United States, and no part of the principal
or interest has been paid by the corpora
tion. It was alleged that the United States
was bound to pay and would pay. all of
said remaining bonds and interest at
maturity; that the indebtedness to the
United States on account' of those bonds
loaned to the Central Pacific Railroad
Company of California would amount to
$60,000,000, and that on account of those
loaned to the "Western Pacific Railroad
'Company to $5,489,560; that (he said rail
roads were insolvent, were covered by a
paramount mortgage exceeding their
value, and that the United States has no
remedy except against the stockholders of
said company.
The contention by the Government was
that the railroad company became indebt
ed to the United States in the amount of
the bonds issued to them and were per
sonally obligated to nay the same with
interest; that the constitution of the State
of California imposed upon each stock
holder an enforceable personal obligation
for a proportion of all debts and liabili
ties; that the constitution, supplemented
by section 12 of the act of 1861,. under
which the companies in question were in
corporated, fixed a definite liability ; that
by no act of the United States, through
either of its departments of government,
was an intent or purpose manifested to
absolve the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany from the obligations assumed by the
companies or from liability imposed upon
their stockholders, and that nothing can
be found in the course of dealing between
the United States and the Central Pacific
Company to support the inference or
justify the conclusion that the United
States in any manner relinquished or
waived the security afforded by the per
sonal liability of the stockholders.
Mr. Choate, in his argument in behalf of
the defendant, Mrs. Jane Stanford, execu
trix of the will of her deceased husband,
referred to the basis and magnitude of the
suit, saying the magnitude of the claim
was wholly unparalleled. The bill de
manded $15,000,000 against the defendant
and involved the claim of an equal amount
against each of the three associates of the
defendant's testator, amounting to a total
sum of $60,000,000 against four individuals,
solely by reason of their having held stock
in the Central Pacific Railroad Company
and its constituent companies. The de
fense to the suit was based upon four prin
cipal grounds, in support of which it was
argued :
Firstâ The successive acts of Con
gress relating to the Union and Central
Pacific railroads are to be read to
gether, and so read they demonstrate
that Congress intended them to cover,
control and regulate the entire
relations of the Government to all of the
companies, with respect to the subsidy
bonus, without reference to the laws of
any State; that the companies were re
spectively created and adopted as govern
mental instruments for a great National
purpose, in the accomplishment of which
they were to be subject to the . control of
the Federal Government; that in respect
to that purpose the functions, obligations
and liabilities of all the companies were to
be equal and identical, and that as to both
companies the Government looked to the
companies alone for the performance of all
that the acts imposed, and did.not con
template, rely upon or intend the personal
liability of the stockholders of either, but,
on the contrary, did intend that in respect
to the subsidy bonds there should be no
liability of the stockholders of either com
pany to the Government. V*-V"'V 'â '.'"â¢'::'"
Decisions of the Supreme Court of the
United States in support of this assertion
were quoted at great length. Ap.>. .[/.'.
Secondâ ln addition to the fact that no
individual liability was imposed by the
acts of Congress, the estate of Senator
Stanford was also certainly free from any
individual liability for the subsidy bonds
by the law of California in force at the
time of the passage of the act of 1862, which
provided the terms on which the bonds
were to be issued, and also at the time of
the issue of the bonds, from 1865 to 1869.
Thirdâ But even the qualified liability
of stockholders for contracts of the
corporation did not exist under the
constitution and laws of California at
the time of the contract between
the United States and the company,
evidenced by the act of Congress of July
1, 1862, and the written acceptance of its
conditions by the railroad company. At
that time there was no liability of stock
holders whatever, as the Supreme Court
of California has uniformly held. As the
rights of the United States must and do
depend wholly upon that contract, and as
no liability of stockholders to the Govern
ment under the contract could be imposed
by any subsequent legislation of Califor
nia, the bill sets forth no cause of action
whatever.
Fourth Ãut, in fact, by the true con
struction of the acts of Congress there was
no obligation on the part of the Union
and Central Pacific companies to repay
the moneys represented by the subsidy
bonds except in the manner and by the
method agreed upon in the act, which im
posed a statutory lien for the subsidy
bonds without personal liability, and
made the grant of the bonds, as well as
everything else granted, upon condition
merely without personal covenant, prom
ise or obligation to repay otherwise than
in the manner prescribed by the act.
The Government was not dealing with
these parties merely as a money-lender
seeking security and interest. In effect, in
reality, In providing for these great Na
tional enterprises, the Government was
participating, in a certain sense, with
those parties whom it called to its aid to
effect this great National work. The Gov
ernment was to gain great advantages â
right to transmit its dispatches, the right
to send its troops and munitions of
war and other material over the road and
the right to control the operation of the
company in fixing its iares and freights
under certain conditions specified in the
act. It protected its own interests in the
most ample and complete manner. It
could enforce all rights that the
extremest advocate on the part of
the Government could have suggested
at the time of the framing of these
acts, that it would be proper or wise or
advantageous for the Government to have.
All these rights the Government had and
it provides specifically and in detail just
how those rights should be carried out.
No bonds could be wasted. They could
not be taken by the company or squan
dered for its purposes, because the act was
carefully guarded in this respect.
There must be a certificate by the proper
officer of the Government that forty
miles had been nroperly constructed be
fore the bonds of the Government could
be issued therefor. Thus the Government
provided that every dollar which it ad
vanced, every dollar of those subsidy bonds,
should go into the performance of this
work, into the creation of this railroad in
which the Government was so largely and
beneficially interested, as it were, as a part
proprietor by virtue of the rights it re
served in the road.
Mr. Choate will continue his argument
to-morrow.
RAILROADS ARE STUBBORN
Will Not Extend Time on the
Tickets to the Grand Army
Encampment.
Knights of ' Pythias Also Refused a
Low Rate to the Conclave at
Minneapolis.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 28.â St. Paul's re
quest for an extension of the return limit
for Grand Army encampment tickets was
acted upon unfavorably to-day by the
general passenger agents of the Chicago-
St. Paul lines at the special meeting of the
Western Passenger Association. Com
mander-in-chief Walker was officially in
formed by Chairman Caldwell's letter that
the lines "were unable to reach an agree
ment providing for any change from the
original limit. The general sentiment of
the interested lines was that a proper pro
tection of their interests made it imprac
ticable to grant the desired extension."
Mr. Caldwell could not say the senti
ment was unanimous because more than
one of the lines which enter St. Paul
favored a compromise of twenty days,
notably the Great Western, which was the
first to commit itself at Louisville to a one
cent a mile rate if the encampment was
taken to St. Paul. This road may still be
the entering wedge for all the" reads to
give an extension by giving the required
ten days' notice of such intention. * The
prospect, however, is darkened by the as
surance given to the ' Western roads by
the Central Traffic Association roads that
they will not give a thirty days' extension.
The Grand Army officers are also said to
be handicapped in their threat to remove
the encampment to Eastern railroad ter
ritory by the definite assurance given by
the Central Traffic, or rather the new Joint
Traffic Association roads that neither a
one-cent rate nor thirty days' extension
will be given the G. A. R. to hold the en
campment in Buffalo. The Western offi
cials gay they " cannot afford to do more
than they have offered, and that the Grand
Army people are always asking for unrea
sonable privileges.
The Western passenger, agents at their
meeting also took ' adverse, action on the
request of ; the Knights of Pythias .to give
them a one-cent rate for the conclave to be
held in Minneapolis this year. The manipu
lation of party rates/which threaten to
dissolve the passenger part of the traffic
agreement of the Chicago-St. Paul lines,
was seriously discussed by the agents at
the same meeting. All voted to instruct
Chairman Caldwell to communicate with
each road to effect a unanimous agreement
regarding the solution of the problem,
which will likely be the abolition of rates,
with a reservation in favor -of theatrical
companies.

THURSTON ONMONEOE DOCTRINE
/______:â 
In Discussing the Debs Case Allen
Lays the Lash on Judge
Woods.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Jan. 28.â There
were three speeches made in the Senate
to-day on the House bond bill, with the
free coinage substitute,, reported from the
Committee on Finance. Two ,of them
were in favor of the substitute and one
against it. The former were made by
Senators Clark (R.) of Wyoming and
Voorhees (D.) of Indiana; the latter by
Senator Gray (D.) of Delaware. , '
Notice of an amendment was given by
Teller (R.) of Colorado, requiring the pay
ment of '<â  National* bank notes in coin,
when presented for redemption at the
bank of issue. An ineffectual effort was
made to have unanimous consent given to
have the bill voted on next Thursday. The l
objection came from Hill (D.) of New
York.
Turpie (D.) of Indiana, in presenting a
memorial on the subject of the Armenian
horrors, indulged in a . fierce invective
against the Sultan and Mahommedanism,
and Thurston (R.) of Nebraska made an
equally strong representation in favor of
the maintenance of the Monroe doctrine.
The speech was applauded at various
points.
In presenting a petition in regard to the
Armenians Turpie (D.) of Indiana spoke of
the recent outrages upon them and said
that the only charge against them â their
only crimeâ was being Christians.
The time had come, he --aid, when an
official notification should be given to Tur
key and to the Mohammedan church that
they must cease to proselytize by the
sword. The sway of the Turk, he said,
was only endured and supported on ac
count of those international jealousies that
clustered around the trans-Atlantic seg
ment of the Mediterranean called the bal
ance of power in Europe.
The Turks ought to be notified that they
must erase from their book of discipline
that practice of the Mohammedan church
which makes use of arson 'and
murder to suppress the , Christian
faith. And he would have that
notification followed by a shot which
would go crashing through the grand
seraglio. He was in favor of giving "the
sick man" of the Bosphorus the coup de
grace and of ending his life and system by
dissolution and destruction. It was time
that those murderers and assassins should
know "Him who was born to the world at
Bethlehem and was raised at Nazareth,
and that when he comes again to punish
such wretches as those he brings with him
not peace but a sword." **7, './,- ///A.
Mr. Turpie spoke with intense vehe
mence and bitterness, and his speech at
tracted marked attention. T^U;;^;
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska gave notice of
an amendment to the bond and free-coin
age depriving the Secretary of the
Treasury of the power to issue bonds or
other interest-bearine obligations of the
Government, unless Congress shall first
declare a necessity therefor. .â ,,â.'â¢';'
The resolution heretofore offered by
Call (D.) of Florida for a special com
mittee to investigate the case of the im
prisonment of Eugene V. Debs for con
tempt of court was laid before the Senate,
and Call said that he had â  offered the reso
lution at the request of a labor association,
Hill (D.) of New York said that ordin
arily be had very great respect for the
laboring people of the United States, but
was not aware of a communication from
the laboring people asking the Senate for
the proposed investigation. . If it was to
be made he thought it should be by one of
the standing committees of the Senate.
He, therefore, offered an amendment in
structing the Judiciary . Committee to in
vestigate the whole subject of contempts
of court as enforced by Federal courts. -
Call opposed the amendment and spoke
of the standing committees of the Senate
as the sepulchres of popular movements
for reform and of Eugene V. Debs as "a
great leader, a man of power and a railroad
man." â¢_**
Hill argued that, as the question in
volved was a judicial one, it should be re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee. Be
sides, he said, the Debs case had already
been decided in the Supreme Court to the
effect that his imprisonment was legal. ' *
Allen (Pop.) of Nebraska asserted that
the Supreme Court had done nothing of
the kind; it had merely decided that the
writ of habeas corpus did not apply to the
case*. He added that if the Senator from
New York knew anything "about this man
Woods (the United States Circuit Judge
who had imprisoned Debs), if he knew the
stain that hung upon him when he was
appointed as a reward for political trick
ery," the Senator would not give much for
his decision. -
Hill said that he was not called upon to
criticize Judge Woods' decision. It was
enough for him that Debs had appealed to
the highest court of the United States and
had obtained no reiiet.
In the course of further discussion Allen
said that he could not help . being im
pressed with the thought that the Senate
was organized "riot to do business. ". T7'
Gordon (D.) 'of Georgia reminded : the
Senators that the hour had arrived when
the Senator from Nebraska (Thurston)
was to address the Senate. â¢ -A. ;/::;â 
The Call. resolution was thereupon laid
aside Thurston (R.) of â â  Nebraska ad
dressed the Seriate on the question of the
Monroe doctrine. 7 77-
Thurston said that the adoption of the
resolution, reported ; by the Committee on
Foreign Affairs would present a great in
ternational issue which might hold much
of menace to the world's peace. He could
not assume these responsibilities, and dare
not vote for the resolution without first
submitting A some . of the reasons which
seemed to \ make .7 the -path 'of duty plain.
Were there nothing at stake but a mere ad
justment of a boundary line between Ven
ezuela and British Guiana he 7 should
hesitate long before voting to com
mit this 'Government to any interference.
But the present question rose high
above any Venezuelan dispute. ; The Brit
ish Prime Minister had seen lit to officially
declare that the Monroe doctrine . had no
place in the law of nations -and was not
accepted or recognized by the European
powers. The challenge thus broadly
thrown down by Great Britain must be
taken up by this Republic or the Monroe
doctrine was a thing of tbe past. .The
British position bluntly; almost insolently
stated by Lord Salisbury had been reassert
ed upon this floor, clothed in the splendid
rhetoric of the Senator from Colorado.
He agreed with that Senator that this was
no time to stir up public passion ; to appeal
to any prejudice: that might exist against
England ; to fan the flame of any incipient
war sentiment. But he insisted that this
was a time of all. others to call forth the
highest expression of loyalty and devotion
to American institutions; that this was
the supreme hour for a dignified*, positive
and solemn declaration of the American
purpose, clearly, . calmly, deliberately
stated.
Thurston said it was not his purpose to
treat this subject historically or to review
the events which Jed to the assertion of
this American policy in the message of
President Monroe. He could add nothing
in that respect to the exhaustive presenta
tion of the Senator from Massachusetts
(Lodge).
"I am not unmindful," he continued,
"of the seriousness and gravity of the po
litical: situation. We are calling a halt
upon that settled policy of aggression and
dominion which characterized the exten
sion of the British empire from the hour
in which her first adventurous prow turned
to unknown seas. The history of the
English people is an almost unbroken
series of; military achievements. Great
Britain has cleared her pathway into every
corner of the earth with the naked sword ;
she has acquired and held her vast posses
sions by force of arms; she has mastered
and subjugated the people of every zone;
her navies are upon every sea, her armies
in every clime. No nation can lightly
challenge her purposes or arouse her stub
born pride. But does this furnish any
reason why Americans should abandon
any settled policy of the United States or
retire from any position which the honor
of this Republic and the welfare of Amer
ica require that we should assume?
"Great Britain has mistaken the temper
of the people of this country in the past
as she mistakes it now. The English people
profess to believe that they can weaken
our purpose and compel us to abandon the
Monroe doctrine by threast and demon
strations against American securities
and American commercial interests. We
solemnly advise them that our foreign
policy is not a matter of exchange or bar
ter, and no financial panic can ever induce
us for a single moment to lower the stand
ard of our National honor.'
"Sir, believing that the honor of my
country is involved, that the hour calls for
the highest expression of loyalty and pa
triotism; calmly confident of the verdict
of posterity; reverently calling God. to
witness the sincerity of ray purpose, I
shall vote for the resolution reported by
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I shall
vote for it, not as an affront to any other
nation, but to uphold the dignity of my
own. I shall vote for it in this time of
profound tranquillity, convinced that peace
with, honor can be preserved.- But, sir,
I would vote for it just as surely were we
already standing in the awful shadow of
declared war. I would vote for it were the
shells of British battle-ships bursting
above the dom# of the. "Nation's Capitol.
I would vote for it arid would maintain it
at all hazards and at any cost with the last
dollarâ the last. man. Yea, though
it might presage the coming of a mighty
conflict whose conclusion should leave me
without a son, as the last great contest left
me without a sire." V V 7 "]
Mr. Thurston's speech, although pre- !
pared and in type, wis 'delivered without ;
reference to the print or notes. ..The clear, j
ringing tones" in which it was declaimed, \
the unquestioned sincerity of the orator I
and the advanced position assumed by I
him, attracted attention and won admira- !
tion from the Senators on both sides of the
chamber and from large crowds in the '
galleries. The peroration was greeted j
with a round of applause.
At 2 o'clock the Vice-President laid
before the Senate the House bond bill and
the free-coinage substitute.
Jones (D.) of Arkansas, who has parlia
mentary charge of the bill, tried to have !
an understanding arrived at by which the j
bill should be voted on* next Thursday.
Various suggestions were made and modi- I
fications offered, but objection was inter- I
posed by Hill' (D.) of New York, who said
that he knew several Senators who desired
to speak, and he could not consent to the j
agreement until they had an opportunity j
to present their views. He expressed the !
hope, however, that a vote might be had j
on Thursday.
._. - â 
. Jones then gave notice that he would
ask the Senate to remain in session next
Thursday until a vote was reached. .
Wolcott (R.) of Colorado expressed the
hope that the physical test would not be
applied. He had heard it said again and
again that it was. the silver people (so
called) who were endeavoring to stave off
a vote on the bond question; but now it
was seen that it was Senators from the.
East who were procrastinating, and who
were willing to postpone the vote.
Hill asked whether the Senator, from
Colorado { referred to him -as trying to
postpone the vote.
"Certainly- not," said Wolcott, sarcasti
cally. "How could I accuse the Senator
of that when he has just been on the floor
asking for further time." [Laughter.]
Teller (R.) of Colorado gave notice of an
amendment which he. would offer to the
substitute, providing that after the Ist of
July, 1896, all National bank notes shall be
redeemed in coin when : presented to the
banks issuing them, and that banks failing
so to redeem them shall be dissolved. â '.-;
Clark (R.) of Wisconsin addressed the
Senate in advocacy of the free-coinage
substitute. T
Voorhees (D.) of Indiana next addressed
the Senate, also .in j support of the free
col**age substitute. The country, he said,
was in the midst of a, revolution, brought
on by those who plotted against silver. He
characterized as revolutionists the men
who demonetized silver in 1873? *
Voorhees went on to criticize Sherman's
financial record, remarking that the Sena
tor from Ohio believed in "sound money!'
for Wall street, but : not for the soldiers.
The gold withdrawals of the : j last t year, l
Voorhees said, was part of the conspiracy
to compel ; the ; issue of i. interest- bearing
bonds. Ruin had followed in the train of
demonetization. p.;-
Speaking of the Sherman act :he desig
nated it as "the celebrated arid ill-omened
act." Never .before, 7he 7 said, 7 had a
member of a parliamentary body r found
himself compelled, as Senator Sher
man had, to assist in putting to
death his â  own offspring. i That act had
stood openly confessed ;as an unnatural
monster and as a menace to commercial
prosperity. The act repealing the silver
purchase clause had declared it -to; be the"
policy of the United States to 7 maintain
the use of both gold and silver as standard
money, and to coin both gold; and silver
into â¢ money of equal intrinsic ; and ex
changeable value. That policy had received
the: sanction of both Houses of Congress
and had : been' approved by the Execu
tive on November 1, 1893. There
it stood and wojld stand for
ever. That doctrine has been indorsed
and upheld ;. by all the great names in
American history, from George Washing
ton to Abraham Lincoln.: The giants of
other days were all one way on that ques
tion, just as the people 'were, to-day. No
citizen of the United States could be bene
fited by the banishment of silver, its
degradation and destruction, unless He
was the owner and holder of idle money
which he desired to invest in cheap laoor,
in property at half its value or to loan it
at usurious rates of interest.
In conclusion he declared that the Dem
ocratic party grappled with every ques
tion which affected the present welfare of
the people. ' -"
Gray (D.) of Delaware argued against
the free-coinage substitute and in favor of
the proposed bond issue. "Why, he asked,
should not the treasury notes be perma
nently-retired? Why not divorce the
Government from the banking business?
and why not provide a measure of value
the most stable that the civilized world
could command?
After speaking for some two hours, Gray
was catechized by George (D.) of Missis
sippi as to his attitude in regard to the
international coinage of silver. Gray ex
cused himself from going into that ques
tion, as he said he- had sufficiently ex
pressed his views .on that point while the
Senator from Mississippi was joying his
nap." [Laughter.] But ne declared him
self in favor. of relieving the treasury from
its unnatural and obnormal banking func
tions; of retiring the greenbacks and of
â¢restoring the treasury to its natural and
old-time functions. .:â *.â ; 7 :,_;..' â ?'
Teller (R.) of Colorado denied one of
Gray's contentions that gold had not ap
preciated in recent years, and asserted
that the best authorities of the world
agreed that there had been an apprecia
tion of gold from 30 to 40 per cent. .
Resolutions expressive of regret at the
death of Frederick Reymann, late Repre
sentative-elect from Illinois, were pre
sented by Palmer (D.) of lilinois and
agreed to, and at 5:45 o'clock the 7 Senate
adjourned until to-morrow.
SESSION Of THE HOUSE,
Passage of the Diplomatic and Consular
Appropriation Bill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.â In the
House to-day Fletcher (R.) of Minnesota
called up and the House passed the bill
granting right of way to the Brainerd and
Northern Minnesota Railroad through the
Leech Lake and Chippewa Indian reserva
tions in Minnesota.
A joint resolution was passed author
izing officers and enlisted men of the
army to wear the badge of that organiza
tion on all occasions of public ceremony.
A spirited colloquy, in which Dockery
(D.) of Missouri, Richardson (D.)of Ten
nessee, Stone (R.) of Pennsylvania and
Miles (D.) of Maryland participated,
occurred over a resolution providing for an
extra employe in the document-room, at
the end of which the resolution was
agreed to.
On motion of Hitt (R.) of Illinois the
House went into a committee of the whole,
with Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio in the chair,
and took up the diplomatic and consular
appropriation bill. Hitt explained the
provisions of the bill, which, as McCreary
(D.) of Kentucky stated, was with a few
necessary conditions the same bill that is
on the statrite-books for the current year.
McCreary added that in his opinion
every change made in the bill was essen
tial to the welfare of the public service,
and that the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs unanimously agreed to the report.
The bill was passed with only one amend
ment making the appropriation for the re
lief and protection of American seamen in
foreign countries apply to those who may
be shipwrecked on the coast of Alaska.
On motion of Payne (R.) of New York,
the Seriate bill was passed authorizing
the Secretary of State to invite the dele
gates to the International Marine Confer
ence to reconvene in order to further con
sider the code of rules of the road at sea.
By unanimous consent a bill introduced
by Grow (R.) of Pennsylvania, was read
and referred to the Committee on Educa
cation. It appropriated $100,000 for edu
cation of persons, so that they shall be
qualified to teach deaf children to under
stand speech. .
â¢ Hadley (K.) of Illinois announced the
decease on July 14, last, of Frederick Rie
mann, his predecessor from the Eighteenth
District, and as a mark of respect the
House at 2:35 o'clock adjourned until to
morrow.
SUFFRAGE IS DEMANDED.

A Delegation Appears Before the
Senate Committee and Argues
an Amendment.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jam 28.-A dele
gation numbering nearly 200 ladies this
morning appeared before the Senate Com
mittee on Woman Suffrage, of which Mr.
Call of Florida is chairman, and some
twenty of them, presidents of as many
State organizations, argued in favor of
universal suffrage and the adoption of an
amendment to the constitution extending
the voting franchise to the gentler sex.
At its session this afternoon the National
Woman Suffrage Association adopted reso
lutions demanding suffrage for all Ameri
can citizens of the United States â women
and menâ reasonable conditions,
tamable by all as a right and not as a priv
ilege, and rejoicing in the admission of
Utah into the Union as a third woman
suffrage State.
7 The resolutions also demand State, and
National legislation that mothers shall
have equal custody : and control ..with
fathers over their minor children.
This U. evening's session closed the
Woman's Suffrage; Convention. Speeches
were made by Rev. Anna Howard :, Shaw,
Lillie Devereux Blake, Harriet May Mills,

AFTER THE VOTE
ON FREE COINAGE
When the House Tariff Bill
Will Be Reported to
the Senate.
HEAE3) IN COMMITTEE.
An Understanding Reached Before
the Democratic Members -
Arrived. .
JONES OF NEVADA IS FIRM.
' ' *â¢' â¢*
Will Not.Give His Vote on the Measure
Until the Silver Substitute Is
Considered.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Jan. 28.â The
tariff bill will not be reported to tbe Sen
ate until after the vote has been taken in
the Senate on the free coinage substitute to
the House bond bill. The Finance Com
mittee did not take the bill up for consid
eration this morning, in fact it was not re
ferred to at the full meeting, but an under
standing was reached before the Demo
cratic members' arrived at the committee
room. It is apparent that Jones of Ne
vada notified his Republican associates
that he would not give them the vote nec
essary to report the bill until the free sil
ver substitute of the Senate had been
clinched. Immediately after this has been
done the Committee on Finance be able
to report the tariff bill.
A number of matters pending before the
committee were discussed, but no action
was taken. Among the more important
of these subjects was the House joint reso
lution, directing the Secretary of the
Treasury to cause the immediate destruc
tion of all income-tax resolutions and all I
records and statements relative thereto
which passed the House January 20.
The committee also considered Dubois'
bill to facilitate the collecting of revenue
by * providing for the construction and
equipment of sampling works for the sam
pling and assaying of imported silver ores
and other ores containing lead, etc. Both
of these were referred to a sub-committee
for further investigation.
Much of the time of the committee was
consumed in an informal discussion of the
compromise suggested by Gorman as a'
substitute to be reported from the Commit
tee on Conference after the House bond
bill with the Senate free-silver substitute
gets into conference. This proposition, as
indicated in these dispatches of yesterday,
contemplates the issuance of $500,000,000 of
gold bonds with which to retire the Gov
ernment's present gold obligations (green
backs and treasury notes); the declaration
that all bonds now outstanding, regardless
of the provisions of these obligations,
shall be made payable in gold, and the
opening of the United States mints to the
free and unlimited coinage of silver. This
proposition found few friends in the com
mittee.
Vest was vigorous in his opposition, and
other Democratic Senators opposed it be
cause it authorized the issue of gold bonds
and provided for the retirement of the
greenbacks. The Republicans were antag
onistic to a man. The argument was made
that this proposition would only work
harm to the country and was intended
more as a political compromise than a
solution of the financial problem. It was
pointed out by one of the "sound money"
Republicans that it meant simply a gold
basis for the bondholders of the country
and a silver basis for every other class, and
upon such: a groundwork Ihe' financial
fabric could not rest securely. "Of course
this discussion was entirely informal, but it
developed enough, to show that such a
proposition would . find few friends and
many powerful enemies in the committee
of the Senate which dominates its finan
cial policy. .7 T/ AT/
CARLISLE AND GORMAN.
Planning to Carry Out the President's
Financial Views.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 28.âSecre
tary Carlisle and, Senator Gorman have
been in close conference on financial mat
ters. During the past *veek the two have
been in almost daily communication.
Rumors are afloat that Senator Gorman
recommends the plan that Secretary Car
lisle once favored, of authorizing the coin
age of all the silver bullion and the
coinage of the seigniorage. This is
coupled with the proposition advocated
by President Cleveland of retiring green
backs and allowing. National banks to
issue notes up to the par value of the
bonds held by them. A color of probabil
ity is j given to these rumors by the fact
that Senator Gorman, chairman of the
Democratic Steering Committee of the
Senate, had , been sounding Senators
within the last few days on the probability
of such a scheme passing the Senate.

OF ONE COURT.
An Important Ruling in
the Northern Pacific
Receiverships.
IT OUSTS MR. BURLEIGH.
With Him Will Go Many Other
Employes of the Railroad
Company.
AS TO PRIMARY JURISDICTION.
It Is Given to the Circuit . Court
of the Eastern District of
Wisconsin.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 23.â The
Northern Pacific Railroad receivership
case was disposed of to-day by the Justices
assigned to the several circuits in which
were properties of the company. An or
der was signed by each Circuit Judge for
his circuit. It has been to the several
courts of the Second, Seventh, Eighth and
Ninth circuits. The order is as follows:
"It is ordered that with respect to the
proceeding now being carried on for the
foreclosure of mortgages of the Northern
Pacific Railroad Company the Circuit
Court of the Eastern District of Wisconsin
be regarded as the court of primary ad
ministration and proceedings in this court
are auxiliary in their character and in aid
of the proceedings in the court of primary
administration. This court reserves the
right at any time, upon application of any
person interested, or upon its own motion,
to make such orders and decrees as to it
shall seem just for the protection of cred
itors of the railroad company residing
within its jurisdiction."
Justices Field, Harlan and Brewer pre
pared and united in a memorandum of
conclusions as follows:
"We are of the opinion that proceedings
to foreclose a mortgage placed by a rail
road company upon its lines extending
through more than one district, to the end
that the mortgaged property may be effect
ively administered, be commenced in the
Circuit Court of the district in which the
principal operating offices are situated
and in which there is some material part
of the railroad embraced by the mortgage;
that such court should be the court of pri
mary jurisdiction and principal decree,
and the administration of the property in
the Circuit Courts of other districts should
be auxiliary thereto.
"But in view of what has transpired in
these foreclosure proceedings, especially
in view of the fact that a portion of the
line of the road owned by the Northern
Pacilic Railroad Company was, and is,
within the State of Wisconsin at the time
of the filing of the creditors' bill (in which
the trustee in the mortgage was a co
plaintiff), the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company was operating its road through
the Eastern District oi Wisconsin, al
though that part of its line so operated be
longed to another company and was under
lease to the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company for ninety- years; and
in view of the further fact that
the raiiroad company entered its
appearance and assented to the act of the
Circuit Court for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin in taking jurisdiction, and as
such exercise of jurisdiction has been rec
ognized by the Circuit Court in every dis
trict along the line of the Northern
Pacific Railway and by all parties for the
period of about twenty years, during
which many orders in the course of ad
ministration have been entered â we are of
the opinion that the Circuit Court for the
Eastern District of Wisconsin has juris-
tion to proceed to a decree of foreclosure
which will bind the mortgagor company
and the mortgaged property, and ought,
therefore, to be recognized by the Circuit
Courts of every district along the line of
the railroad as the court of primary juris
diction; and that proceedings in the latter
courts, while protecting the rights of local
creditors, should be auxiliary in their
character and subordinate to the proceed
ings in the court of primary juriÂ«diction.
In expressing these views we are not to be
understood as passing upon the proposi
tion advanced in argument, but not neces
sary to be here considered, that it is com
petent for a Circuit Court of the United
States, by consent of parties, to foreclose
the mortgage of a railroad, no part of
which is within the territorial jurisdiction
of said court."
Justice Brown signed a special memo
randum of his views, which ( was as
follows:
"In view of the doubts suggested regard
ing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of
the United States for the Eastern District
of Wisconsin to recognize the mortgage in
this case, and of the further fact that the
business offices of this company have been
and are still at St. Paul, I think the Cir
cuit Court for the District of Minnesota
should be treated as the court of primary
jurisdiction. But as the whole object of
the hearing before the Justices assigned to
the four circuits in whicn the property of
the road is located is to secure harmony of
action, I have concluded to waive my per
sonal views in deference to the opinion of
my brethren and to accede to the recogni
tion of the Circuit Court for the Eastern
District of Wisconsin as the court of pri
mary jurisdiction."
JUDGE H AX FORD RETICENT.
Â£>Â»<-( i <Â« to Discuss the Supreme Court's
liuling.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 28.â The Su
preme Court's decision that the tribunal
presided over by Judge Jenkins of Mil-
Veukee for the eastern district of Wiscon
sin is one of primary jurisdiction in the
-natter of the Northern Pacific Railroad re
ceivership came in the nature of a surprise
to railway officials at this end of the line.
Receiver Burleigh had but little to say,
in'] Federal Judge Hanford, who took
._sue with the Milwaukee jurist, holding
.hat Judge Jenkins' was not a court of
iriginal jurisdiction, is still less commu
licative on the subject of his reversal.
"Now is no time for me to talk," his
Honor observed, and when asked if the
jonterapt proceedings begun some time
igo in his . court against ex-Receivers
Dakes, Rouse and Payne were still pend-
Dg. he replied affirmatively, declining to
nake further comment.
Receiver Burleigh said:
"As I understand the situation it leaves
die parties to the Northern Pacific receiver
ship case (the Farmers' Loan and Trust
Company) to apply to the courts of the
Ninth circuit for the appointment of Judge
Jenkins' receivers; also to apply to Judge
Jenkins for any additional order they may
desire in reference to the receivership."
WILL ASSIST REORGANIZATION.
Receiver Higelow Greatly Pleased Wilh
the Decision.
MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Jan. 28 In Mil
waukee the news of the decision of the
Supreme Court relative to the Northern
Pacific case naturally created a good deal
of interest. Receiver Bigelow said :
"I am naturally delighted with the deci
sion, especially in view of the fact that it
upholds Judge Jenkins in every respect
, and at every "point. In the second place, I
believe the decision is of great importance
and interest to a larce section of the coun
try as well as of great value to the prop
erty interests involved in the road. The
main thing is that it makes one road of the
entire property and does away with all the
unfortunate troubles and drawbacks and
harmonizes all the interests. Yes. it
will undoubtedly greatly assist the
work of reorganization and hasten the end
naturally desired by allâ something that
was practically out of the question with
the conditions as they were when the mat
ter was taken before the Supreme Court
Justices. No plan could be carried out
successfully with divided interests.
"The receivers will undoubtedly have
some important orders and changes to
make immediately, now that they are
placed in full charge of the property, but
as to what those orders will be 1 cannot
state just at this time. It is true there
were matters we naturally desired to dis
pose of for the Dest interests of the prop
erty which was not done while the uncer
tainty as to receiverships existed, and now
our work in the matter is made plain. I
cannot say anything further at present re
garding future plans. The receivers will !
desire to see and carefully read the full j
text of the decision and rulings of the j
court before making any move. Until i
then I must be excused from discussing |
plans."
CAUSED A COMMOTION.
Many Officers Will Lose Their Places by
the Ruling.
ST. PAUL, Minx., Jan. 28.â There is
much commotion on the western division
of the Northern Pacific over the decision
rendered to-day by the United States Su
preme Court. It practically ends the re
ceivership of the Washington, Idaho and
Montana division and ends with it all the
officers and Receiver Burleigh. Mr. Bur
leigh himself must go, and with him his
general manager, George W. Dickinson.
A rumor was afloat here at midnight,
that Thomas Lowry of Minneapolis was to
be made the third receiver with McHenry i
and Bigelow. General Manager Kendrick
will be reinstated as general manager of I
the whole system. McHenry will resign I
his position as chief engineer and devote
his whole time to the receivership. It is !
thought Assistant General Manager Pearce
will be sent to Tacoma to take charge of
the western division of the road.
YET HOPES FOR A LIGHT
Gladstone Thinks the Murderous
Acts of the Turks Will
Be Checked.
The English Government Issues Two
Blue Books on Armenian
â  Massacres.
LONDON, Exg., Jan. 28.â Mr. Gladstone
has written another letter on the Armen- j
ian question, in which, after referring to ;
the murderous wickedness of the Sultan, ',
his absolute victory over the powers and
their unparalleled disgrace and defeat, he '
says: "I cannot wholly abandon the hone ;
that out of this darkness light will arise,
but the matter rests with the Almighty, to
whom surely all- should address fervent
prayers in behalf of his suffering
creatures."
The Chronicle will to-morrow say that
two blue books on the Armenian massa
cres have been issued by the Government.
The first contains the dispatches between
the Consuls and the diplomats, while the
second gives the proces verbal of the Ar
menian Commission. The blue books.deal
only with theSassoun outrages and do not
mention later reports. The Consuls con-
firm the newspaper stories so far as the na
ture of the outrages goes, telling of brutal
tortures, burning alive, the tossing of chil
dren on bayonts, etc., by Kurds and sol
diers.
The long extracts are given from the re
port of the consular delegates on the com
mission to Sir Philip Currie, the British
Embassador to Turkey. This report states
that the.fact that Kurds accompanied the
troops and that no steps were taken to
compel them to withdraw may be regarded
as proved. It must also be regarded as
having been established that the Kurds
and soldiers were the joint authors of the
burning of entire villages.
Moreover, it was not proved that the
Armenians were in revolt. The victims at
Gheliguzan are estimated to have been
about forty. The report does not support
the newspaper stories, which stated that
the victims numbered thousands, but it
protests against the difficulty thrown in
the way of the inquiry and the duplicity
of the Turkish Commissioners and offi
cials.
SMITH'S BILL
MAY GO THROUGH.
COntlnxud from Pint Page.
should be sold on a foreclosure to a com
peting company.
Tweed replied that he did not think it
would make any difference.
Maguire asked lf the Southern Pacific
Company, which controls all of these
roads, is not a close corporation, abso
lutely owned 'and controlled by less than
half a dozen men.
Johnson of California promptly objected
to the question, saying he did not see
what difference that could make. -
Tweed, however, replied that there were
more than half a dozen concerned in the
company.
The inquiry will be continued to-mor
row at 1 o'clock, when Bowers of Califor
nia will address the committee. Those
present to-day included Bowers, Hiiborn,
Barham and Geary. ,
Maggioli Defeats Hatley.
CHICAGO, 111., Jan. 28.â Maggioli won
the tie game that was played off to-night
in the billiard hall of the Chicago Athletic
Association's clubhouse for second place

JUSTICE ACCUSED.
Judge Baker Charged With
a Series of Grave
Offenses.
WILL BE INVESTIGATED.
Collusion, Drunkenness and the
1 Levying of Tribute Are
Included.
EX-CLERK JORDAN'S AFFIDAVIT.
An Inspector From the Department of
Justice Will Conduct an
Inquiry.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Jan. 28.â A. C. Baker
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ari
zona and Presiding Judge of the Third
Judicial District, in which Phcenix is
located, has been charged by ex-Clerk
Louis C. Jordan with malfeasance in office
and cond uct unbecoming a Judge.
As a result of this, an inspector from the
Department of Justice left Washington to
day, and upon his arrival here will inves
tigate the accusations and thoroughly ex
amine the court records.
If this investigation sustains one-half of
the charges, Judge Baker's removal will
be a necessary sequence, as he has been
accused of the gravest offenses in the cate
gory. Included are collusion, drunken
ness, and levying tribute upon his ap
pointees.
It is charged that he opened United
States court when there was no business
on that side of the docket, so that his
clerk and court-crier could draw the $10
and $2 respectively per day. This salary
is allowed by the United States statute,
providing actual business is transacted.
It is also charged that Chief Justice
Baker went about the streets of Phcenix in
a drunken condition" and cursed and
abused members of the Grand Jury, then
in session. This charge is supported by
an affidavit, and in that the witnesses are
referred to.
That these charges are preferred in all
earnestness is well known, as some of the
most prominent citizens in Arizona are
said to be back of them. When seen to
night Judge Baker emphatically denied
them.
SANTA BARBARA SUIT.
! Assemblyman Parker and General Strong
Lock Horns in Court.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 28.â
James L. Barker, Assemblyman from this
district, to-day brought suit against Henry
I Strong, ex-president of the Atchison and
Santa Fe Railroad, to enforce a certain
contract in regard to water supply alleged
to have been entered into by the plaintiff.
' It appears that General Strong, who owns
l a beautiful tract of land in Montecito,
I which was without any water supply, con
| tracted with Barker for two miner s inches
I of water, should the same be developed by
tbe tunnel Barker is driving into the
| mountain range in Cold Stream Canyon,
lor which he was to pay $4000.
Assemblyman Barker, who now has his
i tunnel in 670 feet and who has developed
i twelve inches of water, claims to have se
j cured the requisite amount of water within
; the specified time and fulfilled all the
â¢ other obligations of his contract, but al
, leges that when he tendered the deed to
General Strong the latter refused to re
; ceive or pay for it. This litigation arouses
' unusual interest because of the high stand
ing of the opposing parties.
DEPOSED AT PORTLAND.
Assistant Postmaster Hughes
Has Been Removed for
Cause.
Accused by a Subordinate of Conduct
Unbecoming a Government.
Employe.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 28.â A strange
state of affairs was exposed in the Portland
postoffice to-day when it was announced
that Silvrey Stuart superintendent of the
money-order department, had resigned,
and that C. C. Hughes, assistant post
master, had been deposed to make room
for W. A. Manly, who is to be his suc
cessor.
The cause of Mr. Stuart's resignation is
plainly and emphatically set forth in a
letter to Postmaster Protzman. He says
his salaryâ sloo per month is inadequate
to the responsibility and the work in
volved. But the interesting part of
Stuart's letter, which has been submitted
to the department at Washington, is the
statement of the unpleasant relations that
have long existed between Assistant Post
master Hughes and the postoffice em
ployes and public generally.
Stuart states that Hughes' manner and
deportment have been contemptible be
yond comprehension, and that he
(Hughes (has purposely placed obstacles
in his way for the purpose of forcing him
to resign. Stuart says the assistant post
master is unpopular with the public, which
he has treated so contemptuously. The
latter part of the letter reads:
"He (Hughes) seems, however, to be
quite intimate with two or three Republi
can postoffice inspectors, and, presumably
on their recommendation, a* few salaries
were reduced and a few employes dis
charged, and by the merest accident, I
suppose, no Republicans were hit. This
man Hughes may be a good bookkeeper in
a horsecar barn, but he is out of place as
assistant postmaster, notwithstanding the
highly favorable report to the department
he may have received from his chum,
Inspector W. A. Robinson."
On the strength, presumably, of this
letter Hughes has been requested to step
down and out, which he will do on Febru
ary 1. Stuart is under civil service rules
and Hughes is not. Muni}', who succeeds
Hughes as assistant postmaster, is ex-
Governor Pennoyer's private secretary and
is a Democrat. Hughes is a Republican.
The assistant postmaster was dumfounded
when he was notified to-day of his removal
for cause.

PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 28.â firm of

ing accounts are the causes which led to
the suspension, or rather the turning over
of the stock by a bill of sale to Mrs. F. R.
Wintler. For some time past one of the
firm's heaviest creditors, to whom was
owed $12,000, has been endeavoring to ef
fect a settlement. Failing, the creditor
became importunate, resulting in the fil
ing of papers which virtually place the
firm out of business. It will not resume.
ELOPER H RIVER HEARD FROM.
The Erstwhile Preacher Figures in a
Scandal in Missouri.
PORTLAND. Or., Jan. News has
reached here that Rev. Samuel M. Driver,
the ministerial adventurer who scandal
ized the Methodist'church in Oregon and
California, has turned up in Carthage,
Mo., under the assumed name of Cun
ningham.
Driver fled from a Southern California
town about two years ago with a fair
member of his congregation, deserting his
wife and four children. The woman who
eloped with him committed suicide at
Carthage, and in the scandal which fol
lowed Driver's sensational career in the
West came out. -Ap/Tp -*â ''â * â /':â 
It is stated that Driver drove the be
trayed woman to her death, but before the
Grand Jury could investigate thoroughly
he had disappeared from Carthage. The
couple first lived in Hamilton, Mo., where
Driver worked^ in a lumber-yard and
reached. He is well known on the coast,
In 1889 he was an accredited minister of
the church, and was stationed in Eastern
Oregon and at Union, Idaho. He was
formerly presiding elder of the Eastern
Oregon and Idaho conference.
, Owing to his conduct with women of his
congregations he became involved in
trouble at Astoria, which place he
had to leave suddenly. He was in Port
land for a time," but was requested to leave

Palo Alto's Brawny Men Wish to Give
Berkeley a Hard Contest.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Jan.
28.â Track Captain Toombs has issued a
call to all track men to meet next Satur
day in the Encina gymnasium. This will
be the first opportunity afforded for judg
ing just what material Stanford has this
year and what each man intends to do.
The management is hopeful of getting a
large number of athletes interested in
order to give Berkeley a hard fight with
out causing her to seek such an antagonist
as Yale.
The rainy weather is seriously interfer
ing with preparation of both baseball
players and track athletes.
Stanford recognizes the fact that her
baseball prospects are decidedly blue this
year. Only three of her last year's nine
have returned to college, and there is no
money and little enthusiasm for getting a
team together. Still there are hopes that
some "phenom" may turn up and change
the aspect of affairs before the semester is
too far gone.

HITES COVE MINE HORROR
Two Men Killed and Another
Injured by a Premature
Explosion.
Bodies of the Unfortunate Pair Torn
to Shreds by the Terrific
Blast.
MERCED, Cal., Jan. 28. â William
Sterne of Mariposa and Joseph Kluce of
San Francisco lost their lives, and a third
man whose name could not be learned was
made a cripple for life, by an accident at
the Hites Cove mine at, 4:30 o'clock this
morning. The particulars of the disaster
are meager, as the mine is twenty-five
miles northeast of Mariposa, the nearest
telephone station.
The miners were preparing cartridges
for a blast, and a short distance from
where they were engaged at this work was
a pile of 100 pounds of giant, powder.
From some cause an explosion occurred,
and the concussion reached the giant
powder magazine and touched it off, blow
ing Sterne and Klute to atoms, the third
man escaping with severe wounds about
the body.
William Sterne was 28 years of age and a
native of Mariposa, where he leaves a
mother, two brothers and four sisters.
Young Sterne's father, now deceased, was
for seventeen years underground boss of
the mine during the working of the prop
erty under the original locator, J. R. kites
of San Francisco.
WASHINGTON'S SENSATION.
Supervisor Casselman's Official Acts to
He Investigated.
WOODLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â road
funds in the Supervisorial district of Ezra
Casselman of Washington will be investi
gated by the Yolo County Grand Jury,
now in session. Nearly a score of wit
nesses have been ordered to appear before
the inquisitorial body, and many more
may be subpenaed.
Mr. Casselman, an ex-oflicio road mas
ter, is compelled to pass upon all claims
for road work performed in his district,
and it is charged that he has knowingly
permitted certain contractors to rob the
county treasury. For a long time past
prominent residents of the Washington
district have complained that the road
funds were being juggled, and Justice Gill
has openly accused Supervisor Casselman
of irregularity. It is alleged that faulty
work has been accepted and paid for with
out being inspected. When these attacks
were first made on Mr. Casselman he said
they were actuated by spite; and contended
that, as all claims submitted to him were
sworn to, he could not refuse to indorse
them. Interesting developments are antici
pated.
PLACERVILLE MJNE FATALITY.
John Toole Killed a Few Hours After
He Had Been Given Employment.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., Jan. 28.â An
accident occurring at the Taylor mine
yesterday resulted in the death of John
O'Toole a few hours after he had applied
for and been given employment. O'Toole
went on the. noon shift at underground
work. At 6 o'clock the signal was given
to hoist, with four men in the skip.
When up 100 feet O'Toole put his head
forward, but was warned by a companion
that, being in close quarters, he must*
lower his head, but the warning was not
heeded. Again looking forward, his head
struck a timber and was almost severed
from the body.
The man at the hoist felt the concussion
and immediately lowered the skip, which
arrived at the bottom of the shaft in a
moment. O'Toole was dead.
The * unfortunate man was buried at
Georgetown at the expense of the Taylor
mine. He was aj-ed between 35 and 40
years, and was a stranger to Placerville^
He is said to have a sister in San Fran
cisco.

CURES THE SICK
OF STOCKTON
A New Schlatter Who Is
Said to Have Worked
Miracles.
PRAYER IS HIS REMEDY.
Sufferers From Disease Made
Well Without Recourse
to Medicines.
POWER TO RESTORE THE MIND.
His Treatment in the Case of an
Insane Woman Watched
With Interest.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 28.â The home
of Rev. Donald L. Monroe on San Joaquin
street is becoming a center of attraction
for the afflicted who look for relief through
the faith cure theory.
Rev. Mr. Monroe is a deposed minister
of the First Presbyterian Church, and the
circumstances of his retirement some five
years ago are still fresh in the minds of
the people of this city.
The minister made a confession in the
pulpit regarding his tendency to err, and
the acknowledgment was not appreciated
by the members of the congregation. He
was retired on the strength of his tempta
tions, and not for his actual sin.
The faith-cure theory had been ex
pounded by him frequently, and when he
retired he proceeded to devote himself en
tirely to the teaching of this idea.
He began holding services weekly at his
home and soon attracted quite a following
among the women. Of late he is said to
have effected a number of cures, and the
news of his success seems to be arousing
much interest outside of his small band of
followers. He always hold 3 his services at
his house, but has not ceased to mingle
with his former associates in the ministry.
The devotion and faith of his flock in him
seems to be wonderful, and they never
cease to talk of his great piety and power
to cure all evil the flesh is heir to.
Among those who were attracted by the
reports of his healing was Mrs. J. P. Dow
; die of Encinal avenue, Alameda. This
! lady has a sister, Mrs. J. R. Searles,
j who has been an inmate of the Stockton
Â Asylum for eighteen years and who was,
at the time of her affliction, the wife of a
citizen who has since become known as
one of the "borax kings." The lady from
Alameda came to Stockton on last Satur
day, went to the asylum and took her
sister from the place in which she had
be'en confined so many years.
The afflicted woman was placed under
the care of the faith-healer, and it is re
ported that she is already showing some
signs of improvement. The interest in the
i case is not confined to Rev. Air. Munroe's
i followers.
The minister gives no medicine, but sub
stitutes earnest prayer for liquid or pow
dered drugs. 'His followers have so much
faith in him that they predict that the un
fortunate woman will be restored to her
reason, and they are assisting him in his
supplications for a victory over the men
tal disease.
FIRE AT OAKHALE.
Twenty Buildings, Comprising a China
town, Are Hestroyed.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 28.â Fire de
stroyed the Oakdale Chinatown last night.
It started in one of the principal Chinese
stores, and all efforts to stop its spread
were unavailing. The whole Chinese
quarter was soon enveloped in flames.
About twenty bouses occupied by the
Mongols were burned to the ground. The
loss in buildings was not great, because
they were mere shanties, the principal loss
being the personal property of the Chi
nese. -./â

FLIGHT OF A SHU W AH WOMAN.
: Postmaster Axtstin in Pursuit of His Wife
and Children.
PORT ANGELES, Wash., Jan. 28.â
Postmaster J. P. Austin of Shuwah passed
through this city this morning on his way
to Texas. He will take the shortest route,
for he is chasing a runaway wife who has
three days' start in the race. Mrs. Austin
suggested last week that her husband go
on a hunting trip into the mountains. The
unsuspecting postmaster thought the plan
an excellent one and left the next morning
for a four days' bunt. On returning
Saturday to his home he found that hia
,wife and three children had left for Texas,
and just before leaving Mrs. Austin had
sent a deed from her husband to herself to
be recorded, by which she becomes the
owner 'of all their community property.
Mr. Austin was greatly exercised over the
affair, and says he will pursue her and if
possible recover his children, if nothing
more.

KNOWS THE LAW
Outlaw Schneider Conducts
His Own Defense
in Court.
VERSED IN LEGAL LORE.
He Skillfully Cross - Examines
the Witnesses for the
State.
TELLING TESTIMONY GIVEN.
Driver Howard Identifies the Prisoner |
as the Man Who Halted His
Stage.
UKIAH, Cat,., Jan. 28.â The preliminary
examination of John Schneider, charged
with robbing the stage running from
Ukiah to Harris on January 15, Mas be
gun to-day. Schneider is the man alleged
to have shot ex-Sheriff Standley while the
latter was trying to capture him, and he
is now also charged with robbing the
United States mail, in having stopped the
AVillits stage on the last day of 1895 and
ordered the driver to throw out the mail
sacks. Under this last charge he is now
in the custody of Sheriff Johnson as a
United States prisoner. The charge under
which he is heing examined is brought in
the name of the State of California, and
will be tried in this county if he is held to
answer.
Only three witnesses were examined to
day â Theodore Howard, the stage driver
who was held up: J. S. Hart, agent for
Wells, Fargo & Co., and C. Tecumseh
James, chief clerk in the exprÂ»ss office, to
whom is entrusted the work of preparing
express boxes for the several stages run
ning from Ukiah. and who delivered the
express box to Howard on the day that
the stage was robbed.
From James' testimony it was learned
that the contents of the box consisted of
only $15 in coin and a small parcel of
merchandise. Howard positively identi
fied Schneider as the man who held him
up, and could not be shaken in his state
ment during the searching cross-examina
tion to which he was subjected by the de
fendant.
Bandit Schneider had refused the services
of an attorney, and conducted his own
case. His cross-examination of Howard
was exceedingly clever and his numerous
objections, on legal grounds and couched
in legal phraseology, inclines one to believe
that he is not entirely unacquainted with
the courts. From the questions put to
Howard by the defendant the officers are
more confident than ever that Schneider
had an accomplice in his crimes.
The examination will be resumed on
Thursday.
A EUREKA MAN'S PLIGHT
Supervisor Acheson Learns That
He Is Not a Citizen of
This Country.
Discovers After Many Years That
His Father Had Never Become
Naturalized.
EUREKA. Cal., Jan. 28.â Rumors of
disqualification which were circulated
against Supervisor Acheson of the Fifth
District before his election in November,
1895, were to-day verified in a dispatch
which Chairman W. J. Swortzol received
from Mr. Acheson himself, who is now in
Detroit, where he has been for some time
looking up his father's naturalization pa
per*. The dispatch contains notice of the
resignation of Mr. Acheson, which will be
tendered on his return to this county.
- Mr. Acheson, who c_ me when a boy with
his father from New Brunswick to Michi
gan, always believed himself a citizen by
virtue of the naturalization of his father, !
who, it seems, bad only declared his inten- !
tions, supposing there was no other bar
against citizenship.
About .twenty years ago Mr. Acheson '
came to Humboldt County and immedi
ately took up redwood timber lands. Ibis
land has since become very valuable and .
whether or not it will be forfeited is a
question. Some discussion is also going
on in reference to the legality of the pro
ceedings of the board while Mr. Acheson ;
was a member of it. The general opinion '
of the bar is, however, that what services
he performed as ade facto officer are legal
and binding. As soon as Mr. Acheson's
resignation is handed in Governor Budd I
will be asked to appoint a successor, who
will hold the office for five weeks, in which i
time a special election can be called and a \
permanent official be chosen to serve out !
the unexpired term of three years.

To the Mayor of the City of Brownsville : In
consequence of the gross misconduct, to wit,

The Mayor called Councilman Brown to

life; how he had striven to sever its
clutches, but how at times he was forced

NORTH YAKIMA COINERS.
Two. Men Arrested With Bogus Money in
Their Possession.
NORTH YAKIMA; Wash., Jan. 28.â
Money has been more plentiful here in the
last few weeks , than for some time pre
vious and among the coin floating around
were numerous counterfeit dollars. Dep
uty United States Marshal Catron and his
assistants have been keeping their own
counsel, but watching affairs very closely.
Yesterday, after securing what is con
sidered certain evidence of guilt, Catron
arrested Thomas Taylor and Deputy
George Guilland arrested Joe Taylor on
the charge of issuing counterfeit money.
The coins were from an excellent die, of
the date of 1891, and had a true. ring, but
were light in weight and had that oily
feeling denoting glass in the composition.
Joseph Taylor returned here a short
time ago from Spokane, where it is sup
posed lie obtained the spurious coins. The
prisoners are between the ages of 20 and 30
years and are the eons of a well-known
farmer living in ..the Cowichee Valley.
Other officials, however, believe that the
Taylor boys are in league with a gang of
counterfeiters somewhere in this locality.
MODESTO'S FAMOUS SUIT.
Governor Budd Appears as Counsel in the

MODESTO, Cal., Jan. '23.â Another
chapter of the noted Tynan case is being
enacted before the local Superior Court
with Governor Budd as a participant.
Dr. Thomas E. Tynan, a wealthy citizen,
disappeared mysteriously from Modesto in
October, 1892, shortly after a suit had been
brought against him by two stepdaugh
ters, Mrs. T. Wood side aud Mrs. Euquay,
for a division of property.
Offers of rewards and the searching of
detectives failed to find him, and he was
declared legally dead in September, 1893.
Then the step-daughters were awarded
three-fifths of his belongings and the case
was carried to the Supreme Court, it
being remanded back for a second trial.
The doctor returned home in September,
1894, having been in Boston in seclusion.
Now the second trial is. going on before
Judge Minor and a jury under the title of
E. A. Woodside et al. vs. T. E. Tynan.
Plaintiffs are represented by Governor
Budd and Messrs. Hazen and Maddux,
and the defendants by D. If. Delmas of
San Francisco and 'Messrs. Hatton and
Fulkerth. The property involved is valu
able, and the case will undoubtedly last

Secretary Thomas Fottrell, of the Im
provement Club, stated that be had re
ceived a number of offers of financial aid
from persons who had seen the scheme
mentioned in The Call, and that he had
written to Ireland, where a Mill Valley
citizen was now traveling, in order to
ascertain what the cost of securing the
birds and shipping them to California
would be.
The interest taken in the matter is sur
prising, and without doubt Mill Valley
will have some beautiful birds as soon as
proper arrangements have been completed
for their care and propagation.
MONTE VISTA HOTEL SOLD.
E.L. Hueter Will Reopen- and Greatly
Improve the [Hostelry.
MILL VALLEY, C,al., Jan. 28.â The
Monte Vista Hotel has been purchased
from Fred Kruse by E. L. Hueter of San
Francisco. Mr. Hueter will build a num
ber of additions to the hotel, one in par
ticular being a large glass-covered' dining
room. Cottages about the hotel grounds
will also be erected. - â  ,
The Monte Vista Hotel has from the
start proved a failure. Mr. Kruse built
the borel in 1893 and before the summer
was over he went into insolvency. Since
then others, have attempted . to run the
place upon a paying basis, but failure has
marked each attempt.

THREE DAYS OF PLEASURE.
Elaborate Preparations : Have Been
Made for the Entertainment of
Visitors.
. ~~
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Jan. 28.â Citrus
Fair enthusiasm is at a fever heat. Such
bustle, push and vigor as is seen on all
sides augurs well for the ultimate success
of the exhibition.
The stormy weather of the past few days
has interfered greatly with the gathering
of the oranges and lemons to be placed on
exhibit and in many other ways hindered
the work of preparation; still, from the
appearance of the pavilion to-day, every
thing will be in apple-pie order for the
grand opening to-morrow. Many willing
hands have the fair in charge and will al
low nothing to hinder the successful frui
tion of their labors.
The decorating committee, under the
direction of T. B. Wilson and S. R. Sample,
has transformed the large apartment, with
artistic taste, into a mass of citrus colors â
orange, green and white. The entrance to
the Pavilion is guarded by three large
palm trees, the ticket-office being on one
side and the directors' room on the other.
To the right or north side is situated the
candy booth, exhibits, bandstand and vis
itors' reception-room. The west side will
hold the orange-selling booth and an elab
orate exhibit from Los Aguajos rancho,
the country seat of H.J.Crocker of San
Francisco. The south side is reserved for
the wine exhibits. F. Albertz, the pro
prietor of Moulton Hill vineyard, has had
two assistants constantly employed for a
week on his elaborate display of wines and
grape syrup. The Cloverdale Wine Com
pany and the Italian-Swiss Colony will
have excellent wine exhibits. A portion
of the south side is also reserved for an ice
cream booth and restaurant, both to be
run in connection with and for the benefit
of the Citrus Fair Association.
J. Harry Kleiser, a young man of marked
ingenuity, is devising a mechanical display
to he placed near the entrance, and it is
destined to attract much attention. Two
long counters in the center of the pavilion,
running almost its entire length, are to be
used exclusively for the display of citrus
fruits, and will form the chief attractive
feature of the fair.
The ballroom is on the second floor, and
there the three days' festivities will termi
nate in a dance on Friday night, under the
auspices of the Cloverdale brass band. Be
sides this organization there will also be in
attendance at the fair the Ukiah cornet
band. Thus there will be no lack of musi
â  cal attractions.
The pretty village of Preston, two miles
north of Cloverdale, will make a splendid
showing in oranges and lemons. In past
exhibitions the growers of that section
always carried off some of the leading
prizes. Most of the Preston oranges are
grown in terraces on the hillsides. It is a
pretty and inspiring sight at this season of
the year that greets one who drives
through the valley, gazing up the hill
side and seeing the golden nuggets glisten
in the sunshine from behind a dark green
foliage of orange leaves. And real nug
gets they will prove to be, when in a few
years Cloverdale and vicinity sends its
wealth of citrus fruits to Eastern markets.
The cheap rates on the San Francisco
and North Pacific Railway will bring many
visitors to the fair. Inquiries for accom
modations are being received daily in great
numbers by lodging and boarding bouse
proprietors.
END OF THE STORM.
Rain Ceases to Fall and Danger of Floods
Is Passing â Stock Losses in Yuba'
County.
MARYSVILLE, Cal., Jan. 28.â As a re
sult of a renewal of the storm the Feather
River gained three feet during the last
twenty hours. The Yuba River is ris
ing slowly. There is very little snow in
the mountains. The general opinion is
that the worst is passed. The First
Ward residents of Marysville were in
convenienced by slough water, but the
new pumping plant will remedy that in a
few days. The prospects for more rain
ure good, but it .will probably not be as
severe as that of last week.
One half the acreage of Sutter County is
flooded with tule water and backwater
from the Sacramento River. Tbe ranches
south of this city are flooded as the result
of the breaking of private levees. Many
hogs and sheep were drowned during the
storm. The rainfall to date is 16.55 inches.
SANTA BARBARA'S LOSS.
The ' Ocean â¢ Boulevard Ham aged by an
'.'/Af Unusually High Tide:
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Jan. 28.â The
extraordinarily high tide of last night,
aided by a strong shore wind which set in
with the second installment of the storm,
sent breakers dancing over Santa Barbara's
joy and pride, her $60, 000 ocean boulevard,
flinging spray over the row of electric
light poles which line it, washing away
the sand foundation and cutting a great
hole into tho bitumen pavement at one
point, which a corps of workmen repaired
to-day.
There was an unusually low tide this
afternoon and the high water of last
night will no doubt be repeated to-night.
So great is the alarm felt over the situation
that a guard of volunteers will be on watch
to-night. -r . - â¢ -

rains, and much ' valuable property - de
stroyed. â  :y.: â ;
y Not only has - property been ruined, but,
according to the reports, sheer good luck
is all that precluded several; fatalities.
One well-known settler spent two days in

his way to freedom through the shingles
of his cabin. Another was rescued after
floating about for two or three days on the
wreck of his dwelling.
â  The vicinity is famed for the severity of
its - rainstorms, hut never before was the
deluge of such magnitude as has been the
case in this instance. Particulars, owing
to the isolated location of the Ozette coun

â¢â  ' NAPA, 7 Cal. ; , Jan;" 28.â The dredging
done on the Napa Ri/er last fall has done
a great* amount of good, as can be seen
this winter. A storm of a few hours will
raise the river to overflowing, but a few
hours after the storm ceases the river is
back in its banks again..
This evening the river is high, but is
going down rapidly and is doing very little
damage at present. Several boats were
washed down stream' yesterday while the
river was running wild. Most of the dam
age done during the storm was to young
fruit trees, many of these being uprooted;
STOCKTON NOT IN HANGER.
Waters Must. Rise Considerably Before
Flooding the City.
STOCKTON, Cal., Jan. 28.â The water
raised here two and a half feet during the
night and ten feet .during the storm.
There is no immediate prospect of a flood.
The water in the Stanislaus at Knights
Ferry was bank full last night. At Linden
the water from Mormon channel was run
ning over the town. At the San Joaquin
bridge the water is rising now and is at the
fourteen-foot mark. It can rise nearly four
feet more before reaching flood height at
that point. Residents on the island are all
safe so far.
Safe Along the Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28.â There
has been no material change in the high
water situation since last night. The
river rose slightly between daybreak and
noon. There is no danger on the Sacra
mento side, as the water finds escape
through breaks in the Yolo side into Yolo
basin. ;,-\ .-.: I; ,Â»â *-.
A gentleman from . Androus Island
stated this morning that all danger of
overflow in the island district is believed
to be past, though there is a little fear
that the water may rise to-night.
Knights Landing Is Safe.
WOODLAND. Cal., Jan. 28.â storm
is at an end, and is succeeded by a heavy
fog. All the creeks are beginning to re
cede, and the danger of a flood at Knights
Landing is growing less. The water is
higher in the Yolo basin than ever before
known. The high lands are all right, and
no serious damage has resulted. A large
force is at work on the Yolo bridge, and
railroad travel will be resumed this after
noon. '" .â¢.'-:â¢> ?â¢;

BIG BLAZE AT WOODLAND.
Incendiaries Apply the Torch
I to Shepherd & Collum's
Woolen-Mills.
Second Attempt Within Twenty-Four
Hours to Fire the Buildings Is
Successful.
WOODLAND, Cal., Jan. 29â a. m.â
The Woodland Woolen-mills, owned by
Shepherd & Collum, are burning. Flames
are pouring from every window, and the
immense structures cannot be saved. The
fire was started by incendiaries. The mills
are valued at $45,000 and all will be lost.
At 2:30 o'clock the work of destruction
was almost complete. The walls were fall
ing, and the flames lighted up the country
for miles around. Not a thing has been
saved from the mills, the machinery and
stock on hand being destroyed.
The mill property was owned by Mrs.
Emma Laugenour, who holds an insur
ance policy for $16,000 upon it. The
lessees, Shepherd & Collum, are insured
for $11,000. "T. "*7 7 ' â¢:â ?; *
The woolen mills were Woodland's chief
industry, employing a day and a night
force of men, and being crowded to their
full capacity. â  Their loss will be a serious
blow to the town. Â'"-" **
This was the second attempt to destroy
the mills made since yesterday morning,
and it has resulted successfully. The
first attempt was made just before
daylight yesterday, i The torch was
applied, but the firebugs were frustrated
through the presence of mind of Ed
Shirley, the nightwatehman. The bark
ing of a dog attracted his attention, and
looking in the direction of the bleaching
room he discovered a flash of fire, as though
issuing from a sudden explosion.
. Shirley ran in and discovered a blaze
coming through the floor. He broke two
hand-grenades, which had the effect of
checking the flames, and the prolonged
screeching of the whistle brought assist
ance and the fire was effectually extin
guished.
An investigation disclosed the fact that
a pole, on tho end of which had been tied
a lot of lighted papers and rags, had been
thrust under the dyehouse through one of
the air holes in the foundation. About 4
o'clock in the afternoon two strange men
had applied for work at the bleaching
house and had been refused. They are
suspected. â¢ â¢' ***_..,. **

MURDER TRIAL
Jurors Selected to Decide
. the Fate of William
Christ.
MRS. HART TESTIFIES.
â .â¢â '._**"â """, 'AÂ ' *
Says the Defendant Acted Like a
Crazy Person Before the
Killing.
WANTED HIS WIFE TO DIE.
Had Offered the Witness a Pistol With
Which to Shoot Mrs.
Christ.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 28. The
jury which has been chosen to try William
Christ for the alleged murder of his wife
was completed this morning, George Boyd,
A.L.Warren, 0. C. Smith, G. D. Went
worth, C. B. Strong, F. B. Adams, William
Vought, E. Heinrich, C. Kellogg, ,J. C.
Scroggs and Max Ginsberg, being the
chosen ones. The selection of the last
three jurors occupied the forenoon and the
afternoon session was consumed by the
District Attorney, who made the opening
statement for the prosecution. 77*7 7
The Prosecuting Attorney outlined the
points the State would attempt to prove
and stated that facts had been learned
proving that the statement of Christ was
farcical in the extreme. The weapon that
ended Mrs. Christ's life must have been
discharged within twelve ,or ; fourteen
inches of her head, as her face was badly
powder- burned; whereas, if Christ's story
was to be believed, when the weapon was
discharged it was at a distance of at least
ten feet. ,
The bullet then would have taken an
upward course, while the report of the
autopsy proved that the missile ranged
downward. He stated that all the con
tents of the room would be offered in evi
dence; that photographs of the face and
baud of the dead woman, showing the
powder- marks, would be presented, and it
would be shown that defendant had made
very contradictory statements as to how
the homicide occurred.
At the close of the District Attorney's
address Mrs. Frances E. Hart was called
to the stand. Mrs. Hart is the wife of
William Hart, the man of whom Christ
was jealous, and which jealousy, it is
believed, led to. the killing. Mrs. Hart
testified that she found some "gushing"
poetry in her husband's pocket. It was in
Mrs. Christ's handwriting and signed with
her first name, and she took it to Christ
and showed it to him. .- 7 7
That afternoon Christ called on her and
said that he had been thinking the matter
over and .if she thought her husband had
any improper relations with his wife she
could take his revolver and go and kill
Mrs. Christ. He then began to ramble,
talking like a crazy man He said that he
had saved and denied himself so that his
wife could have everything she wanted,
and that he had treated Hart like a brother
and now both had deceived him. His ex
pression was wild and the witness was
afraid of him.
The next witness, George Ogg, told of
how, on the day of the killing, Christ had
come to him and told him of the poetry
that Mrs. Hart had shown him as having
been found in the pocket of her husband's
coat, and which had been written by his
wife. Ogg ! read the poetry . and tried to
make matters all right by telling of a
drama which he had once seen, where a
man wrongfully accused his wife of un
faithfulness.;
Thomas Eby, a clerk in the Controller's
office and a neighbor of Christ's, told of
having heard the deadly shot fired and of
having met the prisoner, who told him
that he had accidentally killed his wife.
Part of the furniture of the room was
brought in and arranged and the witness,
stepping down to it, retold the story of the
shooting wnich had been told to him by
Christ. Eby will go. on the stand for
cross-examination to-morrow morning.

COLVILLE JAIL TRAGEDY
I , Convict Niese Cuts the Throat of
His Wife and Commits
Suicide.
The CouDle Had Been Convicted of
Beating Their Boy to Death
-*-" < With a Club. ~
SPOKANE, Wash., Jan. 28.â Adolph
Niese, who was held, with his wife, in the
jail at Colville for murder in the second
; degree, they having beaten their little boy
i to death with a club, to-day cut his wife's
I throat with an old razor and then his
| own. He is dead and she will die. The
killing was done so quietly that no one
j knew of it, and when the jailer went to
[ open the cell at 2 o'clock he found the
j floor covered with blood. Niese had a
deep wound in the right side of the neck,
severing all the arteries and the veins in
the throat, and he died in a few minutes.
His wife was also cut. on the neck and
suffered greatly from loss of blood. She is
not dead, but there is no hope of her re
covery. A number of letters were left
addressed to different persons who had
been interested in the trial.
The crime for which Niese and his wife
were convicted was a most brutal one. A
son about 12 years of age was deliberately
beaten to death, and when the neighbors
inquired the cause of the boy's death they
said he had fallen down a bank.
At the trial the evidence proved that
they had killed him, and further that they
had been implicated in the murder of
Niese's first wife in Wisconsin. The only
reason they were not convicted in the first
degree was that one of the jurors had
scruples about hanging a woman and a
compromise of murder in the second de
gree was accented. â "- 'â 'â ;- >'; - :* "â¢

the crime in jail to-day they had been sen
tenced to tweuty years each in the peni
tentiary. . '

Railroad Company Thinks
Trackwalker Murphy-
Is at Fault.
HE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
The Southern Pacific Censured
for Its Recent Economi
cal Policy.
INQUIRY BY A CORONER'S JURY.
The Engineer of the Santa Cruz Train
Found to Be Seriously
Culpable.
â¢
At the investigation held at the office of
General Manager Kruttschnitt yesterday
the responsibility for the Santa Clara
crossing collision of Saturday was fixed.
It was decided that the blame lay entirely
with Engineer Steward of the Monterey
express and Flagman Ernest Kohloff and
Engineer James Stanley were exonerated.
The solution of the question was ob
tained largely from the testimony of
Flagman Kohloff. He was put through a
most trying ordeal by means of diagrams,
but the officials found it impossible to con
fuse him or make him change his original
statement, which was as follows:
He had given the signal to the narrow
gauge train to go ahead, when he saw the
Ex-Judge John F. Finn, Who Has Returned _*om Europe After Three Years in an
Improved State of Health.
[Sketched from life by a "Call' artist]
broad-gauge coming at a speed that would
preclude any probability of its st6pping
before reaching the crossing. He realized
the terrible danger of the situation, and
at once swung the semaphore so as to dis
play the "stop" signal to the narrow
gauge train, which was. however, already
well under way, and the "go-ahead" sig
nal to the Monterey express. It was only
by such a course on his part, it is now ad
mitted, that a much more serious collision
was avoided.
The Southern Pacific is apparently
straining every nerve to fix the responsi
bility of the terrible Baden disaster, in
â which Engineer Keyer lost his life and
several others were seriously injured.
Their energies, it appears, are mainly di
rected toward John Murphy, who was
partly in charge of that particular section
when the fatal washout occurred. Every
man remotely connected with track-walk
ing or inspection between San Francisco
and Baden has been temporarily sus
pended pending the result of the investi
gation.
A meeting of the chief officials of the
road was held in the office of Division Su
perintendent Frazier yesterday. They
decided among other things that the track
had been most excellently inspected and
that the disaster was due to the Spring
Valley or some other water company,
building a bulkhead not strong enough to
withstand an extraordinarytfun.
Tnis bulkhead gave way thirty or forty
minutes after the track had been thor
oughly inspected, precipitating a volume
of water against the embankment, which
from sheer force tore away the dirt from
under the ties and rails. This last could
and did happen according to the company i
within a brief period of eight or ten min
utes.
To substantiate this position they have
the sworn statement of the section boss
and his assistant. Murphy, who was im
mediately on the scene, has not been
called, nor is it likely that he will be for
some days to come, if at all. Mr. Murphy,
it seems, has been put on double duty
since the wholesale discharge of track
walkers some six weeks ago. His labors
begin about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and
continue until 8 the next morning. In
that time he is supposed to cover four and
a half miles of track, and attend to
seventeen lights. For this service he re
ceives $175 a day, on an average of 10
cents an hour.
An employe of the road, who for fear of
decapitation desires his name omitted at
this time, makes the following interesting
statement: 'Ay'/A/Ty
The track from San Francisco to San Mateo is
actually inspected but once in every twenty- [
lour hours. Every morning at 9 o'clock a man I
leaves the Sixteenth-street station, requiring!
about three hours to make the trip. He is
also paid %l 75 a day. Prior to the wholesale
discharge trackwalkers lour men were em
ployed to cover the same territory, thus reduc
ing the chance of accidents to a minimum.
This bicycle track-inspector era* practically the
only person who made pretense of formally
going over the road on Sunday last. His in
spection m addition to being of a flying char
acter was at least nine hours before the fatal
accident occurred. - â â¢: *
i
In spite of statements that may be made to
the contrary, no employe of the company, was
seen near where the wreck took place from the
time the regular track inspector passed over
the road on his wheel until called to the scene
at 6 o'clock Sunday evening. Mr. Murphy had
not yet reached Baden, and neither the section
boss nor his assistant passed him. If, as they
claim, they were at the fatal embankment
forty minutes prior to the washout, then
Murphy could not have been on the track at
all or he would of necessity have met them.
This is not, however, in any sense true.
Murphy was attending to his regular duties
and was within half a mile of where the wreck
occurred when he met a gentleman who told
him that the water was flowing over the em
bankment and urged him to flag the south
bound train, which he knew was due about
that time. He endeavored to do this, but the
engineer either did not see the signal or else
he misunderstood it.
The fact of the matter is, it was sheer negli
gence, due to the strict economy practiced by
the railroad/that caused the accident. One
man for l?! 75 a day is now required to do the
work formerly distributed among four. Their
pay was .fl 00 each.- With this kind of a re
duction all along the line it is easily seen -what
the company saves daily, at the imminent risk,
however, to the lives of the traveling public.
The Coroner of San Mateo County has
summoned a jury, and is making a thor
ough investigation into the causes leading
up to the accident. The proceedings yes
terday consisted of a statement made by
H. Tilton of Baden to the effect that he
told Murphy to signal the train. Murphy
denied this flatly. The investigation will
be resumed today.

Ex-Superior Judge John F. Finn, who
has been absent from the City for three
years, most of which time he has spent in
various parts of Euro_e, has returned, and
is at the Palace.
The Judge is looking much improved in
health and has gained twenty pounds in
weight. â ;**â  77 Ti
"When I left here," said he, "my health
was very poor. That was the reason I re
signed from the bench. It seemed to me
that I might never recover it, but the rest
and recreation changed me, as it does most
men under such circumstances, and I soon
began to feel vastly better.
"After Mrs. Finn and 1 had been for a
little time at our old home in Central New
York we went abroad. Some time was
.pent in London, Paris and Rome. We
spent tw*> winters on the Riviera. Alto
gether the experience was in the highest
degree plea sant. The soft climate of Italy
did much for me.
"I found more industrial progress in
Germany than in any other country.
The country seemed very thriving. As
far as manufactories are concerned I think
it now takes the lead. There was a solid,
substantial look about everything, too.
Some of the greatest business men of the
globe are to be found in Germany. The
people there are economical, shrewd and
hard to surpass when it comes to conduct
ing large enterprises,
"I was greatly interested in England,
too. Though the country does not seem
to have the prosperity of Germany it nev
ertheless shows all the substantial qualities
for which Great Britain is noted.
"One singular thing was called to my
attention while in England, and that was
that the population had increased finally,
notwithstanding all the migrations to the
colonies, to more than that of the whole of
I* ranee.
"In spite of the pleasant time I had
abroad I am more than delighted to be
again back in San Francisco. A man's
home is where his friends are, and though
on my return to New York I stayed some
time at my old home there I was still anx
ious to again get back to this coast."
The Judge's face is full, and he looks
better than for several years prior to going
abroad, though there is a little additional
touch of trust to his beard.
Why He Was Blade Attorney-General.
Governor Culberson of Texas thus ex
plained to a ; Washington Star reporter
how he entered politics and obtained his
first ottice, that of Attorney-General.
"I had been practicing, law," he said,
"and thought I had â¢â¢; made about enough
reputation to justify branching out. I did
not expect to be nominated, but I thought
it would be a. good introduction to start
with a race for the Attorney-Generalship.
George Clark, one of the ablest lawyers in
the country, was my opponent. He was
placed in nomination by a brilliant speech.
while my friend who proposed my name
neglected to mention my legal attain
ments. It looked dark for me, when a man
from the panhandle arose and said:
'"Mr. Speaker, they say Clark's a great
lawyer. ; I come with proxies from my end
of the State all in my pocket, an' was noti
fied to vote for Clark. But I know no one
had any idee he was a lawyer. This State

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, ; 1896.
U. S. GRANT IN BRONZE.
A Remarkable Image Obtained
by Sculptor Rupert
Schmid.
HISTORY OF THE MONUMENT.
The Unveiling at Golden Gate Park.
A Bust of Pope Leo XIII 'â */
on View.
The colossal bronze bust of General TJ.
S. Grant for Golden Gata Park has been a
long time coming to San Francisco, but
The Call is able to give the gratifying
news that no city in the United States has
a better or truer image of the general in
bronze than that which may now be seen
at the studio of the sculptor, Rupert
Schmid, on Van Ness .venue.
As a likeness the work is superb. The
strong, characterictic features of Grant,
the eyes, expanse of forehead, the firm,
tenacious chin, the resolute set of the
mouth and the pose of the head, are re
produced by the artist with marvelous
accuracy. No one who had the privilege
of knowing Grant personally and who
made a study of his features will dispute
the assertion that the image is almost per
fect. A-.PAB:
The general was not in good health
when he sat at his home in New York for
the sculptor, but his frame had not then
been wasted by the disease which caused
his death some time later. Prior to the
final sitting Mr. Schmid had made a close
study of the general's features and the
countenance was impressed on his mind.
Mrs. Grant and her sons, together
with Leland Stanford and others who
.were familiar with the general, were
highly pleased with the model.
About one year ago the figure was sent
to Munich along with other models to be
cast in bronze, and the bust of the general
was remarkably well cast.
Of the members of the Grant Monument
Committee, appointed from the committee
of one hundred in 1885, the survivors are
not many. Of the large amount of money
subscribed less than $2000 was collected.
Since then a surplus of $400 from the
Fourth of July Committee of 18S6 has been
raid into the fund. A subscription of
$100 was also paid. After the death of Le
land Stanford the committee was in a
sense disorganized and no effort was made
to collect subscriptions. The amount col
lected was deposited in the Anglo-Califor
nia Bank, and it is understood that the
bank will allow interest on the deposit. :
Mr. Schmid, the sculptor, has received
$1500 on account, and there is due him on
his contract the further sum of $1000.
Aside from the bust, he modeled the in
signia, or cluster of war trophies, to rest
on the granite base of the monument. The
trophies consist of cannon, musket, flag,
standard, eagle, hat, shield and sword.
The cluster is artistically woven in bronze.
Bronze plates bearine inscription of
battlefields will adorn "the shaft. These
decorations recount Belmont, Fort Donel
son, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chattanooga,
Wilderness, Petersburg and Appomattox.
The height of the bust is 3 feet 8 inches.
The insignia of arms occupies about equal
space. As tbe monument will stand steps
will lead to the granite base. . On the base
the bronze cluster or insignia will be
placed. The monument proper is ten feet
high and will rest on four cannon balls and
the bronze bust will surmount the shaft.
â¢ Theodore Reichert has received direct
and positive assurance that the money re
quired to place the monument in position
and defray expense of ceremonies attend
ing the unveiling will be forthcoming at
once.
While all the details have not been set
tled, it is understood that the monuments
will.be placed on the knoll or eminence
near the aviary in tbe park and not far
from the Star King statue. It has been

suggested that the unveiling ceremonies
should take place April 22 nextâ Grant's
birthdayâ - that the surviving mem
bers of Grant's family shall be earnestly
invited to be present.
"Vacancies in the old committee caused
by death or removal from the City may be
filled by active citizens.
Grand Army posts, the Loyal Legion.
Sons of Veterans and other patriotic or
ganizations will probably join the com
mittee in preparing and executing a pro
gramme of. ceremonies worthy; of San
Francisco and of the illustrious American
whose memory is to be honored by the
monument.
Itis suggested that a special invitation
be sent to the President of the United
States, through a committee who will urge
him to attend the unveiling. v . '*â¢'
The first steps toward a monument in
memory of General Grant were taken at a
Chamber of Commerce meeting July 24,
1885. An executive committee -to arrange
Grant obsequies in this City.was then ap
pointed by Mayor Bartlett. The commit
tee consisted of H. L. Dodge, Claus
Spreckels, J. B. Stetson,- A. J. Bryant,
Stuart M. Taylor, Charles Clavton. W. L.
Duncan, Irving M. Scott and *W. B. Far
well.. On July 29 the : committee was
authorized to receive ' subscriptions ' for : a
monument, but it does not appear, that any
subscriptions were taken â¢ under this au
thority, i ,_ . . â *,
The executive committee on August 20,
1885, organized the Grant Memorial Asso
ciation, consisting of 100 citizens. Among
the r attendants : at the 7 meeting) of the
executive committee were: A Washington

It is certain that subscriptions were re
ceived, but how much was subscribed is
not known. The treasurer, P. N. Lilien
thal, and the secretary, Theodore Reich
art, are supposed to know how much was
collected.
The statement is made by Mr. Reichart
that many of the large subscriptions re
ported were uncollected. The revenue
received came mainly from small contrib
utors. In due time a statement of affairs
will be rendered. The report of the secre-
taiy and treasurer will be awaited with
considerable interest. -yy. ;

cies. 7
John A. Percy, as Guardian, Has Peti
tioned the Court for Permis
sion to Sell. ;,

tioned the Superior Court to be allowed to
sell "personal property belonging ;to his
wards. The personal property referred to
_*__*s*_s_"3s_aa__Â»M_*__^"-:- - r â  ' . â 
is the interest of each in the Fair estate.
Petitions are made on behalf of seven
Fair children, sons and daughters of
.lames H. Fair, who was the son of Thomas
Fair, James G. Fair's brother, and on be
half qf the six Lundy children, sons and
daughters of Mary Margaret Lundy, who
was a daughter of Thomas Fair. To each
family was left $10,000 to be, equally di
vided, and this left the share of each of
James H. Fair's children at $1111 11 and
the share of each of Mrs. Lundy's children
at $1428 51.
After stating that under either will of
James G. Fair.they are entitled to the same
amount, the petition further says:
That there It also further litigation now
pending affecting the said estate of James G.
Fair, deceased, and that it is proDable that the
settlement and distribution of said estate will
be greatly delayed, and that the said ward of
your petitioner, unless a sale be made as here
inafter prayed for, will for several years be
kept out of whatever share in the said estate
he may be entitled to under any will of said
deceased, provided' that it shall "finally be de
termined that said deceased died testate; but
li it shall finally be determined that said de
ceased died intestate said ward, not being an
heir at law, will receive no part nor portion of
the estate of said deceased.
Continuing, the petition states that even
should a will be admitted the share of the
ward of petitioner will not exceeed $1111 11,
and "responsible persons" have informed
the petitioner "that they will presently
pay the said sum of $1111 11 for whatever
interest said minor may have under any
will of said deceased as beneficiary or
otherwise." This refers to one of the Fair
children, but all the petitions are alike,
except in names and amounts.
The offer will not hold open forever, the
petitions say, and the heirs feel it is better
to accept the amount ' and release their
claims. This, it is said, means simply
that the claims are being bought up by the
estate in order to have the entire property
concentrated.*

gists sell it. V: Hardly a day passes but somebody
asks me about No-To-Bac, so -I- don't want you
to hesitate to use these lines in any way that
you think will make known "to suffering hu-
manity the happiness | that \ there lis in No-To-
Bac for the many men with nicotinized brains
and weakened- resolutions if they will only
makeup their minds to save the waste of vital
powerâ to say nothing ""of ; the moneyâ
going up into smoke and out in tobacco spit."

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
"We are counting on Kentucky.
The monopoly is fighting for its life
now.
The lobby war horses are crazing in the
blue grass region.
The railroad choir is saddest when it
sings of "The Old Kentucky Home.''
Unless the monopoly heeds the danger
signals ahead the whole caboodle will be
ditched.
When railroad bosses attend to politics
more than to business accidents will
happen.
Already that much boasted flying squad
ron is lost to sight and isn't even to mem
ory dear.
The powers of Europe may have the Sul
tan on a rail, but they are not taking him
anywhere.
The Southern Pacific of Kentucky must
either get out of politics or be forced to go
out of business.
Huntington fights hard for his funding
bill, but he lets everything else on the rail
road go to smash.
Between the Senate and the House the
doctors disagree, but the people will de
cide in November.
The more the Senate talks of compro
mising the silver question, the more it
compromises itself.
Oh, say can you see through the dawn's
early light some sign in the heaven that
the sun is still there?
Congress should keep its hands off the
railroad and compel the railroad to keep
its hands out of Congress.
Five railroad accidents in less than ten
days are emphatic notices to Huntington
to mind his own business.
All other nations content themselves
with talking, but the Turk and the Russian
keep the buzzsaw running.
Congress calls upon Europe to protect
Armenia, but, of course, Europe will ask
why Congress doesn't help.
Of course John Bull would like an alli
ance with Miss Columbia, but this is the
ladies' year to do the proposing.
If the Senate prefers to be a debating
society rather than a legislative body, the
next topic for discussion should be Cuba.
The Sutro street railway is now running
to the Cliff, and in the meantime Hunt
ington's big road is caving down the bank.
"While the flood of public sentiment rises
around all the tracks and ways of the mo
nopoly the engineer in charge had better
go slow. 7 ..'â¢- 1
It is astonishing how many grave and
reverend Senators we have who continue
to reiterate their belief in bimetallism and
the gold standard.
From the recent action of Congress it
appears we may have a hand in the slicing
of Turkey, providing the Russian bear
hasn't already taken it in.
The House Committee on Pacific Rail
roads has referred the refunding bill to
Hoke Smith, but all the same the people
will have the last say about it. *
If the conflict of telegrams goes on much
longer in Cuba we may be able eventually
to recognize the belligerents, but we will
never be able to recognize the truth.
Where there are so many railroad acci
dents there is surely some one at fault,
and, moreover, the fault is not always that
of the men to whom the accident happens.
If Huntington had expended on his roads
in California the money he sent to Central
Africa the tracks and bridges would not be
giving way every time we have a rain
storm.
Secretary Morton has committed much
greater offenses than that of refusing to
distribute the seeds that Congress â¢ pro
vided for, but all the same the Senators
were perfectly right in roasting him for
that. .-â¢/,:.
Despite the Kaiser's letter, the flying
squadron and all the bluster and blow of
war, the Transvaal incident seems to have
closed up by shutting a prison door upon
a solitary California miner who had noth
ing to do with it. That's funny.
The Cloverdale Citrus Fair opens to-day
and will continue for three days. Excur
sion trains will be run for the benefit of all
who wish to enjoy the pleasure of a holi
day amid the display of midwinter fruits,
and tbe festival will no doubt be liberally
patronized. 'Ay â < ;-/
There is talk in Chicago of urging
Cleveland to send Potter Palmer as Em
bassador to Germany, and if all that is
wanted is a man rich enough to give balls
and learned enough to judge dry goods it
might be just as well to relieve Chicago
for a time of Mr. Palmer's presence.
Among tbe almanacs and political regis
ters issued for the current year none is
more carefully compiled or contains more
information of general interest pertinent
to the coming Presidential campaign than
that of the Chicago News. It contains 456
pages, is well printed and gives a generous
amount of space not only to statistics, but
to an impartial statement of the principal
issues now before the people. *
THE AEMENIAN EESOEUTIONS.
The action of the two houses of Congress
in passing a concurrent resolution express
ing the earnest hope that the powers of
Europe will take decisive measures at once
to check the outrages committed by the
Turks in Armenia will have no other effect
than that of raising the question how far
the United States would be willing to take
part in the affairs of Europe and Asia.
It is clear that if as a nation we chose to
exert any direct influence in Europe we
could do so with great force and effect at this
time. "We could without trouble arrange
just now almost any kind of alliance we
chose with Great Britain or with Russia,
and perhaps even with both. Recent
speeches of members of the British Cabi
net and the prevailing tone of the London
press make it certain that country would
gladly hail an alliance with us on any
terms we should think if worth while to
offer. From Russia, of course, nothing
has been heard, for that is not land of
free speech, or of much speech of any kind,
but her historic friendship with us is still
unbroken, and there is no reason to doubt
that her statesmen would be as willing as
those of England to welcome us to an
alliance that would give us a potent, if not
a dominant, voice in the great councils of
the nations.
The situation in fact is such that if we
chose to assume the responsibility the
United States could at this time stand
forth as the arbiter of- the destinies of the
Turkish empire. The powers of* Europe,
after all the efforts of their diplomatists,
have been unable to reach an agreement
upon which they can take action. This
means, of course, they are' so equally di
vided neither side dares to make a move,
and as consequence if the United Stutes
added her strength to that of either side,
it would be able to go forward with such
an assurance of victory in case of war
there would probably be no danger the
other side would venture upon war.
Against the exercise of the power which
this condition of affairs places in our hands
there is opposed our traditional policy
founded upon the warning of Washington
to beware of entangling alliances with
foreign countries. That policy we have
kept inviolate up to this time. We were
invited to take part in the Berlin treaty
which arranged Turkish affairs after the
last war between Russia and that country,
but declined to do so. Thus we have no
direct responsibility in what is going on
now, and there was logic in the argument
of those members of Congress who opposed
the concurrent resolutions on the ground
that to advise the parties to the Berlin
treaty after we had refused to take part in
it would be an impertinence.
The logic of events, however, is much
stronger than the logic of the schools.
The concurrent resolution has passed both
houses of Congress, and the President
will lay it before the governments of the
great powers. The United States has at
last made her voice heard in the affairs of
Europe. It is not a strong voice at pres
ent. It does no more than make a request.
It implies no promise of an alliance or even
of any help to such powers as are willing
to grant the request. It will have, there
fore, but little effect in helping Armenia,
but it is certain to raise new questions in
the minds of far-seeing diplomats and lead
them to consider how soon the United
States may be expected to take an active
part in the world's politics, and how far
she may go when she begins to move.
A CHANGE OF FRONT.
The introduction by Supervisor King of
an ordinance licensing pool-selling requires
explanation on several different grounds.
In the first place the licensing of any occu
pation or business is a recognition of its
legitimacy. Not long ago some of Mr.
King's confreres in the Solid Eight were
defending their proposition to prohibit
pool-selling everywhere within the City
limits on the ground that it was immoral,
If it was immoral then it is so now*, and
hence it is proposed to license an immoral
practice. Of course, it was never for a mo
ment believed that this excuse for attempt
ing to "cinch" the racetracks in retalia
tion for the popular movement against
downtown poolrooms contained the small
est element of sincerity, and even had that
charitable construction been placed on the
attitude of the Solid Eight it would have
been a proclamation of the stupid folly
which animates that compact.
In tbe second place.it looks strange that
Mr. King, immediately on the defeat of
thar, proposition by the defection of two
members of the Solid Eight, should have
introduced the stultifying license proposi
tion, when the presumption was that this
defection would remain permanent so far
as 'Supervisorial protection of the down
to" wn poolroom infamy was concerned, and
that the new ordinance drawn .in the in
terest of these dens could not be passed.
The situation is exceedingly complex. It
might be assumed that Mr. King, in his
desperate eagerness to prevent the extinc
tion of the downtown dens, has introduced
the licensing ordinance ' merely to give
them such longer time for plundering
boys, clerks and women as will be gained
by the routine which the ordinance will
have to take before it comes up for final
passage, but that explanation does not
seem to be fully satisfying.
Meanwhile Supervisor Morgenstern, who
voted against the suppressing ordinance,
and Supervisor junker, who declined to
vote, deserve the thanks of the com
munity, and judgment in their cases with
regard to further affiliation with the Solid
Eight, in other matters may well be sus
pended until some overt act is committed.
It is true that after the lirst break which
they made some weeks ago they returned
to the fold, but at the last pinch * they de
serted it, and they deserve all commenda
tion for that.
It should be borne in mind, too, that the
ordinance prohibiting pool-selling alto
gether was against the existence of the
downtown poolrooms, and there \ may be
some so heartless as to intimate not: only
that the defection is explainable on that
ground, but that . Supervisor King knpws
whence he will receive sufficient support
for the new ordinance which he has offered
and which will permit the downtown dens
to flourish and rob under the sanction of
law. 7 â¢'â z/7T.
BLEEDING KANSAS.
The cad experiences of Kansas, as re
lated in Tuesday's Call, by B. F. McLean,
member of the City Council of Wichita,
should prove a warning to other States
which run after strange political gods. He

strong local exercise of persuasion. But
changes introduced under such circum
stances must of necessity be ; transient.
The harm of them is illustrated in the case
of Kansas. They impose hardships which
do not exist in other parts of the country,
and people injuriously affected will seek
easier conditions elsewhere. "Wherever
they go they carry with them and spread
with increasing dimensions and volume a
bitter hostility to the practices which drove
them away.
The Populists, who have contributed so
generously to the retrogression that has
overtaken Kansas, embody in their very
elaborate and comprehensive scheme some
excellent propositions, but |as the people
are not generally willing to accept them
their enforcement brings discontent and
disaster. A political party can never be
great or powerful that is not born of the
desire of approximately half the people of
the country for the adoption of a certain
policy. In other words it must be repre-
sentative rather than dictatorial; it must
follow not lead."
That explains the vitality of the two
great parties of this country and the fail
ure of Populism wherever it has been tried.
It is well to have reformers in the world,
for they exercise an influence for good
where they are held in judicious bounds.
It is only when they organize independ
ently, instead of trying earnestly and in

the ranks of great parties, that they are

THE EEMEDY OLEAE.
M. M. Estee, in a communication pub
lished in Tuesday's Call, quotes from the
Congressional act of March 3, 1887, which
authorized the Pattison investigation into
the affairs of the aided railroads, and
shows that it provided clearly for a pro
cedure that renders the consideration of a
funding bill by Congress impertinent and
useless. That act specifically authorizes
the President, in the exercise of his dis
cretion, to direct the Secretary of T the
Treasury to pay off the first mortgage,
and provides that he may then proceed to
foreclose the Government's mortgage, and
that any money accumulated in the sink
ing fund may be applied to the purchase
of the first-mortgage bonds.
The point raised by John T. Doyle should
not be lost sight of in this connection,
namely, that the validity of the first
mortgage bonds is open to attack, Mr.
Doyle insisting that the conditions of the
act authorizing their issuance wer<"* not
complied with. Probably the right pro
cedure would be for the Government to
bring an action to test the validity of the
bonds and place the amount of their pur
chase in escrow pending the determination
of the matter, and then proceed with the
foreclosure of its own mortgage. .'/.".'
The main point, however, is that Con
gress has already legislated this whole
subject out of its bands and into those of
the President. Such legislation was net
really needed, as the case is plainly and
simply that of foreclosing a second mort
gage after first paying off the first.
Under all the circumstances the people
will be forced to conclude, if the funding
bill is passed, that it will be more from a
consideration of Mr. Huntington's in
terests than those of the country. The
attitude of Congress is already assuming a
scandalous aspect. Mr. Huntington in
person, flanked with a numerous, able
and persistent lobby, is boldly and openly
on the ground interviewing Senators and
Representatives. That is lobbying. If he
had confidence in his own cause he would
be content to present his case, as he prop
erly might, before the committees having
the matter in charge. We seem to be on
the eve of a National scandal, and the
President has the power to put an end to
it by doing what the law authorizes him to
do.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Hugh McDonald, the mining man, who re
turned recently from the East and England,
has during the last fortnight visited Tucson
and other points in Arizona in reference to
some mining property. there. He returned only
a aay or two ago.
Recently Mr. McDonald and James Salee,
formerly one of the owners in the noted Iron
Mountain mine, bought the Copper City mines,
on Bulton Hill, Shasta County. " It is spoken of
as a big property. ; ;.
"We are now. driving two tunnels," said Mr.
McDonald at v the Palace yesterday. "One is
the old tunnel, which is now. extended a dis
tance of 700 feet, and ; the other is a new one,
and is 275 feet. . It is a crosscut tunnel on the
vein, tapping the same vein as the old one.
"We are making a big mine. There is in the
old tunnel a spur vein of $100 ore. It is gold,
silver and copper."
Mr.; McDonald, in -company with ex-Judge
Cleary of Leadville, some time since effected
the sale of the old Iron Mountain mine to Alex
ander Hill, Mr. Fielding of London and others.

A FORGOTTEN WAR.
Our little war with the Falkland Islands
seems to be entirely forgotten, writes S. G. W.
Benjamin in the New York Sun.' It is true
that it was not of long duration and may ap
pear insignificant compared with some of the
conflicts in which our country has engaged.
But its real importance lay in the fact that it
indicated the spirit which at that time per
vaded our councils, a patriotic, sentiment
shared, if, indeed.it was not stimulated, by
that great soldier and President, Andrew Jack
son. As such the incident is worthy of being
recalled at a time when the patriotic fervor of
the people of the United States has been re
kindled by the possibility of hostile complica
tions with foreign nations.
The Falkland Islands lie in 43 degrees south
latitude ana northeast of Cape Horn. They
have a growing value for their seal and other
fisheries, as well as because they offer a con
venient rendezvous to vessels cruising in the
South Atlantic. After various political vicissi
tudes they were aoanaoned by the British Gov
ernment in 1774, although the usual emblems
of sovereignty, flagstaff, flag and coat-of-urms
were singularly left there, as if with the inten
tion of resuming control at a more convenient
time. The years went by; the whalers and
sealers of nil nations continued to rendezvous
at the islands without having to pay port dues
or encountering any ostensible authority.
At last it occurred to Buenos Ayres that here
was a territory of several thousand square
miles which, in default of any other proprie
tor, might well belong to her. She fortified
her claim, however, by assuming that she in
herited the long- forgotten claim of Spain, as if
Buenos Ayres nad any more right to that
claim ihan all the other States which had once
formed part of the Spanish dominion in South
America. Be this as it may. in the year 1829
Don Luis Ver net was commissioned "by the re
public of Buenos Ayres as "captain-general or
Governor of the Falkland Islands.with full pow
ers to seize and. to hold the islands for that
republic against all and sundry who might
dispute his title. To give emphasis to his
broad commission he was to wear a uniform
stiff, with the usual large proportion of gold
lace displayed . by Amerieo-llispano uni
forms. A small military force and several can
non also accompanied the Governor, without
which neither commission nor uniform would
have availed. Don Luis carried with him full
authority as well to seize, hold, confiscate or
exterminate ail fishermen or traders, together
with their vessels and cargoes. In a word, he
was supreme dictator of the Falkland Islands
and the waters thereto adjacent.- Don Luis
safely arrived at his destination and imme
diately took possession *"in the name of
the great Jehovah" and the republic of
Buenos A res - ' A fort being constructed, and
the guns mounted, his next proceeding was
to seize three American sealers that unsus
piciously, entered the port. They were the
superior, the Harriet and the Breakwater.
Ihe first was sent by I Don Luis to the Pacific
after seals, while her Yankee crew was landed
by force on Staten Island, near Cape Horn,
and left there to collect seals for the Governor
J'on _,vis. he Harriet, for some reason which
does not appear, was dispatched to Buenos
Ayres lor condemnation.. But the Breakwater
succeeded in making her escape and brought
to the u te d States the news of this unex
pected and ; high-handed attack on ; Ameri
can citizens and . property. Andrew
Jackson was not the â¢ * man to endure
lor a moment such trifling T with the
leathers of the American eagle. He did not
stop to parley with the Government at Buenos
Ayres;, to exchange diplomatic notes and pour
parlers; Jo endure the backing and filling, ex
penses, shillyshallying promises and lingering
delays not uncommon on such occasions, and
commonly submitted to by -weak administra
tions that do not understand the rights of their
own country or their, own minds. . The admin
istration of Jackson was not of that flabby sort.
He proceeded directly ad rem. -â¢ -â â â¢>
_ The United States suip-of-war Lexington,
captain Duncan | commander, was ordered to
sail without delay for the Falkland Islands aad
declare war on his Excellency, the Governor
Don Luis Vernet, in - his capital, situated on
the chief port of the aforesaid islands. | Captain
Duncan touched first atStaten Island to rescue
the crew of the Superior and relieve them from
acting any longer as the slaves of a foreign
tyranny. He then steered for the Falklands,
where he arrived December 28. 1831. There
was no time lost in negotiations. Captain
Duncan landed a' force and immediately
moved on the enemev's works, which
promptly surrendered. The ' guns of the
fort were spiked and the garrison stripped
of their arms. Restitution of all the American
property was then demanded and immediately
enforced. In conclusion. Captain Duncan
secured the persons of the Governor and six of
his chief advisers and transported them to
Buenos Ayres, to be tried for the outrages they
had committed against the United States. The
Government of Buenos Ayres professed the
greatest indignation with what it was pleased
to term an almost irreparable affront. But
there the affair ended, for Andrew Jackson,
then President, was a man who appreciated
the fact that the President of the United States
has ho higher duty than to protect American
citizens rights and property in foreign parts
without delay and without quailing.

OUR MISSION.
When we were boys at school we were taught
that to be successful in life we must be diligent
and take advantage of all the opportunities
which our instructors so kindly placed in our
way. We must also be truthful and honest in
all our dealings with que another in order to
win the respect and confidence of our fellow
men. But when we reached the age of discretion
what did we find, and what has been our experi
ence ever since?. Did we find culture and truth
seated in the high places of our land, or was
power everywhere in the hands of ignorance
and fraud? Did we find administrators of the
public money who could prevent a wandering
hand from stowing it In their own pockets?
Did we find the cold shoulder turned upon the
rogue or life made any harder for the villain?
No; we found that life was only hard for the
poor, and the cold shoulder was only turned to
its fellow as it peered out of a ragged coat.
Even so were the illusions of childhood swept
aside by the cold, cold blasts that cross the
rough pathway of the man.
Now, we regard the newspaper as having a
mission in life beyond the mere collection of
dollars for advertisements and the retailing of
filth for the gratification of the prurient, and
we shall put our shoulder to the wheel with all
the strength we have in the interests of a bet
ter order of things. We shall do all we can to
make life uncomfortable for ignorance and
villainy, and strive to the utmost of our power
to give enlightenment and truth a chance. This
is the only cause we have to advocate. We
are pinned to nobody's coattails, nor do
we take our opinions from any one else. We
think what we choose and say what we please,
but the things that please us are just those
which we believe to be for the permanent wel
fare of humanity, and we are resolved to give
them ventilation. There is only a spot here
and thereâ about as scarce as trees on " the
Colorado desertâ where the truth can be heard.
Everybody who has a mind capable of think
ing has sold it to somebody for whom nature
has forgotten to make this provision, and
ignorance and rascality are having all the fun.
Ail we can do may not amount to much, but
whatever it does amount to will be thrown into
the scale that holds culture and truth.â Marin
County Herald. â¢
A LADY'S APRON.
A full apron that will cover the entire dress
and with large sleeves that fit comfortably
over dress sleeves is a garment indispensable to
every woman. This design is in three pieces,
besides the sleeve. Front is seamless, hanging
straight from the shoulders. The back is in
two pieces, buttoning in the center. The
sleeves are the bishop shape. -77:
Plain or striped ginghams make most ser-
viceable aprons. Such fabrics as lawn lor
nainsook may be used if something more
dainty is desired., Â .â .â â :,â â 'â â 
Lounging or bath robes can be made after
this same design by cutting the back in one

It is desirable also for night dresses, which
are dainty and comfortable made in this way.
A deep frill of lace or embroidery may be used
to finish the neck and may be substituted for
cuffs on the sleeves.

Courts op Equityâ R. D., Haywards. Cal.
There are two kinds of lawsuitsâ actions at law
and suits in equity. An action at law is a suit
commenced to recover a sum of money or the
possession of specific property. It is always
tried before a jury, unless the jury is waived.
A suit in equity is one brought to prevent aa
injury or to secure more perfect justice than a
money judgment would give. A suit to obtain
an injunction is an example of the first class
named and a suit to compel a party to make a
deed of land is an example of the second class.
A suit in equity is always tried without a jury,
although the court may, In its discretion, sub
mit some of the questions of fact to the decision
of a jury. On account of the distinction there
are two kinds of courtsâ courts of law and
courts of equity. The United States courts are
both courts of law and of equity, the separa
tion being preserved by the differeuce in the
forms of procedure. On the equity side they
follow the ancient forms of chancery, but on
the law side they follow the forms and pro
ceedings of the law courts of the State within
which they sit. The Superior courts of Cali
fornia are courts of equity as well as of law.
Stone Ageâ G. S., City. The name of tho
age of stone is given to the period when
weapons and implements were made of stone,
amber, wood, bone, horn or some easily
wrought material and during which very little
or nothing was known of metals. During this
era the people, few In number and savage in
their habits, clothed themselves chiefly with
skins of animals.' They buried their dead in
large sepulchral chambers, covered by whet
has been called cromlechs or girdled round by
the unhewn stone pillars called the druidical
circles. The bodies have most frequently been
found unburied, often with rude urns beside
them. The stone age has been divided into
two. the paleolithic and the neolithic. Tha
word age, in this sense, is improperly used (by
an unfortunate transfer from the Scandina
vian archaeology)] since it has no reference to
chronology, but simply denotes the stage at
which a people has arrived in its progress to
ward civilization. There are tribes yet in their
stone age. Neither do the more primitive im
plements necessarily disappear wholly on the
appearance of those of a more advanced age.
The phrase ston 2 age or stage, therefore, merely
marks the most primitive period. The present
age is the age of progress.

A FAMILY OF SAILORS.
Father and Son Are Both on the
Aberdeen Clipper Line
of Ships.
COMMAND TWO OF THE FASTEST
Captain Philip of the Strathdon Is a
Young Man and He Has
Young Officers.
The British bark Strathdon, now in
port, is remarkable in one respect. She is
officered by the youngest men that have
ever come to San Francisco in command of
a ship. The officers are: Captain William
Philip Jr., Chief Officer Thomson, Second
Officer Taylor, Third Officer Sangster and
Fourth Officer Plater. Every one of them
has been brought up in the service of the
Aberdeen clipper line, to which the Strath
don belongs, and every one of them is a
thorough seaman.
Captain Philip is on his first visit to San
Francisco, but his father, who is now mas
ter of the Pericles, is one of the best known
skippers that come to this port. Captain
Philip Sr. is 63 years of age, and during
fifty years he has been a sailor. His years
weigh very lightly on him, and old-timers
assert that the son will make as good a
navigator as his father.
Captain Philip Jr. is progressive. Every
thing new that is known to navigators can
be found aboard the Strathdon, and all the
The British Bark Strathdon, Which Has the Youngest Set ot Officers in Port, and Her Commander.
[Sketched by a "CaM, " artist.]
master's spare moments are spent in study
ing them. His great fad is steering by the
stars, and he has a set of movable charts
which show ail the prominent stars and
constellations on any given date in the
year. During clear weather the Strathdon
is always navigated by the stars, and when
an observation is taken by the sun the
course is always found to be the true one.
By knowing the stais so well, Captain
Philip says he can always find his way
from one end of the earth to the other
without the use of compass or sextant.
Captain Phillip Sr. ran away from home
when he was 13 years old and went to sea.
His son followed his example, but made
an earlier beginning. He was only 9 years
old when he applied for a position on the
Aberdeen line of clippers and secured it.
From that time he has stuck to his profes
sion and worked his way up. He was
master of the famous old clipper Salamis
nine years ago, and in the races among
the wool-ships from Australia and New
Zealand he always managed to land his
ship a winner. Last voyage, after a par
ticularly exciting race, lie was informed
that he had to go out to Sydney, N. S. W.,
to take command of the Strathdon. Cap
tain Custard, who was to have taken- the
vessel, was killed on the steamer before
she sailed from Southampton and some
one had to go out in his place. After fin
ishing a three months' voyage Captain
Philip felt a little sore at being ordered
away at once, but he accepted the inevit
able and took command of the Strathdon
a month later.
"The races from Australia to England
are like the old days when the tea clippers
carried every stitch of canvas to make a
good voyage from China to London," said
Captain Philip yesterday. "Just about
this time the wool i. all packed, and
everybody is in a hurry to get his crop to
the English market. Fast ships are in
demand, and the old Salamis, sister to the
well-known San Francisco trader Ther
mopylae, was always] the first to be char
tered. About two years ago thirteen of us
all sailed about the same time. Some
went from Sydney, some from Adelaide,
some from Newcastle, and among others
the Salamis sailed from Geelong, near Mel
bourne. We got home first, of course, but
I nad no time in which to enjoy my vic
tory, as I was sent out again' to take the
Strathdon as quickly ; < as a steamer could
carry me. Captain Wills had got married
and decided to turn landsman, so that
caused the change."
The Strathdon is not a fast ship, but, as
Captain Philip puts it, she is "a Noah's
ark for safety." No matter how the winds
blow "she stands up like .a church," and
cv en during the gales that prevail around
the Horn her decks are never wet. Once
during his career Captain Philip lost a
man overboard who was drowned, owing
to the men in the boat being unable to
find him. Since then he has established a
code of signals which tells the life-saving
crew exactly what to do. During the day
the signals are by means of flags and at
night by flashlight. : .7*
The Strathdon is almost a new ship, and
this is her third voyage to San Francisco.
She will load wheat and some general
cargo for Liverpool, and will sail in about
two weeks.
ALONG THE FRONT.
Death of Captain McQlaughliiii Formerly
. _ Master of the Greyfeather.
Captain D. McGlaughlin, the well-known
shipping master and rancher, died at
Grand Manan. N. 8., yesterday. He left
his farm in Fresno County some months
ago to visit his relatives, but was never
able to get back home. His health gave
way, and the end came rapidly. Captain
McGlaughlin was well known here as the
master of. the Glory of the Seas, Herald
of the Morning, Western Empire, Swallow
and the well-known clipper Aetos.
When he came here in '51 on the Grey
feather the first person* he saw on the
wharf was his old schoolmate, C." L. Tay
lor, now Supervisor from the Eighth
Ward. As soon as the vessel touched the
wharf he jumped ashore, and the two
hugged each other so enthusiastically that
they missed their footing and fell over
board. Both were hauled ashore amid the
laughter of the crowd.
The steamer Coptic sailed for Hongkong
via Honolulu and Yokohama yesterday
with the following passenger list:
For Honolulu â Miss Louise Stubbs, Miss

Lloyd, Charles Lloyd, Miss Margery Lloyd.
Among the passengers were J. A. Par
sons and H. R. Bostwick, who are going
to Shanghai to open a mercantile house.
The wharf was crowded with their friends
and many floral pieces were sent to them.
A beautiful representation of a heart,
cross and anchor had "Think sometimes
of Helen" painted on a piece of silk ribbon
attached to it. The Coptic went out in
command of Captain Sealbv, who has
been in the employ of the "White Star
Company since July, 1879, and on the Cop
tic since 1890. Captain Lindsay, who
brought the Coptic here, has been "ordered
back home, and it is said that he will take
command of the Majestic on her next trip.
The steamer San Bias sailed for Panama
and way ports yesterday with very few
passengers, but a very big cargo. She will
: stop at all the way ports and will probably
! make a lons run.
William Tully raised a disturbance on
j Brannan street, near the Mail dock, yes-
I terday and got into trouble with Captain
; Frank Anderson in consequence. He was
j liaif-drunk and began firing his revolver at
the Mail Company's offices and then at a
: dog that ran across the street. Anderson
walkeJ up behind him and, catching the
shooter unawares, gave him a good trounc
ing. Later in the day Tully and two com
panions, named J. Conway and J. Simp
; son, were arrested for stealing a demijohn
of whisky from a Second-street saloon.
The bar is still breaking and vessels will
j not go to sea. The Law Hill, Clan Macken
; zie, Nordlyset, Bohemia, Golden Shore
! and Aloha are all awaiting fair weather to

i get away sometime this afternoon.
Captain Hunter of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company has very much im
! proved in health, and he will be able to

Captain Green, who was temporarily in
command, will go out on the St. Paul.
MORE DAMAGED SHIPPING
A Schconer in Distress Sighted,
â¢ but No Assistance Could
Be Given.
The Steamer Scotia Had to Burn Up
Her Deckload in Order to
Reach Port.
Every coastwise vessel that reaches port
these days has some tale of disaster to tell.
All were caught in the recent storms and
some suffered more than others. After a
long passage of seven and a half days from
Coos Bay Captain Walvig finally got the
steam schooner Sunol into port yesterday.
j He reports as follows :
"On Sunday, the 26th in9t., at 3:30 p. M.,
j when thirty miles southwest of Mendo
j cino, I saw a one-topmast schooner.lumber
laden, with a flag set for assistance of some
kind. She had a double reef in her fore
sail and all the rest of the sails were clewed
up. We could not go to her on account of
the storm. There were strong southeast
squalls coming every few minutes and
heavy seas, and we had to consider our
own safety."
Captain Walvig certainly had to con
sider the safety of his own vessel. Owing
to the length of the voyage from Coos Bay
the supply of coal bad run out and the
boilers were being fed from the deckload
jof lumber. Over 10,000 feet of good pine
j timber went in this way, and had it not
i been aboard the chances are the Sunol
would have been among the missing. The
steamer's decks were swept again and
again by the waves and she was carried
miles out to sea. Everything was securely
lashed, however, and outside of the delay
and the lumber burned up under the boil
ers no loss was sustained. The timbers on
the Sunol are for the Valley road.
The identity of the schooner in distress
spoken by the Sunol is a matter of con
jecture. Shipmasters are of the opinion,
| however, that being lumber-laden she will
' turn up all right in a few days. -
The steam schooner South Coast from
Eureka also had a hard time of it in Sun
day's gale and did not get in until late
yesterday. She was swept from stem to
stern and considerable damage was done,
but she will nevertheless be able to get
away to-day on her return trip to Portland
and wav ports.
The British ship Red Rock, which got
in from Swansea after an unusually long
passage of IGO days, was also in the storm.
Captain .Williams was caught about thirty
miles off the Farallones, and he says the
thunder and lightning and the fury of the
storm reminded him of a pampero off the
River Platte. The vessel was hove to for
thirty-six hours, and' the men had a
hard time of it in keeping the vessel under
I control. .
THE SAME OLD CHARGE.
P. C. Van Kirk, Naval Officer, Ar
rested for Criminal Assault. â¢
' P. C. Van Buskirk, an old naval officer
stationed at the Mare Island navy -yard,
was arrested yesterday morning on a war
rant charging him with criminal assault.
The complaining witness is Rebecca Pain
ter. -*'â 
. The warrant was sworn out in Judge
Campbell's court, and the Judge at once
released Van Buskirk on his own recogni
zance. -
The Judge said that when he signed the
complaint he was not conversant with the
tacts. He had found from papers handed
to him that the complaining witness had
brought a civil suit against the defendant
in the Superior Cour at Vallejo for dam
ages for < betrayal under promise of mar
riage, which had been decided in his favor,
and she was now criminally prosecuting
him on practically the same charge.

Some rare and valuable mineral speci-
mens have been stolen from the museum
of the California Academy of Sciences, and
J. Z. Davis, one of the officers, offer, a re
ward of $50 for the arrest and conviction
of the thief.
In the museum there are a number
of glass cases, in which are displayed
a great many specimens of the min
erals of this State, Nevada and the
Territories, and many from all parts of
the world. The cases rest on tables about
twelve feet long and two feet wide, and
they are secured to these tables by four
thumb-screws, which are out of sight of
visitors. There are two of these screws on
each side, one near each end, and in order
to raise the case the four screws must be
removed.
John I. Carlson, who for more than five
years has been the janitor of the Academy
of Sciences, was the one who discovered
the loss of the specimens.
"Every morning,'' said Carlson yester
day, "1 dust and wipe these cases, and
when doing so look into them to see that
they are all right. On Saturday morning
the case from which the specimens were
taken was like the others all right. On
Sunday the museum is closed, so there
was no one here; but yesterday morning I
discovered thai one case had been tam
pered with. All the screws had been re
moved, and one end of the case was raised
a few inches, as if the person who raised it
had not had time to return it to its proper
position.
"Saturday was rainy, and there were a
number of people who remained in here
quite a long time, and it is my opinion
that some one, tempted by the display of
gold which could be seen in the SDecimen
of rock, under pretext of reading' the in
scription on each, used one hand to re
move one screw, then moved to another
screw and remained there until he had
removed that, and so with the other two.
"It is probable that one man raised one
end of the case a few inches while another
inserted both hands through the opening
so created and abstracted the specimens
within reach. The pieces, taken were all
removed from one side of the case. Some
were taken from near the end, and the
others from a place nearer the other end.
"The stolen specimens, all gold but one,
were worth about $35, but I suppose the
roan who stole them thought they were
worth much more."
The specimens that were stolen were
four of gold and one of silver donated by
R. H. Stretch in 187G, one gold specimen
donated by E. 0. McDevitt, one gold speci
men donated by J. G. Levermore in 1884,
and one gold, contributor not named.
About two months ago two very fine
specimens were abstracted from a case in
a room occupied by Mr. Davis. The man
j ncr in which the theft was committed leads
I to the belief that it was the work of some
one who has familiarized himself with the
premises and habits of the men who are
employed there.
PERJURY IS CHARGED.
Frank Stocking Arrested for Swearing
"Falsely That He Owned Property
Described in a Bond.
Frank Stocking was arrested yesterday
morning on the charge of perjury, the
complaining witness being Police Judge
Conlan. Stocking is not unknown to the
police, having served a term for burglary.
Some months ago he gained considerable
notoriety by selling to Chinese merchants
in Chinatown for $3000 a mixture of mo
lasses and brown sugar, which he repre
sented as opium. :
The cause of his present trouble arises
from his desire to befriend i a woman
named Lillie "Watson, who was arrested on
December 23 for alleged grand larceny.
The woman's bonds were fixed at $2000 and
Stocking, accompanied by ex- Assent bly
man W. P. Boothby of 200 Stockton street,
went to Judge Conlan's residence and they
jointly became her bondsmen. Stocking
represented that he : was the owner of a
house and lot on Octavia street, near
Broadway, valued at $8000, and the Judge
unhesitatingly accepted the bond, and the
woman was released from custody. *
A few days ago Clerk Watson oh looking
over some papers came upon the bond of
Stocking and. Boothby. . Knowing that
Stocking was not the owner of any prop
erty he was surprised and called the atten
tion of the Judge, to the matter. The
Judge had the records in the Assessor's
office examined and it was ascertained that
the property on Octavia street was owned
by Stocking's father and that it was mort
gaged to nearly its full value. â¢
The Judge at once determined to punish
Stocking and the warrant for his arrest
was sworn out. 77/: T/Ta:
BIDS FOR A CREMATORY.
Capitalists Who Would "Like to Burn
the Kef use of San Fran
s Cisco.
Bids for the City garbage crematory,
which were advertised for by the Board of
Supervisors, have begun to come in and
will probably be acted upon at the first
meeting in February. L. V. Merle has
offered the City $5500 for the privilege and
agrees to spend $100,000 on the plant,
which is to have a capacity of 300 tons
per day.
A. M. Skelly offers $1105 and 1 per cent
of the gross receipts for the first fifteen
years, 2 per cent for the second fifteen
years, and 3 per cent for the remainder of
the fifty years called for by the franchise.
The highest bidder is F. E. Sharon, who
offer*} $2510 with 2 per cent of the gross
receipts for the first fifteen years and 5 per
cent for the remainder of the term.
Under the terms of the franchise the
successful bidder receives the exclusive
right for a period of fifty years to cremate
and destroy all house refuse, butchers'
offal, garbage, ashes, bones and animal
and vegetable matter; also, to dispose of
all dead animals when the present dead
animal contract expires, and all food con
demned by the Board of Health. The con
tractor will have the right to charge a sum
not to exceed 20 cents a load for all gar
bage delivered at the crematory, such load
not to exceed a cubic yard. The crema
tory must be erected within twenty-four
months after the award of the franchise,
and when the franchise is in operation it
will be unlawful to take garbage through
the streets except in closed vehicles con
structed so as to conceal the contents and
to effectually prevent any smell from es
caping. .
DIAMOND PALACE GOING
Time Drawing Near for the Clos
ing of This Beautiful
Store.
Colonel A. Andrews to Spend a Year
or Two Abroad for His
Health.
Gradually the stock of the Diamond
Palace on Monteomery street, opposite the
Mills building, is fading through the daily
auctions, and the time is drawing near
when this place of interest will be closed.
The daily attendance at these sales shows
how well and favorably the place is known
to the public, and many are the expres
sions of regret that may be heard from the
patrons of the daily sales because the
beautiful store is soon to vanish.
The Diamond Palace was opened in 1872
by Colonel A. Andrews on so much grander
a scale than any other jewelry establish
ment on the coast that it immediately
took rank as one of the principal attrac
tions of the City. Every one beard of the
place and every one went to visit it.
Diamonds and precious stones are not
alone in the cases, but the walls are in
crusted in them. The design is oriental.
All representations of precious stones in
the beautiful oil paintings on the ceiling
are actually supplied with real gems. The
effect is dazzling and the large and costly
selection of precious stones still remaining
is something really wonderful. Mirrors
on every hand reflect the brilliancy of the.
establishment, and some choice and rare
works of art are appropriately mounted.
One can scarcely believe that a place rep
resenting so much wealth and beauty would
be actually closed out by an auction sale,
because the sacrifice on the goods must be
something fearful. The timo is so inop
portune, just after the holidays, for the
sale of jewels and precious stones. But
when the Colonel had once determined
on taking a much-needed and long-deferred
rest a few hours were sufficient to arrange
the auction sale. Seldom if ever were such
crowds witnessed at any sale in this City,
and certainly never such a turnout of
swelldom. . _ _ _...-.
After closing up his business affairs it is
the intention of Colonel Andrews to spend
a year or two abroad, but he wishes it dis
tinctly understood that he expects to re
turn to San Francisco to make it his per
manent home.
NATIVE SONS ARE BUSY
They Are Making Preparations
for Two Great Events
in February.
Programme on the Occasion of Dedi-
eating the New Hall on
Mason Street.
The board of directors of the Native
Sons of the Golden West Hall Association
met last evening for the purpose of ad
vancing arram-emcnts for the dedication
of the new hall on Sunday, the 9th of Feb
ruary, and the inaugural ball to be given
on the Tuesday following.
It was decided the decoration of the
building for both events should be en
trusted to Pratt of Pacific Parlor.
The choral society of fifty voices will be
under the direction of Mrs. E. W. French.
E. P. E. Troy will have charge of the
tickets for the ball, and the price of ad
mission has been fixed as follows: Admit
ting a gentleman and lady, $2 50; for each
additional lady, $1.
It was decided to reserve 200 seats for
the guests invited to the dedication.
The officers of the hall association are J.
D. Pheian, president; L. F. Byington,
vice president, and Adolph Eberhardt,
secretary. 7;'

WAS LEGALLY DISMISSED
Isidore Leszinsky's Writ of
Mandate Has Been ,
â "â¢ Denied.
HAD A SPECIAL CERTIFICATE.
Judge Seawell's Ruling on a Point of
. Much Interest to Public School
Trustees.
Judge Seaweil has declared that Isidore
Leszinsky was legally removed from his
position as principal of the Commercial
Evening School by the last Board of Edu
cation.
Leszinsky was removed on October 25,
1893. It was claimed by the board that on
August 30 the Commercial Evening School
was abolished, and Leszinsky went with
it. Leszinsky brought suit "for a writ of
mandamus to compel the board to rein
state him, and this writ has just been de
nied. He alleged that in addition to being
principal of the school he held a special
certificate enabling him to teach book
keeping, but that when the Business
Evening School was organized and nearly
all the teachers from the former Commer
cial Evening were elected to positions in
the new school Leszinsky was not among
them. He claims he could not be dis
missed except for cause, and after a hear
ing, and that the board could not do in
directly what was not allowed to be done
directly, and that the old school was
abolished for the express purpose of get
ting rid of him.
in the opinion Judge Seaweil holds that
there is no provision of the Political Code
which declares that the holder of a special
certificate shall not be dismissed except
for cause. In the absence of a contract
fixing the term of his employment he
holds the position to which he may have
been elected during the pleasure of the
board.
Section 1791 of the code provides, the
court says, for three grades of City certifi
cates and for special certificates upon such
studies as may be authorized by the Board
of Education, and section 1793 declares
that the holders of City certificates shall
be dismissed only for certain causes. A
special certificate, the court declares, is
not a City certificate and is not mentioned
in the law as a special City certificate,
except in one section, which does not refer
to tbe granting of them. The board is
prohibited from dismissing the holders of
City certificates, and no others. Leszinsky
was not the holder of a City certificate
and the court saw. no reason why he could
not be dismissed at pleasure.
The case of Kate Kennedy against the
Board of Education was cited, but Judge
Seaweil said it had no bearing on Les
zinsky's case because in that proceeding
there was no question as to the rights of
the holder of a special certificate.
Commenting further the court says:
It appears from the evidence that among
the teachers of the Commercial Evening School
was a lecturer on commercial law. The rules
of the Board of Education provide for special
certificates in music, sewing, physical culture
and cooking. It is possible that the board
may provide an instructor in the art of riding
upon a bicycle. Are the teachers of all these
specialties when once elected to hold their
positions for life?
That the defendants had the power to abol
ish the Commercial Evening School is not
questioned. It is claimed, however, that it
was abolished merely for the purpose of de
priving plaintiff of his position. While under
my construction of the statute the question as
to defendants' motives is immaterial, inas
much as evidence was introduced upon it
it is proper that I should state the conclusion
to which I have arrived.
I have grave doubts as to the power of the
court to inquire into the secret motives which
influenced the members of the board in a
matter within their jurisdiction, If the Busi
ness Evening School had not been subse
quently organized there would have been no
plausible ground upon which plaintitf could
ask restoration. The new school was formed
nearly two months after the old one was abol
ished. Several members of the board testified
that they voted for the resolution in the belief
that the results accomplished by the Commer
cial Evening School were not such as to justify
the expense of maintaining it and that their act
was prompted solely by a regard for the public
welfare. Whether they were mistaken or not
Is a question which I have no jurisdiction to
determine. There may be a question as to the
validity of plaintiff's election before he was
granted a certificate, but as no objection has
been made on that ground I assumed that his
election was valid.

FATHER YORKE
Says the Priest's Attack Is
Cowardly, Slanderous
and False.
HIS MILITARY RECORD.
The Veteran Army Officer De
fends His Service and Loy
alty During the War.
CATHOLICS AND THE INDIANS.
They Drew Millions From the Public
Treasury for Their Missionary
Schools.
Replying to a letter from the Rev.
Father Yorke, reflecting on his army
record during the civil war and his admin
istration of the Indian Office at Washing
ton during Mr. Harrison's term as
President as well, General T. J. Morgan
writes to The Call as follows:
New York, January 23, 1896.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Call: I had
hoped that my brief personal note, which you
courteously published in your columns Decem
ber 17, would be regarded as satisfactory by
Father Yorke, but in this I was mistaken. In
your issue of December 18 you publish ft little
more than a column from him renewing and
intensifying his attack upon my personal
character; an attack which I regard as un
called for, ami which I may be pardoned lor
saying I think to be cowardly, slanderous and
false. A very prominent business man of San
Francisco, an army officer of high rank, who
kindly sent me your paperâ which reached me
only a few days agoâ accompanies it with the
following statement:
I read the inclosed very carefully and have
talked with quite a number of military men con
cerning your record, and am pleased to inform you
that they are universally favorable to you ami
against "Yorke and hi* method*, I know that â *â __
will have nine-tenths of the old soldiers with you
on most any proposition against the Catholics and
their opposition to our grand public school system.
I am not a member of the __ P. A., but they have
my unbounded sympathy.
By your permission I wish to point out some
of the inaccuracies and misleading statements
made in Mr. Yorke's article. In the first place,
regarding the court-martial. When 1 took
charge of the organization of negro troops I
did it with a view of preparing those men for
good soldiers, and I thought it necessary that
their white officers should set them good ex
amples in camp and in battle, and, conse
quently, I maintained a pretty rigid discipline
over the officers. I discouraged drinking,
gambling and other vices, and insisted on
fidelity and courage. I felt called upon to have
one of the officers of the regiment court-mar
tialed for drunkenness and another for cow
ardice, and although the evidence did not
satisfy the court it was true nevertheless.
Concerning my own testimony in the case of
the officer charged with cowardice at the
battle of Nashville, I simply say now. after
thirty years, and with no malice toward the
officer and with regret that I am forced thus to
say it, every word of the testimony which I
gave at that time was true, absolutely and un
qualifiedly. I protest that I am not responsi
bio for dragging him once again before the !
public in this unenviable light. As a conse
quence of my severe discipline th* two officers
whom I had court-martialed joined with oth
ers and formed a conspiracy to get even with
me ana trumped up a technical charge, on
which they based their hopes of driving me
from the service. They charged me with
"false muster." All there was to this can be
stated in one or two sentences : When I went to
Galatin. Term.. in October, 1863. to organize a
regiment of negroes I found a large number
already in camp, and at once set about the
work of formin_ a regiment. I was occupied
myself with administration, drilling, doing
picket and post duty , foraging, etc. We were sur
rounded, at that time by guerrilla bands, re
quiring us to be constantly on the alert; the
work of classifying and enrolling the troops
was done by an expert and experienced
clerk, A. P. Dunlop, who was sent to me for
that purpose, When six companies had been
completed and I asked to have them formally
mustered, a question arose as to the exact date
of musterâ question to be decided by the in
terpretation of army regulations and the rul
ing of.thegdjutant general's department rel
ative to muster. The matter was fully and
openly discussed and there were two opinions,
one that the company should muster early in
October and the other that the date should be
fixed possibly two weeks later. The matter
was left to the decision of an officer of the reg
ular army detailed to muster us ; his decision,
however, was not satisfactory to one of the cap
tains, who claimed that he was deprived by
it of his place as ranking captain, which he
claimed. The matter was regarded, however,
as settled until March, 1850, when the officers,
smarting under my discipline, united with
this dissatisfied captain In bringing me to trial,
charged with making a "false muster." The
court satisfied itself apparently on the testi
mony of an army officer that the date of muster
fixed by the mustering officer was incorrect,
and held that as I was the commanding officer
of the regiment I was responsible for it ; hence,
its verdict of "guilty." At most it. was a ques
tion of judgment and of interpretation of ob
scure rulings, and never involved a question
of my integrity.
Mr. Yorke says that my statement of General
Steed man's action in setting aside the ver
dict of the court, ''While not an assertion of
falsehood, suggests the thing that is not." In
reply I beg to quote here the entire order of
General Si^edman, which speaks for itself:
Headquarters Second Division,*)
Department C_MB_R_A!Â«n, }-
. Chattanooga, Term., May 10, 1865. J
The proceedings, findings and sentence of the
general <ourt-m_rtlal Id the foregoing case of
Colonel Thomas J. Morgan. Fourteenth U. 8.
Colored Infantry, are disapproved, for the follow
ing reasons, affecting the legality of the sentence:
The objections made by the accused to the ad
mission of the deposition of Captain Hough and
Private Martin was well laid, and the depositions
were improperly admitted. As the facts contained
therein wort' probably taken into consideration by
the court, their improper admission might, of it
self . form grounds for disapproval.
The sentence of the dismissal from the
serviceâ is illegal. Colonel Morgan was found
guilty of a violation of the fifteenth article of war,
which In itself provides the only penalty for the
violation, vis.: cashiering, and the words of the
article must be strictly followed In the sentence.
The finding of guilty on the second chargeâcon

Colonel Morgan Is found guilty of three of the

extent true, are, so far as relates to Colonel Mor

During the progress of the trial the follow
ing paper was drawn up and signed dv eighty
seven field, staff and line officers of my brigade.
Tbe original paper is now before me:
Chattanooga, Term., May 10, 1865.
Colonel Thomas J. Morgan, Fourteenth United
States Colored Infantry, . having been arraigned
and tried by a general court-martial, and design
ing persons having taken advantage of the circum
stances to circulate false and malicious" reports
calculated to lilt ht his 'air and well-earned name,
ire, the undersigned officers, who know his worth,
desire only that Justice may be done.. Many of us
l:ave seen him In everyday life, in the officers'
school and in the ' church, on the march and
on i State. We have seen him in * battle,
when men nre weighed In the balance,
and where he never was found wanting. â  Many
of us older than himself have looked to him a. a
mv le] man amid the many wrecks of our com
rades. His career as a soldier has bÂ»en distin
guished for courage, energy and philanthropy. To
the persistent efforts . of Colonel Morgan more
than to any oilier man in this department is due
the name which the black soldier earned for him
self at Datten, Fnlnslcf, Decatur and Nashville,
(Such a man deserves well of his country. .Wnat
ever action the authorities may take, we each un
hesitatingly express our unshaken confidence in
the honesty, patriotism and unbending Christian
character of Colonel Thomas J. Morgan. ;:â¢>. â¢-
I Know that Major-General Steedman be
lieved me to be ent'relv innocent of any wrong
intention, and iT any doubt this I refer
them to his adjutant-general, Major S. B. Moe,
now living at Chattanooga, Term., who was
personally familiar with all the facts in the
case. General George H. Thomas, than whom
no nobler, purer soldier served in the army,
assured me during the progress of the trial
that he had unshaken confidence in my integ
rity, and he afterward recommended me, of
his own accord, for promotion, and on his
recommendation, chiefly, I was made brevet
brigadier-general "for gallant and meritorious
services during the war," being one of the very
youngest men on whom that honor was con
ferred. General Cruft, in forwarding a paper
to the War Department, August 17, 1805,
placed upon it the following indorsement:
'Tie is an intelligent and earnest soldier, a
scholar of liberal education and a high-toned,
conscientious and brave gentleman*"
1 give here the names of some of the officers
with whom I was associated, who are still liv
ing and who can be addressed by anybody who
wishes to make inquiry regarding any of the
facts here stated, or regarding my career as an
army officer: Lieutenant-Colonel J. R. Putnam,
who was a member of the court-martial that
tried me, Portland block, Chicago, 111.; Major
Henry Romeyn, Fifth United States Infantry,
Atlanta, Ga. ; Captain Clarence W. Baker,
Chattanooga, Term.; Rev. William Elgin, D.D.,
Akron. N. V. ; Captain F.J. Cressey, Los An
geles, Cal.; Rev. Elvero Persons, D.D., Dela
ware. Ohio. So much for that little episode,
which surely ought to be laid to rest.
Mr. Yorke says: "Permit me to remark that
soon after these courts-martial Rev. Mr. Mor
gan resigned precipitately from the army."
The animus of this statement of course is on
the face of it. How false it is in fact, and how
utterly ungenerous it Is in motive, will be
appreciated by your readers when I call
their attention to the fact that the courts
martial were in March and that I re
signed in August. I had left the senior class
in college in 1801, and served three months
as a private soldier, . until the expiration
of my term of enlistment; after teaching
a year I re-entered the army as first lieuten
ant, in August, 1802, and served a little more
than three years as lieutenant-major, lieu
tenant-colonel, colonel, â¢ brigadier and divi
sion commander, until August, 1805,
when the war was over, and there
was no longer any necessity for my remain
ing* in the army. I resigned, not pre
cipitately but deliberately, ami within three
weeks afterward, after a hasty call at my
home, I was enrolled in the Theological Sem
inary at Rochester, N. V., having for one of
my classmates the former chaplain of my regi
ment, and remained there three years, com
pleting my studies in 1808. 1 then served the
seminary as financial secretary for three years.
Passing now from the question of my own
personal record in the army, let me notice one
or two things said by Mr. Yorke about my con
duct of the Indian Office. Evidently Mr.
Yorke writes with regard to a matter which he
knows nothing about, or else he deliberately
falsifies history. He says: "It was to carry out
a campaign against the contract school system
that Morgan, by church influence, was pitched
into the Indian Office." I had served in the
army as an officer in a regiment commanded
by Colonel Benjamin Harrison. After he be
came President, in May, 1889. he telegraphed
me to come to Washington, and re
quested me to take the office of Commissioner
of Indian Affairs, saying that no one had sug
gested my name to him, but that from his
knowledge of me he believed I would be able
to administer the office so as to satisfy the
Christian and philanthropic sentiment oi the
country.
Mr. Yorke says "the advent of Morgan was
marked by a virulent attack on the Catholic
schools." This statement is absolutely and
unqualifiedly false. I made no attack upon
the Catholic schools. I expressed a disap
proval of the entire plan of taking public
money out of the United States Treasury and
appropriating it to Indian schools carried on
by any religious bodies for sectarian purposes.
At that time Methodists, Congregationalists,
Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Friends, Luther
ans, Menonites, Unitarians and Roman Cath
olics were receiving money from the public
treasury for their Indian schools. The Bap
tists were receiving nothing and declined to
receive anything on the ground that it was a
misuse of public money ana was in violation
of the principle of separation of church and
state, for which the Baptists have always stood.
As a result of the discussion growing out of my
action all the religious denominations except
the Menonnites have withdrawn entirely from
the contract school system; the present ad
ministration has adopted my views and is
carrying out my plan. Congress has ordered
the discontinuing of the contract system as !
soon as practicable. Within eleven years the'
Roman Catholic church has taken out of the
public treasury $3,430,000 for the prosecution
of its missions among the Indians. This I be
lieve to be a great public wrong, un-American
and contrary to the spirit if not the letter of
the constitution. If I had accomplished
nothing else in my administration of. the
Indian Office than to expose this great wrong
and set in motion forces which are leading to
its eradication. I should feel that my adminis
tration of that great and difficult office had
been eminently successful.
Mr. Yorke says "that neither Republican I
politics nor meritorious service in the war, j
nor any other consideration availed to keep a |
man in the employ of the Indian Commission i
when General Morgan discovered that he was I
a Catholic."
Let me say emphatically* that I dismissed no
one from the Indian service because he was a
Roman Catholic; that I did retain in the ser
vice as teachers and in other positions many
whom I knew to he Roman Catholics; further
than this, I appointed to Important positions
in the Indian service Roman Catholics and
offered places to others, which were not
accepted. While I was in the Indian Office mv
private and confidential secretary was a Roman
Catholic, several of the ' clerks in the
office were Roman Catholics during my
entire service, and the chief messenger,
ray personal attendant, was also a Roman
Catholic. I aid dismiss from the Indian
service for cause some Roman Catholics, and I
very much fear that if Mr. Yorke had been in
the Indian service when I was Commissioner I
should have been most reluctantly obliged to
dismiss him for falsehood, slander and cow
ardice if I had had before me such evidences
of his character as his present attacks upon me
indicate. I do not believe that any man's
religion or professions of religion ' should
be allowed to. shield him , from being
treated as his character and habits
demand. The great hue and cry raised
against me by the Roman Catholics
was due almost wholly to the fact that I in
sisted that persons in the Indian service
should be honest, faithful and capable. The
man who has made the most persistent attacks
upon me in the name of Catholicism and who
has written many columns of slanders and
falsehoods was a man whom I thrust out of
office because he was unworthy to be In it, and
who has sought his revenge by his malignant
persecution of me ever since. He it. was who
copied from the War Department the records
of the court-martial which Mr. Yorke is using,
and who has furuished to the Catholic press
most of the mud which it has used in its as
saults upon me.
In conclusion let me say that I regard the
conflict now raging on this continent between
Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, be
tween the civilization of the nineteenth cen
tury and the semi-civilization of the sixteenth,
between the liberty of our republican institu
tions and the despotism of the Roman Catholic
hierarchy, between our free public schools,
with all their broadening and . uplifting quali
ties, and the narrow, provincial, , belittling,
benumbing parochial schools, is a conflict in
which every lover of his race, every lover of
republican institutions, every lover of genuine
Christianity, ought to be found on the side of
the Flag and the Little Red Schoolhou&e. This
is the side of patriotism, ot philanthropy, of
progress, of Protestantism. Very respectfully,
T. J. Morgan.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 1896.
MR. POLK PROSTRATED
A Monterey Discovery Jars
; Upon His Artistic Young
Nature.
A SCENE IN SANCHEZ TAVERN.
Nearly $10,000 Worth of Paintings
Are, Obliterated by Liberal Doses
of Roof Paint.
Yesterday afternoon shortly after the
late train arrived from Monterey, a pale,
haggard young man was led out on the
rear platform of the end car and gently as
sisted to the pavement by two porters.
A few railroad employes who are ac
quainted with the traveling public recog
nized Willis Polk. He leaned heavily on
the arms of his attendants and was almost

[Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
carried to a coupe that appeared to be in
waiting for him.
The cabman slowly picked his way to
the residence of Mr. Polk, having previ-
ously received instructions to drive only
on streets paved with asphaltum. As the
carriage drove up to the front gate a stal
wart servant came out and the almost
prostrate Willis staggered into the house
and, with the assistance of his valet, sank
heavily on his couch.
"I wish to be alone," said he. "Admit
no one. Tell them all that I wili see only
my private secretary and Ned Greenway.
I fear that the worst has not yet come.
Avaunt."
Mr. Polk's valet made a low salaam and
backed out into a plan for the new ferry
depot that Mr. Polk had completed some
days before and left in tne hallway for the
inspection of visitors. No partciular
harm was done, as the puncture merely
looks like one of the architect's eccen
tricities.
The curtains were drawn and the help
were instructed to put on muffled slippers
for a few days. Hot bottles were prepared
and the entire house was put in order
sp ecially for the stricken Willi-*. '
At a late hour the news of Mr. Polk's
sudden affliction was carried along Mar
ket street, and a Call reporter went im
mediately to the gentleman's residence,
not without securing credentials, however,
from â¢ Mr. Greenway before calling. Mr.
Polk immediately sent out word to bring
the visitor in, "and, upon entering, the
representative of this paper found the
architect propped up on pillows, carefully
reading a formula for the removal of fire
proof paint. Just what this particular
variety of literature was worth in a sick
room developed later.
Mr. Polk himself was too much ex
hausted and worn out to tell a well-con
nected story, but shortly after midnight
the following terrible revelation was ex
tracted from his conversation.
It seems that Willis left San Francisco
some two weeks ago to visit his old friend
and brother artist, Charles Rollo Peters,
who is at present living in Monterey, that
historic old spot where so many painters
and bohemians have lived before him.
In order to appreciate the gravity of the
situation one must understand that many
years ago a Mr. Sanchez, whose wife was
a sister : of the wife of Robert Louis
Stevenson, conducted and made hospit
able a certain tavern where the knights of
the brush used to congregate and tell jokes
and discuss art-.. In the regular order of
things all of the best known painters on
this coast and some from the East found
rest, recreation and hot Scotches under the
adobe roof of the ever appreciative
Sanchez.
Such men as Duran, Innes, Carlson,
Tavernier, Stanton, Latimer. Strong, Rix,
Peters, Roderiguez and others used to
drop in on old Sanchez and tell him ar
tistic stories and pass the time of day.
On a great many occasions they passed
several times of the day and* always
dropped in each time. Monterey and
Sanchez Tavern were the two bricht par
ticular spots on the Pacific Coast where
artists felt at home. They stayed there
all summer and found some of J their most
marvelous inspirations in the atmosphere
of . the old . cypress tree. It was a
veritable heaven for them in every way.
A painter, was not recognized in society
who had never been to Monterey and the
tavern of Sanchez.
Such pleasant associations as must
necessarily . have been enjoyed there
should have been preserved . in some way,
and it fell to the lot of Sanchez to devise
some ways and means of perpetuating the
old circle. He thought a long time before
the idea struck him, but he eventually
succeeded in grasping the situation one
day while looking over his accounts.
There were many names on his books,
and some of them were artists. ...: He
thought a little while over the matter and
got a good plan straightened out: in his
head. "Why not have them: paint, me a
pictureâ^each one of themâ all of them?"
said ; he ; â¢ "and some day, yes, some day,
the collection will be above price. , I'll do
it and square the accounts."
, It was a gigantic "undertaking, but it
carried at last, and in \a \ few I days 7 every
artist in Monterey was at; work on some
part of the interior of . the tavern of
Sanchez. The door panels, the window
casings, the walls, the bar ornaments, the
lookins-jilass frame, in fact, : the entire
room was adorned with some dainty
masterpiece by men many of whom have
since become famous. . â¢-*--.
Sanchez chuckled and laughed. It was
a great scheme. It was working well, and
as fast as artists came down from the city
they added their artistic mite to the al
ready stupendous collection. Sanchez
bubbled over with enjoyment to see his
place thus beautified. He wrote to Robert
Louis about it, and Robert Louis approved
of the plan. .
Sanchez "set. them up" liberallyâ that
is to say, he supplied cakes and ale with a
royal handâ for each picture, and the little
tavern became a celebrated corner of the
earth. Tourists came to look at. its walls
and panels, bloods bought their "bracers"
there, and every one went to have a peep
at the collection of paintings.
One day, however, Sanchez found that
the financial depression was beginning to
weigh heavily upon htm, and- within a
few weeks the iron hand of the creditor
was laid heavily upon his business, and it
passed from him. Here ends the history
of Sanchez. He rose and fell, but none
heard him strike. Sanchez was gone.
And now comes Mr. Polk, who, in com
pany with Mr. Peters, made the terrible
discovery that almost prostrated him for
good. It came about through Mr. Polk
expressing a desire to see the tavern of
Sanchez, of which he had heard so much,
and Mr. Teters. his host, said it "a-ould be
a pleasure to take Willis to the historic
spot.
"I have not been there for some time,"
said Mr. Peters; "in fact "not since San
chez left, but I guess it is there still. We
shall see." '-. ...
The two gentlemen locked arms and pro
ceeded to the tavern. When they arrived
and entered what Mr. Peters said was the
place, they were confronted with a plain
unadorned room with nothing but a bar
and a picture of Governor Jim Budd over
the center of the mirror.
"This must be the wrong place," ven
tured Peters; "let's go to the next."
The next was a Chinese washhouse and
Peters decided to return to the first place.
Immediately upon entering he walked
over to the wail and taking out his knife
scraped off the fire proof paint. There
was what he expected to findâ a fragment
of a Tavcrnier. A little further on was
resurrected a bit of a Carlson and then a
small piece of Rix. In the meantime
Willis had uncovered a picture of James
Whitcomb Riley by his brother Dan. He
rushed over to the proprietor and de
manded to know the criminal who was to
blame for the wanton destruction of so
many gems. The man replied that they
had got to be "chestnuts" and that he
had painted the barroom over with roof
paint to give it a nice soft tone. He did
not know that he had wiped out a fortune
with his terrible brush.
. Willis swept the bar ornaments off on
the floor and hurried out into the open air,
where he denounced the floating popula
tion of the United States, and was finally
brought up to San Francisco to recover
from the jostle that had been admin
istered to his artistic nature.
MERSFELDER BENEFIT.
A Most Enjoyable Musical Event in Aid
of a Well-Known Artist.
A large and appreciative audience filled
Golden Gate Hall last night at the enjoy
able benefit concert tendered to Jules K.
Mersfelder, the well-known and popular
artist. Bainbridge Ryder acted as master
of ceremonies, and added not a little to the
evening's merriment by the * piquant sal
lies with which he graced the announce
ment of the various numbers on the
lengthy but delightful programme.
Perhaps the most enjoyable among the
vocal numbers was Massenet's "Salome,"
by Mrs. Alvina Heuer-Wilson. ! The gifted
singer fairly captivated her audience with
the magic of her magnificent voice, her
personality being, perhaps, almost as
charming. Mrs. Wilson wore a rich yet
simply made evening costume of ivory
white brocade, her only ornament being a
cluster of violets in her hair, kept in place
by a crescent of brilliants.
R. Fletcher Tilton contributed one or
two classical piano selections, while Signor
Cadenasso, in "La Donna c Mobile," from
"Rigoletto,". and the drinking song from
"Cavaileria . Rusticana," sang, as he has
always done, like a singer to the manner
born. P3mm&
. B. C. Bicknell did some remarkably clever
work in lightning modeling in clay, his
types being marvels of facial expression.
The Tress Club Quartet, composed of
Messrs. Tilton, Coffin, Tucker and Warde,
rendered a number of beautiful four- part
son while the duet. "A Night in Ven
ice," by Lucantoni, by Mrs. Wilson and
Mr. Collin, was one of the gems of the
evenink. , -
: Mr. Mersfelder modestly kept himself in
reserve until the end of the programme,
when he drew a number of beautiful and
graphic landscapes and marine sketches in
charcoal/concluding with several readings
from. "The Merchant of Venice." His
voice, while having an' admirable carrying
Quality, is singularly soft and expressive,
Ihe event was socially and artistically a ;
brilliant success.

ANTICS IN THE ARCTIC
C* _ _ v -tTr-_ -â¢ -,
Statements by Witnesses for Cap
tain Healy and Against
Him.
A GAY AFFAIE AT UNALASKA.
Story of the Man, Who Saved the Old
Sea Dog From an Unmarked,
Watery Grave.
Though the first half of yesterday's
testimony at the Healy investigation was
nominally on the side of the .prosecution,
the defense might have fared . far worse.
The first witness at the morning session
was Chief Engineer A. L. Broad bent of the
United States revenue cutter Corwin, for
merly employed in the same capacity on
the Bear, under Captain Healy. He testi
fied that on the night of a social aboard the
Pheasant the captain had imbibed quite
freely of the cup that cheers and fre
quently inebriates as well but the witness
did not think he drank more than the
other officers present. When asked
whether he was on friendly terms with the
captain, Mr. Broadbent replied that there
had been a slight misunderstanding be
tween them on the evening of the social at
Unalaska, but it had been satisfactorily
explained. He had seen the captain appa
rently intoxicated at a receptio*h given by
the officers of the Alaska Commercial
Company at Unalaska on the night after
the Pheasant affair and again on the fol
lowing night at a social event aboard the
Corwin, but never when on duty.
Regarding the captain's efficiency, the
witness stated that on occasions of danger,
when afraid to entrust the management of
the vessel to his subordinates, he had
known him to pass from thirty to sixty
hours on deck and spend as much as two
days: and nights consecutively in the
crow's nest. He characterized the captain
as a severe disciplinarian, but said he
could rind no fault with him beyond a
rather despotic demeanor toward his sub
ordinates. 'â -.
A vision in broadcloth, gold lace and
white gloves then took the stand, and re
sponded in gentle terms to the name of
Dorry. He said he was assistant engineer
on the Bear and had known the accused
during a period covering* about twenty
months. He said the captain was never,
to his knowledge, under the influence of
liquor while at sea, but that at the social
events mentioned by the preceding witness
the veteran officer's language had been far
from choiceâ actually insulting, in fact.
He had heard no one criticize the captain
except during the Bear's last cruise. '
Executive Officer Albert Buhner, also of
the Bear, testified that in his opinion
Captain Healy's behavior on the Pheas
ant was no worse than that of the other
participants in the festive reunion. He
did not recollect having seen him intoxi
cated on any other occasion. He consid
ered the captain too strict in his method
of conducting the vessel, and said there
was some ill-feeling among the officers in
consequence.
William C. Meyers, second engineer of
the Bear, corroborated the testimony of
the other witnesses regarding Captain
Healy's hilarity on the occasions cited,
but did not feel competent to criticize him
as an officer. Personally he would trust
him in command of any vessel in any sea.
lie had felt rather sore toward the captain
for having refused to shake hands with
him on one or two occasions before others,
but cherished no resentment against him
on that account.
Chief Engineer C. W. Coffin was the
prosecution's last witness. He confirmed
the assertions of his predecessors, and
stated in addition that he had made two
cruises with Captain Healy and had had
"differences with him, but nothing
serious." ,'. :;,'â  -. - P-A - .. â¢â 
The defense opened at the afternoon ses
sion by recalling the witness Coffin. He tes
tified tbat the captain had injured his back
quite severely when he fell from the wharf
at Unaloska. He could not say whether
tne captain was under the influence of
spirits on that occasion or not. He had
never seen him drunk at sea.
George G. Connell, first lieutenant of the
United States revenue cutter Perry, said
he had known Captain Healy for six years
and had made two cruises in his company.
He had never seen him drunk, out had
heard rumors to that effect.
Captain Hooper, senior efficer of the
fleet, testified that he had been present for
a short while at the "whisky and tobacco"
event aboard the Pheasant, and had not
noticed any undue exhilaration on Cap
tain Healy's part during that time. When
asked whether he thought it probable that
the captain succumbed to the potent
charms of the flowing bowl at a later hour,
he said:
"Well, perhaps he did. I would be
much surprised if I heard that one of the
men present at the social went away sober.
I don't see that there's anything so" dread
fully scandalous in a man getting a little
happy when he's off duty, anyhow."
Patrick Hutton, former master-at-arms
of the United States revenue cutter Grant,
said he had rescued the captain from a
watery grave at Unalaska. The Grant
was casting off and Captain Healy and a
number of other officers and civilians were
standing on the edge of the wharf waving
adieux to friends on the departing vessel.
Captain Healy was on the bulwark and
lost his balance. The witness saw him fall
and jumped into the water after him. A
boat was let down from the Grant and the
captain and his rescuer taken aboard that
vessel. The captain complained of a
severe strain in his back, but sat upright
in the boat and ascended the cutter's gang
plank without assistance: *If he was
drunk when he fell off the wharf, the cold
water had evidently sobered him, for after
the rescue he manifested no indications of
intoxication.
The investigation will continue to-day.
It is understood the defense is making
strong efforts to have the charges against
the veteran captain dismissed.
THE RICHMOND SCHOOL.
Recent Improvements Have Placed It
in a Good Sanitary Condition.
The recent agitation in the Richmond
district about the Richmond School not
being in a sanitary condition has brought
about good results. ", K'T'
"The agitation," said George Fletcher of
the Point Lobos Club yesterday, "has
been the means of placing this school in"
perfect sanitary condition and in estab
lishing a seventh grade, so that children
who in the past were forced to go to the
Hamilton Grammar School, almost a mile
from this one, can now attend ' the Rich
â  mond.
''The source of complaint several months
ago ; was that . tne outhouses" which were
very close to .the , main building, bad no
outlet and that the stench from them was
almost intolerable. Not only that, but
the atmosphere was polluted and many
children were \ affected %to such ' a degree
that the parents took them away. In the
rear of 5 the school there was a Jot sixty,
feet deep belonging to the School Depart
ment which was unused. This has been
added :to the school yard, and at the ex
treme eastern end there ha-Â» been built a
large outhouse on the â¢ most approved
sanitary system for the ; use ; of the pupils.
'.'Then in addition a sewer has been con
structed to connect with the ono: on Penn
sylvania street. ; So ' now all ? the waste
water is carried away; " there is no longer
any stench, and the atmosphere I is as pure

of between $3000 and $4000. .7 Now the chil
dren have additional yard room. './yu â  .-;
"At some time in the future," explained
Mr. Fletcher, '-we shall endeavor to have
the school building raised and then have
the yard graded."
The school building is well lighted and
the classrooms are bright, but there is one
interior arrangement that is defective, and
that is the stairs leading to the upper
story. "-\ They are very narrow, and in case
of a panic would prove a trap into which
many children, would be crushed. The
principal, Miss 'Tierney, stated that the
stairs are not as wide as they should be,
and Mr. Fletcher, who was present, re
marked that they could be widened with
out much trouble and without much
expense...; .* ;p .p.aA:/./*.< :-.y , *i.
DUNDON SUES AGAIN.
He Files a Comprehensive Complaint
Against the Pacific Bank.
P. F. Dundon has again appeared as a
plaintiff against 'the Pacific Bank. This
time his suit is quite comprehensive. He
wants a full accounting of all the transac
tions of the directors of the bank prior to
January 13,1896, and he asks that a judg
ment be rendered against them for the
full amount of the money lost to the Pa
cific Bank by reason of the negligence and
inattention which characterized the man
agement of the bank by the defendant di
rectors. <"
Specific allegations of mismanagement
are made, such as the expending of large
sums on accounts in no waj- connected
with the bank, loans upon insufficient se
curities and upon insufficient notes, and
other acts, to which the plaintiff takes ex
ception. ' "'.' * "" ' â¢ '.'" *'â 'â¢â¢ \yÂ£p r
HANGING BALANCE.
Contractors for the New Ferry
Depot Are Still in a
Quandary.
Awaiting a Decision by the Board of
Examiners That Is Slow in
Coming.
The new ferry building and the ways
and means by which construction on it
can be begun, were again under considera
tion by the Harbor Commissioners yester
day. Contractor Bateman reported that
he had sent the $33 warrant, for building
the fence, to Sacramento through Wells,
Fargo & Co. The bank presented it for
payment, and was informed that it must
take its usual course.
President Colnon announced that the
Board of Examiners would act on the mat
ter next Friday, and in view of the urgency
of the case he said something should be
done by the board at once. On the motion
of Commissioner Cole it was decided that
President Colnon should go to Sacramento
to-morrow morning in order to see that
something in the matter is done at once.
Postmaster McCoppin appeared before
the board and urged that a new and more
commodious structure than is now given
to the Postoffice on the water front should
be erected. He said it would be a long
time before the ferry depot was finished,
and that in the meantime the postal facili
ties of the City were suffering. The idea
is to make a great distributing depot out
of station D at the ferries, and from it
send all the mail for far-away points by
the cable and electric cars. â¢-:.â¢â¢â¢
Postmaster McCoppin presented ' his
views in a neat speech, and the Commis
sioners promised to do everything they
possibly could. If the United' States Gov
ernment will agree to inaugurate a postal
delivery by electric and cable cars, then
the Commissioners will erect the necessary
building to accommodate the postal au
thorities. T .-- r *-
The owners of the steamer Gold thought
$25 a month for dockage an exorbitant
charge when viewed in the light of what
other steamship lines - had to pay. The
Commissioners thought the charge exces
sive and reduced it to $15. The owners of
Cousins drydock also wanted a reduction,
on the ground that it had never earned
the rent since it was built. The matter
was referred to the Chief Wharfinger, but
the chances are that a reduction will be
made. A/PAypyzPi. . â  â â â  PrP/.
The Board of Health wrote asking that
a place be set apart in which meat and
milk landed from steamers can be in
spected. The Commissioners were in
favor of the movement, but, as the request
is so indehnite, nothing could be done.
Meat and milk are landed from a dozen
vessels and at a dozen different points,
and at no one point could they all be con
centrated. In oraer to arrive at a definite
understanding it was decided to ask one of
the members of the Board of Health to be
present at the next meeting of the com
mission.
The pilot boat Jessie, which was recently
purchased for use on the Columbia River
bar, managed to slip away without paving
asl SO wharfage bill. As Wharfinger
Walkupwas to blame he was ordered to
pay the amount into the State treasury at
once. Mr. Walkup can now recover the
amount from the Columbia River pilots.
McNab & Smith, whose truck was dam
aged to the extent of $67 50 by the Belt
Railroad engine, will not get their money
without a legal .battle. . Acting attorney
Stratton has advised the board that the
accident happened on State property, over
which City laws have no jurisdiction, and
that, therefore, the board is not liable. On
the motion of President Colnon it was de
dided to sustain the yardmaster and allow
Messrs. McNab & Smith to sue for the
$67 50 if they so desired.

Mayor Sutro Replies to Presi
dent Huntington's State
ments.
ONLY SERVE TO AMUSE HIM.
The Committee of Fifty Will Decide
on a Memorial to Congress
To-Day.
The expression on Mayor Sutro's face
underwent a variety of changes when he
read the dispatch recently received from
New York in which .C. P. Huntington is
credited with calling him a -'charlatan"
and "demagogue."
At first he was angry and showed it, but
presently, as he read, his eyes began to
twinkle, and he finally broke into a laugh
that showed that he was very much
amused. yy?"
"Huntington has lost his head," he said,
'â¢and begun "saying things that are palpably
falseâ that he knows to be false, and that
everybody who reads hisvaporings realizes
perfectly are false.
"It is this movement by the people of
Kentucky to take away the fraudulent
charter of the Southern Pacific Company
that has stirred the chief tentacle of the
octopus to squirm and writhe and roar
with the pair of exposure and possible de
feat. He sees that the people are gradua
ally being educated to a knowledge of his
wrongdoings and of the monstrous injury
the octopus is doing San Francisco and the
State of California. He knows that if they
are once roused and that if. the Legislature
of Kentucky repeals his charter he has
come to the end of his rope and must face
the inevitable result of his years of schem
ing and fraudâ must either come to the
bar of justice or leave the country.
"It may be that he will take the latter
course, for he has for years past been in
vesting his money in Africa and Mexico
and could get away with an immense for
tune, leaving but the dry carcass of the
corporation's industries and municipali
ties which he has sucked dry.
"The statements he makes are a tissue
of lies which need no explanations from
me to prove them such. They contain
nothing after all but a personal attack on
myself, for which I care nothing what
ever, considering the source. It is the old
scheme of throwing mud to divert atten
tion, and resembles the tactics of that
loathsome marine reptile after which I
have named the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which, when pursued, clouds the
water about it by exuding an Jinky fluid
and escapes in the obscurity.
"Huntington hopes to do this, but he
will not succeed, for he is hemmed in on all
sides by the line, of tne angry people, and
like a wolf is turning at bay."
â¢ The Committee of Fifty meets to-day to
discuss the memorial to Congress against
the passage of the funding bill and deter
mine which of the three documents pre
pared by M. M. Estee, John T. Doyle and
H. E. Highton shall be used as a basis for
the appeal from the people of California
to the National legislators. â¢
The position taken by Mr. Estee that the
defeat of the funding bill and not the Gov
ernment foreclosure of the mortgage on
the roads is the demand that should be
made by California is not exactly in ac
cordance with the views of some of the
other members of the committee, and a
lively debate is likely to be had on the
matter. " .- ? '

The Grand Lodge Supports a Free
Religious Hebrew In
stitution.
GRAND OFFICERS ELECTED.
Exciting Contest for the Office of
Grand Secretary â Amendments
to By-Laws.
The Grand Lodge of the B'nai B'rith
Society at its session yesterday took up
the question of a free religious school for
children of poor Hebrews, and after an
animated discussion resolved to have such
an institution capable of accommodating
1000 children. Though there were differ
ent views presented in the debate among
delegates on tnis religious school, yet
only one sentiment pervaded the speeches
â that present conditions called for a place
where the children could be educated in
their religion, in the Hebrew language, in
Jewish history and American history.
A law was passed finally authorizing
the appointment of a committee of seven
by the incoming grand president to devise
ways and means for the erection of a per
manent building for the B'nai B'rith free
religious schoois.
It was stated unofficially that the so
ciety owned a lot on Natoma street, be
tween Third and New Montgomery, and
seriously considered the advisability of
building there. The cost of the structure j
was limited to $3000. The Grand Lodge
subscribed $1700 for the maintenance of j
the school, and $300 was contributed by i
individual members.
For the first time in the history of the
order in this district a law was passed pro- '
viding that each retiring grand president i
be made a member of the executive com
mittee for the year after the expiration of
his term of office. The object of this in
novation was to give the committee the
benefit of his experience in connection !
with business affairs of the order.
By an amendment adopted the maxi
mum amount that can be charged a sus- 'â 
pended member seeking reinstatement
is $15.
At the opening of the afternoon session
in B'nai B'rith Hall the election of grand |
officers for the ensuing year was com
menced. It was late at night before all I
M. P. STEIN, FIRST GRAND VICE-PRESIDENT, I. O. B. B,
officers and committees of the Grand
Ixxige were elecied.
E. I. Wolfe, Creraieux Lodge, was placed \
in nomination by Lucius Solomons for i
prand president, and elected without, op- \
position. For lirst grand vice-president,
M. P. Stein of Hope Lodge, Stockton, was ;
nominated by H. Marks of Stockcon and |
elected. Edward Bare of Columbia Lodge
was the successful candidate for grand sec- \
ond vice-president. He was nominated by-
Henry Newman of Columbia Lodge.
The one exciting contest of the day was
the election of a grand secretary. Three
candidates were in the field, each with a
strong backing. Jacob Levison, Ethain
Lodge, the incumbent, was nominated
by Albert Elkus of Etham Lodge
and seconded by Gabriel Cohen, I.
N. Chcynski and Julius Platshek, all
of Ophir Lodcre. J. J. jW-heim,
Golden Gate Lodge, was nominated'
by Simon Baruch of Golden Gate Lodge
nhd seconded by D. S. Hirschberg. Adolph
Kronberg, the third aspirant, a member of
Unity Lodge, was presented by Joseph
Kotscbild of Unity Lodge and seconded by
S. 8. Green of Cremieux Lodge. The first
ballot gave Levison 51, Asclieim 45, Kron-
JULIUS PLATSUIiJi, GRAM? TREASURER, I. O. B. B. Â£
EDWARD I. WOLFE, GRAND PRESIDENT, I. O. B. B.
berg 30. The second stood 50, 46, 36. re
spectively, and when Kronberg withdrew
at the third trial Levison got 74 votes and
Ascheim 61. The number necessary for a
choice was 53.
Julius Platshek of Ophir Lodge was nom
inated by William Saalburg of Ophir
Lodge and declared the unanimous choice
for grand treasurer, to which office he was
therefore elected.
David Cohen nominated B. Flyshaker of
Modin Lodge for sergeant-at-arms, and Mr.
Flyshaker was elected.
A. ST. Levy was elected grand outside
watchman.
For grand trustees there were six nomi
nations: B. Harris, Carson Lodge; Philip
Stern, Modin Lodge; M. Marcuse, Oakland
Lodge; S. H. Shockew, Montefiore Lodge;
J. L. Franklin, California Lodge; S. Hoch
stadter, Miriam Lodge, Marysville. B.
Harris was elected on the first ballot, and
on the second Messrs. Franklin, Stern and
Shocken withdrew their names, leaving
Messrs. Hochstadter and Marcuse, who
were elected by acclamation.
The judicial tribunal of the district, fa
miliarly Known in the order as the dis
trict court, which has jurisdiction in all
questions of appeal from all subordinate
lodges in the district, was chosen, the fol
lowing grand delegates having been elected
thereto: Jacob Greenebaum, Joseph Bien,
Henry Schwartz, Lucius L. Solomon, D.
S. Hirschbere.
Marcus Levy, Ophir Lodge, and Mann
heim Marks, Montefiore Lodge, were ap
pointed tellers for the election, and S. Blu
mauer of Portland Lodge acted as judge
of election.
The contest of the ballot-box over, the
Grand Loiige settled down to the calm
consideration of amendments to by-laws
of the Grand Lodge. Hours were given to
debates, but the only change of much im
portance was that of making the retiring
grand president a member of the execu
tive committee.
At the close of the session Abraham
Jonas of Oakland, the retiring grand pres
ident, was presented with a diamond pin
and was invited to sit for his photograph

JOHN HAYS HAMMOND
Veterans of the Mexican War
Interest the President in
His Behalf.
Secretary Olney Writes That Every
thing Possible Is Being Done to
Protect 'Americans.
Colonel A. Andrews/acting on behalf of
the veterans of the Mexican war, wired
President Cleveland in behalf of John
Hays Hammond, now in prison at Pre
toria, South Africa, as a result of the
Transvaal complications.
Colonel Andrews yesterday received a
letter from Secretary Olney in reply. It is
as follows:
Department of State, Washington,/
Jan. 23, 1890. )
Colonel A. Andrews, Representative Mexican
Veterans, San Francisco, CaLâ : The Presi
dent has caused to be referred to this depart
ment your telegram to him of the 18th inst.
expressing the interest of the veterans of the
Mexican war in behalf of John Hays Ham
mond, now in prison at Pretoria.
In reply I have to gay that on the 12th inst.
telegraphic instructions were forwarded to our
consular agent at Johannesburg directing him
to render Mr. Hammond and other American
citizens all possible aid and protection. Sim
ultaneously Mr. Bayard, the United States Em
bassador at London,' was cabled, directing him
to apply at the Britifh Foreign Office with the
view that the pood offices of the British repre
sentatives In South Africa might be availed of
j for the protection of Mr. Hammond and the
I other American citizens understood to be in
j peril there.
In response to the telegram above men-
I tioned, Mr. 'Manion. our consular agent at
I Johannesburg, has telegraphed that the orders
given him are being obeyed, while Mr. Bayard
i cables that her Majesty's Government has ac
ceded to our request and that the British High
i Commissioner had- been instructed to see that
Mr. Hammond and any other American citi-
I zens involved in charges of rebellion In the
Transvaal receive all proper protection and
assistance. I have the honor to be, sir, your
i obedient servant, Richard Olney.
At a meeting of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association yesterday the fol
lowing resolution, introduced by Julian
Sonntag, was adopted:
WaratÃAS, This association has been in
formed that John 11. Hammond of California
and other American citizens are illegally re
strained of .their liberties iv prison in South
Afrit*; and whereas, it is the sentiment 01 the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
that everything should be done to secure the
release of said John H. Hammond and others.
Resolved, That the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association ot California hereby join
I .with others in requesting the Government of
i the United States to immediately take >uch
i active steps as may be deemed expedient
toward ameliorating the condition and secur
: ing the release of Mr. Hammond and others
j and the restoration of their property.
Resolved, That the secretary of this associ
i ation telegraph copies of these resolutions to
each of our Senators and Representatives.

Delay May Result m Loss of the
Home for Inebriates' Ap
propriation.
Dr. Gavigan Urges That a Site for the
Institution Be Chosen by the
Health Board. .
Dr. Gavigan, to whose efforts mainly is
due the possibility of a municipal home
for inebriates, says he has become deeply
concerned over the delay in the selection
of a site for the proposed institution. ;<
"The sum of $35,000 has been appro
priated by the Board of Supervisors for
the home," he said, "and that money
must be expended before the end of the
present fiscal year. So it is a case of
urgent necessity that the home be finished
before -July 1.
"The whole matter is in the hands of
the Hospital Committee of the Board o
Supervisors, but this committee ls waiting
the action of the Board of Health, and
consequently practically nothing has been
done by them. The committee has not
designated a site for the institution. The
selection of a site is the first step to be
taken, and once that were done the archi
tect could prepare his plans, and it would
not take more than four or five.months to
complete the home. If prompt action be
taken the building can be ready for occu
pancy by the end of the fiscal year. Mr.
Mooser has been appointed architect, but
he is waiting to hear from the Hospital
Committee before he can commence on his
plans. . â¢ 7 ' â " " ' "":'--.
"The intention is to open the home with
accommodation for fifty patients, and then
if the home should prove a public benefac
tion -the City authorities could enlarge it.
I see that the Receiving Hospital has not
sufficient or proper accommodations for
persons charged with insanity and de
tained pending examination. The home
would have ample accommodation for
such people," who would there be treated
accordine to the most approved methods
instead of r having them- locked? up in the
cold cells provided for them at the Receiv
ing Hospital. .'. " ---.â 'Â«'
. "However, if the Hospital Committee
and the Bourd of Health don't taue prompt
action there is a s possibility that the insti
tution cannot be * established before the
fiscal, year : ends, and in that case it is
doubtful if the present appropriation of
$35,000 can be used at all."

DRAGON AND "OLD GLORY"
Float Together Over the New
Low Quong Chung Chew
Clubhouse.
Opening Reception of an Association
Composed of Ejth Sam Yups
and See Yups.
The "stars and stripes" and the great
yellow dragon flag of China floated side
by side on the same pole yesterday over
the clubhouse of the Tinn Yee Kong Sow
Benevolent Association of the Low Quong
Chung Chew, at32}_ Waverlv place. With
in everything was in gala attire, as the or
ganization was giving an elaborate recep
tion to properly recognize the opening of
its rooms.
The organization, is incorporated under
the laws of California to. encourage matri
mony and the rearing of families, to care
for its members when they are sick and to
teach them American ways. Only mem
bers of the four great Low Quong Chung
and Chew families are eligible to member
ship, and there is already a large roll.
The many visitors yesterday were re
ceived by a committee, at the head of
which were Chew Haw, the president of
the association, and a large property
owner; Tim Cox, the secretary, and Chung
Ho, a director, who is also one of the pro
prietors of the Washington-street theater.
The rooms were shown with evident pride.
The furniture was of ebony, inlaid with
mother of pearl. There were -many'beau
tiful hangings of hand-embroidered silk.
A picture of Quong, the warrior king, was
back of the altar. The present altar will
soon be replaced by a very costly one that
has been ordered from China.
President Chew Haw is a fac-simile of
De Wolff Hopper dressed as Wang. He is
tall and slender, with an extremely, intelli
gent face. His mouth spreads in the same
strained and wide but good-natured smile
and his eyes are similar in every respect to
Wang's. He remarked that certain framed ' ..
writings on the wall were copies of wise
sayings. â A7'pa/ : 7..aT..
"Yes," exclaimed Secretary Tim Cox,
"they are like your American mottoes of
'God Bless Our Home' and 'Home, Sweet
Home,' you know. We want to have our
members feel at ease in their recreation
rooms."
The president explained here that the
order was not wholly social in its idea.
"We want our people to do away with
the hatchetmen in arranging disputes,"
he said, through Tim Cox. "The =. law ,
offers reparation, but often the Chinaman
doesn't know it. Our association will rem- 1
edy this. Many of the impositions we ]
now suffer under will also be removed."
When asked if the association were See
Yup or Sam Yup in its tendencies, Chew
replied that it was neither. r
"There are some Sam Yups and some |
See Yups in this room now,'';- he added..]'
"Members of the same family may belong j
to different societies, but they are related j
just the same and will not fight.; Our or
ganization of the Low Quong Chung Chew j
is higher than the two rival societies and a I
Sam Yup man will be frien lly with: the 1
See Yups lin ' this '{ organization t and *nn ;
enemy, of all others. They will come here [
together just as they worship in common
at our temple at 9 Brooklyn alley." "./:; '-,"
- The -temple in Brooklyn-alley contains i
carvings hundreds of years old and valued
at several thousand dollars. One piece,
over eight feet Jong, containing hundreds
of figures, is carved out of a single block of !
wood: The temple has a beautiful inlaid
sign; over the inner door which was pre
sented to it seven years ago by Chung Yum !
Fong, the then Minister from 1 China,' who
was at the time en route for Washington. f
A Genius in- looking Beefsteak,' "-
One man in this town, whose regular oc-
cupation is not that of a cook, increases
his income materially by cooking beef
steak so well that clubs are organized to
enjoy it. He has been doin-r this for half
a dozen years, and he learned the art of
cooking beefsteak from a man who had
made a business of it for a quarter of a
century. Most of these beefsteak suppers
are given in a hall on the West Side, near
Fift3 -ninth street, where this special cook
keeps his stove. He selects his steaks five
or six week 3 before they are cooked, and
keeps them in an ice box until they are
wanted. They are thick, jucy steaks, and
they are cooked over hickory coals and cut
and served between slices of bread. They
are almost as tender as the bread, and men
who have once enjoyed- them are slow in
ordering steaks in restaurants. During
the winter there are two of three beef
steak parties every week in this hall. The
guests sit around the stove on empty
boxes, and use neither knives nor forks.

BATTLE OP_OAPE ST. VINCENT.
A Combination ; of : Daring and Judg
ment Gave Victory to the English.'
As a naval action the battle of Cape St.
Vincent is distinguished by the firm reso
lution which, for sufficient reason,
dared to engage against odds so
1 great; by 'â â¢'â¢the promptitude and vigor
with which was seized the unfore
seen opportunity offered by the severance
of the Spanish fleet; by the sound judg
ment which led Jervis to attack the
weather division, though far larger, be
; cause the Tee could not for a long
time assist , it; and finally, by the
! brilliant inspiration and dauntless cour
j age which enabled Nelson, to redeem in
time the single capital oversight committed
by the commander-in-chief. This combi
nation of daring and judgment, of skillful
direction with energetic determination to
have none but great results, marked an
epoch in naval history.
Succeeding the dawn that glowed around
the names of Rodney, of Howe and of
Hood this achievement of Jervis foretok
ened the approach of that brilliant noon
tide of the British navy which was coin
cident with the career of Nelson, and cul
minated at Trafalgar. "777'

The date Sunday, March 8, has been left
open awaiting the decision of the National
Assembly of the League of American
Wheelmen, to be held next month in Bal
timore, as to whether or not the league will
sanction Sunday racing. If the decision is
favorable special events will be arranged,
â which will make this day one of the best
of the tournament. There will also be
held matinee races Saturday afternoon,
March 7, the events and prizes for which j
will be announced later.
The track to be put in the Pavilion will
be in position in time to give ample oppor
tunity for training upon it. Dressing
rooms for the riders will also be provided
in the Pavilion. The track will be eight
laps to the mile and will be constructed of
boards. The turns will be nearly five
times as great as those of the track put in
the Pavilion last year, having a radius of
100 feet, while the stretches will be 154 feet
in length. The track will be banked
throughout, with the exception of about
forty feet. It is expected to prove one of
the best indoor tracks ever constructed,
and besides being perfectly Eafe should aid
the men in making fast time.
The California Cycling Club will hold a
Â£arty at Mission Parlor Hall shortly after
ent. Messrs. Karl, Bent, Mayo, Wynne
and Harvey will direct the affair. The
club members are in constant training for
the 25-mile road race February 22.
Cycler is the name of a new bicycle pub
lication which has just appeared here. It

Charles H. Gard is conducting it and San
Francisco and San Jose are the locations
of its offices. The style of the paper is
unique and it will doubtless find welcome
among the wheeling public.
Mitchell M. Shields, a well-known cy
clist of Los Angeles, is in the City for a
short visit. He was a noted rider in the
days of the ordinary bicycle and even now
can hold his own with the safety riders.
It is stated that a member of the Reli
ance Club of Oakland, named Parks, who
is now in Southern California, has been
trying to get material for the club's relay
team from among the flyers of that part of
the State. He has found, however, that
every rider 'of any known ability has al
ready been spoken for and that they are all
members of the Bay City Wheelmen.
The visiting committee of the League of
American Wheelmen called upon the
Olympic Club Wheelmen and was very
cordially received. * The committee's future
engagements are: February 4, Liberty
Cycling Club; February 7, Alameda Cy
clers; February 14, Olympic Cyclers; Feb
uary 17, Imperial Cycling Club.
The Imperial Cycling Club's dance next
Friday evening at Union-square Hall is
attracting the attention of the cyclists of
both sexes and will be largely attended.
Sanford Plummer, captain of the Bay
City Wheelmen, who has been in South
ern California for a month past, will be
home Friday.
John H. Witts, the transcontinental
tourist from Fall River, Mass., will find
mail for him at the Bay City Wheelmen's
clubhouse, 441 Van Ness avenue, if he will
call.
The Bay City Wheelmen has its new
home-trainer in position and the riders
are using it all the time now. It is similar
to the machine described in The Call
bunday, January 19, except that the
rollers, are ten inches in diameter, being
double tbe usual size. This is found to be
a great advantage. The machine is a
double one, so that two can ride at one
time, and it will fit bicycles of any length
of wheel base. . The rollers are not ball
bearing, as they would then run too easily.
The club would be pleased to have any
wheelmen who are interested call and ex
amine it at the clubhouse any evening.
The San Jose Roaa Club held an enjoya
ble party last Monday evening.
There has been a slight dissension among
a few of the members of the San Francisco
Road Club, but the trouble is over now and
the club continues on in a prosperous way.
A JOCKEY'S DEFENSE.
Jasper Madison Claims Bartender
Murphy Was Going to Strike Him.
Jasper Madison, the colored jockey,
was arrested at the Bay District racetrack
yesterday afternoon by Policemen Brown
and Pyle and booked at the City Prison
on the charge of assault to murder.
Particulars of the assault were published
in yesterday's Call. The trouble occurred
in the Richmond saloon, Sixth avenue
and I) street, on Sunday night, when j
Hugh Murphy, the bartender, was cut in
the neck by Madison.
Madison said that he acted in self-de
fense. "Milroy," he said, "put down $2
to pay for the drinks, but Murphy said he
was 50 cents short. Milroy then took up
the $2 and threw a $5 gold piece* on the
bar. Murphy only gave him $1 50 back
and we all kicked. Murphy turned to me
and called me an offensive name. He
grabbed hold of something and came at
me from behind the bar." and to defend
myself I pulled out an old razor I use for
cutting my corns and slashed him in the
neck before he could hit me."
AT THE PARK.
The Storm Did Not Do Any Damage,
The Canal Being Torn
Down.
"The storm of the past few days," said
Superintendent McLaren of Golden Gate
Park yesterday, "did but very little dam
age, in fact less than has been done by
storms in years. It washed the dust off
the trees, however. Strawberry Hill stood
it well and the water that washed down its
sides escaped through a sewer under the
lake."
The superintendent explained that
Strawberry Hill is composed of red rock
and provisions were made to prevent the
rainwater that in winter washed down its
sides from entering the lake. The water
ho said is so deeply colored that if it en
tered the lake it would redden it to such a
degree that for weeks it would look like
the Red Sea in miniature, and it was for
this reason that drains were built under
the foundation of the lake.
Some of the roads off the main ones were
slightly cut up, but these can be repaired
with a few cartloads of soil.
Yesterday the full force of men were at
work at the site of the new music con
course. The trees that were crowing in
the grand court of the Midwinter Fair are
being removed and transplanted to the
f rounds that were occupied by the Vienna
'rater. In the place of those that are be
ing removed there will be planted shade
trees, poplars, maples and sycamores.
These will be planted in such a manner as
to give the greatest amount of shade to
those who in the future will assemble to
listen to the concerts.
The once famous canal operated on the
hill west of the casino is being taken down,
the venture no longer paying. It was a
fad that lasted for a time, but people tired
of it and the income of late was not suffi
cient to meet operating expenses.
A. J. SMITH EXONERATED.
It Was a Case of Two Men Hav
ing the Same Name and Both
Having Claims.
The Accused Showed That He Had Done
His Utmost to Find Out Why the
Draft Was Sent
The peculiar coincidence of two men
having the same name and both having
claims against the Government was a
cause of a very unpleasant experience for
one of them; but, fortunately, the matter
ended. in a complete exoneration of him
yesterday.
On Friday a confidential employe of the
Treasury Department, A. J. Smith by
name, was arrested on complaint of
Cashier Thomas P. Burns of the United
States Sub-treasury for having obtained
$18 75 on a warrant which was really in
tended for another A. J. Smith. The
other A. J. Smith had been a dealer in
liauora and cigars, and having given up
his business before the time his internal
revenue licenses expired he was entitled
to some rebate for the stamps he had left
over. This rebate was sent by the Treas
ury Department, but it fell into the hands
of the first mentioned A. J. Smith, and as
this particular A. J. Smith had claims
ntrainst tbe Government for services ren
dered to both the internal revenue and
customs divisions he supposed the money
was for him and cashed the piece of paper
as a matter of course.'
A. J. Smith, the accused, had done some
work in the line of securing evidence in
connection with the Emerald gang of
smugglers, and he naturally supposed the
check was a part of his compensation.
The Government, according to his state
ment, made him a special emyloye for
several months. He had also secured in
formation in reference to some smuggled
opium, silks and cigars which came on the
steamer Colon, and he also had a claim
against Chinese inspector M. B. Hereley
of Chicago for $30 for services in securing
evidence regarding the circulation of
fraudulent Chinese certificates in China
town.
The treasury draft, when it was received,
was duly indorsed by Smith, the special
employe. Subsequently the right Smith
appeared at the sub-treasury and made
inquiry as to why a warrant intended for
him had been utilized by a person to whom
it did not belong. There it was. however,
in Mr. Burns' pile of papers, with the
name "A. J. Smith" on its back.
Mr. Burns called to account the Smith
who got the money and advised him to
make it good. At first Smith, the recip
ient, thought it best to go and make in
quiries of Deputy Surveyor Samuel J.
Kuddell and the internal revenue officers.
He had long before written a Jettei of in
quiry to the Treasury Department and
the answer was such that he thought the
matter was all right. However, he con
cluded to pay back the $18 75 to Mr. Burns
and the right Smith got the money.
All this came out before "United States
Commissioner Heacock yesterday, and as
tbe Commissioner was of the opinion that
there was no intent to defraud, he dis
charged the accused. Judge Heacock
thought Smith had gone very much out of
his way to ascertain the true status of the
affair, considering the ci.cvm stances, and
had done more than could be expected.
Mr. Smith handled his own case, acting
as his own attorney. T 4-4
WATCHING THE MEAT.
Harbor Commissioners Asked to Co

of Health.
The Board of Health, in order to com
plete its already efficient system of meat
and milk inspeciion in this City, has asked
the co-operation of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners. The following letter was
sent to the guardians of the bay yesterday:
To the Board of Harbor Commissionersâ Gen
tlemen: The Board ot Health ol the City and
County of San Francisco, having in mind a
more thorough public inspection of all milk and
meat entering the City, very respectfully begs
to direct the attention of your honorable body
to the fact that a very large portion of these
supplies arrives at the water front. before dis
tribution throughout the City.
An inspection would, therefore, not only be
greatly facilitated, but rendered far more
efficient, if your honorable board deemed it
feasible to grant the request of your petition
ers, which is to , set aside a place or room on
the water front where such inspection could
take place, both during the day and night in
the manner indicated. Very respectfully,

three or "four races sent a telegram with
the results, and in return received a bun
dle of dispatches from the operator,; the
latter, no doubt, purporting to be com
missions to be placed for the downtown
house. The commissioner sicned his name
but once for all of these valuable messages,
which were written in cipher, and if the
money was bet the City customers must
have got decidedly the worst of the betting,
for he never got dangerously near the bet
ting: "Possibly* the laxity shown by
the track management in not using more
strenuous efforts to prevent the results of
the different races being sent forth is be
cause of the wheel game fostered by the
club, that is a source of such rich income,
and they fear that pulling the monkey's
tail may cause the lion to roar.
The racing was very commonplace, with
one exception the different events all being
cheap selling affairs. Favorites took three
races.
Very few of the crowd supposed old
Oregon Eclipse a dangerous factor in the
opening short six-furlong run, and he was
neglected in the betting with odds cf 20
and 25 to 1 about him. Getting away in
front, he â  led all the way, and passed the
wire a scant length in front of the 6 to 5
favorite, Realization.
The next event at seven and a half fur
longs was run over the inside course,
partly up and down hill. Ida H was a
2 to 1 favorite and failed to get inside the
money. The 11 to 5 second choice as
sumed the lead the last sixteenth and won
easily, with Zaragoza finishing in the
place. Robin Hood I, who made the run
ning to the stretch, finished third.
The third race over the short six-furlong
route wa; nothing but an exercise canter
for the 7: to 5 favorite, Midlo, who won
pulling v, , with Syndicate in the place. .
. Big things were expected of the Syca
more stable's Gilead, with Bergen up, in
the mile run, but he proved a disappoint
ment, finishing in the far rear. The 2to 1
favorite Moderocio took the lead on the
backstretch and won as he pleased by four
lengths. In a hard drive Chorn, en Ike L,
got his mount home a nose in front of
Little Bob, ridden by Hinrichs.
The Burns and Waterhouse entry Palo
macita opened a 11 to 5 choice for the fifth
event on the card, a short six-furlong spin,
but receded in the betting to 10 to 1 around
post time. The play was principally on
'on Gara, Pollock and Miss Ross, the lat
ter closing a slight favorite. Palomacito
set out to make the running when the flag
fell, but near the half was cut off by Pol
lock, with Chorn up, and never cut much
of a figure thereafter. Pollock was never
headed and won easily by two lengths,
with Jack Atkins in the place. Virgia A
was a poor third.
The last number on the programme was
another seven-and-a-half-furlong run over
the inside course, with eight starters.
Getting away from the post second, Moni
tor/equal choice in the betting with W. L.
Munson, soon showed in the lead and won
ridden out, a length in front of Comrade.
The long-priced outsider Eckert waa third.
Track and Paddock Items.
The judges fined Jerry Chorn, who rode
Pollock, $50 for cutting Palomacita off.
Little Donovan rode the Burns & Water
house entry, and it is said Jerry "had it in
for him." Jerry was called before the
stewards at the conclusion of the racing,
and they will investigate the latter asser
tion. - zy- -."â ' â¢"â¢â 
Eolo, Lew Weir and the other horses
recently purchased by A. B. Spreckels are
due to arrive to-day.
Trappean was lame when he went to the
post, and when too late his trainer wished
to have him excused.
Mr. Wibaux, the Montana plunger, is
said to have quit about $10,000 loser on the
day.
1 lie Board of Stewards of the California
Jockey Club last night decided to receive
no more entries from J. P. Woolman, on
account of the running of Montana at
Ingieside on January 20. It was thought
that the best interests of racing would be
served by the ruling.
FASCINATED BY A WOMAN
Ebenezer F. Dunton Tells of
Mamie Barnum's Influence
Over Him.
Defies All the Rules of Court, and
Entreaty and Threat Prove 7
Useless to Stop Him.
Ebenezer F. Dunton, the war veteran,
afforded considerable entertainment to the
habitues of Judge Campbell's court yester
day afternoon when he appeared on the
witness-stand to relate his adventure last
Wednesday with Mamie Barnum and
Kittie Nelson. He started off by declaring
he wanted a "square deal," and he seemed
determined to have it.
The Judge confessed that Dunton was
the most garrulous witness he had seen in
his court. He was implored again and
again to confine himself to answering the
questions put to him, but it was no use.
Every answer was accompanied by his
thoughts, impressions or sensations, and
after the court stenographer had filled one
book and started to get another the Judge,
almost with tears in his eyes, begged him
to be guided by tbe rules of the court,
adding: "Your garrulity will cost the
City and County $500, as that man,". point
ing to the stenographer, "gets 15 cents a
folio." But the appeal was in vain.
, Attorney Joseph F. Coffey, who repre
sented the Prosecuting Attorney, had to
ask the Judge to protect him from Dun
ton's impertinent sallies. Dunton, because
Coffey persistently asked him to say
"yes" or "no" to his questions, got mad,
and insolently remarked, "I should judge
you are the defendant, and not these
women." At another time Coffey asked
to see the purse which the Barnum
woman took from Dunton, and Dunton
handed it to him gingerly. After it was
handed back to him Coffey asked, "How
much money is in the purse now?"
"Well," said Dunton, looking at him sig
nificantly, "there was $80 when I gave it
to you, but I don't know how much there
is now."
Attorney Mack, who appeared for the
defendant, often crossed swords with
Dunton during his cross-examination, and
at one time Mack became so exasperated
that he threatened to ask the Judge to
commit him for contempt unless he kept
a civil tongue in his head. At another
time Dunton would not stop talking, and
both Mack and Coffey shouted in despair,
"Who's running this court?"
Dunton testified that -until six months
ago he was chief steward of the main din
ing-hall at the Soldiers' Home, Yount
ville. He came to the City on December
22, and had been staying at the Mozart
House on Ellis street, near Taylor.
Last Wednesday morning he was look
ing into the show-window of a store on
Market street when the two defendants
came up to him, one on each side of him.
They made suggestions which surprised
and shocked him, and he got away from
them as quickly as possible. He turned
into Grant, avenue and was loosing into
the window of the store next No. 21 when
the two women came up to him again.
They talked to him, and he admitted
that Mamie Barnum by her fascinating
manners exercised a powerful influence
over him. She got him into the
recess of the doorway of No. 21, and as she
bent down to take one of her cards out "bf
her stocking, where she said she kept
them, he put his hand into his pocket and
missed his purse, which contained $100 in
gold and about $4 in silver.
"I grabbed bold of her with both hands,"
he continued, "and the door of No. 21 flew
open. She went inside and I followed, still
holding her, and the door closed behind
us. For fifteen minutes I used both per
suasion and force to get her to give me
back my money. She hit me in the eye
and jabbed my hands with a long steel
instrument, which the. police told me was
used by pickpockets, but would not give
me the purse. The people in the house
came downstairs and she told them I was
crazy, and they went back again' without
paying any attention to me. At last the
purse dropped on the floor and the money
fell' out of it, and, still holding her, I
picked it up. Then the door opened and
we went out on the sidewalk."
For ten minutes he struggled with her
on the sidewalk, while a large crowd
gathered and a spirit of humiliation came
over the woman, and he thought he had
humbled her. 'â ', She showed him the purse
and begged him to let her go, as he had
got back all his money; but he knew he
was $20 short, and he kept his grip on her.
The Nelson girl told her to give him back
all of his money, and for that he felt grate
ful ito her. Finally two : policemen ap
peared and the Barnum woman was ar
rested.
He created a sensation by stating that
a young man who said he belonged to the
court called upon him last Thursday and
wanted him to compromise the case, but
as neither of the defendants was present
the matter was stricken out of the record.
Then he stated, how he had chased and
captured Kittie Nelson in the Baldwin
Hotel. â â â *.
Policeman Campion testified, to arrest
ing; Mamie Barnum on : Grant avenue on
the complaint of Dunton who, said . she
had robbed him of ; $20. This closed the
case for the. prosecution and on motion
the Nelson girl was discharged from cus
tody.,
The defense will be submitted to-day.
Run Over by a Buggy.
/: J. Hannan, an old man living at the head

ONLY FOR RICH BOXERS
Rules That May Destroy the
Sport of Fisticuffs on
This Coast.
IS THE UNION USELESS?
Walter Watson, the Olympic Club
Instructor, Gives Some Timely
Warning.
While the committee appointed by the
Pacific Coast Amateur Athletic Associa
tion is investigating certain charges that
have been preferred against members of
clubs that compose the Pacific Association
rumor says that several prominent ath
letes who have grown tired of being gov
erned by the strict laws of the Amateur
Athletic Union are now planning with a
view of organizing an association which,
if perfected, will be known as the Pacific
Coast Amateur Athletic Association, with
headquarters in this City.
In other words, the disgruntled athletes
are anxious to "break away" from the A.
A. U. and establish an association on this
coast which will be governed by rules
more suitable to the wishes of "the home"
athletes than those of the union, which
are considered too exacting.
Apropos of the present athletic disturb
ance, Walter Watson, the boxing in
structor of the Olympic Club, said:
"As a means, of Keeping the amateur
athletes within bounds of clean athletics I
think that the rules of tbe amateur union
should be strictly enforced; but I consider
them rather too exacting, however, for the
present time.
"Several years ago the sportsmen of the
old country (.England), who took much in
terest in athletic sport of all kinds, deter
mined to formulate a scheme by which
they could segregate the rich from the
poor. Amateur clubs were organized and
according to rules that were there estab
lished sons of rich men only could afford
the honor of being members. Mechanics,
clerks, etc., were ostracised. Matters pro
gressed smoothly for a time, but when
amateur boxing tournaments were intro
duced the gentlemen sportsmen did not
take very kindly to 'nose bleeds' and
'black eyes,' and as a consequence the
clubs had to admit some of the clerks and
mechanics, who did not mind an occasioual
drubbing, to membership.
"The rivalry that sprung up among the
clubs brought about a demand for fistic
talent, and this occasioned the dissolution
of some of the most prominent athletic
organizations because the aristocrats did
not desire to affiliate with the so-called
plebeian members.
"The athletic clubs subsequently became
quite cosmopolitan, and amateur boxing
contests were looked upon as the great
feature of indoor sport.
"It was during the days of the select set,
when the sons of wealthy men composed
the athletic organizations, that the ama
teur rules were framed, and, with the ex
ception of a few changes, the same laws
exist to-day. The rich young men did not
care a fig for money, of course, and such a
thing as training expenses was not
dreamed of. Why, the proposition would
be considered outrageous.
"When the hardy mechanics and other
true sportsmen who were not born with
silver spoons in their mouths became
members of the clubs first-class exhibitions
of boxing were witnessed, but a general
objection was made from the beginning to
the rules that were made solely for those
gentleman-sportsmen who did not have to
work for a living.
"The contestants in wrestling, boxing,
etc., grew tired of winning medals, and
many of the most polished boxers refused
to appear before the clubs unless they were
allowed training expenses, which, under
the rules, they could not have.
"As previously stated, good boxers and
wrestlers could not be secured from the
ranks of the 'upper ten,' and when the
mechanics and clerks who were earning
small salaries withdrew from the clubs
membership gradually dwindled, and with
the exception of those clubs that cater to
outdoor sports, such as running, walking,
etc., there remain in old England very few
of the once-famous amateur athletic organ
izations under whose colors many great
boxing tournaments were held.
"It seems to me that the same condition
of affairs is rapidly gaining a foothold in
this country. The young men who box
before the Olympic Club cannot afford to
train for a month or so at their own ex
pense just for the honor of being called
champions should they be so fortunate as
to win a $35 medal. With few exceptions
the lads who box are earning very small
salaries, and I am strongly of the oninion
that if the rules were changed so" as to
allow the boys their training expenses
there would be better sport witnessed and
a more general desire on the part of
sportsmen who fancy boxing to become
members of this grand club.
"Boxing is unquestionably the most
interesting of all indoor sports, and judg
ing from the large gatherings at club en
tertainments I think there are many mem
bers who will coincide with me in the
statement that to strengthen the member
ship the club should cater to the amateur
boxers, who are rapidly becoming dis
gusted with rules which were intended
only to govern gentlemen of means and
leisure." â  'â

WROTE "A GILDED GOD."
The Latest Interview With Mrs.
E. Burke Collins.
Famous Novelist Recovered From
Nervous Prostration.
Paine's Celery Compound Made Her
Vigorous and Energetic.
Dv Maurier has made Paris studios
familiar to every one. But not until the
appearance of Mrs. E. Burke Collins' story
of "A Gilded God" did novel-readers
dream of the wealth of material ready for
some gifted novelist's pen in the brilliant
artist life of our own New Orleans.
In a recent interview by a New Orleans
paper she said: "Of course, to a certain
extent my characters are drawn from life,
though never exact portraits. My favorite
heroine is Mam'selle in my story of a
â¢Modern Heathen.' No, I rarely urge
aspirants to take up a literary career.
Success is obtained only at the price of the
most exhausting labor."
Although Mrs. Collins' writing has
always been a labor of love, yet such inces
sant mental exertion could not fail to have
its effect on her nervous system.
At one time she found herself tired out
and weak from her uninterrupted work;
she became nervous and incapable of work;
she even saw nervous prostration staring
her in the face. The general toning up
that her system needed so badly she found
in Paine's celery compound. To-day she
is perfectly well and strong again, busy as
ever with her brain and pen, and grateful
to Paine's celery compound for the timely
help when failure and trouble and despair
seemed about to close round her and shut
her off from everything that was dear.
" Your constant brain work must tell on
your strength," observed the reporter.
" Yes; you have no idea how much. I am
at my desk for nine or ten hours a day,"
she replied, "I am careful to obey the
I laws of health, and I am never without a
supply of Paine's celery compound. Wh.n
I feel weak and nervous and there is a
heaviness in my brain or a shooting pain
over the eyes, which warns me that my
energy is flagging, I take a little of the
compound, and I am strong and free from
pain at once. I never enjoyed such buoy
ancy of spirits and soundness of body be
fore I made t_e acquaintance of Paine's
celery compound. â¢ Scarcely a day passes
that I do not urge some friend to take it.
For neuralgia, indigestion, nervous pros
tration and blood disorders, I am con
vinced that there is nothing like Paine's
celery compound. lam not "surprised that
physicians use it in difficult cases."
Paine's celery compound is found to best
supply the great need of studious, seden
tary people. Its extensive use by brain
workers, both men and women, suffering
from sleeplessness, indigestion or other
effects of a deficient nerve force, shows its
ability to feed tired, emaciated, nervous
tissues. Nothing else has ever possessed
anything like the power of Paine's celery
compound to restore a healthy nervous
tone to the entire body, and to thoroughly
cleanse the blood. School teachers, pro
fessional men, newspaper men, ministers,
public officials, men whose daily outlay of
vitality, because of hard, trying, anxious
work, is excessive, find renewed strength,
not only of the nerves, but through their
healthy action, of the entire body, in
Paine's celery compound. Its use shortly
dispels headaches, rheumatic pains, dys
pepsia, heart trouble, general debility and
languor, and all other outward signs of
the grave mischief that comes from dis
ordered nerves and impure blood.

THE REPUBLIC.
Catholicism and Eloquence
at the Metropolitan
Temple.
A HISTORICAL REVIEW.
Ex-Judge Sullivan Holds a Big
Audience for an Hour
and a Half.
CATHOLICS AS * PATRIOTS.
Deny That a Union of Church and
State Has Ever Been
Desired.
Judge J. F. Sullivan, the eloquent de
fender of Catholicism, entertained an im
mense audience at Metropolitan Temple
last night for nearly an hour and a half,
his subject being "The Church and the
Republic," and his treatment of it a
scholarly and comprehensive survey of
Romanism in its connection with liberty
and republican principles in both America
and Europe.
His discourse was one of a series of pop
prular educational lectures being given in
support, of the teachings and principles of
the Roman Catholic faith. Again and
again the speaker was interrupted by en
thusiastic applause that came from fully
bOO women and from nearly as many men.
At the close of the masterly effort pro
longed applause rumbled through the
great auditorium , only to be finally taken
up and continued by a solo by Professor
Harrison upon the big organ.
On the platform with the speakers were
Fathers Mulligan. Cullens, Connolly,
Dugan, Prendergast, Ferguson, Ramon,
Heslin, Lyons and Paul P. Hay.
During his discourse ex-Judge Sullivan
said:
Indies and Gentlemen : Between the snow
crowned summits of our Sierras and the Pa
cific sea. I have always thought that we had
garnered the most cosmopolitan and the most
liberal-minded population in the world. Our
people come from every part of the habitable
globe. When they s"tand upon the soil of
this Republic they stand redeemed, regener
ated, disenthralled, under the influence of
universal emancipation. I have thought that
upon the soil of this far Western commonwealth
there might never be developed any of the foul
growth-* that in older lands attest the spirit
of religious bigotry. From Shasta to San
Diego 1 have at times journeyed through our
great commonwealth, and have felt that the
cross tnat surmounts our houses of worship
might, at least in this state, feel that no un
kindly hand might do it violence. To me
that cross stands as a symbol that has followed
the journeying- of the sun from its far eastern
rising until It stands to-day facing the western
wave as the symbol of a world conquered to
civilization.
The American Catholic is sometimes regarded
by his fellows as especially regardful of the
duties of his religion and by reason of that
very fait is suspected as being unmindful of
the duties that he owes the State. As a native
American, lovin_ the land of my birth, i
proud of her history, believing in the under- i
lying principles of our Government and hope- I
ul of the maintenance and the perpetuation 'â 
of her institutions in all their integrity. I have I
at times given some thought to the question:
Is there any antagonism between the teachings
of the Catholic church and those sacred prin
ciples of human liberty upon which my coun
try's greatness has been builded up.
It may be said with truth that American
Catholics are singularly loyal in their adher
ence to the teachings and the practice of their
faith, but it may likewise be said with truth
that in so far as we observe the teachings of
our church we become better qualified for the
responsible duties of American citizenship and
more worthy of their enjoyment.
In keeping alive the religious sentiment we
feel that we render a service to our country.
In doing so we seek not to establish any dis
tinction among citizens on the score of reli
gion. We seek not to build up any line of
separation or exclusion among the fellow
citizens of a Christian commonwealth. We
are not unmindful of the sad lessons written
ia characters of blood, which the religious
controversies of other lands, yes, and of our
own land, exhibit to the eye "of the student.
No strife is so bitter, so unrelenting, so un
christian as that which is born of bigotry.
COMPOSITE CHARACTER OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
Of all the countries in the world ours is the
one from which this grim-visaged specter, con
jured from a dead past, should be most sol
emnly exorcised.
The mighty streams whose confluence have
formed the vast ocean of our National exist
ence represent as many different sources as
there are nationalities on the face of the earth.
They have borne along with them as an integ
ral constituent of their volume the character
istics and religious sentiments of the lands in
â which they have had their origin. May our
country, which has amalgamated 60 many
diverse elements of nationality into a homo
geneous whole of consistent American citizen
ship, behold in the diverse elements of the
Christian community so many factors working
without antagonism for the development of a
religious sentiment throughout the Nation.
SEPARATION OF. CHURCH AND STATE. .
As Americans we may well rejoice that here
every man's religion is a voluntary offering of
the creature to the Creator, pure and free as
the vapory offering of Jake and stream and
sea, that rises in adoration to the God of day
to receive and reflect his glories and to light
his altars of the opening and the closing day.
Here we have the absolute separation of
church and state, which conduces alike to the
promotion of true religion and the perpetua
tion of sound civil government.
Of ell men. those most to be avoided
in daily life, in my judgment, are political
parsons, and those most deserving, if there be
any such, in my judgment, of the contempt of
their fellow-men, are political priests.
CATHOLICS LOYAL TO THE REPUBLIC
â¢ This essential distinction between the civil
and ecclesiastical jurisdictions, so well under
stood by Catholics, is at times misapprehended
and the assertion is made that we render civil
allegiance to a foreign princeâ the Roman
pontiff. As Catholics we recognize his juris
diction in purely ecclesiastical matters, but
the acknowledgment of that jurisdiction is in
no way inconsistent with our civil allegiance
to our country, our social duties as citizens, or
our lights as "men. ._,*:
One land only claims our allegiance as citi
zens, and that is the land of "the free heart's
hope and home," our own, our native land.
So beautiful and grand, ' â¢
Our own. our native land:
Ol thee we boast.
Great Empire of the West,
The dearest and the best,
Made up of all thereat,
We love the most.
Our country's flag is dear to us beyond any
human form of expression. Its folds are next
our hearts, its memories our proudest heritage,
its security our most sacred care.
To the flag we render the supremest loyalty
of our being. On our part no act of cowardice
or treachery, no lack of civic virtue shall tend
to iv degradation. We shall permit no unholy
hand to profane its folds, no impious tongue to
revile It.
We love our Californian landâ land of
sunshine.fruit and flowers. We love her for her
own sake. We love her because she is fair and
comely among her sister States. But we love
her most of all because she is a sovereign State
of the great American Union. It shall be our
ambition to secure for her among her sister
States an honored standing on r account of the
intelligence, the manhood and moral wealth
of ncr people. The State whose rugged moun
tains enfold the richest treasures of the uni
; verse, whose hills and valleys teem with the
rich fruitage of grain and wine, shall also rear
such a race of rugged, honest men and fair,
virtuous women as will form a fitting comple
ment to the wealth and beauty with which
God and nature have endowed her.
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH FRIENDLY TO CIVIL
LIBERTY.
Some years ago a distinguished Frenchman,
Alexis deTocqueville, visited the United States
for the purpose of taking a philosophical sur
vey of our institutions and our people, and the'
results of his investigations were published in
Â» book styled -'Democracy in America." lie
devotes a chapter to the progress of Roman
Catholicism m .the United States, in the course
ot which he uses this language: "America is
the most democratic country in the world, and
it is at the same time the country in which
the Roman Catholic religion makes most prog
ress.
The fact then noted by him has been verified
by the statistics covering the intervening
period. ..â¦â¢-'â " Â»â  &
The latest available figures give the Catholic
population of the United States at something
in the neighborhood of 10,000,000, and show
that the members of thai church exceed in
numbers any other denomination of Chris
tians; that there are nearly half as many
Catholics as Christians of ail denominations
combined. .>
It may be safely assumed as a fact that the
Catholic church is steadily increasing in num
bers in the United States. Is that fact really a
source of alarm to the lovers of the Republic?
As a matter of fact, is there anything in the
doctrines of the Catholic cnurch which favors
one form of government more than another?
Is there any article of faith propounded to its
followers which characterizes a monarch as
superior to an aristocracy, or the latter as bet
ter than a pure democracy? Is not the meas
ure of human conduct covered by the Catholic.
code broad enough to cover with its beneficent
embrace every form of government?
The Catholic church bestows its affection and
fostering care alike on the subjects of every
form of government.
Tne plan of the organization of the church is
based on a system of equal rights to participa
tion in ail its functions and ministrations. No
race of people is denied the privileges of its
ministry. No child of poverty is so lowly or so
untowardly circumstanced in his surroundings
as to be denied on that account any station for
which his virtues and his intellectual attain
ments may prove him qualified.
Her ministers being confined to a life of
celibacy, there can arise no hereditary caste
with exclusive privileges within her ranks.
With her "honor and fame from no con
ditions rise." The miter, the cardinal's hat and
the tiara have never been held as the prize of
birth or riches. .-. -â¢ â¢"'-.* , 7/ '*'""'"",'"â¢â 
But for the influence of the church barbarism

DEVELOPMENT OF POPULAR RIGHTS UNDER MON
ARCHICAL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT.
During the gradual evolution of the various
governments of Europe the influence of the
Catholic church was predominant.*
If that influence was despotic in its ten
dency we would find the evidences of it in the
lack of restraint imposed upon the sovereign
power in the various countries. But every
where we find that monarchs were restrained
by obligations to rule consistently, with reason
and justice.
In Germany a form of limited monarchy
prevailed. The Emperors shared legislative
â¢authority with the Diet, composed of the
Princes of provincial states; and these in turn
had their own provincial stales, composed of
their feudal vassals and tneir mediate towns
within their territory in which they managed
their own local affairs. Taxes could not be im
posed without the consent of the states. We
find that various German cities enjoyed elec
tive privileges in the selection of municipal
officers. The Diet of Frankfort in 1344 was
made up of electors, Princes and deputies.rep
resenting cities. '.*...,
In Spain we find that in "the kingdom of
Aragon the sovereigns were â¢ elected by the
Barons; and no King could assume sway until
he had sworn to observe the laws and liberties
of the realm.
And what do we -.find in England as to the
development of liberty during the period of
Catholic a'scendncy? We find that popular
rights had a healthy growth. The constitu
tion of England is not, like our organic charter
of liberties, laid down clearly within the
bounds of a written constitution. Its exist
ence is not reckoned from a certain date. But
there ls one event of paramount importance
in the constitutional development of British
liberty, and that is the grant of the great char
ter of liberties made by King John to his
Barons on the plains of Runnymede in the
year 1215. That charter, is the essential
groundwork on which is reared the super
structure of British civil liberty. It gave a sa
credness and inviolability to rights of property
and personal liberty.
They were Catholic barons who gathered on
the banks of the Thames to demand the recog
nition of this principle of equal distribution
of civil rights to all classes. Foremost among
those men clamoring in the cause of human
liberty stood Stephen Langton, the Catholic
Archbishop of Canterbury, and he was the first
to set his name as a witness to the charter
which was there attested.
CATHOLIC REPUBLICS. .
And during these ages, which witnessed the
curtailment of despotic power, we find that
popular forms of government took root and
nourished.
The government which without change has
stood the severest test of time was a republic
founded by a monk as early as the fourth cen
tury. Radical in its democracy, free as the
mountain air of the Appenines, in which- it
gloried, the very slightest exercise of papal
power would have been sufficient at anytime
tor centuries to dissipate the little republic of
San Marino, and yet it has flourished for fifteen ;
centuries. - â  ' â¢* , *T*t"-*MilMpE^
Another republic of â  great antiquity we find
in the heart of the Pyrenees. Granted its* in
dependence by Charlemagne, and largely
under church Influence ever since, the repub
lic of Andorra has elected its presidents and
legislative councils with the same regularity
with which we Americans indulge in similar
luxuries.
Not only on the mountain sides do we find
the development of republican- ideas. Away
down by the sunlit sea, .asking beneath the
mild Italian skies and fanned by the gentle
breezes of the Adriatic, the islanders of Venice
treasured alike their Catholicity and their lib
erty.
Thus far I have endeavored to show by facts
gathered from the varied history ot European
countries that during the time of the exclusive
ascendency of the Catholic church there was a
steady, healthy development , of popular con
trol over despotic power in monarchical coun
tries, and that in countries most immediately
in contact with the Roman Pontiff there was a
widespread and deep-rooted devotion, not only
to republican principles, but also to repub
lican forms of government.
Did the Reformation," a3 one of its conse
quences, bring about an immediate advance of
popular rights ? History says n0... In England
the reigns of Henry VIII and Elizabeth afford
instances of : the most galling despotism. The*
tyranny exercised by these monarch, under
their dual authority jj as. head . of the church

monarchy triumphed simultaneously through
out Europe.
And how do we find the case after ,the lapse
of the intervening centuries? What single
Protestant republic has risen in Europe above
the ruins of Catholic despotism? lls Germany,
in the harsh grasp of her Iron Chancellor, to
be commended as a type of popular govern
ment? Strong, intellectual, perhaps the master
force in the future map-making of Europe, is
her Emperor at this day bound effectually by
that rule that regulated medieval Germany,
that taxation should be by the consent of
those taxed? " :**â 
But there has arisen upon the scene of Euro
pean politics a young republic. Catholic
France, the ancient ally of the struggling
American colonists, has claimed â  for her chil
dren that form of government which she so
largely helped to secure to us.
REPUBLICS OF THE NEW. WORLD.
But events occurring toward the close cf the
fifteenth century opened up a new world to
civilization. Isabella, the Catholic of Castile,
commissioned : the Genoese navigator to prove
his faith in the rotundity of the earth and to
open up to civilization" and Christianity the
unknown land beyond* the Western waters.
The chimera of Columbus assumed the garb
of fixed fact, and a ; new continent, boundless
in resources, lay open to the conquest of
civilization and Christianity. Hero was to be
planted upon the virgin soil of our Western
continent the seed of that well-developed
| civilization which, in Europe, had had the
j growth of centuries. Here were to be estab
lished those governmental g%rms which should
I develop into the most perfect type of civil or
j ganism. â¢ From Alaska to Patagonia the soil
j seems to have been fertile for republican prin
i ciples. Since Brazil has transformed her lim
ited monarchy into a republic the whole of
South America, with the exception of the colo
nies of Guiana, is covered over with republics.
And the populations of these South American
republics is almost exclusively Catholic. The
same statement maybe made as to the Mex
ican and Central American republics. .>â ... ;^"
CATHOLICS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Ana how have Catholics conducted them
selves during the growth of this greatest and
best republic of the world? Have they done
their full proportion of the work in laying the
foundations of the Government and rearing
the superstructure of her greatness? Have
they shown a due appreciation for the bless
ings of civil and religious liberty?. Were they
royalists or traitors in the mighty struggle
that the colonists waged for human freedom?
In the council chamber where the Declara
tion of Independence was formulated they
were to be found. P-MjWggl lll !** ' V__r* â
In the fierce conflict of the Revolution the
Catholics joined their fellow-colonists with all
their energy and all their resources for the
common cause. No Catholic traitor Is held up
to our execration during the struggle.
They shared the decks of American ships
with saucy. Jack Barry, the first commo
dore of the American navy. They stood beside
the Irishman's son, Andrew Jackson, behind
the cotton bales of New Orleans, in defense of
their country, and with him they stood within
the hallowed precincts of the Catholic church
of New Orleans when grand old Bishop Du
bourgh voiced in fitting phrase the thanks of
his country to the hero who had routed the
forces of Pakenham. And in later days they
stood with Shields in the fierce conflict of
Churubusco. and two Jesuit priests as chap
lains accompanied the Catholic soldiers in the
army of General Taylor as they went to plant
the stars and stripes above the halls of the
Montezumas. '
In the later days of the Republic, when the
grandest governmental fabric of the world's
history seemed to be trembling in the balance,
we know. that they went forth in companies, in
regiments and brigades, by thousands upon
thousands, to battle for the integrity of our
Republic and the conservation and develop
ment of our liberties.
CATHOLICS WANT NO UNION* OF CHURCH AND
STATE UPON AMERICAN SOIL.
Have Catholics ever advocated the union of
the church and state on American soil? Have
they everÂ» under any provocations, engaged in
a crusade of religious repression or intoler
ance? The student of history can answer these
Questions without any trouble in favor of the
Catholics. ,
The first settlers in the colony of Virginia
were Englishmen, loyal subjects to their king
and church, and the grant to Sir Walter Raleigh
contained" an express proviso that the laws
"should not be against the true Christian faith
now professed in the Church of England," and
as soon as the state of the colony admitted, it
was divided into parishes in each of which
was established a minister of the Anglican
church, endowed with a fixed salary in tobacco,
a glebe house and land with the other neces
sary appendages.
In H>.3 the colonial Legislature of Virginia
decreed that no minister should preach or
teach publicly or privately, except in con
foimity with the constitutions of the Church
of England. Puritans were banished from the
soil of the colony and civil enactments were
made against the Quakers.
New Amsterdam, afterward New York, was
settled by traders from Holland. There the
Reformed religion as set forth in the doctrine
and discipline of the Synod of Dort was main
tained by the emigrants, the colonial clergy
being approved and commissioned by the
Classis of Amsterdam.
And when this Dutch colony passed into the
hands Of the Duke of York, a Catholic Gov
ernor, Colonel Thomas Dongan, convoked the
Assembly, and the first act passed by that body
on the 30th of October, 1683, was a charter of
liberties declaring that
"No person or persons who profess faith in
God by Jesus Christ shall at any time be in any
way molested, punished, disquieted or called la
question for any difference of opinion or matter
of religious concernment.
But these liberal laws making all equal and
harmonizing with the avowed doctrines of
Protestantism did not survive i the Catholic
rule which have promulgated them.
And how was it in Maryland, the colony es
tablished by the Catholic Lord Baltimore ? â¢
â â¢â¢-â  in answer, I will use the words of Bancroft,
the American historian. He says: "The apolo
gist of Lord Baltimore could assert that his
government, in conformity with his strict and
repeated injunctions, had never given dis
turbance to any person in Maryland for matter
of religion ; that the colonists enjoyed freedom
of conscience not less than freedom of i person
and estate, as amply as ever any people in any
place in the world. The disfranchised friends
of prelacy from : Massachusetts and the Puri
tan from Virginia were welcomed to equal lib
erty of conscience and political rights in : the
Roman Catholic province of Maryland."
Such ? liberty continued to be .' the rule in
Maryland until the : Protestants got the upper
hand and persecuted the tolerant Catholics.
And ; we find that this power' of regulating
religious I matters has been wisely handled by
the ramers of * the constitution of , every
American State. ' 'i_ iffll* H ,PBT>l*nffiliT'" | |i l ''?il(_l 1Â» j l '
_.* Judge Thomas M. Cooiey, author of the work
on "Constitutional Limitations," â¢ thus speaks
on the subject of religious liberty: ' **- --â -
,-' A careful examination of . the American
constitutions will disclose the fact that nothing
is more fully set forth: or more plainly ex
pressed than the determination of their
authors to preserve and perpetuate religious
liberty and to guard against the- slightest
approach toward the establishment of an in
equality in the civil and , political rights of
citizens, which shall have for its, basis only
their differences of religious belief. 7: The
American people came to the work of framing
their fundamental laws after centuries of re
ligious oppression and persecution, sometimes
by. one party or sect and sometimes by an
other, had taught them the utter futility of ail
attempts to propagate religious opinions
by the rewards, penalties or terrors of . human
laws. They could not fail to perceive, also,
that a union of church and state, like that
which existed in England, if not. wholly im
practicable in America, was certainly opposed
to the spirit of our institutions, and that any
domineering of one sect over another was
repressing to the energies .. of the peo
ple and must necessarily tend .to "â¢ discon
tent and disorder. Whatever, therefore, may
have been their individual sentiments upon
religious questions, or upon the propriety of
the state assuming supervision and control of
religious affairs under other, circumstances,
the general, voice has been that persons of
every religious persuasion should be made
equal before the law, and that questions of
religious belief and religious worship should
be questions between each individual man and
his maker. Of these questions human tribun
als, so long the public order is not disturbed,
are not to take cognizance, except as the in
dividual, by his voluntary action in associating
himself with a religious organization, may have
conferred upon such organization a jurisdic
tion over him in ecclesiastical matters. These
constitutions, therefore, have not established
religious toleration merely, but religious equal
ity, in that particular being far in advance,
not only of the mother country, but also of
much of the colonial legislation, which, though
more liberal than that of other civilized coun
tries, nevertheless exhibited features of dis
crimination based upon religious beliefs or
professions."
At times, during the excitement of political
campaigns, interested persons, working for the
spoils of office rather than the good of the
country, have sought to combine politics and
religion to the serious detriment of both.
This charge cannot justly be made against
the Catholics. Their priests have hot partici
pated in political conventions. They have not
prostituted their pulpits or their sacred offices
to partisan political purposes.
When the maddened mobs of leading cities
in 1834 and again in 1854 and 1855, often
goaded to frenzy by unjust denunciations of
political bigots and tricksters and have set firo
to Catholic churches and convents, the out
raged Catholics have not invoked the lex
talionis nor reciprocated in kind. No .ingle
church of any denomination has been reduced
lo ashes by a "torch in the hand of an American
Catholic. -yzyy- - : yy T-'A/pa-' âa
religion ESSENTIAL to a republic
There have been times and places when it
was thought that revealed religion was in
imical to a republic. Such was claimed when
God was dethroned and reason defied by the
Parisian mob amid a saturnalia of crime.
Such, however, is not the doctrine of sober
thought nor the doctrine that was announced
by Washington in his farewell address to the
people of the United States.
He said: "Of all the dispositions and habits
which lead to political prosperity religion and
morality are Indispensable supports. In vain
would that man claim, the tribute of patriot
ism who should labor to subvert these great
pillars of human happiness, these firmest
props of the duties of men and citizens.
: Morality is indeed essential as the main
spring of popular government."
Of what value is a republican form of gov
ernment if the highest function of popular
sovereignty, the act of suffrage, represents
merely the result of a combination of corrup
tion and power? Of what value that legis
lators are selected by popular vote if they re
spect not the moral obligation of loyalty to
their constituents and to the common weal?
Of what value that the people mime the mag
istrates who declare the law if cowardice or
corruption drag their crime in the dust?
Of what value is liberty of speech if it be
merely the implement by which the incendiary
or the assassin stirs up deeds of violence and
bloodshed? Of *hat value is liberty of the
press if it be used merely to disseminate dis
content and outbreak among those whose
honest labor might otherwise make them con
tented and happy?
Of what value is liberty at all, when, in the
absence of moral restraint, it degenerates into
the wild debauch of the anarchist, when it re
gards not the sacrednessof property or person?
If moral restraint be lacking, what power in
our free Government, without a large stand
ing army, can prevent the maddened millions
01 toilers from appropriating to their own pur
poses the repositories of wealth? What can
restrain the power of tbe populace but the
moral force which permeates its being under
the influence of religion?
As Americans, we feel that in keeping alive
a religious sentiment we are guilty of no trea
son to the state; on the contrary, we are doing
a service to the state. â  If we conform our con
duct to the moral precepts of our creed, we
shall be better citizens of the Republic.
Let us live in kindly fellowship with our
neighbors. Let us help to develop the higher
and better standard of manhood whose abid
ing place is to be in this vast Western world of
ours.
Let us realize that Americans still yearn for
libertyâ the largest liberty and the fullest jus
tice. Let us be worthy co-laborers with the
congregated millions of new races of men who
witn hearts all aglow with the sacred flame of
freedom, "witn minds broadened by the con
templation of the illimitable grandeur of the
country under our control, souls filled with
the noble resolve to make America in very
deed and truth the home of liberty, the abode
of - justice, the domain of law, the world's
great sanctuary of inalienable human rights."
SEASON OF GRAND OPERA
The Tavary Company to Open at
Â . the Baldwin Next Fri
day Week.
Sale of Seats the Largest in the His
tory of Musical Events in
This City. '?
The engagement of the Tavary Opera
Company which begins at the Baldwin
Theater February 3 promises to be a bril
liant success in more ways than one. The
sale of seats began yesterday morning at 9
o'clock, though long before that time 200
or more people were impatiently waiting
in front of the Baldwin for the doors to
open. /.',
It was a fashionable set of people, too,
found scrambling for the first choice,
and they kept it up pretty much all day.
The sale of seats covers the first two weeks
of the engagement, and Business Manager
Morganstein says it is the largest ever
held in the history of musical events in
this City. The aay's sales amounted to a
little over $6500.
Last season the Tavary Company came
here practically unknown, but before
three performances had been given there
was just such a rush as was witnessed yes
terday. Wagner "nights" seemed to be
most in demand by the music-loving
and fashionable throng, though every
performance was in substantial demand.
The first night promises to be not only
all that could be looked for in the musi
cal line, but a brilliant social event as
well. A theater party .of forty music
lovers of the ultra-fashionable set will be
one of the events of the evening. Press
Representative Ralph Pincns says one of
the features of the Tavary season will be
the Wednesday * matinees at popular
prices. The repertoire for the first and
second weeks is as follows:
First Monday, "Aida" : Tuesday, "Car
men"; Wednesday matinee (at popular prices),
"Bohemian Girl"; Wednesday night, "Hugue
nots"; Thursday, ."Mignon": Friday, "Caval
leria Rusticana" and "I Pagliacei" ;> Saturday,
matinee, "Martha"; Saturday night, "Lohen
grin." - *â .*â , -.-â  â â '.--. -*
Second, weekâ Monday, "Lucia" and "Caval
leriaÃusticana"; Tuesday, "Mignon" ; Wednes
day matinee (at popular prices), "Martha";
Wednesday night, "Aida"; Thursday, "Car
men"; Friday, "Faust"; ' Saturday matinee,
"Trovatore" ; Saturday night, "Tannhauser."
No Chance to Brag in Heaven.
.... "Mr. Moody . has - a popular and very
telling way of ; 'hitting' .the errors so rife
in the theological thinking, of many per
sons to-day. ; Speaking, of salvation by
grace he has said : 'It is well that a man
can't . save ' himself; for if a man could
work his own waj into heaven you would
never hear the last - of it. Why, -down
here in* the world if a man happens to get
a little ahead of his fellows and sciapes a
few thousand dollars together, you'll hear
him bragging about his being a self-made
man and telling how he.began as a poor
boy and worked his way up in the world.
I've heard so much of i this sort of thing
that I'm sick and. tired of the whole busi
ness; and I'm glad: we shan't have men
bragging through all : eternity how 7 they
worked their way into heaven.' "âThe

CIVIC FEDERATION
TO AID THE MAYOR
Sutro Says That Help Will
Be Needed at the
Elections.
IS ONLY A FIGURE HEAD.
An Investigation Regarding the
Attorney of the Board
". of Health.
MORTON STREET UNDER FIRE.
A Strong Protest Filed Against the
Licensing of the Pool-Selling
Dens.
The Civic Federation discussed many
important matters at its meeting last even
ing, chief among them being the following
letter from Mayor Sutro, who says that
under present conditions he is but a figure
head, without powers except of protest:
Civic Federation, Mills Building, Gentle
men: You are aware that the Supreme Court,
by declaring ; the law unconstitutional, has
nullified the appointment of Messrs. Denman,
Foster, Wellin and Castle as Election Commis
sioners and thereby destroyed the non-partisan
management of our elections and turned them
back to the old methods. 'â  /yy-/'//'
The former law, now revived, imposes upon
the Mayor, Auditor, City and County Attorney,
Tax Collector and Surveyor the duty of con
ducting an election in this City.
So far as personally concerned, all my spare
time will be given to the Election Commission.
But it is apparent that it will be impossible for
me to donate enough time to fully protect the
interests of our good people in the important
election now coming.
Therefore, permit me to suggest to your body,
distinguished for its good citizenship, liberality
and strength in numbers, to appoint a com
mittee charging it with the special duty of aid
ing the commission in the performance of its
duties, and seeing. that our coming elections
shall be honestly conducted, and, therefore, a
true record of the feelings of the voters. .
In my own opinion your body can perform
no better service in the cause of .good govern
ment than this. That we have reached a crisis
in our City administration is clearly manifest.
Under present conditions the Mayor is merely
a figurehead without power, except of pro
test. Either one of two things should be done.
Either good, honest, fearless officials should
be elected to execute our present contradict
ory and very imperfect laws, or we should
have a code of new laws under which the
Mayor would have the power to remedy
notorious wrong. Believe me, gentlemen,
that I am most anxious to co-operate with your
organization toward better government, and
will greatly appreciate any and all efforts that
you may make to assist me in my duties.
Adolph Sutro.
The sugeestion struck the meeting fa
vorably, and a committee consisting of
Stewart Menzies, Richard Lambert and
Thomas Magee was appointed to draft a
resolution on the subject, confer with the
Mayor and report at the next meeting.
The committee discussed the ordinance
recently offered in the Board of Super
visors licensing pool-selling, and passed
the following resolution against the meas
ure:y j: ;7Kz;A-/;
I Resolved, That the Civic Federation protests
against the ordinance to license pool-selling in
the City and County of San Francisco ; thai
we call on all good citizens to utter their pro
test against this proposed infamy, and spe
cially we request the religious organizations of
the City to speak publicly against it.
A resolution was also passed commend
ing the Police Department for its efforts in
attempting to close the Morton-street
dens. .- /py.ypTPA i .
The committee on legal action was in
structed to inquire whether it is true", as
has been intimated by the Attorney-
General, that there is no such office as
attorney, for the Board of Health, and if
said opinion be. correct to commence quo
warranto proceedings in the name of the
president of the association to discontinue
the salary now paid the office.
The committee was also instructed to ex
amine minutely into the assessment of
property to determine authentically to
what extent favoritism or partiality is
shown. :â¢ .'* .*â '.- . . 4 AAAyr/Tp
Stewart Menzies suggested that it would
be well for the Civic Federation to â¢ act in
concert with the non-partisan party
during the coming election and as a mem
ber of that party asked the meeting to
indorse his suggestion.
He also suggested that the Good Govern
ment Club and other reform organizations
should be asked to aid the non-partisan
movement. This matter will be further
discussed at the next meeting.
The following letter from the National
Municipal League was received and placed
on file:* ' ./ ' '
Dear Sir: Permit me to request your society,
or its governing body, to consider the advisa
bility of affiliation with the National Municipal
League. This measure would give us the bene
fit of your counsel in our work and the recom
mendation to public confidence implied in
your indorsement of our aims and methods ; it
would not involve any pecuniary responsibil
ity on your part or in any wise control or ham
per you in , the advancement of the ends of
your organization, according to whatever
policy you deem best suited to attain them. - ;
I Inclose a copy of the constitution and by
laws of the league and a paper briefly setting
forth the reasons for its formation; and, in the
hope of being favored with â as prompt a reply
as circumstances and your convenience may
permit, I remain, yours very respectfully and
truly, â  : * Clinton ers woodruff,
Secretary National Municipal League. â 
THE CONCRETE WAS POOR
Board of Education Is Investi
â¢ gating the Bulging -
7 -School Wall.
The Contractors Will Not â¢ Get Their
Money for the Job Until It Is â _;
Well Done.
The bulging sustaining wall at the North
Cosmopolitan school, which has become so
insecure as to threaten to fall and jeopard
ize the lives of the pupils of the institu
tion, was the subject ; of . considerable dis
cussion at the* meeting of the -Buildings
and Grounds Committee of the Board of
Education yesterday.
i The representatives of 'â¢ M. Brennan &
Son, the contractors, 7 were present, and
were asked 7 many pointed questions 7 re
garding . the construction of 7 the will,
whether it was put up according to speci
fications and whether the \ materials * used
were those called for by the plans. T:
A. The contractors â  frankly â  'admitted f that
the wall is insecure.-and that it might fall
if the earth back of it should exert much
more pressure, 1 out denied y. that they are
responsible for the condition of the struct
ure. They claimed that the wall was con
structed according to the plans; and that
the architect that drew them is the one to
whom tbe board should look for redress.
They admitted, however, that ; the -work
and expense of i rebuilding ;* the .wall .de
volves upon them, and agreed to do the
job. , * â¢; ;_."' . ' -7* â¢ â¢" â  , ',;
.The committee was far from being satis
fied with the state of affairs,' however, and
spent some time in examining samples of
concrete that had been taken from the
wall. These were considered by some to
show that . the materials used were of a
very inferior quality. The opinion' was
expressed that had ; the concrete been of
â¢good quality and the earth back of the
wall properly tamped the trouble would
not have occurred. â¢
V No action was taken in the matter, how
ever, and it was decided to hold another
meeting this _ afternoon and formulate
some kind of a report to the board, which
meets to-night, it is probable that the
architect will be called upon to explain
about the plans and that new plans will
be drawn before the wall is rebuilt.
Secretary Beanston. of the board said
yesterday that the members knew that
the wall was not all right, and that the
contractors' pay had been withheld on that
account.
* ; "The board will lose .nothing," he said,
'because the money that was to have been
paid 13 still in our hands. If the contractor
decides that he is not going to rebuild the
wall, all well and good; the board will go
ahead and do it itself, using the funds
originally intended for the job.
"If he does rebuild it he will be paid all
right after the board is convinced that the
work is well done and the wall shows that
it will be permanent. The board is glad
that the wall bulged before the money was
paid,' that is, if it was going to bulge at all,
as otherwise it would have been difficult
to recover from the contractor."
Jere Eynch's Borrow.
I It was in July, 1895, that Jeremiah Lynch,
well known to local fame, found himself in
need of money, and, according to a complaint
filed in the County Clerk's office yesterday, he
employed S. D. Hovey to get it for him. Hovey
got it evidently and now he is suing Lynch
for lÂ£4oo, which he claims is a just commission
for the service he performed ior the Senator's
pocket-book. . The amount of the loan so suc
cessfully negotiated is not mentioned.
Into New Quarters.
,The Butchers' Board of Trade has completed
the fitting up of headquarters in the Pheian
building, where it will now occupy a suite of
rooms. The officers will enter their commo
dious quarters to-day. Heretofore the organi
zation has had no offices. Martin Gilbert, the
assistant secretary, will be in charge.
DR. BROWN'S INTEGRITY.
Officers and Trustees Express
Confidence in Their Pas
, tor.
Reports of the Board of Inquiry
and Trustees to Be Submitted
This Evening.
The officers of his church gave expres
sion to a tentative belief in Dr. Brown's
integrity last evening. "We will not
credit vague and damaging insinuations
until they are proven before a competent
tribunal,'' they said. A competent tribu
nal they construe to be either an eccle
siastical or legal body in which is vested
the power to judicially establish the inno
cence or guilt of the much-accused pastor.
The officers and trustees met last even
ing pursuant to a call for a "general con
sultation." This call was issued several
days ago, its immediate purpose being to
consider the finances of the church, which.
during its trouble, have been in anything
but a satisfactory state. Wealthy mem
bers of the board of trustees have
refused to make up the deficit
caused by the numerous withdrawals of
subscriptions since the Brown-Davidson
case has been a matter of public comment.
These pillars of the church had more than
once made good such deficits, common
enough during the dissensions that have
agitated the First Congregational Church
since the opening of the Herron contro
versy. But the wellspriug of generosity
has been checked of late, and it be
came necessary to discuss the situ
ation. No matter what the fate
of the pastor whose latter days of
ministry were so turbulent, it was essen
tial that the church avoid shipwreck if its
pilot did go down. There were rumors
that the choir's salary was in arrears and
that tnere were other embarrassing debts.
The primary object of the meeting,
therefore, was to consider the financial sit
uation. John F. Merrill read a statement
showing that the cnurch was in arrears
$1200. The discussion of this phase of the
difficulties of the storm-tossed church was
indefinitely . postponed for there was
an interruption in the form of
a visit from Dr. Brown. It was a brief vet
effective visit. When Dr. Brown came
from the study and wended his way toward
Geary street it was with a triumphant air.
For the present in the eyes of a few at
least he was vindicated. '
' It was not long before the officers fol
lowed their leader and the study or office,
which had been the scene of so amicable
an arrangement, was in darkness. The
session," like all that preceded it, was of
the star-chamber order. The first of the
trustees who made his exit referred the
waiting reporters to the secretary.
Deacon J. Howard Barnard to the scribe
of the occasion surrendered the following:
At the meeting of the officers of the claurch
and the trustees of the First Congregational
Society held January 28, 1896, the -followim
preamble and resolution were unanimously
adopted: .
Whereas, Certain intimations of immoral
conduct have been made against C. O. Brown,
i D.D., by irresponsible persons and without
any proof as to their credibility; now be it
Resolved, That this body expresses full and
entire confidence in Rev. C. O. Brown's integ
rity and good moral character, and will not
credit vague and damaging insinuations until
they are proved before a competent triDuual.
But few were absent, hence the resolu
tions may be regarded as an expression of
the sentiment of those in authority.
There were present at the meeting
Trustees Henry L. Dodge, W. F. Whittier
John F. Merrill, W. J. Dalton, Edward
Coleman, G. A. Frank, and Deacons D
Gilbert Dexter, J. .7. Vasconcellos, T. H.
Hatch, A. J. Dewing, J. H. Barnard,
George A.; Westgage and W. Christiansen.
No action was taken concerning Dr.
Brown officiating as pastor during the in
terim between this â¢â¢suspension of judg
ment" and the trial of Mrs. Davidson.
Tne matter may. come up for discussion
this evening at prayer-meeting, when the
report of the committee on inquiry and
that of the officers and trustees will be
submitted.

NEW YORK HARKLTS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Jan. 28.â Stocks were less
active to-day, the sales amounting to 193,200
shares. The course of prices was irregular, but at
the end of the day the leading issues as a rule
were from Vi to 3VÂ« per cent higher than at the
close yesterday. Ths irregularity was due to
profit-irking and selling by professional operators
who were disposed to work for a reaction. London
â was a seller of St. Paul and Louisville and Nash
ville, but foreign houses were given up as buy,
of Reading. When it was demonstrated that but
little long stock could be forced out, the profes
sional traders once more took the bull side of the
market, and in the late trading prices moved up
steadily.
At this time the news and developments were of
an encouraging character. Posted rates Of sterling
exchange were reduced i/ 2 , the Kansas Pacific
bondholders Indorsed the Union Pacific reor
ganization plan and rumor bad it that the sub-corn
mitteee of presidents recently appointed to settle
the question of percentages in the matter of
anthracite coal production had reached a settle
ment. This with easy money aud more liberal
offerings of funds by foreign houses all contributed
to a more confident condition to the future of stock
prices.
Reading was helped by its good showing of earn
ings for December and buying by brokers said to
be identified with Morgan interests. The real
feature of the late trading was sugar, which ad
vanced to 1061 Yes day's short sellers on
the report that the Reichstag would pass a bill in
creasing the bounty on beet, sugar have been
eager buyers, the rumors having failed to mate
rialize. Speculation closed strong. Net changes
show gains of Vi@V2 Per cent on the day. Con
solidated Gas, however, gained 3 per cent.
Bonds were strong. Sales were 951,000.

'. CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Jan. 28.â An effort to boom
wheat prices on the ; world's . shipments being
1,000,000 bushels less than estimated was made
at the opening this morning, but it speedily proved
a failure. There were too many holders willing to
sell, the first half hour's trading . resulting in half a
cent decline from the opening quotations, further
losses taking place later. Holders of puts and a
few scalpers who sold early bought enough later to
rally the market, Receipts In the Northwest were
good, amounting to 406 cars against 342 last Tues
day aud 173 a year ago. Chicago received 125
cars, and shipped out 116,746 bushels, i Liverpool
â  cables were quiet and easy at %d decline. Brad
street's report of a decrease of but 32,000 bushels
in the world's available supply was the signal for
general selling, the lowest quotations of the session
being established. Export clearances were fair at
340,90** bushels. Closing Continental cables were
unchanged to lower. May wheat opened at 646/ c,
sold between 64" (564**4c and 63%@653/ B e, clos
ing at 63% c, %<' under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts tor to-morrow 50 cars.
CORNâ Weakened and declined at the opening.
The loss of strength in wheat and large receipts,
416 cars, were potent factors. Inspections from
ore were large, amounting to 326,950 bushels.
Liverpool cables quoted %d decline at that place.
Bradstreet's reported an increase in available sup
plies of 3,269,000 bushels, which added to the
weakness when announced. May corn opened at
30% c. declined to 29J4C closing at 2934@29%c,
V4c under yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 250 cars.
OATSâ Opened steady, but very shortly took the
direction of everything else. Receipts were 338
cars. There were no withdrawals from store.
Bradstreet's reported a decrease in stocks of 24,000
bushels. May oats closed %Â® s / 8 c lower than yes
terday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 160
cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash, 93@93>i4c: May,
96*40. ' Receipts 32 cars.
PRO VISIONSâ The hog market was weak des
pite light receipts this morning, and that condi
tion was communicated to product. The effector
a declining wheat market was also adverse. The
trade was not broad, and fluctuations were rather
slow. May pork closed 12% c lower; May lard 10c
lower, and May ribs 7i.2(_*loc lower.

A Youth Who Eloped With a Married
Woman Is Quickly Caught and
Lodged in Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
907 Broadway, Jan. 28. J
Led by a little child to the room occu
pied by her recreant husband, Mrs. Bianchi
shot and tried to kill John Bianchi this
morning. The bullet made a serious
wound in the man's back. The woman
expressed some regret at the Receiving
Hospital and they went home together.
John Bianchi is a barber doing business
at the Newland House. He married his
present wife about six months ago and all
went well till about a month ago. Then
Bianchi stayed away from his home for a
couple of days at a time, and Mrs. Bianchi
obtained proof that her husband was not
as faithful as morals and law demanded.
She made several attempts to catch him in
his new quarters, but was not able to locate
him. This she did this morning with the
aid of a stepdaughter. Mrs. Bianchi's sis
ter was Bianchi'9 first wife, and it was the
child of her dead sister that was the means
this morning of rinding her husband.
As soon as the little child had shown
her stepmother where her father was Mrs.
Bianchi entered without ceremony and
lired point blank at her husband. The
bullet struck his left shoulder-blade and
glanced toward the right blade.
Bianchi at once grappled with his wife
and wrenched the pistol from her before
she had time to fire a second time. The
woman then half-swooned and was very
anxious to get her husband to the hospi
tal that his life, if possible, might be saved.
The doctors extracted the bullet, and in a
few weeks it is expected that Bianchi will
be no worse for his narrow escape.
At the hospital Mrs. Bianchi said : "Why
do you leave your lawful wife and run oft
with another woman? I meant to kill you
and then kill myself. That is what I
ought to have done. You have supported
me only poorly, and instead of saving our
money you have spent it for some other.
woman.'
Bianchi attempted to deny that there \
was another woman in tie "case, but his
wife at once declared that there were
garments in the room that were not usu- I
ally worn by men. Before they left, their \
differences weie patched up, and there !
will be no arrests made.
AN ELOPEMENT SPOILED.
A Youth Robs a Till and Flees With
Another Man's Wife.
OAKLAND. Cal., Jan. 28.-William
Kelleher and Mrs. Van Sandt were ar
rested at Ingieside early this morning and
brought to Oakland later. Yesterday aft
ernoon Herman Kosta, a grocer, reported
to the police that his clerk, William Kel
leher, had gone, and so had the contents
of his cashbox, about $85. A little later
it was reported that .Mrs. Van Sandt, wife
of a lumber-yard employe, was also miss- i
in?.
Late last night a report was received by ]
the police that the couple hart been seen!
in San Francisco going toward the Ingle- ;
bide racetrack. Officer Lamping was de- ;
tailed to investigate, and he was accom- i
panted by Mr. Van Sandt. About 1 o'clock
this morning the guilty pair were located
at Jackson's resort, near the course. Tne
officer broke in the door, but before he
could get the handcuffs on Kelleher the
youth, who is not yet 18 years old, and
Van Sandt had become mixed. Lamping
separated them and took his prisoners to
the San Francisco prison for the night.
This morning they were brought to Oak
' land, and complaints have been riled
charzing both with grand larceny.
When arrested they both protested their
innocence, and a search of Kelleher only
produced a quarter. When the woman
was searched $72 was found secreted in
her stocking, and in her pocket was
Kosta's revolver. They are both very re
pentant.

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 27. â Auditor
Snow has received a note from H. Wein-
Etock of Sacramento, secretary of the River
.and Harbor Improvement Association,
asking him to draw a warrant for the $250
appropriated by the Council to help pay
the expenses of Dr. McLean of Alameda

The Auditor has declined to draw the
Warrant and has forwarded the following
reply to Secretary Weinstock:
I am in receipt of your communication of the

OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â The trial of
Colonel A. Wettstein against the Southern
Tacific Company for $25,000 damages

day. Attorney A. A. Moore, for the com

A SAKE EXPLODED AT LAST.
A Neat but Very Cnprolitable Job in
Kast Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â The two lads
Who were so neatly caught the other night
with a new set of safe-cracking tools in
their possession are not the people who
have been cracking a safe about every other
night for a couple of weeks past. Last
night the safe of C. M.. Jenkins & Co., at
East Twelfth street, was blown open and
the door was completely separated from
its hinges. An entrance* was gained by a
skeleton key, as the door of the office was
not injured. The detectives are of the
! opinion that nitro-glycerine must have
! been used by the burglars. Judging by
I th. effect the explosion must have been
very heavy. Several articles of furniture
were broken and the office windows were
smashed. The- handle of the safe was
blown clear through a window of the
office into the main "building. The explo
sion, however, did not arouse any one in
the neighborhood. Officers Jacobus and
Nedderman, who are on duty in that sec
tion, did not hear it. â¢* .7 : .â¢ _T
The burglar did not obtain any money
at ail, for the firm kept nothing in the safe
i but books and private papers. The mill
! where the explosion occurred is situated
! in the Commerce-street hollow, and prob
i ably on that account the explosion was not
! heard. Although half a dozen safes have
| been bored into daring the past two weeks,
| this is the first case "in which a fuse was
I used.
Mayrisch Is Free.
OAKLAND, Cai,., Jan. 23.â Ernest May
risch Jr. was acquitted by a jury to-day of
the charge of embezzlement brought
I against him by the late Grand Jury. To
| day J. Leo Parkes, a former deputy in the
! office, testified to the system employed
j and the possibility of error.
Deputy District Attorney Church re
| viewed the evidence and claimed that the
I facts showed that the shortage had oc
j curred in the accounts of which Mayrisch
i was in charge, and he had admitted that
,he was responsible for it. He asked for a
j verdict of guilty.
Attorney W. W. Foote argued for the
! defendant. He said there was no proof of
criminal intent. The evidence showed
that there was liability to error and that
Mayrisch's conduct had been that of an
honest man. He referred to the good
reputation of the young man and asked
â  the jury to restore him to his wife and
child and his parents cleared from the
stain which it was sought to fasten upon
him by a conviction of this crime. The
father, mother, wife and little son of the
defendant were in the courtroom and the
wife and mother were moved to tears by
Mr. Foote's plea.
Judge Frick occupied about an hour in
charging the jury. After being out about
fifteen minutes a verdict of "not guilty"
wae returned.
The Tables Turned.
OAKLAND, Cal., Jan. 28.â For several

AHE NOW ACTIVELY AT WORK.
The Development of tiie Corral Hollow
Mines Is Progressing Very
Rapidly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Jan. 28. j
Since the active work of developing the
Corral Hollow coal mines has been going
on Livermore has become the central point
of interest in the interior of the county.
To aid in bringing into publicity the many
resomces of the fertile valley and to help
Mrs. Emma B. Coffman, Vice-President, and Mrs. -Mac I. Beck, President of the
Ladies' League of Progress of Livermore Valley.
[Reproduced from photographs taken by the Livermore Herald.]
the progress of the town the ladies have
just organized the Ladies' League of Pro
gress.
The league was formally started a few
days ago, and is already outlining work of
a practical nature. The society elected
Mrs. Mac I. Beck president. She is a
native of Livermore Valley, a graduate of
ohe of the best known Pacific Coast sem
inaries and a lady of spirit and culture.
Mrs. Coffman, the vice-president, a lady
of culture and grace of manner, fittingly
represents the valley women, whose co
operation with the public-spirited women
of the town is the scheme of the league.
Mr?. Bistorious is secretary of the
league. She is a business woman, and
from that standpoint, as well as from her
interest in the social and moral growth of
the community, she is earnestly inter
ested in the new society. Mrs. Gordon,
the treasurer, was from" the first one of
the most active promoters of the new so
ciety. The first work that the ladies have
undertaken is the organization of a public
library and free reading-room. The va
rious branches of home industry will be
taken up by the Ladies' Leacue arid every
thing possible will be done to further the
interests of the valley.
During the past few weeks much work
has been done at the Corral Hollow mines,
and the outlook is more favorable the
farther the work proceeds. The veins
bave been traced and explored for over
sis miies and many tunnels and shafts
have been sunk. A large shaft is now
being sunk at the rate of live feet a day.
It will be 300 feet deep and 11 by 22 feet
square. It is estimated that there is coal
enough in the mines to supply the needs
of the State for the next fifty years.
In order to build the projected road from
Oakland to the Corral Hollow mines a long

well and the engineers are not at all dis
mayed at this. The work done on the
mine has thoronchly demonstrated tie
formation through which it will pass, so
that they arc in a position to prove that a
double-track tunnel can be built and tim
bered for $20 per foot and that it can be
built at the rate of twenty-five to thirty
feet per day. working from. 'both ends, so
that it could be completed in eight or nine
months. No expense is being spared on the
road now in course of construction. The
steel drawbridge across the San Joaquin
will be one of the best in the State. All
other parts of the road are being equally
solidly built, and in view of the fact that
a much inferior road would answer the
purpose of a coal-carrier the belief that it
will be pushed through to San Francisco
seems to be fully warranted.
WILL BE A NEW REGISTER.
Clerk Jordan' Says Voter la In Fear
of Being Disfranchised.
Oakland Office Pax Francisco Call
T 908 Broadway, Jan. 28. f
No one will be disfranchised because the
county cannot legally make an appropria
tion to get out a new . great register. All
the published opinions of politicians and
others cut no ; figure - with County Clerk
Jordan. The hitter said:
; There will .he danger of many losing the
right to vote through the cancellation of the
great register. As I am the one most deeply
interested in. this matter, of registration,/!
will say, and I want it distinctly understood
by all taking any interest in the matter what
ever, that I will get out the new great register
without a dollar's expense to this county, and
every man who is entitled to vote will be reg
istered. As far as cancellation of the old great
register is concerned, it was upon my repre
sentation and at my desire that the Board of
Supervisors canceled it, and I will cheerfully
assume all responsibility in that connection.
As every one knows who . has had occasion to
examine the present great register, it is a
shame and disgrace to the county. There are
several thousand names on that register that
do not belong there, and to attempt to purge
the old great register with the information
that I have at hand would be a. most unsatis â¢
factory task, and in the end would only result
in criticism and dissatisfaction.
I have nearly six months in which to regis
ter the voters of this county, some 22,000 in
number, and I have no fear but that, I will be
able to put every man on the register. I am
now taking time by the forelock, and am pre
paring the affidavit of every voter whose name
appears on the last great register and also in ;
the directory of Oakland, Alameda and Berke
ley. In addition to that, I am sending to
prominent people throughout the county the
precinct register of country districts, and they
arc taking the names of those who are bona
fide residents and voters. When these marked
registers are returned to me affidavits will be
prepared for them also.
On the Kith day of February at least 15,000
affidavits will be mailed throughout the
county, together with these affidavits will go
instructions to the voter as to the course to
take in order to get his name on the register.
In the country, prominent, intelligent and re
liable gentlemen have, as much for the accom
modation of the people in 'their respective lo
calities as to help me, kindly consented toad
minister the oath necessary to each voter
applying for registration and to have the
affidavit when perfected forwarded to this
office. I expect to have in nearly every pre
cinct in this county from two to ten responsible
representative citizens who will assist in the
matter of registration. No one need have any
uneasiness whatever in regard to this registra
tion waiter. ;.*..--*
THE WOMAN`S FEDERATION
Dr. Weil Takes Exception to
the Statements .of Its
v Committee.
He Points Out Their ' Ignorance in
Speaking of Keeping the In
struments in Cases.
The report of Mrs. J. B. Bruner, pre
sented to the Woman's Federation at its
meeting on Monday night, giving an ac
count of a visit to the Receiving Hospital,
afforded more amusement than annoyance
to Dr. Weil, the head surgeon, and his as
sistants.
The statements in the report were al
most entirely at variance with the state
ments made by Mrs. Fa w, one of the com
mittee, at the time of the visit.
"The statement that the hospital was in
charge of boys." said Dr. Weil yesterday,
"is not in accordance with the fact*?. It is
never in charge of boys. That day Dr.
Fitzgibbon was absent by permission at
the funeral of a relative, but Dr. Helms,
the interne appointed by the Board of
Health, was in charge. In the Afternoon
Dr. Helms received a telegram that his
mother was seriously ill, and he left in
time to catch a train. I toid the steward
to call me by telephone if any cases came
in, and I attended to two cases/till Dr.
Thompson and Dr. Stice reported on duty
at their usual hour.
! "It is all nonsense for them to talk about
! keeping the instruments in small cases
j and it shows their ignorance. This is an
; emergency hospital and the instruments
: must be kept where they can be reached
at any moment. It would be no ? advan
i tage in regard to rust to keep the instrâ
--| ments in small cases, and it is much easier
, to see rust on them in the wav they are
I kept here than if they were kept in small
I cases.
.''l admit that our instruments are poor
i and I have drawn the attention of the
j Board of Health to the need of better
ones, and until we get them we have to do
the best we can.
"They say there was no woman about
the place when,' as. a matter of fact, .Mrs.
Keane, the matron, was with them for
some hours and gave them all the infor
mation they, asked. I cannot understand
why, they could have.made such erroneous
statements."

WRITES TO THE STUDENTS
Regent Reinstein Lays His
Plans Before the Berkeley
Collegians.
EXPRESSES FAITH IN THEM.
Important Meeting of the Town Board.
To Determine Who Are Cham
pions News Notes.
' BERKELEY, Cai-., Jan. â  28.â An open
letter to Berkeley students from Regent J.
B. Reinstein , in which he gives his plans for
carrying out the proposed new improve
ments to the campus, was published in
this morning's issue of the university
daily. The communication was of con
siderable length, and pointed out in detail
the many improvements needed on the
grounds and those which are possible to be
made by the "student labor." " The let
ter was intended to furnish the students
with a complete and succinct outline of
just what they will be expected to do when
they don the blue jeans and line up as a
pick-and-shovel brigade.
There has been much anxiety on the part
of the students to Know at what date the
work will be commenced and how they
will be organized to carry it on.
In his letter the regent said :
Time when work will begin depends on the
rapidity with which Professor Hilgard can
safely remove the valuable plants and growths
on the lines of the new entrance after this line
is surveyed and staked out. This should not
take longer than ten days from this date.
The proposed programme of-student labor is to
use the military organizationâ simply to have
students fall in in their respective companies
under the leadership of Mr. McLaren at 8 a. m.
The entire male student body will then be di
vided into two squadsâ tirst to work from 8 to 10
o'clock, second from 10 to 12. The first squad
will then work from 1 to 3 o'clock, second
squad 3 to 5, which will give four hours for
each squad, two hours at a time with three
hours' rest. This plan was suggested by one
of the students and seemed in every way a de
sirable one. pup:-
The work will consist solely of picking,
shoveling and wheelbarrowing, the cutting of
any pines or bridge-building being done pre
liminarily, zy
There will be an experienced workman with
each squad.
A complete cessation of university work Is
contemplated for the two, three or "four days
the work is going on. This, however, has not
been finally decided.
In relation to the willingness and pur
pose on the part of the students to live up
to their word when they shouted with one
voice, "We will," and to allay any misap
prehension on the part of those who do
not believe that the student body meant
what they said, he stated :
There is just a tinge of doubt in the minds of
some of the regents who are not graduates of
the university as to the abilityâ possibly even
the willingnessâ of the students to do the work
anticipated of them.
I know and heartily assure the student-body
that the doubt is not intended as a reflection
on them, but I believe it gives a desirable op
portunity to convince all concerned of tho
"powers ano purposes" of the students of Cali
fornia University.
Trustees' Meeting.
At the meeting of the Board of Town
Trustees last night, A. D. Wilder of the
Southern Pacific Company appeared to
protest against the ordinance limiting the
speed of trains in Berkeley to ten miles an
hour, :A..4pp
* Mr. Wilder stated that, if such regula
i tions were enforced, it would be necessary
for his company to reduce the number of
trains, as, with a maximum speed of ten
miles, the trains could not complete the
trip from the mole to Berryman and re
turn in the time allotted to them. Tne
matter was referred to a special commit
tee, to be reported upon at the next board
meeting. T7.T- '
Attorney W. H. Waste addressed the
board in behalf of the protestants against
the new license ordinance relating to the
taxation of vehicles. A petition signed by
forty-four names was presented asking for
the "repeal of the section touching on vehi
cles.
A letter was read from Attorneys Fitz
gerald and Abbott of Oakland addressed to
the Town Attorney with reference to John
Casey's application for a liquor license,
which the board had refused to grant.
The attorneys stated that Casey had
placed the matter in their hands, and that
if nothing was done toward granting his
application they would be compelled to
take the matter into court and have it de
termined whether a board of trustees has
the power to deny without any reason
therefor the application of any one to sell
liquor when there are no protests or any
thing to show that the applicant is not en
titled to the permission.
Bills to the amount of $1181 44 were al
lowed from the general fund and $188 56
from the road fund.
The board will meet next Saturday even
ing as a committee of the whole to con
sider the question of water rates.
Who Are the Champions?
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 28.â Arthur W.
North, when elected president of the West
ern Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic As
sociation, said that he had a scheme to
benefit athletics.
This scheme took form at the meeting
of the association held in Chicago January
17, from which word has just been re
ceived. President North had called the
meeting to organize the executive com
mittee and to consider his promised plan.
The committee organized as follows:
President, A. W. North, University of
California; vice-president, P. L. Blodgett,
Orinnell College, Iowa; secretary, G. A.
Bliss, University of Chicago; treasurer, C.
M. Lewis, University of Illinois; and W.
B. Allison, State University of lowa W.
B. Kay, Northwestern University; 11. F.
Cochems, University of Wisconsin. ,
'â â _â  North's proposition was that the W. T.
A. A. A. take steps toward forming an
alliance with the I. A. A. A. A. to hold an
annual championship contest between the
individual winners of the two associations,
which was adopted. ffiffij^JPgfljjjM^
This has been North's pet plan since his
return from the East with the U. C. track
team, and hehascorrpsponded with Caspar
Whitney, John V. Crum, Captain Sheldon
and other noted athletes in regard to it. '/â '
If the I. A. A. A. A. adopts this proposi
tion it will become possible to say who are
the real collegiate champions of the
United States, whereas at the present time
it is quite impossible.

An Ordinance Void. y :
ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 28.â A house- j i
mover named Henderson had a contract
last summer to move a house from a point I
on San Antonio avenue to a point on i
Santa Clara avenue. There is a municipal !
ordinance which requires that buildings j
that are being moved must be' moved I
across railway tracks between the hours of j
12 o'clock midnight and 5 a. m., so as not.
to interrupt traffic, and that the wires of
electric railways must be cut when de
mand for it is made. Henderson got the j
house on the tracks one night and could I
not get it off before 9 o'clock, the next
morning. There was a consequent Dlock- |
ade of the electric railway, and the man
ager sued the house-mover to recover dam
ages therefor, together with costs. : .p : .A
The trial took place before Recorder St. I

the railway and declaring the house-mov
ing ordinance to be invalid. The decision j
recites that an ordinance granting a fran- i
chise to the electric railway was first i
granted and that the house-moving ordi- I
nance, so-called, is an infringement of the !
rights granted by the franchise ordinance j
and was therefore of no force.

sulting from cutting the wire at $30 and
lost fares because of the forced idleness of
the road at $10 more, making a total of $40 :
which the company was entitled to collect, j

ALAMEDA, Cal., Jan. 28.â Some idea j
may now be obtained of the amount of j
money that is likely to be spent by the
municipal board in expanding and enlarg
ing the city's electricjplant. On Monday
night proposals to erect the additional
building and to furnish machinery were
opened. The lowest bid for the building
was $1970 and the lowest bid for engine
and boilers was $14,767. That includes no
electrical machinery nor the setting up
and starting of the new plant. Before it is I
ready to run $20,000 at least will have been
expended in construction. Last year $19,- |
000 and upward was expended in con
struction with the result that but little was
accomplished and as much more money is
now necessary to meet the requirements.

THE BACHELORS DISBAND
A Graceful but.Complete Capitu
lation by the Alameda
Club.
FOUR OF THE MEN ENGAGED.
It Is Expected That the Leap-Year
Wedding List Will fie the Great
est on Record.
The Alameda Bachelors' Club has given
up the leap-year fight and disbanded. It
is said that four of the members have be
come engaged since the girls announced as
an ultimatum that kissing would be per
mitted only after betrothal, and these
members and some of the others secretly
agreed that the self-imposed system of
fines could not be maintained during the
year.
Complete and "unconditional is the capit
ulation.
The girls have won their victory, and it
is the rule in the beautiful cily of the En
cinal that there is to be no more ante
engagement kissing until 1897. It is ex
pected that the wedding list will be twice
as great as during any previous year, for
the present surrender on the part of mÂ»n
has been graceful and unanimous, and tha
conflict has exposed the seriousness of be
ing eligible to a bachelors' club.
It was all prearranged before the final
meeting of the vanquished organization,
and when the members came together
they all knew the club was to be dis
banded.
Postmaster Stoddard, according to the
report made public yesterday in Alameda,
began the proceedings by moving that the
reading of the minutes of the preceding
meeting be dispensed with.
'Burn 'em up!" and "We don't want to
hear them were among the shouts heard
in response, and then President Smiley
made a speech. He said, in part:
I had hopes th.it this club would rill a long
felt want and accomplish an abundance of
good for its members, but I realize that I was
sadly mistaken. The experience of the last
: four days has taught me a sad lesson. If this
tning keeps up much longer life will cease to
have any charm whatever For me.
Judge St. Sure and Lawyer Simpson
| arose simultaneously to say that if the
I club were to be disbanded the proceedings
j should be in a legal manner, so as to leave
no doubt that the organization had gone
out of existence.
Others told of their personal hardships
during the trouble, and then suddenly a
motion to adjourn sine die was carried
with a wild hurrah and the members hur
ried away to tell the enemy all about it.

HOME INDUSTRY EXHIBIT.
Manufacturers' Association De
termined to Hold a Grand
Fair.
A RIVAL TO THE INSTITUTE.
A Big Pavilion Will Be Built and
Filled With Home Products
This Spring.
The internal differences among the
members of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association have been straight
ened out, and that body has taken up the
cudgels against the Mechanics' Institute.
This action will assume the shape of the
construction of another big pavilion and
the conducting of an exposition to rival
the annual Mechanics' Institute fair.
Yesterday the active members of the
association held a very important meeting
and three matters were discussed and dis
posed of â the settling of interna! differ
ences, the Japanese cheap goods matter
and the holding of a home industry expo
sition in March and April.
At the last meeting of the directors it
â was decided to hold the annual conven
tion of the association in February, and
the by-laws were changed so as to permit
of holding an electi on of directors then in
stead of in September. The stockholders
met yesterday and declined to fully in
dorse* the action oi the directors who
voted to change the by-laws, which, when
revised, fixed the annual meeting for next
month. This indefinitely postponed the
holding of the convention. The amend
ment with regard to the manner in which
directors shall be nominated was ap
proved.
The stockholders' meeting adjourned
and a meeting of the directors was held,
which was marked by manifestations of
co-operation and harmony.
The special committee appointed to
comer with a committee to investigate
the invasion of this country presented its
report, which contained a statement of all
that took place at the joint committee
meetings, also the special reports of J. P.
Currier, w. F. Bowers, Wakefield Baker,
Julian Bonntag, W. B. Curtis and William
Rutherford. Thecommittee presented the
following resolutions adopted by the joint
committee:
"Resolved, That this committee report to their
respective bodies, Including in such report the
reports made by the Bub-committees, and also
that of Mr. Rutherford, and urge upon the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association ami
the Chamber of Commerce to request the Cali
fornia delegation in the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States to recom
mend the appointment of a committee of three
to investigate the question of Japanese manu
facture importations and export trade; and
'â Resolved, rhattthis committee recommend
to the Chamber of Commerce and the .Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association that a
mass-meeting be held in the Chamber of Com
merce at the very earliest date possible, in or
der to set before the people the position we now
occupy toward Japan."
And having presented these resolutionss,
your committee hope that this board of direc
tors will take the matter up immediately and
follow out the suggestions contained in said
resolutions.
These resolutions were indorsed and the
same committee was instructed to carry
out its suggestion of keeping the ball roll
ing. These gentlemen will in a few days.
in conjunction with those of the Chamber
of Commerce, set to wo.'k to arrange for a
general anti-Japanese mass-meeting, at
which the situation will be put in shape to
present to Congress in the form of a
memorial.
But little time was lost in transacting I
all this business, for the directors were |
anxious to fire a broadside into the Me- i
chanics' Institute on the exposition mat- 'â 
ter. At the previous meeting it was de
cided to hold a home industry exposition
and a committee, consisting of M. Mc-
Glynn, L. R. Mead and 8. H. lacy, was
appointed to see the directors of the in
stitute for the purpose of renting the Me
chanics' Pavilion for six weeks in March
and April. The directors of the institute
refused to rent the big nuildintr, stating
that the proposed exposition would inter
fere with the institute fair later in the
year. However, the institute people sug
gested that the association's members
could exhibit their products at the insti
tute fair. The committee, in presenting
its report, said:
Your committee deeply regret that the direc
tors of The Mechanics' Institute have denied
our request, for we feel that such an exposi
tion held under the auspices of this associa
tion would be productive of great good to the
State, the cause the association is laboring for,
and would be of great assistance to the associ
ation as well. The proposed exposition has
already attracted attention throughout the
State. It is being favorably noticed by the
interior press. Word comes to us that in Berke
ley a manufacturer is already preparing for
an exhibit, and application has been made for
space from Los Angeles. For these reasons
your committee would suggest that the refusal
of the directors of the Mechanics' Institute
â¢should not cause an abandonment of the pro
ject. A tack-down at this time would mean a
heavy setback to the home industry move
ment.
This brought Julian Sonntag to his feet
and he said :
I do not consider the Mechanics' Institute a
representative California body. At its fairs
Eastern manufacturers receive the same if not
more attention than California manufacturers.
It claims to be a mechanics' institute, but the
working men are debarred from seeing the
lair by the exorbitant admission fee charged
at the door. What we want is to present an
exhibit of California-made goods and articles
and have California men, women and children
consumers, both rich and poor, see what can
be produced on this coast. lam in favor of
holding our home industry exhibit in March
and April.
M. J. Keller had a complaint to make of
the way the institute fairs are conducted.
He claimed that he had been an exhibitor
at those fairs, and had not been fairly
treated by the committee on awards, and,
in conclusion, added that he did not be
lieve that the institute people know how
to treat the public decently.
Several others spoke in the same man
ner, and they all favored holding a home
industry exhibition as previously planned.
It did not take long to frame resolutions
to this effect, and the directors cou.d not
resist the temptation of punching a pin
into the institute in the wording of the
resolutions, which areas follows:
Whereas, This association has requested
that the Mechanics' Institute rent to this asso
ciation during the months of March and April
for the purpose of holding a home industry ex
position the building known as Mechanics'
Pavilion in this City, and whereas, the board
of trustees of the MecLanics' Institute have
seen fit to refuse to grant said request, and
whereas, it is the sense of the board of direc
tors that the Mechanics' Institute and the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association
should work together in the common cause of
promoting the industries of California and
whereas, it is the further sentiment of this
board of directors that no work has ever been
contemplated that would aid said industries to
the extent that this proposed exposition would
be it '
Resolved, That this association through Its
board of directors regrets exceedingly that the
board of trustees of the Mechanics* Institute
has taken such action, and be it further
Resolved, That this association do hold in the
City and County of San Francisco during the
months of March and April of this year or as
soon after as possible an exposition of Califor
nia manufactures and products, and be It fur
ther
Resolved, That the secretary of this associa
tion send a copy of these resolutions to the
bOard of trustees of the Mechanics' Institute.
As soon as the foregoing was adopted
the directors discussed what they could do
in the way of obtaining a suitable place
for such an exposition as is contemplated.
Nothing smaller than the Pavilion will
answer the purposes. The sentiment of
the members was that it would be advis
able to lease a large lot for live years at
least and construct thereon a large story
and a half structure. This can be used
tve/y year for a home industry exposition
which the association proposes to hold.
The means for such an undertaking are not
lacking, so they say. Besides, the ex
hibitors would pay enough to meet the
expense for the privilege of advertising
their goods.
It was the sense or the meeting to build
a structure tnat would rival the Pavilion
for miscellaneous patronage, such as
political meetings, horse shows and kin
dred attractions, which would help out in
the item of expenses. The determination
is to fight the institute on every turn pos
sible.
In order to get more information Chair
man Scott appointed Bowers, Mead and
'lacy to look into such matters as the cost
of constructing an exposition building,
leasing land, etc. 47 : - 7
McGlynn. Sproule and Mead were ap
pointed a special committee to alter the
by-laws and constitution so as to permit
the association holding- property.
MUST WORK IN FUTURE
The Mayor Will Keep a Vigilant
Eye on the City Hall
, Janitors.
Auditor Broderick Questions the May
or's Nerve and Gets a Sharp
Answer.
The City Hail janitors and their worth
and unworth were discussed at the meet
ing of the Board ol New City Hall Com
missioners yesterday, and it was decided
that in future 'the ' City Hall employes
whose duties are to keep the corridors and
rooms clean must do more work and less
loafing. The matter came up when Mayor
Sutro remarked that the main stairway is
so dark that he has to feel his way down
with his cane to avoid falling and break
ing his neck.
"I suppose," continued Creswell, "that
you are unaware of the fact that there is a
broad skylight over the staircase. The
layers of dirt on it are so thick that if you
were not told you would never suspect that
there was glass overhead. Now if the jani
tors in this building would play a hose on
that glass those stairs would no longer be
in Stygian darkness."
"Well, we ought to do something about
that." said the Mayor.
"Not we, but you," replied Creswell.
"You are the president oi the Board of
Supervisors."
"Well. I'll call their attention to the
matter," said the Mayor.
"As Mayor of this City you can do much
more than that," remarked Auditor Brod
erick.
The Mayor looked at the Auditor as if he
wanted a suggestion.
"As Mayor of this City you can walk
, around this building and wherever you
find that a man has not been doingnis
duty yon can discharge him.''
The Mayor again promised to attend to
the matter.
"All you want is a little nerve to make
this quite a respectable-looking building,"
said Broderick.
"Nerve!" gasped the Mayor, as if
amazed to find that any one disputed his
possession of nerve.
"Yes, a little backbone," added the
Auditor.
"Why, I've got the nerve to make any
body do right, even though it were Hunt
ington or you!" declared the indignant
Mayor.
"Well, just apply a little of it to the
janitors."
The Mayor said he w6uld see in future
that the janitors do their work.

TURNEY DIED AT
THE THROTTLE.
The Engineer as He Was
Found in the Wreck
at Sausalito.
DEATH BY DROWNING.
Medical Examination Shows That
the Body Was Not
Crushed.
HAULING THE ENGINE ASHORE.
The Work Was Completed by the
Wrecking Crew Last Night.
What Officers Say.
William F. Turney, the engineer who
lost his life in the wreck at the Sausalito
ferry slip early yesterday morning, died
with his hand at the throttle.
He was trying to run his engine off the
collapsing wooden apron when taken down
in the crash, and there is no indication
that he made any attempt to escape from
his cab before he was caught and pinioned
by the falling machine. He could have
jumped when the first warning of the
cracking timbers was heard. That was
done by Fireman Williams, but the en
gineer made the fatal delay of an instant
for the sake of doing his duty.
Turney was a brave man, as his asso
ciates declare, and the railroad officers tes-
tify that he had always been faithful in
performing his work. He made an error
of judgment in running his engine upon
the apron that connected the wharf with
the steamer, but he did all in his power to
THE SCENE AT THE SAUSALITO WHARF YESTERDAY WHEN THE WRECKERS WERE AT WORK.
[ From a sl_.oto]_. mndo toy ex " Call " staff artist. ]
:orrect the error at the instant of his danger.
It was not by being crushed between the
engine and the tender that the man was
.iiled, as had been supposed, but by
drowning. That was ascertained by the
medical examiner after the body had been
taken out of the water yesterday evening.
When the actual plunge came Turney was
:anght by one leg between the engine and
lender and the leg was broken, but that
-â â jury would not have been sufficient to
:ause death, and the engineer did not re
tease his hold on the lever even while
irowning.
At low tide yesterday morning, about 5
"â 'clock, a force or about twenty men began
the attempt of removing the engine from
Ihe ferry slip. It was at the freight slip
that the accident occurred, and bo there
iras no interference with the regular trips of
:be passenger steamer. A huge derrick
vas stationed on the wharf at the end of
â¢.he track, but that would not sustain the
sower that was needed to move the huge
Machine tbat was then half buried in the
water. All that could be seen of Turney
was the right hand, which rested on the
*ab window.
As the derrick was not powerful enough
;o remove the engine a huge lifting-shears
K&t rigged up on the wharf, the prepara
tory worK occupying the entire day. The
srst object of the railroad men was to get
;he engineer's body out of the wreck. In

ABSOLUTELY PURE
WILLIAM F. TURNEY, THE ENGINEER WHO WAS KILLED AT SAUSALITO.
[From a -photograph.]
that attempt cables were attached to the
tender and. a locomotive tugged at the
cables. That effort was unsuccessful, how
ever, and the work was not accomplished
until after 6 o'clock, when the big shears
picked up the broken engine and slowly
raised it out of the water and on to the ex
tension of the railroad track.
A crowd of from 200 to 300 people watched
at the scene of the accident all day long,
and man}- persons went from San Fran
cisco.
The body of Turney was examined by a
physician, who ascertained that the only
serious fracture* or bruise was just above
one knee, where the leg was broken. Death
had resulted from drowning. After the
examination the body was removed to San
Rafael.
Mrs. Turney, the widow, is an invalid,
and it is feared that she will not survive
the shock. She and her husband, with
their little child, had recently moved into
their new home in San Rafael.
At 1 :30 o'clock yesterday morning, when
the accident occurred, Mrs.. Turney was
visiting at the home of her neighbor, Mrs.
Cochrane. She was waiting for her hus
band to return, as usual, at 1 o'clock, and
while she was .waiting she fell asleep in
the rocking-chair. Her husband, she
knew, was late.
Just after she bad fallen asleep a mes
senger arrived to tell her that her husband
had been killed. ' -.â ".'. * ,
The members of the Cochrane family* re
ceived the message. .They : thought best
not to awaken their invalid friend to tell
her of the accident, and so Mrs. Turney
slept till nearly morning. The news pros
trated the woman, and it is feared that the
result will be fatal.
Mrs. James Morrow of 436 Fifth street is
a sister of the dead engineer, and Miss
Maggie Turney, another - sister, .resides
with her. Their mother died two years ago.
William Francis Turner was born in
Corte Madera, Marin County, 33 years ago.
He learned his trade as engineer in the
narrow-gauge railroad '. shops at Sausalito
and has been in the employ of : the com

an unusually careful man, * taking .no
chances . of an ' accident, which goes to
account for the fact that no mishap ever

occurred to him during the dozen years on
the North Pacific Coast line.
"He was our only brother and only near
relation living," said Miss Maggie Turney
last evening, "and we three were a little
family even more closely drawn together
than brothers and sisters usually are. He
was very kind to us and to his" wife, and
we idolized him. p;4p-<p:
"Only a few hours before the accident I
was over in Sausaiito and he was talking
about poor Jack Keyer, the engineer
killed at Baden Sunday evening. Will
knew Keyer and the fatal occurrence made
a deep impression on his mind. He said
a railroad engineer could not. be over
cautious, as danger was about him
all the time. He seemed to be think
ing of his own constant peril
in that calling and kept commenting
! upon the accident. He and his wife and
I little girl had just moved into their new
i home at San Rafael, all paid for with his
I earnings on the road during his twelve
| years, and everything seemed bright and
; fair. Now he is dead and his invalid
i widow is heartbroken, j
"One paper yesterday morning unkindly
i said that he was to blame- for the loss of
his own life. That was unjust, because he
was so careful and was always afraid of
the wharf at Sausalito. He would not
have gone on the ferry-boat with his
heavy engine unless be was obliged to do
so, I know."
Turney was a member of the '. United
Workmen and the Brotherhood of Loco
j motive Engineers,: in which orders he had
I his life insured for $4000.
Assistant Superintendent W. H. Han
j non stated yesterday that y the company
had issued strict; orders to all conductors
and engineers under no circumstances to
allow locomotives or tenders to run on the
apron in backing up to the boat for freight
cars. The apron* itself, Mr. Hannon said,
was capable of sustaining a dead weight of
seventy tons. The engine and tank, or
tender, together,* weighed â¢ but a little over
forty tons, the engine: alone having a
weight of twenty-five tons.
;T Both engine â  and } tender, be said, were
run successfully! on the apron, Conductor
Murray having *,' signaled to Engineer
Turney to back down, to make the
coupling. ;'
As the engine had taken on three empty
freight cars, Conductor Murray. thought it
possible to make tho connection without
running on to the apron anything but the
empty cars. ,1 lie was not 'aware that the
cars on the boat were so far from the apron
as to make it impossible to couple with the
render at a safe distance.
In leaving/the boat, and in the strain
and pressure incidental to : starting the
train, the weight and force of the engine
were enormously increased and at that
â¢ moment the crash came. '- . ' y
- Fireman "Williams said that he scarcely
knew how he escaped 5 and ; his friends be
lieve that when carried .over, with the en
gine he was knocked , insensible and the
water revived him.* * >
Turneyhad been unfortunate in recent,
years. His wife's physical ailments and
troubles bad crippled her and her husband
had made a great outlay from his savings
to meet the expenses that crowded upon
him. - â¢

of, Ottowa, Canada, where: two of bis
cousins, the Murray brothers, are members
of the Ottawa Parliament. '
TAILORS ORGANIZING.
Will Form a Union and Stand for
Higher Wages.
About 100 tailors assembled last evening
to discuss their condition and the condi
tion of the trade. The object in 7 reality
was to organize a custom journeymen's
union. Very little was done toward â¢:*â  this
end as the tailors so far are not sure of
their ground. In this City there are nearly
2000 in this line of .business, and among
this number there exists but little fraternal
fellowship. With, them it is a case of
every one for himself.
During the past few weeks a number of
the custom tailors ' have been discussing
the advisability of forming a union, and it
was a surprise to the leaders to find so
many present at last evening's meeting.
One of the. prominent members explained
the situation in language that could not
be misunderstood. He said that the con
dition of the tailors of San Francisco is
worse than those of other cities.
One reason is that every man desires to
bÂ«Â» a boss. Consequently there are nearly
2000 bosses in i this City and the whole
salers and merchant tailors take advantage
of this state of affairs. Nearly all the
journeymen do their work at home, as
sisted by their wives and daughters. At
first they made fair wages, but gradually
the merchant tailors and wholesalers began
to reduce the prices paid tor work. As the
pay dropped lower the men and women
worked longer, until now every tailor and
his family works late into the night in
order to make a living. For example, the
wholesale dealer gives out the material for
a coat and pays $2 25 or $2 50 for its mak
ing. In other cities they pay $G for the
same work. Consequently here a tailor
and his family have to make up two and a
half coats to get as much pay as the tailor
in the East gets for making one coat.
The speaker went on to explain that the
reason for this state of affairs was that in
the East the tailors work together in large
factories and stand together against un
just reductions. Here they work at home,
and Â«suppose if they do not accept the
work at the prices offered some one else
will get the work. He urged them all to
form into a club or union and resist any
further attempt to cut the rates. The mat
ter was discussed until a late hour, but
only a temporary organization was formed.
It is likely that it will be made permanent
within a week or ten days. Several of the
leaders declare that if the union is formed
With a majority of the tailors on the roll,
a stand will be taken for higher wages.
Woman Under the Old English Laws.
In England less than ninety years ago
it was' not unusual' for a -man 'to sell his
wile into servitude. A"common-law hus
band and wife were one person and that
one person was the husband. Upon mar
riage the .husband became entitled to all
his wife's goods and chattels, also to the
rents and profits of her lands. He was
her :â  lord, bound to supply . shelter, food,
clothes and medicine. He "was entitled to
her earnings and. the custody of her per
son. He had power ;to choose her asso
ciates, separate her from her relatives,
restrain her religious and - personal free
dom, and, if necessary, chastise her moder
ately, as though she were his child.
The father of legitimate children *. was
bound for their 'maintenance and educa
tion, and was entitled to their labor and
custody. He had power to dispose of them
until they were 21 years of age by -deed or
legacy, and the testamentary guardian's
right to the children's custody superseded
that of their mother. ; The mother was en
titled to no power but to reverence and re
spect from her children. She had no legal
authority over them nor right to their
service. Only the mother of an illegiti
mate child was entitled to its control and
custody.

OAKLAND CHURCH
GIRL MYSTERY
Miss Fannie Parker Has
Been Missing From
Home a Week.
NO REASON FOR GOING.
Relatives or Friends Cannot De
vise a Theory in Regard
to the Case.
FEAR SHE HAS BEEN KILLED;
Miss Parker Was Twenty-Seven Years
Old, Not Romantic, and Would
Not Have Eloped.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Jan. 28. f â¢
The First Baptist Church is in a fever of
excitement over the strange disappearance
of Miss Fannie Parker, one of the best
known and most popular singers in the
church choir. Not since the early chapters
of the Durrant disclosures has so much in
terest been demonstrated as is being shown
in the present case.
Nearly a week has passed since Miss
Parker left her home, and although search
has been made in all directions in all the
public institutions in Oakland, San Fran
cisco and adjoining cities where news of
her might likely be obtained, not a trace
of the missing girl has been discovered,
and her relatives say that she has disap
peared as absolutely as if she had been
swallowed up by the earth.
Not one of her relatives can suggest the
slightest reason for her disappearance, and
although every effort has been made to ac
count for the girl's absence through all the
usual channels ' in which information of
missing girls is generally obtained,
nothing has been learned, and her
relatives are as much in the dark as to her
whereabouts and the purpose, if any, of
her disappearance as they were the first
morning after her disappearance. Detec
tives have been at work, the large number
of : friends in the church .of the ; missing
young woman have exhausted every
means at their command, but with no
result.
Miss Fannie .Parker lived with her par
ents at 1213 Fourteenth street. Her two
sisters and brother reside there, and the
family is said to have been - a peculiarly
happy one. 7 All attend the First Bap
tist Church, and the missing girl's
sister, Emma, also sings in the choir.
Fannie is described by all her friends and
relatives as a rather dignified young lady,
about 27 years of age and of such a de
meanor as would command respect from
every one." Her outward bearing was
rather austere and would repel a stranger
rather than attract. â  .
She was strict in h er religious ideas, but
frequently attended a private party and
seemed to enjoy life. She was, not given
to spells of moodiness and was of a cheer
ful and pleasant disposition at home. She
"was -a dressmaker by; occupation T and
earned a comfortable^ income at her busi
ness. On no occasion "â . had she ever been
known to stay away from* her home before,
and her character in every regard is stated
by' everybody - to be absolutely above re
proach. .77 77
â¢- Last Wednesday night she left her home,
and, as it was the regular prayer meeting
night, nothing was 'â¢- thought of her going
out. T She 7 did not return and from 7 the

time' she crossed the threshold nothing
has been seen or heard of her.
Miss Parker's brother was called upon
at the house this evening. "It is a perfect
mystery to us all," said he, "and we do
not know which way to turn. We
have been everywhere that we can think
of and have communicated with every
body that we thought could throw any
light on the matter, but our efforts have
been useless. Nearly a week has now
passed and nothing have we seen or heard
of Fannie. She went out as usual and
w hen she failed to return we did not know
what to make of it.
Â "At first we thought, as everybody does
under such circumstances, that she had
gone home with some of her girl friends.
But when the next day passed and no trace
of her could be found we began to fear
that something had happened. We can
not even suggest a reason for her going
away. â â  .y.A.'-' : Ap/Ai '
â¢-Whether it is foul play or whether it is
entirely voluntary we cannot and do not
care to think because everything we can
possibly conjecture is uncertain. We
Know nothing except that she has gone.
She made no preparations for her de
parture, and everything in her room is the
same as if she expected to return.
"Nothing happened the last evening she
was at home to cause us to suppose she
would go away. Everything was the same
as usual, and there was no unpleasantness.
There is nothing in our knowledge and, so
far as we have been able to learn, nothing
in the knowledge of other? that will throw
any light on the sad affair. Fannie was
one of the most retired girls I know.
"She was not keening company with
any young man, and was not at all partial
to the company of young men. She was
not a girl of a romantic nature that would
be likely to run off and get married, be
cause she was 27 years old, and was quite
at liberty to please herself in such mat
ters." ,'â â /
The night previous to her disappearance
Miss Parker was at the house of Miss Co
burn and Miss M. Holmes, who live next
door to the Parker family. She attended
a party and was as gay and lively as ever.
"No one would ever dream of Fannie
disappearing," said Miss Coburn to
night. "She was such a staid girl
to strangers and not at all roman
tic. 7 We fear that something has
happened and we cannot gusss what.
Fannie is not staying away of her own
free will, and -unless something that we
cannot imagine has happened she must be
restrained somewhere. She would never
look at a man and was one of the most
reticent of all the girls in the church.
"She was here last Tuesday night and
made a promise to be at a meeting at Mrs.
Schreiber's, 'on Linden street, to-night.
When we parted she was just as bright as
ever."
Everybody describes Miss Parker as a
girl who was no more affable toward men
than propriety made necessary, and all
are surprised that she should have so sud
denly disappeared.
The meeting at the Schreiber house to
night was a very, somber one. It was a
business meeting for the purpose of trans
acting some business with the church
work, but the absence of Miss
Parker seemed to throw a gloom over the.
proceedings. Everybody was aware of the
unhappy -news, and when the time for
prayer arrived all joined fervently in a pe
tition to the Almighty that the mystery
might, be solved and the absent sister be
speedily restored to her place.
Rev. Dr. Hobart, pastor -of the church,
was present, and the earnestness of his
words showed how keenly he shared the
grief of the missing one's relatives.
A very ; close friend ; of the family said
to-night that a few months ago a conver
sation was held in the Parker home in
which Fannie took part.: The conversation
turned on ; suicide and this AA subject ;
was (discussed 'in its" many phases. Miss
Fannie made a remark that was not heeded
at the time, : but which is remembered
vividly in the light of the present circum
stances. /'.
. "If ever I should decide to commit
suicide," she said, "I would go and; jump
into the bay. * But I would 1 take care * that
my body was never recovered. I would so
weight it that when I sank it would be for
ever."
