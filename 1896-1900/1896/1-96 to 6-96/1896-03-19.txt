TWO OUTLAWS
Attempted Hold-Up of a
Southern Pacific Train
Near Tagus.
ONE ROBBER WOUNDED.
Under Sheriff Daggett and Dep
uty Reed Struck by the
Dandits' Bullets.
DESPERATE FIGHT AT NIGHT.
The Wounded Man Leaves a Long
Trail of Bloodâ Posse Hurried
to the Scene.
TULARE, Cal., March 19.â An attempt
was made at 1 o'clock this morning to
hold up the southbound passenger train
No. 19 on the Southern Pacific Railroad.
In the fight that followed between the
two bandits attempting the robbery and
Under Sheriff Earl Daggett and Deputy
Victor Reed, who were on the train, one
of the outlaws was shot, and, it is believed,
killed.
Daggett was badly wounded and is be
lieved to be dying. Reed was slightly
wounded. The attempted robbery occurred
at Tagus, a small station eight miles
north of this city.
One week ago Sheriff Merritt was in
formed that an attempt would be made to
hold up northbound train 20 to-night. He
at once made arrangements to give the
would-be robbers a warm reception.
To-night a posse of six was formed, four
of the numberâ Sheriff Merritt and Depu
ties Russell, Hoply and Thomasâ being
sent by team to Tulare to board No. 20.
To guard against treachery Merritt also
resolved to put a guard aboard the south
bound trainâ No. 19. This guard was com
posed of Under Sheriff Daggett and Deputy
Reed.
Daggett and Reed boarded the train at
(iosoh^n. They mounted the end of the
tender, with their backs to the baggage
car.
According to Engineer Wright's story,
when they arrived near Tagus, he saw a
masked man clambering over the coal on
the tender toward him with a revolver in
each hand.
Hs had no sooner discovered the robber
than the latter espied the two officers lying
in wait on the end of the tender.
The masked man at once opened fire
â¢with both revolvers, and Daggett and Reed
were hit.
The two officers, though wounded, re
turned the lire, and the outlaw fell from
the tender. Meanwhile another bandit
attempted to board the engine, but when
his companion was shot he jumped off.
The engine was brought to a standstill,
and while the wounded officers were
looked after the train crew hurried back
to where the shooting had occurred. A
long trail of blood gave evidence that the
outlaw had been badly wounded.
The train came on to this city, and at 2
o'clock this morning a posse of officers left
for the scene on a handcar.
A messenger has been dispatched to Vi
saiia to summon Hon. Alfred Daggett to
the bedside of his son.
Victor Reed says that the masked man,
when he saw the officers, yelled:
"Throw up your hands, you."
Then the robber commenced to shoot.
In the excitement Reed did not know he
was shot and returned the fire. The bandit
jumped straight into the air and fell over
and off the coal bunker. The coal is satu
rated with Wood.
The doctors have extracted the ball
from Dageett's side. It is a rifle ball, 38
calibre. The officer has shown great nerve
and coolness.
Officer Harry Bernstein of Hanford and
the Visslia correspondent of The Call ar
rived just as the train pulled in and ren
dered assistance to the wounded men.
The side of the tender is covered with
Dlood. The Winchester of the robber was
pickea up covered with blood.
EDISON'S CRANK VISITOR.
A Mysterious Young Man Walks From
Nebraska to New York With a
Grievance.
NEW YORK, N. V., March 18.â A
young man who said his name was Burt
Budgeon of Edison, Nebr., appeared at
Thomas A. Edison's laboratory in Orange
yesterday and demanded an audience with
the inventor. Edison has received many
lerters from Budgeon in the last few years.
The young man said that eight years ago
Edison appropriated from Him a patent
able idea relating to arc lights and h;id
made thousands of dollars from it, while
the real dho.overer had received nothing.
When Budgeon appeared he said. that
Mr. Edison had paid no attention to his
letters, so he had walked all the way from
Nebraska to collect his claim. His clothes
and shoes were worn, his face was covered
by a beard, iiis hair linn!/ down his back
and he bore evidences of telling the truth

regarding his long walk. He offered to
compromise for $100.
Edison's private secretary, John Ran
dolph, told Budgeon to call again in the
afternoon. When the traveler came back
to keep the appointment a policeman was
in readiness and arrested him. In the
Police Court Justice Condit advised him
to drop the claim. Budgeon finally agreed
to this and was released on his promise to
leave the State and go back to Nebraska.

nection With the Tailors'
Strike.
CHICAGO, 111., March 18.â The first
outbreak of violence in connection with
the tailors' strike occurred this afternoon
in tlie sweatshop district of Halstead
street. The arrival of a squad of police
under command of Captain John Wheeler
prevented a general riot between the
strikers, non-union workers and sympa
thizers with the strikers. A large delega
tion from the Garment Workers' Union
called at the Â«weaishop of Heyman Kauff
man. at 486 Halstead street, shortly after
noon and tried to induce the non-union
men to stop work until the strike was set

The non-union men refused and the
strikers became boisterous, when Kauff
man raised the front window oi his shop
and fired half a dozen shots into the
crowd, causing wild excitement. No one
was hit.
The police guard at the factory sent in a
riot call and the officers charged the in
creaainjr crowd in a body. Kauffman and
three of his employes were arrested, with
several strikers.

AMERICANS ARE BARRED.
Cannot Sit on the Anglo- Xiearaguan
Commission.
GREYTOWX, Nicaragua, March 4, via
New Orleans, March 18.â Official proclama
tion is made in the Boletin de los Debats,
the official journal, that a convention has
been agreed upon between Lord Salisbury
and the Salvadoran Minister in London,
acting for Nicaragua, to "settle amicably
the claims of divers British subjects for
losses sustained by them on the Mosquito
reserve." It was supposed that with the
payment of the ?75,000 smart money to the
British consular agent, Hatch, all further
claims for damages had Deen dropped, but
this seems not to be the case.
The convention retains the words which
were regarded as reflecting on the United
States in the original demand. Article 1
provides for the appointment of the com
mission, which is to consist of a represen
tative of England (well versed in Spanish),
a representative of Nicaragua (who knows
well the English language) and a jurist not
a citizen of any American State. This last
shall be president of the commission.
The commission is to meet at Bluefields
as early as possible. Both Governments
have ratified the convention.

CUSTOMS OFFICIALS TRICKED.
Clever Strategy of the Managers of
the Expeditionâ Success of a
Former Venture. â¢
SOMERS POINT, N. J., March 18.â
After three failures General Calixto Gar
cia is at last upon his way to Cuba to fight
against the Spaniards. Together with
sixty-two of his countrymen he was put
aboard the steamship Bermuda off here
this morning by a little passenger steamer
from Atlantic City. The entire scheme
was cleverly worked out. and the agents of
the Spanish Government are said to have
been badly taken in.
It is known that the members of the ex
pedition left Philadelphia in a rather open
manner on Sunday night in a tug. To all
intents and purposes, it was proclaimed
from the housetops that their destination
was the Delaware Breakwater and that it
was from off here a steamer would be
boarded for Cuba. It is presumed the
Spanish officials had the tug followed when
it left Philadelphia. The Cubans went
upon this presumption at least, and dur
ing a fog on Monday afternoon their tug
doubled and turned up the Delaware Bay
and river to Camden, arriving there Mon
day evening.
The party at once boarded a special
train, which landed them at Tuckahoe.
The Cubans boarded the steamboat Atlan
tic City, which was waiting for them.
The Atlantic is used for summer traffic at
the seashore resort of that name. It has
been out of commission for several months.
On Monday last the Atlantic City took out
papers of inspection from the custom
house, for the purpose, as supposed by the
customs officials, of puttingher into tem
porary commission, as it was known cer
tain parties bad been negotiating to pur
chase her.
The Atlantic City left Tuckahoe at 6 A. sc.
yesterday and steamed to Ocean City,
where she lay all night. While the Atlan
tic City was at Tuckahoe and Ocean City,
none of the Cubans were visible on deck,
but this morning, when the whistle of the
Bermuda attracted people along the coast,
the concealed men came on deck and gave
cheer after cheer as the Atlantic City
started out to meet the arms-laden Hteamer.
Beyond the three-mile limit, the transfer
of the Cubans to the Bermuda took place,
and the steamer then proceeded on her
way.
The Custom-house officials were caueht
napping, and could do nothing to hinder
the transfer of the men. They at once,
however, communicated with the authori
ties at Wasnington.
R. H. Inuersoll, secretary of the com
pany which owns the Atlantic City, says
that the steamer was put into commission
only for the purpose of giving her a trial
trip for the benefit of her intended pur
chasers.
ARMS AMI* MEM LAX It ED.
Success of a Filibustering Expedition to
the Island, - .
JACKSON, Fla., March 18.â A special to
theTimeÃ-Union from Key West, Fla., says:
The steamer Three Friends of Jackson
ville, in command of Captain Napoleon B.
Broward, arrived here at noon to-day,
having succeeded in landing in Cuba Gen
eral Enrique Collazo. Major-General Her
nandez and Duke Estrada, besides fifty
four men taken off the schooner Ardel,
from Tampa, and the entire cargo of arms
and ammunition of the schooner Mallory
from Cedar Keys.
It was by long odds the most important
expedition that has set out from this coun
try, and the Cubans here, when tbey
learned that the Three Friends had safely
fulfilled her mission, shouted "Viva la
Cuba" until they were hoarse. They de
clared that it would change the charact r
of the whole war, as the unarmed mea
would now be armed and those without
ammunition would be supplied and that
Maceo, who has been wary and cautious,
would be more aggressive than he had
ever been before.
The cargo of arms landed by the Three
Friends and Mallory was as. follows:
Seven hundred and fifty thousand rounds
of cartridges, 1400 riÃes, 1200 machetes, 400
revolvers, besides reloading tools, etc.
The Three Friends met the Mallory at
the Alligator Key. The Ardell had just
finished transferring the men to her.
While they were rendezvousing there be
hind the pines in a deep creek three big
Spanish meh-of-war steamed slowly by,
but they did not discover that there was
anything suspicious-looking in shore, al
though with a glass men could be seen in
their lookouts scanning the horizon as
well as searching the shore.
On Sunday, about noon, no vessels being
in sight, the Three Friends toos in tow the
Mallory and steamed southward under a
good head of steam. The Three Friends is
a powerful tug, and by Monday night was
close enough to the Cuban shore to hear
the breakers. Several ship lights to the
west were seen, one of which was evidently
a Spanish man-of-war, for it had a search
light at its bows, and was sweeping the
waves with it, bnt the Three Friends was a
long way off and had no light, and so was
out of reach of the Spaniards.
At 1 o'clock that night by aid of a naph
tha launch and two big surf boats which
had been taken out of Jacksonville the
Three Friends landed men and ammunition
from her hold and that of the Mallory. It
took four and a half hours to complete
the job. There were hundreds of men on
the shore to assist, and they did it silently,
appreciating the peril of the undertaking.
The Cubans on shore recognized Gen
eral Enrique Callazo immediately, and no
words can describe their joy upon seeing
him. He is a veteran of Cuban wars and
is one whom Spain fears. In fact, it is a
known fact that during his sojourn in
Florida he has been shadowed by detec
tives, who have been instructed to spare
no expense to keep Collazo from reaching
(Juba.
When it was whispered that Collazo
was really among them they seemed not
to believe their ears, but came forward and
looked, and seeing that there was really
no mistake they threw up their arms and
wept. Major Hernandez and Duke Es
trada were also enthusiastically welcomed.
It was reported to-night that Maceo has
received the arms of the first expedition
that set forth three days before the Ihree
Friends landed. These were not from the
Commodore, for they reported that they
were on the lookout for that vessel.
On Tuesday morning, as the Three
Friends was returning, it sighted a
steamer that answered the description of
the Commodore. It was headed south
ward and pushing along apparently at the
rate of fifteen knots an honr. This vessel
has an engine capable of driving a ship
twice its size, and has a speed of seventeen
knots an hour.
General Collazo, Major Hernandez and
Duke Estrada left Tampa on March 4 and
reached Jacksonville the next day. They
intended to leave on the nieht of March 5,
but their departure was delayed on
account of the capture of the Mallory
until the 12th. After the release the Mal
lory sailed with a part of the arms seized
at Cedar Key last fall, sorre on an island,
some in a house and some that had been
jettisoned and had been released through
the efforts of H. S. Rubens, general coun
sel for the Cubans.
The schooner Ardell left Tampa the
same night with fifty-four men and Brig
adier-General Vasquez, a brother-in-law of
General Collazo,
Five tons of the Mallory's arms and am
munition were taken from her at Tampa
and shipped to Jacksonville in a sealed
car with instructions not to open until
called for.
When the car arrived in Jacksonville one
of the clerks of the railroad, not knowine
the orders, opened the car and unloaded it
in the freight depot of the Florida Central
and Pensacola Railroad, and this discovery
led to all sorts of rumors. It was known
that the boxes contained arms, as they
were heavy and were labeled "Colts Fire
arms Company."
They were promptly removed to the
warehouse of Wightman & Christopher,
the junior member of which firm, who is
known* here as the president of the
Friends of Cuba Club of Jacksonville.
The arms remained in the warehouse until
the night of the 12th inst.
Meanw T hile the Mallory sailed from
Tampa with the remainder of the cargo to
J Alligator Key, the appointed rendezvous.
Alligator Key is about lUO miles south
of Biscayne Bay. It is a port of the Florida
reef and being well wooded is an excellent
place for the purpose. There the Mallory
was joined by the Ardell, where the two
waited for the Three Friends. This vessel
left the dock of the Alabama Coal Com
pany in Jacksonville on the night of the
12th inst. and proceeded to dock in the
rear of Kohn, Furchgot & Co., where a
lifeboat was taken on board.
At 9 o'clock it proceeded to the Wight
man and Christopher Dock, where it loaded
with arms, ammunition and dynamite.
At 10 o'clock it sailed for the mouth of the
river. It stopped at Buckis Mill on the
way and took on General Collazo and his
party and A. W. Barrs, who had driven out
in carriages from the residence of J. M.
Barrs. At this point a large naphtha
launch was taken on, as well as two large
iron Burfboats to be used in landing the
arms, etc.
At daylight on the 13th the vessel pro
ceeded down the coast with N. B. Broward
at the wheel. It arrived at Alligator Key
Sunday morning, and then took in tow the
Mai lory.
The Cubans on shore estimate that if the
other two land they will hare 2,000,000
rounds of cartridges.
They say that when Gomez was before
Havana with 2500 armed men he had only
800 rounds of ammunition, or a third of a
cartridge to each man.
The Times-Union correspondent has
told all of the facts with the exception of
the place of landing, which it is in honor
bound not to reveal.

Prevaricates Slightly in Describing
Her Wanderings Since Run
ning Away.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 18.â Myrtle
Castella, the 15-year-old girl who ran
away to become an actress, put an end to
her Barents' anxiety to-day by coming
home. She arrived ot the noon train
much to everybody's surprise, as her
brother, Fowler, was in San Francisco
searching for her.
Myrtle laughed when questioned about
her trip and answered all questions, but
her replies contradicted many facts. She
denied having been in San Francisco after
the 7th of March, declaring that she left
Santa Cruz on the 6th and was visiting a
Mrs. Shaubusgh on H street, Sacramento,
during her absence. She insisted she had
never written the letters to her brother
bearing the signature "Myrtle Curtice,"
and said some one had lied about her.
In the letters to her father and brother,
coming from 425 Kearny street, San Fran
cisco, the girl had mentioned a friend
named "Jim." A letter received in this
ciÂ«.y to-night from Fowler Castella paid hÂ«
bad found "Jim," who had seen Myrtle on
March 10. and that others had seen her
later. The girl may be sent to a reform
school.

The Battle of Candelaria aÂ» Reported at
Madrid.
MADRID, Spain, March 18.â A special
to the Imparcial from Havana says the
fight near Candelaria, in the western
province, was the most severe that has
taken place for some time. The insurgents,
4000 strong, made a dashing attack upon
the Spanish artillery, completely surround
ing them and maintaining their position
until their lines were broken by grape
shot. They were eventually dislodged at
the point of the bayonet. The rebels, who
were commanded by Maceo, suffered
severe losses. The Government troops
lost eleven killed and sixty-two wounded.
Spanish troops are in pursuit of the
rebels.
MEATS MUST BE MARKED.
Second Reading of Mi/dmay's Bill Voted in
the English House of
Commons.
LONDON, Eng., March 18. â In the
House of Commons to-day F. B. Mildmay,
Liberal Unionist, introduced a bill to com
pel sellers of meats to place marks upon
foreign and colonial meats which would
distineuish them from domestic meats,
and also- indicate which was foreign and
which colonial.
James P. Smith, Liberal Unionist,
moved the rejection of the bill. He agreed
with the provisions of the measure in so
far as it related to the marking of foreign
meats, but was strongly opposed to mark
ing meats which had been imported alive
and slaughtered at the port of landing.
The English and Irish agricultural mem
bers supported the bill, but the Scotch
members were mostly opposed to it. Right
Hon. Charles R. T. Ritchie, President of tha
Board of Trade, speaking on behalf of tha
Government, thought that the bill as in
troduced was unworkable, and suggested
its reference to a select committee.
Mildmay's bill was read a second time
by a vote of 239 to 82. The measure m
ciudes the marking of foreign and colonial
cheese and butter as well as meats.

BAYARD'S FOLLY
BEFORE THE HOUSE
The Resolutions of Censure
Bring Out Passionate
Speeches.
COUSINS' FIERY WORDS.
Sharply Denounces the Embassa
dor and Defends the Ameri
can People.
A TOADY TO THE COBDEN CLUB,
Who Should Be Recalled for His
Imbecility and Impudent
Misconduct.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March IS.â The
announcement that the resolutions re
ported from the Committee on Foreign
Affairs censuring Embassador Bayard
would be the special order for to-day's
session of the House of Representatives
failed to attract to the hall any unusual
attendance, and thereby trie absentees de
prived themselves of the pleasure of listen
ing to the most notable oratorical effort of
the sessionâ the speech by Cousins (R.) of
lowa in support of the resolutions.
The hour fixed for the consideration of
the resolutions was 1:30 o'clock, and the
miscellaneous business of the morning was
not sufficient in volume to occupy all of
the time after assembling until then, so
a recess of fifteen minutes preceded
the beginning of the debate. A number
of private bills were passed in the House,
but only one of particular importance â a
joint Senate resolution instructing the
Secretary of War to transmit an estimate
of the cost of deepening the channel from
Hampton Roads to the Norfolk Navy-yard.
The report of Elections Committee No.
2, confirming Mr. Rusk (D.) in his seat as
Representative from the Third Maryland
District, was received and adopted.
When Hitt called up the Bayard resolu
tions about half of the members of the
House were in their peats, while the public
galleries were only comfortably filled. In
the diplomatic gallery were Baron yon
Kettler. Secretary of the German Embassy ;
Senor Dominguez, Charge d' Affaires of the
Argentine Republic, and Mrs. Dominguez;
Mme. Romero, wife of the Mexican Minis
ter; Mrs. J. W. Foster and Mrs. Van Kens
slaer Cruger (Julian Gordon). The mem
bers' garlery containpd the wives and mem
bers of the families of numerous Represen
tatives.
Hitt was not in good condition physi
cally, and after a few minutes his voice
gave out and he was compelled to close.
In conclusion he expressed the hope that
the resolutions would be adopted, saying
that such speeches as those made by Mr.
Bayard destroyed the respect which an Em
bassador ought to command, diminished
his u=efulness and was a wrong to the peo
ple he represented.
McCreary (D.) of Kentucky and Dins
more (D.) of Arkansas, in speeches of more
than an hour's length each, defended Mr.
Bayard and opposed the passage of the
resolutions.
Draper <R.) of Massachusetts, a member
of the Committee on Foreign Affair*, de
plored the severity of the language in the
resolutions of censure, and, in accordance
with his views of the duty of the Hxiuse,
gave notice that he would ask separate
votes upon the two resolutions.
Cousins' speech, advpeating the adoption
of the committee's report, was the feature
of the occasion. It was by turns sarcastic
and eloquent, filled with "triticiams of Mr.
Bayard and glowing with pictures of the
greatness and glory of the country and of
the individual uncieV the system of protec
tion which the Embassador had de
nounced. He spoke for nearly an hour,
commanding throughout the attention of
his hearers to a marked degree, and at the
close. was given an ovation that lasted sev
eral minutes.
At the conclusion of Dinsmore's address,
ats:2o o'clock, the House adjourned until
to-morrow.
The resolutions will be the subject of
consideration to-morrow and a vote upon
them will not be reached until the close
of the session, and possibly not until Fri-
day.
Speaker Reed announced as the House
conferrees on the Indian appropriation bill
Messrs. Sherman (R.) of New York, Mei
keljohn (R.) of Nebraska and Little (I\)
of Arkansas.
A call of the committees produced no
reports for business and the House at 1:15
took a recess until 1:30, the hour fixed for
taking up the.Bayard resolutions.
After the recess Hitt, chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, called up
the report of the committee upon the Mc-
Call and Barrett resolutions in relation to
the Bayard speeches. The substitute
recommended by the committee recites
extracts from them.
It declares that they are an offense
against diplomatic propriety and an abuse
of the privilege of his exalted position for
which the House of Representatives con
demns and censures him, and further de
clares that partisan speeches by consular
and diplomatic officers impair their use
fulness as such officers aud diminisn the
confidence whjch they should possess at
home and abroad.
The Democratic minority dissented from
the views of the majority and recom
mended that the resolutions do not pass.
Hitt recalled the circumstances in which
the Edinburgh speech was delivered, two
days after the elections in November, 1895,
in the United States, resulting in the vic
tory of the Republicans and the advocates
of the policy of protection, which he de
nounced. The people of that city had that
day read the result of the election ir. the
papers, a result that was disappointing and
unsatisfactory to them. It was in such
circumstances that the reuresentative had
made the speech quoted upon a foreign
platform.
It was hoped, said Hitt, that an exam
ination of the speeches would reveal some
mitigating features of the caseâ that they
had merely an academic importanceâ but
investigation had shown that Mr. BayÂ£Â» - d
had spoken with deliberation and bitter
ness, maligning more than half of his
countrymen. We were all wounded by
the utterances, and yet when Mr. Bayard
was called upon to explain and his reply
had been sent to the House in response to
its request it was found that he justified
them, claiming that no rnle of the de
pariment had been violated by him.
"Think of it," passionately exclaimed
Hitt, "of an Embassador to England
quoting the bare letter of a rule of the de
partment to regulate the actions and atti
tude of all its employes, even to the lowest
consular officer, and pleading that it had
not been violated."
Hitt was followed by McCreary (D.) of
Kentucky in opposition to the resolutions.
He said: "I am opposed to the pending
resolutions and I hope they will not be
adopted. The delay of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs in reporting these resolu
tions tack to the House and the delay of
the House in taking them up, show that
there are many Republicans who are doubt
ful about the propriety of the action pro
posed and are not eager to vote condemna
tion and censure upon one of the worthiest
diplomatic officers in the service of the
United States. The resolutions were un-
precedented in Concessional history. No
diplomatic officer had ever in ths past been
censured or condemned in the House of
Representatives for freedom of speech.
The House might as well censure a Judge
of the Supreme Court of the United States
for a decision rendered by him or a United
States Senator for a speech made by him
as to censure a diplomatic officer for his ut-
te ranees."
The people of the United States, Mc-
Creary declared, were behind Mr. Bayard
in his opposition to protection and trusts.
The people knew that Mr. Bayard had
proved himself a patriot, a statesman and
a faithful public servant; that he had been
conspicuous for many years as a United
States Senator and faithful and able as a
Cabinet officer; that he had filled the great
office of Embassador of the United States
in England with ability and honor; that
he had won the respect and regard of the
English-speaking people, and that he had
done much to promote good will and
friendship between the people of Great
Britain and the United States.
The attack upon Embassador Bayard
was not because he made a brief extem
poraneous speech at Boston, England,
when invited to address the grammar
school and present the awards, but it was
because of his reference in his Edinburgh
speech to "protection" and "trusts.''
The high priests of protection were not
willing to be criticised and they were op
posed to freedom of speech, even in an
academic address on the subject of pro
tection and trusts.
McCreary said if Mr. Bayard was to be
tried because of speeches made by him he
should not be tried or condemned upon a
single phrase, but he should be tried on
the whole context and the full meaning of
the speech should be considered.
Draper (R.) of Massachusetts said he was
not alone in the House in believing that,
while Mr. Bayard's remarks merited some
attention by the House, the severity of thÂ«
languace of the lirst resolution was likelj
to defeat the object of the committee.
Therefore he would move, at the proper
time, to separate the two' resolutions so
that gentlemen who believed with him
that a conservative course should be pur
sued could express their views, which
would not permit them to vote for both
resolutions.
The next speaker was Cousins (R.) of
lowa, a member of the committee. He re
viewed the report of Mr. Bayard's speeches
made to the House by President Cleveland,
and sarcastically commented on the Boston
utterances. Referring to the statement
that the President is a strong man the
speaker said: "Of course the President is
a strong man; but then, Mr. Speaker, are
there not others? Look, for example, in
the Senate of the United States. Have our
memories lost the name of that Senatorial
Hercules who, less than a year ago, com
pelled our 'real' and powerful and honest
President to acquiesce in a bill of legisla
tion which he had designated as 'perjidy
and dishonor?'
"Aye, Mr. Speaker, it would seem that
strong men are found hey.ond official cir
cles.for has it not been averred by gentlemen
upon this floorâ and ihose, too, who will
oppose this resolution â that once upon a
time a certain business man of New York
City wove a web of speculation about the
'strong' and 'honest' will of the President
and extracted from his helpless, honest
hands, below the'inarket price, $62,000,000
of Government bonds that fasten the chain
of debt upon the so-called violent people
for generations yet to come? Why, sir,
we are evidently a Nation of strong men.
But if Mr. Bayard would behold a real
Ajax, up-to-date, unterrified, let him go to
the Department of Agriculture and I will
show him what is strong.
"I deny the declaration of Mr. Bayard
that the people of America are oftentimes
violent. A hundred years of free govern
ment in America challenges the history of
the world for a corresponding century of
patience, morality and progress. And as
for the present time, no people t'nee the
creation of the world ever exhibited such
enduring patience as have the peopla of
America under the past three years of
gross and blundering misrule. If there
have been acts of violence they have been
exceptional and do not permit the charac
terization uttered by this^recreant Em
bassador and applied to the people of
America as a whole."
Proceeding then to Mr. Bayard's speech
at Edinburgh, Cousins quoted the language
complained of, characterizing it as "false,
extravagant and shameful," and said :
"Mr. Speaker, in the first place, every
line and syllable of this diatribe against
the people of America is refuted by the
history and experience of the United
States. In the Becond place it is a political
harangue, violating the express regulations
and instructions given by authority of our
own Government to all consular officers of
the United States.
"Looking across the sea to his native
land, whose mission and confidence he
bore, the same T. F. Bayard, Embassador
of the United States to Great Britain, on
the 7th of November last, saw the party of
protection and of progress carried back to
power on the tide of the popular will.
Putting his ear to the ground, even in a
foreign land, he could hear the victorious
tread of the triumphant column of protec
tion once led by the immortal Lincoln,
and he could not resist the temptation,
even though he bad to violate tne delicate
proprieties of the office which he held and
the instructions which he bore, to satisfy
the vengeance of his ancient prejudice.
"And ho he toadied to the Cobaen Club
and to the school of Manchester, and to
his own prejudice, and told Great Britain
that protection in America had banished
men of independent mind and character
from its public councils, when he knew
that the list of its illustrious advocates,
beginning with the distinguished names of
Washington and Madison and Franklin,
had never ceased to prow where progress
marked the way until it had recorded in
tne register of independent minds and
fame the names of Clay, of Jackson and of
Webster, of Lincoln and of Grant, of Gar
tieid, of Randall and of Blame, ana he
knew that almost on the very day he nt
t>-red that indictment the list of independ
ent minds that champion the doctrine of
protection in America had grown to the
greatest and most significant majority that
ever spoke their independence at a popu
lar election in this country."

Ex-Senator Philetus Sawyer Wins
a Victory That Surprises His
Friends.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 18.â Ex-
Senator Phil etus Sawyer won out in the
Republican State Convention this after
noon, and his victory demonstrated that
notwithstanding the fact that he has
neariy rounded his eightieth year, he is
still a master of the art of political
manipulation. Against admitted odds
the venerable statesman was pitted with
ex-Governor Hoard, the recognized leader
of the younger and aggressive element of
the Republican party in the State, for the
honor of heading the delegation at large
to St. Louis.
Last night and this morning his op
ponents were confident that they bad re
tired him from the political arena, and
when a third of the Congressional districts
on the roll had been called, it looked as
though their claims were well founded.
The upper districts, however, came nobly
to his support, and after the figures had
been footed he was declared the winner
by a majority of 99 in a total vote of 673.
To-night his supporters are enthusiastic
over the outcome and insist that the vic
tory makes him the logical candidate of
the party to return to the United States
Senate as the successor of William F.Vilas.
The remaining significant feature of the
convention was the voting of McKinley
resolutions, despite the action of the com
mittee on resolutions in deciding to re
main silent upon this point. It was the
largest convention of the party in the his
tory of the State, and by the same token
the platform was one of the shortest on
record.
An audience that taxed the Academy of
Music greeted Colonel J. J. Esch of Mil
waukee when, at 12:30, he was presented
as temporary chairman of the* convention.
His speech was a vigorous denunciation of
the policy of the present National Admin
istration and a eulogy of Republican doc
trines.
The applause that greeted the names of
the various candidates ranged from three
seconds for Allison to six for Reed, seven
for Morton and thirty-six for McKinley.
Three cheers for the Ohio man were de
manded by a delegate in the body of the
parquet and they were given with a will.
Then the recess was ordered.
When the convention reassembled at
8 T. M. the temporary organization was
made permanent. The report of the com
mittee on resolutions was short and to the
point. It reads as follows :
The Republicans of Wisconsin, in conven
tion assembled, renew their devotion to the
doctrine of protection. We believe in an ad
justment of tariff duties for the twofold pur
pose of providing sufficient revenue to meet
the requirements of the Government and to
furnish reasonable and adequate protection to
American industries and laborâ a tariff both
for revenue and protection.
We also renew our allegiance to the doctrine
of reciprocity. We favor as a logical and bene
ficial result of protective tariff laws, mutual
trade arrangements with foreign countries
that will provide for our manufacturers and
producers a market for their surplus product
and at the same time enable us to buy from
them under advantageous conditions such ar
ticles as they produce and we need to pur
chase.
The Republicans of Wisconsin are unyield
ing in their demand for honest money. We
are unalterably opposed to any scheme that
will give this country a depreciated or debased
currency. We favor the use of silver as cur
rency, but to the extent only and under such
restrictions that its parity with gold can be
maintained. . ___^_
The platform had scarcely been adopted
when Delegate H. C. Adams of Milwaukee
asked unanimous consideration of a reso
lution that he waved in the air. Numer
ous objections were raised, but they were
withdrawn when he explained that the
subject matter related to "a distinguished
son of Ohio." Then, in stentorian tones,
be read the following :
Resolved, That the Republicans of Wisconsin
recognize in Hon. William McKinley of Ohio
the most distinguished champion of the Re
tiublican policy of protection and reciprocity ;
that we honor him as the defender of a sound
system of finance and believe in him as a type
of the best American citizenship in both pri
vate and public life, and we hereby express to
the delegates elected to the St. Louis conven
tion our judgment that they should use all
reasonable effort to secure his nomination for
the Presidency.
Fifty seconds came from all over the
auditorium, and when the question was
put the affirmative shout and the accom
panying cheers produced a deafening cli
max.
Nominations for delegates-at-Jarge were
next in order, and on the call of the roll
ex-Senator Sawyer and ex-Governor Hoard
Were named. A motion that both be se
lected by acclamation was ruled out by
Colonel Esch. The ballot resulted : Sawyer
386, Hoard 287.
A motion to select ex-Governor Hoard
as the second delegate appeared to carry
by an overwhelming viva voce vote, but
the chair ruled otherwise, and the friends
of the president of the National Dairy
Union demanded a ballot. Eugene S.
Elliott of Milwaukee was also named. The
ballot resulted: Hoard 408, Elliott 271.
For the third delegate Elliott was chosen
with but five dissenting votes. The con
test for the fourth place was between
Major Edward bcbofield of Oconto and J.
H. csiout of Menominee. Geographical
considerations were urged in behalf of the
latter and he was elected by a vote of 374
to 304.
As alternates H. D. Smith of Appleton,
W. F. Heine of La Fayette, J. R. Lyons of
Monroe and Judge W. Plumnier of Peppin
were selected by acclamation.
Major Schofield and Paul Lachman of
Sault County were elected with equal
unanimity as electors-at-large, but later in
the proceedings the former sent from his
hotel a declination of the honor and J. D.
Nels Sr. of Ashland was elected in his
stead.
The names of the Presidential electors
chosen at the meetings of the Congres
sional district delegations were next re
ported and at 6:15 the convention ad
journed sine die.
OPEJT WAlt IX ILLINOIS.
The Cullom Force* Are Arrayed Againtt
McKinley'* Adherent*.
CHICAGO, 111., March 18.â The Illinois
supporters of Major McKinley have per
fected their plans to secure the indorse
ment of their candidate by the Republican
State convention, which meets in Spring
field April 29, and thereby nullify the
election of uninstructed delegates to the
National convention in each Congres
sional district. The Business Men's Mc-
Kinley Club of Cook County has been
chosen as the medium through which the
plan is to be carried out, if possible.
General McNulta, who is chairman of
the club's executive committee in the ab
sence of Samuel W. Allerton in Europe, sent
out to-day by direction of the committee
a circular letter to every county commit
teeman, State and National delegate and
Republican of prominence throughout the
State, urging ail to support and work for
the indorsement of McKinley by the State
convention.
The letter frankly admits that the club
wants to know what State delegates favor
the nomination of the Ohio citizen and
who are opposed. Blanks for reply are in
closed and those marked "confidential"
are to be treated so.
Among Chicago Republicans identified
with the State organization or the city ad
ministration, the news that this circular
had been distributed was received as a
direct and open effort to defeat the no
instruction policy of the party managers
and undermine the candidacy of Senator
Cullom. Open war is declared from now
on by the Cullom forces against the Mc-
Kinley adherents in Illinois.

HUTCHINSON, K.vns., March 18.â The
Populists of Kansas neld an enthusiastic
convention here to-day and elected ninety
two delegates to the National convention
at St. Louis.
There was unusual interest attached to
this convention, for it was expected to out
line the policy of the Populist party in
reference to National politics in the com
ing campaign. The delegation will be
headed by ex-Governor Li6welling, John
i W. Breidenthal, chairman of the State
â  Central Committee, ex-Congressman Har
| ris and Judge Frank Foster as delegates-at
large.
The platform adopted demands the free
coinage of both gold and silver at a ralio
of 16 to 1, and, if necessary for the protec
tion of tue producing classes, the Govern
ment ownership of all public utilities.
The convention was attended by leading
Populists from other States, and it is un
derstood efforts will be made to unite with
the Independent Bimetallists at their St.
Louis convention upon a ticket, though
each convention may adopt its own plat
form. Taubeneck of Illinois and Mc-
Dowell of Tennessee are here pressing
that scheme.

this district, and where they were in doubt
about winning they put up contests, in the
hope that the National Committee's body

WASHINGTON, D. 0.. March 18.âSen
ator Allen, Representative Meikeljohn and
ex-Senator Manderson of Nebraska had a
conference to-day with Attorney-General
Harmon, Secretary Smith and Commis
sioner Lamoreaux of the Land Office in
regard to the pending suit of the United
States against the settlers upon 200,000
acres of lien or indemnity lands of ihe
Burlincton Railroad Company.
By the terms of the act of March 2 the
title of the railroad company to these lands
was confirmed, as were also the titles of all
bona-tide purchasers of railroad lands, and
the Nebraska gentlemen contended that
the question of good faith of the purchasers
could be determined by the Interior De
partment without suit, and the dismissal
of the proceedings in the Circuit Court for
Nebraska was Urged by them. Their rep
resentations favorably impressed the Gov
ernment officials and they expect that
within a few days the suits will be dis
missed. If that shall be done the same
course will doubtless be pursued toward
the settlers upon about 250,000 acres cfland
in lowa.

ate was a short debate upon the joint reso
lution directing the Secretary of the Inte
rior to execute the law for opening to set
tlement some 2,000,000 acres of land in the
eastern part of Utah, which had been part
of the Uncompahgre Indian reservation.
Severe strictures upon the Secretary of
the Interior for attempting to nullify the
act of Congress were made by Senators
Cannon of Utah, Wolcott of Colorado and
Vest of Missouri. The latter inveighed
with much vehemence against the Secre
tary, declaring that the time had been
when the head of a department would have
to answer at the bar of the Senate for such
an attempt to trample upon the legislative
branch of the Government.
Vest caused much amusement by his
witty and caustic criticism of President
Cleveland's recent speech before the Home
Missionary Society of New York.
The Dupont election case was taken up
after the morning hour and Thurston of
Nebraska made a three hours' speech in
advocacy of Dupont's right to the seat.
After passing numerosu bills, unobjected
to, the Senate at 5:55 o'clock adjourned
until to-morrow.
The joint resolution introduced yester
day by Cannon (R.) of Utah directing the
Secretary of the Interior to open to public
entry the Uncompahgre Indian reserva
tion in Utah, excepting the agricultural
lands allotted or selected for allotment to
the Uncompabgre Indian?, was taken up
and Cannon asked about its present condi
tion. The Secretary of the Interior, he de
clared, had not complied with the law aud
this joint resolution was to require him to
do so. He said that the existence of as
phalt in the reservation was as well known
when the act opening it to settlement was
passed as it was known now. The Secre
tary of the Interior, Cannon declared, had
never intended to have the reservation
opened to public entry and could not have
acted more in the interest of rich and
wealthy men and less in the interest of the
common people. The care of the Interior
Department was not how to do, but how
.not to do it.
Wolcott argued that the effect of the
passage of the joint resolution would be
not to give away the lands in question,
but to let them go where they belongedâ
to the settlers.
Vest (D.) of Missouri made a passionate
speech on the subject. He began with the
remark that there was a time when a Cab
inet officer who deliberately failed to exe
cute an act of Congress would be brought
before the bar of the Senate because he
had trampled upon the Legislative De
partment of the Government and had
violated his oath of office. He happened
to know the facts in regard to the matter.
Some years ago a company had been or
ganized in St. Louis for the purpose of
opening up certain asphalt deposits in the
Uncompahgre reservation, In the eastern
part of Utah, and invested a large
amount of money. Recent discoveries
had been made in Utah of the largest de
posits of asphalt in tne world. The St.
Louis company had not gone into the
reservation ; it had bought land outside,
and wagoned the product down to the
Union Pacific Railway, by which it was
sent to the different cities. The company
did not want the lands, because the
asphalt existed In such enormous quanti
ties that there could be no monopoly in it.
There was also. Vest said, a New York
asphalt corporption which came on the
scene last summer and which made some
adjustment with the St. Louis company.
The question was whether Coneress knew
what it was doing when it passed the act
to open up those lands. Congress did
know it and knew very well that there
were great asphalt deposits there. He
knew personally that in 1893 the Interior
Department was told as to the extent of
these deposits. He had gone himself with
the president of the St. Louis company to
the Secretary's office with specimens of the
asphalt and bad heard the statement made
to the Secretary in regard to those veins.
What sort of right, Vest demanded
angrily, had the Secretary of the Interior
to nullify that act of Congress? That
practice had grown up under it and de
manded the attention of Congress and at
once. The action of the Secretary of
Agriculture on the seed question was an
other instance of the same kind, and now,
said he, comes the Secretary of the In
terior and says that Congress did not
know anything about these enormous de
posits, and he takes the responsibility of
saying to the President of the United
States that the proclamation opening these
lands to settlement shall not be issued.
Here is a positive statute nullified by tne
head of a department with no other excuse
except the paltry one that he assumed that
Congress had not the information which it
has had for the last seven years.
"There seems," Vest continued, "to be a
disposition on the part of the administra
tion to treat the Western people as if they
were in a condition of pupilage, as if they
do not know their own rights or their own
interests, and as if they must be informed
ex-catheara from the East in reference as
to what is best for them, and what should
be done for them. Even the President of
the United States lately, on a missionary
occasion [laughter], spoke of the West as a
land of immorality and crime. He stood
with the lightâ the ghastly Jightâ of the
hellholes and rum-cellars of New York
blazing upon him, and cantingly said that
home missions must be used to civilize, to
Christianize the men who have leit their
homes in the civilized East and gone out
among the mountains and valleys of the
wild and woolly West. [Loud and general
laughter.]
"Our President stood with Dr. Talmage
on the one Bide, and the Rev Sheldon
Jackson on the other, and gave us a new
version of that beloved old missionary
hymn:
From Montana's sinful mountains.
From Utah's wicked plains,
They call us to deliver
Their land from Error's chains.
[Continued laughter.]
"We are told upon hish ecclesiastical
authority that his excellency has lately
laid down his honors at the feet of Jesus.
lam glad to know it. It has been the
general impression of Democrats that the
mugwumps and incense-burners had got
those honors and intended to keep them.
I have respect for the Christian religion
and for missions at home and abroad, but
this was a slander on the men who with
rifle in one hand and ax in the other have
gone out and blazed that pathway of civ
ilization in the Western wilds.
* "This, Mr. President, is what we have
come to at last, that the President of the
United States in his official capacity says
to the people of the whole world that in
one portion of this country the surround
ings are such that missionsâ home mis
sionsâare necessary in order to bring the
people to the proper knowledge of what is
right and true."
At this point the Vice- President asked
Vest to suspend his speech until a mes
sage should be received from the Presi
dent of the United States. Vest stopped
an the message was deliveredâ general
laughter being excited at the incidentâ
and when Vest continued he remarked
with assumed gravity that he would be
glad if the presiding officer would exam
ine tne message and see if it was in re
sponse to anything that had occurred in
tne Senate to-ctay.
Vilas (D.) of Wisconsin offered as an
amendment to Cannon's joint resolution
a proviso that any lands containing as
phalt or gilsenite, or line substance, shall
be reserved for further disposition by Con
gress. He went on to argue the matter,
suggesting that perhaps the Secretary of
the Interior did not know a certain fact.
"There is no fact," Wolcott (R.) of Colo
rado broke in, "that the incumbent of the
Interior Department does not consider he
knows." [Laughter.]
At another point Vilas suggested, in
connection with Vest's missionary re
marks, that he was not very certain that
the first missionary ought not to be sent
very near to the place where Senators were
now sitting.
At 2 p. m. the Vice- President announced
the unfinished business, which was a Sen
ate bill to approve a compromise and
settlement between the United States and
the State of Arkansas.
After some colloquy it was arranged that
the Arkansas bill should not be pressed
until after the Cuban resolutions and the
Dupont case were disposed of, and that it
should be succeeded as unfinished busi
ness by the joint resolution as to the Un
compahgre reservation.
The Dupont election case was then taken
up, and Thurston (R.) of Nebraska ad
dressed the Senate in an argument sup
porting Dupont's claim to the seat.
Thurston closed his speech at 5 p. m.,
and Chandler (R.) of New Hampshire took
the floor to speak on the same side of the
question.
The following bills were taken from the
calendar and passed: Senate bill for the
relief of settlers on the Northern Pacific
indemnity lands (allowing them to take
up quantities of land in Minnesota equal
to tne canceled patents); House bill for
the reconstruction of the Rock Island
bridge; House bill authorizing the Rock
Island, Muscatine and Southwest Railroad
Company to build a bridge across the Illi
nois and Mississippi Canal; Senate bill
to authorize the leasine of lands for edu
cational purposes in Arizona (reported in
place of a similar bill vetoed by the Presi
dent); Senate bill fixing the salary of the
Chief Justice of the Court of Claims at
$6500 and of the justices at $6000; Senate
bill granting a pension of $50 a month to
the widow of Brevet Major-General Sam A.
Duncan; Senate joint resolution for the
disposition of the real estate, rents, etc.,
now in the hands of the receiver of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints
(to be delivered to the presidency of the
church); Senate bill granting to the Slate
of California 5 per cent of the net proceeds
of the cash sales of public lands in that
State for school purposes, and Senate reso
lution authorizing the Committee on In
dian Affairs to continue investigations
during the recesses of Congress and to
visit the several Indian reservations.
After a short executive session the Sen
ate at 5:55 o'clock adjourned until to-mor
row.
NICARAGUA CANAL BILL
Text of the Measure Which Will
Be Reported to the
House.
The Governments to Be Protected by
Coming Into the Possession
of Stock.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 18.â The
sub-committee of the House Commerce
Committee, which has been engaged for
several weeks in the preparation of a
Nicaraguan canal bill, finished its labors to
day and will report to the full committee
on Friday next.
The bill agreed upon is substantially the
Mahon bill, witfrcertain amendments. It
provides for a reorganization of the Mari
time Canal Company. It permits the com
pany to issue bonds to the amount of $100,
--000,000, of which $7,000,000 shall be held by
the company to reimburse it for the money
actually expended in Nicaragua for their
franchise.
The United States guarantees the prin
cipal and interest of the bonds, which
latter shall be sold as needed to complete
the waterway. Tne United States is pro

sole property of the Government and
which is to be deposited in the United
States treasury at Washington. Ten of
the fifteen directors shall represent the
Government, the remaining fivs repre
senting the company and the republics of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
The bill requires the company to call in
and cancel all its outstanding obligations
except the bonds issued to the republics,
which aggregate $4,000,000 and $2,000,000
each, and which, under the new bill, they
will be permitted to retain.
All the bonds will bear interest at 3 per
cent per annum, the net earnings of the
canal to be placed in the sinking fund for
their extinguishment from time to time.
Additional security is given to the Gov
ernment by a first mortgage on the canal.
The work will be constructed under the
supervision of the War Department. The
bill reserves the right to the Govern ment to
purchase at it pleasure the $7,000,000 of
bonds held by that corporation.
A hearing will be given by the commit
tee to ex-Senator Warner Miller of New
York on Friday next.

ITS EGYPTIAN POLICY.
Declaration of the Minister Was
Not Intended as a
Threat.
ENGLAND CAN MAKE THE RAID
Use of the Reserve Fund the One
Bone of Contentionâ Germany
Will Not Interfere.
PARIS, France, March '18.â It is semi
officially declared that t tie utterances of M.
Berthelot, Minister of Foreign Affairs, re
garding the gravity of the consequences of
the British expedition to Dongola. do; not
possess the meaning attached to them.
They merely referred to the question of
using the reserve Egyptian fund for the
expedition. M. Berthelot will, it is said,
maKe a statement to that effect in the
Chamber of Deputies to-morrow.
Altogether France seems to be anxious
to remove the effect produced by the bul
letin embodying the substance of the
interview between M. Berthelot and the
British Embassador, Lord Dufferin. While
the Government wishes it understood that
France is closely interested in the matter,
it in no way desires to assume an attitude
of hostility toward England.
It was necessary that France should
clearly define her attitude at the outset,
and, in view of the friendly relations re
cently established with England, the Gov
ernment was of the opinion that the frank
language would be the most likely to pre
vent an} r possible misunderstanding that
might arise.
The Temps, in commenting upon the
matter, expresses similar views to the fore
going.
Concerning the British expedition to
Uongola, the Eclaire says that the inter
view between M. Bertheiot, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and the Marquis of
Bufferin. British Embassador, which took
place yesterday, proves that France is dis
posed to discourage a policy which does
nol show sufficient respect for the interests
of France in Egypt.
Besides, France has many other grounds
of objection to England's engaging in a
venture of advantage to herself, which is
not calculated to have a soothing effect
upon the various ministries.
FRASCO-RUSSIA.y IXTRIGUES.
Humored Attempt to IJÂ»tarh Italy From
the Dreihimd.
LONDON, Exu., March 18.â A dispatch
to the Pall Mall Gazette from Home says
that France and Russia are intriguing to
detach Italy from the Dreibund.
A dispatch to the Globe from Cairo
says . Curzon's statement in the Brit
ish House of Commons to-day in re-
garu to the Soudan expedition created a
great sensation, the gravity of the situa
tion being fully realized.
The consensus of opinion in Cairo is that
more troops are urgently required.
A dispatch from Cairo says that baggage
and stores are leaving daily for the British
expedition to Dongola. The Sixth Egyp
tian Battalion started to-day.
They were bidden a cordial farewell by
the Khedive, who exhorted the troops to
maintan the honor of their country. The
Khedive has lent to the expedition his
private camel corps and has also sent with
it several officers of his personal staff.
DEPUTIES Of A TUMULT.
Socialitta Cheer an Attack Upon King
Humbert.
EOME, Italy, March 18.â In the course
of the discussion in the Chamber of Depu
ties to-day of the statement made to the
Chamber by Premier di Rlidini yesterday,
Bignor Terri, Socialist, while delivering a
speech, made an allusion to the crown in
connection with the late Government's
African policy, whereupon the President
called dim to order.
Terri retorted by shouting that the
socialists were all anti-monarchists, which
elicited cheers from the socialists and cries
of dissent from the other groups. The
tumult was 80 groat as to prevent the con
tinuation of Terri's speech.
Ex-Premier Crispi was present. A pro
posal to send a message of salutation to
England was loudly applauded by the
Chamber despite the protests of Signor
Imbriani and other socialists.
AS ALARMING RUMOR.
B~he Italian Forces Relieved, to Have
Evacuated Kaasala.
LONDON, Exo.. March 18.- The Times
to- morrow will say there is reason to be
lieve that the Italian forces evacuated
Kassala on the 14th inst., and at
taches great importance to the evacua
tion, as it will entirely alter the
â¢whole situation for Italy and will be likely
to react seriously upon the position in
Egypt, to which government the danger
caused by the presence of victorious der
vishes at Kassaia would be instant and
very serious.
Germany Will Xot Interfere.
BERLIN, Germany, March 18.â It is
officially stated that Germany having
lenrned ihat the British proposal to use a
portion of the reserve Egyptian fund for
ihe Dongola expedition is accented by the
other governments, the Dreibund has
instructed the German Commissioner of
the Public Debt at Cairo accordingly.

SPOKANE, Wash., March 18.â The in
corporation of the town of Hillyard was
to-day declared by a court to be illegal.
The defendants came into court and con-
fessed judgment to the petition of plain
tiffs.
This is the outcome of the demand of J.
J. Hill, president of the Great Northern

\inless his order was obeyed. Hillyard is a
suburb of Spokane, and without the shops
the property there would be valueless.
As his demands have been complied with,
the shops will no doubt remain.

NEZ PERCES WANT MONEY
Chief Showaway Will Be Sent
to Washington to Demand
Justice.
Gold Due the Umatilla Tribes Has
Not Been Paid by the Great
White Father.
PENDLETON, Or., March 18. â Paul
Sbowaway, rightful chief of the Cayuse tribe
of Indians on the Umatilla Reservation,
has returned from a visit- to the Nez Perces
on the Lapwai Reservation. Showaway
says the Nez Perces are very much in
censed on account of the long delay in
paying them the money due them, and
they think of sending another delegation
to Washington to plead with the Govern
ment officials to arrange for a prompt pay
ment. In the recent payment the Nez
Perces each received $28 interest money,
about $50,000 being distributed among 1700
of them. There remains to their credit in
the treasury at Washington about $150,000,
which the} 1 want and insist on having.
Showaway also says the Umatilla Reser
vation tribes will send a representative to
Washington to demand the money due
them on account of the sale of their lands
several years ago. In the treasury at
Washington there is no less than $250,000
belonging to the three tribes of the Uma
tilla Reservation â the Uma tillas, the
Cay uses and the Walla Wallas. This
money has been repeatedly demanded.
LaÃt summer Chief Peo of the Umatillas
and Chief No Shirt of the Walla Wallas,
accompanied by an interpreter John Mc-
Bean, visited the National capital and re
quested the payment of the money due
the tribes, but "no heed has been paid to
their demands, and now Showaway will be
sent on to Washington with a similar mis
sion. He will be accompanied by a white
man.
Showaway speafcs English fluently and
needs no interpreter. Showaway can maks
a good showing and will have influence
wherever he goes.
STANFORD VS. BERKELEY.
Intercollegiate Field Meet to Occur in San
Francisco â Tour of the Mandolin
and Glee Clubs.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.,
March 18. â The managers and captains of
the track teams of Berkeley and Stanford
met here to-day and decided to hold the
next intercollegiate field meet in San
Francisco instead of here at the university
track and grounds, as previously an
nounced. The date for the meet was fixed
at April 25, which leaves a little over a
month for the completion of the athletic
training. The universities will share the
expenses equally, and to cover the travel
ing expenses of each of the men Stanford
will be allowed $2 for each entry and
Berkeley 30 cents.
The events will occur in the regular In
tercollegiate Athletic Association order,
with the exception of the bicycle races.
Instead of the regular I. A. A. bicycle
races one two-mile race will be run as a
part of the list of events and to count as
heretofore. The arrangement seems to be
generally satisfactory here, though it was
hoped the meet might be held here on the
campus.
The baseball men will play a match
game with the Santa Clara College nine
to-morrow. The latter is a strong aggre
gation, and two weeks ago defeated the
Varsity by a score of 6 to 5.
The Glee and Mandolin clubs leave the
campus to-morrow on a 2000-mile tour
through the State. The itinerary in
cludes most of the cities of California, and
the clubs will not return before April 1.
Incendiary Blaze at Vinehill.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., March 18.â An
incendiary fire occurred at the Jarvis vine
yard in Vinehill at 2:30 o'clock this morn
ing. The winery and distiller}- aiid their
valuable contents of wine, machinery and
the implements used in making wine were
destroyed. The loss, at its lowest estimate,
will be $10,000. The buildings were not
Insured to near their value, so the Jarvises
will lose many thousands of dollars by the
fife.

IN A CARSON
JURY'S HANDS.
The Fate of John T. Jones
Still Hangs in the
Balance.
ARE UNABLE TO AGREE.
General Belief That the Twelve
Judges Will Fail to Reach
a Verdict.
CLARKE'S CLOSING ADDRESS.
Caustic Arraignment of the Suspect
by the Government's
Counsel.
CARSON, Nev., March 19.â The fate of
John T. Jones, the alleged accomplice of
James Heney in the theft of bullion to the
value of |23,000 from the Government
mint in this city, is now in the hands of a
jury. The twelve men have since noon
been attempting to arrive at a verdict un
successfully, and after midnight tbey re
solved to rest Irom their labors until day
light. It is the general opinion that a dis
agreement will result.
The argument to the jury this morning
closed with a masterly speech by General
Clarke, in which he forged the chain of
evidence link by link about the accused
with pitiless precision. Referring to the
claim by the defense that Hirsch Harris
made the bogus melt in March, he read
Harris' letter to the superintendent of the
mint, written a month earlier, in which he
reported the shortage and asked that the
Government experts investigate it.
He read a certified copy of Jones' bank
account, showing deposits apgregating
$60,000, which he had accumulated in two
years on $100 a month salary, and dilated
on the fact that Jones had been unable to
show where he made even a dollar outside
of his salary. The claim made by Jones
that he had won a fortune through John
Kelly in the Con. Virginia deal was dis
posed of as follows:
"Captain John Kelly was a prominent
operator in Virginia City â a careful, cun
ning and secret operator â and George ives
was his executor, his confidential man,
who did his business. John Kelly was
dead, and we could not raise him from his
grave to contradict the evidence. So Jones
goes to San Francisco and trie 3to persuade
Ives that he had some transactions with
Kelly, but Ives said there were no such
transactions.
"He said his attorney, Coffin, would also
call, and Coffin called, but could get no
evidence to help his client. Yet Jones in
sisted that he had dealt through Kelly.
Now, these people overlooked the fact that
Kelly was taken sick in February, 1890,
and died in January, 1891, before the Con.
Virginia deal, in which Jones claimed to
have made his money, so the little job was
nipped in the bud and went down like the
other jobs these people have fabricated to
explain the theft of that money."
WILLIAMS' SEATTLE BROTHER.
Relatives of the Alleged Transvaal Con
spirator Will Not Petition for Govern-
ment Interference.
SEATTLE, Wabh., March 18.â Gardner
T. Williams, the California mining en
gineer, who is under arrest in South Africa
for having, as alleged, been engaged in a
conspiracy against the Transvaal Govern
ment, has a younger brother, Robert N.
Williams, residing in this city. In a busi
ness way the latter is connected with the
Del Monte Mining Company of California.
"Do you know," Mr. Williams said when
interviewed to-day regarding his brother
Gardner, "that to-day my brother was to
leave for the United States and I was to
meet him in California some time in May?
His arrest, however, will cause him to
postpone his trip for a short time. We do
not fear that there will be any trouble in
securing his acquittal of the charges made
against him. He treats them lightly. I
had a cablegram from him during the
pa^t week and he said that the charges did
not amount to anything. It looks as
though he knows what he is talking about,
for to-day Mrs. Williams and the children
leave Capetown for Germany, where they
will remain for some time. If GardneV
feared trouble it is not likely that he
would send his wife and family to Ger
many.
"I want to say this, however. If he is
guilty, he will lake his medicine like a
man. There will be no quibbling about it.
His relativps in the United States will not
try to stir up sympathy for him, and ap
peal to the Government for protection for
him. A man who violates the law in the
country in which he lives deserves no pity,
no consideration, and I say airain that if
he is guilty, he will take his medicine like
a man.
"This trouble about Hammond, who
was arrested down there after the Jameson
raid, is all bosh. If Hammond is guilty 'â 
why should he not be punished? If he is
innocent he has nothing to fear. What
right has the United States to step in and
say that its subjects shall not be punished ;
when they have violated the laws of an
other country? If he is innocent, and is
imprisoned, then it is time enough to in
terfere. What would we say if a subject
of South Africa was to come to' the United
States and violate the law of the country? i
Why, we would say 'Punish him,' and we
would tell President Kruger, if he inter
fered, to mind his own business.
"The. last letter I had from Gardner was
sent soon after the Jameson raid. He was
'all broke up' about it. Jameson was his
intimate friend and family physician."
ASfIIOUS AT SAM DIEGO.

Ilun Down the Coast.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., March 18.â The coast
defense monitor Monadnock, which has
just been put into service and is now on its
first ocean trip, anchored in San Diego
Bay this afternoon The Monadnock arrived
outside this forenoon and was boarded by
Pilot Dunnels. It was brought inside and
at 1 o'clock was anchored opposite the ma

and says it is a most valuable addition to
the Pacific Coast defenses.

POLITICS ON THE COAST
The. Republicans of Butte County
Will Insist Upon Open
Primaries.
Apportionment for the Sixth District
Conventionâ The Los Gatos
Campaign.
CHICO, Cal., March 18,â The following
call was issued here to day:
To the Republican Voters of Butte County :
You are earnestly requested to be present at a
mass-meeting of Republicans next Saturday
night, March 21, at the City Hall m Chico, for
the purpose oi taking some action relative to
the manner of selecting delegates to the State
Convention.
The proposition of the Congressional com
mittee, which meets in Sacramento next Mon
day, is to leave the appointment of delegates
in the hands of the members of the Congres
sional committee or the County Central Com
mittee. Unless some expression of feeling
against such a course is sent from this county
one of the above propositions will prevail.
Do you want two or three men to say who
shall go as delegates from Butte County, or do
you believe in allowing the voters to name the
delegates in open primaries? If no expression
one way or the other is made by Republicans
from this county the Congressional committee
will conclude that the people are satisfied with
placing the appointments in thÂ« hands of the
County Committee.
Take notice of the time and place of.xneeting.
Let representative Republicans from the sur
rounding towns be present, that the desire for
open primaries may go from this county as a
unanimous expression. Tnose Republicans
who cannot attend from far-off towns in tne
county sliould call mass-meetings of their own
and protest against placing the power of ap
pointment in the hands of a few men. Let us
act, and act quickly, that the espressicn may
be made before it is too late. This is a serious
matter, and the Republicans of Butte uounty
should rise en masse and demand that the one
man power be put aside and that the people
have the privilege of naming their choice of
delegates by vote. Adopt strong resolutions
demanding [hat primaries be opened in this
county, and give every Republican voter a
chance to vote for the man of his choice.

Sherry Odare Returned to Stand
Trial for Robbing His
Wife.
TOOK HER HONEY AND PLED.
Sensational Ending of a Brief Honey
moonâRedlands' Four Hundred
Shocked.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 18.â Sherry
Odare, a young Englishman who has
been cutting quite a dash at Redlands and
other Southern California towns as a
scion of British nobility, was arrested this
afternoon on board a train at Barstow, and
is now on the way back to this city to
answer to a charge of grand larceny.
Odare recently married a young woman
named Katie Moore, and the couple were
spending their honeymoon in this city.
Mrs. Odare had but. a short acquaintance
with her husband, but she trusted Him so
implicitly that in a burst of confidence she
told him last evening that she had $285
sewed up in a skirt, and she intended to
put it into a bank to-day.
Odare seemed pleased to learn of this
evidence of thrift on the past of his better
half, whom he had regarded as a dower
less bride and married solely for her good
looks and winning ways. He arose bright
and early this morning on a pretext or
having important business to attend to.
When Mr.'. Odare arose an hour or two
later she was astonished to find that her
skirt had been ripped open and the money
abstracted. The horrible suspicion flashed
through her brain that her husband had
robbed her and fled. She started an in
vestigation and her worst fears were con
firmed when she learned that Odare had
purchased a ticket for the East, via the
Santa Fe road.
Such was the tale of woe Mrs. Odare
related to the District Attorney this after
noon and that official issued a complaint
and the warrant was telegraphed to Bar
stow, where the train was intercepted and
the culprit taken off. A Deputy Sheriff
left for Barstow this evening to bring the
prisoner back.
CITI OFFICIALS ATTACK HO.
Scored Urea us* They RidÂ« on Faaie* in
Streetcar*.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., March 18.â C.
Severance has tiled several communica
tions recently severely scoring the City
Council. He to-day filed another ' docu
ment, in which he says: ,
"Men who pose as the guardians of pub
lic morals should have clean hands and
clean records. The pas? on which you,
gentlemen, have been charged with rid
ing has printed upon it in conspicuous
letters the c c words: 'Not to be shown any
person.' Why not to be shown ? Because
it is a badge of infamy and evidence of un
faithfulness, and a Councilman who
would accept and use such a pass reveals i
at once that 5 centsâ that insignificant
I nickelâ is more highly valued than his
honor and his regard for State laws."
Severance declares that it . made . his
blood boil to think that such men have
the temporary power to put in the chain
gang and imprison in a lousy and ill
ventilated jail their fellowmen, whose
only crime is poverty that compels them
to sleep in a* haystack or freight car. ? In
the face of these tilings, Severance is not
| surprised that "anarchy is raising its head
in these United States." .* After explaining
why street laborers do not ride on passes,
Severance says: "Having seen so much
complaint in the daily papers regarding the
bad condition of our streets, along certain
j lines of car track, I am led to ask, though
! the charge of , impertinency may attend
the query in your opinion, if there is any
esoteric connection between your 5-cent
passes and the dilapidated condition of
some parts of our streets?"
BEXXETT HELD *OR MUJtDER.
The Wheelman Must Answer for the
Killing of Czaraki.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., March 18.â Elisha
(alias "Jim") Bennett, who fatally stabbed
Fred Czarski, a saloon-keeper, ten days
ago, was held to answer to a charge of
murder at his preliminary examination
to-day. Bennett, accompanied by W. A.
Burke and Casey Castleman, two well
known bicycle-riders, was in Czarski's
saloon. The barkeeper, Czarski's brother
in-law, jested Bennett about cycling. The
latter became angry and used vile lan
guage in the presence of Mrs. Czarski, who
was also in the saloon.
Czarski took up the quarrel and knocked
: Bennett down. On regaining his feet
j Bennett drew a knife and stabbed Czarski
I in the abdomen, inflicting a wound from
I which be died a few days later. Burke
: and Casileman left the saloon before the
stabbing occurred, and were not impli
! cated in the row.
E. J. McDowell, Czarski's brother-in
' law; Mrs. Loretta Czarski, widow of the
j deceased, ami Paul Flammer, one of the
â  officers who arrested Cyclist Bennett, tes
i titied for the prosecution this morning at
| the examination. Mrs. Czarski and Mc-
Dowell gave a version of the stabbing that
differed from t:;at given by Casey Castle
nian. Their narrative, however, tended to
show that Czarski first assaulted Bennett,
after being provoked by an epithet from
tne latter, and that after a bnef struggle
j Bennett deliberately walked over and
\ stabbed the saloon man as he stood against
I the bar.

SALT LAKE-OGDJSJf Ll\Â£.
Southern Pacific Believed to Be Back of
n Xetv Venture.
OGDEN, Utah. March 18.â The organ
ization of the Salt Lake and Ogden Rail
road Company, which will build a road
from Ogden to Salt Lake City, .was an
nounced to-day. Reports conflict as to
who is at the back of the enterprise.
Simon Baniberger of Salt Lake, one of the
incorporators, said that the Pioneer Elec
tric Power Company of Ogden, which re
cently floated $1,500,000 bonds, was push
ing the matter and that it would be an
electric road. The incorporators include
C. K. Bannister, secretary of the power
company. He stated to* a Call corre
spondent that he knew notning further
of the enterprise than that he had sub
scribed for one share of stock, but that it
would probably be an electric road. He
denied that thu power company had any
interest in the matter.
Bcmberger recently returned from atrip
to San Francisco, ana the general opinion
here is that tne Southern Pacific "is the
"nigger in the woodpile," and that it
wants a direct connection with Salt Lake.
DEATH OF AMOS ADAMS.

SAN JOSE, Cal., March 18.â Amos

MILL VALLEY'S PROTEST
Fighting to Keep the Scenic
Railway Off the Main
Streets.
Work on the Road Continued
Despite the Objections of
Land-Owners.
MILL VALLEY, Cal., March 18.â The
Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic
Railroad is completing the construction of
the electric road to Eastland station de
spite the objections and hindrances of
the property-owners and residents of Mill
Valley. To-day a Jarge force of men was
put to work grading Corte Madera avenue.
No resistance was made by the property
owners on the avenue and the men con
tinued their work unmolested.
J. H. Mclnnes has sold a right-of-way
through his property to the company and
taKen in payment for the privileges
granted the railroad stock in the corpor
ation and money.
Yesterday the secretary of the road was
served with a notice by P. S. Furgeson to
the effect that he would hold the Mill Val
ley and Mount Tamalpais Scenic Railroad
Company responsible for any damages sus
tained by him by reason of the scenic road
running on the avenue in front of his
property. Mr. Furge3on is also prepared
to take the necessary legal steps to protect
his interests.
The whole trouble about the mountain
road coming into Mill Valley arises ov\?r
the question of whether or not the people
of Mill Valley or the Tamalpais Water
Company owns the highways at this
place. The people claim to possess them,
as the roads have been open to public
travel for over five years, although the
Tamalpais Land and \Vater Company has
gone to the expense of keeping them in
good condition for this period. The deeds
under which the property is sold give the
purchaser all the privileges for which
loads are usually built.
In its turn the Tamalpais Land and
Water Company, which is the backbone of
the mountain road project, claims to re
tain the title in the streets by virtue of
the deeds and because the roads have never
been dedicated to public use or maintained
and kept in proper repair by the people.
Acting on the advice of its attorney the
Scenic Railroad Company ran its line upon
Corte Madera avenue without securing the
assent of the people and relying solely
upon the contention of the land company
that it owned the streets.
According to ttie first survey the track
on Corte Madera avenue was brought
within two feet of the sidewalk in front of
George Anker's and J. H. Mclnnes' places.
The latter gentleman promptly served an
order upon the railroad company that-he
would not allow it to run so near his side
walk as it would depreciate the value of his
property. A new survey was ordered,
with the result that it was found necessary
to buy a right ot way through the landsof
J. H. Mclnnes, and this has been done,
but the remaining property-owners on
Corte Madera avenue have come to the
conclusion that the road running upon
that avenue will greatly injure them and
In consequence notices have been served by
them upon the officers of the road stating
that they intend to get damages.

EXPLORING TRIP.
Search for a Hidden Valley
Among the Mountain
Peaks.
TWICE SEEN BY MAN.
First Discoverers of the Mimic
Paradise Unable to Find
It Again.
NESTLES AMONG PRECIPICES,
A Fertile Garden-Spot Which Hai
Been Described in Delightful
Legends.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., March 18.â
For many years a delightful legend has
been current among the Spanish- Ameri-
can population of Santa Barbara, to the
effect that in the midst of the great wilder
ness of mountains lyinc back of this valley
there existed a fertile valley several miles
in extent, but wl;ich was cutoff by lofty
and inaccessible peaks which completely
encircled it. Now an attempt is to be
made to locate this hidden valleyâ an at
tempt that will not be given up until a
most thorough starch has been made.
The story goes that on one occasion a
party of men looked down upon it from
the mountain summit, and although they
could tind no trail leading down into it,
contrive.! to fight their way through thick*
ets of chaparral and lower themselves past
precipitous rocks until they stood in this
mimic paradise, wholly isolated from set
tlement or travel and before untrodden by
man. A crystal stream coursed through
the valley, escaping in a waterfall which
tney were unable to pas 3; so they were
forced to retrace their steps over the peril
ous way by which they had come. When
they attempted to return to the valley
they could not find it, and although they
made many attempts to reach it again,
every peak that they climbed frowned
down upon the same rugged and barren
waste of mountains. The "Lost Potrero,"
as it has commonly been called, has passed
into the history of the county as a roman
tic tradition.
A party of Americans hunting through
the ranges back of the Santa Ynez last
year claim to have again come upon thia
wonderful valley, but when they returned
to their homes and again set out prepared
to thoroughly explore it and perhaps take
Government entries they were unable to
tind it.
Such faith have they in the valley's
actual existence that this week a party of
young men will set out for this place, pre
pared for a two months' trip and deter
mined to looate the garden spot. They as
sert they will climb a hundred of the high
est peaks they can find before resigning
their quest, and as all are good mountain
| eers and Lardy travelers the result of their
| enterprise will be awaited with interest by
| the skeptics they leave behind.

that Mrs. Ord gave bonds in the sum of
$1000 as security for the payment of bills
contracted by R. N.Watson, her son-in
law. Watson is doing a retail butcher
business in Carpinteria and he now re
fuses to pay debts aggregating over $3000.
Mrs. Ord is an elderly lady and an invalid,
who in a fit of epilepsy last spring upset a
kerosene lamp and was badly burned^ As
this bond is dated subsequent to thoss in
juries payment will probably be contested
on the grounds that she wad incompetent
to make such a contract.
BUXKO MEN AT AXGELB CAMP.
Superintendent Routledge of th* .Pur*
Quill Mine Duped.
STOCKTON, Cal.. March 18. âThe polic*
here have been notified by Harry Rout
ledge, superintendent and part owner of
of the Pure Quill mine, Angels Camp, that
an attempt was made to bunko him
and his partners out of the mine.
Two men, giving their names as A. W.
St. Clair and Frank Worsley, went to
Angels Camp a short time ago and repre
sented themselves as wealthy Englishmen.
They said they had just purchased a mine
in Colorado for $40,000, and offered to buy
the Pure Quill. The offer was accepted
and the papers drawn up. They came
here on Sunday to meet a man who, they
said, would come from San Jose with
$12,000, the first installment of the pur
chase price.
The two men borrowed money from
Routledge, who also paid their expenses
during their stay at Angels. In the night
the men decamped, taking the papers and
specimens of ore and without paying what
they had borrowed. It is thought that
they may attempt to alter the papers and
sell the mine on the strength of the speci
mens, and so bunko some one else.

STEEVES BACK IN
PORTLAND'S JAIL
Bondsmen Surrender the
Lawyer Convicted of
Murder.
RETURNED TO PRISON.
A Brother of the Late W. 0.
Allen Precipitates the
Action.
MOVES IN A STRANGE CASE.
Deserted by a Relative of the Man
Alleged to Have Paid for His
Defense.
PORTLAND, Or., March 18.â The bonds
men of Lawyer Xenophon N. Steeves sur
rendered him to the authorities to-day,
and he was compelled to return to jail
after over a year's liberty. Steeves was
convicted of complicity in the murder of
George W. Sayres, who was killed on
Rocky Point in September, 1894, by the
hired assassin, "Bunko" Kelly, whoisnow
serving a life sentence for the crime. One
of Steeves' bondsmen was W. O. Allen, the
alleged instigator of the crime, who com
mitted suicide some time ago. As stated
in a dispatch to The Call, sevsral days
ago, evidence has just come to light which
tends to prove that Allen supplied $20,000
to carry on the defense of Kelly ana
Steeves. Since his conviction the lawyer
had been out on bail, pending an appeal.
The lawyer's sureties had announced
their unwillingness to longer be responsi
ble for Steeves' aDpearance in court, and
consequently the authorities lost no time
in taking charge of him. The move was
unlooked for and created great surprise.
It was about 11 o'clock when Sheriff bears,
with a warrant in his pocket, was getting
ready to go downtown to look for his man.
In the corridors of the Courthouse he met
Steeves, who was idly walking around, oc
casionally speaking to an acquaintance. He
seemed not to have the remotest idea that
he was about to be returned to prison.
"Well, Steeves," the Sheriff said, "I'll
have to take you again. They want you."
Steeves was astonished. "What's the
matter; what do you mean?" he asked
quickly.
"Your bondsmen have surrendered you.
I unders-tand.' 1
"What's that? Surrendered me? Great
Scott, I never dreamed of leaving here!"
Presently lje added : "Why I cannot be
lieve it. Mrs. Mason surely did not ob
ject to remaining ray surety."
Steeves readily consented to go with the
Sheriff. As soon as he expressed a wish
to make an effort to secure a bondsman,
Deputy Sheriff Meyer went with Steeves.
When some of his friends heard of it the
remark was made: "There is some curious
work going on here."
It is said the determination of Adminis
trator Allen of the W. 0. Allen estate to
surrender Steeves was made known to the
District Attorney this morning. The ex
ecutor is a brother of W. 0. Allen, de
ceased, and refuses to longer allow Allen's
name to remain on ths bond. When
Steeves wae convicted of manslaughter, he
furnished bonds for his appearance in the
sum of $10,000. Mrs. 0. P. Mason, wife of
the lawyer, and W. 0. Allen, the backer of
Sleeves, Kelly etal., qualified as the bonds
men, and after a sharp tight in court over
the statutory questions involved, Steeves
was released, after about three or four
months' confinement.
When Allen died last fall Steeves nar
rowly escaped going to jail, because the
District Attorney wanted the court to pass
upon the question as to whether, in the
event of Steeves' non-appearance, his es
tate would be responsible for the payment
of the bond. Late th is evening he had not
succeeded in furnishing a new bond.
EXPIRES OS JL STREET.
Sudden Patting of Ex- Collector of Cut-
toma Abraham-
PORTLAND, Or. March 18.âEx-Col
lector of Customs Hyman Abraham, one
of the best-known men in this State, while
walking along Third street this afternoon
at 1 o'clock fell dead in front of the Lane-
Davis Company's drugstore. He had just
come from a doctor's office near by, where
he obtained a prescription. After he
reached the sidewalk he began to stagger.
About that time Anthony Noltner, an old
iriend of Abraham's, came along and asked
what troubled him.
"I don't Know," was the reply. "I am
eick and just came from the doctor's office.
I guess I'll go back."
Noltner was supporting Abraham while
he spoke, and no sooner had he expressed
himself as wishing to return to his doctor's
office than he whirled about and fell a
corpse upon the sidewalk.
CAPTURED NEAR FRESNO
Officers Arrest a Member of the
"Forty Thieves of
Tulare."
Accused of Robbing Sheepherders
Near Selma â Betrayed by a
Confederate.
FRESNO, Cal,, March 18.â E. M. Jef
fenis was lodged in the County Jail to
day by Constable Spencer of Selma and
Deputy Constable Crutcher of this city on
a charge of robbery. The arrest was made
on 3 ranch twenty miles southeast of
Fresno, where Jefferds had been kept in
hiding.
Jefferds was a member of the famous
"Band of Forty Thieves" Of Tulare and
Kings oounties, which has recently been
broken up by officers after haying carried
on depredations for several years. Jefferds
finished serving a sentence for petty lar
ceny in the Hanford jail a few months
Â»Â£O. The charge on which he was arrested
to-day is that of robbing some Portuguese
sheenherders near Seima last June. Joe
Miduleton, ex-leader of the famous band,
is already in jail on the same charge. A
young- man named Barlow, who was a
participaat in the robnery of the Portu
guese, has turned State's evidence, and
Bence the arrest of Middleton and Jefferds.
Jefferd* is regarded as a desperate char
octÂ«r, and the officers who made the arrest
to-day went prepared for warfare. They
to<>k their man unawares, however, and
although he had a rifle in his hand at the
time he was given no opportunity to use it.
Sealer* Matte Few Catches.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 18.â Reports
just received from the sealers scattered
along the coast from off the Colum

the coast catches for this year will
be on the whole very small, the aver
age of those heard from to date being
less than fifty skins. The weather for
hunting has been all that could be desired,
but the seals are very scarce. The schooner
Minnie of this port 'heads the list, having
secured 123 skins. These have arrived
here, knd will form the first consignment
of 1X96 skins forwarded to the English

food and told a pitiful tale of hard times
and hunger. Yet it transpired that when
he was arrested he had stowed away in odd
and ample pockets three loves 6f bread
and a chunk of cheese, besides other eat
ables.
PBESIDENT AND CABINET.
General Harrison Describes the Duties
of the Chief Kxecntive's Advisers.
"In all important matters the President
is consulted by all the Secrataries," writes
ex-President Harrison in March Ladies'
Home Journal, in an article upon "The
President's Duties." "He is responsible
for all executive action, and everything
that is out of the routine receives his at
tention. Every important foreien compli
cation is usually discussed with him, and
the diplomatic note receives his approval.
The same thing is true of each of the de
partments. Routine matters proceed with
out the knowledge or interference of i
the President; but, if any matter of
major importance arises the secretary
presents it for the consideration and
advice of the President. Only mat
ters of great and general importance
affecting the general policy of the admin
istration are discussed ie the Cabinet meet
ings â according to my experienceâ and
votes are of rare occurrence. Any Secre
tary desiring to have an expression upon
any question in his department presents
it and it is discussed; but usually ques
tions are settled in a conference between
the President and the head of the particu
lar department. There is a yielding of
views, now on one side, now on the
other; but it must, of course, follow
Uiat when the President has views that
he feels that he cannot yield, those
views must prevail, for the responsibil
ity is his, both in a constitutional and
popular sense. My habit was to give an
afternoon to each Cabinet officer on a fixed
day of the week. These meetings were
chiefly g'ven up to the consideration of
appointments, but if any other matters
were pending and deemed by the Secre
tary of sufficient importance they were
presented and discussed. The labors of a
Cabinet officer, are incessant and full of
! responsibility. His fime is largely taken
i up with ca)ls, and, like the Presdent, he
must, out of some fragments of time as he
can secure, manage to study and decide
the important questions that are daily
presented to isim. Certain appointments,
chiefly of a clerical character, are by law
given to the heads of the departments and
with these the President usually refuses to
! interfere, though often urged to do so. It
was ray practice to refuse jo send any card
of recommendation to the Secretary,
i though I spent many a weary hour cx
i plaining to friends why I could not do so."
War Is Urowing Safer.
It is usual to compare the battles of the
last century with the battles of to-day, and
dilate upon the greater deadliness of the
modern weapons and the modern results.
But the facts are all the other way. At
Fontenoy, for instance, one volley of the
Coldstreams struck down 450 Frenchmen
of the Regiment dv Roi. Again, at the
same battle, the Gardes dv Corps had not
much short of 500 saddles emptied by a
single volley, while the French Guards
i were scattered by a point-blank volley
I from a British regiment at twenty paces
I that brought down 450 men. Here we
! have at Krugersdorp thousands of Boers
| in cover shooting for hours on two days at
j 600 Englishmen in the open' and killing
j very few.â Saturday Review.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
BIG BLUE IN
BURKE MINES
Mills and Tramways of the
Poorman and the Tiger
Burned.
GREAT LOSS RESULTS
Operations in the Two Proper
ties Cannot Be Resumed
Within Six Months.
NEW MACHINERY DESTROYED.
Hundreds of Workmen in Enforced
Idlenessâ Fears That the Shafts
Will Be Flooded.
SPOKANE, Wash., March 18.â A special
from Burke, Idaho, says that the mills and
tramways of the Foorman and Tiger mines
have been burned, but the large hotel con
nected with the mines saved. The lire
started at an early hour thjs morning in
the compressor of the Poorman mine. It
gained great headway and attention was
immediately turned to the adjoining build
ings. The efforts of many men could not
prevent the tire from gaining headway on
the tramway, from which it was com
municated to the mill of the Tiger mine
across the gulch.
When it was seen that neither of the
large buildings could be saved, attention
was turned to the little town. This by the
greatest efforts was saved.
The total loss will be about $200,000, with
insurance at 75 per cent. A large amount
of new machinery wa3 placed in the Tiger
mill only a few days ago, and this, it is
said, was not covered by insurance.
Efforts are being made to run the pumps
of the Poorman and keep the mine from
flooding. If this cannot be done the com
pany will suffer great loss. Operations
will have to be suspended for fully six
mÂ«nths belore the property can again be
worked.
The Tiger mine is owned principally by
S. S. Glidden and the Poorman by Patsy
Clarke, both of this city. The mines are
the best-paying properties in the Coenr
d'Alenes. and the loss by having to close
down will fall heavily on the owners, and
hundreds of workmen will become idle.
A BAMPAGING ELEPHANT.
lt Swept Away Cages t Chains, fences
and Trees Like a Cyclone.
Broken fences and uprooted saplings in
the zoological garden mark where Queen,
the elephant who has been in winter quar
ters, went out on a rampace. Superin
tendent Sol Stephan is nursing a sprained
ankle, several keepers are suffering with
minor bruises, and "Jack" Robinson be-
moans the demolition of a fine buggy, and
Qaeen still holds the fort. The trouble
arose in the attempt to move the elephant
to Mr. Robinson's stables at Terrace Park.
Monday afternoon Mr. Robinson pur
chased all the animal's belonging to the
United Printing Company, which have
been in winter quarters at the Zoo. The
lot comprised two lions, two panthers, one
leopard, one hyena, one sacred bull, four
monkeys and the elephant called Queen.
He arrived with his men and wagons at
the garden and no difficulty was experi
enced in getting them loaded and on their
way to their destination. Queen was left
to the last, and in anticipation of trouble
the animal was hobbled, a procedure
which cons st? In running stout chains
around the iorelegs of sufficient lengths to
allow only an ordinary stride. In addition
to this a thick rope about sixty feet In
length was attached to one of her foreless,
at the other end of which a dozen keepers
had a firm hold.
The journey from the shed past the res
taurant was uneventful. Jack Robinson
in his buggy was bringing up the rear
when suddenly, as if ths animal for the
first time understood that she was to be
removed from her cuzy quarters and the
companionship of Hadne and Little
Tommy, the two other elephants, Queen
turned. By a dexterous pull on the Ones
Mr. Robinson managed to get out of
Harm's way. Superintendent Stephan,
with a pitchfork in his hands, tried to stop
the maddened animal. Two keepers
drove the heavy iron prongs used to sub
due elephants into each ear. The men at
the rope tugged and braced themselves
for a pull. Like pigmies Queen swept
them aside. The prongs of the fork en
tered her trunk, but with a twist she
broke them off.
With a shake of her huge head she
tossed to the srround the men who held
the prods, and those that ciung to the
rope she dragged alone until they were
glad to release their hold. Then, with a
snort of rage, she drove her head to the
fence, pushing the boards aside like reeds.
Another plunge, and she broke through
the aviary containing the golden pheas
ants, tearing down the heavy wire netting
like cobwebs and. giving the bright
plumaged occupants their freedom. Clear
ing the road at a run, she pulled down
another aviary, and made her way toward
the restaurant.
Just as all thought that the huge beast
was about to launch itself against the
glass doors. Hadne. in the building below,
sent out a cry. Queen heard it, ana
trotted leisurely toward the winter quar
ters. Ths doors were closed, but Queen
used her head as a ram, and locks and bars
gave way. With another blow of her
trunk she broke down the slight barrier
between her and Little Tommy, and when
the keeper came up shortly afterward she
was contentedly munching hay beside her
diminutive companion.
Mr. Robinson, however, was determined
not to be outwitted, by an elephant, and
under bis direction additional chains were
procured, with which Queen was once
more londed. When everything was in
readiness she was taken out the rear door
and in a different direction toward Avon
dale. By dint of blows and shortened
chains, which made progress slow, they
managed to drive the animal a distance of
about five squares from tte garden. Five
times Queen turned, but a convenient tree,
about which the men had thrown the rope,
stopped her retreat.
When Wilson avenue was reached the
trees gave out, and Queen seemed to know
that her time had come. In a twinkling
she snapped her chains. With a kick she
sent Superintendent Stephan sprawline.
A whirl of her foreleg and the men who
clung to the rope flew in every direction.
Then, lifting her trunk on high and utter
ing a cry of defiance, she began a lumber
ing jog-trot back to the garden. A fence
was once more in her path, but she went
through it without flinching. Some young
saplings stood in the way, and she up
rooted them rather than turn aside. In a
short time she was back again with Little
Tommy as contented as before, and it was
deemed advisable to postpone her removal
for a few days r.t least.
When Mr. Robertson returned for his
bugpy, which he had left standing near
the monkey-house, be found it hanging by
the bind wheels on the fence of the elk in
closure in a perfect state of collapse, and
the horse contentedly browsing on the
scant herbage around the banks of the
lake. â Cincinnati Enquirer.
WATER NOT POPULAR.
A Medical View of Its Use Three Cen-
tures Ago.
It needed a very bold man to resist the
medical testimony of three centuries aÂ«o
against water drinking. Few writers can
be found to say a good word for it. One
or two only are concerned to maintain
that "when begun in early life it may be
pretty freely drunk with impunity," and
they quote the curious instance given by
Sir Thomas Elyot in his "Castle of
Health," 1541, of the Cornishmen, "many
of the poorer sort, which never, or very,
seldom, drink any other drink, be not
withstanding strong of body and like and
live well until they be of great age."
Thomas Cogan, the medical schoolmaster
of Manchester fame, said in his "Haven of
Health," 1589. designed for the use of stu
dents, that he knew some who drink cold
water at night or fasting in the morning
without hurt; and Dr. James Hart, writ
ing about fifty years later, could even claim
among hi 3 acquaintance "some honorable
and worshipful ladies who drink little
other drink, and yet enjoy more perfect
health than most of them that drink of the
strongest." The phenomenon was unde
niable, but the natural inference was none
the less to be resisted. Sir Thoniis Elyot
himself is very certain, in spite of the
Cornishmen, that "there be in water causes
of divers diseases, as of swelling of the
spleen and liver." He complains oddly
also that "it flitteth and swini
meth," and concludes that "to young
General and Mrs. Stephen Maybell and Their New Headquarters on Brannan Street.
men, and them that be of hot complexions
it doeth less harm, and sometimes it prof
iteth, but to them that are feeble, old and
melancholy it is not convenient." "Water
is not wholesome cool by itself for an
Englishman," wa3 the version of Andrew
Borde â monk, physician, bishop, erabas
sado/ and writer on sanitation â as the re
sult of a life's experience. And to quote
the "Englishman's Doctor":
Both water and small beer, we make no question.
Are enemies lo health and good dl. estion.
But the most formal indictment against
â vater is that of Venner, who, writing in
1622, ponderously pronounces: "To dwell
ers in cold countries it doth very greatly
deject ttieir appetite, destroy the natural
heat and overthrow the strength of the
stomach, and consequently confounding
the concoction, is the cause of crudities,
fluctuations and windiness in the body."

THE SHAEP LOED TENTEEDEN.
A Number of Characteristic Stories
About Him.
The story of Charles Abbot has been
often toldâ the scrubby little boy who, fail
ing to become a chorister, ran after his
father through the streets of Canterbury,
carrying a pewter basin, case of razors,
and a bag of hair powder. The unpreten
tious dwelling whence the pair emerged
was situated in a narrow street opposite
the stately west portal of the cathedral,
and its' owner, who shaved for a penny and
cut hair for twopence, boasted that he had
thrice prepared his Grace the Archbishop
to deliver his triennial charge to tne clergy
of the diocese.
A good stoiy is told of Lord Tenterden,
as this disappointed little choirboy be
came, having one day, at his own table,
asked a county magistrate if he would
take venison. "Thank you, my Lord,
boiled chicken," was the reply. His Lord
ship had contracted an inveferate habit of
keeping himself and everybody else to the
precise matter in hand. "That, sir," said
tne Judge, "is no answer to my question.
I now ask you again if you will take veni
son, and I will trouble you to say yea or
no without furtlier prevarication."
Tenterden was habitually down on wit
nesses, and on one occasion told the chair
man of the East India Company, whom
he had failed to recognize as he entered
the box, "to hold up his head and speak
out like a man." The ruling passion is
sometimes strong in death, and just "ere
the weary pulse of life at last stood still"
Lord Tenterden was heard to murmur to
himself :
"And now, gentlemen of the jury, I
leave you to consider of your verdict." â

"ARMY OF HEAVEN HERE."
Mrs. Maybell Thinks It Caused
the Schism in the Sal
vation Army.
FITTING UP A NEW CHAPEL.
General Stephen Maybell Preparing
More Commodious Quarters on
Brannan Street.
"The real cause of the trouble in the
Salvation Army, the one that caused the
rupture between father and son, was the
fact that the son decideil to depart from
the lines laid down by the elder Booth,
and follow in the lines of the Army of
Heaven Here."
That was the astounding declaration
made yesterday by Mrs. General Maybell,
the wife of Stephen Maybell, the com
mander of the "Army of Heaven Here,"
as she sat in the generaTs office in the rear
of the new quarters that are being arranged
for the poor of the City who apply to the
general for food and shelter.
â¢'To show you that I am right it is only
necessary for me to read you this from the
War Cry of the 15th of February, the offi
cial organ of the Salvation Army in New
York, an extract from a report of a Tues
day noonday address by Commander Bal
lington Booth." And she read: "
Had we' not held our hand to the divine
plow and bent our shoulders to the war-wheel
and laced the national debt, the misrepre
sentations of the press, the slander of foes and
the cold, callous indifference of those wno did,
not know the army, and attributed other mo
tives to its work than tho?e which were really
correct, we should not have stood to-day with
a backing of over 2000 oiÃcers seeding to
bring the Kingdom of heaven on the earth.
"There, you see," she continued, ''that is
exactly our ideas and what we teach, that
the kingdom of heaven is on this earth.
Some time in last December the general
sent a letter to the Salvation Army head
quarters here and that was sent on to the
commander, ana as it contained enough
thunderbolts to shatter any army,
it is no vronder that it brought
about a disruption in the Salvation
Army. After Commander Booth read
it, it must have changed his line of
thoughts ana caused him to turn from the
teachings of his father, which is that
heaven can be reached through death and
the grave. They teach that you must die
to reach heaven, while our belief is that
in life there is heaven on earth. It is
such a beautiful belief that no wonder
Commander Booth adopted it."
The general is at this time preparing
new quarters in a two-story building on
the south side of Brannan street, between
Eighth and Ninth. Over the front is a
rudely painted sign which conveys the in
formation that in a few days the premises
Avill be opened by the Army of Heaven
Here.
"This place," Raid the general, who was
hard at work with a number of his soldiers
making alterations on the street floor of
the structure, which at one time was a hay
barn, "is being fitted up for the accommo
dation of thosj poor individuals who are
without homes, have nothing to eat and no
place to sleep. For the present this will
have a depth of 70 feet with its frontage of
25, but if need arises the depth can be ex
tended to 80 feet. It will be arranged with
single beds and will furnish shelter for
about fifty. Underneath these will be fit
ted up a large room in which meals will be
served to the deserving poor.
"No," said the general in response to a
question. "We are not organized in oppo
sition to the Salvation Army, but if tnere
is anything in our manner or working that
is similar to that of the Salvationists we
cannot help that. We aim to bring the
people to our view of thinking and to show
them that 'heaven is here.'
"We send out our army to preach in the
streets, and now there are about fifteen
soldierÃ assigned for that particular duty.
We furnish food to about thirty poor peo
ple daily, and have some five or six fami

OAKEIAGE DEAWN BY MAGNETS.
Wonderful Contrivance of a Mississippi
irtventor.
Gibson Hazelhurst of Beech Springs,
Xeshoba County, Miss., an inventor un
known to fame, is endeavoring to.interest
capital in a scheme he has perfected for <
the running of vehicles that he claims will j
revolutionize the world. He will make it
possible, he says, for anybody to have a
wagon that wil! run without horses at
practically no expense beyond wear and
tear. "In brief," he explains, "my inven
tion works this way. I will take an ordi
nary locomotive, for instance, tear all the
works out of it, and place new wheels on
it. These wheels are an invention of my
own, and are made according to a
plan I have perfected after several
years of study. The secret of the con
struction lies in the tires, which are
made of wood and steel. I have invented
a magnet of rare power and lasting. In
front of each of the wheels I place one of
these magnets at an angle known only to
myself. The magnets will be arranged in
sliding grooves, connected with levers
under the control of the driver. When
the vehicle is standing still they are kept
far enough away from the wheels to lose
the effect. When it is desired to start ail
that is necessary is for the driver to pull
one ot the levers, tne maenet gets close
enough to the wheel to get the current to
work, the steel portions of the tire are
drawn toward the magnet, and the wheel
goes around. The speed can be regulated
by the distance the magnet is held from
the wheel by the lever. If a load is being
pulied, or if it is intended to go faster
than one -magnet can draw, it is au
easy matter to put one or more of the
other magnets in operation. I figure that
with four of my patent wheels, each
equipped with one of my improved mag
nets, I will be able to move an ordinary j
locomotive drawing a train of eight Pull- i
man cars at from 200 to 400 miles an hour
as long as the passenger's on the train can ;
stand the strain." It.wns suggested to
the inventor that it seemed likely to a man
who knew nothinsr about it that a train of
cars would be necessary to go in front of
the engine and carry the magnets. "Not
at all; not at all,"" remarned Mr. Hazel
hurst entnusiastically. "On the contrary,
the magnets are not much larger than a
flour barrel. The power in them is placed
there by a process Known only to me. I
can take an ordinary pocket magnet, treat
it with my preparation and put enough
power in it to lift a crowbar."â Boston

TO BE ILLEGAL.
Attorney - General Fitzger
ald's Argument on Rail
road Law.
FRAUD ON THE PEOPLE.
A Legislative Enactment Under
a Title That Is Mis
leading.
FIGHT OF THE COMMISSION.
Another Day Occupied by the State's
Representative in the Fed
eral Court.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald continued
his argument yesterday in the Southern
Pacific injunction suit against the Railway
Commissioners. He addressed the court
mainly on the right of outside corpora
tions to come into the State and assume
privileges not previously possessed by
them.
His contention was that the Southern
Pacific Company couid not come into Cali
fornia and acquire leases not directly per
mitted under its original franchise, and be
hold to be illegal the act of 1880, which he
declared was not intended for the purpose
of fraud, under which the railroad com
pany asserted its rights. The act is as fol
lows :
An act permitting and authorizing railway
and other corporations organized under the
laws of this State, or of any State or Territory
of the United States of America, or any act of
Congress of the United States to do business
in this State on equal terms.
(Approved April 31, 1880.)
Section 1. That every railway corporation
and every corporation organized for the pur
pose of carrying freights or passengers which
has or may be created or organized under or
by virtue of any of the laws of any State or
Territory of the United States of America,
or any act of Congress of the United States of
America, may hereafter build railways, exer
cise the right of eminent' domain and do or
transact any other business which such cor
poration might if the same had been created
or organized under or by virtue of tne laws of
this State, having the same rights, privileges
and immunities and subject to the same laws,
â penalties, obligations and burdens as though
said corporations had been created by or or
ganized under the laws of the State of Califor
nia.
Sec. 2. Railroail corporations doing business
in this State and organized under any law of
this State or the United States, or any State or
Territory thereof, have power to enter into
contracts -.vith one another whereby the one
may lease, of the other, the whole or any part
of its railroad, or may acquire of the other the
right to use in common with it the whole or
any part of its railroad.
Following out this line of argument At
torney-General Fitzgerald said that the act
z-uthoriziitg foreign corporations to do
business in this State on equal terms with
the California corporations could not give
the outside corporation? any new power to
lease. They could only use such power as
possessed by them before.
Quoting from the constitution that no
corporation organized outside of the State
shall be allowed to Transact business in
this State under more favorable terms than
given to. the corporations organized in this
State, Mr. Fitzgerald argued that the lease
of railroad property under consideration
was impossible. The outside corporations
could only be permitted to come here and
do business on equal terms with the Cali
fornia corporations.
It would seem, he continued, that when
ever the Legislature enlarges in any way
or seeks to enlarge the powers generally
granted to corporations it shou4d be ex
pected t.o give the utmost publicity to the
act. In enlarging the powers to the ex-
tent of permitting the lease of the fran
chise* the Legislature would not be ex
pected to cover up the act as in this case.
To grant Mich TK>wer in an act thus dis
guised is misleading, deceptive, dishonest
âa fraud on the people.
The putting of the foreign corporations
on an equal footing with those of Califor
nia is intended. It cannot be contended,
and will not. be contended, that the act is
to be understood as increasing the powers
of California corporations. Nobody read
ins the title would say that the act relates
to increasing the powers of California cor
poration;;. The sole object and intention
of the act is to give equal powers to the
outside corporations â to place them on a
standing of business equality.
If the assumed powers to lease could be
obtained in that way, any corporation that
could attach itself to another corporation
would be able to increase its po^r in the
same way.
Ihe Attorney-General declared that an
act with a title like that under discussion
iB obnoxious to the constitution.
Judge McKenna asked for information
regarding certain authorities quoted in
support of this latter declaration, stating
that as he had understood the reading it
was necessary to show incongruity as well
as differences in the subjects of an act.
The title in the act under discussion, he
remarked, was a rather general one.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald went over
a portion of bis argument bearing on that
Then ibe representative of the people
took up the subject of the leases of the
California Paciric and South Pacific Coast
roads, arguing that franchises obtained
from the Government could not be leased
without Government permission.
Another proposition presented is that
the leases are void because they are repug
nant to section 'JO, article XII, of the consti
tution, which prohibits combinations be
tween common carriers not directly shar
ing in the profits.
Under this subject Mr. Fitzgerald dis
cussed the combination of the Central Pa
cific and South/m Pacific roads, going
over different routes but having the same
terminals. By that combination, ne de
clared, the people were deprived of the
benefits of competition, and the combina
tion is contrary to the constitution.
In the argument the strike of 1894 was
referred to in connection with an official
report that no injury to the business had
resulted. In that year less grain was
shipped over the roads than in any other
year since 1877. It was shown that the (
Southern Pacific Company's rortion of
the profits under the omnibus lease in 1894
was $54<5,051 30. The Southern Pacific j
Company of Arizona and the Southern
Pacific Company of New Mexico operated
at a loss that year, but tfteir share of lac
profits was represented to be something
over $77,000. In other words, the earn
ings of the Southern Pacific of California
were diverted to pay to these roads a pro
rata of profits that they never earned, and
the Southern Pacific of California was not
operated at a loss in 1894.
Mr. Fitzgerald announced that before he
concluded he would show that there had
been ' profits all along the line, excepting
from the Oregon road.
The argument of the Attorney -General
will be continued to-day.

SHE WAS TIRED OF LIFE
Bertha Bryant Suicides in a
Post Street Lodging-
House.
SHE TOOK CARBOLIC ACID.
Deliberate and Successful Attempt at
Self-Destructionâ Tried to Con
ceal Her Identity.
Bertha Bryant died because she said she
had nothing to live for. Her body was
found in her room at 207 Post street at 11
o'clock yesterday morning. She had taken
carbolic acid the night before. Her body
was removed to the Morgue, where it was
identified during the day. The deceased
was a little over 20 years of age. She came
from Vallejo two weeks ago, and engaged
a room at the Saville, conducted by John
Greenhalge. where she ended her life. She
left this note:
My life has been a complete failure, and I
am tired of it, so taice means to finish it.
March 17, 11:30 p. m., 1896.
In a goblet traces of carbolic acid were
found. A handkerchief saturated with the
fluid was found in the bed. Her death
had evidently been a horrible one, as her
mouth had been frightfully burned by the
Facsimile of the Note Written by Berth
Bryant Just Before She Took the Fatal
Dose of Carbolic Acid.
acid. She had evidently made an effort to
conceal her identity, as she did not sign
the note she left for the Coroner, and de
stroyed all other evidence of her person
ality. But Deputy Coroner Halletrt found
a blotter in her room, and tinder the glass
he discovered the name of Bertha Abbott
written in bold letters. He followed up
the clew, and learned that the deceased
was a relative of Conductor Abbott of the
Sutter-street Railway Company.
"The name of deceased is not Abbott, as
was first presumed by the Coroner," said
Conductor Abbott wnen seen last evening.
"She is a distant relative of mine, which
accounts for the name being found on the
blotter, but her right name is Bertha
Leone Bryant.
"Being a relative of the girl, I was
naturally intimate with her and befriended
her on different occasions, which led a
number of our acquaintances to believe
that I was protecting the young â¢woman.
This, however, is not a fact and is simply
an unbased story circulated by idle gos
sips."
Late last evening G. H. Abbott, a brother
of the conductor, called at the Morgue and
corroborated the identification. He said
that Bertha Bryant was the young
woman's name and that she was a native
of California. 20 years of age. He also
stated that deceased had been keeping
company with some livery-stable man
whose name he had forgotten, and that
the couple were at one time engaged to be
married. He was of the opinion that this
â unknown man was in a manner responsi
for the suicide of the girl.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, JB9(>.
PAINTERS' STRIKE
IN FULL SWING
All of the Union Journey
men Taken From
Their Work.
THE JOBS ARE TIED UP.
Bosses Are Determined They
Will Not Yield to the
Strikers.
A COMPROMISE SUGGESTED.
Paint-Dealers, Master Painters and
Union Men in a Triple Alliance
Is the Plan.
A call was made early yesterday morn
ing for every union painter in this City to
quit work. With few exceptions they re
sponded to the call and laid down their
brushes. A few objected to do so. A
mass-meeting of union painters will, be
held this evening to decide upon future
actions.
The executive committee of the union
visited several paint-dealers, and were as
sured that they can get all the material
they want when they desire to take con
tracts in the open market for themselves.
The strikers are confident of winning the
fight.
The master painters are equally deter
mined not to yield, particularly to the
card system. They held a conference yes
terday and discussed a plan for settling
the strike and guarding against future
troubles.
The plan is to form a triplÂ« alliance of
the master painters, paint-dealers and
journeymen.
Another strike is among the possibilities
of the near future. The District Council
of carpenters and joiners last night in
structed its walking delegate to call out all
union carpenters working on jobs with
non-union men. This may cause trouble
between a dozen or more contractors and
the union carpenters.
ORDERED A STRIKE.
Prompt Measures Taken by the
Painters' Union to Call Their
Men Out.
Determination and enthusiasm marked
the meeting of the members of the Paint
ers' Union yesterday morning at the
Temple at 115 Turk street. There were
about 400 present, and little time was
wasted in petting down to business.
After a brief discussion of the action of
the master painters in declaring against
the recognition of the card system, it was
decided by motion to order a general
strike of all the painters in the City. In
accordance with this determination
twenty-five men were appointed chairmen
of as many committees, each to consist of
five members in addition to the chairman,
whose duty it snould be u> at once notify
all men atwork of the action of the union.
Each chairman was provided with the fol
lowing letter of authority:
San Francisco, Cal., March 15, 1896.
This is to certify that Brother has been
duly elected at a called meeting of the
Painters' Union held on the above date at the
Temple, 115 Turk street, chairman of a com
mittee to interview the journeymen now at
work and call them out, as a general strike has
been ordered by the union. All members of
the union must act immediately, as the Master
Painters' Association refuses to recognize the
card James Rose, President.
Fred Busse, Rec. Sec.
Within a few minutes after 11 a. m., as
ihe result of this action, 150 men were
scouring the City, which had been dis
tricted among the various committees,
and a few hours later every union man
who had gone to work in the morning had
laid by his brush.
Many of those who arose to go to worK
in the morning refrained from dome so on
readme the reports in the morning news
papers in reference to the action of the
master painters.
The action of the union resulted in call
ing out about 300 men. The spirit that
pervades the men was indicated in the
course of the fifteen men employed at J. J.
Cooney's on Fourth street. After the com
promise had been effected pending the
action of the Master Painters' Association â 
Cooney selected all new men -to work fo r
him, instead of taking back his old hands.
but these new men were among the first to
quit yesterday, doing so as soon as they
learned through the newspapers the de
termination of the master painters not to
recognize the card system.
Among the contributions received yester
day were $25 from Thomas Carto and the
same amount from the Good fellows' Ex
change, the latter promising $50 if it was
required.
ALL FOR FIGHT.
Union Painters Called Off From
Nearly Every Job In the
City.
The afternoon meeting of the striking
painters was well attended, there being
but a few vacant seats left in the gallery.
The committees appointed in the morning
presented their reports, which with but
few exceptions were to the effect that the
painters at work quickly responded to the
call for another strike, and all those who
did not quit work at noon promised to do
so at night. In fact the City is well tied
up so far as the painting trade is concerned.
The most interesting reports were as
follows:
Committees in the Western Addition and
south of Market street said that not over three
or four men. declined to come and they do not
belong to the union.
F. Schulz of Committee No. 3 reported that
he and his men had caused every job in his
district to be closed up. His district is also
south of Market from Fifth to Eighth. He
visited eight jobs and all the painters came
out upon being notified. Ail the men promised
to be at the afternoon meeting. The only op
position came from Charles Sheahan of Fifth
street, who said that he never intended to
recognize the card system any longer than
necessary to get his present contracts finished.
Half a dozen other committees made
similar reports.
Tne report of Mr. Raymond of the Rich
mond District Committee was received
with cheers. He said that the Richmond
District men are nearly all out. In his
travels he met Mr. Kreling. a prominent
member of the Iroquois Club, who stated
that the club had authorized him to say
that the club will help the striking
painters to the fuil extent of its moral ana
financial ability. He also met Mr. Foster
of the North Pacific Railroad, who
promised to stand by the union, pay $3,
and recognize the card on all branches of
the road.
An effort was made by one or two who
had been called out to get the permission
of the union for them to return to work
where tde bosses had previously acceeded
to the union's terms. They were quickly
voted out, and several strong speeches were
made ia consequence. Mcl vox said that
the fieht was not to brine one man to time
but to regulate the entire painting trade of
San Francisco. The letter from the mas
ter painters showed plainly that there is
bat one thing to do â fight. It is better to
bring on the climax at once than to delay
matters.
A committee was appointed to see the
grainers to get them into the painters'
union or form a union of their own.
A number of rousing union speeches
were made by C. Isham, Mr. Andrews,
Bean and others.
WANT TO WORK.
A Dozen or More Painters Objected
to Being: Called Out
Again.
There was a spirited special meeting of
the striking painters last evening at 1159
Mission street. The gathering was the
creation of a moment, and it was the only
evidence of a break in the strikers' ranks.
It seems that these men were working yes
terday morning when the call out for a
general strike reached them. Instead of
indorsing the action of the majority who
made the second call-out, they protested
on the ground that it was not fair to the
bosses who had given in to the union's de
mands, and they made the argument that
the union's word to the friendly bosses
should not be broken.
These arguments were met with the
statements that the majority of those
bosses who had promised to conceed to
the union's demands had already broken
faith with the union men by joining hands
with the master painters, and had signed
the latter's refusal to recognize the card
system.
In other words, at its worst, it was a
stand-off. Those who made the protest
threatened to return to work to-day and
they were told that there was no law to
prevent them from doing so, and that the
Jast caJi-out was legally made by 800 or 900
union painters at a special meeting. Also,
that the last call-out and the first as well,
was not against individual bosses, but
against the entire trade for the purpose of
regulating the entire trade and not any one
boss.
In order to get the sense of the union
and to satisfy the protestors, it was de
cided to call a mass-meeting of all union
painters to-night. The place of meeting
will be announced on the bulletin board at
115 Turk street to-day. The twenty-five
committees now picketing the entire City
will at the meeting at 10 o'clock this morn
ing probably be instructed to notify all
union painters in their respective districts
to be present at the mass-meeting in the
evening.
The question at this mass-meeting will
be "Shall the strike be general or only ap
ply to those who have openly declared
against the union ? :> It is stated that the
majority of those who protested against
being called out yesterday morning were
among the last to join the union and the
first to secure work under the bosses who
conceeded willingly or unwillingly to the
union's demand.
All of the members were notified to be
present at the morning, afternoon and
evening mass-meetings to-day.
WILL BID FOR WORK.
Striking Painters to Enter the Open
Market and Take Contracts.
As soon as the striking painters learned
that they might be obliged to make a long
tight they determined to cast around for
means to protect themselves against im
mediate want and to provide for future
employment. For the time being they
have been promised such assistance of a
financial character as will Keep the strikers
from actual want.
In order to be ready for emergencies a
committee was appointed at an executive
meeting late yesterday afternoon to
canvass the situation. Mr. Bean is the
chairman. He and his co-workers started
out to visit a number of organizations and
individuals that have promised support.
They met with considerable success dur
ing the evening, and from the present out
look there is every reason to believe that
the strikers who are in need of help will be
provided for for some time and thus be
able to stand off on a long strike if
necessary.
The other featureâ future employment
proved equally encouraging. Before and
since the strike the men have stated that
they would go into business and compete
with the bosses if necessary to win. For
fear that it will be necessary several mem
bers of the executive board of the union
visited several dealers in painters' mate
rials. The dealers told the journeymen
that if they desire to go into business and
make contracts -with property-owners they
can have all the paints, oils and other
materials they desire. And better still, no
cash deposit will be required on any legiti
mate job they undertake.
Of course, the dealers expect to receive
the first payment on all work, and to this
the journeymen agreed. As stated, sev
eral dealers were called UDcn, and the as
surance of each was the same. The paint
ers were highly elated, and state that if
the bosses do not come to terms in very
short order the strikers will enter the open
market and offer to finish old contracts
and make new ones at rates that will force
the obstinate bosses to close up their
shops.
THE BOSSES 1 SIDE.
Master Painters State Their Posi
tion In Regard to the
Strike.
The master painters have a grievance
connected with the present strike and a
sore spot which they are rather disinclined
to expose to the public view. For days
they have contented themselves with terse
remarks to the effect that there are always
two sides to a question, but until yester
day no one could be found who was will
ing to exploit the second. side.
"This strike was caused," said J. P.
Fraser yesterday, "by the unemployed
painters, not by the men who are working
regularly. The steady men in the shops
are all right. They have been getting on
an average more than $3 a day, and the
question of wages is but a side issue in this
case. The real fight is over this proposed
working-card system, and to this the
bosses will never give in. What is the ob
jection to it? Humph! We want to run
our own business."
E. H. Black, president of the Master
Painters' Association, entered largely into
the history- of the painting trade in this
City.
"Five years ago," he said, "the journey
men were working ten hours for $3. Then
they struck for nine hours and got it.
Then they struck for eight hours and got
that, too. Then business got bad and
wages dropped.
"Two years ago the journeymen struck
again, that time for a restoration of the |3
rate. At that time we attempted some
organization against them, but it was weak,
and all we accomplished was the passing
of a resolution granting them all they
asked. And the result of this course we
have before us now.
"For the last two years business has
been growing worse. I raise fruit down in
Santa Clara, and I tell you if it had not
been for Black the fruit-grower Black
the painter would have been busted maD*
a time. But I have kept my men going
and have paid $3 and upward all the time.
"The trouble, so far as this strike is con
cerned, seems to me to be caused by the
fact that the amount of work to be done
has decreased while the number of painters
has increased. San Francisco, in this re
spect, resembles a trap. Painters come
here from the cold north to winter. While
they have a little money to stay on they re
main, hoping to get work, and when their
money is gone they caunot get out of
town. This expiains the over supply of
labor, and 'hard times' is a sufficient ex
planation for the decrease of business.
"In regard to regular men, you must
know that during the last few years the
local shops have followed the Eastern
custom of keeping a regular gang of men
who do all the work that comes into the
shop. When necessary, however, extra
men are called in, and these are usually
paid $2 50 a day. The extra men are usu
ally those who are not good enough work
men to hold down a regular job, though
occasionally a first-class workman is found
among them, but they are so plentiful as
to greatly outnumber the regular men, and
so control the union.
"That this is so is evident from the fact
that we boss painters employ only about
300 men regularly out of an estimated 2000
journeymen in the City.
"Now, the effect of calling out the men
who are working, and who, without any
card system or formal understanding, are
receiving the wages stipulated, cannot but
hurt the union. For if we yielded to all
they ask the men who have been working
regularly would still be working and the
extra men would still be catching an odd
day or two of work and making just as
little money as now. Granting the union's
demands would not furnish employment
for a single man more.
"Again, this action of the union in order
ing a strike at this time has knocked the
bottom out of the spring business, upon
which chiefly we depend. Landlords
whose tenants want painting done present
this as an excuse, and about 80 per cent of
our business comes from this source. So
if the men went back to work to-day there
would not be so much work for them as
before the strike was ordered. I, myself,
have lost thereby two promised jobs
which would have kept ten men at work
for four weeks.
"Why not grant the union's demands if
we are paying the same wages now? Well,
this is the reason. There is in every shop
one or two men who are kept for the pur
pose of doing rough work and for cleaning
up, etc. We pay them $2 25 or $2 50 a day.
If we granted the union's demands we
should have to pay them $3 a day. It's
only a half dollar, but it means a raise in
wages all along the line. If I can do a
third more work than another I am worth
more money to my employer, and lam
not going to be satisfied to see that other
getting the same pay as I do. So it is with
the journeymen, and if that schedule is
granted it only means more trouble.
"But the great stumbling block in the
way of a speedy settlement of the strike is
this proposed working-card system. This
time when the men struck there were to be
found two or three union men in each
shop. They went out, but the others
stayed and we were not seriously crippled.
But, if the card system were in operation,
they could take every man out and make
us grant anything and everything. And
from our past experience we do not care to
trust ourdelves completely in their power.
Why, the demand is ridiculous. We would
not own our own business.
"There is one circumstance connected
with the strike in which the|journeymen

were manifestly unfair. They had sent a
committee to confer with us concerning
their desires. We reported to our associa
tion, bnt did not see our way clear to grant
all that was asked. So we asked for
another conference. To our request no
reply was vouchsafed, but the strike was
ordered forthwith and without further
warning."
AN IDEAL UNION.
Bosses and Journeymen Shinglers
About to Band Themselves
Together.
The shinglers of this City are about to
form a trades union and affiliate with the
Building Trades Council. Yesterday a
number of representatives of this craft
called at the Temple to see the organizers
of the council to make arrangements for
"unionizing" and sending delegates to the
council.
There are between seventy and eighty
journeymen shinglers and about six boss
shinglers in San Francisco. This union
will be different from all other unions in
this respect. The bosses themselves are
the leaders in the movement of organiza
tion, and they are urging their workmen
to go into the union with them. In this
way their interests will be made identical,
and any possible difference that may arise
between employer and employe will be
straightened out in the union, or if neces
sary in the Building Trades Council. The
men are enthusiastic in the movement an
ideal trades union will soon be perfected.
A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE
Plans for Solving the Trouble For-
mulated by the
Bosses.
The board of directors of the Maste r
Painters' Association will shortly submit
to the union a plan for an amicable settle
ment of the present troubles, â which, they
believe, will solve the whole difficulty.
The scheme is an ambitious one. involv
ing a triple-alliance among the bosses,
the material men and the journeymen
painters.
"What we propose," said President E.
H. Black of the Master Painters' Associa
tion yesterday, "is nothing less than a
combination of all three classes for mutuaj
snpport and protection, if it be accom
plished, and 1 beiieve it is more than feasi
ble, troubles of this kind will never occur
again.
"At the present time you must know
the master painters buy their material
where and how they please. Some patron
ize local dealers, others buy from the
traveling men of Eastern paint-houses.
We believe that if our trade were confined
strictly to the local dealers it would be of
sufficient advantage to induce them to
favor the association's members in regard
to prices.
"In the Master Painters' Association we
have at present, say sixty of the principal
shops in town, and of these a considerable
percentage buys its materials directly from
the East. Now, we propose to go to the
Paint and Oil Club, the dealers' association
of this City, and say to them, 'If you will
agree to sell material to members of our as
sociation at a price say 15 per cent less than
what you ask of outsiders, whether they
be owners or boss painters outside of our
association, we in turn will agree to buy
all our materials from members of your
organization.' This proposition has al
ready been made to the material men in
an unofficial way and meets with their ap
proval. They want only to satisfy them
selves tnat we are strong enough" to pro
tect them, and this is easily shown since
we are gaining members rapidly. Last
night we took in a dozen, and as many
more applications were laid over till the
next regular meeting because of trifling
irregularities, such as, for instance, the
absence of initials to a name or the lack of
an address.
"Having settled this matter with the
material men we shall be in a position to
treat with the union. A reduction of 15
percent in the cost of materials will justify
an advance of 8 per cent in the price of
labor, which is practically what the
journeymen demand. This being the case,
we will offer them the wages they ask and
agree to employ only union men.
"An unconditional surrender? Not at
all. The question of wages will have ad
justed itself, for. we are and always hay*
been willing to pay as high wages as we
could eet out of our customers. The queÂ»
tion of wages cuts but very little figure in
this strike anyway, for the regular men in
the shops have been getting $3 right along.
But this plan involves the abandonment by
the union of the workinÂ«-card system.
That is what has been the cause of the
whole trouble. Unconditional surrender?
Scarcely, if we get 15 per cent from the ma
terial men and the abandonment of the
working-card system by the union. 01
course we agree to employ only union men,
and it might be thought that that is prac
tically the same thing, but it is not."
MORE TROUBLE AHEAD.
Union Carpenters Will Be Forbidden
to Work With Non-Union
Men To-Day.
At a meeting of the District Council of
carpenters and joiners last evening action
was taken in a matter that is of much im
portance, inasmuch as ii may involve a
dozen or more jobs in a walkout or strike.
Last fall the four carpenters' and joiners'
unions, and the District Council, which is
the central body, revised the constitution
and by-laws, and among other changes
was that, of section 23 of the trade rules,
which reads as follows :
Sec. 23. No union carpenter shall work with
a non-union carpenter longer than one week,
unless he obtain his application and fee or
notify the business agent For violation of
this rule the penalty shall be five ($5) dollars,
fine.
During the winter months, when work
was very scarce and times not particularly
lively, this rule was not strictly enforced.
Consequently there are many mixed jobs
in this City at the present time where
union and non-union men are at work to
gether. The union fever has of late en
tered into all branches of trade, and the
carpenters are not proof against the spirit
of the times.
Last evening the District Council in
structed its business agent, Mr. Schadt, to
enforce the union law in question and call
out every carp?uter in the City who is
working on a job with non-union men.
From all that can be learned there are at
least a dozen such jobs in San Francisco,
and this order means nothing short of a
strike in some places. It is not at all likely
that the contractors will give in on the first
sign of a battle, and it is equally improba
ble that the carpenters ordered to nuit a
job will risk the payment of $5 fines or be
come defiant, particularly as the initiation
fee will be $10 in a yerv short time. Mr.
Schadt said that he will begin to act under
the council's instructions as soon as the
men go to work this morning.
As soon as these jobs are weeded out
Mr. Schadt will go to Sacramento and or
eranize a carpentera' union in that city.
District Organizer Malsbary having left
the State.
Another matter of no little future sig
nificance came up in the form of a resolu
tion, that all building contractors be noti
fied that after May 1 they will have to pay
their union carpenters no less than $3 a
day. Like the other trade rule this has
been a sort of dead letter during the win
ter months, and even union carpenters
have been working for lessâ many as low
as $2. The reason for setting May 1 is that
carpenters figuring iipon work may know
exactly what they will have to pay for
their labor.
The council again passed a resolution
that it will support the painters'union in
its present strike.

A MONOPOLY EXACTION.
In a recent incident occurring in that
section the Visalia Delta has found a good
means of illustrating to Eastern people
why California is opposed to the Southern
Pacific of Kentucky and why they are
fighting by every means in their power all
proposals for refunding the railroad debts
and every other scheme that means a per
petuation of the monopoly.
The incident recorded by the Delta is the
experience of a gentleman named J. B.
Mil h, who recently ordered from a wire
fence company of Holly, Mich., a car
load of material. On the shipment the
Southern Pacific made so heavy a charge
that an inquiry into the mutter was un
dertaken. An extract from a letter written
by the secretary of the wire company to
Mr. Mills is quoted by the Delta, as fol
lows :
You perhaps understand from onr former
letter that we had a rate of 50 cents per hun
dred pounds to terminal points in California.
Some of them we named to yon, Stockton
among others. We found, when we came to
make an inve*tijration. that from Stockton to
Tulare the distance was I(>G miles. nn<i that
the regular local rate was 0:f cento. We an
ticipated, from information that we had for
merly received, that the rate could be reduced,
and we made application tojhe railroad people
for a special commodity rate, *nd, after forcing
the rate all that was possible, we found that
the Southern Pacific people would not make
Ray reduction, hence you will see that they Ret
the 03-cent local rate for hauling your car
irom Stockton to Tulare, the distance named,
and we only pay 50 cents on the long haul of
nearly 3000 mile?.
You uo doubt will look at this matter in the
same light that we doâ that it is a genuine
steal. Anywhere in this section of the country
we could send this carat least 300 miles at the
rate of 12 cents per hundred, and they ge; 09
cents for the short distance mentioned.
This instance of a charge so excessive
that the Eastern writer calis it 'a genuine
steal" does not by any mean- stand alone.
It is noted solely because it happens to be
one that baa come to hÂ»ht. There is
hardly a shipper in California who could
not, from the records ol his own business,
furnish many more of a similar kind, and
some of charges even more excessive. It
is just because such offenses are so com
mon that the Californians have become
aroused to the truth that if the State
would flourish the monopoly must be
overthrown.
IMPKOVING THE MISSION.
Never were the evidences of intelligent
and energetic co-operaiion more conspicu
ous than in that broad district of San
Francisco indefinitely called the Mission.
It is true that this district i* getting noth
ing like, the public expenditures for ini
{â¢rnw-meiits which its proportion of taxe>
warrants, br.t its people are organized and
fighting, and that is bound in the end to
bring them everything they deserve. It
wa? only by the hardest kind of organized
work that the appropriation for the Foi
som-street boulevard was secured, but that
victory will make others all the easier.
The Mission v now desirous of having a
park and a high school. These are most
reasonable demands. It is impossible for
:i pupils to attend the present high
schools in the Western Addition without
paying car fare and consuming about an
hour and a half a day in transit. As many
of the residents of that district are not so
senerously provided with worldly goods
a? the residents of the Western Addition,
the situation of the high schools in the
Western Addition works a severe, unneces
sary and unjust hardship.
As James D. Phelan has pointed out in
a discussion of these matters, there are
two prime considerations which determine
the future importance of that section. One
is its climate, which was the main con
cern of the Franciscans in their selection
of the spot for the Mission Dolores a cen
tury ago. its warmth and comparative
freedom from fogs and winds will always
operate in its favor with those who prefer
comfort to commanding and conspicuous
situations on the heights of the Western
Addition. The other is the fact that as
the peninsula becomes fiiled up the growth
must necessarily be southward, through
the Mission toward San Mateo, and that
with the development of San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties there will be an in
creasing traffic between those counties and
San Francisco, and it must be conducted
throngh the Mission.
The City, north of Market street, is
reasonably well supplied with parks, and
besides the minor ones is the nearness of
Golden Gate Park. Excepting Holly Park,
which might be made ornamental but can
never be very useful, the Mission has no
outdoor resting place. North of Market
street are two high schools, two technical
schools, all the colleges of the State Uni
versity and a Normal School. The region
south of Market street is destitute of these
conveniences. This is an unfair distribu-
tion of public conveniences and should be
remedied.
LOOKING TO THE WEST.
The significance of the visit made
to California and the Pacific States by
friends of two prominent candidates
for the Presidency should not be dis
regarded. It means that these States
are now recognized as a power in National
politics â possibly less on the score of their
voting strength than by reason of the new
industrial and political principles which
their interests have created and which are
finding so vigorous expression. In any
event, whatever may be the explanation of
the fact that National politicians are look
ing to the extreme West, the opportunity
of these States for making the most of the
situation is the thing to be considered.
The Trans-Mississippi Congress was the
first movement toward a centralized exer
cise of the power which the Western States
possess when acting in concert. The work
of the congress was largely of an industrial
character, but much attention was paid to
the need of this great section in the way
of National legislation looking to the just
recognition and promotion of its industrial
needs. The only trouble with the congress
was that, embracing as it did all the States
west of the Mississippi, it included those
having needs not strictly appertaining to
the Pacific btates. The more urgent needs
of the latter are adequate irrigation laws,
transportation regulation, improvement
of rivers and harbors, coast defenses and
protection of mineral lands and the public
domain. Among the trans-Mississippi
State* east of the Rocky Mountains some
of these propositions have no interest and
others are totally absent.
A concern of National importance is the
inevitable increase in the population and
development of the Pacific States. Within
the next ten years this progress undoubt
edly will be great. Never before in the
history of tue country has the pres
sure of California been so strongly felt in
Congress, and never have the needs of the
State been so well understood. The bitter
controversy over the funding bill has edu
cated the East on the transportation ques
tion, and the suits pending before the Su
preme Court of the United States on our
irrigation laws have opened Eastern eyes
to a matter of very vital concern to us. It
is beginning to dawn upon the Eastern in
telligence that the obstacles to the progress
which the superior advantages of Califor
nia deserve are artificial and removable,

and that their disappearance in time is in
evitable.
This makes it all the more incumbent on
California and her sister Pacific States to
send unpledged delegates to both the Na
tional conventions and thus be in a posi
tion to wield their power for the common
good of the section. Such concert of action
would be more effective in accomplishing
what we all need than anything else.
CLEVELANDISM KEBUKED.
The speeches made in the Senate on the
resolutions to open the Tncompahgre res
ervation in Utah would have caused under
any administration save this a profound
sensation throughout the country. The
main arguments of the speakers were con
cerned less with the merits of the bill than
with the action of the Secretary of the In
terior, who, in dealing with the matter, had
deliberately ignored the law and acted as
if he were the minister of an autocrat and
not the secretary of a President bound
under the constitution to the faithful main
tenance of law.
Had charges of such nature been made
only by political opponents of the admin
istration, it is probable they might have
passed in the public aiind as something in
the way of campaign material to be used
In the approaebins Presidential election.
They were made, however, by men of ail
parties and by none with nfore force or with
more eloquence than by Senator Vest, who
is not only a stalwart Democrat, but was for
a long time among the foremost of that
section of the party whose subservience to
Cleveland gained for its members the un
complimentary title of 'cuckoos."
The charges themselves are of a charac
ter about us serious as can be made against
a President without going to the extent of
impeaching him. The constitution in
trusts the President with great powers â
greater than those possessed by the Queen
of England and her Prime Minister com
bined. In the hands of a headstrong, ob
stinate man those powers would be dan
gerous if any precedents were set up that
allowed them to be stretched beyond their
constitutional limits. Mr. Cleveland has
not only stretched them to an evil degree
himself, hut he has encouraged his secre
taries to imitate his example. Acts have
been committed by the Secretary of the
Treasury and the Secretary of Agriculture,
as well as by the Secretary of the Interior,
that show a contempt for the laws of Con
gress and a desire to administer the affairs
of the country in accordance with indi
vidual caprice.
It is to the credit of the Democratic
party that it has leaders lite Vest who
will not condone or excuse such offenses
for the sake of party harmony. Such acts
merit the fullest rebuke the Senate can
give them, and Democratic Senators act
wisely in taking the lead in administering
the rebuke. Democracy lias heavy bur
dens to curry in the way of legislation en
acted by the last Congress and it cannot
afford to carry Clevelandism in addition
thereto.
ON THE VEBGE OF GOOD TIMES.;
It is dangerous to indulge in excessive
optimism, for disappointment often fol
low?, but to any one who will study with
care the situation in California at the pres
ent time the conclusion must come that
the State is on the verge of what, for lack
of a better term, we call an epoch of good
times.
There are certain industries which are
absolutely essential to the prosperity of a
State or community, and they may be BVM*
marized, generally, as agriculture in its
various branches, commerce, domestic and
foreign, manufactures, mining, where min
eral ground exists, and cheap and ready
transportation. Of conrse there are sub
divisions and ramifications of these gen
eral essentials, but they cover the field
closely enough for any one except the pro
fessional collator of statistics.
Taking this, then, as a text, it is easy to
see that this great State is on the very edge
and verge of a development whicti is al
most incredible except to those who be
lieve in material as well as scientific evolu
tion. The early and the latter rains have
relieved the farmer and the orchardist
from anxiety, and the possibility of severe
frosts hereafter is hardly worth consider
ing ; our commerce will receive a new im
petus by the establishment of a line of
steamers in competition with the Pacific
Mail and by increased facilities for inter
change of products within the State;
raining has taken on, not the aspect of a
boom, which is a thing to be deprecated,
but the appearance of a genuine enter
prise, whether it be gold, coal, copper,
quicksilver or petroleum, and the progress
| of the Valley Railroad insures cheap and
ready transportation within one of the best
and most favored portions of California.
If to these material advantages be added
t!ie restoration of public confidence, the
disposition of moneyed men to make large
investments and to lend their surplus
funds on landed security and the general
feeling in the community that better times
await us we may predict with at least rea
sonable certainty that California is on the
eve of a prosperous era.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
"KeniJworth," the first American opera of
any serious pretensions which has made a.
European success, is shortly to be performed
in New York by the Damrosoh Company. The
work is by Bruno Oscar Klein, a German-
Amerioan, who is now 38 years of age, and
who is said to have waited for his first dramatic
work till his individuality had thoroughly
asserted itself. The librettist of "Kenilworth"
Is William Muller, who is well knftwn among
the German-Americans of New \ork. The
wo:k was produced for the first time at the
Stadtthcater in Hamburg on February 13,
1895. The great Wagner . interpreter, Frau
Klafsky, created the role of Amy Robsart,
while her husband, Otto Lohse, conducted the
orchestra. The opera scored an enormous
success. At a meeting of the intendants of the
German and Austrian theaters Klein's opera
Bruno Oscar Klein, Composer of the First American Opera That lias Won a Great
European Success.
[reproduced frÂ»m the Looker On.]
was chosen for the festival performance on
April '29. The ever-increasing popularity of
the new wort caused it to be accepted imme
diately in Berlin, Vienna and London. At the
first performance in New York Klafsky will
again sing the part of Amy. The form and
orchestra of "Keniiworth" are said to be those
employed by Wagner in his "Lohengrin."
Klein makes use of leading motives to a very
limited extent, using but six in the entire
opera. The work is said on all hands to be
stamped with a strong individuality and to
show melodic invention, as well as the com
poser's powerful senÂ«e of iorm and his pro
found knowledge of the orchestra. The New
York production of "Keniiworth" is bein?
looked forward to with ereat interest.
Considerable comment ha? Deen passed by
the. French press over the neglect of the Gov
ernment to give Ambroise Thomas a public
funeral. Le Menestrel says: "The ceremonies
were not 'National' in the official acceptation
Of the word. Not one of the Ministers wat=
struct by tire honest thought ot disinteresting
himself enough from his own personal affairs
to say to the Parliament : 'Gentlemen, a great
artist has been taken from us, let us for a mo
ment forget our Parliamentary quarrels and
pay Ambroige Thomas the eights which are
his due. 1 This would have made a moment's
truce from contemptible discussions, would
have been like a little pure air let into the
hall, overcharged with sessions, a touch of
ideality in short given to the country, in the
midst of scenes of violence, of the lies and
wranglings with which we are overwhelmed.
But though it did not receive the official stamp,
the funeral of Ambrolse Thomas was not tbe
less imposing and popular. Perhaps it wat,
better for this noble spirit, this great and good
man, to have had no compromise, even after
his death, with the contemptible politicians
who lead us."
Le Menestrel gives au account of a theater
which has been founded in a village of Russia
named Patjano by a wealthy man of the name
of Bunastrow. In this theater all the singing
and acting are done by the peasants them
selves, and they are the only patrons of the
performances. The very modest hall contains
116 places, of which the most expensive cost
20 kopeks (about 8 cents); the other scats
vapy from 18 to 1 kopek. The performers are
all pupils of the public school?, a:id the scen
ery, costumes, lights, etc. , are all furnished by
Mr. Bunastrow. The money taken at the door
is distributed equally among the young per
formers, who in the course of the winter sea
sou can make about rive rubles each, a sum
which the little villagers by no means despise.
The hall is always crowded and everything
put on the stage is of a highly moral character.
The Fanfulla, an Italian newspaper, pub
lishes an interview with Mascagui apropos of
his new opera, "Zanetto" (The Passer-by).
The work has been billed for performance at
La Scala this Lent, but it seems that the com
poser declares authoritatively that he will not
permit the rehearsals to proceed. "I will not
allow 'Zanetto' to be given at La Scala this
season," he said. "The opera is mine, exclu
sively mine, and" I will not give it up for any
royalties that Italian or foreign publishers
may offer me. Those who want to hear the
work will have to come to Pesaro, where I
shall give the first performance, prepared by
myself, directed by myself and executed in my
own fashion."
The dearth of really fine new masses for the
Catholic church is so great that considerable
interest attaches to the recent first production
of Alfred Bruneau's requiem in London. This.
French composer has hitherto been best known
as a collaborator with Kmile Zola in the pro
duction of operas, a training which would not
strike one as being the most fitting preparation
for writing devotional music. To tell the truth
Bruneau seems to have succeeded better in
opera, with Zola as his librettist, than he has
done in his recent attempt to compose a
requiem. When Alfred Bruneau's opera "Le
Reve" was produced in London the most sober
minded critics declared that though the music
was madness, there wus method in it. "L'At
taque dv Moulin" evinced a great advance in
musical beauty and general coherence and
Zola's libretto was pronounced on all hands to
be splendidly effective. The music of the
requiem, however, has met with scant praise
from tne London press. The Saturday Review,
which is noted for its fearless aud just criti
cisms, says: "There is only one requiemâ
Mozart'Bâ the rest are but imitations, or worse
still, endeavors to be original. Of all such en
deavors Bruneau's is absolutely the ugliest,
worst, dullest, moat pretentious, most tedious
we have ever come across. There are masses
for the church, like Palestrina's, masses for the
concert-room, which are expressions of per
sonal feelings, like Beethoven's, and masses
for the theater, like Gounod's. Of this last
sort is Bruneau's, and it is not good even of its
soft The only possible way of endowing the
score with tbe faintest interest is by adding a
part for the bagpipes to the setting of Tiu
Jesu.' "
Bruneau's requiem is shortly to be produced
in Paris, where possibly it will meet with a bet
ter fate than it has done in London.
The Mikado, whose income has been aug
mented by Chinese gold, lias become & great
patron of lyric art. Not long ago he founded
a conservatory with European professors of
music, and now he has given orders for an
Italian, opera troupe to be imported in order
to give lyric drama at the imperial court of
Japan. In spite of the extraordinary gift of
assimilation which the Japanese posses*, they
have not yet succeeded in producing a native
born operatic singer, but with perseverance
they may succeed in doing so. Who knows?
In another twelve years graduates of the Tokio
Conservatory may be starrirfcas globe-trotting

The London School Board has just passed a
decision which will fill ell the pianoforte
manufacturers of the United Kingdom with
joy. Beginning with the first of this month,
pianoforte instruction is being given gratu
ituously to the boys and girls in the board
schools. At present the 209 schools in the city
of London contain 272 pianos, but this number
will be doubled and tripled before the end ot
the year, and yet there will not be enough
pianos for all the pupils. At this rate England
will soon become a pianoforte-playing ma'
chine.
A new pianist has loomed up on the Euro

groat Wagnerian conductor whose health has
so completely broken down, says that he con
siders Franz Fischer has achieved gigantic j
success n:id that he Is unique in his power of
reproducing a Wagnerian orchestra on the

A STYLISH COSTUME.
The waist shown here has a fitted lining,
which fastens in the center front.
Over this the goods are seamless but for the
under-arm gore, where the bodice fastens at
the left side.
The skirt is cut circular in front, and has two
gores in the back which are laid in box-pleats.
A costume of blue serge had yoke and sleeves
of bright plaid silk. Across the top of the
bodice was a band of spangle trimmings an
inch wide, and the same trimming formed a
narrow belt.
A new nioJjair had sleeves and yoke of
natural-colored batiste, with lines of gay colors
forming crossbars.
A dark green wohair, having a design in the
weave, had the yoke and sleeves of two-toned
taffetas in green and violet. The trimming
consisted of violet velvet rolled ou the upper
edge of the bodice, and also used as a belt.
A handsome gown of black grenadine over
pale reseda silk had the yoke of black lace in a
very open desien over the green silk. Green
ribbons formed stock collar and belt, the top
of the bodice being edged with a narrovr
spangled band in green and gold.
A bouele canvas in brown had the yoke of
white lace over pale blue Bilk; the border was
trimmed with piping of velvet at the top, and
each of the points was apparently held in place
by a handsome button of filigree gold over
pearl. A gilt belt was worn. *

BALANCED ON A RIDGE.
About five miles from San Francisco on the
San Bruno road stands a house occupied by
a Portuguese gardener that is practically
balanced on a ridge of clay. Two years ago the
house stood on a comparatively level spot with
a small gully, washed by the rain, about ten
feet on either side of it. The position of the
house was really the bottom of a hollow be
tween two hills, and the natural effect of the
rain was to make both gullies wash toward
the center and become one.
The water has already washed away the earth
on both sides of the house and undermined it
several ieet, so that there is only a small ridge
under the center. Instead of realizing his
danger as soon as the floods commenced to
wash beneath his house and moving it to a
place of safety, the owner devoted all his ener
gies to the work of bracing it. He ia^tened
poles on all sides and built posts under the
corners. A few ropes were also used to aid the
supposed strengthening process.
The floods washed away the earth from in
front of the door so that'it was impossible to

Each storm carries off a little more earth and
the owner puts in a few more braces. He nÂ»i

but has not really done anything to secure its
permanence in its present position. The poleÂ»
that he has put up are so weak that they

another so as to throw it out of balance. ThÂ»
owner has plenty of land on which, his house
could have been moved with but little trouble,
but for some reason he seems to prefer running
the cftance? oi losing it altogether. A few
heavy rainstorms would soon cut out tne littl*
earth remaining under it and wash it down
against a culvert under the railroad track.

THE DEADHOUSES
ARE CONDEMNED
Result of "The Call's" Ex
posure of the Chinese
"Hospitals."
DR. LOVELACE'S REPORT.
The Board of Health Notifies the
Consul and the Six Com
panies.
PLAN OF THE MISSIONARIES.
A Movement Started for a Mongolian
Hospital to Be Located in
Chinatown.
The Board of Health at its meeting yes
terday, by a unanimous vote, condemned
the Chinese hospitals, or homes of tran
quillity, the presence and condition of
which were exposed by The Call.
Health Officer Lovelace's report regard
ing the filthy dens where the dead and
dying Chinese lie almost side by side was
a revelation to the members of the board,
and their diseust at the thought of such
places existing within their jurisdiction
was heightened when Drs. McMurdo and
O'Brien, who made an investigation of the
death traps, reported on the horrors they
had seen.
Dr. McMurdo stated that in one place, in
close proximity to the sick, a Chinaman's
dead body was found, and that a portion
of the face had been eaten away by rats.
He could hardly find words to express his
condemnation of the sanitary condition of
the dens, and expressed a belief that the
board should lose no time in closing the
places. In some of the hospitals, notably
those in the rear of 724 Pacific street, the
attendants were found to be sufferine irom
various ailments, some of them hems so
weak and debilitated as to render them of
Jittle use in ministering to the wants of
the unfortunates, who were lying about,
waiting patiently for death to end their
sufferings.
The effect of the report on the members
of the board was at once apparent, and,
when Dr. Morse moved that the hospitals
be condemned as public nuisances there
â were no dissenting voices. Secretary God
chaux was instructed to at once notify the
Chinese gix Companies and the Chinese
Consul-General that the board had con
demned the hospitals and morgues at 724
Pacific street and the one in the rear of 910
j Jackson street, and to request that the or
jdersof the board be complied with wuh
j the utmost possible dispatch. The Six
! Companies were also notified that they
j mast care for the sick Chinese now in the
i hospitals in some place where the sanitary
! arrangements, or rather lack of them, are
j not so objectionable. The inspector of the
; district that embraces Chinatown will
! watch the deadhouse closely to see that
j the orders of the board are complied with, |
and any evasion of the matter will result
in the arrest of :he keepers and those con
cerned in the maintenance of the grew-
Borne dens.
As a second result of the publicity cast
i upon these ''Homes of Tranquility" and
j "Quiet Xursin* Places," the Christian
j missionaries have started a movement for
a Chinese hospital. The Presbyterian
mission on Stockton street, of which Rev.
Ira M. Condit is superintendent, the
Methodist Episcopal mission, under Dr.
j Masters, the Baptist mission, under. the
i Rev. Mr. >"orris, the Cumberland Pres
j byterians, the Refuge Home, pre
! sided over by Miss Cnlbertson. and all the
j other mission "workers have at least ap-
I proved of the plan and some of them have
already taken steps to alleviate the con-
I dition of affairs which has called down
| the condemnation of the health board of
i the City. The Rev. Mr. Conriit has had a
room at his mission house set apart and
j furnished for the accommodation of sick
I Chinese, and before long it is expected
that some house in the neighborhood will
be put into sanitary condition and main
tained as a hospital for the poorer class of
Chinese, who in the absence ot such an
institution are forced to go to the dead
house or are taken there by their cousins.
Perhaps the Chinese Consulate will assist
the movement, and the Six Companies
will be asked to contribute.
Several} ears ago a similar movement
was set en foot by the wealthy Chinese;
I but fell through after a great deal of money
j had been subscribed because the Board of
I Supervisors refused to sanction the erec
i tion of a hospital building in the southern
j part of the City. The present movement,
j iiowever, being fathered by the mission
j aries, who will have control of the institu
[ tion and be answerable for its sanitary
â  condition, will probably be successful.
Yesterday a party of ladies, among them
Miss Alexander of the Presbyterian Mis
son, visited as many of the dea<lhou=es as
they could gain admission to, and left food
for the living inmates. At the Hongkong
"Chamber of Tranquillity," one of those
condemned by the Health Board, they
were refussed admission, though they had
brought food for its solitary dyine inmate,
who lies in a dark, damp and foul room,
along with a dead body.
At the Hop Wah Morgue on Washing
ton street, the ladies found three dying
coolies in most wretched condition, lying
on bare boards. Of one of the men, who
could speak fairly good English, Miss
Alexander asked if there was anything he
wanted. Jr.st something to lie on, he re- ]
{ plied, adding that the bare boards made i
hi? bones sore. Later in the day the mis- !
sion ladies took him a blanket, which the I
poor wretch needed so badly. He was |
asked if he would not like to wash, and he I
replied that it was impossibleâ more than
jhe dared hone for. Indeed, there are no
accommodations of any kind in these
| death houses. Towels and soap are en- j
tirely unknown quantities, and a bare
drink of water :n a dirty, nasty tin cup, is
often an impossible luxury.

The Supreme Court has issued the writ
of mandate prayed for by Bateman Bros.,
and in doing so has settled the statutes un

THE GOTO REMEDY.
Supervisor Benjamin Will Get the
Money to Bay Medicine for
the Lepers.
Contributions for the fund to purchase
medicine for the lepers are being received
daily by Supervisor Benjamin, and there
is no doubt now that the amount neces
sary will soon be raised.
Last evening Mr. Benjamin reported
that he had collected $130 and had been
promised other sums. In due time he
will take steps to communicate with some
competent firm or physician in Japan, so
that the genuine Goto remedy may be
procured.
Yesterday Supervisor Benjamin received
a letter from D. C. Barber, superintendent
of the Los Angeles County Hospital. The
Utttn had seen in The Call an account of ;
the movement to purchase the medicine
kr.own as Dr. Goto's remedy, and there
fore wrote to the Supervisor asking the
price per ounce, and signifying that money
would be remitted to pay for a quantity
sufficient for the two lepers in the Los
Aneeies hospital, or as the superintendent
expressed it, "our two lepers."
Supervisor Benjamin will prepare and
publish at the proper time a full list of all
the contributors to the fund.
MR. AND MRS. CLINTON R. COULTER (NEE HADENFELDT).
CALLS HIM A "BUGIARDO"
Terrible Consequences That Are
Resulting From a
Satire.
L'ltalia Objects to Pietro Gori's "In
solence" to the Local
Colony.
There are hot words being bandied in
the Italian colony ; people who once were
friendly do not smile as they pass by, and
even the newspapers are interlarding their
columns with telling invectives , in the
; largest and most ornamental style of type.
The trouble is a complicated one. but it
had its origin in a dramatic performance
| which the anarchist, Pietro Gori, gave in
Apollo Hall last Saturday evening. Gori,
as befits a gentleman of his views, has
; scant respect for capitalists or men of
light and leading in the community. In
' accordance with this bump of irreverence,
he did not hesitate to dash off a comedy,
I introducing humorous caricatures upon
i some of the best-known men in the colony.
I The actors performed their parts so well
that the audience had not the least diffi-
c ulty .in recognizing the persons lam
pooned. Not a few very -well-known
â  people indeed were recognized ; some of
| â whom had associated familiarly â with
: royalty. â  â 
Most of the people who were "taken off"
j by Pietro Gori were conspicuous by their
absence from the entertainment, but their
friends, as good friends will, took particu
lar pains to let them know how very dis
respectfully they had been treated, and in
i some cases, by passing from mouth to
' mouth,' the accounts of, the caricatures be
came positively appalling. .
The day after the performance L'ltalia
j passed- it in critical review Â«nd took
! Gori sharply to task for what it denomin
! ated as his "insolence" toward - a colony
i that had treated him with kindness and
j consideration. Hitherto Gori and ail his
works had been spoken of kindly in L'ltalia,
and the anarchists,' hurt at the change of
tone, took up his pen and applying a num
ber of epithets the reverse of 1 complimen
tary to the editor of L'ltalia caused his
effusion to be published in La Voce ; del
Popolo. '
At this point new element came into
! the discussion. The lawyer for Crespi at
j the Almai:ia-CreÂ«pi libel ' trial, which . was
I recently decided in favor of ; Signor Alma
gia, editor of L'ltalia,' stated that Gori had
heard Almagia speak in i terms of the
highest praise of Crespi. The editor of
! L'ltalia not only denied this soft impeach
ment, but called, on Gori -to deny ; it too.
In response to this demand Gori wrote a
letter, which L'ltalia refused to publish on
the grounds that the ; anarchist neither
affirmed nor denied whether he had made
the Crespi-Almagia statement or not.
! Gori straightway published the non-com
mittal letter in La Voce and with it
hurled a few more epithets at L'ltalia and
its editor. .
At present the quarrel is a sort of three
j cornered one, or. .which, however, the
j cornerstone is 'the â¢: caricature 'â , which was
I perpetrated last Sunday evening. The al
| legÂ« d Crespi statement is not forgotten,
i however, and "â : in . its last ti night's i issue
! L'ltaliii in letters a quarter of an .inch'
high says i to Gori: 'If you have not the
courage and the "â ' honesty to deny ':â  the
statement 'SJETE UN BITGIARDO.'for
you have affirmed thines absolutely false.','
To translate the word "bugiardo" by the
| plain ordinary U one fof liar :is, to do the
power and significance of the â¢ appellation
an r injustice. It <: needs ; imagination -to
grasp the Baron ; Munchausen-like ? powers
of invention of a '"bueiardo." .â â â  . ...
But Gori ; seems to be too busy to heed
any of these things. hHe has determined
to give another "farewell" performance to
San Francisco in order that he may. put
on the stage 'i fresh ''types' of I the colony.
But if the caricatures last week lashed the
people of importance with whipi, those! to
be laved next week will lash them with
scorpions. â¢ : ... I^. 'â¢'.â  > ? t -â¢ -

UNITED AMONG LILIES
Fashionable Wedding of Miss
Hadenfeldt and Mr.
Coulter.
THE FORTNIGHTLY MEETS.
The Fechheimer Luncheonâ Brilliant
Theater Parties at the
Columbia.
The wedding of Miss Bertha Haden
feldt, daughter of Mr. and Mra. Charles
Hadenfeldt, and Clinton R. Coulter of
Marshtield, Ohio, was solemnized last
evening at 9 o'clock, at the First Presby
terian Church, on Van Ness avenue.
It has been some time since Dr. Mac
kenzie's church was the scene of so pretty
a wedding. Potted palms and growing St.
Joseph lilies decorated trie chancel. At
the"Â»ltar there had been erected an arch of
violets and roses, from which swung a
handsome wedding-bell. In the midst of
â  all the floral ioveliness the happy young
couple stood while Dr. Mackenzie read the
: impressive marriage service.
Promptly at 9 o'clock, the hour an-
nounced for the ceremony, the sweet, full
tones of the bridal chorus from "Lo
hengrin" announced the coming of the
bridal party.
First came the ushers, Messrs. Harry
Cosgriff, Crump, Ravelin and Herman
Hadenteldt, and directly following them
walked- the bridesniaidsâ Miss Lizzetta M.
Popp, Miss Pauline Van Gertzbach, Miss
Emma Feiseland Miss Wanda Hadenieldt.
Then came the maid of honor, Miss J.
Meta Hadenfeldt, and preceding the bride,
who entered leaning on the arm of her
father, walked a dainty little dark-eyed
beauty. Miss Lillian McCormiek, scatter
ing the path of the bride with fragrant
white violets and Cecile Bruner roses.
The groom and his best man, C. C. Coul
ter, met the bridal party at the altar.
After the ceremony the invited guests,
about fifty in number, accompanied the
bridal party to the Maple Hall at the
Palace Hotel, where an elaborate supper
was served.
The gowns of the bridal party -were ex
tremely handsome. The bride's dress was
fashioned of exquisite cream white satin.
The jupe was made en traine and the front
exquisitely embroidered with a large lovers'
knot, the curling ends of which were out
lined with orange blossoms and lillies of
the valley. The bridal veil tvas fastened
to the coiffure by a diamond crescent, the
gift of the groom.
The maid of honor, Miss Meta Haden
feldt, wore an eiegant gown of white bro
caded satin, the flaring skirt made per
fectly plain in the prevailing fasiiion. The
corsaue was cut low, the decolletage being
outlined by a band of ermine. MissÃader
feldt carried a bunch of American beauty
roses.
The bridesmaids were attired alike in
Nile green satin gowns, trimmed witn
chiffon, and carried bunches of pink carna
tions and maidenhair.
Mrs. Hadehfeldt, mother of tue bride,
wore an elegant toilet of Dresden silk and
olive velvet. The velvet panels on the
jupe. the Haring collar and deep cuffs
were elaborately embroidered with jewels.
Mr. and Mrs. Coulter received very many
eiegant presents and nianv more await
them on their arrival at their home in
Ohio.
The happy couple left this morning for
Del Monte, and after a short, stay will go
to iSan Jose for a two months' visit and
then proceed by easy stages to their East
ern home.
The regular meeting of the Fortnightlies
was held last evening at the residence of
Miss Minnie Houghton. 1414 Cali
fornia street. Mis* Houehton. with
her parents, is occupying th<i Younger
residence, one of the ho rues mostadmiia

feature of last evening's entertainment
was the living pictures arranged by Miss
Lillie Lawler, and representing scenes
and characters of the period of the great
Napoleon. The entertainment last even
ing was one of the most enjoyable of the
affairs of the fashionable club and a large

WORKERS FROM THE EAST
Three Ladies Who Will Toil for
the Good Samaritan Mis
sion. â¢
Miss Augusta Williams Finds a Singu
lar Absence of Slums in
This City.
Three lacTes from the East have Just es
tablished themselves quietly on Essex
street, not far from the Mission of the
Good Samaritan, with the intention of de- <
voting their lives to working among the â¢
poor of that parish.
The ladies are Miss Augusta H. Wil
liams, late of Hartford, Conn.. Miss Hollis
and Miss Woods. Miss Williams wis
formerly a parishioner of .Bishop Nichols
in the Last iml she is stated to have come j
to San Francisco with the intention of j
taking up a life work in connection with i
the Episcopalian church. Both Miss Wil- j
Hams and the two ladies who are her fel
low-laborers h^ve had considerable expe
rience in the kind of work they have just
taken up here, and it is expected that they
will prove invaluable auxiliaries to the Rev.
W. I. KiD.
Last Sunday Bishop Nichols held a j
special service at the oratory, dedicating [
the ladies to their work and asking ior a j
blessing on the fruits of their labor. Since :
then they have devoted their time to roak- :
ing acquaintance with the ]>eople who at
tend the mission, and have also struck out
on their own account to make new friends !
among the dwellers on Tar Fiat. The i
poorer and more Mttftlid a home the more :
willing these workers are to enter it and
win the friendship and sympathy of its in
mates, for it is their intention to make j
their home a sort of headquarters for all, j
especially Episcopalians, who are in need >
of sympathy or of a helping hand.
The first thin; that has struck Miss i
Williams in beginning her work in San j
Francisco is the apparent absence of any i
'Slum" class, such as she has been used to !
meeting in the East. At the Mission of
the Good Samaritan she has looked in
v;dn for any squalid worshipers, and so j
far she has not met with any harrowing
cases of poverty.
Although the work of Miss Williams and
her friends is only beginning with a
nucleus of three, it is intended to extend
the number of workers as time goes on.
Farly in the autumn the ladies will be
joined by a church-worker who is a trained i
nurse and wno will donate her time gratis
to attending to the wants of those who are
too poor to wnmre proper attention in
time of sickr.jess. Each worker is to have
her own sphere of usefulness, and it is I
expected that the new departure will
greatly strengthen the hands of Key. Mr.
Kip in his work.
Dr. XV. M. Favks Arrested.
Dr. William M. Parks, 21 Franklin street, was
arrested yenterday afternoon on a warrant
charging him with practicing medicine with
out a doctor's certificate.
The complaining witness is C. Hakonson, 125
Oak street.
His wife was so ill that Dr. Wadsworth was
cailed in to attend her. He is a member of the
State Board of Medical Examiners, and on
learning that Dr. Parks had previously treated
her he consulted all the lists of medical prac
titioners but could not find larks nanio, so lie
advised Hakonson to swear out a warrant for
Parks' arrest. The lntter lias retained J. N. K.
Wilson to defend him. He was released on
bonds.
Schooner Mary Sold.
Marshal Baldwin yesterday sold the schooner
Mary to H. C. Lassen for $1700. The vessel
formerly belonged to the Fortin Brick Com
pany and was sold by an order of the L'nked
Btfttea District Court to satisfy the claims of
creditors.
Don't Be Too I-;t!Â«Â« for the Steamer,
And don't omit when you are packing up your ef
fects preparatory for the voi-n^e to include among
them a supply of Hosietter's Stomach Bitters, the
great remedy for seasickness. Travelers for
pleasure or business seeking foreign climes, or who
locoraote by steamboat or train, besides yachtsmen
and mariners, testify to the remedial and prevent-'
lye efficacy of the bitters, which is incomparable
for nausea, headuche, dyspepsia, biliousness, rheu
matism, nervous and kidney trouble.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
Narrow Escape of the Steamers
Tiburon and Sausalito in
the Fog.
SEIZED SEALERS RELEASED.
A Rush of Vessels. Ail in a Hurry,
at the Merchants' Drydock
Yesterday.
The ferry steamers Tiburon and Sausa
lito were again nearly in collision. The
foe, as usual, was to blime, but both ves
sels hart a narrow escape. It happened
yesterday morning, and the Sausalito got
into the Tiburon'sslipbymistake. Captain
White, on the latter steamer, saw the
Sausalito just in time, and, reversing his
engines, stopped his vessel as she collided
gentiy with the Sausalito. Not over $25
worth of damage was done, and the
Tiburon was backed out and docked in
the freight slip. There was almost a
stampede on both steamers, but no one
was injured .
The ferry-boats left Tiburon and Sausa
lito about 7 a. m. on the first trip to San
Francisco. The fog being very heavy the
trip across the bay wa3 considerably de
layed. When off Washington-street wharf
both vessels b re down on the steamer
Arago which had two big spars projecting
astern. The Sausalito crossed her bow,
but Captain Wiison instead of making his
own landing ran into the Tiburon's.
Captain White had to stop his vessel in
order to allow the Arago to pass. When
lie reached his slip the Sausalito was there
and the troubte began. On the following
trio Captain White ran the Tiburon into
the freight slip asrain remarking at the
same time that as the fog was still heavy
he would give the Sausalito the choice
of two slips again.
The Treasury Department seems to be
playing a very peculiar game with the
sealing schooners Winchester and Bow
head. They were seized for not having
complied with the regulations and the trig
Hercules, to which the Wincnester trans
ferred her catch, was libeled. The case of
the Hercules was tried before United
States Commissioner Hfacock and was
dismissed, as there wos no breach of the
law proven. A bill releasing the two
schooners from liability was introduced in
Congress and passed. The Secretary of
the Treason yesterday sent word to re
lease buth schooners, but telegraphed that
the Wincnester would still be subject to
prosecution "for having transferred cargo
without a permit."
If the Winchester <vas euilty then the
Hercuies was also, but as the United States
Commissioner dismissed the case against
the hitter the decision of the Secretary of
the Treasury is, to say the least, peculiar.
Senator Perkins has interested himself
very much in the matter and sealing men
are loud in his praise. He is to see the
Secretary on the subject and expects to
have good news for the owners of the
schooners in a few days.
The schooner Mary", now lying in Oak
land Creek, was sold at auction by the
United States Marshal for $1750 to H. C.
Lassen yesterday. She was libeled by
l'eter Anderson and others for wages.
There was a ereat rush for accommoda
tion on the Merchants' drydock yesterday.
The steamer Novelty, steam schooner Del
Norte, steamer Dora, schooner Cliarles R.
Nelson, steamer i-'arallon and steam
schooner Crescent City were all in front of
ihe dock at once, and "all clamoring for ad
mittance. There was a wordy warfare and
the telephones were kept going for half an
hour, with the result that the Dora and
Farallon finally won the day and were
docked. The others will have to wait their
turn.
Foreman Burnham of the steam pile
drivers has finished the repairs to Main
street wharf. Over 500 piles have been
driven and the structure is now as good as
new. Folsom-stieet wharf will now be re
built, and in the meantime the Oceanic
Steamship Company will dock their steam
ers at Pacific-street "wharf.
The bark Richard 111 did considerable
damage at Folsom No. 2 wharf yesterday.
She was being hauled forward* to mate
room for the steamer Wellington. Her
stern line parted and her bowsprit crashed
through ihe coalounkers. The vessel's
headgear suffered.
Peterson's launch Amy towed a barge
and wlialeboat from the Naval Battalion's
boathouse to the steamer Pomona yester
day. They will be taken to Eureka for the
use of the company there.
Lieutenant-Commander Turner was a
passenger on the steamer. On his arrival
at Eureka lie will sv/ear in the new com
pany that has been added to the battalion
aiid will witness its first drill.
A team owned by J. P. Broderick of Cal
ifornia and Front 'streets very nearly went
overboard yesterday. J. Mulcahey, the
driver, was delivering a lot of groceries to
the brig Lurline and backed the wagon
on the staging. The Litter gave way
and the whole concern fell to an apron be
low. After some difficulty the horses and
driver were extricated, but almost the en
tire load of groceries went into the bay.
Pentecostal Services.
The Pentecostal services, which ended at the
Central Methodist EDlscopal Church on Tues
day night, proved unusually fertile in bring
ing new members into the church. Some of
the converts made by the evangelist Rev.
Joseph 11. Smith were admitted to church
membership last night. The last day's services
were of an all-day order. The cnurch was
crowded at each service.

packed with fair race-lovers yesterday, the
closing day of the two weeks' meeting.
The races were all well contested, nose
finishes being the general rule. The male
portion of the population was out in lib
eral numbers, and the bookies experienced
a most disastrous day. Favorites or sec
ond choices were successful throughout,
with one exception.
Undoubtedly the prettiest as well as the
most exciting finish was that at the con
clusion of the six-furlong handicap, when
Mobalaska, George Miller and Sam Leake
passed the wire short heads apart. Miller,
carrying 117 pounds, was an even-money
favorite in the betting, with Corrigan's
Indian-named filly a strong second choice.
When the barriar was raised Garner, on
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
Mobalaska, took his mount out in front,
with the favorite in close attendance.
While the two horses named were having
a battle royal through the stretch, Sam
Leake came with a great showing of speed,
the three horses flashing by the stand in
one of the proverbial blanket finishes. It
was so close that many were unable to
'place the Â»vinner, waiting until the num
bers were hoisted, which showed the ver
dict to be in favor of Mobalaska, with the
favorite in second place.
The stable of Burns & Waterhouse
carried off the purse in the two-year-old
event, a four and a half furlong sprint,
with Rowena B, a filly by imp. Maxim,
who won very handily from Dura, backed
down from 1 to 2>
The unlucky Walter J was again just
nipped out for the coin in the second event
at six furlongs. He and the 9to 5 favorite
fought it out the entire way. the favorite
winning by a nose. Tobey ran a good race,
finishing third.
There was no pronounced favorite in the
mile and a quarter hurdle handicap, threes
or better being always obtainable against
My Luck, Silverado and Hello. It proved
a very easy win for Hello, with W. Clancy
up, who passed Ba3sanio after taking the
second jump and won galloping. The I
place was captured by Bassanio in a drive
with the gray mare, ftelhe G.
W. B. Sink's mare Sister. Mary, who was
unfortunate in getting left at the post on
Tuesday, was a hot even-moneychoice for
the fifth race over seven furlongs, and ran |
unplaced. She was in the lead to the far j
turn, where Cabrillo headed her, and I
striking the stretch second, faded away to j
nothing. The finish was a repetition of |
the six-furlong handicap, Derfargilla the i
second choice. Cabrillo and the rank out- ;
sider Dungarven finishing heats on the
wire in the order named.
The wise ones were very badly fooled
over the result of the race following, also
at seven furlongs. Dan Honig's crack,
Magnet, looked to have a "'cinch" on the
purse, but he looked so big and high after
his long rest that after opening at 7 to 10
he receded in the betting to 7 and 8 to 1.
The big coin went in on Thelma, who
was backed down from 7 to 5 to Ito 2.
Magnet took the lead from Boreas, turning
into the back stretch and fighting, all the
way for his head, won with ridicnlons ease,
with Benham a head in front of Boreas for
the place.
Owner Honig scored another win in the
last race of the day, a six-furlong dash.
Charm was well played at 9 to 5, and slip
ping through next the rail on striking the
stretch for home, won by half a length
from the 20 to 1 chance Artist. Olive fin
ished in the show.
Turf and Paddock Items,
The sport was viewed yesterday by 5412
ladies.
The Bay District track reopens to-day
with the Gunst selling stake as the feature
of the card.
Starter Caldwell's departure necessitated
the appointing of a new manipulator of
the starting-gate. Yesterday Superinten
dent of Track Allen handled the lever and
sent the fields away in perfect order. A
the conclusion of the hurdle event he was
presented with a handsome Horal piece by
his manj- laay admirers.
The popular turfman, John
Brenock, who with his family has been
spending a portion of the winter in Cali
fornia," leaves for his home in Chicago* to
night.
in the carpenter-room of tne grand stand
at Ingleeide is a model of a starting
machine that is possibly destined to re
place the one at present in use. In con
struction and action it is similar to the
Australian invention, but its inventor
claims for it greater rapidity in the raising
6f the webbing and in its almost noiseless
working.
Eddie Jones is still riding in fine form.
He brought in three winners yesterday.
AMATEUR BOXING BOUTS
Men of Muscle Who Are in
Training for the Olympic
Tournament.
Joe Choynski Will Be Given an Op
portunity of Stopping Alex
Greggains.
The Olympic Club is making great prep
arations for its boxing carnival, which will
be held next month.
As previously stated, the preliminary
bouts will be held in the club's gymna
sium and the finals will be decided at the
Mechanics' Pavilion. The tournament
will terminate with a ten-round boxing
bout between two clever professional box
ers. It was rumored about the club yes
terday that Director Short had been in
correspondence with two of the cleverest
lightweight boxers in America and that
arrangements for their presence in the
ring on the evening of the final rounds
had been almost completed. The names
of the clever exponents of the "manly
art" will not be made public until the
match is consummated.
The National Athletic Club will give a
fistic bill-of-fare in April that should please
the most fastidious of sport-lovers, in the
language of the obese master of ceremonies,
liilly Jordan Esq., the event of the even
ing will he an tight-round contest between
Alexander Greggains and Joe Choynski.
The latter has agreed to take no part of the
purse which will be offered by the club in
case he fails to send his opponent to dream
land before the expiration of the limit
round. Greggains has accepted the terms
proposed by Choynski, and states that if
ex-Champion Corbett's old opponent can
accomplish such a trick he (Greggains)
will retire from the ring and join the large
and disconsolate army of "has-been"
pugilists.
* Ihe Colma Athletic Club, which, meta
phorically speaking, was buried by the
Supervisors of San" Mateo (Jaunty 'some
months ago, has arisen from the ashes, md
commencing next month boxing con
tests of twenty rounds will be held occa
sionally at the country rendezvous.
Yesterday Barney Farley, "the man of
wonderful discoveries," held a conference
with Charles (Parson) Dayies at the Bald
win Hotel. Farley, who is the manager of
the sturdy little Jimmy Anthony of Aus
tralia, is anxious to pit his change in a con
test of t.venty rounds against Jimmy Barry
of Chicago. The managers of the two
noted pugilists held quite a lengthy dis
cussion but nothing definite in the match
making way was arrived at. It is quite
probable, however, that a match between
the two fighters will be consummated in
the near future.
The proposed match between Alexander
Qreggains and Joe Choynski has fallen
through .
At 11 o'clock la.*t evening "Parson"
Davies, ,T. Gibbs and Tom Sharkey held a
private conference and Sharkey was sub
stituted for Greggains. The "agreement
entered into between Sharkey and Davies
is the same as was drawn upforGrepgains;
that is, Choynski to win must stou Sharkey
in eight rounds. The match will take
place in this City some time in the latter
part of April.
The San Francisco Athletic Club gave
an excellent exhibition lastevenine, which
consisted of boxing, wrestling and club
swinging by members.
It is stated that there were 2893 human
being? killed by tigers, leopards, hyenas
and panthers in India during the year
1894, find in the same year the same spe
cies of beasts, aided by fenakes, killed 97,
--371 head of cattle. The number of human
lives destroyed by snakes in India in 1894
was 21,538. The number of wild beasts
killed in the same year was 13,447 and the
number of snakes 102,210.
It is said that there never is an odd num
ber of rows on an ear of corn.
TOM HILL DINES AT HOME
The Famous Painter of Wawona
Back From His Tour
in the South.
TWO PICTURES FOR CHICAGO.
He Will Go Into Yosemite as Soon as
the Stageroad Is Open
to Travel.
Thomas Hill, the widely known Pacific
Coast artist, whose studios here and at
Wawona are well known to thousands of
travelers over the world, dined at home
last evening after a prolonged absence.
He has been at Coronado and Pasadena
since early in the year, and has recovered
his health almost entirely.
"I was an invalid when I went south."
he said. "I had the grip, the rheumatism
and I don't know bow many other ills,
but I am now sound and well, except for a
little rheumatism that catches me once in
a while. I was at Coronado a good while
Thomas Hill, the Noted Artist of the Yosemite, Who Dined Home Yesterday.
[From a sketch for "The Call" made by himself.]
and then came up to Pasadena, and after
that I went to Mount Lowe, up Professor
Lowe's strange railroad that crawls up the
mountain at an angle of sixty degrees. It's
a grim and awful ride, but pays you well.
Yet it shakes you up a bit. Think of the
abruptness â sixty degrees. It's enough to
make anybody squirm.
"I am preparing as rapidly as possible
to go to the Yosemite again. I want to
get in on the snow. I always feel better
when lam up there. I will go not later
tban April 1. The stage company expects
to have the road open by that time.
"There is an enormous number of East
ern visitors in Southern California, and
they are coming in every day. All the
towns are full. I never saw so many
people there before. There ought to be
a great many Tip here during the remainder
of the spring."
Mr. Hill says he has been doing little
with his brush during his absence, his pur
pose when be went being to rest as much
as possible. He made a pair of Yosemite
pictures for W. 0. Carpenter, a wealthy
resident of Chicago, bat beyond these he
scarcely touched canvas. For these pic
tures Mr. Carpenter paid $1000 each.
HASTE 18 NECESSARY.
Get the Introductory Seta of the. New
Encyclopedic Dictionary.
The few introductory sets of the new
dictionary which the Pacific Coast News
paper Syndicate is distributing will have
been exhausted in a very few days and the
splendid volumes sent on their mission of
enlightenment. It was a liberal and saga
cious move on the part of the syndicate to
thus place a number of sets in cultured
homes in order that tne work might be
compared with other dictionaries and
cyclopaedias.
There is' nothing like "ocular proof"
when it is desired to demonstrate the supe
riority of one book over another, and this
principle was also applied in opening syn
dicate headquarters at 36 Montgomery
street, where tne volumes could be in
spected at leisure. The place has been
thronged each day by those who were de
sirous of securing the work at the excep
tionally low price and on the extremely
easy terms of payment arranged for the
introductory sets.
After these are gone the regular sub
scription price will prevail. It will make
its possession more difficult for people of
moderate means. In a very few days the
introductory sets will have been claimed,
and the distribution of the work, except
by subscription, will be closed. Readers,
therefore, must hurry to take advantage of
the opportunity, which is not likely again
to be presented.
WENT AS A STOWAWAY
George Doctor, Who Defrauded
M. A. Gunst, Now on the
High Seas.
The Son of a Milwaukee Millionaire,
but a Black Sheep of the
Family.
When the Pacific Mail steamship China
sailed from this port on Saturday last for
Yokohama and Hongkong she carried one
passenger who wa9 not down on the ship's
books as having engaged a stateroom or
paid his passage in advance.
Aided by a few sympathizing friends
and an ex-employe of the company, who
knew the remote nooks and corners of the
ship thoroughly, he stole on board the
night before the big China liner cast off
her lines, and, with a few necessities to
make himself comfortable, stowed away
in a place where he hoped to be secure
until the pilot had left the ship and the
shores of America were growing dim
against the eaeteru horizon.
The stowaway was George Doctor, the
son of a Milwaukee millionaire, who
gained fame and unenviable notoriety
through his crooked operations on this
coast and his flight half around the world
with detectives in the employ ot Police
Commissioner Gunst on his trail.
Doctor was one of Gunst's trusted em
ployes and traveled from one end of the
Pacific Coast to the other, selling the Com
missioners' pet brands of cigars. While in
Los Angeles, about two years ago, he met a
member of the demimonde who fascinated
him and he so far forgot his sense of hon
esty as to collect $3500 owing his employer
by Michael Pollasky of Los Angeles and
to flee with his charmer. When the theft
was discovered Mr. Gunst at once sent de
tectives on his track and traced him to
Europe, where he was traveling and spend
ing nis ill-gotten gains. After awhile
Doctor's companion forsook him, and, his
funds giving out, he returned to America
and landed in New York just in time to
meet the Police Commissioner's agents,
who arrested him and took him to Los An
geles for trial. Doctor appealed to his
father in nis hour of tribulation, and rather
than see his son go to jail the wealthy
parent came to his son's rescue and made
good the amount that Pollasky had been
compelled to refund to Gunst. At the
trial there was little evidence for the pros
ecution and Doctor was acquitted.
Tlien he returned to San Francisco and
led a Bohemian exiotence for several
months. ' Lately he has been in hard luck
and decided to try to go to some place
where? his misdeeds were not known to
begin life anew. Lack of funds stood in
his way, however, and he was unable to
get away until he hit upon the plan of
stowing away on a China steamer as a
means of reaching the European colonies
of Japan and China.
He was aided in his project by friends,
whom he had known in his palmy days,
and they furnished him with clothes and
money to carry him for a short time when
he should land in the Orient.
He had $25 and a new suit of clothes
when he shipped on board the China, and
as he did not show up in his accustomed
haunts after the steamer was at sea his
friends knew that he was well on his v.ay
to the country where he expects to make a
new start in fife.
Doctor is well educated and was given
every opportunity in early life to carry out
a successful career. His friends hope that
he will make a man of himself where his
misdoings are unknown.
NATIONAL GUARD VETERANS.
A Committee Appointed Lant Night to
Secure New Qnarterg.
An animated meeting of the Veterans of i
the National Guard was held at the Ellis- |
street armory last night.
The special object of the meeting was the
consideration of an invitation to vacate. â¢:
For a long time past the Veterans have
used a room in the Ellis-street armory for
their meeting place and the best of har
mony prevailed, many members of the
companies In the building also belonging ;
to the Veterans.
But there came a time when the Signal
Exterior of W. B. Bourn's Handsome New Residence on Weljster Street, Between
Broadway and Pacific.
[Drawn from the plans of (he architect, Willis Poll;.]
Corps of Company F needed the room, and !
hence this meeting.
Major Tilden presided and being a mem- i
her of both the Veterans, of the National I
Guard and Company F, his opening re- i
marks were in good "taste and highly con- j
dilatory.
Short speeches were made by Colonels !
Barn-, Taylor, Bush, Burns/ Burdick, !
Captain Pike and others prior to and afler
a motion was made to accept an offer from '
Company F to use a room on the upper j
Hour at a rental of $10 a month.
The motion called forth a heated inter- i
change of idens on the head of militia eti- |
quette and fraternal good-Fellowsinp. Two j
hours were consumea in debate, at the end I
of which time a motion was made and car- j
ried for the appointment of a committee of !
three to look after the securing of a room
farther downtown and report at the next ;
meeting.
Colonels Bush, Barry and Burdick were !
appointed on the committee.
The meeting adjourned until next
Wednesday night, at which time the com
mittee will submit its report.
The number of paid admissions to the
Columbian Fair was 21,477,218, a daily
average of 119,984^. The gross attend
ance was 27.529,400, exceeding by nearly
1.000.000 the number at the Paris Exposi
tion for the six months ending with Oc
tober.
SAVED BY THE COACHMAN
Exciting Runaway of a Maddened
Four-in-Hand on Market
Street.
STOPPED BY THE FENCE.
J. Talbot Clifton's Coaching Party
Narrowly Escapes Disasterâ A
Driver's Skill.
J. Talbot Clifton was the central figure
of an exciting incident on Market street at
1 o'clock yesterday morning. His four
in-hand ran away, and it was only through
I the skill of the driver that a serious aetu
j dent was averted. There were two ladies
I and two men on top of the coach,
j while Clifton and lady a companion
rode within. The driver, who proved
to be a very skillful person with the rib
bons, was the regularly employed coach
man of the English nobleman.
The coach, drawn by four spirited horses,
rattled o/er the cobblestones at a terrific
rate, and the noise awoke unoffending
citizens from their slumbers. The
horses began running at Fifth street, and
increased their speed as Sixth was ap
proached. They ran from one sida of Mar
ket street to the other, and the coach
! swayed and rocked until it almost toppled
I over.
There was great excitement among those
who witnessed the runaway, as every
second it was expected that there would
be an upset. But the driver was cool and
sKillful, and he turned the corner at
Seventh street, came within an ace of run
nine over a number of people who were
leaving a dance then in progress at Odd
Fellows' Hall, and finally brought the
animals to a standstill by running them
against the big fence that incloses the new
postoffice lot at Mission and Seventh
streets.
When the coach stopped the' frightened
women jumped to the ground, and it was
some time before they recovered from the
shock. Mr. Clifton, however, was' as cool
as an iceberg, and finally prevailed on bis
timid companions to continue the early
morning drive.
THE NEW BOURN HOUSE
Novel and Handsome Features
in Private Residence Con
struction.
Faced With Dark Blue Clinkner
Brick and Ornamented With
English Sandstone,
The first or basement story of the
handsome new residence of W. B. Bourn
on Webster street, between Broadway and
Pacific, has been completed and on the
upper story some of the dark blue hard
baked bricks have been set in, giving a
foretaste of the highly artistic effect that
wiil be produced when the building is
finished.
Next to the palatial residence that Claus
Spreckels is building on Van Ness avenue
the Bourn residence will be, perhaps, the
handsomest one in the City â or at least
one of two or three upon the relative
artistic merits of which even architects
and artists have a right to disagree.
There are some novel features in the
Bourn residence. It will be faced with
dark blue clinkner bricks, extremely
rough, while the corners will be of red
stock brick. The nornices, moldings and
ornamentation will be of brown sandstone
that was brought here from England as
ballast. The sandstone is of a peculiar
grade of fineness and firmness, the same,
in fact, of which Melrose Abbey was con
structed 500 years ago. The roof tiles will
he of the same dark blue color as the. body
bricks.
The characteristic effect of the exterior
will be its tall gables and chimneys, which
will be 63 feet in height, or more than half
as high as the Palace Hotel.
So far, the construction contracts that
have been let amount to $25,000, hut these
are exclusive of the interior-finishing work.
This is the first residence in San Francisco
to be designed with the English basement
plan. Ti.e main entrance being in this
basement, it opens on each side into recep
tion-rooms. At the end of the basement
corridor is the erand staircase, with laree
windows on the landing. The balance of
the basement is devoted to kitchen, ser
vants' hall, laundry, pantry, storerooms,
furnace-rooms, etc.
The entire front of the main floor is a
grand salon, a room 25x46 feet. There
is also a lar^e hallway on this floor, a din
ing hall, library, conservatory, dining
room and pantry. The dining-room, li
brary, conservatory and salon look out
upon a large private garden. On the sec
ond floor are the bedchambersâ five of
themâ each of which has connecting dress
ing and toilet rooms. There will be a
handsomely treated hallway running the
entire If-ngth of the second floor, upon
which the chambers open. This will be
finished in groined vaults or intersecting
arches. In the attic are two guest cham
bers and five servants' rooms.
Willis Polk is the architect. He has ex
hausted some gray matter on the design,
and the Bourn residence promises to be a
lasting ornament to the City.

ERIE MEDICAL CO., BUFFALO.N.Y.BISHOP LEMMENS HERE
The Prelate of Vancouver Isl
and Returns From
Mexico.
THREE MONTHS; ON HORSEBACK
His Grace Traveled Through Jalisco
and Confirmed 23,000
Persons.
Bishop Lemmens of Vancouver Island is
in this City on his homeward journey from
Mexico after an absence of five months in
the southern Republic. He is a guest of
the Paulist Fathers in their residence at
St. Mary's Church on California street.
During his stay in Mexico Bishop Lem
mens went out of the beaten track, and
saw much that is new to other lands. As
a result of his careful observation of
Mexico and the Mexicans he unhesitat
ingly declares that the country is badly
understood in the United States, and is in
fact maligned by many travelers.
His grace had more than one interesting
experience in his travels, most of which
were in the State o Jalisco, on the Pacific
Coast.
"I went to Mexico in response to an in
vitation to attend the coronation of the
picture of Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe,"
he said. "This ceremony took place on
October 12, and was regarded as such a
great event that many thousands of people
gathered at Guadalupe, near the City of
Siexico, to attend the ceremonies. Not
one-third of the crowds could get into tbe
immense chnrch. It was certainly an im
pressive spectacle. The crown was about
two fe_et high and was beautifully fash
ioned in figures, coats of arms and floral
designs. It cost over $100,000, and was
made of cold and precious stones. Eight
ladies carried it up to the altar, and when
it was placed over the head of the virgin
the whole conjugation shouted, 'Viva ia
Virgin Mejicana!' and they clapped their
handsâ a most remarkable'thing for Mexi
cans, who were always quiet in church.
"After the coronation ceremonies I went
to Guadalajara, in the State of Jalisco.
Arc'u bishop Loza at that city is very old â
about 82 yearsâ and could not travel over
his diocese, so I went through Jalisco ad
ministering confirmation. In three and a
half months I confirmed 23,000 persons.
My work was in 'the backwoods,' where I
had to travel on horseback, as the roads
were not fit for wagons. The country was
frightfully rough, and traveling over it
tired one more than you could imagine.
The people there I found most devout and
intensely Catholic. Their manner of re
ceiving tne bishop was characteristic.
They would come out of the villages to
meet me, 200 men or more on horseback
and thousands of people afoot. They
would cheer and strew the street with
flowers, and in one place, where oranges
seemed to be growing everywhere, those
people covered the ground with oranges
that the procession might pass over them.
"The people of Mexico have been grossly
misrepresented in the United States. They
REV. JOHN N. LEMMENS, D.D., BISHOP OF VANCOUVER ISLAND, B. C.
have been accused of being ignorant, Su
perstitious and of living in darkness. I
lound them very nice people, intelligent,
honest and deeply religious. They nave
very good schools and plenty ot them free
throughout the lann. For* instance, in
Guadalajara there are 100 schools, half of
which are free. The Sisters of the Sacred
Heart have an immense institution in Mex
ico, where they have boarders at school,
day scholars, poor children and orphans.
I went through these schools, and all the
classes were full of children. These sis
ters have many institutions of learning
and charity throughout Mexico. In the
City of Mexico there is an excellent school
for the deaf and dumb and blind.
"All the people seemed anxious for Diaz
for President. They wanted him to con
tinue at the head of the nation, and in this
e<Mjtiment there seemed to me to be prac
tically no dissent, for Catholics were
united with the ether party on this point.
Tliey were all very anxious that the coun
try should progress in peace under his
leadership. They don't want revolution
any more and they know that he can give
them cominued peace.
"They are going to have a Papal Dele
gate, Monsignor Averardi, a Bishop who
will occupy the same relative position as
Monsignor Satolli in the United State?.
He is "known as 'Visitador, ' but will have
jurisdiction over the church in Mexico.
Most likely he will remain at Tacubaya,
iiear the city of Mexico, where a wealthy
gentleman has placed a palace at his dis
p ittL
â 'Tbere are twenty-eight Bishops and
Archbishops in Mexico. In the arch
diocese of Guadalajara there are 6oo priests
end over 2,000,000 Catholic communicants,
with Bishops at Tepic and Coliraa. Tbere
nre 40,000 to 60,000 Catholics in each parish
there.",
Bishop Lemmens broke bis ankle about
'ti\en months aeo and is still lame. He
was asked how tie could have traveled over
the mountains on a horse for four months
with a broken limb but partly healed.
"Oh, in the saddle it did not pain meâ
(hat is. much." he replied, smiling.
"Sometimes l rode twoâ three days at a
stretch, tbrougti ravines and over moun
tain trails. Tnen I would be a little lame
ftt night after ceiting out of the saddle.
There, you see, I'm a little lame yet,"' as
be limped toward the <ioor.
Bishop Lemmens will return to his dio
jese after a brief rest in this City.
Firfl on O'Farrell Street.
At 1 o'clock this morning a fire was discov-
ered in a cellar under a saloon in the Orpheum
building on O'Fafrell street and an alarm was
sounded from box 98. It was caused by two
crossed electric wires. Damage about $1000.
RESEMBLES QUEEN LIL.
Either the Lady or Her Double, and
Flaying a Game of Hide and
Go Seek.
A strange story was in circulation yes
terday that Queen Liliuokalani of Hon
olulu had arrived here and that she was
occupying a suite of rooms at the Palace
preparatory to leaving for Europe. Before
evening the story had gained apace and
several people were sure they had seen
this lady at the caravansary or her double.
The double was so exact a reproduction of
the deposed Queen that the observeis, do
what they would, ccfuld not rid themselves
of the conviction that it was really the
Queen.
While the hotel was reasonably well
represented with persons who had seen
the alleged Queen there were outside per
sons who were equally sure of it. A man
called at Attorney Richards' office early
in the day and said that Mrs. Dominis,
otherwise the ex-Queen, had arrived on
the previous day's steamer incog., and
was, as the former report had it, going to
Europe.
Another story even had it that the lady
came on the Alameda. As the Alameda
reached here on Thursday last much
industry would necessarily have to be
shown by her and her friends to keep the
knowledge of her so long in the back
ground. It is, of course, no secret that the
Queen was to come to America and so on
across the Atlantic. That has been known
for some time.
In addition to all this two attaches of
the hotel are certain the Queen is there,
though three times as many other
attaches are sure she is not on any of the
floors.
"Why, I certainly saw a dark-skinned,
portly lady, wit ha massive face, large, dark
eyeÃ and thick blark hair going in and out
kere several times," said one. "I have seen
her for fully three days, and I meant to ask
â who she was. I said to myself, 'Why, that
lady looks like the pictures of this here
Queen out here at Honolulu. She
looked to be about 40 or 50 years old, and
was very heavily built. She's here all
right enough in this here hotel some
where."
The second story was this: "Why, I saw
her to-night. She was seated on that chair
over there fora moment, and then she got
up and walked around with a white lady
attired in a light-colored dress.' Other
attaches of the hotel claimed that the real
Queen could not be there.
RICHMOND SEWERS.
The Piping Ia Choked and the Sewage
Backs Up in the Residents'
Backyards.
The property-owners in the vicinity of
California street and Twelfth avenue are
, anxiously waiting for the Board of Health
'to move in their direction. Last Friday
| that body was notified that the sewers in
! that locality were in a deplorable condition
and fast becoming a nuisance, and Dr.
Lovelace notified the complainants that
! an inspector would investigate the next
day. Five days have passed and the in
| spector has not appeared.
The story of those sewers is an oft-told
I tale. Last June the pipe running along
; Twelfth avenue, from Lake to California,
! was laid by Contractor J. J. Flynn. Ihe
i work, according to the statement of J. J.
Bailly, J. B. Dittelbaeh and fourteen
others, was poorly done.
The sewer was at first refused by the
Street Commissioner, but afterward ac
cepted. Now the sewage backs through
the side sewers into the premises of annm
ber of the property -owners, and they
will have to open the pipes and dip holes
for cesspools in their backyards. The
whole system in that vicinity is becoming
choked and useless.
J. J. Bailly, whose neat little cottage is
fast becoming uninhabitable because the
Board of Health cannot possibly find Rich
mond district, stated last evening that the
sewer was badly laid.
"Contractor Flynn did not put it in deep
enough in the first place," said he. "At
the crossing the pipe strikes the manhole
too low down, and the workmen did not
remert the joints togetiier. 80 the sewer
is choked up with sand and there is no
outlet into California street. I can't keep
my family here if something is not done.
"1 have lost five days from my business
waiting for the Health Inspector to come
out and take a look at the nuisance. The
sewage from the house across the street
comes un in my back yard, and I have to
shovel it over my fence to get rid of it.
We'll all be sick here if that sewer is not
dug up and laid right. I can't understand
how such work was ever accepted by Ash
worth."
The signers to the long petition that was
sent to the Hoard of Supervisors were: J.
J. Baily. J. B. Dittelbach, John Porteous,
Edward Chatman, Mrs. May Martin, J. D.
Hoist, Charles Rushton, b. D. McDonald,
Leon F. Bailly, M. W. Cantrey, J. Craig;,
D. EoteJli, John Gatto, Mrs. Demnrtim,
Mrs. Esther Rosener and George F. Lyon.
The Smro Primary School is within a block
of the defective sewer district.
With Their Boots Off.
"A man killed on the railroad never dies
with his boots on," remarked a Reading
Railroad employe at Wayne Junction yes
terday morning." In my experience of over
twenty years I have seen, perhaps, over a
hundred cases where people have been
struck and killed by engines, and in every
Initance when the body was picked up the
feet were found to be minus shoes. Even
men wearing heavy top boots are not ex
empt from the invariable rule. Any old
engineer will tell you the same thing. It
is a mystery which nobody seems able to
solve." â Philadelphia Record.
A sharp nope pointing forward is the
characteristic of impudence and curiosity.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
THE MISSION MASONS
Will Erect an Elegant Temple
on Mission Street, Near
Twenty-Second.
FROM A FEW TO HUNDREDS.
Remarkable 'Growth of the Mystic
Craft in the City's Sunny
Belt.
In addition to the many other prospec
tive improvements about to be inaugurat
ed in the sunbelt of the Mission the Ma
sonic fraternity of that section have under
consideration the erection of a handsome
Masonic building in which the different
James A. Wilson, Worshipful Master of Mission Masonic Lodge.
[Drawn from a photograph.]
lodges may meet in the performance of
their mystic and fraternal rites.
Mission Masonic Lodge No. 169 was char
tered on the 13th of October, 1864, with tne
following-named officers: Edson Samrais,
worshipful master; Nathan W.Spaulding,
senior warden; John Ahem, junior war
den; James "Welch, treasurer; Daniel
Hanlon, secretary; Alexander Elon,
senior deacon ; Mortimer Hopkins, junior
deacon; Frank A. Rutherford and Irvin
S. Lamb, stewards, and Joseph McQuoid,
tyler.
The lodge at the time of its charter had
only twenty-one members, and among
that number there are but a few now liv
ing probably. N. W. Spauldinij and
Frank McCoppin, the latter going in at
that time as an enter-apprentice Mason,
are the only two positively known to the
present members to be living in San Fran
cisco.
Since the date of Its charter Mission
Lodge has flourished both in members and
in finance. It has now 400 members in
good standing with an excellent set of
officers.
The present worshipful master, James
A. Wilson, is a contractor and builder and
to his foresight, pluck and enterprise,
Mission Lodge will in the near future very
largely owe its own building. It will be
located on the west side of Mission street,
between Twenty-second and Twenty-third,
backing up against Emanuel "Baptist
Church, which faces on Bartlett street.
The actual sale of the proposed site for
this new edifice has not as yet been con
summated. The transfer must be ap
proved of by the Probate Court, inasmuch
as the estate belongs to the heirs of Eliza
O'Connor, but a deposit has been made
and the sale, with the approval of the
Superior Judge, may be considered a
finality.
On this site an elegant three-story brick
building, with all modern improvements,
will be erected at a cost of about $40,000.
Plans and specifications will be Drepared
at once after the confirmation and the work
pushed ahead with vigor, as the lease
which the lodge now holus on the building
at Valencia and Sixteenth streets will ex
pire in June,J.B9T.
The present officers of this lodge are:
Andrew Christmsen, senior warden; Wil
liam H.Cobb, junior warden ; C. D. F.unker,
secretary, and C. Flack, treasurer, and are
most earnest co-laborers in the contem
plated enterprise with Mr. Wilson. These
officers, with the 400 members, will take
more than ordinary pride in leaving to
their brethren a building that will be use
ful to themselves and their followers of the
mystic tie, as well as an ornament to the
Mission district.
MISSION MASS-MEETING
Spontaneous Activity Evinced by
Progressive Southside Prop
erty-Owners.
Intellect, Wealth and Votes Are Ex
pected to Make Themselves Felt
at Last.
A spontaneous leaven of activity has un
doubtedly taken hold of the progressive
and public-spirited property-owners in the
Sunshine Valley, known as the Mission or
the warm belt.
The inactivity of by-gone days has fled
and the people who have been contributing
$2,000,000 in taxes on an assessed valuation
of $96,000,000 annually for a number of
years, the greater proportion of which
went to beautify and improve their far
away neighbors' homes, are aroused in
their own interests.
They ask tbat their portion of the city
be recognized in the shape of a small ap
propriation. They want, a High School
for their grown-up children and a two
block park for their wives and children,
without being compelled to contribute a
day's earnings' to the railroad monopoly
for the privilege of enjoying a few hours'
recreation in their own playground-
Golden Gate Park.
The residents of Sunshine Valley are
justly prond of the splendid climate in
which they live, and with that unseltish
ness so characteristic of their generous na
ture they do not wish to fence themselves
in on ail sides, and by so doing prevent
others from enjoying similar boons. With
this object in view they desire that Sun
shine \ alley be made as attractive as pos
sible, so that families in quest of pleasant
homes, instead of crossing the bay to Oak
land, Berkeley, San Rafael or b'ausaiito,
can locate in the footsteps of the ear'y
missionaries, who seldom if ever erred in
selecting the loveliest sections for their
permanent camping grounds.
To obtain something of what they claim
to be their equal share of the distribution
of the public funds, a mass-meeting of the
progressive property-owners of the Mission
has been called for next Saturday evening
at Guerrero and Twentieth streets. This
spontaneous action has been brought
about by a consultation of such active and
public-spirited property-owners as Judge
Van Reynegom, ex - Supervisor C. W.
Taber, John H. Grady, A. B. Maguire, Dr.
L. Bush, George D. Shadburne, Joseph
Scheerer, James D. Phelan, Dr. John H.
Dawson, Daniel Sewell, Dr. Charles Clin
ton, Joseph O'Connor, Dr. James H.
Hunter.
The members of the Noe Improvement
Club, the High School Association, re
cently formed, and others have pooled
their issues and will join together with
one purpose in view, and in this manner
they expect to gain recognition from not
only the Board of Supervisors, but the en
tire community on the northern side of
the divide.
For as one of the moving spirits said,
"We have the wealth, the intellect and
the votes to make somebody pay attention

FOLSOM-STREET WORK.
The Railroad Company Will Offer No
Obstacle to the Improvement.
The executive committee of the South
side and Folsom-street Improvement Club
held a meeting last night. A committee,
consisting of G. 8. Center, 0. B. Maguire,
F. W. McEwen and J. Schwartz, reported
that C. F. Crocker had been interviewed,
lie assured the committee that the rail
road would present no obstacle to the exe
cution of McDonald's contract for hitu
menizinir Folsom 9treet.
The petition for the balance of the ap
propriation for paving Folsom street, be
tween Third and Sixth, will come up before
the Street Committee to-day. A committee
was appointed to attend.
It was also decided to call a meeting of
property-owners between Third and Ninth
on next Wednesday evening to take steps
toward reducing the width of the side
walks from 19 feet G inches, the present
width, to 15 feet, in conformity with the
rest of the street from Ninth street out.
Dr. Rottanzi, J. M. Strauss, J. Rafferty,
Leon Samuels and Joseph Kelly were ap
pointed a committee of arrangements. JÂ£Â£J
VISITED HOG RANCHES.
A Committee of the Board of Snpervt-
gors Has Its liven Opened.
A committee of the Supervisors consist
ing of Messrs. King, Dunker, Wagner and
Hobbs, accompanied by Health Oflicer
Lovelace and Health Inspectors Duren
and Kenney, visited a number of hog
ranches m the Bay View district yester
day to ascertain whether or not the places
that have been complained of are a public
nuisance.
A terrible condition of affairs was found
in a majority of the places visited and a
number of the Supervisors expressed them
selves as satisfied that a nuisance exists
and that it should be abated.
, Particular attention was paid to a ranch
at Athens and Georgia streets where the
stench was almost unbearable. A report
I will be rendered at the meeting of the
board on Monday next.
An Knglish Characteristic.
A Canadian writes to remind Americans
thit the north pole belongs to Canada.
He recalls the Englishman in Utah who
stuck his finger in Salt Lake, tasted it, and
exclaimed, "Why, I've come to the British
possessionsâ this water is salt!" These
Canadians are capable of claiming the
north star because their north polo points
toward' it. There is something admirable,
sublime, about this tendency of the Brit
ish possessions to extend themselves auto
matically. "The Listener" once knew
some English peopie who emigrated to
Chicago. They had a young cousin who
was an officer in the English army. Be
iore they left home in England this young
officer came to tell the girls of the family
good-by. Hs was a nice boy, and an old
playmate, and the girls were inclined to
be tearful. "We shall never see you
again," they said. "Oh, nonsense!' said
he, "onr regiment may be ordered out to
Chicago at any time." He didn't mean
conquestâ he simply thougiit Chicago was
in the British possessions.â Boston Tran

Vest's Parliamentary Inquiry.
Mr. Vest of Missouri was making a
speech in the Senate yesterday, when lirst
Mr. Peffer arose and began to speak, and
then Mr. Sherman, all three addressing
the chair at the same time. Mr. Vest
' looked amazed, and after a minute's hesi
tation, called out:
"Mr. President, Mr. President."
The president paid no attention to Mr.
Vest, however, when the Missouri member
changed his tactics by declaring his desire
to make a parliamentary inquiry. This
appeal was not lost an thÂ« president.
"The gentleman from Missouri will state
it," he said, ignoring Mr. Peffer and Mr.
Sherman.
â¢â¢I believe I was addressing the Senate
and had the floor," said Mr. Vest, "but it
seems that 1 have no longer got it. If I
can't get it any other way 1 rise to a par
liamentary inquiry to find out how I lost
it."
There was a ripple of laughter in the
chamber, Mr. Sherman apologized for bis
interruption and Mr. Vest continued to
hold the fort.â Washington Post.
BOBTAILS DEEMED BLOTS
Relics ol the Past Seen on Mar
.ket, Montgomery and San
some Streets.
A CALL FOR THEIR REMOVAL.
Why the "To Lets" Adorn the Win
dowsâBituminized Pave*
ments Wanted.
If the business people along Market,
Montgomery and Bansome streets could
awaken some morning and fail to see those
ghosts of a past ageâ the bobtail horse
car â wandering across their vision they
would feel that they were indeed in the
latter part of the nineteenth century. But
no such awakening comes to them, at
least not yet.
Electric-cars thread the modernly paved
suburban thoroughfares reaching out into
the country, but through the thickest and
richest portion of the City amble the
single-horse affairs that were longing for
a well-earned rest twenty years ago. The
inhabitants of Market, Montgomery and
Sansome streets are asking themselves
why they should be left out of the march of
progress while the newer north, west and
south, and even the east, have been pro
vided for. But the question is oldâ almost
aÂ«old as a bobtail-car â and has been await
ing an answer for, 10, these many years.
Market street has been taken better
care of than the other two streets, but
that great thoroughfare also needs re
pairs.
At intervals during the day a dilapi
dated affair drawn by a single horse
trundles wearily out of Fourth street,
and another of like character escapes
out of Sixth, into Market. They are relics
of the '70' s crawling into the'9o's. The
cable-trains go clanging by, hurrying away
lrom the uncanny visitants, ami even the
trucks and other vehicles give them a
wide berth. But the modern Market
street is too fast for theee Rip Van Winkles
of twenty years of sleep ana they dip out
of the whirling current into Montgomery
and Sansome streets. Then they trundle
eieenily along until they disappear around
the blocks where there* are so many signs
of "to let" in the distance.
"If Mr. Vining could only be made to
see,' 1 said a prominent Market-street mer
chant yesterday, "that anything out a
dead car service on Montgomery street
would recompense his company, the people
of that thoroughfare would not be left out
altogether and we would not be visited
by those old bobtail eyesores traveling
along from Sixth to Sansome.
"Between those two streets on Market
is the liveliest part of the City. It is
crowded all the time with every descrip
tion of vehicle. The cable-cars running
thickly on their double tracks take up the
most of the street and those miserable
horse affairs most of the rest of the road
way. The horsecars do not run often
enough to be so great a nuisance, but the
rails are. Those side-street horsecar sys
tems could all transfer to Market and
i otherwise keep out of it altogether. Market
street has grown out of the bobtail age and
| very soon the electric-car, with the under
| ground wire?, will roll there."
Mr. Dohrniann, president of the Mer
chants' Association, stated yesterday that
he was trying to see his way through the
"Kearny-st'reet transfer proposition and
could not take up any other question just
yet.
"After we have got Kearny street into
the great Market-Street system, we may
take up Montgomery street. It certainly
needs a service, for it has hone now. Good
streetcars bring business, as every business
person knows."
"We might do without the cars," said
a member of a big real estate
firm, "but we must have Montgomery
street bituminized. I say we might do
without the cars, because we have been
doing without them for a long time. Nobody
rides here in them. They just roll along
to hold the franchise down. Here are
three big hotels always crowded, and I'll
venture not a landlord ever directs his
guests into a Montgomery-street car. It
would be an insult. They take the cross-
Mtreet cables, or go to Kearny street. It
would not be so if we had a car service
here. But car or no car, we want these
old cobble-stones dng out and a smooth
pavement put down."
"Montgomery street must have a mod
ern car service," said Henry P. Sonntag,
the real estate man, yesterday.
"It is a business proposition that brings
business in turn. A locality must progress
or die. The Mills building was renewed
life to that locality. Why are tiiere so
many houses and offices 'to let' around
the lower end of Montgomery? Because
no improvements have struck the place
for years. Pavements were not changed
or renewed and horse cars literally went
from bad to worse. Other .streets got
themselves ready for the coming business,
but Montgomery street simply let it go.
I It went slowly but surely.
"Fifty years ago the center of the city's
activity was at about Montgomery and
Washington streets. In twentv-hve years
it hao receded to California and in twenty
five more it got to Market. One more
quarter of a century ii will be at Seventh,
moving westward. However, there is
enough left for Montgomery, if her people
will only hold what tney have. The street
car carries weightâ no desire to make a
j pun âand nobody knows that so well as
the merchant and the business man gener-
ally.
"Whefever there is a good modern street
car service there is life and business. Let
;i bitumen pavement and an electric road
be laid down in Montgomery street and
the 'to lets' will blow off the windows and
people will come back to trade with us.
But those bobtailsâ 'what fell?' as Chini
mie Fadden has it."
THE SOCIALISTS.
A<ldreÂ«sef) Murio at the Turk - Street
Temple in Three Lnngnagei.
The announcement that a grand anni
versary celebration and mass - meeting
would be held in the Turk-street Temple
under the auspices of the Socialist Labor
party last night tilled the upper hall of
that building to repletion.
E. T. Kingsley presided, and in his open
ing remarks said that as there were many
who embraced the ideas of socialism and
did not understand English perfectly ad
dresses would be delivered in French, Ger
man and English.
Faithful to this promise the attentive
and enthusiastic audience was permitted
to listen to addresses commemorative o!
the Paris commune given in the three lan
guages from the Jips of Moore, Gaffee
(French), P. R. Martin (English), and
Paul Grottkan (German).
The Socialist Maennerchor contributed
a number of choral selections, and Miss

BROWN DEFIES
THE COUNCIL
He Refuses to Accept the
Censure Passed Upon
Him.
HIS JUDGES SCORNED.
Jurisdiction of the Investigators
In One Matter As
sailed.
fIOW A VERDICT WAS IGNORED.
Dr. Brown Received With the Fatted
Calf, but Not as a Prodigal
Son.
Dr. Charles Oliver Brown, who has been
characterized by twenty men as guilty of
unchristian and ungentlemanly conduct
and. incidentally, the proprietor of a .very
nasty temper, struck back at his ecclesias
tical judges last night.
In spite of the doctor's statement made
to the United Press representative shortly
after the verdict reached him that he was
satisfied with the council's findings he last
night took occasion to severely criticize his
ecclesiastical judges.
The pastor's outburst of indignation
occurred at the prayer-meeting in the same
room where Mattie Overman told her
weirdly fanciful story, and where Dr.
Brown underwent the torture of a three
hours' cross-examination by the skillful,
ever-smilinp Tenney.
When the usual songs had been sung and
prayers said the pastor rose and in a few
brief sentences introduced Deacon Morse,
who had an important communication to
make. Then followed the reading of the
Terdict as rendered by the congregated
churches.
Dr. Brown impatiently waited for the
end, in order that he might teil his people
how the council after thirty-two days'
of earnest labor, had found him innocent
of all the charges, but through a mistaken
idea of justice had unfeelingly inserted a
clause declaring him guilty of unminis
terial conduct and casting discredit on his
explanation of f he Davidson affair.
The pastor became very much excited
during this recital, which at the end
brought forth rapturous applause from his
friends. The council was praised and
scoffed at by turns, though it was plainly
seen that the sting of the verdict reached
deeper than the reverend gentleman would
have his flock believe.
The findings of the council were unani
mously adopted bj* the church, but never
theless Dr. Brown was in a negative way
indorsed as pastor.
AT PRAYER-MEETING.
Pastor Brown Read Feelingly From
the Most Beautiful of
Psalms.
There was one member of the Congrega
tional church who had the courage of his
convictions sufficiently strong within him
to rise in his seat and move that the inter
ests of the church would be best served by
a pastor whose reputation had never been
called into question.
John Chase, the mover of the motion,
was aloue in his expression of opinion,
save for the solitary second which he re
ceived from some one who was not no
ticed. And when the vote was taken to
table his motion John Chase of the Chris
tian Endeavor Society of the First Con
gregational Church arose alone to vote
against the tabling of a vote which if car
ried would have forced Pastor Brown to
hand in his resignation.
Nothing remains of the Brown-Overman-
Stockton-Davidson-TunneJl - Cooper-Turk
ish Tea and organ-loft incident except
what aftermath may lie on the grouud,
now that the harvest has been gathered.
The Congregational churches which sent
pastors and deacons to the ecclesiastical
council may have something to say in
reply to Dr. Brown's criticisms of its
methods and in response to his open de
fiance of the council by his blunt refusal
to accept its censure. As was stated by
Moderator McLean last Tuesday night,
there is no appeal from the findings of the
council, but snould the churches repre
sented in the council feel that their voice
has been unheeded or treated with dis
respect, it is in their discretion to with
draw from fellowship with the offending
church.
But of these disagreeable aftertastes
there was no token last night. The inter
est of the congregation in the incident was
shown by the unusually large attendance
at the prayer-meeting, many of the oldest
and most enthusiastic Christians having
been wall-flowered.
The pastor looked better than he had at
any time since he placed in the palm of
the Davidson hand those 500 good Ameri
can dollars in gold and honest currency.
His old aggressiveness, perhaps over
stimulated by his battle of a month, had
becomp more or less latent, but when it
awoke, as it did when be defied portions
of the verdict of the council, it was as ro
bust and as eager for the fray as a young
pugilist before his first battle.
He again made a defense of some things
charged against him, but the keenest and
most receptive ears in the congregation
did not hear even tue dying ghost of a
whisper, not even the rustling of a leaf in
denial or explanation of the untruthful
dispatch which he had attempted on the
night before to palm off on the San Fran
cisco.agent of tne United Press. But it
may be that Pastor Brown bad so many
things of so much more importance on his
mind last night that he forgot to mention
the dispatch and to explain it in his char
acteristically plausible and eloquent way.
His style of elocution resembles very
strikingly that of Actor Stoddart in the
role of the honest old clergyman in
"Saints and Sinners." The trick of the
uncertain rising inflection at the end of
the short sentences was very apparent last
night. Tender emotion vibrated gently in
the tones of the pastor's voice as he made
the opening prayer which was eloquently
worded, and which breathed of confidence
and hope* It was just such a prayer that
could dovetail perfectly into the hymn
which followed, "Rock of Ages," one of
the^grandest, sweetest hymns in Christian
literature, and hardly had its last pathetic
chord ceased its pulsing upon the hearts
which throbbed responsive to its rhythm
when the pastor began reading from the
psalm in which David sees with the eye of
faith his help upon the eternal hills.
I will Hft up mine eyes unto the hills from
whence CQineth my help.
My help cometh from the Lord which made
heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he
that keeoeth thee will not slumber.
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither
slumber nor sleep.
And 30 on to the end of the one hundred
and twenty-first Psalm tbe full, deep voice
of the censured pastor reverberated, and
now and then quivered with something
akin to pathos.
Then gliding by a transition almost im
perceptible from David to Brown, the pas
tor, with the same inflection of voice as
though still reading from the psalms,
went on to say that he knew not what con
dition of human frailty or strength, of
human joy or sorrow, of victory or defeat,
of righteousness or of sin did not find
some adequate and appropriate expression
in the wonderful book from which he had
just read.
"Are we weak?" he asked, changing his
tone to one of challenge. The next mo
ment, with an accent of confidence, came
the reply and question: "God is strong.
Are we sinful t God is forgiving; His
mercies, says the Psalmist, are infinite.
When the wicked found my enemies and
my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
they stumbled and fell."
Beneath the accent of resignation and
confidence with which these sentences
were uttered there sang a strain of defiance.
The individual had peeped from behind
the robes of the pastor: the man had stood
forth for a moment from behind tbe altar
of the priest.
"David knew how it was," continued the
pastor. "He never was so sorely pressed
that he could not sing. No night so dark
but that the eye of his faith could pierce
the clouds above him and receive a new
vision of that star of Bethlehem, not more
plainly seen by shepherds while the angels
were singing and the wise men were wend
ing their way to the cradle of the Lord."
Then he spoke of the necessity of pain,
and what a lofty delight it was to have the
consciousness that it was inflicted with an
ennobling, an exalting and a transforming
purpose.
As a pastor speaking directly of himself
to his congregation he proceeded to say
that he could not express the feelings of
gratitude with which he took part in the
accustomed prayer meeting after what he
termed "the exciting scenes which have
taken place for weeks past." If in the
midst of those scenes any unkind words
had been spoken he hoped that they would
be forgiven Brirt forgotten in the abundance
of thatdivinÂ« love which Christians desire
to imitate.
After Deacon Morse, Brother Wood
hams and others had offered prayer, Dr.
Brown advanced to the platform and an
nounced that there was an item of business
to be transacted in which he was directly
interested and he called Deacon Morse to
the chair.
Deacon Morse, who is as poor a reader
as his pastor is a good one, read the verdict
of the ecclesiastical council. When it was
finished a motion was made for its
adoption, and this was followed by a mo
tion that it be received and filed.
Deacon Barnard moved that it be re
ceived and spread upon the records, and
that the thanks of the church be extended
to the council.
Dr. Brown, who appeared to be oblivious
to the indelicacy of his action, called
the attention of the chair to the priority
of Deacon Walcott's motion to rile the ver
dict. Chairman Morse was not sure that
the motion had received a second, but
Lawyer Nagle cried, "I second that mo
tion," and the question was accordingly
put to the house.
Dr. Brown claimed the floor and threw
down the gage of battle to the council.
He began by saying that he most earnestly
thanked ihe council for their willingness
to spend four weeks of their valuable tinve
in investigating the truth of the charges,
"made," continued the doctor, "not- by
individuals of responsibility, but by indi
viduals disrespectable and irresponsible,
against my good name. I want it distinct
ly understood that this remark was not
made of Mrs. Sarah B. Coorer, because
she did not make herself responsible for
those charges. They were formed out of
the newspapers by two women."
He spoke of the statement in the report
of the council to the effect that he had ex
plained that he had paid Mrs. Davidson
#500 for the purpose of securing the silence
of a Mrs. Baddin.
"I cannot conceive," he proceeded to
say, "how my brethren, after two or three
days of discussion of the evidence, could
possibly have made such a mistake as is
involved in that statement. At great ex
pense we secured the presence of one of the
most competent shorthand reporters in
the State of California, who took down
every word of the evidence, and it will be
found by referring to the report that I laid
stress upon the fact that I paid the money
not for the purpose of an iniquitous sil
ence but to secure such evidence in written
form as would ensure the arrest and pun
ishment of the criminal. That evidence
should have been recognized by my
friends in any statement in so serious a
document as this before us. I wish these
remarks to be accentuated by the news
paper reporters."
In reference lo the charges of intimida
tion the speaker said that the council had
not the slightest right to consider the
charge made by the young woman who
had inspected the church organ, because
the offense, if any, had been committed
ten days after the vote was taken to call
the council. He challenged the history of
Congregationalism to show that any coun
cil ever considered an act committed sub
sequently 10 the creation of the council.
"I therefore, here and now," he went
on defiantly, "explicitly say that I don't
accept the censure which my brethren
placed upon me. The council was created
to pass certain findings. It did so, and
dissolved in this house last evening, and
it has no further power over me. I am
now in the hands of the members of this
church."
He called attention to the thoroughness
of the investigation and to the publication
every day of 200,000 copies of the San Fran
cisco newspapers of the charges agninst
mm, and the fact that, in spite of this
wide publicity, no positive evidence was
found that was worthy to be received by
any body of respectable men upon the
character of C. O. Brown.
'â¢They have done well," he added, "to
issue m their report the statement that
these horrible charges were not true, but
had I been in their place something more
would have been added. It is not proven ;
it will not be proven; it never can be
proven. I don't object to filing this re
port, but I seriously object to the council
censuring me upon a matter upon which
they had no right to act."
He closed by thanking the individual
members of the council.
"I don't think you ought to thank
them," said Deacon Walcott.
The report was received unanimously.
John Chase arose in his seat and said :
"I movÂ« that the interests of this church
and ol its pastor would be better served by
a pastor whose reputation has never been
called into question."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
Dr. Brown Putting the Motion to Lay on the Table a Resolution Hostile to Himself. The Motion Was Car
ried by a Rising Vote, Showing That a Majority of Those Present at the Prayer-Meeting Wishedto
Retain Dr. Brown in His Ministerial Capacity.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
There was some applause, which a
moment later was changed into laughter
upon Deacon Walcott remarking, "What
doee he mean by that?"
Deacon Morse coldly requested Mr.
Chase to reduce his motion to writing.
"Let Dr. Brown's name be put in that
motion," exciaimed Deacon Walcott.
Dr. Brown asked that if a vote was to be
taken upon Dear Brother Chase's motion
the hall should be cleared of all but mem
bers of the church. Before the question
could be put a motion was made to lay the
Chase motion on the table, and it was so
ordered, Mr. Chase alone voting in the
negative.
Laudatory resolutions adopted by the
First Congregational Church of Kalama
zoo, Mich., were received, and Dr. Brown,
with quiet sarcasm, remarked:
"I hope that my dear brother, whom I
have loved, will read the Scriptures. Per
haps he may be ied to move that the world
would be best, served by a Redeemer whose
reputation had never been attacked."
Brot er Chase was as swift as the eaÂ«le's
swoop in his retort: "Dr. Brown, I fail to
see the parallel between the Redeemer and
yourself."
Then they sang a hymn and Dr. Brown
gave the benediction.
THE VERDICT REVIEWED.
Members of the Council Talk
Freely of the Findings and
Brown's Attitude.
One of the conservative members of the
council, and one who enjoys as preat a
rueasnre of public esteem as any indi
vidual of that body, referred to the verdict
of the ecclesiasfical jury as a "terrific blow
to Brown." When informed that it is re-
garded by some as a fulfillment of the
prophecy of a whitewash he expressed
genuine surprise.
His comment was to read from The
Call the following, which he pronounced
the "nub of the document" :
We should be glad to add to this verdict that
the various tacts in the case so far as ascer
tained have not left a trace of suspicion in our
minds concerning the hitherto stainless repu
tation of this honored minister of the gospel,
tut we are regretfully compelled to eoiifess
that Dr. Brown's explanation of the reasons in
his mind for paying to Mrs. Davidson the sum
of $500 and agreeing to pay the further sum
of $35 a month for a series of years, all for the
purpose of securing the silence of a supposed
Mrs. Baddin, is not altogether satisfactory to
us. and that Miss Overman's testimony as to
having changed certain letters known as the
Overman-Tunnell letters, which contained the
chief incriminating evidence In this case, is
impaired seriously by confessed falsehoods
previously told concerning the same matter,
while the strange and apparently significant
absence from the City of the receiver of the
letters has added to our embarrassment in the
effort to ascertain the truth.
"The facts in the case so far as ascer
tained," he read, with a peculiar emphasis
that argued tbat he believed there were
facts that it had not been possible, under
the circumstances, to ascertain. "We are
regretfully compelled to confess that Dr.
Brown's explanation of the reason in his
mind for paying to Mrs. Davidson the sum
of $500 and agreeing to pay the further sum
of $35 per month for a series of years, all
for the purpose of securing the silence of a
supposed Mrs. Baddin, is not altogether
satisfactory to us," he went on. "Miss
Overman's testimony as to having changed
certain letters known as theOverman-Tun
nell letters, which contained the chief in
criminating evidence in this case, is im
paired seriously by confessed falsehoods
previously told concerning the matter."
Here the reader stopped to see whether
the listener was aware of the force of the
sentence, before reading the conclusion of
what ne deemed a strongly condemnatory
paragraph: "While the strange and appar
ently significant absence from th* City of
tne receiver of the letters has added to our
embarrassment in the effort to ascertain
the truth."
"The committee on findings was chosen
with reference to a representation of local
ities, as well as to the fitness of the indi
viduals for the important duty. Dr. Mooar
is from Oakland, Dr. Hoyt from Sacra
mento, Dr. Tenney from Ban Joie, Mr.
Barker from Stockton and Deacon Bufford
from Plymouth Church, San Francisco.
"On Monday afternoon this committee
was chosen to crystalize as f:ir as possible
the opinions which had been expressed
by the members of the council as to the
accused man's guilt or innocence. Dr.
Mooar was appointed chairman, bu*. owing
to fatigue he was relieved from the posi
tion at his own request, and Dr. Hoyt
acted in his stead. Dr. Hoyt appointed
each member to give attention to certain
specified charges. When they had com
pleted their task he edited the whole.
"The report of the* committee as pre
sented to the council was more lengthy
and more general than that which was
afterward adopted. It contained certain
matter censuring in a measure the atti
tude of the public toward Brown. It fol
lowed this up by a rap at the press for
fostering the sentiment that such attitude
expressed. It expressed grave doubts as
to the pastor's innocence, similar to those
contained in the paragraph I have com
mented on, but the trouble was, they were
not definite enough. We found as the
reading of the report progressed to the
vital points that there was considerable
dissatisfaction with it, owing to its lack of
conciseness as well as strength.
"One of the brethren had an inkling
that Dr. S. M. Freeland had prepared a
paper givine his viÂ«ws and those of
certain members of the council as to the
question of the guilt or innocence of the
accused. It was at this juncture the coun
cilman who knew of the existence of the
paper called for its reading. Had he
waited till the reading of the report was
finished it m'ght have been toolr.te to give
the proposed document consideration.
"Dr. Freeland's paper was a kind of ver
bal bomb. It produced consternation in
some and satisfaction in others. The lat
! ter moved that it be substituted for the
committee's report. It was a critical situ
ation. The paper was strongly denuncia
tory, and It meant instantaneous death to
' Brown's ministerial career. Yet in the
| matters in which the council was prac
; tically unanimous it was more spe
i citic than the report of the com
mittee. After some discussion it was de
i cided to compromise by incorporating por
tions of Dr. Freeland's paper in the report.
The committee was ins'.ructed to do this
'york of recasting while the council took a
recess at 5 o'clock.
"Its labors were completed by 7 o'clock
with the result that the revised report con
sisted almost entirely l of Dr. Freeland's re
port, yet omitted the most radical utter
ances."
"An exoneration! A whitewash!" The
eminentchurchman laughed as he repeated
the words. "If I might be permitted to
use sporting parlance I would say it was a
Dr. S. M. Freciand, the Member Who
Threw a Bombshell Into the Delibera
tions.
body blow to Brown and he knows it. He
showed that by his complaint of the coun
cil ignoring his alleged excuse for the pay
ment of the money to Mrs. Davidson.
How he could have dictated United Press
and Associated Press matter, stating that
he had been exonerated, is past my com
prehension. I thought Nagle might have
done it and Dr. Brown's name was used by
mistake. He did do it." The reverend
doctor shook his head and heaved a chari
table sigh.
"I do not venture to say what his church
will do. lam sure, however, from what I
know of the situation and the man, that
there is no necessity for any withdrawals
from the church. I predict that he will not
only leave that church but the ministry.
I would not be surprised to see him in a
local law firm in less than a year."
As The Call representative was leaving
the gentleman said: *
"Don't misunderstand the feeling of the
council. It would have been impossible to
send out a document exonerating the man.
On the charge in reference to Miss Over
man alone, some of his reputed friends
said they were far from being convinced of
his innocence, at least as to mental and
I moral wantonness, although no proof
could be produced of physical wrongdoing.
They believed there were, at least, minor
offenses which made Miss Overman feel
encouraged to prosecute her alleged siege
of Brown's affections. Dr. l^reeland was
not the only man who made a fearless ex
pression. He was the one who couched it
in concise language. He and Deacon Wil
liams and Dr. McLean are fellow-passen
gers in their ferry trips. Tbeir views are
very similar, and it is thought that his pa-
I per was a consensus of their opinions."
If Dr. Brown remains pastor of the First
Congregational Church through the grace
of its members, or his own clever manipu
lation, such action will result not only in
the dismemberment of that organization,
but the expulsion of the remaining frag
ments from fellowship with the Bay Con
ference.
This is the belief of another prominent
member of the now defunct ecclesiastical
council as expressed yesterday. The gen
tleman hardly thought it possible that
Brown would be so foolish as to make a
fight against such a unanimous conclu
sion.
Still the pastor is known to be a vigor
ous fighter and one not likely to lay down
his arms, be the odds ever so great.
The council in voting on the several
specifications employed the secret ballot.
Each member recorded his vote on a little
slip of paper, folded it up neatly and then
passed it over to the secretary. No names
were signed, so it was impossible for any
member to know how his brother judge
voted. Of course the speeches indicated
something, but there was no way of know
ing if these ideas were promulgated in the
ballot.
It has now developed that the immoral
conduct charge caused the council the
greatest amount of worry and labor in the
matter of arriving at a satisfactory under
standing.
There was at least one member of the
council who thought the charge of adultery
had been proven beyond a reasonable
doubt. Ballot after ballot was taken, and
when each had been duly recorded an
adultery vote was found. This determined
member of the council did not let himself
be known in any way, though there is a
prevailing opinion among the San Fran
cisco brethren that the persistent voter
lives across the bay.
There were three elements in the coun
cil. One favored a conviction on all tbe
counts, another pleaded for absolute ac
quittal, whil- the third assumed a middle
ground. Dr. Scudder, Rev. Mr. Hatch and
Dr. Pond championed the cause of Dr.
Brown as long as there was anything to
stand on. The extreme faction found ad
vocates in Dr. Freeland and Deacon Wil
liams. The Plymouth Church representa
tives led a small followinc which favored
a comparatively mild censure.
The minority, headed by Dr. Freeland,
finally triumphed, however, resulting in
the decision as printed yesterday.
The statement is made on the authority
of a member of the council, that Dr. Brown
must -resign from the First Church, as his
connection with the Bay conference is
practically at an end. If the church fails
to act, then the conference must take up
the matter. â¢
A letter Â«tating that the superintendent
of the Pullman car service, a conductor
named Strike, and a porter who lives at
17J1 Myrtle street, Oakland, could give
damaging evidence in regard to Brown's
trip to Tacoma with Miss Overman, was
in the l;ands of the judge-advocate. It is
said that all refused to testify, the super
intendent and conductor refusing to give
their reasons. The porter frankly stated
that he knew a good many things he would
not tcli. "I get about $20 a month in tips.
'Twon't pay me to tell things," he re
marked.
Mrs. Stockton has given her version of
the baptism episode in a private conversa
tion. "The truth is," she said, "that Dr.
Brown called me into the study in his
usual manner, but in his ardor forgot to
drop the latch. We were surprised when
Deacon Vasconcellos walked in. but Dr.
Urown quickly recovered himself and
walked over and filled the washbowl pre
paring to baptize me. It would be putting
it mildly to say that I was surprised at
Brown's wonderful presence of mind."
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper said: "It would
be hard to rind a nobler body of men than
the council. It has done its full duty with
the evidence before it. I regard its find
ings as severely condemnatory. Dr. Mc-
Lean's views of the matter are mine." It
is said tiiat Mrs. Cooper has been advised
to appeal to the Congregational Bay Asso
ciation.
MAY BE A "TRAMP."
Mrs. Cooper Says That May Be the
Fate of the First Congrega
tional Church.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper was in nowise dis
turbed by the action of the church at last
evenings meeting. She ha.l no word of
censure for it.
'As I said earlier in the day," she re
marked, "the church may be disfellow
shipped. In such case it will become an
ecclesiastical tramp.
"No, I do not intend to withdraw from
it. I would as soon have thought of dis
honoring the flag in the old troublous
days of rebellion. Dr. Brown's stay in the
church will probably be short. I snail not
attend service there while he preaches.
But I shall continue with my class."
She spoke in highest terms of the coun
cil.
"'lt was composed of men of irrefragable
integrity. They did their duty in view of
all the circumstances. I wouJd make but
one exception, and that is Dr. Pond. His
motive can no longer be in question, if the
newspaper expose be true."
Mrs. Cooper has been invited to join
three churches of the City, one a prom
inent Congregational church. The invita
tions were given under the supposition
that she would not like to remain in ncr
present fold.
The lady regards the council's action as
full support of her charges and those of
her daughter, and pronounces it a victory
for Congregationalism, whose banner for
a time seemed in danger of being trailed
in the dust of humiliation and disgrace.
WILL UPHOLD BROWN.
The Trustees In Private Session
Decide to Stand by the
Pastor.
The trustees and deacons of the First
Consrregational Church held a long and
spirited meeting in the office of Trustee
Whittier yesterday afternoon. Pastor
Brown was also present.
The finding of the council was discussed
at length, with the result and decision that
Dr. Brown would be retained as pastor of
the church. At the prayer-meeting the
power and presence of the dracons other
than numerically manifested itself. It
was their voices whicii seconded the mo
tions and their lips which sung his praise.
Dr. Brown will, for some time to come,
at least, continue in charge of the First
Church.
MEN OF IDEAS SUCCEED.
Removal of Wilder & Co., Advertising
Specialists, to Larger Quarters.
In order to meet the requirements of a
gratifying growth of their business Wilder
& Co., the advertising sppcialists, have
found it necessary to remove from the
Palace Hotel to new and more commodi
ous offices in the new Easterbrook building
on Geary street, near Kearny.
These gentlemen have been exceedingly
successful in their particular line of busi
ness, and have built up an enviable repu
tation for their ability and skill in writing
and directing advertising matter. In
their new location they will be better pre
pared than ever to serve their numerous
patrons, and hope by careful attention to
business to merit even greater success.
MAY REMAIN IN CHARGE
Superintendent Weaver's Fate to
Be Decided on Wednes
day.
Dr. Williamson Will Remain Loyal to
the Incumbent to the
Very Last.
Whether or not Superintendent Weaver
of the Almshouse will be removed by the
Board of Health will be decided on
Wednesday next, when a special meeting
will be held to consider the matter.
The members of the board stand just as
they have since the investigation of the
City Poorhouse began, MayoT Sutfo and
Dr. Williamson standing by Superintend
ent Weaver, and Drs. Morse, Hart and
Fitzgibbon being against him.
The vote will stand thus when the
matter comes up and it will then rest with
the Governor whether or not Mr. Weaver
is to lose his position. If he decides to re
move Dr. Williamson and appoint some
one in his place who will do tne executive
bidding, the way will be easy, otnerwise
Superintendent Weaver will remain. The
following letter relating to the subject was
received by the board yesterday and placed
on file:
Mamtou v Colo., March 3, 189(5.
Honorable Board of Health, City and Couuty of
Fan Fravcisco, Cat.â Gentlemen: The papers of
this section advise me that Mr. and Mrs. P. L.
Weaver of the tfan Francisco Almshouse are
undergoing investigation at your hands, and
as I became interested in the institution
while I was professor of economics at the Stan
ford University I venture to send you some
account of my imy>ressions concerning it.
For six years before going to California I had
been professionally interested as superinten
dent ot charities for the District of Columbia,
and otherwise, In public benevolences of all
sorts, and hnd visited many of the large alms
houses in different parts of the United States.
I therefore went early to the almshouse in tan
Francisco, although I previously knew noth
ing of its management.
1 was delighted to find it one of the best in
stitutions of the kind 1 had ever seen, at least
in proportion to outlay. I went repeatedly,
alone and with others, and fuller acquaintance
only confirmed Dy first impression. An aims
house is usually one of the dreariest institu
tions that a man can visit, and is always so
unless a considerable measure of self-sacrifice
has been contributed to its management by
some one. In the institution controlled by
your honorable body I feel sure that the high
est standard of comfort and of decency in pro
portion to cost was due to the peculiar fitness
cf Mr. and Mrs. Weaver for their work and
their intelligent devotion to it.
In the discharge of my official duties I have
had imposed upon me at ail times the work of
investigating a large institution, and I appre
ciate tne dilliculties under which you must
labor in this work. The conflict of selfish
interests is so snarp and the number of un
truthful and complaining inmates is so large,
that it is very difficult for one outside an insti
tution to get a truthful view of its operations,
especially Irom former evidence. My own im
pressions in this matter were so clear that I
nave ventured to intrude tnem upon you. 1
hope that you will do nothing that may de
prive San Francisco of the reputation which it
now has among experts in such matters of
providing both cheaply and well for its old
and decrepid poor. Very respectfully yours,
A. G. Warner.

W. E. Johns, the Stockbroker,
Scores a Point Against
the Octopus.
CASE OF BATTERY DISMISSED
He Will Now Institute a Civil Suit
for Damages for Being Ejected
From a Car.
Considerable interest was manifested
yesterday in the case of William E. Johns,
charted with battery upon Conductor C.
L. Healy of the Post-street line, which was
tried in Judge Campbell's court yesterday.
Johns is engaged with bis father, A. F.
Johns, as a stockbroker at 623 Market
street and he was at one time a member
of the Warde-Jumes Dramatic Company.
He lives at 716 Oak street and on Sunday
afternoon he left his home to go to the
Olympic Club, of which he is a member.
He boarded a Hayes*street car ami at
the corner of Polk street got a transfer to
the Post-street line. This was about 1:30
o'clock and the transfer was punched good
till 2 o'clock. As there was no car in sight
he walked along to Grove street and when
Healy's car came along he boardeci.it.
Healy asked him for his fare and he pre
sented the transfer ticket. Healy refused
to accept it, alleging as a reason that
Johns should have remained at the trans
fer point; so he demanded a nickel, which
Johns declined to give. Healy then
threatened to throw him off the car and
signaled the gripman, John T. Sullivan,
to stop. The priDiuan came to Healy's
assistance and they grabbed hola of Johns
and forcibly ejected him from the car.
Healv became exasperated at the re
sistance made by Johns, and as the lftttor
was stepping from the car to the ground
Healy struck, him on the jaw with his
right fist. Healy and the gripiuan kent
hold of Johns until he was about ten
feet from the car. and then Johns asserted
his rights as a citizen and struck Healy
twice in the face. The gripman ran across
the street and Johns accelerated his speed
by a well-directed kick. Policeman Cough-
Jin ihen appeared and Johns was arrested
for battery.
Johns was defended by ex-Judge E. D.
Sawyer and Frank V. Beli, while Attorney
Kelly appeared as special prosecutor for the
Market-street Cable Company.
For the prosecution Conductor Healy
and Gripman Sullivan testified that Johns
struck the first blow. Michael GilJotti, a
bcotblack, on the corner of Grove and Lar
kin streets, testified that he saw the tient
and saw Johns strike Healy.
The defendant testified that Healy used
violent language to him, and notwith
standing h:s protests not to use violence in
ejecting him from the car Healy struck
him in the face as be was stepping to the
ground. Healy and the conductor fol-
Jowed him for a few feet, and he wrenched
himself free and shot out his right and
left into Healy's face. He had frequently
boarded the car at Grove and Polk streets,
presenting a Hayes-street transfer in pay
ment for his fart-.
Johns was corroborated by Albert Windt
and Peter Morrin, two passengers who
were standing on the rear platform and
saw the whole occurrence.
The Judge briefly summed up the evi
dence and dismissed the case on the
ground that Johns acted within his rights
as a citizen m defending himself.
Johns will now institute a suit for dam
ages against the cable company, whicii
will test the question as to whether a pas
senger accepting a transfer is bound by the
roles of the company to use it only at the
transfer point designated.

MASS-MEETINGS GALORE
Sam and Daggett Control and
E. P. E. Troy Denounces
the Junta.
MAGUIRE DECLARES IT AGAIN.
The Democratic Factions May Battle
Even at the National Conven
tion at Chicago,
Gavin HcNab has done the final thing
necessary to make him a full-fledged, regu
lar and master boss.
He has given it out that he will retire
from politics, though he may advise with
friends occasionally in the interest of good
government.
Christopher A. Buckley is out of poli
tics that way. So is Samuel Rainey.
Rainey tells everybody that he is out of
polities, though some of his friends come
to him for advice, and a short time ago he
told one of the Junta leaders that the only
connection he had with John Daggett polit
ically resulted from Datrgett's coming here
a stranger to local politics and his needing
somebody to give him some pointers.
Boss McNab, who runs the Junta in
the interest of Rainey, Daggett. Welburn
and Lanigan, by superintending things
generally and telling Chairman Sullivan
what to do, ha* been fairly busy this week
refuting; a startling intimation from the
Buckley side that he and Chairman Gould
carried through an A. P. A. scheme last
Saturday.
The Junta has done nothing since Satur
day except glory in the victory achieved
when the State Central Committee de-
clared them the regular local organization.
They are highly confident now and propose
to go right ahead.
The State Central Committee meeting
having passed there is no longer so good a
reason -why Rainey should lie low in the
brush. Much trouble in the organization
is anticipated over the exercise oi control
which Rainey and Daggett are generally
conceded to possess.
Heretofore Gavin McNab has shrewdly
kept to the official front tne decent men in
the organization, who are sincerely inter
ested in clean politics, but who are no
great shakes when it conies to practical
San Francisco politics. There was a
primary committee of twenty-rive, largely
composed of such men, and there was a
committee of twenty-five appointed to
look after the State Central Committee.
An arbitration committee is about to be
appofsted to straighten out the district
Jan<gles.
Tsut these committees are all appointed
by Chairman Sullivan for Gavin McNab,
and occasionally they are called upon to
ratify something that McNab and Sullivan
decide on. These committees comprise
the men who are openly at the front and
who appear to run the works. Most of
them are anti-Rainey. They- include, be
sides Messrs. McNab and Sullivan, Sam
Braunhart, Frank P. Hughes, Clitus Bar
bour, M. C. Hassett, Captain Fitzpatrick,

These men would not be likely to let
Rainey, Daggett and their henchmen
get all they want and do as they please at
a primary election and otherwise. As
Daggett wants to control the San Fran
cisco delegation in the State convention,
probably with some partnership arrange
ment with O. M. Welburn, and as Rainey
wants a local grip, the boss element must
control the officers and committees, as
well as the voters of the organization. So
if the nice people who are not politicians
try to make Rainey remain a four-spot
thore will be more trouble.
That Rainey controls the Junta in that
quiet way of his is believed by many who
are in the organization but opposed him.
Some of these have repudiated the organi
zation already on this account and others
threaten to.
One of these is E. P. E. Troy of the Iro
quois Club. He was from the start active
in the anti-Buckley movement and con
versant with the inside of things. Now
Mr. Troy is out denouncing the Junta as a
Rainey-Daggett machine, run by McNab.
"I hare repudiated the organization," said
Mr. Troy, "because there is not the slightest
doubt that Rainey will control it. McNab and
Sullivan deny this and at the meeting of the
general committee last weeK they got up a
trifling fake contest, supported by sixty-seveu
votes. Then they pointed to the vote and
said.: 'There's Rainey's strength.' I know
that by those on the inside. Raiaey and Dag
gett are conceded to almost if not wholly control.
Gavin McNab has admitted to me that Rainey
and Daggett could not be kept out of control
without|Ed Laniaan's help. I have here fig
ures given to me by Mr. McNab himself on the
â¢ composition of the general committee. Mc-
Nab conceded 187 votes to Rainey and Daggett.
This is sixty-three less than a majority. A
change of th'rty-two votes to Rainey would
give it to Rainey on McNab' s own showing.
You know what controls people and pulls
them over in such cases. It's patronage pulls;
and who have these pulls? They cannot keep
the control away from Rainey without mak
ing corrupt bargains M'ith other and corrupt
politicians who wield power ana who are at
present corrupting public officials.
"The policy of the leaders, as they have told
me many times, is to build up a boss system in
the various districts to produce so-called har-
mony. To accomplish this they have to my
knowledge taken off names of independent
and uncontrollable men and put in Rainey
men, for men who would be retdy to make
trades with them. Knowing that Chairman Sul
livan's policy would give the control to
Rainey, I told Mr. Sullivan two or three days
before the last primary to take my name off
the ticket. He disobeyed my order and left
my name on and had it scratched because he
thought I was about to denounce them. I
want to say that the estimate of Rainey's
strength given me by Mr. McNab was lower
than that made by others in the organization
who were well informed."
The Buckleyites declare that Daggett
âand Welburn, tooâ are keen to con
trol the State convention, and hence the
California delegation to the National con
vention, not only through personal ambi
tion, but to help out the administration
that appointed them. Daggett, they say,
will do all he can in behalf of the gold
"sound-money" policy of Cleveland and
Carlisle. He wants to take to Chicago,
they assert, a California delegation that
will stand by Cleveland's money policy.
The next thing in- order with the Junta
organization is the appointment by
Chairman Sullivan of the arbitration
committee of fifteen. Boss McNab has the
committee nearly fixed up and things are
being fixed up in the Forty-fourth and
Thirty-fourth ready for ratification "by the
arbitration committee within a few days.
The Junta proposes to go right ahead to
the State Convention. The Buckley
people are putting forth talk of compro
mise on an open primary, but there
appears no chance that the Rainey side
will accept. They feel strong and the
whole prize is worth playing for.
The Buckley people are preparing
for a rousing effort and a hot campaign
and the sending of a rival delegation to
the State convention. The Raineyites.
count on their friend Gould putting their
delegation on the temporary roll and their
getting in their 162 votes on the selection
of a temporary chairman who will ap
point a friendly credentials committee.*
The Buckley people say this is never done
when there are contesting delegations, and
there will be a huge row at Sacramento if
this is attempted.
Buckley is spending the weet at Ravens
wood. Meantime the Buckleyites are ex
pressing their intense indignation at the
action of tne State Central Committee last
Saturday, and especially at Chairman
Gould who was so unfair a partisan of Mc-
Nab during the dispute.
They are getting ready to do a whole lot
beginning next week. There will first be a
big meeting of the general committee at
Odd Fellows' Hall on Monday evening.
At that meeting their best orators will de
nounce Gould, McNab, et al.. and a series
of hot resolutions will also express the
general Buckley protest.
Then there will be a series of district
mass-meetings to do more denouncing and
to whoop up the faction's interests gener
ally. The action of the State Central Com
mittee is felt as a hard punch in the eye
from Gavin McNab. Now they know what
they have got to do. and they propose to
jump into a hard and probably a long
ripht, with Chris Buckley, and a lone list
joÂ£ able and experienced party-workers
; with them. #
Congressman Maguire is counted on to
stand strongly with them as being the
regular organization, in spite of the move
thnt Gavin McNab was able to make with
his proxies. Maguire was asked by tele
graph day before yesterday if he still stood
where he did when hÂ» left for Washington
and the Congressman repied in the follow
ing telegram that he did :
Washington, D. C, March 16, 1896.
-V. J. Donovan. 1173 Market Street: Cau only
reiterate my statement in B. B. Hall. Motion
to adjourn sine die was not put nor voted on
by committee. The only remedy is a fair pri
mary under impartial auspices.
James G. Maguiee.
"It is generally known," Baid Senator
M. J. Donovan yesterday, "that at the last
State convention, Gavin McNab nominated
Judge Maguire for Governor, with Budd's
proxy in his pocket, and then went back
and told people to vote for Budd. I under
stand that Maguire has said that he would
not accept a nomination for Congress from
those people, and anyway the nomination
for Congress is likely to get mixed up with
this trouble. As to the State convention,
if we are not recognized we will undoubt
edly send to Chicago a contesting delega
tion from the Fourth and Fifth districts."
Maguire's stand means a great deal in
this factional fight. It is an exceedingly
strong help for the Buckley side and a loss
to the other aide. Haguire took his stand
on the start on the ground that in all right
and fairness the side be approyed was the
legal and regular organization and that
the alleged adjournment sine die was a
political trick to be elapsed with McNab's
turning out the gas. But since Daggett
has secured a controlling interest in the
other side, Maguire's affiliation with the
Junta would seem an utter impossibility,
so bitter is the personal enmity between
the two. Daggett would hardly help back
to Congress the man he swore he would
run out of town.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
"Captain Impudence" Continues
Its Success at the
California.
Comedy and Pathos at the Grand.
Rachael Walker's Return to
the Orpheum.
"Captain Impudence" is one of the best
productions that the California Theater
has seen this season, and it is meeting
with the reward of merit in the shape of
large houses. The excellence of the cast
adds not a little to the success of Edwin
Milton Koyle's sparkling lines, and the
scenery and staging are all excellent.
At the Baldwin Theater "A Milk-white
Flag" is pursuing the cheerful tenor of
its way to the accompaniment of plenty of
laughter and applause.
Although "A Texas Steer" is no stranger
in this City, the clever performance being
given at the California Theater of the
popular Hoyt comedy is drawing excellent
nouses.
On Monday next the Henderson Ex
travaganza Company opens at the Colum
bia Theater in "Sinbad." The company
is said to be exceptionally strong this
season.
"Hoop of Gold" with its thrilling melo
dramatic scenes, relieved by the sprightly
jokes of Gilbert and Goldie, is proving
a very strong attraction at the Grand.
The realistic scenery is nightly applauded,
particularly the view of the Thames by
incoulight.
The Alcazar's continuous show is filling
the house. The low prices make it pos
sible for people who have not a whole
afternoon or evening at their disposal to
stroll in just to witness a few "turns."
Some parts of the bill are very good, as for
instance the horizontal bar performances
of Starkey and Rathbun and the farce,
â¢'My Wife's Husbands," the latter being a
slightly adapted version of "My Turn
Next." Josephine Gassman. in serio
comic selections, takes well, but for the
most part the vocalists leave something to
be desired.
The familiar strains of "Maritana" are
arousing the usual demonstrations of ap
probation at the Tivoli this week, for the
old ballad operas never seem to die. The
next attraction at the Tivoli will be "Said
Pasha."
Large houses and plenty of applause are
as usual the rule at the Orpheum. This
week's bill, which is a strong one, includes
songs by the popular Creole singer, Rachnel
Walker, who is paying a return visit here.
Al and Mamie Anderson's plantation
sketch has made quite- a hit, and the* same
may be said of the Di Filippiis' dance "On
the Boulevard."
A deer' 3 eyes command a wide field
of vision, and the animal can see behind
as well as before, thouen not so distinctly,
for when alarmed it will always turn so as
to gain a clearer view of the object. â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
SIGNS UPON THE DOORS.
A Sensation Is Exploded After
Days of Doubt and
Worry.
MYSTERY OF A DOUBLE CROSS
It Was Put on Houses by Canvassers
in Three Citiesâ Secrets of
the Craft.
Some industrious canvassers must have
been laughing very heartily in their sleeves
for the last few days over the scare about
mystic marks on doors and doorsteps.
First the prevalence of these signs attract
ed attention in part of Oakland, and when
the story of supposed mystery became
public every careful housekeeper across
the bay made search for the dreaded signs.
Presently, as if impelled by some unknown
species of infection, the marks were epi
demic in Alameda and Berkeley.
That was bad indeed on the face of it,
and consternation spread from the-Clncinal
clear to Pinole. Ridiculous stories of boy
cotts and evil designs to be carried out
through the medium of the door marks
helped to inflame some of the timorous
minded people across the bay. It was
with dread misgivings that women
The Mysterious Signs on Walls and
Doorposts.
watched for the marks upon their doors,
and frequently the discovery was accom
panied with a scream like a cry of pain.
"The horrid double cross! There it is!"
"What of it?" pater familias would ask.
"Well, the house is to be entered by
burglars and robbed, and some of those
terrible tramps are to burn it down, and
we are to be boycotted or slaughtered."
Timid people on the San Francisco
side of the bay felt so greatly moved
by newspaper articles on the mys
tic marks that a general hunt for
the double cross was made about the doors
and garden gates, and when strange signs
were found throughout the Mission and
Western Addition the word passed round.
"I told you so !" That nightmare of a black
leadpencil mark, the double cross, was
there on many a door, staring the aston
ished householders like an apparition of
some bilious dream.
After all the mystery was easily ex
plained, although for many there was
some dim cause for concern over the
double cross with an initial and dates, or
an unmeaning scroll. The cross itself was
similar to the character used to indicate
number before numericals. It is the trade
mark, so to speak, of an industrious set of
canvassers who are going through the city
for one firm, and it is placed on doors as a
notification that the house has been tried.
The initial denotes the canvasser, and of
ten a date expressed in tigures, such as 3
-2-96, is added to tell the day the house
was visited.
"It is an old trick of the trade," ex
plained an old canvasser yesterday, "and
ever since I saw the double cross" two or
three weeks since I have been trying to
rind what new caavasser is in the field.
There is no doubt whatever that it is done
by canvassers, who may be out for a new
article or a publication. It saves time, for
when a man in the secret sees the mark he
will. leave at once.
"if people would only look a little closer
they would find on almost every door in
San Francisco some one or more of these
marks."
He wrote the initial "E" with a charac
teristic curve; "0 C," the letters united,
and the C double as large as the O; also
"Van" and "Spud" and "Winn," the lat
ter printed in block letters.
"All these signs may appear mys
terious," he continued, "if you believe
that children had not scratched them on
the door. Suppose 'Spud' was noticed at
once in Oakland, Alameda, Berkeley and
San Francisco, wouldn't there be a sensa
tion and a mystery ?
"The man who writes 'E' represents a
sewing-machine agency, and I think he
writes his initial as a warning to the
extras to keep off."
A canvasser for a morning paper writes
his initials, "O'C," everywhere he goes,
and the other men look at these letters
and remark, "O'Connor has been here,
too."
A new sign is "V T an," and from the
way in which it is growing throughout the
City canvassers declare that Van, whoever
he may be, is certainly an industrious fel
low. They cannot resist the temptation of
having a little fun at his expense, and
add "ity," making the fellow's sign Van
ity. Another sign is "Spud," which is fre
quently accompanied by Murphy, so that
the name is Spud Murphy, though it may
represent any one else in creation.
The name "Winn" in bold print is still
a familiar one on the lintels of doors
about town. Two years aero there was
scarcely a door in the whole of San Fran
cisco without it and its characteristic ring
hurriedly drawn around it.
Winn was a canvasser on The Call
under its former management, and bore
the reputation of being the most active
canvasser on the streets. He worked with
two comrades, who made it a rule riot to
canvass a house that bore his name. Other
canvassers made it a rule to add "dy" to
his name, and in time this hustler" saw
his trade mark turned into "Winndy."
He died about eighteen months ago; but
his name remains on thousands of doors,
a little faded and weather-worn, though
still a sign from which canvassers have
taken their cue to make queer marks.
Winn originated the idea of marking
doorposts in this City.
BRUTALLY BEATEN.
Main in Johnston Nearly Killed by Her
Companion in the Anita House)
Hunt Street.
Mamie Johnston, a young woman about
25 years of age, was taken to the Receiving
Hospital last night in a pitiable condition
from the Anita House, 31 Hunt street.
There was a lacerated wound in her head,
her eyes and face were swollen and black
ened and she seemed to be suffering in
tense pain. Her wounds and bruises were
attended to and she was sent to the City
Prison, where she was booked as drunk.
Sergeant Bidwell considered her condition
so bad that he notified Captain Wittman
and the captain laid the facts before Chief
Crowley.
The Chief detailed two detectives to
make a thorough investigation into her
case and ordered her to be sent back to the
hospital. The detectives tried every possi
ble means to get her to tell how she had
received her injuries, but she positively
refused to say anything. Then they went
to the Anita House, but did not succeed
in obtaining any clew.
About 10 o'clock last night she said she
had been beaten by Jack Haynes, her
companion. He had Deaten her oh the face
and head with his clenched fists till she
was unconscious. She would give no
reason for the assault. The police are
searching for him.
NEWSPAPER THIEVING.
Judge Joachiingen Will Give His De-
cision To-Day in the Cage of
Robert Cook, a Janitor.
The stealing of newspapers from the
doors of subscribers has been so frequent of
late that it has become epidemic. The
carrier leaves the paper and when the sub
scriber opens his front door an hour or two
later it has disappeared much to his dis
gust.
Complaints were so numerous from sub
scribers of The Call living along Pine
street^hat a watch was set. Shortly after
5 o'clock last Friday morning Robert Cook,
a janitor, living at 2318 Pine street, was
seen to take a copy of Thk Call from the
door of M. G. Jonas, 2011 Pine, and was
promptly arrested by Policeman W. D.
Scott and booked at the North End sta
tion on the charge of petty larceny. The
copy of The Call was retained as evidence
against him.
Cook appeared before Judge Joaohimsen
a few hours later, and the case was con
tinued till Saturday, the Judge releasing
Cook on his own recognizance. When the
case was called on Saturday it was con
tinued till yesterday, and yesteraajr the
Judge intimated be would render his de
cision to-day.
Au example should be made of Cook, as
he is well able to afford to pay for a paper
himself. Besides, it is necessary to inflict
a severe penalty, which would have the
effect of putting a stop to this vexatious
kind of petty larceny.
TO ANALYZE MORE WATER
Complaints Against Golden Gate
Park and Castro Heights
Supplies.
The Board of Health Will Enforce
the Birth Registration
â¢ Regulations.
In consequence of numerous complaints
regarding the artesian water in Golden
Gate Park and on Castro Heights, the
Board of Health at its meeting yesterday
decided to investigate the two supplies
mentioned with a view to ascertaining
whether or not it is fit for human con
sumption.
Dr. J. C. Spencer, the City Bacteriologist,
was directed to co-operate with Professor
Wenzell, who was appointed City Chemist
without pay, in taking samples of water
from the two supplies mentioned, and to
report to the board at its next regular
meeting the result of their investigations.
The physicians of this City not having
shown an inclination to comply with the
regulations of the board regarding the
registration of births, the board decided to
take definite action in the matter. Notices
will be sent to all physicians and mid
wives within the City to report all births
at which they officiate on or before the
fourth day of each month.
Those who fail to report within the time
specified will be arrested under the law
governing the registration of births and
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Two weeks will be given the local medicos
to come to time.
Milk Inspector DocKery reported that
though the milk ordinance had been in
operation rive weeks, very few hotel and
restaurant keepers had obtained permits in
accordance therewith. He declared that
he proposed to enforce the provisions of
the order strictly hereafter.
Dr. McMurdo reported that the Board of
Supervisors had neglected to buy drugs for
branch jail 2, though He had made
many requests, and had finally sent notice
that" he would not visit the institution
again until the desired drugs were pur
chased. The board will communicate with
the Supervisors and try to learn why the
drugs nave not been bought.
<.ol<i-M ining Exchange.
The informal opening of the Gold-mining
Exchange has met with considerable success
and the scenes about thÂ« new board room were
lively and enthusiastic at the regular morning
session yesterday. Crowds filled the lobby
and bidding was active among the broker*.
A new mine, the Savannah, appeared upon the
lists and prices generally advanced. Other
properties are offering for enlistment, and the
inquiry among investors ie strong for Cali
fornia gold mines. Four applications for mem
bership have been received nince Monday,
viz. : \V. E. Rogers, J. H. Tingman, Walter .W.
Gollin, J. 0. Bauer. Considerable business was
done yesterday after the regular board session,
and brokers are reported busy preparing
orders for future buying and selling.
Sea otters are either hunted by men in
boats and shot or caught in nets, when
they meet their death by drowning.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top flgnrto
Bt elation indicate maximum temperature for the
djiys; those underneath it, if any, the amount ol
laiDfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
Urn's, connect points of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather; "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded and
accompanied by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows"
usually first appear on the Washington coast.
Wfcen the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north and
south along the coast, rain is probable: but when
the "low" is inclosed with isobars of marked curva
ture rain south of Oregon is improbable. With r
"hieh" in the vicinity of Idaho, and the pressure
falling to the California coast, warmer weather may
be expected in summer and colder weather in win
ter. The reverse of these conditions will product
fto epposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V., March 18.-Tbe tendency
Of the Stock Market to-day was downward. The
decline was started by sales for foreign account.
Private cable advices were to the effect that the
objections made by France to the proposed British
expedition to Dongola had disturbea confidence to
some extent, and the early selling of Americans
here and the decline in consols and French rentes
was ascribed to this. At hornÂ« the mercantile
failures announced daily are exerting an unfavor
able influence and are inducing holders of specula
tive lines to reduce their risks.
The sales for London account were estimated at
fully 10,000 shares, principally St. Paul and Louis
ville and Nashville. The industrials were again
niost conspicuous. Consolidated (>as dropped 4%
to 148 on adverse legislation at Albany, but later
bounded up to 152(51151, when sellers attempted to
â¢â¢over. Tobacco dropped 23 gto 80Vs< then rose to
8-3/ 8 and receded to 803,4(0181 V*. U was stated
that h<- negotiations for a settlement of trade dif
ficulties were still KOinjj on, but nothing coultl be
Obtained from ihe officials of the company. The
directors met here to-day, but transacted onl3~ rou
tine business.
Sugar was sold down from 117s/ 8 to 1155/ 8 , the
room trades being prominent in bringing about
the decline. In the closing hour of business the
entire market was weak and business was more
active. Wheeling and Lake Erie preferred at this
time dropped 3% to 33. The industrials, Louls
vilie and Naslivillo and the grangers all touched
the lowest figures in the final trans-actions. Specu
lation closed weak with prices anywhere from 14

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., March 18.-The Wheat mar
ket drifted Into a scalper's deal to-day. At first the
crowd favored the buying side, doubtless because
of the recent decline which left room for a rally.
Later, however, the selling wasjheavy enough to
depreciate values . about as- much as they had
gained early. Then a second bulge took place,
about which time there was said to be good buy
ing orders for New York. Liverpool did not fully
reflect the advance of yesterday on this side,
cables quoting prices but yÂ±d higher.
Receipts In the Northwest were large at 413 cars,
against 321 last Wednesday and 281 a year ago.
Chicago had 18 cars and inspected out 74,283
bushels. A second Liverpool cable gave ft further
advance of i4d, and the local talent adopted that
as a bull argument, although it was at best an in-
I different one. iCxport . clearances were very light
at 500 bushels of wheat and-8415 barrels of flour,
in all equal to 38.368 bushels of wheat. Closing
Paris cables were lower, Berlin higher and Ant

WAITED TO WING A THIEF
Why Rev. C. H. Hobart Did Not
Draw a Bead on a
Burglar.
HIS REVOLVER WAS EMPTY.
The Pastor Might Have Killed Mine-
Owner Lyons Had His Car
tridges Been Handy.
Oakland Officf.San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 18. f
Rev. C. H. Hobart, pastor of the First
Baptist Church, is an adept with a gun.
Two years ago he made a record at Suisun,
and his clerical bretnren declare that it
has not yet been broken. Had this fact
been known to a venturesome burclar
who visited the pastor's house at an early
hour Jast Sunday morning the Sabbath
breaker would probably have hesitated
before he essayed to become a house
bre'aKer.
Just as the Sabbath was dawning and
the pastor's mind was renting for the
labors of the day he was awakened by the
sound of h ; s housekeeper running up
stair?, shouting. Mr. Hobart hastened to
inquire into the cause of the trouble, and
soon discovered a man on the back porch,
who had nearly succeeded in forcing a
window.
Mr. Hobart evidently excepts the golden
ruie in regard to burglars, for be secured
his revolver and started to the rear of the
house. On examining his revolver he dis
covered that ail the chambers were empty
and his cartridges were downstairs. He
did not particularly care to search in the
dark for ammunition with the chance of
encountering an intruder, so he went to
the window and shouted at the fellow,
who was attacking the lower window.
The burglar looked at the minister and
very quietly walked off.
On Sunday night another noise was
heard at the window, and an investigation
commenced, this lime with a revolver
ready for business. After 'a thorough
search it was discovered tliatthe noise was
the work of some prowling cats. The
pastor now keeps his gun ready for burg
lars and should any arrive a tragedy might
follow. In speaking of the story to a
friend, Mr. Hobaft said that he supposed
thieves worked on the principal that if a
luinister was struck on one chees he would
placidly present the other for similar
treatment.
Mr. Hobart's record as a shooter was
evidently not known to the burglar. About
two years ago tne pastor was shooting
over Suisun marsh with a friend. The
friend owned a very valuable pointer. Mr.
Hobart was not particularly steady on
taking a si^ht. Ducks were not plentiful,
but from among the marshes a few arose
and the minister hunter fired. The ducks
flew on undisturbed, there was a howl of
pain, and since then tne pastor's friend
has been the owner of a rine dogskin rug.
It is ail that remains of the pointer that
started the birds after Mr. Hobart shot.
It has been calculated that oa the same
sight the pastor would have killed his
staunch member, John L. Lyons, who
lives across the lot, had he attempted to
wing the burgiar.
KEEITTAL EVIDENCE
Of Insanity Experts in the Hill Murder
( Trial.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â the trial
of Benjamin L. Hill did not reach the jury
because of the failure of Miss Hannah
Mahoney of 1024 Willow street to respond
to subpenas from the defence. Judge
Ogden issued a bench warrant, which the
Deputy Sheriff served, but on her promise
to be on hand did not enforce. When
wanted the witness was absent and the
court sharply criticized the Sheriff for his
failure to enforce the orders of the court.
The defaulting witness put in an appear
ance after the court had adjourned until
1:30 this afternoon. She was locked up
until time to appear in court. When she
attempted to explain her absence the mat
ter was continued until the close of the
trial and meanwhile the witness was re
manded to the custody of tbe Sheriff.
Miss Mahoney testified that she had
been the landlady of the Hills, and after
Hill went to Portland Mrs. Hill remained
at the house for three months, when she
was ejected.
The defendant took the stand, and his
attorney read several letters written by
Hill to his wife. In one of these Hill told
his wife that he had left her, and she
should look elsewhere for care ana sup
port, as he could not do it.
This closed the case for the defense, and
Dr. J. W. Robinson of Livermore was
placed on the stand as an expert on in
sanity by the prosecution in rebuttal. It
is expected the arguments will be short
ana that the case will go to the jury to
morrow.
SCOTT GETS SIX MONTHS.
The Smooth Swindler Pleads Guilty of
Embezzlement.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â The pre
liminary examination of "Rev." H. C.
Scott on the charge of embezzling A. J.
MacMurtry's stereopticon was begun to
day after many delays. Mr. MacMurtry
repeated the story as published of how he
loaned the stereopticcm. He identified
the articles brought up from JLos Angeles
and those disposed of by Scott to Rev.
Mr. Pierce which "had also'been sent here.
This afternoon Scott pleaded guilty to a
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement and
received a sentence of six months' impris
onment, the limit of the law. On ac
count of the difficulty of proving the
value of the lantern stolen, Scott escaped
prosecution on the feiony charge.
Since Scott's arrest Mrs. A. Martin of
702 Tenth street called at the police sta
tion and identified about 100 slides which
Scott had among his things that he had
"borrowed" of her. Scott's attorney re
turned them to Mrs. Martin. She "said
Scott sold her a photograpuic lantern for
$3 which shs found afterward to be the
property of C. W. Logan.
STUDENTS DELVE.
Co-Eds More Active Than Those at
Berkeley Provide Lunch for the Men.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 13. â The
young men attending California Col
lege, the Baptist institution at High- 1
land Park, East Oakland, from which Rev.
S. B. Morse, D<D., recently resigned as
president, have been imitating their
brethren at the University of California
and have been improving the campus.
The "co-eds" of this institution, unlike
their sisters at th? State University, how
ever, did not feel that it was. beneath their
dignity to encourage the young men in
their good work by preparing and serving
a suitable luncii during labor hours.
As a result the boys say tney did better
work and more than they would had the
young ladies refrained from their good
offices. The young ladies in turn say that
as they could not do the manual labor re
quired to be done it was do more than
ri'htthat they should turn out in force
and do what they could. One pretty co-ed
naively remarked: "We were greatly eur
prised'at the difference it makes in a man
to dress him in old clothes when you are
in the habit of seeing him i:i good ones.
Another surprise was the appeiites.devel
oped by the young men when they had
workeda little while."
Tuesday there were no recitations, and
the young men donned the oldest clothes
that they could find among their belong
ings and spent the day spadinc up the
campus in front of Mary Stuart Hall pre
paratory to sowing blue grass. The seniors
set three fine trees out at the same time.
The work was well done, but hardly com
pleted, so it is probable next Monday will
be set aside to finish the work.

REPUBLICAN ARGUMENTS
Nearly All the Ward Clubs
Will Attend the Mass-
Meeting.
PBIMARIES STILL DEMANDED.
The Second, Fifth and Seventh Wards
Unanimous in Opposing Ap
pointments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, March 18. \
Republicans are daily becoming apen in
their expressions of opinion regarding the
question of primaries or no primaries for
delegates to the State Convention. The
matter is the sole point of interest in local
politics, and ward clubs are busily at work
preparing to take definite action. It is
thought that when the Third Congres
sional District committee meets next
Saturday it will help to preserve harmony
I
P. M. Fisher, Who Has Called the Meeting at the Tabernacle to Demand Pri
maries for the Republican Party.
*n the party in this county by ordering
primaries and ignoring the recommenda-
tion of the Alameda delegation.
The call for the mass-meeting at the
Tabernacle to-morrow nitjbt is being
widely circulated, and it looks as if there
would be an immense attendance.
The Republicans of the Fifth Ward
organized last night, and the following
resolution was passed :
Whereas, The Third Republican Congres
sional Committee has, by a vote of five to one,
refused to allow the voters a voice tn the selec
tion of delegates to the State Convention to be
held on May 5, 1890, at the city of Sacra
mento, now be it
Resolved, That the Fifth Ward Republican
Club of Oakland, organized on March 17,
1897, hereby expresses its disappr>val of such
action as contrary to the traditions and spirit
of the Republican party, as forming a bad pre
cedent ami as likely to alienate the respect of
those patriotic and honorable citizens whom
the Republican party numbers as its mem
bers; and be it further
Henoived, That this club will unite with any
feasible and well-advised plan to correct
what it considers the mistaken action of the
said committee, and to that end as many mem
bers as can do so will attend the meeting to be
held at Mills Tabernacle on Thursday even
ing, March 18, 1896, to unite in the protest
against the action of the said committee.
The powerful Seventh Ward Republican
Club issued the following call to-day:
A meeting of the Seventh Ward Republican
Club will be held on Thursday, March 19, 1836,
at 8:30 P. M. sharp, in Judge Lawrence's court
room, corner of East Twelfth street and
Twelfth avenue, for the purpose of giving ex
pression to the sentiment of the club on the
recent action of the State Central committee
men from Alameda County relative to the
manner of selecting delegates to the State and
National conventions. Let your interest in
this important matter be mantfested by your
presence. Remember the hour of meeting. By
order of the president.
J. E. Van* Amrtnoe, Secretary.
East Oakland, March 17, 1896.
As soon as the club assembles a resolu
tion will be passed and it is expected that
the club will go in a body to the Taber
nacle. The following-named vice-presi
dents have been selected and will be invited
by Chairman P. M. Fisher to the platform:
\V. A. Dow, president of the Seventh Ward
Club; B. A. Rabe, president of the First
Ward Club; ex-Judge J. M. Haven, presi
dent of the Fif ;h Ward Club; William Mol
ler, L. H. Brings, W. H. Knight, Socrates
Huff, H. E Osgood, Edwin Wbipple, James
tStanley, J. L. Barker, Henry Smyth, J. P.
Taylor, W. W. Garthwaite, G. B. Daniels,
George D. Metcalf, L. G. Burpee, Frederick
Sinclair, J. E. Farnum, Sol Kahn. H. O.
Trowbridge, N. A. Koser. E. J. Osgood,
John D. French, C. Scbreiber, C. R. Yates,
Victor Metcalf and Charles Roeth.
Committeernan E. K. Taylor said to-day
that he is misunderstood. He said: â¢
"The general public seems to be down
on Morrow and myself of tne Aiameda
County delegation in the committee, be
cause we finally agreed to vote for the ap
pointment of the delegates to the National
Convention. We held out for ten days
with the others, trying to do our best to
have primaries held, and litially saw that
we could not have them. Instead of being
pleased over this action they are abus
ing us.
''Now, the very ones who are abusing us
do not know and do not understand the
purpose of thi9 committee or the differ
ence between it and any other State con
vention. The committee does not nomi
nate a single elective officer. It will only
name two delegates to the National Con
vention to nominate the President and
Vice-President.
"Sacramento County and most of the
northern counties have decided as we have
to make appointments. The other coun
ties in this district have done likewise,
and there has been no complaint. The
only reason for all this fuss in this county
is that a certain clique saw that there
would be better chances for it in a primary
than by appointment, and those chances
have been spoiled."
The First Ward Republican Club held a
well attended meeting to-n ght and passed
a set of resolutions condemning the action
of the Aiameda committeemen in ordering
tie selection of delegates, [t was recited
that such a method would excite distrust,
encourage bossism and be opposed to all
Republican principles. The committee was
requested to reconsider its action, and W.
W. Morrison of that Assembly district in
which the First Ward is located was
specially requested to chance his vote.
Another resolution highly commended
Senator Guy C. Earl for refusing to lend
himself to such tactics and commending
him to the confidence of voters for demand
ing primaries.
Child's 111 Treatment.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.-The Hu
mane Society has received word from "Wal
nut Creek that a French farmer near there
ill treats his only daughter, a child of ten
der years. The neighbors say that the
farmer uses her as a covvtender, sending
her out in all kinds of weather, far from
home, to tend the cattle. The society will
look into the matter at once, and if the
facts warrant letters of guardianship of
the child will be applied for and the
father arrested.
REV. MIC. PIERSON'S DEATH.
Letter From Mary Fox-Pierson Giving
a Few Facts.
OAKLAND. Cal., March 18.â The father
of Mrs. Mary Fox-Piers n' has received a
letter regarding her husband's death. She
says his death occurred at Oelwein,
lowa, March 2 and was very sudden and
unexpected. He was sick two weeks with
typhoid fever. Mr. Pierson was of a
highly respected family, who reside at 201
North Arlington avenue. East Orange,
Now Jersey, and were all members of the
Presbyterian church of that place. Rev.
Mr. Pierson was 28 years 11 months and 15
days old. Besides his wife he leaves a
widowed mother, Mrs. Theodore F. Pier
son, three sisters and a younger brother to
mourn the sad loss.
The father in speaking of the couple
paid Rev. F. Pierson first met Miss Mary
Fox wbile singing at Mr. Moody's meet
ings at Northlield, Mass., in 1891. They
were married at the First Congregational
Church October 3, 1892. After remaining
In Oakland for two weeks they left for the
East. Since then they have been success
fully and almost continuously engaged in
evangelical work, with the exception of
about four months prior to the death of
Mrs. Pierson's mother, -which occurred
last July.
ADDIE IS MAD.
She Addresses a Letter to the Press
About Her Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18. â Addie
Everett, the young girl over whom there
has been such a fuss between two lovers
and the grandmother and Mrs. Lydia
Prescott, is angry and wants'all to know
it. She has addressed the following letter
to the press regarding her case:
Sir: It is with reluctance that I address a
letter to the press, but under the existing cir
cumstances I feel justified.
When I was arrested Mrs. Prescott accom
panied me and said that a charge of vagrancy
would be placed against me. If I did not
plead guilty to It she said she would make it
exceedingly hard forme, but if I would prom
ise her to plead guilty, which I very foolishly
did, for the charge was without foundation,
! she would make it comparatively liifht. I car
\ ried out my part of the agreement, as the rec
i ords show. Now she denies all of this.
The reform school stares me in the face, and j
I can have no object in stating an untruth.
Mrs. Prescott advised me to plead guilty, and
it was false when on the witness-stand she said
she did not. I now repeat that I followed her
advice and I believed her. Had I had
legal counsel before I made my plea I would
have been dismissed.
I thought I would reform, but when I see a
i woman like Mrs. Prescott held up (is an cv
| ample I feel that if I should reform to become
j like her it would be worse than anything: I
! could do. Addie Everett.
MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE.
Considers Several Matters of Interest to
the Trade.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â The Mer
chants' Exchange has named a committee
consisting of Messrs. D. C. Brown, Theo
Gier, W 7 alter Meese and C. W. Kensey to
confer with License Inspector Mitchell in
revising the existing ordinances. They
will then report to the exchange, and
when it is approved the council will
be requested to pass the amended or re
vised ordinance.
A resolution was adopted calling on the
proper authorities to take note of the boot
black stands on the street as well as the
candy stands, and gee that the terms of
the ordinance are fully carried out. The
candy men claim the street venders are
materially injuring their business.
The directors decided to recommend to
the Council that they appoint a deputy to
assist the license inspector, as they believe
it would result in increasing the income of
the city from licenses.
CELEBRATION DEBT.
Expense Incurred for Which No Funds
Had Been Raised.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â The Wash
ington's birthday celebration committee
held a mournful meeting last night. The
question under consideration was the best
method to raise some $250 to pay off the
bills contracted by the committee, and
for which no funds had ever been provided.
There was considerable discussion as to
how and why there was a deficiency, but
it was there, and to meet it the committee
decided to give a carnival in the nature of
a merchants' display. The merchants will
be asked to lend their aid, and as it will
be in the nature of an advertisement of
home industries, it is expected tbat they
will lend their assistance willingly.
An Odd Woman.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18. â Sarah
Robins 13 the name of a woman vagrant in
the City Jail. She has never been seen to
use water, although she has been in the
jail since Sunday nisht. She neither eats
nor sleeps, but at night stands in the cor
ner, with her hands covering her eyes.
The officers believe her mind is affected
and will ask for a medical examination.
She never speaka a word tbat is not neces
sary.
A Witness Faints.
OAKLAND, Cal., March 18.â Mrs. Ida
Claxton, a witness in a battery case in the
Police Court, fell in a faint as she left the
witness-stand. She wa3 carried into the
Judge's room, where restoratives were
used to bring her to consciousness. She
had been closely"questioned regarding her
life and as to whether or not she had lived
on a certain street in San Francisco where
degraded women congregate. The attorney
apologized afterward, but the court cen- ,
sured him severely for his manner of ques

DAVIE IS NOT POOH-BAH
The Official Distinction Has Now
Fallen Upon City Engineer
Wilson.
DISCOVERY OF A CITIZEN.
The Road to the City Treasury Js
Altogether Too Easy at the
Present Time.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,Â£
908 Broadway, March 18. )
An energetic voter has written a most
interesting communication to Mayor
Davie to prove that his Honor is not the
Pooh-Bah of the city's government. The
writer declares that the mantle is worn
Ky Commissioner Wilson of the Board of
Works, and he asks the Mayor if there is
any law that permits any official to exer
cise so much license and discretion.
"Of course there is no such law," said
the Mayor to-day, "and I have no douDt,
as I have often said before, that all his
acts are illegal, and if they are ever taken
before the Supreme Court will be so de
clared. The various items mentioned are
perfectly correct."
The letter proceeds: "As City Engineer
Mr. Wilson recommends the construction
of public works, etc. He then prepares
the plans and specilications.
"As Commissioner of Public Works he
approves his own plans and specifications.
"As Commissioner of .Public Works he
approves his own bills for cost of prepar
inc the plans and specilications.
"As Commissioner awards and signs the
contract.
"As engineer he superintends the work.
"As Commissioner he passes oh and ac
cepts his report as engineer on the com
pletion of the work.
''As engineer he gives the contractor a
certificate for payments due on contract,
and
"As Commissioner approves the claim
and orders it paid.
"When the board (he being one Commis
sioner) orders engineering work done, the
engineer doe? the same.
"And as Commissioner approves the
claim for his own work."
"I never followed the relationship so
closely," said the Mayor, "but I do not
think the iaw ever intended that the way
from any official's office to the treasury
should be quite as smooth."
The dual position of City Attorney Peir
sol is also touched upon. The commu
nication says:
"As attorney he renders an opinion to
Board of Public Works.
"As Commissioner he acts on his opin
ion as City Attorney.
"As Police Commissioner he removed a
Chief of Police and rendered an opinion as
attorney that the action was legal.
"As Commissioner he rejected a bid for
the removal of garbage, but when appear
ing before the Council as City Attorney he
gave an opinion that the bid was legal."
"That's the substance of the whole mat
ter," said Mayor Davie, "and when I
think of it I almost wonder if I, the third
member of the board, should consider my
self in office at all."
INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE
O'Connor, Dam and De Laguna
to Represent the State
University.
New Baseball Grand Standâ Jacob's
Too Numerous Cowsâ The
Woodmen.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 18. â The
debate to determine the debaters who
should represent California against Stan
ford was held to-night. The judges, after
deliberating for fifteen minutes, an
nounced their decision, making O'Connor
'96, Dam '96 and De Laguna '06 the team.
Those who acted as judges were: Judge |
Henshaw, Warren Olney, George D. Met- !
calf, Professor Jones and Dr. Hengstler.
Professor Gayley, after the decision was
given, introduced the iudges to the audi- i
ence, and they made speeches, wishing the
California team godspeed in the contest
with Stanford.
Athletes Visit Stanford.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 18.â Captain
Merwin of the university track athletic â¢
team and Everett Brown, the mile runner, i
went to Stanford to-day to attend the iield
day sports there. They were delegated by
the Athletic Association to witness the ,
games on the Palo Alto grounds, so as to j
become cognizant of Stanford's methods of
training and the time and distance* they
are making. The athletes at Berkeley
seem to feel very uncertain as to the out
conve of tne spring intercollegiate field
day because of weakness in sprinters
and middle-distance men. While it is j
generally believed that Berkeley will win
the contest and thereby add another link
to the unbroken chain of track and field
contests against the wearers of the cardinal,
yet there is a strong feeling that the day
will not be won by bo wide a margin.
Ex-Captain Koch states that Stanford is
training 'his year as she never trained be- |
fore and that ff the pace is kept up until the \
annual meet between the two teams Berke
ley will experience more difficulty in run
ning up a high score that heretofore.
New Baseball Grand Stand.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 18.â A new
baseball grand stand is being erected on
the university grounds. The stand will
be a permanent one and will be so ar- j
ranged as not to be in the way during the
football season. The cost of the stand will
be about $100, which is beinc raised among
the faculty and students. The Telegraph
avenue street-railroad line has given $20
toward the fund. The stand will be large
enough to accommodate about 1200 people
and will be finished in time for the game
on Charter day, the 23d inst., between the !
Varsity nine* and the University Club
team.
Too Many Cows.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 18.â Marshal
Lloyd arrested Jacob Happersberger this
moriing and charged him with violation
of the town ordinance which prohibits the
keeping of more than two cows upon a lot
of less than two acres. Numerous com
plaints against the keeping of cattle have
been made recently from various sections
of the town, particularly in the neighbor
hood of the university grounds, but no ar
rests have been made until to-day. Hap
persbereer will be given a hearing before
Judge James in a few days.
Woodmen Entertain.
BERKELEY, Cal., March 18.â An en
tertainment was given by the local lodge i
of Woodmen of the World in American ;
Hall last night. 'A tug-of-war contest be- :
tween a team from the visiting lodge and
one from the local order was a feature of
the evening. The struggle ended in a
draw. For twenty minutes the two teams
pulled, scarcely succeeding in moving one
another so evenly were they* matched.
At the end of the twenty minutes both
sides were satisfied 'to call it a tie.
Baseball Next Saturday.
â¢ BERKELEY, Cal., March. 18.~Manager
B. P. Miller of the University baseball
team has arranged for a game to take
place nejet Saturday afternoon between
the Varsity nine and a picked team of

Dyer, who captained the U. C. team in

WELLS-FARGO TO BE SUED
W. E. Pettes of Alameda Demands
$5275 for Injuries Received
in a Collision.
A Man Under Arrest Who Is Charged
With Having Acted Wrong to
Young Girls.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 18. -W. E.
Pettes has sued Wells, Fargo & Co. to
recover $52 75 for damages claimed to
have been sustained by reason of the
negligence of that company. On February
6 Mr. Pettes was riding a bicycle on Park
street, near its junction with Alameda
avenue. He was riding between the rails
ol the electric railway, and, in attempting
to turn out, the wheel slipped on the rail
and he was thrown. Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
delivery wagon came along and was nearly
abreast of him as he attempted to turn
out, and when he was thrown he went
directly in front of the horse, which was
going at good speed- to catch a through
train. The horse's hoof struck Mr. Pettes'
head and the wheels of the vehicle passed
over his body, inflicting painful and seri
ous wounds. His head was severely
gashed, and he was confused in his mind
for several days.
He claims that the accident happened
through the negligence and recklessness
of the company's driver and demands
$5000 in damages, $250 for medical attend
ance and $25 for medicines. John T.
Fleming is plaintiff's attorney.
A Serious Chnrge.
ALAMEDA, Cal., March 18.â Constable
yon Kapff arrested William Rasten yester
day in San Francisco and in lieu of bail he
is now contineu in the County Jail.
Rasten is one of the men charged by
Mrs. Lydia Prescott of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children with de
bauching the young girls, Stella Dietrich
and Maud i>ewis. All the parties reside
in Oakland and the offense is alleged'to
have been committed in Oakland. The
accuse^ man. is the carpenter of the bark
Electra, that was moored near Alice-street
drawbridse, and upon which, it is charged,
the offense was committed. The consta
ble took tne Lewis girl with him to iden
tify the accused, and they proceeded to
Spear-street wharf, where the vessel now
lies. The captain declared that the car
penter had not gone aboard, but had gone
to Cloverdale. A search was made of the
cabin, however, but without avail. The
search was then about to be abandoned
when the girl espied him on the wharf.
He took to his tteeL*, but was soon over
taken by the officer.

SMITH SCORES A POINT
Close of the Evidence in the
Donahue Road Election
Case.
WEAK DEFENSE OF DIRECTORS.
Judge Seawell Has Taken Under Ad
visement the Relief to Re Given
the Plaintiff.
The suit of Sydney V. Smith to oust the
directors of the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad was begun before Judge
Seawell yesterday and the case was sub
re itted late in the afternoon.
The most serious points against the
plaintiff were, after much argument, re
fused admittance and the case went to the
Judge with only a weak defense.
Smith was suing to oust P. N. Lilienthal
particularly and to have himself declared
elected to the place. He alleged that when
he came to vote the 42,000 shares of stock
which he thought he owned he was not
allowed to do po and, instead, the stock
was voted by others. In answer it was al
leged that this stocÂ£ was purchased by a
syndicate composed of Smith, Markham
and Foster, and one of the agreements in
regard to it was that it should always be
voted as a unit. Therefore when a differ
ence of opinion arose among the members
of the syndicate as to how ihe stock should
be voted Foster and Markham, being in
ihe majority, voted the stock as they saw
lit and Smith had no say in the matter at
all.
The defense offered the agreement as ev
idence of the right of Foster and Markham
to vote the stock as they saw fit, but
Charles Fase, counsel for Smith, opposed
its admission on the ground that it was
not a proxy and the rights of the defend
ants could only be shown by a proxy. The
court ruled in accordance with this view,
and the agreement was kept out of the
cas".
The question involving 4000 shares held
by Wagoner as proxy for Gundecker was
then taken up, and again a ruling unfav
orable to the defense was' entered. The
defense claimed that Gundecker held the
stock 88 a "dummy" for an Eastern capi
talist and had no right to assign a proxy.
In the election these shares were thrown
out altogether upon that ground, but
Judge Seawell, after arguments on behalf
of the plaintiff, ruled that Gundecker was
a trustee and could transfer a valid proxy.
This closed the case for the defense.
Page then asked for an or.ier of court
declaring that Lilienthal had not been
eletted and putting Smith in his place;
also for an injunction restraining the
other directors from interfering with the
change. This phase of the case was taken
under advisement.
Smith wants an order at once. He is
afraid unless he gets an injunction, which
would settle the matter at once, that the
defendants will take the matter to the Su
preme Court and keep it there indefinitely.
DIFFUSION OF HAPPINESS
Professor Edward Alsworth Ross
Speaks at the Academy
of Sciences.
A Firm Stand Taken Against the
Establishment of Class Distinc
tion in America.
An appreciative audience assembled last
night in the hall of, the Academy of
Sciences to hear the sixth lecture of the
popular course now being given under the
auspices of the Stanford University Club.
The lecturer of the evening was Edward
Alsworth Ross, professor of finance and
economics at the university, whose record j
in tbe State University of Indiana has
made him, though as yet a co mparativelv
young man, an authority on matters con
nected with the study of political economy, j
Professor Ross took for his subject "The 1
Social Diffusion of Enjoyment." His view
of tLe possibilities of human happiness
was somewhat optimistic, but seemed to
meet the approval of his audience, which
frequently interrupted the gifted speaker 1
with bursts of long-sustained applause.
".As social science develops," said the'
t>rofessor, "and as men commence to
arrive at something like a solution of the
problems which meet us at every turn the
art of giving and enjoying pleasure be
comes democratized. At the present time
here in America we notice that the poor i
man's enjoyments are similar in some de- I
gree to those of the millionaire. To be i
cure, the poor man cannot live in a brown-
Etone mansion nor rest his feet on Ax
minster 'carpets, yet he has his decent
bouse and enjoyments such as the laborer
of otl er lands does not even dream of.
'After all there is not such a very great
difference in this country between the rich
and the poor. A man'whh only $300 a
year, of course, has all he can do to stave
off pain and hunger; while he who has
twice as much can do little more. But be- 1
tween the pleasures enjoyed by the man J
having $2000 a year and those of" the form- j
Bate individual who can count on ten
limes that amount yearly, we cannot find
much difference. The fact Is, that in this 1
country, the good things of life seem to be |
the heritage of the man of moderate In- i
come.
"The great social calamity will be tfie es
tablishment of class distinctiori, if such a
pystein can ever take root in this country.
A? lon;r as the poor man can work and ob
tain a just return for his labor, so long
will the distinction between rich and poor
be minimized. Poverty will prove to be
only the whip that urges the poor man on
to the achievement of better things. Thus
a ommon mean of happiness will be
Eecnred to all and one great social problem
Eolved."

OPPOSITION TO
PACIFIC MAIL
Competition to Be Inaug
urated via the Tehuan
tepee Railroad.
THE DEAL NOW PENDING
New York, European and Central
and South American Ports
to Be Reached.
CHEAPER RATES TO PREVAIL.
The Distance Will Be Shortened From
This Port to New York by
About 2000 Miles.
negotiations are now in progress for one
of the most important transportation en
terprises ever inaugurated in thi* City, and
there is every promise of their being car
ried to a successful culmination.
The proposition is to lease tbe Tehuan
tepec Railway from the Mexican Govern
ment, and in connection therewith operate
lines of steamers that will bring this City
into direct and cheap communication with
]Sew York and European ports, and also
with the most important South American,
Central American and Mexican cities.
Charles Dudley Warner in the March
number of the North American Review
calls attention to the great value and need
of such an enterprise, in an article entitled
"Our Foreign Trade and our Consular Ser
vice." Therein he asks the question:
"Why are we beaten by England and Ger
many in our competition for the trade of
Central and South America, and in other
markets where our skill and the quality of
our goods should give us better fortunes?"
One of the prime causes, he says, is lack
of sufficient and regular transportation
between our ports and those of Central
and South America. "Take the case of
San Salvador," he says. "American goods
there have the highest reputation. * * *
The Consuls think that we are at disad
vantage owing to *** lacK of transporta
tion facilities, which produces the anoma
lous result of cheaper freight' rates
from European than from American ports.
With lower freights our goods toiild be
sold cheaper."
Further along he says: "la Pei.i, Eng
land, German}' and other European coun
tries wt'lk away with the bulk of tje trade
that might be ours. * * * "\Vh\3do we
not have its trade *'V In answer htf quotes
from a consular report as follows Â»â¢ "The
failure of the American people aiSl Gov
ernment to provide easy, cheap ant! quick
transportation for mails, freight and
travel must, however, be largely account
able for this condition. * * * Witl'' an en
terprise worthy of imitation* some seventy
European steamers ply regularly between
European ports and Colon. Among these
a Liverpool line has steamers winch, on
their return trip, stop at New Orleans to
complete cargo, but which, on tb< ir way
out, do not stop at New Orleans. The
effect is obvious. New Orleans, the near-
est American seaport â which is the natural
outlet of the great valleys or the Missouri,
the Mississippi and the Ohioâ is left un
disturbed in its strange isolation f.om the
South American countries on tl.e Pacific
Ocean." Continuing in this fine of
The Sloop Yacht Catherine as She Was and as She Now Appears During the Process of Remodeling
thought, Mr. Warner says: "We are at
an equal disadvantage in the trade with
Vrusruay. Here also the first question to
be settled is that of transportation." In
concluding his remarks on the transporta
tion phase of the problem he discusses, the
writer says: "It is agreed on all hands,
by the testimony of manufacturers, mer
chants and consular agents, that a chief
cause of our unsatisfactory trade, as has
been said, especially with the nations
south of us, is a hick of easy, frequent,
recular steam communication!"
It is with a full realization of the situ
ation, an indicated In these views, of one
who has made a thoroueh study of the
question, that the negotiations referred to

pedient at this time to make public the
names of any of the parties interested, but
it is known that they are thoroughly re
liable, are fully in earnest, are capable of
carrying out the scheme and are pressing
the matter with all possible vigor.
Although the Tehuantepec Railroad,
owned by the Mexican Government, and
which extends from Salinas Cruz, on the
Gulf of Tehuantepec, to Coatzacoalcos,
on the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of about
120 miles, has been practically completed
for some time, it is not. however, in shape
to be operated to advantage. The bridges
and culverts are but temporary affairs,
and the road requires to be ballasted
throughout its length. In order to mafte
it of the greatest utility it will also be
necessary to construct a* long and costly
iron pier at each of the terminal ports, so
as to obviate the necessity of lightering, as
is the custom in most ports where the
harbor is shallow. All this will require an
outlay of about $2,000,000. and the Mexi
can Government is not to-day in a posi
tion to meet this expenditure.
In consequence it is disposed to grant
concessions of a liberal character to any
company that will complete the work and
j make the required improvements. Over
tures to this end have been made to an
influential resident in the City of Mexico,
and it is wita this gentleman that negotia
tions are being carried on from this City.
It is proposed to put the Tehuantepec
Railroad in thorough repair, to construct
the piers and arrange for lines of steamers
that shall operate between this City and
New York, between this City and Liver
pool and other European ports via the
rehuantepec Railroad, and also between
tbis City and Central and South American
ports.
It is a well-known fact that the Pacific
Mail is unable to handle all the Central
American traffic or the through business
for New York, and this inability on its
part has tended to retard the growth of
the Central American trade with San
Francisco, which received its great im
petus when the North American Naviga
tion Company entered the field as a com
petitor of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company-
It is claimed that by the Tehuantepec
route the time from San Francisco to New
York will be reduced to twenty days, and
that it will be possible to land goods in
Liverpool twenty-nine days after they
have left this port. The distance to New |
York is shortened 12000 miles as compared
with the Panama route. It is therefore
claimed that not only will this route have
the advantage of time, but that of low j
rates also, due to the reduced cost of oper
ating steamers.
With a possibility of making the trip
between this City and Liverpool inside of
thirty days will come among other things
the opportunity of shipping green fruits, I
or, at least, apples and pears, direct to |
England at low rates and with good pros- I
pects of big profits to the shipper.
Although it is known that the Mexican
Government refused to enier into negotia
tions with C. P. Huntiugtpn for the sale of
the road to him, it is not averse to having I
American capita! and enterprise interested ;
in the road, but only on condition that it j
is operated as an independent and com
peting route, and that its usefulness is de
veloped to the highest possible degree, j
Under such conditions it has signified its |
willingness to make a long lease on very
reasonable terms.
WHITE WINGS ON THE BAY
All Kinds of Craft Are Being
Prepared for Coming
Events.
W. L. Sutherland Is Making Exten
sive Alterations on the Sloop
Catherine.
Yachting circles are taking on new life,
and in all quarters there is great activity
in getting ready for next season. All the j
sloops sre being overhauled. Some have ;
been lengthened and improved, others !
have been sold and will go out under new j
flags, while a considerable quantity of new j
blood will be infused, as several cutters are |
now on the stocks and will be seen in the
next regatta.
W. L. Sutherland h.as practically rebuilt
the sloop Catherine. Two feet was cut
from her stem and four feet from her stern.
When completed she will have an over
hanging stern of six feet, and six feet will
be added to her stem. In this way sne will
gain six feet in length, and will be forty
*ieet on the water line. Her sides have
been opened out and her beam increased
nine inches. In fact, all that will be left of
: the old Catherine will be her keel, amid
ehip timbers and a few planks. The old
i spars and sails will be used.
When completed the sloop is expected
Ito be one of the fastest on the bay. She
; will be 40 feet long, i) feet 7 inches broad
and 3 feet C inches deep. She will be ready
! in two weeks and Captain Sutherland says
j he will then surprise the yachtsmen. The
I accompanying cut shows* the Catherine as
; she was and as she appears on the ways at
| Menotte's yards.
Hay & Wright have a new yacht on the
| stocks for H. Barlege and W\ C. Grayson.
i She will be 47 feet on the water line, 16 feet
I broad and 5 feet deep. She will be cutter
rigged and her owners expect to have her
ready for a cruise by the middle of next
I month.
A syndicate has purchased the yacht
j Clara for $1250 and she will race under the I
â  San Francisco Yacht Club's flag next !
i season. Frank Stone secured her from i
j "Jim" Burdell in exchange for a pteam [
launch last season and raced her in all the I
regattas. She was very successful in her
: , class and her owners say they will mii
i prove her to such an extent that she can
! be looked upon as a sure winner the iirst
j time she starts.
The Rover has had her name painted
out and has changed her color. It was
rumored that she had also chanced hands,
but there is no truth in the statement, and
Commodore Bruce will again be seen in
the van next season.
The first Duke of Maryborough had a
huire Roman nose, the nose of a military

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 19, 1896.
ULTIMATUM OF
THE GAS COMPANY
Basis on Which a Trust
in Light May Be
Formed.
ASSIGNMENT OF SHARES
Edison Directors at First De
clined the Committee's
Proposition.
FRANK WHITTIER RESIGNED.
The Gas Company Then Submitted a
Statement and Now Awaits a
Direct Reply.
Consolidation of the San Francisco Gas
Company and the Edison Electric Light
Company has not yet been effected, but
the indications are that the negotiations
will soon end in the formation of a trust.
The committee on conference, consisting
of Joseph B. CrocKett and George W. Pres
cott, representing gas interests, and J. B.
Stetson and Frank "Whittier, representing
the Edison corporation, held many ses
sions. Various plans were presented and
discussed without agreement in committee.
Finally, the committee agreed on the fol
lowing as a basis of consolidation:
Stock of the combined company to con
sist of 140,000 shares.
The sras company to have 100,000 shares.
The Edison for its 20,200 shares already
out to have 26,993 shares.
The remaining 13,007 shares to be held
to pay bonded and floating indebtedness
of the Edison and to provide a surplus.
It was figured that 8000 shares would
meet the outstanding debt, so 6007 shares
would constitute the surplus holdiner.
According to the calculations of the com
mittee the new concern would have to pay
only on 126,993 shares, hence it was esti
mated that a monthly dividend of 50 cents
a share could be paid, and the stock would
consequently be worth par. In other
word?, the holders of gas stock would be
able to Â£Â«H $100 per share, and the Edison
stockholders $133 per share.
This proposition, when submitted to the
board of directors of the Edison company,
was declined. The directors thought that
that corporation should get \% instead
of 1 1-3.
When this proposition was declined Mr.
Whi*tier, who had been serving as a repre
sentative of Â»he Edison company in the
committee of negotiations, resigned and
refused to participate in further negotia
tions. In his place on the committee L.
P. Di exler was appointed.
Negotiations were then suspended for
several days, but the gas company, deem
ing it expedient to settle the Question one
way or the other, presented its ultimatum.
It is not ascertained .whet her further con
cession was made to the Edison Company,
but if any was granted it was very slight.
Stockholders of tbe gas company assert
that the Edison plant can be duplicated
for half the sum demanded by the Edison
representatives. Hence there is strong ob
jection to consolidation on terms more
favorable to the electric company than
those designated by the conference com
mittee. The fact is kept in sight that a
duplication of the plant would not remove
a competitor from the field.
While many motives may be given for a
consolidation of the companies, the chief
motive is to prevent a competition that
threatens to become so active that all the
profit will be absorbed in the keen struggle
for business.
For some reason the Mutual Electric
bight Company lias not figured as a
dangerous adversary. It has a plant and
is in the business of supplying light, yet
it is not elapsed as a competitor.
Citizens who are not interested as stock
holders in either of the companies believe
that the trust will be formed before the
time arrives for renewing annual con
tracts for lighting the streets and public
i buildings of the City. There is annually
paid from the City treasury about $340,000
I for light.
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1895,
the Han Francisco Gas Company received
for lighting bui.'dines $6350 71; lighting
engine houses, $1324 26; lighting City
lamps, $20(1,277.
The Pacific Gas Improvement Company
received for lighting" public buildings
$20,114 31; lighting engine houses, $2510 64.
The Edison Light and Power Company
received for street illumination $86,015 64.
The Auditor's report for the year ended
June 30. 1895, shows that the demands
audited on the street light fund amounted
to $306,498.
During the same period the School De
partment paid out $5725 for lights.
A dose examination by an expert might
disclose the fact that the Park Commis
sioners and other boards were paying gas
nnd electric light bills not included in the
foregoing.
In dealing with a customer as important
as the City of San Francisco the compa
nies find it to their advantage to pool
issues and divide the contracts. The gen
eral plan pursued is to persuade the Super
visors to allow just as much money for the
service as the taxpayers will tolerate.

THE CORNER OF HER EYE
From That Vantage Rae Alex
ander Watched the
Hypnotist.
HE LOOKED AT HER SISTER.
Has Raised the Grade of His Bill
From That of the Moderately
Poor to the Rich.
Rae Alexander is a rather pretty young
girl of the brunette type, with wavy brown
hair parted in the middle, falling over her
temples. She is employed as amanuensis
and typewriter at the insurance offices
managed by H. M. Grant, 423 California
street, and is the young lady whom Dr.
Abrahams tried to. hypnotize into being
recovered of a severe attack of writer's
cramp.
The spell did not work. She writes now
with her left band and has refused to pay
the doctor's bill, and the doctor, as "a mat
ter of principle," he says, has brought suit.
"Oh, it was a ridiculous fake," said Miss
Alexander yesterday. "I had tried every
thing before I went to him. One physi
cian advised me to try electricity as an ex
periment, but without encouraging me to
hope very strongly. I bought a small bat
tery and gave it a fair trial, but was not
benefited. I was advised to go to a spe
cialist, but they charge so much. Some
one spoke to Dr. Abrahams about my case,
and he asked his informant to send me, as
he could certainly cure me.
"With my siÂ«ter I went to see him, not
knowing anything about his methods. He
told me that the only thing that could
cure me was hypnotism. This surprised
us and I insisted on backing out. But he
said I had better have it attended to at
on6e as the complaint was liable to extend
to my arm and ultimately affect my
whole body. I became frightened, and
when he said that it would cost me noth
ing unless a cure was effected I consented.
"Oh, it makes me laugh, it was such a
fake. He told me to lean back in my
chair and remain perfectly still. He took
a position in front of me, leaned forward
ana told me to look steadily at the bald
spot on his head. Oh, it was ridiculous.
After I had looked at the vacant place for
some time he would have me close my
eyes. Then he wonld say:
11 'Now you are asleep."
' "But I am not asleep,' I would say.
11 'Oh, yes you are,' he would say, "only
you don't know it. You are sound asleep,
and when you awaken your pen paralysis
will have gone.'
"I would keep my eyes shut until he
told me to open them, just to give the thing
all the chance I could, but I felt foolish all
the time, fcr I couldn't help peeping out
of the corners of my eyes and was very I
certain I was quite awake, for I saw all |
that was going on. I noticed that he kept
looking at my sister instead of at me.
Every time I opened my eyes he was look
ing at my sister.
'â¢No, he never touched me, rubbed my
hand or anything of that kind. He de
pended entirely on the hypnotic influence
as he called it. When I opened my eyes he
would have me try to write. Well, I couldn't
hold a pen. See here," and the young
lady laid her trembling right hand upon
the desk. "Does that look as though It
was cured? Then he caused me to raise
my elbow and try to write in that way.
That brings into play an entirely different
set of nerves, of course, and I found that
I could arite reasonably well.
"With a few days' practice I improved
at it. but it. was extremely tiresome and
painful and my arm would constantly drop
down. They undertook in the office here
to devise a plan of holding it up by bands
or rests, as they said it was cruel to have
me write that way; and a physician to
whom one of the officers spoke told me I
must quit it as my arm might become
fixed that way and I would be unable to
get it down. So I did so, and have begun
writing with my left nand.
"Dr. Abrahams sent me a bill at first
for $.30. Then he raised it to $50. Then
he raised it to $100. He told me in the
first place that he had two prices, one for
the rich, the other for the poor. He doesn't
seem to have ever considered me very
poor, but has a notion that I grew suddenJy
very rich. We propose to fight the matter
to the end."
Miss Alexander lives with her mother,
who is an invalid, and her sister at 3021
Washington street.
A NOVEL CRABBOAT.
It Has an Kngine That Is Worked by
Hanripower.
Charley Angelo is one of the best-known
men amon ; crab-h'shers on the water front.
It is rarely that he goes out that he does
not return with a eood catch. He and his
assistant find that it is hard work pulling
against the stream, so Charley determined
to try some other motive power.
He explained his idea to G. B. Gracchi,
the boat-builder, and the crabboat Lo
Vedrenio is the result. A more peculiar
looking craft has never been seen on the
waters of the bay. Amidships thore are
two large flywheels which look as though
tney had been removed bodily from a
coffee-mill. Theseare connected by means
The Crab-Boat Lo Vedremo.
[Sketched by a " Call" artist.]
of two endless chains with the shaft, and
when the boat is to co full speed ahead the
I two men station themselves at the fly
wheels and begin to grind. The harder
they work the more rapidly does the screw
revolve and the faster goes the crabboat.
The Lo Vedremo was launched last Tties
day.and had her trial trip yesterday. The
little boat made good time, and the expe
riment was pronounced a success. When
the crew came ashore, however, they were
bathed in perspiration and vowed that
turning the wheel was much harder work
than tugging at the oar. When there is a
good breeze the screw can be feathered and
the little boat will then proceed under
sail. The fishermen are delighted with the
new departure and a number of the fishing
boats are to be fitted out with similar ma
chinery.

with a Roman nose of generous propor
