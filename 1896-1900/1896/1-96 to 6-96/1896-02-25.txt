MAGUIRE EXPOSES THE TRICK
The Charters of the Indebted Com

Time of Settlement.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.âGen
eral Thomas H. Hubbard, representing
the Searles estate, to-day appeared before
the House Committee on Pacific Railroads
:n connection with the affairs of the Cen
tral Paciric Railroad. The Central Facilie,
he held, to this moment had"lived np to
its contract with the Government notwith
standing reports to the contrary. This be
ing the case, the past should not be talked
of, bat if a solution of the present differ
ences were desired the future should be
considered.
He read at length from the Anderson-
Littler commission report and report of
ex-Governor Pattison regarding the af
fairs of the roads, referring especially to
the charges of discriminations and rebates.
Referring to the Pattison report on land
grants and prolits made from them, he
said the statements were somewhat exag
gerated. If the same reasoning aa that
taken by Governor Pattison were
applied to benetif obtained by the Gov
ernment from increased telegraph and
iCiiities, the results would be fato-
lie asked the committee in considering
matters pertaining to the Union Pacific
to careful y consider whether or not the
company had complied with its obliga
tions to the Government. He thought it
had, and in the light of this fact it seemed
..e- to him that t&e company should
be continuously referred to as "insolvent
anrt unreliable."
With regard to the construction of the
Pacific raiJroads, he said that the Gorern
â  wanted them buift and aid not care
to builu them itself. In order to have pri
vate individuals undertake the enterprise
the Government offered lands and bonds,
suppose, he said, that at this time the
-nment had said to these parties,
"You are to do this without profit,"
would any one have undertaken the work?
The position was taken by some that
those who built the roads were merely
(nivernment agents, strictly accountable
to the Government. As the Central Pa
cific and the Government had both lived
up to the contract the proper way to Bettle
any difficulty was just as any two busi
ness men would do.
He did not think that the Central Pacific
could carry out the obligations proposed
by the Reilly bill of last Congress. The
bill provided for the payment of the first
mortgage bonds in cash. To do this the
road would have to raise $2?.00u,000. He
did not see how this could be done without
assessing its stockholder?. To do this at
present would be to extinguish the stoct
bo far as the present stockholders were
concerned. They were mostly poor, the
majority of them being scattered through
Europe. The money mieht be raised by
getting a syndicate to take new stock.
The method suggested in the Kyle bill, he
thought, could be carried out. 1 his would
let the Government out as a bondholder
and substitute private individuals in its
place. The company could probably pay
its bonds as they matured, but could not
pay the interest.
The Central Pacific could do this, but he
could not sneak for the Union Pacific. He
promised, at the request of Mr. Patterson
of Tennessee, to draw a bill embodying his
views.
Hubbard submitted an entirely new
plan of settlement. The new proposition
is that tne company shall pay the prin
cipal of the Government debt at once and
the balance of the interest due the Govern
ment shall be funded for fifty years at 2
per cent per annum, the sinking fund on
hand to be applied in the payment of the
principal. He admitted, however, that
the company had not authorized him to
P resent that specific plan, and he could
not say positively that the company
would carry it out, but he believed that it
would be eatisfactory. He also admitted
that the reorganization committee of the
In ion I'acific Company had not agreed to
accept it.
It was finally suggested to him by sev
eral members of the committee that be
had better submit his plan to the repre
sentatives of both roads and see if it would
be acceptable to both companies. He
agreed to do so and the committee fixed
Wednesday morning next for a further
hearing on his Dropositiou.
The burden of his argununt outside of
this proposition was that public hostility
to Pacific railroad companies and their di
rectors arose out of an entire misunder
standing of the relation of the latter to
< invernmeiit. The people had an idea that
they werÂ« trustees of the subsidies and
should account to the Government for all
assets above the cost of construction and
operation. They regarded the directors as
thieves because they had made large
profits out of the construction, and they
should be compelled to account to the
Government for such profits.
That was all a mistaKe. They were en
titled to everything above the cost of con
struction, no matter whether they got it
under contracts with themselves or divid
ing it among the stockholders as divi
dends. Tt was none of the Government's
business how they divided.
-Mr. Patterson asked: "Do you think
that if those assets which are claimed to
have been diverted, were on hand now in
the treasuries of the companies, the direct
ors would have a right to divide them |

among themselves or among the stock
holders, knowing the Government claims?"
Hubbard said he thought they would
have that right under the decision of the
I nited States Supreme Court and under
the statutes. There was nothing in the
law to make it fraudulent or wrong.
Patterson called attention to Judge Mc-
Kissick's argument that the Central Pa
cific Company could not be lawfully
made to make any funding contract ex
tending beyond 1911, when its charter ex
pires, and asked Hubbard's opinion of it.
Hubbard said he thought there was
nothing sn the point, as the death of the
company would not interfere with any
liens which it had created on its property.
Chairman Powers agreed with Hubbard.
Maguire said: "That is not the point.
Assuming that the contract would not be
void, but would be binding on the com
pany during its life and on its property
afterward (although my own opinion is
that the contract would be void),
still it must be clear that the fund
ing scheme would absolutely come
to an end in 1011, when the charter of the
life of the company would end absolutely.
The constitution and laws of California not
only prevent the extension and life of the
corporation, but provide that at the end of
its corporate life its assets must be turned
over to the trustees and immediately sold
and the proceeds distributed among the
stockholders after payment of its debts.
Now certainly no contract rnaae by the
corporation in its lifetime can override
that law of California and prevent the dis
tribution of the assets of the company for
a period of eighty years after the time
Jixed by law for such distribution. That
is the position we take on this question,
and I simply wish it to be understood."
Patterson was proceeding to ask Ma
guire another question when Johnson of
California interrupted, saying: 4 'l must
object to any further interruption of Gen
eral Hubbard's argument. He has already
been interrupted a great deal, and it inter
feres both with our understanding and
with this argument."
'1 his stopped the coloquy and General
Hubbard proceeded without further inter
ruption. It is evident that the Union and
Central Pacitic companies have not yet
agreed upon a funding bill.
HEAVY TOK THE BIG TIGHT.
Force* lining Up to Past the Goebel
Jlrpeal Bill.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Feb. 24.â The great
est light that has yet been wagea in the
Kentucky Legislature will open up to
morrow evening in the Senate in the
passage of the bill to repeal the Southern
Pacific charter. The Huntington people
have used every possible effort to prevent
the progress of the bill, and only agreed to
making the measure the especial order for
to-morrow when they were forced to it by
an aye and no vote. The Huntington
people have been quietly preparing for the
war they propose to wage, and will be led
by Senators Thomas H. Hays and Weis
singer of Louisville, and will have the
support of Senator John Bennett and
others.
Senator Goebel will advocate the passage
of the bill and will have the able assist
ance of Senator Taylor and probably Sen
ator McChord and others. Senator Goebel
said to TnÂ£ Call correspondent to-night:
"There is nothing new in the situation.
The bill will come up before the Senate to
morrow and we cannot tell how long it
will be before the measure is disposed of
in this branch, but it will be pushed with
all possible vigor and we believe the bill
will pass easily."
The Huntington managers will base
their main light on the right of the State
to repeal the charter, and claim vested
rights and interference with contracts and
bad faith on the part of the State to repeal
the charter. Senator Goebel is prepared,
and will throw a bombshell into the Hunt
ington camp that will explode all the
methods and practices of the road, and at
the same time answer every legal and
equitable ground of the Southern Pacific
hordes, and make plain the demand of the
California people for the repeal of this
charter, which Huntington has been using
and abusing.
The Huntington lieutenants have
already begun to talk of the bill never be
ing passed, and declare it impossible at
this late day to get a bill through under
the most favorable circumstances in the
remaining four weeks.
The friends of the bill are thoroughly
awake to this line of warfare and have
taken every precaution to facilitate the
measure. The introduction of the dupli
cate bill in the House has done much to
get the measuro well before that brand),
and no delay will be had here. The friends
of the measure hope to see it pass the
Senate before the last of the week.
The opening gun will be fired by Sena
tor Goebel when he calls up the bill, made
a special order for 3 o'clock last Friday,
and it will last till victory perches on the
banner of one or the other, as far as the
Senate is concerned.
Both sides are ready. Both seem con
fident, and just at this time it is difficult
to say juat how the tight will go. The
general opinion, however, is that the vote
will be closer than either side anticipates.
Last week Senator Thomas Hays put the
majority against the bill at twenty-five.
At the same time Senator Goebel said con
fidently but quietly, that the bill would
pass. He named no figure for i majority,
but has counted on a good one all the
week. Of course Major Hays' estimate is
ridiculous. It is not at all probable that
he has ever believed for a mo
ment that out of the thirty-eight
votes in the Senate thirty-two would be
so lost to their sense of decency and duty
as to vote against this bill. Still the Major
may have some groundsâ good from his
viewâ for his confidence as he has person,
ally interviewed every member of the Sen
ate on the subject and '"knows something."
It is to be hoped that he is mistaken. He
is not always right in these matters.
Senator "Jack" Gross, on hearing him
give bis estimate of the majority the other
day, said to him: "Well, Major, I think
you have a hard fight to win at all, and
while I admire your pluck I wouldn't give
a d n for your judgme.it."
While it is not safe to count on too much
the vote the other day on Goebel's foreign
railroad bill maybe taken as an indication
of how the sentiment of the Senate stands
on the repeal question. It passed by a
vote of twenty-five to seven and in the
face of the opposition in the interests of
the roads concerned, Huntington, Eastern
and Western divisions of the N. N. and
M. V. in Kentucky and the Cincinnati
Southern. They had the assistance, too,
of General Duke and the whole force of L.
and N. lobbyist.
The passage of this bill by such an over
whelming majority showed the strong
anti-monopoly sentiment in the State and
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
"Huntington afterward spoke of Messrs. Sutro, Estee,
Cannon, Gibson and others as being 'as uncanny a crowd
as a farmer ever found in his henroost at night. All
these charges emanated from the same parties,' he said."
in the Legislature, and has roused the
monopolies to renewed efforts. There is
no question but that the L. and N-., the
Queen and' Crescent and the Huntington
interests have joined their forces for
mutual protection from what they recog
nize a3 a danger to all if this anti-railroad
sentiment is not smothered. The pres
ence here at this time and the frequent
consultations at General Duke's reception
parlors at the Capitol Hotel of the leading
lobbyists of each road show that they are
acting together.
They will use every effort to beat both
the Goebel bill and McChord's bill giving
full powers to the State Railroad Commis
sion. AU are interested in this latter, and
it is "United we stand, divided we fall."
H. E. Himtington. the nephew of
â¢'Colossus" P., is at the Gibson House in
Cincinnati, and it is understood thar cer
tain of the joint lobby spent a part of
Saturday and Sunday in that city in con
sultation with him.
There can be no doubt as to what the re
sult of that consultation was. The repeal
bill must be defeated at any cost. Figures
are not to be considered. It must be de
feated. If from the nose counting that
they have done it is possible to beat it in
the Senate by "extraordinary induce
ments" for a few votes, a strong fight may
be looked for to-morrow. They know
what they are counting on better than any
one outside can. The open and avowed
advocates and opponents of the bill are, of
course, known, but there are many who
profess to have formed no opinion yet as
to the merits of the question, and have not
decided as to how they will vote. Some
of these men are honest, though very ob
tuse if they have not been able to make up
their minds at this stage of proceedings,
and will be largely influenced by the argu
ments offered in the debate.
Others, it is to be regretted, seem open to
missionary work, and no effort will be
spared by the devout lobovists to convert
them. Some will go on record against the
bill and get out of politics when this ses
sion ends, as the will misrepresents the
sentiments of their constituents. The
sentiment of the people of Kentucky as a
whole is for the repeal of the trust charter,
and the members will know it.
Some, however, if the inducements are
sufficiently large, will brave that senti
ment. There is no questiorÂ».that the Hunt
ington party have an ample fund of "in
ducements" to draw upon and that they
are not going to lose for lack of using them
wherever they are needed.

EVA BOOTH IS
IN COMMAND
Ballington and Wife Retire
From the Salvation
Army.
OMINOUS SIGNS AHEAD.
American Corps May Secede
From the Great English
Organization.
HERBERT SENDS HIS REGRETS.
With Prayers and Tears He Tried to
Prevent the Breach in the
Family.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.âBalling
ton Booth and his wife have retired from
tne command of the Salvation Army of
America. Eva Booth has been placed in
command temporarily. Such instructions
were cabled to her to-day from the London
headquarters. Mr. and Mrs. Booth ac
cepted their dismissal veryquietly. They
were asked if they would go to England or
remain in America.
"We will remain here," said the ex-com
mander. "We are American citizens.
Our children are Americans, and we do
not intend to co to England."
Unquestionably a decided anti-English
feeling has strongly manifested itself in
the ranks of the Salvation Army in this
city. Taken all in all the end looks omi
nous for the American army.
A representative ot tne United Press put
the question to Ballington Booth this
evening if his decision of to-day to accept
the situation and retire from the army was
final. The ex-commander paused a
moment and then said: "Well, that is my
decision to-day. Ido not know what will
be my decision to-morrow."
It is claimed by many Salvationists that
if the commissioned officers of the army
in America should decide to rebel against
English domination and summon to lead
on American Salvation Army Ballington
Booth and his wife they will willingly
respond.
Colonel Nicol, who is leading the fight
against Ballington Booth and his wife, and
who is practically in temporary command
of the army in this country, said this
evening:
"Commissioner Eva Booth met the
officers in council this evening with myself
and made a statement upon the present
difficulty. She afterward met the leading
field and staff officers and received assur
ances of unswerving loyalty to the flag of
the Salvation Army. All likelihood of a
split is over. There will no doubt be a
great fight between both sides for some
time to come, but Eva Booth and her
leaders are confident of an ultimate vic
tory."
Continuing Nicol said: "In making
this change it is farthest from our minds
to make it the opportunity for Anglicizing
the American army. We discarded the
trousers in India and fly the stars and
stripes in America. We adapt ourselves
to John Bull in England and Uncle Sam
in America. "We are one for the rescue of
the whole world."
To-day was a lively day at the head
quarters of the army ia Fourteenth street.
From 10 o'cjock in the morning until iate
in the afternoon a heated conference was
held in the auditorium. The most promi
nent staff officers in America were present.
After the committee from abroad had
stated their side of the case, Mr. and Mrs.
Booth were sent for to give their state
ment. Mr. Booth spoke for an hour and
his wife occupied the same length of time.
The newspaper men were excluded, and
what transpired could not be learned.
At 6 o'clock this evening ex-Commander
Booth called the reporters into his wife's
former office and made the following state
ment:
'"The session to-day was composed of
the most prominent staff officers on the
American field, therefore the most effi
cient, most responsible and most repre
sentative. Some 40,000 adherents were
represented. I emphatically denied the
statement that I was not dismissed, in
proof of which I gave the following:
"First. Colonel Nicol told Mrs. Booth
and myself to prepare for the worst, after
having met Eva Booth on her arrival.
"Secondâ Commandant Herbert Booth
stated that he was empowered to ask Mrs.
Booth and myself for our keys, portfolio
and offices. lat once replied: "Command
ant, I must have your authority from the
chief at London for that.' He replied:
'You can have that before 12 o'clock.' This
was last Thursday.
"Thirdâ He asked two things. One was
whether I would go to London. 1 replied
no, except on our conditions: First, that
three brigadiers from America be present
at all interviews in London. Second, that
Colonel Eadie be at once withdrawn to Eng
land. Third, that Commandant Herbert
Booth go back to London and remain there
during my absence and not return under
any circumstance or pretext whatever un
til my return to the United States.
"Fourth â That Colonel Nicol, the gen
eral's representative, remain here and as
sist in commanding.
"Fifthâ That Commissioner Eva return
to London with me.
"Sixth â That no one else be sent here in
my absence untii I returned.
"Seventh â I to return a week after my
arrival in England.
"Eighthâ That Mrs. Ballington Booth
remain at the military helm of the warship
in the United States during my absence.
"The second, third and fourth conditions
of my request were refused. They said I
must go before a court of inquiry in Lon
don. To go before a court of inquiry
means court-martial. I have done nothing
to be court-martialed for. Then came the
painful episode of Herbert Booth demand
ing my keys. I was then served with a
brief from London which empowered my
removal. We were dismissed. They were
mpowered to do so. Since to-day's ses
sion Mrs. Booth and myself have been
waited upon and questioned as to our
plans. "We propose to quietly retire. We
accept our dismissal. We will probably
turn over all the property in our posses
sion. We will rirst, however, consult law
yers and some of the leading citizens in
the United States.
Mr. and Mrs. Booth shook hands with
the reporters, bade them farewell, and
drove away from the building in a cab.
The following dispatch was posted at
army headquarters this evening:
Toronto, Feb. 24, 1896.
Colonel Nicol: Elucidate to officers and post
on bulletin board. Send copies to editors:
"Comrades: The press has been misinformed
concerning my visit to New York. I have
done my duty with prayers and tears as a
brother to prevent a breach in the family hith
erto unbroken and preserved from an irre
parable calamity. A brother can do no other
than leave consequences with God and time.
You have my truest sympathy in this hour of
trial. You may be relied upon, I Know to
maintain the world-wide union of the Salvation
Army, which is as dear to American Salvation
ists almost as the union of their beloved iand.
Herbert Booth."
Later the following was also posted.
The General has cabled Field Commander
Eva Booth appointing her lo the temporary
command of the Salvation Army forces in the
United States, and this notice i? to say lhat all
officers will irom this date till the arrival of

THE PACIFIC COAST DiriSIOX.
Uncertainty as to tt'hat the Outcome
Will lie.
Brigadier-General Keppel, in command
of the Pacific Coast division, which em
braces California, Nevada, Utah, Western
Wyoming, Arizona and the Hawaiian
Islands, in which there are seventy-five
posts, said yesterday that, not having re
ceived any official dispatches or orders, he
could sot venture an opinion as to the
outcome of the apparent division
in the army.
"The trouble which has arisen," said he,
â¢'is tne most serious that has ever occurred
within our rants, and it may mean a dis
ruption of the organization. If something
is not done to satisfy all who may ' in
terested, it is possible that there will be
seceders, who will do all they can to se
cure control of the affairs of the army.
"The information we have, mainly gath
ered from the newspapers, is such that we
cannot take any action in the premises.
Should there be what is generally known
as 'a split' the posts in this division would
probably take action to determine if they
should follow one leader or another, or
take steps to organize an entirely new
arm y.
"It is really too bad that anything of
this kind should occur, for the army at
this time is in splendid condition and fully
equipped for doing good, and is. doing
good."
The brigadier, in answer to a question,
stated that recently the army adopted a
new device to distinguish the rank of offi
cers. Captains now wear a red edging on
the peak of the cap and on the collar, and
the lieutenants wear yellow.
INVESTIGATION BY METHODISTS.
Report on the Prohibition of Protestant
Marriages in Peru, Bolivia
and Ecuador.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24.â At the meet
ing of Chicago Methodist ministers to-day
a report of a special committee appointed
to investigate the prohibition of Protest
ant marriages in Peru, Bolivia and Ecua
dor and obtain relief, if possible, was preÂ»
sented and adopted amid enthusiasm.
The committee was authorized to continue
the agitation against what the ministers
termed "bigotry and tyrannical intoler
ance." The report stated that Cardinal
Rampolla, the Papal Secretary of State,
had neglected to fultill his promise to in
quire into the matter, although three
registered letters had been sent him.
A letter from Secretary Olney, in reply
to one addressed to the Prevalent, was
also read, stating that the department did
not feel called on to express an opinion in
the matter, because no case involving the
rights of an American citizen bad been
called to the attention of the department.
The report also contained a decree of the
Peruvian Secretary of State, setting aside
an order of the Junta of Callao for the
civil registration of the marriage of Rev.
F. A. Hazeltine. an American citizen in
Peru, and Miss Amy E. Wood, which had
been celebrated according to Protestant
rites, on the ground that such registration
would be a violation of the Peruvian law
and the Council of Trent.
STRIKE OF OARMEST-MAKtiRS.
There Appeara to tie A'o I'roMpect of
Arbitration.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24.â The strike of
the cutters and trimmers is still on in full
force, and there is no prospect of arbitra
tion. The manufacturers claim to have
many men at work, while the strikers as
sert that as fast as men are imported, to
take their places they are captured by the
union pickets and soon after initiated into
the organization.
The executive committee of the strikers
has been corresponding with the union in
Milwaukee, New York and Cincinnati
with a view to the protection of the
strikers' interests. In the event of a Na
tional association of manufacturers being
formed it is de:lared the unions in those
cities will order a sympathetic strike.
WRECKED THE NEWSPAPER
An Angry Crowd of South Da
kotans Raided the Mitchell
"Mail."
Editor McÃride Made Himself Very
Unpopular and Will Be Told
to Leave.
MITCHELL, S. D., Feb. 24.â This
morning a large crowd of citizens of
Mitchell called at the office of the Mail
and demanded that Editor McÃride im
mediately sell them his plant and
leave the city. He refused. Then the
mob proceeded to raid the office, smash
ing the presses and machinery and de
stroying the type. The outfit was com
pletely wrecked.
Some years ago Editor McÃride married
a bister-in-law of John D. Lawler. After a
short married life she obtained a divorce,
charging cruelty, infidelity and robbery of
her money and jewelry. McÃride attrib
uted tb:s action to Lawler's interference,
and from that time nearly every issue of
the paper has been devoted to attacks on
Lawler and attempts to wreck the First
National Bank, of which Lawler was presi
dent.
A few days ago Lawler died suddenly
and the bank went into the bands of the
examiner. Saturday night citizens met
McÃride and offered to buy out his plant
if he would go elsewhere. He agreed, but
later decided to withdraw from the bar
gain. The committee is now looking for
McÃride, and will suggest that he move.
Minrr.l Were Burled Alive.
COLLIERS, W. Va., Feb. 24.â The ex
ploration of an old coal mine near here
has resulted in the discovery of four
human skeletons, beside one of which was
a flask containing a manuscript. The
writing, which was still legible, stated
that the menâ John Ewing, Ben Ayers,
Tom Ackelson and Joe Obney, deserters
took refuge in the mine thirty-two years
ago and were imprisoned by a cave.

DAVENPORT, Exc, Feb. 24. â The

board sailed for Southampton or London.
The strictest secrecy is observed in regard
to the prisoners. Nobody is allowed to
board the ship.
LONDON, Etc., Feb. 24.â A representa
tive of The United Press obtained to-day
an interview with one of Dr. Jameson's
troopers, who arrived at Plymouth from
Port Natal yesterday morning. The man,
whose name was ODea, said he
had spent eight months in Ma
tabeleland as member of the
mounted police. About tne end of
December he was in a state of conval
escence from a violent attack of fever, hia
temperature having at one time been
as high as 105. He had been almost
without lood or water for a week, and
was lying in his tent in a greatly de
bilitated condition when a sergeant came
to him and asked him if he wanted
to lose his place in the mounted
troop. ODea replied in the negative,
whereupon the sergeant ordered him to
appear on parade with his comrades
immediately, which he did. Prior to
the start of Jameson and hii followers
for the Transvaal, which took place at
night, ODea did not hear Dr. Jameson
read a letter, as he is alleged to have read
one, but says he gathered thai the purpose
of the expedition was to protect the
women and children of Johannesburg.
ODea belonged to the advance troop.
He did not see Dr. Jameson after the night
of tneiT leaving Mafeking, nor has he seen
him to this day. He supposed that Jame
son rode in the middle of the troop. The
men hurried forward, riding at the rate of
ten miles an nour with not more than five
hours' rest in two days. They were some
times able to get snatches of sleep on horse
back. They had sufficient rations to last
them until the evening of the second day.
A party of fifty Boers met them and began
a desultory fire upon them, to which
Jameson's followers replied. They had
several skirmishes with Boers before reach
ing Krugersdorp, where the Boers suc
ceeded in enticing Jameson's forces from
the sheltered hillocks into the open valdt,
while they themselves remained under
cover.
ODea expressed his belief that Dr.
Jameson himself hoisted the white flag.
Anyway, if he did not personally hoist it,
the rlatr was raised by his order. When
the Jameson party surrendered, ODea
still had ten rounds of ammunition and
many of the others had not exhausted
their supply. After the surrender
he said the men were fairly well treated.
They were taken to Pretoria, where
they weie corralled on the Pretoria race
course. They were allowed a loaf of bread
and a quarter of a pound of meat a day
for each man. At first he believed that all
of the officers of the expedition and the
non-commissioned officers, with the rank
and file, were to be shot. He heard af
terward that tne Volksraad had re
jected the proposal to shoot them
by a majority of two. Eventually
the men were taken to Port Natal, where
they were free from the moment they went
on board the Harloch Castle. ODea said
it was nis intention to visit Boston, Mass.,
and later to return to the service of the
British South Africa Company. In the
course of his conversation he alluded to
several of his companions, mentioning
Cawston of New York and Morgan of Mon
tana.
ODea gave his address as 198 Congress
street, Boston. Like all of the other
troopers who arrived in England on the
Harloch Castle ha received Â£22 before
landing and expects to receive Â£100 in ad
dition to this from the British South Af
rica Company.
J. Collins of the Lancaster regiment,
which was brought to England by the
transport Victoria, which also brought
Dr. Jameson and his officers from
South Africa, says that Captain Heany,
an American who took part in the raid,
was informed that upon his arrival at
Plymouth that he would be free to disem
bark. He declined, however, to leave the
Victoria, saying that he preferred to re
main with Dr. Jameson.
Nobody on board the Victoria knew the
destination of the steamer when sije left
Davenport and Plymouth to-day; but i
was expected that she would be met at
sea to-night, when Dr. Jameson would be
taken oft.
In its issue to-morrow the Standard will
confirm Major Collins' statement tbat
Captain Heany has resolved to stick by
his leaders. Captain Heany formerly held
a commission in the Rhodesian Horse.
He accompanied Dr. Jameson's expedition
as a scout.

MRS. GRESHAM TO
GET A PENSION
But It Will Be Only Half
of the Recommended
Amount.
ONE HUNDRED A MONTH
Dave Hill Opposes the Proposed
Investigation of Bond
Issues.
MORGAN'S APPEAL FOR CUBA.
,
It Is Time, He Says, That Christianity |
Interfere With Spanish
Cruelties.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.â The
continuation of the speech of Senator Mor
gan of Alabama in the Senate to-day, in
support of tne concurrent resolution for
the recognition of Cuban belligerency, did
not arouse a particle of the excitement
and enthusiasm which the first part of the
speech last Thursday, together with the
other speeches of that day, aroused. It
was too much a historical review, and was
interspersed with the reading of too many
letters and reports, for the most part too
tedious to attract attention or arouse en
thusiasm. The or.ly forcible parts of it
wen- these: Mr. Morgan expressed his as
tonishment that, in view of the Spanish
atrocities in the island, "this grand, free
Republic could sit indifferently by, know
ing the facts, and not unsheath the sword
and strike death to the. brutal monarch
who inflicted them." And he declared |
that the American people "could go no j
further in their forbearance without a
stain on the National honor." He will i
finish his speech to-morrow.
The resolution of- Lodge of Massachu
setts for an inquiry into the facts and cir
cumstances of recent bond issues was
taken up and discussed till the close of
the morning hour, when it went to the
calendar without action. In opposing it
Hill (D.) of New York characterized it as
'a stab in the dark," and as having no
foundation "Dut the wails and complaints
of disappointed bidders."
The bill granting a pension of ?200 a
month to the widow of the Secretary of
State Walter Q. Gresharu, as brigadier
general (with an amendment reported by
the Pensions Committee, reducing the
amount to $100) was taken up, and Turpie
(D.) of Indiana moved that the amend
ment oe concurred in. He proceeded to
address the Senate on the subject. He said
the appointment of Mr. Gresham as Secre
tary of State by President Cleveland had
taken the country by 6urprise, as Mr.
Gresham had never been known asa mem
ber of the Democratic party. It had bten
regarded as a quite singular and broad de
parture from established usage. Mr.
Gresnam had cone into the office of Secre
tary of State as a stranger to those of hi 9
own household and his position was at
tirst one oi political isolation, but not for
long.
The man himself was never isolated.
His modesty, his truth, his moderation of
character and his uniform courtesy soon
established between him and his col
leagues and the members of the two
houses that intimate and direct relation
so necessary to the successful administra
ion of his high office. His career had
been from the camp to the court and fron.
tbe court to the Cabinet. He had receive*. 1
high honors from both the great parties of
the country as if nature had given him
ome strange right of primogeniture.
The committee's amendment was agreed
to and the bill (granting Mrs. Gresham a
pension of $100 a month) was passed.
Gallineer (R.) of New Hampshire, chair
man of the Committee on Pensions, rising
to a question of privilege, referred to cor
respondence in the New York Sun reflect
ing upon that committee for the speed
with which the pension bills were rushed
through the Senate last Wednesday. He
stated that instead of Il'O biils being "passed
in an hour there were sixty-seven bills
passed in two and three-quarter hours.
The total increase in those bills was ex
actly $1006 per month, or $12,072 per year.
He thought the article with its scare head
lines and its misrepresentations was rather
Bmall business for a great metropolitan
journal. Such articles, he said, did much
mischief. They were a wicted and un
justifiable exercise of journalistic enter
prise.
The resolution heretofore offered by
Lodge (K.) of Massachusetts for investiga
tion by the Finance Committee of all the
facts and circumstances connected with
the sale of United States bonds from 1894
to ISOCy, inclusive, was taken up and a sub
stitute for it was offered by Peffer (Pop.)
of Kansas, enlarging the scope of the
inquiry and directing it to be made by a
select committee of rive Senators.
Lodge moved to lay the substitute on
the table. Hill (D.) of New York desired
to discuss the subject, but was cut off by
the motion to lay on the table, Lodge
remarking he had made that motion to cut
off discussion.
The motion to lay on the table was dis
agreed to, and Harris (D.)of Tennessee
moved to amend the substitute by strik
ing out the provision for a select commit
tee and ailowing the inquiry to be con
ducted by the Finance Committee.
Hill (D.) of New York said that so far
as Lodge's resolution was concerned it was
not objectionable in form. It treated the
Secretary of the Treasury courteously and
was in other respects unobjectionable.
But he did not assume tnat it was the
province of the Senate to investigate every
subject that might be suggested by a Sen
ator. Before votinc for such an investiga
tion the Senate should ascertain the mo
tive behind it and the oujects to be sub
eerved by it. It was a strange thing that
every act of a department was to be in
vestigated on the simple, bare suggestion
of a Senator. He was opposed to the
resolution, not because it attacked a
Democratic Secretary of the Treasury ;
lie would oppose it if his worst political
enemy occupied that high office.
At the close of the morning hour the
Lodge and Peffer resolutions went to the
calendar without action and the resolu
tion as 10 the recognition of belligerent
right! in Cuba was taken up, Morgan (D.)
of Alabama resuming his speech in sup
port of the resolution.
Mortran reviewed the history of Cuba for
the last hundred years, dwelling upon the
instances of cruelty and oppression prac
ticed by the Spanish rulers and soldiers on
tha people of the island. The atrocities of
the Spanish troops, he said, shocked the
civilized world. He quoted the statement
of "an accurate and able historian" that
in the last ten years war in the island of
Cuba, the Spanish minister admitted that
in addition to the 13,600 Cubans who had
been killed in battle 45.500 prisoners had
been put to death. When ho first read
! that he said he inquired of himself what
! Christianity had been doing ir. the world
if in this age it was possible that such
things could be done on an island like
Cuba, and that "this grand, free republic
could sit indifferent, knowing the facte
! and not unsheath the sword and strike to
death the brutal monarch who inflicted
it."
Frye (It.) of Maine, asked Morgan to
I state his authority "for that wonderful
I statementâ that horrible statement."
Morgan was sorry to say that he could
not recall the name.
"Is it from history?" Fry asked.
"Yes, deliberately written," Morgan re
plied, "and written by a Spaniard."
"Does the Senator believe it?" Frye
asked.
"I hesitated a long time, ' Morgan re
plied, "to credit it; but to disbelieve I
would have' to disbelieve any deliberate
statement made by a historian in a book
of universal acceptanceâ the American
Encyclopedia.
Call (D.) of Florida, in furthercorrobora
tion of the statement, read some extracts
from a pamphlet by Clarence KTing, re
hearsing instances of horrible atrocities by
the Spanish troops in Cuba.
Morgan resumed his speech. He said
the fact that the American people had
witnessed those struggles for so many
years was enough to prove their faith
ful adhesion to National duty. They
could co no further in their for
bearance without a stain on the
National honor and wthout doing
injustice to the Government and people of
the United States. Morgan read copious
extracts from United States Consuls in
Cuba as to the progress of the insurgents,
and summed them up by saying that the
rising had gone to the extent of a great
public war, and the likelihood was that in
the end the Cubans would achieve their
liberty.
When Morgan took his seat (but without
finishing his speech) White (D.)of Califor
nia offered a substitute for the concurrent
resolution, declaring that the Senate con
templates with solicitude and profound
regret the sufferings and destruction ac
companying the civil conflict now in prog
ress in Cuba, and expressing the trust
that the Executive Department will, as
soon as the facts will warrant, recognize
the belligerency of those who are in arms
against Spafn, and that the good olh'ces of
the United States may be prudently, peace
fully and effectively exerted to the end
that Cuba may be enabled to establish a
permanent government of her own choice.
The subject went over till to-morrow,
svhen Morgan will continue his speech.
The House bill to provide for the exten
sion by rive years of the time within which
suits may be brought to vacate and annul
land patents to railroad companies, was
reported from the Committee on Pubiic
Lands, discussed briefly and passed.
The Vice-President announced his signa
ture to the urgent deficiency bill.
After a short executive session, the Sen
ate at 5: 45 p. M. adjourned until to-morrow.
CAROLINE VERY JEALOUS
Mrs. Hoyt Objects to the Nice
Criticism of Alice Pierces
Acting.
And Now an Attempt Is Made to
Force the Young Woman Out
of the Company.
BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 24.â There is trou
ble in Charles H. Hoyt's "A Contented
Woman" company. Caroline Miskel Hoyt
is charged with being jealous of one of the
other women in the company, 'and the
matter is to be aired in the courts here the
first Monday in March. The interested
parties are Mr. and Mrs. Hoyt, Mrs. Mary
Pierce, who has been playing the part of
the strong-minded woman in the piece,
and her fair daughter, Alice, who was also
in the company. Mrs. Pierce tells the fol
lowing tale:
"Alice, who is but 16, has been taking a
light comedy part in the play. Previous
to putting this show on the road we worked
for Mr. Hoyt, and had no trouble. Last
September Mr. Hoyt signed a forty weeks'
contract with Alice and announced to the
public that it was for three years. Every
thing was all right till we played in Sau
Francisco. There the papers criticized
Mrs. Hoyt's work severely and boomed
Alice, giving her three times the attention
they did Mrs. Hoyt. Tnen Mrs. Hoyt and
the stage manager began trying to force
Alice out of ihe company. The critics
were even worse in Chicago. There was
quite a little feeling about the notices Alice
and Mrs. rfoyt were gettin.'. When we
here Mr. Hoyt told me he would need us
no longer. I asked him why, and he said
Alice was inimical to harmony in the com
pany. He would not say why. Mr. Hoyt
refuges to discuss the case."
It is said in theatrical circles that Mrs.
Hoyt objected to its beine pointed out
that her value as an actress lay wholly in
her physical charms.
AFTER THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC.
Methods That I>o Sot Please the Trunk
Lines,
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24.â The railroads
in the Trunk Line Association have noti
fied the Southern Pacific that they will no
longer pay a share of the commissions
charged by that line on transcontinental
business secured by Southern Pacific
agents in Europe. The Southern Pacific,
not being a member of the Western Im
migrant Clearing-house, has been getting
the largest share of immigrant business
by paying agents in Europe, and the trunk
lines have taken this action to force the
South crn Pacific to abandon such agencies
or bea r all the expense.
The direct lines to Colorado are whet
ting their scalping-kniTe^for the Southern
Pacific, and threaten a general cut in Cali
fornia passenger rates if their lival does
not stop its practice of getting big party
business by routine from the Pacific or
Atlantic in a roundabout way. The latest
grievance is that the Southern Pacific is
negotiating for a large party from Phila
delphia by its Morgan line of steamers to
Gafveston, thence via its Sunset route to
the Denver and Gulf road, which will
carry the party of settlers into Colorado,
if the threat of a war does not have the
desired effect.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
EDUCATION OF
THE INDIANS.
As Usual, There Is a Bitter
Contest in the
House.
THE CONTRACT SCHOOLS.
Sectarianism the Basis of an
Argument in Making the
Appropriation.
ONE PROVISION CAST ASIDE.
The Secretary of the Interior Not
Permitted to Spend Money as
in the Past.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.â The
perennial contest over the appropriation
of money for the education of Indian
children at contract sectarian schools came
up in the House to-day in the course of the
consideration of the Indian appropriation
bill, and was fought out in an hour and a
half. The result was that by a vote of 93
to 64 the provision that the Secretary of the
Interior shall make contracts with present
contract schools for the education of Indian
pupils to an extent not exceeding 60 per
cent on the amount so used for the fiscal
year 1595 was stricken out, on motion by
Linton (R.) of Michigan and an amendment
inserted preventing the Secretary of the
Interior from spending any of the money
appropriated for education in a sectarian
institution.
Under the existing condition only Cath
olic schools are in contract relations with
the Interior Department, the other
churches having abandoned their claims
for public money. In his speech in sup
port of the amendment Linton attributed
the overwhelming change in the personnel
in the House by the election of 1894 to the
sentiment in the country against the ap
propriations of public funds for sectarian
schools of instructions. The amendment
was advocated by Cooper (R.) of Wiscon
sin. Pearson (R.) of North Carolina, Wat
son (R.) of Ohio, Haines (R.) of Nebraska
and Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, and opposed
by Gamble (R.) of South Dakota, Eddy
(R.) of Minnesota, Walsh (D.) of New
York and Sherman (R.) of New York.
Consideration of the bill was concluded
with the exception of the paragraph di
recting the porcbaaa of title of the Ogden
Land Company to the lands within the
Allegheny and Catteraugus reservations
in New York and that was postponed until
to-morrow.
By agreement between Sherman (R.) of
New York, chairman of the Committee on
Indian Affairs, and Babcock (R.) of Wis
consin, chairman of the Committee on
Affairs of the District of Columbia, it wa^
decided to postpone consideration of Jdis
trict business, the special order for to-day,
under the rules, until the completion of
consideration of the Indian appropriation
bill, the unfinished business on the cal
endar, and the House proceeded in com
mittee of the whole to further consider the
Indian bill. Herrmann (R.) of Oregon
offered an amendment provided that lands
allotted in severalty to Indians and held
in trust by the United States shall be sub
ject to the same taxes as are levied against
other lands in the same county or town, to
be paid out of the United States treasury
as loner as the trust lasts. It was rejected
on a point of order as new legislation,
raised by Sherman (R.) of New York.
The provision in the bill inserted by the
Indian Commission giving the Puyallup
Indians authority to sell their allotted
lands in the Tacoraa reservation was
stricken out on a point of order that it was
new legislation.
A provision appropriating $5000 to enable
the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate
for the surrender or modification of exist
ing treaties was ruled out on a point of
order.
A provision giving all children of mar
riages between white men and Indian w o
men the rights of the tribe to which the
mother belongs was also stricken out be
cause it changed existing law.
When the section of the bill making ap
propriations for the support of schools was
reached there followed an hour's discussion
of the sectarian-school matter, opened by
Linton (R.) of Michigan, in opposition to
the practice. Linton read a telegram re
ferring to the approaching unveiling of
the statue of Father Marquette in Statu
ary Hall, which stated that the ceremonies
would be attended by Cardinals Satolli
and Gibbons, the French and Italian Em
bassadors and other prominent person
ages.
"Father Stephan." he commented in
conclusion, "who has labored assiduously
in this behalf for a long time, may think it
is a good time now that there is impend
ing the unveiling of a statue of Father
Marquette, clothed in tuejcowl and robe
and surrounded by the paraphernalia of
his order, in the presence of the high
dignitaries of the church in Statuary
Hall, a place made honorable by the
j great names in connection therewith, the
I .statue overshadowing that of Lincoln, to
aftk the passage of a bill making an
appropriation of $^50,000 to his church.
But I don't think so, and I believe that
I this House does not think so either."
Linton offered an amendment reciting
that it was the intention of the bill that
no money appropriated for schools
should be expended for the education of
children in sectarian schools.
The action of the committee was de
fended by Gamble of South Dakota, who
said the appropriation carried in the bill
was calculated upon the principle agreed
upon two years ago, of reducing the
amount by 20 per cent every year. The
amendment offered by Linton was sup
ported by Cooper (R.) of Wisconsin and
Watson (R.) of Ohio, Ilainer (11.) of Ne
braska and Pearson (R.) of North Caro
lina, the latter offering an amendment
thereto increasing the amount appropri
ated for school support from $1,135,000 to
$1,335,000, the additional $200,000 to enable
the Secretary of the Interior to provide
the necessary school accommodations.
Eddy (R. ) of New York advocated the
provisions of the bill, and Walsh (D.) of
New York followed in a warm defense of
the Catholic church.
Pearson, upon the strength of Walsh's
statement that the Catholic schools would
not be closed whether the money was ap
propriated for them or not, withdrew his
amendment.
In closing the discussion on the bill
Sherman (R.) of New York said the use
of the contract schools had been solicited
by the Government upon the suggestion of
General Grant, then President, and for a
quarter of a century appropriations had
been made for their support. To strike
them down now in a moment, Sherman
said with much emphasis, was neither just
nor right.
Watson (R.) of Ohio, interrupted to ask
Sherman if he believed that in case the
appropriations should be denied the chilr
dren would not be educated.
Shermanâ I believe that the Govern
ment should sustain any sect, I don't care
what it is, which will reach down and
attempt to shed light into the minds of
the dusky little wards of the Nation. The
Catholic church has some rights. lam
not a Catholic, but I do say that to me no
single creed can point the way to heaven,
and I do say that any creed is better than
no creed. [Applause.]
The amendment was agreed to â 93 to 64,
the announcement of the vote being greeted
with applause on the floor and in the
galleries. At 5:05 o'clock, having com
pleted consideration of the bill, except a
single paragraph relating to the extinguish
ment of the title of the Ogden Land Com
pany to lands in the Allegheny and Cat
taraugus reservations, New York, the com
mittee rose.
The Speaker announced that he had
signed the urgent deficiency and diplo
matic and consular appropriation bills,
and at 5:10 o'clock the House, on motion
of Dingle; (R.) of Maine, adjourned until
to-morrow.

DES MOINES, lowa, Feb. 24.â The at
torneys for Edward Claycolm, the grave
robber arrested here Friday for shipping
stolen bodies into the State from Omaha,
applied for and secured a writ of habeas
corpus this morning. While the proceed
ing was in progress officers arrived from
Omaha for Claycolm, who has been posi
tively identified as a leading member of
the gang of jrhouls. To day they learned
that the writ was likely to be issued, and
induced the authorities here to turn the
man over to them. They had taken him
away from the city jail only a short time
when an officer arrived with the writ.
When a Deputy Sheriff arrived with tbe
writ and demanded the prisoner, he was
told the roan had been set at liberty. The
Omaha cfhcprs had no authority to take
the man out of the State, not having time
to secure requisition papers.JJThey took
Claycolm to a private place, where he is
now con tined in a room and closely
guarded. He will be kept until the requisi
tion papers come, unless the Sheriff with
the habeas corpus writ rinds him. Every
effort is being made to serve the writ, but
without BUOCesa thus far. Trains are
watched and it is pretty certain no effort
will be made to take him out of tne city.

Interesting Saval Jtrcord of the Self ridge
Family.
WASHINGTON, D. 0., Feb. 24.â 0n the
27th inst. the naval register will have on
its rolls for the first time in its history two
officers of the navy who are father and
son, and who have reached the highest
obtainable rank allowed by law. There is
still a third member of this family in the
navy, a younger brother, who now holds
the rank of lieutenant-commander.
Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge holds the
senior oflice on the retired list, where he
was placed soon after the war. His son,
Commodore Selfridge, is now the senior
commodore, but on February 27 he be
comes the junior rear-admiral of the ser
vice, his promotion giving his youngpr
brother a number and bringing all three of
the family closer together in the matter of
promotion.
Commodore Selfridge is now command
ing the European station and has three or
four years of active duty still before him.
His promotion will result from the retire
ment of Admiral Carpenter, recently de
tachod from the Asiatic station and now
at his home in New Hampshire. Ten
years ago Commodore Selfridge had a son
Id the navy, so tnat of the family there
are at one time four members iD the ser
vice.
The senior member of the family was
appointed a midshipman in the navy in
18i8, served through the war and in 1866
was retired with the rank of rear-admiral.
His son was appointed to the navy in 1851
and became a commodore two years ago.
The younger brother is now a iieut( nant
commander and was appointed to the ser
vice in 1804.

fSpecia.l Correspondence of The United Press.]
GEORGETOWN, British Guiana, Feb.
10.â On the eve of the departure of the
United States mail from this colony, a re
port has gained currency that further and
serious complications are likely to arise in
connection with the question of boundaries
between the colony of British Guiana and
Venezuela. It is reported that the Ven
ezuelan Government has within the past
day or two lodged with the Government of
British Guiana, to be forwarded to the Im
perial Government, a protest against any
concession of land within the contested
territory being granted by the British
Government. The report is said to be
couched in courteous but firm laneuage,
and when a halt is called by the Colonial
Government in granting and the Imperial
Government in approving of further con
cessions within the contested regions,
there may be trouble that has hitherto
been avoided.
It is not difficult to find the cause for
Venezuela taking this fresh move in the
question of territory limits of the coun
tries. The British Secretary of State for
the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, has
made no secret of the fact that he has been
handed an application of a large number
of capitalists for a large tract of land in
the disputed territory ; that these capital
ists offer to purchase for a large sum a
specific tract of land in the northwestern
district, with absolute right to the mine
rals and precious stones therein, timber
rights and township rights, as well as
leave to sell the concession or portions of
it to public companies. This application
is under consideration by the local Gov
ernment at the present time.
When this offer became known in the
more influential circles in this colony the
British Guiana chartered company was in
stituted and they have now transmitted to
the Secretary of State, through the
Colonial Government, a petition for a con
cession of crown lands on the' right bank
of the Cuyuni River to the western
boundary of thÂ« colony. Of course the
chartered company in their zeal seem to
have overlooked the fact that the "western
boundary of tbe colony" is still undefined.
But again there is no secrecy about the
fact that the concession applied for by the
chartered company is the same as was in
dicated in a dispatch from the Secretary of
State to the Governor of this colony when
he referred to the necessity for immediate
opening up the interior of the colony and
went on to add how it was possible "cap
italists might be found in the colony who
would be prepared to purchase for a capital
Bum a concession of a fair portion of the
gold field in the northwest district.
The granting of the concession is con
sidered an absolute certainty, and tbis
view is considered to be greatly strength
ened from tbe fact that the chartered com
pany has given an undertaking to hand
over to the Government of the colony
within two years after the granting of the
concession the sum of $000,000 to be ex
pended in the construction of roads and
bridges to connect the concession with the
coast, and to have a further working capi
tal of $750,000, and in case of failure to
comply with those terms to forfeit the con
cession.
The situation in British Guiana remains
unchanged. The colonists have accepted
and absolutely rely upon the statement of
the administration that the home Govern
ment will assert their territorial rights up
to the Schomburgk line, at least. And as
no move has been made to disturb the ex
isting arrangement of affairs the colonists
treat with cool indifference the pretensions
of the Venezuelans.
Colonel Mclnnis, the inspector-general
of police, who proceeded to Yuruan on a
visst of inspection a few weeks ago, has re
turned to Georgetown. Beyond the or
dinary exchange of the corps of police at
Yuruan, some eight men, not a single
movement has been made in that direc
tion up to the present time.
OLNEY OB CARLISLE.
Either Would Be Supported by J'residtnt
Cleveland.
NEW YORK, Feb. 24.â A Herald special
from Washington says: The general opin
ion is that there will be a good deal of
Olney among the delegates when they
meet in Chicago next July. The close
friends of Secretary Olney say that he is
not looking for the nomination. Yet, they
say, that should the nomination be offered
to him he would not refuse it.
For several months there has been talk
in Washington of Olney being the nomi
nee. The movement has been growing in
force until it has assumed importance. It
is believed that the time is not far distant
when Cleveland will unequivocally an
nounce his position in regard to a renpm
ination; that he will decline again to be a
candidate, and that all of his influence
will be exerted in behalf of his successor.
With Whitney declining to be a candi
date one can see but two men whom the
President could cordially support. One is
Richard Olney ; the other is Johu G. Car
lisle.

â PREPARING TO CELEBRATE.
There Will lie a Rift Demonstration of a
Texas Anniversary.
DALLAS, Tex., Feb. 24.â Delegates from
all over the State are beginning to gather
at the Commercial Club for the purpose of
initiating a movement looking to the cele
bration of the fiftieth anniversary of Texan
statehood next year. In this connection
the acquisition to the United States of all
those sister States and Territories added
to the American Union by the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo will also be commem
orated.
Governor C. A. Culberson, who does not
believe in superstition, recently appointed
thirteen delegates to represent the State
at large: Francis R. Lubbock of Austin,
(.iuy M. Bryan of Quintana. Philip Sanger
of Dallas, D. H. Scot of Paris, N. Weeks
of Galyeston, W. H. Gcrtzendaner of VVax
ahachie, H. J. Goldberg of Fort Worth,
W. C. Robards of San Antonio, Henry
Henky of Houston, George Hardwick of
Sherman, C. H. Allyr^of Corsicana, Mark
Weiss of Beaumont and S. W. Slayden of
Waco.
The hall in which the gathering will be
held is artistically decorated with cut
flowers, potted plants in bloom, palms and
evergreens, as well as mottoes, Hags and
other appropriate emblems. These pre
parations have been under the direction of
a committee of ladies oi this city, of which
Mrs. Sydney Smith is chairman and Mrs.
S. Isadore Miner secretary. The plans to
be submitted to the convention for con
sideration provide for the holding of an ex
position of a national character, all the
territory formerly in the boundary of
Texas to participate in the administrative
work, and to the end that the resources of
the Lone Star State may be demonstrated
to the world.
JSATIOSAL SOLT>IEItS> HOMES.
Inmates -Vot Compelled to Take the Gold
Cure.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.-General
Martin T. McMahon is secretary of the
board of managers of the National Homes
for Volunteer Soldiers. There are 18,000
men inmates in these homes.
General McMahon said yesterday that
the charges ot mismanagement going the
rounds of the press emanated from a prom
inent official in the War Department, who
was urging the abolition of the board of
managers and the brin?intr of the homes
under the control ot the War Department.
"I also," said General McMahon, "brand
as absolutely false the statement that the
old soldiers are compelled to take the gold
cure. Colonel Andy Smith, the governor
of the Leavenworth home, who is a Keely
graduate, petitioned the board for the
establisnrnent of a Keely cure at the Leav
enwortti home. It decreased drunkenness
there 50 per cent, and since then a Keely
branch has been located at each of the
several homes."
COX I) VOTED BY WOMEN.
St. Louis Society Shocked by the Diseov-
cry of Gambling liens.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., Feb. 24.-The morally
inclined of St. Louis society were shocked
yesterday by an expose in a local paper of
a number of regular garubling-houses con
ducted by women in the fashionable
We9t End. There are at least six resorts
west of Grand avenue run by sirens of the
card table, who know as much about
"throwing threes to the top" or "bottom
dealing" as the veriest card sharp that
ever shuffled a poker deck.
Some of the women have more or less
social position, but their course of late has
been such as to make them notorious and
their homes a by-word among the men
about town. Young business men, bank
clerks, bookkeepers, doctors, dentists and
lawyers fond of a little gambling have
been attracted to their tables and have
considered it a rare privilege to be per
mitted to be separated from their money,
which they have been to a liberal extent."
WAH OJS'CE VERY WEALTHY.
Death of A.lanaon Weed in a Brooklyn
Lodging- House.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.â Alanson
Weed, well connected and once wealthy,
died suddenly yesterday morning in a
lodginp-house at 219 Adams street, Brook
lyn. He was a nephew of the late Thur
low Weed. When his body was searched
a newspaper cutting wa3 found in his
pocket-book indicating that he was one of
the heirs to a $2,0(X>,0(K) estate left by Seth
Chauncey Weed of New York.
The address of Mrs. Sarah B. Weed of
725 Monroe street was contained in the
pocket-boot, but when called on Mrs.
Weed denied that she knew the man. She
said that her husband had left her twenty
years before and she knew nothing about
what had become of him.
f'oitml Gold oh His Farm.
ANDERSON, Ind., Feb. 24. â Robert
Spauldinp:, an old California gold miner,
now owner of a large farm north of this
city, found $70 gold ore protruding from
a bluff on his farm Saturday, and after
satisfying himselt brought samples to this
city. The samples indicate that it will
run from $70 to $75 to the ton. An Ander
son capitalist made an offer yesterday of
$500 an acre for the twenty surrounding
acres, but the offer was refused. Spaulding
has the means and will develop it him
self.

A Mining Man Falls Right on
His Feet in This State.
Found Some Camps That Did Not
"Pan Out."
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN THIS
â¢*- world that will stand as landmarks as long
; as the English language is spoken, and not an
Inconspicuous one is the typical Californlan
gold-miner. He ha* fewer traits that leave a,
disagreeable memory than most of the rugged
' types of the world; and he has more of the
: genuine manly spirit than most people who get
i lauded for their conspicuous bravery. Accus-
! tomed to face hard times as well as "the har-
i vest of plenty," he learns, without knowing It
almost, to sympathize with the "weak and
I weary." And when things do not look par
; ticularly roseate with him he accepts the con
| dition of affairs with a complacency that Is
! matchless as well as admirable. One of the
i younger men who to-day are to be found try-
; Ing to carve out for themselves "name and
! fame" in the mines is Mr. A. Burton, who is
: now in the great gold-bearing section of Grass
i Valley. Mr. Burton is an honest, good-natured
; fellow. He has had nis share of misfortune,
I too, and when a few months ago he was Strieker
| right in tie middle of his work with a most
i dangerous disease it seemed as though fate had
! determined to "down him." Hut he imme-
\ diately "struck out" for the Hudson Medical
| Institute, the institution which has become so
famous on account of the wonderfully clever
j work of the specialists practicing there, and as
a result he is back at work again, and thank-
ful for what has been done for him. He has
written as follows to the managers :
GRASS VALLEY, CaL.. Aug. 15, 1895.
Hudson Medical Institute. San Francisco. i al â
Gentlemen: I have received three letters from
you which were sent to I'ownipvillp. I have been
to Gold Valley and to Nevada and through nearly
all the mining camps ever since, and that was the
reason that I did not set my mull before. ThÂ«
medicine that 1 took did m.- lots of goo I, and I
B'aall soon send for some more. Yours r<-spe-l-
*ully, A. BURTON.
So although Mr. Burton has not "struck it
very rich" in the mining camps recently he
certainly made no mistake when he became
sick as to where to go. But every one has the
same experience who applies to this "Mecca
for all the sick" for assistance. Thousands of
testimonials Dear out the absolute truth of this
assertion. For instance:
F. Minturn, St. Louis, Mo. : "I desire to ex-
press my sincere thanks for the careful and
conscientious manner in which my case has
been treated by you."
S. M. Hooker of Los Angeles writes: "I now
feel as though I am a cured and a well man."
i K. C. Taf of Stov.e, Cal., says : "I am feeling
fine without a sign of disease now."
G. H. Bent: "By the time I get the medicine
taken that I have now I don't think that I will
need any more."
It is a satisfactory thing to see all these ex-
pressions of good opinion and good will coming
in, as they do, by the hundreds daily to the
(physicians of the great Hudson Institute, af-
fording further proof that if you are suffering
from any curable disease there is no plac*

and were of the most impressive char
acter. The church was crowded with
spectators, among whom were the most
prominent residents of the city and cler
gymen of other denominations. A mass
of dwarf palms banked in the
lectern, a dense greenery of the
same shrubs stood behind the pul
pit and on the altar mingled with thedark,
. green of many foliage plants were
great bunches of lilies. Beyond the palms,
but only half concealed by them, were the
members of an orchestra in surplices and
frocics.

opened and a long procession emerged.
There came first an acolyte, bearing aloft a
long, narrow silk banner, on which was
worked a cross. Behind him was

rochet, and finally in their full episcopal
robes and gorgeous hoods Bishops Talbot
of Wyoming and Idaho, Abiel Leonard of
Nevada, Utah and Western Colorado;
William Leonard of Ohio; Worthington
of Nebraska, and Davies of Michigan, and
Gailor, Bishop Coadjutor of Tennessee.
Simultaneously with the appearance of
the choir boys, the grand organ, the or
chestra and the choir began the rendition
of the procession hymn, "O Godof Lignt.'

FOR LAND GRANT FORFEITURES.
Judge Caldwell Grants an Order Authorizing
the Federal Authorities to Sue
Railroads.
OMAHA, Nebr., Feb. 24.â As predicted
c United Press Saturday night, the
'-overnment has ordered suits for land-
forfeiture against the Union Pacific
Railway.
.taut T'nited States Attorney Rush
has returned from St. Louis, where he se
cured an order from Judge Caldwell of the
Court of Appeals to make the receivers of
the Umon Pacific Railway parties de
fendant in land grant forfeiture suits.
H<- has liied in the United States
Circuit Court petitions in equity in two
cases, wherein the United States is plain
tiff and tne Union Pacific Railway Com
pany et a), defendants in one case and the
Union Pacific and the Sioux City arid
l'acific companies defendants in the
other. The subpenaa in the caset.
will be given to the Marshal at once, and
the work of serving them begun. It is
doubted very much whether they can all
be served in the time required by law. and
in that event the case will go over to the
next term of court.
Outside of the two railroadsâ the Union
Pacific and the Sioux City and Pacific
set out in the title of the petition, the de
fendants will not be much affected by the
suit if they can show they have a bona
ride title to the land in their possession.
A third case in which the Burlington
road will be the defendant will be tiled
early in March.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.âAc
cording to news received from San Juan
del Norte, Nicaragua, an uprising is again
imminent in that country. Newspapers
have been suppressed, but reports
brought to San Juan by passengers
from the interior are to the effect that the
city of Leon has declared itself in favor of
Baca against President Zelaya and de
mand's Zelaya's resignation. Zelaya con
siders he is strong enough to put down Â£he
movement, trusting for support to the
Conservatives and the friendly Govern
ment of Honduras. He has discharged
all citizens of Leon from his ser-
vice and demands that the city
surrender its arms and full sub
mission. He is endeavoring to obtain the
assistance of ex-President Zavala of
Granada. Great excitement prevailed
throughout Nicaragua, especially as
most of the National arms and am
munition are in Leon. The
latest advices are that Zelaya has declared
himself Dictator and that all his Ministry
have left him. At last reports the people
of Lfion were up in arms and a fight was
imminent.

Three Important ISilla lieforc the House
Cotiunittee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 24.-It was
decided by the House Committee on Bank
ing and Currency this morning that at
their next meeting they will consider three
bills of more than ordinary importance.
One permits banks to issue circulation to
the par value of their bonds.
Another restricts the "borrowing of a
band's funds by the officers without the
full knowledge of the directors, while the
third looks to the establishment of an
international bank, which was one of the
recommendations of the late Pan-Ameri
dan Congress.
The vote of the committee on the first
named bill is expected to be close, while it
is predicted that the bill having reference
to the borrowing of money from
banks by its officers will be de
feated. The committee looks with
considerable favor upon the bill establish
ing an international bank in this country,
but the question has been raised whether
such a measure would be constitutional.

ing paper says: "The iron steamer Ber
muda, flying the British flag, was boarded
and seized by revenue officers off Liberty
Island late last night.
The Bermuda has been under the watch
of Si>anish spies for some time. They had
reason to believe she had been bought by
Cuban revolutionists and was fitting out
as a hllibusterer. She has been anchored
off Liberty Island since last Saturday, and
yesterday there was evidence that she was
preparing for sea.
At 11 p. m., just after a large party of
Cubans had gone aboard, the revenue cut
ter Hudson steamed alongside and a board
ing party arrested all on the Bermuda. At
midnight the revenue steamer Channler
started down the bay to catch a lighter
loaded with amunition and look for an
other part)' of Cubans who had started to
board the Bermuda.
The Bermuda was an English built
steamer, formerly running in the Outer
bridge line. She was recently purchased
by a firm suspected of being in league with
the revolutionary party.
Last Saturday she was taken to the coal
docks at Point Liberty and there coaled
up. Then she went to the Lib
erty Island anchorage. Clearance pa
pers were taken out yesterday for
tbe Bermuda to sail for Santa
Martha, United States of Colombia. Ap
plication was made at the office of the
British Consul after the closing hours of
business to snip a cr?w.
A vice-consul innocently went aboard
and signed the crew on the ship.
SPAXIARDS VMO 1(1 AXXIOUS.
More Concerned With. American Senti-
went Than IClectiotiÃ.
MADRID, Spain, Feb. 24.â The turn the
Cuban campaign has taken has strength
ened the Cabinet. Prime Minister Cano
vas del Castille will issue a decree this
week dissolving the Cortes and fixing the
middle of March as the time for holding
the elections for new members.
The Government is less concerned with
the result of the elections than with the
consequences of public opinion in Amer
ica and Congress possibly compelling
President Cleveland to alter his friendly
attitude toward Spain.
NO STEI'S FOR REFORM.
However, So One Expects the Present
Sultan to Act.
LONDON, Eng.. Feb. 24.â The Standard
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Constantinople saying that no steps what
ever have been taken by the Porte to in
augurate the reforms that were promised
for Armenia and Macedonia.
Nobody conversant with the Yildiz
Palace methods expects that any reforms
will be instituted during the Sultan's life
time.
Lord Salisbury has communicated to
the Armenian Relief Committee, a report
from Sir Philip Currle, the British Embas
saaor at Constantinople, in which he
states that the misery ana sickness among
the refugees at Zeitoun is considerable,
their distress is added to by the bitter cold
weather that is prevailing. The Turkish
officials are unable to assist the sufferers,
and there is nobody in the country to whom
they can appeai for relief. Moreover,
these demands made upon the Constanti
nople committee are already so heavy that
it is feared that the committee will be pre
cluded from helping the Zeitounlis.
Evacuation of Egypt.
LONDON. Eng., Feb. 24.â The Pall Mall
Gazette' 9 correspondent in Rome tele
graphs that advices received there from
Cario say there is no doubt that the Brit
ish Government has entered into the ne
gotiations with France upon the subject of
the evacuation of Egypt. It is believed, the
advices say, that Great Britain is inclined
to make concessions to France.
LOSS TO SCOTCH FARMERS
Complaint Made in the Commons
of the Exclusion of Cattle
From Canada.
Some of the Statesmen Willing to
Follow the American Rule of
Debate.
LONDON, Exo., Feb. 24.â 1n the House
of Commons to-day Sir J. G. S. Kinloch,
Radical member for East Perthshire, who
had previously given notice of his inten
tion, asked the Right Hon. Walter Long,
President of the Board of Agriculture,
whether, in view of the enormous loss
to the farmers of Scotland, resulting from
the exclusion of Canadian store cattle
from Great Britain, there was any pros
pect of reopening the British ports to
such cattle. He did not expect an answer
to this question, he said, in view of
Mr. Long's statement in the House
last week in introducing the bill amend
ing the diseases of animals act of 1894,
making the restrictions placed upon the
importation of cattle permanent instead
of leaving them to the discretion of the
Board of Agriculture, and he wished to
a*k Mr. Long if he believed that pleuro
pneumonia in cattle really existed in
Canada.
Mr. Long said he could not answer that
question upon such short notice, but that
he would say that the Department of Ag
riculture certainly thought that pleuro
pneumonia could be introduced into Eng
land from cattle imported from Canada.
Mr. Sydney Gedge, Conservative mem
ber for Walsall, asked Sir Miciinel Hicks-
Beach, Chancelk>r of the pjxehequer, that,
in view of the high price of consols and
the intended heavy expenditures on the
navy, the Government immediately bring
in a bill enabling the large surplus "in the
budget to be used for naval purposes
instead of applying it to the reduction of
the national debt by the purchase of con
sols.
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach said he was un
able as yet to state the intentions of the
Government in regard to the disposition of
the surplus.
. The House then debated the proposal
of the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, First
Lord of the Treasury and Government
leader in the House, to alter
the procedure fio that Fridays, hitherto
devoted to the discussion of private mem
bers' bills, should be henceforth devotedjto
the discussion of the Government esti
mates, which discussion must be com
pleted in twenty-four days. This pro
posed alteration, which involves a time
limit, is based on the meihod suggested
some years ago by Mr. Joseph Chamber
lain in an article in the Nineteenth Cen
tury, entitled "Shall we Americanize our
institutions?"
Sir William Yornon Harcourt, the oppo
sition leader in the House, said he pre
ferred the original scheme as suggested by
Mr. Chamberlain, but added that he
would agree to Fridays being devoted to
the estimates. He did not approve of ap
plying closure after twenty Fridays, as Mr.
Balfour proposed. Mr. Balfour announced
that the Government was willing to try
the experiment for a year.
THE riEnEXHOKP EXLOHIOS*
President Kruger't Significant Talk to
the Itelief Committee.
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Feb.
24.â Inquiry into the causes of the recent
explosion of dynamite at Viedendorp, a
suburb of this city, has elicited the fact
that a trucklond of detonars brought from
Port Elizabeth was placed on a side track
at the Bramfontey freight depot. A loco
motive in shifting cars came in collision
with the car containing the detonators, the
contents of thecar exploded from the shock
and the explosion of the detonators caused
the explosion of the dynamite which was
contained in cars standing on a track near
by-
President Kruirer addressed the commit
tee that was formed to relieve the sufferers
by the explosion. In the course of his re
remarks he highly praised the work done
by the committee and said :
"You have done to others as you would
wish to be done by. Those who have given
as yon have can expect to receive a great
deal themselves."
This is construed to be a promise of
large concessions to the Uitlanders.
JV'o Date Yet Fixed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 24.â Ex-
President Harrison stated to-day through
his private secretary, Mr. Tibbeits, tnathe
had not completed arrangements for his
marriage to Mrs. Diramick, and that no
date whatever has been fixed upon for the
ceremony. It was published in the morning
newspapers that he would be married on
April 6, and that Rev. J. Wesley Brown
of St. Thomas Church will otticiate. To a
reporter Mr. Tibbetts said to-day at the
Fifth-avenue Hotel that neither the ex-
Presulent nor he, as private secretary, had
written to the, Rev. Dr. Brown fixing

MISSION SANTA
BARBARA LEGACY
James McMahon's Claim to
Millions Will Be
Contested.
HIS STATEMENT DENIED.
Father Reynarius Declares That
the titles Are Vested in
the Church.
HELD IN BISHOP MORA'S NAME.
It Is Alleged That the Claimant's
Brother Never Resided at the
Monastery.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal, Feb. 24.â
James McMahon, whose claim to the valu
able property belonging to the old mission
here was given publicity through the col
umns of last Sunday's Call, will find
that he has a struggle on his hands when
he attempts to prove hi 3 title. McMahon
claimed that his brother, John McMahon,
an ex-priest, has for years held the titles to
all the mission property; that they are to
day in his name. The property is now
valued at $15,000,000 and McMahon is pre
paring to contest for its possession. But at
the mission the claimant's story is scouted
as fablous and many of his statements are
called into question.
A correspondent, detailed to investigate
that portion of McMahon'a statements
concerning his brother, the ex-priest,
Father John McMahon, to-day visited the
old Mission church and was assured by
Father Keynarius that McMahon's asser
tion that his brother once held the titles
to the property of the mission and that
the titles are now in his name was an un
founded claim.
McMahon is said to have come to Santa
Barbara in 1863, departing for the
East in 1867. The records of the
mission properties here are short
and simple. In the year 1825 the
Mexican Congress repealed the law passed
two years previously secularizing the mis
sion properties throughout California, and
all the lands and buildings throughout
the State were placed in the name of the
Bishop of Sonora, in trust for the church.
In 1840 the properties passed into the
hands of Garcia Diego y Moreno, a Fran
ciscan father, who ruled as Bishop for but
six years, dying at the end of that period.
His tomb is beneath the floor of the mis
sion church, marked by a neat tablet,
crowned with the wide brimmed hat the
Bishop wore in life and inscribed with his
name. He was succeeded by Archbishop
Alemany, who in turn was followed by
Archbishop Riordan.
When the dioceses of Sacramento and
: Los Angeles were created the properties
! belonging to these sections were placed in
! the bands of their respective Bishops, that
j of Santa Barbara having been in the name
of Bishop Mora ever since, The venerable
Fattier For be?, who has been at the Santa
I Barbara Mission since 1865, two years after
| McMahon is said to have taken up his
j abode in the monastery and two years be
! fore his alleged departure, positively de
! Clares that no McMahon was ever con
; nec'.ed with the church and monastery in
any capacity. Father Forbes, curiously
enough, is a native of County Monaghan,
j which McMahon claims as his birthplace.
FOR THE VICE-PRESIDENCY
Senator Perkins of California
Will Be in the Race at
St. Louis.
At Present His Boom Is Being
Launched by State Senator
Gleaves.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb 24.â Senator
George C. Perkins will be a candidate for
the nomination of Yice-Presdent before
the Republican National Convention. At
least this is the announcement made to
night by State Senator J. M. Gleaves, one
of the members of the California Lt-gisla
tuae now in Washington on business con
nected with pending legislation.
Senator Gleaves has alwaya been a
stanch friend of Perkins and was one of
his most loyal supporters in the last Sena
torial light. He has been in conference
with a number of Republican leaders in
Washington and he says that he has found
that Senator Perkins' nomination will be
a very popular one.
Senator Perkins discussed Senator
Gleaves' move in his behalf in a very
modest fashion when seen to-night by a
Call representative. He was not seekine
office, he said. In fact, he could serve the
State better in the Senate than in any
other office. Still, the nomination for
Vice-President was an honor that few men
would decline if offered them. It had not
been offered to him, he said, and he did
not know that it would be.
Upon whom this honor should be con
ferred was a question that could not be
settled at the present time. At least, it
was not customary to make Vice-Presi
dents a month ahead as they did Presi
dents.
'Vice-Presidents," said he, "are gen
erally made in a night.
Senator Gleaves is very enthusiastic over
Perjcins' boom, which he has started, and
expresses himself as confident that it will
meet with no small amount of considera
tion at the hands of the Republican man
agers.
"I believe," said Senator Gleaves, "that
the nomination of Senator Perkins for
Vice-President, would practically insure
the solid electoral vole of the great West
for the Republican ticket. He is essen
tially a man of the people, popular, con
servative and strong. While he is
a free silver advocate, he is
by no means radical on that question. I
believe that at the St. Louis convention
the West will demand some substantial
recognition. It will ask for a candidate
or a silver plank in the platfofm. The
judgment of Western Republicans
with whom I have talked is that
the nomination of Senator Perkins
will be a happy solution of the problem to
be presented to the convention. He wili
be bacKed by the entire Pacific Coast dele
gation, and his support will be loyal and
enthusiastic."
Death of a Moted Evangelist.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24. -Rev. R. F.
Parshall, an evangelist of National repu
tation in the Baptist church, died at his
home last night from the effect of a rail
road accident at Toma, Wis., nine years
ago. His ministry included charges from
Otsego County, New York, where he was
born Beventy-three years ago, to Sacra
mento, Cal. His services of half a cen
tury resulted in many new churches and
over 70,000 conversions.

JIM CORBETT AGREEABLE
Willing to Appear for the Purse
(Jffered for a Fight With
Fitzsimmons.
At the Same time the Bolinghroke
Club Accepts the Ex-Champion's
Apology.
CLEVELAND, Oino, Feb. 24.â James J.
Corbett has received a cablegram inform
ing him that the Bolingbroke Clubof Lon
don offers a purse of $8000 to be contested for
by himself and Bob Fitzsimmons and will
allow each $500 for expenses. Corbett said
to a United Press reporter that he would
accept the offer and would sign the articles
of agreement as soon as the Bolingbroke
Club forwarded them. He also said that
as a guaranty of his sincerity he would
deposit as large a sum of money as the
club wished.
He would ignore the bluff made by Sla
vin, who, he said, had been whipped so
often that he could hardly be regarded as
a fighter. Fitzsimmons, he said, was the
man he was after, but he did not believe
Fitzsimmons would ever face him in a
ring. He thought he was merely trying to
advertfse himself.
LONDON, Eno., Feb. 24.â The Sporting
Life says the Bolingbroke Club has re
plied to William Brady, Corbett's man
ager, offering a purse of $8000 for
a tight between Corbett and Fitz-
Simmons. The club will also allow
each man $500 for expenses. The fight, if
arranged, is to take place during Derby
"Week. The paper adds that the National
Sporting Club has agreed to accept
Corbett's proffered apology for the
languaee he used against the club,
providing he ratifies c proposal
to fight Fitzsimmons before that club.
The club rejected Corbett's suggestion that
the referee of the fight be an American.
The Bolingbroke Club offers $2500 for a
fight between Ted Pritchard and "Mysteri
ous Billy" Smith.

Take Deep Offense at the
Strictures.
''HUGGING SET TO MUSIC."
He Declares That Those Who At
tended a Native Sons' Ball Are
Doomed to Perdition.
WOODLAND, Cal., Feb. 24.â N0 minis
ter of the gospel ever created such a sensa
tion in Woodland as did the Rev. Mr.
Small from the pulpit of the Christian
Church last night. His subject was, "From
the Bailroora to Hell,' 1 and for the occa
sion he occupied the position of censor
rather than a spiritual adviser. The auai
torium of the church, which is the largest
in the city, was crowded until standing
room was at a premium.
Rev. Mr. Small commenced his discourse
by a comparison of the evils resulting from
the pleasures of Woodland's society dances
in a spiritual and moral sense to the stench
arising from the carcass of a hog. He
characterized dancing as "hugging set to
music," and said those who took part in it
were prompted solely by the baser in
stincts.
"Every one of you," he continued, re
ferring to the members of his congrega
tion, "who attended the Native Sons' ball
the other night â every one of you, I say â
is down on the devil's notebook, and as he
noted your names he gave an extra wag of
his tail."
This statement created an uncomiortable
feeling, and necks were craned in every
direction throughout the church.
"Suppose," said Mr. Small, "that any
husband in this house on his leturn home
to-night should find his wife in the em
brace of a minister, her head resting upon
his breast, his arm encircling her waist, as
is the position assumed at the da^ce, I ask
what would he do? Shoot him, of course !
I claim that it is the husbands God-given
right, and his only, to clasp his wife in his
arms. Society people's opinion will not
admit this, but the opinion of such people
does not amount to the weight of a feather
with me."
He concluded his remarks by inveighing
against the other ministers of the city for
not going into wholesale condemnation of
the dancing portion of Woodland* society,
and severely censured Rev. Dr. de Lew,
pastor of the Episcopal Church.
Public opinion censures the divine for
his arraignment of ilancers, not so much
because he opposed the pastime as because
of the language usod. There was no cast
ing about for words, and many ladies nave
taken deep offense at the sermon.
JO.ARIN COUSTI OUTLAWS.

Westgnte for Robbery.
SAN RAFAEL, Cat,., Feb. 24.-The trial
of Amelio Morelas and Crockett Westgate
for robbing Cheta's store at Marshalls, in
Marin county, has been set for .March 3.
Both men have pleaded "not guilty."
The case has excited some interest
as it is hoped that the gang of lawless men
to which Morelas and Westgate belonged
has been broken up. Morelas is the
man who threatened to commit suicide
unless Sheriff Harrison took him out of
the "haunted" cell in the San Rafael jail.
Morelas claimed that a ghost visited him
in the prison, and he begged the Sheriff to
put him into some other cell.

PLEASED WITH CALIFORNIA
The Visitors Are Enthusiastic Over
the Prospect of Soon Owning
Homes in This State.
CHICO, Cal., Feb. 24.â Red Bluff, the
Antelope Valley and surrounding country
were to-day visited by the adrence guard
of hundreds of Easterners who intend to
take up homes at the Ashurst colony.
They came to view the land and arrange
for the arrival of the colonists they repre
sent.
All are greatly pleased with what they
have seen of California, and upon their re
turn to the East they wiil doubtless lose
no time in the preparations for the jour
ney, which will end in their becoming
permanent residents of this State. The
future settlers whom this advance guard
represents are Baid to number about 1600
persons.
The tourists passed through Chico last
night in a special car attached to the Ore
gon express. There were twenty-two in
the party, including men, women and
children. Their car was left standing at
the Red Bluff depot, and they spent the
night iv it. Early this morning C. 13.
Ashurst and Homer Wilson had teams in
readiness and took the visitors for a drive.
They went through Antelope Valley and
visited other places in the vicinity of Red
Bluff.
They were an intelligent-looking set of
men. One while here visited tne Weather
Bureau and asked for data concerning the
climate. The party returned to town from
the ride in time to take tne 1:30 o'clock
train for Kirkwood, being escorted by
Messrs. Ashurst and Wilson. They will
have their tourist car attached to the Ore-
gon express next Sunday night and start
on their return journey to the East.
At Berendos, while visiting the Luck
now colony, the Easterners were pre
sented with lemons, oranges and bautiful
flowers, which greatly pleased and sur
prised them.
These people form a committee which is
to view the colony and have the land laid
out for settlement. The colony is to be
conducted on the co-operative plan, with
stores, blacksmith-shops, etc. Included
in the committee are:
\Y. Hasson of Tacoma, F. H. Baldwin of
Massachusetts, Theodore N. Case of Chi
cago, L. D. FoÃter, wife and daughter and
.1. S. Fyfe, wife and child of Chicago, H. i
E. T. Coffin of New York, P, S. Foster of i
Chicago, Mrs. Ruth Prosser of Chicago, E.
J. Holden of Chicago. F. 13. Wakenian of
New York. William Ekythe of Chicago, L.
Henry and wife of Chicago, C. E. Layler j
of Chicago, Theodore Perry of Chicago '
and Charles A. Willis of New York.
The Ashurst colony land is of a red,
sandy loam, similar to foothill land; in
fact much of it is on rolling ground. It is
more suitable for citrus fruits than any
other, barring all chances of heavy frosts.
There are thousands of acres in the tract,
and the prices range from $30 to $75 per
acre. Some of it may bring even higher
prices than that.
Before leaving for the East some of the
party will visit Chico, when they will be
shown over this part of the valley. The
committee represents thousands of dol
lars, and the location in this valley of the
colony it represents means much to
Northern California.

SENTENCED AT TACOMA.
Ex-City Treasurer McCauley to
IPass Four Years in State
Prison.
His Attorneys at Once Serve Notice
of an Appeal to the Supreme
Court.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 24.â J. W. Mc-
Cauley, the e:i-city treasurer, convicted of
making profit on public funds by drawing
ing interest on deposits iv the defunct Co
lumbia National bank, was to-day sen
tenced t6 four years in the penitentiary.
Ex-City Treasurer George W. Boggs, who
preceded him, has already been sentenced
to six years for a like offense. McCauley
this afternoon furnished bail in the sum
of $10,000 and left the cell which he had
been incarcerated since his conviction. He
has taken an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Boggs is still in jail awaiting a hearing of
his case on an appeal before the Supreme
Court. In the meantime he is developing
into a first-class cook, under the tuition of
a Chinese prisoner.
When court opened this morning the at
torneys for McCauley did not attempt to
argue* the motions which they had pre
pared in arrest of judgment and for a new
trial in his case, but contented themselves
with merely presenting motions iv a for
mal manner and having them overruled,
so that the record for the purposes of ap
peal might be preserved in legal shape.
This done, McCauley was asked to stand
up, and the court ordered him committed
to the State penitentiary, to remain there
four years. The notice of appeal was then
given and the court fixed the bail.
FRESNO CREDITORS MOURN.
David Arnst Disappears, Leaving Many
Unpaid Bills and His Wife and
Children Destitute.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 24.â David Arnst,
who for the past live months has been
conducting a bar and bowling alley on I
street in this city, has left for parts un
known, leaving a score or more business
men to bewail the uncertainty of the credit
system. Several local cigar-dealers are
among those who placed reliance in Arnst's
honesty. A San Francisco liquor firm got
"nipped" to the extent of $1000 and a well
known brewery $3uO. The saddest feature
of Arnst's escapade is the fact that he has
apparently deserted his wife, whom he
left with two small children and without a
cent of money.
A woman known as Spanish Ruby dis
appeared hiniultaneonsly with Arnst and
it is generally believed they left here to
gether. It is said that the pair stopped at
Buker.sfield, but this information may not
be authentic.

PORT TOWN SEND, Wash., Feb. 24.â
The report reached here this morning that
there is much uneasiness in the west end
of Clallam County over the threats of the
Ozette Indians there to avenge the death
of Phillip Brown, one of their number,
who was killed some months ago by a
white man, Henry Anderson. Anderson
was discharged from custody at Port An
geles on Wednesday last, and the scores of
redskins, including several powerful
chiefs, who attended the trial, declare that
they will avenge Brown's death with the
blood oi whites.
Some months ago Andarson killed an
Ozette Indian, who, after claiming certain
sealskins owned by the white man, at
tempted to stab him. Anderson was too
quick for the redskin and killed him. The
County Judge at Port Angeles disclaimed
jurisdiction and referred the case to the
United States court, which in turn dis
claimed the right to try him. Anderson
believed the matter settled and recently
shipped on a sealing-schooner, which by
stress of weather was forced into Neah
Bay, the home of the dead Indian. Here
he was arrested again and conducted un
der guard to Port Angeles.
The Indians, in the meantime, had
been stirred to a high pitch by a renegade
white man and at the instance of the lat
ter raised ?BGO to pay for prosecuting An
derson. The case just ended was remark
able from the fact that rive nations were
represented, and testimony taken in as
many tongues. It resulted in an ac
quittal. The Indians, incensed at the
killing, were made doubly so by the
money thrown away, and left their reser
vations vowing vengeance on every white
man who fell in their hands.
In bygone days the Indians of the coast
I agencies were notorious for their cruelty
j to shipwrecked crews and all others so un
' fortunate as to get In theirclutches. Many
of the old leaders in past massacres are
I still Hying and need only this to fan the
j spark of old-time hatred into a flame.
The settlers are preparing to make a
: vigorous resistance against any depreda-
I tions.

while dressed as an Indian scout and en
deavoring to organize a Wild West show,
was examined before Judge Lorigan this
morning as to his sanity. He appeared
rational enough, and said that ten "days in
jail had convinced him that it was impos
sible to organize a fiesta in San Jose, and

DEADLY ASSAULT
AT SACRAMENTO
Rounder Brock McGraw
Cuts the Throat of a
Stranger.
HE GIVES NO WARNING.
Had Been Hooted by Small Boys
and Attacked the First
Man He Met.
HIS VICTIM MAY RECOVES.
McGraw Is at Large and the Police
Are Searching the City to
Find Him.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Feb. 24.-A bru
tal and wholly unwarranted assault
was made this evening upon John
Doherty, a stranger in Sacramento,
at the Southern Pacific freight depot.
Doherty was attacked without warning
by Brock McGraw, who slashed the
stranger's throat with a knife, inflicting a
wound that may prove fatal. McGraw
claimed that Doherty had been hooting at
him, though as a matter of fact Doherty
had not uttered a word during the time he
was at the depot.
Doherty was sitting: on the edge of the
platform when a man whom he never
saw before walked across the street and
strode up to him. The newcomer accused
Doherty of having "suyed" him, and
without warning slashed him across the
threat with a long knife. The weapon
barely missed the jugular vein. It was as
certained later that his assailant was Mc-
Graw, who is an opium fiend and hanger
on of disreputable places. The police are
searching far him.
Doherty received a terrible gash, but the
doctors say he has a chance for recovery.
He says he has been here but a few days,
and is a workingman.
It seems some boys in the street near
where Doherty sat- had been quite noisy,
and McGraw, who was seated in a lodging
house parlor with a female companion,
supposed they were all jeering at him, so
he left his room, went down to the street
and made the murderous assault on Doh
erty.
CHALLENGED BY STANFORD
Basket-Bail Champions Throw
Down the Gauntlet to
Berkeley.
Athletic Co-eds Are Now Seeking
New Fields to Conquer Across
the Bay.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Feb.
24.â Captain Stella McCray of the Stan
ford basket-ball team has issued a formal
challenge to the Berkeley co-eds to play a
match game. Until the answer is received
and it is definitely known whether the
game will take place the time and loca
tion of the contest will rest in doubt. The
athletic. spirit is quite as strong among
the young women of the university a3
among the men, though there is gener
ally less aaid about it.
In the women's gymnasium there are
fully as large a proportion of the co-eds
taking regular class instruction as there
are men in the boys' gymnasium. In
tennis the women always have plenty of
entries to make things interesting, and
now in basket-ball their reputation threat
ens that of the heroes of the "gridiron."
Mis" McCray is proua of her team, and
in a modest way hopes that a game may
be satisfactorily arranged with the fair
opponents across the bay. This is but fol
lowing out the policy of the Stanford
Women's Athletic Association, as outlined
in The Call sometime ago: i.e. that
intercollegiate games be arranged not only
in basket-ball but also in tenni?.
Gange, the baseball coach, arrived to-day
and will begin work with the players at
once. He will, as much as possible, give
the men instructions individually, and
especially the infielaers and battery. There
is every prospect that a large number of
men will turn out now for daily field
practice.
Joaquin Miller, the poet of the Sierras,
is to deliver a lecture to-morrow evening to
the students in the chapel on "A Hint
From Nature." The chapel will doubtless
be crowded to hear the famous bard. On
Friday evening next Dr. Jordan will lec
ture before the Longfellow Society at
BerKeley on "Heredity From William the
Norman and ourselves."
BAXTA BAIIBAUA. ATHLETES.
High School Toiitha Who Are Crowding
Pacific Const Records.
SANTA BARBARA, Cat,., Feb. 24.â
Professor Edward B. Clapp, professor of
Greek in the State University, who is pay
ing an ofÃcial visit to the Santa Barbara
High School, declares that the school is
now equal in rank to the be&t in the State
with the one exception of Greek, which is
not included in its course.
Professor Clapp, who represents the
Berkeley faculty in athletics and whose
opinion in all matters pertaining to physi
cal prowess and training is regarded with
respect, has been looking over the records
recently made by Santa Barbara High
School boys in various contests, and ex
presses the greatest surprise at the re
sults, declaring that they are unparalleled
among boyo of their ape. He is especially
impressed by the records made by Ansel
Birtch, the 100-yard sprinter, and Coleman
Brouchton, who holds the iocal record for
the 220-yard and 440-yard dashes and the
running broad jump, declaring that these
two boys can get the Pacific Coast record
and hold it. Regarding Birtch, he asserts
that if without training he can make the
record he holds of 10 seconds on the 100
--yard dash, witn proper training he can
beat the world's record.
SAD DEATH A.T VALLEJO.
Life of a Child. Crushed Out by a Granite
Monument Which Toppled, on It.
VALLEJO, Cal., Feb. 24.â Crape hangs
before the door at the nome of Mr. and
Mrs. M. Russell on Florida street. Their
four and a half year old boy was found at
5 o'clock this afternoon in Doyle Brothers'
marble -yard pinned beneath a granite
monument that had fallen on and crushed
out his life.
The child had been missed by his
mother since noon, and a careful search
had been made, but without avail, until
Thomas Coffee, a stonecutter, noticed that
the monument, which was a small one,
had toppled over. When he went to raise
it he found the little body lying bineath,
cold in death. It was taken at once to the
Russell home, and Assistant County Pa y
sician Hoean and Coroner Trull were sum
moned. They found that death had re
sulted from suffocation. Although the
granite was heavy there appeared no
bruises upon the body.
ENJOINED AT MODESTO.
Irrigation Tax Collectors Cannot Sell the
Property of Delinquents Pending a De
cision on the Wright Act.
MODESTO, Cal., Feb. 24.-The tax
payers of the Modesto and Turlock irriga
tion districts have been in a very unsatis
factory state of m md for some time past.
Because of the case pending before the
United States Supreme Court involving
the legality of the Wright law the prop
erty-holders did not pay any taxes wnen
due. The case was submitted, but no decis
ion has been rendered. Large landholders
did not want their land sold for delin
quency, nor did they want to pay taxes.
To-day was the date set for the sale of
the property of delinquent taxpayers in
both districts. Collectors ga^e notice that
they had a right to postpone the date of
the sale from day to day for three weeks,
but could not delay until a decision was
handed down from the Supreme Court.
To-day injunctions were granted by Judge
Budd of Stockton, sitting in the Stanis
laus court, restraining indefinitely the
collectors of both districts from selling
property, giving time for a decision from
the higher court.
m
CARHON WITNESS PERSECUTED.
Joseph l,angevin, Who Testified. Against
Heney, Again Arrested.
CARSON, Nev., Feb. 24.â Joseph Lange
vin, who was the principal witness in the
trial of James Heney, convicted of rob
bing the mint, was to-day again placed
under arrest, this time on a charge of
using obscene language on the streets.
He was bailed out in a snort time. Lange
vin has been arrested for insanity and for
other alleged causes.
During the trial of Heney, Langevin
swore that he had been paid money to
leave the country and not testify against
the suspect. He accepted the money, but
instead of leav.ng Carson went upon the
stand and told of the transaction. Since
testifying, Langevin has been persecuted
by some one, evidently with ttie intention
of driving him from the State.
DUST-STORM ON THE SEA
Peculiar Phenomenon Encoun
tered by the Steel Ship
Scottish Dales.
Sails of the Vessel Covered by a Pow
dered Substance Which Fell
in Clouds.
TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 24.â The Scot
tish Dales is one of the finest ships that
has put into this harbor this season. Un
like many of the later steel clippers, it is
free from the inhospitable cold iron decks
and has instead fine wooden floors
throughout.
Its houses are ample and airy, its long
bridges and all its woodwork are richly
carved and well taken care of. The ship
is of 1929 tons register and carries 2300
tons dead weight. The trip from Hum
burg to San Diego was made in 146 days,
the Scottish Dales being delayed by con
tinuous storms.
When off the River Platte, in the Areen
tine llepublic, the Scottish Dales had a
most peculiar experience. The masts and
spurs were covered with a fine white
dust which came in clouds. It was of
a very light nature and fell over the deck
in large quantities. When rubbed be
tween the fingers it would gradually
evaporate and disappear. It is believed
the dust was from some volcano then in
eruption in the Andes Mountain?.
Captain Thomas McCarthy of the Scot
tish Dales said it was one of ihe most
remarkable phenomena he had ever seen.
The captain also had a mutinied crew to
deal with, but subdued them without loss
of life. The Scottish Dales is from Ham
burg, Germany, with cement.
JSORTHERX PACIFIC MUDDLE.
Receiver Burleigh'a Friends Believe That
//â  Cannot Jie Ousted,
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 24. â Federal
Judge Hanford, pursuant to the recent
decision of four Supreme Court Justices,
to-day set March 3 as the date upon which
his Honor and Circuit Judge Gilbert will
meet in this city to confirm or reject the
appointment of the receivers named by
Judge Jenkins for the Eastern District of
Wisconsin. The order in part reads:
"The Farmers' Loan and Trust Com
pany, having heretofore by its attorneys,
Messrs. Spooner & Sanders, made appli
cation to Hon. Judge Gilbert at San Fran
cisco to remove Andrew P. Burleijrh and
to confirm the appointment of Messrs.
Bigelow and McHenry as receivers of the
Northern Pacific property, under an ap
pointment heretofore made by the United
States Circuit Court of Wisconsin, it is
ordered that the 3d of March, at 10 o'clock,
is hereby designated for hearing any appli
cation by party or parties to this court for
the appointment of any other or additional
receivers."
The friends of Receiver Burleigh, who is
now in New York, assert that Judges Gil
bert and Hanford will not remove him,
and that in this case even the Supremo
Court Justices cannot depose him or force
local Judges to remove him from the
receivership under their jurisdiction, ex
tending over the States of Washignton.Ore
gon, Idaho and Montana.
WOODLAXD ROBBERS CAUGHT.
Attempt of Two Men to Loot a Foitoffl.ee
End* Disastrously.
WOODLAND, Wash., Feb. 24.â An un
successful attempt was made this morning
to rob the postoffice at this place. The
postofiice is in a general store kept by John
Carpenter. Just after midnight a son of
the proprietor, who slept upstairs in the
building, was returning from an enter
tainment held in a neighboring school
house, when he heard some one moving
about in the store. Without alarming the
robbers, he awakened Captain Chamber
lain, formerly captain of the police force in
South Tacoma. and A. B. Scott, who lived
near by, and they accompanied him to the
front ctoor of the store, which Mr. Carpen
ter unlocked.
Chamberlain drew his revolver and ad
vancing toward two men engaged in ran
sacking the store, commanded them to
hold up their hands. They complied and
submitted to arrest. Scott's wagon was
secured and the robbers were driven to
Olympia and placed in jail. They refused
io reveal their names.
Waterhouse Acquitted at Jtockford.
ROCKFORD, "Wash., Feb. 24.â At the
preliminary trial to-day David Water
house, who was charged with killing Henry
Phillips, because Phillips.had, he declared,
insulted his daughter, was acquitted. The
verdict brought forth loud cheers from the
iarge crowd which had assembled, and
Waterhouse was congratulated on all sides.
It would appear from the testimony that
Phillips went out looking for trouble, and
as he is now under six feet of earth it is
clear he got it. Â»
Grass Valley Accident.
GRASS VALLEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â John
Grant was shockingly injured by a prema
ture explosion while blasting logs on his
ranch this afternoon. His chin was blown
off, he lost one eye and his chest and arms
were badly cut. His ranch is situated four
miles from Grass Valley.
THE CHAMPION PUGILIST
Jackson Is Entitled to That Honor
Under Queensberry
Rules.
CORBETT AND THE ENGLISH.
Tom Sharkey and the Trained Sea
Lion Who Will Wrestle and
Catch Fish.
The National Athletic Club has an
nounced that its next entertainment will
be held at the Auditorium on the evening
of March 12.
The principal event on the programme
is an eight-round boxing contest between
Alexander Greggains, the boxing in
structor of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, and Tom Sharkey, the heavy-weight
pugilist, who has defeated Billy Smith
and "big" Miller in contests that were
spirited and of comparatively short dura
tion.
Greggains will train in the vicinity of
the Six-mile House and Sharkey has
selected training quarters at the Seal Rock,
where he can watch the warships passing
in and out of the Golden Gate during his
leisure hours.
It is said that Sharkey will emulate the
famous New Zealand fighter by having as
one of his attendants a sea lion, which is
now being trained to wrestle Gneco-Ko
ruan and catch-as-catch-can by "Deacon"
Jones. Billy Jordan is of the opinion that
the sea lion will prove a mucli more agree
able companion than Fitzsimmons' land
lion, which is liable to resent an insult at
any moment, and that would mean the
defeat of the great pugilist in less time
than it takes to count ten seconds.
Sharkey contends that if the sea lion
should "get on his ear" over some imae
inary grievance he, Sharkey. could very
easily make the salmon catcher of the
Pacific Ocean come to time by giving it an
upper cut under the chin or a La Blanche
swing "on the point" of his jaw. The
pugilist has an idea that when the lion
will thoroughly understand the art of
wrestling he can be trained to retrieve fish
from the ocean, and if this latter scheme
proves successful Sharkey will embark in
the fish business ana supply his numerous
friends with fresh salmon and sturgeon
during the lenten seasons.
The contest between him and Greggaina
should prove most interesting because of
the different styles of boxing they will
show on this occasion. Greggains is very
quick and shifty and will certainly puzzle
Sharkey in many ways. It is claimed that
tne fireman cannot hit hard and that lie
relies altogether on his ability to land fre
quently, and, by a systematic course of
jabbine, wear his opponent out.
Greggains adopted this manner of fight
ine when he first engaged in contests to a
finish, but now that he has grown heavy
and strong it can be safely said that he
will stand his ground and return compli
ment for compliment. The boxers are
almost on an equality so far as weight is
concerned, and Greggains will certainly
have an advantage over Sharkey in height
and reach. As the bout will be decided on
the points scored during the mill the spec
tators will certainly witness a sharp and
exciting contest from start to finish.
The proposed match between Eldridge
and Hawkins has fallen through. It has
been learned, and on good authority, that
Eldridge knows little or nothing about the
game of fisticuffs and that Hawkins would
nave a decidedly soft snap should he be
matched to box the alleged fighter whom
Pat Archibald boxed in Los Angeles. The
National Club would confer a great favor
on "the fraternity who love to witness a
clever bexing contest if it would refrain
from giving preliminary exhibitions of
fisticuffs between raw recruits.
According to late dispatches the London
Sporting Club, the members of which Cor
bett insulted when he was rusticating in
England, has positively refused to offer
him any inducements to fight under its
auspices.
It was thought that the next great battle
between the giants of the ringâ Corbett
and Fitzsimmonsâ would be held in Lon
don's great boxing club, but the English
men still retain a grievance against the
ex-champion, and, in all probability, it
will be many moons before "BoD" "and
"Jim" will settle their little dispute re
garding the alleged championship ques
tion, as Corbett is averse to meeting Fitz
simmons anywhere outside of a club where
he can be sure of having proper protection.
As the London prize-ring style of fighting
is now obsolete and seldom thought of
the championships of the present day are
fought and won under^Queensberry rules.
When boxing was nourishing in this
country it will be remembered that Peter
Jackson challenged John L. Sullivan, and
that the latter refused to meet him because
of Peter's color.
According to Queensberry rules, which
make no reference to black or white, Sulli
van lost the championship when he re
fused to meet Jackson after the latter had
posted a forfeit and challenged the then
American champion in accordance with
the rules which govern the present and
only fair style of boxing. Corbett and
Jackson met some time after Sullivan's
refusal to tight the heavy-weight cham
pion of Australia, and the contest, which
was decided before the old California
Club, ended in a draw. Jackson now
held the championship of Australia, and
of America also, according to the rules of
Queensberry.
The colored pugilist left this country
for London soon afterward and won the
championship of England by defeating
Slavin. It will therefore be seen that if
championships are to be decided and de
termined in accordance with Queensberry
rules Peter Jackson is to-day the cham
pion of the world.
Corbett subsequently whipped Sullivan,
and then claimed ttie championship of the
world, which is a very empty claim, all
things considered. Jackson, however, to
prove to the sporting people of the world
that he was prepared to decide that mooted
question between him and Corbett, chal
lenged the latter to a return match, and-
Corbett cot out. of a second contract by stat
ing that he would not fight him before the
Gentlemen's Club of London, which ne
dubbed a very one-sided body, and that no
American could get fair play under its
ruling. It was for 1 1) is and other uncompli
mentary remarks that the London chib
has refused to recognize Corbett in any
form or manner. Jackson is in reality the
champion of the world to-day under
Queensbery's ruling.
KICKED BY AN OSTRICH.
Francis Komera's Adventure With One
of the Park's Big Birds.
Francis Romera, a young man who lives
on Green street, had an encounter with
the big cock ostrich at Golden Gate Park
yesterday that will probably teach him
caution when dealing with birds larger
than chickens or turkeys.
Komera had gone to the park with his
sweetheart and her father, and the young
lady demanded that the ostrich paddock
should be visited that she might get a
closer view of the great birds.
Among them is a giant of the species
whose temper is not of the best, and Ro
mera singled him out to show his fair one
that after all the birds were not so danger
ous as the story books represent them to
be. He began caressing the big producer
of hat plumes, patting him on the back,
and finally putting his arm about the
creature's neck.
At first the ostrich did not seem to raind
the familiarity, but finally became impa
tient, when Komera prevented his walk
ing away, and began stamping his big feet
a sure sign of anger among the ostrich
family as well as among human beings.
Then some one shouted at Romera to look
out or he might get hurt. Almo3t before
the words were spoken the ostrich made a
vicious kick at his tormentor. Romera
seemed to take this demonstration as a
good joke, and playfully slapped the bird
on the side of its head.
In an instant he was sprawling in a
bush, the second kick having landed on
his right thigh with sufficient force to
have broken it had the blow landed fairly.
As it was, his trousers and underclothing
on the right side were torn from his body
and the flesh lacerated until it looked like
raw beefsteak. As Romera scrambled to
his feet the ostrich made preparations for
a second attack, but the screams of his
fiancee had drawn the attention of Officer
Clarke of the mounted park police, who
rode up at a gallop and forced the ostrich
to run before the horse, though lie went in
a manner that betokened that he would
prefer to take another kick at Romera.
MUXOJER AT SJPOKAXÂ£.
JDotnerieo Perri Aasa.itinated and His
Money Carried Atvay.
SPOKANE, Wash., Feb. 24.â The body
of Domerico Perri, an old Italian who has
been missing from his home for several
days, was found to-day by the
police in Hangman Creek. Tbe posi
tion in which it was found indicated
Perri had been murdered in the city and
carried to a point some distance above
where he was found, and his body had
floated down the stream until it lodged in
some bushes, where it was discovered.
Perri had $280 in his pockets on Satur
day night, when he was in a dancehall
and was intoxicated. There lie displayed
the money and the fact was reported to
the police later that night. A search was
then made for him, and, as he did not
come home, foul play was expected.
There is no question but that he was
murdered, ana the killing was certainly a
very brutal one. His head was crushed by
repeated blows. x
The body was taken to an undertaking
establishment, ana $10 was found hidden
away in an inner pocket, but everything
else of value except his watcn was missing.

MILL VALLEY FIREBUG.
A Third Conflagration Believed to Have
Been of Incendiary Origin Causes
Great Excitement.
MILL YALLFA', Cai,., Feb. 24.â A dwell
ing and an outbuilding owned by Antone
Ferari were burned to the ground yester
day morning, under suspicious circum
stances. The outbuilding is situated twen
ty-five feet distant from the dwelling, and
though both structures were completely
burned, the brush between them was not
in any way damaged.
Tuis is the third fire in Mill Valley that
has occurred at an usually early hour, and
it is the general impression that an incen
diary is at work. A woman living in the
vicinity of the blaze said that she was
awakened by the giare in her room, and
looking out of her window noticed
that both structures were ablaze at the
same time, while she coula notice no
dames or tire between the two builaings.
The home of Harry Mver's near East
land Station, in Mill Valley, and Miller
Bros.' stable, not 100 yards from Myer's
house, were both burned under suspicious
circumstances and at about the same
time â early in the morning.
The people here are on the lookout now
and a thorough investigation will be made
to ascertain who is engaged in the nefar
ious work of setting lire to houses.
Ba'kersfield Affray.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Feb. 24.âToma
so Valenzuela and Francisco Quintero
quarreled over a woman last night. Va
lenzuela drew a pistol, but Quintero was
quicker than he and rired three times
with a 38-caliber gun. One ballet went
through Valenzuela'a left lung and an
other through the back of his neck and
left shoulder, while the third pierced hig
hand. While the shooting was going on
the woman tried to stab Quintero, but was
not successful.
Valenzuela has a slight chance for re
covery, but the wound is very dangerous.
Quintero is only 19 years old and a native
of Ecuador. He is now in jail.

I" "PATENTS^ VI
MARKEt'sx's'fSSS^SAM RAINEY HAS
TAKEN THE TRICK.
Last Night's Primary Shows
Him Close to the Junta's
Control.
HEATED DISTRICT ROWS.
Election Officers From Headquar
ters Thrown Out in the
Forty-Fourth.
THEY SAT ON THE BALLOT-BOX.
The Anti-Boss Faction of the Anti-Boss
Organization Wonder Where
They Are At.
The Junta held its primary for the elec
tion of a new general committee last even
ing, and Sam Rainey seems to have cap
tured the anti-Buckley organization.
If this is not the truth it is so close a
shave from the truth that it amount? to
the same thing. If the apparent truth is
the fact the local Democracy sits in a dual
role on the neck of Democratic anti-boss
i*m. Buckley absolutely controls one
"recu'ar" local Democratic organization
er.J Sam Rainey smilingly controls the
otner "regular" local Democratic organi
zation.
Of course it is not all Sam Rainey. It is
an anti-Buckley trinity that is credited
with having secured control of the Demo
cratic revolutionary organization which
Gavin HcNab started to net the party
away from Buckley and ostensibly to the
side of purity. Daggett and Ed Lanigan
are with Rainey in opposition to tbe re
formers, that took them in on the start
"for a purpose" a:: 1 then proposed to
"dump' them and take charge of the
party themselves.
At the primary iast night and during all
the long preparations tor that primary
there has been a constant conflict between
the Rainey-Daggett-Lanigan faction of the
Junta and the anti-boss element repre
sented mo>: vigorously by Max Popper
"-amuel Braunhart and their friends
and by Chairman Sullivan, who is a close
friend' of Gavin McNab's, and by Gavin
M :Nab. who is a close friend of John Dag-
Ed Lanigan and the Fire Depart
ment, and yet in the interest of good gov
ernment their deadly political enemies.
A somewhat vague, mysterious and al
ways suppressed tight between the powers
i:i active control of the Junta organization
te three elements which have triven
the Junta organization its chief political
strength, represented by Rainey, Daggett
at:d Lanigan, has been going on for some
time. The rieht reached the stage of open
conflict last night, and bids fair to become
a pitched and general battle before the
week is over.
The Rainey element has so controlled
district politics that it has been able to
dictate nominations in various districts,
â¢which would give it a greatly increased
strength in the general committee. Recog- â 
nizicg 'â â¢-â¢ danger of Rainey's control,
in conjunction with Dasgett and Lanigan,
arbitrary measures were taken at head
quarters to repress Rainey by refusing to
allow to him or to the Daggett and Lani
gan people any greater proportionate rep
resentation than they possessed in the ex
isting committee 0f*450. This measure
was successfully forced in a number of dis
tricts in pursuit of the policy that the rep
resentatives of interests all around should
remain as it was, regardless of the primary
voting of any faction in any district.
Max Popper and others demanded that
the process go further and effectually cut
down, if not eliminate altogether, the
Rainey element in the organization. But
the prevailing powers at headquarters con
ceded equal strength, while refusing
to recognize any new strength that such
effective political workers as Daggett,
Rainey and Lanigan and their experienced
lieutenants might have gained by their !
clever political work meantime. In this
"meantime" all these three local powers,
and Rainey especially, have been quietly
reaching out for power.
That was the situation in the midst of
which the Â«Junta primary was held be
tween the hours of 7:30 and 9:30 o'clock
last evening in the various districts, there
being one polling-place in each of the j
eighteen Assembly districts.
No wonder there was some trouble. The
chief battle was in the Forty-fourth Dis- j
trict, where George H. Maxwell, secretary
of the Fire Commission and Rainey 'a lieu
tenant, controlled the situation absolutely.
His followers constituted the roll and had
the district, the opposition â led by Otto
Koeper, Senator Fay and othersâ beine
in a small minority. Maxwell took a
bold stand on tbe Democratic principle
that the majority should rule, and
ignoring the ticket made up at head
quarters giving him twelve out of the
twenty-five delegates, ran the ticket of
twenty-five nominated by the club.
Chairman Sullivan, who had taken
things into hi 3 own hands, sent
rive men to take charge of the election
and a bundle of "official" tickets. There
â were ten police officers there, but Chairman
Sullivan's election officers were thrown
out and the Maxwell people took charge
of the election. There were 190 ballots
cast and not a single one of them were the
pink "official" tickets prepared at head
quarters.
This Forty-fourth row is the sum and
measure of the whole situation. Max
well's twenty-five will demand seats
in the general committee when it meets
for organization on Thursday evening.
Not a vote was cast for anybody else. The
Rainey-Dagpett-Lanipan strength will
vote for seating the twenty-rive. That
vote will measure the Rainey power in the
Junta's new general committee at the
outset.
Out in the Thirty-fourth there were
more interesting doings. The district
club sent in twenty-five nominees and
$_'.") and supposed that everything was all
right. Rainey had a majority of the dis
trict. They left off George Gallagher of
the Deuprey committee. At headquarters
Gallagher was allowed to name eight men
to be substituted in the ticket for Rainey
men. he ticket as amended by Gallagher
at headquarters was printed and sprung at
the polls when they opened. Of course,
there was a row.
In two or three other districts nominees
who were stronerly opposed to Rainey were
scratched and Rainey men elected in their
stead.
The proceedings in the Forty-fourth i
district were enlivened by the ousting of i
the committee appointed by Chairman
Sullivan to conduct the election. The j
Forty-fourtli Assembly District club, rep- \
resenting that there were some dissentions j
in their midst, bad petitioned the general !
committee for the appointment of a com
mittee of rive from outside the district to j
conduct the election. Chairman Sullivan j
accordingly appointed as such committee
Frank Hugnes, George Love, William \
Harrison, George Gallagher and Frank j
Conklin.
The first four named of tliia committee
repaired to the polllne-plae* nt 004 Lora-
I'ar 1 street and there .->Â».- 1 Up ;he polis. They
took with them a, tiiket already printed â
n larjre red ticket â bearing the following
DMDM :
President, Otto Koepcr; Tic: president,
James J. Dogan; secretary, H. Barbee; treas
urer, Walter Pilkiugton.
Canvassing committeeâ V. de Andreas, Dr.
H. Bushel, A. Coleman, T. Maxwell, R. Acres.
Delegatesâ J. Riley, Ed Feeney, G. laccneri,
1 horaas Fcrley, A. Richet, John Fay, James J.
Kitterman, William Raubinger, Joseph Mogan,

kius, J. J. Harrigan, George Stout, William
As the hour of half-past 7 approached
anil the polls were about to be opened, .1.
J. Degan, president of the district club,
called a meeting of the club, the members
being present in the room in large num
bers. He then asked the committee if
they would, upon the closing of the polls,
certify the result to the club.
Frank Huga for the committee said
they would not do so; that they would
take the box back to the headquarters of
the committee, as he understood such
were his instructions.
Degan then said tnere was another
ticket than the red ticket to be voted, and
proposed that the club appoint two men
and the committee appoint two, repre
senting both tickets, they to count the bal
lots.
"That red ballot was prepared by the
general committee," said George Maxwell,
speaking of the matter last night. "It
does not represent ttiis district. We had
no objection to it being voted, but the
Democratic club oi this district haa regu
lariy nominated another ticket and in
tended to see that it sliould have
fair play. They sent its nominations
to the general committee with $25 to pay
the expense of having the tiCKets printed.
We have the receipt of the secretary for
that money, but, as I say, they took upon
themselves to make up an entirely dif
ferent ticket, leaving off many of the
names of our nominees. Furthermore,
they brought up a polling list containing
over 640 names, while there were only 44:2
regularly registered and entitled to vote.
That is the reason of our action to-night."
The life seemed to have been crushed
out of good old-time Democratic primary
politics in the Twenty-ninth District. The
election there la^t night was but a shadow
in comparison with former primaries.
Tnere was to have beenaconrlct between
Nat Seelig, who represents the Fire De
partment and the Mint, and Sam liraun
hart. treelig had nominated six extra
names for the ticket, with the belief that
thirty-one names would be printed. The
J unta, however, announced some days ago
that only twenty-rive names would be
printed, and that left Seelig out in the
cold. *
The little crowd gathered in a hall on
the ground tloor last evening, and when
the time for opening the oallot had arrived
a clever trick was played on the opposi
tion, that is, Seelig's men. The secretary
remarked that it was time to open the
window to let the crowd outside vote. No
sooner were the words uttered than Seelig
and his friends made for the street. They
found two boys peering through the window
and later that the door wÂ»s closed against
them, t?o a tight for the ballot-box or
ballots was out of the question. Four
stalwart policemen helped to strengthen
this conclusion. The voting passed off
quietly, though only eighty-one votes out
of the !*i*J registered in the district were
cast, and half of thos? were claimed as
stuffers.
They were a singularly good-natured
lot of Democrats who took an interest in
the primary flections in the Thirty-fourth
District at" Harmony Hall on Mission
street, near Thirteenth. They had a de
cided disagreement over the whole busi
i ness, which proved to be on the comic
i order.
To begin with, the ticket nominated in
â  regular manner by the district committee
February 7 and duly presented at the
Junta's headquarters was not printed by
i the Junta managers. J. H. McCallum,
secretary of tiie district committee, called
at headquarters in the afternoon for the
ballot-box, tickets.and rolls. He was told
that the tickets would not be ready until
6r. M. He called again at 5, when it was
stated that George E. Gallagher had re
ceived the tickets, etc., and would have
them ready at 7:30 p. m.
l.aiiaghe'r was on hand when the polls
were to be opened, and so was a majority
of the district committee. McCallum saw
at a glance that a trick had been played at
headquarters, for the ticket had been
changed so he hardly recognized it. He
called a meeting of the committee in the
absence of the chairman, R. J. Luttinger,
who declined to serve, and it was decided
to sit upon the ballot-box until J. J. Borden
and John Heenan, a committee, went to
headquarters with a protest. The district
committee would accept only the "official
ticket. '
J. B. Williams demanded the right of
voting, which was denied. He then de
manded the ballot-box, and the crowd ail
laughed heartily. Whereupon Williams
improvised a baliot-box from a starch box
and bossed the district election. Four
votes were cast and the box was sealed
with great solemnity. The seal was sitrned
by J. B. Williams, J. K. Bell, C. Wit Deck
and J. F. Kirby.
The tight was for Georpe Gallagher of
the Deuprey committee, and he pot seven
or eight names on the ticket. The names
rejected were: J. H. McCallum, chair
man; J. F. McElroy, secretary; John
Heenan, corresponding secretary ; James
Mee. J. J. Borden, Mat. O'Brien, John
McGuigan, canvassing committee; J. Mc-
Neil, Joseph Cruze, J. E. O'Brien and R.
L. Mann, general committee.
Four votes were cast for the "regular"
pink anti- Rainey ticket, cleverly prepared
at headquarters, and sprung "when the
time for balloting begun.

OARING ATTEMPT TO ROB
Two Ladies Held Up on the Cor
ner of McAllister and Jones
Streets.
A Shabbily-Dressed Young Man Tried
to Grab a Purse and Struck One
in the Face.
One of the most daring attempts at high
way robbery ever attempted in this City
occurred last night on McAllister and
Jones streets in front of the Hibernia
Bank.
Mr>. Rix, 4Or>}4 Tenth street, and Mrs.
Kelly. 2f> Ellis street, were standing on the
corner waiting for a car about 7 o'clock.
The streets in the vicinity were crowded
with people at the time, and the ladies
were chatting pleasantly, never dreaming
that they were being closely watched by a
shabbily-dressed young man. Just as a
McAllister streetcar approached the cross
ing the young man walked hurriedly up
to the two ladies, and addressing Mr.-.
Rix, the elder of the two, who had her
purse in her hand, said, "Throw up your
nands quick."
Mrs. Rix was completely taken by sur
prise, but as soon as she was able to" speak
she blurted out. "1 haven't got any
money." The young fellow made a grab
for her purse, and she drew her hand
quickly behind her back. He struck her a
violent Dlow in the face with his clenched
list, and she staggered into the roadway.
Mrs. Kelly screamed, and several men who
were on the opposite side of the street
rushed over to see what was the matter.
The young fellow had followed Mrs.
Rix, but when he saw the men coming
toward him he turned and ran north on
Jones street. He had made good his
escape before the ladies were able to tell
what he had done.
The two ladies went to police headquar
ters and reported the attempted robbery.
Mrs. Rix's face bore evidence of the bow
she had received, and she was smarting
with pain and anger. They were unable
to give any better description of the youn<*
man than that he was shabbily dressed"
very pale faced and looked like a "dope
fiend." They thought they could recog
nize him again.
"When he asked me to throw up my
hands." said Mrs. Rix. '1 thought for the
moment he was fooling me, but he looked
so wild and ro desperate that I quickly
changed my mind. I did not expect the
young scoundrel would have struck me in
the face, ana the blow stunned me for the
moment."
Tbe detectives were instructed to keep a
sharp lookout for the young fellow.
A blue bottle-nosed whaie, measuring
twenty feet in length, was discovered off
Hartiepool, England, recently. The crew
of the trawler tihanklin drove'the whale in
between the piers, and there secured it,
eventually bringing it to the lish ouay.
The silk product for all countries in 1887,
the last year for which complete statistics
are available, was 52,000,000 pounds, ana
its value was estimated at $490,000,000.

sport was uneventful. Six races were run
off, of which favorites captured three.
About the best performance of the day
was that of Wheel of Fortune in the mile
and a sixteenth handicap. Harvey's mare
was a 6 to 5 favorite in the betting, and
picking up 114 pounds, waited on Peter the
Second and St. Lee to the stretch, when
Chora let out a link and gradually assum
ing the lead won easily by two lengths in
the fast time of 1:47%. St. Lee, who ran
an excellent race, carrying ninety-tive
pounds, was second, three lengths before
Logan.
Rebellion was again made a hot favor
ite, going to the post a 7 to 5 choice for the
opening live and a half furlonc dash with
eleven facing the flag. He was injudi
ciously handled through the stretch by
Garner and finished second, a couple of
lengths behind Model, the second choice.
Governor Budd ran a fine race, finishing
a bang-up third.
Colonel again demonstrated his
superiority over the other two-year-olds,
winning at the track by downing a tield of
fourteen in the three* and a half furlong
dash. Starting a 3 to 5 choice, he was in
front before the stretch was reached and
won hands down from the 30 to 1 outsider,
Alma Dale. The Macdonough entry, St.
Dunstan, finished in the show.
The five-furlong scramble for maidens
was a red-hot betting affair. The Sacra
mento delegation were down hard on
Snowdown, sending him to the post a 11
to 5 favorite. San Marco was heavily
backed on stable information at 13 to 5,
with Mr. Keel in good demand at threes.
Imp. Agrippina took the lead when the
flag fell, setting a hot pace, witn the fav
orite second under a wrap. The' outsider
struck the stretch with a pood lead, fol
lowed by Snowdown, Mr. Reel and San
Marco. The first choice stopped on the
wire, and Martin on San Marco slipping
through next the rail looked a likely win
ner. He tired the last fifty yards and was
beaten out by both Mr. Re"ef and the out
sider, Agrippina, the three finishing heads
apart at the wire. The winner, Mr. Reel,
was well ridden by Garner.
The fifth event, a mile run over the in
side course, was another well-contested
race. Thirteei started, with Hy Dy al3
to 5 favorite. E. H. Shirley was second
choice at threes, with May Day a strongly
tipped third choice at 4>h. The course is
narrow and some great hustling was in
dulged in among the boys for the lead.
Catch 'Em led to the backstretch, where
Ahahabad showed in front. The latter
Headed the field to the stretch for home, with
Ike L, Hy Dy and E. H. Shirley following
in close order. E. H. Shirley looked a
winner up to the last few yards, when
Cochrin brought May Day up with a rush
and in a hard drive won "by a head. Red
Root came fast on the outside, taking
third place.
John Robbins' mare MoJlie R closed a 2
to 1 favorite in the betting on the last
event, a five and a half furlong run, with

himself in March Lippincott's thus: If
the didactic novel offends against the laws
of art, the pseudo-realistic novel offends
against the laws of decency. One
is amazed sometimes at the fre

shudders at the outspokenness of Shake
speare and shrinks from the plain
dealing of Fielding, stories only to be
described as ineffably nasty are admitted
to the chastest drawing-room tables. Some
times these stories are written by young
girls, who prattle with naive audacity ol
things they ought not to know; some
times they are written by arown wo
men, who believe in emancipating their
sex by depriving it of modesty;
sometimes they are written by men,
who have the hysterical tendencies
of women or who are base enougn to
traffic in corruption. By whomever
written, they sell; and while they sell
they are bound to multiply. I wish we
had a Literary Inquisitionâ some means
of getting together all tne novels of this
kind known to exist, and burning them

MISS FRANCES WE AN.
Miss Frances Weyman is one of the pretty young ladies now Visiting friends in
Hanford. As is well known in Hanford, Miss Weyman left her home in Omaha
I^ebraska, in search of good health. Before her arrival she was but the ghost of her
real self. Now she is strong, brimful of energy and perfectly beautiful. Although
she used several bottles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. her face showed no signs of a
pimple, a blood spot or a Sarsaparilla trade mark. Tne reason is obvious. Joy's
\egetable t Sarsaparilla, unlike the iodide of potassium sarsaparilla. contains only
herbs-California herbs and herbs that will dry up the facial blemishes and purify the
blood without throwing out spots on the face. Listen to Miss Weyman: "You 'may
tell the manager of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla that I am delighted with California
in general and with Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla in particular. 'I almost wish I was a
native. Don t you see what a great thing it is- to have people speak of your own State
as being great in health-restoring qualities? Yes, when I return to Omaha I will bo
sure to carry several bottles of Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla, and I shall always praise
the remedy, as it has done me great good." The experience of Miss Frances Weyman
will be your experience if you try Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. Don't allow a druggist
to talk you out of the "native Sarsaparilla"â Joy Vegetable Sarsaparilia. ' -~
PROMPT ACTION WANTED
The Board of Health Asks That
a Pesthouse Site Be Set
tled On.
NEED SAID TO BE PRESSING.
Supervisors Requested to Place Pau
pers and Incurables in One
Locality.
The continued delay on the part of the
Board of Supervisors in selecting a site for
the hospital for contagious diseases has
aroused the Board of Health to address
the City Fathers on the subject and urge
that the matter be settled at an early date.
A communication was addressed to the
Supervisors yesterday in the following
language:
BAH Frawcisco, February 24, 1Â«O<;.
To the Honorable the Hoard of Supervisor* of
the city and Cbunty of San Francisco -Gkhtls
men: For some years past, all too many, the
provision made for the cure and cure of per
sons suffering from infectious and com .
diseases in thi3 Cityâ the present so-called
but incorrectly termed Pesthonseâ hu been
and now is a disgrace to this community and
to the present civilization.
We have hitherto called the attention of
your honoraDle body to the necessity, the im
portance and the urgency of some "provision
for those unfortunately "afflicted with epi
demic disease, which should be, if not entirely
abreast of the most advanced scientific and
humane requirements, at least not such as to
offend every sense of justice and humanity to
both those suffering from epidemic diseases
and those whom they threaten. The use of
the incorrect term, pesthouse, as applied to a
hospital for infectious and contagion
cases, has given a general but erroneous im
pression throughout this community that inch
a hospital is a menace to the neighborhood,
and even somewhat distant surroundings.
This notion, however, is largely if not en
tirely erroneous, as there is but little likelihood
of danger from the presence of any hospital if
properly conducted, many of the largest and
best hospitals in the largest cities of the world
being in the very heart of such cities, and all
of tnom containing a department solely for
such diseases as may become epidemic.
Under these circumstances we hope your
honorable body will no longer give to the "pro
tests against the location of such a hospital
that consideration which has hitherto entirely
prevented the erection of the hospital any
where. Your nonorable body has charge of
the interests of all tiie people in the whole of
this City in this behalf, and the protests ol a
few people in some isolated section should not
outweigh the obligation due to those afflicted,
as a matter of common humanity, and to the
bulk of the population who will be threatened
by every epidemic unless proper provision ia
made before its arrival.
We desire, therefore, to impress upon your
honorable body again the paramount and
vital duty of making prompt and adequate
provision for the care and cure of persons who
now or may suffer from some epidemic disease.
The location of such hospital is secondary, ii 3
immediate erection somewnere is a duty de
volving on you which we desire to impress
with all the earnestness the subject itself de
mands. We wish to suggest, however, that
there is no place in this <ity where children in
any number suffering from such dives
diphtheria and scarlet tever will be taken and
cared for, and we call your attention to the
further fact that some four hundred of the in
mates of the Almshouse are really patients
suffering from incurable diseases In order that
your honorable body may have in mind in the
fixing for a location for a hospital for con
tagious and infectious diseases the possibility,
and, as we feel, the expediency and desira
bility ot having both the poor and decrepit
and the diseased who are under thechareeof
the City authorities in one locality, where
they can receive better care at much lest
than in their present scattered and inadequate
quarters.
We have written your honorable body in this
tone and in these terms because we feel the
I tremendous responsibility of the situation.
The long and tortunate "freedom of this i'ity
from any epidemic diseases manes the chance
of some such affliction the greater and more
probable, and we need not emphasize to you
the sheer impossibility of making adequate
provision atter the scourge of some nlague 13
upon us.
It is for us to call the attention of your hon
orable body to the situation. We are" powerless
to do more than impress its gravity on you,
but having done this we hope your 'honorable
body will take such immediate action in this
behalf as the interests of this City and the In
terests of humanity alike dictate and demand.
We are, dear sirs, yours very respectfully,
Henry H. Hart, M.D.".

AN UNPAIR DEDUCTION.
In the course of his speech before the
House Committee on Pacific Roads Con
gressman Bowers of California said: "I
am satisfied that there are negotiations al
ready on foot by a syndicate which desires
a foreclosure and an immediate sale of
these roads at auction at a price not above
$40,000,000. I thinK the indications are
patent that something of the kind is to be
done, and that they will try to get posses
sion of these great properties for about
$40,000,000â a speculation that would
doubly discount in the matter of profits
the Belmout-Morgan syndicate."
The Cknmicle, in its advocacy of the
funding bill and its opposition to fore
closure, prefaces its quotation of Mr. Bow
ers' remarks with these words: "The
Chronicle has called attention more than
once to the fact that back of the opposi
tion to the refunding of the debts of the
Central and Union Pacific railroads there
is a scheme to turn them over to private
individuals for a mere song. Some at
tempts have been made to deny this, but
we have a statement of Representative
Bowers which fully confirms the allega
tion."
In other words, the Chronicle seems to
assume that Mr. Bowers, manifestly an
tagonistic to the supposed scheme which
he mentioned, is a party to its secrets and
purposes; that by exposing it he is assist
ing it; that the Government is in a con
spiracy to rob the National treasury, and
that the anti-funding sentiment of Califor
nia 19 conniving in the contemplated
crime. That is the logic of our contem
porary's position. Whether Congressman
Bowers and the forty-n'.ne out of fifty of
his constituents who oppose funding like
being placed in such a li^it is another
matter.
Had our contemporary quoted Mr.
Bowers fairly it would have set forth the
clear reasons which he gave in showing
that the aided roads are already paying 6
per cent on their indebtedness and there
fore would be a good investment, the value
of which would be greatly increased by
destruction of the Southern Pacific Com
pany's policy of diverting the traffic. He
did this to show that the Government is in
a position to recover the entire debt by
foreclosure. As he quoted the Secretary
of the Interior in presenting proof that
the roads are earning 6 per cent on their
indebtedness he announced thereby that
the administration had already committed
itself and could not be a party to any con
spiracy for selling the roads for $40,000,000.
His intention evidently was to warn Con
gress not to pass any measure to foster any
swindling scheme, including refunding,
the most gigantic swindle of all. It would
not have been difficult for our contempo
rary to draw a fair deduction from Mr.
Bowers' speech.
WHERE PEOGEESS STAETS.
The editor of the Tulare Register was a
member of the party of editors who made
an extended Eastern trip recently, and he
has since published some highly valuable
observations concerning the foundation of
community prosperity in Eastern towns.
The two important things which he dis
covered and which would be so useful in
California are that every town has a fac
tory of some kind, and that in all prosper
ous agricultural districts diversified farm
ing is practiced.
On the lirst point he says: "There was
always something in* addition to being a
mere local trading center. Perhaps it was
a suspender factory, a ciear factory, a fac
tory for building school furniture, for
making shoes, wagons, buggies, hats, a
tannery or blast-furnace â but there was
always a 'shop' of some sort where peo
ple worked. Scattered all over the States
east of the Mississippi River there are
towns of 2000 to 5000 people, thrifty and
prosperous, whose names the average
reader never heard, and they are thrifty
and prosperous because there is some
thing in them for people to do." These
are facts for every town in California to
ponder, and they have a special value in
view of the development of electrical
power from water.
The prosperous farmers produce every
thing possible that is consumed on the
farm, and have a system of diversified
farming that renders impossible the disas
ter oi a general failure of crops. As a re
suit there is a conspicuous scarcity of farm
mortgages. Here is a fine piece of wis
dom: "The tendency is not so much in
the direction of small farms where staple
products are grown. Where the margin
of profit is small and the labor cost is not
great, production has to be correspond
ingly large and farms run from 160 to 320
acre?. Where the margin of profit is pre
sumably creator and *he element of labor
enters largely into the cost, as in fruit
growing or market-gardeninc, the farms
are small, but correspondingly more valu
able."
JAMESON IN ENGLAND.
Now that Jameson and his men have
reached England to be put upon their trial
we may expect some light to be thrown
upon the disputed point whether the inva
sion of the Transvaal was planned by Cecil
Rhodes and the Sjuth African Company,
or whether it was merely a sympathetic
raid, brought about by the agitations of
the foreign miners in the Transvaal itself.
The South African Company would nec
essarily have derived so great a profit from
the success of the raid, it was but natural
to suspect the managers of the company of
complicity in it. The old maxim that
the surest way to discover the author of a
crime is to seek the person most benefited
by it seems applicable in this case. The
suspicion derives further confirmation
from the fact that Jameson has long been
a close friend of Cecil Rhodes, and he, as
well as many, if not most, of his men were
at one time in the service of the South Af
rican Company.
Against suspicion raided by these facts
it is to be noted that no evidence directly
incriminating Rhodes or his company has
been put forward by any authority that
could be reiicd upon. Moreover it is
not in accord with the reputation of
Rhodes that he should have had any voice
in planning an expedition that was so
manifestly ill-designed, ill-timed and ill
conducted. The ereat leader of South
African enterprise in business and politics
has never been accused heretofore of be
ing a fool, and certainly the Jameson ex
pedition was about as big a fool's errand
as any the world has heard of in a long
time.
For the purpose of getting a clear and
full Kuowledge of tiie real origin and
inteat of the expedition, it is fortu
nate that the trial Is to take place
in England rather than in the
Transvaal. Much evidence that might
have been partly suppressed in far off
Pretoria will be heard all over the world
when uttered in London. In those British
courts, where not even the influence of the
Prince of Wales could silence any part of
the famous baccarat scandal, it is not
likely that the South African Company
can keep anything hidden in this case.
The degree of punishment to be inflicted
upon the participants and the leaders in
the raid may be made light, under the
pressure of popular sympathy with
the raiders, but there is no danger
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
of any suppression of evidence upon ma
terial points. We can reasonably count,
therefore, upon learning the whole truth
in the matter and knowing whether Cecil
Rhodes is really the great man he has
been reputed, or only another case of an
adventurer who after playing in luck a
long time has wound up with disaster.
AN INSTRUCTIVE INCIDENT.
Although the reports of Commander
Ballington Booth's refusal to submit to his
father's order removing him from the com
mand of the Salvation Army in this coun
try are somewhat obscure the general facts
seem to be these: Ballington Booth and
his wife had accomplished wonderful re
sults, and there was a strong protest from
all classes against their removal. Balling
ton had written a letter to the London
headquarters setting forth the situation.
Then Colonel Nicoll presented himself in
New York, claiming that he had authority
to demand of Ballington that he either
withdraw his letter and proceed straight
way to London or surrender the keys and
portfolios. It was in this incident that the
serious trouble developed, misunderstand
ings arose and tempers were lost. Balling-
ton Booth promptly surrendered the keys
and cabled his withdrawal from the army.
The incident has sent a profound shock
throughout the Salvation ranks. As for
the assertion that General Booth objected
to the "Americanizing" of this branch of
thearrny.it is enlitled to no considera
tion, for it is not an element in the trou-
ble. He was simply carrying out hia
firmly established policy of transferring
his officers from one place to another
whenever he might deem this best for
the cause. This policy runs all through
the organization. It was adopted from the
Methodist church, and has always been a
practice of the Catholics. What now con
cerns the Salvation Army is to see its hon
ored leader in this country refuse to place
himself under the inexorable law of the
organization and set an example of insub
ordination that may well be regarded as a
threat to the solidarity of this great body.
At the same time the intense affection
which Ballineton Booth's followers cherish
for him may It-ad them to revolt against
the authority of the general and set up an
independent order in America with Bal
lington at its head. Unless we greatly
mistake his character he will refuse to
countenance such a movement. Mani
festly it would be the beginning of a dis
integration that would prove destructive
of that power which universality lends.
In such a revolt, should it occur, a very
large faction in this country would still
acknowledge the London authority, and
that would mean a split even in the United
States. Ihe probabilities are that Balling
ton Booth, unless he recants and returns,
will quietly drop out of sight and that the
present organization will continue.
The great peril that now besets the army
renders clear the fact that it was made
possible by the scheme of central autbority
which rules the army. The Booth family
is the self-constituted ruling power, with
the father at the head. One son In London
is his chief executive officer, and it was
from him (the father being in India) that
the representative claiming to have author
ity from headquarters came with a demand
for Ballington Booth's Keys. That is to say,
a man sought to exercise an imperious
authority over his brother. So long as
that exists the army will be in danger of
disruption. The system is purely mon
archical and therefore unpalatable to
Americans. The scheme contemplates
the perpetuation of the Booth family's
authority by succession. Other erreat re
ligious bodies employ the republican idea
of a representative head selected by the
followers. This is really the grave matter
which the Salvation Army has to consider.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
N. M. Longweli, owner of an orange grovo
145 miles southwest of Jacksonville, and ninety
miles north of Tampa, in Orauge County. Pla.,
is at the Grand.
lie has been jiaying a visit to Francis Long
well, a banker of Lodi, who is his brother.
Mr. Longweli, the orange-grower, has been in
the business fourteen years. He went from
Massachusetts, bought "an old orchard and
afterward added to it Ly planting more trees.
The trees now range in age from twenty-two
down to eight years.
He says these are perilous times in Florida;
tnat everything is blue, and that the country
generally is much like one that has had a big
boom with its corresponding collapse.
It is of course because of the destruction to
L. M. Longwell, the Florida OrangcGrower, at the Grand, on the Blue Times in
His State.
[Sketched from life by a " Call " artist.]
the orange trees by the cold. ifr. Longwell
says he can see no hope of anything brighter
for at least four or five years.
"It will take that long at least from the time
of the freeze to the time ot paying expenses,"
he said. "I might just as well be away from
there as to stay. There is nothing to do.
"Before the frost the product of Florida last
year was between 5,000,000 and 5,500,000
cases. This year we have not produced over
100,000 cases, so you see what an enormous
fall there has been.
"The coming year the product will probably
be very small. It will be many years betore
we get back to where we were.
"The dead trees are spouting good high
shoots. It's rather strange how they have
grown. But the orange-growers might just as
well clear away the old trees. They are dead,
or nearly all of them, and the best thing to do
is to chop them down and cet them away.
This has been done in a great many cases.
"There are not very many people in Florida
this year. The number of visitors Is light.
The people of the State are not rich, as they are
in California. They are, as a rule, poor. The
two great industries there are lumbering and
orange-growing. The lumber made is from
pine timber exclusively. You may say there is
no other timber there. Well, that Is the only
industry left, and it has to stand on such a
basis as only furnished by the small demand
for lumber.
"Jacksonville, the 'argest city of Florida, has
close upon 35,000 people, but Tarapa is be
lieved to be the coming city. It has about 15,
--500 people, and is pretty sprightly."
A. Schwarzmann, the principal owner of the
comic weekly, Puck, who arrived here some
two weeks ago from Southern California, has
been for the pÂ«st few days at Monterey, Santa
Cruz, San Jose and tfotmt Hamilton.
He has returned, however, and is again at
the Occidental. Mr. Schwarzmann says that
H. C. Bunner, the editor of Puck, is yet at
Coronado, but will come to Pan Francisco be
fore he leaves California. Mr. Schwarzmann
was asked if Mr. Uunner was recovering his
health, and Mr. Schvvarzmann replied, doubt
fully:
"Well, he thinks he is, but I don't know.
For one who has been ailing from overwork,
as he is, he ought to stay here longer. He
ought to stay tno or three months yet, at
least, so as to give the climate a thorough
chance, if, inded, it can help him.
"Mr. Bunner is being looked after a good deal
by Charles F. Lummis, the litterateur and edi
tor of the Los Angeles Land of Sunshine. Mr.
Lummis and Mr. Bunner are old friends. The
A. Schwarzmau, the Noted Founder of
the Comic Weekly, "Puck."
[Sketched from UJe by a "Call" artist.]
former used to contribute a good deal to Puck.
Mr. Bunner will probably start for San Fran-
Cisco from Coronado about the 27th inst., too
late to go with us, as we start East to-morrow.
I very much hope he will recover his health,
and I want him to stay in California for this
reason as long as possible.
"I took the tweuty-seven-mile drive and the
eighteen-mile drive while away on my recent
trip, and I saw a great deal to interest me. In
fact California, to me, has presented curious
as well as interesting features.
"For one thing 1 have found everybody.it
appears to me. In favqj of free silver. And
they want all the $1 and ?2 bills called in.
They have an idea if this was done it would
not only give a belter show to silver but would
make limes more prosperous.
"To me such reasoning seems singular. What
good would it do to do this? As a matter of
fact we nave both now, and I do not see how
the change proposed would better the condi
tion in any respect'"
Mr. Koliwarzmann says that over 3000 copies
ol I'uek are sent to California weekly. The
circulation here, according to the size of the
population, in larger than in any other State.
ThÂ« journalist gave a dinner last night to a
few friends, his family being present. He has
been very much pleased with his visit to Cali
fornia.
GLADSTONE TO COME OUT AGAIN.
If Mr. Gladstone decides;to return to Parlia
ment, as is reported by a recent telegram, it
will be the second time that he has emerged
from a retirement sought on account of old
age. When he was 68 years of age he resigned
the leadership ot" the Liberal party to Lord
Hartington, but remained in Parliament. He
could not endure the spectacle of another man
in the place he could fill so much better, and
resumed the leadership. Should he now go
into Parliament at 87 he will be one of the
wonders of the age.â New York Journal.

Foreign Land-Holders Not Wanted.
Los Angeles Times.
There are many things in the condition of
our country upon which we cannot look with
a complacent sense of security. Among these
is the fact that vast areas of American soil,
millions of the most fertile acres in this coun
try, have passed into the hands of aliens and
foreign corporations, who are employing
methods in their cultivation that are in keep
ins with the landlord systems of the Old
World, hiring out these lands to tenants who
pay a good rental to the laafllora, whose only
aim is to realize the largest sum possible from
the land.
A Point for the Cubans.
Oakland Tribune.
The Cubans have gained a point of great im
portance. They have no further fear of arms
and ammunition purchased in the United
Stales and shipped to Cuba for their use inter
fered with by the United States Government so
long as the shipments are not accompanied by
bodies of men, thus bringing it within the
designation of an "armed expedition." The
Government is forced into this position by the
decisions of the courts, which have uniformly
held against the Government in all cases
where it has sought to libel vessels laden with
munitions of war for the ute of forces in re
bellion against the authorities of a iriendly
nation. _____________

AN EVERGREEN EOWER.
There must be some esthetic flagmen in the
employ ot the Southern Pacific Company, judg
ing by the way their tiny house on Fourth
street, near Townsend, has been beautified
When the building was first put up it was like'
much of the rest of the railroad's propertyâ
practically and cruelly ugly. It consisted of
only four nails and a roof of sheet iron, and
was located in a maze ot freightcars, and sur
rounded with ft garden of cinders. Now it is aa
pretty a 6ight as can be found in town.
Several of tne men took a hand in the work
of beautifying, and they had a difficult task
before them. The soil around the house would

grow nothing, so they built a stone wall about
eighteen inches high on the four sides of the
building, and about two feet out. The space
inside was filled with rich soil and several
bulbs of different climbing plants put in.
It was nard work to get them to grow, as they
needed constant watching and watering. Some
of the bulbs put in refused to grow at all, and
had to be replaced by others. But when the
vines did get started they did well, and now
scarcely require any attention.
At present the flagman's house is a most
grateful sight. The vines have grown thickly,
until they spread all over the building and
almost completely shut out the sun. There is
ivy, hemlock and madura, all of the most beau
tiful shades of green that blend together har
moniously. The vines have struck deep roots
and have good hardy-looting stems. As well
as being a bower of beauty, the little bower of
green serves the purpose of tempering the rays
of the sun that in that part of town beat down
uncomfortably warm in the summer.
LADIES' DRESSING SACQUE.
A delightfully comfortable and stylish gar

The back is cut with a back form and an under

A most dainty sacque after this model was of
white batiste. The sailor collar had a deep
hem at the top of which was let in the Harrow

The ruffle around the collar, which was also of
batiste, had the same finisn at the top of the
hem.
Another sacque was of blue and white dim

runle of valenciennes lace.
A yellow dimity might be trimmed with a
collar of yellow and white striped dimity
A pink lawn, with white dots, might have a
white collar trimmed with white or yellow
A blue Japanese Bilk with collar of white

very cool and stylish.
Pale green wash silk with a canary stnpe,
might have the collar of natural colored grass

law in the United Kingdom is that if a man
dies intestate there are several ways of dis
posing of his property, the widow being the
tirst to succeed under certain conditions, but
if there is no widow and he leaves children by
one or more wives, and the Issue of deceased
children, all goes to the eldest son, if there be
one, if not to the daughters equally.

FASTER AND BETTER SERVICE.
Another Steamer Has Been Placed on
the Route Owing to the
Rush.
Business between San Francisco and

extent of Jate that the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company finds it necessary to keep
The Steamer Willamette Valley, Which Is to Be Rechristened Orizaba, Leaving Port With a Cargo
of Goods for Points in Arizona. The Merchandise Will Be Transhipped at Guaymas to the
Santa Fe Railroad.
two steamers on the route. When the
Willamette Valley sailed last month on
her regular roundtrip there was far more
cargo offering than stie could carry, so the
Coos Bay had to be placed in commission
in order to carry the surplus. This month
the same thing has been repeated, and the
Coos Bay is nowbein^ hurried back to take
to Guaymas the merchandise the Willam
ette Valley will be unable to handle on this
occasion.
There is a great deal behind this simple
statement of facts. The rush of freignt by
steamer by the way of Guaymas means an
other attempt on the part of the merchants
of this City to get out of the thralldom of
the Southern Pacific. Great quantities of
goods for points in Arizona are now being
shipped by the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's steamers to Guaymas. At that
point they are taken in charge by officials
of the Santa Fe Railroad and carried to
their destination. Strange to say, the
Arizona merchants get a quicker service
by this roundabout route than they do by
the Southern Pacific.
The ra;e is said to be only a trifle Jower,
but as the steamship line and the Santa
Fe are both satisfied and the people get a
better and quicker service at a smali sav
ing, everybody is delighted and the ship
ments by the new route grow in volume
from day to day.
The shipments which went out on the
Willamette Valley yesterday were com
posed of almost every article in the mar
ket. It comprised flour, sugar, tea, coffee,
canned goods, railroad iron, sheetiron.
iron bars, machinery, wheat, oats, and in
fact, one of the most valuable general car
goes ever taken out on the steamer. It
means just bo many carloads taken away
from the Southern Pacific, and when the
Coos Bay goes out in a week or so it will
mean just so many carloads more. The
Santa Fe is making a most aggressive tight
against the Huntington lines wherever
they reach into its territories, and it lias
certainly displayed remarkable ingenuity
in outgeneraling the managers of the Cali
fornia monopoly.
The Willamette Valley was to have
gone out under a new name, but at the
last minute her owners decided not to
make the change until next trip. Then
her name will be changed to Orizaba, after
the famous old pacret that made so many
thousands of dollars for Goodall, Perkins
& Co. The change is made on account of
the fact that there is a steamer Willamette
and a Willamette Valley, and considerable
confusion ensued in consequence. Whether
it is Orizaba or Willamette Valley, the
steamer will continue to carry Arizona
freight as long as it is offering.
AS hen spoken to about the new opposi
tion, Captain Bennett, the superintendent
of the dock, said it was news to him. "We
carry all the cargo that comes along," said
he, "but if there is any of it going to Ari
zona via Guaymas I don't know of it."
Nevertheless, there was considerable
freight lying on the wharf not a hundred
feet from where he was standing, marked
for Arizona points via Guaymas. The
Southern Pacific has now another opposi
tion line to right.

RECORDED IN BRONZE.
A Gift of 910,000 by James Lick to
aiechaiiics Institute library Offi
cially Acknowledged.
A large relief bust of James Lick was
bolted securely in place on the wall of tne
Mechanics' Institute Library yesterday
evening. " . - .
The design consists of the head of the
great philanthropist surrounded by an
oval framework, with a spray of laurel
leaves at the top ana of oak leaves at the
bottom. Just below the bust, which is from
the original model made by P. Marion
Wells, a cast of which is in the lecture hall
of the Academy of Sciences, is this in
scription :
JAMES LICK
Bequeathed to the
Mechanics' Institute
of
San Francisco
The sum of $10,000 for the
Purchase of Mechanical and
Scientific Books.
The amount of the gift was long ago
gradually expended for the purpose for
which the money was given, but this is
the first public acknowledgement that the
institute has made of the bequest. >
Six weeks ago a committee consisting of
Messrs. Leggett, Holmes and Root decided
upon such a means of recording the dona
tion, and the design by Whyte & De Rome
was accepted. The casting is of bronze,
weighs 195 pounds, is four feet high by
thirty-one inches. across, and cost $250, a
much smaller amount than would have
been possible had a new bust model been
made. â¢ , . <
The prominent place given the bronze
relief, near the wide front windows of the
delivery-room, makes it easily noticeable
to passers-by on Post street.
AN APPEAL FROM LEPERS
The Unfortunates at the Pest
house Ask for Proper
Remedies.
Supervisor Benjamim Has Undertaken
to Raise a Fund to Buy the
Medicines.
Supervisor Benjamin is agitating a
scheme for relief for the unfortunate vic
tims of leprosy confined at the Pesthouse
in the way of procuring remedies for the
disease from Japan. Physicians in the
realm of the Mikado have recently dis
covered medicines that, while they are not
guaranteed to cuie the scourge, nave been
found to be efficient in checking its prog
ress and rendering the condition of the
unfortunate much more endurable.
frank Bindt, a young white leper, now
an inmate of the Pesthouse, recently ad
dressed the following communication to
Mr. Benjamin :
Dear Sir: The patients in here have a favor
to beg of you. We look upon you as a friend
and trust that you will help us. About three
weeks ago we appealed to the Board of Health
to get us some .tapanere remedies from Japan.
They are the only remedies known to-day
that will do any good in the treatment of
leprosy.
I sent the Board of Health full particulars
concerning these remedies, and the last we
heard of it was that the board had the matter
under consideration.
We patients are so anxious to get these
remedies that we are worrying lest the Board
of Health decides unfavorably in the matter,
and we beg of you to use your influence with
the doctors in our behalf.
I received a letter the other day written by
thÂ« superintendent of the leper Receiving
Hospital in Honolulu. He is a leper himself,
and this is what he says about these remedies:
My opinion U that the (Joto remedies are the
best known so fur. I have found them very roo<l in
my own case and think th.it you could us-- them
with great success. Ido not mean to say that in
all Ckses they will effect a cure, but experience 1111.1
proven thut if the remedies are faithfully taken it
will rid the patient of the spots on the. body, the
thickening of the skia on the face, and the itching
sensations on the soles of the feet would disapixjar
In a few months.
The above quoted extract truthfully states
what these remedies can accomplish, and it is
only one of many proofs that 1 can show in
favor of these remedies.
Trusting that you will excuse the liberty I
have taken, and hoping you will do what you
can for all of us, I remain very respectfully
yours, Frank Bindt.
Supervisor Benjamin says that he in
tends doing everything in his power to al
leviate the sufferings of the lepers. He
understands that neither the Board of
Health nor the Board of Supervisors can
do anything officially to provide the $200
necessary to buy the remedies, but he in
tends to use every endeavor to see that a
fund is raised for the purpose. He offers
to see tnat any sums that are forwarded to
him are placed in responsible hands until
the necessary funds are raised.

WATER MONOPOLY
TO BE ABOLISHED
Spring Valley Decides to
Revoke a Special
Privilege.
RATES TO BE REDUCED.
Ships in the Harbor Soon to Be
Supplied By Meter
Measurement.
STOEY OF THE NEGOTIATIONS.
For Fifteen Years Goodall, Perkins &
Co. Have Had the Prerogative
of Supplying Ships.
The assurance comes from Hermann
Sehussler, chief engineer of the Spring
Valley Water Works, that the special
privilege accorded to Goodall, Perkins &
Co. of supplying ships with water will be
withdrawn by tbe company on or before
July 1 next. The firm here mentioned
has had this monopoly on the waterfront
for fifteen years, and has regularly paid
the water corporation $ICoO a month for
the perogative.
In view of what has been published in
The Call concerning the interview be
iween the water committee of the Grand
Jury and Mr. Schussler, the statement of
the chief engineer possesses more than
passing interest.
Mr. Schussler was seen at his residence
last evening and said:
"This question of supplying ships was
first brought to my attention by tiae Har
bor Commissioners a long time before the
Grand Jury had anything to do with it.
The Commissioners introduced it, and, in
an interview with Harbor Commissioner
Colnon, I told him that the easy solution
would be for the commission to supply the
water at meter measurement and make
the collection. I Jtook the repsonsibility
of saying that our directors would abolish
the contract with Goodall, Perkins & Co.
if the Commissioners would perform the
service.
"Therfiupon Mr. Colnon referred the
subject to the attorney of the Harbor Com
missioners and the board received legal
advice against the proposition.
"The version of the negotiations with
the Grand Jury, as published in The
Call," said Mr. Schussler, "is at Jeast
premature. Some one whose knowledge is
not correct has been talking for cheap
glory, and I am sure it was not Mr. Theo
dore Payne. Now, I had an interview
with the water committee of the Grand
Jury, and the subject of supplying ships
was introduced. I did agree, speaking for
the company, that the relief desired would
be afforded. It is my recollection that I
met Messrs. Payne, O'Connor, Price and
Landers. To get the matter properly be
fore the board Mr. Payne put in writing
the request for our directors to adopt.
When the directors met our attorney Mr.
Kellogg suggested some changes in the
phraseology of Mr. Payne's communica
tion, and tt:en in the absence of Charles
Webb Howard, the president, the matter
was referred to Mr. Pay son, our vice
president, our attorney, Mr. Kellogg, and
myself.
"We met the Grand Jury committee the
following day, and then for the first time I
observed that the document drawn by our
attorney differed somewhat from tiie one
dictated by Mr. Payne. Meanwhile Mr.
Payson did not want to abolish the privi
lege without first consulting Mr. Howard
who was then in San Diego. Mr. Howard
was accordingly advised by wire of the
negotiations, and I asked the Grand Jury
committee to await his reply. This was
readily assented to and Mr. Howard will
be home to-day or to-morrow.
"We have decided now to take this water
front service into our own hands and will
supply ships at meter measurement. What
will be a fair rate cannot be determined
until we ascertain the cost of the service,
but surely we will Rive the shipping a re
duction equal to tiie profit made by the
firm of Goodall, Perkins <fc Co.
"Again the Supervisors," continued Mr.
Schussler, "did take up the Grand Jury
communication relative to water for ships,
and 1 agreed that the Water Committee of
the board should hereafter be consulted in
adjusting rates for shipping.
"The order fixing water rates should
have received twelve votes in the Board of
Supervisors, and it cuts no figure whether
it was considered forty minutes or forty
days. When rates were established one
year ago Chief Sullivan of the Fire Depart
ment wanted extra large mains in the
boarding-house district north of Market
street, and larger mains for a vast sec
tion south of Market. He also wanted
a reservoir on Clarendon Heights, which
involved pumping (500 feet high. An ex
tension of the Mission pipeline was de
sired, and many other things were asked.
Then I said we could not go to that outlay
of $300,000 when we had no assurance that
the rates lixed would be maintained for
more than one year. We were then as
sured, and Supervisor Taylor was the
spokesman, that if the company would do
what the Chief of the Fire Department
then demanded for Clarendon Heights and
other districts, that the rates would re
main undisturbed for two years. We ful
filled our part of the compact, and even
went further and extended a pipe to the
Cliff House."
Mr. Schussler will meet representatives
of the Grand Jury sorrte time to-day, and
it is probable that an agreement will be
reached in regard to water for ships.
THE SCHOOL MAY OPEN.
Boards of Health and Education to Dis-
cuss tho Matter This Morn
ing.
The committee of the whole of the
Board of Education, which met last even
ing to consider the closing of the Long
fellow School by the Board of Health,
came to no conclusion, except to decide to
meet the members of the Board of Health
to-day to try to devise some way of re
opening the institution.
Dr. Lovelace was present and stated
that the main reason for closing the
school was that during the past three
months nineteen cases of scarlet fever
had been reported from the neighborhood
of the school, six of them being pupils.
Dr. Clinton thought the Board of Health
was aoiug its duty in shutting the school
in the face of a threatened epidemic.
Superintendent Babcock questioned the
authority of the Board of Health to close
the school.
Dr. Lovelace thought that if arrange
ments were made to abate the nuisance,
which he was sure existed at the Longfel
low, the school could be opened soon and
permanent repairs made during the long
vacation.
The chair appointed Directors Clinton,
Henderson and Knox as a committee to
confer with the Board of Health this morn
ing.
MUNGER MAKES DENIAL
The Captain of the Cutter Perry
Says He Was Never Drunk
on Duty.
Dispatches From the Northwest, How
ever, Tend to Corroborate the
Serious Charges.
The news of the charges filed against
Captain Munger of the revenue cutter
Perry, as published in The Call yester
day, was the topic of conversation in
marine circles throughout the day. The
general expression on the subject seemed
to be not so much surprise as anticipation
of further developments.
According to the subjoined dispatches.
Captain Munger emphatically denies the
truth of the serious charges" against his
official demeanor, while some corrobora
tion is obtained from other quarters:
AT PORT TOWNSEND.
No Surprise Expressed at the News of
Charges Having Been Filed Against
Captain Mnnger.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 24.â
Word was received here to-day that Lieu
tenant Ross, formerly of the revenue cut
ter Corwin, had filed charges with the
Treasury Department against Captain
Munger, charging him with drunkenness
while on duty in the Bering Sea last sum
mer.
The captain is at present in Seattle, but
inquiry here among the revenue cutter
set developed the fact that there is no sur
prise among them that this step has been
taken by Lieutenant Ross. In fact it is
more or les3 openly asserted that a much
stronger case could be made against
Munger than against HeaJy, who is now
on trial charged with a like offense.
A Government otficial here asserts that
he heard a story recently that was vouched
for by no less than five officers of the
revenue cutter service to the effect that on
one occasion wtien nearly one hundred of
ficers and men were standing on the
wharf at Unalaska, Captain Munger came
staggering down the wharf drunk and
otherwise made an exhibition of himself.
Ross also says that he tiled charges with
Captain Hooper, in command of the
Bering Sea fleet, but that Hooper ignored
them. To offset this statement it is
known that when here recently Captain
Hooper said that some complaint was
marie to him about Munger's conduct last
summer, but that no one would file
specific charges.
It was Munger's promotion to superin
tend the construction of ttie new revenue
cutter that brought matters to a head. It
was learned here to-day that these charges
have been ready for presentation for some
months, but that it was agreed they
should be withheld until there was further
offense on the part of the captain. But
recently Captain Hooper recommended
Munger for the appointment as superin
tendent, which he later received, and
Hooper was then told that if he would
withdraw his recommendation the charges
would not be filed against Munger.
MUNGER'S DENIAL.
The CaptÃin Declares He Was Never Intoxi
cated While on Dutyâ Sailor Drowned
in Taku Harbor,
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 24. â Captain
Munger, wno was detached from the Cor
win in this port to-day, having received
instructions to report for duty to Captain
Hooper as Superintendent of Construction
and Repairs for the Pacific Coast, had this
to say when informed by the United Press
correspondent of the charges preferred by
Lieutenant R083 :
"This is the first intimation I have had
that charges were preferred against me. I
characterize the accusation of drunkenness
as untrue, denying most emphatically that
1 was intoxicated while in the Bering Sea
or at any other time when on duty.
"As to the sailor who was drowned a
year ago in April in Taku harbor, it was
an accident such as no human effort could
have prevented, and I came near losing
my own life. Twelve seamen and myself
in one ship's boat with a seine were re
turning from shore to the vessel. When
within fifty feet of the Corwin a 'Wollier'
squall from the top of one of those Alaskan
mountains stuick us and buried the boat,
throwing all into the water. Two stayed
by the boat, and the rest, save Welin,'the
sailor who was drowned, swam to the ship,
though 1 would have drowned within ten
feet of the vessel if I had not been rescued,
for I was weighted down with a big fur
coat.
"Lieutenant Ross was not attached to
the Corwin at the time of this accident;
consequently he must be preferring
charges either from hearsay evidence or
tfie reports of some maliciously disposed
person."

REV. COLBURN CLEARED.
The Pastor of Grace Methodist
Church Was Wrongfully
Arrested.
INDORSED BY MINISTERS.
Captain Thompson Explains That It
Was a Mistake â Resolutions
of Confidence.
When the case of Rev. M. F. Colburn,
pastor of Grace Methodist Episcopal
Church, charged with violating a park or
dinance, was called in JiKlge Low's court
yesterday morning Captain Thompson of
the park police appeared and requested
Prosecuting Attorne}' Madden to ask that
the case be dismissed, which was accord
ingly done. The case ajrainst Harry Jack
son, the barber, was also dismissed.
Oar>tain Thompson explained that Park
Officers Dow and Beattie were wrong in
making the arrests. The reverend gentle
man told the officers at the time of his ar
rest that they had made a mistake, and
inquiry had proved that he was correct.
At the Methodist preachers' meeting
yesterday upon the request of Rev M. F.
Colburn a committee was appointed to in
vestigate the cause of his rerent arrest. The
following pastors were appointed: Dr. W.
\V. Tase," Dr. E. R. Dille and Dr. W. S.
Matthew. These gentlemen withdrew and
before the close of the meeting tendered
the following report:
Your committee, to whom was referred the
matter of the arrest on Saturday evening of
the Rev. M. F. Colburn, for violating a park
ordinance, respectfully report:
That, after hearing "a full statement of the
facts from Mr. C'olburn, corroborated by sev
eral gentlemen, we find that his innocence of
any offense is conclusively demonstratedâ that
there is absolutely no stain upon his character.
The dismissal ot the case by Judge Low, the
statement of the gentleman arrested with him
and the admission ot the arresting officers, to
gether with the circumstances in the case,
entirely establish the truth of Mr. Colburn's
own assertion of innocence.
\V. \V. Task,
K. K. Dii.i.e,
W. S. Matthew,
Committee.
The report was adopted by a rising vote.
On the motion of Dr. Filben it was resolved
that the committee go before the Police i
Department and have a thorough investi
gation made of the arrest, which Dr. Diile
stigmatized as an outrage. Dr. Case and
Dr. Filben were added to the committee
for this purpose.
Rev. Dr. Coyle and Rev. Mr. Filben,
representing the Methodist ministers, ad
dressed the Monday Club yesterday in re
gard to the arrest of Rev. Mr. Coiburn.
They said the charges were utterly with
out foundation, the case having been dis
missed in the Police Court.
On motion of Rev. Dr. fond a commit
tee of three was appointed to draft suita
ble resolutions. This committee, consist
ing of Dr. Pond, Rev. Mr. Rader and Pro
fessor Cook, handed in the following,
which was unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That we have heard with deep in
terest the statement of Rev. l>r. Covle, as rep
resentative of the M. K. Preachers' Meeting, in
the matter of the arrest of Rev. M. F. Colburn
by the park police, and desire to express our
deep sympathy with our Methodist brethren
and with our brother Colburn in particular,
hikl we indignantly demand the most thorough
investigation of this apparent outrage by the
Park Commissioners or whatever other officials
have that duty in charge.
NEW FACTORY COMING.
The Salamander Fireproof Paint Manu
facturing Company Proposes to
Locate in This City.
H. A. Keimann, representing the
Palaropnder Fireproof Paint Manufactur
ing Company of Tacoma, Wash., is in this
City. He states that the company has de
cided to make San Francisco its head
quarters an a manufacturing and supply
center.
According to Mr. Reimann the paint is
something new, is composed of purely
mineral nnd vegetable substances ana is
pronounced by experts to be absolutely
non-combustible, while at the same time
partaking of all the properties of an oil
paint. He promises that it will become
valuable for use in and about saw,
shingle and lumber mills, factories,
warehouses and wherever the danger from
fire is unusually creat and insurance rates
are high. He say 9it is also in practical
use as a cheap and efficient covering for
steam pipes.
In an interview Mr. Reimann said:
"The Pacific Coast presents an excellent
held for the manufacture and sale of this
new product, owing to the minerals be
ing found in quantities in this State. At
the start the factory will employ from
twenty to thirty hands and will represent
an investment of $20,000. The capacity of
the plant will be increased as the demand
grows."
With Mr. Reimann, who is engaged in
placing orders for future delivery, is W. H.
Keeley.whois looking out for the neces
sary machinery and site for the plant.
He will take charge of the factory when in
operation.

HENLEY TALKS FOR HEALY
Closing Argument on Behalf of
the Accused Commander
of the Bear.
LIEUTENANT DANIELS SCORED.
Judge Advocate Reynolds Says That
Captain Healy Is Not Under
Airest.
Captain Hoaly, properly attired in full
drors uniform, wore a very contented smile
yesterday as he sat at ease in his armchair
within tlio yunrdei! precincts of room S3 of
the United States Appraisers' building.
His casi> was practically ended, and the
veteran commander was present in the
Inquiry-chamber to li>ten to the able and
brilliant argument of his attorney, Barclay
Henley. In another corner of the apart
ment sat Lieutenant Reynolds, the genial
young judge-advocate, while in a dark
some nook Lieutenant Paniels sat and
glowered. The other officers occupied sta
tions about the room in accordance with
iheir rank, and for three hours not a
sound was audible save the melodious rise
and fall of Mr. Henley's rich, persuasive
voice, whirl) could be plainly heard even
outside the council chamber for some dis
tance down the corriii' r.
Mr. Henley's arraignment of Dr. Sharp
was scorching. He accused tnat individ
ual of keeping a memorandum book dur
ing his voyage on the Bear, wherein he
l inlously iM, ted irom day to day every
winch could be construed to Captain
Healy's discredit* even by fantastically
foived interpretations.
"With that bouk hugged close to his
breast with one hand," pursued Mr. Hen
li v, "Dr. Sharp scrupled not to extend the
other to receive the gifts which the cap
tain generously gave himâ rare curios and
quaint mementoes of the Arctic which
were valuable In more ways than one.
Tins monster of in gratitude is tne one who
fceems to have exerted himself more than
nil the smailttr fry of bis kind to bring dis
grace and ruin down upon the gray head
of his host. Nn convict in the gloomy
precincts of San Quentin would even
dream of descending to such depths of
baseness
"The testimony against my client is not,
however, ;iil of a repulsive character.
'lake, for instance, that delicious little bit
contributed by Master Daniels, wherein
that youth accuses hifl aped commander of
Bpitting in his fan-. Seriously taken, this
t v: lence is a two-edged sword in the vitals
oi n> author. It i.-- either true or false. If
false, Daniels is a perjurer. If true, he has
. and i raveuly swallowed an insult
which any being worthy of the name of
man would consider unpardonable. He
say.- he cried out to Emery for help. A
man would have flown at Captain Healy
in an ungovernable impulse of outraged
honor and would have sought to wipe out
the infamous stain with his offender's
l ! od. No. gentlemen, we had better not
take this \ u-sage of the testimony seri
ously. It must have been a " little
mtly designed by Mr. Daniels for our
amusement â crude and ill-timed, perhaps,
i'.'.t after all only a harmless joke."
.Mr. Henley's peroration was brilliant
and effective." He said:

foot was on his quarterdeck to '-shield It aiid
save it or perish therein." And, then, officers
and men knew that a man and a sailor was in
charge, and if safety consisted in courage and
skill no harm could befall.
And, gentlemen, it is to command and navi-
Kate ships that the Government wants gallons.
It is not the pretty young men with the per
fumed locks that the Government of the United
Mates wantsâ one made to "caper nimbly in a
a lady's chamber to the lascivious pleasing? of
the lute.' ' but it is the man who knows bis pro
feaaioÃ and yields his best energies to his
Government. It may be that Captain Healy
lacks in diplomatic power, lacks possibly when
on duty a certain suavity of manner, but it is
not the practice oi those things that the Gov
ernment looks to. True, he ha.- made enemies.
Oliver Wendell Holmes says. "We must have
a weak spot or two in a character before we
can love it raucn." From still higher au
thority we learn that "He makes no friends
who never had a foe." and, summing up all of
the accusations made against him in his sea
iaring experience with his accusors, it comes
to about this: That some feeling has been
generated in the course of the hurley burlcy
ai.d the vissitude and vexations of a long irk
some and dangerous cruise. Those events
have been taken up, magnified, inverted,
twisted and soucht to be converted Into some
thing i-erious. The effort is idle, and the testi
mony falls preposterously short of sustaining
the accusation.
Captain Healy is a strong, virile character,
and like all such may have some angularities
of disposition. It is always the case with such
as he. It is so with all marked, conspicuous
personalities. The late deiuge ot Napoleanic
literature has revealed peculiarities of that
overshadowing genius that have filled us will;
surprise. But we do not require to go beyond
the Immediate circle of our acquaintances to
discover eccentricities of character that are
not always wnoliy agreeable. 1 have in my
own exuerienco been frequently reminded
of it.
I have made enemies without knowing it.
Being abstracted I have passed friends and ac
quaintances in the street, not speaking to
them, and being wholly unconscious of the ap
parent incivility. But it is snid that Captain
llealy is a hard man or an unpleasant man to
sail with. That charge seems to have resolved
itself into this: That he keeps men up to their
dutyâ mases every one on board toe the mark,
aud the small enmities, the petty strifes en
gendered in a long cruise by daily contact in
the small compass of a ship's dimension, have
their vent in these charges.
These charges are not the well considered,
well meant or deliberate expression of their
authors, and I venture to say that if they had
not started this crusade up Â»t I'nalaska, but
had awaited their arrival here, the sober .>.ec
oud thought would have asserted itself, and
they never would have been heard of. Take
this case, then, gentlemen of the l>oard, and
give it your best consideration. It is a case of
ias>t moment to this man. His good name is
all that he has. It Is precious to himâ "dear
as the ruddy drops that visit his sad heart"-
If cause there are those in this world that love
him. He has a family, kindredand friends.
Ho has pavscl through a terrible ordeal. He
admits drinking more than he should nave
done, or ever will do again. You are not called
upon to administer rhadamanthine justice-
The undiscriiutnating machinery of your
system has made you the arbitors of this
ofiieer's destiny, and this without your prior
knowledge or wish. This nlothes you with the
necessity of discharging a solemn duty. It I
ask you to deal with him with that gentle and
considerate regard for human weakness, the
exercise of which glows with the radiance of a
divine oblivion of venial faults, do I step aside
from my duty? This great Government of
ours, wise, potential and benificent, does not
want to degrade Its old and loyal servitor after
thirty j car's of magnificent service. As for tiie
charge of intoxication why mould we be
Pharisees or hypocrites? Ever since the Creator
fashioned this world of ours and sent it whirl
ing through blue ether, men have been drink
ing too lmieh at times; ana upon occasions of
convivialityâ when the flowing bowl, when
festivities are the object of a social gathering
because a man "looks upon the wine when it
is red," because in such an environment he
tÂ«kes more than he ought if upon his quarter
deck, or on dutyâ it is a hard thing that a
Draconian punishment should be pressed upon
him. If the army and navy and Doth houses
ot Congress, and even the judiciary and the
civil departments of the Government were
purged of all men who at dinners, and sappers,
and such like occasions have been intoxicated
to the degree that Captain Healy was on board
the Phessnt, the British man-of-war, in the
language of Judge Cobb of Georgia, "where
would he be at?"
lint enough, and more than enough. We
submit this can to you with confidence that
you have no disposition to do other than right,
Hint that is all we want. Whatever of trutti
there may be in the various and diverse
schemes of theology extant, one tenet of my
faith is this: Thatfor every unworthy act â
base, cruel, dishonorable or oppressiveâ Â«e
mast atone in tne hereafter. Expiation for
wrong-doing is the certain doom of every mor
tal born beneath heaven's firmament. When
you come to dispose of this man's case 1 only
ask that you so judge him that when you are
called upon to render an an account of the
deeds done in the flesh you can ask to have the
same rule applied to you that you shall apply
to your brother Eaiior in distress, Michael A.
Healy. A divine rule, well called "golden,"
says:" "As ye would that men should do to
you do ye even so to them." These principles
have been my rule of conduct in life. I know
that in the dread future from my â wailing lips
shall come an appeal for indulgence, clemency
âaye, lor mercy. Where dwells the man on
earth of whom the same need not be said?
At the conclusion of the argument the
officers filed out of the inquiry-chamber
into a sort of greenroom, where they put
on the trappings of ordinary men. To-day
Lieutenant Reynolds will argue the case
for the prosecution, after which the board
Of inquiry will make a report on the evi
dence and forward all papers in the case to
the Secretary of the Treasury at Washing
ton.
An opinion prevails that CaptaÂ»n Healy's
legal advisers will make a stroug endeavor
to keep the case from going before Secre
tary Hamlin for adjudication. Harnlin's
conduct in taking official cognizance of a
private dispatch from Lieutenant. Emery
against the captain indicates, in their
opinion, a certain animus on the treasury
Official's cart toward the old commander.
Hence it is believed that they will seek to
have the case referred to some other com
petent authority for decision.
One of the officials took occasion yes
terday to contradict a report to the effect
that Cantain Healy, pending the result of
the inquiry, is out on bail with his salary
reduced to $SOO a year.
'"It is all a mistake," said the suave
man in blue. "Captain Healy is a free
man. and if you add a thousand or so to
the $800 you may not quite reach his pay,
which is that of a captain in good stand
ing while unattached."
There May Jse Another Side.
TORT TOWN'SEND, Wash.. Feb. 24.â
Revenue cutter officials on Puget Sound
say there is a surprise in store for those
who have been accepting newspaper ac
counts of the testimony in the case against
Captain Healy, now on trial at San Fran
cisco. One of the witnesses, who was here
recently, said that in the case of his own
testimony it has been utterly distorted by
whoever gave it out to the newspapers.
He says he had learned that the same was
true of othÂ«r witnesses before the court.
He asserts that Captain Healy 's friends are
attempting to try the case in the news
papers, and that the prosecution will be
found very strong when the findings are
made public.
THEIR FIRST EXCURSION
Firemen Are Preparing for Their
Regular Summer Vaca
tion.
The Delay of Supervisors in Making
an Appropriation Retarded
the Outing.
At their next few meetings the Fire
Commissioners will have their time taken
up with applications for leaves of absence,
presented by the permanent employes of
the department. The fire laddies have
been in consultation for some weeks trying
to settle on their respective vacations so as
not to leave the department all at once.
This is the first time since the last Legis
lature passed an act granting each fireman
in the State a furlough for '"not more than
fifteen days" that the subject has been
given much attention. The principal rea
son forthis is given by Chief Sullivan, who
spoke yesterday to a Call reporter in the
premises.
'When the Legislature passed the bill,"
he said, "it took some time for the Boards
of Supervisors throughout the State to
settle on the appropriation to be made to
pay the extra men or substitutes to replace
the regujars.
'â¢In this county $15,000 was asked for, but,
it was cut down to $10,000, which is not
sufficient as the matter stands. You see,
there are in the neighborhood of 140 regu
lar men from bottom to top in the depart
ment. Their salaries average about $105
per month, not counting the engineers,
who get $140 per month. But, however, if
the appropriation is not sufficient to allow
each man rifteen "lays' vacation we will
have to take less.
"I believe this rest is a* useful thing, es
pecially for the men who work in the
downtown districts year in and year out
thirty days each month and on watch
quite often twenty-four hours in the day.
"The reason the men have heretofore
not availed themselves of the opportunity
for a rest is that the Board of Supervisors
did not make the appropriation until the
3d of last September, when it was too late
to gÂ»t out in the country. But this year I
expect all mv boys to get their furloueh.
They will comeback so much better for
their outing."
THE LANE CASE.
Opening Statementsâ Jurors Taken to
the Defendant's House.
The Lane case opened before Judge
Belcher yesterday, but counsel and jury
got only far enough for the opening state
ments, and then court was adjourned
until the jury could be taken down to
Lane's home, 141 Chestnut street, where
the jurora could see the premises.
John A. Hosmer, Assistant District At
torney, made the opening statement for
the people and George A. Knight followed
him at once with the defense's statement.
The defense will rely mainly upon the in
credibility of the complaining witness,
Lane's record and his physical infirmities.
Counsel, Judge and jury spent the after
noon at Lane's house, examining rooms
and hallways, which will be referred to in
the trial.

SUTTER'S BIG PRODUCTS.
Such Another Outlook for Wheat
and Barley Has Never
Been Known.
A GREAT YIELD OF FRUIT.
But There Has Been a Slump in Prices
for Dried Fruits and Growers
Are Blue.
S. J. Stabler, the *pioneer of Yuba City,
who is. both an attorney and a fruit and
grain-grower, is at the Lick.
lie says that when there is a big lot of
dried fruit in that part of California the
price is so low that there is almost no
money in it. Wheat and barley have ad
vanced materially, however, so that the
situation is about balanced.
Mr. Stabler has 200 acres planted in
fruit and about 500 acres in grain.
"Though dried fruit is low," he said,
"the people cannot buy it because of the
close times. Other industries are not

running. Fruit is in a sense a luxury.
People need bacon, flour, sugar and coffee,
and they can live on these, but it is not
absolutely necessary that they have fruit;
it is in the nature of a luxury.
"The price is lower now for dried fruit
than it has been for a number of years. In
l^i'L' dried prunes, which are the greatest
thing In dried fruits, were worth !3}Â£ cents
a pound; in IK<<3, 8 cents; in 1891, o'jj
cents, and in 1895 but 3'^ cents.
"These are the prices which have ob
tained at Yuoa City. Any one can see
there has been a big tumble. It is not
surprising, therefore, if fruit men are a
little hard up, unless, indeed, they have
got even on somethine else. We ship
from Sutter County probably seventy-live
cars of dried fruit each season.
"Of green fruit we have shipped this
year approximately 350 cars. Canned
fruit is doing pretty well up there.
"I am glad to say that what we lose on
fruit we will probably make up on wheat,
barley and other grain. The wheat crop
is bip. There is a much larger acreage
than usual and it is coming along in as
fine shape as could bt desired. There will
undoubtedly be a heavy yield.
"Wheat in September, 1894, at Yuba
City was worth 06 cents, now it $1 08. Bar
ley has about doubled in price also. In
September, 1894, it was worth 45 cents;
now it is worth 75.
"Xo doubt our people will make a great
deal of money out of their grain. I nave
been in Sutter County forty years and 1
cannot remember of ever seeing finer pros
pects."
Mr. Stabler i 9 here on a business trip and
Will remain three or four days. He says
the San Jose Packing Company is now
building a bis fruit cannery at Marysville,
just across the river from Yaba City. It
will have a capacity of over 100,000 cases a
year. There is already a large oannery in
Yuba City.
Mr. Stabler thinks this year's product of
fruit will, like the grain crop, be heavy.
All indications point that way.
A PRINCE AT SAN RAFAEL
Signor Fugazi Entertains His

The Vessel Will Leave San Fran
cisco Harbor on Next Sunday
Morning.
The beautiful little suburban town of
San Rafael has been honored by a visit
from the royal house of Savoy. This dis
tinguished mark of recognition is due to
the hospitality of J. F. Fugazi of San
Francisco, who while recognizing his dis
tinguished countryman, ypt in honor of
the father of his adopted country, selected
Washington's birthday as one befitting
the occasion of giving what he termed an
international dinner at his summer resi
dence in San Rafael in honor of the King
who so royally entertained him on his re
cent visit to the land of his birth.
The following are the names of those
present on this occasion:
Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Fugazi, Commander Berto

P. A. Morbio, Count Sini, Paul Barbieri and
F. N. Belgrano.
This will be the last week of the stay of
the Cristoforo Colombo in our harbor", as
she will trip anchor on next Sunday morn
ing and proceed south.
At the close of the breakfast Mr. Fugazzi
presented to the Prince and the com
mander of the ColomDo handsome souve
nirs in the shape of solid cold match
boxes, covered on one side with the differ
ent shades of California gold quartz, and
on the reverse side bearing an engraving
representing a sunset at Golden Gate, with
a large diamond showing as the spark of
the dying orb. The guests were delighted

club and who owns several good saddle
horses, invited two of his fellow-members,
T. A. Griffiths and H. W. Spaldine, out
for ride with him and mounted them
upon nis finest stock. The result was just
what he "expected, they were delighted
with the ride, told all other members what
sport it is, and a club run of the Bay City
Wheelmen on horseback seems now ah
assured fact in the near future. It might
be added that Griffiths and Spalding are
expert horsemen as well as bicyclists, and
as this cannot be said of all the club's
members, the ride should be productive of
some very funny incidents, o
. The Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oak
land have an interesting ride scheduled
for next Sunday. They will board a tug
with their wheels at the foot" of First
street, Oakland, and disembark at Sausa
lito. The tug will then proceed outside
the heads to Point Bonita, to â¢ which
place the wheelmen will ride overland.
After a hearty lunch they will have a tug
ride to points of interest around the bay,
and then return to Oakland.
Lieutenant Caldwell has called a run of
the Bay City Wheelmen for next Sunday
to Centerville. The run will be paced by
Harry Terrill and Charley Wells on a tan
dem.
The visiting committee of the League of
American Wheelmen will visit the Reli
ance Club Wheelmen of Oakland to-mor
row evening.
Entries for the indoor tournament, which
opens next week, are coming in fast, ana
the affair is an assured race. The Sunday
racing feature is to be allowed, and tne
day And evening will probably be the best
of the meet. Charles S. Wells, who made
fastest time in the great twenty-five mile
road race last Saturday, is entered, and
will ride in all the big events.
THEY WILL WAIT.
Election Commissioners Will Not Make
Preparations for the Primaries
-I nst Now.
The Board of Election Commissioners
has changed its mina regarding going on
with preparations for the primary elec
tions without waiting for the Supreme
Court to pass on the validity of the law
providing for them. At the meeting yes
terday City and County Attorney Cress
well said that his opinion that the law is
unconstitutional is so strong that he must
vote asrainst spending any money toward
preparing for the elections until the mat
ter is settled by the court. He prevailed
upon the other Commissioners to defer
further action for the present.
Charged "With Embezzlement.
Walter Loring, 20 years of age, a collector
for the S. P. Taylor Company, Clay street, was
arrested last night by Detectives Gibson and
Wren ou the charee "of embezzlement. The
amount embezzled is placed at $52. Loring
clatens that the money was stolen from him.
STUBBS MUST EXPLAIN
The Southern Pacific Official
Has a Hard Task in
Chicago.
TROUBLE FOE THE RAILROAD.
Western Lines Press the Charges of
Violating the Interstate Com
merce Act.
The summary demand which J. C.
Stubbs, third vice-president and general
freight and passenger manager of the
Southern Pacific Company, has received
from the Interstate Commerce' Commis
sion was the chief topic of conversation
among local railway ticket agents yes
terday.
Mr. Stubbs had only concluded some
arduous work connected with Western and
Southwestern freights at St. Louis, and
was on his way home from the East when
the demand reached him. He was at New
Orleans at the time in his private car com
ing westward, but an officer of the Federal
Uovernment intercepted him with a sum
mons from the Interstate Commerce Com
mission in Chicago. The Southern Pacific
manager had to change his route and go
North to make explanations. So much
was stated in a dispatch from New Or
leans published in The Call:
The railway men know a great deal
more, however, and say that Stubbs is
wanted by the Commissioners to show
cause why either he or some other official
of the Southern Pacific Company should
not be punished for violation of the inter
state commerce act in transporting sailors
clear across the country at a rate far below
the standard of second class passenger
fares. This of itself is a breach of the law.
But it was stated yesterday that com
bine of the Southern Pacific with the Sea
board Air line to carry the bluejackets at a
two-third rate was also a clear case of vio
lation of the interstate act.
The former violation is covered by sec
tion 2 of the act, whicii says:
That if any common carrier subject to the
provisions of this act shall, directly or in
directly, by any special rate, rebate, drawback
or other device", charge, demand, collect or re
ceive from any person or piersons a greater or
less compensation for any service rendered, or
to be rendered, in the transportation of pas
sengers or property, subject to the provisions
of this act, than it charges, demands, collects
or receives from any other person or persons
for doing for him or for them a like # and con
tempornnous service in the transportation of
a like kind of trattic under substantially simi
lar circumstances and conditions, such com
mon carrier shall be deemed guilty of unjust
discrimination, which is hereby prohibited
and declared to be unlawful.
Section 6 provides that established rates
of fare s^all be displayed in every depot
and station of railway companies, and
further on it is stated that if reductions of
rates, fares or changes be made notice of
the same must be posted in these places.
The special low rate made for Uncle Sam's
sailors was not regarded as a permanent
reduction by the railway company, so it
was not given out in new schedules.
In every sense the Western railways re
pard the matter as a barefaced violation of
the interstate commerce law. An agent of
one of these lines said that his people were
greatly worked up over the sailors' rates,
because the Southern Pacific had com
bined with an Eastern road and taken the
men by New Orleans, thus diverting the
traffic from the Western lines.
The anger of these roads could not be
appeased by any other way than a strict
investigation of the offenders by the Inter
state Commerce Commission. Conse
quently they demanded a hearing of the
Southern Pacific's discrimination and, as
was generally understood by local agents
of the aggrieved companies yesterday, the
case will be vigorously prosecuted.
"This is a case of Greek meeting Greek,"
remarked one of the agents. "The South
ern Pacific is as cunning as they make
them, but there are times, like the present,
when two can play at that game. 1 know
that my people don't propose to see busi
nesi taken away from them in open viola
tion of the interstate law, and when the
commission gets Stubbs on the rack in
Chicago there is certain to be some inter
esting developments."
ALONG THE HER FRONT
Officers on the San Jose Say
Ezeta Is Making Peace
Overtures.
The Keel of a New Steam Whaler for
the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company Laid.
The steamer San Jose, which arrived
from Panama and wav ports last Sunday,
brought some interesting news about Pres
ident Gutierrez and Ezeta irom San Sal
vador. The country is rinding the burden
of keeping prepared lor aji invasion very
irksome, and Gutierrez is seeking for some
means of etiding the trouble. Ezeta's
arms are still in the hands of the Colom
bian authorities, and his tug, the Barelav
Golden, has been captured. He is still at
liberty, and as he still has a large follow
ing in his native country the Government
is constantly fearing an uprising.
According to the officers and passengers
on the San Jose, this state of affairs will
probably soon be changed. Ezeta's friends
are working with Gutierrez, and the pros
pects for a reconciliation were very good
when the steamer sailed. Should Ezeta
be forgiven he will be restored to citizen
ship and will probably have his property
returned. In this way it is hoped that
trouble will be averted.
There was a chapter of incidents on the
water front yesterday. Captain Olsen of
the schooner John D. Tallant was seri
ously injured by a tube that blew out of
the donkey boiler while he was handling
it. The vessel was in the stream, and
Olsen sought to get steam on the boiler.
He succeeded \ery well until he began to
experiment, and then the accident hap
pened. He will be laid up for several
days.
Captain Parker of the steamer Belvedere
attempted to save an old man's crabnet,
and in doing so fell overboard and was
nearly drowned. After be was cleaned up
a bit, he said, he did not mind the wetting
so much as he dirt the awful odor that
came from the Clay -street sewer when he
went under.
Hugh Smith, who works on State
dredger 1, also got a ducking. He was
holding the running rope when it broke,
and he was thrown over a raft of logs and
into the bay. He was fishtd out, but was
so bruised and shaken up that he was
compelled to go home.
The steamer Columbia, which had her
rudder-post broken on the Columbia River
bar, will go on the drydock for a thorough
overhauling. A new rudder-post will have
to be put in and the expense will be very
heavy. Captain Bolles was afraid of losing
the rudder on the way down, so he had
two wire ropes and two chains fastened to
it so that ip case of an emergency he
could still have managed to steer. The
Columbia brought down a large general
cargo.
The keel of a new steam whaler for the
Pacific Steam Whaling Company was laid
at Dickey's yards, Alameda, "yesterday
She will be 230 feet long, U feet broad, will
be rigged as a three-masted schooner and
her engines will be able to drive her at the
rate of eight knots an honr. She will be
thoroughly equipped with all the latest
appliances and Captain Knowles says she
will be one of the best vessels of her kind
in the world.
The steamer Monticello lost a blade of
her propeller during her run to San Fran
cisco last Sunday. She struck a project
ing rock near The Brothers, and had to
make port under a slow bell. Spreckels'
tug Active took her piace on the run, but
the Monticello was able to leave on time
again yesterday afternoon.
It is the general practice of all captains
of vessels comincto San Francisco to make
a report of their voyage to the Merchants'
Exchange. All the masters gladly give
all the information in their possession,
and, in nearly every instance, have it writ
ten. There is one exception. That is Cap
tain Merriman of the barkentine Gleaner.
When his vessel brought him in last night
from the Columbia River lie refused point
blank to make a report, and said it was
nobody's business buc his own. He was
formerly in the old Olive, and in those
days he was just as discourteous as he has
shown himself to be since he tooK the
Gleaner.
NOT FEDERAL SERVANTS.
Clerks of United States Officials
Cannot Sue the Govern
ment.
Must Lcok to District Attorneys and
Marshals for Pay for Their
Services.
The United States Court of Appeals yes
terday handed down an opinion affirming
the decision of the lower court in the case
of John M. McDonald against the United
States Government. The complainant
was a clerk in the United States Attorney's
office for the district of Montana. Ho
sued the Government for $12.'>7 for services
rendered in 1891, and on a trial suit se
cured judgment for the amount claimed.
The Court of Appeals held that the lower
court had erred in allowing judgment for
the claimant, since he had performed no
services for the Government; that he was
employed by the District Attorney of
Montana and paid out of the fees and
emoluments of thut office, and it was neld
that a person so employed was not an em
ploye of the Government.
The important point in the opinion is
the fact tnat it affects deputy clerks and
deputy marshals similarly employed, it
being contended that these officers are
not employes of the United States in the
sense that they can sustain an action
against the Government for their fees.
The decision was concurred in by
Judges Hawley and McKenna, but
lodge Gilbert dissented. The latter main
tained that the question at issue did not
turn so much upon the point whether or
not McDonald was an employe of the
Government as it did upon the question
whether or not he had a contract, ex
press or implied, with tho United States.
In his opinion the petitioner had a claim
upon the Government for service rendered
and the decision of the lower court should
be reversed.
IS RUSH INSANE?
The Man Who Shot Kathyrine Culli-
nane Kscapes From Two Police
men but Is Recaptured.
Charles A. Rush, who was arrested on
Friday for battery upon P. Ernest Ed
wards of the Edwards Publishing Com
pany, appeared in Judge Low's court 3res
terday morning. Mr. Edwards had sworn
to a complaint charging Rush with insan
ity. Judge Low ordered him to De taken
before Judge Hebbard for examination and
he was remanded till to-day.
Policemen McMurray and Petersen haa
charge of Rush, and as they were taking
him from Judge Hebbard'a court to the
Receiving Hospital he broke from them
and ran down City Hall avenue, closely
pursued by the officers, who overtook him
at Market street. Rush struggled fiercely
to get away from them again, but he was
overpowered and locked up in a padded
cell in the hospital.
Rush some time ago shot Kathyrlne
Cullinane, who was then doin^ a real
estate business, because he alleged she had
swindled him out of $3000 by promising to
invest it for him and marry him. lie
served a six months' sentence for the
shooting and since his release he has
haunted the office of the Edwards Pub
lishing Company, where Miss Cullinane is
now employed, which culminated in the
battery upon Mr. Edwards.

THE~ICTRESS } SECRET.
How She Kept Young and Fresh
Looking .
One of the most remarkable women in
America is a popular actress whose name is
known all over the world. She is a beautiful
and vivacious woman, and yet, strange to say,
she is nearly sixty years of age. In spite of
her advanced years she Is to-day as fresh and
youthful in appearance as many a woman of
thirty It was in a recent interview that she
told the secret of her marvelous vitality.
"I owe all my health and vigor," she said,
"to the fact that I am in the habit of occasion-
ally using a pure stimulant. About twenty
e\er Muce Whenever I feel at all weak or run
ever F&ce Whenever I feel at all weak or run
down I find it is the best thing I can take^n
order to get strength and energy. 1 ha t is why
I manage to Keep so young at ray age and never
know what it is to have a day's sickness.
For the information of ladies who may wish
to follow the example of this fortunate woman
it maybe added that Duffy's pure malt whiskey
is the stimulant to which she refers. bhe bu
for many years been enthusiastic in recom.
mending y it because she knows from her owa
experience that it is pure, healthful and in-
vigorating. She has found it uneoualed for
building up the system, and thousands of other
women have testified to the same effect. In ere
is in fact, nothing like Duffy's pure mall for
setting the blood in motion, toning up the
digestive organs and imparting new life ana
vigor. It is also the best thing to take for
curing or preventing colds, chills, coughs, the
grip or pneumonia. For this reason be careful
when ordering from your grocer or druggist to
insist on getting Duffy's pure malt whiskey ana
accept no substitute. There is nothing else
that can produce the same effects.

O great Mexican Kemedy; gives Health, a&i

The Grand Jury and Chief of I
Police Are Pulling To
gether.
SUSTAINED BY THE PUBLIC.
Jury Exasperated by the Conduct of
Supervisors in Fixing Water
Rates.
The Chief of Police in his campaign to
close the dens of iniquity on Morton street
from Kearny to Stockton is receiving the
unanimous support and commendation of
the Grand Jury. It transpires that the
subject of removing this blemish from San
Francisco has been discussed in the Grand
Jury room and urgent measures have
been recommended to bring about the de
tired reform.
The Grand Jury and Chief Crowley have
been assured by leading merchants,
property-owners and representative men
generally that arbitrary and extreme
measures under the law to abolish the
evils complained of will be fully sustained
l>y public sentiment.
When the Grand Jury at the session last
y sent for the Chief of Police the pur
:i view was to consider the Morton
s-treet proposition. It comes to iij;ht now
that the subject was not impulsively
taken Dp, but :t line.nf action to be pursued
was deliberately discussed and considered
in all its bearings. Therefore, it is said
that the campaign against vice on Morton
street will not consist simply of a few spas
niudic raids, but will tie persistently
pushed until tha', district in the center of
the town is reclaimed to civilization.
The laws are known to be ample for the
ression of the infamy which has been
bo long tolerated in that quarter. Encour
aged by the interpretation of the law by
Judge Wallace in the poolroom cases, the
authorities will be urped to prompt meas
ures against the offenders on Morton
street.
John T. Dare, as a prosecuting attorney,
is able to produce the decision of tlie Su
preme Court to make clear the proposition
that the Legislature lias conferred upon
the municipal governing body all the
power necessary to gambling-
M - and disorderly resorts. It is ex-
I that the degraded women and the
tea living on the wages of their deg
radation will organize and invoke the aid
of the "pull." The Grand Jury expects
that the keepers of bawdy-houses, backed
nts and owners of the property, may
contribute to a ''common pool" to right
tses in court, bat this expected onpo
will be met at the proper time. The
-- ninth the Chief of Police has
already made is significant and makes the
Grand Jury hopeful that the campaign
will end in a great victory for decency and
pood morals.
The conduct of the Supervisors in rush
ing the water order through the board
with haste unprecedented, "and in utter
contempt oi an tamest and courteous re
quest of the Grand Jury that relief should
â¢ended to the shipping interests, has
greatly exasperated some of the jurors.
It was supposed that the Supervisors
would deliberately consider the ordinance
establishing rates for the year beginning
July 1 next, bat instead of giving the im
portant question consideration they took
judgment, and instantly passed the
The speed of the transaction, the
ration for quick work, and the fact
â¢;.e communication from the Grand
was contemptuously ignored, make
the jurors believe that the whole plan oi
: \ing rates was preconcerted with the
.vance of the water company.
The Grand Jury is resolving a plan to
to public light all the facts and cir
cumstances connected with the disgrace
ful and unwarranted procedure. Several
members were so indignant when they
learned that the Spring Valley board of
directors had violated tneagreenient to re
duce the cost of water for ships that they
wanted to resign and abandon all effort to
bring relief to the commerce of tnis port.
Ihe talk of resigning was suppressed, and
a line of aggressive action recommended.
At the next meeting steps may be taken
to bring the Board of Supervisors to a
sense of its public responsibility in fixing
water rates.
WOMEN TO PROSECUTE.
The Federation Will Take an Active
Hand In Closing Morton
Street.
Ways and means for forcing the closing
of Morton street were discussed yesterday
at the weekly meeting of the Women's
Federation, and" it was finally resolved that
one or more of the property-owners should
be made a horrid example of.
Mrs. Bruner said: "It is an offense
against the laws of this State to rent
-â â > to the class of people to whom
Morton-street property is rented. Let us
j rosecute some of the landlords."
"The landlords are Supervisors, police
captains and pillars of the church," said
Mr 3. French. "Which shall we begin
with?"
. '"I think I would first prosecute the dea
cons wno draw an income from Morton
street property," said Mrs. Bruner. "I
move tiiat a committee of taxpaying citi
zens be appointed, and that we instruct
them to placa the matter in the hands of a
lawyer, with instructions that he immedi
ately proceed to prosecute the owner of
one of the houses.
"This will cost considerable money," in
terrupted Mrs. Rose French. "We have
lawyers who will charge us no fees, but the
owners of the property wiil place every
possible obstruction in our way. They
will be sure to carry the case to the Su
preme Court if the decision of the Superior
Court is in our favor, and previous experi
ence has taught that they will do their
best to buy off every one assisting the
prosecution. Do you feel equal to facing
all the opposition you are sure to meet
with, ladies?"
After some discussion it was finally re
solved to face the expense and make an
example of one of the Morton-street
] roperty-owuers. Further action was laid
over for one week and investigation was
referred to the committee for the suppres
fion of vice, with instructions to obtain a
full list of the Morton- street property
owners.
Miss Bates of the befriending committee
reported several harrowing cases of pov
erty discovered and relieved. One was of
a baby on Telegraph Hill, who was rapidly
growing hopelessly deformed for lack of
j tedical attendance and lit nourishment.
J ,ie mother, who was in a dying condi
bad been removed to the City and
v Hospital, and, through the good
offices of Dr. Amy G. Bowen, the baby was
taken into the Children's Hospital to be
fjperated upon. Miss Bates stated that a
Lome would be needed for the child in a
lew weeks. A vote of thanks was passed
to Dr. Bowen and also to the Catholic
li lies' Aid Society, which had promptly
relieved another case of great destitution
which the befriending committee had re-
Mrs. Rose French described the efforts
made by the lawyers for the defense to
keep the women "of the federation out of
the courtroom during the North Beach
trials, but she said that so far they had
proved unsuccessful. "If ever there was a
time in this City when women should
fitand up for women it is now, 1 ' she said. |
CHEAP BEER MOVEMENT.
It Is Probable That a Central Depot
Will Be Establighed.
Those who are at the head of the move
ment for cheap beer in opposition to the
combinaiion of brewers of this City are
still active and expect to be able to carry
their point. It is probable that within
two weeks there will be a central depot
from which about 2000 barrels or 60,000
gallons of beer will be delivered to those
who have arranged to take the amber
li<iuid from the opposition. It is expected
that in a few days all the arrangements
will be completed and as soon as they are
an announcement will be made. This will
be the arrangement for the beginning.

The Merchants' Association has received

on the evening of March 6 in Odd Fellows'

THE GRAND ARMY MUDDLE
Governor Budd and Commander
Wilson Are Asked to
Investigate.
No Commandant for the Veterans'
Home Will Be Chosen by the Di-
rectors at Present.
The directors of the Yountville Vete
rans' Home had a special meeting yester
day afternoon at 320 Sansome street ior the
purpose of electing a new commandant
for that institution. In view of the fact,
however, of the recent charges of Lyon
Post No. 8, G. A. R. of Oakland, against
the home directory the board who came to
vote remained to discuss.
It was the sense of all the members
present that while the charges were false
in every particular, malicious in character,
totally unworthy of notice, coining as tuey
did from a few jiersons moved by petty
personal spite, they must be met by an
investigation. The board could not co
into the work of choosing a commandant
for the home while it was under a cloud.
The new officer could wait while they at
tended to Lyon Post and its resolutions.
After a "lengthy discussion Director
Backus offered the following resolution:
/.'â -'.'ted, That the Governor of the State of
California be and is hereby requested to make
a complete investigation of all the acts of the
board of directors of the Veterans' Home
Association and the entire management of the
Veterans' Home.
This was unanimously adopted and a
copy ordered sent to the Governor with
the request that action be taken immedi
ately.
The following resolutions were also read
and unanimously adopted urging Depart
ment Commander Wilson to inquire into
the truth of the Lyon Post accusations:
Whereas, Lyon Post No. 8, Department of
California and Nevada, did at the meitintc
held February 18, isitts, adopt a series of reso
lutions specifying certain charges of derelic
tion of duty on the part of the members of the
board of directors; and whereas the board
invite and request the fullest investigation of
each aud every act connected with the man
agement of said home; therefore be it
Setolvld, That, the department commander
be and is hereby requested to mÂ»l:o r. complete
Investigation of all the acts of this board and
the management of the Veterans' Home at
Yoontville.
Resolved. That we request the d<?partmf>nt
commander, alter he tins completed Mid in
vestigation, to take such steps us he may deem
necessary, proper and just in connection with
the action taken by said Lyon l*ost.
"I am sorry all this discussion has been
made in the' public press," said Colonel
Currier yesterday, "and I do not care to
say anything, as it will only provoke
more debate. The Governor and depart
ment commander wiil fully settle the
question. It is deplorable that such
things should come up in the Grand
Army of the Republic â an order where
the spirit of loyalty, patriotism and fra
ternity should prevail. So we will let the
matter go over until the investigators
make their report."
"I see that Thompson of Oakland, late
commandant of the Veterans' Home,
comes bact at me," said Director Blinn.
""Well, I'll just quote Fitzsimmons in
reply and tell him to 'go and make a
record.' He is not in my clas3."
"There is nothing gained by keeping the
thing in discussion," said Director Rud
dickr"so the directory concluded to-day
that the wisest course was to call upon
tLe highest authority â the Governor and
department commanderâ to vindicate the
home and its management. As for the
charges, they really deserve no notice,
springing as they do from several persons
who have personal grievances against the
directors. It is strange that Thompson,
who was removed only a few weeks a^o,
did not make his complaint during the
year and a half lie was in charge of the
home. On July 1. 1895, he made his re
port highly complimenting the directory,
ending with the following paragraph :
" 'I congratulate the board of directors
on the excellent condition of the home and
the important work they have accom
plished the past year.'
"He did not mention the sewer that was
destroying the inhabitants of NapaCity
until lie was removed. Then he took
action by going to Judce Ham of Napa, a
member of the G. A. R., and asking him
to have the Grand Jury of that county
indict the directors of the home on the
sewer question. Comrade Ham refused to
do s<o, intimuting that the idea was both
childish and malicious."
Medical Director W. F. McAllister of the
home, who has been acting commandant
since Thompson's removal, will remain in
charge till his successor is appointed,
which will be after the coming investiga
tion.

THE MISSION BURGLARS
A Residence on Twentieth Street
Broken Into and Robbed
of Valuables.
Culmination of a Series of House-
Breakings â Jewelry and Plate
Stolen in the Night.
There was another burglary in the
Mission Saturday evening. Jewelry and
plate to the extent of over !|WJOO were stolen
by breaking into a residence. The case
was at once reported to the police, but as
far as could be ascertained yesterday the
only progress made by the department in
the matter has been to keep the news of
the robbery from the public ear.
Mr. and Mrs. Heines of 1013 Twentieth
street went to the theater Saturday even
ing, leaving no one in the house, but lock
ing it secuiely before they left. After the
theaU-r they stopped on their way homo
and did rot return until after 1 o'clock xn
the morning. To all outward appearances
the house was in the same order as when
its occupants left it. But when Mr. and
Mrs. Heines entered the dining-room on
the tirst floor there was a strange scene of
disorder before them.
Everything had been ransacked and
turned topsy turvy. The drawers of the
sideboa rd were on the floor and their con
tents scattered about the room. A hurried
examination showed that all the silver
ware was missing.
In the parlor there was less disorder, but
many of the costly trinkets and bric-a-brac
were pone. In the bedrooms the greatest
disorder prevailed. All the drawers had
been ransacked, the jewel-cases were
empty, two gold watches had been taken,
some diamond and jeweled rings and other
articles of jewelry.
When a summary haa been taken of
what was missing the aggregate amounted
to ever $600. Nothing of value that was
readiiy portable had been overlooked by
the miscreants. Evidently they had taken
their time and performed their thieving to
the best advantage to themselves.
An examination of the premises was
then made to find how the burglars ha 1
secured an entrance. Two back doors had
been rather adroitly broken open, ap
parently in such a way as to have been
attended with but little noise. This gave
the burglars access 10 the outer and inner
kitchen, the door leading from the kitchen
proper into the dining-room being locked
ana the Key turned on the dining-room
side.
To obviate this difficulty and gain ac
cess to the rest of the house, the burglars
haa carefully cut out the gloss in tiie tran
som over the door, then climbed over
and unlocked the door. After this it was I
an easy task to ransack the house. From
all the evidences there were two or more
burglars in the house at work, while a
third watched on the outside. It is
thought, too, from the thoroughness In
which the thieves did their work, that
they must have known the whereabouts
of its occupants and when they would re
curn home. They be^an their work early
in the evening, any time between 8 and 10
o'clock, and did not leave the premises
until they had satisfied themselves there
was no more plunder that could be safely
carried off.
Of course, Mr. Heines notified the police
at once and described most of the missing
property, but so far the Ruilty ones are
still at large â unless, perchance, the
police have them secreted in the City
Prison soniewhere, and are waiting for
further evidence against them.
Of Jate several house 3in the Mission
have been entered by burglars, but no
where has there been so much plunder
captured as the burglars took from 1018
Twentieth street.

FIRST GUN OF
REV D.M. ROSS.
He Takes Up in Public One
of the Four Disputed
Points.
THE CHURCH AND STATE.
Quotations Read From Ecclesi
astical Laws and Catholic
Authorities.
DEDUCTIONS OF THE SPEAKER.
Claims He Has Shown That the
Church Holds Itself Superior
to the State.
After three months of preparation the
preat controversy known as the Yorke-
Koss dispute formally opened in Metro
politan Temple last ni>;ht, and if the pro
gramme announced is carried out will
continue to-night and the two succeeding
evenings.
There are four propositions involved,
which Donald M. Ross, representing the
A. P. A., allirms, and which Peter C.
Yorke, representing the Catholic church,
denies. They are as follows:
Iâ '-The Roman church has the right to ex
ercise its authority witnout any limit set to it
by the civil powers."
llâ "The Pope and the priests ought to have
dominion over temporal affairs."
Illâ "The Koman' church and her ecclesias
tics have a right to immunity from civil law."
IVâ "ln ca.se of conflict between ecclesiasti
cal and civil powers, the ecclesiastical ought
to prevail."
These are alleged to have been included
in a lecture delivered by the Rev. Mr. Ross
which led to the issuing of the following
challenge by Rev. Peter C. Yorke:
San Francisco. November 27, 1895.
I will pay $100 in gold coin of the United
States to any charity named by Rev. Donald
M. Rose, if he can prove to the satisfaction of
three non-Catholic lawyers that the above
statements, or the substance of them, occur in
any Roman Catholic publication as statements
of Cathoho teaching.
On condition that if the Rev. Donald M.
Ross fails to prove these words, or the sub
stance of them, occur in any Roman catholic
publication a* statement of Catholic doctrine,
he shall pay the sum of $100 in United States
gold coin to a charity nanied by me. The arbi
trators shall be lawyers, non-Catholics, one to
be chosen by me, one by the Rev. Mr. Ross,
and the two to choose a third. The money to
be deposited with this thud lawyer, and to be
by him paid as the conditions require.
This challense was accepted by O-. A.
Hubbell, mapager and secretary of the
Patriot Publishing Company, Rev. Mr.
Ross having refused to make himself a
party to the bet.
Metropolitan Hall was fairly well filled
last night when U. A. Hubbell appeared
before the audience and spoke as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemenâ the 24th of No
vember. 1895, Donald M. Rom made a speech in
this great temple that received much place the
next morning in the treat daily newspapers of
San Francisco, and through that means that
speech has been read by many people of this
country.
Peter â¢'. Yorke saw fit to take exception to
four propositions in that speech and chal
lenged Donald >[. Ross to produce proofs and
show that his four propositions are sub
stantiated.
Donald M. Ross accepted the challenge, set
the day and place where he would produce his â â 
proofs. He is here, he has kept faith with the
public and will soon be on this platform. The '
judge, too. will in a few minutes be sitting on .
thi- platform.
The speaker then announced a vocal solo
by Jessie Brock Morgan. When the singer
bad concluded, Mr. Hubbell again ad
dressed the assemblage, Baying:
The first lawyer appointed upon this board
to decide upon the question in dispute was W.
W. Foote. As chairman of this meeting, 1 now
rail on him to come forward. This is Peter C.
Yorke's appointment w. \Y. Foote, please
come forward. Alter a pame) There being no
response, the chairman takes it upon himself
t.> appoint a bailiff to call for W. W. Foote,
Peter C. Vorke'a appointee.
Mr. liudd was appointed bailiff, but
soon returned and announced that no one
had replied to his call for Mr. Foote. Mr.
Hubbell then continued:
The second lawyer to be appointed according
1o the agreement Was numed by Mr. Boss ami
la Major K. A. Sherman. The chairman calls
lor Major Sherman.
Major Sherman appeared and was greeted
with loud cheers and applause, and on the
imitation of Chairman Hubbell, addressed
the audience. He spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Fellow-American Citizens:
When 1 was first selected as one of the judges
by Mr. Ross, be was a comparative stranger to
me, and the appointment was announced prob
ably before my consent had been obtained ; but
feeling it to be a matter of duty which I owed
to my country, 1 accepted and I am here.
The speaker then gave a personal his
tory of Mr. Foote, the appointee of Father
Yorke, and claimed that Mr. Foote should
have made an appointment with him in
order to select a third judge, but that he
had failed to do so. He then disclaimed
being a member of the American
Protective Association and he added
that that organization was not at all
responsible for anything that he might do
or say. He referred to the ban under
which the Masons had been placed by the
Catholic church authorities, and called
attention to the fact that Father Yorke
bad denounced him as the most conscience
less liar on the Pacific Coast. He added
that he would not endeavor to return the
compliment.
Major Sherman next recited facts of
which he claimed to have personal Knowl
edge tending to show, he said, that the
Ca;holics were in a measure responsible
for the murder of President Lincoln and
that the Catholic authorities were acces
sories to the murder after the fact.
He also related some of his personal ex
perience in the Mexican war. He alleged
that the Catholic United States soldiers of
the regular army were induced by the
priests to desen and to join the Mexicans,
and he related an instance in which
seventy of these deserters were captured
in a skirmish and thirty-two were hanged.
When Major Sherman concluded his
address an effort was made to select two
impartial judges from the audience, but
the plan proved impracticable. Major
Sherman explained that in court proceed
ings a court commissioner sometimes per
formed the duties of a court and suggested
that he be allowed to act as a commission
er in this affair. His offer was accepted
and he was duly sworn to act in that ca
pacity, justly and impartially.
The following is a copy of a letter that
was sent by Mr. Foote to Rev. Donald M.
Ross and which was referred to by the
latter in the course of his remarks:
San Francisco, Feb. 24, 1896.
DnnnldM. Rots, l>q.âl>F.\K Sir: Your note,
mandate, subpena or summons, whatever it
may be, (for I am at a loss to know how to
<l*r-'iKnate it), has this moment reached me (1
o'clock p. M., Monday).
When 1 was named by Father Y'orke to act as
one of the judges to decide the controversy
pending between yourselves as to the authen
ticity of certain statements made by you, and
nut as an arbitrator between Father
YorKe and yourself, as you seem to as
sume in your note, etc., it was with the
distinct understanding that there was to be no
public controversy, but merely a presentation
of proofs, at such time, place and under such
restrictions as the judges should determine.
You can well understand that having ac
cepted the place under those condi
tions, I firmly but respectfully decline
to attend the entertainment which you propose
to give on the 24th, 25th, 20th and 27th of
this month and that I will not act upon the
last portion of you mandate, which reads
as follows: "Do you as the representative of
the challenging 'party summon to a con
feronce Major Edwin A. Sherman of Oakland,
my representative, and a member of said
bo"ard or court, and with him choose and agree
upon a third lawyer to complete snid board or
court."
From the authority which, in your letter to
me, you claim over the whole proceeding 1
think you had best run the proposed show
yourself, with what assistance you can
personally command. And in order that
there may be no misunderstanding on the sub
ject I will hereby state that neither Father
Yorke nor myseli'expect any portion of the pro
ceeds, and we do not desire to be held for any
portion of the expends. I think I may safely
say this much for Father Yorke, although I
have neither seen nor communicated with him
since your second legal representative was
named.
The Rev. Donald M. Ross' appearance
on the platform was ureeted with hearty
and prolonged applause, and he spoke as
follows:
Ladies, Gentlemen, Friends: If I were to speak
to you to-night as I feel I would have only
words of bitterness, scorn and contempt, for I
feel only scorn and contempt for him who
would forget he has the responsibility of a gen
tleman and the assumed dignity of a priest,
who would call into existence a court of trial
of questions and then, after he had won his
way. and the one who had been challenged
had done everything that he could toward fa
cilitating the progress of the case, would come
out and declare that that was nothing but a
humbug. What a man can come to is clearly
shown in this matter.
He challenged me and he dared me to show
the proofs. I declared my readiness and sim
ply asked this: in the submission of my proofs
to the court that I might be allowed to tell
those proofs to my audience. Bat instead of
that, atter he had publicly challenged me, he
demanded that every word that I told should
be told behind closed doors. Why, my friends,
where is the justice of such a course as that?
1 declared my readiness to go on with the
proofs in open court. Mr. Hubbell, in accept
ing the bet, said to him that he took up the bet
provided the trial be in open court. Right
after that Mr. Hubbell wrote a letter, which
was dated the '.id of December, to Father
Yorke. Father Yorke'Â« reply was dated on
the sth of December. These words are in bis
letter of acceptance, "This proposition suits
me admirably."
Now, to-day, he comes forward in the press
and contends that he never spoke such a thing,
and in a letter sent to me by Mr. Foote in re
ply to one 1 sent him asking him to come for
ward to-uight, it is said thai he had agreed not
to have the discussion in public. From this I
can only assume that he lias been instructed by
Father Yorke not to have anything to do with
this meeting.
I tell you, my friends, I have no feeling for
him other than scorn and contempt. 1 feel
that 1 have accepted not the challenge of a
man, but of a pultroon. I feel as if 1 had ac
cepted the conditions of one who is beneath
anything that is honorable and manly.
How a man can face the public of San Fran
cisco after such conduct as his is to me some
thing beyond the possibility of understanding.
To-day he lias crawled back into his hole and
taken Mr. Foote with him. And this morning
the Archbishop forgot to get up, and says that
he is sick. Ido not wonder that he is sick. If
1 were one who would depend upon him for
bringing me out of a hole I would feel sick
myself, and the Human Catholics ought to feel
sick.
The only name that I have heard that ap
plies to him is one that I heard from a friend
of mine and one that was used for Father
Yorke when he was a ragamuffin in Ireland.
It is "shodderdegalion." It fits him.
Now, my friends, if you will permit me I
shall take the liDerty of proving before ihe
court whichever of these four propositions I
choose. I shall to-night make good the truth
vi the fourth proposition, which is:
"In case of conflict between ecclastical and
civil powers the ecclastical ought to prevail."
Father Yorke said I was a forger and a liar
when I told it, and then after calling me
everything that is vicious, when I tried to
justify myself, then he gave out that the court
was nothing to him and called It a humbug.
What is the use of doing any thing more with
a man like that without treating him in any
other way than you would the hark of a cur.
Let me just Bay this, that to-day they â for
Father Yorke is not alone, lie has united with
priest after priest, and tney, in their united
power, in their power of wealth, in their
power of organization, in their power of num
bers, in their power of threats â have compelled
the people to go abroad over this City to say
that there would be no meeting here to-night".
W nat he wanted to do and wnat he tried to do
is to tie my hands behind my back and then to
beat me.
IlÂ»- told me in the original challenge that I
could not make good mv position: that these
things were forgeries. Then, when I have
done everything j^jssible, they try to break
down the dignity of the effort I was making to
show that the statements that were made in
that paper were false. The shorthand notes of
the lecture in which it is claimed that I made
these statements that are involved in these
four propositions are in existence. 1 have
asked the reporter if these propositions were
stated by me, and he said that not one of them
was in my lecture. Ido not want to impugn
the honesty of any person in the San Francisco
Chronicle, bnt the next morning after my lec
ture there appeared in that paper a report in
which were thest four propositions, which I
declare I never tittered that day. They were
not uttered by me, and I never saw them uniil
1 saw them in Father Yorke's challenge. Ido
not blame the Chronicle, but they were put in
there by some one to give some a chance to
jump on me.
i-ather Yorke said I was correctly reported.
He was not there to hear me. How could he
say that unless he put those words in himself?
After repeating the fourth proposition
the Rev. Mr. Ross continued:
The Catholic church is to-day the most pow
erful organization on the face of the earth. It
knows no nationality, it knows no language.
And when the desire of that organization
runs contrary to any one country I claim thai
the cry oÂ£ the Catholic church is that the
church ought to prevail; but Father Yorke
says that the church ought not to win in such
a conflict. Now, in case Father Yorke and I
were to take our coats off and get into conflict
who ought to win according to Peter C. Yorke?
[â¢'You," shouted some one in the audience.]
In that case, however, the church declares
that he should win, and when a man denies
that he simply denies all of human reason and
judgment and all the lessons of logic, for the
church, I say, does teach that in the case of
conflict between ecclesiastical and civil pow
ers the ecclesiastical ought to win; but the
government says it ought to win. Now, I pro
pose to show simply this, from Roman Catholic
sources, their teachings, their doctrines, that
they ought to win in any conflict between the
church and the state.
There is one whose name has been and is an
an undoubted authority with the church. I
refer to Bronson. He says: ''The state is
therefore only an inferior court, bound to re
ceive the law from the supreme court (the
church), and liable to have its decisions re
versed on appeal."
Now, my friends, where there is a conflict
between a superior court and an inferior court
every one knows that the superior court must
carry. Bronson contends that the church is
the superior court and the state is the inferior
court and that the church has the right to
ignore the decisions of the state when they
differ from those of the church.
Another authority in the Catholic church is
the great Cardinal Manning of England.
Speaking of the laws of Germany under Bis
marck he said:
"And now the Berlin Government, it
is said, is about to attempt to im
pose on every Bishop the following
oath: The Bishops are henceforward
to swear obedience to the laws ot the country ;
to bind themselves by oath to exhort the
clergy and the laity; to be loyal to the Em
peror, patriotic and obedient to the laws, and
not to permit the clergy under their control to
teach or act in opposition to these principles."
Cardinal Manning says of the attitude of the
Berlin Government, "The cynicism of that
oatn is as clear as day." I s that in conllict as
between the church und the state? Cftrdinal
Manning, the authority of the church, says
that the oath ought not to be put to the
Bishops, but that they should be absolutely
free to do as they please.
Furthermore, I>ollinger, one of the greatest
scholars of the law of his time in Germany and
a Catholic true and great, says :
"Clement VII had already excommunicated
the king, Henry VIII of England, but in 1538
appeared a bull of his successor, Paul HI,
which excited universal astonishment. He
not only deposed the king and conrigned him
to eternal perdition if he did not appear before
his tribunal, but laid all Kngland under an
interdict. He forbade all divine worship and
administration of sacraments, he forbade
every Englishman to obey any royal com
mand, he deprived all the king's adherents of
their civil rights, abrogated all treaties made
with them and gave up the property of all
Englishmen to be plundered by foreigners."
That was the attitude of Pope Clement VII
when he differed with the Government of
Great Britain, yet I am told that I cannot find
in Catholic sources that in case of conflict be
tween the church and the state the church
ought to prevail.
Again Dollingersays:
'From the end of the thirteenth century and
constantly during the fourteenth England had
resisted the encroachments ana extortionate
demands of the Roman court."
Without comment on the foregoing the
speaker then quoted as follows from Pope
Tins IX:
"If the church should hesitate or give way be
fore an opposition of newspapers and of Gov
ernments its office as witness and teacher of
revelation would be shaken through the world.
'â¢The eneyelican 'Quanta Cura,' December 8,
1804, reminds the bishops that the principle
of naturalism in politics, wnich makts no ac
count of religion, in the regulation of civil so
ciety, is contrary to Catholic doctrine; the
modern idea that the best government is one
which treats true and false creeds alike, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
leaves to all men not only the complete liberty
of conscience and worship, |bnt t!ie|nnrestrieted
privilege of propagating whatever opinions
they please, is a dangerous error."
Then, again, we have in the ecclesiastical
laws of the church the following:
"If princes and their laws deviate from the
law oi <iod the church hns authority from God
to judge of that deviation and to oblige to its
correction. When a Christian world came into
existence the civil society of man became sub
ject to the spiritual direction of the church."
In whatsoever things, whether essentially or
by accident, the spiritual endâ and that is the
end of the church is necessarily involved â in
those things, though they be "temporal, the
church may by right exert, its power, and the
civil state ought to yield. The proposition is
proved (1) from reason {$). We next prove our
thesis from authority. We refer to the famous
bull I'nam Sanctum, issued by Pope Boniface
VIII in 1302. This bull declares there is hut one
true church, and therefore but one head of the
churchâ the Roman Pontiff; that there are
two swords, i. c.. the two powers, the spiritual
and the temporal, the latter must be subject
to the former. The bull finally wind* up with
this definition: "An-i this we" declare, affirm,
define p.nd pronounce that it is neeessajy for
the salvation of every human creature that he
should be subject to the Roman Pontiff." This
is undoubtedly an utterance ex cathedra.
Jn fact, the bull had for its object
to define dogmatically the relation of the
church to the state in general that is uni
versally. The Catholic interpretation of this
bull is that the church, and, therefore, the
Pope, has indirect authority over the state;
that, therefore, the state is subject to the
church in temporal things, so far aÂ« they re
late to eternal salvation or involve sin. Again,
it says the spiritual power (i. c. the churcj)
has to instruct and judgethe earthly power If
it be not good. It is, therefore, defined that
the church, and. therefore, the Pope, has in
direct power over the state and that conse
quently the state in temporal tilings that in
volve sin is subject to the Church.
And thus taking the sacred authority we can
prove our stand in two ways, by reason and
authority, and the authority quoted is the
church itself. In seeking for my authority I
have gone through a vast amount of matu-r
and not a statement could I tind in Catholic
literature that declares that the Government
is not subject to the church. The church de
clares, defines and pronounces that the church
is above the state and ttiat the state ought to
be subject to the church, and that when they
differ there is but one thing to do, that the
state come down and obey the church.
On the 9th of June, 1862. Pius IXdelivered
an allocution to 4000 priests and M~> cardinals.
He denounced the prevalent errors of the day,
errors In religion, errors in philosophy, errors
in politics. He censured the license" of the
anti-Christian press. He exhorteu the priests
to watch carefully over the training of the
young.
The Ciovernment of the United States says
that the press shall be forever free. The R*o
man Catholic church sayn that the press shall
not be forever free. There is but one position
of the church and the state to take, according
to this, and that is for the state to be governed
by the church.
Pope Pius said:
"If the church should hesitate or give way
before an opposition of newspapers and of
governments, its oflice as witness and teacher
of revelation would be shaken before the
world."
The constitution must suit the church or the
church will do to the constitution of the State
what Satolli did to it when he came to the
United States. He trampled on the constitu
tion and declared to the State what its duties
were. (Prolonged hisses). And he could not
speak it to tne American ]>eople without, a
translator.
Again I quote from Bronson's Review:
"The loss must be justorthevdo not bind;
and the fundamental constitution of a State
must be legitimate, for a measure is not justi
fiable simply because authorized by it or nec
essary to preserve it.
"Assuredly, then, we may aÂ«sume it as set
tled American conviction that the spiritual is
supreme and the temporal subordinate. Can
we suppose, then, that they are such poor
logicians as not to perceive that in case of
conflict between the two, the temporal not
the spiritual, politics not religion, the state
not the church must give way."
"Church property is, both by ecclesiastical
and divine right, exempt from the jurisdiction
of the civil government. Hence, laws enactedâ
y. g., by Legislatures from the United States
incapacitating church corporations from ac
quiring more than a certain specified amount
of property, are null and void."
The Jesuit knows no country, knows no
patriotism, knows nothing of nationality, of
loyalty, or anything but obedience to" his
church. This is from ecclesiastical law.
1 will now quote from Cardinal Manning In
support of my contentions. That eminent
Catholic authority says:
"The Catholic church is the highest and final
judge of what is the faith and what is the law
of God, and when science and politics come
into contact with the faith and the law it ad
mits of no appeal from its own decision to any
tribunal out of itself to any judge of appeal in
the past or in the future."
Again, from Bronson's Review the follow
ing is taken:
"At bottom, then, the question is simply a
question of the rights and prerogatives of the
spiritual order in the iace" of the temporal.
That order we have found to be by its
own nature independent and supreme.
Every Christian, every moralist, every
man does and must concede it, however by so
doing he may reflect on his own practice. If then
that order be represented on earth in its plent
itude by the Pope, he must necessarily be in
dependent and supreme in face of the represen
tatives of the temporal order, that is, in face of
the secular authority of the prince of the
state."
"In any question as to the competence of the
two powers," says Cardinal Manning, "either
there must be some judge to decide what does
and what does not fall within their respective
sphere or they are delivered over to perpetual
doubt and to perpetual conflict. It is clear that
the civil powers cannot detine how far the cir
cumference of faith and morals extend * â¢ *
But if tfte church be certain with a divine
certainty as to the limits of its jurisdiction its
voice in such matters is final. But an author
ity that can alone define the limits ol its own
office is absolute, because it depends on none,
and infallible because it knows with a divine
certainty the faith which it has received in
charge."
Manning again says:
"If then the civil power be not competent to
decide the limits of the spiritual power and if
thespiritual power can define with a divine cer
tainty its own limits it is evidently supreme.
Or, in other words, the spiritual power knows
with a divine certainty the limits of its own
jurisdiction, and it knows, therefore, its limits
and the competence and the limits of the
civil power. It is, thereby, in matters of reli
gion and conscience, supreme. The church,
therefore, is separate and supreme.
"It alone can decide in questions where its
power is in contact with the civil power."
And the ecclesiastical law declares:
"Civil laws derive all their lorce, so far as
they are applicable to ecclesiastical matters,
solely from the authority of the church."
L'pon the same point of the supremacy of the
church Bronbon's Review says:
"You may object to us on theological
grounds if you choose, but not on political

We do not advocate â far from it â the notion
thÃt the church must administer the civil
government. What we advocate is her
supremacy as teacher and guardian of the law
Of God, as the supreme court which must be
recognized and submitted to as such by the
state and whose decisions cannot be disre
garded, whose prerogatives cannot be abridged
or usurped by any power on earth without
rebellion against tiie divine majesty and rob
bing man of hi? rights. As Christians we must
insist on this supremacy, as Catholics it is not
only our duty but our glorious privilege to
assert it."
Do you wondci, my friends, that the Arch
bishop is sick in bed? [Applause.]
"If religion and the laws come in conflict,"
says Brownson, 'it is the laws that ar^ to be
reformed, not the religion that is to be sup
pressed."
If religion and the laws come into conflict
it is the laws not religion that is to be re
formed. Why, it Is like petting ready ior the

1 will now quote from "Religious Instruc
tion," a textbook of tbe Cntholic church and
approved by the Propaganda:
"By virtue of this divine institution tie
marriage of Christiana 19 a sacrament, ai.fl
will ever rempin so. Any matrimonial con
tract between Christians riot having the char
acter of a sacrament would not be a real mar
riage, nor even a valid contract. The purely
natural contract no longer exists, except
iiinong infidelsâ that is to say, the unbap
tized.
"(1) Marriage consists essentially in a con
tract formed between two persons, and is
called the contract ol marriage; (2) what is
commonly called civil marriage differs essen
tially from the ecclesiastical marriage, which
alone is real marriage, the former having
nothing but a name.
â 'Civil marriage is a simple legal formality by
virtue of which the aflianced are considered as
man and wife in the eyes of the law, and they
enjoy the rights which the law accords to
married perooife and their legitimate children.
This purely nominal marriage in no way con
stitutes the aflianced man ana wife before God,
and if they did not also contract the ecclesias
tical marriace their living together would be
a sin."â Religious Instruction, pages 22t>-7.
"Matrimonial onion once consummated is
indissoluble, and only ceases with the death
of one of the two parties. No human power
can break the sacred engagement of marriage
that a fresh union may be contracted. What
is called civil divorce leaves the matrimonial
tie in full force, and while the two persons are
alive a new marriage is impossible. If at
tempted it would only be a detestable adul
tery.'âReligious Instruction, page 228.
"A marriage contracted solely before the
civil authorities is not a real one in the eyes of
God and the church. Such pretended union,
called a civil marriage, is nothing but a
shameful concubinage in the sight of God.
Marriage with Jews or infidels is null and
void." â Religions Instruction, page 378.
"That what is called the Inquisition con
sisted of a court of justice, which was at the
same time ecclesiastical and civil. It was es
tablished to take cognizance of the crime of
heresy and to punish the guilty. The tribunal
of the Inquisition was called the 'Holy Office.'
About the year 1200 it wa* instituted by Pope
Innocence 111, in order to repress the Albi
gen*es and the Vandois. As these sects
spread together with their errors a spirit
of rebellion against the two authorities, in
struction and persuasion were at lirst tried, in
order to reclaim them to a sense of duty, but
when these means were found to be ineffectual,
the ecclesiastical and civil powers being
equally menaced, united against the common
enemy: the former lent its authority to dis
cover crime, and the latter to punish it. Hence
the origin of the inquisition.â Religious In
struction, p. 7. r >-0.
In dealing with the Emperors of Germany
the Popes have been more authoritative than
with other sovereign?, but it was because these
princes were exceptionally situated. In re
suscitating the Empire of the East the
Papacy had established a Christian empire,
subject in temporal matters to an
elective chief. The election was accompanied
by a solemn promise to observe the ruies
of a certain constitution, the neglect of which
should deprive the elected of his rights. The
Poi>e of necessity became his judge in this,
and he alone could decide as to his shortcom
iugs; and thus it happened that in passing
judgment upon such a chief the Pope released
his subjects from their oath of allegiance. The
deposition which followed was a legitimate
consequenoo of the Germanic .constitution. â
Religious Instruction, p. 98.
If the state is bound to defend the property
of the citizen from robbery and his life from
ageressors from within and without, it is
equally bound, according to the measure of a
moral possibility, to protect that which is in
finitely more precious, his intellectual and
moral welfare, from error and corruption ; that
is to say, tlie state must protect the true prin
ciples of order and true religious and moral
doctrines, and it must defend them from the
public scandals of the press, of false teaching,
of the theater and of all pernicious societies.
âReligious Instruction, p. 101.
The sentences which the secular power pro
nounces in the cases which concern the es
sence and properties of marriage decide noth
ing; nenoe should it meet with any of the
faithful so forgetful of their baptism as to be
satisfied with the prohibitions, the consent
and the judgments of the secular power, what
ever consideration they may enjoy among
men they shall not escape the opprobrium of
hearing themselvef called before ttie tribunal
of God fornicators and adulterors. â Mar
riage 99.
The speaker then cites the following as
authorities for his contention:
The Pope in the syllabus (Prop. 80) condemns
those who say that the Roman Pontiff may and
ought to "recor. cile himself and come to
terms With progress, liberalism and mod
ern civilization. This is undoubtedly
true; for this so-called modern civiliza
tion is not a genuine but a sham pagan
civilization, which insists on material im
provement, and advocates the superiority of
the temporal over the spiritual orderâ nay, de
stroys the letter altogether. The Pope can
never sanction this; were he to do so the
church would cease to be the teacher of man
kind. In upholding, as the Pope is bound to
do, independence and supremacy of the
spiritual order, he is a stanch advocate of true
liberty.â Jouin 303.
Now it is evident that the church insti
tuted by Christ is a society complete and inde
pendent.beeauseithasbeen formed by God him
self, from whom it received its own authority,
aud to this authority alone does it belong to
prescribe the means by which, in ac
cordance with the law given by Christ, its
end is to be attained. No civil power whatever
has a right to interfere with the legislation
and government of the church; because on the
one hand the commission to teach was not
conferred by Christ on kings, princes or magis
trates, but on the apostles and their successors.
On the other hand, the church being Catholic,
her power extends over the whole world, while
the jurisdiction of a State is confined to the
limits of that State.â Jouin. pp. 32-4 and 325.
The church, being a society instituted by
God with the object of leading mankind to sal
vation, must in all things belonging to her be
independent of civil society, as we stated
above. No law of any State, framed in opposi
tion with her teaching, can be binding on the
conscience of man ; because such a law is op
posed to the law of God, and we must obey God
rather than man.â Jouin, p. 363.
When in doubtful cases a collision of rights
might arise, it is evident that, to preserve the
union between the two powers, the state must
yield to the church, since she is the higher
power, and she alone is competent to deter
mine tiie limits of her own jurisdiction.â Jouin
p. 365.
The exercise of the deposing power argues
do undue Interference of the lopes with tem
poral rulers. By consulting his'ory we tind
this power was used only in the case of Princes
abusing their authority and tramping under
foot all laws, human and divine, and by this
very act of deposition, acknowledged, more
over, aud acquiesced in by all Chris
tendom, the Popes showed themselves
the most strenuous supporters of the legiti
mate rights of the people. This power
was never claimed either by Popes or any
other Catholics as an arbitrary power which
could be exercised at will. No temporal ruler
could be interfered with so long as he did not
deviate from the laws of right and justice.
Nor did the Popes exercise this right directly.
It was rather an arbitration, tne pronouncing
of a judicial sentence, which declared that,
since the temporal ruler had evidently proved
unfaithful to his coronation oath, the "people
on their part were absolved from their oath of
allegiance. â Jouin, p. 3Cti-7.
To assert that persons are legitimately mar
ried by a magistrate without the concurrence
of the sprited power is an error, against which
the church protests with all the strength of
the sovereign power over the very substance of
marriage which God has conferred upon her.

INDEX.
"Pretensions of the secular power to reply to
the demands of the adversaries of the divine
I law it desires that marriage should be the con
j certi of the State before being the concern of
i religion and any church; it desires that the
laws and regulations of religious society
should bend before the laws and regula
tions of the State. Against this pretension of
the secular power It is established that the
legislation on marriage, as to its essence and
its essential properties, belongs to God alone
and his church." â Marriage, 227.
Pius IX in an allocution September 27, 1852:
"Inter iideles matrimouium dari non posse
quin uno cdodemque tempore sit sacra-
I im-nlum."
"Among the faithful there can be no mar
riage, unless there be at one and the same time
a sacrament.' IâMarriage1 â Marriage 205.
"In marriages contracted before the civil
authorities, where the decree of the Council at
Trent has been promulgated, there is no con
tract; modern governments regard them as
legitimate unions, to which they grant all
civil effect, but they are in reality shameful
and sad concubinage."â Marriage 207.
"Marriage is a sacred engagement, over
which the civil law has no hold and which it
cannot invalidate."â Marriage, 102.
"The essence, the intrinsic properties, the tie
of marriage, transformed and elevated by
Christians, are sacred things, which can only
spring from a sacred authority. This authority,
you have framed it, it is the church."âMar
riage, 103.
"The church," says Pius IX, "is a real and
perfect society, entirely free, enjoying the dis
tinctive perpetual rights which were con
ferred upon it by its Divine Founder."â Rev-
Father F. X. Schouppe, of the Society of Jesus,
page 50.
"The power of the church differs from tne
civil power, which, being purely human and
resting on natural rights, is founded on the
natural order established by the Creator. The
power of the church is supernatural in its
origin, and divine by positive right, as it was
divinely established oy the Redeemer. Since
the power of the church is divine, it follows:
(1) That it is of an order whicn is superior to
all human power; (8) that it is distinct from,
though not opposed to, civil authority, of
which it is> entirely independent. Such is* the
harmony which, according to the viewsof God,
should reign between the two powers; and
it is a grevious and condemned error to say
the the church should be subject to the secu
lar, or that the church should be separated
lrom the state and the state from the church.
"The mutual relations of the two powers isuo
obstacle to their reciprocal independence.
Each in its own sphere is sovereign and inde
pendent, excepting, however, the subordina
tion which results from the nature of things
and the end proper to each of the two powers.
As the body is subject to the soul and the
temporal to the spiritual welfare of
man so the civil power is subject
to the religious power in the sense
that those who are invested with the civil
power are bound to exercise it according to
the principles and in the interest of the true
reiigion of Jesus Christ. Governments are
bound to protect the church and her worship,
her goods and her ministers, and every law or
act of civil administration which is opposed to
the dlcipline or the lights of the churcn is an
abuse of power and an injustice before God." â
Father F. X. Schouupe on "Religious Instruc
tion," p. 04 and G5.
"The power of kings," said Pius IX, repeat
ing the words of Pope St. Innocent and St.
Felix, "was instituted not only for the govern
ment of the world but for the assistance of the
church, and nothing is more glorious or more
advantageous to a prince than to leave the
Catholic church in possession of her own
rights, and lo allow none to interfere with her
liberty. By virtue of her power of the minis
try, the church administers all the sacraments,
not excepting marriage, of which she is sole
judge, with full power to create invalidating
impediments or to dispense with them. By the
same faculty she grants indulgence, institutes
feasts, regulates the ceremonies of the holy
sacrifice and all that constitutes public wor
ship."âReligious Instruction, page (30.
"What must be thought of civil tolerance
from the point of view oi right? In principle
absolute civil tolerance is bad and unjust, and
contrary to both natural and divine right.
Though the state possesses no authority in
religious matters, it i.s none the less obliged to
further interests of religion, as being a power
Charged to protect order and morality.
"When a country is in possession of the truth
âthat is to say, when it is Catholicâ the laws
also must be Catholic and tend to the defense
of truth "
His Holiness, Pius IX, in his address July 30,
1871, said: "Among all other errors, that is
malicious above all which would at
tribute (to the infallibility of the Pope)
the right of deposing sovereigns, and of
absolving people from the obligation ef allegi
ance. This right, without doubt, has been
exercised by the Supreme Pontiffs from, time to
time in extreme cases, but it has nothing to do
with the pontifical infallibility; neitherdoes
it flow from the infallibility, but from the
authority of the Pontiff .''â Jouin, page 3CB.
"Marriage has always been considered as
something sacred; it is only modern infidelity
which looks upon it as a mere civil contract.
The Catholic church teaches that it is a sacra
ment: hence the laws of marriage cannot be
interfered with by the state. Since it Is of
great importance to the state that the citizens
be well educated according to their different
conditions of life, it has a right to promote
education; but it cannot arrogate the right of
education, because it does not possess the gift
of infallibility." â Jouin, page 373.
"It follows, therefore, that the State has no
ripht to impose taxes in support of common
schools, from which all rtligious training is
banished. Were citizens to show negligence
or unwillingness to support their own schools,
the state might, perhaps, order a tax for the
maintenance of schools: but in this case it
would be bound to distribute such funds pro
rata to the different religious denominations
for the keeping up of denominational schools.
These (godless schools are advocated on the
ground that, in a country where a mixture of
religious creeds exists, all religious teaching
must necessarily be excluded from common
schools supported by the state. But this ex
cuse is merely another proof that, in this mat
ter, the state has neither power nor aptitude
to legislate."â Jouin, pages 374-75.
"The state, therefore, must be subordinate to
the church and accept from her the principles
of divine law, that it may be enabled to frame
its own laws in accordance with those of God.
To state that the state is entirely independent
of the church is tantamount to holding that it
is independent of God, and need not be subject
to his law." â Jouin, pages 378-79.
Tertullian in his book, '"Ad uxorem," again
says: "Ideo penes nos occultas quoque con
junctiones hoc est non prius abud ecclesiam,
professa juxta mrechiam et fornicationem
judicari periclitantur." "There are among
us unions which are not made before the
church, and they run the risk of being called
adultery and fornication."â Marriage, 178.
Tertullian in his book, "Aa uxorem," recom
mends the faithtul to receive the nuptial bene
diction so as to remove all suspicion of fornica
tion and concubinage, which rests upon those
who marry privately." â Marriage, 173.
Canon 7, Council of Trent, session 24, reads
as follows: "If any one says that the church
has been and is in error when she has taught
and teaches â¢ Â» â¢ that the tie of marriage
cannot be broken by the adultery of husband
or wife; that a married person, even innocent,
cannot during the lifetime of the partner con
tract a new marriage, * * * let him be ana
thema."âMarriage, 200.
"We have established the legislative power
of the church on these two principles: First,
that marriage, in its essence, is a sacred thing,
belonging to the forum internum, over which,
consequently, the civil power has no right.
Second, that in Christian marriage the con
tract is inseparable from the saorament, which
places the conjugal union In the hands of the
church, the sole dispenser of things .sacred."
Marriage, 211.
"The secular power has no right over what
is given in marriage." Marriage being chiefly â¢
a sacred thing the civil power can have no au
thority over its essence and its fundamental
properties, "incompetency of the civil power
is still more manifest if we consider that mar
riage is a sacrament."â Marriage, 228.
"Peter C. Yorfce iv the Monitor said edi
torially of Mrs. Slattery that she was Slattery's
substitute fora wife."â Monitor.
"She binds, she looses the contracting wills.
Their consent cannot unite them if she pre
vents it. There are no further obstacles tne
moment she shall speak. Where the tie is
doubtful she alone has tne right to pronounce
on its validity. If she decides that all is done
well, they must remain united. They are free
if she says It Is ill done." â Marriage, 104.
"Canon 17 of the Council of Trent, session
24, 'Si guis dixerit ecclesiam non potulsse

them, let him be anathema."â Marriage, 105.
"Tne church of her own authorityâ tnat is
to say, Independently of any civil power or

she received from the Divine Founder â can en

"The church respects the civil laws and even
enforces them whenever they are not in opposi
tion to those of God and of her own; but in
case of auy opposition between the laws of the
church and those of the prince or the states,

validity or invalidity of the marriage contract

tor weighty reasons ecclesiastical authority
sometimes allows the parties to separate, and
not to live together; but the marriape always
subsist before God and the church, even when
the civil authorities grant a divorce accord
ing to the law. To marry again after separa
tion, and live together in that way, is to live
in a state of perpetual sin.

Catholic Education â A lecture delivered in
St. Peter's Church, Barclay street, New York,
on Thursday evening-, May 23, 1872, by Father
Burke. He says: "The Catholic church insist,
in the teeth of the work! ana in
spite of the world's pride and ignorance
and bloated self-sufficiencyâ the Catholic
church insists, as she has Insisted for eighteen
hundred and seventy-two years, on saying: 'I
know how to teach; you" don't. You must
come to me; you cannot live withont me
Don't imagine you can live by yourselves, or
yo a will fall back into the slough of your own
iniDurity and corruption.' "
The world does not like to hear this. The
Catholic church insists that she alone under
stands what education means; the world does
not like to hear that. But I came here to-nieht
to prove it.
The speaker continues:
There is more to read to you from the publi
cations of the Catnolic churchâ of the church
that claims to be of Jesus Christ; that claims
to be infallibleâ quotations most appalling
showing the murder of St. Bartholomew and
other terrible crimes for which Rome isdirectlv

fluence and taken a new lease of life.
How this spirit of progress started is not
known. Foremost in the lead are the
building trades. Six months ago several
unions of this craft could hardly secure
a quorum at their meetings. Now their
halls are crowded on every meeting night
and the membership rolls have run up
from a few dozen to many thousand and
every day brines new members into the
organization.
A prominent trades- union man haa
summed up the situation in this way:
For years the unions have struggled along
endeavorinz to better the condition of their
members, but to no purpose, for they have
not won a single important victory in
standing for what they considered to be
their rights. The reason for this is they
nave not stood together as unions, byt
each stood selfishly for itself. The work
ingmen have at last recognized this fact
and now they are convinced that in united
unionism is their only hope for relief and
that new tactics must be pursued in order
to accomplish anything.
This is manifest by the fact that there is
a general movement toward entering pol
itics, not on the old party lines, but in the
formation of a workingmans' party, lo
this end is the labor convention working,
supported by the entire strength of the
buiiding trades, the socialist element of
the community and with a prospect of the
support of all the other organizations of
workingmen.
This and kindred subjects were discussed
last evening at the opon meeting of the
painters and decorators at Washington
Hall. The large hall was filled to the
doors, and a number of stirring addresses
were delivered by James Andrews. R. T.
Mclvor, P. Rom Martin, James Rose and
others. In speaking of the differences
with the boss painters Mclvor said
that there is every prospect of
the difficulty being "settled without
the necessity of resorting to drastic
measures. March 1 was set as the date
when the painters and decorators would
demand better wages, shorter hours ana a
recognition of the working-card system.
He said that the largest and most respon
sible painters are in favor of acceeding to
the demands of the journeymen, but that
a formal reply to the lattcr's open letter
cannot be obtained until March 5, as the
master painters will not wait until the
4th. Those who accecd to the demand
will be liberally supported, but those who
hold out will lie fought to the bitter end.
Should all tne master painters think
unfavorably of the proposition then tne
journeymen will secure stock materials,
form companies and go into business on
their own account and make contracts for
painting at such low rates that no out
side contractor can make a living.
Martin cave the painters a few cold facts
that made them do a little thinking. He
| said that in the United States there are
3,500,0130 idle people ready to do anything
to keep from starving. The boss painters
km. w they could secure plenty of woric-
I men and this knowledge had made them
! confident of success when dictating the
terms to unorganized or poorly organized
I laborers. The latter by standing shonlder
to shonlder could secure 'heir rights aud
in no other way.
Besides the addresses there were a num
ber of songs and recitations for the enter
tainment of the audience. Hereafter theÂ»*
I open meetings and entertainments will be

i leaving on next Saturday. Johnson has
held the position of walking deleerate for
several terms and was well liked by the
carpenters. His plate will be tempofarily

Shortcomings.
MISS OVERMAN'S SPOKANE LIFE.
She Bitterly Resents the Accusation
That She Ran Away With Her
Sister's Husband.
The ecclesiastical council called to pass
on sundry charges, embracing immorality,
unministerial conduct and intimidation,
now resting against Dr. Charles O. Brown

to-day. From present indications the pro
ceedings will be enlivened by racy testi
mony, in which the paste â¢ and Miss Over
man will be made to appear as the central
figures.
The committee on charges, together with
Judge Advocate Woodhams, yesterday
held a session which lasted three hours,
and during that time all manner of grave
accusations were laid at the door of Dr.
Hrown. (ome of these charges were mere
M which faded into a rumor when
Tricked. Others proved io have some

Harry Mason was amonir those who ap

clares that the pastor was guilty of in
timidation in the case of a prominent
yoonje lady member of his church. .Mr.
Mason says the young lady had oecome
convinced of the pastor s guilt, and did
not hesitate to so express herself. This so
angered the reverend gentleman that he
immediately sought ; the lady in question,
and accusing her of an immoral act, de
cared he would give it to the public if she
did not immediately come over to his side.

"The incident mentioned by .Mason hap

that time. 'When, however, the" young

her house, and in the presence of the eiiTs

MISS SHAW NOT BLAMED.
Hester A. Harlaiul Does Not Wish to
Be a Public Censor.
Hester A. Harland sends the following
communication, which refers to the recent
difficulty in the ranks of woman suf
fragists:
To the Editor: Rather than appear in a false
lignt to your many readers interested in suf
frage matters and to my many friends in the
suffrage ranks who might otherwise misappre
heua my attitude, I feel compelled to make
the following statement.
I am the more urged to do this because there
have been published recently in tne news
papers portions of asocial conversation in no
sense intended for publication, and remarks of
others attributed to me. reflecting upoji the
management of the woman's suffrage move
ment in California.
I regret the publication of these remarks
because, as having been a salaried employe of
the committee (as State organizer) and mana
ger of the lecture tour of Rev. Anna 11. Shaw,
I was unwilling to appear as a public censor of
the movement.
My statements regarding Miss Shaw (not in
tended for the public) \fere qualified by the
further remark mat she was not to be blamed
for making a pood bargain. I did, however,
rind fault with the policy which should allow
the association to De so strapped of funds
(though she helped to raise them) as to cripple
other important work.
I question if the value of Miss Shaw's lecture
tour through this State can be rightly esti
mated. It has been unqualifiedly the best ed
ucational feature of the entire campaign.
At no time have I used the expression
"BoÂ« rule" in convection with Mrs. or Miss
Cooper or any other person. My exceptions
were taken entirely with tlie policy and not
witn persons.
Knowing that probably two-thirds of the pa
pers in the State would publish suffrage-liter
ature I urged having our campaign carried on
almost exclusively through the press, that
pertinent and interesting information on suf
(rage might rind its way into even the re
motest and humblest homes everywhere in
California. As to the efficacy of other suffrage
literature (too frequently consigned to the
waste-basket without a reading). I hnrt little
faith, nor in public meetings, where suffragists
talk to suffragists, aud few or no comments
are made
Hence, in onr press committee lay our best
opportunity for effective work; in" its inac
tivity lay a fatal error. Of this committee
Mrs. Cooper wad chairman.
Time was too limited to allow of successful
organization in fifty-seven counties.
It was my intention to urge iormation of
clubs in each Congressional district, appoint
sub-organizers for the counties and secure as
sistance of tiood workers when available.
My only attempt to secure such assistance
waj the cause of an open rupture between Miss
Cooper and myself, 1 resenting an interference
where clearly Â«he had no authority whatever.
Further, I do not wish to criticize persons or
mi thodfl in connection with suffrage work, and
will simply pay, in conclusion, that had a dif
ferent jio'.iey been followed Miss bhaw would
have been afforded a much larger fiel.l, her
eloquence would have been heard throughout
the ,-tate, and in conjunction with the all-pow
erful voice of the press, have brought to the
enthusiastic support ot our movement the com
mon-sense of the community, irrespective of
creed or political aflihsuio'n. .Respectfully
Hkster A. Harland.

REV.BAKER ON ROMANISM
Methodist Pastors Listen to an
Arraignment of the Cath
olic Church.
Resolutions Are Passed Condeming
Rev. Mr. F. Colburn's Re
cent Arrest.
"Shall Popery or Americanism domi
nate America?"' was the subject of a paper
read yesterday by Rev. P. L. Baker before
the Methodist preachers' meeting. The
speaker said: "Any one at all conversant
with the times realizes America is rapidly
becoming America's worst enemy. It has
been a weakness of the American people
not to be abie to say 'no' during the last
generation or more. The result has been
the creeping in of many National foes into
our land, while we have slumbered and
slept and dreamed sweet dreams.
"There is a great foe among us that is
seeking to pervert and destroy our Nation
al principles. I refer to the Roman hier
archy, which like the fabled vampire has
been fanning the American people to sleep
under its broad wings, while at every
breath it has been drawing vitality from
their National life. While we have been
doing the counting and saying 'peace,'
the enemy has been throwing, not stones,
but balls at us and anathematizing our
I uuiic schools and other National institu
tions, and running away with the Govern
ment, so that it has become not a very
easy task to cope with it."
The speaker gave a number of statistics
with regard to the wealth and numbers of
the Roman Catholic church. He stated
that the hierarchy had plainly shown its
desire to pilot the American ship of state,
and he added :
"The Pope has a fine military organ
ization in America. Oswald Keatings,
L.L.D., says: 'The secret societies directly
under Jesuit control are combined under
the name of the United States volunteer
militia, and number 70,000 men, all well
armed, well drilled and absolutely obedi
ent.' "
The speaker urged his hearers to be able
to say "No." and to wake up to the state
of things around them. He auvocated ex
pulsion of the Jesuits and refusing admis
sion to all foreign emigration that would
not become a loyal element in the coun-
try.
Mr. Baker concluded by urging his hear
ers to join the American Protective Asso
ciation.
Rev. M. C. Harris started the discussion
by stating that while he was in favor of
anything that tended to increase Ameri
can patriotism he did believe that Roman
Catholics had proved themselves to be
anything but loyal citizens. The general
trend of the discussion was very much
along the lines stated by Dr. Harris.
Presbyterian Ministers.
Some hints on the management of
church work from a layman's standpoint
were give the Presbyterian Ministerial As
sociation yesterday morning by Elder Ed
dward J. Hanks of New York. The
speaker gave suggestions to pastors upon
how to bring the lost, stolen or strayed
members of the Hock back into the fold,
and especially urged interesting young
people in the work of the church. Mr.
Hank? expressed strong commendation
for confirmation classes as they exist in
the Episcopalian church and suggested
that Presbyterian churches should adopt
classes to some extent on the same lines.
In the discussion general appreciation
was expressed ior Mr. Hanks' paper.

THE SA3T FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
THAT CUSTOM
HOUSE SCANDAL.
Cleary Will Not Be Inves
tigated by the Grand
Jury.
A CHANGE OF FRONT.
The Case Will Now Come Up
Before the United States
Commissioner.
THE WILLIAMS INVESTIGATION
Only Two Witnesses Examined and
Their Evidence Was Not Strong
Against the Accused.
The belief is general about the Federal
building that the charges of bribery against
Customs Inspector Martin Cleary will not
be prosecuted before the United States
Grand Jury, but will be referred bacK to
United States Commissioner Heacockfor
examination.
This is one of the several cases growing
out of the Custom-house scandal, and
w.uich have been prominently before the
public of late. Cleary was arrested on a
complaint sworn out by Special Agent
Moore of the Treasury Department. The
allegation was to the effect that Cleary
had received $100 for his services in the
unlawful landing of a Chinese girl. Im
mediately the friends of the accused ral
lied to his support, as the arrest was con
sidered a side issue to the light that has
been going on for some time between Col
lector of the Port Wise and Special Agent
Moore.
The followers of the Collector held that
the charges were trumped up against the
Inspector by the Special Agent because of
the latter's well-known antipathy toward
the former. The case came up before the
United States Commissioner, and at the
request of the United States District At
torney was discontinued, since he had
decided to bring the matter before the
United States Grand Jury for investiga
tion. This action was taken over the pro
test of W. W. Foote, the eminent attorney
and brother to the District Attorney. The
latter feared that if the Grand Jury failed
to indict Cleary he would be held respon
sible and collusion with his distinguished
brother might be hinted at, and he trans
ferred the responsibility of the prosecu
tion on the shoulders of Assistant District
Attorney Knight. Now, it is a well-estab-
lished fact that Mr. Knight does not look
after the criminal end of the District At
torney's office. His duties are in the line
of civil investigation. Therefore his selec
tion as the prosecutor in this particular
case came somewhat as a surprise to the
knowing ones.
Knight found that the special agent had
made a poor representation before the
Grand Jury on Saturday, and in order to
keep his skirts clear he concluded that an
open trial before the Commissioner was
the proper caper, and accordingly be
recommended that course. It is now
stated that the case will come up before
Commissioner Heacock on Thursday.
The investigation into the conduct of
Customs Interpreter Williams was contin
ued before Collector of Customs Wise yes
terday. It was a very tame proceedinc, as
only a few witnesses were examined, and
they had forgotten about, all they ever
knew. Their evidence was all hearsay.
They had been told that Williams had re
ceived bribes, but did not know of it of
their own knowledge.
Collector Wise still believes in the inno
cence of Williams. He will stand by the
inspector until more substantial and con
vincing evidence has been advanced. Sev
eral of the witnesses furnished by the
special agent have virtually been in favor
of Williams, but whether or not the ac
cused will be ultimately able to clear him
self is a question that the future alone can
determine.
AT THE CITY THEATERS.
Frederic!: Warde Welcomed
Back to the Baldwin in
" The Mountebank."
Remarkable Scenic Effects in " The
Pulse of New York" at the Grand
Opera-House.
Frederick Warde and his company were
welcomed back to the Baldwin Theater
last night by a number of the actor's ad
mirers.
The play was D'Ennery's romantic
drama, "The Mountebank," which
Warde has added to his repertory this sea
son. Though slightly improbable in some
places, the play is stiil a very effective one
and affords opportunities to the leading
characters for the exhibition of a vast
amount of feeling ana sentiment.
Warde in the title role showed that he had
given carelul and conscientious study to
his interpretation of the strolling player.
The lighter scences were excellently acted.
In the second act, and especially when the
mountebank remembers that his wife is
wearing a poor little shawl no bigger than
his handkerchief, the sudden conviction and
resolve to lavish ah his savings of fifteen
years on her were very charmingly acted.
The same may be said, indeed, of all the
scenes where Warda had not to call upon
the deeper emotions.
But when it came to portraying the
despair of the deserted husband* and the
agony of the mummer forced to laugh
I and amuse the gay crowd when his heart
I is breaking, then Warde showed that he
j had studied "The Mountebank" on lines
that are rapidly being relegated to the
past, along with the Vincent Crummels.
stage stride and other relics of the days
when audiences expected an emotional
actor to tear a passion to tatters.
Duse, Irving, Mansfield and other great
players of to-day have taught such a les
son of the value of naturalness, of the tell
ing quality of the emotion that is sug
gested rather than ranted, that the stage
is becoming more and more a reflex of
how men and women would actually act
under similar circumstances in real life.
Mr. Warde's ability in the role of the
strolling player last night was unques
tionable, but it Is hard to imagine that
any sane man would rant and rave to the
extent to which he did, on hearing even of
the loss of a beloved wife.
It was the same in the scene where mum
mer acts for bread for his starving child,
no one would deny that the Warde acting
was effective, but it became strained aud
overdone, and thereby lost the ring of pa
thos and humanity that lies in the touch
ing contrast between the careless crowd of
revelers and the mummer's breaking heart.
Guillu last week was singing the identical
words in "I Pagliacci" â "I laugh, but my
heart is breaking" (Ride PagHaccio)â but
Guillewas more modern iv his act than
Frederick Warde.
Apart from his tendency to staginess
and exaggeration, however, Warde gave
an effective interpretation of his role. He
received good support from his company.
Miss Lucia Moore was very good as the
child Henri, and H. D. Byers, Ernest C.
Wards, Landers Stevens, Charles D. Her
man and Charles H. Clarke were all thor
oughly at home in their roles. Miss
Fanny Gillette made a good impression as
Madeline, though the pathos was a little
too heavy for her. The other female char
acters were in good hands. â¢'The Mounte
bank" was excellently staged and co3
tuiued.
G-rover's Alcazar.
A very warm reception was given to the Carl
ton Opera Company last night in Sir Julius
Benedict's "Lily of Killaniey." It was the
opening night, and judging from the applause
and encores the company was eminently pleas
ing to the patrons of the theater.
The Carleton Company is an opera comique
orgunization. It iloe.s not attempt to Jo any.
thing on a "big" scale but its orchestra,
though small, was efficient; its chorus was
composed of fresh young voices that though
they would stand a little more drilling did
good work last night, and the principals, for
the most part, were artists thoroughly well
suited to the class ol operas the company pre
sents.
Miss Rena Atkinson, the prima donna nsso
luta of the company, fang, of course, the role
oi Eily O'Connor, siie proved to be the pos
sessor of a beautiful, well-trained voice. Her
singing showed a little too much tendency to
ward vibrato and the lower register was
searcel}' strong enough to counterbal
ance the powerful higher tones, but
Miss Atkinson was artist, enough to eschew
all vcntriloquel lower tones; her voice was
sweet and easy, as well as very ringing, and
she sang artistically. Phe looked pretty and
coquettish as Eily, though she did not act
with any remnrkuble fervor. The impression
the prima donna left on her audience wus a
highly favorable one.
Jay C. Taylor, as Hardrefs Creegan, wag one
of the most applauded of the singers. Ho pos
sesses a light, high tenor voice, which he uses
effectively, and his arias were almost con
stantly encored, particularly the "Eily Mavour
ueen." \V. T. Oarleton, as Danny Mann, sang
excellently, as of yore. William Hamilton,
the basso, introduced '-To-morrow Will Be Fri
day" in the first act, and s>ang it so well that
he was forgiven for trifling with the score.
The rest of the cast was good.
At the California!
Nellie McHenry is certainly a success in her
new musical farce, "The Bicycle Girl." Of
course, tne piece has no plot, nor anything re
motely approaching a plot, but it is most en
joyable notwithstanding. The dances- and
songs, which constitute its principal attrac
tion, are for the most pnrt new and well ren
dered. At the opening performance last night
Miss McHeury, as Grace ir'ordyce, the bicycle
glrh, made a great hit. One of the prettiest
bits was the Invisible chorus, "Oh, Houey," at
the beginning of the second act. Miss ilc-
Henry'l duet with Charles P. Morrison was c.i
thusikstically encored, as was also Mme. Del
niore's serpentine dance.
Harry Laurent as John Potiphar, the fully
developed new man, was a revelation, while
Laura Bennett as Mrs. l'otiphar was certainly
an improvement upon her reprehensible proto
type of Ola Testament fame. The piece is
well staged and the costumes, though, some
what risque, are tasteful and elegant.
At the Grand Opera-Hoase.
Stage mechanism hoids undisputed sway in
"The Pulse of New York." which opened last
night. The play is unique in having no par
ticular plot, 110 hero and no heroine. What
dialogue there is s-erves chiefly to connect
what is perhaps the most marvelous combi
nation of MRrtling mechanical effects ever
Been In tbe City. The piece deals with very
high and very low life in the metropolis of the
Atlantic Coast and abounds in hairbreadth
escapes, deep, dark intrigues and murders
galore.
Florence Throop, n.s a female detective, is
cumbered with many cares, having no less
than six impersonations to sustain, but she
does her work well, whether as v somewhat
rapid young heiress, a "live" newsboy or a
laundress. Adelaide Wise comes as near' being
the heroine as any other lady iv the cast and
it charming in the partof Mrs. Florence Denni
soii. Frederick J. Butler und Charles W.
BwalD are both deserving of particular mention
by reason oi their excellent work, while the
other members of tne cast, though having little
to do, do thatliule well.
The stage effects are wonderful, and follow
each other in startling!}- rapid succession.
The first act displays a wharf, a church and a
genuine piiedriver, the last named of the trio
coming very near to smashing the life out of
a very pale youth who has the foolhardiness to
recline below it. Iv the second act an elevated,
railway is the piece de resistance, and from
tho track a man and maid jump in order to
avoid a passing train, being saved from death
by clutching at a convenient telegraph wire.
A real pier with an unreal East River is the
great attraction of tne third act, while
in the last there is a tenement-house lire,
during the course of which a distressed female
jumps from a fifth-story window into a blanket
held taut by a number of lusty firemen. The
play is far-fetched and the situations lor the
most part violently overdrawn, but the scenic
effects are admirable, the electrical illusions In
the lire scene beinx most realistic and effect
ive. Messrs. Bell, fcjch loth mid Chidley have
been highly successful in their artistic work.
The piece will run during this week and per
haps the week following.
At the Tivoli,
Tho trio of old favorites, Ida Valerga, Kato
Marchi and Galiano Xapoleoni, continue to
render ''Der Freischutz" a most meritorious
productiou. Some iear was expressed when
the opera was announced that the Tivoli
would get beyond its depth in attempting Yon
Weber's immortal masterpiece, but last week's
brilliant success hr.s proved the apprehension
groundless. Ringing, acting and stage-settings
are nil satisfactory, while the scenic effects,
notably in the grand incantation scene, are
beyond all cavil.
At the Orpheum.
Somehow people have learned to look for a
pretty good vaudeville programme at the Or
pheum, and as a rule they are not disappointed
in their expectations. This week's bill, how
ever, seems weak and below the murk. The
Pantzer brothers, from the Beioiu Hallo of Ber
lin, are excellent in their way, some of their
maneuvers in balancing being altogether new
and most surprising. Beyond this pair of first
class acrobats little of interest can he men
tioned. The remaining numbers are perhaps
good enough in a way, nut not what out; might
expect, judging from the performances of the
past few months.
Columbia Theater.
"The Old Lime Kiln" continues to fill the
Columbia Theater. Last night little Gertie
Carlisle appeared between the act and sang
prettily.

cyclists aud their escorts will bo admitted

Great interest is felt in the Paderewski-

Saltness of Sea Air.
M. E. Chaix of the Geneva Society of
Physics and Natural History, wishing to
tind out whether in calm weather the air
of the seashore contains an appreciable
quantity of sea salt, made several experi
ments in Jersey last August. In each ex
periment he caused by means of an aspi
rator 1000 liters (30 cubic feet) of air to
pass through a solution of nitrate of silver.
In every case there was not tiie least
cloudliness of the solution, proving
that the air contained no salt. This
is not at all surprising. It is well
known that the air contains salt
only when the wind carries off me
chanically salt spray from the wave
crests; the salt of sea water cannot evap
orate into the atmosphere. The evi
dent conclusion is ttiat, to obtain
the beneficial action of sea air, we
must go where the air is surlicient
ly agitated by the wind to contin
ually hold sea water in suspension. It is
not enough, then, for the invalid to go to
Brittany, or some sucli calm shore; we
should prefer rather somewhat more windy
coasts, as those of Picardy and Normandy,
where the air is almost always charged
with saline particles, raised from the sea
by the wind. Such localities are infinitely
more beneficial and active. â Revue Scien

NEARLY ENDED IN A ROW
An Angry Father Severely Ar
raigns School Director
Henderson.
THE O'CONNOR INVESTIGATION.
Charges That Were Not Sustained by
the Evidence of the Witnesses
Called fcr That Purpose.
School Director Henderson faced an
angry father at the meeting of the com
mittee on rules of the Board of Education
last evening, while the investigation of the
charges brought by the director against
Principal O'Connor of the Horace Mann
School was coins on.
Richard Wheeler, the father of one of
the female pupils, was called by Mr.
O'Connor for the purpose, as he said, of
showing that the charges were inspired by
malice and were without foundation. Mr.
O'Connor claimed that the director liaa
gone around among the pupils, trying to
get testimony against him.
The chairman, Director Knox, ruled hi 3
testimony out of order as no foundation
had been laid for it, but the witness in
sisted on making a statement. Going close
up to Director Henderson and shaking His
linger in his face he said:
"Henderson, you came to my house when
I was away and placed my daughter into an
embarrassing position. She is a young
girl only 16 years old and unused to the
ways of the world. You tried to make her
do Eomehting she did not wish to do,
testify against her teacher."
Then he started to walk out, and as he
went said, sotto voce, but loud enough for
those about to hear:
'â¢You dirty dog, I'll break your neck if
you ever invade my nome again."
Director Henderson leaped to his feet
and shouted:
"I'll go out in the hall with you now if
you want to right."
Mr. Wheeler said nothing, and the com
mittee rose. Wniie the members were
standing Wheeler auain approached Hen
derson and said, while snaking his fist in
his face:
"Henderson, you are no man. You had
no right in my house, and you know it.
Don't you ever come there again and try
to lead my daughter to do something she
should not â go against her teacher."
Chairman Knox ordered the belligerent
father ejected, and the gathering quieted
down.
The testimony previous to the scene was
given by the attaches of the department
regarding the language used by Principal
O'Connor, on February 4, in the school
yard.
"All agreed that Mr. O'Connor had com
pared the manners of the children to Dig
ger Indians when tbey had laughed in lus
face and had told them that their conduct
had made them a discredit to their parents,
themselves and the school. These expres
sions were admitted by the principal when
the charges were tiled.
None of the witnesses had heard Mr.
O'Connor use any such expression as "Get
ycz to your rooms" or "For 2 cents I would
give you a good bullyragging."
George Meihiing, the instructor of the
! drill, testified that the girls were unruly
j and in confusion, giggling and talking,
| when Principal O'Connor opened the win
i flow and lectured them on their actions.
He thought that the principal had acted
j perfectly right.
"I can handle boys," he said, fiercely
and then pathetically," "but oh, those
girlsâ they laugh in your face and you can
do nothing with them."
He was sure that no such language
as "For 2 cents I would give you a good
bullyragging" was used. His testimony
was borne out by that of I. P. Kincaid, the
inspector of buildings of the board; Miss
i Graham, one of the teachers, and Mrs.
i Kate Sullivan, the janitross, all of whom
â  were present when the scene in the school
j yard took place.
Mrs. Sullivan said that she had heard
one of the visitors say thnt the pupils
' ought to rebel and put on their hats and
go home.
After hearing the testimony the commit
tee went into executive session and held a
long consultation on the question whether
or not the time of tbe board should be
taken ud with a formal trial. One Di
rector said that the whole examination
had been a farce, and that nothing had
been proven except what the principal ad
mitted. It was finally decided that the
testimony would not justify the trial. The
question of censuring the principal for the
language used was discussed, but thecom
! mittee refused to say what action it would
j take on any of the points until the meet
ing of the committee of the wnole on
Wednesday.
The twelve months between the Ist of
December, 1894, and the 30th of November,
1895, witnessed the sale by auction in
England of sixty-three high-class libraries,
consisting of 45, 10t* lots of books; the
amount realized was Â£68,120 and some odd
shillings, giving an average of rather more
than 30s per lot.
Fashion plates came in i\se during the
last quarter of the eighteenth century.
" He's a strong man," you hear people say â "muscles like
! anchor ropes." The strongest men in muscular power are usually
1 the weakest in vital strength. The demand upon vitality to keep
j up largo muscles, expansive chest and abdomen usually eats up
the energy which should go to the more delicate organs. It is a !
i proven fact that fleshy men are weak in vital force more
than small men.
The cause is the extra demand upon the powers to feed these
! large tissues. Such men need
"MAKES PEOPLE STRONG."
It builds new vigor in the weakened system, adds to the'
vital energy and makes men equal in strength in every function.

Gladness Comes
With a belter understanding of the
transient nature of the many phys-
ical ills, which vanish before proper ef-
fortsâgentle effortsâ pleasant effortsâ
rightly directed. There is comfort in
the knowledge, that so manj' forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis-
ease, but simply to a constipated condi-
tion of the system, which the pleasant
family laxative, Syrup of Figs, prompt-
ly removes. That is why it is the only
remedy with millions of families, and is
everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the
one remedy which promotes internal
cleanliness without debilitating the
organs on which it acts. It is therefore
all important, in order to get its bene-
ficial effects, to note when you pur-
chase, that you have the genuine arti-
cle, which is manufactured by the Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Co. only and sold by
all reputable druggists.
If in the enjoyment of good health,
and the system is regular, laxatives or
other remedies are then not needed. If
afflicted with any actual disease, one
may be commended to the most skillful
physicians, but if in need of a laxative,
one should have the best, and with the
well-informed everywhere, Syrup of
Figs stands highest and is most largely
used and gives most general satisfaction.

SEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Feb. 24 The railway and
miscellaneous speculation was decidedly strong
to-day, and business was on a large scale. The sale
of sleeks reached 222,700 shares, and were unusu
ally well distributed. London came higher and the
foreign houses bought Louisville and Nashville,
St. Louis, Denver and Rio Grande, Lake Shore and
other international favorites. Firms with Euro
pean connections and local commission-houses
were also liberal buyers of the railway securities.
The strength of the market is still ascribed to
the success of the Government loan, the high price
commanded by the new bonds and the ease in
money, considering the heavy payments into the
treasury. The foreign demand is also a highly en
couraging feature The advance one time was
equal to y^i^h per cent, and was most marked
In the case of Lake Shore, Denver and Rio Grande,
Metropolitan Traction, Sugar, Omaha and the low
priced Western Issues. There were also a few weak
spots, notably Baltimore and Ohio, Missouri Pacific
and Leather preferred.
Baltimore and Ohio fell lVfe to 341 :>. on rumors
that the report of the expert accountant was un
favorable. A deficit of $500,000 reported by the
Missouri Pacific for the year was used against this
stock, which sold as low as 22i, 3 at one time

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 24.â Wheat was very
strong this morning, but the strength was of an
erratic sort. At times it would appear as though
the market could not be held down, when suddenly
the buoyancy would disappear and leave prices
firm with 110 great upward tendency. An ad
vance of S4 of a penny at Liverpool was the
primary agent in producing the flrmnesa. "Shorts" j
were good buyers and their purchases received the
credit of maintaining the tone. The crowd exhib
ited much interest in the visible supply postings,
the figures of which were responsible for numer
ous fluctuations, Receipts at Chicago were 118
cars and 228,33/ bushels were taken from store
Xorthwestera arrivals .vere 9.M cars for two days j
against 925 last week and 837 last year for a cor
responding period. Argentine shipments last week
I aggregated 936,000 bushels. The final result on
the visible supply was a decrease of 915,000 bush
els. The amount! on ocean passase increased
1.120.UC0 bushels and the English visible supply
[ decreased 923,000 bushels. Closing Paris cables
! were lower, Berlin higher and Antwerp un-
I changed. Export clearances of wheat and Hour
I amounted to 273,430 bushels. Reports Of large
â¢ sales of cash wheat and at New York were circu- 1
lated shortly previous to the close and tended to j
infuse additional strength to the market, but there
I was a reaction in the last few moments. May
! wheat opened Irom 65c to 651 s c, advanced to K6@
6t3Vkc, closing at 65S&C bid, Ie higher than Friday.
. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 175 cars.
! CORNâ Obtained benefit from the rising ten
dency of wheat. There was a good trade, the buy-
Ing being mostly by "shorts' 1 who were emulating
the action of their brethren in wheat. Receipts
were 607 cars and 129.000 bushels were taken
I from store. Liverpool cables were quiet and i/id
higher. The visible supply decreased 414,000 1
bushels and the amount on ocean passage 800,000 !
bushels. The estimated receipts for to-morrow
were heavy at 1100 cars, but the announcement
had but little apparent effect on the market. Ex
j port clearances amounted to 5K7.000 bushels. May
corn opened at 3'JVic, advanced to 30 : <4'<S"0"(jC,
I closing at 305jiC, i 3 c higher than Friday.
1 OATSâ Advanced with the other grains, but
there was nothing particular either In the news or
trade to deserve especial mention. Receipts were
336 cars, and 17,202 bushels were taken from j
store. The visible supply decreased 38,000 bush
els. May closed >4fg,3 s c higher than Friday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 760 cr.rs.
FLAXâ Was weak and lower; cash, 90c; May,
901/4(0,91 Vie. Receipts were 70 cars.
PROVIIOXSâ A lower hog market exerted an
adverse influence on product, but the strength of
1 wheat extended a saving force, and prevented
! prices from breaking badly. Business was of the
ordinary variety, and the market was no: aroused
I Into unusual activity at any time. At the close
! May pork was 10c lower than Friday, May lard
2V-(a,sc higher, and May ribs 5c higher.

RAILROAD RACE
TO TIDEWATER.
The Vandercook Electric
Company Will Organ
ize To-Day.
FREE RIGHTS OF WAY.
Livermore's League of Progress
Helps the Corral Hollow
Line.
TEE AD WELL WORKING SLOWLY.
But It Is Considered Certain That
His Company Will Build the
Extension.
Oakland Office San Krancisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Feb. 24. )
There is a keen but quiet fight being
WBced as to who shall be first to connect
the Corral Hollow mines with tidewater
at Oakland. Capitalists all agree that the
road is a necessary adjunct to the develop
ment of the mines, and as millions are be
ing spent in the Hollow it is not likely
that the projectors are going to sacrifice
one-half their prospects for the sake of
forty miles of road.
Trie Vandercook company that essays
to build an electric road from Oakland to
Livermore will organize to-morrow. The
papers of incorporation were to have been
riled to-day, but they lacked the signature
of one of the five directors and the filing
was postponed.
The new line has been quietly doing a
good deal of work in regard to rights of
nay, and is now in such a position that
even should the Supreme Court reverse
the Superior Court in regard to the fran
chise already granted Vandercook over
certain public roads, the company will
still be able to construct nearly the whole
road over private property, as rights of
way have been freely granted.
The promoters of the new road have
been trying to obtain an exclusive con
tract from the Corral Hollow Coal Com
pany to carry all the coal that leaves the
mines for Oakland. The greatest oppon
ent to the contract was John W. Coleman.
His death, a few weeks ago, has somewhat
facilitated matters, and the new road is
now organized. The movements of the
new company have been somewhat accel
erated by the possibility that some other
company may get in ahead.
The Corral Hollow railroad is coming to
the bay. That is the opinion of San Fran
cisco financiers, and the report is not de
nied by the officers of the San P>ancisco
;:i Joaquin Coal Company, who are
building the read from the coal mines to
'on.
â¢It it is to be extended," said one of
the-e gentlemen yesterday, "it will be
under the name of another corporation,
and it is likely at the same time that the
. I 0 will be constructed to taD the
Ban Joaquin Valley road at Bakersh'eld."
Another member of the coal company
suggestively remarked: "We have thus
Ear expended about $400,000, of which $350,
--â¢ has gone into the railroad from Corral
Hollow to Stockton. The road is broad
gauge and substantially built. It is not
likely that we should have gone to this
expense merely for the purpose of trans
porting our coal. The distance from the
mine to Oakland is less than forty miles,
and there would be no great difficulty in
obtaining the rights of way. There have
been two propositions suggested. One is
to tunnel through the hills to Livermore,
and the other to pass through the Corral
Hollow canyon. I won't say, however,
that the project has been decided upon."
The Livermore League of Progress is
working hard to secure an extension of
the Corral Hollow road to the bay, and at
us last meeting it pledged itself to assist
the new railroad to obtain the right of way
through the valley without cost % The fol
lowing resolutions were unanimously
adopted :
Resolved, That the League of Prepress of Llv
crmore Valley recognizes fully the importance
lo the Livermore Valley of the work now being
prosecuted by the Alameda and J-an loafjuin
Valley Railroad Company, and that this league
declares itself ready and anxious to extend
every effort possible and practicable to aid and
encourage the extension of the railroad
through the Livermore Valley to San Francisco
Bay ; and to this end be it further
Re-eolvcd, That this league urges the farmers,
land-owners and citizens to organize for the
purpose of procuring the right of way for such
road through the valley.
Land-owners who will give the right of
way through their possessions to the Ala
meda and Han Joaquin Railroad have been
asked to advise the secretary, J. D. Mc-
Kown, of the league immediately. It 13
not yet determined which of many avail
able routes the new road will take through
the valley. Morris D. Dutcher has offered
Mr. Treadwell a deed to a block of land
300 feet square within the city limits of
Livermore for a depot site for the new
road.
It is very evident that there will now be
a direct line from the coal mines to Oak
land's wharves.
STUDENTS READY TO WORK
Pick and Shovel Brigade at
Berkeley to Organize on the
Military Plan.
Still Studying the New Comet at the
Student Observatory â Town
Water Rates Determined.
BEEKBLBT, Cat-., Feb. 24. â The
students of the State University met to
day and took measures for carrying out
trie "student labor" scheme for the im
provement of the campus, which will be
commenced on next Thursday afternoon
and continued until the following Satur
day night. Chairman W. Nathaniel Friend
urged that the entire student body turn
out and make it not merely a:: affair in
which only a few were concerned, but one
in which every college man at Berkeley
had a Laud. It was aunouueed that Sup
erintendent McLaren of Golden Gate Park
would have supervision of the work.
A motion was then carried to conduct
the work on the military plan, since that
form of organization was considered the
most practical and the most complete.
Ihe officers will have charge of the organ
ization of their companies in the same
manner as when under military orders.
Those who do not drill such as the seniors
anct those who are exempt for other rea
sons will be placed under the care of the
senior president. A grand celebration on
Saturday night after the completion of the
proposed work was decided upon, ana a
committee of live to take the matter in
charge are to be appointed. It was stated
that the electric lights, the wires and fix
tures for which are now being put in place,
both m the library and on the campus,
will be turned on for the first time on that
evening.
A letter of thanks was voted to the
friends of the university who so generously
contributed toward the fund which will
make the illumination of the grounds and
buildings a possibility. A resolution was
passed asking Senator George C. Perkins
to change the terms of his irift of $200 to
the best debaters in the intercollegiate so
that the entire sum will go to the winning
side and not to those who were considered
to have made the best speeches regardless
of sides.
Following is the resolution of thanks to
Senator Perkins for his generous offer for
the encouragement of debating in the two
universities of the State:
Whereas, Senator George C. Perkins has
generously offered a liberal sum of money to
the speakers who shall acquit themselves the
most creditably In the annual debates to be
held between our university and the Leland
Stanford Jr. University during the next three
years; and whereas, the students of the Uni
versity of California believe that great good
can be received from the practice in argumen
tation, and that the students should be given
encouragement by all legitimate means to de
vote & considerable amount of attention to the
work; and whereas, the gift of the honorable
Senator has given renewed life and stimulus to
forensic work in our university; and whereas,
we are always pleased to note an interest
in our institution, aud especially in the affairs
of our student body, on tne part of public men.
Therefore, be it
Mesolrcd, That we, the Associated Students of
the University of California, renderour sincere
thanks to Senator Perkins, and assure him
of our appreciation of his generosity and of
the kindly regard he has always manifested in
our welfare; and,
J:- -â -< .Tcrf, That a copy of these resolutions be
sent to Senator Perkins, to the student publi
cations, The Berkeleyan, the Occidental and
the University Magazine, and that they be
spread upon the minutes of our organization.
The New Comet.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â Professor
Leuschner and his corps of assistants at
the students' observatory of the State
University are still engaged in investi
gating the conditions surrounding the
newly discovered comet.
In an interview to-day he stated that the
elements of the orbit of the new comet,
which were computed at the students' ob
servatory, have been found to resemble the
elements of a comet which appeared in
1855. This was discovered by Denoti, and
remained visible for two weeks. "Orbits,"'
he said, "of that comet are given in 'Cham
bers' Astronomy' and in 'Watson's Theo
retical Astronomy,' and were computed by
Denoti and Scheulze respectively. The re
semblance is strongest in the inclination
of the orbits of the two comets
to the ecliptic, and in the peri
helion distance, which is about two
thirds of the mean distance of the
sun from the earth for both comets. The
elements of the comets differ somewhat
in the longitude of the ascending node and
in^the longitude of perihelion. But this
difference may be due to perturbations,
that is, attraction of planets of the solar
system on the comet. The coincidence of
the orbit of the new comet with that of
1855 may be entirely accidental, and fu
ture observations arid calculations must
decide whether the comet recently discov
ered is a new one, or whether it has ap
peared before. The coincidence was rec
ognized as soon as the elements computed
by Professor Leuschner and Mr. Scares
reached Mount Hamilton, where they
were compared with the elements of
former comets."
Water Rates Fixed.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â After con
tinued discussion and consideration the
Town Trustees have arrived at a conclu
sion with regard to the water rates to be
fixed by the new ordinance. Following
are the rates decided upon, takine 1000
gallons as a basis of consideration :
For street-sprinkling purposes, 20 cents.
For domestic purposes, where the con
sumption is less than 5000 gallons per
month, 40 cents.
Where the consumption is over 5000 per
month, 35 cents.
Consumers will have the option of using
a meter, the minimum charge being fixed
at $18 per year. The accuracy of a meter
may be tested at consumer's cost unless
the error exceeds 5 per cent.
The rate for hydrants for fire service is
raised from 50 cents per month to $2, the
water company to .supply and keep in re
pair such hydrants as are ordered by the
lown. The increase was made with the
understanding that the water company
will replace its small mains with pipes
large enough to provide suitable flow and
pressure for fire protection.
Failure to supply water for irrigating
purposes will be charged against the com
pany by deducting for each month's fail
ure the charges for two months' services.
Glee Club Concert.
BERKELEY. Cal., Feb. 24.â The Uni
versity Glee Club will give a concert next
Monday evening at the Auditorium in San
Francisco. They will be assisted in the
performance by" the IT. C. Mandolin Club,
which was formed last fall, also by Mrs.
Olive Reed Batcheider, contralto, and
Charles E. Parcells, violinist. This will be
the mandolin club's first public appear
ance. A large number of the latest glee
club songs have recently arrived from the
East, and an entirely now programme will
be presented at the concert.
A special effort is being made by ah con
cerned to make the concert the most suc
cessful that has ever been given by the
club.
Quinan '97, the caricaturist on Josh, is
designing a handsome souvenir pro
gramme for the occasion.
Call for a Special Tax.
BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. 24.â Petitions
are being circulated asking the Board of
Town Trustees to take immediate steps
toward calling an election authorizing the
levy of a special tax for the raising of $20,
--000 for school buildings.
DEATH OF JOHN COFFEY.
Judge J. V. Coffey's Brother Buried at
Sacramento.
The funeral of the late John Coffey took
place in Sacramento on Sunday from St.
Francis Church, where services were held
by Father Augustine, a large number of
relatives and friends being present. The
floral offerings v?ere very beautiful.
The Recoid-Union says: John Coffey left
New York when a boy for the AVest in 1*49
and reached California by way of New
Orleans. He first engaged in mining in
Sierra County, where he was associated
with John W, Mackay for some time. Mr.
Coffey was well Known in every one of the
Sierra camps as a man of enterprise and
restless energy and of courage very fre
quently put to a successful test in the ad
venturous early days; a good and faithful
friend, but not inveterate in enmity. He
was a pioneer in the true sense. He was
among the first prospectors in the Washoe
country, going to Nevada before it was
organized as a Territory. He was one of
the treasure-seekers at Frazer River and
later sought fortune in Cariboo, and was
foremost in the settlement of Idaho, where
for twenty-two years he was in charge of
important mill and mining properties.
The last twenty years of his life he spent
in California, and lie cliÂ«d in Sacramento,
which forty-four years ago was his starting
point. He left a widow and two sons,
Jeremiah V. and Edward I. Coffey. His
only surviving brother is Judge Coffey of
San Francisco.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 25, 1896.
MRS. WILMORE IN COURT
Eight Charges of Burglary May
Be Placed Against
Her.
ABE MAJORS DETAILS SECRETS.
She Prepared Early Breakfasts and
Shared the Spoils With the
Boy Burglars.
Oaki.akd Office San Pbakcxsoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 21. f
Mrs. Wilmore, mother of Bert Wilmore,
the boy burglar, was in the Police Court
this morning. As there was no complaint
filed her attorney asked for a dismissal.
"My client was arrested Friday night
and carried to jail without a warrant, and
we are entitled to a speedy hearing," said
the attorney. "No complaint having been
filed we move to dismiss."
Prosecuting Attorney Melvin said that
by to-morrow morning there might be eight
complaints tiled, and the case was con
tinued.
Mrs. Wilmore absolutely refuses to go
into details of the troubles. She merely
says that the Majors have broken ud her
home, and that they are the guilty ones,
and that when justice is done she will be
free .
Abe Majors, whoso confession to his
brother Archie was published in The Call
Saturday, told more details to a reporter
to-day.
"She knew what was going on from the
very first,'' he said; "she knew it from the
day we stole the dynamite from the quarry.
Before we started out to do anything vru
frequently talked over the burglary. She
joined Bert and I in the conversation, but
never thit I remember expressed any defi
nite opinion.
"The first thing wo ever stole was the
dynamite. When we went out after it
Bert hinted that we were going to steal it,
and she knew well enough what for. She
had talked it over with us often. The first
real job we did was it Mason's store in
Berkeley. We told her where we were
going and what we were going for. She
advised us to fte careful, not to be taken by
ihe police, and also not to take silverware
or clothing. She gave us this advice nearly
every time we went out.
"We left for Berkeley shortly after 8
o'clock. When we were going out she
warned us to be careful and cheered us by
saying that she would have a hot breakfast
for us on our return. We got back about
5 o'clock in the morning and the breakfast
was waiting.
"We always divided whatever we got
with her. The Mason job, for instance,
netted about $24. Bert and I took about
$5 each, and we gave his mother the bal
ance. We also got a watch that night, but
Bert wanted it, so I let him have it.
"One job was just about like another.
We told her where we were going every
time but once, and she nearly always had
something to eat for us when we returned,
and we always divided our spoils with her.
I don't remember her telling us any place
to try; sne just left that to us, but I am
sure she never told us not to steal, or in
any way discouraged our enterprise.
'â¢The only big job we ever did that she
did not know aoout was at Girard's. I
don't know why we did not tell her of that.
We didn't make up our minds to try it un
til about 6 o'clock* tnat night and 1 guess
we didn't have a good opportunity to talk
to her. Ina never knew what we were do
ing. We always kept it secret from her.
In fact, it was to deceive her that we put
the pillows on the bed.
"I don't think the Wilmores have treated
me exactly right since I have been in jail.
They have sent things to Bert and been to
see him often, but they never .called to see
me. Ina and i were to be married, but I
guess the match is off now."
Abe Majors and Bert Wilmore will
appear for trial in the Superior Court to
morrow morning. Abe said to-day that
he did not much like the idea of going on
board a man-of-war, but he would prefer
to be sent to a reform school.
Mrs. I'rescott of the Humane Society
will soon apply for letters of guardianship
over Ina Wilmore. The society has been
making an investigation of its own and
Mrs. Prescott will apply for letters on the
ground that Mrs. WHmore is not a proper
person to intrust with her daughter's

"BUYING FRIENDS."
Tecullar Advertising of a Leading Firm.
â¢' Ked-I-etter Days" Again.
ft is interesting to read the advertise
ments of the California Furniture Com
pany. In explanation of how they can af
ford to sell goods at the prices they do dur
ing "Red Letter Day" sales they say:
"We don't mind losing a few dollars to
get acquainted with new peopJe, and make
them acquainted with us.
"Every piece of furnitnre we sell during
'Eed Letter Days' meaii3 a new friend ; a
steady customer for us."_
Sounds queer, doesn't it? Furniture for
almost nothing just to get you for a cus
tomer; it must pay, though, else they
wouldn't do it; it surely pays the cus
tomer. They also say:
"Our furniture makes friends; makes
people want more."
Probably that is where the secret lies:
the kind of furniture that makes friends at
".Red-Letter" prices means future business.
LETTER FROM MRS. WOOD
She Knew Nothing of the Events
Leading to Miss Parker's
Death.
No Conspiracy and No Thought of
Getting a Divorce From
Her Husband.
Oakland Office Sax Fsakciboo Call,)
90S Broadway, Feb. 24. )
A letter was received in this city to-day
from Mrs. J. F.Wood, wife of the man who
was suspected at first of knowing more of
Miss Parker's disappearance than lie cared
to teil. At the time it was written Miss
Parker's body had not been recovered and
the "last letter" to which Mrs. Woods
referred may have contained that which
impelled the deceased to her rash act.
Mrs. Woods' letter is as follows:
EMMETTSBTJRG, Me, Fob. 17.â * â¢ â¢ My
first knowledge ot this unpleasant affair was
through Miss l'arker's brother's letter to the
Chief of Police here, who lias ere this notified
Miss Parker's family that she is not with me
and never lias been with me.
I was as much shocked and grieved when I
heard of Annie Parker's disappearance as the
Oakland people, and I have no clew to offer, or
any light to throw on the subject, other than I
believe her to have committed suicide, irom
remarks 1 have her make while in my employ.
To my many deal mends that I have left In
Oakland who discredited any dishonorable ac
tion on my part, I do thank them sincerely.
All I know I was advised to come home to save
my life. There was no conspiracy whatever.
My husbund urj;cd me to come. 1 had no say
In the matter. That 1 have fully recovered and
believe the doctor to have made a mistake in
my case, I truly assert, but I have visited no
other cities, but oame direct to Baltimore,
where I was very ill for a lone time, and from
there I went to my mother in Kinmcttsburg.
I have never thought of a divorce, much less
spoken ot one, or even said 1 was not coming
back to California.
As to Miss Paiker, we have been correspond
ing in a friendly way, and my last letter must
bare arrived after her disappearance.
I would gladly assist in giving- any knowl
edge 1 possess to relieve the stricken family,
who have my sympathy.
With this statement of the only fact I pos
sess, I remain respectfully,
Mrs. .1. F. Wood.
THE SCOTCH STRAW RUSE
Restaurant-Keepers Planning to
Adopt Southern Pacific
Tactics.
Being Deprived of Liquor License They
Will Resort to Stratagem to
Hold Business.
Oakland Office San Francisco Gall.)
90S Broadway, Feb. 24. j
The revoking of the license of the Louvre
Restaurant to sell liquors, and the pros
pect that the licenses of several similar
resorts will meet with a like fate
at the hands of the City Council, have
caused some of the restaurant-keepers to
resort to their wits for the purpose of
evading the law.
It is known that for some time past
other houses that claim to be reslaurants
have been kept under surveillance by the
police and that complaints will shortly be
lodged against them. Without their li
quor license a large proportion of their
trade is destroyed and they will endeavor
to hold it. The manner in which they
will attempt to hold their customers is not
original, as it is a well-known device in
Glasgow, Scotland, and in other cities
where the closing of saloons on Sunday is
made compulsory. The plan outlined by a
restaurant-kepper, - who is in daily fear of
getting into trouble, is as follows:
"In Glasgow, where the canny Scotch
men like their whisky on the Sabbath as
well as on any other day," said the restau
rateur, "the Sunday-closing act is in full
force. The Baloon men did not see how to
prevent it, but as the law required that if
any one traveled threo miles he was a
bona lide travelers and was entitled to.
legitimate refreshments at public inns,
many of them kept houses just three miles
outside the city limits and continued in
business on the Sabbath. This, however,
was too expensive, so the saloon men re
solved to follow the tactics of the men who
sold forbidden books on the streets. These
men peddled their boots around and when
they took up their stand they would pro
duce a bundle of straws, and would an
nounce that with every purchaser of a
straw a book would be given away.
"The saloon- keepers thought this would
be a very (rood way to avoid the Sunday
law, so they adopted the sr.me tactics.
They placed bundles of different-colored
straws on their counter and by the color
of the straw purchased the boniface would
know what kind of a drink to present to
the guest. The scheme worked well and
as the saloon-keeper could not be fined for
giving a man a drink there were no con
victions. The plan is being worked to this
day. ]f driven to desperation to hold our
business we shall be forced to resort to
just such tactics."
When the scheme was reported to Mayor
Davie that ollicial did not seem a bit sur
prised. "That's the result of thirty years
of education by the railroad company",' 1 he
said. "The Southern Pacific has been
doing that right along. It is being done
to-day. The law says that the company
shall not charge fare for a ride within the
corporate limits of the city of Oakland.
"The|privilege and the "right of citizens
for the use of the streets. How is it
avoided? A man buys a ticket at Broad
way for West Oakland. It is illegal to sell
him one, so the ticket agent gives him a
ticket to Alameda and he rides to West
Oakland. It is a very clever but purely
illegal method of securing an income.
The saloon-keeper who resorts to the old
straw game is employing exactly the
same ruse. There is one big difference,
however. Tho railroad is powerful enough
to do as it pleases, but I guess the first
restaurant-keeper that follows suit will
quickly iind Himself where Huntington
should have been for the past ten years."
DETECTED BY A BULLET
Smart Capture of a Highway
Robber Who Hid in a
Roof.
PO3ED AS A WEARY TRAMP.
Held Up Two San Leandro Men and
Proves to Be a Well-Known
Criminal.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 24. f
A bitten bullet found by a bedside in a
county-road cabin led to the arrest of John
Greenbank, one of the coolest of robbers
who has ever been safely lodged in the
County Jail.
Greenbank carries on the body six bullet
wounds and has a record of which any
criminal mignt be proud. He possesses
an Iron nerve, and the ruse he practiced to
enable him to successfully carry out his
last robbery shows that he is not lacKing
in resources.
Last Friday night C. W. Hamilton and
James Snyder, two â¢well-known residents
of San Leandro, started for Stockton in a
one-horse rig. As they were proceeding
along the Castro Valley they overtook a
ragged-looking fellow tramping along the
road. He asked them to give him a rido
as his feet were sore. They replied that it
would be too big a load for one horse, but
the tramp again referred to his crippled
feet and the two travelers took him in.
After eoing about 200 yards the tramp
jumped to his feet, pointed a Run at Ham
ilton and held a big club ovar Snyder's
head, threatening either with death if he
refused to do as he told him. lie ordered
the men out of the wagon and made Ham
ilton take off his shoes. As they fitted the
tramp with care he put his feet into them,
a!l the time keeping the men covered with
his gun. The robber then told the men to
?;ive him their guns, but only Hamilton
had one. and that was handed over. While
the holding up process was going on a dog
came to the scene, and as it showed a dis
position to bark the robber ended his life
with a shot. The robber then secured
$7 50 from Hamilton and $4 50 from Sny
der, after which he ordered them to get
back into their rig. Standing behind
them, with his gun in his hand, the des
peradb ordered the two men to drive him
two miles toward the San Leandro broad
gauge station. Then he jumped out, and
as lie disappeared in the darkness he said:
"If you ever speak of this I'll hunt you up
and till you full of lead."
The two men came into San Leandro and
getting together the Marshal and several
friends they all armed and started in pur
suit of the robbers. They searched all night,
but did not find a clew. In the morning
Constable Weldon of Oakland Township
was told of the robbery and he started on
a still hunt. At a cabin near Damon's
feedstore he learned that a tramp answer
ing the description had slept the previous
night. On looking over the floor Weldon
picked up a bitten bullet and took it along
with him. He tracked the mttn to several
places, and|tinally learned he had last been
seen entering JacKson's old half-way
house. Weldon entered and was told that
no such man as the tramp was there.
While talking Weldon heard the plaster
ing overhead crack. He said he must
search the house, and with his gun in his
hand he began to look for the robber. In
a rear room he saw an opening into the
upper half story. He ascended the ladder
and satisfied himself that a man was up
there. Weldon demanded that the man
come down, but he received no answer.
The Constable then fired a shot into the
roof.
This brought the man to time and he
came down, and Weldon placed him under
arrest. At the County Jail he was posi
tively identified by Hamilton, and when
searched Hamilton's gun was found on
him. Weldon produced the bullet that
had been bitten, and Hamilton at once
pronounced it the same bullet that he nad
bitten so that it would fit into his gun. On
examining the weapon one bullet was
missing. This rendered the evidence of
guilt conclusive, and the man, who gave
the name of John Green bank, was charged
with highway robbery.
The prisoner was identified as one of the
bay prates that committed so many depre
dations a short time ago. His companions
were convicted, but Greenbank escaped.
He says he received his wounds in a
shooting scrape that grew out of a gam
bling affair.

Tucker Hall Renovation.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 24.â The Tucker
estate has given orders for the complete
overhauling of Tucker's Hall. It is one of
the oldest halls in Alameda and the most
central, but has been in poor condition,
and the facilities as well ad the arrange
ment and furnishing have not indicated
much eareÂ»on the part of the owners. The
hall will be cleaned and papered through

deliers removed. The main hall will be
carpeted and litted up with upholstered
seats and handsome furniture, giving it an
entirely finished appearance. It is esti
mated that the cost of the work will foot
Tip to something in the neighborhood of
$400, including everything.
Suit for Ilecovery.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Feb. 24.â 1n behalf of
W. A- Augustine, Attorneys Tappan &
Simpson have entered suit in the Re
corder's Court asainst Costier & Picot, car
riage makers, for the sura of ?115. Last
December Augustine, while driving up
Santa Clara avenue with his wagon, was
run into from behind by an electric car
and, besides having received several con
tusions about the head, had his wagon
completely demolished. The cleciric rail
way company, thinking it to be to blame
in the matter, volunteered at first to pay
the expense of repairing the wagon and
sent it to Costier <fc Picot's shop. Later
the company learned that Augustine was
to blame for his accident and refused to
Pay the cost of repairs. Augustine, after
recovering from his wounds, made a de
mand on the carriage-makers for his vehi
cle, but when presented with A bill for
storage and safekeeping, he demurred, ar
guing that he did not contrtct it. Being
met with a refusal to deliver up the goods,
Augustine now seeks to recover.
Just Gnough for the License.
ALAMEDA Cal., Feb. 24.â Simply be
cause he did not have the money to buy n
marriage license with did not deter Charles
J. Sims, a colored janitor, from hustling
around and procuring enough of the
wherewithal so that he could be united in
the holy bonds of wedlock to Miss Annie
Barry, a damsel of color, aeed 35. Sims
wanted very much to get married last Fri
day afternoon, but he only had $1 and he
knew that it took two of "them to procure
a license. He "struck" all his friends,
tried to collect back bills, but without suc
cess, until about 5 o'clock, when he man
aged to scrape up the other dollar. But,
alas, it was too late. The County Clerk's
office in Oakland was closed. Sims would
have to wait until Monday morning at 9
'clock. Saturday was a holiday and Sun
day he could not dream of. He felt very
much chagrined over this state of affairs,
but had to be. content to wait until to-day,
when he had the uniting ceremony per
formed by Rev. Mr. Jordan of the Baptist
Church, who charged nothing for his
services.

BEIT FRANKLIN'S KITE.
With Which the Philosopher Drew
Lightning; From the Clouds.
It was a square kite, not the coffin
shaped affair shown in story-book pictures.
To the upright stick of the cross Franklin
attached his pointed rodâ a sharp wire,
about a foot long â and provided himself
With a s ; lk ribbon and a key; the ribbon,
to fasten to the string after he had raised
the kite, as some possible protection â how
much he did not know â against the light
ning entering his body; and the key, to be
secured to the junction of the ribbon and
string to serve as a conductor from which
he might draw the sparks of celestial fire
if it came.
When the thunderstorm broke he went
out on the open common near Philadel
phia and faced death â faced the tre
mendous power of the lightning-stroke,
before which all people of all a^es had
quiled in terror ; faced what most of the
vÂ»orld then believed to he the avenfin?
blow of an angered God. True, he' be
lieved that electricity and lightning were
the same tiling, and therefore had no dif
ferent properties or effects; but he did not
Know it. The best existing theory which
accounted for electrical phenomena at that
time was his own. The laws of electrical
conduction or resistance, now so familiar,
were not even suspected. Who could pre
dict that the li r htn in? would obey anyjlaw ?
Besides, he had pruduceii tremendous
shocks with his Leyden jars in series, and
had killed birds 'with them. More than
that, he had been terribly shocked himself
by the same meansâ stunned into insensi
bility and nearly killed. He had said
again and again tnat an electric shock, if
strong enough, would blot out life, though
without a pang. If his idea was correct,
if his conviction was true, he was now
about to face an electric discharge beside
which that of the most powerful of man
made batteries would seem weak and in
significant.
All the world knows what happened.
The kite soared up into the black cloud,
while the philosopher stood calmly in t!:e
dreching rain watching the string, until
finally he saw the little fibers of the hemp
raise themselves. Then without a tremor
he touched his knuckle to the key â and
lived. For the spark crackled and le?ped
to his fincer as harmlessly as did that
from his own familiar electrical machine,
and allowed him to charge his jars with
the same impunity.
He sent the story of what he had done
abroad, without a particle of trumpeting.
He was not a discoverer for revenue. No
stock market awaited the announcement
of his claims; no newspaper stood ready to
blaze forth his achievement in the interest
of the money jugglers. His own narra
tive barely fills one of the little columns
of the Gentleman's Magazine for October
19, 1752, and it has at its end only the
initials B. F. â Cassier's Magazine.

CAUGHT BY THE
CATHODE RAY
A Bullet That Is Embedded
in a Mission Boy's
Hand.
TWO GOOD PHOTOGRAPHS
Successful Experiments Con
ducted Yesterday at the
State University.
THE SUBJECT SAW HIS BONES.
Little Justin Lee Gunnison's Remarks
About His Own Anatomyâ How
the Work Was Done.
When yon hare your photograph taken
under the cathode ray yon must sit down
for two hours and a l>alf and look pleasant.
Before the process it is necessary for you
to shoot yourself, though not fatally, and
let the doctors probe for the bullet with
out success. There should also be a pre
liminary clearing of the conscience, for
nobody knows just where the limit will be
in the new photography, nor just how
much of the innermost parts of man may
be revealed.
According to the scientific experiment
ers the cathode raj is invisible. Its ex
istence can only be detected by its results,
just as it is with a first-class lobbyist in
Sacramento. Being invisible, it is used to
photograph unseen things.
The ray is not exactly a ray of light.
More strictly, it is a wave of ether or
something of that =ort. The scientists
pay that the whole thing is as plain as day,
a process that is simplicity itself, and so
far as can be ascertained there is no evi
dence to the contrary.
Anybody who has the proper apparatus,
and who knows how to use it, can photo
graph Ms own bones. He can determine
how he will look when he is dead. He

can examine the interior of himself and
save doctor bills, or study the secrets of
his heart without the assistance of a cler
gyman. There is no end to the list of in
teresting experiments that can be con
ducted with the cathode ray, but it is not
expected that the new-fangled pictures
will be produced in the ordinary galleries
just yet, or that it will be the fad for the
whole families or groups of friends to
have themselves photographpd in the ca
thode-ray style. It would be too much
work to stand motionless for half a day.
Justin Lee Gunnison, a I.T-year-old boy
who resides at 932 Twenty-first street, is
probably the first boy to be experimented
upon in this new scientific style. He is
the son of Albert R. Gunnison, the insur
ance solicitor.
Young Justin became the possessor of
a "-"..'-caliber pistol about a week ago, and
his parents beinâ¢ opposed to the juvenile
use of firearms he secreted the weapon in
the back yard. A board fence against a
neighboring building afforded the hiding
place. Last Thursday the boy went to get
his pistol, and while drawing it through a
knothole in the fence the weapon was dis
charged.
The boy was shot in the right band. It
wa? a painful wound, but the boy was
afraid to tell about it at the time. Justin
went to supper with his hand done up in
a nandkerchief and hand and handkerchief
concealed in his pocket. His mother nat
urally made an investigation, and half an

The Bones in the Boys Hand as They Were Shown by the Cathode Ray Process
of Photography. On account of Under Exposure the Bones of the Lower Por
tion of the Hand Were Not Well Brought Out in the First Negative, but the Ex
perimenters Were Satisfied That They Had Located the Bullet at the Point
Marked in the Drawing.
[Sketched from the negative &?/ a "Call" staff artist.]
I hour later a surgeon wa9 taking care of the
boy.
Probing for the bullet was unsuccessful.
Yesterday, by suggestion of the Examiner,
Justin was taken to Berkeley and the mu
tilated hand was photographed under the
1 cathode ray. Two negatives were ob
' tamed and the experiments were regarded
as successful, the bullet being located near
the outer portion of the hand.
Justin started for Berkeley on the ?.
I o'clock boat, accompanied by his father.
! Two hours later the experiment was be
-1 gun in the electrical department of the
| Mechanical Building. It was the first
practical use of the process in this State
and the test was watched by many of the
scientists connected with the university.
Professor C. L. Cory conducted the experi
ment, assisted by Professor Slate, Mr.
Drew and Joseph N. Le Conte. Dr. Philip
Mills Jones, who has conducted the Ex
aminer experiments, was present, and the
cathodographical work was also watched
by Professor Joseph Le Conte, Professor
Christy and Professor A. 0. Leuschner.
The apparatus used in the experiment
was practically the same as that used last
Saturday when cathodographs were tak
en of the dead gopher and of a leather
purse containing several coins. The press
ure of the electrical current, however, was
not so powerful as that used in the former
experiments, having been only fifty-seven
volts while the otner was 100 volts.
On Saturday the "Westinghouse alterna
tor was used, while yesterday the small
motor was put in service.
Justin, the boy, was seated on the side
of the photographic apparatus with his
wounded hand upon the plate. Above his
hand was suspended the Crooke's tube, re
sembling a large incandescent lamp. As
the room was darkened, not of necessity,
but to better observe the workings of the
apparatus, the tube glowed with a sort of
greenish light, and the center was a violet
streak, extending from top to bottom.
That violet streak, however, was not the
cathode ray, and the professors explained
that the display of color was merely inci
dental and had nothing to do with the
cathodography.
It was a weird sort of a sceneâ the long
room, almost dark, but with occasional
electrical flashes and sputterings here and
there, and in the center of the group of
watching, grave professors a boy, with his
wounded hand under the luminous green
and violet tube.
The photographic process required an
exposure of an hour and thirty-five min
utes, and durine the Ions: period the boy
could only amuse himself by talking to
college professors and consulting his watch
to see how much longer he had to wait.
But Justin was bright and patient, and he
even declared that he was glad he had shot
himself, as the accident had afforded a
subject for the experiment.
The plate was carefully developed by
Professor S. B. Christy, and the operation
was witnessed by several of the other pro
fessors. All in the dark room were con
vinced that a spot indicating the location
of the bullet appeared when the negative
was partially developed, but it had dis
appeared when the process was completed.
According to their assertions the bullet
is in the flenhy part of the hand, near the
outside, but there bad not been exposure

enough to give a perfect negative of the
entire hand. Dr. Jones examined the hand
afterward, and he concluded that the loca
tion of the bullet was exactly as indicated
by the photographers, though the hand
was too swollen and sore to permit of a
thorough examination.
The negative was held up to the light
so that young Gunnison could see the
picture of his finger-bones.
"Oh, yes, I can see !" be exclaimed.
"lx>ok at that finger! Its crooked."
"The bones are just as plain as a skele
ton's."
The boy was proud of the picture, and
when asked whether he could pose two
hours for a second experiment, he shouted
out:
"Yes â for three hours!"
Describing the development of the nega
tive, Professor Christy said:
"It was perfectly ghastly to see the out
lines of the bones appear on that plate.
At first it was like a hand, and gradually
the outlines changed into those of a skele
ton hand."
The second experiment was made in the
evening.
The boy's hand was exposed to the rays
for two and a half hours, with only slight
interruptions to change the pressure of
the electricity. Justin was at the experi

ment table from 8 o'clock to 10:30 o'clock.
The same apparatus was used and the
same conditions surrounded this experi
ment as-in the afternoon, when the hand
was exposed for only an hour and a half.
When the plate was developed it showed
an object which Professor Christy said
looked exactly like a bullet, but whether
it wa3 or not he could not state definitely.
The round object discovered was in pre
cisely the same place as the one in the
photograph taken in the afternoon. Pro
fessor Christy said that an anatomist
coula soon tell whether the object was
really a bullet.
On account of the lateness of_ the hour,
it being 11:40 o'clock when the" work was
finished, he could make no definite deter
mination. The flesh wa:s infiltrated and
swollen, and was consequently less trans
parent to the rays than usual.
Political Kquality Club.
There will be a public meeting of the Politi
cal Equality Club at St. George's Hall, 317

William McDonald of Bernal Heights,
charged with being one of two men who held
up and robbed Mrs. C. J. Marble of $25, on the
San Bruno road, had his preliminary examina

garble positively identified him, but several
young men swore he was in their company
when the robbery took place, and the Judge
dismissed the case.
A THEATRICAL DIVORCE
Mrs. Macdonald, or Lillian Bed
dard, Wishes to be
Free.
She Is the Wife of Hereward
Hoyt, and She Says He
Neglected Her.
Mrs. Lillian Macdonald, better known to
theater-goers as Lillian Beddard, is suing
for a divorce from IJereward Macdonald.
Ilereward Macdonald is also a theatrical
person. He is known on the stage as Here
ward Hoyt, and until recently was stage
manager at the Alcazar Theater under
Grover. His wife has not been on the
stage for some time. She was recently in
charge of a school of elocution on Van
Ness avenue.
Mrs. Macdonald issuingon the grounds
of neglecj and failure to provide. She al
leges that her husband has done nothing
to support her Jor a long time, although
he has been receiving a good salary right
along. She says that in his position at the
Alcazar he was making $100 a week. She
attributes his neglect to dissipation, and
also does not hesitate to charge in her
complaint that he drank more than was
good for him. She does not ask for any
lixed amount of alimony, as she intends to
take to her profession again.
"She is a bright woman," said her attor
ney. A. C. Firebauph. yesterday. ".She
has earned a great deal of money upon the
stage and can easily support herself again.
Her husband has been only a drag on her
for a long time, and she will find no
trouble in earning her own living if she is
freed from him."
The Macdonalds came here from Aus
tralia three years ago. They have been
married about four years and have no chil
dren. A year ago they separated, and now
Mrs. Macdonajd is suing for a divorce.
Among theatrical men it its believed that
Macdonald's neglect was more active
than passive. They say he was a most ar
dent admirer of what was fa<r in the pro
fession, and he frequently lavished the af
fections he should have kept at home upon
the ladies who were with him on the stage.
OLYMPIC CLUB AFFAIRS.
Directors Will Handle the Handball
Question on Wednesday Krening.
The handball committee met at the
Olympic Club last evening, but after some
desultory talk it concluded to leave the
matter of the proposed construction of a
new court with the directors, who will de
cide at their meeting on Wednesday even
ing what course is best to pursue in the
premises. The players are in hopes that
the club will well consider the fact that a
large percentage of the members are pas
sionately fond of handball, and that in
terest in the same is rapidly growing.
The athletic committee appointed to in
vestigate the charges of professionalism
which are pending against some of the
boxing fraternity met again last evening,
but accomplished nothing of any particular
importance. It is presumed that those
athletes who are still under the fire of in
vestigation will be allowed to go free under
a heavy reprimand and a caution to be
more careful in the future.

COLONEL IRISH
SCORCHES BUDD
Politicians Have Long
Lusted to Loot the In

ARE AT LAST SUCCEEDING
The Governor's Course "Pep
pered With Falsehood and
Bad Faith."
COLONEL JACK HAYS' RECORD.
"Made Superintendent Over the Blind
to Keep Him Out of the
Poorhouse."
Colonel John P. Irish does not mince
matters in li is discussion of Governor
Budd and his motive for removing him
(Irish) from the Board of Directors of the
Industrial Home for the Blind.
"My father was blind â became blind
when I was a child," said Colonel Irish.
"I have been in constant contact with the
blind all my life. What I have done as
director of the home I have done as I
would for my own. My sympathies were
enlisted and alive. I have studied them,
I know their literature. I know some
thing of what men may do in the absence
of this capital sense. It is with this
knowledge that I have wrought among
them at this institution for nine years,
and I have the satisfaction of knowing
that it is one of the best institutions of the
kind in the country. This man Sanders,
the superintendent, whose removal I re
fused to sanction, and for which refusal 1
was myself removed, is a perfectly compe
tent man. He knew by the intuition of
perfect sympathy how to deal with these
men, and he placed the institution in the
first class of its kind.
"Now I will give you the inside history
of this business â my removal and what
led up to it â proviaed you will print it as
I give it. I wish to speak plainly, and to
be understood as being personally respon
sible for what I say."
From this point in the interview the
language of Colonel Irish was taken word
for word. He said:
"While the Legislature was in session
in 1895, Governor iJudd requested the
presence of Jacob Greenhood in his otfice,
saying that if Greenhood would state to
him, the Governor, what he had heard Fred
A. Campbell, a director of the home, had
prooosed to Greenhood to make money
for him (Campbell) out of his office as
director, he would dismiss Campbell at
once and appoint a director in his place.
Mr. Greenhood waited upon the Governor
and repeated to him Campbell's proposi
tion in my presence. The Governor said,
'I believe every word of it, by .' i3ut
he did not remove Campbell.
"Subsequently, in February or March,
1895, Governor Budd told me personally
that when the Legislature adjourned he
proposed to visit the blind home, in
quire thoroughly into its affairs, and in
form himself fully about it before he made
up his mind about any change.
"When the Legislature adjourned hedid
not visit the home nor in any way directly
or indirectly make inquiry into its affair.
"In the summer of 1895 I met on Market
street, San Francisco, at a point near the
intersection of California street, one
Fleming of Alaraeda. He approached me
in a boisterous and bullying manner,
which I concluded he had recently ac
quired in a neighboring saloon, and said,
'See here, by , do you know that the
Hon. FrankMoffitt, the Hon. Bill English,
General Dick Hammond and I held a
meeting in Jerry Hannitin's saloon in
Oakland and decided to kick out that
blind man from the blind home
and give Colonel Jack Hays that place,
and if you don't do it we will turn you
down, by . The Democracy of Ala
meda County demands it.' I told him if
that were so the Democracy of Alameda
County might be in better business than
pothousing a State institution and perse
cuting a competent blind man.
"In August, 1895, upon return from a
summer outing with my family I found at
my office a request from Governor Budd
to see him. I called on him at the Cali
fornia Hotel in San Francisco. To get
alone with me and away from the people
who were in the room he entered a closet
and closed the door. In that privacy he
said to me:
" 'See here, I want you to turn out that
blind iellow Sanders and give the sunerin
tendency to Jack Hays.' I pnswered,
'Why do you wish such a change?' He
replied, 'Because Hays is a pauper and in
capable of self-support; by ; his rela
tives have to feed and clothe him and his
family, and I must find a place for him or
let him go to the poorhouse.' I said, 'Gov
ernor, indigence and incapacity for self
support are two-thirds of the legal qualifi
cations for admission to the home as an
inmate, add blindness and you complete
the list. I think the superintendent
should not be within one-third the condi
tion of the inmates. Sanders is two
thirds removed, for he has only blindness.
You and I will have no misunderstanding
about this matter. I won't make the
change.'
"In further conversation I recited some
what the history of the effort made to im
prove the condition of the adult blind and
the success of men blind from childhood
in superintending these institutions, and
finally we left the closet and parted, each
adhering to his opinion in the matter.
The Governor said he would make a $100
place in the shop and let Sanders stay and
run the business on that salary. I said
that he would not have any control of the
men after being degraded from the super
intendency.
"I reflected that the Governor had made
up his mind to this change without visit
ing the home and making inquiry into its
affairs, as he had promised. Thereafter 1
sought the reason which moved him to a
course which in my judgment would prove
injurious to the institution. I waited upon
Harbor Commissioner Colnon, who had
been the Governor's secretary and was be
lieved to be in the possession of his con
fidence.
"Mr. Colnon told me that the effort to
get the superintendency for Hays and to
displace Banders began with men whom
the Governor believed to be his enemies;
that Bill English's brother had called him
(the Governor) a 'stinker,' and he did
not like any recommendation from that
side; but that finally the original promo
ters of Hays' candidacy had secured the
services of Colonel Chadbourne, Harbor
Commissioner and member of the Gov
ernor's staff, who had put the Governor
under obligations to him t>y voting on the
Harbor Commission to give offices to the
Governor's relatives and help him out in
placing Martin Kelley's men in office, and
Chadbourne had secured the Governor's
promise that Hays should have the place.
''Subsequently I received many requests
from Hays' friends to help Him to the
place. Adjutant - General Barrett, in a
long conversation on the subject, told me
that he had joined in urging Hays upon
the Governor, and that he had done it to
help Dick Hammond, who had clothed
and fed Hays and his family as long as h.e
could stand it.
"Blood kin of Hays' also wrote me in
his behalf at the request of Mr. Weller, the
brother-in-law of Hays, asking my support
of him on the ground that it was to keep
his family from starving and his mother
from being turned into the street, because
his relatives neither would nor could sup
port him any longer, and that he had
never earned a dollar in his life.
"I met such appeals with the statement
that the blind superintendent, Mr. San
ders, was the only working mechanic at
the head of a State institution; that his
management had redeemed it and made it
successful, and while I pitied Mr. Hays
and would be willing to add to a contribu
tion for his support i protested against
giving liirn. such a place for such reasons.
"In October or November I learned that
the Governor had determined to change a
majority of the board to effect the election
of Hays, and thereafter he visited the
home for about an hour, the first time he
ever saw it. I learned subsequently that
at a meeting at the Palace Hotel the ap
pointment of the three new directors had
been arranged with the Governor througn
a third party, with the express under
standing that they elect Hays, this method
being adopted in order that the Governor
might say he had never spoken to them on
the subject.
"Messrs. James, Coogan and Glascock
have as far as possible taken the institu
tion off its former lines, and time must
test their wisdom. From the lirst ureat
personal virulence has been shown toward
me, and for several months official inter
views have appeared in the press reflect
ing upon me. I can only say that from
the beginning the Governor's course in
the matter is peppered with falsehood, bad
faith and disregard of decency.
"A few months after the Governor's
inauguration Mr. Coogan said Budd was
too small a man for office, and his appoint
ment by Budd is an impressive continua
tion of his judgment.
"Colonel James, who is one of Budd's
uniformed chambermaids, does not agree
with the Governor as to the cause of my
complimentary dismissal. The Governor
says it was because of a report made by a
reprobate committee of the Legislature.
Colonel James says: 'There are as many
factions in the Democratic politics of Oak
land as there are Democrats. I know that
Colonel Irish has provoked the bitter
enmity of several of the more influential
of these, and they have brought the strong
eft kind of pressure to bear upon the Gov
ernor to effect hia removal.'
"Now, there are 4000 Democrats in Oak
land, therefore 4000 factions in the party,
according to Colonel James, and he says
the Governor removed me for not agree
ing with all of them. How kind of Colonel
James to aid in settling the Democratic
situation in Oakland and making 4000
factions dwell together in amity. But
would it not be well for the Governor and
his he-harem to get together when they
assign reasons for these high adminis
trative acts?
"The fact is that a blind man, a mechanic
skilled in the blind trade?, a business man
of the finest commercial capacity, had
superintended the home and made it a
credit to the State and to humanity. The
policy that put him there was favored and
maintained by my colleagues on the board,
the late Captain Ainsworth, Warren Olney,
F. M. Smith, Frank Leach, Jacob Green
hood, George P. Morrow and N. W. Spaulcl

"Politicians have long lusted to loot the
institution, and one was found with so
little self-respect as to crowd out* a blind
man to get a place for himself. The Gov
ernor, who boasts of his charity and sym
pathy and chews soap in a public and
spectacular way over his chronic kindness
of heart, ordered this outrage and was
obeyed. I stood by the blind man and the
policy which made the institution a suc
cess. For this I was dismissed and for
nothing else.

CRITICISED THE BOARD
Supervisor Dimond Talks Strongly j
of the Water Rate
Question.
Nickle-in-the-Slot Machine Ordinance
Passed to Printâ Protests
Received.
Supervisor Dimond criticized the board
severely yesterday on the manner in which
water rates were fixed a weelc aeo, saying
that the action taken was altogether irreg
ular and that he wanted to be placed on
record as opposed to it.
As a means of getting his remarks before
the board, he introduced a resolution
abolishing the Committee on Water and
Water Supply as entirely unnecessary
after the manner in which the rate ques
tion had been handled.
"This matter has placed me in a false
light," he said, "for I told many people
who wanted to protest against rates to
come before the board and that they
would be heard. The matter was rushed
through with unseemly haste and now I
am being asked why no one was heard on
the matter. The committee is useless
when the board as a committee on the
whole can thus usurp its powers and
should be abolished." Of course the motion
was lost.
The; board passed the nickel-in-the-slot
license ordinance to print by a unanimous
vote, and one more vote of approval will
send tbe measure to the Mayor for his sig
nature.
Supervisor Dimond wanted the matter
laid over to investigate as to whether the
ppker machines, which pay drinks and
cigars when winning hands are devel
oped, are not operated in violation of the
law, but the advocates of the order said
that they had satisfied themselves on that
point and he withdrew his motion.
