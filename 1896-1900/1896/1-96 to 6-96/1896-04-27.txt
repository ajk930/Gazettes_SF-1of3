ENTRAPPED BY A RUSE.
Matabeles Lured On to Death by
a Seeming Retreat of the
British.
WHITES LOSE BUT THREE MEN.

Hills and Then Retire to
the Stronghold.
LONDON, Eng.. April 26.â The Colonial
Office has received a dispatch from Sir
Hercules Robinson, Governor of Cape Col
ony and British High Commissioner in
South Africa, confirming the United Press
report of the defeat of the Matabeles on
the Umgaza River by a British force from
Buluwayo.
Governor Robinson forwarded a dis
patch dated Buluwayo yesterday stating
that a sharp engagement had occurred on
the Umgaza River, four miles north of
Buluwayo. The rebels attacked the Brit
ish in force and both wings were thrown
forward for an enveloping movement. The
British advance parties retired with a
view to inducing the Matabeles to cross
the river. The rebels believed that the
British were retreating and attempted to
follow them.
When they were within 300 yards of the
right wing of the British, fire was opened
upon them with Maxim guns and at the
same time the right flank advanced unon
them and drove them over the river. The
tame tactics were followed by the left
flank.
The rebels later made, another attack,
but were again repulsed. The British
then advanced and inflicted heavy loss on
the rebels in the hills on the opposite
side of the river. The British, after gain
ing complete possession of the field, re
tired to Buluwayo. Their loss was only
three killed and six wounded.
Hit VGHJi'S DIPLOMACY.
â His Reply to Chamberlain a Defiance to
England.
* LONDON; Eng., April 26.â The Times
â will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Pretoria, which says that President Kru
ger's reply, declining to visit England to
discuss Transvaal matters, is a diplomatic
masterpiece. It declares that the Trans
vaal Government will not discuss reforms
â¢with the British Government, on the
ground that Great Britain admittedly can
not interfere with the internal administra
tion of the republic. Nevertheless, pri
vate suggestions from the British Gov
ernment will always be considered.
' The President adds that if the revision
of the convention of 1884 and the auper
â seding thereof by a treaty of amity and
commerce containing a ''most favored
nation" clause cannot be discussed unless
the alleged grievances of the Uitlanders
are also discussed, the Transvaal would
prefer to leave matters as they are, and to
merely demand the payment of an indem
nity for Dr. Jameson's raid. ,He intimates
that Great Britain can facilitate his going
to London by accepting the basis of dis
cussion he has already proposed.
The President frankly admits that the
Transvaal administration is capable of im
provement and that the Government is
not always right. He concludes by laying
stress on tbe patience and forbearance
that have been displayed by both sides,
and expressing the hope that wounded
feelings will be healed and friendly rela
tions restored.
A. dispatch from Berlin says it is re
ported Emperor William is extremely ir
ritated by the speech made by Colonial
Secretary Chamberlain at the Constitu
tional Club on Wednesday night last, in
which he said Great Britain must be para
mount in South Africa and not allow any .
foreign intervention. His Majesty, it is
said, has instructed Count yon Hatzfeldt,
the German Embassador, to secure from
Lord Salisbury a declaration of neutrality
in connection with the Transvaal and
Delagoa Bay. â

Masked Men.
NOT WITHOUT A BATTLE
One of the Victims Fought Des
perately, Knocking Three
Men Senseless.
THE OTHER FELL IN A SWOON.
Carried Off in Their Night-Clothes
and Without Ceiemony Hanged
to a Tree.
CHATTANOOGA, Tun.., April 26.-Be
tween midnight and 1 o'clock this morn
ing a mob of fifteen masked men rode
quietly into the town of McMinnville, in
Warren County, and proceeding straight
to the jail entered the jailer's bedroom be
fore he was aware of their appearance.
The jailer seeing that resistance was use
less endeavored to gain time by reasoning
with the leaders, hoping assistance might
come. . The mob, however, became impa
tient, ana forcibly taking the keys entered
the rail wards and took therefrom Victor
and William M. Hillis, brothers, awaiting
a new trial, charged with the murder of
Carroll Martin, in Van' Buren County,
nearly two years ago.
The moment the mob entered the cell
where the Hillises were confined, Victor
the elder, snatched up a bed slat and
knocked three of them senseless, one after
the other, before he was overpowered.
The younger brother, William, uttered a
piercing shriek and fell on the floor in a
swoon. ' Without giving the boys time to
don their clothes the masked men dragged
them from the building, and mounting
their horses rode quickly and silently out
of town to a -point five miles distant,
where,' with : a few preliminaries, they
hanged them to a tree.
The victims of the tragedy were sons of
Squire La wson Hillis, one of the most
highly esteemed residents of Van Buren*
County and for years a leading member of
the County Court. "*'
The crime for .which the Hillis brothers
were lynched was committed in 1894. Car
roll Martin, an aged citizen, who lived in
the mountains of Van Buren County, and
who was supposed to have $1000 in his
house, was attacked one evening in Au"ust
of that year about twilight by two men
with â¢ their faces masked. The old man
was shot to death, and his daughter, who
struck one of the men on the arm with an
ax,* was shot in the leg. The men fihaliv
left without finding their booty, the money
having been thrown from the window into
the grass by Miss Martin. ; 3/3
The Hillis boys were suspected on ac
count of certain injudicious remarks in
regard to the crime. They were tried,
found guilty and sentenced to be hanged
but appeals, new trials and a change of
venue , to Warren County prevented their
execution. ' ; -3 : -/*. .': -â¢/*â

CLAY CENTER,' Kans., April 26.â A
cyclone of tremendous force sped through
Clay County late last night, dealing death
and destruction on every hand. As far as
known ' twelve people were killed, nine
fatally injured and j forty more or less
hurt. The known dead are: Frank Peter
son, Mrs. Frank Peterson, a child of the
Petersons, Mrs. ; Ole Naverson , Eli Belt
hazer,*' Mrs. Eli Belthazer, Julia Trim
bly,\ J. ; S. 'Hazen, and a ' grandchild
of A Peter Anderson. A full list of the
injured is unobtainable as the doctors have
not returned from the scene of the disas
ter. It is known, however, that every
member of the families of John Morris, F.
Welkin, Peter Anderson and Henry Gard
ner was hurt, and three of them have in
juries said to be fatal. A large number of
horses and cattle were killed and the dam
age to farm property is immense,
The cyclone started about six miles
south'' of Clifton and went in a J north
easterly direction for -twelve or fifteen
miles and then lost its force by spreading.
It passed about half-way between Clifton
and Morganviile. Its track varied from
150 yards to a quarter of a' mile in width.
Houses and barns - were wrecked, trees
torn up or broken," fences leveled and hay
stacks â¢ blown -in every J direction. The
cyclone â¢ was followed by a terrific rain
storm which lasted several hours, flooding
the devastated district.
; There had been indications of a heavy
rain all day, with 1 local showers, but no
body expected a storm. As far as learned
the victims of .the \ cyclone were in their
bouses and most of them had retired. The
storm struck Peter "Anderson's home at
9:30 o'clock. This was about a mile from
the starting point. The house was de
molished in an instant.
Every member of the Anderson family
was injured. ; When they' bad extricated
themselves from the debris they discov
ered that Anderson's grandchild was miss
ing. The j body of the ! child was found
this morning in a ravine a half-mile away.
' Anderson alarmed 1 the neighbors who
lived out of \ the track of the * storm, and
search was commenced for victims, but
little 1 headway was made in the rain.
Couriers were sent to Clifton and Morgan
ville for doctors, but it was daylight be
fore . they; arrived. .Many of the injured
lay > all night pinned down by wreckage,
while others crawled or hobbled across the,
country to neighboring, houses. In sev
eral instances people were lifted into the
air ;by the ; cyclone and carried for a dis
tance and then suddenly dropped. /,.,.
1 i Buildings also were lifted up and hurled
to the ground with territhc force.

were reading when the shock came. The
house was j destroyed. ; The women â¢ man

pears that the occupant of one of the

while caused much alarm in the vicinity.
The great glare of the light and the rush

caused a panic in the church. The alarm
was only momentary, however. The fire
did no other damage, and it was not nec
essary to get the engines into operation.

' NEW YORK, N. V., April 26.-Some

in Cuba to-day by the following' interview
with J. Frank Clark, staff correspondent of
The United Press, who has just arrived
from Havana. Mr. Clark said : ' ' : s 3'3*
"These conclusions " force themselves
upon me as the result of five months' ob
servation of the progress of the revolution
in Cuba. The insurgents are making a re
markably good fight. Spain has demon
strated her inability to put them down.
The end is not in sight, but Cuba is surely
slipping away from Spain, and unless
some new element is introduced the island
will be lost to the mother country. Mean
while atrocities are being committed and
methods of warfare are being followed
which are ,not countenanced by civilized
nations.

first was' at the beginning 'of April, 1895,

I remained two months, sailing to the
States in June. ' Early in January I went
back to Cuba, finding that Gomez and Ma
ceo, whom I left in the mountains of the
eastern district; had marched 600 miles,
carrying the wave of revolution westward,
and were then almost at the gates of the
capital city. When' I left Havana a week
ago the insurrection was larger, more
formidable and apparently more promis
ing of success than at any time in the
fourteen months since the Cubans rose
against Spain. ' ' ';.' r *,
1 "I went to Cuba not as the representa
tive of any- one newspaper with an edi
torial opinion of its own, but as the cor
respondent of the United Press, an asso
ciation whose sole mission is to obtain
facts and disseminate news.' ' ' 3
- ""In* the- early part of the struggle, be
fore the insurgents had made much
progress, my reports were criticized by
Cubans as unfair to theun. Now that they
have swept over the island, pushing the
troops of Spain before them and making
a record that will live in history, Spaniards
say that my reports are unfair to Spain.
In both cases I have told the truth. ,
"Before the arrival of General Weyler
correspondents were permitted to accom
pany Spanish columns, and in the early
stages of the war Spanish generals even
permitted' correspondents to visit the
enemy's camps. Since the enemy has
grown from scattered bands to organized
and fairly well-armed and drilled columns
it is a matter of. life and death for a cor
respondent to penetrate the rebel lines.
He would be welcomed by . the insurgents
but shot upon his' return to Spanish
camps. I have had experience with four
Captain-Generalsâ Calleja, Campos, Marin
and Weyler. The last is the only one of
them who made the life of a war corre
spondent burdensome.
"Suave and courteous in his talk, pro
fuse in efforts to aid correspondents in
sifting truth from error, polite in his re
ception of all Americans, yet he has a way
of impressing upon a correspondent, with
out putting it into words, that it would
conduce to his personal safety to report
nothing but Spanish official news. As
they fail to mention a single insurgent
success from the beginning, and give out a
record of Spanish victories which exist on
paper only, the correspondent who ac
cepted them at face value beguiles his
readers.
"If Spain were winning battles, why not
permit accredited correspondents to â¢ ac
company columns of troops and report
from personal observations ? If battles are
fought whenever announced officially, why
are correspondents refused a safe-conduct
pass to enable them to visit the battlefield
when all is over? If the affair at Guatao
was a battle and not a butchery, Why were
two correspondents thrown into Moro
Castle, charged with having visited the
place, which is only twelve miles from
Havana?," > , Â . * â¢â ...
"The Spanish correspondents of Madrid
papers, the Spanish reporters of Havana
papers, all subject to the 'press censure,
and the American correspondents, are
penned up in Havana, and every effort is
made to keep the world in darkness as to
what is being done in" Cuba. Every re
liable dispatch is carefully edited before it
can be transmitted. Everything unfavor
able to Spain or favorable to the Cuban
cause is eliminated. The mails are
searched to prevent newspaper corre
spondence being sent off. But with all
these precautions tne truth cannot be sup
pressed, and every Wednesday and Satur
day the papers of the Unite! States arrive
in Havana, and long accounts of rebel vic
tories and Spanish brutalities, which are
true, are read by the English-speaking
residents and translated for the benefit of
Spaniards. '..'â ' â :!. -3
"The situation in Cuba is not difficult
to gaugeâ Spain has sent 140,000 regulars
and 60,000 volunteers have been raised in
the cities of the island. The latter are used
almost entirely for home defeuse.. Of the
regulars, approximately 25,000 have suc
cumbed to bullets and disease during the
year, 15,0C0:are in the hospitals or have
been relieved from duty and about 100.000
are available for active operations. These
figures are estimates made by an army sur
geon and are very near the truth. The
Spanish official loss of 3800 men from all
causes during the year is too absurd to be
considered. Fully half of the regub_r a2
available for active operations are required
for garrison duty in cities and towns.
About 2000 small forts or blockhouses have
been built and these are occupied by.the.
troops. The establishment of the latest
trocha â that between Marie! and Majana
absorbs 30,000 regulars for tne defense of
the line. There are about 10,000 regulars,
divided into flying columns of 1500 to 2000
men each, operating aggressively against
Maceo just west of the trocha in Pinar del
Rio and in all of the other provinces there
are not more than 13,000 troops in the field
against the enemy.
"General Weyler made numerous at
tempts to surround and crush Maceo and
Gomez during his first month on the
island. He did not succeed. He then re
sorted to the well-worn Spanish device
called a trocha, which had been abandoned
by Campos and Marin as useless.
"In order to mate it a strong line he
has practically stopped aggressive opera
tion in all the provinces except the west
ern one and concentrated his troops there.
Gomez. Lacret, Jose Maceo, Calixto Garcia
and other insurgent leaders with large
forces are unopposed. They move from
one province to another constantly reviv
ing and spreading the flame of rebellion.
They are gaining accessions daily from the
better classes and their followers can no
longer be designated as ignorant blacks.
The number of insurgents under arms is
now fully 45,000. Cubans claim anywhere
from 60,000 to 75.0C0. but they include un
armed camp-followers and men whose
only weapon is the machete.
"Spaniards say the Cubans will not fight,
but I have seen many trainloads of
wounded Spanish troops brought into Ha
vana and other cities, and American
planters upon whose estates encounters
have taken place declare the Cubans are
absolutely reckless unuer fire. They go
into a fight with two or three rounds of
ammunition to the man, knowing they
must capture cartridges or they cannot
fight on the morrow. When the last shot
is gone they charge upon a mule train
with machetes and generally obtain sup
plies for the next day.
"It is true they avoid general engage
ments. They have not the ammunition
nor the artillery to operate as a fully
equipped army. They therefore resort to
guerrilla warfare, and Spain can make no
progress against them. There are many
reasons for this. In the first place, Gomez
and Maceo are men of military genius.
The rank and file of the insurgents wor
ship their leaders and obey orders im
plicitly. On the other side there are jeal
ousies, political intrigues, and personal
ambitions among all grades of Spanish
officers. General Weyler says when an
officer obtains a rank above that of colonel
in Cuba his usefulness is gone. Twelve
brigadier-generals have been sent back to
Spain for incompetency since General
Weyler arrived.
â¢'The Spanish troops themselves have no
heart in the fight. They are raw con
scripts from the peasant class of Spain.
They are poorly fed, and are driven about
like cattle. They obey orders faithfully,
undergo hardships and exposure in a
climate to which they are unused, and fall
by the wayside or die in hospitals, the
victims of a war in which they have no in
terest. Their condition is pitiable indeed.
In a few weeks the rainy season will set in
and yellow fever will cut wider swaths in
their ranks than the bullets of the enemy
have yet done.
"The entire interior of the island is either
in actual possession of the insurgents or is
in sympathy with them. In every small
town the Cubans are doing; what they can
to aid the men in the field.
"The office-holding class of Spaniards
and the merchants who profit by Spanish
continuance in power still insist that
Spain must win, even though the island be
laid in ashes and her sod drenched in gore.
The rabbid Spaniards are the ones who
forced the recall of General Martinez Cam
pos. They have recently attacked General
Weyler, accusing him of being as lenient
as Campos. Owners of plantationsâ for-
eigners and Spaniards as well as Cubans
state that the Government columns sent
out in pursuit of insurgent bands, in fail
ing to force a fight, or getting the worst of
one, fall upon the peaceable, unarmed em
ployes in the fields or hiding in their
houses and slaughter them without mercy.
This is followed by an official report of a
brilliant victory." 'â  3 7.
ESCAPED FROM TIIEIR GUARDS.
Two Xoung Cubans Who Will Not Grace
a Spanish Prison.
NEW YORK, N. V., April 26.-Two
young Cuban patriots, both of whom had
been captured while fighting for the
Cuban cause, were passengers by the
French line steamship La Bretagne, which
arrived from Havre to-day.. The young
men are Alonzo Rubenzo and Alfred Mar
tino. They are 19 years of age and the
sons of good Cuban families. They were
made prisoners by the Spaniards " when
Martinez Campos was commanding the
forces of Spain in Cuba. They were or
dered to be deported from the island and
imprisoned in the fortress at Barcelona.
They were accordingly sent under guard
to that city, but managed to escape from
their keepers while the ship was approach
ing her pier.
They remained in hiding a week and
stole out of the city at night and made
their way to the Pyrenees Mountains,
which they crossed after many hardships
and perils and finally succeeded in reach
ing Paris. There they applied to Dr. Bo
tenees, head of the Cuban junta in that
city, who afforded them means to come to
New York. The young men would not
say whether they would tempt fortune
again by returning to Cuba in aid of their
struggling countrymen.
OUTFITTING FOR A CRUISE.
The Filibustering Bermuda Will Again
Carry Arms to Cuba.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 26âThe
filibustering steamer Bermuda arrived in
port at 6 o'clock to-night, anchored off the
Clyde steamship dock and took on a cargo
of large boxes from a barge, also six large
eight-oared surfboats.
It is said the contents of the boxes,
several hundred in number, were rifles,
small arms, machetes, dynamite, powder
and medicine. A number of small boats,
some containing spies, some Cubans and
a number of reporters hovered near the
Bermuda, but no arms were seen and no
definite proof could be obtained that the
boxes contained arms.
The Bermuda chose her time well, the
revenue cutter Boutweh having just left
this port, and a Spanish man-of-war hav
ing just departed for Key West. The Ber
muda's crew was increased at this poit,
but by how many is not known.

French Political Situation
Viewed With Grave
Concern.
A CRISIS IS INEVITABLE.
The Reichstag to Be Asked for
Credits for Further Mili
. tary Equipment.
ENGLAND AND THE TRANSVAAL
Civil "War Predicted Unless the Cape
States Are Granted Complete
Autonomy.
BERLIN, Germany, April 26.â The pros
pect of a collision between the French
Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, re
sulting from changes in the constitution
placing no control over the power of a sin
gle chamber, is regarded in responsible
Government quarters here as a matter of
the gravest concern. ; The mere resigna
tion of a Cabinet upon a party question
has lone been considered a matter of small
moment, but the present situation threat
ens to shake the stability of the Eastern
relations of the French republic.
- In an article commenting upon tbis state
of affairs the National Zeitung holds to the
belief that henceforth the permanency of
the policy of . France is impossible to rely
upon, and that sooner or later the internal
troubles of the republic will be reflected
upon the relations of France with foreign
powers.
The Vossische Zeitung expresses fear
that the constitution of France will not
furnish President Faure with adequate
means to avert an ultimate conflict be
tween the two chambers, though he may
be able to hit upon temporary expedients
to delay the struggle which is nearing the
inevitable, and the interested Europeans
ought to exert their influence to the end of
securing a new form of government for
France. The feeling of uneasiness inspir
ing these and similar comments by the
press is due to the belief that the exist
ence of the Senate restrains the dangerous
impulses of the democratic amber.
Whatever political stripe of government
France has had since 1870, not one of them
has ceased to prepare to take the fore
front in a conflict for the restoration of
her military supremacy in Europe.
It has been learned by the German War
Office that the Bourgeois Ministry some
time before its fall had decided to ask the
chambers for a credit of 470,000 frans for
the purpose of supplying the army with j
quick-firing guns of a pattern superior to
any that has yet been produced.
Tins, however, was not a surprise to the
War Office, which had already provided
designs for a new quick-firing gun sup-
Dosed to be a great deal more effective than
the French weapon. The French inven
tion has long been in possession of the
War Department and has been kept a
strict secret, the Government being reluc
tant to order the construction of the guns,
as a radical change in the artillery equip
ment of the army would involve an out
lay of 200,000,000 marts. Now that France
is lively to obtain a new and formidable
gun it is imperative that the Reichstag
must be asked for the necessary credits to
strengthen the artillery equipment of Ger
many. Confidence is felt in official circles
that the Reichstag will recognize the fact
that the artillery arm of the military ser
vice urgently requires the credit and that
upon hearing the Ministerial statement
upon the subject may also grant a naval
credit and so bring both the . military and
naval services up to date.
The officially inspired press, speaking
freely on the subject, are giving out an
accurate expression :of official and public
opinion as to the relations of Great Britain
in South Africa, which the papers declare
are not alone confined to encroachments
upon the Transvaal, but upon the whole
Afrikander interests to which Germany,
these journals assert, is now inclined to
tender moral support and even diplo
matic intervention. 7A 7':
The North German Gazette argues that
the Cape States ought to sustain as com
plete autonomy as Australia and the re
maining members of the British empire
and with as full a measure of inde
pendence. -Nothing short of this, the
Gazette adds, will effectively prevent civil
war.
The VoÃsische Zeitung blames Mr.
Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secre-
tary, for want of tact in dealing with Presi
dent Kruger of the Transvaal Republic,
for Insulting the Boer administration by
accusing it of wholesale corruption, and
for acting throughout as though it were
an absolute fact that South Africa is going
to pieces. Â __,;_
"It is an extremely serious matter," the
paper continues,* "to find that the words
â¢race war' are current throughout the
Cape. If a conflict takes place between
England and the Transvaal the British
possessions in South Africa will be at
stake." : * â 777:77:;,:^
The Altdeutsche Blatter boldly contends
that Germany and the Boers ought to
hold together and force back English in
vasion and forever make South Africa a
great field for German immigration,
where Germans could preserve their na
tionality and give solid support to German
doctrines, theories and interest every
where. 3r -333 77 77'-
The Altdeutsche Blatter is less diplo
matic in its utterances than the North
German Gazeste, but the paper better ex
presses the popular sentiment.
Apropos of tho general German feeling
in regard to England the cognate question,
"Will the Emperor go to Cowes in the
autumn as he had proposed to do?" has
been variously discussed with the result
that the preponderance of opinion is that
he will not visit England if the present
tendency of the English policy continues
and that no inducement that can be offered
by family connections is likely to persuade
him to go. -Â*â --â/_.:'
In an article upon this subject the in
spired Magdeburg Gazette says : The Kaiser
will not visit England, without fully con
sidering the political situation, and , the
rapidity with which changes are being
made therein make it hardly possible for
him to decide what he will do in the mat
ter several months ahead.

favorable to the interests of the Dreibund
and less inclined to democracy, as well as
less friendly to France * than the present
Pontiffâ it is stated that advices from high
Catholic sources divide the probable can
didates for the tiara into two groups. The
first of these, following the present policy
of Leo XIII, includes Cardinals Svampa,
Ferrari and Santi, and the second, with a
policy supposed to be less politically
biased and therefore more favorable to the
Dreibund, is headed by Cardinal Galim
berto. 7. 3- 77i
The group includes Cardinals Vincenzo,
Serafino, Vannutelli and the brothers Ca
pacelatro. The two ablest members of the
Sacred College, Cardinals Parecchi and
Rampolla, are not considered, for various
reasons, as being eligible. The question
of the .Papal succession is certainly stir

Dr. Yon Stephan, Minister of tbe Impe
rial Postoffice, has charged the American
sculptress, Mrs. Cadwallader Gould, with
the modeling of two great allegorical fig
ures representing respectively Posts and
Telegraphs to be placed upon the post

sculptors, through the Vossische â¢ Zeitung
and other papers, have protested against
this award of the work.
Owing to recent instructions from Wash
ington the American embassy will here

Prince yon Hohenlohe, the Imperial
Chancellor, is suffering from a prolonged
attack of insomnia, accompanied by fail
ure of appetite. It is now plain that the

early retirement and speculation as to bis
successor.

in opposing the proposal for reform in tue

The Berlin Industrial Exhibition is in a
state of chaos. The Emperor insists upon
its being opened on May 1 and prepara
tions for opening on that date are as far as
possible being rushed night and day. The
workmen, who are masters of the situa
tion, have raised a demand for increased
wages in open violation of tneir contracts.
They will not work except when they

A MANIAC'S AWFUL WORK
Shoots and Kills Five Persons,
Then Ends His Own
Existence.
His Fever-Stricken Sister. Hearing of
the Tragedy, Expires From
the Shock.
ROCKVILLE, Ind.; April 26.â of
the bloodiest tragedies that ever occurred
in this part of the country took place here
and as a result seven people are dead.
About 7 o'clock in the morning Peter Eg
bert, a young man 23 years of age, went
into the back yard to saw some wood. Just
as he was starting his work Mrs. Herman
Haschke, who occupied the adjoining
house, left her residence and went a short
distance away to milk her cow.
As soon as she was ont of the way Eg
bert went into his house, and securing a
gnn, entered the Haschke house, adjoin
ing. The first one he found there was
Mrs. Haschke's ten-year-old daughter,
whom he at once shot dead. Then he
shot at the girl's brother, a ' few years
younger. The first shot only wounded
him, and he ran out on the porch calling
for help, but Egbert pursued him and shot
him dead. â
Then the murderer went in search of the
mother of his victims. He found her in
an alley near by, and firing at her he
fatally wounded her. She died two hours
later.
Shouldering his gun, and still evidently
thirsting for blood, the murderer started
toward the business part of town. There
he saw Sheriff W. D. Mull and Constable
W. M. Sweam .crossing the street toward
him. He called out to them and warned
them not to come near him, at the same
time threatening them with his gun. The
two officers ran tor the stairway of the Na
tional Bank building, but before they
could reach it Egbert fired, and both men
dropped dead.
The murderer fled, pursued by a big
crowd. He started to run toward the fair
grounds, with citizens close behind. Once
he turned and threatened the crowd with
his gun and some one fired at him, hitting
him in the heel and crippling him. Un
able to run any further he turned his gun
on himself and fired a charge into his
breast that proved almost instantly fatal.
The gun was so close that the powder set
fire to his clothing. ;
At the time the tragedy occurred Egbert's
sister, Miss Florence Egbert, was lying ill
of typhoid fever. Some one told her of
the affair. The shock prostrated her and
she died soon after, making the seventh
death.
The crime was undoubtedly due to in
sanity. Egbert was at one time confined
in an insane asylum, but had j been dis
charged as cured. It is the general belief
that he suddenly became insane as he had
no motive for his dreadful deed.

McKinley's Manager Sends
Out His Usual Weekly
Bulletin.
CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS.
Claims 444 of the Delegates So
Far Chosen, Exclusive of
the Doubtful.
ELECTIONS YET TO BE HELD.
Of the Votes to Come at Least 125
Are Expected to Be in the
McKinley Column.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 26.âGen
eral Grosvenor gave out to-night his regu
lar weekly statement of McKinley votes.
As usual he declines to make any figures
upon other people's strength, confining
his figures to a comparison of McKinley
votes and the number necessary to a
choiceâ 4s6. He also declines to discuss
the accuracy of the table of votes of any
body else, and said to-night:
-*1 rely with absolute confidence upon
ultimate results to vindicate my figures."
McKinley's strength, as General Gros
venor gives it, stands to-day at 444. He
further states : 333.
"I do not place my votes in Connecticut
or New Hampshire in tbe McKinley table
at this time, although I see thai the New
York Tribune gives the names of three
Connecticut delegates. 1 prefer to leave
those States to make known their status
when the roll of the convention is called,
and I may add in this same connection
that there are a considerable number of
delegates not classified as McKinley men
in other States than Connecticut and New
Hampshire who may be relied upon to
protect McKinley from any combination
looking to his defeat. *
Now, looking forward, the prospect is
very pleasant. There are about 200 dele
gates to be elected hereafter, as follows:
Alabama 4, Georgia 4, Illinois 12, Vermont
8, Arizona 6. California 18, Michigan 26,
Nevada 6, West Virginia 8, Montana 6,
Missouri 16, Delaware 6, Colorado 8, Wash
ington 8, Idaho 6, Wyoming 6, North Car
olina 18. Total, 166.
"And the balance, making up about
200, are scattered by districts over the en
tire country.
"It will be observed by careful analysis
of these votes to come that it is a modest
and conservative statement to claim that
McKinley will have 125 of those votes,
and probably more. Thus, it will be seen
that my statement that the Ist of May
would see McKinley within reach of a
majority was not only not an exaggera
tion, but has been verified by results, and
will be conclusively demonstrated by ac
tual figures when the delegates are
elected."
MA NL tl'S STATEMENT.
The Maine Congressman Makes a Very
Conservative Estimate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 26.-Man
ley of Maine gave out the following state
ment this evening:
"Congressman Aldrich of Illinois left
for his State Saturday. He will attend
the State convention at Springfield on
Wednesday of this week. His statement
of April 20, which was made upon ac
curate and reliable information derived
from the delegates themselves, was based
upon the election of 604 delegate.. Of
this number Reed was given 128 delegates,
Governor McKinley 214, doubtful 66 and
all others 196. It gave McKinley 35"_ per
cent of the delegates elected. The state
ment was made with so much care and ac
curacy that it can be relied upon with the
utmost confidence. /* 3
"I have taken Aldrich's estimate as a
basis for my statement of delegates elected
up to that date, adding those elected from
the 20th to the 26th of April, inclusive, and
classified them with the following results.
It will be seen that there are many dele
gates placed in the doubtful column.
"There are in many instances contested
delegates, and it does not seem proper
that, prior to the action of the National
Committee, which has to act as a commit
tee on credentials for the temporary roll of
the convention, and, prior to the action of
the credentials committee on the conven
tion, any one has a right to assume
what delegates will be seated in the con
vention; therefore I have not presumed to
claim how these delegates would vote, but
have preferred to place them where they
belongâ in the doubtful column. In no
instance have I anticipated the election of
any delegates. This statement only relates
to the delegates actually elected.
"Out of 250 delegates thus far chosen in
the block of States north of the Potomac
and east of the Ohioâ a block of States con
taining a great proportion of the manufac
turing and commercial interests of the
country McKinley has secured only nine
votes. McKinley's percentage of the dele
gates elected remains practically as it did
one week ago. The whole number elected,
.711. For Thomas B. Reed, 161; for Gov
ernor McKinley, 250; for all othej candi
dates, 217; doubtful and contested, 83.

CONGRESSIONAL BUSINESS.
Numerous Important Measures Hanging
Fire in Both Houses on Account of
Appropriation Bills.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 26.â 1t is
probable that the general pension bill
will be brought to a vote to-morrow under
the operation of an order to be reported by
the Committee on Rules. General Hen
derson, chairman of the Committee on Ju
diciary, expects that the House will then
take up the bankruptcy bill and discuss it
for two or three days.
Babcock, chairman of the District of Co
lumbia Committee, to which committee
Monday's session is assigned, says
that if deprived of that day's session the
committee will insist upon some other day
in the week in which to press District
bills.
Aside from the pension and bankruptcy
bills on the programme of the House it is
uncertain what will be done, and every
thing is dependent upon developments
from day to day.
The Senate will probably continue to
devote most of its time to the considera
tion of the appropriation bills, being far
oehind the House in the disposition of
these bills. Hale will call up the Naval
bill to-morrow. Frye expects to ."eport
the River and Harbor bill either tomor
row or Tuesday at the latest, and it is the
expectation that both the bills will be
passed before the week Is ended.
Sherman will renew his attempt to se
cure the passage of the bill to repeal the
free alcohol for the arts clause of the tariff
bill. Should he do so, Senators Lodge.
Chandler, Piatt, Pritchard and others will
vigorously oppose him, and it is openly
said that if this matter should be pressed
it will involve an indefinite prolongation
of the session and the opening of a general
tariff discussion.
Meanwhile Peffer*s bond resolution, now
divested of nearly all its salient features,
holds its place as the unfinished business,
giving way from day to day for the consid
eration of appropriation bills.
Wednesday Vilas will present resolutions
accepting the statue of Pere Marquette and
will make a speech on the resolutions.
SUNDAY BASEBALL STOPPED.
Indianapolis Officials Prevent a Game
'3 3 on the Sabbath.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., April 26.â The
fate of Sunday baseball was definitely set
tled to-day when the Sheriff with _ big
force of deputies prevented the game that
had been scheduled between Indianapolis
and Grand Rapids. Fully 7000 people
gathered to see the game, and in order to
keep within the law no admission was
charged; but the Sheriff was obdurate and
threatened to arrest, every man who at
tempted to play ball. Nothing was left
for the managers but to explain matters
to the angry crowd and call the game off.
There will probably be no further at
tempts to play Sunday ball in Indianapo
lis, and under the Western League rule
the Sunday games scheduled here will be
played elsewhere.

WILD SCENES IN
A BURNING HOTEL
The Old Bridge House at
Moline, 111., Destroyed
This Morning.
A YOUNG MAN PERISHES.
Slumbering Guests Aroused and
Scramble for the Streets in
Night Robes.
THE STAIRWAY EXIT IS CUT OFF
Women Leap From Windows Before
Ladders Could Be Placed for
Their Rescue.
MOLINE, 111., April 27.â One man was
burned to death, several persons were in
jured, and many more had narrow escapes
from cremation when the old Bridge
House was destroyed by fire early this
morning. A panic among the guests
added to the excitement and danger.
William Sage lost his life, Nellie Swan
son, a domestic, and John West, a black
emith, were badly injured.
The house was a frame hostelry of un
certain age.
The fire was discovered on the ground
floor about 2 o'clock by a night watchman.
It was burning fiercely and the slumber
ing tenants, all of whom were on the upper
floors, were in extreme peril. The watch
man battered on the doors and yelled
"Fire to arouse the inmates.
His outcries had the effect of arousing
and stampeding the guests, nearly all
of whom bolted for the street in their
nightclothing. The doors were , broken
down, and a few of the persons inside
escaped by the stairway and regular exits.
. The greater portion, however, speedily
found the stairways cut off by flames and
smoke. The women ran screaming about
the upper hallways, and finally threw
themselves headlong from the windows
before ladders could be placed. The fire
men did all that was possible, but the ra
pidity of the flames made it impossible for
them to do much in ihe work of rescue.
Mrs. Steve Walters, wife of the proprie
tor of the hotel, escaped with great diffi
culty through the flames and climbed
down on a long plank placed against the
side of the building.
William Sage, the young man who was
burned to death, was an orphan, 18 years
old. His remains were found at 5 o'clock
this morning in such a position that it
was evident that he died in his room.
TULARE'S ROSE FESTIVAL
Energetic Women Have Charge
V of Arrangements for the
Flower Show.
Methcd by Which the Queen Will Ba
Clio:en Is Kept a Guar-'ei
Secret.
TULARE, Cal., April 26.â As the time
approaches for holding the annual flower
carnival the interest in the success of the
undertaking increases. The flower show
last year was a success in every way.
Mrs. A. Borders, the queen, with her aids,
held sway for two days, and all loyal
Tulareans remember with pleasure her
reign amid the blossoms.
Year by year Tulare is becoming more
and more a city of roses, and no town in
the interior can excel her magnificent dis
play of lovely floral products. This year
the carnival is to be held on Friday and
Saturday, May 1 and 2, and a somewhat
different plan is to be adopted in the se
lection of a queen. The arrangements are
wholly in the hands of Tnlare's energetic
women the Ladies' Auxiliary. In 1895
these untiring ladies did much to make
the carnival a success, and also added a
goodly sum to its treasury.
It is understood that the selection of
queen is in the hands of the members of
the Tulare Cornet band, and a good deal
of dignified mystery is involved in the
plan for the oncoming \ fiesta. Whatever
method may be pursued it may be safely
anticipated that the rose carnival will
easily surpass any former affair of the
kind held in Tulare. 77.
The exhibit of flowers next week will
be a gorgeous one. The town will be dec
orated, the hall be transformed into a
ower of lovely blossoms, the queen will
be crowned and all Tulare will be in gala
attire.

the family records bear the names of many
heroes of the revolution. He came to
California in 1852 and experienced the
usual vicissitudes of pioneer placer mining
in the northern counties of the State.
Later he engaged in farming in -Yolo
County. He was the first City Marshal of
Woodland. He came to Fresno County
twenty-three years ago and settled on a
tract of Government land, where he died.

Selma. He returned to Ohio in 1862 and
married, a widow and seven children sur
viving him. 77J77i;^Z7c7.

The Aged Jurist's Struggle
for Liberty Ends in
Failure.
IS DECLARED INSANE.
Judge Otis Decides That It Would
Be Unwise to Release
the Patient.
A VICTIM OF DELUSIONS.
Cruelties Charged Against Attendants
Found to Have Been Im
aginary.
SAN BERNARDINO. Cal., "April 26.â
Judge Huse must remain in an insane
asylum. The fight for freedom which the
aged jurist, backed by his friend and attor-
PROMINENT MEMBERS OF LOS OSOS PARLOR, NATIVE SONS OF THE GOLDEN WEST, OF SAN LUIS OBISPO.
ney, F. F. Galardo, has been making came
to an end yesterday. After an examination
which has been stretched out for more
than a month, in which, every detail of
the remarkable case has been gone into
with the utmost minuteness. Judge Otis
rendered a decision which remanded Judge
HÂ»3e to the Highlands institution.
The case has been stubbornly fought
from the first; no similar hearing in any
court has ever been more thoroughly in
vestigated, and in the opinion, which
Judge Otis was an hour in delivering, he
reviewed every .feature of the case, dispos
ing of the grounds on which the petition
was founded and ended by denying the
writ
Judge Otis stated that all other consider
ations would be laid aside in the decision
except the question as to .whether Judge
Huse was now insane and, if so, whether
to an extent that would make it unwise to
release him. The court took up the vari
ous delusions attributed to Judge Huse,
and admitted them one by one.
Judge Otis declined to class the belief on
the part of Judge Huse that he had vast
property interests as a delusion, for the
reason that it had not been proved to be
a mistake. When it came to the question
of the broken ribs which Huse insisted he
sustained at Highlands, Judge Otis said
that from the testimony of physicians this
was a delusion, since an examination de
veloped no evidence of such injury.
The court elaborated -on some of the
other alleged delusions, upon the habits
and idiosyncrasies of Judge Huse, and
finally gave it as his opinion that it would,
be unwise to release him. At the same
time Judge Otis stated that he had rareiy
seen in court or elsewhere such a remark
able memory and evidence of strong men
tality, and few attorneys at the bar were
able to conduct an examination with more
ability or state a legal point more clearly
than had the insane jurist.
SAN JOSE'S FLORAL HALL
The Great Carnival of Roses
Pavilion Ready for the
Opening.
Tons of Flowers of Every Hue and
,â¢;':.; Variety Used in the Dccc
rations.
I
' SAN JOSE, Cal., April 26.â great
Carnival of Roses Pavilion is About com
pleted, and will be formally opened Friday
evening by a ball by the Knights of Pyth
ias. The pavilion is 125 by 200 feet in di
mensions and was erected at a cost of
$10,000. The main floor, exclusive of the
space allotted to booths, will Beat 3500,
and the gallery will seat 2400 more. With
the booths' removed there will be a seating
capacity of 7500. It is provided with a
stage of 75 ' feet frontage and a depth of 36
feet. ... .' ... . * .-:, ..
The pavilion will be magnificently dec
orated for the carnival.' The interior of
the building will be almost entirely, cov
ered with evergreens; and redwood foliage,
and upon the background will be beautiful
floral decorations. On the opening day of
the carnival roses will form the chief dec
orations,' and the pillars and other por
tions of the building will be profusely cov
ered by these flowers. On the other days
there will be decorations of sweet peas,
marigolds and other flowers. To make im
pressive effects there will be great masses
of the same kind of flowers in all available
positions. Banks of flowers of gorgeous
hue like marigolds, for instance, will pro
duce striking effects.
The great ceiling of the pavilion will be
a wide expanse of evergreen and floral dis
play. The effect can be better imagined
than described, and the reality will far ex
ceed all expectations. Around the stage a
beautiful sunburst effect will be produced
with flowers of different colors. This de
sign is especially artistic, it being in so
prominent a position in front of the great
multitude thai will throng the hall during
the four days of the fete.
There will also be many flags, carnival
colors and bunting generally in the inter
ior of the building. The exterior will be
elaborately decorated with evergreens,
flowers and flags. The pavilion, as being
the center of interest in the carnival, twill
fully realize in appearance the high antici
pation that the people of San Jose and the
visitors from abroad may form of it.
Work on the Arch of Carnival on the
Alameda, near the narrow-gauge depot,
has 1 begun, and during the coming week
the erection of the other arches will be
commenced. There will be other arches
at Third and Santa Clara streets, First and
San Antonio streets and on First and Bas
sett streets, near the broad-gauge depot.
Besides these it is believed there will be
several arches erected by private citizens.
The arch on First and Bassett streets will
be very fine- and of an imposing nature.
It will" be called the Ladies' Arch of Wel
come. The background will be white, sur
mounted by a beautiful female figure. The
arch will be decorated elaborately with
floral wreaths contributed by the ladies of
San Jose. It is certain that a very novel
and beautiful effect will be produced.
There is to be a pleasing variety in the
forms and decorations of the arches. Each
will have a different design, and the line
of march will be so arranged as to pass
under all of them. ' All the arches besides
the floral decorations will be made bril
liant with the carnival colors, flags and
lanterns. It is the design to make the
arches the important features that they
should be in the decoration of the city for
the great fete.

THE YOSEMITE TRAGEDY.
Neighbors of Lambert, the Murdered
Entomologist, Charge the Crime
to Indians.
MERCED, Cal., April 26.â J. H. Red
mond,, Coroner of Mariposa County, was
here . to-day, on his way to San Luis
Obispo to attend the Grand' Parlor of
Native Sons. He had just returned from
near the Yosemite Valley, whither he had
been called to hold an inquest on the body
of J. B. . Lambert, the entomologist, who
was found dead in his cabin last Sunday
by : Indians. The inquest developed the
fact that Lambert died from a gunshot
wound in the head. From the condition
of the body it is surmised that he had been
dead about two weeks. The one who com
mitted the murder closed and locked the
cabin door on the outside with a padlock.
It. is hard- to assign a motive for the
deed, as Lambert was a poor man and was
quiet and inoffensive, having had no
known enemies. His neighbors charge
the murder to Indians.
Lambert was a chum of John Muir when
the latter was pursuing his studies of the
glaciers in the Yosemite Valley some
years ago. â¢ ' - _ â

ADVENTURES ON THE ST. PAUL
Three Exciting Incidents Attend the
Voyage of a Party of
Delegates.
. SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., April 26.â A
little railroad runs in from the sea, making
its way fourteen miles among the hills.
There is a railroad from the north, with
San Francisco a nine hours' ride away,
and there is a road that extends down
through the county and leaves passengers
at the beginning of the forty-mile stage
route from Los Olivos to Santa Barbara.
Yet San Luis Obispo, the sunny little
town encircled by high, green hills, seems
shut away from the rest of the world, and
it is easy for the dreamer to here forget
the noise, the hurry aud confusion of life
in the business towns.
This Sunday morning was bright and
beautiful as the sun climbed over those
eastern hills. There â¢ never was more
glorious weather in any land. There could
not have been a more quiet spot on earth
up to the hour of the morning ringing of
the Mission bells. But a change soon
came. The Native Sons of the Golden
West are to meet in convention here to
morrow, and San Luis Obispo is the capital
of the Golden West this week. So the
townspeople arose at the ringing of the
early bell and resumed the work of dec
orating their homes and places of busi
ness. The rain of Friday and Saturday
had necessitated postponement, which is
the apology given for the seeming viola
tion of Sabbath rule in this Sabbath-like
town. '7y;-7C7
The natives have chosen San Luis Obispo
as their meeting place for the first time,
and the people are making great endeav
ors to give them an appropriate reception.
At 8 o'clock this morning the military
band marched in uniform to the railroad
station. It played a lively air of welcome
when a large delegation of the natives ar
rived . from the steamer St. Paul, and it
played again to greet delegates who came
on the Southern train. X* I " V
Most of the people w ho were â¢ passengers
on the St. Paul had been at the flower fes
tivals in Santa Barbara . and Los Angeles.
Their voyage up the coast from San Pedro
was enlivened. by several unusual inci
dents, and these incidents are being relat
ed to everybody in San Luis Obispo to-day.
At San Pedro,- there was a wedding. Mrs.
Kate Parcell of San Francisco, a woman of
middle age, arrived on the St. Paul to meet
a man whose matrimonial advertisement
she had answered. * She waited on board
the steamer until her prospective husband
called and introduced himself. There
was a public declaration of mutual satis
faction, and then as the man. and woman
started away to find a clergyman the
ship's entire stock of rice followed, with
the good wishes of the Native Sons.
\ When the steamer turned out from
| Santa Barbara, a tramping crook," without
ticket or money/was encountered by Mate
Hall. A combination like that always
causes trouble.' The steamer stopped and
backed up, and the tramp was hoisted out
over the railing! .*â ." Dangling at the end of
the rope, me man was swung high in the
air and then lowered. . He missed the dock
by about two feet and the â¢ bath that he
received was something to which he was
unaccustomed.
.' An hour later, when the St. Paul was
plowing iat full speed through the quiet
sea and three or four miles out from the
point on which the lighthouse stands, the
fire alarm was '* sounded. The f mate ran
forward, the chief engineer jumped to his
post and every officer and member of the
crew responded hurriedly to the summons
,of i the whistle and bell. â¢ The steame /
;- ---yy- -â â â  â 
stopped. It was, of course, only the usual
fire drill, which is practiced on every voy
age of the steamer to keep the officers and
crew well trained in the lowering of the
boats and in fire duty. But there was an
entirely unexpected outcome of this drill.
Down . in the steerage were six big,
brawny man-of-warsmen from Admiral
Beardslee's flagship, the Philadelphia.
These exceptionally able seamen had
served their time in the navy, .and
still in their blue uniforms, they were
on ! their \ way to San Francisco, either to
ship again or be discharged.
After remaining three hours ashore at
Santa Barbara they had brought a supply
of beverages aboard the ship and the sup
ply was about exhausted when the fire
alarm was sounded. The sailors knew the
signal and every man of them went up the
ladderway as only a sailor can. On deck
they found officers and crew briskly
getting the boats ready to lower, and not
comprehending that it was only a drill
they jumped at the ropes. 'â  One of them
lost his round lettered cap overboard in
the exciting rush. One additional sailor
of the flagship variety at each boat made
the drill a highly successful one, but it was
a wonder that the boats did not get into
the water before the earnest wort of the
big marines could be stopped.
At Gaviota, where the St. Paul touched
last evening, the Brazilian gypsies were
encountered. The gypsies were encamped
near the wharf and they besieged the ship,
begging vociferously, even ferociously, in
Spanish. They declared that their "chil
dren were starving, and they had as large
an assortment of youngsters as could be
found on any road. They clamored for
money, and if a man gave them a nickel
they insisted on getting silver. A dime
only emboldened them to ask in their ap-
pealing Spanish for another and a quarter
of a dollar brought the plea that the gift
be doubled.
In the line of energetic, turbulent, pro
fessional begging and fortune-telling, the
women of this band cannot be equaled in
America. The men merely look on and
take care of the horses and the > camp
equipage. 3 .\
In conversation with a Call representa
tive the leaders denied that they had
stolen from the people of Santa Barbara
or that they had committed any depreda
tions in California. They said that they
had traveled from Brazil by way of the
Isthmus and they were bound for San
Francisco. They could not tell what they
would do at San Francisco, but is ap
parent that gypsy life is their permanent
condition.
The number of the adults appeared to
be from thirty to fifty, but not all were in
camp, and the statements they made were
conflicting. A lot of children were play
ing about the camp and more were stowed
away in the wagons. One young woman
was asked how much of a family she had.
Replying that she had ten children, who
incidentally were starving, she , was re
warded* with a dime. Instantly she as
serted that she had fifteenâ ten boys and
five girlsâ and she begged accordingly for
another nickel.
These gypsies, if gypsies they should be
called, are a poor, degraded-looking lot
The women arc dressed raggedly and they
travel without shoes.' The band is headed
for San Luis Obispo, and the local authori
ties will be asked to keep them out of
town during convention week.
, This evening's train from San Francisco
was an hour late, and, the main body of
delegates did not arrive until 6:30 o'clock.
The whole' town had turned out to meet
the visitors, and a hundred or more of the
Native Daughters were in the throng.
The engines hauled the Native Sons' train
to the station, and white the 250 delegates
and their friends were alighting the music
of the valiant brass band was lost in the
cheering. There were greetings and hand-
throughout all |the crowd, and
then a line was formed and a march to
the headquarters of the order was 4 begun,
the Fifth Regiment band assisting the
local organization.
j "Viva los osos!'' was the cry along the
street, and by the Spanish name of the
bears was meant the natives. Everybody
shouted the motto, while the procession
of men, women and children ; filled the
sidewalks and roadway for a third of a
mile. The motto is suspended over each
of the 'central streets, and it is illustrated
by broad representatives 'of the grizzly,
realistic in size and color. The bear is the
general emblem here, and "Viva los osos"
will long remind the Natives of 'their con
vention in San Luis Obispo.
This evening was given up to the Â« infor
mality ;of individual welcomings. 'â¢ The

Los Osos Parlor, which has the honor of
entertaining the Grand Parlor this year,
was instituted on April 4, 1885, with thir
ty-seven charter members. G. W. Mc-
Pherson of Stockton Parlor No. 7 was dis
trict deputy, and organized and installed
the new uarlor, with the assistance of C.
G. Hinds of Stockton Parlor No. 7 and W.
P. Veuve of San Jose Parlor No. 22.
Messrs. Hinds and Veuve joined the char
ter members by card. Ernest Graves was
its first president. The name for the new
parlor was " the next thing to be consid
ered, 'and after a short discussion Los
Osos was decided upon, the name being
historic and also pertaining to the em
blem of tbe Native Sons of the Golden
West It was derived from the Canada de
los Osos, a valley west of this City, which
was â in early days ' overrun by bears, and
the first padres of the Mission gave the
canyon its significant name, "The Valley
of the Bears." The parlor has held its
own since its organization and gone
steadily along, and to-day has a member
ship of sixty in good standing. This is a
good record, when it is taken into consid
eration that there are a number of other
lodges here. The past presidents for the
last few years have been : J. B. Blake, H.
,E. McKennon, E. M. Payne, R. E. Lee, J.
F. Fiedler, J. W. o' Sullivan. M. R. de la
Guerra is president of the parlor at pres
ent, and has also been a past president.
T. J. Bowen, the secretary of the parlor,
has held his office since July, 1890.
J.B.Blake is favorably mentioned as
one of the foremost candidates for the
position of grand trustee from this City.
VISALIA SAFE-CRACKERS.
Robbers Blow Open the Puget
Sound Lumber Company's
Strong-Box.
They Carry Away but a Small Sum
in Money and the Office
Type iter.
VIS ALIA, Cal.', April 26. âSafe-blowers
made a successful onslaught on a safe in
the Puget Sound Lumber Company's office
at 2 o'clock this morning. Not satisfied
with tbe small sum it - containedâ only
$16 the cracksmen carried away a type
writer (machine). '
When Manager Cither approached the
office at 11 o'clock to-day he noticed that
the inside blinds were down, and at once
surmised that something was wrong. On
opening the door he saw the wreck. One
half stick of giant powder and a small tin
tube were all that was left by the robbers
for the officers to work on, unless the size
and shape of a No. 9 footprint that was
found in the yard will be of any use.
While one or more of the* cracksmen
were at work on the safe their team was
hitched outside, and a confederate was on
the lookout. Several residents living near
heard the noise when the strong box was
blown open, but thought it was a pile of
lumber falling before the wind. Night
Watchman Byrd also heard the noise.
Thinking it was made by the closing of an
iron door in the rear of a mercantile house
he made an investigation. The team was
heard going down the street, and then all
was quiet. â  'â¢ â  -

PORTLAND'S RIVAL
TO FAMED ARGUS.
Mrs. O'Neil's Ninth Babe
Sees Through Three
Optics.
GIVEN TRIPLE VISION.
A Well Developed Eye Located
Above the Little One's
Nose.
EACH TINY ORB IS PERFECT.
They Wink and Blink in Unison, and
Do Not Greatly Mar the Child's
Beauty.
PORTLAND, Or., April 26.â A babe that
arrived at the home of W. P. O'Neil, a
railroad man on the West side, ten days
ago to-day, will go through life gifted
with extraordinary foresight, if the pos
session of a third eye counts for anything.
The child has three perfectly developea
optics, two where they ought naturally to
be found, and the third one between them
over the nose. Strangely enough, this dis
neurement does not render it hideous, as
mieht be expected. It blinks just as
naturally with the central eye as with the
others, and seems to see as well with it.
This was Mrs. O'Neil's ninth offspring,
the other eight being healthy, well-de
veloped children. At its birth the babe to
all appearances was but an ordinary in
fant. The nurse, however, noticed that
there was a peculiar little formation just
above the nose. She called the attention
of the doctor to this, but he looked lightly
upon it, expressing an opinion that it did
not amount to anything, and would soon
pass away.
Whatever it was, the formation refused
to disappear, and tbe medical man be
came quite interested. Three days after
the baby made its appearance the doctor
was greatly surprised to notice that what
looked like an eye had formed in the
child's forehead. He called in some of
his brother professionals, and they were
of the unanimous opinion that it was an
eye, and no mistake about it.
Of course the child was too young to
permit of a complete examination, but
the older it grew the more perfectly the
eye developed, until now the third optic is
as clearly developed as the two natural
eves.
PEARL LADD. THE CLEVER CHILD PIANISTE.
PLAYS LIKE AN ARTISTE.
A California Child Who Will
Make Her Debut as a
Pianiste.
Pearl Ladd, a Gifted Child, Who
Numbers Married Ladies Among
Her Pupils.
A little California girl makes her debut
as a professional musician on Wednesday,
who, if early talent goes for anything, will
make a good deal more than a local repu
tation in the years to come.
This child, whose name is Pearl Ladd, is
a bright, self-possessed little person of the
mature age of 12 years. She has chosen as
her instrument the piano, and to excel on
the piano means a great deal in these
days, when nine out of every ten little
girls have a certain amount of pounding
and strumming upon it inflicted upon
them as part of their day's penance in
the way of lessons.
Growi.-up people generally feel a sense
of suspicion and uncanniness when they
hear a child Bay she loves . practicing on
the piano, for they at once have visions of
being compelled to listen to "gems f:om
the classics made easy" ground out with
laborious exactitude. But little Pearl
Ladd really does not play like a child ; her
technique would be considered excellent
even if she were double her age, and then
is a verve and authority about her inter
pretation of pianoforte music that is quite
astonishing in one so young.
The little girl, who scorns to play any
thing in public with notes, has a wide
repertory, which includes the works of a
number of classical composers.
She considers difficult transcriptions
by Liszt as mere recreation and plays
dances by Brahms for pastime. ' For her
self her tastes run more to sonatas, but she
is always willing to consult the tastes of
her hearers, provided that something rea
sonably good i* asked for. .
The child has not yet been heard in pub
lie, and even in private she has been kept
from exhibiting her talent much before
strangers. Her parents have given her
every advantage in the way of lessons and
attending concerts â instance, she did
not miss one of Paderewski's recitals.
But the fame of the child's ability has
spread among her friends and she has had
so many offers of pupils that she has at
last consented to take three. Strange to
say, all Pearl's students are married ladies,
and they are all players of some ability,
who come to their little teacher more for
lessons in style and finish than for tech
nique. i :r :
There is a good deal of magnetism about
Pearl Ladd's playing, which may account
for the desire of other people to learn
from her.
. â¢ "I am not at all nervous," observed the
self-possessed little one, when asked if she
were not afraid to appear before an audi
ence for the first time and give a long
recital without a note of. music.
"Why should I be nervous?" she added
thoughtfully. .''l shall be thinking about
. the music and not of the people. I never
mind playing before any one because it is
the music that really matters."
Miss Ladd, being of an inquiring turn of
mind, asks a few preliminary questions of
I any one who wants to hear her play.just
j to take their musical caliber.
"I don't play all the composers myself
vet," she remarked yesterday, "but I have
heard works by most of the composer*
played by good musicians and I have a
general idea of how the works should be
rendered."
It seemed almost uncanny to hear this
child in a short plaid frock discussing
music as seriously and gravely as if she
were at least 40 years of age. When asked
about Paderewski she replied enthusiasti
cally:
"I like him best in Chopin; his inter
pretation was magnificent, but really
there were some thingsâ l remember
especially a 'Valse Caprice' by Rubin
stein when he altered the notes, because I
remember distinctly how they were
written and he played them differently."
There was something delightfully frank
and unconscious in the way the child pi
aniste talked about the great Polish vir
tuoso. She had no idea of being pedantic.
She adored his genius, but in her childish
way she had formed her own views and
was not going to alter them because Pade
rewski was Paderewski, the greatest living
pianist.
Pearl Ladd has quite made up her mind
that she will devote her life to playing the
piano, and to judge from her talent she
will make a success of it. .

mitted suicide at Santa Maria, leaving a
large estate. .
DUTCH POLITENESS.
Social Etiquette in the Netherlands Is
Peculiar.
Social etiquette in the Netherlands is as
nteresting as it is peculiar, and, in its ex
traordinary manifestations, it is a revela
tion of what constituted the customs of
New York hospitality of two centuries ago.
The French are polite, but their politeness
is nothing as compared with that of the
Dutch. The visitor notices it as soon as he
arrives in the country and as he sees it in
the street salutations. Everybody bows,
nobody nods, and mere touching of the hat
s unknown. As in France, the gentleman
bows first; but, although he may have
bowed for ten years, he is denied the privi
lege of addressing the lady. A bow is given
to every acquaintance.
A Dutchman gives an order to a work
man and takes off his hat with a bow that
would not bring discredit to a dude. If
he meets his neighbor's footman or
kitchen girl, he salutes her as he does her
mistress, and the men servants give their
recognition on meeting ladies. Every one
bbws on passing a house where acquaint
ances reside, and it is amusing to see men
go by and take off their hats at the win
dowsâit is quite immaterial whether any
of the family are visible. ' Moreover, ladies
make a polite bend of the whole body as
they pass houses where they visit. Trades
men salute all of their customers. A lady
is bowed to by all of her father's, brother's
or husband's friends, and if a Dutch boy's
father or brother has ever met a lady, that
boy must recognize her. Every man takes
off his hat .to every other man that he
knows, the dustman and the pastor bow
ing as politely as 'wo lord?.â Golden Rule.
Westmeath was in the reign of Henry
VIII separated from Meath or Eastmeath.
It was then much larger, and contained
Longford and part of Kings County. The
McGeoghagans and O'Fallons were the
chief clans.

August Neresheimer Chosen to
Succeed Dr. Buck as Vice-
President.
-IS LIFE WORTH LIVING V
Colonel E. T. Blackmer Answers the
Much-Debated Question With a
Decided Aifirmative.
As predicted in The Call a week ago,
Ernest T. Hargrove was elected yesterday
at New York as president of the Theosoph
ical Society in America.
When this announcement was made at
the meeting of the local society in Red
Men's Hall, on Post street, last evening, it
was received by the very large audience
with general satisfaction.
The convention was formally opened at
New York in the concert hall of Madison
square Garden yesterday morning, and all
of the important occurrences of the as
semblage are given in the following spe
cial dispatch from New York to The Call:
NEW YORK, N. V., April 26.â The second
annual convention of the Theosophical Society
in America began this morning in the concert
hall of Madison-square Garden. The attend
ance was very large, theosophists from all
parts of the United States being present. Act
ing President Dr. J. D. Buck of Cincinnati was
elected permanent chairman.
The committee on resolutions and 'auditing
were then appointed, after which Claude Falls
Wright read the president's annual report. It
recited the fact that despite the international
differences among the theosophists there were
to-day 108 branches in tne American society,
as against 102 last year. The report dealt in
general terms principally with the marked
progress made, and urged continued effort on
the lines laid down by the late President
Judge.
Treasurer August Neresheimer's report
showed receipts d -ring the year of $8699, and
a balance on hand of $1000.
At the afternoon session the several commit
tees, including the committee on resolutions,
reported, the first resolution being adopted by
a standing vote. This was eulogistic of the
late William Q. Judge and his work.
The resolutions pledge the lives of the mem
bers to the completion of the work he under
took. There were several other resolutions,
referring more especially to the work of the
society. These were adopted, and then came
one which excited opposition, and it went over
for further consideration. The cause in the
resolution which caused objection was to the
effect that the society condemned the practice
of vivisection and hypnotism, the latter being
characterized as a practice of Ignorant per
sons teaching and experimenting upon other
ignorant people. Dr. A. P. Buchman of Fort
Wayne began a speech of objection when, on
motion, the resolution was referred back to
the committee.
Chairman Buck then called E. L. Rambo to
the chair and he nominated Ernest T. Har
grove of London, England, for president of the
society. He was enthusiastically elected, the
secretary casting the ballot of the convention.
August Nsresheimer of Bavaria was next
unanimously elected vice-president and treas
urer, and Claude Falls Wright, A. H. Spencer,
H. D. Patterson, Dr. A. P. Buchman, Dr. J. D.
Buck and Dr. Jerome Anderson were elected
as an executive committee for the ensuing
year.
At the conclusion of the afternoon session a
proclamation was read and adopted, stating in
part that the society joins hands with all re
ligions and religious bodies whose effort is di
rected to the purification of men's thoughts
and the bettering of their ways, and avows its
harmony therewith, and invites to its member
ship all those who, seeking a higher life here
after, would learn to know the path to tread in
this.
The evening session was principally devoted
to theaelivery of addresses.
Mr. Hargrove, the newly elected president, is
the son of James S. Hargrove, a London so.
licitor, and is a member of the same profession.
He has spent considerable time in this coun
try, lecturing on theosophy.
The meeting of the local society last
evening was an extremely interesting one,
and the hall proved almost Inadequate to
accommodate the attendance. Dr. Allen
Griffith, State lecturer for the society,
opened the meeting by a lucid explanation
of the objects and beliefs of the order. He
was followed by Colonel E. T. Blackmer
San Diego, the speaker of the evening.
Colonel Blackmer's theme was the much
mooted question, "Is Life "Worth Living?"
He said in part:
This question which I have taken for my
text is the question of destiny. It never took
shape until it was forged in the workshops of
experience. It is the outgrowth of thoughtful
ness, not along material, but intellectual and
spiritual lines. As usually presented, it re
fers to human life with its possibilities.
The speaker then referred to the view
of life which materialistic philosophers,
theologians and authors have taken. This
view in the main was that we experience
the pains and annoyance of this life in
order to reap some great reward in a life
to come. 3 :3 v. 3/
Theosophy teaches that we live in a great
ocean of life; that all universes, worlds, men,
animals, vegetables, minerals, molecules and
atoms, all that is are plunged In this great
ocean. The life of It permeates all. Every
manifestation of this life is endowed with the
essential attributes of existence, viz., con
sciousness, force and substance.
But it is human life with its ceaseless round
of births and deaths, its joys and sorrows, its
pain and bliss, the mystery of which we are
forever trying to solve ; and this we are prone
to look upon as something different from the
life in the kingdoms below. But it is all the
manifestation of the One Life, only we have
reached a higher stage in the process of evolu
tion. There has evolved in and for humanity
an individualized center of life forces, which
has brought it to a state of self-consciousness.
This Individualization began In the kingdom
below, but always falling short of the self
conscious stage until we reach man. , -â 
But man is more than animal. When the
stage of self-consciousness is reached in the
human kingdom we find a new factor in life.
Man not only knows that he exists, but he
knows that he knows. Reasoning from the
past, to a limited extent he forecasts the
future. Reasoning upon his origin and destiny,
he hat formed the conception of a creator.
All these higher faculties are but the result
of evolution, which is perfecting and bringing
to | fruitage . the germ of self-consciousness.
They are all the differing manifestations ot one
universal life. - There is no break, no missing
link in the continuity of progress.
Does this power become inoperative when It
reaches the stage of human progress? Can we
â predicate or conceive of any stage or state of
consciousness where progress will cease? " Most
certainly not. Admit evolution, and we can
not limit it at this side of the universal.
| As units in this great problem of evolution
we must help or hinder its final solution. Let
us not forget that the purpose of evolution,
since It has reached the human stage, is spir
itual, not material; that brotherhood, hon
esty, patience, charity, -sacrifice, are the
rounds of the ladder upon which we must
climb to the loftiest heights.
CAPTURED A THUG.
George Hayes Apprehended in thÂ« Act
of Committing Highway
Bobbery. .
George Hayes, a very hard-looking char
acter, was arrested early this morning
while in the act of holding up a man
named John Jones at the corner of Green
and Stockton streets.
Hayes assaulted Jones with brass knuck
les and then, holding him up against the
side of a house, started to go through his
pockets. 7 . .-. ..'..;
Jones yelled "Police!" at the top of
his voice, and his cries attracted Offi
cer Norman and St>ecial Officer Mc-
Intyre, who came running from op
posite directions'. Hayes was captured
and taken to the California-street station
after a desperate resistance.
No money was found in his possession,
and Jones was unable to tell how much he
had lost. Hayes had the brass knuckles
when captured. . â ;â ;.'." .'. .7
LUMBER RAISED AGAIN
The Manufacturers Issue a Re
vised Price List to All
Purchasers.
Central Offices Moved to Steuart
Street, Where There Is Room
for Active Work.
The Redwood Lumber Company has at
last settled down to business, with its new
schedule of prices in full operation. And
every manufacturer of redwood lumber In
California is bound by his contract to main
tain the new rates.
The head offices of the company, which
are really a central clearing-house for red
wood business, have moved from 10 Cali
fornia street to more commodious quarters
at 29 Steuart street.
The combination of redwood men for
mutual protection has therefore proved a
greater success than its promoters ever
imagined, even in their most enthusiastic
moments. For every manufacturer has to
make a return of bis daily sales to /the
central office; he must permit surveyors or
inspectors in the employ of the redwood
organization to watch shipments received
and report on th m. 3,"".
By this means the receipts of redwood
lumber are known to a foot and sales
must correspond witb them. It is impos
sible under these strict rules for any mem
ber of the "company" to sell below the
price list established by the united lum
bermen.
Prices have been advanced on all classes
of redwood lumber not less than $1 a
thousand feet and in many instances the
raise is just double that figure.
There are two lists, one for the Mendo
cino mills, the other for the Humboldt
and Del Norte mills. These are for car
goes aclivered in San Francisco or round
the bay in vessels airect from the lumber
harbors. The Humboldt list is as follows:

other mill of the same capacity, he will

there is no reason to cut prices were there
a possibility of doing so. â¢."â  â¢â '-'"
"But this no combine. The prices allow
only a bare margin of profit, and there
cannot be an oversupply *in the market.

LOOKING FOR A PASTOR.
Members of Dr. Brown's Church
Considering His Suc
cessor.
TALKED ABOUT CHARACTER.
The Involved Minister Makes Use of
An Old but Effective Discourse.
Mrs. Cooper's Class.
Who will succeed Dr. C. 0. Brown as
pastor of the First Congregational Church?
The leaders of the opposition to the alleged
dethroned clergyman have reached a point
in their efforts to oust' Dr. Brown which
they believe renders this ; question perti
nent, and numerous possible candidates
are being considered. With the majority
of the members who feel the need of a
new pastor the discussion has now ; about
narrowed down to three clergymen, namely,
Dr. Rader of the Third Com. re Rational
Church of this City, Dr. Hatch of Berkeley
and Dr. Hoyt of Sacramento.
"Dr. Rader and Dr. Hatch are both
youne men of extraordinary ability," said
Dr. McDonald in discussing Dr. Brown's
successor yesterday, "and we all feel that
they will continue to become more and
more useful. It will certainly require a
man of energy to take hold of the church
at this juncture, and both reverend gentle
men seem admirably equipped in this re
gard. There are some who consider that
the situation calls for a man of more
I Luther Fillmore, Formerly Superintendent of the South . Pacific Coast Railroad,
)ir Who Will Soon Retire to Private Life. ,' _ ; .._ Â,. -'a ;
mature judgment, and these point with
commendation to Dr. Hoyt of Sacramento.
Dr. Hoyt is a very able man, universally,
respected, and would no doubt give entire
satisfaction. At this time, however, every
thing is mere conjecture, and none of the
men mentioned have been approached on
the subject."
A rather remarkable feature of the sug
gestion of Dr. Hoyt as a successor to Dr.
Brown is that Dr. Hoyt was known
throughout the council's session as a
warm friend of the accused pastor.
At the services of the First Church yes
terday morning Dr. Brown's sermon was
"The Matchless Character." This is not a
new sermon. The doctor delivered the
same address several months ago, and it
was at the time considered his best effort.
His evening address was also one which
had done service before. At the morning
address the doctor made no allusion to
bis present predicament whatever. The
only suggestion of the cloud hanging over
the minister was the notice for a business
meeting next Wednesday evening. This
notice, which was read by Deacon Morse,
was addressed to W. F. Christensen, clerk
of the church. It was a formal request
that he call a business meeting of the
church for Wednesday evening, April 29.
It was signed by J. A. Hatch, J.Howard
Barnard, J. T. McDonald, J. H. Warren
and Clinton J. Hutchins.
In order to cast discredit upon the no
tice, Deacon Morse stated yesterday after
noon that of the five signers three were
not pewholders and one was a non
resident. He refused to say which was
the competent signer.
Mrs. Cooper, when told of Deacon
Morse's statement, declared that it was
false. As proof of this she pointed out
that J. H. Hatch and J. Howard Barnard
were deacons. Rev. J. H. Warren, she
stated, was one of the earliest ministers of
the church, and Dr. J. T. McDonald and
Clinton J. Hutchins were old and much
respected members of the church.
Both sides are confident of success at the
business meeting Wednesday evening.
: Deacon Morse at first declared that Dr.
Brown would come out of the battle tri
umphant with a majority of three to one.
After considering the matter, however, he
reduced his figures to two to one. His
reason for the reduction was that the peti
tion asking for the pastor's removal, was
signed by people living as far away as
Boston and Detroit, but who were still on
the rolls, and these might come and vote.
Dr. McDonald of the "insurgents" said
he expected the vote to be against Dr.
Brown, yet if it was not it would only de
lay matters a little longer and supply a
few more disgusting details. Dr. Brown's
position now he declared to be untenable
and he must eventually give up.
The hall of the "Native Sons where Mrs.
Cooper's Bible Class convenes was filled
yesterday with an interested audience of
men and women, many of whom took part
in the discussion of the lesson, the subject
of which was "Dives and Lazarus." Among
those who added much to the interest of
the discussion were Judges Currie and
Rosenbaum, several clergymen who were
present, Messrs. Gaden, . Hawley, Tuttle
and Dr. J. T. McDonald, Mesdames Par
ker, Cutler, Tuttle, : McDonald, . Reeves,
Redington and Misses Wyeant, Cooper,
Stovall and Chase. ' Several strangers from
the hotels 'of the City introduced them
selves. It was argued- that riches well
used were a blessing to the. possessor and
to the world. The . mistake of Dives was
that he cared nothing about Lazarus. The
dogs were kinder . to Lazarus than . was
Dives. "This parable 1 shows plainly
that death does not : ' end- all,"
added Mrs. Cooper. '-Both -these
men died. ; Death > is the great lev
eler. Dives could .'â â â¢' take no * luggage
through tbe Custom-house of Death.., Tha
surveyor of that port permits no baggage
to enter. And when Dives leaves his lug
gage behind, what has he left? What
treasure of soul has he? The only wealth
we can carry with us through the gateway
of death is wealth of character, love and
good deeds. They that have soul-trensi-re
are eternally rich. It was essential char
acter that determined the destiny of these
two men. It was by the force of gravita
tion of character that Dives went down
ward." Here followed a very spirited dis
cussion on the doctrine of eternal punish- :
ment. Some believed in that doctrine;
others did not. Mrs. Cooper said: "I be
lieve the law of the spiritual harvest follows
the divinely ordained law of the material
harvest. We reap what we sow, both in
respect to quality and quantity."

FILLMORE HAS RESIGNED
111 Health Forces a Popular
Railroad Man to
Retire.
Under the general management of Mr.
Davis during the time that the South Pa
cific Coast Railroad was owned by the late
Senator J. G. Fair, Luther Fillmore held
the responsible position of general super
intendent. His valuable services were
continued after the road passed into the*
hands of the Southern Pacific Company,
and until ill health caused him to relin
quish his official position. This he has
done by tendering his resignation, which
has been reluctantly accepted by the di
rectors of the company.
About the Ist Mr. Fillmore will leave
California for Wyoming, where he will re
main during the summer in hopes of re
newing his impaired vitality.
By his resignation the Southern Pacific
Company loses a valuable officer and the
employes a kind and considerate superin
tendent, one whose place it will be hard to
fill. He takes with him the best wishes,
not only of his superiors, but of all those
with whom he came in contact in the dis
charge of his official duties. 7.{. -7

MR. DAVID WAGNER.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 21.â 1 have scarcely
been six hours in Fresno, yet I can report
a big success for the Cali.ornian remedy.
While in one of the leadine drug stores of
this city I met Mr. David Wagner. He
has been using Joy's Vegetable Sarsa-
parilla, and he tells me that much of his
robustness is due to this great vegetable
medicine. He assured me that he was in
poor health a few months ago, and, read-
ing some of our advertisements, he de-
cided to try the remedy. The medicine
worked like a charm. His bowels soon be-
came regular, the coating of his tongue
disappeared and he felt better and better
everyday. Said he: "I would not take
fifty dollars for the benefits I have received
from Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla. The
remedy tasted so well at first I thought it
was not medicine. I soon found out the
difference. Joy's Vegetable Sarsaparilla
certainly acts on the bowels and blood.
Look at my face; there 13 not a single
mark on it to show I have been taking a
blood medicine. Many people using blood
remedies have their face and hands and
body all covered with blood spots, pimples i
and blemishes. I can testify that Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla brings out no bad
blood marks, and it does its work, too. I
saw a lady who had used the remedy for
rheumatism, and her rheumatism has left
her. If the druggists here continue to sell
Joy's without trying to substitute, as some
druggists do in Fresno, yon will have a big
sale for Joy' Vegetable | Sarsaparilla this
spring. There ought' to be some way to
prevent druggists substituting. Of course,
in time, people will find out that Joy's
Vegetable Sarsaparilla is the best, and;
when they do find it out for themselves no I
one will be able to make them take a sub-
stitute for the native remedy.

Red Men Marksmen Indulge in
an Old-Time Fatherland
Sport.
NITRO-POWDER IN THE LEAD.
Fine Scores of the Columbias âW.
Glindemann Beits J. Utschig in
a ioo-Shot Match.
There was great shooting and lots of it
yesterday at Captain Biebe's Shell Mound
rifle range, and more good scores were
made by the marksmen than for some
time past. On approaching the range a
strange looking thing was observed. It
appeared like a huge buzzard witn out
stretched wings sitting on the top of a tall
pole. About seventy-five yards away
stood a company of men in the uniform of
the Fatherland soldiery. The latter were
. blazing away with rifles at the thing on
the pole.
An explanation of these proceeding.
was that the Red Men's Shooting Section
was having its annual eagle shoot, a cus
tom brought from the old country. The
eagle was made of wood, painted 'black,
. with a diameter of about three feet. It
â¢ was placed on a forty-foot pole, so placed
on the bay shore that all the bullets fired
in that direction would fly toward
the Golden Gate. Over the body of the
bird was a large iron protecting plate.
Each part, legs, head, wings, neck, etc.,
was attached to the body with wooden
pegs, painted white, so arranged that a
well-aimed bullet would drive them out,
letting each separate part fall to the
' ground. With each part was a prize.
The eagle shooting began at 11 o'clock
in the morning, and the unfortunate bird
was not completely dismembered until
3:30 p. m. All kinds of rifles were used
and many hundred bullets were dropped
far out in the bay. The happiest shooter
ol the day was C. Stein, who by smashing
the last pin in the eagle's breast won the
enviable title of "Scnuetzen Koenig," or
shooting king, and the medal that goes
with the honor. The other prize-winners
and the parts they clipped are the fol
lowing:
First prize, John Tiedeman, crown on the
eagle's head; second, W. Kreutzkainm, sceptre
in right claw; third, H. Bach, reichs-apple in
left claw: fourth, John Feldermann, ring in
beak; fifth, E. Gobel, head; sixth, C. Stein,
neck; seventh and eighth. John Oldag, right
wing and claw; ninth and tenth, John Tres
ter, left wing and claw; eleventh, P. 11. Ruffs,
tail.
The distribution of these prizes and the
crowning of the shooting king will take
place next Sunday evening at the anni
versary and ball that will be held at 620
Bush street.
The Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club held
its regular semi-monthly target-shoot, and
several remarkable records were made
with nitro-powder. In fact, A. H. Pape
broke the club record with this powder.
He is now acting upon the suggestions of
F. O. Young. That is a patch bullet of
pure lead that starts easily from the
breech. He uses Dv Font's nitro measure
for measure with the black powder. In
the record the following remarkable scores
were made, Dr. Rodgers only using black
powder:
Dr. L. O. Kodgers 9 25 927376 7-57
F. O. Young. 1 6 7 6 6 4 4 9 4 9â55
A. H. Pape 6 7344339 3 8-60
A. H. Pape.. 2 48635947 4â62
Pape's twenty shots on the Columbia
target are equal to 448 points on the Ger
man target and his average was bunched l
in a five and one-tenth-inch circle. The
best. rifle scores for the day stood :
Unfred diamond medal, three shots Dr.
Kodztrs 10, H. 11. Burfeind 11, F. O. Young 16.
Ten-shot rifle recordâ A. H. Pape 50 and 52,
F. O. Young 55, Dr. Rodgers 57.
Most fla*s;s for in-centersâ Dr. Rodgers 2, F.
O. Young 1, H. Hellberg 2, H. H. Burfeind 1,
G. Barley 1.
On the 50-yard pistol-range some fine
work was done. Charles Daiss, who so far
has been in the lead on the Blanding
record for the best ten scores, rested on his
laurels and went off on a bicycle jaunt.
While he was^ way Pape got in and ran
up enough high scores to beat Daiss by
three points. Gorman, in half a dozen
strings, made several excellent scores. The
best scores stood :
Open to all comers, pistol, Blanding medal â
J. K. Gorman 7, 9. 11; A. H. Pape 7, 8, 8; F. O.
Young 8. Dr. L. O. Rogers 9, E. Jacobson 17.

contest for the Schumann diamond
medal and the Glindemann-Utschig pri
vate 100-shot match. In the first quite a
number of marksmen entered the contest,
but they were obliged to take off their
hats in honor to Miss Lizzie Utschig, who
won the laurels.
The medal was donated by the pro
prietor of the range for the seven highest
scores made during the year, rest shoot
ing, open to all comers, the winner to hold
the trophy from month to month until
taken by another. Miss Utschig made a
score of 228 rings out of a possible 250.
She was closely followed by D. W. Mc-
Laughlin with 227, Otto Burmeister with
225 and Mrs. John Utschig with 222.
For several days past the 100-shot off
hand match for $40 a side.between William
Glindemann and John Utschig Sr. has at
tracted considerable attention among local
riflemen, for the men are among the crack
shots of their respective clubs. The for
mer is a member of the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club and the latter of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club. The match was
stubbornly contested from the first shot to
the last, and it resulted in Glindemann
winning by 50 points. His score was 2133
to Utschitt's 2083, out of a possible 2500.
D. W. McLaughlin was the highest in
the pistol contest for the Schumann pistol
medal. He made 212 rings out of a pos
sible 250. In the pool-shooting on the
pistol range Philo Jacoby made the high
est score 72 out of a possible 75 points.
J. GEORGE GIBSON ON PAIN â¢
The Pastor of Emmanuel Baptist Church
Addresses a Meeting of Young Men.
The Rev. J. George Gibson, pastor of
Emmanuel Baptist Church, made notori
ous by the murders in its belfry, sang a
solo and delivered an address yesterday
afternoon before a large audience in the
Young Men's Christian Association.
The theme of his songâ "Come Home
My Child"â was in a sense introductory to I
the discourse that followed. His text was
from Ephesians, fourth chapter, nine- !
teenth verse â "Who Be in Past Feeling."
â "â¢ He said that a man must not necessarily
live long to live much, for a young man
may often have deeper experience than
older men have had.
To-day life is much more intense than it
was long ago; childhood has almost van
ished and youths come to maturity almost
before they know what to do with their
hurriedly acquired development. The
young, as opposed to the old, have the
hardest struggle against the evil tenden
cies in their nature.
If a person in beginning worldly life
would carefully consider just what the
possibilities were in' him he might often
be deterred from evil by a realization of
how bad he might really become and
might also be encouragea in good deeds by
knowing his latent antitude for them.
The ostrich has not used its wings to fly
and the male has had little use for eyes,
so nature has gradually made these re
spective organs proportionately unimpor
tant; so it is with unused human faculties.
Man either grows better or he becomes
worse. Long exposure to torture, to dis
appointments and to annoyances may, and
often does, cause a condition where the
person becomes inured to the experience
and is past feeling.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1896.
ALONG THE WATER FRONT
First Squadron Cruise of Co
rinthian Yachts on the
Bay Yesterday.
THE GASOLINE BOAT ARCTURUS
A Sailor Lost From the British Ship
Dittoaâ Repairing of the
Point Arena.
After a week or more of cold, cloud, mist
and rain the bay yesterday was as calm,
warm and bright as a yachtsman could
wish, and certainly the Corinthian Club
people could not have asked more.
It was their first cruising day and the
forecaster was evidently with them. There
was a good wind from the southwest that
took- the winter's twist out of the sheets
and the wrinkles from the canvas that had
been furled lor months. There was a new
ness along the sides of the white hulls and
a brightness over the freshly scraped spars
which made one think the entire Meet had
just slipped from the ways.
The squadron got underway about noon,
led Dy the flagyacht Truant, bearing the
pennant of Commodore Few.
The vessels passed up close in along the
water front, affording the spectators on
the dock a pretty, living marine picture.
The Rover literally hugged tbe ends of the
wharves, with the little spoon-bow of the
Eolus almost overlapping her. The latter
tried several times to pass in between her
rival and the pier heads, but the Rover's
helmsman would throw his vessel against
the piles and cut the other craft out.
There was no attempt to pass the Com
modore, and the boats generally kept their
allotted places in the cruising line.
Opposite the ferry slips the signal was
given to 'bout ship, and the fleet swept
around on their return. With the fair
wind and strong ebb-tide they soon passed
from view around Angel Island to their
moorings off Tiburon.
The new gasoline auxiliary yacht Arc
turus had her initial cruise. She is a pietty
50-foot boat, 36 feet 7 inches water-line, 14
feet beam, 3 feet draught and 7 tons bur
den. She was designed by G. W. G. Hall.
Yesterday the British ship Ditton, Cap
tain Stak, arrived safely, 125 days from
Swansea. On the second night after leav
ing that port John Morrison, an ordinary
seaman, fell from the foretopsail yard into
the sea. He was aloft furling the" canvas
when a quick lurch of the ship flung him
overboard. The weather was rough and
the sea running high, and a boat could
not be launched. Soon after another or
dinary seaman named J. Campbell fell
from the mizzen-topsail yard on deck.
Though dropping from a great height he
suffered no serious injury except the loss
of the sight of one eye.
To-day the old moribund revenue tug
Hartley will return to service, having been
painted and somewhat repaired.
PREPARING THE NEW PARK
Next Sunday Will Probably
See the. Opening at
Ingleside.
GOOD SPORT AT OCEAN VIEW.
Three Coursing Stakes Run to a
Finish Yesterdayâ of
the Events.
Coursing men are looking forward with
considerable interest to the opening of the
new coursing ground at Ingleside, which
is expected to throw open its gates on Sun
day next if the elements and Secretary
Holbrook of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals do not inter
fere.
The new grounds were mainly chosen
for the lay of the ground, which is partic
ularly calculated to give good results and
for their accessibility to the electric-cars
that run to the Ingleside track. - -
Several thousand dollars have been spent
in improving the grounds, a tine grand
stand for those who do not , desire to take
part in the betting being one of the prin
cipal features. 3V -
A number of people visited the new
course yesterday to look over the grounds
and witness the preparations that are be
ing made for the opening.
Several hundred people went to Casserly
& Kerrigan's Ocean View park yesterday
to witness the running, and a fine day's
sport was enjoyed by all. The recent
ruins had made the hares less inclined to
run than usual, but some of the courses
were long and interesting. The dogs on
the average were a fast lot and evenly
matched, and the spectators had a good
day of it. ;_â _ 33Â£
The first event was a sixteen-dog stake,
which was run through as follows:
Twilight beat Kilmore, Pop Larkin beat
London, Diamond beat Galloping, California
Violet beat True Blue, Cottage Boy beat Star
light, Jenny Lind beat Barney, Butcher Boy
beat Unknown, Dublin Stout beat Black Tom.
First tiesâ Twilight beat Pop Larkin, Dia
mond beat Cottage Boy, California Violet beat
Jenny Lind, Dublin Stout beat Butcher Boy.
Second tiesâ Diamond beat Twilight, Dublin
Stout beat California Violet.
Finalâ Diamond beat Dublin Stout.
Four dogs at $2 50 each were then drawn,
the winner to take all. The stake resulted
as follows:
St. Lawrence beat Black Tom, Cottage Boy
beat Bobolink.
Finalâ St. Lawrence bent Cottage Boy.
The last event was an eight-dog consola
tion, which resulted as follows:
Fleetfoot beat Marguerite, Unknown beat
Pop Larkin, Bobolink beat California Violet,
Whip beat Handspring, Lucky Dog beat Quick
step.
First tiesâ Fleetfoot beat Unknown, Bobolink
beat Whip, Lucky Dog a bye.
Finalâ Fleetfoot beat Bobolink.
COMING CYCLING EVENTS
Races and Parades at the Santa
Rosa and Oakland Floral
Fetes.
The Imp.rial Cub Is Seeking New
Quartersâ Golden Gate's
Election. .
The park roads were in very fair condi
tion for cycling yesterday, despite the re
cent heavy rains, and many took ad
vantage of the sunny afternoon for a spin
to the beach. Few ventured into the coun
try, however, and those who did found
little enjoyment for their trouble. As one
club man expressed it, swimming was very
good on the Haywards road, riding being
impossible and walking bad. Most of the
riders took a rest yesterday, and the men
gathered at their clubhouses to talk over
the relay race again and discuss the track
events io be held at the various floral fetes
the next two weeks.
There will be races at Santa Rosa Thurs
day. Friday and Saturday of this week,
and the last day will probably attract a
great many from this City. Friday is May
day, and at the Fabiola floral fete at Oak
land the National circuit will be opened.
The best riders will contest at this meet
and go to Santa Rosa the next day. They
will then have a week's rest and ride again
at San Jose on Saturday, May 9, the last
day of the rose carnival there. ;f;
A grand bicycle lantern parade will be
held in Oakland under the auspices of the
Fabiola floral fete, 1896, race meet com
mittee on the evening of Wednesday,
April 29, in which all clubs and unat
tached wheelmen are cordially invited to
take part. Trophies will be awarded as
follows: (1) To the club making the best
appearance. (2) To the visiting club hav
ing the largest number in line. (3) To
the home club having the largest number
in line. â¢
Visiting clubs are defined to be all clubs
outside of Alameda County, and home
clubs those in Alameda County. .
Mounted police protection is assured and
riders need have no fear as there will be
ample room in the streets for all. to ride
safely. Captains of clubs should see that
their clubs are fully represented, and that
all members turn out to help make this
the grandest lantern-parade ever seen on
the coast. Club 3 will take their positions
in line at the junction of New Broadway
and Telegraph avenue at .7:45 Wednes
day evening.
On *â  the* day of the fete, : Friday, a
special decorated bicycle parade will be
held in conjunction with and to follow the
decorated carriage parade, at the Oakland
Trotting Park at Ip. m. ,3i "â '*â¢â *" 3* ;v3*^
Snecial prizes have been secured to make
the bicycling part of, the floral parade a
grand success. They are as follows:
To the best decorated single wheel a high
grade bicycle. .
For the best decorated groups, including
tandems, etc., $20 cash.
For the club making the best appearance in
the floral parade an elegant piano-lamp and
bionze stand. - â *

The Olympic Club, Wheelmen will hold
a meeting to-morrow evening at the
Olympic Club. Besides the business to be
transacted the amusement committee will
furnish something good in its line.
The Imperial Cycling Club is looking for
larger quarters on account of its, largely
increased membership and is thinking of
moving into the Bay City Wheelmen's
former clubhouse at 519 Van Ness avenue.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club recently
elected the following new road officers':
Joseph Quadt,' captain; William Madden,
first lieutenant; T. Roderick, second lieu

OVERLOOKING THE NEW COURSING PARK AT INGLFSIDE.
. [Sketched by a "Call" artist.]
ARMY CAMPS AGITATED
Officers Unable to Render
Active Service in the
Field.
LISTED FOR RETIREMENT.
The New Post Surgeon at the Presidio.
Fifth Artillery Batteries Exchange
Stations.
Dr. R. H. White, major and surgeon,
U. S. A., will dwell at the Presidio as post
surgeon. This place of abode may not
exactly conform to the doctor's individual
desires, but it seems to accord to General
Graham's notions as to the proper place
for a post surgeon to dwell, and as General
Graham commands the post what he says
goes.
A reporter of The Call was not present
during a recent interview between the
doctor and the post commander, but it is
known that the major, who was recently
ordered to this department from Jefferson
Barracks, Mo., did have a courteous and
most likely a friendly chat with General
Graham. No doubt the latter cordially
welcomed the doctor in a hearty army
fashion to the Presidio, and Dossibly the
doctor, not to be outdone in civility,
praised the beauty of the Presidio and spoke
of the bang-up military aspect of every
thing about the post, from the encnant
ing Alameda to the desolate marsh. This
is mere conjecture, however, but in truth
the doctor did play for an opening, and
when his inning came he gently intimated
that during a previous tour of duty in
this department he was stationed at Angel
Island but was permitted to live in San
Francisco.
General Graham was equal to the occa
sion. He knew that proper quarters for a
i surgeon were not provided at Angel Isl
| and, but at the Presidio it was different.
I The general spoke of the excellent accom-
I modations available at the post on the
I mainland, and would not for a minute
I permit the thought to enter his mind that
j the doctor should be forced to live in the
j City for. lack of suitable quarters at the
Presidio. According to all accounts,
; therefore, tne new doctor will reside at the
post. â "-â¢"Â£"â *Â£:*
Orders for some of the changes of sta
tion have come. General Forsyth, com
manding the Department of California,
has ordered Batteries B and M, now sta
tioned at Fort Canby, to San Francisco.
Battery M goes to the Presidio and B to
Alcatraz. Battery H, Captain Elbridge
R. Hills, goes to Canby, relieving B and
M. Battery E, Captain A. W. Vogdes,
will go from Alcatraz to Fort Mason and
Battery C, Captain Wood, will go from
Alcatraz to the Presidio. Battery I, Cap
| tain George W. Crabb, will go lrom Fort
Mason to the Presidio.
The- independent command at Fort
Mason is assigned to Captain Vogdes.
In the general change Fort Canby loses
one battery and San Francisco gains one.
At Fort Mason this evening a dancing
function will take place, to which many
officers of the army have been invited.
The function is under the direction of
Mrs. Gillette and Mrs. Blunt. The
spacious house, known as the Black Point
residence, will accommodate the guests.
At Angel Island last Friday eveniug
Captain O'Connell, First Infantry, de
livered an 'interesting and instructive
lecture on the "Great Strike of 1894." The
lecture was given in the post chapel and
was largely '.'.tended. . ?7Â£
Should the 12-inch rifle at Fort Point
kick over the bluff and roll into the sea
the excitement in army* circles would be
tame compared with the sensation that has
been produced by a report that paragraph
72 of the revised regulations has been in
voiced to retire several army officers before
they have reached the age of retirement.
As explained in yesterday's Call this
paragraph provides for retirement for
physical disabilityâ that is to say, the in
ability of an officer to undergo the ordi
nary hardships of field service. General
Graham of the Fifth Artillery and Colonel
Shatter of the First Infantry are author
ized to recommend for retirement such
officers in their respective regiments as
are deemed unable to physically sustain
the fatigue of an active campaign.
. Major Darling, Major McCrea and Cap
tain McClellan of the Fifth Artillery and
Captain Pierce, Captain Parker and Lieu
tenant Connolly of the First Infantry are
said to be on the list. ,* -
Officers listed for compulsory retirement
and brother officers in sympathy with
them are not supposed to. kick on parade
or in the press, but at the hotels, clubs and
in private quarters they assert the right of
expressing an opinion, and one opinion is
that Colonel. Shatter is not as well fitted
physically to perform service in the field
as the officers whose retirement fie has
recommended.. *.
. General Graham of the Fifth Artillery
has two years more to serve before attain
ing the age of 'â  retirement. His capacity
for active service in the field or in tiarrison
is not? questioned.' Most of his officers
would prefer a commander of less vitality.
: Colonel A. :S. :â¢"â¢* Kimball, chief quarter
master of the department, will receive bids
until 12 o'cloci. . Monday, May * 11, lor the
construction of a stable at the Presidio.
The work must be done within 120 days
after the contract is signed. It is dis
tinctly provided that the service of labor
ers and mechanics who are â¢ employed in
the work of construction shall be limited
and restricted to eight hours on each cal
endar day. The specifications define ex
actly what kind of material shall be used
and how the work must be done.
Until Tuesday. May 12, bids will be re
ceived by the chief quartermaster for fill
ing in a portion of the marsh lands on the
Presidio reservation. \3 -
Bidders will state the price per cubic
yard for which they will do the entire
work as shown on plan No. 1 or as shown
on plan No. 2, on either of the following
propositions:
1. By leveling the adjacent sand dunes along
the shore of the bay to the grades established
on the plans and filling the adjoining marsh
with the material so obtained as far as it will
go, and by pumping with suction dredgers or
other means from the bay to make the remain
der of the till to the established grades.
2. By leveling the adjacent sand dunes along
the shore of the bay to the grades established
on the plans and filling the adjoining marsh
with the material so obtained as far as it will
go, the remainder of the fill to be made with
material obtained by grading the bluff imme
diately south of and adjoining the marsh to be
filled.
Separate bid will be made for the con
struction of the drain.
The work will be required to be com
menced within fourteen days after the
contract is approved ana must be prose
cuted at the rate of not less than 25,000
cubic yards of filling per month. On one
plan the amount of filling is estimated at
185,000 cubic yards and on the other at
280,000. The eight-hour limitation also
applies to this work.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
A Number of Exciting and Closely
Contested Games Played Yester
day.
The handball courts were crowded
yesterday and several interesting I and
closely contested games were witnessed.
At the San Francisco court a match in
which six well-known players participated

on both sides. Bonnet and Feeney had in
a measure their revenge, as they defeated
Donnelly and Linehan in a match the
best two out of tbree by winning in two
straight games. . .
The- attraction at the Union court was a
match between Charles Curtis, the South

champion of Hayes Valley. Friends of
the champion^ filled the gallery and
cheered their favorite on to victory. They
were well matched and the final game
was won by Young by only one ace.~ An

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
This week for Santa Rosa.
The last festival is always the best.
In the glory of her gay fiesta Santa
Rosa will be wholly roses.
Monopoly talks of refunding, but the
people demand foreclosure.
The California delegation should take a
look at the National Convention before it
leaps.
It is only reasonable to expect that our
genial sun will show himself at some of
the festivals.
Every man who assists in making San
Francisco a home market helps home in
dustries to revive.
It begins to look as if we will have to
meet the funding bill at tnis session and
fight it to a finish.
The hotel men will not carry away the
idea that California is in any very oppres
sive need of irrigation.
If the Populists help the Democrats out
of the hole this year they will be in the
hole themselves next year.
There will be many a bolt in the Demo
cratic convention, but not one of the kind
that holds the party together.
There is a growing suspicion in the
startled East that Tillman wishes to pitch
fork himself into the Presidency.
The bicycle trade is said to be keeping
up with the bicycle racers in breaking
records, and the business is scorching.
The tariff plank in the Democratic plat
form this year will be planed down to the
most unobtrusive smoothness ever seen.
In Pennsylvania, where spring started
in with torrid weather, there has been al
ready an outbreak of forest fires to help it
along.
Before this week closes the Republicans
of California will be virtually ready to
make it unanimous for an unpledged dele
gation.
The Populists of the Southern States are
infusing a snap into the campaign by
denouncing the Democratic Bourbons as
'â¢Fraudocrats."
We may now expect the Huntington
rush to take place any day, and California
interest in the proceedings of Congress
will be lively.
An early adjournment of Congress will
please everybody, provided it doesn't oc
cur before the passage of the immigration
restriction bill. 3Â«>3
Powers has introduced Huntington's
Scheme to the House, but perhaps the
members will refuse to recognize it far
enough to take it up.
Many a bill rustled through the House
has been made to go slow in the Senate,
and the refunding scheme will doubtless
prove to be one of them.
The California delegation has now a
great chance to distinguish itself in main
taining the interests of the Government
and the rights of the people against the
monopoly.
Whoever is nominated at St. Louis will
be the next . President of the United
States, and loyal Republicans will not
quarrel among themselves as to which
favorite shall win.
It is asserted by well-posted men in
Washington that Cleveland believes he has
made everything safe for a gold bug plat
term at Chicago, and is now thinking
about the candidate. .'**Â»;*"
There are people who are urging it as a
serious proposition that Harrison made a
strong play for a re-election to the Presi
dency when he married a widow and
broke away from his son Russell.
There is a movement among the Silver
Democrats of the . Mississippi Valley to
make a ticket of Boies and Bland, and if
carried through the platform will proba
bly be made up of buncomb and bosh.
Don't forget that The Call, is the only
morning paper in San Francisco that re
ceives the United Press dispatches. If
you wish to get all the news and get it ac
curate you must read The Call every day.
It is reported that in a recent hot spell
in Australia honey was melted in the bee
hives and smothered the bees, thus af
fording a curious parallel to the industrial
hot wave in this country that melted the
free-trade tariff and smothered the Demo
crats. . .- *3.3333 3 , - .
The Republican party has not only
many strong men as candidates* for the
Presidency, but many strong measures for
them to advocate. Protection, bimetal
lism, reciprocity, internal improvements
and subsidies for American shipping
make in the aggregate as great a policy as
any party ever undertook. In the mean
time Democracy is up a tree, and a dead
tree at that. *333
THE EAILEOAD BILL.
Chairman Powers has presented the ma
jority report of the Senate Committee on
Pacific Roads for the refunding of the debt
owed by the aided railroads. It contains
the familiar features upon which the roads
have insisted, and therefore contains noth
ing new. The report accompanying the
bill, however, is so remarkable a produc
tion that it cannot be permitted to pass
I without notice. It is a special plea from
j the railroad point of view, and embodies
| the glaring misrepresentations which have
been so often refuted and without which
the presentation of the j bill would have
been impossible. It studiously ignores
every argument against refunding, and
could not have been more unfair and
partisan had it been written by the rail
road attorneys themselves. . ' s .
It cays, for instance, that "the acts of
.Congress prescribing the provision to be
made by the companies for the repayment
of bonds and the interest thereon have all
been fully complied with by the com
panies." It confesses, however, that the
acts passed to provide for this discharge of
the debts have not succeeded in accom
plishing that end. This has reference
principally to the Tburman act, which
provided for a sinking fund. Thus the
report places all the blame for the failure
on the acts of Congress and none whatever
on the aided roads. It completely ignores
the notorious fact that the earnings of the
Central Pacific were not only crippled by
the building of the Southern Pacific to
j New Orleans and by a necessary division
of the traffic, but were actually and de
liberately used in building up the Southern
Pacific, probably for the express purpose
of preventing the accumulation of an ade
quate sinking fund for the Central Pacific
and the payment of its debt by that means.
The impoverishment of that fund has
given an excuse for refunding, and that
was doubtless what the Central Pacific was
aiming to accomplish. Meanwhile the
owners of the road have enjoyed those
earnings and the Government has been
deprived of them. Was that a full compli
ance with the provisions of the acts?
The entire report bristles with evidence
of this eager partisanship. Bald misstate
ments abound. It asserts that for the
Government to enter into possession would
necessitate the immediate payment of $61,
--385,000 of first mortgage bonds, and ig
nores the fact that the holders of the bonds
are not only willing but too anxious
to accept Government bonds in their stead
bearing a low rate of interest. The report
assumes that foreclosure would result in
Government ownership, whereas no ground
whatever for such an assumption exists,
for as the Central Pacific is the shortest
and most valuable overland road and
would yield handsome revenues under
honest management it would undoubtedly
find purchasers at a handsome figure.
The excuse for the bill is the cool as
sumption that the roads will be more hon
est in the future than in the past. In
order, however, to provide against possible
dishonesty the bill increases the security.
That is a curiously paradoxical position.
The increase of the security will only make
foreclosure in case of default more diffi
cult. Meanwhile the Southern Pacific can
play with another competing road from
California to Salt Lake the old trick tU3t
it played upon the Central Pacific in order
to avoid paying the debt hanging over it.
A DEFECTIVE LAW.
The Sacramento Bee has bad a remark
able experience with the libel laws and is
justly dernanaine that they be amended.
As the matter is of great importance, af
fecting the cenera! community as well as
threatening the entire press of the State,
the history of the case will prove instruct
ive.
In August, 1892, a Sacramento merchant
was arrested on complaint of a woman ser
vant charging him with criminal assault.
The Bee, following one of the most firmly
established rules of journalism, secured an
interview with the woman, in which she
gave the particulars of the assault,
although her statement, unlike the com
plaint, was that only an attempt at as
sault had been made. In the same article
giving this interview and the news of the
issuance of the warrant the Bee published
an interview with the merchant, in which
a denial of the truth of the charge was
made. All this, as every newspaper pub
lisher is aware, was following an estab
lished rule of newspapers to publish both
sides of a serious charge in the main
tenance of a perfectly fair and impartial
attitude.
The examining magistrate held the mer
chant to answer on the woman's charge,
but the defendant was discharged on
habeas corpus proceedings. He then
brought a suit for damages in $50,000
against the Bee. The case was tried in the
Superior Court without a jury and judg
ment was rendered against the Bee for
$500. The Supreme Court has recently
sustained an appeal from this judgment.
While the text of that decision is not at
hand, the inference seems to be that news
papers run counter to the law of libel
under this decision when they publish, in
addition to the allowable news furnished
by a criminal complaint, the detailed
statement of the complaining witness,
even though the defendant's contrary
statement is published at the same time
and no desire to work him an injustice is
presumable.
This is the Bee's interpretation of the
decision, and it is the best position to
understand the matter. The law as it
stands thus puts a severer gae on the
press of this State than exists in any other
civilized country, and it is one that ex
poses the public as â¢ well .as the press to a
wide range of dangers. It is, therefore,
incumbent on the newspapers of Califor
nia to urge such an amending of tbe law
as will make it conform to modern ideas
of liberty and enlightenment.
DECREASING REVENUES.
Our Democratic friends will have some
difficulty in explaining a number of things
when the campaign is fairly opened. As
yet they have given us no intimation of
the line of defense they propose to take.
The country is greatly interested over
guesses as to how the Democrats can ex
plain away the* relation between decreased
internal revenues and free, trade. By
attempting to increase revenues for gov
ernmental through a tax on in
comes the Democratic party confessed that
it did not expect the Wilson-Gorman tariff
to produce as large revenue customs as a
protective tariff did, bat doubtless the
party never took - into account the possi
bility of free trade curtailing internal rev
enues as well. It is true that an increase
of 20 cents a gallon was made in the tax
on spirits, but the assumption is that this
was expected to produce a clear increase in
internal revenues to that extent.
Doubtless Mr. Cleveland has been aston
ished as well as dismayed to discover that
even with this increase in the tax on spirits
the internal revenues have fallen off enor
mously since the Wilson-Gorman bill went
into effect in October. 1894. The bill had
been in force for nineteen months down to
the close of * last month. But during that
time the internal revenue receipts were
$201,069,8123 as against $231,222,122 for the
first nineteen months during which the
THE SAN FRANCISCO : CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1896.
McKinley law was in force. This is a dif
ference of more than $30,000,000. and we
may expect the monthly average to con
tinue until the present tariff is abolished
for a protective measure.
Nothing else should have been expected.
When producers and manufacturers are
compelled to go out of business by reason
of impossible competition with the cheap
standards of Europe there is bound to be
financial distress. Hard times make econ
omy necessary, and the internal revenues
must suffer.in consequence. .
While this deficit in internal revenues is
going bravely on there is, of course, a sim
ilar deficit in revenues on imports. The
total customs receipts for the first nine
teen months of the McKinley tariff were
$566,019,004, and those of the Wilson-
Gorman tariff for a similar period were
$481,423,501, showing a difference of over
$85,000,000 for only nineteen months. This
is particularly instructive, in view of the
fact that one of the most stoutly urged
Democratic objections to a protective
tariff was that it could not produce suffi
cient revenues, and that the encourage
ment of importations by offering low im
port charges under free trade would vastly
Increase the revenues.
Thus Democratic free trade has reduced
both import and internal revenue receipts.
And yet these are but the smallest of its
evils. In the hardships and ruin that
have been imposed on American indus
tries we see the deeper and more far
reaching effects of this un-American idea.
HARMONY AND PROGRESS.
The movement for the consolidation of
all the improvement clubs of the City is
the most encouraging evidence of an in
telligent co-operation that has ever ap
peared in the growth of San Francisco.
It points to an early breaking down of sec
tional jealousies, to a fairer distribution of
municipal funds for public improvements,
and to the wider cultivation of a progres
sive spirit.
The improvement clubs, as we under
stand them, are those which have been or
ganized in certain districts for improve
ments within restricted limits. Besides
seeking to secure for themselves a fair
share of the public funds, these districts
cultivate public spirit among their resi
dents, to the end that improvements prop
erly made by private expenditure shall
receive prompt attention. These are
strictly sectional organizations, and they
have been accomplishing a great deal of
good for themselves directly and for the
City at large indirectly. Besides these are
comprehensive organizations working to
the same end on somewhat different lines.
They are not organized by districts, but
are composed of residents from all parts
of the City. Among these are the Mer
chants' Association, the Boulevard Asso
ciation, and the Cycling Board of Trade.
No scheme for the organization of im
provement clubs would be complete with
out including them.
The plan of organization contemplates a
central working body com posed of repre
sentatives of the various component
bodies. This central body will sit as a
court of justice and promotion. The
power which it will be able to wield will
be enormous, and care will have to be
taken that this power be not abused. So
far as we are informed the idea in its
present shape is a novelty, and as such it
will be an experiment requiring the
highest judgment in its trial. Not the
least of its difficult problems which will
show themselves will be a wise adjust
ment of the needs of the City in the way
of improvements and the public ability to
supply them. In weighing this matter
the best method for raising money will be
quite as important as the amount required.
It is sufficient for the present merely to
hint at these matters. The main thing
now is to congratulate the City on the
birth of a true co-operative spirit that will
eventually redeem the City from its present
backwardness and set it fairly in the road
to the greatness which awaits it. From
considering the immediate needs of the
City itself this movement will be extended
in time to the fostering of the State condi
tions on which the prosperity of the City
depends. As the metropolis of California
San Francisco has a duty lying far be
yond the municipal boundaries.
COAST 'EXCHANGES.
The Yreka Journal says that James
Palmer, J. A. Davis, David E. Miles and
W. J. Branstetter have incorporated the
McCloud Valley Railroad with a capital of
$1,000,000 and that construction will
soon begin. The road is to run from Mott
into Squaw Valley to tap the splendid for-,
ests of sugar pine and spruce abounding
on the great plateau south of Mount
Shasta, and will ultimately be extended
to Lassen County. Our exchange there
fore predicts lively times for the mountain
region of Northern California. The tim
ber region to be penetrated contains, next
to the region along the upper Rogue River
in Oregon, the finest and most extensive
body of sugar pine in the world. . \7
The San Bernardino Index furnishes
complete particulars of the transfer of the
Nevada Southern Railroad under foreclos
ure sale. It was bought by an Eastern
company, which intends to extend the
road to Good c Springs, Nevada. Concern
ing the plans of the company its attorney,
Judge Dillon, said:
"Our company will proceed in a novel
manner in the way of construction and
will put into service one thing which is
entirely new. The California Eastern
Transportation Company will ? precede the
California Eastern Railroad Company,
and the former will be operated by means
of steam wagonsâ motocycles. These will
be used for the double purpose of carrying
on the work of the transportation com
pany and making the grade for the exten
sion of the road. We believe that they
can be operated successfully and more
economically than teams, and will serve
to establish a line through to Goode
Springs at once."
Meanwhile the San Bernardino Times-
Index confirms the rumor that the Santa
Fe is preparing to make provision for the
approaching loss of the Atlantic and Pa
cific. The Southern Pacific will likely re
sume possession of that part between Mo
jave and The Needles, and the stretch
from The Needles- to Albuquerque will be
sold under execution. The Santa Fe,
therefore, is preparing to build from Bar
stow and take in Victor and Oro Grande
on the northeasterly march. With the
Southern California line already in its pos
session the Santa Fe will have a complete
and independent | system penetrating the
southern end of the State. " 'â 
A curious example of the benefits accru
ing from railroad competition is furnished
thus by the Orange County Herald:
As a result . of the ; opening of the new
electric line from Los Angeles to Santa
Monica the railroads between those two
points have : dropped the fare down to 35
cents, and there is* a probability that it
will yet be reduced to 25 cents. - - **
\ Hitherto the Southern Pacific Company
held a monopoly of this traffic.
If the announcement made by the San
Bernardino Times-Index ,on the authority
of 0. D. Gass is true, Southern California
has discovered a new source of wealth not
inferior to Its petroleum deposits. Mr.
Gass says he has found a ledge of coal in
Richie Canyon that is fourteen feet in
width on the surface and which he has
traced for a considerable distance. He
says the coal is bituminous and of excel
lent quality, and states that he will thor
oughly exploit the indications. Thus far
the "coals" discovered south of Mount
Diablo have been lignites. As a rule the
geological indications are not favorable to
the discovery of true coal, but as Califor
nia is constantly presenting surprises the
incredible may be expected to happen at
time. :*."'-
The Stockton Independent says: Plans
have been filed with the County Recorder
for a large creamery to be erected in Wood
bridge. The plans bear the names of many
well-known ranchers from that part of the
country, among whom are H. Beckman,
John Keller, R. J. Parsons, William Beck
man, W. Lanherst, J. Hutchins, H. C.
Beckman, J. C. Thompson, F. W. Edson,
T. E. Jones, H. F. Beckman, George M., J.
S., Walter and- Ado Pittman, David Ket
tleman, A. H. Cowell, A. Boyce and Al
fonso Jones. The growth of the dairy in
terest has been so rapid within the last
three years that the time is near when
California will be an exporter instead of
an importer of butter and cheese.
The Fresno Watchman furnishes encour
aging news from the new oil region in the
Coast Range foothills near Coalinga,
southwest of Fresno. Wells are being rap
idly sunk, some already producing gener
ously, and now there is a movement on
foot for a refinery.
It has been so long since Bodie was at
the height of its fame through its rich gold
mines that it is encouraging to see the
Mining Index of that place calling atten
tion to the still undeveloped mineral
wealth of that district and the ease ann
profit with which it may be brought to light
by the employment of electric power.
Says our contemporary:
If these mines, operated in a small way,
with limited facilities, return to practical
men twice as much for their labor as they
can earn elsewhere, besides paying a gen
erous royalty to the owners, how much
more could they be made to yield if oper
ated on an extensive scale, in a compre
hensive manner?
The Los Angeles Times, discussing the
recent wonderful gold discovery in the Mo
jave Desert already announced by The
Call, corroborates the first report that
the ore yields almost incredible returns.
The ledge is at Randsburg, fifty miles
northeast of Mojave. The average yield is
about $65 a ton. A new vein, discovered
by H. C. Ramey and B. B. Somers, runs
from $8000 to $10,000. The vein is inclosed
in a mica schist formation, and the ques
tion is as to whether it will hold out. Our
exchange adds:
Unfortunately, there are some serious
drawbacks to the development of the
Randsburg properties. There is no mill
there for reducing the ore, and all the
water used has to be hauled from Cow
Wells, twelve 'miles distant, and sells for
$2 a barrel. Water for milling purposes
could be had, however, by boring at a
point only six or eight miles distant. There
is a small mill at Cow Wells, but it is ut
terly inadequate to the demand, and at
present ore is piled on every dump, wait
ing for the mill. Mr. Smith believes that
electricity will eventually solve the prob
lem for this and hundreds of other mining
properties in the desert region which are
now practically unproductive for lack of
power to operate mills. The distance to
Kern River is only thirty-two miles. If
the abundant energy which that river could
furnish were conducted by wire to these
mines it would result in industrial activity
in this whole region, and the development
of untold wealth. : '
It seems odd that a delightful town
which never has any really cold weather
should be called Winters, and that is what
has set the Winters Express to telling of
the superb attractions offered by that
choice spot in the Sacramento Valley.
Its shipping of fruit to the Golden Gate
City is only a fourth, and a small quarter
at that, of its production. From Winters
200 cars carry green fruit to the East, and
it takes seventy cars filled with dried fruit
to partly meet Eastern requirements. Be
sides this it has numerous other indus
tries and a long list of opportunities for
the profitable investment of capital.
According to the Santa Maria Times,
Someo, the present terminus of the Santa
Margarita terminus of the Southern Pa
cific, is growing rapidly. Lumber is al
ready on the ground for a large hotel.
The Otay Press thus announces a valua
ble discovery:
Few people are aware that hazel nuts, so
common to people from the Middle States,
can be successfully raised in this portion
of the State. They have been tried, how
ever, with great success. They will bear
abundantly from the first year of planting,
and the second and third year they will
produce nuts plentifully enough to insure
a very handsome profit to the grower.
The market price of hazel nuts is from 12
to 15 cents per pound, and tt ose who have
tried them state that from $500 to $1000 per
acre can be made in their culture.

E. D. Kelly, president of the Nevada Press
Association, who is here with the members of
the organization from the Sagebrush State, is
the oldest caitor in Nevada.
He has had a career full of interest, and as
owner and editor of the Reno Journal, a min
ing silver paper, he has made himself felt in
his State. But he started and successfully con
ducted several other papers "before he settled
down at Reno.
Mr. Kelly was in the famous White Pine ex

was a hustling camp. Likewise he has been m
many other like places, visiting them and hav

Eight years later I took the material to Elko
and established the Elko Independent, a paper
that is running yet and the editor is here.
"I sold out the Independent and returned to
Humboldt County,giocatlng at Wlnnemncca.
where I started the Silver. State. I ran that
paper twenty years and then sold out and
bought the State Journal at Reno.
"I took charge in January, 1891, and am
publishing a daily and weekly. The paper is

I would go for any tariff or none, to remone

and give his heart to the one God of Christ
endom. 3*3
It was not an entirely new experience to
Wong Lung, for he had once before signi
fied a conversion and had joined the Pres
byterian mission in Chinatown. But he
was a backslider of the most pronounced
type, according to his own statement. For
two years he had ceased to attend the
meetings and had fallen in such evil ways
as have their outward forms in fan-tan
and the burning of incense and the pros
tration of the body before the moved
joss. For two years he had passed by the
Presbyterian mission on the other side,
with no signs that he would ever cross
over again.
Then the Salvation Army, with its ban
ners and drums, marched across the plaza,
up into Chinatown and established meet
ing-place in the 800 block of Sacramento
Btreet and invited the heathen to come
and learn of the Cristian God, as they
taught of him.
Two American women, wearing the red
badge, officered the army and the troops

and "Chinese Mary," said to be the only
Chinese woman soldier in the world. They
rented a cottage in the 900 block on the
same street, and the four of them, with
Captain King, a German, went to house
keeping there.
The Chinese corps, as it is called,
quickly became one of the features of
Chinatown. The natives came to the
meetings through curiosity and read upon
the walls the strange texts of the Chris
tian Bible, printed in their own heathen
characters and heard the sons of the
strange God to the thrumming accompani
ment of the banjo and the sonorous wail
of the concertina. For Captain Jackson,
who led the invasion, can play very well
upon this as well as upon the piano, which
also has a place there. And when they
are all goingâ for Jo Kirn plays the con
certina and Lieutenant Jones the banjoâ
and the Chinese audience, each individual
of which has selected his own key, is try
ing to follow the tune, the effect is such as
to appeal strongly to the Chinese musical
ear.
The station met with remarkable success
from the day of the opening on the 18th
of March, and the red badge of the Salva
tionist is beginning to add its distinct
touch to the prosaic of color in the streets
of Chinatown. Captain Jackson places the
number of conversions at about eighty in
the short time, and of these about fifty are
wearing the cap and ribbon. There are no
women. Chinese Mary has still no com
panion of her sex in the ranks.
Wong Lung was among those whose
curiosity led him to follow the flag and
drum into the little meeting-house, and,
being interested, he went again ana again,
and last night he capitulated, and there
was great rejoicing, as *. there is with every
addition to the fast widening fold.
7 He had f been persistently besieged by
the officers and the' soldiers and last night
he consented to be led up to the bench and
kneeled down ; with Captain Jackson and
Lieutenant Jones and Jo Kirn, and' while,
they prayed and sang â they and the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1896.
houseful of soldiers and:auditors-he was
won. When he announced that he had
been fully persuaded to be a Christian the
entire corps sprang up with cries of halle
lujah and the waving of handkerchiefs and
the beating. of the bass drum. Jo Kirn
threw his arms around Wong Lung and
danced a waltz quite after the Christian
fashion.
The noisy rejoicings continued for some
minutes and then the little corps of sol
diers gathered about the new convert and
begged him to say something. And he
did. Speaking in his native Chinese he
said what has been already said about
him: that he was a backslider of the worst
type, but that he had now resolved to be
true to his new faith and give up every
thing to follow its teachings.
Wong is not an ill-looking Chinaman
and his pronouncing himself a superla
tively wicked man must be taken in the
same light with which St. Paul called him
self the chiefest of sinners when he was
really a very proper kind of manâ that
self-abasement that is characteristic of the
lately converted Christian.
Two conversions were registered in this
fashion at the Chinatown station yester
day. Captain Jackson says that the con
verts are undoubtedly sincere.
So much has the station attracted the
sightseers of Chinatown that it has been
j found necessary to place a guard at the
door, who forbids the entrance of any but
soldiers of the army and Chinamen, as
the station directs its undivided attention
to the redemption of the heathen. Of all
the converts not one has been regularly
sworn into the army as yet. A certain
period of probation is necessary before
that ceremony takes place. On that date,
which is some two months remote, how
ever, there will probably be an exciting
time in Chinatown.
The services are held in both English
and Chinese. Neither Captain Jackson nor
Lieutenant Jones knows anything of the

language of the heathen, but their earnest
ness makes itself understood, and Jo Kirn
and Chinese Mary do the exhorting in the
native tongue. " 3
Jo Kirn is a very intelligent young man
and in his enthusiasm a typical Salvation
ist. He . has been a sworn-iu soldier for
some time and has application in for a
commission. *
Chinese Mary was converted nine
months ago at Santa Rosa and she was
sworn in three months ago. She does not
aspire to be an officer, but is content to
work in the ranks. And she is a hard
worker, too. No one enters into conver
sation with her, be they Christian or
heathen, without being questioned as to
the state of their soul. *
Captain Jackson, in charge of the sta
tion, has traveled all over the coast, her
work being chiefly that of founding new
stations and corps, at which, with Lieu
tenant Jones, she has been very success
ful.

THE FORWARD MOVEMENT
A Series of Sermons to Be
Preached in Unitarian
Churches.
The Church and Its Relations to the
Social end Industrial Problems
of Life.
The Rsv. Horatio Stebbins exchanged
pulpits with the Rev. E. D. Payne .of
Berkeley yesterday. A series of six ser
mons are to be given by the Unitarian
ministers on questions touching on the
doctrines of their church and social and
economical issues, otherwise known as
"The Forward Movement." Mr. Payne
discussed "The Unitarian Church and
Social Amelioration" at the First Uni
tarian Church yesterday morning. There
was a large attendance and the discourse
was listened to with much attention.
Mr. Payne, undertook to show that the
so-called economic system of this day
and generation was sorely in need of
amendment. ;. ""."'"* .7 ~7
"It needs to be rationalized," he said,
"and what is true of our economic system
is also true of our civil and political ar
rangements. All need to be rationalized
until we have a free an out and out dem
ocracy of the people and for the people." .
Speaking of the position of the Uni
tarian church on these questions he de
clared that it had to assume some attitude.
"I believe," he said, "that our church
should establish a free forum; should open
up the pulpits to the discussion and study
of economic problems; should make these
great economic problems a part of church
work." 33-33
Mr. Payne expressed the hope that the
day would never come in these United
States when an aristocracy, moneyed or
otherwise, should grow up in this country
and conflict with the rights and privi
leges of the people.
Mr. Payne will speak on this subject at
the Second j Unitarian Church next Sun
day. . At the evening services in the First
Church the Rev. A. J. Wells discussed
"The Deeper Life." At the Second Uni
tarian Church yesterday morning Rev.
W. G. Eliot Jr. spoke on "The Life and
Organization of a Unitarian Church,'' and
in the evening Dr. Stebbins discussed
"The Contentment of Christian Faith."
Both services were largely attended.

THE GOING OUT
OF HARRY McGILL.
Promised to Return to Din-
Missing for Three
Months. -
KNEW TRADE SECRETS.
Men in Yokohama Who Were
Interested in Watching His
Movements.
THE DETECTIVES MYSTIFIED.
Left All His Personal Effects Behind.
Was Warned of a Spy Fol
lowing Him.
The going out of Harry McGill has mys
tified and troubled his friends in this City
not a little. Diligent search and inquiry
have been made, but no trace of him has
been found. For three months he has
been missing from his home with the Mc-
Clure family, at 1459 Guerrero street. He
promised to return for dinner and had an
engagement with two ladies that evening.
The Police Department has struggled
with the case fruitlessly. Detective An
thony was given the case for some time,
but he was unable to solve the mystery.
There are grave fears of foul play, for it is
known that McGill had enemies who were
at least interested in watching his move
ments. He was the custodian, also, of im
portant business secrets, some of which, it
is thought, he must have revealed to the
Pacific Mail Company just before his dis
appearance.
Saturday, February 1, Henry A. Mc-
Gill, a young man 24 years of age, lately a
resident of Yokohama, Japan, left the
residence of William McClure, chief engi- v
ncr of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's steamer City of Peking, 1459 Guer
rero street, where he was stopping, for a
short visit downtown and has never been
seen by them since. .'33
McGill was well known in business
circles in Yokohama, being connected
with the well-known firm of T. M. Laffin
& Co., ship chandlers and stevedores of
that city. He had resided there for six
years. Every American vessel visiting
that port had more or less dealings with
the firm through young McGill, and he
was very generally liked and respected for
his good business and social qualities.
He resigned bis position with the firm
and went to Kobe, from which port he
took passage on the Rio Janeiro for San
Francisco early in November. He arrived
here via Yokohama on the 2Ctli of that
month, putting uo at the Golden West
Hotel. January 4 he went to reside with
Mrs. McClure, whose son, George Morse,
engineer on the Zealandia and formerly
on the Pacific Mail steamer China run
ning to Yokohama, was about the only
acquaintance he had in this City on his
arrival. v33^ â¢ -\- â¢ ,
It is now learned that McGill and his
employer, T. M. Laffin, had a disagree
ment and McGill resigned his position,
though Mr. Laffin made strenuous efforts
to retain him and made him very tempt
ing offers. 33 :3
McGill, in his capacity of bookkeeper
and clerk of the firm, was fully acquainted
with certain transactions and business
methods carried on between Laffin & Co.,
who had a valuable billet with the Pacific
Mail Company, and some of the Yokohama
employes of the company.
McGill had an idea that Laffin feared he
would reveal these transactions if he came
to America, and he believed it was only
this fear which made Laffin so anxious to
retain him. It was for this reason and
because he thought Laffin might seek to
prevent his departure for America that
McGill went to Kobe and took passage
there instead of embarking at Yokohama.
After his arrival in this City McGill was
warned several times by a friend whom he
had met in Yokohama that he was being
shadowed by a man sent from that city for
the purpose of observing if he communi
cated with the Pacific Mail Authorities,
and probably with a view of preventing
him from doing so. If such was the case
the espionage was fruitless, for McGill did
have a conference of several hours' dura
tion with the general manager of the com
pany some days before his disappearance.
The news came by the City of Peking,
which arrived Friday, of some startling
changes at tho Yokohama end of the line.
â T. M. Laffin & Co. it appears have lost
their good paying billet, and Captain W.
A. Wall, tug and lighter master, and his
forman have been discharged. 33333
McGill . told | his friends here that an
agent of the Pacific Mail Company ap
proached him on the. steamer at Yoko
hama and offered to refund him the money
he had paid for his ticket to San Francisco
at Kobe and give him a free passage, but
that he had declined to accept it, saying
that he was , able to pay for his passage
with his own money. It is known that on
the Monday following the.disappearance of
McGill an important written communica
tion was sent to him from the office of the
Pacific Mail Company in this City.
"We are all greatly worried over the dis
appearance of Mr. McGill," said Mrs. Mc-
Clure, the wife of the chief engineer of the
City of Peking, to a .Call reporter at her
residence, 1459 Guerrero street, yesterday
afternoon. ."All of us were very fond of
bim. Ho had a gentle disposition, no bad
habits and was very considerate of the
younger members of my household. His
relatives live in Nebraska and Illinois. He
became intimate with my son, George
Morse, when the latter was running as an
engineer on steamers of the Pacific Mail.
On the arrival of the Rio on November 26
George met young McGill on the dock and
subsequently induced him to visit me and
my family. We all liked him so well that
I invited him to make my house his home.
He gave up his room in!; the Golden West
Hotel and about, the first of the year
moved bis belongings to an apartment in
my residence. He was with us about a
month before he disappeared, but during
that short stay he endeared himself to all
of us.
: "He was delighted with his surround
ings, and frequently spoke. of 'home life'
as being a new and very enjoyable experi
ence. 3He addressed me as 'ma' and
treated me with ' the same courtesy and
affection as my own son. When he first
came ' here he gave me - $85, all of the
money" he possessed, to keep for him.
From time to time he asked me for sums
of $5 and $10 for petty expenses. His re
taxations and diversions were those of a
gentleman, and consisted of . visits to the
theaters and other places of interest in the
City, always accompanied by George
Morse or one of his sisters.
"Harry had a splendid wardrobe and
wore handsome jewelry, including a dia
mond ring and scarf pin. His jewelry is
believed to have been worth at least $500.
He became so fond of his home, the first
he had enjoyed since a child, he seldom
left the house. Frequently I urged him
to co out if only for the air and outdoor
exercise. He was a reflective young man,
and I often noticed him wrapped in study.
But he was full of fun and mischief, and a
great favorite with the young folks of my
household. On the Saturday of his disap
pearance, at an early hour in the forenoon,
he asked me for $10, which I gave him.
Ten dollars then remained of the original
deposit.
"Ho made an appointment with my
self and young daughter to meet us at 2:30
o'clock in the afternoon here at the house
for dinner and to escort us to Oakland,
where we were to bid a friend good-by.
Harry left my presence with a smile on
bis lace, and I have never seen him
since that morning. lam always looking
for his return and fight against the
thought that he has been foully dealt
with and probably killed. Still, if he were
alive and well I know he would communi
cate with either George or myself. He left
all his wardrobe and all of his little and
necessary belongings. 333 7;
"I forgot to say Harry told us when he
left the house that Saturday morning he
might hunt up and call on a young lady
lately arrived from Seattle whom he knew
in that city. He. knew she was in San
Francisco; had met her on the street, and
spoke of meeting her again on that Satur
day morning merely as a probability. He
spoke so lightly of the matter no one even
asked him the name of the visitor from
Seattle. Harry's disappearance was not
reported to the police for several days be
cause I did not needlessly care to pain
him.
Four or five d ays after he vanished the
detectives were notified and Officer
Anthony, after a long delay, was assigned
the duty of finding something definite
about the boy's absence. He finally re
ported to me here at home no trace of
Harry could be found and indifferently
expressed the theory he had been drugged
and shipped aboard a vessel bound for the
North Pacific. He also was anxious to
learn if there was any reason existing to
prevent Harry from returning to Japan.
We know that Harry left Yokohama pos
sessed of the esteem of all who knew him
save, perhaps, several persons with whom
he had differed on apparently trivial
matters.
â - If Harry is found and in need it is my
wish that I be communicated with at once.
I have found among his effects nothing to
indicate the exact. place of residence of any
of his family connections or Eastern
friends, if indeed the poor lad really had
any Eastern friends."
AT THE THEATERS.
The Attractions That Are to Be Offered
to the Patrons of the Various
Places of Amusement.*
William H. Keith, the California bary
tone, is to appear to-night at the Columbia
to assist Rivarde, the Franco-Spanish vio
linist, who is to make his debut at this
house. _ A fine programme has been pre
pared.
At the Baldwin Theater Richard Mans
field is to appear this evening as Baron
Chevrial in the startling play entitled "A
Parisian Romance." He will be sup
ported by Miss Beatrice Cameron in the
character of Rosa.
Roland Reed is to continue in stage
politics this evening at the California
Theater. The play in which he and Isa
dore Rush appeared during the past week,
"The Politician," has proved a great
success. 3' â¢ ~
A play with a military tinge is to
be presented at the Grand Opera-house
this evening. It is entitled "Lady Lil,"
and is founded on incidents of the Austro-
Prussian war of thirty years ago.
'â¢My Son-in-Law" by Leonard Grover is
the title ot the play to be offered at
Grover's Alcazar this evening, with Mrs.
Auzerais Hoyte in the character of Mrs.
Bisbon, the romantic wife. It is an amus
ing play. . .
"Blue Beard" is to remain on the
boards at the Tivoli Opera-house this
evening. The new songs and localisms in
the second edition of the operatic bur
lesque, which are bright, have made a
decided hit. - --'-. .- *-'â 
But few attractions that have been
placed on the boards of the Orpheum
Music Hall have given more satisfaction
to the patrons than the Trans-Oceanic
Company. This company, with the mid
eets, appears to-night.
There will be a horse show at the New
Auditorium this evening. Professor M.
D. Bristol will introduce to the audience
thirty trick horses, some of which have
attracted, a great deal of attention in
Europe.
An attraction that drew well in this
City, "The "Sight Clerk," is to be pre
sented to the patrons of the Macdonough
Theater in Oakland to-night by the Peter
F. Dailey Company.
In 1783 the Supreme Court of Massachu
setts declared that the clause in the con
stitution "all men are created free and
equal" was a bar to the existence of slavery
in that commonwealth.

RESIGNS BECAUSE
OF A SCHISM
Rev. Mr. Higgins Submits
. to the Will of the
HIT' Â«x
Minority.
HE WORKED FOR CHRIST
The Retiring Minister Says the
Cause of Religion Is Dearer
Than Self.
HAS A CALL FROM THE EAST.
The Minority Want Another Minister.
Sketch of the First Jerusalem
Church.
Rev. F. L. Higgin*-, for the past two
years pastor of the First New Jerusalem
(Swedenborgian) Church on O'Farrell
street, near Weoster, has tendered his
resignation, the same to take effect July
1. The reverend gentleman expects to go
East at that time to take charge of a
church which it is understood has been
offered him.
Back of this unexpected action on the
part of the Rev. Mr. Higgins lies a little
hit of inside church gossip, culminating
two weeks ago in the resignation above re
ferred to. At that time the pastor told
his people that he could no longer serve
them and asked that the church accept
his action without comment and unan
imously. The members present decided,
not to do anything hastily, and so post
poned consideration of the matter until
yesterday a week ago.
Then Mr. Higgins was asked to explain,
which fit. did by saying that the church
was not unanimous in its support ot him,
and consequently he would be doing the
cause of religion an injustice to continue
working in a field where a schism mani
festly existed. The pastor begged the
congregation to accept nis resignation,
adding that if they did not do so he would
(In the same thing over again. lie urged
that the acceptance in the interest of har
mony be unanimous. In spite of this re
quest nearly one-third of the congregation
voted for his retention.
In October of 1893 Rev. John Doughty,
the leader for twenty-seven years of this
particular section of the Swedenborgian
Society, died. For a time thereafter Mr.
Putnam read the service each Sunday,
and then the Rev. Mr. David was called in
as a substitute, and lor three months
preached to the congregation of the First
.New Jerusalem Church. At the end of
that time Rev. Mr. Higgins was asked to
preach one sermon, which he did.
As the result of this effort Mr. Higgins
was elected over Mr. David pastor of the
Swedenborgian Society, For a time all
went well and then the partisans of Rev.
Mr. David began to mane trouble. A
prominent member of the church, in
speaking about the schism yesterday, said:
"The little celestial church of Sweden
borgians has had a quiet upheaval within
the last two weeks, which will probably
end in the departure of our gentle leader,
the Rev. Mr. Higgins. It seems that a few
of the most worldly ones of the flock desire
a "popular" church, as they express it.
While Mr. Higgins is not a" sensational
preacher he is a scholarly man and
preaches spiritual sermons that are above
the heads of the disaffected of the congre
gation. Unlike the Rev. Dr. Brown ne is
a modest man and does not wish to fill
the pulpit when the church is not a unit
in harmony.
"Three years ago the Rev. John
Doughty died and left this little church in
quite a prosperous condition. For a while
thereafter Mr. Put man read the service.
Then Rev. Mr. David occupied the pulpit.
But when the convention was held here
two years ago the Rev. Mr. Higgins was
called as our minister for one year; at
the close of the year he was re-elected for
three years. One year has passed and all
of his friends thought the church satisfied
and at peace. But it seems there were a
few discontented ones that did not want
to keep to the three years' contract, but
demanded an immediate change; so a
petition was drawn up asking the reverend
gentleman to resign. The petition was
very quietly circulated/but failed to get
signatures. The very apparent dishonesty
of a church not holding to a contract ap
pealed to the secular principle of many.
"So the disaffected thought, as they
knew their man, they would appeal to his
sensibility. =33- >
"One man had the face to lay the case
before the gentleman of God instead of
consulting the church as a whole. It had
the expected effect, and a week ago last
Sunday the Rev. Mr. Higgins handed in
his resignation, which . came as a great
surprise to the many who admired him as
a teacher and expounder of the religion of
the great seer. "
"One said if a thunderbolt had struck him
he would not have been more surprised.
Another, that it was an underhanded,
dishonorable move, that the church ought
forever to be ashamed of. Quite a number
of the. pastor's friends say that they will
not be a party to the transaction by re
maining in the church. , .77
"We have had many exhibitions of the
cruelty of Christianity in this City. If not
the Inquisition, torture to the spiritual
that can dethrone even reason.
"But for this little ohurch to get into the
papers has been the bugbear of the weak-
Kneed, who ought to have stood by their
pastor and cared only for the spiritual
right of the situation."
Rev. Mr. Higgins said yesterday that
those who opposed him did not do so on
personal grounds, but simply because they
preferred another minister.
"As soon as I learned that a minority
preferred some one -else 1 determined that
my duty to the church and the cause of
Christ could only be* fulfilled' by my re
signing. It 'is merely the act of doing
away with self for the cause of Christian
ity. 1 told the majority, those who favor
me, that it was best to accept my resigna
tion unanimously, for by so doing a per
fect harmony would be created where only
discord exists."
The majority of the congregation do not
accept kindly the act of the few who
brought about the resignation of their be
loved pastor. _ The action of Mr. Higgins
does not by any means heal the breach,
and there are those who think that a
schism of a serious character will follow.
Rev. Mr. Higgins preached as usual yes
terday morning, his subject being, "The
Laverof Brass." In his opening remarks
the minister said: - .. **- , __H_KB
"The tabernacle, rich in its costliness
and composed of the consecrated free will

twelve tribes encamped in a divinely in
stituted order, and within it through the
medium of priesthood the people wor
shiped according to a divinely ordained
method. But the outward worship thus
established was only the representative of
the true spiritual heart worship.

THE OTHER VIEW.
What Miss ration Hag to Say of the
Hospital Criticism of the
Grand Jury.
Miss Mary Patton, in charge of the train
ing-school for nurses at the City and
County Hospital, has this to say in regard
to the criticism, of the Grand Jury that
made a recent visit to the institution:
"The training-school has been in opera
tion for four or five years. Instead of add
ing to the expense of the institution it has
always been the means of a great saving.
I have twenty-eight nurses under my super
vision there, all of whom are serving the
City at the nominal cost of $10 a month.
There are but four male nurses, and they
serve at certain hours during the day. The
nurses ot the training-school, besides at
tending the operating-room and assisting
in the wards during the day, take active
charge at night. We provide our own sup
plies at no cost whatever to the City.
"The salary list for these nurses is but
$265 a month. The number of patients
averages 300 through the year and these
are served by our nurses and the four
male nurses. "The fact is that instead of
being an expense to be cut off, the City is
really indebted to our nurses. We have
nothing like the accommodations that
other cities supply, such as gymnasiums
and reading-rooms. The cost of these
nurses besides the nominal salary is but
22 cents a day for their meals, and for this
the City gets the benefit oj this large force
of nurses. Tne- members of the Grand
Jury, while we welcome them at any time
to inspect the institution and our work,
are simply not informed of the necessities
of the situation and the customs in other
places." â ..â ;", ..; ' 3 -;3
STEALING NEWSPAPERS.
A Colored Boy Caught in the Act by a
Carrier.
Residents on Jones street between Sutter
and Bush have been recently missing
their morning papers. G. W. Martin, a
carrier, marked two papers and lay in
hiding for the thief yesterday morning.
A colored boy came along and Martin
saw him pick up the papers and walk
away with them. He promptly captured
him and took him to the Central Police
Station. There were found upon him a
marked copy of the Examiner and
Chronicle and several copies of The Call.
Policeman Joy took him across to the
City Prison and two charges of petty
iarceny were booked against him. He
gave his name as Simmons Torrence, 15
years of age, a native of North Carolina.
Torrence said he sells The Call, and just
picked up the other two papers as he
wanted to tee something that was in
them. ___ 3
TWO IDEAS OF A DEATH.
Coroner Hawkins and Dr. Kuhl-
Mann on the Word "Trau-
matic."
The Coron.r Maintains That Jens
Sonderup's Death Was Caused
by Tuberculosis.
Coroner Hawkins and Dr. Charles G.
Knhlmann still hold diverse ideas as to
the cause of the death of Jens W. Son
derup, who was struck by a northbound
car about six months ago while attempt
ing to cross Kearny street.
The attending physician, Dr. Kuhl
mann, pronounced the death, which oc
curred last Thursday, to have been caused
by." progressive traumatic cerebro-spinal
ataxia and paralysis," while Dr. Barrett,
who performed the autopsy for the Coro
ner, declares death to have been the result
of tuberculosis. 7'77- 3*3^3 77777
Coroner Hawkins said yesterday: "Dr.
Kuhlmann tried, to get the certificate
through the Health Office for a burial per
mit without notifying me, as he should
have done. The health authorities noti
ned me and I telephoned Dr. Kuhlmann
and asked him about' the case.
. "He made a statement that the family
did not hold the railroad company.respon
sible, and wished the case put through
without an autopsy." He said there was
nothing criminal in the case. This
aroused my suspicions and I insisted that
the body be brought to the Morgue.
' "When Dr. Barrett held the autopsy he
found a different condition of affairs than
reported by Dr. Kuhlmann. Dr. Barrett's
autopsy disclosed the fact that death was
caused by tuberculosis. The body was in
General atrophied by the progress of the
isease. - According to Dr. Barrett's state
ment the cause of death was natural, and
therefore no inquest should be held."

Parents and Sponsors Attend to Sol

The interior of St. Paul's Lutheran
Evangelical Landeskirche, with its taste
ful decorations of flowers, ferns and ever
greens: with its bright new carpet and
furnishings and its well-dressed congrega
tion, in which were a fair quota of pretty
spring bonnets and gowns, presented a
pleasing picture yesterday morning at the
hour set for worship.

Yesterday and Where Twelve Infants Were Baptized in the Afternoon.
the elevated flooring of the altar, was dec
orated with purple and gold.
Within the sanctuary reserve were seated
the energetic ' young pastor, Paul F.
Branke, and his assistants, the Revs. J.
Hosta, J. Mangold, J. Endter and A.
Janke. The Rev. Mr. Branke conducted
the service # and performed the dedicatory
ceremony, assisted by the clergymen men
tioned. Afterward Mr. Branke preached
a sermon, which was listened to atten
tively by the congregation.
At 3 o'clock there were twelve pretty,
bright-looking little folks on hand. They
were clad in the whitest of robes and were
accompanied by their parents and two
sponsors for each. In all there was an as
semblage of sixty interested persons, who
came to the house of the \ Master to place
under the protection of their God the souls
of those twelve little innocent ones.
The presence of both parents at the cer
emony of baptism in the "Landeskirche"
is obligatory, according to the canons of
that church. The ceremony of christening
differs in no essential way from the form
of the English Episcopal church. After
being sprinkled and uttering infantile pro
testations against an unsolicitated cold
water reception the babes were" carefully
and tenderly wrapped up in their warm
covering and taken home.
During the evening service short ser
mons were preached dv the Revs. Man
gold, Endter and Janke. Thus was the
little "Landeskirche" 3 planted . on the
northern border of the Mission Dolores

COLONEL BARNES DYING
Life of the Celebrated Sporting
Man at a Very Low
Ebb.
HIS PICTURESQUE CAREER.
Something of the History of a Man
Who Had Been Identified With
the Bret Hartean Era.
The life of Colonel William P. Barnes,
One of the best known old-time sporting
men of the State, is at a very low ebb. At
his residence on Geary street the end has
been expected for several days. '3-33>
William P. Barnes has a wife, the sister
of Mrs. John H. Wise, wife of the Collector
of Customs at this port. He also has an
only child, Mrs. Bessie Franklin. His
only living brother is Dr. Barnes of Ukiah,
and his nephew Is the Hon. Thomas L.
Carothers of the same city. He has also
two nieces, one the wife of James Stevens
and the other the wife of Superior Judge
Alexander of Salinas.
He is a native of Indiana and in 1849 he
came to California and settled with his
mother and father in the neighborhood of
what is now known as Petaluma.
During the days when the Mormons
were making trouble through Illinois and
lowa, Barnes, who was but a mere boy, en
gaged in the army sent out to do them
battle. The same spirit he showed then
has always followed him, and he has been
regarded as a man who, although not ag
gressive, could not be made to retreat a
step when he believed he was right. This
feature had many opportunities to develop
in the early days of California, when each
man had to rely on his own mettle for
protection.
Bill Barnes became a member of the
Pioneers of California when that society
was first organized, and has been one of
its shining members ever since. His as
sociates have always been men most prom
inent in social, business and political life,
but he, with the grit and determination
he has always shown, held on until he
saw them one by one pass to the great be
yond.
"Colonel" Barnes, as he was usually ad
dressed, was of a sporty turn of mind, like
nearly all other men who came to the new
El Dorado in the days when the necessaries
of life were paid for in gold dust. He was
a great friend of BillJÃriggs, who was, be
yond a doubt, the most picturesque char
acter, as a sport, that ever sat behind a
layout. Barnes began as a protege of
Briggs', and subsequently they became
partners.
Aside from his many silent charities,
which he has always attended to, directly
or indirectly, even to his last illness, he
will be remembered by his fellow pioneers
as the one who inaugurated the bullshead
breakfast outings in this State. Each
year, until his health failed, it was he who
headed the table and did the carving at
the reunions of the Society of Old Friends,
of which he was a leading member.
At one time Colonel Barnes entered
politics. It was in the days when Napo-
leon Broughton and Zeke Wilson of So
noma were prominent as leaders of the
Democracy of this State. Barnes was their
wire-puller at Sacramento.
There is a bit of international history
attached to the name of William P.
Barnes. Some time in 1857 he and Grant
Israel, who was the first owner of the old
Cosmopolitan Hotel, long since out of ex
istence, took a trip in a ; privately char
tered schooner to the coast of Mexico.
They were captured by the Government
and taken to. Mazatlan, where they, wero
cast in an adobe prison on a charge of fili
bustering. 3 They were most cruelly
treated, being prodded with bayonets and
almost starved. The United States took
up the matter and they were liberated.
Subsequently, they- brought suit against
Mexico for $100,000 damages, and the af
fair was left to a foreign board of arbitra
tion, which allowed them $7500 each. The
Mexican Government, however, was not in
a. position to 1 pay the money at the time,
and the board allowed the amount to ;be
paid in $500 installments each year. The
debt was finally wiped out about eight
years ago. â¢** ->
_ Yesterday it was reported at Collector
Wise house that Colonel Barnes was very
low and failed to recognize his friends.
Attempt at Burglary.
Two men were seen by Policeman "Siangan
yesterday afternoon trying to break the : lock
â¢ a barn door on Grove street, between Scott
and Devisadero. He made for them and they
ran. He overtook one of them ; and sent him
in the patrol wagon to the City Prison, where
a charge of * attempt at burglary was entered
against him.; He gave the name of John Abies.

ADDRESS OF REV. A. M. RUSSELL
Chauncey Parke Talks of the Need of
Greater Moral Culture Among
the Masses.
There was a large attendance at the Good
Citizenship meeting yesterday afternoon
at Metropolitan Temple, Rev. A. M. Rus
sell and Chauncey Parke being the speak
ers of the day.
The former was a new advocate in the
cause of good citizenship, but met with
the hearty approval of his audience from
the very start.
He announced that his subject would be,
"The A. P. A's; the best friends the
Catholics have." He then spoke as fol
lows: '.-
"Now, lam serious about this. I say in
perfect sincerity the principles of the A.
P. A. are better calculated to strengthen
their institutions than anything else. I
say this because we are working for the
enlightenment of the Catholics. They do
not know their own history, except as
they get it from Father Yorke and such
vile sheets as the Monitor. Every intelli
fent man knows that these are falsifying.
hey tell only such part of that history as
suits them. There are dark, horrible
chapters in that history that they never
refer to.
"Neither do the Catholics understand
the genius nor the purpose of Protestant
ism. Therefore I say it is the part of the
A. P. A. to enlighten them on these
points. ';fe;fe
"I feel that the A. P. A. is not only the
best party for their enlightenment, but for
their liberation. A dog may wear a collar
so long that he would fesl the loss of it.
I say so it is with the Catholics. They
have no proper conception of liberty; the
priests are their masters.
"I want to work along another line now.
I want to show some of these Catholics
how they can put money in their pockets."
This elicited a few scattering hisses from
the gallery. Scarcely hesitating, the
speaker continued : '
"Oh, I heard a goose when I was a boy,
but I have never been afraid of one of
tbem â then or since. [Laughter and ap
plause.] .
"I repeat, I want to show the Catholics
how they can make money. I know they
love money, and I say this with all sin
cerity. Why, a Catholic cannot be born
without paying his priest for the privilege.
He must be baptized as soon as he is born,
and that is as bad as paying for the privi
lege of being born. Then take the matter
of forgiving sin. The Catholic can have
his sin forgiven by going to tbe priest and
paying for it. lam just as capable of for
giving sin as the Pone of Rome. He is a
false pretender. I would rather put my
hands in a man's pocket and steal his
money than get it in this way. But there
are many ways, I* tell .you, of railroading
the money into the pockets of the priests.
"But our Catholic* friend may get tired
of this and say: | 'Well, I will get rid of
this burden of taxation by the priests by
dying.' But in this he is mistaken. For
the Catholic priests even follow a man to
the grave, and when they get him there
they keep him there. 'Why, it is more
difficult to get out of the clutches of a
priest than out of the hands of the devil.
"After a man is dead his estate is as
sessed for the repose of his soul, and if he
leaves nothing his friend's are taxed with
this burden. So long, in fact, as there is
a dollar to be extorted from relatives or
friends the man's soul is reported to be
suffering in purgatory by these pretenders.
"J repeat, then, that the A. P. A. is the
best friend the Catholics have by exposing
these impositions for their benefit, profit
and enlightenment.- *.* "
"The priest holds a soul in purgatory
until he gets ready to let it go. Shame on
men and women who allow themselves to
be so deluded. We should do our utmost
to liberate them from this terrible bond
age of the soul to which the Roman
church has confined them for the past 2000
years."
Chauncey Parke was then announced
He said: v v,3*v *
"I propose to speak to you in reeard to
our personal interests in I the public wel
fare. This involves good citizenship, and
good citizenship involves good govern
ment." .
The speaker attributed the prevalence of
crime and lawlessness to the failure of so
ciety to educate its individual members in
a proper moral manner, as punishment
he declared, was known not to be a suc
cessful deterrent of crime. He advocated
not only protection for social, civil, politi
cal and religious liberties, but thorough
education in regard to them, so that every
man and woman would have a proper com
prehension of these matters.
"I believe," he said, "our Nation ap
proaches these conditions most nearly but
even it is a long way off. There is too lit
tle attention paid to moral education and
the creation of good and manly character
-ear of punishment is depended upon
rather than the proper.; education of the
young and growing generation. Protec
tion and defense should not be the aim of
government: it should be the instilling of
culture into every man and woman.
"When we legislate we make one law
for character and a hundred for pocket.
But when we reach the proper state all this
will be reversed. Then one hundred laws
will be made for character and one for
greed. Why is this so? It is that the very
heart of the people throb at the mere jingle
of money."
Then followed a disquisition on the evils
f the pursuit and acquirement of wealth.
UTAH AND HER PEOPLE.
Elder J. R. Shepherd Lectures to a
Large Audience.
Elder J. R. Shepherd, one of the elders
in the Mormon church laboring in Califor
nia, spoke about "Utah and Her People"
last evening at 909 Market street. He said
in part:
"It is truly phenomenal to note the
growth, progress and prosperity of Utah
to-day when we reflect upon its condition
forty-eight years ago and the many adver
sities with which they have had to com
bat.
"On July 24, 1847, 143 hardy Mormon
pioneers directed by their leader, Brigham
Young, halted after a long journey of 1100
miles across a trackless wilderness and
camped where now stands Salt Lake City.
Brigham Young told them that there was
the place . that God designed that Israel
should dwell. They were then on Mexi
can soil, but with that loyalty to
the United States that had ; ever
been inculcated within them they
unfurled to the breeze the Stars and
Stripes. To question the loyalty of the
Mormon people to the "United States ex
hibits a woeful ignorance of history.
When driven from their homes in Nau
voo, while camped upon the prairies of
lowa, a demand was made upon Brigham
Young for 500 of their best men to enlist
and march to California and fight their
country's battles against Mexico. This,
indeed, was a trial. They had been driven
from State to State; pleaded for protec
tion, but could get none ; even plead be
fore the chief executive of the Nation, but
was met with the reply, ' Your cause is
just, but I can do nothinc for you.' Yet
with that patriotism that dwells within
all Mormons, Brigham Young said: 'You
shall have them if it takes all of mv
elders.' They went and did no
ble service. When the pioneers
entered Salt Lake Valley in
1847, but little of the country
west of the Missouri was known, true a
few trappers and explorers had traversed
the mountains, but a bona fide colony had
not dared to settle any of this section,
save a very few in California. Daniel
Webster said, What do we want of these
shifting sand hills, land of cactus and
prairie dogs.' To-day we are a common
wealth of a quarter of a million of people,
prosperous and happy, with a greater per
centage of persons owning their own
homes than can probably be found in any
other part of the world. Their enemies
have in the past by * misrepresenta
tion brought trials upon them, but
through all they have been loyal, true
and honest and to-day Gentile and Jew
have become convinced of the industry
sincerity and loyalty of the Mormon peo
ple, and all join hands in making Utah a
State of which our Government may be
proud. Factories, railroads, churches,
schools, farms, orchards and homes dot
the land from north to south and with
statehood recently acquired she will be
come one of the grandest of the sisterhood
of States." -* â¢;.
CARTRIDGE ON A CARTRACK.

DEATH AMID PLEASURE
Sorrowful Ending of What Was
Expected to Be an Enjoy
able Evening.
WELL-KNOWN GERMAN CITIZEN
William F. Muhlner Dies Suddenly at
the Formal Opening of the â¢
Turn Verein Bar.
A tragic scene occurred at the; Turn
Verein. Hall, 323 Turk street, last night,
which broke up a gathering that promised
to be one of the merriest in the history of
the organization.
The barroom attached to the hall has
been in preparation for a formal opening
for some time. It has been fitted up with
out regard to cost, and the proprietor.
Adam Brehm. invited about 100 members
of the organization to be present at the
formal opening last night.
They all responded, and were in the
midst of their enjoyment when William
F. Muhlner, one of the roost prominent
members, entered. He was dazzled with
the dare of the electric lights, and, rais
ing his hands, he walked toward the bar
with a smile on his face to congratulate
ihe proprietor.
As the old man stood for an instant in
front of the bar, while friends crowded
round him. his face turned ghastly pale
and throwing his arms upward he sank to
the floor with a stifled moan. Dr. Rinna
was present and rushed forward, and to
his horror found that the old gentleman
was dead.
The guests were stricken dumb with sor
row and astonishment as they gathered
round the lifeless form of theit old friend.
Word was sent to his relatives at 30 Fell
street and the body was taken there, while
the cuests sorrowfully took their depart
ure from the barroom, where they had ex
pected to pass a pleasant evening".
Mr. Muhlner had for years a shoestoreat
060 Post street and lived at 30 Fell street.
He was a member of the Grand Army and
belonged to nearly all the German organi
zations in the City. He always took an
active interest in the Turn Verein and was
one of its prominent members.
The cause of his sudden death was heart
disease. * 3^ 'â¢â¢ 3

SiftYARDE-BULLER
AND GADESDEN
The Co Respondent Well
Known in San Francisco
Society Circles
AS A MUSIC TEACHER.
He Had a Secret Method for the
Production of Pure Tones
in Others.
THE HERO OF A LOVE ROMANCE.
Broke His Leg in Santa Cruz, and
Made a Miserable Failure in an
Amateur Entertainment
Valentine Gadesden, the singing teacher
who has attained world-wide celebrity by
figuring as the co - respondent in the
divorce case between the Hon. Mrs. Lellah
Yarde-Buller and her husband, tt.e Hon.
Walter Yarde-Buller, is well known in San
Francisco. The Hon. Walter ia the eldest
brother of Lord Church ston, head of the
Devonshire family.
Gadesden came to San Francisco ten
years ago and blossomed forth as a teacher
of music, he being a tenor robusto and
well versed in his art. He was then about
28 or 29 years oldâ a tall, dark handsome
Englishman of elegant manners. Being
a graduate of an English university, an ac
complished linguist and a scholar, and
belonging to a very respectable family in
Encland, he had no difficulty in gain
ing admission into the best society in
San Francisco and in obtaining all the
pupils he wanted at high rates.
Like a good many other professional
men, he had an idea that he was born to
be a financier, although his own financial
affairs were in a deplorably tangled con
dition. Creditors used to sing to him from
early morn until dewy eve, to the accom
paniment of fluttering bills.but poor Gades
den had no money. He could never get
enough of it together at one time, nor
could he keep it long enough to settle all
claims as fast as presented. Money was
made to spend, and he spent it, thereby
keeping it in circulation.
He became indebted recently to Duncan
& Co. of London to the extent of Â£4100,
which fact shows that his credit was re
markably good in England. Several let
ters from Mrs. Yarde-Bulier's boy were
forwarded to Gadesden's care at Duncan
& Co.'s office, but the Duncans refused to
deliver her the letters unless she paid
Gadesden's debt.
After consultation with her attorney she
gave Duncan & Co. her check for $4100 and
got her letters. Then she sued for the re
covery of the money on the ground that
Duncan & Co. had extorted the check from
her by holding her son's letters. The case
was tried a few days ago, and she recov
ered judgment for the whole amount.
Under cross-examination she said that
Gadesden had been staying with her at
Churchston court and had continually
been in her company since he became her
agent.
While living in San Francisco Gadesden
professed to have discovered a secret pro
cess for developing the pure tones of the
voice, and so jealously guarded was this
secret that he would never sing in public,
lest the public might discover it. He had
the key of a piano wareroom in the His
tory building on Market street, and often
at 11 o'clock at night he unlocked the
door, then locked himself in and sat for
three or four hours at the piano practicing
those divine tones which nobody, not even
the janitor, ever heard.
Only once did he consent to sing in pub
lic, and that was in an amateur operatic
performance gotten up for charity by
Signor Rosewald, and sung by society peo
ple. Gadesden was so well known among
the upper ten, and curiosity to hear those
divine tones cultivated in the piano-room
at night was so great, that a jam of fash
ionable people attended.
He proved a flat failure. His singing
was horrible, and his acting would have
disgraced an amateur supernumerary.
"He was worse than a stick," said a
young lady yesterday. "His singing was
wretched, and his acting was vile. He had
to make love to the heroine of the opera,
and he seemed to be so much afraid of her
that the audience laughed at him through
out the performance. When they sat on
the sofa together he was as stiff as a hyp
notized poker, and the heroine was obliged
to shift her position so that she could get
up close to him, and remind him of the
role he was playing. That was the only
time he ever sang here in public, and the
public was thankful he never sang again."
So far as known the English tenor led a
pretty exemplary life while here. He
never drank intoxicating liquors and was
never mixed up in any 10/e affair, al
though there is no doubt that be could
have been had he desired, for he was a
handsome fellow, a brilliant conversation
alist and a first-class athlete and lootball
player.
The only occasion in which his name
was coupled in gossip with that of a
woman was when he began paying marked
attentions to Mrs. Yarde-Buller. About a
year ago Mrs. Buller occupied luxuriously
furnished flats on Sacramento street, be
tween Hyde and Larkin, in this City, and
Mr. Gadesden was so frequent a visitor
that the neighbors remarked that he all
but lived there. -. Many of his friends
placed a charitable construction on his
liking for tl c Sacramento-street flats and
said that no doubt the tenor was there in
his capacity as Mrs. Yarde-Buller's busi
ness agent.
When the lady left for England Mr.
Gadesden went with her, presumably to
look after her business affairs. He was
also interested in some kind of iumber
speculation, and that was probably the
basis of the debt be owed Duncan & Co.
; Mrs. Yarde-Buller has two sons by her
former husband, 14 to 16 years old, the
younger of whom was taken sick, and she
left him at Dr. Kosenstirn's hospital. The
other was left here to attend school. 33. â 
The tenor was an intimate friend of
Lawyer J. R. Jarboe and family, Mr. Jar-
boe finding much to admire in Gadesden's
conversational ability and knowledge of
books. He accompanied the family on a
summer vacation to Santa Cruz, and while
there met with an accident which re
sulted in tbe breaking ot one of bis legs.
He was nursed down there by the family,
and a similar episode is treated of in a
novel written a snort time ago by Mrs. J. j
R. Jarboe under the norn de plume of
'Thomas H. Brainerd."
The book created a sensation in society
circles here. Everybody knew Gadesden
and his peculiarities, and they at once
picked out "Ned Harlow," the hero of the
book, as Valentine Gadesden, the hand
some singing , teacher. He is thus men
tioned in the first chapter of the story :
f Later they heard that he h - d gone to Nice,
men that he haa entered a conservatory of
music, was studying the violin and musi
cal composition, and then that he was going
on the stage as a tenore robusto. Jack always
said that he would rather hear Ned's voice
than any other music in the world.
Society buds laughed so heartily over
this reference to "Ned's" voice when they
thought of the amateur operatic enter
tainment that the tears made little rabbit
paths through the powder that hid the
roses in their cheeks. Then the story
went on :
Again they heard that his life was sadly
changed, that moody and listless he wandered
about the world, trying a little of one thing
ana another, but accomplishing, nothing,
seeming to have no ambition or aim in life. .
Ned arrives with Jack, the betrothed of
Bessie. Here is what Bessie thought of
him: 3 3>-
He was one of those men whom women in
stinctively adore, and who as Instinctively
dread the adoration to which they are sub
jected. He was. she felt sure, not a woman
lover if he was not a woman-hater. .'â¢*;'*
Next morning Jack says to Bessie:
"Bessie, it seems almost selfish to thank God
for having given you to me. What have I done
to deserve it? You make or mar us, dear. We
are all, all in your hands."
"Oh, Jack, don't say such dreadful things.
You terrify me when you put such responsi
bility upon me. What shall I do?'.' 3-3
"Nothing," he answered, "it is not what you
do, but what you are ; dear love."
Then, although he said no more. Bessie
thought she knew what it was that had warped
out of all usefulness the life of his friend.
It was evident that Ned had been crossed
in love. 7 r 7-7 r -
Helen's sister, a grass widow deserted
by a worthless husband, appears upon the
scene. She finds some pages of an opera
written by Ned and she sat down to the
piano and sang it, as women always sing
in novels. It had its effect.
When she began to sing Ned slowly rose and
moved like one enchanted down the room. He
stood behind her, and when the storm was ris
ing and the cry ol the wind was like the wail
of lost souls his violin took up the strain and
joined in the prayer with its indescribable
pleading. When they reached the end Helen
rose and looked at Ned.
"You," she said. "Is it you who have made
this wonderful, fearful, glorious thing?"
â¢â¢No," he said, looking with eyes of flame
into hers. "It did not live until to-night."
Ned goes exploring a cave on the beach,
falls into a hole and breaks his leg. He is
nursed by Bessie and Jack, just as Gades
den with his broken leg was nursed by his
friends in Santa Cruz. Helen before this
had become frightened because, on wak
ing from an afternoon siesta in a ham
mock, she had found Ned's eyes fastened
upon her with an amorous gaze. Where
upon she packed her Saratogas and skipped
away on the overland train. She is, how
ever, badly "gone" on the handsome
tenor. This is what she writes to her
sister Bessie :
O God! can it be that this is what is called
temptation", ana that I have dared to despise
those who have yielded to it? I kneel before
the altar and press the sacred crucifix to my
lips, and while my lips repeat the prayer for
forgiveness of sin my wicked heart cries with
awful exultation, "he loves me; he loves me."
Bessie, my more than sister, I am fallen, fallen
60 low that I know if I should see him I would
rush to his arms. What shall Ido? Where
shall Igo ? Pray for me and pi ty me.
Then Jack tells Bessie that Ned was a
married man. The story was that he took
Alice Graham, a minister's daughter, out
for a row on the lake. A fog came up and
he couldn't find the shore until the fog
lifted at daylight. Then he took the girl
home weeping.
Her father was angry and said that his
daughter's good name was gone forever
I because of the night and the fog, and so
; Ned, to make everything all right, married
j the girl then and there. Then he gave the
j old man "a note for Â£100" for Alice's ex
! penses until he should be heard from
: again, and without a word or look for
j the bride he left the house and went to
I Paris.
After Ned's broken leg got well he went
to Milan and saw Helen. Although she
loved him she treated him coldly because
her husband was living, and she being a
Catholic could not be divorced. So Ned
departed with a bee in his ear and Helen
went to a nunnery.
Finally Ned meets Alice, his wife, and
this is what occurs:
She was indeed "fair as the moon, bright as
the sun," but also "terrible as an army with
banners."
Presently about her mouth there quivered
the faint dawn of a smile. She came forward
and put her hand into his. He bowed low as
he took it, saying, "I hope you are quite well."
That is as stiff and as uninteresting as
was Tenor Gadesden's acting and singing
in the amateur operatic performance in
San Francisco. Soon afterward and in the
last chapter he sings his love to Alice, and
the novel ends in rapture and in rhapsody
as follows: ' 77* *3- 3/
His eyes were fixed on her, and when the
last sound ceased she turned and met his gaze
with all her tender soul in ncr face. As the
strong waves ot the sea rush to the shore, so
his love surged out to meet the sweet, dear
passion in her eyes, ana he knew that the old
heaven and earth had passed away and that all
things had become new.
Some San Franciscans doubt that Ned
Harlow of the novel and Valentine Gades
den are the same person, because the novel
makes Ned Harlow a fine singer. But they
should remember that there is such a thing
as poetic license.
HOW ENGLAND IS TED.
Most of the Necessaries of life Are
Imported.
In 1894, with only a trifle over 1,900,000
acres under wheat, England produced
7,390,000 quarters at home, importing 16,
--310.000 quarters of wheat grain, besides
19,130,000 hundredweight of flourâ is
to say, a total of 21,000,000 quarters, allow
ing for flour. In 1894, Men, three out of
every four Englismen lived wholly upon
foreign bread. In 1895, owing to the tre-
I menuous reduction of the area under
wheat, not one in every five dr*;w his
bread from the country.
Our daily bread 'comes to us from
abroad; but this is not the only necessary
which we import. Of â¢ foodstuffs, which
might conceivably be produced in the
country, we purchase from- the foreigner
nearly half of our meat, nearly Â£16,500
worth of butter and margarine, Â£6,070
worth of fruit and hops, Â£5.400,000 worth
of cheese, Â£3.780,000 worth of eggs, Â£1 000 -
000 worth of potatoes, Â£778.000 of poultry
Â£1,000,000 worth of vegetables. In addition
to these there are the various other kinds
of colonial produce, of which sugar alone
could be grown in England. A small rise
in each of these items would inflict in
numerable hardships upon our working
population. A great rise would mean
starvation. Generations of peaceful de
velopment have bred in us a belief that
England will, never be seriously attacked
and that the navy may with safety be
starved. *;.; We forget that a fresh and even
more importunate burden than the safe
guarding of our raw material and manu
factures has been laid upon it in the need
to watch r. over our food supplies.âNine

THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1896.
WILL BOYCOTT
THE BOSS BAKERS.
The Bakers' Union De
clares It Has Many -
Grievances.
TOO YOUNG TO STRIKE.
Claim Is Made That the Bread
Served to the Public Is
Unwholesome.
SECRETARY GRASSMAN TALKS.
One Grievance Is Found in the Ap
parent Unwarranted Discharge
of Men.
There is a fight on between the United
Bakers' | Union and the Master Bakers'
Protective Association, better known lo
cally as the "Boss" Bakers. At present
the struggle is in a kind of embryo state,
but Otto Grassman, secretary of the first
named organization, is responsible for the
statement . that before the week is half
ended war, in the shape of a boycott, wUI
be declared.
The trouble between the men who mold
flour and water and the other essential in
gredients into rolls, doughnuts, lady-fin
gers and delicate pastry tidbits, and the
"bosses" arises from two causes. The first
is found in the sanitary condition of the
bakeshops, and the second in the dis
charge within the last week --of several
union men.
Some weeks ago Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald with the assistance of three or
four deputies made a tour of all the big
bakeries in the City. Many of the places
were in a horribly filthy condition from a
sanitary point of view. The floors were
damp, the air foul-smelling, and the uten
sils employed in mixing the bread and
cakes presented anything but attractive
appearances.
As a result of this unexpected invasion,
under the guidance of Mr. Fitzgerald, a
complaint, signed by one Rudolph, was
filed with the Board of Health, calling at
tention to the unhealthy condition of the
bakeries. So far as known, however, the
health officers have not as yet taken any
steps toward remedying the alleged evils
and now the men who work for the bosses
will endeavor to see what they can do in
the premises.
The master bakers, of course, heard of
all these things, and they at once set to
work to learn if possible who it was that
had been telling things which they would
like very much to remain unknown. As a
partial result of this investigation three or
four union bakers were relieved of their
situations, among them being a man
named Rudolph. No reason was assigned
for the summary discharge of the men,
but the men themselves claim that it is
due to a belief on the part of the bosses
that they caused the exposures to be made
by Fitzgerald. .
At the headquarters of the Bakers'
Union, on Turk street, everything is ap
parently very quiet, but for all that a great
deal of work is being done.
"The Bakers' Union is not sufficiently
well organized to order a strike," said Sec
retary Grassman last night, "but there is
a weapon within our grasp almost as
strong, and that is a boycott. We have a
committee of four out at work now, and
until they make their final report to-mor
row 1 do not care to discuss the situation
in all its phases.
"I will say, however, that if the people
only knew how the bread and cake which
they eat every day is prepared they would
make these things at home. Of course I
do not mean to say that all the boss estab
lishments are in a filthy condition, be
cause there are some which could not be

improved on. But there are bakeries, and
many of them, whose product I would not
eat. The public is much more interested
in this fight for purer food than we are.
We, of course, look to them to lend their
moral support in the boycott which it is
our purpose to declare against certain
bosses. This is the only way we can bring
them to time.' -.
"We have another grievance, but that is
of more recent origin. Several of our men
have been discharged unjustly â merely
because the bosses entertained a sus
picion that they were responsible for the
attention of the Board of Health being di
rected toward their establishments. Here
is a sample of the justice dealt out to us:
Last week one of the bosses, whose name

Rudolph was the man who signed the

battle for some of the bosses."

The Other Side of the Story.
Concerning the forcible dispossession of
George D. Shadburne Jr., which created some
little sensation on Market street Saturday
afternoon, Mr. Shadburne himself makes the
following statement:
"I rented an office of Madison & Burke on
the 25th day of November, and held undis
puted possession of the placeâ 6, 632
Market streetâ up to the 25th day of April,
1896, when a party by the name of Wiiber
forcibly took possession of my office. J have
the agency of Dr. Pierces electric belts, which
1 sold at 632 Market street. I never offered to
sell the place to Mr. McKlaughlin, the agent of
the Sanden electric belt, and did not try to sell
to customers of Mr. McKlaughlin.
ONE HAMMER WHS LIGHT
Edgren's Throw Made With a
Missle Seven Ounces
Under Weight.
Best Tosses in the Field-Day Were
With Berkeley's Inaccurate
Hammer.
Soon after the hammer-throw, the last
and decisive event in the intercollegiate
field day, was ended Saturday evening,
several University of California men de
clared that the 16-pound hammer used by
Stanford in the preliminary throws had
been mysteriously carried away by some
of the rapidly diminishing . crowd before
the judges had officially tested its weieht,
and grave insinuations were raised as to
the probable light weight of the missile.
It was openly claimed that the referee
should award the contest to California on
that account. But Referee Elliott had
already left the grounds with the crowd.
The University of California hammer,
with which Robert Edgren made his great
est throw, that of 136 feet 6 inches, was
then weighed on three different scales
near the entrance to the park, and much
to the chagrin of the Berkeley men was
found light. In order to ascertain the
exact weights of the California hammer
and Edgren's own hammer, with which
he made the first three throws, the best
being 134 feet 7}>i inches, Professor Magee,
the gymnasium instructor of Berkeley, re
quested witnesses to accompany him to a
pair of authentic scales in a well-known
grocery store downtown. There the Cali
fornia hammer was carofully weighed and
found to be seven ounces light, while Ed
gren's hammer was four ounces in excess
of sixteen pounds.
The witnesses were Professor Magee,
Carroll, the professional hammer-thrower;
Captain Merwin of the University, and A.
B. Rice of The Call.
The Stanford hammer was subsequently
found as expected with the Stanford ap
paratus, gathered up and carted off after
the games. It was then weighed in the
presence of Referee Elliott and C. W.
Hetherington, the gymnasium instructor
of Stanford University, and just balanced
at sixteen pounds.
So the weights of the hammers have
been determined and the suspicion of base
trickery among amateur athletes removed.
But Edgren's greatest throw, that of 136
feet 6 inches, does not stand as a record.
All the last and best throws of each con
testant, however, were made with the light
California hammer, so that while none of
the performances are authentic the condi
tions were equal all round for the throw
ers. v .. â  . Â»." *'< j

Ihe unfavorable weather that prevailed last
week had a rather depressing effect on the
real estate market and very little business
was transacted in any quarter." Business thus
far this spring has been fair, but not as large
as many anticipated. It' is doubtful if- there
will ever be another opportunity to buy San
Francisco real estate at such low prices* as it
can be had for to-day. Yet in spite of this fact
sales are slow, and until there is a general
activity felt In all lines of business it is not
likely that there will be any very marked re
vival in the real estate market.
IffiPAVING MARKET STREET.
A prominent real estate dealer in comment
ing upon the efforts being made to repave
Market street said: "This agitation to secure
a new and better pavement on Market street is
commendable, but it will not, I fear, be pro
ductive of any good unless conducted upon'
different lines than such movements* have in
the past. The cost of laying a bituminous
pavement from the ferry to Valencia street
would, I am tola by contractors, cost in the
neighborhood of $300,000. It is generally
conceded that It would be foolish to lay a
pavement of that kind and at that expense
without first putting in a good sewer and con
duit. The latter would cost as much if not
more than the pavement. The question is,
where is the money to come from to pay for all
this?
It will never do to think of making a tax
levy for this purpose in times like these, and
there is but one other way in which such im
provements can be made and paid for, and
that is to bond the City. Let the Cycle Board
of Trade and the Merchants' Association
urge the passage of the new charter and the
bonding of the City. Let their slogan be, "Pass
the charter ana bond the City," instead of
"Repave Market street." When they can ac
complish the former, the latter will be there
suit. Covering the City with placards reading,
"Repave Market street," won't produce the
coin to foot the bill, and the sooner the agita
tion is directed toward the passing of the char
ter and bonding the City, the sooner will
Market street be paved in the befitting manner
that the City's chief thoroughfare should be
paved. .- -::
TAXING MORTGAGES.
The question of taxing mortgages is one tnat
will be voted upon at the next State election.
It is a subject upon which there has been
much discussion pro and con, and it is a matter
that will no doubt receive considerable atten
tion from the people at large before the time
to vote arrives. The April number of the Santa
Clara County Real Estate Review, published
by Wooster & Whitten, contains the following
paragraph on the subject:
The people will soon be called on to vote on
a constitutional amendment for or against the
mortgage tax. The constitution of 1879 did
much to injure the prosperity of the State of
California. What at that time seemed in the
eyes of the short-sighted and incompetent con
stitutional delegate to be a cinch on the capi
talist has proven a boomerang. This is true
generally when the poorer classes undertake
to legislate against capital. Capital must
thrive in order to make any country prosper
ous. Capital is the basis, the pivot around
which everything essential in State develop
ment must turn. Laws to encourage the in
coming of capital promote thrift and happi
ness. . . .
Laws against capital have the contrary ef
fect, and money is unjustly and unwisely kept
out of the State. If there were no tax on mort
gages the rate of interest would have a uni
form basis which would be presumably fixed
at 5% to 0 percent. This would have the ef
fect of promoting country loans, as the ardu
ous task of keeping account of all the taxes
aDd special assessments in each county and
municipality would be removed. The money
lender would simply look to the collection of
his interest as it became due. While the bor
rower, who is usually the resident and who is
therefore , responsible in his measure
for the taxes of- his district, who as
a legislative . factor thereof helps ' to
regulate, the amount of the tax, is the
most interested man and should pay it direct
ly. By so doing he would be a more careful
citizen as regards public expenditures, and be
sides he would save at least 1 per cent annu
ally, which is now charged by the loaner "to
meet possible extra assessments and contin
gencies." 5: â â¢;

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES. '
The Torrens system of land transfers is, ac
cording to the newspapers of that city, meet
ing with unbounded success In Chicago. A
commission in Ohio that has been at worn; for
the past three years has recently reported to
the Governor of the State a bill "to simplify
and facilitate the transfer of - real estate and
he registration of titles.
It embodies all the principles of the Torrens
system and it is expected that the bill will be
passed by the next Legislature. Efforts are
being made to introduce the system in New
York Slate, with good prospects -of success.
The system wherever tried seems to give ex
cellent, satisfaction and it is not improbable
that it will, like that other-reform imported
from Australiaâ the Australian ballotâ in due
time beocme the law of every State in the
Union for transferring real estate titles.
In the splendid exhibit of the State's prod
ucts ana resources made by the -State Board of
Trade at 16 Post street, every county in the
State is j represented . except San Francisco
County, and there are also pamphlets and
other printed matter there regarding, nearly
every section of the State except this. Many
strangers and visitors here. oiten desire in
formation regarding this City and County, and
in order to meet this demand the Chamber of
Commerce is going to issue a pamphlet that
will contain, in concise form, a host of j valu
able information concerning San Francisco.
Colonel Will E. Fisher, the well-known real
estate man, is chairman of the committee hav
ing the matter in charge, and he is now busily
engaged compiling the matter.'. - *,*.* â 
The pamphlet will consist of six or eight
pages. It will not contain any advertising
matter whatever, but will be devoted to infor
mation concerning the manufacturing and
commercial and various other interests of the
City. And it will also contain a list of the
principal points of interest in and about the
town. It will be distributed gratis here and in
Eastern cities, and will fill a long felt want.

The Congressman Shut Up.
The last- time Con_ressn.an Bailey of
Texas was in New York he had business
on lower Broadway. As he went down on
a cable-car the conductor shouted out
â¢'Houston !" with the pronunciation given
to that name in these parts. Bailey looked
at a lamp-post.
"You mean 'Hooston,'" said Bailej,
"don't you?" The conductor without
looking at him said: "I know my busi
ness." 3 3v3: ..
"If. part of your business is to call out
the streets properly," said Bailey quietly,
"then you don't know it. Thestreet we
just passed is, not called 'Howston,' as
you pave it, but 'Hooston,' for General
Sara Houston, the liberator of Texas. If
you ever went to Texas and talked about
Sam 'Howston,' you'd be lucky to escape
lynching."
"If I went to Texas," said the conductor,
who was born on Sixth avenue, and who
never was farther away from the city than
Coney Island, "I'd deserve anything they
gave me."
Bailey said nothint, for he did not know
the answer to this discourteous sugges
tion.âNew York Journal.

STUBBS RETURNS HOME.
Third Vice-President of the
Southern Pacific Non-
Committal.
THE FREIGHT-RATE PROBLEM
Action of the Transcontinental Asso
ciation in Declining to Increase
Rates May Be Final.
J. C. Stubbs, third vice-president of the
Southern Pacific, is back from the East-
He arrived last night direct from Chicago,
where he attended the meeting of the
executive committee of the Transconti
nental Traffic Association last week.
Mr. Stubbs was accompanied by his wife,
and they were met at the ferries at 8:45
o'clock by a number of friends and several
representatives from that department of
the great railroad system over which the
third vice-president presides the freight
and traffic interests. ,
Much interest is centered about the re
turn of Mr. Stubbs at this time, since it
is generally* known that he failed to have
the Transcontinental Association ratify
the action of the representatives of the
transcontinental railroads, .who met in
Milwaukee three weeks ago, in increasing
the rates on all Eastern and Western
bound freight.
The transcontinental lines are all those
having extensions west of the Missouri
River. These lines decided on a general
increase of freight rates, not only on
through business both ways, but on inter
mediate traffic as well. The scheme had
already been cooked and was ready to go
into effect when the Milwaukee conven
tion was held. It was attended by the
general freight agents and others high in
authority on the lines in question. Gen
eral Freight Agent Smurr of the Southern
Pacific was in attendance as the repre
sentative of his company. Mr. Stubbs was
detained at New York, "having important
business with Mr. Huntington, and was
therefore unable to be present at the delib
erations. * *'*.â¢â  \y"y .77 .-.:â¢..
But Mr. Stubbs attended the meeting of
the executive committee of the association
at Chicago a week ago, and, despite the ef
forts of those on. the board who were
anxious to have the schedule of rates fixed
at the Milwaukee conference go into effect,
the question was postponed and the repre
sentatives of the different transcontinental
lines scattered to their respective homes.
Mr. Stubbs declined to discuss the situ
ation last, night. lie said he was very
much fatigued after his long journey
across the continent and seemed ardently
desirous of getting back again to the bosom
of. bis family.
. "Did the action of the executive com
mittee mean an indefinite postponement
of the rate question?" he was asited.
"Yes, that is practically what it means,"
replied Mr.. Stubbs. '7-, : 7
"Then, the executive committee flatly
refused to indorse the stand taken by the
Milwaukee conference?"
"Well, now, by boy, replied Mr. Stubbs
with a pleasant smile and a wave of the
hand, let us not discuss that matter to
night."
Pressed for further information, Mr.
Stubbs excused himself and disappeared
in the night.
English Railroad Tickets.
Last year there was issued in the United
Kingdom considerably over 911,000,000 of
railway tickets, exclusive of season tickets
and workmen's weekly tickets. It is not
easy to realize such a number. Roughly
speaking, if they had to be conveyed, say
from London to Edinburgh in a mass, it
would require 100 railway trucks, each car
rying 10 tons. If they were stacked one
upon another in a single column the pile
would be nearly 500 miles high, and if
they were laid end to end in a line it would
exceed the length of the equator by about
one-third. But no computations of this
kind can convey anything like so impress
ive an idea of the magnitude of the yearly
issue of railway tickets as can be gained
by a stroll through one or two of the estab
lishments in . which they are manufac
tured.
Up till a few years ago the bulk of our
railway tickets came from private factories
in London and Manchester. Latterly the
larger railways have been setting up es
tablishments of their own for printing
their tickets, which, however, they still
buy from outside workers in the form of
"blanks." It might reasonably be ex
pected that where the numbers required
are so vast the printing would be done in
large sheets, to be afterward cut up into
tickets. This, however, is not the way it
is done. Pasteboard is specially made for
the purpose, but it is sliced up into "blank"
tickets, each to be printed and numbered
one by one afterward.â Chambers' Journal.

Miss Fannie Benjamin of Los Angeles, the grand
president of the Beoekahs, was in this City last
week preparing her report to be presented to the
State Assembly. Miss Benjamin is a young, petite
woman with a pleasant face, sharp' bright eyes,
and while there is nothing about her to denote the
new woman her work during the past year shows
that she is ambitious, energetic aud desirous to
carry out in the fullest the very responsible duties
imposed upon her. some time ago, when she be
came aware that in the southern part of the btate
she would be called ui-on to institute a lodge that
would work in the German language, she did what
very few officers would have done she studied the
German language so that she might be abie to per
form the work herself, and she did that work. She
has visited more out-of-the-way lodges than any
other president ever has, for she believes that every
lodge that she can call upon is entitled to a visit
tiom the head of the order. Being conscientious
as well as enthusiastic she does not mind i ersonal
discomfort or fatigue so long as she is advancing
the order and by her advice and explanation help
ins the members of the subordinates to fully un
derstand and appreciate the beauties of Odd Fel
lowship as far as it applies to the Bebekahs. A
few months ago she determined to visit the lodges
in the extreme northern countiei of the State,
where visits In the past have been very rare.
When she hail mapped out her route she was in
formed of the great distance by stage she would
have to travel, an undertaking that would have
made a man of robust physique falter, but she
answered that she would 'stage it," holding that
It was her duty to visit those lodges as much as it
was her duty to visit those that are on the Hue of
ea?y and comfortable traveL It Is such as Miss
Benjamin who keen alive the spirit of fraternity.

In the report of the proceedings of the Grand

while Mrs. Carleton would have made a most effi
cient secretary, being thoroughly conversant with
the affairs of the order, it was S. B. Carleton who
was chosen for that office. He was the only one of
the grand officers re-elected and it is an honor of
which he can feel proud. He can also feel proud of
the further fact that this is the ninth time that he
has been elected to rill that responsible office.

OLD-TIME CONTEIBUTOES.
Pay Received by '..Writers in English
Newspapers.
Coleridge took at times an exaggerated
view of his services to the Morning Chron
icle. His surprising statement that Stuart
in 1800 offered him Â£2000 a year if he would
devote himself to journalism, that he de
clined on the ground that he would not
give up "the reading of old folios" for
twenty times Â£2000, and that he considered
any pay beyond Â£350 as a real evil, is ob
viously impossible. Stuart probably tried
to spur his indolent contributor by saying
that his services would be worth some such
sum if they could be made regular. But
the statement is only worth notice here in
illustration of the state of the literary mar
ket at the lime. Southey acknowledges
his gratitude for the guinea a week which
he received as Stuart's "laureate."
Poetry, by the way, appears to have
been more in demand '.hen than at the
present day.. Both Perry and Stu?rt's
elder brother ' offered to employ Burns,
and Coleridge, Southey, Campbell and
Moore all published poems in the news
papers. Lamb tried his hand at "jokes."
"Sixpence a joke," he says, "and it was
thought pretty high, too, was Dan Stuart's
settled remuneration in these cases," he
says (Newspapers Thirty-live Years Ago),
and no paragraph was to exceed seven
lines. In a letter of 1803 Lamb says that
he has given up his "two guineas a ween"
from the Post. .. 3 : Â.
The high-water, mark of a journalist's
earnings at the end of the last century is
probably marked by the achievement of
Mackintosh,* who earned 10 guineas in a
wÂ°ek. "No paper could stand it!" ex
claimed the proprietor, and the bargain
had to be revised. A few years later, how
ever, we are told that Sterling, the father
of Carlyle' friend, was receiving the sum
which Coleridge supposed himself to have
refused, namely, Â£2Â« 00 a year for writing
leading articles in the Times. Stuart, jit
would seem, in the earlier period, was
paying the fair value of their wares to Col
eridge, Sou they and their like, but in the
days of Scott and Byron the price of popu
lar writing was going up by leaps and
bounds. â National Review. -7 ;,-i
I Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for tht
days; thou- underneath it, If any, the amount ol
rainfall, of melted stow in Inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. â¢ Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; Isj
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and' is usually preceded
and accompanied by Bloody weather and rams.
"Lows" usually- first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extent
north and south along th" coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "1.,w" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in die vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California const, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and coder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result. / *

The Tourist-Attorney and the

Experiences.
PROTECTED BY HIS DOG.
Chief of Police Lloyd's Argument in
Favor of Granting Woman the
Right to Vote.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
808 Broadway. April 26. J
After nearly twenty years, during which
neither knew whether the other was dead
or alive, Mayor Davie and W. L. Fanning,
attorney for the Hotel Association, met
Friday night. Mr. Fanning is here as a
member of the hotel men's excursion.
Friday morning he read an article in a
newspaper about some one named J. L.
Davie fighting all kinds of alleged mu
nicipal *JOD3.
"Wonder if that's John L.?" mused
Fanning.
"Sullivanâ where?" said a companion
from Texas, jumping from his seat.
"No, no; another John L.â a friend of
mine," said Fanning.
The same day Fanning came over to
this city and hunted up the Mayor. It
was nearly 5 o'clock and Mayor Davie was
in his office. The Mayor makes it his
boast that he attends to municipal busi
ness from 2t05 p. m. Fanning walked in.
He said something. So did Davie. Then
they shook hands and for the first time
during the administration the Hotel As
sociation attorney induced his Honor to
leave the City Hall three minutes before 5.
Then they took in some of San Francisco
and a little of -Oakland, and last night
Mayor Davie returned from San Jose
alone.
"Fanning is half an hour older than I
am," said John L. Davie to-day. "He was
born in the next room to where I was born
in a little house in Saratoga County, New
York State, over forty years ago. When
he was less than an hour old I was born,
and we grew up together till we were
young men. Then wo parted and heard
no more of each other till last Friday.
Fanning did better than I did. Although
he is a Democrat he declined an offer ot a
Police Judgeship worth $8000 a year
from Republican Mayor Strong of
New York. Now he has a most
lucrative practice. I am hurrying
myself to my grave for $3000 a year,
everybody who has a design against the
treasury they number thousands
wishes I was there now. I asked Fanning
what he would advise a man to do under
those circumstances. He replied, 'Stand
in,' and charged me a bottle of chamgagn6
. for his advice. Of course he spoke in fun,
but he drank the champagne in earnest.
: Chief of Police Lloyd is an ardent advo
cate of woman's suffrage. He is more
convinced to-day than he ever was that
the lords of creation should not have a
monopoly of the franchise. In fact it
would be safer in some instances he thinks
to trust with dogs rather than with men.
"You see that name Fred Gibson on the
docket," said the chief this afternoon.
"He is booked for drunk. He is in a cell
now stupid from drink. But he's safe as
far as harming himself is concerned, be
cause his intelligent dog is with him. Last
night Gibson came out of a saloon on
Upper Broadway so drunk that he lay
down in the gutter and went to sleep. He
was accompanied by his dog and when
the rain fell the brute tried to keep it off
his master. Several people went to see
what the matter was, but the attitude of
the dog did not encourage them to go too
close. The officer on the beat rang in for
the patrol wagon and it was a long job
getting the poor fellow into the patrol
wagon.
"The dog was furious for a time and
would not allow any one to approach his
master. Finally the animal became con
vinced that the officers would not harm
the man, so he permitted them to place
him in the patrol wagon. But the dog
jumped up, too, and stood guard til! the
City Hall was reached. Then there was a
little more trouble, but tbe animal was
tractable then and seemed to appreciate
the attention shown his helpless master.
The dog went into the cell, and is in there
certainly the most intelligent ani
mal of the two. If the ballot is safe in
the hands of men who trust their.lives to
dumb animals, I do not think we have
anything to fear from the women."
The merchants and landed proprietors
of this county have recently been consider
ing the best method of advertising this
district and laying the foundation for an
era of municipal improvements that will
have a tendency to build up and induce
people to come to this city. It would
seem that the grand opportunity is at
hand. There is now in this part of the
State the greatest body of advertisers that
can begot togetherâ the visiting hotel men
from the East. They are here for pleas
ure, and, like all American business men,
there is always an eye open for information.
Unless something is done at once to induce
these tourists to put in one day in Oakland
they will return with the idea that the
second largest city in California exists
only in name. The information imparted
by a hotel man in the course of a year is
incredible. He is a standing advertise
ment, and the Merchants' Exchange and
the Board of Trade surely do not need to
be told of the nature of the information
that the excursionists would derive from a
drive through Oakland, around the State
University and across to Alameda.
: They could never foruet a city whose
electric service is considered the most
complete in the country. A glimpse of
the Piedmont hills, which will soon be
come thickly settled residence property,
and of the Oakland harbor would convey
an impression not easily lost to men with
eyes for business. At present, however, it
looks as if, when the hotel men return
home and are asked about Oakland, they
will be forced to remark, "Oh, yes, we saw
that place â from across the bay."

THE CHURCH AND STATE
Father Yorke Speaks of the Spir
'..: itual and the Political
Man.
Statement That Catholics Desire a
Papal President at Washington
Declared a Calumny.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 26. j
Had St. Francis de Sales' Church been
twice as big it would not have been too
large to hold the crowd that tried to enter
it to-night to hear Rev. Father Yorke lec
ture on the "Church and State."
Half an hour before the. time for the lec
ture to commence there was standing
room only and when Father Yorke as
cended the rostrum not a foot of space was
unoccupied.
The lecturer commenced by stating that
God is government, ana as God alone is
responsible for our creation and our death
and for our experience after death, the
spiritual man is of far more value than the
political man. - 3
"Each man fills two distinct spheres,"
said the speaker. "He has a spiritual na
ture and a political nature. We teach the
youth in the Catholic church that to obey
the laws of the country, to be patriotic and
obedient to his superiors is the greatest
and most important duty in this life. We
do not teach that the law of the church is
superior to the law of God, because we
admit of no comparison. We hold, and so
teach, that it is impossible to blend the
two natures of man. The spiritual nature
is of course the superior of the two, be
cause it is everlasting. The political life
is only while we are in this world, and is
mostly inferior in the estimation of the
Catholic church to the spiritual life.
"All these slanderous "reports about our
desire to install a Pope at Washington
and take him as our President -is a
calumny. We are united, and conse
quently we are strong, for i n union there
is strength. But if we were not united
under one head what would become of us?
We would simply b â¢ an aggregation of
little churches, and we should soon lose
our identity and our usefulness as a body
would be at an end. It would seem to me
1 that there is an attempt being made at
this time to create a spirit of anarchy in
spiritual life. The people have tolerated
anarchy in civil life, but never will it be
tolerated in our spiritual lives. We are
superior to government only in this way
that government is only for this life, but
the church is everlasting. While we are
here we are bound as. good citizens and
good Catholics to obey all laws and help
to see that others obey them.
"But the laws of God are responsible for
us for eternity. They brought us into life
and they will care for us after death. We
never can blend these two lives and we
should be belittling our loved church by
acknowledging that there could be a union
of church and state, or in other words of
the political and religious natures of man.' '
HERZ IMBER CHALLENGED
Spiritualists Resent His Claim
to Being " One of the
Thirty-Six.
A Local Occultist From Burmah Cham.
pions the Cause of the
* Theosophists.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
: 908 Broadway, April 26. J
The spiritualists of Oakland, and they
have increased in number since Eva Fay
mystified Judges and politicians at the
Macdonough, are greatly worked up over
the manner in which their beliefs has been
handled by Naphtaly Herz Imber, who is
at present in San Francisco. They resent
his imputations regarding their phenomena
and are arranging for a public contest be
tween Herz Imber and Professor Dantzic,
who has long posed aa"a white Mahatma."
In a few days a formal challenge will be
sent under the auspices of some local
psychic society to Herz Imber to meet the
local champion of spiritualism on the pub
lic platform. The contest will be partly
debate and partly manifestations.
Mr. Dantzic is a Burmese with an inter
esting history, some of which is given in
his own language:
"I was born in Rangoon, Burmah,
thirty-three years ago. My father was a
native merchant, my mother of French
extraction. Being an only child I was al
lowed to do much as I pleased. My early
and first impressions of anything that in
terested me outside of the home circle
were the extraordinary manifestations of
the Hindoo jugglers and tho wonderful
performances of the oft-appearihg famous
Warwick troupe. At the age of 12 I began
experimenting for myself in the mysteri
ous and marvelous manifestations of the
yogi, Gurus and Brahmins, and soon at
tracted the attention of an old strolling
fakir at that time residing in our midst.
Under his tuition I soon gained quite a
reputation for one so young.
"Imber is a harmless crank. His at
tacks on the rabbis everywhere is shame
ful. Has the poor mortal ever seen the
home of the Mahatmas, or are the Hima
laya Mountains not to be found on his
map. There has been â and always will
cranks of the Imber type.
"The beautiful philosophy of occult sci
ence has been recognized .by the most
brilliant minds of the century, vet, says
this false prophet of Kabbala, all spiritu
alistsâhimself alone exceptedâ are frauds.
Nearly my whole life having been de
voted to the study of occult science I
gladly invite this 'poet of the Jews' to
step upon the stage and give him the op
portunity to prove his assertions.
"If he knows anything about the Ma
hatmas, or if he can show that our beauti
ful philosophy is a fraud, here is his
golden opportunity. Let him meet me on
the platform and unearth the whole busi
ness, and if successful I will devote the en
tire proceeds to any charity he may name.
"Now I earnestly ask this Hebrew Kab
bali wonder to take up this defi and to
prove that the Mahatmas are frauds and
his claim to being one cf the 'inspired 86'
is genuine."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 27, 1896.
GREETED BY BIG HOUSES
Consul Booth-Tucker Leads Three
Meetings :at the Taber
nacle.
MANY LITTLE ANGLICISMS.
Uses No Term but "My Brother m
When Alluding to Ex-Commander
Ballington-Booth.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 26. \
Three large audiences greeted Consul
Booth-Tucker at the Mills Tabernacle
to-day. Her appearance here has created
great interest and those who lieard ncr
could not help comparing her with Mrs.
Ballington Booth, who spoke in the First
Presbyterian Cnurch some months ago.
Owing to recent difficulties there has
been much speculation as to tbe reception
that would be awarded the consul on her
appearance in this city, where the Salva
tion Army has always been held in great
Consul Booth-Tucker at the Oakland Tabernacle. The Consul Is the Successor of Ballington Booth
and Is Now Making Her Initial Tour in Her New Command.
regard. The general verdict here is that
Ballington Booth made a mistake and so
far not a single member of the army has
declared sympathy for his volunteer move
ment to the extent of receding from the
Salvation Army. The reception tendered
the consul was certainly as cordial as
that accorded any member of the Booth
family with the exception of the general
and there was nothing in to-day's demon
stration that was significant of any trouble,
except the brief remarks of Mrs. Booth-
Tucker. These made it clear that there
has been gross misrepresentation some
where.
The consul's explanation is clear and
straightforward. She says that every con
cession that could be made by loving
hearts to Ballington has been made, but
that to go farther would necessitate direct
disobedience to the army regulations, and
would lay the foundation for endless com
plications in the future.
One of the most touching references
made by Mrs. Booth-Tucker was that re
ferring to the pledge taken by all the chil
dren before their mother to support the
Salvation Army.
. "All the world knows our sainted
mother," said the consul. "She was not
our mother alone, but the mother of the
army, She it was whose godly advice
prompted the general to open that old
Christian mission in the east end of Lon
don that eventually grew into the Salva
tion Army. That mother did all she could
to insure perfect union in our family, and
never shall I forget the time when we all
pledged that dear saint, now in glory, that
we should live and die in the Salvation
Army. Oh, friends Ido not for a moment
put any credence in the report that we are
interested in having my brother stay out
of the army. 33-
God knows that the thought
that we are not one in every
thing is the most bitter thought that has
ever entered my life. llt is breaking our
hearts and is clouding the dear general's
life as it was never clouded before. I would
be unfaithful to my hope in God aid I ever
give up believing that he will return to the
ranks. For a long time I looked after the
interests of the Woman's Training Home
in London and my brother was in charge
of the men's garrison. We thought to
gether, we worked together â  and we re
joiced .: over our successes and wept over
our sorrows together, and now* there is
nothing in my life that I desire more than
to see us again united."
Throughout the whole day the consul
never referred even indirectly to the dis
sensions in the ranks except in terms of
the most marked love and friendship. In
the prayers and the addresses any refer
ence to the late commander was ; carefully
avoided and references to loyalty were not
made as definite as usual, presumably, so
that no possible spirit of antagonism would
be charged to his successor.
Mrs. Booth-Tucker never uses the word
Ballington in public. This was noticed
throughout the day, and it was said by one
of her intimate friends that she could not
do so without her feelings getting control
of her. All day it was noticed; that it was
"my brother" of whom she spoke.
The consul's frequent anglicisms were
a source of great interest to her audiences.
Her references to tram cars, chapels and
other things decidedly English caused fre
quent smiles. She rapidly detected it,
however, and invariably explained it by
saying: -'Well, you may have other
names for these things, but I am here to
learn and am not particularly slow."
The morning's service was a holiness
meeting, and Mrs. Booth-Tucker tool-, for
the text the story of Naaman and his heal
ing from leprosy. Her personal experi
ences with lepers in India enabled her to
speak with great force, and at the close
many went out to the penitent form.
The afternoon and evening services were
largely attended and were conducted as
usual "hallelujah" meetings, noted for
their enthusiasm and earnestness.
A Light Crop Assured.
OAKLAND, Cal., April There is no
further doubt that the fruit crop this
year will be the lightest known for years.
The cherry crop is about a failure, and
even apricots are becoming scarce. H. W.
Meek, the largest grower at San Leandro,
says he never before witnessed such a
wiping out of the cherry crop. It now
loots as though buyers would have to pay
8 cents a pound and even more for cherries.
. fishing Is Poor.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 26.â The fishing
is about exhausted in San Leandro Creek.
After the upper portion of the creek ha d
been pretty thoroughly cleaned out
the fishermen turned their attention to
the new creek, or that portion near the
bay, with the result that there are few
fish left there at this time.

Gambling Cases to Be Heard This

ALAMEDA, Cal., April 26.â arbi
tration committee appointed by Company
G last Thursday night to establish a
modus vivendi held a meeting this after- j
noon. Some satisfactory method was
evolved. Nothing definite can be learned,
however, as a good deal of reticence is dis
played all round. It is said by those who
profess to know that at the end of June
Captain Chipman will tender his resig

mittee were not present.
The Gambling Cages.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 26.â Some three
weeks ago City Attorney Taylor caused
complaints to be entered against Joseph
Emeric and Powell Bros, for carrying on
gambling-rooms on Park street. The cases
will be heard in the Recorder's Court next
Wednesday and Thursday mornings.
Speculation is rife as to the outcome. The
city attorney has summoned as witnesses
the chief participants in the games and
they are feeling uncomfortable. They do
not wish their names to get into the
columns of the press and desire the de
fendants to plead guilty and escape with a
small fine. The defendants, on the other
hand, say there is no law extant to stop
them from allowing poker to be played on
their premises; that if they plead , guilty
the police force will be compelled to be
ever on their tracK, and that the partici
pants in the games who are witnesses
have not offered to club together and put
up the fine, though they have had all the
fun. Hard things, too,- are said about
Taylor and his "playing" for the church
vote. â  - -
Police Offenses.
ALAMEDA, Cal., 3 April 26. â Joseph
Victors, the city poundkeeper, was arrested
to-day at the instance of C. Hibbard for
exhibiting jf a deadly 'â  weapon. Hibbard's
cow was wandering and the poundkeeper
took her into his possession. .This led to
words as to Victors' authority and the sub
sequent exhibition of a loaded revolver.
The police are determined to put a stop
to " scorching" on the main thorough
fares, and as an example H. Reunheim
was arrested by - Officer Lamp â  to-day for
fast riding on Park street.
A German journal says that Prince Bis
marck now possesses all the Prussian dec
orations, and has exhausted all the honors
that it is possible for the Emperor to con
fer upon him.
A NOTED PHILOSOPHER
Professor John Watson of Queen's
College Will Lecture in
Berkeley.
THE ATHLETES CHAGRINED.
'97's Blue and Gold Out on Wednes-
Examinations Commence.
How the Athletes Feel.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 26. -Dr. John
Watson, the celebrated Enelish philoso
pher, of Queen's College, Queenstown,Can
ada, will arrive in Berkeley next Satur
day for the purpose of delivering a series of
lectures in his specialty to the Theosoph
ical Union of the State University. Dur
ing the entire week, beginning with Mon
day the 4th prox., Professor Watson will
deliver lectures and hold discussions be
fore the union and its immediate friends,
but on the evening of May 12 he will de
liver a free public lecture at the gymna
sium on the university grounds, which
will be in nature similar to the address
delivered by Professor Josiah Royqe of
Harvard last May. The members of the
union, of which there are at the present
time upward of 200 on the active roll, are
anticipating the lectures of Dr. Watson
with much pleasure and satisfaction, since
he is recognized as being one of the ablest
philosophers on the American Continent
to-day. He comes under circumstances
similar to those of Dr. Royce last yearâ
the union paying his expenses and fur
nishing him entertainment while here.
Professor Watson has never visited the
Pacific Coast, and, consequently, is known
here only through his writings and through
those who have met him in the East. He
is just 48 years of age at this time, and has
been at the head of the department of
philosophy at Queen's College since 1872,
a period .of twenty-four years. He . was
graduated from the University of Glasgow,
having received from that institution the
degrees of M.A. and LL.D., after which
he studied for a lime at Oxford.
While at Oxford he was a pupil of Dr.
Kant, the eminent writer of treatises on
philosophy, and was also under Professor
Jewett, master of Balliol College, Oxford.
For the oast year the union at Berkeley
has been discussing Dr. Watson's work on
"Kant and His English Critics," and it is
this work which will form the central topic
of discussion at the meetings in May.
It is the purpose of the union to bring to
this coast each year some man of emi
nence in the world of philosophical
thought for the purpose of conducting
discussions and delivering lectures on
some particular line of metaphysics. In
tense interest was centered in the lectures
of Dr. Royce last year, and the union has
felt that the good derived from them is a
sufficient justification for the indefinite
continuance of these addresses from emi
nent men. The union has had a healthy
existence from .its very inception, which
was in 1889, to the present time, and is con
stantly broadening in its scope. At the
present time the members of the union are
divided into four ordersâ honorary, cor
respondent, active and associate. D. 0.
Mills is at the present time the only hon
orary member.
Of the correspondent members there are
Professor josiah Roye of Harvard, Presi
dent Scburman of Cornell, Mrs. Ella
Mitchell of Denver, author of "The Study
of Greek Philosophy," Professor John
Watson of Queen's College and Hon. W.
B. Harris, United States Commissioner of
Education. . * \v.***;o *33r 'â 'â¢*' *
The active members are made up of
those who have been in some way con
nected with the department of philosophy
at the university, and the associate mem
bers are made up of those who are outside
of the university, but are interested in the
work of the union. â¢'.-;..;
â Professor Hawison, head of the depart
ment at Berkeley, stated to-day that he
looked upon the coming of Professor Wat
son as furnishing one of the greatest lit
erary and philosophical feasts which the
university has had in many years. . 3 *: ;

The rain was accommodating enough to

The Alameda men went in first. HoEue,

doors that will carry them into the center
of the City in less time than it took one of
the old jogging bobtail cars to traverse
four blocks.
On the east side of Mission road, rising
on tbe slanting side of Silver Heights, can
be seen house after house, either in course
of erection or those that have been re
cently built. The same can be seen on
the north side of the road all along Sun
ny side slope and the valley lying beneath
the Industrial School lands, even out
along the ocean road as far as Ingleside,
where a few years ago a battery of the
Presidio could practice target shooting
without the danger of injuring a living
thing.
To-day the neat little cottage stands
with its coat of white paint and garden
grounds laid out, where in a few years
flowers will bloom and tender vines will
entwine themselves around these stake
Ereservers, giving the heretofore desolated
illside a new life and an impetus to pros
perity.
The Market-street Railroad Company is
extending its electric track from the race
course entrance out to the Ingleside Hotel,
or Corbett Road House, as it is better
known.
This line when finished will approach
the entrance to the City and County Alms
house. ,33 r -
From all appearance the railroad com
pany is in haste to have this extension in
running order, as there were a gang of 100
men working there yesterday.
How much farther the road will extend
is not known, but some seem to think that
it will run to the ocean and along the beach
to the south entrance of the Golden Gate
Park.
A CASE OF MAYHEM.
An Old Man Has His Nose Bitten Off* by
a Young Ruffian.
Andrew Welsh, 61 years of age and a
soldier of the war, got into a row with a
young man on Eddy street last evening
and had his nose bitten in two. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital and
treated by -Dr. Stice, but .will be marred
for life. ... .77. ;:â¢'â¢; 3..
He states that he was passing quietly
along Eddy street, at the crossing of
Mason,, when a young man standing by
the curb applied some insulting language
to him. Ho struck the fellow and they
clinched and fell. As they struggled upon
the ground his antagonist sunk his teeth
through his nose, taking a piece fairly out
of it. He then sprang to his feet and made
his escape. He does not know the fellow
and the police have made no arrests.
Imber and Kabbi Fryer.
Naphtaly Hers Imber, the apostle of the Cab
bala, has gotten into a controversy with Rabbi
Fryer of the Bush-street Synagogue. Rabbi
Fryer has declared Imber to be a faker and not
what he represents himself to be, and Imber
has replied in kind. He has charged the rabbi
with illiteracy and challenged him to trans
late certain words of the Bible from the orig
inal. The rabbi has accepted and the two will
meet for the test this afternoon at 3 o'clock in
the vestry of the Temple Emanu-El.

DR. YORK'S LECTURE.
Christianity and Atheismâ Charles
Darwin an Atheist?
Dr. York spoke to a good house last
evening at Scottish Hall on the subject.
"Which Is the Most Rationalâ -Atheism or
Christian Theism?" with a prelude on
Darwin and the development theory. The
speaker said :
"The theory of natural development,
known as Darwinism, to most thinking
people seems to be a more rational solution
of the problem of how things in the organic
world came into existence than the ac
count given in the Hebrew Bible.
"And previous to the year 1860 the
scientific opinions upon the process of de
velopment of the organic world was one of
chaos, and men of science were apparently
groping in the dark. And every one who
rejected the special creation hypothesis
found himself unable to propose a theory
which would find acceptance in rational
thinking minds. Professor Huxley says
that in 1857 he had no answer ready, and
he does not think that any one else had
any satisfactory answer to the problem of
creation. But in the fullness of time
Charles Darwin came and the darkness
was turned to light, and his book, 'The
Origin of Species, has been a cathode ray
in dispelling the darkness transmitted
from the childhood of our race.
"Charles Darwin was not an atheist, save
in a Christian sense, but believed that the
Deity was the supreme power of nature,
permeating the world of matter andjnind.
Darwinism is not atheism, in the sense of
a denial of a God. but is agnostic on that
subject, and is not even antagonistic to
Christian theism, only so far as the theory
of evolution exposes the childish absurd
ity of dogmatic theology. Darwin teaches
that man and all the higher forms of life
upon the globe are simply the modified
forms, or descendants, of lower forms of
life; and Professor Huxley says that the
mode of origin and the early stages of the
development of mankind are identical
with those of the animals immediately
below him in the scale."
Pointing to one conclusion, is the theory
of Darwin, sustained by a monument of
facts, that man, with other animals most
nearly allied to him has descended from
a common ancestor. And after all, even
if man had his origin in common witn
lizards, snakes and apes, and monkeys,
there does not seem to be anything more
depressing in such origin than in the Bible
story, of being made of dust and falling
from* perfect state to a state ot sin and
misery. And we think that Darwinism is
far the most scientific, rational and hope
ful view of life and origin of things, be
sides the more hopeful as pointing to a
progressive future for man as an individ
ual and as a race. 7X7 1
To my mind there is nothing in evolu
tion that precludes the possibility' of life
beyond. Science teaches that the disso
lution of one variety produces the evolu
tion of the next variety. The invertebrate
dies, and the lish appears; the fish
perishes, and the amphibinm is born; he
gives way to the reptile, and the reptile
gives way to the mammal, and from the
mammal man is developed. Why should
evolution stop here? Are we the pinnacle
of life? Or are we but one of the links in
ti.at endless chain stretching out from the
darkness of the past, and on we know not
whither? If nature began with the mol
lusk must she stop with the human? I
simply do not know. And while it is true
that one world at a time is about as much
as most people can attend to, yet we
would not disparage the hope of any one
of meeting their loved ones beyond the
grave. '<â  .
CATHODE BAY EXTENSION
It Now Beams Brightly in the
Cogswell Polytechnic
College.
What Principal Buchanan Expects
to Discover With His Home-
Made Machines.
The latest thing to be penetrated by the
all-seeing cathode rays, discovered by Pro
fessor Roentgen, is the Cogswell Poly
technic College. An electrical machine of
wood, glass and metal has just been con
structed there, and students and teachers
will soon be deeply absorbed in scientific
experiments to test the intensity and
penetrability of the wonderful X rays.
"It is our intention," said Principal L.
A. Buchanan, "to keep abreast of the
times, so far at least as our rather limited
means and equipments will permit, and,
of course, the . recent great discovery of
Professor Roentgen cannot be ignored.
With this iaea I had our students con
struct, during the late holidays, a sixteen
inch plate Wimshurst machine, which
i will be operated by a small electro-motor.
Besides the cathode-ray . experiments, this
machine can be used for class illustration
purposes in other studies. The boys were
much interested in the making of it, and
by our labor we have saved some $75 on its
cost. 3^3; . \ 3333* 333333 ;
"Our induction coil lacks the proper
sparking capacity. It is a fine instrument
for class uses, but gives a spark of only
about one inch with all the battery I dare
connect to it. With this and after long
exposure we have produced a number of
plates of coins and glass and metals
tested for their density. Within a month
we expect to have a bigger machine of the
Wimshurst type completed and in opera
tion, also another induction coil capable
of giving a five or six inch spark, and a
pump, so that we can then give a clear
demonstration and observe every detail of
the phenomenon. We shall in this way
be entitled .to secure the attention of our
students, to bold their interest and to
teach them tie best methods of| original
investigation, as well as give them some
practical ideas of mechanical designs and
construction." 77} 7*
"What will be the immediate results of
your experiments?"
. "Well, of course, that is difficult to
state precisely, but when I've concluded
the series of . experiments I have now in
my mind I trust that, aside from their
educational benefit to the students, we
shall possess a better knowledge of the
law of. the intensities of the cathode rays
and of the relation existing between the
energy required and the intensities. I
found by experiment with a radiometer
that it was hardly affected by the rays.
This may be in consequence of the impene
trability of glass. The calorific effect upon
a sensitive thermoscope is also an inter
esting experiment, while the result, com
ing from magnetic disturbances.is peculiar,
and an investigation may lead to tbe dis
covery of new and surprising truths.
. "All of the phenomena tend to the study
of the rarer ether and will probably aid
materially in solving the molecular and
atomic structure of all things, especially
of light, magnetism and the undulatory
theory connected with it.
"Professor Roentgen, in the course of
his numerous experiments, finds that the
transmission of the rays is affected *in
some degree by the density of bodies. The
retina of | the eye, he says, is not affected
by the rays and no calorific effect has as
yet been noted. The cathode ray thus far
has perhaps been of the greatest practical
benefit in surgery, but the possibilities of
its development are almost limitless and it
will soon, I think, be used to equally great
advantage in the industrial world to test
the materials employed in engineering
etc." 7 * -.â "*-. . â ;

HOUSEWARMING BOW.
Daniel Crowley, a Teamster, Booked
on two Charges of Assault With
a Deadly Weapon.
J. Monahan of the Western House, 212
Broadway, was married about a week ago
and invited his friends to a housewarm
ing on Saturday night.
Daniel Crowley, a teamster, and Daniel
Buckley and James Murphy, railroad em
ployes living in East Berkeley, were
among the guests. There bad been a long
standing grudge between Crowley and the
two men from East Berkeley, and shortly
before 3 o'clock yesterday morning there
was a fight, and Buckley and Murphy were
found unconscious on the street in front of
the Western House by Policeman Dwyer.
The patrol wagon was summoned and
the two men were taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbon attended
to them. Buckley's nose was broken and
his face badly swollen. Murphy's lips
were split open and his face was bruised
and hattered. >-v 3S V *3-
They said that some one had hit them
with a bootjack as they were leaving the
Western House logo to 521 Howard street,
where they were to stay the rest of the
night. -3*3 3
Yesterday morning Policeman Dwyer
arrested Crowley and Buckley and Mur
phy identified him as the man who as
saulted them. Dwyer took Crowley to the
City Prison and booked him on two
charges of assault with a deadly weapon.

THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME
TO CONSULT THE GREAT CLAIRVOYANT
AND MEDIUM PROF. F. EUGENE.
1728 MARKET ST.
The professor during his long residence in *-an
Francisco has met with unprecedented success,
He could refer you to people all over the world for
testimonials as to his wortb, but it is not neces-
sary to search the extremetles of the earth
when he can refer you to thousands in your midst
who have been made prosperous and happy
through his wise advice; ask your prosperous
neighbor who started him aright. Investigate and
you will find that your business rival is one of his
many patrons.
'â¢Nothing succeeds like success," and if you
would be successful call on him without delay; it
costs practically nothing: SOc and $1, and 91,
50c and $1. 60c and $1, 50c and $1 is his price
at present, no more than you would pay an un-
known clairvoyant or a partially developed
medium.
His readings astonish the most skeptical. All
are satisfied. The professor gives advice on ail
matters that are of interest to humanity. Busi-
ness, speculation, investments, Insurance, love,
courtship, marriage and divorce; settles lovers'
quarrels and causes speedy and happy marriages.
He locates mines and buried treasures, find* lost
or stolen property, interprets dreams, cures bad
habits and destroys evil influences in half the
time required by the best of the other mediums.
Bemember. there are but few mediums in the
world that can work these wonders, and none out-
Side of the eminent professor in San Francisco.
Remember PROP. EUGENE'S communications
come direct from the Spirit World, hence his in-
ability to be mistaken in any matter.-
Remember also that the Professor is perma-
nently located in San Francisco: he is here to stay.
Hours 10 a. m. to 8 p. m. Letters containing
stamps answered. PROF. EUGENE,

would be almost 27 feet of water at high

At 10 o'clock the Oregon, silent, white
and ghostly in the bright moonlight, ar
rived off Hunters Point. Under her quar

everything was ready for the rush in when
the water was at rest. On the pier-head

to time testing its flow by throwing chips
out into the stream. ?3 3 -.
A large number of people came down to
see the battle-ship come in to the dock

Captain Harvey whistled "go ahead."

craft back into posit ion. .' 333:3',^

the Hercules,* which was on that side of
the ship, and though she made tbe beams
of her sister tug groan, her strong 'engine

To-day the great pumps will draw the
water from under her and she will settle

long, "is aboriginal money, and in Aus

of this City and well known as a physiog
nomist,' but now his permanent home is in
New York. :He has traveled three times
around the world and is a collector of
curios and a student of all that is odd in
people and things. He spent three years
in Australasia, and while there secured
many oddities, a portion of which he has
donated to the museum. The string of
money is one of these.
Miss Oxnard has donated two very odd
silver dresspins used by the women of Al
geria.
Louis Sarony of this City has presented
a letter dated Philadelphia, December 15,

One is signed by Thomas "Jefferson as
President and James Madison as Secre
tary of State, and .the other by James
Monroe as President and Jonn Quincy
Adams as Secretary of State.
' The granite base on which will rest the

BISHOP DUBS.
He Preached a Sermon in Grace Metho-
dist , Kpiseopal Church on the
'.Testimony of Christ.
i Grace Methodist Episcopal Church, at
Twenty-first and Capp' streets, was filled
to its utmost last evening by a congrega
tion assembled* to listen* to a sermon by
Bishop R. Dubs,. D. D., of the United
Evangelical Church. . â¢
; The Bishop is a man of medium height,
inclined to stoutness,' and has a pleasant,
intelligent face. His hair and beard are
almost white. . He is a forcible and elo-
quent speaker.
His sermon, which was listened to with
profound attention, was on the testimony
of Christ. He told of*, the great truths
that are advanced by the teachers who are
working in the cause of Christ and whose
mission is to teach that there is salvation
for those who lead a good Christian life.
He dwelt at some length upon the class
that expresses 'itself against a belief in
Christ and in a hereafter, and by a num
ber of well-told anecdotes proved that
while there is no danger they continue to
maintain the â¢â¢ views they express, in
times of danger they retract and call upon
Christ to save them. .He also spoke of the
various methods of worship, and said that
no matter what the form is the finger of
each points to Calvary. ..
i The Bishop.who has been forty-one years
in the ministry, has made a flying visit to
this City. - He arrived here on Friday and
left for Chicago, his home, this morning.
NO DRIFTING INTO HEAVEN.
Man Must Be Judged by 7-.c Works
*...* of His -Earthly *-l> ..
.- The pulpit of the 'Howard Presbyterian
Church was occupied by the Rev. Dr. J.
dimming Smith at the evening service.
In his discourse the -speaker impressed
upon his hearers his abiding faith in the
inspiration (.of .the word of. God as re
vealed through the agency of man. .:-r77h
All of ' the inspired writings bore on
their "faces the imprint of truth and the
divinity of (Jesus (Christ. 3 And the man
who does not : accept' the word of God as
laid ; down in Holy Writ will have a hard
time to get into heaven. 3 -3^ *3;33 (Â¥--(
"No man," he said, "can drift into the king
dom of God by chance or strategy. â¢ He must go
there ns a man and upon the record of his life.
A sudden change of heart at -the hour of death
.will-not be sufficient." Man is the same being
when about to die that he was in the prime of
health, and if he does not receive the spirit of
God and the s teachings of Christ during his
lifetime a fear of death accompanied by a sud
den-conversion will not do -to take chances
upon ; of , drifting' into heaven under the pre
tense of not knowing better. 'â¢â¢..
--â¢ "A man to be a good Christian must be frank,
manly and: straightforward. Christ possessed
all lof those manly j qualities . when jon earth,
and in his dealings with his fellow-men, and so
must his followers now do likewise. ;

COMPOUND OF
PURE COD LIVER OIL
WITH PHOSPHATES.
Dr. Wilbor's Cod-Liver Oil and Phos-
phates has now been before the public
forty years, and has steadily grown in
favor and appreciation. This could not be
the case unless the preparation was of
high intrinsic value. The combination of
! the phosphates with pure Cod Liver; Oil,
as prepared by Dr. Wilbor, has produced
j a new phase in the treatment of consump-
| tion and all diseases of the lungs. This
article can be taken by the most delicate
invalid without creating the disgusting
nausea which is such an objection to the
Coa-Liver Oil when taken without the
phosphate. It is prescribed by the regular
faculty. Dr. Wilbor's Emulsion cures
consumption, coughs, colds, bronchitis,
debility, wasting diseases, asthma, influ-
enza, scrofulous humors, pneumonia. Sold
by all druggists.
