MAGUIRE SEES
VICTORY AHEAD
Huntington Deserted by
the Vanderbilts and
Goulds. .
ARE NOW HIS RIVALS.
Seeking to Purchase the Union
and Central Pacific at
Foreclosure Sale.
DEATH TO THE FUNDING BILL.
Their Opposition Would Mean the
Defeat of the Octopus in
Congress.
WASHINGTON. 8.C., Feb. 9.â Judge
Maguire was asked by a Call correspon
dent to-night how the fight on funding
looked, and said:
"It begins to lock now as though the
Vanderbilt and Gould interests have de
serted the refunding scheme. They were
potent factors in its support heretofore.
It now seems that the Vanderbilts, at least,
are looking for a chance to buy the Union
and Central Pacific roads at foreclosure,
sale, and thus secure a through line from
New York to San Francisco. If this be so
the funding bill will be beaten, the mort
gages foreclosed and the road either held
by the Government or sold to representa
tives of the Chicago and Northwestern sys
tem.
"If the minimum price fixed by the Gov
ernment should be considered too high,
private companies will refuse to bid above
it and the Government will either hold
and operate the roads or hold them as pub
lic highways open to traffic and the com
petition of all who may desire to put roll
ing-stock upon them. It is my hope that
this may be the result. If, on the other
hand, the Northwestern people should
purchase the roads a most powerful and
uncompromising competing line will be
established, and California will be corre
spondingly enriched." . ; . ]:}â¢'â 
ARM ISO FOR THE FRAY.
Huntington's Kentucky Lobby Arranges
''â "-- a Plan of Campaign.- .":'-'.'-."
FRANKFORT, Kr., Feb. 9.âHunting
ton, through his managers, is actively at
work against the bill to repeal the South
ern Pacific charter. It is known that the
opposition to the bill spent to-day in Louis-
Tille, and it was there that an organization
and plan of fight was arranged. All possi
ble effort will be used to bring the bill up
the early part.o f the week and pass it in
the Senate. ~ The opposition seemed to
have conceded its passage in this, branch,
but is righting against time * and bitterly
contesting every movement made in' the
direction of furthering the bill. \-t\- 'X
A desperate fight will, be made in the
House, and the members of that body have
been taken to Louisville and Cincinnati,
where they have been individually I ap
pealed to.
Senator Goebel has organized for his bill
and is aware of the movements against it.
He also spent to-day in Louisville, and is
aware of the movements of the opposition.
He said to-day he was never more confi
dent of the final passage of the bill, and
the only way it could be defeated was by
preventing it reaching a vote.
The proceedings of the Legislature next
week promise to be more exciting than
they have been in the past, and if a Sena
tor is to be elected at all this session he
will probably be named during the coming
week, and the event may come off any
day. Who it will be it is now impossible
to say, but the drift of opinion here is that
it will be neither Blackburn nor Hunter.
80 far the forces of each' have voted pretty
solidly and regularly for their man, while
the nine ' sound-money Democrats and
Populist Poor have complimented Mc-
Creary, Carlisle, Hazelrigg, Brown and
Henry Watterson by placing them on rec
ord as candidates. Populist .or has sin
gle-handed held up the name of Clarence
6. Bate for the. same honor, and Senator
Stege has brought down the execrations of
the Republicans by casting his vote for his
able and deserving fellow-townsman, the
Hon. , JAugustus E. Willson, who very
many of his party think should have had
the caucus nomination in the first place.
The result yesterday shows that the Re
publicans will fall in line for Hunter and
the Democrats about the same as before
-63 for Blackburn and 6 scattering.
The "strength of each of the two caucus
nominees, bap been . fully tested, and there
is a manifest disposition on the part of
many of the members oi each party to put
up other candidates and try to elect them,
at the jump and have the thing over. The
Courier-Journal is strong in its opposition
to Blackburn and equally strong in _ favor
of Ex-Governor Brown, though it would
support ' either ' McCreary or Carlisle as
against Blackburn. ..-.-'.â .
At least two of the sound-money Demo
crats - say they will vote for Blackburn
under no circumstances. - These are 'Sen
ator Weissinger and Representative - Car
roll. There is no reason to believe they
will go back' on their words, unless, per
haps, some trading against the repeal bill
is done. There is a cat in the meal bag
about this business. When Senator Poor
cast his vote the other day for- Brown, he
said: "I do not wish to dictate to you, but
ii you, as Kentuckians. wish to avoid the
disgrace of blotting the name of V the State
by. the adoption of revolutionary methods,
then vote for John Young. Brown," or
words to that effect.; -X\ â¢ V
The Courier-Journal has made the most .
of this, and urged the dropping of Black
burn and . the taking up of Brown, but the
Courier-Journal is 7 not noted ;â  for electing
the men it supports, and it is well known
that Brown, being for free silver, would
have the determined opposition" of 'most
of the gold men, and he would as far
from an election as Blackburn, nor can
Carlisle command the solid ?ote .of his
party, Henry" Watterson has no chance j 1

in the world. McCreary might, but it is a
question. ; v ;';f.r' . â  >. :&/J:-?fX
â¢ The likelihood is that when a break is
made it will be on the name of some new
man. . It is not improbable that it will be
John M. Atherton, the wealthy Louisville
distiller and the inventor of a certain
brand of paper. * i.; ! Ay
Dr. Hunter has been given a fair trial, and
it seems that he cannot be elected unless
his party makes two votes by unseating
Kaufman and Tompkins, but even that is
a game at which two can play, and the
Democratic Senate has already arranged
matters to make short work of unseating
four of the Republicans in their end of
the Capitol in case the Republican House
initiates it. iXX;.XXXrX~X : XX
If there is any better show with another
man than Hunter the Republicans will
likely put up Willson, who deserves the
honor as much as any man in the State.
For years he has been the leader of. tbe
forlorn hope in his own city, Louisville,
the upraiser of the failintr fortunes and or
ganizer of the campaign and promoter .of
the final victory of his party in the State.
He is an able lawyer, a fair and fearless
fighter and a fit representative of all the
people who "make up the character and
glory of the commonwealth. Willson is
much more likely to poll an electing J vote
than Hunter. In fact it is considered that
the latter is standing in the way of the
possible success of his party, and he may
yield to the pressure and retire. y'3. H
The closest attention is paid to all these
points by Echols and his men, General
Duke leading the workers among the Dem
ocrats and St. John Boyle among the .Re
publicans, and no swapping of candidates
is going to be made without their knowing
it and making the most of .it in getting
votes pledged against the repeal bill.
Here is where Goebel and his supporters
are at a disadvantage. While apparently
working in the interest of the Senatorial
candidates the lobbymen are doing their
fine work against the Goebel bill, and it
would surprise no one to see Hajs or
Weissinger call up the bill in the Senate
next week and let it go through, if they
can't help it, and on to, the House, where
they will be better prepared for it.
The party that went down to Louisville
was unusually large last night, even some
of the steady fellows who remain in Frank
fort to write home Sundays and save
money went down, no doubt attracted by
the courtesies extended to their fellows a
week ago at the . hands of the hospitable
Huntington crowd. Some who had a few
wrinkles in their shirt bosoms were no
doubt taken down to "Old Smoothing
Iron" to be straightened out. He is a
good hand at that. .
Fortune is. against the anti-repealers in
that not one of the old gang of Represent
atives from Louisville is in the House this
year, except Long Carroll.
At almost any other session the only
question .one of them would have asked in
regard to supporting or opposing a bill
was "How much is there in it?" Now it
is different. The city is represented by a
new set of men who; are supposed to be
above being actuated by any venal mo
tives,' and being yet fresh in-' their inno
| cence are likely to vote according to their
I convictions.;' Most of them have no use at
all for General Echols or either of 'his lieu
tenants, arid they can't be coaxed into vis
its to the Pendennis !to . be shown 1 what a
good and disinterested man Echols is.
Then the old pang of Louisville lobby
ists who owned", the representatives from
their respective sections !of the city, and
would contract to sell them for or against
anything that might come up, :if the price
was sufficient/were on the losing side at
the late election, and now their occupa
tion of vote-mongering is gone. It is a.
good thing for honest legislation that it is
so. Were they .on top now j all Echols
would have to do would be to see one man,
put up the \ money and the votes would be
his. Providence seems to \ have provided
for that repeal bill to go' through, and it
will if properly watched and supported.

DENIES ASTOR'S CHARGES.
Ex-Editor Cust of the Pall Mall
Gazette Assails the
American.
Declares That His Former Employer
Falsified in His Letter of
Dismissal.
LONDON, Esq., Feb. 9.â Dr. Henry
Cockayne - Cust, r formerly editor of Mr.
Astor's paper, the Pall Mall Gazette, has
sent to the Times the correspondence be
tween himself and " Mr. Astor prior to his
dismissal from the editorship of the Ga
zette. Mr. Astor complains that he bad
always found Mr. Cust unwilling to carry
out his wishes as regarded the course of
the paper.
Mr. Astor's letter of dismissal was dated
February 3, 1896. fj In it he j alludes to the
habitual disregard \of - his instructions in
December, 1893, and March, 1894, and com
plains of the sneers at and the disparaging
comments on the United States' appearing
in his paper, which, Mr. Astor. said, were
in bad taste , and extremely offensive to
him. . ' X..-XX'Xl'*X '^. ,
- Mr. Cust replies by stating that the files
of the Pall Mall Gazette conclusively dis
prove the charges, and adds that Mr. Astor
on February 1, after lavishly praising the
conduct of the , journal, especially in the
recent American crisis, curtly asked him
to resign in a week. Mr. Cust refused . as
he preferred to be dismissed. Mr. Cust in
stances instructions received from Mr.
Astor to wrote strongly in favor of the res
toration of the empire in Brazil, which in
structions were duly complied with, rl

to the observance !of January 17 last as a
Government holiday. j It was the anniver
sary of the overthrow of the monarchy in
1893,, fr0m which , event the republic of
Hawaii derived its birth. According to
custom, on .Government holidays the
various diplomatic representatives were
notified and â¢ invited to participate, as is
usually done, by display of flags and by
salutes of warships. Â». <.
. Minister Willis at once proceeded to con
fer with his colleague, of the. diplomatic
corps, the British, French and Japanese
commissioners. Being longest in service
here he was able to influence them all to
decline the invitations of the Government,
assigning as their reasons that their Gov
ernments had never recognized j the Pro
visional Government, whose birthday was
to be celebrated. . â  .; . \\
>â¢ Since, however, the Provisional Govern
ment had .been formally., recognized by
President Harrison, and Messrs. Blount
and Willis had been accredited to it by
President Cleveland, Minister Willis was
debarred from assigning a similar reason.
Accordingly, he replied by simply inform
ing Minister Cooper that he would submit
the. matter to his Government. .At thÂ«
same time .he "suppressed, the invitations
sent to Consul Mills and ,to Captain 'Pig
man of , the cruiser Bennington, who would
have fired salute. '.'*_..;.''
_\ Some f correspondence \ ensued, in which
Cooper asked for' Mr. Willis' reason
for demurring to the observance of , the
Government'- holiday. j This Government
is unwilling to concede to the representa
tives here of other Governments the right
to question the propriety of observing any
holidays which it seen fit 'to appoint.
Minister Willis, made no definite reply,
and relations are not as pleasant as is de
sirable.
X The real reason for the attitude taken by
Mr. Willis seems plain. His record seems
to forbid his honoring the 17th of January.
Two years ago lie ' officially announced to
the Provisional Government â  President
Cleveland's formal. condemnation *of the
overthrow of the Queen as a nefarious act,
effected by a conspiracy of Minister Ste
vens and the United States * naval forces,
and demanded, in i the President's name
that the great wrong should be redressed.
He cannot now consistently join in honor
ing the event which he then denounced.
- It is known that British Commissioner
Hawes afterward hastened to express his
very cordial sentiments towards the. Gov
ernment, and in an indirect way to convey
the impression that he regretted the course
he had taken. The .other diplomats are
said to hold the same view of the case.

New Cruisers to Be Added for the

Commerce.
BERLIN, Germany, Feb. 9.â Within the
past week the officially inspired German
press, which formerly had been pounding
England as hard as violent language could
go, has suddenly ceased its blasts against
Great Britain, but it cannot be ascertained
that there has been any change in the
course of policy of Germany, except that
from some cause, which is generally sup
posed to be representations on the part of
the other parties to the Triple Alliance-
Austria and Italy â the Emperor has put
a check upon German diplomatic activity
in quarters where there have been jeal
ousies upon the part of England, based
upon the supposition that Germany's atti
tude was hostiie.
â¢ The debate in the Reichstag on Friday !
upon the naval estimates gave Freiherr
Marschall yon Bieberstein, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and the members of the
Reichstag who are in touch with the Gov
ernment an opportunity to make declara
tions which were decidedly friendly to
England, and the occasion was made the
most of. i
Apart from the reassuring speech deliv
ered by Freiherr Marshall yon Bieberstein,
the most notable of the statements made
In the Chamber was the declaration of
Prince yon Arenberg, Centrist, the Presi
dent of the Colonial Society of Germany,
that at no time has there been any reason
for the anti-German excitement which has
prevailed in England. This utterance was
received with applause, in which members
of all parties joined with earnestness.
' These reassuring utterances and their
general acceptance have made it almost
certain that at the next session of the
Reichstag, when the Government's naval
eeheme is introduced, instead of its being
opposed as a warlike measure suddenly
launched with a view to taking advantage
of public excitement, it will receive the
support of the majority of the Chamber, if
it is framed upon the moderate lines indi
cated in the statements made on Friday
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
The debate has made an astonishing
change in the opinions expressed by lead
ing newspapers, even the opposition
papers admitting that an increase in the
number of cruisers for the defense of the
German trade and commercial marine is
necessary.
The vote in the Bundesrath on the Gov
ernment's sugar bill has caused a great
deal of serious comment in political
circles. For the first time since the crea
tion of the empire the vote of the Bavarian
members of the Bundesrath was thrown
against Prussia, the vote being 36 for and
21 against the measure, Wurtemberg and
Baden, besides Bavaria, being included in
the negative column. Apart from those
who are identified with the sugar interests,
the general public is opposed to the meas
ure, and when the bill comes before the
Reichstag all the members of that body
from the south and northwest of Germany
will be solidly against it, while the eastern
and northern sections are generally in
favor of the measure. According to the
Freisinnige Zeitung, the originators of
the bill are Baron yon Wedel-Piesdorf,
ant yon Alvensleben and the other own
ers of large sugar works throughout Ger
many. . "TV^
Dr. Stoecker, formerly court chaplain;
who was expelled from the Conservative
party, has announced his intention to
found a distinct group, to which several
members of the Reichstag who . approve
the Christian socialist program me will ad
here.
. The journalists who attended the recep
tion given by Prince yon Hohenlohe at the
Chanceilerie j last Wednesday agree that
the affair was distinguished for more eat
ing and drinking and less political talk
than upon the occasion of ; last I year's re
ception. . More than 600 guests were â pres
ent, but there were / among i them fewer
members of the press than have been pres
ent on similar occasions previously. This
is accounted for in a measure . by the fact,
which has become known, that after Prince
Hohenlohe had given his approval to the
list of guests Freiherr Marschall yon Bie
berstein contrived to obtain a personal re
vision of it and strike therefrom the names
of men whom be suspected of Bismarck
ism, at the same time retaining the names
of those of his own supporters c which ap
peared in the list, 'y
The consequence was that the assem
blage was far from being so representative
a gathering as heretofore. Among the
notable person's present* were Duke Ernst
Gunther, Baron Hausernann, Dr. yon Boet
ticher, vice-president of the Council of
Ministers; Dr. Miquel, Prussian Minister
of Finance, Herren Richert and Mendels
sohn and Baron yon .tumm.
The Chancellor, with bis usual urbanity,

a general rush for the buffet, which had

hall, where the guests did full justice to
an . elaborately prepared and admirably
served repast- The function concluded at
11 o'clock. The absence, of Dr. yon Bosse,
Minister â â  of Ecclesiastical Affairs, â *â  was
taken as confirmation of the rumors of his
early resignation from the Prussian Min
istry. ' ' *â ": ."â¢'" '"â¢ :7" ' ' :_â ;-.
. Baron ; Hubert yon Scborlemer-Alst has
been arrested upon the â  charge of forging
bills of exchange amounting in the aggre
gate to 80,000 marks. l Baron Hubert, who
has long been a thorn in the side of his
illustrious .-'* family, is by ;-' no means . a
stranger in New York and Chicago," though
his sojourns in tho.e cities are not* likely
to be recalled by the elite of either place.
He was formerly an officer in the Prussian
army, but got into debt and was obliged
to take a hasty departure from Germany
in consequence of his connection with a
bill of exchange . swindle. Hs was next
heard of in New York and later in Chi
cago, where he was endeavoring to earn a
living as a cabman, and finally as a porter '
His relatives cleared off his debts and se-
cured the suppression of the charges
against him, enabling him to return to;
Germany.
After bringing him home his family suc
ceeded in marrying him to a rich widow,
and he went to live with her upon her es
tate in ' Grossenheim, Saxony, where she
owned a large amount of property. For
a while he appeared to be conducting him
self properly, and became an active : mem
ber of the "local Conservative association.
He spent money freely, but as his wife had
plenty, and it was known he was living
upon her bounty, nothing was thought of
it. He finally got into debt again, how
ever, and this state of affairs was followed
by more serious charges against him.
The Conservative leaders tried to hush
the charges, and subscribed the sum of
20,000 marks to cover the face of the
fraudulent bills he had ' uttered. In the
meantime further investigation into the
Baron's affairs proceeded, with the result
that it was found that his case was beyond
help, whereupon those who had essayed to
assist him left him to his fate.
It is said that r Duke Ernst Gunther of
Scbleswig-Holstein/ brother of the Em
press of Germany, whose name was men
tioned in connection with the scandals at
taching to ex-Court Chamberlain yon
Kotze, is again living a rapid life. For a
time af the exposure of the yon Kotze
scandals, though .it was proven that he
bad no connection with the anonymous
letters, he led a quiet life as. far as could be
observed, but it is now reported that he is
fitting out his castle at Prinkenau in the
grandest style and with the utmost disre
gard of cost. In connection with these re
ports it is a fact that the Berlin money
lenders are offering his bills for sale at 50
per cent discount.

Complains That, the Insurgents Do

HAVANA, Cuba, Feb. { 9.â As told in
these dispatches on Friday the rebel forces
under Antonio Maceo wore defeated, at
Candelaria, province of Pinar del Rio, by
General Canellas and compelled to retreat
in the direction of San Cristobal. .7
On the same day Colonel { Segura with
600 men belonging to General ;Ca~nella's
column, which was in pursuit of the re
treating rebels, came upon more than 5000
of the insurgents. The Spanish column
had been divided in .order 'to more \ ef
fectively pursue the rebels, and the troops
under Colonel Segura followed the road
from Candelaria toward San Cristobal,
which, as the event' proved, was the route
taken by the rebels. As soon as the troops
came up to the insurgents the latter formed
an extensive circle about them. The
troops formed into squares and continued
the advance, keeping.up an incessant fire
that played havoc the rebel lines.
When neariug) the'yillace of Pezeo
Honde the troops -directed their attack
upon a house that was occupied by a num
ber of rebels and dislodged them. The
building was then turned into a hospital
for the troops. All this j time the rebels
were hovering near the troops, but Colonel
Segura, who had with him a piece of artil
lery, used it with good effect, and, by
means of shells, caused the insurgents to
finally fall back. - â¢ ,-
At this juncture three squadrons of cav
alry under command of Colonel Ruiz and
two companies of infantry belonging to
the Simancas Regiment opportunely ar
rived and broke. through the rebel circle,
thus saving Colonel Segura's column from
what j would ; doubtless have been an over
whelming* defeat* 1 * The Spanish losses are
given in the official report of the engage
ment as eight killed and thirty-live
wounded, while the supposed losses of the
rebels are placed -at 100 ' dead and - : 300
wounded. The above accounts of the fight
are entirely official.
Acting Captain-General Marin returned
to Havana to-day from the field. In ad
interview withjthe correspondent of The
United Press be said: .. v > ' * _
"My campaign has been , a continuation
of the plans previously followed. I have
had some encounters with both Maceo
and Gomez, but can throw no more light
upon them than is contained in the reports
that have been published of the fights."
When asked, having been in the field,
what he thought of the military organiza
tion of the insurgents, General Marin said :
"I have not altered my previous opinion.
The insurgents can never, be recognized as
an organized army, because the first con
sideration of such a body is honor, whereas
the insurgents think it no dishonor to flee
from an enemy to avoid an encounter. A
regular military body/ would think it a
dishonor to attack < defenseless soldiers,
whereas the ; insurgents think nothing of
it. They do not hesitate to force men into
their ranks during their ' passage through
the country, which results in the im
pressed men becoming, targets for the
Spanish army, 'â  ? In one word, what the in
surgents' organization is, is a question."
"It is said that the Spanish: army is rap
idly being changed from infantry to cav
alry. Is that policy to be ; continued?" i
"No infantry has been changed into cav
alry. The regular- cavalry bodies here
have been mounted as fast as horses could
be procured." , , Vy ..',..
â¢â¢If , the Spanish had had more cavalry
would the result up to the present time
have brought the war nearer an end?'' ,
â¢â¢If the Spanish had had more cavalry
the insurgents would ; have adopted ' ; other
means of warfare. Therr great force lies
in a policy of deviating from all lines of
warfare. In other words, /war. with them
is merely anarchy. If we had bad plenty
of cavalry they would have resorted -to
ambuscades and surprises. They would
have waited for the cavalry to come up
and then destroyed them. Whenever we
have an encounter there is never any
doubt of the' Spanish defeating the insur
gents four to one. The insurgents run
away. That is their strength.
â  "There was an illustration of this day
before yesterday in the encounter we had
with them near San Cristobal, where 400
of our men were attacked by 4000 or 5000
insurgents, and our men defeated them."
"What is your opinion after your inspec

ing provinces?"
"I am satisfied that the men are well
cared for."
' .'."ln your opinion ; how long is this revo
lution likely to last?" i XX- XX;. .â , â 7;
"I can hardly say; but I believe that the

MASSACRE OF TAMZARA.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey. Feb. 9.â
In spite of the satisfactory reports spread
abroad by the Turkish ; Government re
garding the attack on Zeitoun, it has not
been a success. The Zeitounlis, fighting
against superior numbers, were favored by
their impregnable' position and I by the
winter season. In one battle alone the
Turkish losses are given at 10,000, although
this number does not seem possible. The
Zeitounlis are said to have enough provis
ions to last until July.
â Whatever may. be the result of the me
diation no further attack can be made un
til after March. Regarding the numerical
strength of the Zeitounlis nothing' can be
said with certainty. : f\ '-.''â â¢'' -y
The unfortunate condition of Tamzara,
near Sharki Kara Hissar, province of
Sivas,- has been ' mentioned before. The
following letter, dated January 8, was
written by a native of the village:
'Upon.; the 7 Bth -of November a great
number of Turks came to the village and
called upon the people of the village to
come out.; The men and women were
made to stand on the ground arid then, in
the presence of the women, the men were
killed. "0 ut of '250 houses all but ten of
the males above 5 years of age were killed
on that awful day. ..Then the â¢houses were
stripped of all there : was in them. .The
women were stripped of their clothing
where it was worth carrying "off. The
prettiest women were carried * off by the
Turks. And now of the Tamzara are only
300 women and children left. X
"You cannot imagine I the j horrible con
dition of these people. I have seen again
and again young women who were deli
cately brought up [ dressed in J two , sacks,
one with holes" , cut in the | corners for the
legs and the other with holes for the head
and arms. They were i/ happy to .have so
much in the way of clothing. The Govern
ment has turned back these women every
time they have tried to escape to other
places, and there . is ,no hope for these
wretched women, left the .spoils of every
passing Turk, unless some power will be
interested in them to stop the continuous
outrages. -, t ." ; 7...;"
"That the Turks are waging a war of ex
termination against - Zeitoun '. is shown by
their 7 treatment' of the; villages around
Furnuz. ,',. Furnuz is \ situated ; about nine
miles â¢ east ,' of Zeitoun, and .with / the ap
proach of the Turkish army the Christians
had fled; into. Furnuz from the surround
ing country until { there were jat least 4000
people crowded into the town. They had
watchers out! on the , approaches to give
warning of the arrival of the Turkish
army, with . the intention ;of fleeing to
Zeitoun. In some way the Turkish army
eluaed these watchers and surrounded the
town by night, so that the unfortunate
Christians awoke to find a cordon around
them. 'â ;â â : .
"Three hundred women and children

'Oliver Belmont's Brothers Had but One
; Objection to His Marriage. '
NEW YORK, N. V., Feb. 9.-The Times
to-morrow will publish the following: A
close friend of -the Belmonts recently re
sented; the insinuation '; that Oliver H. P.
Belmont's - two brothers, Perry; and Au
gust, have not been loyal to him since his
marriage with the divorced 5 wife of Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt, arid is authority ; for
the true story of breaking off of relations.
It appears < that Perry and August very
naturally desired their -brother to ; induce
his wife to give up the alimony from her
former husband, which" is in the form of a
yearly allowance. The expression of this
wi3h on their part has given great offense
to; tbe 7 Oliver Belmonts. When society
[rioted the fact that the elder brothers were,

Lulu MayHoliingsworth Burns an
Important Letter in the Pres- '
' ence of Officers.
GREENCASTLE, Ind., Feb. 9.â There
was much excitement here to-day when it
became known that the headless trunk of
Pearl Bryan had been brought from Cin
cinnati at a late hour last ? night and de
posited in the vault at the cemetery near
the town. During the day large crowds
went to the cemetery and viewed the
casket 7 through the iron gratings of the
vault door. Among those were ; many who
knew the murdered girl from infancy and
strong men shed tears of sympathy when
the father, mother, brother and sisters ar
rived' at the cemetery and entered the
vault. -Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were almost
prostrated and the cries of the brother and
sisters could be heard on the outside of the
vault. Many present were those who had
been the younger associates -of Pearl
Bryan, and as the terrible . affair ( was dis
cussed the excitement : became , as intense
as on yesterday when .William Wood fled
from the j town sto avoid â¢ summary ven
geance at the hands of the exasperated
populace. .-//
While the parents were in- the vault,
there was a separation of the older from
the younger class of men, and there was a
whispered conversation, whose import was
kept from the others who had assembled
at the cemetery. It was learned later in
the day that twenty-seven of the, young
and middle-aged men of ' the city had
pledged themselves by a ,, solemn promise
to avenge Pearl Bryan's death by their
own hands if the law failed to mete out
death to the murderers. The organization
formed to-day is but the nucleus of one
that is to be organized for the purpose of
avenging the crime. .
jj CINCINNATI," Ohio; Feb. 9.â The only
new development : in the Fort Thomas
murder case to-day was the finding of a
hat and bloody handkerchief, which have
been identified as the property of the dead
girl. The detectives, however, are impene
trably silent as to where or how these ar
ticles were found. .. 7 '.'...
Unlike all their former clews they are
wonderfully, mysterious over the new find.
It is thought-' the articles ; have furnished
an important clew, which' the officers will
jealously guard until run down. f '"','â ;
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Feb. 9. â City
Marshal Starr of Greencastle early this
morning received "a letter signed "H.
R." stating that Lulu MayHollingsworth
of this city had, knowledge of the murder
of Pearl Bryan that would* be valuable to
the State, and to. see her at once. The
letter was so candid that it impressed the
official, and be came, at once to this city,
and with the aid of the police located the
Hollingsworth girl at 1 Henry street.
As Starr and the detective entered the
room the girl seemed to divine the cause
of their coming, and, walking to an open
grate, she threw a letter into the fire. 7lt
burned in an instant, and it is believed
that valuable evidence was thus destroyed.
The girl was then closely questioned,
and after much hesitation said I that she
was at the Union < Station on January 28
and there met Pearl Bryan, who had just
come in from Greencastle. The meeting
was accidental, she . said, but 2 she \ had
known Pearl at Coates College. Pearl told
her of her trouble and the two went to sev
eral drugstores, where they procured some
medicine.
She declared that the meeting with the
Bryan gin was accidental, but confessed
under pressure that there was an "affair"
between | her. and : Jackson and the mur
dered girl, The latter, she said, took the
medicine. ; She believed the girl took the
medicine, and : that Jackson went to his
room and found her dead and I then cut off
her head to conceal the crime.
, The police now believe that Wood' came
here and arranged for the Hollingsworth
girl to meet Pearl Bryan at the depot and
procure the ', medicine .for her. ; When
shown the initials to the letter, that Starr
had received she said the writer wa* ; Hal
E. Ratcliffe, a traveling salesman of Bos
ton. Ratcliffe left here this morning.
â  Lulu Hollingsworth is a .daughter; of J.
H. Hollingsworth,^ ex-Treasurer of Knox
County, and fled from Coates College some
; three years s ago, causing .much alarm
among her friends. She was afterward
found in . this city, where she had, taken
service as a domestic. 7
77 It is believed that the letter destroyed as
the. police entered the house was r from
Jackson. . v.'..>-. â '_".. 7 â -. 'Â-. â ;/: .- ",,-,; ; v ;.. -

THE WEEK IN CONGRESS.
Senators at Last Ready to Con*
sider Actual Business of
the Session.
Appropriation Bills, the Free Seed
Resolution and Monroeism Win
Be Discussed.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Feb. 9.âAl
though the present Congress has been in
session for more than two months, with
out the customary holiday recess, the Sen
ate will only this week get down to the
actual business of the session and begin
the consideration or the appropriation
bills. Hansbrough's seed resolution is the
unfinished business, and lie expects to
have a hearing upon it within a few days,
although the understanding is that it is to
be laid aside temporarily whenever ap
propriation bills are ready to be consid
ered.
Quay's amended resolution to recommit
the tariff bill to the Senate, which was laid
over until' to-morrow, will come up early.
'Quay says that while the vote will be close
he believes it has an even chance of. pass
ing. The Populists, however, at their re
cent conference decided .. to vote against
recommitment, and if they do so, together
with the entire Democratic vote, the reso
lution will not prevail.
Smith of New .Jersey, will address the !
Senate to-morrow on the Monroe resolu
tions now pending. It is believed that he
will take ground between - the ultra-con
servatism of his colleague, Sewell, and the
radicalism of Davis of Minnesota. The
fact that Smith has 5 conferred with the
President on the subject and his speech,
to a certain extent, is I believed to . . reflect
the views of tne. chief executive will give
it interest. Blanchard of Louisiana will
also speak on the same subject Tuesday. 'â â 
â '. The effort to change the elective officers
of the Senate may be made during the lat
ter part of the week, but there is more or
less of conjecture regarding this, as there
is abundant work before the Senate in the
shape of appropriation bills, those having
been | reported â¢ to - the Senate being the
urgent deficiency, military academy, pen
sions and the consular 'and diplomatic
bills. In none of these haye many addi
tions been made, save in' the urgent defi
ciency bill, to which, at the request of the

TEXAS RANGERS AT EL PASO.
Governor Thornton Will Ask for

EL PASO, Tex., Feb. The trains ar
riving in the city continue to bring in a
goodly number f of visitors, the larger
share of whom are coming to be here dur
ing the time set for the great fistic car
nival.
7 1 Among others arriving to-day was Ad
jutant-General Mabry. of this State, Cap
tains Brooks and Rogers and ten picked
Texas rangers. The Adjutant-General
states that he is here with these men for
the purpose of seeing that the fights are
not brought off in any disputed or undis
puted territory to which Texas lays claim.
He will have his headquarters at the Pier
son Hotel, where Governor Thornton of
New Mexico is stopping.
â¢' Governor Thornton and Adjutant-Gen
eral Mabry had a conference to-day, and
mapped ) out their line of procedure to
keep the fight from coming off in Texas or
New Mexico.
Governor Thornton will return to Santa
Fe to-morrow, and through the proper au
thority make a request that' the troops
garrisoned at Fort Bliss be used to patrol
the border of New Mexico near the point
where Texas, New Mexico and Old Mexico
meet. ''
The preparations made by the Texas and
New Mexico Governors since the , passage
of the Catton bill will certainly prevent the
carnival from taking place on United
States soil near this place, if the princi
pals would think of trying such a thing,
which is not at all likely. V; .;' M "
Notwithstanding the preparations that
are developing to keep the fight from be
ing pulled off on United States soil Dan
Stuart is offering 4 to 1 that the fights will
come off as scheduled. If he is making a
bluff he is certainly a nervy sport. It is
reported that Governor Ahuamada of Chi
huahua came up to Juarez last evening,
but is not "at home" to newspaper re
porters. It is also reported that he has
secured a leave of absence which covers
the time of the carnival, and that his
presence here has nothing to do with his
gubernatorial duties.
' Stuart | certainly manages to keep this
entire community guessing as to the point
at which he intends to have the great

DIES A PAUPER.
Sad Passing of the; Man
Once Called the "Prince
of Tombstone."
FRIENDLESS AND ALONE.
His Body Consigned to the Dis
secting Table of a School
of Anatomy.
HAD SQUANDERED MILLIONS.
He Made an Enormous, Fortune Dur
ing the Mining Boom, But
Lost It All.
. CHICAGO, 111., Feb. 9.â A1l that was I
mortal of Edwin Fields, the "Prince of
Tombstone," who once counted his money
by the millions, lies on a dissecting table
at the School of Anatomy, 385 Washing
ton boulevard. He died a pauper and his
body was turned over to the Demonstra
tors' Association.
The story of Fields' life is one of ro
mance and pathos. His career began
practically in the mining regions of Tomb
stone, Ariz. He was then about 60 years
of age. For thirty years previous to
his advent in Tombstone he had been in
California, drifting to different mining
camps, following every new excitement.
He was a shrewd man, of great personal
courage and a good judge of ore; so, when
he made his location in the new mining
district of Tombstone he was content to
wait.
Among others who squatted upon what
were considered worthless claims when
the. town was in its infancy and its value
unknown was Edwin Fields. He had
come to Tombstone like thousands of oth
ers without a dollar. When the boom be
gan the Gilded Age, the principal claim
owned by Fields, was on the main lead
and early became desirable property.
There were rival claimants, however, and
. considerable litigation. But Fields, backed
by New York capitalists, finally won and
Bold the Gilded Age for $600,000. He, how
ever, reserved the surface â about twenty
acres. On this was situated the business
part of Tombstone. He sold 25-foot lots
as high as $5000 and for years his rents
amounted to over $4000 a month.
Then commenced a career of extrava
gance seldom equaled except by "Coal
Oil Johnny" and a few other fortunate but
â  foolish men. When water in Tombstone
sold for five cents a gallon Fields toot
- three baths a day. .
He wore the whitest of flannel suits, and
changed throughout after each bath. His
-personal expenditures averaged no less
than $100 a day. " v y-7 y^^vp^v?. y '_?:;.
- After "milting Tombstone dry," Fields
Â-_ went to St. Louis to speculate in grain, but
7 he soon lost the larger portion 'of his for
. tune. Then he came to Chicago, and here
he was speedily reduced to poverty, and it
became with him a question ;of getting
enough to eat.
For a while he worked at various hotels
in the city as store-keeper, seldom receiv
ing more than $14 a month.
Worry and advancing years finally
caused him to succumb. For a few weeks he
lay sick at a cheap lodging-house on Thir
teenth street. He was forcibly carried
from there to the hospital, and after a few
days sent to the poorhouse at Dunning,
where he died.

FINE SPORT AT SANTA CRUZ
The Fishing Grounds Are Alive
With Salmon, Sardines
and Whales.
The Big Fellows Are Harmless, but
in the Way of the Boat
men.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Feb. 9.â The fish
ermen to-day landed 150 salmon and had
great sport with whales while engaged at
salmon-fishing. Ten of these big fellows
came into the fishing ground this morn
ing, and they were tame and peaceful in
their sport, and were only a . harmless
bother in their search for sardines.
The fishermen say there are "acres of
sardines" and they have no fear of the ;
salmon running out. as there are enough
sardines for them and the whales, unless
the whales get to keeping school ' in
these waters, : when the boatmen will
hot get 7 about with as much free
dom, - and the sardines may Jbe greatly
diminisned. But there is no fear of that.
One salmon caught to-day by Fisherman
Jackson weighed twenty-eight pounds, the
largest" taken this season. The weather
is beautiful and the prospects are good for
a fine week's fishing. 7

RIOT AT LOS ANGELES.
The Cowboy Preacher and His
Wife Defy the Police and
Cause Trouble.
Over Two Thousand People Make a
Demonstration That Shakes
Up the City.
LOS ANGELES,' Cal., Feb. . There
was an incipient riot to-night in front of
the police station, and for more than two,
hours the street was so blocked that it was
impossible to move along the , sidewalk,
and even the streetcars bad difficulty in
getting through the immense and closely
packed crowd..,. 7y
The cause of the trouble was the so
called "Cowboy Preacher," J. R. Rice, and
his wife, and quiet was not restored until
after they, with several of ' their followers,
were landed behind the bars. 7.'7 fl
â¢ The cowboy preacher has been holding'
nightly meetings here, the crowds he
and his wife nave been; drawing have,ob
structed the sidewalk of Spring street,- the
main thoroughfare of the city. -7 7 :
The police have warned them to desist,
but they have defied the officers.
The arrest of Mrs. Rice to-night was the
signal for a mob to â  form, not to do vio
lence, but to sympathize with Rice because
his wife was behind the bars.
The mob at the station refused tor move
and the police, made an endeavor to force
them to clear the street.
Rice offered bail : for his wife, but the
police refused to accept it until r the crowd
dispersed: 7 Rice,' surrounded by fully .2500
people, commenced to 'sing- "America,
sweet country dear, sweet land of liberty,
'tis of thee I sing." v _ - â ,
â  y About 1000 people took up. the refrain;
and it : could be heard for blocks. Then
the police arrested ? Rice' for "disturbing
the peace. * 7 :?y,
fi-'.ln the meantime the entire police force
of the city had been called out, and after
Rice's arrest the crowd was dispersed with
no great difficulty. l y â '-..:.. /..vs
About '.fifteen 'â â  obstreperous individuals
who resisted police "authority were jailed. ;â¢>

leased on bail. fc He was refused -bail- and

A PRETTY GIRL'S

Arrested in a Seattle Den
in the Act of Smoking
Opium.
IS OF A GOOD FAMILY.
She Makes a Piteous Plea for
the Concealment of Her
Shame.
BUT IS DRAGGED TO PRISON.
Tempted by Chinese Servants, She
Becomes a Hopeless Victim of
the Drug.
SEATTLE, Wash., Feb. 9.â A raid by
the police at an early hour this morning
on a Washington-street ooium-smoking
den revealed the downfall and degrada
tion of a beautiful girl who was found in
the act of smoking opium with a repulsive
looking Chinaman.
.Emma, Perkins is her name, her father
being a big contractor and . builder of Se
attle. A distressing scene followed the
arrest and the girl begged piteou3ly that
her shame be not made public, for her
mother's sake, if for no other. , But her
entreaties were coldly disregarded -by the
officers and she was dragged away to
prisou. 7 â¢"/.-.-..-'â¢â¢ 7 : /lX' f <X":X-
Miss Perkins is 18 years of age and per
sonally very, attractive. She. is well edu
cated, of good form and figure, has a luxu
riant growth of dark-brown hair and her
eyes are large and lustrous. ': â¢ -:7:,. y
According to a confession obtained by
the police she has been in the habit of vis
iting the dive for several months and ad
mits that she is almost hopelessly addicted
to tne habit of opium smoking. It appears
that she and a neighbor girl, whose
name she steadfastly refuses' to di
vulge, having beard Chinese servants talk
so much about the happiness and blissful
feeling found in the opium pipe, were
tempted to steal away from home to a
smoking â¢ place connected â  with a Chinese
wash house. Their visits became more
frequent, culminating in this morning's
exposure. .y â : ; V7" y
Miss Perkins was liberated to-day. She
claims her sister and companion in wrong-
doing is not now in the city. A woman
who lives in the neighborhood of the Chi
nese establishment observed the girls'
visit to the place, and, believing it to be
her duty to do so, informed the police.
HAS SCHLATTER A DOUBLE?
The Prisoner in the Sari Barnar
dino Jail Is Either Genuine ':
.or a Counterpart.
Declines to Be Interviewedâ Thought
.7 to Be a Fit Subject for the
Asylum.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Feb. 9.â
If the vagrant in the County Jail is not
Schlatter, .the divine healer, then
Schlatter has a double both in appearance
and experience, to a ; certain degree. The
prisoner was visited in the County Jail . by
a Call, correspondent and was found in
his cell "â . apart from his companions in
durance vile. He did not seem to notice
the presence of ; the reporter, but lay
stretched in \ his bunk oÂ» his back and
his arms folded across his breast. His
eyes were partially closed and his whole
demeanor was that ot a man wrapped in
profound thought and totally oblivious of
all surroundings. 7
Not until he was spoken to two or three
times did he show any signs, of conde
scending to notice his visitor. : As to the
question, "Are you Schlatter, the healer?"
he uttered not a word, only a stare, as
much as to say: "This is a matter I
intend to keep strictly to myself."
While he will in no way acknowledge
that he is Schlatter, still he has been in
the very places that the famous healer did
visit, and trailed about on a white mule
until it died of , thirst and fatigue on the
Yuma desert.
' He says that he does not mind working
on the rockpile as he had been sentenced
to do, as the | Savior - suffered j a thousand
fold more, and he simply considers|that he
is doing penance, as should all sinners in
this world of trial : and : tribulations. All
efforts to get an extended interview out of
him have proved unavailing, as' he would
sink into silence as if in prayer, totally ig
noring the reporter.
The opinion of the officers is that the
man is either 7 Schlatter, or else some re
ligious crank who has heard 'i a ; great deal
of the healer. His general actions would
imply that he belongs in the asylum, and
not on a rockpile, Schlatter or no Schlatter.

..A few moments afterwards she heard a
noise at the back door, and, taking a pis
tol with her. Â«he went to it. â  She found
the wire screen 7 had been cut and saw a
man * standing i outside " of it. ' She took a
shot at him and saw him partly raise a
pistol. She shot twice more and he ran
and jumped over the alley fence, crying
out: "Ben, ; I am. hurt." The officers
searched the alley, but were unable to find
any traces of the burglar.

DOCTORED CAKE AT CARSON.
After Supper a Leap Year Party Is Sud
; denly Broken Up.
â  CARSON; Nev., Feb. 9.â At the return
leap year party given in this city an out
rage was perpetrated on the guests that re
sulted in the serious sickness of, about a
dozen people. At midnight supper was
served and shortly after quite a number of
ladies and gentlemen were taken violently
ill. " -. ; . v.7..-.',.'.^- .=
The trouble was supposed to lie in an
innocent-looking chocolate cake, 7 which
was placed on the Jable by nobody knows
who, although several persons are sus
pected. It is supposed by some that the
cake was doctored for the Reno musicians,
there having been some feeling engendered
by the management of the bail sending to
Reno for the music.
Some of the cake has been saved and
sent to the Reno University to be analyzed.
The" report of the cuemist is anxibusly
awaited, and arrests are expected to fol

NEW DRYDOCK BADLY NEEDED
Junkmen Seeking Bargainsâ Good Pork
in Condemned Barrelsâ Relief
for Injured Workmen.
â¢ VALLEJO, Cal., Fob. 9.â Within the
next day or two the crew for the monitor
Monadnock' will have arrived from the
Norfolk Navy-yard, coming by ; way of the
Sunset route. As soon as the train, con
sisting of five sleepers, two baggage and
one commissary car, reaches Vallejo Junc
tion the steamer Amador will take the
men aboard and; they will be brought di
rectly to the navy-yard and landed. The
men will take up their quarters on board
the receiving-ship Independence,' to re
main until the 20th inst., the date desig
nated for putting the monitor. in commis
sion. The train will proceed to the Oak
land yards, where it will be overhauled,
and return to the junction on the 13th,
ready to return with the men from the
Baltimore -to the Norfolk or New York
Navy-yard where they go to' receive their
discharge. The men coming this way
were formerly a portion of the crew of the
battle-ship Texas recently put out of com
mission at the Norfolk yard. The draft
consists of some 166 officers and men.
It is evidently the aim of the officials at
Washington to abandon the time-honored
custom of sending the men by water and
consuming a month's time, and hereafter
bring them out or return them by rail. .
'-The Monadnock is nearly ready for
them. She has been greatly improved
since going in dock. Newly painted, yards
up and decks cleared of working tools, she
makes a much' better looking appearance
than two weeks ago. So far her officers
have not all been assigned to' her, but will
be within a short time, j She is now out of
dock, lying alongside the wharf, all
painted except the turrets.
â  The cruiser Baltimore is nearly ready to
go out of commission. A number of her
officers have been . distributed to - various
ships in the squadron and others will go
East on leave.
The experience of the Baltimore in the
gale on the Japan coast demonstrates
the fact and the necessity that all cruisers
of her : type should be fitted with large
freeing posts located in the sponsons and
other parts, so arranged that when large
volumes of water are taken aboard, as was
the case with the Baltimore, it will have
a mode o escape so the upper deck can be
cleared in time for another sea bath.' As
now arranged, - the 'only method of escape
is by small scuppers near the deck, which
are entirely inadequate ' for the purpose.
While lat 7 the j yard' the -cruiser, will be
given a thorough overhauling. '
Much satisfaction is expressed at the ac
tion of the ; department, or the chief of
bureau of construction, Commodore Hitch
born, in ordering th 6 boats, outfit, etc., for
the two gunboats to be built at San Fran
cisco to be constructed at Mare Island.
This means an expenditure of, nearly $50,
--000, and will tide over what was feared to
be many idle days and months for mechan
ics in branches of trade pertaining to this
class of work.
Hope is not entirely abandoned for -the
appropriation of money for the commence
ment of a new dry dock at Mare Island.
Without doubt the Secretary of the Navy
knows full well the necessity j for the sec
ond dock at this . yard, but on account of
the state of the,. finances of the Govern
ment he could not consistently advocate
this measure, but the Representatives
from the Pacific Coast, with Congressman
Hilborn on the House Naval Committee
and Senator Perkins on the "Senate Com
mittee, with their thorough knowledge of
the urgent necessity for the dock, will un
doubtedly do all in their power to so im
press the subject on their fellow-members
that the money will be secured and the
dock commenced before another year.
'..' The water front having been dredged to
the satisfaction of the yard authorities the
machine men have removed their debris
distributing pipes and." with -the machine,
have returned to the Bay City. . .
The yard has been fairly" overrun during
the past week with tradesmen of all kinds
to look and haul over the quantities of old
junk to be disposed of under sealed bids
during the * coming : week. The general
verdict among them is that it is the poor
est lot of condemned stuff they ever caw.
But then this is all for effect, and to deter
other prospective bidders from running
the price up.
A funny story is going around the street
corners relative to a lot of pork recently
inspected, that while the pork passed a
first-class inspection, the barrels y in which
it was packed were rejected. Â The question
is what will become 7of ; ; the i .wine 7. flesh
which awaits the putting in of brine if the
; barrels are to be returned to San Francisco?
However,' the storemen may have an 7 op-*
portunity to do" the 7 repacking, and it will
take 7 , some y time, there are many
thousand pounds of the pork. 7
i By the building of the engines for the
Hartford iat â¢ Mare Island i the ; mechanics
will again have an opportunity of 'demon
strating their fitness as marine j engine
builders. The engines of the Monadnock
during her dock trial ; have run perfectly;
it only; requires time to 7 prove what the
monitor will ao at sea. '
As . predicted not ; long . since the ; Co
manche > will 'soon go to San Francisco, if
the dispatches in the paper of ; this morn
ing from Washington I; are J correct. 7 She
â  will be a novel sight to the rising genera
tion of San = Franciscans who have never
seen a single turreted monitor. '
The oiler from the Baltimore who was
run over by one of the small ;fla tears; used r
in transporting materials X. one day last
week is in the hospital slowly improving.
Andrew Ban, who had 7 his ; leg: crushed
off by one of the Mouadnock's guns, is as
well as to be expected. iHe is still in the
hospital." . The officers and f employes at 1
,the .yard succeeded in -raising: is; nearly
$1400 for the [benefit; of his family;*; On
Tuesday evening the Vallejo : Dramatic
Association will give an entertainment for
his benefit. Thus it will be seen if one is
injured at the yard the employes endeavor
to assist his family.
There is open daily in Vallejo from
7 a.m. to 10 p. m. a fine : reading-room with
gymnasium and special facilities for recre
ation, known as the Headquarters of the
Naval Union, designed especially for men
of the United States navy, though civilian
visitors are always welcome. The union
has done avast, deal of good toward fur
nishing social : enjoyments for the blue
jackets when visiting this "side of the river.
.Work of all kinds remains in about the
same condition as a month ago. Work
men on "the Monadnock will, next turn
their labors to the Baltimore and perhaps
the Ranger, though no definite orders
have oeen received for either of them. To
get the Monadnock ready by the 20th a
number of men have been working at night
on her. 7 ' ,

AT THE PARK AND BEACH.
The One Thousandth Concert Given by
the Park Band..
It seemed as if all the residents of the
City were out yesterday enjoying the beau
tiful .weather, and those who were not in
Golden Gate Pari, or at the Haight-street
grounds were at the ocean beach, the Cliff
and Sutro Heights. * "^Y>tv'
The several car lines running westward
were crowded all day. The Sutro line
worked well and was well patronized. The
two steam lines that terminate near the
Cliff carried out as many as each car and
platform could hold on each trip. The
crowd at the ocean beach was very large,
but not so large as it was the previous. Sun
day. X^Xf . 'â 'â ':'â  >-?.'_
The feature in Golden Gate Park was the
one thousandth concert given by the park
band. A very attractive programme was
presented and the several numbers were
appreciated and loudly applauded by the
great assemblage of people who were lis
teners. "Call Me Thine Own." solo for
French horn, by E. Schlott, with flute ob
ligato by A. Lombardo, was the gem of the
programme/and the artistic rendition won
for the performers much applause and a
loud demonstration for an encore. -^
The first concert was given under
the direction of \I. C; Coggin in August,
1884. at a time when it was doubtful if the
people would appreciate the novelty. The
first one was favorably, received and the
crowds that listened to those that followed
gave proof that San Franciscans are lovers
of popular music. y
A balloon ascension; from the Haight

feet, hanging by his teeth .to a leather
strap fastened to the trapeze bar when he
left the ground. He landed safely at the
base of Mount Olympus. y
The' managers of . the 'Haight-street
grounds 'will shortly give The Call's
newsboys, a day. They will be granted
free admission, free rides in the chutes,
free slides on the trolley and free rides on

The Mountain in a State of

Thunderous Roaring, Followed by
Earthquake Shocks and Smoke
From the Peak.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal.; Feb. 9.â lt
reported to-day that people' in and about
Mount Tauquitz are getting ready to leave
the vicinity, as the action of the mountain,
to say the least, is very threatening, and
there is no telling at what moment some
thing serious will happen. A couple of
Indians, who have lived in the neighbor
hood of the mountain for some years, was
seen near Redlands to-day by a Call cor*
respondent, and to say they are frightened
would be putting it mildly. They say that
for about a month the mountain has been
in a state of internal disturbance. -
The first 'â  that was - noticeable in its
strange demeanor was a whistling sound
not shrill, â  but hoarse and : gutteral-like.
This was followed by a deep roar like
distant thunder, followed by peal on peal.
; This â¢ continued for several days, when
one morning the Indians in camp were
startled by a \ shock like that of a heavy
earthquake and immediately smoke was
seen issuing from the mountain's peak, at
first in thin white layers, followed im
mediately by puffs like â  from .the smoke
stack .of an â  engine. This has kept up
almost incessantly up to date and the
Indians, along with . many white settlers,
are fearful of the results. 'â ..!;*; 7. â¢'
It has been handed down in Indian his
tory in that neighborhood that: Mount
Tauquitz . once belched forth volumes of
fire, and it is because of this knowledge
that they base their â  present fears. It is
expected that an abundance of lava forma
tion lies for a short distance on tbe peak.

ELECTRICITY TO

Nature's Forces Harnessed
for the Benefit 'â  of H

POWER FOR FACTORIES.
New Era Dawns for the People
of the Central San Joaquin
Valley.
UTILIZING MOUNTAIN CREEKS.
Tiny Wires With Strength to Light
the City and Turn the Wheels
of Its Industries.
FRESNO, Cal., Feb. 8.-Thanks to a
beneficent Providence, which has done so
much for the Pacific Slope, and especially
for California, the problem of successful
manufacturing on varied lines in this
great State has been solved. It now re
mains for her citizens to utilize the power
which nature has put in their way. And
to what sublime heights of glory and pros
perity may she not aspire when . the full
fruition of this power has been realized ?
The power alluded to is, of course, that
contained in the innumerable cascades and
waterfalls which, "like the fingers of God,
pointing out the way," may be found
within easy reach of almost every hamlet
and city in the State. The utilization of
the "countless wealth which is being con
stantly squandered in almost all the tor
rents and watercourses â¢of the world"
will soon be accomplished in this metropo
lis of the central San Joaquin Valley.
Within the next sixty days Fresno will
celebrate the completion of the third
largest long-distance electric power and
lighting plant in the United States.
The primal source of power of this stu
pendous enterprise will be the North Fork
of the San Joaquin River, at a point about
forty miles from this city. The low- water
supply of this perennial stream will be
temporarily diverted by means of a ditch
six miles long, which will empty into a
natural reservoir 4150 feet above the power
house. The water from the reservoir will
be carried to the power-house in a steel
pipe under pressure. - : 7
From here electrical power will be trans
mitted on insulated copper wires to this
city, a distance of thirty-three miles, to be
supplied for all purposes for which it is
commercially used.
POINT OF DIVERSION FOR POWER PURPOSES -A MOUNTAIN CASCADE THAT WILL
ASSIST IN LIGHTING FRESNO.
[Sketched by a "Call " artist.]
The flow of water in the North Fork was
measured in September, 1893, after one of
the longest periods without rain on rec
ord, and was found to be about fifty" cubic
feet per second. This amount of water,
with a head of 1410 feet, which.the pipe
line has, will develop and regularly main
tain 7000 horse-power at the generators.
The losses incident to long distance trans
mission will probably reduce this to about
5000 horse-power on the wires at Fresno. :
A multitude of uses will be made of this
power when it reaches the city, the chief
among them being to propel the street
cars ard the city water-works machinery.
The water-wheels for the use of the com
pany were made by a San Francisco firm.
It is proposed to install three wheels of
500 horse-power each. By this i arrange
ment one wheel may be overhauled with
out drawing too much power from use,
since the two remaining wheels will not
be interfered with, and, therefore, most of
the power can be supplied continuously.
The sub-station in this city has just been
completed. â¢ â  *
There are a large number of mines
within a radius of a few miles of the
power-house, the most important one be
ing near the pole line. Most of these
mines have been lying idle for years, but
as soon as the plant is completed work
will be resumed on some if not all of them.
The practical use of water, in conjunc
tion with electricity, as a source of power
is of very recent origin. It is now, how
ever, an acknowledged success in all quar
ters of the globe.
This subtle and inexhauseible power is
conceded to be the most potent of -all the
elemental forces destined in the near
future, no doubt, to do a large part of the
world's. work. Hundreds of gushing cas
cades which distinguish California from
nearly -'all the other States of the Union,
but the waters of which having run to
waste for thousands of years, may now be
transformed into electrical .energy and
carried long distances at very small cost
as compared with. steam, and this, : ; too,
without contaminating the waters of these
streams or diminishing their supply to the
valleys below. ' ;
'-"'No limit has been placed on the distance
to which electric power may be success
fully and economically carried.
The loss of energy, however, seems to be
in proportion to the distance traversed
from the generating dynamos to the place
of distribution. The loss ; in the case of
the San Joaquin company is estimated to
be about 12 per cent. .Taking this as a
basis of estimates, it can readily be seen
that a pole line 100 miles long would lose
36 per cent of its 7 original energy an
amount as great probably as could be sac
rificed and leave a margin of profit to the
owners and operators of the plant. This,'
however, would; depend on several other
circumstances of considerable importance,
such as the amount of money originally
invested, the expense of operating and the'
value to the consumer. *In the case of the
Lauffen-Frunkfort plant the transmission
covers a distance of 110 miles on bare cop
per wires at a loss of only 28 per cent.
Some of the most noted electricians of the
world have examined this plant, and pro
nounce it a complete success. , -;>7 : 7 -
Until very recently the use of electrical
transmission of power was j confined jto

mining operations in this and other Paci
fic Coast States. It is worthy of remark
that the first use of electrical power trans
mission in the United States was made in
California by the . American River Syndi
cate' fa El Dorado County. The power
station of this company is two miles dis
tant from its mine and mill. The electric
current is carried to the mill on a single
insulated copper wire and the return by a
wire of the same size/making a circuit of
four miles. About a year ago an extension
of this line was made to the St. Lawrence
mine, a distance of five miles from the
power-house. ' j
The enterprise has been a success from

the start (made five years ago) and is still
in operation. J Since the American River
Syndicate 'â¢ demonstrated the practical
utility and economy of such transmission,
electric light and power companies have
been organized in many parts of Califor
nia, Colorado and Oregon. ? -;*'
3 Among the California plants are the
Sail Antonio Electric Light and . Power
Company, located - in San Antonio Can
yon, San Bernardino County, supplying
light and power, to the , towns . of . Pomona
and San Bernardino, the first named being :
fifteen miles from :! the, power-house and
the second twenty-eight miles. 1 The Stand
ard Consolidated Milling Company at Bo
oie, Cal., has another plant in successful
operation. The. power from its station is
carried thirteen miles to the Standard mill,
its owners report a saving of $25,000 a year
by its"; operation, and that the outlay in
putting up the plant was returned in
eighteen months. Every one will remem
ber; the auspicious inauguration of the
"plant at Folsom with its transmission of
light, heat ; and y power to Sacramento. It
has been pronounced a perfect success in
every particular.

from an engineering and financial stand
point. _As to projected plants, they are
numerous.
Besides the plant now nearing comple
tion by the San Joaquin Company here, a

...... â ~ â 
THEY WOULD NOT PLAY BALL.
Now Berkeley Co-Eds Soon to Uphold
- the Honor of the University at
Basket-Ball./
Scornful sniffs and ; disdainful tosses of
pretty heads accompany any remarks the
girls of Miss West's school make about the
Stanford University girls now. l There is a
well defined feeling that the Stanford girls
"crawfished" out of a | match game of
basket-ball j with Miss West's j girls after
i having sent a challenge, and.: the athletic
young ladies of -the Van Ness' avenue in
stitution feel distinctly aggrieved. -
"It was just awfully mean, there," said
one of; Miss West's pretty girls, who is
willing to run, work and -get [ bumped for
the glory and honor .of . her . school". - "We
practiced two hours ; every afternoon \ for
weeks to be in 7 training for the match
game. We gave up caramels and lots of
goodies and went to bed early. And then
those horrid creatures backed out. <
"You wouldn't wonder that we feel vexed
if you know ; all the' troubles- we've â¢ en
dured. -You see, : Miss Wesft's girls , are
the champions of" tne coast. We . haven't
been beaten yet and we didn't want the
Stanford girls to defeat usâ they're con
ceited enough now. ;So 'we trained as
hard as we could and we got so many
black, and blue spots, on our arms and
shoulders that when ; some of oar girls
went to a party last week and wore gowns
with low necks and short sleeves they
looked almost : like the spotted boy in the
circus. I only speak about our arms and
shoulders, for that's all that showed. -
"But those were only personal annoy
ances. When we accepted \ the challenge
of the Stanford .girls,' our captain fixed
the date at Saturday, February '1, and
invitations were printed and sent out to
our friends. Then the Stanford team be
gan objecting, and at last they refused to
play, but not till the last moment.' â  :
"Now do you blame us for feeling
vexed?" . . ...r^-^ Â«*
Even Bt. Anthony would have been
forced to admit that anything this in
tensely enthusiastic young lady insisted
upon would be right. Then she explained:
"The Stanford girls ' challenged us to
play. We accepted, and, being the chal
lenged party, we had a right to choose the
grounds. We fixed on the armory on Pa
cific street, near Van Ness avenue. No
objection was raised, and we made/all the
necessary preparations. 7 Besides this, we
began ;to train very severely. Then we
received a letter from Stanford. And what
do you think? Those girls wanted us to
go down there and play, on, their grounds.
'Miss West would never allow her girls
to play Jin a public place. We knew it
even before she said so. Then â  the Stan
ford girls insisted that we should choose
some open ground as they were not used
to playing on a hard floor. 3 But our girls
did not want to play before every body and
so we tried to get them to consent to the
original proposition, y, v.. r - r^
"A wooden floor is just as easy to play
on as dirt >if it isn't slippery, : arid it is a
good deal cleaner. We all thought it was
horrid of them to make so much trouble
when we would be at as much disadvan
| tage as they, if ; there is any disadvantage
[in a board floor. But they wouldn't see it
that way, and when our captain tele
graphed them on Thursday that our team
would be at the armory on , Saturday after-"
noon ; ready to play . the answer came back
that we needn't' bother about it because
the Stanford girls weren't coming to play
in any armory." 7 1 t.
;\ Miss West was not at home ve3terday.
The housekeeper was, though. "This lady
is enthusiastic over : "our girls," as she
called them, and their ability at basket
ball.
"I think the Stanford girls were afraid
to play," she said confidentially. : "And if
they had played our girls . would Shave
beaten them, | sure. .Why, last week they
played twice with the girls of Miss Lake's
school and beat i them, both timfs. One
day the score was 6to 0 and the next day
5 to 0. Of course^ ;, our girls claim the
game the Stanford girls backed down
from, too." 7 77
Another interesting game is being
planned.;. The fair co-eds at Berkeley are
also basket-ball enthusiasts. Negotiations
are now pending to fix a date when they
shall meet Miss West's victorious young
ladies. The 7 girls will not bet on the
event, but many boxes of candy and pairs
of gloves will be wagered on the success of
favorites.. . ... a_ ; . . ...
In the meanwhile, at Miss West's, they
speak of Stanford as â  "the kindergarten.'''
Any remonstrance is received with a tip
tilted nose and a humming of ''You can't
come and play in my yard; I don't like
you anymore."
WOMEN IN REFORM WORK
Dr. Martyn on the Social Evil
and the y Sanctity of
... the Home. ;/ . .\ h
The Chicago Divine Points Out Some
of the Methods by Which
to Operate.
y Dr. Carlos Martyn, the eminent Chicago
divine, delivered another of his interest
ing addresses at the Central Methodist
Episcopal Church yesterday afternoon.
There was quite a large congregation pres
ent and to the ladies of it who are identi
fied with the "Woman's Federation move
ment for municipal reform Dr. Martyn's
remarks were particularly addressed. The
doctor believes that women should play a
more important part in the administration
of the City's affairs and that their par
ticipation in ; matters affecting the civil
government might greatly conduce to the
improvement of the moral : tone.
\ Dr. Martyn explained that women all
over the : country are : interesting them
selves in this sort of ' work and are doing
an immense amount of good. "These or
ganized bodies of determined and consci
entious women," he said, "are the natural
outcome ,of evil conditions which have
sprung up everywhere in f municipal gov
ernment. They are a protest against bad
government j and a propoganda for "good
government. Have . you â  ever stopped to
consider how our ; fathers transformed
thirteen separate and warring colonies
into the same number ,of stalwart and
United States, which were so firmly con
solidated that they were each for ail and
all for each whenever a question of com
mon interest was involved?
"This is precisely the idea which we are
trying to understand and utilize. We are
willing to stand together, for the well-being
of each and every one of us is involved in
the proper administration of the affairs of
our City government. And these matters
are of such a character that it matters not
to .what party a man belongs or with what
religion a \ woman 7is identified; all can
work as one in the eradication of evil and
the purification of the municipal institu
tion. When it comes to a matter of the
common âood we can all operate together.
This is why women may interest .them
selves in such affairs, and the Woman's
Federation is intended to do this very
thing.' " : 'â¢' ."-'â :;; â â â¢ -"
"Now about the evils. There are . three
chief ones, and they are everywhere and
tremendously powerful. There is the
gambling evil, the liquor \ traffic evil, and
last," but not least, boodlers and boodling.
It used to be 'great is Mohammed and Allah
is his prophet,' but we hear it now, 'great
is the boodler and 'boodle is his profit.'
These three evils are not to be found alone.
They are united .in. a confederation in in
iquity," and if you strike at one you find
the others leaping to its assistance. There
is a vital bond between them. 'You can
not assail one but , the others are on your
bands in an : instant. They do not play
politics, either. 7 When. they want a thing
they get it. and if we \ hope to battle with
them successfully we must $ be prepared to
answer 'yes' in support of â¢ law and order
as emphatically and . arrogantly as they
bowl 'no.' Suppose '. you went home r to
day and found your house in possession of
a' burglar. -- Would _ you daintily extend
your hand with outspread fingers and ask
him to | leave ?I Or would you not strike
with ; your ; fist? ââ¢ Our fighting has been
done too daiutily.. We have struck with
fingers spread, a Methodist finger, a Pres
byterian finger, a Unitarian finger, a Con
gregational and an Episcopal thumb, and
our striking has amounted to nothing.
Now we must clench these party fingers
and hit from the shoulder until something
drops. - â ;â >,;â¢.. -â ;â .â ,. :
: "The women represent the conscience
side of society. .This conscience side is a
great thing and may be used to advantage
in political work. >We have all a common

We are interested in the enforcement of
laws and the i preservation of order, and'
there can be no sexual distinctions when
we consider the objects for, which the City
exists. The women . must y teach . non

nation in the world's history ever fell
until its home life was contaminated. Let
us watch the courts when our moral life is
endangered and see that justice does not
miscarry. Particularly, should the women
do something about that infamous ' law in
this State which permits a girl to , consent
to the ruin of her body and soul when she
is 14 years old. She cannot inherit â¢: prop

The subject of forest culture on the Pre

that Colonel Lee would accept promotion
in that direction with ereat pleasure. ;
.Another ten-inch , a breech-loading rifle
for the 'disappearing battery on the hill
near Fort Point has been received from the
East. Workmen were engaged yesterday
in moving the heavy gun across the City
to its destination. Colonel Mendell of the
U. S. engineers gave close attention to
this important battery. The fortifications
will be completed under the direction oi
Colonel Suter, who succeeded Colonel
Mendell upon the latter's retirement.
; The big gun was taKen out yesterday to
the Presidio. The trip was made undei
many difficulties and with a small army ol
attendants. John Morton attended to thÂ«
transportation, and it taxed all his re
sources.
- The gun, which weighs forty-five tons,
was shifted - : upon a â¢ platfcrm made ol
12-incb timbers placed on four truck? used
in house-moving. It was securely lashed.
Then thirty-two horses were hitched on
four abreast, ; and the enormous piece ol
ordnance started on its destination.
i This was about 7 o'clock. The gun was
carried up' O'Farrell street. Just as it
passed Jones, the great weight snapped
one of the heavy timbers. This necessi
tated an hour's delay for repairs. From
O'Farrell the route was along Polk street.
A long pause ensued when. Jackson street
was reached.^. This was to prepare for the
descent encountered at that juncture. Two
heavy trucks with -wheels lashed with
chains were hitched on behind the cannon
as a drag. Behind these were hitched two
teams of heavy draft horses. . These horses
and those hitched to the trucks were
almost kept on their haunches .by theii
drivers, who in this way were able to
regulate the speed with which tb.ei.lg gun
ran down hill. To further retard fits speed,
men ran beside the gun and threw great
blocks of wood under the wheels of its
carriage. Â . r
From one end of the route to the other
the moving of the gun was a source of great
interest. Crowds followed it gaplngly, and
at each stopping place a throng gathered
around staring at it with wondering eyes,
and indulged in very funny comments' aa
. -
to the uses to which it was to be put and
the manner of working it.
Work preliminary to the actual con
struction of two new gunboats for the
United States navy is in progress at the
Union Iron Works. . Senior Lieutenant
Capps, U. S. N_, arrived from Washington
last week and is on duty at the iron works.
% Armor-plates for the after turret of the
battle-ship Oregon have been received.
Plates for the top of the turrets are due
and daily expected. It is belie that the
Oregon will be ready for her trial trip by the
middle of May. Little remains to be done
at. the Union works beyond placing two
13- inch guns in position. The ship has
had one trial to test the workings of ma
chinery, but this was the contractors' trial,
in which the Government was only inter
ested as a spectator and future owner. The
complete and thorough trial, for speed and
general handling will. probably be over the-
Santa Barbara Channel course next June.
.The Oregon is surely one of the greatest â 
battleships of the world, and officers who
have had an opportunity to inspect the
vessel from time to time are confident that
the ship will meet all the requirements of
the official trial board.
Reports come from the Orient that the
United States cruiser Olympia is receiving
many compliments for speed and style.
The coast defender Monterey joined Ad
miral Beardslee's flagship, the cruiser
Philadelphia; at San Diego last week.
Naval parades, balls, receptions and soci
ety functions generally have, made the
sojourn at San Diego exceptionally de.
lightful. .

The Nationals' Great Rifle Match
With the Soldiers of

A TOTAL OF 1939 WAS MADE.
Interesting Shooting by the Columbia
Clubâ German Sharpshoot

The inter-republic military rifle match
between the Nationals (Companies C and
43) of this City and the National Guards of
Honolulu took place yesterday. The local

marksmen shot at the Shell Mound rifle
range and the Hawaiian soldiers at the
capital of the island republic on Satur
day, as shown by the special correspond
ent of The Call at Honolulu.
The atmospheric conditions yesterday
were not the best, light and wind varying
all day. As it was, the fifty men of the
Nationals made a total of 1939, or an
average of 38 4-5 points each. This was
the first rifle match of its kind ever held.
Yesterday's contest was brought about
several months ago during a visit of
Lieutenant - Colonel Fisher to the Na
tionals Armory at 815 â  Ellis street. He
was looking at the framed photographs" of
some of the crack shots of Companies C
' and G, when Captain Sutliffe remarked
that an inter-republic team match would
be interesting, as it would make the sol
diers of the two nations better acquainted
and promote a friendship and good feeling
that would lead to pleasant acquaintances
should members of either body visit the
home of the other.
Colonel Fisher remarked that he knew
that there were good shots in the Nation
als, and added: "We have a number of
soldiers down at the islands who are pretty
bandy with the musket. If you do not
think so, send down a challenge to them."
The suggestion was at once acted upon,
i and when Colonel Fisher went back to
' Honolulu be carried a challenge for a 50
--man match, to which Captain Sutliffe re
ceived the following reply :
Honolulu, Jan. 6, 1896.
; , Captain E. C. Sutliffe. Company G, First Regi
ment, JT. G. Câ Sib: Through the kindness of
Lieutenant-Colonel Fisher, I am in receipt of
i the very friendly and agreeable challenge of
j Companies C and G, First Regiment, N. G. C,
â¢ to snoot a match with the First Regiment,
' K. G. H., of fifty men, ten shots, 200 yards, off
hand, Creedmoor rules, for a suitable, trophy,
to be hereafter decided upon; tho match to be
, /shot between the dates of February 8 and
; February 11,-1896, the results to be exchanged

i Contestants shall be allowed to use any mili
tary rifle permitted by the regulations of their
1 respective Governments, and each team to
. have the right to appoint a suitable repre
' tentative at its opponent's range.
In behalf of the First Regiment, N. G. H., I
r hereby accept the challenge with the con
â  ditions imposed, and would beg leave to name
â¢ Consul- General Charles T. Wilder as our repre-
I tentative, who will be duly notified.
j Hoping the match will strengthen our pres

friendly contests, I remain very truly yours,

. . Colonel, First Regiment, N. G. H.
Colonel McLean is an old United States
army officer, who was retired several years
j ago. He went to Honolulu shortly before
I the overthrow of the kingdom, and he was
' placed in command of the National Guard
of Honolulu as soon as the little republic
was fairly established. He has been very
.' active in training the soldiers of the repub-
I lie in military tactics and in marksman
; ship. He has now about 500 soldiers under

; will no doubt pick fifty I who will run up
excellent scores. "' â¢ .
The Nationals, on : the other hand, had
only the members of their two companies
to pick from, and ' the majority selected
were young men who had never been in a
match before. Two or three years ago the
Nationals had the best military rifle team
in the State, but since then many of the
best shots have gone on the veteran list or
retired from the National Guard.
The shooting began early in the day, and
it was late in the afternoon before the last
shot in the match was fired. The scores
were as follows: 7

THE HONOLULU TEAM.
Island Marksmen Have Records
That Compare Favorably With
Any In This State.
fPneclal Correspondence of Tee Call, j -
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Feb. 2, 1895.â
Much interest is being manifested over the
coming international shoot with the Cali
fornia National Guard. In an interview
with Colonel Fisher, who has the matter
in charge, your correspondent was in-
Captain E. O. White of Company B, the ! Colonel J. H. Soper of President Dole's
Crack Volunteer Company of Hawaii, j Staffâ Another 43 Alan.
A Safe 43 Man. I
[From photographs sent by George Hanson.]
formed that he would not select his team
of fifty men until the day before the
match, which will be shot here on Satur
day, the Bth. From Colonel j Fisher and
others . your correspondent can give the
names and records of many, of those who
are sure to ;be - selected. j First and fore
most may be mentioned Colonel Fisher
himself. He is reckoned as safe for 45.
His highest score in a match was 49. The
Colonel has plenty of nerve, and has been
known to miss the first shot in a match
and then come out with a 43.
Colonel Soper, who is also on the Presi
dent's staff as adjutant-general, is a good
shot and may be put down as a 43-man.
Major J. W. Jones and Captain ' Camara
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 1896.
are two other staff officers ; who will be se
lected. The former is a gooa 40-man and
the latter will go two or three points bet
ter.. .;.:â ..':, ;,_/\ , ;-'X .:,;'/}â  ;/ ~7.";' '7;.. . .....,...y*v':
Of the regular forces there are two com
panies, E ; and F,' each of . which will con
tribute ten men; Captain John Good of E
Company is a sure 45-man. . He holds the
highest record < here, which is' 47. He is
always in practice. It was Captain Good
who fired' the first and only shot in the
rebellion; of 1893, * when Liliuokalani was
dethroned.
He shot a .policeman who attempted to
stop a wagon filled s with ammunition and
sent his man to the (hospital for a couple
of months. Captain 7 Good's company has
run down of late by ! the expiration of en
listments so that he has only fifty men
left. Out of these he has sent in the
names of eleven, who are all safe 40-point
men, to Colonel Fisher to select from.
Among them are Lieutenant Coyne; Ser
geants, L. Moore and- H. A. Taylor;
Corporal C. B. Loh man and Privates A.
Buchanan, W. . Hannis, W. J. Smith and
J. Gouvier, .who may reckon on being
selected. .
â  Out of Company F Captain Zeigler will
send a list of. fifteen or more, all of whom
are safe for 40.. Prominent among these
I will be Corporal Sam Johnson.
He is a sure 45-point man, and will he
more apt to go over that figure than under
if he keeps up his record of the past few
days. The other members" of Company F
are all about on a par, and it would be
unfair to make comparisons.
Of the volunteers the crack shooting
team is the first ten of Company B, which
is known here as the cold water brigade, as
the boys in that company never drink any
thing stronger than soda water. Captain
Oscar White of this company has kindly
furnished the a^eraee record of this team
for the past three months' shooting, which
is as follows: y--y
Captain E.O. White 42.5. Private Elwin
44.5, Corporal Schmidt 41, Private Oieson
40.5, Sergeant Giles 41, Corporal Park 40.5,
Private J. C. Johnson 41, Corporal Storey
40, Privavte Tracy 40, Private Rowell 40,
Private Ewin 45.
Company D has a few good shots, as has
Companies A and C, and three or four
men from each of these will likely be
selected. Captain Paul Smith of A will be
in the match. . "
Company G has a safe4sman in William
Boyd, who made two 48's the other day. :
Another sure member of the team r will
be Corporal E. H. F. Wolters, who learned
how to shoot in the service of the old Em
peror William, and was foimerly con
nected with the old Honolulu .Rifles. He
usually makes 43 and seldom less than 40.
Drum Major W. C. 7 King made a 47
the other day to ; show what his score
ought to be next Saturday.,'
The above marksmen all told would
number about. forty, and if the Hawaiian
National Guard could get ten more men
who would average ias well 7 the island
team will give the California boys a hard
rub. The weakness of the Hawaiians will
rest in the men selected to fill up the team
from those whose averages do not reach
forty. Another source of weakness lies in
the volunteers, . especially those who have
not taken part in matches before and who
are apt to 3 fall down on j their practice
scores. Both Colonel Fisher and Captain
Good will feel elated if the team average
does not fall below the forty mark. -. Â°
The men who are to take part in the in
ternational mateh > do not :': by â  any means
represent the full shooting â¢ strength Â«of
Hawaii, for by the terms of the match both
the Shapshooters and the Citizens' Guard
are barred. The best ten men of the Sharp
shooters will pile up an 7 average of forty
five, shooting for money, marbles or glory,
while out of the seventy-five 'men in" the
company a team of twenty can be 'put be
fore the butts which will average forty-two.
Captain Walter Wall- and Lieutenant
James McLean .of : this, company are the
best two all-around > shots -in ; the islands,
but as the company is not strictly a mili
tary one i they* cannot take 7 part in the
coming match. In 750 men, who now com
prise the Citizens' Guard, there are neces
sarily a large number of good shots.
There are a number of ; others belonging
to no organization whatever who are â¢ good
shots. President Dole, for instance, is a
great lover of shooting, and often tries his
skill at the butts. _y He was formerly presi
dent of the 7 Hawaiian 7 Rifle 7 Association,
and is a good 43 man. As commander-in
chief of the Hawaiian army, he may have
the right take part in Friday's contest,
but it is not likely that he will do so, as he
is out of j practice. -7 T 7? 7.
Whatever y may be the outcome of the
military match, and it is generally con
ceded that California willy, winy it, the
marksmen of our State may expect to re
ceive a challenge from Hawaii for a na
tional match.
. Little Hawaii will pick out fifty men and
match them against any fifty in the State
of California, both for long and short dis
tances, as may be arranged; later.;, Such a
match would be very popular here, as both
the Sharpshooters and Citizens' Guard are
somewhat chagrined over being left out of
the present one. The other island, could
furnish a few good shots, notably at ;Hilo,
where there is a good company of the Citi
zens' Guard which ha 3 7 just tied Company
B's team in a-, match. From the abund
ance of material ; to draw on. :as shown
from the foregoing, Hawaii's team would
be a formidable one, and the people here
all hope The Call will encourage the idea
and help get up the]match. r.\

Other Rifle Clubs.
The attendance at the Columbia Pistol
and . Rifle Club regular shoot at Shell
Mound yesterday .7 was unusually, large,
and a number of 7 excellent : scores were
made on the new Columbia target. The
competition for centers, which brings Old
Glory up in front of ; the target, was keen
on the pistol and- rifle ranges. X. A goodly
number of flags were obtained ]by the
marksmen on each range, t Taken as a
weole the shooting was not the best that
has been accomplished by the members of
this club. - . y
The midsummer distribution of merchan
dise prizes promises to be a feature, as it
will influence many to keep j up in their
practice with -the rifle and pistol. These
prizes are for members only, and do not
in any way interfere with the club medals
or the all-comers medals, which will be dis
tributed at the end of the" year, or the
cash : prizes for members and all-comers,
which will be distributed monthly.
A. Strecker made several remarkable
three-shot scores, two of the best being 9
and 10.' A. Gehret shot long and hard,
and in the last score of the day made 12,
which bunching the bullets pretty close
together. .The record of Jacobson, second
class, pistol, may be the means of pushing
him forward into the first class, as his
score of 66 was only excelled by two of the

Shooting at Schuetzen.
An enthusiastic crowd of marksmen
were at 'the California Schuetzen Club's
park, near San Rafael, yesterday. Al
though there were no notable matches nor
club contests for monthly medals, the
shooting was quite lively during the day.
Representatives from . a number of the
City clubs were in the stalls practicing for
the contests to be held next Sunday. Philo
Jacoby and several of the prominent mem
bers of the California Schuetzen Club
spent a few hours in practice in off-hand
and rest shooting. The Grutli Verein had
some of its marksmen on the range also,
and many of the scores credited to these
organizations were of high merit. The
Elntracht Verein members fired during
the afternoon and registered some good
scores. â  -

â '..".' League of American
yXf... Wheelmen.
â ":.'â . .- ; â â -. . - â¢ . :â  - ;
'.â ;. From a wheelman's point of view the
weather was all that could be desired yes
terday, and in ; consequence . the cyclists
were out in full force. The park seemed
to attract an immense number of riders
while Haywards was another point toward
which they headed.
Several of the organized clubs had runs
to San Leandro and Haywards, and in
dulged in practice spins around the tri
angular course, which will be the scene of
the great twenty-five-mile road race on
"Washington's birthday. The Reliance
Club Wheelmen, California Cycling Club
and Bay City Wheelmen all have racers
who have designs on the valuable prizes
in that race, and the men who are in train
ing for it took advantage of the pleasant
day to try their speed over the course.
. That following a racing tandem is not al
ways safe was demonstrated yesterday af
ternoon in the park. Walter F. Foster, the
Olympic Club wheelmen's crack rider, and
a lady friend were out on a tandem and
were going toward the beach at a lively
clip, when James Joyce. Jr., and Martin
L. Espinosa, two well-known wheelmen,
tacked on behind. 'y; The party was going
along at a rattling pace when Foster saw
danger ahead and slowed up quickly to
avoid. a collision. The other two, with
heads bent low, did not realize this until
too late, and both crashed into the tandem
from , behind with disastrous results.
Their wheels were all bent and twisted
and they i were themselves considerably
bruised. Espinosa- is an old time Olympic
Club athlete, and when the shock of the
collision threw him. into the air he turned
a somersault or two just to show the on
lookers that he had not forgotten his old
tricks, and landed -safely on his feet, but
the momentum threw 7 him down again.
Foster, his companion and the tandem
escaped without injury. The accident
happened quickly, but was very thrilling
while it lasted. 'â¢.*.."'â¢".-
Probably the most distinguished wheel
man the park has had in some time was
out enjoying a ride there yesterday after
noon. He was Prince Luigi of Savoy, who
arrived here last week on the Italian
cruiser Cnstoforo Colombo. He was ac
companied by one of his aids-de-camp,
Cay. Ettore Frigeris. They secured wheels
at a cyclery on Stanyan street and rode to
the beach and back. Both were delighted
with the trip and the Prince pronounced
the park one of the finest he had ever seen.
It is a paradise for wheelmen, and his only
complaint was the immense number of
carriages on the drive, which made riding
somewhat dangerous. He proposes to go
out again during this week.
The board of officers of the North Cali
fornia division. League of American
Wheelmen, met Saturday night at the
rooms of the Bay City Wheelmen. The
meeting was well attended, and consider
able business was transacted.
Chief Consul Kerrigan stated that by
special arrangement with the management
all league members would be admitted to
the coming indoor tournament at the Pa
vilion at one-half the regular admission.
The annual division meet was awarded to
Petaluma, and will take place July 4 and
5. . The league :is having some* elegant
oxidized silver lapel-buttons made to be
worn by the members. 7 The. various com
mittee "reports showed that the league is
receiving a great boom in this State. The
next meeting will be Â» held Saturday even
ing, March 21, at the rooms of the Garden
City Cyclers, San Jose. At this time the
league visiting committee will . call on the
San Jose Road Club and Franklin Road
Club of San Jose, and try to induce the
members to join the organization.
E. C. Bald, the champion of 1895, will
not ride the same make of wheel this year

A Big Meeting Promised for Next
Sundayâ How Doctoring Was
Punished.
Ocean View Coursing Park never before
held such a crowd as assembled there yes
terday to witness the running, and the en
thusiasts who were in attendance saw
coursing that has seldom been equaled on
this coast. The dogs were a high-class lot
and the hares in fine trim, all tending to
make betting lively and put the crowd in
first-class humor.

who turned out was a notable feature of
the day. Among the familiar faces x seen
on the grounds were: John.D. Daly, D.
Dennison, John Smith, Harry Corbett,

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Cleveland's Americanism seems to have
made one splutter and then died out.
Every one who rides over Folsom street
is in favor of overriding the Mayor's veto
on its improvement.
Â»
If the fight against the funding scheme
pauses for a moment the lobby will soon
rally and adopt a new trick.
There is one good thing about the Turk:
nobody regards him as a threatening com
petitor in any line of industry.
Â»
Even if Cleveland cannot recognize Cuba
he might at least recognize the inevitable
and advise the Spaniards to go home.
Now this week we must really insist that
the Senate take notice of the emergency
and proceed to consider the reform tariff.
The tramp problem has become so per
plexing in the East that some reformers
advocate the death penalty for habitual
hobos.
_. Â« .
Now that China is coming to the front
as a cotton-producer tbe Sunny South will
soon cease to hurl defiance at the "robber
tariff." ________

JUST PUNISHMENT.
The great indignation of the Southern
Pacific Company against 7 the Secretary of
the Interior for his refusal to issue patents
for granted lands until the railroad debt is
settled will not find much sympathy in
California. It has never been the policy
of the company to apply for patents until
it had made contracts with purchasers for
its granted lands and until these contracts
had been performed and the land was
ready to transfer. So long as no: patent
was in existence the company held no title
and therefore was not compelled to pay
taxes to the State of California and the
various counties in which the lands lay.
Thus the company had a distinct advan
tage over all other land-owners in the
State. It enjoyed all the advantages of
the ownership of land without any of its
burdens or risks. It held millions of land
which it could sell, but for which it could
i not be taxed. Its privileges were extraor-.
dinary and exclusive and its policy selfish,
injurious and unpatriotic.
This was only one of the ways ln which
the company evaded payment of its taxes.
The most scanaalous chapters in the his
tory of California concern transactions in
tax-paying matters. Besides current ru
mors of corruption the State and counties
have suffered enormous expense in fight
ing the company through all the courts in
endeavors to make it pay taxes on prop
erty which it owned; the public schools
have suffered and other property-owners
have , borne unjust burdens in conse
quence.
All this seems to be coming home at
last. Had the company long ago secured
patents to its granted lands and paid its
share of taxes these recent dangers would
not have arisen. The Miners' Association
is clamoring for an inspection of 1,000,000
acres of granted lands, in the belief that
such an inspection would discover them
to be mineral, and not patentable to the
company. The association is safeforthe
present, for the Secretary of the Interior is
determined not to issue any patents until
the railroad debt problem is solved, and
there is no way to compel him. The most
formidable danger of all is that the Gov
ernment may foreclose its mortgage and
take all the lands.
SAPETY AND SENTIMENT.
The arrest of two extraordinary young
criminals, Majors and Willmore, at Oak
land has reopened an old debate and com
plicated it with sentiment. The boys are
respectively 16 and 17 years of age.
Majors' father was a criminal of the most
vicious order and was hanged for murder.
The claim is now advanced in the son's
behalf that he possibly inherited his
criminal instinct and therefore, being in a
measure irresponsible, should be shown a
certain lenity. In Willniore's defense it
is urged that he was led astray by Majors.
Hence it is insisted that they should not
be treated as common criminals, should
not be sent to the penitentiary and thus
forever disgraced and ruined, but should
be given a chance in a reformatory institu
tion to realize their error and determine
upon a better course in life.
The logic'of such an argument is this: If
Majors is a congenita) moral idiot it would
be impossible to instill moral competency
into him; the only thing that might
serve as a restraint is fear of severe pun
ishment and such fear could be better ac
quired in a penitentiary than in a reform
school. As for Willmore, if he is so weak
as to become subject to any evil influence
which he may encounter he will always be
dangerous, as his weakness is manifestly.
of a" negatively vicious c ara;ter. The
main thing in his case is to keep him un
der restraint.
But there is no evident right to assume
that Willmore is less a moral idiot than
Majors. That both of them are extremely
dangerous young animals has been shown
by their daring and by their carrying pis
tols with which to kill if necessary. They
have asserted that if the arresting officers
had not covered them with pistols they
would have killed in defense of their lib
erty. That- they have, not committed nu
merous murders may be ascribed to a trick
of chance.
Very properly the criminal laws take no
cognizance of inherited vicious tenden
cies. That is the point at which the law
and the doctors have been in conflict for
many years. The more advanced position
of alienists is that in cases of uncontrol
lable tendency to criminal acts, the State
should go no further than keeping the
criminal in restraint. This is drawing
rather a fine distinction between imprison
ment in a penitentiary and in a prison
called by some other name. It is at cap
ital punishment in such cases that the op
position of the alienists is aimed, and
hence their contention cannot be made to
fit the cases of Majors and Willmore.
It is the duty and privilege of society to
protect itself. A moral idiot is far more
dangerous to the community than a per
son fully clothed with a sense of re
sponsibility for his acts, and hence his
treatment demands far severer methods.
This does not mean to say that these
methods; need be ,plenary. Majors, not
only by his criminal acts, but also by his
treatment of his mother, has proclaimed
himself so lacking in material out of
which a good man might be made, and so
richly endowed with every criminal in
stinct, that lenity toward him would be a
menace to the public safety.
A HANDSOME GIFT.
It is taken for granted that the Board of
Supervisors will accept James D. Phelan's
proffer of a monument to be erected at the
junction of Market, Turk and Mason
streets. His selection of a subject for
treatmentâ the Admission of California to
the Union eminently fit by reason not
only of the fact that Mr. Phelan is a native
of the State, but also because he is one of
the most enterprising of the younger
generation of Californians. It is fortunate
that he has abundant means with which
Ito make his good will effective. His choice
of Douglas Tilden, another native, : as the
sculptor, was wise and appropriate.
There are a good many other young men

developing its natural beauties. y The older

wealth were necessarily possessed of large
ability and understanding. The develop
ment and upbuilding of gigantic enter
prises is ; a vastly more potent force in the
broadening of character than the manage
ment of that which has already been cre
ated. The man who amasses knows under
what obligations to humanity he has
placed himself ;7he who merely inherits
has uncommon wisdom if he discover in
his ; character that .which the exigencies
of his life have neither created nor de
veloped.
If there are those who regard this as
an upology for the rich young men who
have not made the most of their wealth
for the public good, it must be deemed a
misfortune that the necessity for such an
apology .'exists. There are other young
men besides Mr. Phelan who have shown
an appreciation of their responsibility as
well as their power, and they should be
reserved ; from this estimate. But there
are yet opportunities for the profitable ex
ercise of their activity, and those who best
and soonest show their appreciation of the
fact will the ? more quickly impress the
community with their value as citizens.
THE EUROPEAN EXODUS.
An English paper so bold as Frcir's Co
lonial and Foreign Register (London) is a
very uncommon thing. Just what is its
standing with the English Government we
are not informed, but it is difficult to im
agine a British paper urging Englishmen
to settle in British colonies that has not
the sanction of the Government. But the
Register does not stop at that. While evi
dently preferring that Englishmen should
emigrate to British colonies, it would
rather see them come to the United States
than remain in England. Its reasons for
this are very strongly stated.
"Are you satisfied with living in Great
Britain," it asks, "where you spend your
life drudging in some occupation for a
mere pittance, perhaps? Why not go
abroad, where you are wanted and where
you can make a good income, and with
every possibility of your building up a
fortune for yourself and your successors?
In densely overpopulated Great . Britain
your remaining here is a detriment to
yourself and to the whole nation at large.
Every day it is becoming increasingly dif
ficult to make a living in this country. In
all new countries this is reversed. Good
incomes await energetic men in various
colonies and some foreign countries, and
for those possessed with good intelligence
and powers of steady hard work there are
fortunes to be made."
After further pursuing the distressing
condition in England and lauding the
colonies the Register turns its attention to
the United States: "The United States a
century ago was a scarcely known coun
try, given up, save in the extreme east, to
Indians and wild nature generally. To
day the United States is settled from the
Atlantic to the Pacific with the largest in
telligent collection of people in the world.
Its citizens are per capita perhaps the
richest and most independent of all the
nations of the globe. The settlers whose
energy has caused this phenomenal de
velopment made large fortunes, now being
enjoyed by their lucky descendants." And
more of that sort. . y 7* ''â 'â 'â¢'X-": >t
â  We have beard intelligent men in San
Francisco declare that the good lands of
the country have all been taken, and that
this is a sufficient reason not only for
checking immigration, but also for turn
ing Europe's poverty-stricken hordes to
still newer countries. As a matter of fact
we have not yet learned in this country
the rudiments of agriculture. A Portu
guese or Italian can make money on
land that we would not deign to cultivate,
and a Getmancan transform a desert into
a garden. The agricultural resources of
tbis country have hardly been touched, and
when properly developed might be made
to supoort in comfort a. hundred tiroes
as many people as we have. California
alone, with irrigation and intelligent farm
ing, could support a fourth of all the in
habitants of the United States. Unhap
pily England has not sent us its farmers,
for as a rule they are very poor and do not
own their land; but there is room here for
them, and he is a very dull American who
is unwilling or unable to learn agriculture
from the skilled farmers of Europe.

The Los Angeles Investor, after citing the
fact that the electric company which takes

intention of transmitting it to Los Angeles,
has secured â¢ franchises from both Kern
and Los Angeles counties, notes that a
right of way through the Government
forest reservation will next have to be
secured by i act of Congress. It was an
nounced in The Call a few days ago
that a bill providing for a right of
way twenty-five feet wide for poles and
wires over Govenment land has been
introduced in Congress. This, if passed,
will do away with the necessity for special
acts, and the presumption is that forest
reservations will come within its scope. If
there is any doubt about it the bill should
be made to cover that point. There is an

reservations, and in time it will be in de

that the olive section of California extends
no farther north than the Santa Ynez and
Tehachapi Mountains. The Fruit-Grower
says: "The last official estimate of the
acreage of olive orchards in the State was
published by the State Board of Horticul
ture in 1892. 'At 7 that 'time the bearing
olive orchards in the State amounted to
2883 acres, of which 1889 acres were within
the territory known as Southern California,
and referred to by the Cultivator as being
sou*, of the Tehachapi Mountains. To
north of that and including Central and
Northern California, there were 994 acres
of bearing olive trees. Of the orchards not
then in bearing the southern section com
prised 1758 acres, and the northern section
comprised 3356 acres, or nearly 100 per cent
more. * * ' Â« . Nowhere in Southern Cali
fornia or elsewhere are better crops of
olives produced than in a number of coun
ties, some of which are 400 miles north of
the northern limit of the 'olive belt'
as defined by the Cultivator. All the coun
ties round about'- San Francisco 7 Bay
and throughout the interior, including all
the river counties, produce fine olives that
pay good profits. As a matter of . fad no
better crops of olives can be produced in
Los Angeles County or Santa Barbara

"In reply to your letter to Claus Spreck
els he instructs me to' state that before
considering the question of establishing a
beet factory in any locality he must first
be satisfied of two things, viz.
'â¢Firstâ That there are 30,000 acres of good
available beet land in the immediate vicin
ity of the proposed factory.
"This in order that 10,000 acres may be
planted to beets each year. The land,
after raising beets, has to be planted to
other crops for two successive years in
order to recuperate.
"Second he must have samples of
beets grown from seed imported by us, for .
testing the saccharine, from quarter-acre
patches here and there all over these 30,
--000 acres, so as to assure him that .there
will be no lack of material on which to
work.

from Germany, and the same kind we use
at our Watsonville factory.

"Next be went into a barber-shop and looked
all over the place for a messenger-call and a

offered the tonsoriallst 15 cents! I suppose
you know that Carson is a two-bit town. He
paid his bill just as though somebody was
sandbagging him. After, he left the barber
shop, where he failed to get an egg shampoo,
he walked into a barroom and called for a
mixed drink such as people buy in the Palace

cigarettes, and concluded the evening by pay
ing a boy 10 cents to conduct him to the Ham

waiter to come and ask him what he wished
for breakfast. That was his crowning act of
cityfication, and fell heavily upon him when
the barkeeper sent a deck of cards and in

SUITS FOR BOYS.
The jackets of this season have a feature
which will recommend itself to any woman
attempting to make boys' jackets, and that is
the patch pockets, which are made of the ma
terial and fastened with buttoned flap. The
button can bo ; either of ; bone or made of the
cloth of jacket covered over a mold. The four
button sack coat Is the best accepted style for
general . wear t for the spring. V The "mixed
cheviots, cashmeres and homespuns make up ,
well, and for best suits the same style is ; fol
lowed, though the fabric is usually a smooth
faced cloth or a dart diagonal...
The coat buttons moderately high, and the
sleeves should be finished with two or three
buttons at the cuff. Boys' coats are easier to
make than many mothers imagine, if the cloth
is not too heavy. The pressing and neatly
stitched finish are the most aifhcult points for
the home dressmaker. - /
The kree trousers shown are cut very straight
to a point below the knee, and finished very
square. Whole suits of the same goods are the
best style, and it is advisable to make or pur
chase an extra pair of trousers to every suit,
especially for the youngest boy. :

Mayor Sutro and Party Visit
the ; Italian Cruiser
Colombo.
A RIVAL PASSENGER BUSINESS.
Strong Sentiments of yan Italian-
American Citizenâ of *
the Australia.
Yesterday was reception day on board
Italy's cruiser, the Cristoforo Colombo,
now in this port. The first to arrive on
board was Mayor Sutro, accompanied by
Collector J. H. Wise, Supervisor C. L.
Taylor, J. T. Rogers the Mayor's secre
tary, and several newspaper men." The
party was escorted by Editor Albert P.
Morbio of L'ltalia, who represented
the Italian Consular ofiice. It was the
Mayor's official call upon Lieutenant
Savoy, or Prince Luigi as he is generally
known, and Collector Wise went along to
represent the Federal, and Supervisor Tay
lor the municipal part of the body politic
in this port.
Chief Justice Beatty went as far as the
wharf, and had to return home, leaving
the reporters to represent the judiciary.
The Colombo's steam launch- took them
out to the big war vessel. They fevere re
ceived at the gangway by the ship's offi
cers in full uniform and the melody of
"Hail, Columbia," by the brass band. â¢ It
plays well, that band, though tbey are a
part of the sailor crew of the ship, and
, scrub decks and haul ropes when not fin
gering their cornets and basalioma.
Captain Bertolini received the visitors
on the quarterdeck and conducted them to
his cabin. The Prince was absent, and the
plain skipper of the cruiser had to repre
sent his royal "leitenant." The conversa
tion was in English, except when the cap
tain lost his surroundings in that tongue
and drifted into French, whither only the
Mayor and Editor Morbio could follow him.
The cabin of an Italian man-of-war and
the apartments of a royal lieutenant are
not princely affairs. A plebeian ensign in
a United States cruiser would "kick" for a
finer room. Plainness marks everything
fore and aft in the Colombo, and evidently
Italy puts but little of her matchless art in
her ships. However, there appears to be
comfort there, from the commander's
ample cabin to the clean white cots in the
"sick bay," and the long, slim six 4^Â£
inch gunsâ twelve-centimeters, they call
themâ look formidable.
In the cabin can be seen a reminder of
an old Italian customâ large, richly
carved wooden ring in an ornamental case.
When Venice, the long-ago Queen ol the
Sea, annually wedded Adriatic a jeweled
ring was thrown into the waves. When
Italy launches a ship a wooden rin^ is
heaved overboard to* bind her nuptials
with Neptune, and is afterward recovered
to remain in her as a sign of her marine
matrimonial relation.
A glass of wine with Commander Ber
tolini, an invitation to Prince Luigi and
his brother officers to visit the heights
next Friday, which the Italian captain ac
cepted, and the Mayor led the way over
the gangway and into the launch, the
guard presenting arms and the sailor band
playing again ''Hail, Columbia."
In the afternoon the ship was visited by
the public, who came under the auspices
of the Italian Benevolent Society. The
association had employed the Alert and
the launch Amy to carry the people out to
the cruiser at 60 cents the round trip. A
great number went out to the Colombo
and her decks were crowded with visitors
till sundown.
The officers were most assiduous in their
efforts to entertain the visitors that fairly
swarmea all through 7 the vessel. The
band played for them, and the day's pleas
ure was an open-air concert and bay ex
cursion in one.
But tbe arrangements, were not satisfac
tory to everybody, for by an agreement
with the officers of the benevolent society
Captain Bertolini would not permit out
side boats to land at the; gangway of his
ship. The tugs Millie and i Ethel and
Marion took off a load of people and were
obliged to bring them directly.back to the
wharf amid tbe howls of ! their passengers
for the return of tbe fare.
This was done at a loss to the boats, as
only one kind of tickets had been given
out at 50 : cents for adults and children
half-fare. On the return the boys gave
their half-fare tickets to a number of men
who collected a half-dollar thereon. The
tug men's money from the sale of the tick
ets soon ran out and there was trouble,
indeed. Those who bad not received their
return fare threatened to throw somebody
overboard, and tbe deficit had to be made
up from the tug officers' private funds.
A number of fishermen came off in their
boats, bringing their families. They were
not permitted to board the ship, and then
there was war in Italy.
The fishermen stood in their boats and
protested that it was an outrage that they
could not visit a ship from their native
land; They gesticulated and abused the
ship, her officers and the society in choice
Italian. The sounds of the loud and not
unmusical voices reminded one of a scene
among the boats in the bay of Naples, and
the bright, clear, warm day helped out the
idea. * ."
One big, handsome fellow, with : a fine
voice, was the leader of the protestants.
He mingled nationalities and navies in his
tirade, which, translated, was somewhat
in this line:
"You may take your old hulk and go
to in her. We build better ships every
day right over on that shore than Italy
owns. We are American citizens even if
naturalized, and we hay% American money
in our pockets and we don't care a sou for
your old ship." â¢;
His oratory only provoked laughter from
his good-natured countrymen on board
the Colombo. . -r
Speeches, songs, a good dinner and a
brass band were all employed yesterday by
the Society of Italian Veterans in enter
taining the petty officers of the Italian war
ship Colombo. The dinner was given at
Garibaldi Hall and was a great success in
every particular. The local Italians and
their guests fraternized and spent several
hours most merrily. : â¢ .-..: '.,-,
There were places laid for over 100 peo
ple. About twenty-five of these were of
ficers of the man-of-war. -.-. There . were a
few of the notables of the : Italian colony,
not veterans, present as guests. B. Cbeli,
president of the Italian Veterans, pre
sided at tbe bead of the table. At his side
sat Italian Consul Grimaldi and Chevalier
J. Ualegaris. The other guests were ar
ranged in the order of their.' rank. .
An address of welcome was delivered by
Consul Grimaldi, which was t received with
cheers and , a bumper of wine for Italia.
Chevalier Calegaris > followed ' in :an elo
quent speech; and President Cheli assured
the i visitors . of tbe love : and confidence of
their California brothers. Dr. Vaccari,
Captain L. Baglietto and others - spoke.
Songs were sung and even after the table
had been cleared the guests lingered,' told
stories, sang , choruses and swore eternal
friendship. 7 ây,;-^^. â

Two days , before the vessel arrived in

Paul Keuse and Richard Connollyâ were
ordered to do; some work on the donkey
boiler, which they ; refused to do. The
men were placed under arrest by Captain
Houdlette and turned over to the authori
ties on the arrival of the Australia here.
The men claim ; that they had just come
off their watch and the order was an- im
proper one. They also claim* that they
did not really refuse to do the work, but
were considering the matter when placed
under arrest.
The British ship Bardowie, loaded and
nearly ready for sea, dragged her anchor
yesterday morning and fouled the Italian
ship ; Salvator ; Ciampa, also loaded ; and
ready for sea. The Bardowie was hove too
short on her cable and the anchor could
not hold her in the swift tide. She had
her davits bent, her rail and two shrouds
carried away. The Ciampa had her bow
sprit shrouds and jibboom-guys carried
away. Her anchor-fluke caught in an open
port of the Bardowie and the chain was un
shackled, leaving it hanging where it had
caught. Several tugs went to the assist
ance of the two vessels and they were
finally separated.
THOUGHT HE WAS SAFE.
Thomas Warren, Alias Stone, Arrested
for a Burglary Over a Year Ago.
The residence of Thomas Macraw, 1019
Seventeenth street, was entered by burglars
on the night of December 13, 1894, and jew
elry, money and other property were
stolen.
Detectives Gibson and "Wren recovered
the stolen property, and got a clew to the
burglar. Early yesterday morning they
arrested him on Sacramento street, and
charged him with the burglary. He gave
the name of Thomas Warren, but his real
name is Thomas Stone. ..
Stone left the City almost immediately
after the burglary, and returned two or
}hree days ago under the impression that
the police had forgotten all about it, but
he soon found his mistake.

. s Works. :
A Large Audience Listens to Music
With Novelty in Its Modu
lations.
Richard H. Lucchesi yesterday gave a
recital of his works in Beethoven Hall, on
Post street, which â  was attended by the
Duke degli Abruzzi and one of his aids-de
camp. For many years Mr. Lucchesi has
been a music-teacher in this City, but yes
terday was the first time that he has come
prominently before the public as a writer
of music. : "7' J
. The statement that the Prince was to be
present had attracted a large audience.
The concert was billed to commence at 3
p. m. and just as the clocks were striking
the hour the guest of honor entered and
was escorted by Mr. Lucchesi to a magnifi
cent chair of Batin and rosewood, which
had been placed for him directly, facing
the platform. The young officer modest ly
excused himself from occupying this ex
alted position, and withdrawing with his
aid-de-camp to the side of the hall, he
talked with G. Almagia, editor of I'ltalia,
and Mrs. Almagia until the concert began.
So quietly had the advertised guests en
tered that few people were aware that
Prince Luigi was in the hall.
Contrary to the forms and ceremonies of
European countries the arrival of royalty
was not the signal for the commencement
of the concert. About a quarter past three
the performers took the platform for the
opening number, which was a trio in 0
minor, marked on the programme as the
composer's opus 59. .
The trio was for violin, violoncello and
pianoforte, the performers being J. Jo
sephs, L. yon der Mehden and Richard H.
Lucchesi.
The work received a friendly reception,
the young Duke being foremost in applaud
ing his compatriot. The other concerted
number was a quintet in D major (opus
47), which was played by Messrs. Lucchesi,
Josephs, Dabefow, Heinsen and yon der
Mehden. Josephs, 7 the first . violin, did
good work in keeping the other instru
ments together.
In this concerted music, as well as in the
two pianoforte compositions which he him
self played, Mr. Lucchesi showed consider
able daring in following out his own ideas
and avoiding the beaten paths of old form ;
indeed, it may be said that the composi
tions he played yesterday defied analysis
to a considerable extent, not only from the
point of harmonic structure, but also as
regards form. Even tho i scherzo, which is
nothing more than a dance form, showed
the same indifference to trammeled rules.
The melodic invention displayed was
scarcely up to the standard â of Mr. Luc
chesi's originality in his modulations,
which were c surprisingly novel. In fc the
quintet there were some melodies that re
called Dvorak, but otherwise no one could
accuse the â â  composer yof being "remin
iscent" in his themes. For his barcarolle
entitled "Gondoliera": Mr. Lucchesi re
ceived a warm - encore, .to which he ''â  re
sponded by playing aâ â  charming gavotte
by Padre Martini, an old Italian com-'
poser. :> '77 . - 77."
â¢: Mme. Emilia Tojetti, the vocalist of the
concert, showed herself to be possessed of
a fine voice and a splendid stage presence.
She sang "Oh, don Fatale,". from * "Don
Carlos," with a volume of voice that won
her a splendid encore. If Mme. Tojetti
had : studied y seriously for ; grand: opera
there is no doubt but that j with her gifts
she might have become a lyric star,

UNIQUE CHURCH EDIFICE
Picturesque Place of Worship of
Rev. Joseph Worcester's
Church.
WESTMINSTEK ABBEY - KELIC.
One of the Few Sanctuaries That Are
Crowded at Every Sabbath
Service.
The new church, or Church of the New
Jerusalem, possesses a unique interest to
worshipers.
It is commonly known as the Sweden
borgian Church and has two branches, one
of which is located on O'Farrell street, the
other on Lyon.
The latter is usually referred to by its
members as Mr. Worcester's church.for the
strong but gentle personality of its pastor
has made its imprint upon the character
, of the service, which is exceedingly eim-

pie, as well as [ upon the lives of his par
ishioners.
The church membership is small. It
was predicted by Sweuenborg, the founder
of the parent church, that in a numerical
sense this would always be true, but that
other churches would assimilate its doc
trines, and his followers believe this is be
ing fulfilled. The membership of Mr.
Worcester's church shows less than half a
hundred names, but it is a united little
band.
Rev. Joseph Worcester is a native of
Massachusetts, and the son of a Sweden
borgian minister of Boston. For the past
twenty -five' years he has officiated as one
of the leaders of Swedenborgian thought
in this City: and State. He is pre-emi
nently a scholar, but has many qualities
that have endeared him to those not
within the jurisdiction of his church.
Architectural studies have been his recrea
tion for years, and have led him into close
friendship with the late A. Pago Brown
and others prominent in his profession;
â¢ It is related of him that when he spent a
summer vacation among the Santa Cruz
mountains he arranged that the trunks of
eight madrona trees should be sent to this
City for rafters in the church that was
then building. â  ;;
The elderly couple with whom he had
made the contract were so won by the gen
tle kindliness of the minister thai, . al
though they executed their part of the
contract in providing the rafters and send
ing them from the Santa Cruz Mountains
to San Francisco by team, they refused to
accept any payment therefor. '-.
Mr. Worcester's picturesque brown cot
tage is said to occupy the highest habit
able point : in the City. Situated Jon~ an
overhanging ledge at the summit of Rus
sian Hill, it commands a view of the City,
the bay and hills calculated to inspire the
beholders to lofty â¢ thoughts and i living,
and is an ideal home for a philosopher. -
The church is on Lyon street, near Jack
son. It is one of the smallest; as well as
most unique, specimens of church archi
tecture in the City. \_ A. low, sauare ; build
ing of brick and concrete, with heavy iron
gates, it is of the early Italian style, and
its quaint outline brings up vague- memo
ries of the land of song and story,
The interior has a suggestion of Gothic
strength about it. y The main rafters are
the trunks of madrona trees in the - rude
ness of their forest symmetry. No curve
has been ; destroyed â â  or excrescence re
moved. Tbey are attached to the beams
by heavy iron bands, and in their simplic
ity and strength are an Index of the whole.
The walls and ceiling ha. no veil of lath
and plaster to hide their mechanism. At
the rear of the ' audience-room * is ; a great
brick fireplace, from which the steam pipes
are laid. y It has been found that the pipes
and radiators are f superfluous, ; and ;it is
probable that they will be dispensed with
and that the flames in the fireplace will
furnish all the heat required.
â -y On the right of the- worshipers are high,
many-paned 7 windows, curtained 7 by a
creamy stuff, through which the light falls
softly; on >â  the - : four * William l Ki.th â :â  land
scapes, which I constitute j the i wall Â» decor

Time," another of "Harvest," a third of
"The Early Rains," and the last a vista of

harmony with the; design of the 'building,"
whose rugged adherence to 5 nature's plan
reminds the worshiper of the poet's words,"
"The groves were God's first temple.'! yy?-.
What â  corresponds to the chancel and
reading desk of orthodox churches are con
structed in a severely simple style, in con
sonance with the plan of the building and
its furnishings. â 
Upholstered pews are tabooed =in the ;
Church of the New Jerusalem. _ The attend
ants f upon '* its i services i occupy ; rush-bot
tomed maple chairs of the style in vogue
generations ago, and each is provided with
a braided mat. 7 7-7*-
The - light 7 streams upon X the preacher
from an oval stained-glass window, repre
senting a dove - resting .; upon a baptismal
font, the gift of Bruce Porter.
Rarest of the factors that go to make up
the artistic interior is a small window at
the left of the organ. Through this long, 1
narrow? window, with its tiny ; panes,
leaded centuries ago, the light Â» streamed
upon tombs of the illustrious in Westmin
ster Abbey. The window, valuable be
cause of the sacredness of its associations,
came into the possession of Bruce Portor,
and he, believing â it . could have no more
honorable place, presented it to the little
church on Lyon street. y: 7
â  â  Notwithstanding the small church mem
bership the artistic little place of worship is
filled every Sabbath. - Yesterday morning
there was scarcely, space enough to accom
modate the audience.
Mr. Worcester's Idiscourse might be
styled a paraphrase of . his text: "He
causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
and herb for the service of man, that he
may bring forth out of the â  earth; and
wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
and oil to make his face shine, and bread
which strengthened man's heart."
He said; "Except salt and a little ani
mal food, man depends ~ wholly upon
plants for his food. He depends upon
their fiber and solid wood largely for his
home and innumerable comforts.
"Plants form a large part of the environ
ment of man. The beautiful things of
this world are manifestations of God. The
fact that pleasure is derived from these
manifestations is a proof of the divine or
igin of man.
"If the mind be ready to receive the
truth the gentle affections thrive. But if
instead of ; such fertility the ground ;be
sterile from selfishness the gentle , senti
ments wither and die.
"But not only : may the mind be com
pared to the fields, but to the herbs that
grow thereon, the herbs that depend upon
the sunshine and rain and soil for their
nutriment. Herbs that should furnish the
food, not the poison, of the world.
"The 'oil to make his face to shine' has
a parallel in the kindliness of soul that
illuminates the face. The eyes may shine
with intelligence, but the face shines with
kindness. With such oil may every face
and life be made the brighter.
"The truth of God's providence may be
shut out from the heart as seed may be
prevented from .sinking into the ground
because of the stoniness. For the quality
of the soil of our natures we are not re
sponsible, but we are accountable for its
cultivation. 7 Stones are the hard facts of
the world that are prone to cover the soil
of our spiritual nature. It is our duty to
remove these stones and pull un the chok
ing weeds springing between them. The
soil may be sown with good thoughts that
shall be carefully sustained. Flowers, the
blossoms of right living and thinking, will
then spring up about us. Yet we must
not linger among the flowers, but take our
place among the hardier grains, lives bear
ing their responsibilities â of â  creating . and
maintaining public - sentiment, strong and
pure." _________ __ " :
AGAINST THE PESTHOUSE.
The Castro ; Club Makes Vigorous Pro-
test Against Moving It.
The Castro Club met last night in Twin
Peaks Hall. ; F. W. Merrill ; acted as secre
tary and J, J. Smith presided. The follow
ing resolutions, which are to be presented
to the Supervisors, were adopted :
Resolved, If the Supervisors shall so' torget
their plain auty as to put the Pesthouse on the
Almshouse tract that we shall hold ihem ' as
opposers of our neighborhood and keep them
always in our memories as ' betrayers of their
trusts.-';-". '.'â  >"â 'â '"-" . 'â â â "â ':â : rt> - i --'.. "â â --- ' <â â â :'â  ':'.'.' â '
. : Resolved, That the building of such an â  insti
tution in the geographical center of this City
is a sin against decency and meets with our
unqualified condemnation, and we want our
City officials to understand our disgust at their
lack of common-sense and business tact shown
in the i considering of such â  site. -If they must
have a central place we suggest the Fair lot on
Nob Hill is an appropriate one, commanding a
magnificent view, handy : to the â  banks and
hotels and easily reached by the streetcars. -:
-- Resolved, That some place should be selected
for a penthouse outside of the line of business
and residence development, and in â no sense
can this be said of I the Almshouse tract." It is
clear that, with; the opening of new electric
lines, this traot will, in the course of ten years,
be surrounded with the homes of our people,
and we think it a shame that such -a pool of
filth,' to I which a pesthouse may be compared,
should- be deliberately made to fester across
the path of progress. ,7 ;

ARE PREPARED TO FIGHT
Proprietors, of Poker "Games
Will Attack the Or
dinance.
â â â  - i
CHIEF CROWLEY IS CONFIDENT.
He Sees No Reason Why the Men
Arrested Should Not Be Read
ily Convicted.
The proprietors of the houses wherein
the poker games were raided Saturday
night are preparing to make a vigorous
fight against the new ordinance, under
which they are being made to suffer. A"
test case will in all probability be made of
some one of the arrests made, and the
doubt, which the saloon men claim their
legal advisers have as to the validity of the
ordinance, will thus be set at rest. Besides
attacking the validity of the ordinance,
Cook & Higgins of, Our House and Mr.
Hornlein of the Cafe Royal intend to make
a special defense that their gaming* rooms
do not come within the provisions of the
ordinance. Both of these places have
their "clubrooms" separated from the bar
room by partitions extending . to the ceil
ing. This, they claim, exempts them irom
tbe provision of the ordinance forbidding
poker-playing in a place where there is a
public bar.
"The entire provided the ordinance
is valid, "X said Mr. Hornlein to a Call re
porter, "rests upon the question whether
or not our clubrooms are part of the bar
room. In the case of the 2 Cafe Royal the
clubrooms are partitioned off and the en
trance is not through the saloon, but is
from Pine Court. We have a regularly or
ganized club, and the only connection it
has with the â¢ saloon is that the members
buy their drinks and cigars at the bar.
For this purpose a door leads from the
clubrooms to the barroom. This is solely
for the accommodation of the waiters and
is not a general entrance. Wherein then
does our place differ from the Bohemian
or any other club?
"I knew the officers were about to make
a raid, but I didn't allow it to worry me
any. I felt- confident that J was doing
nothing wrong and I did noj believe they
would disturb this place." .
Bernard Conway of "The New House"
has no special defense, but intends to rely
upon proving the evidence invalid. "I
am' opposed to gambling," he said. "I
wish they would stop all gambling and
make it a crime. As long as gambling is
allowed anywhere I must allow the, games
to run here or lose part of my custom. What
is the sense of saying a man can play poker
in a cigar store or a drugstore, but that he
cannot play anywhere where liquor is sold ?
It looks to mc like class legislation, and I
do not believe that the ordinance can stand.
If they would pass a law forbidding all
gambling 1 would be in favor of it, but
this one is not fair and I will fight it."
Cook & Higgins of "Our House" took
the precaution to procure competent legal
advice before the storm broke. As a re
sult a few days ago they caused a partition
separating the barroom from their club
rooms to be run up to the ceiling. They
feci confident that this exempts them from
the ordinance. .
Chief Crowley does not share the opin
ion of the victims of the raid that the ordi
nance is inoperative. "To me," he said,
"it looks like the ordinance is perfectly
clear. All this talk about clubs and club
rooms is mere subterfuge. Whether or
not the clubs could be brought under the
ordinance is a question, but there is cer
tainly a difference between a public bar
and a place where members and guests of
the club exclusively are served. Of course
those men will not plead guilty and it is
not my fault if there is anything in the
ordinance which renders it invalid.- 1 am
no lawyer and that is a question for the
courts to decide.
"This question of gambling is one of the
most vexatious we have to deal with. We
can't stop it and perhaps it would be just
as well to license it. At any rate we will
continue raiding all the places running in
violation of this ordinance until it is de
clared void."
THE THEATERS TO-NIGHT.
What the Managers Have on the Bills
for the Benefit of Their Patrons.
At the Baldwin this evening the Tavary
grand opera company will begin the sec
ond week of its engagement and will pre
sent "Lucia di Lammermoor" and "Cav
alleria Rusticana" with a strong cast in
each opera. These old favorites always
have strong attractions for the people.
. Judging from the crowd that stood in
line during the past week in order to ob
tain seats there will be a crush at the Cali
fornia this evening to listen to Ignace
Paderewski. One of the pieces he plays,
"The Fantasie Polonaise,' has set the peo
ple raving wherever he has played it.
. Corinne opens at the Columbia Theater
this ; evening, having with her company
moved from the California. She will pre
sent "Hendrick Hudson," 7 which proved
such an attraction last week and which
was the talk of the town. It is a bright
and up-to-date production that pleases. ,
"My Partner," written by Bartley Camp-'
bell, is to be*V>resented at the Grand Opera
house this evening with all the accessories
that make it an attractive play. It is one
of those plays that have beem imitated by
many, ' but , equaled by none. It has a
good plot and is interesting.
The manager of the Alcazar Theater has
decided to present to the patrons of the
house 7 to-night '- Campbell's sensational
play, - "The White Slave." The . play is
one of I Southern life, and it will be offered
with many striking scenes and vivid tab
leaux. .â 
"The y Gentle Savage" will hold the
boards at the Tivoli Opera House another
week, for the real soldier, from the ; regu
lar army and the fandango, given as it is
danced on the border, are attractions that
entertain, as well as do the songs that this
production is marked with.
As usual, the billvfor this evening at the
Orpheum Music Hall is made up of many
attractive features, and no less. than eight
recent arrivals from the East and Europe,
who will ; appear in specialties for wluch
they have been highly commended wher
ever they have appeared.
. The Frawley company will appear at
the 7 Macdonougb, in Oakland, this even
ing, and I present "Men and Women" for
the benefit of Charles E. Cook, the popular,
manager,' who of late has done so much to
furnish amusement for the Â° people of the
City of Oaks. _

RecentlyfiHeld in Rochester,

There was the usual large and : enthusi
astic attendance at the Good Citizen meet
ing yesterday in Metropolitan Temple.
H. W. Quitzow, Chairman of the Good
Citizenship Committee, opened the meet
ing with the following remarks:
American Citizens and Friends: The assem
bling here to-day of this vast audience is again
an evidence that we are determined' to carry
to ut the principles ot the American Protective
"Association. We stand upon a broad platform
and allow the same rights to others that we
tisk for ourselves. We say again that the word
' "liberty" shall not be misinterpreted to mean
: license.
Following the singing of "America" by
the choral society and audience Rev. Dr.
C. A. Rabing delivered the following
prayer:
Let us bow in prayer. We praise thee,, our
I heavenly Father, in the name of thy son, our
Savior, for the privilege of once more assem

.'Lord, for these good things that are being ac
complished. We thank thee for enabling us
to see such a mass of peonlc out to-day looking

doing according as we have been bid. We pray
'.thee bless these meetings from one Sunday .to
another and make the good, that comes from
them heard throughout the land. We thank
'thee for what thou hast already done through

Chairman Quitzow then read from copies
of the New York Herald from January 31
and February 1 extracts from reports of the
Superior Council of the American Protec
tive Association, held in Rochester on the
28th and 29th of January. Among his quo
tations were the following:
The convention represented an actual voting
strength in this State (New York) of 313,000,
and in the Nation of about 3,500,000..
It is an assertion not too iranrobable to make
that the allied patriotic orders, so called, form
the most stupendous and powerful political
organization that ever existed.
It dwarfs the Knownothing party even, as It
far outranks it in stability ana probable dura
tion. . .? V-<
It is the most potent present factor in
American politics; and only to a slightly less
degree is it a factor in the politics of Canada,
England and Germany, for the patriotic associa
tion circles the globe.
Its associate membership in Canada, En
gland and in Germany, where the name of the
country precedes the title "Protective Associa
tion," and in every nation where a republican
form of government obtains or is among the
things hoped lor and striven forâ Spain, in
Austria, in Italy, even â in Russia and the
colonies of the old numbers high in
the millions. The Supreme Council of the
world, which will meet either in St. Louis,
Chicago, or Washington next May, will repre
sent nine millions of men, and women's auxil
iaries with a membership of about 400,000.
The most . important action taken by the
council in Rochester was with reierence to the
coming Presidential nominations. A political
policy was formulated by the convention, the
matter of candidates and a line of action laid
down regarding the question of party platform
and Issues. â¢ â * â¢
The American Protective Association and the
allied orders are non-partisan. They make no
nominations of their own, but indorse the can
didacy of such men as are personae gratae to
them. . .
The superior council in following out tne re
quirements of its constitution declared that it
would indorse only that party or. those parties
which should nominate candidates whose
records are not opposed to the principles of the
association, upon a platform which should em
body patriotic utterances consistent with these
principles. â  - â  â
One of the startling statements made by a
member from Albany was to the effect that
Senator David B. Hill had acknowledged to a
friend a lack of political foresight when he
undertook to carry the State for the Demo
cratic party in 1894 on an anti-A". P. A. plat
form. Another candidate who was declared to
be persona non- grata to many .in the associ
ation was . Roswell P. Flowerâ not because of
his personal record, but because of his affili
ation with the Tammany organization.
The American Protective Association will de
mand as the consideration for its support of
any nominee of any party for President that
the platform of the National convention of
that party shall reaffirm the principle of the
total separation of church and state, the re
striction ol immigration and the reform of the
laws regarding citizenship and the rights of
franchise.
It will demand, too, that such a party shall
reaffirm its â¢ faith in tne American public
school system as the basis of liberty and pros
perity. "~
The allied orders make claim to a member
ship representing more than one-fourth of the
voting population of the United States. They
assert that they hold absolutely the balance
of power and that it is in their power to elect
or defeat any Presidential nominee. .
â¢ The National league for the protection of
American institutions and the various patri
otic orders meet â¢on â¢ common ground. The
league is working for this amendment, the six
teenth, to the constitution of- the United
States: j -swfljuff__n_igm_wf_^j^.
"Neither Congress nor any State shall
pass any law respecting an establishment of
religion, or. prohibiting â¢ the free - exercise
thereof, or use the property or credit of the
United States, or of any State, or any money
raised by taxation, or authorized either to be
used for the purpose of founding, maintaining
or aiding by appropriation, payment lor ser
vices, expenses or otherwise any church, re
ligious denomination or religious society, or
any institution, society or undertaking which
is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesi
astical control."
Regarding the personnel of its membership
an interesting report was read at the Rochester
meeting.
It is said that 108 members of Congress, the
Governors of four States.majorities in the Legis
latures of several States, the school boards of
two hundred and fourteen cities and towns
and a i majority of city and town officials in
Â«very central and Western State were mem
bers of or allied with the A. P. A. The mem
bership in this State, which is 313,000, is
growing at the average rate of fourteen coun
cils a week, to which belong at the lowest esti
mate 1000 members. \ ,
Although the country membership now out
numbers the city four -to one, yet" the city
councils are increasing in membership in the
ratio as against . the country increase. In
Buffalo, in Elmira. and in Chemung and Brook
lyn , the A. V. A. already holds the balance of
power. ."-' â¢ 'â  -
Commenting on this, Chairman Quitzow
said: _ y ;*' â â¢ââ '
We may be encouraged with a sure prospect
of being victorious when we consider that in a
city like Brooklyn our organization s holds the
balanco of power. We > have only got to attend
to our end here; the, other end are doing their
share theie."^atM|9KS9nÃi______M_B_.
When the choral society had sung '.'Rally
Bound the Flag," Key. D; Ray. Palaier
made the address of the day, taking as his
subject, "What the Popes Say." He spoke
as follows:
- "Ladies and gentlemen and friends:
There are some people who wonder wny so
large a number can come here Sunday
after Sunday and never grow less '; in their
enthusiasm. They say it is a wonder that
we do not get tired of all this nonsense.
"It reminds me very much of the little
boy who. paid a visit to his grandmother,
and who, while she was busy knitting,
went into the cupboard and ate up all her
pumpkin pies. She wondered it did not
kill him. But we said we are all not con
stituted alike and so it is with us. The
reason why we can come . here Sunday
after Sunday is that we are not all consti
tuted alike."
"I suppose our friends" who have been
delivering those addresses showing the
loyalty and : patriotism of Catholics have
convinced their hearers 7 that their, state
ments are all true, and they have, perhaps,
convinced themselves that they are true.
There was a lawyer in Dallas, Texas, who,
in his peroration in defense of his client,
while addressing the jury, said, 'I am satis
fied that my arguments have" convinced
you of the innocence of my client, for my
client is almost convinced of it himself,' ,
and so it is with our friends. They have
almost convinced themselves that they are
loyal and patriotic.
"They have discovered in the American
Protective Association an un-American
bugbear. They have found that in our
society, which they presumed to be uncon
stitutional, the liberty of man."
The speaker then related the story of a
member of the Illinois Legislature who
was always objecting to things on the
ground of their being unconstitutional.
Abraham Lincoln, the lecturer said, was a
member of this Legislature, and on one
occasion, for the benefit of the objecting
member, related a story regarding a cer
tain gentleman who fired three shots
through his window at what he supposed
was a sqirrel in a tree near by. The squir
rel failed to fall, and the marksman called
the attention of his son to the fact of the
squirrel's wonderful escape. , The son
looked for the squirrel and then at his
father and . soon saw the solution ,of the
mystery. Addressing his father he said :
"Why, father, you old fool, there's a bug
on your eyebrow, and that's what you took
for a squirrel.".
"That," said the speaker, "is what is the
trouble with our friends. There, is noth
ing more than a bugbear in their own eye
brows.
"Our subject to-day is, .'What the Popes
Say.' y .
"Do you want to know Rome's attitude
regarding all our institutions? Then go
to the head. It is the Pope who speaks
with unquestionable authority. Up to
1870 infallibility was vested in the Pope
and the council, but since then it is vested
in the Pope alone. The Pope, whose word
is a law from which there can be no appeal,
whose triple crown symbolizes that he is
the ruler in heaven, earth and hell, speaks
for the whple'Roman Catholic world, and
never did mortal man claim such absolute
monarchy as does this man in Rome.
"Let us hear to-day what the Popes say
and take warning and act the part of wise
men to protect the cause of freedom.
"I want to prove to you to-day from the
statements of the Popes of Rome that
Rome is the enemy of religious liberty.
"Pope Pius VIII declared as follows in
one of his encyclical letters: 'The Govern
ment of France demands that we shall
allow the free exercise of all forms of wor
ship. This article is opposed to the Cath
olic religion and we have rejected it.'
Thus, according to Pope Pius, the Roman
hierarchy forbids us to worship God ac
cording to the dictates of our cOn.cience.
"Our liberties to-day are in the balance,
and the more priests we have- upon our
shore the more in danger are these liber
ties. They want to make us a present of
the Pope. * They want all things subor
dinated. When a potentate of India has a
grudge against a man he makes him a
present of a white elephant, knowing that
its care will eventually ruin him. Our
Catholic friends want to make us a present
of the Pope and his ; rule. I say. my
friends, let them keep their white ele
phant; we don't want it. 7
"In the year 1815 POpe Pius "VII pro
tested strongly against the council of
Vienna granting Christian nations the
right to worship as they please.
"In 1818 Pope Pius VII was successful
with the King of Naples in having the
Catholic religion made the only relieion
permitted in the kingdom.
"The new constitution .of Ecuador de
clares that the * religion of the Republic
shall be Roman Catholic to the exclusion
of every other form of worship. And so
our Catholic friends ask us to look abroad
in the world and to behold the great things
they have done for humanity. We are
doing it this afternoon.
''This reminds me of the doctor who
referred his complaining patient who ap
peared to lack full confidence in him to
his other patients, and who was somewhat
taken aback when the lady in question re
plied: 'I have never learned the dead
languages.'
"The design of Rome in the United
States is to abolish freedom, to execrate
and undermine our constitution. I say
that we, as American citizens, will not sit
supinely by and see this done. We will
not allow ourselves to play the Gulliver to
these Lilliputians.
"I now quote from the encyclical letters
from another Pope. I quote from Pope
Gregory XVI. In his letter of August 15,*
1832, he said: 'From this indifference
grows that absurd agitation in favor of
liberty of conscience which is everywhere
attempting to overthrow religious influ
ence. This is the pest of all others which
is bringing about the liberty of opinion.'
"Why, the opinions we are expressing
here from Sunday to Sunday are diametri
cally opposed to'the teachings of the Ro
man hierarchy. But, thank God, we live
in free America!
"I have it in evidence from past ex
perience that minds religiously free will
be politically free also. Now our Catholic
friends in San Francisco claim : that all
members of the Catholic church are free
politically, according to Pope Gregory.
But we Know that the man who is bound
religiously is bound politically, and I set
Pope Gregory against Father Peter C.
Yorke.
"The Pope could not exist without
kings; the union of the church is essen
tial to its safety. These principles are
utterly at variance with our republic and
the republic is at variance with the hier
archy. I say that whatever other nations
may do I can speak with confidence when
I say that the American people will never
recognize the â¢ Pope of Rome either as
Caesar or God.
'. "Pope Pius IX said that the Roman
Catholic church ought to be : dominant so
that every other form of worship would
be interdicted. This same ' Pope Pius IX
on August 15, 1845, said' that the absurd
and ruinous doctrine of freedom of wor
ship is the most pestilent evidence; of re
ligious liberty and is to be the most
dreaded in tbe State. Yet such as Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson and 7 Daniel
Webster have placed themselves on record
in history as preferring liberty as we have
it \in this country,, to life 1 itself. When
these men took up these principles which
nave made them immortal they only de
graded themselves in. the eyes of "Pope
Gregory VIII and Pope Pius, for they de
clared that liberty is the most pestilent
thing. ; y
"I put these statements of â¢ the Popes
against the priests, for the priests must be
silent while the Pope is heard. y y." *
7 "Where . are your liberties, members of
the American Protective Association?
You are not yet bound to the recognition
of the church of Rome, and to ask that the
Pope of y Rome might give you liberty.
Yet we i are called upon by the priests of
San Francisco to believe that: the 'Roman
church 7; is the -friend of liberty. They
know better, for.; they are ; all r acquainted
with the Pope's encyclicals of Rome. ;
'. "Pope Pius IX set forth the < unmistak
able stand of the church of Rome when he
speaks of .the absurd ravings in defense of
conscience. y. In 1864 he tells those who as
sert y liberty 7 of 7 conscience '; and â '; religious
worship that they are wrong, but that the
church of Rome will neither employ
no r anatheniaagainst the wrongdoers. 7," .
i "But we are not to be coerced, for we as
sert again that we believe in religious lib
erty. We say that no church of Rome has
the right to employ fprce. : lie. their

the anathemas of Rome. 7 ."â .:.
1 "They say that these Popes are dead and
f one; That 'is true. But though 7 these
opes " are : dead they . maintain the" same
position. Leo' XIII speaks 7 wit_ no un
certain sound "on the ; question - of â¢ con
science. In ; 1888, he showed clearly his
objection to that state of men's minds
which permitted that liberty of which we
spoke, and which claims the right to teach
what it pleases. â  7 L 7
"It is claimed by the Roman Catholic
church that Christ intrusted all the truths
he had to it, and that this truth can only
be learned through the voice of the church,
as if it were the only church with the
right 'to teach men. . If the son of God
should ever have commanded the people
of this world to trust the Roman church
he has â  made a mistake. This 1 say with
all due reverence. This world will" go to
perdition before it will be subservient to
the Pope of Rome.
"Our constitution leaves religion to every
man individually. Rome makes all take '
it from tne church.
"I want to say to yon, my friends, that'
we are going to do the great work of shak
ing this hierarchy as earthquake never
.nook the earth, and we are going to turn
this hierarchy upside down. â 
_ "Let Pope Leo XIII speak a sain for
Koine. His word forever settles the ques
tions, though 10,000 priests deny it. The
great hold of his church is universal suf
frage. What do you think of that? The
liberty of worship which rests upon the
principle that every man is free to profess
any religion or none. That is our princi
ple. Let us see what he says concerning
it. 'Justice and reason forbids the State
to be godless.' That is the step we have
taken, for religious liberty is unjust and
godless. '
y "Cardinal Gibbons' definition of re
ligious liberty is that a: man enjoys re
ligious liberty when he possesses the right
to worship God according to a right
conscience. What is a right conscience?
No man has a right conscience unless he is
a Roman Catholic. â¢ ' v .7' -i â â  - \
"He says also that a man enjoys re
ligious liberty whose religion is most in
harmony with God. According to this not
one of us has religious liberty, for the re
ligion most in harmony with God is
Roman Catholicism, according to the
church authorities. I don't want that
kind of liberty; I want that kind which
I enjoy to-day. . 1 7-;
"The 7 Archbishop of St. Louis , says
heresy and belief are crimes, and the per
sons guilty of these offenses are punished
as other criminals in Catholic countries.
"He further stated that the Catholic
church claimed it was in favor of religious
liberty when it was in . the minority, and
added that this was the reason why the
Catholic priests of this country were so
loyal. â¢.. ..; y
"Thomas Aquinas says that if after the
second admonition heretics remain obsti
nate, they must not only be excommuni
cated, but must be exterminated.
"The Church of Rome is always the
same. The hierarchy never changes. The
Popes have declared that they are not only
the spiritual rulers, but the rulers of
nations. The present Pope, at the Balti
more affair recently, denounced the rule of
the majority, saying that if he had the
power he would blot out this Republic,
and would place the Pope of Rome in
Washington City. They also thus reject
civil liberty.
"They make a distinction between ec
clesiastical and political power. They say,
'We never murder. We simply turn over
the heretics after excommunication to the
civil authorities, who punish them.' So
the Jews might claim they did not crucify
Christ. They did not. with their own
hands. They simply excommunicated
him and turned him over to Pilate to be
crucified.
"The Popes are against free speech, a
free press and free thought, and these
prove them to be against our liberties.
Who is making it possible for these dis
sensions to co on here in San Francisco?
Who is making it possible for us to have
liberty of speech, press and thought? Not
Pope Pius IX and Pope Leo XIII, but the

"I say to you this day that I have proved
to the satisfaction of any reasonable man
that.Rome is the enemy of religious and
civil freedom. Let the priests around the
bay blow all they please, we will silence
them by what the Pope of Rome says.
"I wonder that, knowing so many of
these things, we have borne these things
so long. It is a mystery to me how the
American people have allowed such dis
loyalty to grow and thrive in their coun
try. It is explained by the fact tbat the
Pope and the priests work in secret, and
that they have surprised us. .They have
been here a long time, and their welcome

YORK VS. YORKE.
Synopsis of a Lecture on "Revela
tion or Inspiration, Which?" '
The following lecture was delivered at
Scottish Hall last evening by Dr. J. L.
York, replying to Father Yorke in relation
to the infallibility of the Pope:
Ladies and Gentlemen: We had the pleasure
of listening to Father Yorke on last Monday
evening in his masterly defense of the Catholic
faith, and must say in truth that we were fav
orably impressed with his evident sincerity
and able defense of Christianity; and while it
is well known that we have no love for priests
or reverence for their office or calling, yet we
do respect them for their sincere belief and
earnest endeavor to maintain their honest
convictions of truth in the light of what Ro
manism considers a divine revelation.
And I have no fault to find with the logic of
Father Yorke, which from his premise or
standpoint is to my mind irrefutable, and his
deductions irrefragable. But we must not for
get that standpoint is everything in the con
ception and deductions of truth. And it mat
ters little how much honesty, sincerity and
scholarship there may be involved in the dis
cussion of any subject, if the premise assumed
be false.
And just here we take issue with Father
Yorke on his definition : of revelation and in
spiration, and the claims ol his church based
upon a so-called divine revelation. And as
Father Yorke stated, and many people hold,
that revelation and inspiration mean about
the same thing in a religious sense, the reasons
must be obvious to all .thinking minds why it
is that such extreme claims are made on the
part of Christianity and all systems of super
natural religion. . f v; 7
A true conception of what a divine revela
tion is, ana what human inspirations are and
their true source, would rid the world of much
contention, bad blood, religious monopoly
and despotism in the name of God and in the
garb of religion. â¢â  - ..:
From the standpoint of a naturalist divine
revelations and human inspirations are widely
different things and are not interchangeable
terms, and should j not be confused with each
other lest fantastic and absurd tricks be played
with, the truth. And the infallibility of the
Bible, church and Pope has grown out of a
want of discrimination as to the true nature of
the divine and what is simply human. And a
confusion of these terms has led to no end of
books, dreams, visions and false conceptions of
nature, God, heaven, hell, life, duty . and des
tiny, entitled the word of God, which, for the
most part, do not bear the stamp of divinity in
any true sense, . but rather the seal and ear
marks of human Inspiration, full of the limita
tions of frailty, passions, ignorance j and super
stitions common to all mankind. .-â â¢'.:
With this key placed in Father Yorke's hand
we ; shall hope some bright day to lead him
away from his idols out into the sunlight of
reason, to. stand face to face with , the true
revelations of the Divine in every natural
science, and in all truth, however discovered
by man , to recognize the stamp of divinity.-. ,
For ages past the world has been greatly con
cerned about the revelations of God, and from
the ancient Hindoo religion to the Mormonism
of Joseph Smith I and Brlgham Young,' and on
down to Koresh Teed and his hollow globe, all
claim to rest ;on , inspired revelation for their
divinity, and the claim for divinity in one is
quite as consistent as the other, for if we must
have a nightmare, the mental -malady: of
Joseph ! Smith is ; quite as good a nightmare as
that of any other supernatural religion.
â¢â Now, then, what is a revelation? We say a
factor facts discovered or,: revealed ,to us of
which we were before ignorant. â¢
â¢ Now what is a i divine revelation, and how
shall I know it to be divine? -
To my mind, that which is everlasting is di
vine. â  That which is omnipresent and omniac
tive is divine. These are and must be attri
butes of divinity, and with this definition of
the infinite I lookout upon the universe in
search of the divine. â¢â  And the first thing with
which we come in contact : is I matter, which is
a divine substance, because it is universal and
everlastingâ not an atom can be destroyed.
" Next is force, another divine _ thing, because
It is inhereut in matter and coexists with It.
Next, intelligence is I divine, because It is uni
versal' and . in . every thing ; in ,-, proportion to
capacity ; to , be 5 intelligent; ' from radiate â¢â  to
rock, iioax oyster to; man, fcoja man to angels,
if there be such beings; all bear that attribute
of divinity. '-,w -'â â â â  â â â 'â ;-. *'"-â .-.". .*â -.â¢;;.': â "â  'Â«'!â¢ :
;"i. Next, natural law is divine, because it is om
nlDresent and eternal; ; but permit me to note
here that natural law does not govern matter,
as human legislation and law govern man.
No, nature is infinite and complete in herself,
and a law unto ; herself, and so far as may be
known there is no power superior to nature.
: â¢". Nature being eternal had no lawgiver, and
is herself the divine and infinite: And -what
we call natural law is not the arbitrary fiat of
the gods, but simply the uniform action of
matter and force. ..." .
_ All bodies tend to the center of the earth.
Light bodies float; heavy ones sink; water
finds its level by gravitation ; fire burns; water
drowns; poison" kills, and all violations of na
ture's conditions bring adequate punishment
for every infractionâ ; ; because any of the
gods said so, but because -it cannot be other
wise in the nature -. of things. And it is be
cause that matter and force always, under
similar conditions produce similar results,
that we l call this uniform action, law â the
result of . conditionsâ and not conditions the
result of -natural; law, as some suppose but,
being a property of matter, had ' no beginning
( or lawgiver, and is eternal and divine. Now,
then, the universe, alone being infinite, is the
only divine oower which can reveal divine
truth to mankind. :
An infinite revelation is an universal revela
tion, a constant revelation, an eternal revela
tionânot something which happened 4000
years ago, but something that inhere now,
something that happened last year, and this
year, and will happen next year and through
all the years of eternity; a divine revelation,
not simply to a few Hindoos, Jews, Moham
medans and Catholic Christians, but to all
mankind. '
A divine revelation or message to man must
be addressed' to . his reason and . not to his
ignorant fears, and in no sense can salvation
be contingent on faith and belief when belief
must depend upon evidence and is not subject
to the human will. And to save my soul from
hell I cannot believe that the Christian system
is of divine origin any more than Buddhism. .
And if deity inspired men to write a rev
elation called the Bible, this book is wholly
true and God's word would be in perfect har
mony with all other truths in nature, else how
can we tell what truth is?
To say that God once spoke to somebody a
long time ago, is no revelation to us to-day.
To say that God gave over the salvation of the
world into the hands of Peter and the succeed
ing Popes is a travesty on true religion and a
source of priestcraft and theological claptrap
which has degraded the intellect of the world
in the name of God and religion.
To say that Mathew, Mark, Luke or John or
Peter, or even Jesus of Nazareth, ever held iv
his hands the salvation of the world is a mis
take, and a cruel mistake, which has held the
world in bondage to religious superstition,
and a sad reflection it Is that the old gentle
man In Rome should wield such a power over
the minds and conscience of millions of people
who seem to regard his voice as the voice of
God. Not that we deny the voice of Got! in
nature, but do deny that any particular re
ligion Is the voice of God only so far as they
utter truth/susceptible of demonstration, as
the teacher of natural science is our high priest
and the schoolhouse and college of learning
our most- holy places. ' â¢ â -
And to my mind all absolute truth, however
revealed, is a divine revelation, whether ln the
Bible or outside the Bible, and is tlv voice of
the eternal God speaking to mat.. Mathe
matics is a divine revelation because it carries
with it its own proof, and no faith is required
to stamp its divinity. ' Chemistry is a divine
revelation, because it asks no blind faith and
is susceptible of demonstration a thousand
times if you wish. Thus it is, science and
knowledge are the only divine revelations and
real saviors of the world. * So, also, art and In
vention are divine revelations, greater than
the Apocalypse of John or Dante's Inferno.
And there is not a useful art or invention but
has a moral side to it relating to our well-being
and development.
The discovery of steam -as a motor-power in
relation to civilization has been a greater force
than all the missionaries on earth.
The discovery of gunpowder, and the Krupp
and needle gun, are greater divine revelations
and have done more to stay the tide of war
among nations than all of the bibles, tracts
and testaments ever giver, to the heathen
world.
Now, a word about inspiration, and you will
see at a glance that inspiration and divine

revelation is not, as Father Yorke says, about
one and the same thing, but two widely differ
ent things.
We are told that God: inspired men. We say
nature inspires all, and all of our senses are
but so many | open I windows and channels ol
natural inspiration or inbreathing from the
material universe of which we are a part. ; And
inspiration is simply ihe impressions we take
on fromnvhat we see, hear and feel, and these
impressions may be a correct index of truth or
may not be true at all, and guide us quite
astray from the truth. And while ft divine
revelation is a discovery of ifacts and truth,hu
man inspiration at the b _t is impressions and
belief, and from human frailty and limitations
no human Inspiration can be perfect or infal
lible, and yet is a prime factor in promoting
mental and moral life even if only partly true.
For as gravitation is nature's method in stir
ring the material world, so also is inspiration
nature's method of -promoting, mental and
moral life in the world. -â¢.â¢-.>
Inspiration is simply an impulse . which ex
cites and intensifies and brings, out what is
inherent within us, but cannot create a whistle
out of a pig's tail. To ins Dire a bulldog or
tiger would only increase their cruel 'â â  power.
To inspire a donkey would not create speech or
songâ only a louder noise ' and more mulish
neis. An "inspired goose would still be noth
ing but a goose and after all do nothing but
hiss. .. â -.'--â  :./.. . â ;â -â ",'' â  â 
So it is, the quality of : human inspiration
will always depend "upon" organism, endow
ment and cultivation. And the history of in
spiration shows that to be inspired' does- not
destroy individuality, but increases the power
of the good man to .do more â  good and < the
wicked man to do worse, and as a ,. rule is in
keeping with the character and habits of the
person inspired. ' vy^^-;f, "
â¢ Inspiration is not, as some : suppose, a relig
ious word, as men are inspired on every side
and phase of life and being. The poet is in
spired with poetry, the artist with' art, the
naturalist with nature, the musician with
music, the philosopher science and the
superstitious person or saint ' with 'religion.
In fact people do not do anything real' . well
without Inspiration; and â¢ all - great leaders of
thought in letters, music, military skill, poli
tics, science and. religion- have been inspired
men. And a Newton,; Watt, Stevenson, Frank
lin, Napoleon, ' Grant, . Wesley, Beecher, How
ard, Huxley, Darwin, Jennie Lind, 5 Bradlaugh,
Ingersoll and Jesus of Nazareth, each inspired
in his : own ; way ; to 'do - his ; own Â» work,'- have
left their mark as ideals in the history of this
world. Without inspiration to "quicken ' and
stir the world of mind there could.be little
else but the dead level of stagnation': and | the
history of all inspiration in the Bible and out
side of the scriptures," from first ,to last,' shows
clearly the good- and the bad side of human
nature. Moses, David and Saul were . inspired
to acts of cruelty and .blood,; and Torquemada
of Spain to rob and kill the defenseless Jews to
promote Christianitv.fy:::'-.;^;-.: â y-y
.Jesus was inspired to acts of love i and kind
ness. 9 Peter to lie and deny his masterâ his in
spiration of bravery and love had all oozed
out when his master needed a friend, and poor
Â£f tor was hid away among I the j hired 1 : girls in
the kitchen, and crowned ; his meanness wittr
the basest action. r' x .Â«\ 'â¢â¢. -'-;* â :"â¢.:â ;;â¢: ..
â , Booth was inspired to kill Lincoln, Abraham
to Uii Isaac Â«nd Guiteftn to kill -Garfi.y. Â»nd
only shows that vengeance and hatred, as well
as knowledge, love and kindness, inspire man
kind, and the inspirations for good we I should
cultivate and cherish, while all ; inspirations
for evil we; should discourage and quench.
And while we may not be able to define fully
what inspiration is, yet we are fully convinced
that the plenary ' inspiration â¢ of the Bible, or
the Pope of Rome or any other human being,
is impossible of fact and a false claim of Chris
tianity.-: -; .--â¢â â â  .-: â â ,â â  :â :'â â â  â ...

COLONEL ROBINSON WEDS
He Forsakes His Bachelor
Friends for a Charm
ing Bride.
Miss Evelyn M. Clay Takes Him for
Her Husband in the Ad
vent Church.
Colonel T. P. Robinson broke away from
his old bachelor "companions yesterday
and from his old bachelor ways and be
came a benedict. He did' it very quietly,
although 7 several of his friends who had
heard of His intentions were present at
the ceremony and gave him and his happy
bride an enthusiastic send-off after con
gratulating them on the event.
The bride, was Miss Evelyn M. Clay, a
charming young lady who has been widely
known in society of San Francisco. 7
: Early in the afternoon the wedding was
solemnized in the church of the Advent on
Eleventh street, near Market. It was an
unpretentious ceremony. The bridesmaid
was Miss Etta Bender and the groomsman
Major H. B. Hosraer of General Warfield's
staff. The only other, close friends of the
bride and 'â  groom present were Mrs. A.
Nice, a sister of the bride, and Dr. Nice,
and they had the pleasure of seeing the
knot tied by a minister of the Episcopal
church.
x Immediately after the wedding the party,
six persons in all, drove direct to the Cliff
House. The drive out in the beautiful
afternoon was a pleasant one, so when
dinner was served at the Cliff, these happy
friends thoroughly' enjoyed the elegant
menu. While still at dinner, Colonel and
Mrs. Robinson and their guests were
agreeably ; surprised by Cassasa's band,
which serenaded them with a selection of
inspiring and appropriate music.
" Mayor Sutro called upon them from the
Heights, and was a welcome guest. He
spoke in a humorous vein, giving the
colonel and his bride some fatherly advice
upon the future. 7;
Colonel Robinson is an old favorite
among votaries of baseball and other out
door sports. When 7 baseball was at the
height of its prosperity, he was a promi
nent manager, and during the Midwinter
Fair, it was he who had full control of the
games arid amusements. His home used
to be in Oakland, but he intends to live on
this side of the bay hereafter.
STRANGLED AND ROBBED
A Young Woman Living on Mor

An Unknown Assassin Ckoked Her
With a Cloth and Escaped
Unobserved.
! May "Smith," a young woman, was
strangled last night about midnight in a
little room at 135% Morton street, near
Stockton, by some man who afterward
stole the money she had concealed in her
stocking. No noise accompanied the
crime. -â /â  . .

and there is as yet no clew to his identity.
The girl's real name is unknown. Her
people reside in this City. She lived at
330 Geary street with Jack . Smith, a man
without any occupation. She provided
for both.
The young girl was seen about 11:30
o'clock by her chum, May Howard, who
occupied 7 a room, opposite. About mid
night the Howard girl noticed; that i the
Smith girl' 8 door remained shut. 7; It was
not opened until 7 1:15 when ;L. Spines,

"It was quite frightful, I assure you,"
said Ighace Paderewski, the man of the

the rooms that had been assigned him at
the Palace Hotel.
"Imagine !" he said. "There was a man

you conceive a more awful combination?
"And I wanted a room where I might
practice I" -7. 7 77.7
"Then you are disturbed by noises when
you practice-" â¢
"No, not by noises. I don't hear noises.
But the tones of a musical instrument ap
peal to me. They come with an insist
ence that demands my attention, and to
practice I must be able to concentrate
myself."
The great artist spoke quietly. There
was even an air of diffidence in his man
ner. There was no diffidence in the manner'
of Hugo Goerlitiz, the pianist's personal
manager, â  however. . The entire clerical
force of the hotel was kept busy by him. I
till his employer's room were changed to -
a quieter quarter of the house. â 
Paderewski's private car reached the
Oakland pier shortly after 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon. '<'-''.
"lam glad we are at the end of our
trip," he remarked. â¢ .v y ' '
"Did you not find it difficult practicing
while your car was moving?" was asked.
: "Oh, practicing was impossible. The
motion of a ship is not so bad. But on a
car I have to wait sill I can stop. â¢
: "We have the car sidetracked. Then I
practice, well, about three hours and we
proceed again."
"Busy? Yes, indeed. The only time I
have for myself is after the concert is over.
And I fear that I am going to find it too
cold here to go out much. You see," he
added, "I spend the day before mv concert
in practicing and rest. Days when I have
no concert, 1 practice more."
â¢ "You were in society considerably in
New York and Boston, were you not?"
The artist smiled, and nodded an assent,
as he quietly blew forth a puff of smoke
and waveu the hand which he held his
cigarette in a way that indicated that the
matter was not of much importance.
"And you are fond of society?"
There was a very decided negative shake
of the mass of tawny hair that surmounts
the artist's head.
"No," he said. "In fact usually I would
rather be alone with my music, or in the
company of one or two congenial friends.
Those people are nothing to me. My
family are all in Europe.
Paderewski has four people in his suiteâ
a valet and three managers. He remains
in this City ten days. His trip to the West
was made entirely for financial" reasons,
though .the fame of California had made
him more eager to come. Considerable
time will be spent in ' sightseeing and
more in practicing.
The ' management has decided to give
three more recitals. They all will be mati
nees, and will be on Monday, February 17
Wednesday, February 19, and Friday
February 21. The sale of seats for these
events will begin this morning at Sher

HYDBAULIC MINING.
George Ohleyer of the State Anti-Debris
Association Gives the Views of
That Body. '
; lothe Editor of the San Francisco Callâ In
a former article written for The Call .on the
mining question the writer sought ito explain
to the distant reader, what hydraulic mining
really was. .To the uninformed all mining
where water is used is termed hydraulic, but
the hydraulic mining under review refers only
to the â¢ use of water under pressure, driven
through iron pipe and a nozzle against a bank
of earth, gravel and sand with such force as to
reduce townships in extent to flowing mud, to
vex the streams and lands of the valley. The
methods and execution were then described,
and need not be repeated here; but it ; will be
well to heed the consequences arising from the
operation, especially since the methods are
sought to be restored, behind dams if they
must, and apparently without dams If they can.
- Since it is boldly proposed 'by some of Cali
fornia's Congressmen to secure aid for this
purely private business ) from the public treas
ury of the United States, it becomes once more
a living issue, especially to those who reside
below the hydraulic mining belt.
And; since a number of restraining barriers
have been carried away within the past few
weeks, and among â¢ them - several- having the
approval of Government engineers for their
solidity and permanency, we may well be ex
cused for opposing further experimenting ;at
Government expense and valley risk.
â  That the world may know what is involved
ln tbis debris question, it shou'd go with us to
the dump, which is the lower rivers I and the
bays and harbor of San Francisco.
Â« ln ti 1880 * State Engineer William H. Hall
found and so reported to the Governor and
Legislature, that 43,546 acres of land had been
injured ana destroyed by â¢ the '* onflow of - hy
draulic mining debris in the . Sacramento
Valley. 7/_y - -â .â â¢.;â â¢-..: -.".-â¢ :. .v.-.-..
â¢ A Government commission reported to the
War Department in 1891, acreage "destroyed"
on the following three rivers: " ,
. Feather River, acres 1 ;..... ...... ....17 046
Yuba River, acres...:. :.... ..."...r.;15'200
Bear River, acres .'. ......' B*Boo
Making a total 0f....... .41 046
The above does not include the lands injured
or destroyed on the American, Cosumnes or
other southern streams. A Â©.derate estimate
-
of lands injured since the Hall report, say six
teen years, from the same cause, whether in
the past or the recent present can readily be
placed at double the above figures, or, say,"Bo,
--000 acres, but which must have been' very
much greater had its spread not been checked
by the construction of levees at enormous ex
pense to the riparian proprietors.
It will also be observed that what the State
engineer found injured the Government engi
neers found "destroyed" only a few years
later.
But the barriers against further filling raised
the water level between them, thus Increasing
the pressure against the artificial banks and
upon their alluvial foundations, through
which now percolates sufficient of the floods to
render unproductive and valueless a region
far in excess cf the original bottom lands de
stroyed .
' The United States Circuit Court in its re
view of these injuries denominated the process
as "Destructive, continuous, increasing ana
threatening to continue, increase and be still
more destructive."
And yet the . amount of debris found on the
lands bears -no sort of comparison to the
amount lying in the streams, river channels
and bays. Investigation by Government offi
cers places the amount in cubic yards at several
dundred millions, although no absolutely cor
rect estimate can be given. Yet with each
recurring examination the additions seem ap
palling. -
The following estimates are submitted as
approximations of fill in the places named
and which were mostly given in court:
San Francisco Bay, cubic yards 34,000,000
San Pablo Bay, cubic yard' 5........ 76,000,000
Carqulnez Straits, cubic yards 63,444,000
I Suisun Bay, cubic yards 67,730,000
Sacramento and Feather Rivers, below
Marysville. cubic yards 120,000,000
Yuba River and on bottom lands above
- Marysville, cubic yards 408,000,900.
Making a grand total of 709,174,000 cubic
yards of the finer refuse lying in the streams
to tax the pockets and ingenuity of Govern
ments to care for and counteract.
It is asserted that this can be done and avoid
the injury. We doubt it. When mountain
I debris reservoirs can be reduced to a grade of
j four inches to the mile, which is that of the
I Sacramento River below Sacramento city, then
it will be in order to discuss the proposition,
although the river is filling the bays on that
grade.
The above estimates were made five years
ago by a moiety of the late United States De
bris Commission. A little over a year ago the
same engineers reported as follows:
The commission has examined to some extent
the condition of the Sacramento River and of
Suisun Bay, Into which it empties, with reference
to the change of the bottom since the beginning of
hydraulic mining. Takln : Suisun Bay, the earliest
C9aat survey chart (Ringgold _ map, made ln 18501
| gives its total area as 199.327,000 square yards. -
The latent coast survey chart published (survey V
of 1878, most of the hydrography made in 18U6), '
gives the hay a superficial area of 160,882,000'
square yards.
Comparisons of similar cross sections, taken
every half-mile over this territory, gives the fol
lowing average depths: 1850, 14.05 feet; 1878.
7.92 feet: average fill, 6.13 feet.! showing that
nearly one- half the original volume of water Id the
bay was replaced by sediment between 1850 and
1878. y â ; ; .*' _ yâ* ?
Partial surveys and ; estimates made in 1885
and since leads the commission to say:_
Taking the above figures as reliable there were
deposited in Suisun Bay between 1850 and 1878
407 .000,000 cubic yards. xo ' ,
Assuming that the .ill since 1878 has bsen at the
same rate for the whole bay as that shown at the
mouth of the river the indications are that the
rate of deposit In the bay was about 10,000.000
cubic yards per year from 1878 to 1885.
Now; assuming that the flow of debris to the
bays has continued to date at the same rate
we have twenty years* flow of 10,000,000 cubic
yards, or 200,000.000 to add -to the figures
given above and of material so fine that it went
there on a grade of four inches or less to the
mile. In conclusion the commission says:
These figures, while more or less approximate.
Indicate the possible filling up of Suisun Bay and
the consequent removal of the mouth of the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin rivers from near Collins
ville to near Benicia Is a question that must be
given serious attention beforedeflnlte plans for the
cleaning out of the rivers, etc., be formulated.
Below Benicia and the Straits of Carquines
the bays widen and the debris floats to the
shallow waters on either side and is deposited '
along the Alameda and Marin County shores,
the shores pushing out toward deep water con
tinuously. . ' . , . . â  â 
â  Professor Davidson of the Coast and Geodetic
Survey was surprised to hear that the water
had receded so rapidly-, but he knew the shore
line was changing several hundred feet annu
ally. The first United States survey of the bay
was made in 1852; the secona in 1886. The
old survey marks were in places inland three
quarters of a mile in 1886, and the shallow
water had extended out almost to the river
current. He (Professor Davidson) accounted
for the filling of the land by continued settling
of mud carried from the river (Sacramento) in
solution and deposited opposite its mouth be
tween Petaluma Point and Point San Quentin.
This may suffice for our present, purpose, al
though the subject is by no means exhausted
and cannot be in the ordinary limits of a let
ter. But, it is said, the process can be prose
cuted behind barriers shorn of the injurious â 
tendency. This being also a debatable ques- â 
tion our next article will be devoted chiefly to
the so-called remedial measures.

OF ANDEAVORERS
Dr. Brown Reprimands One
of the Christian
Workers.
UPHELD BY THE PEOPLE.
Young Henry Knapp Refers In
directly to the Troubles
of the Church.
-
WITHDREW FROM THE SOCIETY.
Mrs. Brown Thinks Mrs. Cooper Should
Not Teachâ Council Will
Not Be Delayed.
The Assembly-room of the First Con
gregational Church during the regular
session of the Christian Endeavor Society
was the scene yesterday afternoon of a
lively tilt between Dr. Brown and one or
two of the younger members, the former
having all the best of it, in that he not
only carried his point, but was warmly
congratulated at the end of the session.
Attorney Nagle led the services, the
parable of the man who built his house on
the sand being selected as the topic of dis
cussion. The leader made a few remarks
appropriate to the occasion and then in
vited others to speak on the subject. Dr.
Brown said a few words fitting the lesson,
followed by young Henry Knapp.
"The lesson teaches us many things,"
he said; "none more pertinent than that
' which is to be found in our own society. 1
sometimes think that this society is built
on sand that we can never succeed as
long as there is so much dissension and
antagonism, and â "
"This society is all right, my boy,"
mildly interjected .. Dr. Brown, "it is
builded on the rock of Jesus Christ."
The unexpected interruption slightly
disconcerted young Knapp, but he man
aged to continue his remarks, in the
course of which he made ah indirect allu
sion to the troubles now agitating the
First Church.
Dr. Brown turned sharply around, say
ing: '.'Now, stop that, young man. This
is not the time nor place for that sort of
thing." -'
But young Knapp wa. not to be dis
posed of in that fashion. He said a few
words about his right to speak, when Dr.
Brown started the hymn, "Nearer, My God,
to Thee," in which three-fourths of "those
present joined. Knapp jumped to his feet
and in a voice that could bo heared above
everything else, declared that he would
never attend another meeting so long as
Dr. Brown continued a member of the so
ciety. With that he walked hastily from
the room followed by six or eight of his
friends.
At the conclusion of the hymn another
young Endeavorer secured the floor, say
ingj, among, other things that he thought
ev^ry member had a perfect right to talK
as the spirit prompted him without inter
ruption, and that he too would withdraw
from the society for the time being. . He
immediately left the room followed by two
or three of his friends.
During the young man's remarks one of
the lady members started a hymn, but
after singing a bar or so, and finding her
self alone, concluded it was best to allow
the yonns: mau to conclude his statement.
When matters had quieted down, Dr.
Brown a.am addressed the audience. He
said that he regretted the necessity which
compelled him to call the young "man to
order, but in view of the existing con
ditions of church affairs, such innuendoes
were clearly not to be borne in silence.
He loved the young manâ had baptized
him, and what he had said was meant
only in kindness and love. Mr. Nagle
also, regretted the ill-timed remarks, as he
expressed it, of Mr. Knapp, and said- that
Dr. Brown was perfectly right in calling
him to order. As presiding officer he
should have done so. He hardly thought
' the young man intended to insult the
pastor, but was simply careless as to what
he said.
At the conclusion of the meeting Dr.
Brown's friends and many who have
hitherto opposed him in Christian En
deavor affairs came forward and assured
him of their regret at the unfortunate
occurrence, and further stated that he had
done perfectly right in calling , young
Knapp to "Jtaffl^wÃ
"Dr. Brown was perfectly right in what
he "said Professor "Lloyd, who: at
tended the meeting. "Under the circum
stances he . could not have followed any
other course. The young man's remarks
were evidently directed at him. which, to
say the least, showed very poor judgment."
Professor Lloyd occupied the pulpit of
the First Church at both morning and
evening services yesterday, preaching to
large congregations. At no : time during
either service were the troubles which now
surround the church referred to. Dr.
Brown kept his promise, made at the
meeting on Wednesday night last, not to
appear in the pulpit until he was cleared
of the charges resting against him. The
pastor and his wife occupied a pew in . the
rear of the church, and, further than to
raise his voice in song, took no' part in the
services. â¢
Mrs. Cooper r was in a happy ... frame of
mind yesterday. Her bible class was even
more largely attended than on the pre
ceding Sunday, there being probably 130
presen* many of whom were strangers.
The subject for the day was the "Sermon
on the Mount." 'IH.rTfrWra^yfÃllTOÃtS^ift
"It is strange," said Mrs. Cooper, "how .-;
very appropriate tbis was to the troubles
which now surround us. It so happened
that I had the same lesson in 1887, and as
I was tired 7 and weary after v the week's
trials I concluded to use J it. There were
many notes made at that 1 time which
suited the - case perfectly, * but, - for i fear
some would misconstrue my exposition of
the subject ;; into an attack, I eliminated
the harsher passages." ...
Mrs. Cooper has up to date received 330
letters congratulating her on the firm
stand she has taken. Thirteen of , these
letters came yesterday, in one of which
reference is made to Mrs. Davidson's
earlier life. The writer says that the
woman now. in prison awaiting trial for
blackmail was of excellent family and was
always considered j an earnest, devout
Christian. When a young woman she re
ceived a blow on .the head, which for , a
time threatened not only her life but her
reason. Much of the trouble ' she â  has
brought on herself is attributed to a mind
not wholly responsible. 7 . .a-::.:* 1
One of the letters received yesterday was
from the miners of Virginia City, warmly
indorsing all that Mrs. Cooper had done. y
Mrs. Brown thinks that Mrs. Cooper
should not continue -to* teach 7 the Bible
class until her name is : cleared 'of the
charge made against her to the effect that
she forced the mother of ' three fatherless
â f uildren from her position. ' r - " â '----'"â '-'â¢ â '*?!
â * "It would be in better' taste," said Mrs.
Brown yesterday," "if Mrs. Cooper would
cease her relations with the Bible .' class
until she has cleared herself of the charges
made ~by % an; honorable woman. She ln
cists on my husband, who is accused by a'
most disreputable person, not occupying
his pulpit until lie is fully exonerated.'
She should at least bo consistent."
In explanation; of this Mrs. Cooper says ;
that Mrs. Garland, the lady referred to,
found herself too ill to attend ;. to the
duties she bad assumed, and voluntarily
handed in her resignation. She has proof
to backup this statement. 7'y :
The letters-missive authorized by the
deacons at the meeting ; of Saturday will
be sent to the ten churches selected to
form the council to-day. It is not neces
sary to submit the matter to 7 the First
Church, as the resolution introduced by
Dr. Brown at the prayer-meeting calling
for the council gave the committee full
power to act. â¢. The church has. the right,
however, to object to any of tbe churches
selected by the deacons, though it is not
considered at all probable that it will take
advantage of this.
The council is now scheduled to formally
organize February 18. The trial of Mrs.
Davidson will in all proablity be set for
hearing the preceding day. '[
There is reason to believe that Mrs. Tun
nell, whose mysterious disappearance con
stitutes one of the features of the Brow n,
Davidson scandal, has returned to this
vicinity, A call was made upon Mrs. Hor
tori, with whose mother in Tulare County
Mrs. Tunnell was reported to have a made
brief visit, but she declined to confirm the
rumor of the missing witness' return. -;. |
At the residence of Mrs. Dray, at 1041
Mission street, where Mrs. Tunnell form
erly stayed, it was stated that the proprie
tress had left early in the morning ostensi
bly to attend the funeral of a friend. She
had not returned at 11 o'clock last night

odist .preacher, yesterday afternoon in
formed the local papers by telephone that
he was going to make an attack upon them
in the evening at his church, and that he
was willing to have the public know his
attitude in thÂ© case relating to Dr. Brown.
He wanted to have the sermon get into
print.
Later he sent a verbal message that if
the papers should not print the sermon
they would prove themselves to be cow
ards.
The text which the preacher quoted in
the evening, after he had issued his decla
ration of war on the newspapers, was as
follows:
Micah v, 8: "And what doth the Lord re
quire of thee but to do justly, and to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?"
Then, when he had spoken of the re
quirement of the love of mercy. Dr. Case
began the promised attack. He said : ;
Dr. Brown has been in hell for some time
and it is evident there is no lack of devils to tor
ment him. I would quite as soon be in Dr. B. s
place as in the shoes of his tormentors. . He
may be a hypocriteâ many . of his pursuers
certainly are. They are the canting hypocrites
who ring all possible changes on , the religion
of the golden rule. They are the people who
go into ecstasies over the doctrine ot the father
hood of God and the brotherhood of man, and
who hate the creeds and profess to believe only
in the religion of love. Love? how they do
manifest it! It is Turkish love; the same sort
those benevolent Turks show to the Arme
nians. .
We send money and missionaries to Turkey
and petition Congress to intercede lor the Ar
menians. But who sends missionaries to us?
Who writes petitions for the wronged and per
secuted who dwell among us? Who pleads for
a drop of the milk of human kindness in San
Francisco? Scarcely a friendly word has been
publicly uttered for Dr. Brown. Talk about
doing to others as you would that they should
do unto you! Who does it? Talk about the
religion of humanity as opposed to Christian
ity! Where shall we look for the exemplifica
tion of the religion of humanity? y y > . -.â ;â¢'
All this seemed to the members of Dr.
Case's congregation, when the sermon was
delivered, to be an attack on Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper, or the assembled people them- !
selves, and some of the listeners began to I
get irritable, but the peacher went on :X"
In what editorial sanctum in San Francisco j
may we look for the manifestation of the spirit
of brotherly kindness?- Where shall we -look i
lor newspaper correspondents who have words |
oi sympathy and help for the accused? What
ghouls are there like the newspaper reporters,
who may be naturally kind, but who are com
pelled to be Ishmaelites in order to retain
their positions? ' They must get what they call
a {'scoop" and get ahead' of some other paper
at all cost. No matter who suffers unjustly,
no matter whose home is broken up, no matter
who goes down in the swirling waters; inno
cence, virtue, home, family and children,
these are nothing; hurl them all into the vor
tex and let them go under, for sensationalism
must be kept up. .;. .? . ... y: i _.
Rev. Cader Edwards -Davis of Oakland,
the preacher who won fame and distinc
tion by dancing in his pulpit, has said the
same thing and Mr. Davis knows because
I he employs -a newspaper reporter as his
press representative and advance agent.
Still forgetting what he had quoted
about mercy and leaving the objects of his
assault entirely out of the "brotherhood" :
Dr. Case continued: ' â¢-" ,:.>^v.v,,-
Those who talk of human brotherhood and
then rake up everything true or false, espe
cially . the false, that was ever hinted at or
suggested against a man or woman are hypo
crites of the worst kind and deserve a warm:
place. in limbo. Abraham â¢ could not have
stood such a test as that, neither could Moses,
nor David, nor Jacob. .They had all committed
sin. * Abraham and Jacob used deception,
Moses slew the Egyptian and David broke the
decalogue air to pieces. -
These things the preacher seemed to re
gard as all right for Abraham and Jacob,
who used deception; and for Moses, who
clew the Egyptian;. and for David, who
smashed the decalogue.: His criticism was
aimed only at newspaper menâ and what
ever else they may ' have - done Abraham
and Jacob and Moses and David did not
work on newspapers. â¢ , ": -.
Paul was a persecutor, and Peter a profane
man and a prevaricator, not to use a harsher
term. '", â¢" - ;-.-: .â â â¢â /'â â¢â ;â  '<X '-^"...'"'i
This, also, the preacher uttered, reviv
ing some more old scandals that the
papers would never have known about.'
Then he explained: ;'
But they repented and God forgave them,
and they became prominent in the world and
distinguished for goodness and greatness. ~;
God says to the pardoned sinner, "I will re
member your sins no more forever; I will
cast them into the depths of the sea.". But
modern journalism says, "No matter where
God casts your sins, we have got a muck-rake
and a dragnet and will. Ash* them up." They
work bravely at their task. If there are really
no black sins to fish up they are satisfied to
haul up a lot of dead fish of a species called
smelt, and all the better the more they smelt.
' The latter remark, or 'joke, would or
dinarily'have to undergo a sort of surgical
operation before being permitted to appear
in print, but that is the form in which Dr.
Case submitted it. Recalling his attitude
in the Durrant trials, before the murderer
of the two girls had been sentenced to be
hanged, the preacher said: '7'
-.-I plead for a suspension of judgment until
the case shall have been tried. I plead in the
name j of ' humanity, which in this" affair/ has
been trodden into the dust. I plead in the
name of : Justice whith has been frightfully
outraged." I plead in th! name of mercy, whic.i,
being thrust aside, weeps over "man's inhu
manity to man." ; 1 plead In the name of com
mon law, which accord, every citizen the right
of trial before his peers. I plead in ; the sacred
name of woman, whose just and noble, cause
has been seriously imperiled by the unwoman-
Uness and uncbristlikeness of .some of her
distinguished representatives. : >* -
Here, of course. Dr. Case aeain departed
from his text. He also forgot to give the
women the privilege of trial by jury, but
he was speaking -only in the assumed-in
terest of Dr. Brown. ; '";,.. â 
I take the j same position ' with â¢ reference to
Dr. Brown that I took in the Durrant case. I
said more than once from ; this platform, dur
ing Durrant's trial by newspapers, before the
trial by jury, that ; the men and" women who
were declaring that tney would lite to see the
accused torn limb from- limb were themselves
murderous in their spirit, and very likely, in
the sight of God, no better than the imprisoned
suspect. I took the position then that the ac
cused ought to have the benefit of the doubt
until he should have been proven guilty.
: ; I demand the ; same fair : treatment for Dr.
Brown. 1, He is not accused of . murder, treason
or highway robbery. 'â -. No one sues him for
damages; no one accuses him of having done
personal injury; The matter Involved -in his
case is the grave but single question : "Has he
lost his integrity as a manâ he guilty of im
morality? This Is a matter the church can de
termine*: without the harsh methods of the
editorial- inquisition. This is a matter 'affect
ing the moral character" of ; Mr. Brown. Why
all this ado over the affair? Is Mr. Brown the

only man of doubtful morality in this City?
How would the editors themselves like to have
the same searchlight thrown upon 'â¢ them as
persistently as they are pouring it upon their
victim?;* A searchlight with colored lenses to
suit the demands of the "scoop" business? f.
Does some on reply â"News paper men do not i
pretend to be models ' of virtue"? ; ; In reply I
would say, I dare" venture the "assertion- that
the greater number of , their class claim - a
higher standard of , uprightness than they
really attain unto. . â¢ ,~ ,- - .-..- >, ,
Why not make an example of one of them
and let us see what the eleuthhounds of the
inquisition can drag out of the mire and filth
of the past to smirch them (him) in the eyes of
the community. In % all probability there
might be brought out some very mean suspi
cions, Insinuations and innuendoes, to say the
least. '...'â¢;:...-.....-:,. <â¢â .-, '; - â -â  .- ...%'.-... :'- -
_It is many weeks since I have seen Dr.
Brown or had any conversation with him. He
has no more idea of imy attitude toward him
than you had when you came into this room
to-night. My sympathies are always with the
man who is being kicked after he is fallen, no
matter whether he has been knocked down or
lias slipped down.- It is inhuman to kick a
man alter he is down. i. 4^
It is high time to call a halt in this disgrace
ful persecution.' , I voice . a deep and wide
spread sentiment when I . condemn the cow
ardly practice of the sharpshooters.
1 his long, drawn-out discussion of the cur
rent scandal is not in the interest of Dr. Brown
nor his church, nor of the people, nor of pub
lic morals, but for the love of the almighty
dollar, and tne consuming ambition to have
'our paper" come out a neck ahead in the
race. It is generally only a nose ahead, for the
papers that employ the -longest-nosed report
ers succeed in putting their noses deepest into
other people's business.
Why has no one spoken a word fori Dr.
Brown? - 1 believe in him and shall continue
to do so until he is proven guilty by a properly
constituted tribunal, and I beg others to do
the same.
â  I plead in the name of public morals, which
have been corrupted and degraded by the un
warranted course of the self-constituted triers
of the accused; I plead in | the name of social
order, which by the lawlessness of unjust criti
cism is being overthrown.
It Is said in justification of the course which
I condemn, "Dr. Brown has acted very fool
ishly." Suppose we admit it. "To err is
human." He may have acted very unwisely.
What then?, Do we burn people for lack of
wisdom? If so, then adieu to editors and
preachers and nearly everybody else, for we
shall all soon go up into smoke together and
none be left to recite the burial service over
our remainsâ "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust." :
But in further justification of a doubtful
course are we told that Dr. Brown began it and
he must suffer the consequences. I would say
in reply: "Did he commit an unpardonable
sin, did he commit any sin, In causing the ar
rest of the woman Mrs. Davidson?" ..-.,. \
Mrs. Davidson has not yet been tried by
jury, but Dr. Case thus denounced her last
night, standing in his pulpit on Howard
street. And written by the preacher be
tween the lines of the type-written copy
sent to The Call is the sentence:
There is no apology for her infamy.
.7 Referring again to Dr. Brown, the
Howard-street preacher asked:
Was not his course a legal and straightfor
ward one? Because he took a legal course are
others justified in pursuing him in an illegal
manner? -
But still further it is said of Mr. Brown that
he makes enemies by his imperious and pug
nacious and arbitrary manner. Admitted;
the criticism may be perfectly just, but yoa
would not put a man in hades because he has
a fiery, choleric temper, would you? You
would have a little charity, I imagine, for one
who might have been put together with a
! somewhat different constitution from' that
with which you yourself are endowed.
But again, the question is asked: "Why did
he pay money to the woman; any fool ought
to know better than that?" â 
My answer to that question would be that if
Dr. Brown had been a deliberate { and cunning
rascal, it is probable he would have adopted
some sharp practice to have prevented the
payment of the money. But Inasmuch as he
was not skilled in the tricks and methods of
the vicious, he was more easily led to do an
unwise thing.
But suppose he did it to entrap one whom he
believes to be a fiendish foe who was seeking
his morey or his reputation, which is better
than life? Suppose he did it to get the case
into the civil court and secure the ends of jus
tice? "Very foolish to do it," you say. Yes.
probably; but does that prove him guilty.
t Would you hang a mau on such evidence as
j that?
I Are there not two constructions possible to
jbe put upon such an act? Would not common
decency require us to put the best construction
upon it, so long as the accused claims to have
acted with such motives ? â¢
A few words about the Congregational*
church as an ecclesiastical body, and the
preacher's work of disciplining the news
papers was done: -â â -* K~"-7.,.
The whole affair is a hard strain on Congre
gationalism. The weakest . point in Congre
gationalism is its judicial economy, i Of neces
sity it moves more slowly _ and more cum
brously than most other churches in cases of
administration. But give them time and they
will get at the bottom facts and will deal justly
with all concerned. .....
. It seems, unfortunately, to be assumed by
the managers of the press that the church can
not determine the moral value of Dr. Brown
without their constant and unremitting atten
tion. In this they are mistaken. The church
j will settle that matter without a whitewash.
It is true the church is not above criticism in
i this matter, tor the | spectacle of a regular
Wednesday night prayer-meeting turned into
a veritable' bedlam, as has ! been done more
j than once in this City, is enough to make
I angels veil their faces and weep for shame and
sorrow. â  '-â  " - 'â :â .-â  â â ' -â â â â â 
BODIES FROM THE SEA
The Remains of Two Unknown
Men Found Near the
Cliff.
Life-Saving Men Take One Body From
the Waves With Blocks and
Tackle.
The bodies of two unknown men were
washed up by the : ocean yesterday out
near the cliff and ocean beach. One was
discovered at the 7 foot of the Point Lobos
rocks, and the other body lay upon the
sands far down the beach.
On neither of them could be. found any
thing by which the men could be identified
last night. .
The body beneath the cliffs, was that of
a man .of /middle , age, tall, ..'ith a light
mustache and clothed in a suit of dark
checked' material. His face, bruised and
battered by the seas, was almost too badly
distorted "to admit : of' its features being
recognizable. , When y the Coroner's men
went out there to take the body .-'to- the
Morgue they had ; to l call for assistance
from the life-saving men, who, with
blocks, 7 ropes and - tackle,"' succeeded \ in
dragging the dead man up the cliffs. y The
deceased had been, to all appearances, in
the water for two or three days. He had
but 10 cents in his _ pockets. A 7; small
Masonic badge with the crescent, star and
scimitar, was found pinned to bis vest.
The other body was discovered: shortly
afterward on s the beach. It was that of a
young man of splendid physique and heav
ily built. The i dead â  man - had on a white
and blue check shirt of large pattern and a
dare bow tie and dark '_ tweed suit. His
face was clean shaven, and he . wore his
dark ; brown 7 hair 7! long 7 and 7 apparently
combed back from- a r high forehead ; ; for
despite the rough usage of the waves his
skin had a fresh color and his hair was not
torn or tangled ' badly. 7^ln* the Morgue
they said he had not been in the water
more than ten hours. *7: 'â¢"â *'.:-;'!â  7 'j ; 7 __ 7
The only property ;in . his -: pockets con
sisted of a small notebook with the names
and writing on its pages crossed out and 13
cents in coin. 7; 7 - " 7
- rA i story came i from across the Golden
Gate that a boat had capsized, and one of
its occupants got asnore, while the other
went down. It was thought that either of
those bodies came from that â  accident,'
about - 5 which ; v no % positive information
could be heard last night.
He Changed His Mind.
William Howard, an opium '; fiend, met Offi
cers Calllnan and Snowball on Sutter street
last evening and said that he wanted to be put
in jail, where he could riot T gat the drug. The
officers r called the 'i patrol wagon * and charged
Howard with being a vagrant. '& On the way to
the station the prisoner changed his mind
about being locked up and jumped from the
wagon. He ran for several blocks pursued by
Officer McGrath; Howard took refuge in the
basement of a building 'on | Polk " street," near
Van Ness avenue, and threatened to brain his
pursuer = with: a billet of kindling wood. He
was overpowered and locked up.
REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Salient Features of the Torrens
-Title ... Law of i

Conceding that realty, with a good , title
is the safest of all investments, how shall
the investor who purchases " a parcel of
land or lends his money on what he con
siders to be the security of 7 a good title,
know that his money is safe? What re
dress has he if the title prove defective
and in consequence his investment be a
bad one? Cognizant of these facts, legis
lators throughout the civilized world have
racked their % brains in their efforts jto
throw safeguards around the ownership of
land and to enact such laws arid forms in
the transfer of same as would afford proper
protection to the varied and complicated
interests concerned.
The good reports from the city of Chi
cago of a system of ; registration of titles,
recently, adopted, and the appointment by
several of the States of commissions to ex
amine into the merits' of the Torrens* land
title law in force in Australia and in some
parts of England, and from which the Illi
. nois statute originated, makes the , present
a fitting, time for a few suggestions con
cerning it.
From a lengthy paper read before the
Six-thirty Club recently, 7by Warren
Gregory, of Chickering, Thomas & Gregory,
the following excerpts are taken:
The two great systems which exist to-day in
the record of title are, first, a registration of
deeds, and, secondly, a registration of title.
It is the former which . has prevailed almost
universally in the United States from the
earliest times. *
Although the transfer of real property is
purely a local matter governed by the laws of
the State in which it is situate, nevertheless,
the general features of this system are the same
in all the States. Its sole efficiency lies in
the fact that by it is preserved a permanent
record. The record of the deed gives it no ad
ditional validity between the parties whatso
ever. The sole purpose of recording a deed is
to give notice. Thus, section 1217 of the Civil
Code of this State is "that an unrecorded in
strument is valid as between the parties thereto
and those who have notice thereof." Nor does
the transcription of the document in a special
book give it any additional validity. This is
simply a matter of convenience.
Defects in the present system are obvious.
Lord Cairns, - when introducing into Parlia I
ment a bill which I shall notice hereafter, de
clared that "the objections to a register of
deeds are so manifest that ; hardly any person
in the present day would- venture to propose
it. It would not simplify title in- the least.
It only puts on a form of record the whole of
that multitude ot deeds and conveyances of
the extent and complication of â which we
already have so much reason to complain.
You have to investigate and search as before;
in addition to that you have to pay for search
ers in the registry and also to pay in some
shape cr other the expenses of placing the
deeds upon it."
With this brief statement of a few of the rad
ical defects in the system of the registration of
deeds I pass to a discussion of the second sys
tem, viz., registration of title. In its essential
features it is practically the system introduced
in South Australia in 1858 by Sir Robert Tor
rens, but inasmuch as the details of the scheme
differ somewhat in the various attempts which
have been made to introduce it in this country
I will take as tbe basis the recent act passed in
the State of Illinois for the County of Cook. I
do this for the reason that the act introduced
in the Legislature of ! California In January of
the last year had one feature quite unlike
the Torrens system. '7 This bill passed the As
sembly at Sacramento, but was withdrawn in
the Senate. v- A- general feeling prevailed that
not enough attention nad been given to it to
enable the Senators to vote intelligently. -
The difference between a registration of a
deed and the registration of a title is funda
mental. The essential feature of the latter is
that title passes only by the entry of the trans
fer upon the official register, and not by virtue
of a deed between the parties. The title thus
transferred and . authenticated gives an in
defeasible title. The owner therefore does not
aepend upon a deed from his grantor but upon
a certificate of title issued to him by the official
registrar. It is therefore precisely : analogous
to the transfer of corporate stock or of a ship.
â  This brief statement â  would seem to be
charming in its simplicity and effectual in
operation, but the plan', by which it can be
worked out presents by no means an easy prob
lem. ' First, the method by. which land can be
brought under the system.
- In England and : Australia parties are con
trolled by. no constitutional limitation, , and
therefore have the right arbitrarily to ;. fix a
date upon which' all persons then registered
shall be admitted to be the rightful owners of
the property, or to create in the Registrar ab
solute authority to pass upon the title of every
applicant. Such a ruling is not possible in the
United States. For, if. A and B each claim a
trÂ»ct of land and A succeeds in getting his
ti ie first registered, B cannot there by be de
prived of his right to apply to the courts, for,
if so, the Registrar would have deprived him
of his property without due process of law,
contrary to the fourteenth amendment. It is,
therefore, essential, in beginning, to get over
this . constitutional ; objection. The method
adopted in Illinois is as follows: A persor de
siring to have his property registered: must
make a verified application to the Registrar
setting forth In detail the , description of his
property, whether he is married or single and
has estate in tbe land, and whether the same
be occupied or not.
Thereupon ' the Registrar, : through two ex
aminers (attorneys-at -law) authorized to be
employed by him, causes an examination to be
made of the title and as .to the truth of. the
matter set forth in the application. He makes
minute inquiry as to the possessory, right, and
posts up a notice on the property for a period
of ten days, requiring all persons who have
ai.y Interest in or claim to the laud to appear
beioi j the granting |of the certificate of title.
If it appears to the Registrar that the facts
stated in - the - application are true there Is
issued to the applicant a certificate of title, and
from that time forth the land Is within the
operation of the act. The form of the certifi
cate is somewhat as follows: â â¢â 
"John Doe of San Francisco, , aged 25 years,
unmarried, is the owner of an estate lin fee
simple in the following land, subject to the
estates, easements, incumbrances and charges
hereunder noted. "â¢ .' .
> ''Witness my hand and official seal this 20th
day of December, 1895. , , Registrar."
As soon â ' as : this certificate is granted - the
Registrar makes and publishes in a newspaper
a list of all registrations effected during the
preceding week and also posts the same in his
office. It is then provided that no person shall
commence any action for the land or assert
any interest therein adversely to the first cer
tificate unless they make known their claim to
the Registrar within five years ; after the first
' registration. }It is no ; exception l to this rule
that the person is a minor, a i lunatic or under
disability. It will be noticed that this last pro
vision attempts to l meet the constitutional ob
jection by placing the foundation of the title,
not upon any act |of the | Registrar, but upon
lapse of time. The proceeding is akin to a suit
to 5 quiet - title : brought by the" then owner
against all ' persons known â or : r unknown. A
title acquired by a decree in such action has fre
quently been declared valid by the Supreme
Courtof the United States. That the Legisla
ture has power to create this statute of limita
tions or to shorten one already existing is un
doubted. -^ ';.. w:.,v .;i.--..-..'-;- v :s : ::.. -\ Â.,-..;*
An objection may at once be here raised, that
this 'â â â¢ proceeding : would be a sort of ; hornet's
nest stirring' up all the slumbering black
mailers, who would hasten to- file' a claim on
every certificate of title issued. ; This Is proba
bly so, but it.. would have the advantage of
bringing them 'â â  to the : light, for, having., once
asserted their claim upon the register they are
compelled to bring |an | appropriate action to
assert their; claim within this \ period jof | five
years. The i machinery of the courts, would
thus be set in Â« motion and the true owner
would i have \ the . right ' to prosecute it vigor
ously to a conclusion. : i . '- . ... - -
|q Possessory title is acquired after the land;
has been once registered, and it is entirely op
tional whether it.be registered or: not,*, it is
transferred. by a surrender of E tne certificate to
the Registrar and an issuance of j a new one to
the grantee. Between the parties this may be
done by any of the recognized | modes of ; con
veyance, and I that forms a contract .between
them which may be enforced in law, but, as
stated before, its validity as a conveyance does
not exist until the certificate is Issued.*: yy
7 If the Registrar is satisfied that the supposed
grantor appears upon the register as the owner
of the land, he notes upon Che original certifi
cate the fact of the transfer, issues a duplicate
new one to the grantee, upon which shall ap
pear the volume and page in which the new
â  certificate is registered. And here the second
constitutional objection arises. r;
' y Let us suppose that A has' acquired a certifi
cate to land. 7? The action of ; the Registrar ,was
in reality erroneous in issuing this certificate;
and Bis the true owner. Both; the examiners
and the Registrar : nave made a : mistake. Be
fore B can make known bis claim A has trans
ferr ed the property to C, who of course relies
upon the certificate and takes ' absolute title.
Has B a right; to <â  proceed 'in an action at law
to set the transfer ' aside? Unless some I pro
vision - were made in :. the act â¢ for this : con
tingency, the answer must be "yes," because
otherwise the ; Registrar would | have usurped
the " functions of a judge; that is, when he pre
tends to decide as between A and 6 he is really,
exercising a judicial function, and it not being
in accordance with due process of law the pro
ceeding is a nullity. To obviate this the fol
lowing section is incorporated in the act: 7
"All dealings with the land or any estate
therein, after,? the - same : as ; been brought
under this act, and all liens, incumbrances and
charges upon the same subsequent to the first
registration thereof, shall be admitted to be
subject to the terms ot this act and to such
amendments and alterations: as may hereafter
be made. The bringing of land under this act
shall imply an agreement which ; shall â ;- run
with the land that the same shall be subject to
the terms of the act and all amendments and
all alterations thereof.", . 7
In other words, by bringing his land under
this act the j owner makes an agreement that
the ;-â  registrar, .may 7 supervise ail transfers of
title that may hereafter take place. *.~ â â -
The registrar is created an arbitrator for the
purpose of deciding those questions. It has
frequently been held that an agreement to
submit a matter, to arbitration,- as, for exam
ple, the - ordinary arbitration clause in insur
ance policies, is valid, and although this ques
tion must first be decided in the courts before
absolute safety is felt, it would seem ; to oe a
valid condition; at least such was the opinion
of the eminent . constitutional lawyers j who
passed upon the Illinois act.
.The provision extending the statute for five
years ,to minors and infants is one which has
occasioned â  much '.: difficulty. Ordinarily, of
course, the statute of limitations itself does not
run -as against a person who is under disabil
ity.' But if we were to except minors or luna
tics from the operation of this act it would be
necessary .to examine every title, for certainty
could not exist as long as there was a possi
bility of an adverse claim.
No clear starting point can be bad which
does not cut off all claimants | alike. This sec
tion was taken from the burnt record act of
Illinois," already referred to as amended in
1887, and which amendment has thus far
proved satisfactory. v . ,
The certificate granted by the Registrar Is an
absolute guarantee of title. Should the Regis
trar and his examiners make a mistake the
State is responsible. But it is urged that if A
succeeds In getting a certificate to land to which
Bis justly entitled, B may not wish to have
damages, merely, but may wish his identical
land restored.; lt may be a homestead or dwell
ing to which he is particularly attached. : To
this the answer is, the possibilities of error are

In Australia there has been created an insur
ance fund and a tax of one-fifth of 1 per cent is
levied upon every transfer for the purpose of
indemnifying the Government. This feature
has not been incorporated in the Illinois sys
tem, owing to the five-year limitation clause.
Where, as in Australia, an arbitrary time was
fixed, it was found necessary to guard against
the possibility of a mistake, but it was thought
in Illinois that the five-year clause would give
ample opportunity for adjusting every possible

The limits of this paper forbid a detailed ex
amination of all the features of the act. Once
given a conclusive starting-point, its workings
appear to be simple and perfectly feasible, and
it seems to be, in the opinion of the - best real
estate lawyers who have seen the plan in
actual operation, that there is no insurmount
able objection to the application of the system
to this State and country.
It is commonly urged that the fact that *it
has worked < remarkably well in Australia,
where the source of title is very near and where
the complications in transfers are very few, is
no argument for its adaptability to . this coun.

Lord Coleridge, late Chief Justice of England,
in 1872 in speaking of the applicability of this
system to England declared tie "had never
been able to perceive the obstacle to applying
to land the system of transfer which answered
so well when applied to shipping, but as his
learned brethren one and all had declared that
to be impossible he had become impressed
with the belief that there must be something
wrong with his intellect, as he | failed to per
ceive the impossibility. The remarkably clear
and logical paper which was read by Sir R. R.
Torrens relieved him from that painful im
pression, and the statistics of the successful
working of his system in Australia amount to
demonstration, so that the ' man who 'denies
the practicability of j applying it might as well
deny that 2 and 2 make 4." -....'.,
,_ It seems to me that with us in California the
application of the system should be particu
larly easy. ' We have had, under the control of
our Spanish land grants, a well-known instance
of an attempt 'i to form i a conclusive starting
point. by the application to the | commission of
1852. We are still a comparatively. young
State, and whatever errors j are now upon our
land- title records will be perpetuated as time
goes on. 'It is certainly a subject for considera
tion as to the advisability of a thorough study
of this question in order to impress the Legis
lature with its importance.

ftfHFRICAM NUT.
Natives Who Chew It Noted for
Muscular Development and
Ability to Endure â¢
Hardship.
UNITED STATES ARMY EXPERIMENTS
Athletes Adopting Itâ A \ Specific for
Inebrity, an Antidote for Opium
and a Remedy for Many
Human Ills.
The unbounded success which has at
tended the use of Vino Kolafra by college
athletic trainers and the beneficial results
derived from it by whole battalions of
troops on march, and the recently re
reported ; experiments made by United
States army authorities, is attracting the
attention of the leading medical scientists
of the world.
Vino Kolafra is a preparation from a nut
called steraculia (also named Kolafra), a
product of the West Indies and Africa.
This nut is the fruit of a tree which grows
from thirty to sixty feet in height. It is
of darkish hue, irregular contour and
about one-half the size of an egg. The
fresh nut is constantly carried and used by
the natives. They chew it, and the bene
fits are direct and potent. These nut
chewers are noted for their muscular devel
opment, symmetry of physique, power to
endure hardship and toil and apparent ex
emption from sickness and disease. They
are bright, active and athletic and attribute
their condition to the use of this nut. " .
This article, in the form of Vino : Kol
afra, is now extensively used in this coun
try by athletes in training and physicians
prescribe it in their treatment of patients.
It has been largely experimented with in â¢
army circles. A modified form of Kolafra,
which is exactly the I same in effect, has
been adopted by the French and German
armies as part of their marching rations,
and it is now being tried in the United
States army with the view of adopting it
for the same purpose, as, in the language
of Trainer Murphy of the New York
Athletic Club, "it is impossible to make a
man tired" while taking Kolafra, its tonic
properties being invaluable.
Dr. %A. L. Gihon, medical director
United States navy, Washington, in a de
tailed report of the action of this remedy
made to, the Naval Medical Society, says
that he "had 7 occasion to use it in the
treatment of neurasthenia." The patient
was : a lady. Her nervous system was
seriously deranged, she suffering with
excruciating headache, nausea, insomnia,
great despondency, palpitation, inter
costal neuralgia and impeifect secretions.
After treatment with quinine, arsenic,
iron, bitter tonics, guarana, etc., the
symptons were not mitigated. He then
administered a prescription made from
this nut with remarkable effect. The head
ache disappeared entirely, the appetite was
recovered, muscular vigor 7 regained and
mental dejection relieved, refreshing sleep
produced and the secretions became normal.
The remedy caused no gastric disturbance
or constipation, as had attended the prior
use of Chocolate. The remarKably satis
factory results of this case induced him
"to recommend the remedy as a nerve
stimulant and an invigorating and .waste
preventing : agent in other neurasthenic
cases. It .produced its . effects without
marked excitation of the circulation, and
consequently with no after effects of de
pression or exhaustion. It is a mental ex
hilarant, overcoming . despondency ' and
brightening the intellect without resultant
languor. It imparts tone to the muscular
apparatus and secreting organs." '
In a subsequent article Dr. Gihon reiter
ates his opinion of the therapeutic value of
this remedy, and cites the case of a physi
cian's wife, who was a sufferer from aggra
vating sick, headache, great prostration
and other nervous phenomena. The suc
cess in this case' was as pronounced as in
the one' first stated. A, few doses of the
remedy was ; followed by a speedy abate
ment and final disappearance of the cus
tomary monthly . attack of : headaches,
which had been in all previous cases ex
ceedingly persistent and intensely painful.
These are only two of the long list of
successful experiments with the article de
tailed in the leading medical journals.
Vino Kolafra is the form in which the
nut is generally used, it being most effi
cient,' more palatable and agreeable to
take. Its action on the system is that of a
powerful tonic invigorant and stimulant.
In the case of soldiers, athletes and per
' sons undergoing unusual . physical hard
ships it stimulates the heart, causing a
strong, regular pulse beat, producing an
even | stimulation of the whole muscular
system, and at the same time imparting
prolonged strength and endurance; allay- /
ing hunger, preventing all waste and
restoring energy. 7 Indeed, it may be called
Nature's own tonic and stimulant, leaving
no detrimental reaction, as in the case of
alcoholics, but generating and developing
nervous force and muscular strength *by
Nature's own methods, penetrating to
every part of the body, acting on every cell
of blood, muscle and bone tissue until all
portions are alike benefited.
As a stimulant in athletic trainihing it is
highly, recommended by M. C. Murphy,
trainer of the N. Y. A. C. and of Yale Col
lege; 7by Arthur T..Lumley, editor and
proprietor of the New York Illustrated
News, and - numerous other . athletes and
trainers. The intense thirst provoked by
athletic training is only aggravated by al
coholic stimulants. In Vino Kolafra is
found a remedy which not only allays this
thirst and alcoholic craving, but prevents
nausea, sa7 often attendant upon over
training. It maintains the equilibrium of
the heart-beat, producing free and unla
bored respiration during ; long tasks of ac
tive exercise. '.-'
The use of Vino Kalafra is also indicated
in alcoholism. Dr. James Neish of-Ja
maica says of ; the remedy: "For inebriety
it is a specific; a single fresh nut ground
up and made into paste' with .water or
spirits will cause all signs of intoxication
to ; disappear in* half an hour." It pro
duces no bad effects, causes a sense of
lightness and well being, nervous depres
sion ceases and the mental condition of
the patient is at one? changed. y It does .
not produce a habit, and the use can be
discontinued at any time. It quickens the
brain and excites the imagination. It
counteracts the effects of alcohol, opium,
etc., and . satisfies the inordinate craving
for such stimulants, producing a feeling <w
contentment and rest.
' In the recent athletic games between
our representative . athletes and those of
England the * Tritons â  acknowledged \ the
superior system of ;, training of .he Ameri
cans. An important part of, this superior
system was the > use by all our contestants
of Vino Kalafra during -training. There
suit was a long line of world record-break
ing victories for our boys. 7 .
In -the- London Practitioner Surgeon/R.
H. Firth, speaking of this : remedy, says :
"It favors increased 7 oxidation of the tis
sues, has a peculiarly stimulating action
on the nervous system, and, though not in
itself "a 5 ; food, yet} possesses qualities in
herent which 'guard, against exhaustion."
Kolafra has some properties analogous
to those of coffee, tea, etc., but its remedial
value is due to other and different power
ful principles, vastly superior in effect,
which facts point to the possibility of its
superseding tea and coffee as a table bev
erage. Its - medicinal 7 use is indicated in
ana.miÂ«, in chronic affections of a debili
tating character, in. nervous 7 troubles, in
convalescence r from severe ailments, dys
pepsia,' biliousness, : diabetes, diarrhoea,
headache, etc. As before stated, the most
convenient form for, use in any case is the
Vino Kolafra, now being 'sold by drug
gists; and which is prepared by Johnson <fc
Johnson, r92 William . street. New York,
the chemists who prepared the product for.
the Yale athletes and for the Government
authorities. E. H.

THE POLITICAL VOLCANO
it Has Burst Into Activity m
East Oakland During
the Week.
TROUBLES OF A MINISTER.
Rev. Cader Edwards Davis Is Helped
Out of Difficulties by an Anony
mous Correspondent.
â¢ .: . â â â¢ ' â -.-â¢ -^v.v--.:' 1
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. f
The past week has been an anxious one
for professional politicians. Parties are
now so broken up that in local affairs
they may be said not to exist. Although
ill the efforts of the political manipulators
ire being directed toward hoodwinking
the body politic under all sorts of flimsy
and transparent disguises it is certain that
individuals more than parties will decide
the fate of candidates who seek the favors
of the voters of Oakland and Alameda
County. Political warfare has been car
ried on so openly and the hands of oppo
nents have been so ruthlessly exposed
during the past five years that the intelli
gent voter no longer bases his decision on
the matter at issue, but judges it solely by
its advocates. And as with issues, so with
men. Let any of the element that has
been instrumental in corrupting past city
and county officials place its finger of ap
proval on any candidate and bis fate is at
once sealed. So well accepted is this
theory that even when one candidate
about whom there is a reasonable doubt
attempts to be carried into office by
hypocritical affiliations with clean men
the keen scrutiny of the public at once
weeds out the chaff and the ballots show
how correctly the ruse was detected.
For this public insight into political
working the bosses have to thank them
selves. They have been hurling boomer
angs for years, and now they have recoiled
and lie at their feet. No one knows better
than the bosses how useless it would be to
hurl them again. But while fighting
there is hope, and, as to give in would be
certain beggary the periodical shafts are
shot into the air and lost. Unlike the old
schemes, they find nothing to strike
against, because those they could kill have
learned to know their impotence.
The election of W. A. Dow to the presi
dency of the powerful Seventh Ward Re
publican Club last Friday night is signifi
cant. Mr. Dow is loudly non-partisan,
though a Republican where National prin
ciples are concerned. He succeeds Oak
land's warlike reformer, ex-Mayor George
C. Pardee. What is as significant as the
personality of the new president is the
large membership and great interest
shown in the club. The Seventh ward has
ever been the enemy of the old ring, and it
Is now apparent that it means to be more
belligerent than ever. Already an at
tempt has been made to create the impres
sion that there is likely to be a split in the
club, and that there will be much dissen
sion later on, but of course everybody
. knows the motive of such attacks. The
if -venth ward has been the cradle of what
ever purity has been born into Oakland
politics since the downfall of the notorious
"poolroom council," and nothing has
transpired to indicate that its nature has
changed. ' .
Dr. C. O. Brown is not alone in the role
of victim of anonymous letter writers.
There is a preacher in Oakland who re
ceives an anonymous letter about once a
month. It is Rev. Cader Edwards Davis of
the Christian Church. Mr. Davis is a
young man of strong personality. He
preaches and be lectures. In either role
he meets with some success. He has ap
peared before the public as "the versatile
preacher" and indeed he has earned the
distinction. For some time be posed as
"the American Oscar Wilde," but recent
history has caused Mr. Davis to blot out
that title from his placards. About a year
ago he rendered very creditably some
scenes from "Richard III" in his pulpit
and for a month he became "the actor
preacher."
About a month ago some of his enemies
said that he was given to flirting from his
study window. .Mr. Davis denied that to
reporters and friends, but he could not
find a legitimate excuse for expressing bis
views in public. Tne anonymous letter
writer came to his aid. The pastor re
ceived a communication commending him
for his pulpit excoriation of Rev. Marshal
Law for giving notice that he would not
receive ladies at the study of his church.
Mr. Davis made all possible use of the let
ter and denied in toto thai he had ever
been guilty of flirting. A little later Mr.
Davis was accused of plagiarism. This
again was a difficult rumor to attack with
out some suitable proof that it existed.
Again the anonymous writer came to his
assistance and yesterday the pastor said
he had received an unsigned letter on the
subject and that he intended to make it
the subject of a discourse.
There is one more phase of Mr. Davis'
career up to date, and it helps somewhat
to illustrate the others. About two months
ago an announcement appeared tbat the
pastor bad > received a lucrative offer
from a northern church, and . also that he
was engaged to be married to a charming
and wealthy belle of Oregon. As soon as
the news reached the north the young
lady promptly contradicted the statement,
and, of course" 1 , gallantry forbade the mm:
-: ister saying, any more than that it was a .
secret affair. When the story was pub
- lished Mr. Davis said it was unauthorized,
and, to use his exact language, said it was
the work of his "wicked brother, Gideon."
Gideon is a newspaper man, and it is openly
stated that the pastor's anonymous corre
spondent is not a stranger to hia. "wicked
brother." ' :
Had the youthful safecrackers not been
arrested till a few days later it is very
probable that one or two foolish citi
zens might have lost their lives in a
mannerthat would not have been in any
way the fault of the slayers. The order
was given that everybody seen on the
â  streets after midnight, unless known, was
to be questioned;' This was considered
. absolutely necessary . by : the 'â¢ 7 reign
.of terror - that had been inaugurated
by the burglars, y The newspapers
and the politicians had censured
, tbe Police Department, officers were
doing double duty and depredations were
being committed at the rate of four every
night. . Excitement : was at its.- highest
pitch and it would reasonably be expected
that no one at such a juncture would be
foolish and childish and play burglar with
the risk of being ; shot. Yet there t were
several such cases ' and only a display of
nerve on the part of some officers pre
sented a tragedy. A young man on San
Pablo avenue, within a block of the Gi
rard warehouse, not only refused Officer
Lill's command to stop but actually held
up a : revolver. Had Lill not recog
nized him y the youth would now be a
corpse. Sergeant. Hodgkins ordered â  a
man to stop on Franklin street and in
stead of doing so the fellow, ran off and the
sergeant had to shoot a bullet into a
board fence to induce the fool to stop.
Several other officers reported similar af
fairs to Chief Lloyd and . he thinks it very
fortunate that no fatality occurred, as the
force at that particular time was not in a
humor to be toyed with. S. W. - B. 'â . ";.

NEW FOOTBALL MANAGER
G. F. Reinhardt and F. P. Tay
lor Are in the Field for the
Berkeley Honor.
Lecture by Professor Ardleyâ

BERKELEY, Cal., Feb. The most
important university election of the year,
that of football manager, will take place
to-morrow at Berkeley. The only two
candidates for the place are G. F. Rein
hardt and Frank P. Taylor, both of the
junior class. The election promises to be
a most hotly contested one, as' both of tbe
men have a strong following, Taylor being
a member of the same Greek letter fra
ternity, as Ransome, the newly elected
captain, and .Bernhardt. a player in the
last intercollegiate. Reinhardt has also
been an assistant to Mr. Magee of the de
partment of physical culture .at the uni
versity for the past y?ar, as well as having
been associated with several college busi
ness organizations, such as the co-operative
store and the business staffs of the Blue
and Gold Berkeleyan and the University
of California Magazine. Taylor is at pres
ent one of the associate editors on the uni
versity daily.
Heretofore only those who were identi
fied with the university athletic associa
tion, membership in which consisting in
a monthly contribution toward athletics,
have been privileged to vote for football
manager, but this year franchise will
be extended to all students in the colleges
at Berkeley whose names appear on the
last official student list. Election will be
by ballot, the polls being open from 10
A. M. till 4 p. m. President . Hirst of the
athletic executive committee has ap
pointed officials for the day consisting of
Chestnut '97; Miller '97, and De Garmo
'99. There are 1252 students who are en
titled to vote at this election.
What adds great importance to the office
of football manager is the fact that there
lies in his hands the selection of the
coach, the purchase of team equipment,
the choosing of training quarters, the ar
ranging of games, the providing for the
intercollegiate match and the handling of
about $5000 in money.
H. H. Lang has served as Berkeley's
manager for the past two seasons, but
on account of the fact that he will gradu
ate in May he has declined to run for a
third term. -

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL,' MONDAY,' FEBRUARY 10, 1896.
VISITED BY HIS MOTHER
Abe Majors' Sunday in the
City Prison at Oak- \
land.
BOTH OF THE BOYS PENITENT.
Their Illusions Have Gone and Now
They Fear the Punish
ment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. J
There was a very pathetic scene in the
prison to-night. Abe Wagner was visited
as usual by his mother, and for the first
time he was moved to tears. *
Mrs. Wagner has made daily visits to
her boy ever since he was arrested, but she
has hitherto been j received with coldness
and j indifference. ; To-nieht Abe was glad
to see her, and showed it. -
The boy cried piteously and his mother
sobbed like the broken-hearted woman she
is. In her unhappy life prison gates have
played so prominent and frequent a part
that the poor woman has become used to
them.' .- _ c -Â« ,
When Officer Cnrtlss opened the door of
the cell - and ; the lad saw \ his mother he
broke down at once. The sullen demeanor
departed â¢ suddenly and * he seemed the
same boy that he was a couple of years
ago, before he fell under evil influences.
The illusions about a life of crime have
all departed from the escapades of both
Majors and WUlmore, and they now real
ize that they have to face the punishment
for their deeds. They are in 1 seuarate cells
and have not had an opportunity to con
verse with each other except in the pres
ence of an officer, but they tell exactly the
same story about things on which they are
questioned, and it is very evident that
they are telling the truth.
â  The actions of Mrs. Willmore toward
her boy differ greatly from those of Mrs.
Majors-Wagner toward Abe. Since his
arrest Burt Willmore has not seen his
mother, and neither has the mother
been to the jail to see him. He has sev
eral times, expressed surprise that she
should stay away from him. It is given
out that Mrs. Willmore is staying with
friends by the advice of her attorney, and
that the latter has promised to have her
where she can be produced at short
notice. . '..â : X.~j 7 .. .C. -77- .-.â ',â 
Mrs. Majors takes her boy little deli
cacies, and stays sometimes for over an
hour. Her joy to-day when Abe showed
that the barrier of estrangement that had
been reared between them was broken
was pitiful. It was the most solacing mo
ment she has _nown since Abe's arrest.
There are no new features to the case.
The lads will be taken before Judge Wood
to-morrow for their preliminary examina
tion. As they have confessed everything,
the proceedings will probably be very
short, and the lads will, of course, be held
to answer in the Superior Court. The case
will go before Judge Greene, who is the
Judge that passed sentence on young
Majors' father twelve years ago.
DANGERS OF YOUTH. >.
Rev. C. 11. Hobart's Discourse on Causes
of Wrong-Doing.
OAKLAND, I Cal., Feb. Rev. C. H.
Hobart, pastor of the First Baptist Church,
toot for the subject of his discourse
"Youthful Criminals." 7 His text' was 2
Sam., 18-29, "Is the young man Absalom
I safe?" During his sermon he said: .7,77
Our community has been shocked during the
past week by the discovery that a series of
crimes almost unparalleled, for audacity were
committed by a couple of beardless youths not
yet out of their teens. - The utter lack of pru
dence on the part of these burglars indicated
even before their arrest either Immense stu
pidity or supreme recklessness. Their assaults
upon the strong boxes where men are supposed
to keep valuables, at first suggested expert
criminals.
- The frequency of their attempts, involving as
it did the almost certainty of arrest at a very
early day, indicated both ignorance and inex
perience. That they were boys who had grown
up our community amid fairly healthy sur
roundings made the discovery of their crimi
nality at once a surprise and shock. Many
parents are now asking themselves the ques
tion with more than ordinary seriousness, and
I believe with real pertinency, "Is my boy
safe?" . . .
David, whose heart was full of love for
Absalom, seems not to have asked the question
till the boy was utterly .ruined. It stands the
parents of Oakland in hand evidently to ask
the question even before their boys begin to
tread the pathway in their teens. It is a fact,"
which there is no disguising, there are in
fluences at work at the present day which tend
to make criminals of youth even in very tender
years, as well as help into criminal ways many
of maturer years. who, under other circum
stances, would never become law-breakers.
Some of these causes briefly stated are: Pub
lication in our daily papers of details of crime.
One of the young men now incarcerated testi
fies to this. Unwholesome companionship is an
other prolific source of crime to the young. It
stands parents in hand to know who their chil
dren associate with. Vicious literature is an
other serious cause of crime. Like leaves of
Valombrosa fall the crime-breeding sheets in
the form of weeklies and paper-covered novels
full of moral distemper. .
The same can be said of much that appears
on the boards of some of our theaters, for most
of these present plays in which Immorality is
presented in pleasing rather than in revolting
colors. Improper home influence is the source
of much crimeâ that is, a lack of influences
positively good. ".. .'. .
In the case of Willmore most of his time at
home was in bed. He was the bread-winner
and compelled to work Sunday the same as
other days. Much youthful crime may be laid
to heredity.
Wealth unjustly acquired under the sanction
of the law leads others to say, "If it is lawful
for Gould to appropriate a railroad it cannot
be wrong for me to appropriate the contents of
one railroad ticket-office." -
Gambling is another certain precursor of
other crimes. Materialistic teachings of to
day, false teaching respecting future punish
ment, and the lack of employment. These all
carry their remedy with them, and if they were
abolished then that much would be" done
toward effecting a cure. . ,y :~-. -

IN OLD COACHING DAYS.
"Tony " Oakes' Son Recalls Mem
ories in the Life of Hay
wards' Journal.
Tells of Times When the County's
Grain Was Handled in "Prairie
Schooners."
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. J
Twenty years ago George Oakes, the son
of the boniface of State renown, "Tony"
Oakes, issued the first number of the
Haywards Journal.
Speaking of the matter, he said :
"When we first arrived in Haywards,
something like twenty-nine or thirty years
ago, we rode up on the old Alameda rail
road, that was better remembered as the
Cohen road and had a station on Watkins
street. It was a thriving little road that
carried our people and freight to Alameda
wharf and thence by steamer to San Fran
cisco. The track was laid on what is known
as Watkins street, in a direct line to San
Leandro, but when it crossed the bridge
over San Lorenzo creek, near the
Meek orchard, it cut across the road
on the Otis Hill place, and
continued on the right side of the
county road to San Leandro, then it
cut through that town and came out by
the station, and followed the roadbed to
Melrose, where it turned to the left and
preceded to Alameda, and thence to the
wharf. There was. a, station, roundhouse
and turntable, all located in tbe vicinity of
Watkins street, . beyond D. The Â station
house was built about where Scott's coal
house is now. " The 'lower' portion *of
town was the liveliest section of Hay- ;
wards. Both sides of Watkins street were
lined with business houses, saloons, etc.,
and the arrival of the stages from ; all
points of the compass, Stockton, .Warm
Springs, via Livermore, through the differ
ent towns of Washington Township, made
Haywards a booming town.
"The American Exchange Hotel, now
the Hay ward villa, was then a story-and
a-half house, and owned by the Perkins
Brothers, but was the headquarters for all
stages, and Charles , Spoerer's and Hay
wards Hotel had things pretty much their
own way- There was then no railroad
from Stockton through Livermore Valley
to Oakland, and all the grain was handled
in large "prairie . schooners" to Roberts
and Eden landings principally. Many of
the founders of Hawards are now sleeping
their last sleep, but there are quite a
number left, who no doubt often times
look back to the good old times. We had
a flouring-mill, owned by Moore & Heslep,
fronting on Watkins street, and the plaza
was occupied by Edmundson's warehouse,
except the frontage on D street, that was
sold into lots and built upon, and after
ward came a litigation and the plaza was
recovered by the town, and it has proved a
regular jonab ever since. After the -over
land line was built through this valley the
Cohen road was finally purchased by the
Central Pacific and the rails taken up.
Then we had. to travel to the present
station." -" . . :

The Niles Football Men Defeated on
X~.. the Gridiron.
HAYWARDS, Cal., Feb. 9.â The Niles
and Haywards football teams met to-day
on the grounds near the High School, and
the visitors were vanquished by a score of
12 to 0. There was some good playing shown
and the Nile's men were in good form, but
they were evidently not used to each other,
and did not work in harmony. Godel, La
Cunha, Mulverhill 7 and JF. Wells did
splendid work for the home team, - and
Carter and s Buttner -. showed to the i best
advantage for Niles. Joe Racine, the
veteran player of the Reliance team, acted
as umpire, and gave perfect satisfaction.
He says that the Niles men are better
players as individuals, than the team that
conquered them,' but that the Haywards'
boys do the best team work. -

HIGH SCHOOL THIEVING.

| VALUABLE THINGS Â« MISSING;
I Many Petty Larcenies That Are Caus
' ' ing" the Students Much ;
Annoyance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Feb. 9. J '
The thefts at the Oakland High School
still continue, arid although all manner of
efforts^ have been made to detect the
thieves no one has been caught.
For over three months petty thefts have
been reported to Principal McChesney, and
lately they have increased. A few days
ago a very valuable new fur cape, purse
and gloves _ were stolen out of the ante
room, and they have not yet been recov
ered. The owner is a pupil who has been
in the school but a few weeks. She came
from ;" Oregon, and presuming that every
body was honest left her cape where it
could be stolen. X-â  â â¢â¢â â "â â .â â  â 
Prior to this there was a theft of a start
ling . character that is being kept quiet in
the hope of capturing the thief. ' Regard
ing this particular theft nobody v. ill speak,
but the articles taken were of more than
ordinary value.
; A new system of espionage has been
adopted and some of the parties under
suspicion are being very closely watched.
It is stated that there is a detective em
ployed in the case who is acting as a pupil.
The great majority of the pupils are, of
course, attempting to find the miscreants,
but the latter must be very smart, as there
is not even a reasonable suspicion as to the
guilty parties.
It is presumed that the robbers are pu
pils, and if so they must be connected with
a "fence" somewhere, as the number of
things stolen is far too great to lead to the
supposition that they are for personal use.
The robberies have been going on for sev
eral months, and the scandalous state of
affairs is sorely perplexing the officials.
It is nqt now considered safe to leave any
thing of value at the school -or in the
dressing-rooms during school hours.
Every effort has been made to keep the
affair quiet, but there have been so many
thefts that the victims became too numer
ous for secrecy. ;
MONEY ENOUGH FOR ALL
The Mayor Hints That Auditor
Snow Talks Through
His Hat.
-
Mr. Davie Does Not See a Pessimistic
State of Affairs in Oak- ,
land.
i â¢ 'â ..-â  "â¢ -.. â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
â¢ 908 Broadway, Feb. 9. )
Much has been said recently about
Mayor Davie's position in regard to the
tax levy. Auditor Snow has made some
tables and has said some things that has
offended the Mayor, and his honor has
made the following reply:
- This tax levy is not a hard-times measure, as
Mr. Snow states, and I want tlje people to thor
oughly understand that fact. The revenue
produced is ample to carry the city along if it
is run on business principles. The figures of
the first half of the fiscal year under the dol
lar rate prove that conclusively.
Mr. Snow says that I nave saved $77,000 for
the taxpayers. Well, so I have. .He states fur
ther that the; amount might be used to good
advantage in building a crematory; in buying
and housing a new fire engine ; in repairing the
disgraceful and almost uninhabitable engine
houses; in increasing the wharf facilities: in
keeping the streets clean and filling up a few
chuck-holes: . in improving the high school
grounds; in extending the sewers to deep
water, and in giving the city better police pro
tection.-
I don't believe Mr. Snow knows what he is
talking abont. Much that he mentions has al
ready been done, and it has been paid for, too,
out of the revenue from the dollar levy. What
is the necessity of expending the.taxpayers'
money to build a crematory, when men offer
to pay the city for the privilege of disposing of
the. garbage? Would it be a- good business
proposition? â¢ â 
There is no need for another fire engine.
Oakland now has more apparatus in propor
tion to the population than any other city on
the coast. We have put a truck out in the an
nexed district, which will be more serviceable
in getting over the | hills than a steamer. As
for building an engine house, I believe that
when a city makes such, improvements they
should be of a permanent character. Brick or
stone is what they should be built of, and not
wood to fall to pieces in a few years.
Mr. Snow would do me a favor if he will tell
me where the city has any wharf facilities
that might be improved. Why. the only de
cent piece of wharf the city ever had or has is
at the foot of Franklin street, and that has
been turned over to Taylor for his coal
bunkers. â  ?t_*BpSS*s
Coming down to the matter of streets, I can
tell Mr. Snow that they have been cleaned. If
there are any chuckholes in them they did
not get there during my administration. . The
high-school grounds are being improved now,
and the sewers have been extended to deep
water, and there has been plenty of money in
the treasury to do the work.

NEW POSTOFFICE PLANS
Supervising Architect Aiken's
Statements to Colonel
Irish.
Colonel Irish Returned From Washing
. ton Yesterdayâ Mr. Aiken and
California's Representatives.
Oakland Office San Franicisco Call,)
| 908 Broadway, Feb. 9. J
Colonel John P. Irish arrived home from
Washington to-night. ? He says that the
delay in the San Francisco Postoffice has
been created solely by the people of San
Francisco, and that there is an intense
desire in the office of the supervising ar
chitect of the treasury at Washington to
proceed at once with the building.
"The supervising architect, Mr. Aiken,"
said Colonel Irish, "has not forgotten the
treatment he received from the press of
San Francisco when he was sent out here
about two years ago to inspect the Mis
sion-street site. He was treated like a
runaway thief and was lied about and
blackguarded because he would not say
that the site that I proposed was a
bog. I will say, in justice to The Call,
that this was before it passed under the
present management. -.--!â  -V-^
â¢ "There was a scheme to sell the Market
street site to the Government, as eveiybody
knows. As a result men who clamor for
public confidence published stories about
the Mission-street bog, and telegrams
were sent to the Secretary of the Treasury
telling him that the lot would not support
a big building and that a pile stuck on
end at night would sink out of sight before
morning. Of course all this retarded the
Eostoffice matter, because all these things
ad to be considered at Washington.
| The Parrott site was not accepted be
cause it was far too small. We wanted a
site of about three acres and the Mission
street site most nearly filled the bill.
"I saw Mr. Aiken and he told me that he
has seen all the California Congressmen
and Senators and has induced them to
fight for as big appropriation of immediate
availability as possible. He wants to be
gin the work and go right ahead. At the
present time there is $215,000 available.
This will not do much more than start the
work.
"Let me compare San Francisco with
Chicago. The latter city started out to
get its postoffice much later than San
Francisco, but its people all pulled to
gether. As a result they have $5,000,000 of
an appropriation and tne building is well
under way. All the delay in the San Fran
cisco Postoffice has been caused by her own
people. ; If a reasonable and honest course
had been pursued the building might now
have been well on toward completion.
"It is the intention to have the building
contain the postoffice, Federal courts,
United 7 States Marshal's office/pension
agency, United States land office, the of
fices of the Surveyor-General, railroad
postal service, postoffice inspectors, and
coast and geodetic survey, the hydro
graphic office, naval pay office, and possi
bly the army headquarters tnat are now
in the Phelan building. All these are pro
vided for in the plans, and the supervising
architect is anxious to begin work. When
all these offices are under one roof instead
of being scattered all over the City, as they
are now, it will be a great public conveni
ence, and had it not been for the contract
to which I referred, the building might
now be a reality. ,
"I was told by Architect Aiken that
Congressman . Hilborn . had been making
an earnest effort to further a public build
ing for Oakland, and Mr. Aiken said he
had . been greatly impressed with Mr.
Hilborn's argument. I think Oakland's
prospect is very bright just now. Bui this
city had better profit by San Francisco,
and not enter into any despicable fight
over the site." .
RELIGIOUS THOUGHT AND PROGRESS
An Epitome of Sermons of the Week
Throughout the Land.
Following is a summary of the principal
seimons recently delivered in the United
States and Canada by the leading clergy
men, priests, prelates, religious teachers
and professors of the Christian faith. In
every instance the full text has been care
fully read and abbreviated :
. god's MONROE DOCTRINE.
God has his own Monroe doctrine, and per
mits no infringement on his rights.â Dr.
Starr, Methodist, Richmond, Va. ' y "
IMMORTALITY.
Death does not kill. It is the gateway to im
mortality, and immortality is the crowning
step in God's province.â Rev. N. M. Waters,
Methodist, Evanston, 111.
"X: LOVE. .
X' When a man believes that God Is love and
that love is God, he is indeed born of God. The
man who loves Is all-powerful.â B. Fay
Mills, evangelist, New Haven, Conn.
*;;. - '.JUDAISM.'
Jews are not exclusive in their religion. The
synagogue is open to all, and its rites have no
mysteries to be witnessed only by the initiated.
Judaism is no secret order.â Dr. Joseph Silver
man, Hebrew, New York City, N. Y.
V ".' '. .- "77 7 TURKEY. ... '7.
Â Future generations will blush with shame,
not ' only at , the outrages . of the unspeakable
Turk but as well at the unspeakable and un
thinkable inaction of the allied powers of the
Old World.â Rev. Theodore Clifton, Congrega
tionalism Engl. wood, 111.;

Human society cannot 'succeed unless men
possess a due regard for their neighbor's good,
and the iadividual will not obtain success if
he does not know and insist upon fait God

than hope. Hope is the echo ol the soul, re

BBte^SÃÃ^/"-'": SALVATION ARMY. g|j_^gÂ§gÂ«^^
Church bells are no more divine things than
the tambourines and bass drums of â  the Salva
tion Army. One is just as good as the other,
and both are blessed in gaining the attention
of the people.â Rev. C. H. Wooiston, Baptist,
Philadelphia, Pa. 7 _;; ' -.
*' " , ."- ' "â ' ' * PARENTAGE. ' ' "â¢ â¢' * "
In dignity is recognized the attitude of the
parent to the child, as that of the judge to the
people or the ruler to his subjects, exacting
and requiring of them respect, attention and
obedience.â Rev.Father Cunningham, Catholic,
Albany, N.Y. â¢
EVIL FRUIT.
A tree is known by its fruit, and a man la
judged according to his light. Rum and bad
companions lead men to prison, and a loss of
character is the greatest misfortune a man can
have.â Tom Maslin, ex-convict, at West
chester, Pa.
UNITARIANISM.
I value Unltarianism for its absolute intel
lectual sincerityâ because it dares to think
freely and speak openly. It has no reservations
to make. It unequivocally accepts new
knowledge and stands in the liberty where
with Christ has set us free.â Rev. Samuel A.
Elliott, Unitarian, Brooklyn, N. Y. -
THE BIBLE.- '. ""
Let some Robinson Crusoe be washed ashore
among the heathen without a Bible, and
human nature would go to work, friendships
would be formed, duties would develop, society
would write their BiDles out of the heart of
their own life.â L. H. Squires, Universal
is!, Rochester, N. Y. â¢-Â« , .â¢...'.-.
CITIZENSHIP.
Politics and religion are twin brothers. They
go hand in hand, and are hardly discernible
one from the other. Tbe man who draws a
very broad line between his religion and his
politics has a very narrow view of his duty as
a citizen.â P. H. Mowry, Presbyterian,
Chester, Pa. .
BAPTISM.
Baptism Is the most necessary of all sacra
ments, for it is the grate or door of all others;
unless we first receive the sacrament of bap
tism we cannot validly receive any of the
others; without it we cannot be saved; we are
unfit for eternal glory.â Rev. Father Dwyer,
Catholic, Cleveland, Ohio. y s y :yy
prayer. . :
Prayer, as conducted in public by" the
churches, Is in direct violation of his injunc
tion that it must be in secret, and not in the
synagogue or on the streets, and that it must
be short and simple, as in the Lord's Prayer,
and not by vain repetition of words.â George
M. Coffin, Theosophist, Washington, D. C.
VEGETARIANISM.
Some people go so far that they believe dogs
and cats and oxen have immortal souls, and,
therefore, ought never to be killed. lam no
vegetarian, and cannot swallow all that bosh
that a man ought to live on wiud, pudding
and soup. Beefsteak was made to eat.â Rev.

The. ladder that Jacob saw la Christ. It

and Protestant. It is a strong ladder. For
1800 years infidels like Ingersoll have come
along with their little hatchet and haggled
away, but the ladder still stands.â Rev. Dr.
Crossley, evangelist, Halifax, N. S. â¢ ..-'â¢'.'
THE NEW JAPAN. 'â¢ .7Â»_ :
It is the anticipation of Japan to beat Eng
land in the East, and she believes the United
States to be the second strongest nation In the
world. Japan means to have an interest in
Europe. She wants to be in the world what
England has been for centuries. She will do it
if she can.â Rev. F. W. Hamilton, Universalis!,
Roxbury, Mass. ..-...-
RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS. XSXrXZ
Religion is not a matter of opinion, but of
supreme conviction. Broadly stated, for all
honest men, belief must needs follow convic
tion of truth. To be convinced of truth and
not to act upon it Is to outrage the scull, to
tamper with the moral consciousness, and to
let the moral life ebb away.â Rev. Charles E.
Murray, Wilmington. DeL
/ yy 7 y overwork.
We American people work too hard. We try
to press too many results into the allotted
hours of the day and into one short life. We
thirst for power, for advancement, prosperity,
money, and the consequence is we live too
fast. We wear ourselves out before the time.
We do not take enough rest, euough recrea
tion.âRev. John . R. Harding, Episcopalian,
N.Y. . â¢
CHILDREN.
The secret of the management of children is
love; not that foolish love that sees in them
no faults or overlooks these faults, but that
tender, watchful love which corrects them, not
in angerâ no child should ever be so punished
âbut in sorrow, sorrow the child can see, and
which will touch the heart. â Rev. Father
Came, Catholic, Richmond, Va.
. POLITICS AND RELIGION.
Carry your religion into your politics. Call
no man master but the Lord Jesus Christ. Vote
against corruption, against bribery, against
bossism, against the rum power, 'and even
though you vote alone you will not be throw
ing away, your vote. It will be registered in
the estimation of God, and some day he will
reward you openly.â Rev. E. C. Sweetzer, Meth
odist, Philadelphia, Pa.
DANCING.
The ballroom is spiritual death to the pro
fessor of religion, and only backsliders and
sinners love it. Christians lose all respect for
professors who frequent the ballroom. The
man or woman who frequents the ballroom
must keep away from the seeker of religion.
Police records show that the largest portion of
abandoned women were ruined in connection
with dancing.â Rev. J. E. Nicholas, Methodist,
Rome, N. Y. - . : : -
INGERSOLL.
Ido not know that Mr. Ingersoll will- ever
accept the divinity of - Christ as a truth, but if
he is ever converted, it will be by force of ex
amples along practical lines. Mr. Ingersoll
has been a power, because much of what ha
says is trueâ and the people know it. We will
never win him by abuse. His burning words
have made even the clergy think.â Rev. John
Rusk, Chicago.
THE SALOON. . â¢',"Â«. 7. .;
. The saloon is the focus of all that Is evil.
Any definition and description of the saloon
must be an indictment. It is the enemy of
mankind, the enemy of the home, the enemy
of the state, the last ditch of municipal mis
rule and the enemy _f the church, ft builds
an impassable barrier between man and hia
God, filling his heart with hatred for things
good and pure.â Rev. A. C. Ellis, Methodist
Oil City, Pa.
METHODISM. *
Methodism stands out pre-eminent as having
silenced the barbarous doctrines of Calvinism,
and the world owes them gratitude. Tho
Calvinist preached that it had been pre
determined by God that so many souls were to
be.avea and so many were to go to perdition.
It was the Methodists that came out with the
democratic and universal policy that pro
vision had been made for all. If Methodism
has not saved a soul it has silenced the guns of
Calvinism and has thereby done a noble work.â
Rev. N. F. Dickerman, Universalist. New Haven,
Conn. .â â¢'.- y;'c;v>-.:.
CONVENTIONALITY.
Family life, is easily destroyed by undue
familiarity, a fact sadly established by the con
dition of homes all of whose members are
herded together in a single room, all barriers
being cast down. There may easily be undue
familiarity in homes ol many rooms. It may
be between husband and wife," between parent's '
and children, and this undue familiarity may
be as ruinous as. that which is from the ab
sence of partition walls. . Familiarity, is de
structive of that which in feeling Is most
delicate and most precious. .We want con
ventionalities in our home life that the life ot
the home may be protected and may be made
fairer and richer.â Rev. Dr. Jenkins, Baptist,
Portland, Me.

flowers decorated the apartments in which
the youngsters played games, danced and
otherwise enjoyed themselves.
At 6 o'clock the "party" began in ear
nest and the little ones partook of a
supper that abounded in "goodies" and
everything the infant heart rejoices in. It
was about 10 o'clock before nurses induced
their charges to leave, the merry scene,
and each little . one departed bearing a
pretty souvenir of the occasion.
On Saturday Mrs. Maurice Rothchild
gave the third of a series of luncheons at
her home, corner of Broadway and Frank
lin street. An elaborate menu was served at a
handsomely decorated table. Covers were
laid for twelve. . .

street, near Post, was dedicated yesterday
afternoon by the grand officers of the
order in the presence of a large number of
people.
The dedication was made the occasion
for elaborate exercises and ceremonies and
for mutual congratulations among mem
bers of the Native Sons and their hosts of
friends who were present. Nothing but
expressions of admiration were heard on
all sides as the guests passed through the
spacious hails and rooms or when the first
view of the assembly hall was had. Be
fore the hour marking the beginning of
the exercises arrived every seat in the
auditorium was occupied, and hundreds
of visitors were compelled to stand. 7

of course, had their place, but the softer
tint, tempered the effect pleasantly. The
stage was draped from the great depressed
arch on either side with tricolor bunting
that fell in folds over the center where
space was found for a stand of American
flags behind a National shield, and over all
the blue in this drapery were golden stars
that gleamed in the electric lights. This,
with a mass of palms beneath, formed the
frame for the curtain presented by James
D. Phelan â powerful painting "showing

nfts of grass amid patches of brown rocks

Francisco is beyond in its fascinating haze
of distance and smoke with the sun touch
ing its hills and the blue bay betweenâ
a picture often seen from the decks of ferry,
steamersâ and still farther off is the Golden
Gate.
The balustrade of the galleries was
draped in a festoon effect with cream and
pink cloth, caught up occasionally with
National flags and shields. From the
center of the ceiling streamers of different
hues were hung and woven, some to meet
in knots and others carried around to â â  the
walls high up.
On the main floor chairs were arranged
after the manner of a lodgeroom, with
three grand officers' chairs and altars in
their, respective â¢ positions. " Each grand
officer had a colored light opposite him,
while a lamp covered with red, white and
blue stood upon the grand president's desk
on the stage.
The programme opened with an overture,

the grand officers, past grand officers of the
order and participants in the ' ceremonies
came upon the stage. Presently several
little girls in white, carrying silk flags and
wearing ' poppy-colored badges," J entered
and were placed in the front row of chairs,
where they gave an element of picturesque
ness to the group. A selection of popular
songs, arranged by Charles H. Cassasa,
was tendered by the orchestra with splen
did effect that was appreciated by the
large gathering.
A selection, " '49," by Leila France, was
played by the orchestra, as an appropriate
feature of the musical programme, and at
its close James D. Phelan, president of the
Hall Association, delivered an address.
He said: ' _ . , '
Ladles and Gentlemen: We are here to-day to
dedicate the new hall of the Native Sons. The
chief stone of the corner was laid on Washing
ton. Birthday of last year, and for eleven
months the mind of the designer and the arm
of the mechanic nave been tireless in making
ready for this day. You now behold the le
sulls'of their work. Your committees, intelli- i
gent and vigilant, have borne their share of
the burden, and the grana and subordinate
parlors and the members, who own almost ex
clusively the stock of the corporation, have
cheerfully resoonded to the demands made
upon them.
This temple Is a monument to the enthu
siasm, the self-sacrifice and tne State pride of
the young men of California. I wish to bear
testimony to the fact that deep and well are
the foundations laid, strong is the masonry
and bold and inflexible are the spans of steel
upholding the superstructure, and that wher
ever it has been possible the building is the |
product of native talent, California material |
and home manufacture. It speaks for Cali
fornia, and may the strength, cohesiveness
and enterprise here displayed be forever j
emblematic of the order itself, which now, >
under its own roof- is already feeling the j
quickening impulse of greater growth, indulg- j
ing the pardonable pride of ownership and en- !
joying that feeling of security, permanency |
arid patriotic fervor which comes to the citizen J
so strongly in his own home and by his own
fireside.
This order has many friends to rejoice in its
success, because it is not narrowly exclusive:
Every Californian is eligible to membership
either by birth or by representationâ his
children are his best representatives. When
the American flag was raised , by Commodore
Sloat at Monterey there was no native popula
tion of American parentage, but history will
record that fifty years after that momentous
eventâ for. this year is the semi-centennial an
niversary of the raising of the flagâ a native

population had numerously and proudly
grown in the land; that many of them were
banded together in; a fraternal organization
which had erected a monumental hall for their
order, and that, in spite of ' the selfish pursuits
of a great metropolis which had sprung up in
the cove of ' Verba Buena as irom the stroke of
a magician's wand, they ware not forgetful in
their prosperity of the pioneers, the heroes and
the statesmen who had given the thirty-first
starâ and the most resplendent of them allâ to
the glorious banner of the Union of States. yX.
To-day. the native population is limited; in
fifty years from now it will have | covered , the
country, and this has led some commentators
to observe that there will ultimately be noth
ing distinctive in the Native Son as such. .'Per
haps this is true; but, as the.order does not de
pend of such a distinction, its purposes being
to perpetuate the history of the . State and ad
vance its interests and cultivate fraternity

charity and benevolence among its members,
it follows that, these purposes remaining, im
mutable, its usefulness increases with its con
stantly expanding membership. It is, and will
become in a greater degree, a patriotic society
of the sons of the soil, bound firmly together
by the strongest of all sentimentsâ the love of
native land.
California! a word, indeed, by which to con
jure, is its Inspiration. So beautiful a mother
should not want lor devoted sons, organized
and strong, to strive for her welfare, defend
her honor and glory in her greatness.
What society,! ask, has had a noDler reason
for existence than one which combines charity
with patriotism? If there bo a man so
thoughtless as to deprecate the movement,
undervalue its objects or cavil at the en
thusiasm of youth, or to think himself suffi
cient without organization, then he ignores
the lessons of the past, the instinct of country
and the spirit of the age.
- When Pitt was taunted by Horace Walpole
with "the crime of being a young man" he
said, in reply to his elder, that he hoped he
might be one, of those whose folly ceased
with his youth, and not of that number who
remained Ignorant in spite of experience. .
The organization of young men gives them
the courage of companionship, and, by.-main
taining libraries and ;by observation and dis
cussion, they arc taught the experience of
others. Youth: is always ingenious and lair,
charitable- and '. hopeful, and organization
makes these characteristics effective.' Thus
the morning of lifeâ most beautiful sea
sonâis not suffered to slip away without use
fulness. .Theirs will not be the vain regret of
expiring and disappointed age, which' has
often exclaimed, but, alasl too late, "Oh, give
me back my youth!',' : . ; '
Such societies as ours, with their fraternal
and benevolent objects, should have the sup
port of ail good men. Against misfortune and
thriftlessness they guard the widow and the
orphan ; â¢ the sick have their solicitude and
support; the dead the last tribute of affection
and respect. Such purposes -urge men out of
the channels of ' selfishness into, the ocean of
brotherhood and humanity, through whose

medium a ceaseless Interchange of kindly of
fices go on. â¢â¢
Thus the battle against the impotence of the
individual, the aimless mission 'of mobs, the
dangers and barbarisms of city life, is fought
and won, and vast aggregations of population,
at first feared, become ; the instruments of
good. Men are brought in contact, are checked
and restrained by human respect, are elevated
by worthy employment, and; friendshipâ "the
sweetener of life and the solder of - society"
finds a congenial soil. --.

- In the name of, and in behalf of the Native
Sons of the Golden 7 West, I accept, for dedica
tion to the uses of our order/ this _ hall, which
has been constructed under your . supervision,
To you and your associates the occasion must
be gratifying. To-day " you = witness ; the con
summation of that for which you * have zeal
ously - and' faithfully labored/and to-day you
behold the recognition of this noble edifice de
voted to the service of those whose mission it
is to visit the sick, relieve . the â¦ distressed and
bury the | dead, with the kindliest I offices lof
humane spirits. -; I congratulate you upon the
completion of this beautiful hall which we are
about to dedicate -, to those- virtues j which are
â  the foundation of our organization. Beneath
this roof you are to encourage one another in
the duties of benevolence and chanty; before
.these altars the good words of friendship' and
loyalty are ever to be presented as the only ac
ceptable; sacrifices. â¢ Hence as from a per
ennial fountain are to flow the gentle . streams
of true j friendship to gladden - many â 'loyal
iicflrts.
An eloquent prayer was pronounced â by
John D. Sproul, past grand president, and
this was followed by all singing "Hail
Columbia." y
V Grand Vice-President Henry C. Gesford
then delivered his charge, in ': which he
said
True friendship is one. of the noblest attri
butes of the human heart. The offspring of
generous impulses, it broadens the sphere of
man's capabilities for good wherever it finds
an abiding place, whether amid the splendor of
the palace or the squalor of, the hovel: and
amid the pomp and power of exalted station,
as well as among the hewers of wood: and
drawers of water," it inspires" to loftier senti
ments and stimulates to nobler deeds. It is
unselfish in its relations and, whether emanat
ing from the heart of the prince or tbe peas
ant, it recognizes true woith as the only pass
port to distinction. Free from the more vio
lent-attributes of love, it is unalloyed ' by
passion and unmixed with jealous prejudice
It endures through sunshine and shadow and
forms an everlasting tie of friendship between
man and man. ...--,. ..-,.,.
It was this character of friendship which
united ; and < animated the pioneers as they
plowed the trackless seas or traversed un
known lands to lay the foundation stones of
this great civilization. They toiled â¢ and suf
fered and conquered, and the potent imnulse
springing from the memory of their deeds,
their sacrifices and their triumphs has gath
ered together in the halls of friendship the
sons of California, who around the shrine of
their memory join hands in fraternal friend
ship and. forever pledge fidelity to the virtues
of the men of '49. " Â
Let us, then, dedicate this beautiful temple
to friendshipâ a- friendship -as pure and un
selfish, as fervent and everlasting as.charac
terized our fathers; a friendship which, far
down into the coming years, will : crowd the
rooms and halls of this proud edifice with mul
titudes of Native Sous of the Golden West, as
through 'its sacred portals they come and go
on errands of humanity. .
The "Star-Spangled Banner" was sung
by Miss Mir Kino, a Native Daughter,
who waved the American flag and aroused
the patriotic enthusiasm of all present.
Grand Marshal Lewis F. Byington read
his charge, which dealt with "Loyalty."
He said: . V .- . *^-- - .
There is one distinctive feature which marks
a difference between this and other fraternal
societies, and that is that the , principle of loy
alty to the State of California pervades every
feature of our work, our precepts and our laws.
There : are, perhaps, orders with as much of
friendship, charity and humanity; but there is
none other whose destiny is linked with the
fate of California, whose virtues symbolize the
historic grandeur of , our native land, and
whose inward pulse transmits its.patriotism.to
the heart of the commonwealth. There may
be orders founded upon the beauties of the tra
ditions of centuries ago, but our threads of life
are interwoven with the history and destiny of
our country, and the virtues we cherish are il
lustrated by the lives of the patriots who laid
the corner-stone of this great civilization. If
we are good citizens we will make good Native
Sons, and if we are true Native Sons we cannot
help being good citizens of the State. X'Hl
The initiation ode of. the order was sung
by the Native Daughters' ffhoral society,
after which Past Grand President Sproul
gave his charge on charity.
"One the purposes of this order is to
extend to all its members the hand of
charity;" he said. "In the hour of afflic
tion, when the heart mourns the beloved
and the mantle of gloom is thrown around
us, charity and sympathy go from this
place to mingle themselves with your be
reavement and wipe away the tears of dis
tress. - When the lost ones are taken away
to the. silent grave, charity will return to
take you by the hand and lead your soul
back through tbe aisles of peace and com
fort, where recollection may prove a fond
ness and a blessing and not a torture of the
human mind upon the rack of memory."
This was followed by the singing" of
"America" by the Native Daughters, and
Grand President Dunne spoke about Cali
fornia, outlining her history, and saying
regarding his order: "We have united to
gether in this fraternity in order that we
may accomplish good. Singly, our offorts
would have gained us but little.. But held
together by the hands of our fraternal
principles, under the banner of Native
Sons of the Golden West, we can, if we but
will/exert an influence for the greatest
good upon our native State and country,
See to it, then, that the influence of fra
ternity is always on the side of friendship,
loyalty and charity.'.' ': â 'â¢'/â : : ,
. "Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," was
given by the Choral Society at the close of
this address.- Then the grand officers for
mally and in- solemn words declared the
hall dedicated "to the business and pur
poses of the Native Sons ' of the â  Golden
West; ;to the dissemination of the senti
ments of J friendship and. loyalty, to the
diffusion of charity ' among j ; all . its mem
bers." *
7 This was ; followed by the singing of
"Home, Sweet Home," and the ceremonies
were brought to a close with a prayer by
the past grand president. -'â 'â  ;.*
.Mr. Phelan, on behalf of the Hall Asso
ciation, presented Secretary Adolph Â£ber
hardtwith a gold watch, suitably inscribed,
as a token of appreciation for Mr. Eber

ington, in a few words, presented Mr.
Phelan with a gold plate bearing a picture
of the * building and an inscription
stating that the souvenir was from the
hall directors. .-. , I?--7v ; _-v*-s.?'
