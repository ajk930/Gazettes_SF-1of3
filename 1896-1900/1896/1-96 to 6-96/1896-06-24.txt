VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 24.
DESPERATION OF DEMOCRACY
Must Down the Doctrine
Established by Grover
Cleveland.
SO SAYS GOV. ALTGELD
AT PEORIA.
Reptfclicans and Gold Advocates
Assailed in the Illinois
Convention.
BIMETALLISM IS DEMANDED
BY ITS ADVOCATES.
But the Sentiment of the Sucker State
Is Not Unanimous in Wisconsin,
Ohio, Indiana and Texas.
PEORIA, 111., June 23.â These are the '
principal planks of the platform adopted i
this evening by the Democratic State Con- ;
vention, which met here to-day:
We favor the soundest and safest money 1
known to man, and as experience has shown |
that this consists of both gold and silver, with
equal rights of coinage and full legal tender
power, we demand the repeal of that Republi
can and plutocratic legislation which de
monetized silver and reduced it to the basis
of token money, destroying by half the stock
of real money, and by doubling the work to be
done by gold doubled its purchasing power so
that the farmers and producers had to give
twice as much work to get a dollar as they
formerly had, and found it hard to meet their ;
debts, interest, taxes and fixed charges, which
were not lowered. In this way the market for !
those things which the mechanic and laborer
made was destroyed, and the factories had to
Ehut down.
But by this taking out of the commercial '
world one half of its blood, industry and trade i
have been paralyzed and idleness and misery
spread over the. civilized world. With richest ;
natural resources, with a most industrious,
frugal and enterprising population, and with
the most Abundant harvest.-, our people are !
in distress. Three per cent of our population ;
own over half the wealth of this Republic j
and almost the only men who prosper are the '
bond sharks and the men who fatten off the
misery of their country. These are conditions ,
under which republican institutions cannot
long endure.
We believe in the greatness and patriotism,
of the American people; in their energy, in
dustry and thrift; and that such a people,
with the unlimited resources of our land, are
strong enough to sustain a monetary system
without the aid of foreign governments. We
believe the benefits of the independence which ;
ire frÂ«inÂ«d Â« hundred rears ago â the - war for j
which was initiated upon a matter of tribute
should not be lost by yielding vassalage, to a
monetary system preferred by other govern- j
ments.
We believe bimetalliism, which has dove the I
Horacs Boies of lowa, Who Will Be Backed by Many Silver Democrats of the East for the
Presidential Nomination.
The San Francisco Call.
j work of the world since the dawn of civiliza
tion, and wuich was made the basis of the
monetary system by Hamilton and Jefferson,
is absolutely necessary at piesent to the pros
perity of mankind and ihnt its re-establish
ment will check the present business paralysis,
will give to the country a saie and honest cur
rency of adequate volume, will restore prices
of agricultural commodities, will encourage
enterprise and give onr people steady and prof
j itable employment. Having learned through
i bitter experience that Wall street has con-
I trolled the financial legislation at Washington,
; mill knowing that every <.'ffort will be made to
J defeat the will of the people, we deem it pioper
to be explicit in our declarations.
Actuated by the foregoing principles and
â¢ desiring the prosperity of the people, we de
! mand the immediate restoration of the free
! and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver
a> standard money at the ratio of Hi ounces of
silver to 1 ounce of god, of equal fineness,
with full leeal ten ter power to >?ach metal,
without waiting for or depending on any
other nation on earth; and the delegates from
! this convention to the National Democratic
Convention are instructed to use all honorable
means to secure a similar declaration by said
' National Convention and to support only such
men for the Presidency as are in full and pro
nounced sympathy with these principles.
We are also opposed to the contraction of the
I currency by the retirement of any part of the
! present outstanding treasury notes.
We favor a tariff for revenue only, and de
clare that the Government should collect no
more taxes than are necessary to defray the
j expenses of the Government, honestly and
i economically administered.
We are unalterably opposed to the revival of
any such monstrosity in legislation as th,atact
of Congress which was known as the McKin
ley law, which for the fiscal year ending June
â  3u, 1894, produced a deficit in the United
States treasury of $70,000,000, uuder which
wages were greatly lowered, and which gave
, proprietors a monopoly, while it permitted
them to fill their shops with the cheapest kind
! of cheap labor, brought from all parts of the
: earth.
We demand the abolition of government by
injunction, that new form of oppression and
weapon of the money power never Detore heard
of among men, whereby a Federal Judge at
; once became a legislator. Judge and executor.
It i.Â« absolutely destructive ol republican in
stitutions; it robs the American people of the
right of trial by jury and of hII the protection
by the constitution. The arbitrary interfer
ence on the part Of the Federal Government
in local affairs by ignoring lawful authorities
'â  is not only a violation of the constitution of
i the United States, but a crime against free
! government, aud is destructive of the very
'â¢ foundations of democratic and republican in
stitutl
We call attention to the fact that the Ka
| tional Republican Convention, recently in ses-
Bioa at St. Louis, was absolutely dominated by
; those men who devour the substance of others,
' and by those influences which have been so
prolific of corruption in all branches of the
j public service. That convention yielded to
the iron hand of the barons of monopoly and
nominated as President the author of the most
iniquitous tariff bill ever enacted, and, bowing
down to the money power, declared in favor
oi a single gold standard.
We favor an amendment to the Federal con-
I stitution permitting the levying and collect
j ing of an income tOK.
The delegates from this convention to the
| National Democratic Convention are In
structed to support only snch men for trie
Presidency as are In full and pronounced
| sympathy with the declarations of this plat

There were in the neighborhood of seven
thousand delegates and visitors in attend
ance when State Chairman Hinrichson
called the State Democratic Convention to
order in the immense Tabernacle, which
was crowded to the doors with visitors,
anxious to witness the successful culmina
tion of the effort to commit the Demo
cracy of Illinois to the free silver creedâ a
policy which was inaugurated in a special
convention of the party held at Springfield
over a year ago for the consideration of
the financial question. The thoroughness
with which the silver legions have swept
the State may be judged from the fact that
less than fifty "sound money" delegates
have seats in the convention.
The usual committees were appointed
by the convention at its initial session to
day, and although the body has not as yet
formally committed itself, it is a foregone
conclusion that free silver resolutions will
be adopted and free silver candidates
selected to the National Convention.
Alexander Hamilton Bell of Uarlinville,
the temporary, chairman, spoke as follows:

"WE ARE GOING TO
CARRY CALIFORNIA,"
Samuel M. Shortridge and John
D. Spreckels Predict Re
publican Success.
PROTECTION THE FIRST ISSUE.
When Prosperity Is R turned the
Money Question Will Soon
Be S ived.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 23.â Two j
I prominent Republicans from the Pacific j
Slope are at the Hoffman House. They j
â  are John D. Spreckels, member of the Re- i
publican National Committee, from San j
Francisco, and Samue! M. Shortridge of '
| the same State. Sho-tr'dge is one of the;
'. jounger mÃn :n the Ko publican party i.i :
I the far West and is an aggressive fighter. |
j He is a candidate for the United States |
j Senate and many of his friends think he
i will succeed Senator Perkins.
"We are going to carry California for
the Republican narty upon the platform
adopted at St. Louis, 1 ' said Shortridge yis
terday. "In our State Convention we de- [
dared for MeKiniey and free coinage. We
got McKinley at St. Louis, bat we did not
get free coinage. Half a loal is better than
no bread and we are going to take off our j
coats to fight for the ticket, and while it â¢
may be a tremendous fight, yet I think I
can say confidently that the State will go
Republican.
"Protection ia the great issue. Califor
nia is not a silver-producing State. Her
mines are gold n>ines, but. her great indus
try, the one that employs more men than
all others, is agriculture. California is for
i free silver, perhaps, first, on account of
| sympathy with other neiehboring States;
| second, she is for free silver because she
i believes that free coinage will do much to
j mitigate the ills that the country has suf
! fered.
"I contend, and I believe tnat I am
right, that the proper solution of the
money question is through protection.
What we want to do first is to start the
mills going and open the workshops that
are now closed. After we once have em
ployment for the time then it is time to
talk about the dollar they earn. I believe
that McKinley will be elected."
John D. Spreckels. who defeated M. H.
de Young for the place on the National
Committee, is also confident that the Re
publican party will carry California. He
says that protection means more to the
people of California than free coinage
does and that he thinks they wiil fight it
out for protection first and then keep on
the battle for an international bimetallic
agreement. Both he and Mr. Shortridge
think that such an agreement is to be
effected some day.
Senator Squire of Washington came to
the Fifth Avenue Hotel yesterday. The
Senator is from a free coinage State and
he was thoughtful when asked about the
situation. He professed a wish not to en
ter into details of the situation, but did
say that he, as a Republican, would sup
port McKinley and Hobart. He believed
bis State would remain within the Repub
lican column.
HANNA VISITS McKINLEY.
Members of the Notification Com
mittee Will Wait Upon the Stand
ard-Bearer Next Monday.
CANTON, Ohio, June 23.â Major Me-
Kinley met his famous manager, Mr.
Hanna,ve?terday for the first time since the
triumphant conclusion of his labors of the
past six months at St. Louis last Thurs
day. Tnere was nothing theatrical nor
demonstrative about it, neither of the
gentlemen being inclined to exhibit emo
tion even under the most trying condi
tions.
Mr. Hanna came down on the Valley
Railroad in his private car, accompanied
by Mrs. Hanna, Hon. Henry Clay Evans
of Chattanooga, Term., Mr. Hobart's most
formidable opponent for the second place
on the ticket nominated at St. Louis;
Colonel and Mrs. Fred D. Grant of New
York; W. M. Osborne, a cousin of the
major's and ex-Police Commissioner of
Boston, and Mewsrs. Myron T. Herrick and
Sylvester Everett of Cleveland.
Major McKinley was- at the station and
he met his guests in the car. The greet
ing to and from Mr. Hanna was marked
with a cordial grasp of the bands. The
major said, "I am glad to see you," and
Mr. Hanna responded, "Major, I am glad
to see you." Alighting, Major McKin
ley took Mrs. Hanna, Mrs. Grant and Mrs.
Evans with him in the family carriage,
and, drawn by the staid old white horse,
they proceeded sedately and securely to
the house. The gentlemen utilized public
conveyances.
Mr. Evans was his usual frank, enter
taining self, and responded readily to the
suggestion of an interview.
"What do you think of the ticket now
that it does not include the name of
Evans?" he was asked.
"I think it is a first-rate combination,"
was his hearty answer, "and a sure win
ner. It will go well in our part of the
country."
"Is there any chance for carrying Ten
nessee? 1 '
"Indeed there is; much more than a
fighting chance, too. Our Governorship
contest will give us votes. The Democrats
nominated Bob Taylor as the only man
they could possibly elect. He served two
terms and made a very popular Governor.
He cannot point to a single measure in
augurated during his four years' adminis
tration which benefited the people in the
least, while we can specify several abuses
which oric mated in that period. Possibly
the worst of these is what is known as
'the county back-tax attorney' law. That j
provides for the appointment of an attor- j
ney, 07 one ?o-caJled -t ieast, in each
of the ninety-six counties of the State,
who are authorized to institute suit for
the recovery of unpaid back taxes. It has
proved to be a very burdensome law. In I
Shelby County, where the nephev; of Sen- j
ator Harris was appointed, the fees of the i
attorney this year, I am told, will amount j
to over $50,000."
After lunch Mr. Hanna came out on the !
porch with the other visitors and chatted
most affably with the newspaper men who
made that their cam pins place.
"Anything important bring you down
here to-day?" was asked Mr. Hanna by
the United Press representative.
"No, I can't say there was," he replied.
"I returned from the convention only j
j Saturday and naturally wanted to see |
Major McKinley at the first convenient
opportunity. That was to-day."
"What about the committee on notifica
tion?"
"The members will gather in Cleveland
I and leave there by special train next Mon
! day morning for Canton, returning later
in the day. The speeches will be made
early, so that the ceremony can be con
cluded by lunch."
HENRY OF NAVARRE, AUGUST BEIMONT'S KING OF THE AMERICAN TURF.
At SheeFshcad Bay yesterday this great thoroughbred won the thirteenth Suburban handicap,
with Griffin up and carrying top weight. He is conceded by all good judges to be the peer of any
horse that ever won this historic event.
BOIES OR BLAND WILL LEAD,
"Have yon selected the members of the
executive committee^?" *'
"I cannot say that the selections are all
made, but I am at work on the subject
and will announce the names in a few
days. . I may say that all publication of
names in connection with the composi
tion of the committee have been wholly
unauthorized." ;"Â»..-Â» v -
"There has been much said about the
financial plank ' of the platform, Mr.
Hanna, and the reason for its adoption in
its present form. What have you to
say?"
â  "Only this, that the assertion that it
was in any sense forced upon ; the com
mittee or convention by the delegates
from the East or any particular part of
the East is untrue."
"Then it is satisfactory to you?"
"Personally speaking, entirely so."
"What shape or direction will the cam
paign take, tariff or finance?'.'
"Oh, it will be strongly tariff ; you may j
be sure of that."
â¢ Later Mr.' Hanna was closeted with Mr. j
McKinley, remaining with him until train
time. While these visitors were at the
house they were joined by W. M. Hahn of
Mansfield, formerly member of the Na
tional Committee from Ohio, and Colonel
Henry I. Kowalsky, a delegate from San
Francisco, en route to Pittsburg, where he
will address the ratification meeting to be
held in Carnegie Hall. The colonel takes
a ' roseate view of the situation in the
West.
"California," he said, "is vitally inter
ested in the maintenance of the principles -,
of protection and upon that issue the Re- i
publican party will triumphantly carry !
the State. The money question will cut
no important figure. X think the condi- j
tion of things in Colorado warrants me in |
saying that Wolcott will defeat Teller and
that the Centennial State will remain in
the Republican column. I have talked â 
with Major McKinley and he is of the !
opinion that several of the silver States, j
so called, can be carried this year on the
protective tariff argument.
Mr. Hahn spoke in the same strain.
"You have to make your campaign," he
said, "upon your whole platform. This j
year it is protection and sound money, |
and by that we will win. The people nor- j
mated McKinley and the people will elect
him. Every man who carries a tin pail â
and we must have them to win â is â  think- j
ing of the tariff as the aeeney which con- !
trols the condition of affairs and makes it
possible for him to keep his dinner pail I
rilled, or prevents him from filling it."
A delegation of 250 citizens from Zanes- ;
ville and Muskingum County visited Ma- <
jor McKinley to-night and in greeting \
them he said:
"We have had some experience in the
last three years and a half. Experienc?

! have taken the place of prediction. We

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
But There Are to Be Many-
Other Candidates at
Chicago.
CHOSEN SONS OF THE
STATES.
Much Oratory in Order When
the Nominations fcr Presi
dent Are Made.
A VERY LONG CONVENTION
PROMISED.
Proposed Policy of the Gold Men to
Divide the Field as Much as
Possible.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 23.âPoli
ticians are now figuring that the Chicago
convention will be in session ten days or
two weeks. They believe that the matter
' of a platform will not take up much time
j after the convention gets to work. The
I platform, if there is no change in the pro
j gramme of the silver men, will not be
| long, not half so long as that of the St.
I Louis convention. The tariff will be
I touched lightly and if there is anything
' like a straddle anywhere it will be on this
question. But judging from the present
â  outlook no candidate for the Presidential
', nomination will have as much as 150 votes
! to start.
Boies or Bland will lead. It will be a
great day of oratory when the time for
nominations is reached, and there will be
so many candidates that a long time will be
I consumed in placing them in nomination.
i lowa will present Boies, Missouri will put
i forward the name of "Silver Dick" Bland,
Indiana will present Matthews, Ohio will
say Campbell is her favorite, Stevenson
â  will be put up by delegates from different
' States, California wiil present the name of
| Senator White, South Carolina will show
I up with the name of Tillman, some of the
j silver men will agree to put Teller in
j nomination, Kentucky will enthusiasti
j caily present Blackburn, Pattison will be
I the choice of Pennsylvania, Russell will
1 be presented by some of the New England
; men, Wnitney and Carlisle will find
friends, and there are Senator Gorman,
Senator Morgan, Senator Harris, Governor
Altgeld and a large number of possibili
'< ties. In fact, the field will be an unlim
itWi o'Â»o, arid it woukl not be saie to picfc
! the favorite and place money on him
| against the field.
it is said that it will be the policy of tha
gold-standard men to divide the field as
much as possible. They will have three
or four men in nomination and will scat
ter their votes until it is seen that the sil
ver men are beginning to concentrate on
a certain man; then they will go to the
man most likely to receive votes from the
silver delegates. Campbell is said to be
the man selected to make the last race
against the strongest silver candidate.
His popularity among Southern men may
make him a formidable candidate. If
Campbell is not the most available man
there is Stevenson, and a last rosort may
find Morrison in the race. He did not
say in his recent telegram that he did not
want his name presented at Chicago. He
simply asked that nothing be done to
secure the indorsement of the Illinois con
vention for .iim.
It is said here that there is no likelihood
that Campbell will get the full vote of
Ohio. The full fledged silver men there
like the Governor well enough personally
and as a Democrat, but they think his
conversion to silver is only partial. This2
is the opinion of almost every Ohio silver
man who cornea to Washiogtou, many of
them Governor Campbell's warmest friends
and some of tbem his supporters. .It fe
estimated that he cannot poll more Than
one-third of the delegation at any time.
It has been reported here for some time that
John R. McLean offered his support to
Campbell some time ago, and that it was
accepted. Later it was stated that some
of the same men who had induced Gov
ernor Campbell to remain in the race went
to Mr. McLean and asked him to allow
the use of his name jor first place. Mr.
McLean declined and announced that he
would support Campbell. The story is
given on the authority of a number of re- |
fcponsible men, but may be one of the idle
ruruers floating around. Mr. McLean will
be a power in the Ohio delegation, and if
lie is supporting Campbeil the latter will
be fortunate.
The Vice-Presidential nomination is
also going to be eagerly sought after. Mr.
McLean's friends are pushing him with
vigor. Many of the Presidential possibili
ties named will be available for second
place when they have been knocked out
for tirst. Senator Daniels, Senator Bacon
of Georgia. Representative Bailey, Senator
elect Money, Governor Stone of Missouri
and a host of others are in line.

REPLIES TO WHITNEY.
Wharton Barker Says the Ex-Sec
retary's Statement Is Misleading
and Fallacious.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 23.â Wharton
Barker has written a reply to the state
ment of the Hon. William C. Whitney
which was published Monday. Mr. Bar
ker claims that:
â¢Mr. Whitney's statements are so mis
.eadin^ and fallacious that they realiy
should not go unchallenged. It is fortu
nate that he represents so few of the
members of tne Democratic party who en
tertain the Fielief to which he gives ex
pression. The people have been misled
and deceived too long. They have be
lieved, hoped and doubted, the condition
growing gradually from bad to worse,
until the conviction has settled upon them
that they have been used by such men as
Mr. Whitney, not in the advancement of
the interests of the people at large, but
merely as a part of a ereat piece of ma
chinery to further their own selfish ends.
His appeal will be of no avail. Cleveland
could not stem the tide with ail the power
of office at his command ; Whitney cannot
do it, even though backed by the combined
wealth of England.
"Mr. Whitney declares that we must re
main subservient to Great Britain; that
we must not think of restoring bimetal
lism until the British Government, con
trolled by the creditor classes, expresses a
willingness to co-operate with us to that
end. No steps must be taken to restore
bimetallism until we have the consent and
approval of those who, prompted by self
ish motives and by the hope of enrich-
ment and self-aguandisement at the ex
pense of the producing classes, have
advocated the gold standard with the
avowed purpose of doubling the burden of
ail debts."
Continuing, Mr. Barker says:
"Surely it is folly to wait for those who !
benefit from an appreciating dollar to co- 1
operate with us in restoring bimetallism.
It is true that in the long run the im
moral is often the expedient, and that j
goil monometallism, if persisted in, will
end in the inability of debtors to pay
either interest or principal. But the j
creditor classes of Great Britain will never j
advocate bimetallism until they have sue- ;
ceeded in confiscating the property of all ,
their debtors. Then, as owners of prop- I
erty, their interests will be in restoring j
bimetallism and raiding prices, but not
before.
"If we wait upon Great Britain we will
wait until the property of our industrial
classes has been confiscated by foreign
money lenders, until our producing
classes have become bankrupt and reduced
to poverty, misery and despair and until
the foreign bondholders who lay tribute
upon them have given place to foreign
landlords ready to lay tribute upon us in
a new role.
'Mr. Whitney tells us that any move on
our part to lilt the yoke of vassalage to
(ireat Britain ana free our producing
classes from the owners tiibute that now
rests upon them must end in disaster;
that any attempt on our part to do away
with the 200 cent dollar that is capping our
vitality must end in disaster.
"The truth is disaster can only be
averted by doing away with this 200 cent
dollar. The alternative that confronts us is
not sound money or disaster, but free coin
age or bankruptcy. Unless we open our
mints to silver, check the appreciation of
cold and free our producing classes
from the owner's tribute to the creditor
classes of Great Britain which the appre
ciating gold standard lays upon them,
bankruptcy is inevitable.
"We pay the interest on our foreign
debt to our British creditors by exports of
commodities bold in England. The higher
the prices we get the lighter will be the
burdens of our indebtedness, and the open
ing of our mints to silver will enable our
producers to get higher prices. How?
Simply because the increased demand for
silver caused by opening our mints to sil
ver and the decreased demand for gold,
due to the throwing upon silver equally
with gold the burden of effecting our ex
chanees and supporting our credit tabric,
would cause the gold price of silver to rise
until the parity between gold and silver at
the old ratio would be restored. And just
as silver rose, the cost to all gold-using
peoples buying in silver-using countries,
and paying with silver, would rise with
the gold price in silvr or silver exchange,
which they have to buy and send in settle
ment for purchases made in said coun
tries.
"So, just as silver rose, the British
trader would turn to us to make the pur
chases of cotton and wheat and other
produce he has bought in ever-enlarging
volume since the demonetization of silver
from countries in which gold is at a pre
mium as measured in their currencies.
Consequently, the price our producers
could demand for th<-ir products would
increase, and just as the prices received
for our exports rose, the burden of our
indebtedness would be lightened."
BARKER'S LITTLE BOOM.
It Will Be Launched by Judge
Washburn at a Siiver Meeting
In New York.
PHiLADKLPHIA, Pa., June 23.-The
boom of Wharton Barker, the Phila
delphia banker and editoi of the Ameri
can, was started this afternoon by Judge
J. M. Washburn of Colorado, a prominent
member of the Denver bar and one of the
leaders of the silver forces in the West.
Judge Washburn is stopping in the city.
He came East a few days ago to open a
silver Presidential campaign, and intends
to tight side by side with Mr. Barker until
the latter is made a Presidential candidate.
The Judge is making arrangements with
"Joe" Blackburn of Kentucky for a big
silver meeting of young men to take place
in New York, possibly within a week,
'"hen the Barker boom will be pushed
along with a rush. In an interview to
day Judge Washburn said:
"It is no detriment to any other man to
arrirni that in the variety and grasp of Mr.
Barker's mind and qualification he would
a President that would honor the
Republic, return to the first principles of
the constitution and administer the Gov
ernment in the interests of liberty and of
the people of the Government, as has not
been done for a long time.
"Nominated and sustained by the bi
metallists of the country, rejecting the
novel heresy of gold monometallism and
the delusive catch words of 'sound money'
and advocating the return to the money
of the constitution for eight years, Mr.
Barker will surely be elected. I do not
hesitate to afh'rm that Mr. Barker is the
very man that auswers to the peculiar
exigencies of the greatest crisis of the
Nation, in which is again before the peo
ple the great struggle of independence
from the domination of English feudalism
in the form of money and aristocracy."
GROVER NOT A CANDIDATE
Attorney-General Harnon Declares
the President Would Not Run
for Another Term.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 23.âAttor
ney-General Harmon left for Washington
this afternoon. He was asked if President
Cleveland would run for another term.
"Certainly not," he replied. "There
never was a time, so I believe, since his
present term as President that he ever had
the least idea of being a candidate again,
and 1 am confident that under no circum
stances would he accept a renoiuination."

West, under the leadership of Henry M.

What will our National Convention do?
Will the East control its action and write
its platform? Rest assured that it will ex
haust every effort to do so. If they fail in
effort, will they remain loyal to party or
will they bolt? I don't know, but I would

When the temporary chairman asked
who should lead the people out of bondage
there were great shouts of "Boies," fol
lowed by cries ot '-Bland." Somebody
yelled "Teller," at which there was great
confusion, with cries of "No." The great
eat demonstration came when the speaker
proceeded to express hope that God would
forgive them for their share in the last
election of Grover Cleveland. A hurricane
of cheers came from every part of the
great hail. When it subsided there were
yells of "Say it over again I" "Hit him
again!" '"Tell the reporters to put that
down," followed by another round of ap
plause. Altogether the demonstration of
antagonism to the President was very pro
nounced.
Coats, vests, collars and suspenders were
discarded by most oi the delegates when
the convention reassembled at 3 o'clock,
and for nearly five hours thereafter 7000
people contributed toward making the
tabernacle a seething furnace. Hon.
Charles K. Ladd was presented as perma
nent chairman, and made a fierce address,
in which he said the West was ready to
ilght the torch of liberty that would shine
over the continent and to swear by the
Goddess of Liberty that present conditions
I should exist no longer.
The committee on resolutions not being
â¢ ready to report, two hours of speech mak
i ing were in order. Ex-Congressman N. E.
Worthington of Peoria declared the East
ern golabues were responsible for 40-cent
wheat and $10 horses, but there was a sen
i timent brewing in the West that would
paralyze them.
Just as the speaker was concluding Gov
| ernor Altgeld made his appearance on the
platform and was given a tremendous
ovation. On being presented he spoke at
I iength.
'"'Four years ago," the Governor began,
! "our people met under brighter skies. The
! country was tired of that governmental
policy which made the few mighty and
the many poor. In Illinois the people re
belled at the interference of the State in
the personal affairs of the individual.
We promised democratic government in
| National affairs and a business adminis
tration in State affairs. The people took
us at our word and they gave us their con
fidence and we swept the country by such
a majority that fidelity to Democratic
principles would have insured supremacy
for a quarter of a century.
''But, before the inaugural festivities
had ceased at Washington, the head of the
new administration sought strange gods
and espoused alien principles. He called
into his councils prophets who knew not
Democracy or ti.e tenets of its fathers.
Our people were asked to bow to altars
which they had been taught to abhor. The
interests of money were placed above
those of humanity. Organized greed was
fed with golden spoons while the cry of
the husbandman was unheeded and the
sweat of the toiler brought him no bread.
"It soon became apparent," he con
tinued, "that the new administration was
trying to displace the Republicans in their
principles and place its feet on their
ground. Then came defeat to the Demo
cratic party. Some reaction was to be ex
pected after \*'sl because of the necessary
disappointments in office seeking and be
cause of the hard times. But this reac
tion would have been short in duration if
any sympathy had been shown for the
suffering masses. All might have been
well if the administration had respected
republican institutions and not used its
great powers to increase the burdens of
our people for the benefit of foreign and
Eastern Shylocks.
"But," the Governor asserted, "the peo
ple are beginning to gain new courage.
First one and then another repudiated the
golden calf which 'the sons of Mammon'
had set up in the East and which ail men
had been ordered to bow to on penalty of
social and political death."
He said that if all the men who thought
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
alike on the great questions of the day
would stand together the hirelings of
plutocracy would be routed. Tne Governor
then turned his attention to some of those
influential party leaders whose advice had
been followea, with the result that the
Democratic party was neutral on almost
every subject, and every great issue had
to be straddled for fear of losing votes. In
order to win ti.e party must take a decided
stand on the great questions. The people
must be shown with distinctness what they
are to expect for their votes.
"If we once do this," the speaker con
tinued, "and once chow the people that
we are in earnest, no power in this land
can prevent our shaping the policy and
guiding the destinies of the republic; for
there are more men who believe in Demo
cratic doctrines to-day than ever before in
the history of this country. The harvest
is ours if we will only show that we are
honest husbandmen."
Reserving a discussion of the monetary
question for a later stage of his address,
the Governor next devoted his attention to
the tariff question. He said the subject
was an old one and one with which the
people could no longer be deceived. The
probabilities were that neither party
would make any radical change in the
present tariff. A high tariff, he claimed,
always contributed to build up the tew at
the expense of the many. It protects the
proprietor, but not the laborer, for while it
checks the importation of goods it cannot
prevent the importation of cheap labor
from all over the earth. The degredation
and poverty of the European laborer, he
said, were in exact proportion to the height
of the tariff or import duties. The speaker
went into the history of the question to
some extent to support his views and
pointed to the McKinley law as a com
plete illustration "ot the supreme folly of
an exceedingly high tariff."
The money question was next referred
to. Between 1873 and 1880 this country
and all of the nations of Europe by law
destroyed one-half of the redemption
money of the world and reduced by fully
one-half the annual addition to the stock
of money of the world. Silver wDen used
at all was put on the basis of jÂ»aper money.
The effect of this was to double the work
which gold had to do and by doubing its
importance its purchasing power was
doubled. It made 200 cent dollars; so
that on the average it took twice as much
of commodities and of property to get
$100 as it formerly did. As the debts, in
terest, taxes and other fixed charges were
not reduced, it took nearly everything
which the farmer and the producing
classes generally could scrape together to
meet the fixed charges. They had no
money left to purchase the comforts of
life. Their purchasing power was pone.
This destroyed the trade of the merchant
and soon foiced the factories to shut
down; there being no markets for what
tne laborer made he had to go idle, so that
the producer, the merchant and the laborer
were all in distress.
"The conditions," he continued, "are
getting worse and worse every day and
there can be no great prosperity in Europe
and this country until the wrong that pro
duced this distress has been righted. As
it was done by the arbitrary act of the
Government, so it must be undone by the
Government. As the Democratic party
represents the great toiling and producing
masses it must take the lead in the undo
ing of the wrong. The Democratic party
must speak with no uncertain sound on
this subject. Hedging renders a party
impotent, reduces it to a mere office-get â¢
ting machine and makes it contemptible.
Our country has gone through a period of
political straddling on all questions. He
was considered the best politician who
could fool the most people; but nil things
come to an end and this practice has
reached its limit. The people are in earn
est and demand plain talk. We must state
our position clearly and live up to it. We
are at ouce confronted with the question
of ratio. Theoretically bimetallism does
not depend on any particular ratio
and if this question could be considered
by Congress on its merits alone and free
from outside pressure it is probable the
subject of ratio would not be discussed by
the public at all.
"But tne bimetallic system was destroyed
by corrupt outside influence, and Wail
street has repeatedly shown its ability to
shape legislation at Washington. The
men|who make vast fortunes out of existing
conditions will do all they can to prevent
a change. Tne men who a year ago made
about 10,000,000 of dollars out of the Gov
ernment in a small bond transaction, car
ried out through a secret contract with the
President and the Secretary of the Treas
ury, â will do all in their power to prevent a
change in policy. These men will try to
capture the Chicago convention, and fail
ing in that will move heaven and earth to
control the new administration in case we
succeed. Bitter experience has taught
our people that their interests are always
in danger at Washington and that if we
succeed in this campaign the victory may
be thrown away there, consequently it is
felt to be necessary to leave no room for
quibbling."
The speaker characterized the late Re
publican convention as the most brazen
effort on the part of organized preed ever
attempted to control the destinies of the
country. It adopted a platform, he as
serted, in the interests of England; its
principles stand for paralysis, poverty and
distress, and it put in nomination for
President a man who will only be a ser
vant to carry out the mandates of his
managers.
The remainder of the Governor's speech
dealt with State matters. All of the de
partments at the capital were in admirable
condition. But lie condemned the pres
ent revenue system as a monster of injus
tice. The Republican Legislature came in
for a severe criticism for its alleged cor
ruption. The establishment of the State
account system in the penitentiaries he
credited to the Democratic party mainly,
but recommended a still further reform
which will take the prisoners entirely out
of competition with other labor.
In conclusion the Governor said that he
appreciated the approval of his friends, as
Biiown by their desire for hi- renomina
tion, but claimed he was not in a condi
tion to stand for re-election. His health
was broken by his attention to public
duties and his property interests were suf
fering. He had no ambition to be a party
leader ana asked that he be permitted to
retire from public life. His closing words
were: "Let the world know that we re
gard our party platform sacred as holy
writ and that any pledge made to the peo
ple will be carried out and long beiore the
ides of November the cohorts of plutocracy
arid corruption and all their hirelings and
hangers-on will be driven from the great
temple of the people."
The Governor's allusions to President
Cleveland were received with tumultuous
applause. When the Governor announced
that his physical and financial condition
would prevent him entering a canvass for
a re-election there was a depressing
silence. The next moment with a mighty
shout of "No" the convention rose en
masse and repeated the ovation that
greated his entrance.
Ex-Congressman Champ Clark of Mis
souri "jollied" the audience with a humor
ous speech, in winch he named Bniea.
Bland, Bryan, Matthews and Blackburn
as acceptable nominees of the Chicago
convention. The lowa ex-Governor was
accorded the bulk of applause. General
Stubbs of lowa spoke briefly.
When the report of the committee on
credentials was submitted ex-Congress
men Williams and Fithian protested
against the unit-rule plank, but they were
howled down and the rule indorsed. The
platform was adopted with a few voices in
the negative.
Governor Altgeld was renominated by
acclamation amid a &cene of wild enthu
siasm. The balance of the ticket was
speedily completed, and at 7:35 o'clock
the convention adjourned sine die.
FREE SILVER WILL WIN.
Governor Matthews and White-
Metal Men to Control the In
diana Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., June 23.â The
Democratic State Convention meets here
to-morrow. Governor Matthews will con
trol the organization, and it is altogether
probable that free silver will win. There
will be a fight, however, as a minority re
port will be introduced.
District conventions were held through
out the State to-day, some of them being
attended with considerable excitement.
To the surprise of everybody, the sound
money people were able to control the
Tenth District and put a sound-money
man on the resolutions committee, as well
as two sound-money men on the Chicago
delegation.
J. P. Gallagher of Michigan City will
brinir in the minority report favoring a
gold-standard plank and it will be sup
ported by W. i). Bynum and other leaders
on the floor.
The delegates to the Chicago convention
were elected in this (the Seventh) district
to-night. The sound-money men elected
two in the Tenth and two in the Seventh,
but one of these latter is contested by the
silver men.
The plan of Governor Matthews to-day
to control the Seventh District conven
tion failed because the credentials com
mittee did not get through its work in
time to seat the silver delegates before the
meeting of the district. One other gold
delegate was elected in the Third District,
but he was tied up with silver instruc
tions.
Judge ShatiKlin declined to stand as a
candidate for Governor, and the nomina
tion will thus go to ex-Congressman B. P.
Shiveley of South Bend, Ind., by acclama
tion. He is a radical siiver man.
The financial plank in the platform
reads :
We maintain the time-honored Democratic
principle of bimetallism and reiterate our
allegiance to that soundest and most honest
monetary system, and demand the immediate
and independent restoration of silver by ;he
Iree and unlimited coinage of both pold and
silver as primary money at the ratio of lti to 1,
without awaiting the action of any other
nation, such change to be full legal tender for
all debts, public and private.
The other planks in the platform declare
in favor of the present tariff law on the
theory that the lack of free coinage is the
sole cause of the present depressed finan
cial conditions; gives Governor Matthews
a strong indorsement for the Presidential
nomination; declares strongly in favor of
the independence of Cuba; uemands the
election of the United States Senators by
popular vote and reaffirms the "time
honored" doctrine of personal rights with
out specifically mentioning the Nicholson
bill.
DEMOCRATS OF TEXAS.
"Regulars" and "Sound Money"
Men Mold Separate State
Conventions at Austin.
AUSTIN, Tex., June 23.â The regular
State Democratic Convention to elect dele
gates to ihe Chicago convention met here
this morning with about 1000 delegates
present. After eft>cting temporary or
ganization the convention adjourned until
3p. m. At that hour, the committee not
being able to report, adjournment was
taken until 8 o'clock.
The convention, at 11 o'clock, declared
for free coinage. A minority report by the
sound-money wing was voted down by
over two-thirds majority. The convention
will probably elect eight delegates from
the State at large to the Chicago conven
tion, among them ex-Governor Hogg,
Governor Culberson and Congressman
Bailey. It is the concensus of opinion
that Bland will 03 instructed for.
The "Sound-money" Democratic Con
vention, witn about 400 delegates present,
met to-day and in a harmonious session
adopted a platform repudiating the meth
ods and actions of the State Democratic
executive committee in calling the regular
convention and fixing the mode of elect
ing district delegates. They declare the
action of the committee necessitates the
reorganization of the Democratic party in
Texas.
They congratulate the country that thus
far the credit and honor of the Nation has
been maintained oy President Cleveland
and Treasurer Carlisle. They elected fif
teen Democratic electors and called a State
convention to meet in Waco August 25 to
nominate State officers. A full delegation
was elected to attend the Chicago conven
tion with discretion to act in such manner
as in their judgement will best promote
the integrity and honor of the Democratic
party of the State and Nation, and they
are instructed to act in concert with all
true Democrats for the advancement of
sound Democratic principles. Adjourned
sine die.
OHIO IS FOR SILVER.
General Warner Wiil Be Made Chair-
man of the Democratic State
Convention.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 23.â The dis
trict meetings selected the committees for
the Democratic State Convention this even
ing. The committee on resolutions stands
eleven for free silver and four for gold.
This leaves no further doubt that the con
vention will adopt a free-silver resolution.
The delegates from this district selected
two free-silver delegates to the Chicago
convention, as did those from the Nine
teenth.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion has decided to make A. J. Warner,
president of the Bimetallic League, the
permanent chairman of the convention.
This is to emphasize the victory of the
free-silver faction.
NEW YORK'S STRUGGLE.
Gold Men, Headed by William C.
Whitney, Exoect to Easily
Carry the Day.
SARATOGA. N. V., June 23âTo-mor
row s Democratic State Convention prom
ises to be one of the quietest and most
harmonious in the history of the Democ
racy of the Empire State during recent
years. But for the squad of decorators
hanging buntinc in Convention Hall and
an occasional politician on the streets or
in the hotel lobbies, one would hardly
suspect that a convention was on the eve
of assembling. The absence of prelimi
nary skirmishing and wire pulling by the
elans toetokeus harmony, and so far aa cau
be learned to-morrow's convention will be
lacking in exciting features.
William C. Whitney, State Chairman
Jaanes W. Hinckley, Senator Hill and
ex-Governor Flower arrived this evening.
All of the delegates who are here agree
that practically no opposition will De
made to a declaration for sound money
and the gold standard. John Boyd
Thacher, Mayor of Albany and an aspir
ant for the gubernatorial nomination, will
be temporary chairman, and the delegates
at large to Chicago will probably be Sen
ators Hill and Murphy, Roswell P, Flower
and Frederick R, Coudert. Mr. Whitney,
who was urged to take the fourth place,
prefers to work at Chicago from the out
side.
UNDER OLD-TIME LEADERS
Gold Democrats of Wisconsin Carry
the Day, and the Yellow-Metal
Plank Causes Cheers.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., June 23. â The
Democratic State Convention met here
this morning. Upon the stage in the
Bijou Opera-house were gathered the old
time leaders â Senator Vilas. General Bragg,
W. C. Silverthorn, Thomas Barton and
other notables, who were cheered as they
took their seats. At 11 o'clock ex-Gov
ernor Peck, chairman of the State Central
Committee, read the call and introduced
Thomas F. Frawley of Eau Claire, who
acted as temporary chairman.
After Mr. Frawley 'a address the usual
committees were appointed', their person
nel indicating clearly that the gold men
had full control of the.convention.
The chief interest in the committees was
centered in that on resolutions. The only
enthusiasm manifested was when the
name of some well-known advocate of free
silver coinaee at a ratio of 16 to 1 was
reached. Especially was this the case
when the name of W. C. Silverthorn of
Wausau was announced to represent the
Ninth District. After a recess the conven
tion reassembled at 3:55. The temporary
officers were made permanent, and Mr.
Usher read the report of the committee on
resolutions. The names of Cleveland,
Yilas and Mitchell were cheered to the
echo and there were loud cheers for the
gold piar.k.
Mr. Silverthorn submitted a minority
report in favor of free coinage. He called
the leaders of both parties protoplastic
prevaricators.
Senator Vilas made a stirring appeal for
the gold standard, and after numerous
speeches the minority report was rejected.
The delegates at large are: Senator Vilas,
General Edwrrd S. Bragg, James G. Flan
ders of Milwaukee and James J. Hogan of
La Crosse.
Favor a Silver Union.
BUTTE. Most., June 23.â The Populist
State Convention at Boulder to-day elected

The resolutions declare for free silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1; for the initiative and
referendum; denounce the Cleveland ad
ministration for its action in Chicago dur
ing the American Railway L'nion strike
| and the imprisonment of Eugene V. Debs
â¢as an outrage. The question of fusion on
i the silver question with some other Na
tional narty was left to the judgment of
the delegates. They will go uninstructed,
hut a majority personally favor a union of

AN INTERESTING CAMPAIGN.
Wty tl c Country Must Be Rescued
From the Evi s of Demo
cratic Rule.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 23.â The first
big ratification meetinc of the approach
ing campaign was held to-night at the
Carnegie Music Hall. The meeting was
held under the auspices of the Republican
County Committee to indorse the nominees
of the St. Louis convention. Thomas C.
Platt was ihe principal speaker. He was
wildly cheered. He said:
"I greet you, ladies and gentlemen, as a
Republican whose prido in his party,
whose respect for its courage, whose faith
for its principles, whose confidence in its
success and whose devotion to its candi
dates were never greater than they are this
minute.
"We are entering upon the most inter
esting campaign in which the Republican
party has engaged since the issues of the
Civil War were determined. The contrasts
afforded in the history of the last three
years between Republican and Democratic
rule are fully convincing, and we go for
ward to rescue the country from the evils
of free trade and to save it from the evils
of free silver.
"Under the pretense, Mr. Chairman, of
protecting the people against the power
I and greed of capital, the Democratic party
t is always proposing measures, the surest
! and speediest el'fect of which is to render
; the people more than ever incapable of
\ self-protection. The Democratic party ob
! tamed power upon the assurance that free
I trade would take the profits then going to
â  the employing classes and hand them
.overiotho wage-earners. But the result
! was there were no longer any profits for
i anybody. And now the Democrats are
' singing the siren sone of 'Cheap Money.'
! They spy if yon will make a law declaring
j that 50 cents' worth of silver shall be as
competent for all purposes as 100 cents'
worth of gold the creditor class will lose
its advantage over the debtor class, and
everybody will have enough. My friends,
'â  there's notning in it. When you can
! legislate sense into the heads of fools;
i virtue into the hearts of knaves, and peace
I into the souls of the restless and unhappy,
then and not until then will you he able
to equalize the conditions in which the
human family lives. Pending that time,
j I want the dollar that my employer gives
me for my labor to be as good as the dol
lar he extracts from me for rent and food
| and clothes.
"We cannot lose on the issue of protec
tion and hoi.est money. The forty-five
votes of New England protest that we
shall win. The thirty-six votes of New
York protest that we shall win. The
thirty-two votes of Pennsylvania, the ten
of New Jersey, the twenty-three of Ohio,
the twenty-four of Illinois, the thirteen of
lowa, the ten of Kansas, the fourteen of
Michigan, the nine of Minnesota, the
twelve of Wisconsin, the eight of Ne
braska, all sure Republican States, are the
assurances that we shall win, and back of
all else is the convincing fact that we are
practical people, and with the Democratic
folly to decide our judgment we know
when we have had enough of a bad
thing.
"The RepnDlieans of New York are
united In behalf of the candidates that
were nominated and the platform that
was adopted at St. Louis. I hope they
will be no less united in all matters that
aflect the welfare of the party and the
honor of their State. I am always ready
to set the example of cheerful acquiesenee
in the will of the majority."

THE SUBURBAN,
Henry of Navarre Was
First in the Classic
Event.
THE COMMONER SECOND.
Clifford Was an Odds-on Favorite,
but Could Only Finish
Third.
THE WEBTERNER A SURPRISE.
Griffin Rode a Good Race and Navarre
Won Rather Easily at
the End.
SHEEPSHEAD BAY. N. V., June 23.â
Henry of Navarre demonstrated once
more his right to the title, "King of the
Turf," by winning the thirteenth sub
urban handicap at Sheepshead Bay to
day. His victory was well earned, as he
beat some of the best horses in training.
The mighty Clifford was among the
vanquished to-day. Clifford was favorite.
This was largely due to the fact that Taral
had the mount on him. Clifford was also
favorite for the Brooklyn handicap, and
was beaten by Sir Walter in a very close
tinish. Taral's superior jockeyship, every
one said, defeated Clifford then. Clayton,
who rode him in the Brooklyn handicap,
got the blame for Clifford's failure to make
his run until too late. Taral was engaged
to ride him in to-day's great race, and
every one said he would do better with a
stronger jockey than Clayton on bis back.
Clifford, however, did not do as well for
Taral as he did for Clayton. He was not
once dangerous or prominent. The Com
moner, with Clayton up, was the contend
ing horse at the finish. He it was that
forced his former stable companion, Henry
of Navarre, to a cruel drive to hold his
own. Clifford had all his work cut out to
finish ahead of Belmar, Hornpipe, Sir
Walter and NankiDOoh, who were all in
hopeless difficulties a couple of furlongs
from home.
The start for the great race wai prompt
and good. Belmar was the stirst to break
the even line, but he quickly yielded the
post of honor to Hornpipe. jAt the upper
turn Hornpipe took a commandine lead,
but was joined by The Commoner as they
swung into the back stretdh. This pair
then had a good streak of daylight be
tween them and Henry of Navarre, who
was the most forward of the others. There
was but little change in the order until
they reached the old clubhouse turn.
There Henry of Navarre joined the lead
ers and the others also moved up.
They swung into the homestretch with
The Commoner in command, lapped to
the throatlatch by Henry of Navarre, who
had Hornpipe and Clifford at his withers.
The weight and pace had begun to tell on
Sir Walter and he dropped back to keep
Nankipooh company.
When they were straightened out for
home Hamilton went to work like a fiend
on Hornpipe. The son of Mr. Pickwick
and Round Dance responded with such a
wonderful burst of speed that the cry
"Hornpipe Wins" rang throughout the
stand. Griffin, however, still had a tight
hold of Henry of Navarre. Hornpipe
got half a length ahead of him, but Griffin
evidently did not fear him. He sat mo
tionless and kept his grip on Henry's
head until the sixteenth post had been
pasied. Clayton then made a bold bid for
victory on The Commoner. Hornpipe had
given up the struggle and Henry ap
peared to have but Clifford to beat. The
latter was running tluggishly on the out
side and urge him as Taral would and did
he failed to get enough speed out of him
to force Henry of Navarre to a drive.
The Commoner put a new element of
danger in the race so far as Henry of Na
varre was concerned. His challenge was so
persistent and well-timed that he had
headed Henry before Griffin realized that
in The Commoner he had a foeman worthy
of his steel. Only once did the lash de
scend upon Henry's heaving flanks. That
was enough. He knew he was required to
do his best and with the ?ame dauntless
courage that has marked his entire career
he put his best energies forth and won by
a length. The Commoner, the good thing
from the West that had been so carefully
bottled up, had to be content with place
honors. These he secured from Clifford by
half a length.
The victory of Henry of Navarre was re
ceived with cheers. The day was a good
one for the professional bettors. Attend

ELECTIONS IN CANADA.
The Liberals Have Secured a
Clear Majority in the
House.
Overthrow of the Conservative Gov
ernment Lei by Sir Charles
Tupper.
TORONTO, Ontario, June 23.â The gen
eral election for the Dominion Parliament
took place throughout the Dominion to
day and the contest was probably the most
hotly contested and in some respects the
most bitter in the history of Canada. The
result is the complete overthrow of the
Conservative Government, led by Sir
Charles Tupper.
While the tariff question was the most
important issue of the campaign the
Manitoba school question aroused a
greater degree oi enthusiasm and excite
ment, and a leading feature in the election
was the double-headed policy of the Con
servative party on that question. Many
Conservatives ran as supporters of the
Government on all questions except as re
gards its present Manitoba remedial legis
lation. Three Cabinet Ministers in the
Tupper Government were defeated, viz.:
Hon. A. R. Dickey, Minister of Justice;
Hon. L. O. Taillon, Postmaster-General,
and Hon. A. des Jardines, Minister of
Public Works.
Hon. Wilfred Laurier, the Liberal leader,
was elected for two constituencies. Dalton
McCarthy, leader of the Independents,
was also elected for two constituencies.
Hon. Joseph Martin, a leading Liberal
and author of the Manitoba scnool law,
was defeated in Winnipeg by Hugh J. Mac-
Donaid, son of the late Sir John Mac-
Donald.
Hon. Peter White, Speaker of the House
of Commons, and Hon. A. B. Angers, ex-
Minister of Agriculture from the Macken
zie-Bowell Cabinet, was defeated. Hon.
David Mills, ex-Minister of the Interior in
Alexander Mackenzie's Cabinet, was also
defeated.
The vote at midnight stands: Liberals
111, Conservatives 79, Independents 8,
Patrons 4. There are still eleven con
stituencies to hear from, but it is conceded
that Laurier, Liberal leader, will, on the
assemblying of the House, have a clean
majority of 68, irrespective of the Inde
pendents and Patrons. There was much
excitement throughout the country, but
the voting passed off quietly.
Hot Election in Manitoba.
WINNIPEG, Man., June 23.â The Win
nipeg election fought out here to-day be
tween Hon. Joseph Martin, Liberal, and
Hon. Hugh John McDonald, Conserva
tive, was without doubt the hottest ever
contested in Canada. The excitement was
intense, no such scenes having been wit
nessed here before. The issue was the
Manitoba national school policy. Mc-
Donald was successful. He defeated the
Liberal candidate by a majority of 126.
Joseph I'restwich Jtead.
LONDON, Eng., June 23.â Joseph Prest
wich, D.C.L., F.K.S., the celebrated Eng
lish geologist and author, is dead. He
was 84 years old.
THE SAN FRANCISCO' CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
GEN, CAMPBELL
BECOMES INSANE,
The Great Prohibitionist
Committed to an
Asylum.
HE WAS VERY VIOLENT.
Strayed From Home While Un
balanced and Wandered
Many Miles.
RAN AMUCK ON THE STREET.
Sad Scene in the Courtroom When He
Was Examined as to His
Sanity.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 23.â General
A. B. Campbell, the Republican orator
and politician, became violently insane
last evening and had to be locked in a
padded cell. He has been suffering for
some days past from inflammation of the
brain and has been acting queeily, but
last evening gave the first indication that
his trouble was likely to prove serious.
He became very violent on Spring street,
attempted to kill several persons who ap
proached him and rushed down the street
yelling at the top of his voice. Nothing
could be done to quiet him, so he was
taken in charge by the authorities. He
fought desperately at the County Jail,
yelled as loudly as he could, and even at
tempted to do himself bodily injury. It
was necessary to put the cuffs on his
hands to secure him.
On Sunday last General Campbell wan
dered from the city while temporarily un
balanced and when.he partially recovered
it was to find himself in the town of Al
hambra, ten miles from here.
To-day he was committed to the asylum
at Highlands. There is a lingering hope
that he may recover in come degree his
lost mentality and be restored to his many
friends in condition to resume his place in
the community, but the basis of such a
hope is meager indeed.
This splendid man of yesterday pre
sented a pitiable spectacle this forenoon
when brought into court, manacled, for
the examination. He had ceased his
paroxysms of grief and rage and was quiet
and self-possessed. He fully understood
his sorrowful plight and with grave de
meanor asked permission to make a state
ment in his own behalf and answer the
usual questions. Judge Smith, evidently !
affected by the scene before him, indulged â 
the orator.
The general, with perfect coolness and
in hia choicest English, explained that his
father had been subject to fits of melan
cholia and had died when so affected at
the age of 63.
Dr. Tuttle testified that he had gone to
the house of Mr. Young in Alhambra in
response to a telephone message on Sun
day night and found General Campbell in
his nightshirt raving violently. He
brought him back to reason after giving
him some bromide. The doctor also testi
fied to several other attacks of violence
which had overcome his patient on subse
quent occasions.
The general then cross-examined the
witness ably and wound up by asking him
if he believed him insane. The answer
was "Yes, sir," upon which the cross
examiner replied that that was what he
wanted to know.
Then General Campbell went into a dis
se:tation on spiritual control, under which
he claims to have acted for the last six
months. Spirits, he said, wrote his corre- '
spondence and did ail his work for him. !
He could bring the faces of his familiar
spirits before his audience. If he could do
that, the court would be convinced that
he was not insane. If he could not he
was crazy.
The case excited great interest and the
courtroom was full of people. Judge
Vandyke came in early during the exam
ination, sat with Judge Smith and listened
with great attention to General Campbell's
talk.
While telling his story the general tried
to hypnotize Dr. Ainsworth, one of the
medical examiners, and seemed quite dis
appointed that he did not succeed. There
being no doubt about Campbell's lunacy,
he was ordered to Highlands. The cer
tificate was signed by Drs. Ainsworth,
Cochrane and Brainerd.
General Campbell came here from
Kansas and was a prohibition advocate.

IMPORTANT DECISION.
Rights and Privilege* of Benevolent So-
cieties Hrflned.
LOS ANGELES, Cat,., June 23.â Judee
Shaw of the Superior Court handed down
an important decision this forenoon touch
ing the rights and privileges of benevolent
societies. The case which brought forth
this decision was that of Brun against the
board of directors of Societe Francaise
Mutuelle. Brun claimed > that the late
election of the board was illegal and caused
a recount in court, which, however, did
not affect the result as returned by the
canvassing board of the society. Brun
contended that votes had been accepted
which, by the terms of the by-laws, should
have been rejected for non-payment of
dues after two months. The court held
that, if after two months the society ac
cepted back dues, it forfeited its right to
exclude, notwithstanding the stipulation
of the by-laws. The decision concluded as
follows:
"This custom, so long continued and
wed known, would have the effect to
change, or rather destroy, the by-laws,
even if they were couched in language
strong and explicit enough to cause for
feiture without noticÂ« or official declara
tion. Such lont'-continued practice oper
ates as an estoppel against the society.
Findings will be made tor the defendants."
PASTOR ROWARDS STANDING.
Los Angeles Presbytery Takes His Case
Under Con si-deration.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 23. â It
seems that the insubordination case of
Rev. Burt Estes Howard, late pastor of
the Westminster Presbyterian Church
here, which was voted out of existence by
the General Assembly recently at Saratoga,
N. V., has not been fully disposed of; or,
rather, Rev. Mr. Howard is about to be
given a rehearing. In view of this the
Los Angeles Presbytery, which met at
Immanuel Church this afternoon, has the
matter under consideration.
About fifty ministers and a large num
ber of the congregation was present.
L. F. Laverty, the moderator, opened the
session with payer. P. D. Young, who
acted as secretary, r ad the official report
of the General Assembly, sustaining the
action of the synod in regard to Rev. Burt
Estes Howard, with explanatory notes.
A committee to draft minutes with refer
ence to the report was appointed as
follows: A. Barker. N. H. G. Fife, A. A.
Dinsruore.
The reports, which were presented at the
congregational meeting of the First Pres
byterian Church on the night of June 17,
were read and J. H. Stewart, Robert
Strong, Rev. Mr. Hartley and Eiders Con
ger and Yates were appointed as a com
mittee to consider the letter written by
Rev. Burt Estes Howard ana report a res
olution.
SPIRITUALISTS AROUSED.
Professor Alexander's Alleged Expose
Results in a Challenge.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 23.â A gen
tleman calling himself Professor Alexan
der has succeeded in drawing upon himself
the animosity of the spiritualists oi this
city.
Alexander arrived about ten days ago
and advertised that he would outdo "all
the tricks of all the mediums under the
sun." His alleged expose came off last
Thursday evening to a crowded house, and
judging irom hisses and catcalls, which
many of his tricks brought forth, a large
proportion of those present must have
been spirituals.
Alexander was very much annoyed at
such treatment, and expr.-ssed himself in i
language more emphatic taan polite re
garding the local followers of the occult.
Two days afterward Professor Tatuni,
from among the spiritualists, issued a
spirited challenge to Alexander to meet
tne challenger in the fiercest of "occult"
combats on the platform. Professor Alex
ander comes back at the unbeliever in
spooks and hobgoblins, naming Burbank
Theater as the place for the "showdown."
Alexander not only shows his willingness
for a contest for points, but declares In his
reply to the spookist that he will forfeit
$10 to any charitable institution in Los
Angeles if he cannot duplicate all the
"tricKs" of the spiritualists and go them
several better.

City Fathers l'ttttioned to Close llusi
Â»!Â»â¢Â»Â« Houses on Sunday.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 23.â From
time immemorial it has been the custom
of certain tradespeople in Los Angeles to
keep their places of business open a por
tion of every Sunday. Others of the busi
ness men have been willing to close on
Sundays, but could not be at the disad
vantage of permitting their competitors to
gather in all the Sunday dimes. Much
against their will they have met this Sun
day competition by doing business on the
Sabbath themselves.
Messrs. Tate and Booth appeared before
the council to-day bearing a monster pe
tition, bound in book form and entitled' as
follows: "Petition to the Hon. Mayor
and City Council of the city of Los An
geles, for an ordinance prohibiting the
keeping open on Sunday of all mercantile
business, etc." This petition is indorsed
by the Los Angeles Council of Labor, the
Retail Clerks' Association, the Plasterers'
Association, the LO3 Angeles Council of
Building Trades, the Barbers Association
and 8370 voters and taxpayers of the city.
The laboring men are behind the peti
tion and have been at work upon it for the
past two months. They claim that not a
single name was taken that did not repre
sent a voter or a taxpayer. The petition
was referred to the committee on morals.

LOS ANGELES, Cal.. June 23.â Coroner
Campbell was summoned this afternoon
to Lordsburg to hold an inquest upon the

sulted from heart trouble.
FIERCE FIRE IN RED BLUFF.
A dumber of Dwelling â Â« and Hums Were
Consumed.
RED BLUFF, Cal., June 23.â About 2
o'clock this afternoon, when the wind
from the north was blowing almost a gale,
a fire originated in a shed in the rear of
the residence of J. C. Turner. Before the
engines could get to work the fire had
leaped to a two-story frame building be
longing to J. F. Pendleton and occupied
by S. S. Clapp. Beyond Clapp's home was
an open space several hundred yards in
width, which stayed the fire's progress in
that direction.
With two fires burning, all the force
which two steam fire-engines could bring
to bear was required, the only surprise is
that the destruction was confined to two
half blocks. To complicate matters engine
No. 1 broke down and was useless for
about fifteen minutes, after which it was
patched up to work at about half force.
The principal losers are: Samuel Lewis,
J. P. Saderlund, J. N. Gregg, Newt Miller,
G. W. Madison and J. F. Pendleton.
The sodawater factory ami cement works
of G. W. Madison, and many sheds, hay
barns and stables were also destroyed.
An infant child of Mrs. James Maloney
had its clothes burned off, but was not
seriously injured.
So rapid was the progress of the rire that
several horses and cows were burned to
death, and a magnificent span of pacers
valued at $500 belonging to J. j. Grinnell
were only taken from the stable after the
building was all in flames. The total loss
exceeds $20,000, and the insurance is about
$12,000.

BRIBERY IN THE
DAWSON CASE,
George Kinsey Tells How
He Left Los Angeles
for Phoenix.
SUPPLIED WITH FUNDS.
Railroaded From One Place to
Another by an Agent of
Mrs. Dawson.
SHADOWED BY DETECTIVES.
Defendant Wi'l Swear That She Kn.ws
Nothing About the Kinseys'
Movements.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 23.â George
Kinsey, formerly of Los Angeles and now
a resident of Kansas City, went on the
witness-stand tbis morning in the Dawson
divorce case and confessed that he had
been bribed by A. A. Eckstrom, a paper
hanger of Los Angeles, to leave Los An
geles with his wife. Eckstrom, the plain
tiff contends, was employed by Mrs.
Dawson. The witness said Eckstrom sent
for him, and when he went to see him told
him that he ought not to make the depo
sitions that he contemplated doing, and
atked him to leave the coast until after
June. Eckstrom offered him $50 and all
expenses, and told him that he would not
want him to go north, would rather he
would go south, and did not want him to
correspond with any one while away.
Kinsey said he wanted more money, and
Eckstrom agreed to give it to him. Eck
strom asked him to go to Arizona with
his wife. It was so agreed, and with
money in their pockets which Eckstrom
had given them and railroad tickets which
were purchased with Eckstroni's money
the Kinseys went to Phoenix, Ariz.
Mrs. Kinsey, the witness said, had told
him to accept Eckstrcim's offer, but his
mother, Kinsey said, told him that she
did not think it was right. Kinsey had a
letter of introduction to G. A. Smith of
Phoenix, Ariz. When he reached there he
presented the letter, and later Smith gave
him $25 and told him the next payment
would be in ten days. Kinsey received
several letters of introduction from Eck
strom through the mail after he had ar
rived in Phoenix. Before leaving Los
Angeles Kinsey said Eckstrom told him
he would be taken care of at Phoenix.
About ten days after Smith had paid him
$.5 the Kinseys went to Kansas City.
Smith bought ;hem tickets and gave them
about $10 additional. The Kinseys reached
Kansas City in April and the witness ob
tained employment in a dry-goods store.
There were about 400 employes in the
store. The witness had charge of a soda
fountain. His salary was $50, and the
witness said he is still in the employ of"
the store and wa? given a le:ive of absence
so that he could cjine to Seattle.
The witness said he had received a num
ber of letters while in Kansas City from
Eckstrom. They were not signed, and in
accordance with a request from Eekstrom
he returned them to him. The witness
aho received several telegrams relating to
money matters which were not signed.
On June 9, the witness said, hfi wrote to
Mr. Eckstrom that he was being watched
by detectives.
In answer to a question from General
Carr the witness said that he knew he was
watched because when he went to the cen
eral delivery for his mail he always met a
man who followed him home. In answer
to I he letter written on June 9 the witness
sai<l he received a telegram from Eck
strom, which read as follows:
"Chance instantly. Will send you mon
ey by teleirrain. Answer." [Not sieneri.]
The witness said he came to Seattle at
General Carr's request.
Mr. Ronald sain that the defense had no
knowledge whatever of the alleged bribery
of t:e Kinseys. Eckstrom, he said, knew
Mrs. Dawson 's mother, but Mrs. L>awson
would swear that she never had anything
to do with getting the Kinseys out of tne
way, nor did she know anything about their
leaving. ___^_________

MA KE ISLAND COURT- MARTIAL.
Patted. Assistant Naval Paymaster Web
ster in Serious Trouble.
VALLEJO, Cal., June 23.â The Secre
tary of the Navy has ordered Passed As
sistant Paymaster Edwin B. Webster,
D. S. N., to be court-martialed, as a result
of the court of inquiry held at the Navy
yard a couple of weeks ago. The court
will convene at the Navy-yard Friday of
this week. Webster is now on board of
the receiving ship Independence under
arrest. The following officers have been
detailed as members of the court: Presi
dent, Captain Henry L. Howison; mem
bers, Commander Henry E.Nichols, Lieu
tenant-Commander Fred M. Symonds,
Lieutenant-Commander F. J. Drake,
Lieutenant Henry T. Mayo, Pay Inspec
tor W. W. Woodhull, Paymaster Henry
T. Skelding. The officer to act as judge
advocate of the court is now on the road
out from Washington, he being detailed
especially for this purpose. Paymaster
Webster is charged with having obtained
$2500 as a cash bond as security for W. J.
Tobin of this city, who went out as his
clerk on the Yorktown, and has failed to
return the same, Mr. Tobin now being out
of the service.
COPPER MINES TO REOPEN.
Activity in Copperopolis Which Will
Benefit Stockton.
STOCKTON, Cal., June 23.â The Cop
peropolis mines are to be reopened. They
have been closed for the past three years,
j as the price of copper has not been high
enough to admit of their being worked
with profit. The property belongs to the
Ames estate of Boston, and its representa
tive has now decided to work it again.
The representative is now in Arizona, but,
according to a local merchant who is
Dosted in the matter, will be here next
week on his way to the mines. The name
of the representative of the Ames estate
the local man would not disclose, but he is
sure that the valuable mines will soon give
plenty of work to local men.
If the Copperopolis mines start again,
as now appears to be certain, it will re
! dound to Stockton's advantage, for when
I they were in operation this city was made
J the base of supplies for everything used
j by the miners. They did a greatdealmore
I buying here than do the gold miners
I farther up the road. For this reason the
local merchants will be interested in the
statement that they will soon reopen.
There has never been any doubt as to
the productiveness of the mines' at Cop
peropoli*. They are sÂ«id to be far richer
than the great Anaconda in Montana that
was recently sold to a foreign syndicate for
a fabulous sum. The great difficulty has
I been operating them and getting the prod
| uct to market. The shafts are some dis
tance from the railroad, and if they are
opened up again on a larger scale, as is
contemplated, a branch road may be run
from the Milton line to Copperopolis.

POCATELLO DEMOCRATION.
Willis Sweet's Return to Idaho From the
St. /.ohm Convention.
POCATELLO, Idaho, June 23. â This
morning at 3 o'clock a large delegation of
citizens with a silver band met the west
bound passenger at the depot to welcome
Hon. Willis Sweet upon his return home
from the National Convention at St. Louis.
As the train approached the depot the
band played the National quickstep air,
and when Mr. Sweet alighted from bis car
cheer upon cheer rang upon the air.
Colonel Ferguson, on behalf of Pocatello,
warmly welcomed Mr. Sweet in a pleasant
vein and said that they were there to prove
their hearty appreciation of his action as a
delegate at St. Louis and to let people at
large know how determined Idaho was in
the great silver light which is now being
waged. , ,
Mr. Sweet responded in an effective way,
recalling touching and. awe-inspiring inci
dents of the St. Louis convention and the
admiration with which Senator Teller was
received, even by his political enemies,
when he announced his final determina
tion to leave the party which he j had sup
ported all his life. The train then . de
parted with Mr. Sweet for Boise City. - v,:'

ASTORIA AND ITS
NATURAL WEALTH,
A Fresh Water Inland Port
of Great Commercial
Importance.

Headquarters of the - Salmon-
Packing Industry of the
Northwest.

ments to Capita!.
ASTORIA, Ok., June 22.â Astoria is sit
uated at the mouth of the Columbia River,
it>:ream discharging nearly or quite as
much water as the Mississippi pours into
the Gulf of Mexico and draining a section
of country greater in extent than the en
tire area of the New England States, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West :
Virginia and Ohio combined, or about
10 square miles. In a word, it is com
puted that the Columbia water-shed covers ;
an area equal n> that of one-sixth of the
whole of the United States.
For hundreds of miles inland from its
mouth (with the exception of obstructions
at trie Cascades and the Dalles which are
already under course of removal by the
general Government) this magnificent
river affords free navigation for river
steamers, by which the diversified products
of the imrnens 1 section of country tribu
tary to it may cc conveyed either to mar
ket for home consumption or to Astoria,
at the month of the river for shipment to
foreign or domestic ports.
From the point where the Columbia j
enters into the Pacific Ocean the country
it traverses has ail the diversified re
sources of an agricultural, pomolo<:ical,
pastoral and timber and mineral section.
For nearly 200 miles inland along its
course the country bordering on either
Bide of the river is darK with a heavy
growth of the very finest merchantable
timber, while its waters are alive with the
unexcelled Chinook salmon and numerous
other varieties of food fishes, the whole
now constituting one of Astoria's staple
industries, giving employment to an army
of fishermen and necessitating the dis
bursement in this one industry alone of
more than $1,500,000 annually.
A single glance at the geographical posi
tion of the city of Astoria, distant only
ten miles from the Pacific Ocean, should
Map Showing the Location of Astoria and Surrounding Country.
be sufficient to convince the most incredu- 1
lous that, if the chief seaport of the prod- j
nets of the Columbia River basin must be j
at the mouth of the great river of the
West, Astoria's location is altogether un
approachable.
The distance from the sea into the har- â¢
bor limits of Astoria is but ten miles, so j
that the cost of bringing a vessel in
from sea is necessarily less than at any i
other harbor accessible to deep-sea ships :
on the North Pacific coast. With a straight
channel at the entrance to the river not :
less than two miles wide, and with thirty
feet of water at mean low tide, subject to a ;
rise of from six to ten feet at high water,
with a fair wind vessels of iarge tonnage
C&B often dispense with the aid of a bar ;
tug and sail safely to anchorage in front
ol the city. Astoria has a water frontage |
of five and a half miles, where ships of ,
any tonnage can lay at the various
wharves or come to anchor in the stream.
Though situated so close to the open
ocean Astoria has the special, exclusive
and decided advantage of being a fresh
water harbor, a blessing duly appreciated â 
by every salt-water navigator bringing his
ship's barnacled-covered bottom into port. ;
That destructive pest, the teredo or pile
worm, cannot exist in Astoria harbor, i
Piling on the water front of Astoria, !
driven thirty or forty years ago, is to-day
sound and in serviceable condition.
The ravages of the teredo upen wharves j
and logs at salt-water ports can be par- j
tially estimated when it is stated that ;
Seattle, on Puget Sound has inaugurated j
work on a ship canal, which will connect i
the water of the sound with Lake Wash
ington, a body of fresn water to the east of j
that city, the work costing $5,000,000. It
js a saving of time and money to ship-
I owners to have the vast accumulation of
barnacles and other marine growths inci
dent to a long voyage, and collected
below the water line of their vessels, as
1 effectually cleared off as though they have
been scraped in a drydock. This benen"- i
cial result accrues to every ship that visits J
Astoria, the only fresh-water seaport on !
the I'acitic Coast.
The great jetty at the" mouth of the j
j Columbia River was commenced by the j
Government in 1885. and is now com- |
! pleted. The Board of United States En- j
gineers, which devised the plan of its !
construstion, estimated its cost at about
13,000,000, but nature itself has so ably
assisted in crowning with success the bril- ;
liant conception and design of the engi
neers that it will be finished at a cost of !
$500,000 less than the original estimate.
The beneficial effect of the construction
of this jetty has met the most Banpuine
expectations of its promotors. The jetty \
| has been extended more than four miles ;
seaward in a northwesterly direction,
starting from the south bank, thus virtu- !
ally contracting the immense body of
water flowing out of the moutu of the
river into a space of le^s than four miles,
instead of eight nii!e.> as formerly. The
I bar nas virtually ceased to exist.
This jetty makes Astoria a seaport of the i
first magnitude. There is an open, straight,
wide and easy channel, through which j
any vessel may enter as easily as into any j
harbor in the world.
Astoria is the headquarters of the I
salmon-packing industry of the Northwest, '
and distributes yearly the entire pack of j
the Columbia River, amounting to almost
500,000 easel yearly, valued at $3,000,000, j
'. and consuming 00,000 boxes of tin plate, j
I Formerly the greater portion of this pack !
w;is shipped foreign, but as the peerless !
qualities of the royal ChinooK became |
more generally recognized, the homo de
mand increased correspondingly, and now j
; almost tne entire pack finds a ready sale i
in the United States. In wages and sup- .
i plies the amount paid out by the canners
ASTORIA, OREGON, ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
: in Astoria for each season's operations i
foots up about $1,500,000.
With the enactment of proper laws for
the protection of tish and the establish- j
ment and maintenance of hatcheries on
an adequate scale, the salmon industry
may be made yerpetual and must always
occupy a prominent place among the in
fractions to competing lines of railroad.
Lasi year the total amount of salmon dis
tributed from Astoria, including the
spring and fall parks on the Colnmbia ana
fall packs at other points tributary to As
toria, was 658,600 cases, of which 481,600
rases comprised the spring pack of the Co
lumbia River.
With the completion of the railroad now
under construction to transcontinental
connection, Astoria will at once become a
formidable comri?titor for the handling of
: the Alaska salmon pack, averaging ov<jp
750,000 cases yearly. At present the bulk
; of this business is controlled in San Fran
' cisco, but Astoria's advantage geograph
ically places her in a position to bid on
more than even terms against her Califor
nia rival. The establishment of a regular
and frequent steamer servic; between As
toria and Alaskan points offers to capital
indurpment3 which will readily command
attention.
The city of Astoria has thi- year com
pleted a system of water works in which
its citizens feel a high degree of justifiable
pride. The works are of much more than
passing interest, both by reason of their
exceptional completeness, which an intel
ligent use of the natural advantages has
made possible, and by reason of the mag
: nitude of the results achieved by a very
moderate outlay.
The supply is taken from Bear Creek, a
i mountain stream 11}^ miles from Astori3.
1 The elevation above tide water of the di
i verting point on Bear Creek is 580 feet.
It terminates in a reservoir of 6,250,000
gallons capacity. As a result of the com
pletion of these works and an abundance- of
hydrants connected with the street mains,
the city is favored with fire protection not
surpassed anywhere. The main line con
duit discharges on the new reservoir at an
elevation of 420 feet. The total cost of the
works amounted to $220,700, which has
been raised by the issue of bonds.
For many years Astoria has had the
reputation of bf ing the largest city in the
United States having no railroad connec
tion. Many efforts have been exerted by
its citizens to induce capital to construct
a road to transcontinental connection, and
more than once companies have been
incorporated and the work commenced,
but from a combination of circumstances
it failed of completion.
During last year, however, the citizens
of Astoria raised a magnificent subsidy,
which has resulted in the incorporation of
the Astoria and Columbia River Railroad
by A. B. Hammond, a capitalist of Mon
tana, and his associates, who are under
contract to build the road in three years,
from June 1, 1X95. It is confidently ex
pected, however, that two years from that
date will see Astoria connected by rail
with Portland on the Willamette. The
Astoria and Columbia River Railroad,
now under construction, comprises sixty
two miles of line eastward between Astoria
and Goble (where the Northern Pacific
Railroad crosses the Columbia) together
with fourteen miles of line (Seashore" road)
acquired by the Astoria and Columbia
River Railroad Company, extending from
Youngs River and Bay at the west end of
the city of Astoria to Seaside. Also a line
three miles in extent (Flavel Extension)
will be built from Warrenton on the Sea
shore road, to the towosite of Flavel at
the mouth of the Columbia River.
The line from Flavel to and through
Astoria will be built and completed by
July 30 of. the present year, and into this

city for summer seaside excursions before
the 30th of this month.
It is a source of great satisfaction to the
citizens of Astoria, who have so liberally
subsidized the A. and C. Railroad Com
pany to build this line, to observe that
great care is being exercised that a road as
nearly perfect as possible shall be made.
Easement curves and grades are to be pro
vided for, substantial structures and
bridges constructed â first cost in this in
stance does not oblige the engineer to sac
rifice the good line he has macie out. The
best 75-pound steel rails are to be used
throughout. These have been purchased
in England, and tureecargoes were shipped
to Astoria in January and February last
and should arrive by the middle of this
month.
The line follows the left bank of the Co
lumbia Iliver from Goble to the mouth of
the river, a down grade in the direction of
the heavy traffic. The thousands of vis
itors who annually flock from the interior
to the favorite seaside resorts of Clatsop
Beach will be able this summer to take
the cars at Astoria, reaching the ocean
after a pleasant fifteen-mile ride. There
is no finer bathing beach to be found in
the world and doubtless this business will
grow, as the oeauties of the seashore of
Oregon become more generally known.

SALT LAKE HANE MUSUSNDS.
The Assets More Than Sufficient to Pay
Depositors in Full.
SALT LAKE, Utah, June 23. âThe Bank
of Salt Lake closed its doors this morning
and notices were posted that the sole pro
prietor, J. H. Bacon, had made an assign
ment to Frank W. Ross for the benefit of
the creditors of the institution. The lia
bilities are placed at $300,000 and the as
sets are valued at $400,000. ' The cause of
the suspension was the refusal of the New
York correspondents of the bank to honor
drafts falling due to-day. The liabilities
are in great part to local depositors. Mr.
Bacon says the assets if properly realized
will be more than sufficient to pay every
body in full.
The bank was established in 1888 as a
private banking institution and in 1892 it
was converted into a National under the
title of the American National Bank. In
1894 it was changed again to a private
bank and under its first title, the Bank of
Salt Lake. This is the only instance of a
bank failure in Salt Lake during the past
two years.
MISHAP TO THE ROVER.
The Taclit Tangled in the Kelp at

BANTA CRUZ, Cat,., June 23.â Word
was brought here iate this afternoon that
I the yacht Rover had gone ashore at
Wilders Beach up the coast. It was sup
â  posed that the Rover had gone to Mon
terey, as Captain Bruce had announced
1 last niprht before he left for San Francisco

I the yacht had run acround at Wilders it
' was "feared she had struck a heavy gale

SUSUOA CHURCH BERNED.
Inadequate Water Supply Causes a Loss
of $10,000.
SONOMA, Cal., June 23.â St. Francis
Catholic Church on Napa street was burned
to the ground this afternoon. All the
treasures of the church, including valuable
vases, candlesticks, etc., gifts of the late
Mrs. Robert Johnson, were lost. The con
vent and rectory, though badly scorched,
were saved. The loss is estimated at $10
--000, well insured. The fire has demon
strated the inadequate water supply, and
will probably bring about an improvement
in the present system or cause the con
struction of new water works.

Commission.
SENT TO GATHER DATA.
Instructed lo Find Out All He
Can Regarding the Herds
of Seals.
READY TO LEAVE SEATTLE.
Englishmen, Canadians and Japanese
Go as Guests of the Amer
icans.
SEATTLE, Wash., June 23.â President
David Starr Jordan of Stanford University,
who has been placed at the head of the
new Seal Commission created by the last
Congress, arrived in this city from San
Francisco last night, and went to the
Rainer-Grand, where he met the British
and Canadian commissioners, who will ac
company the commission north. Dr.
Leonard Stejneger and Frederick A, Lucas
of the National Museum, who are of the
commission, have not yet arrived in the
city, and Dr. Jordon stated to-night that,
on account of their delay, the Albatross,
on which the party will make the trip,
will not leave until next Wednesday morn
ing.
Dr. Jordan to-night talked to a Call
correspondent concerning the trip. The
British and Canadian Commissioners re
fused to be interviewed. No one of the
American Commission knows what in
formation the foreign Commissioners will
seek or what they will do after they pet
there. They are strangers to the Ameri
cans and go on the Albatross as guests.
They were appointed by their home gov
ernments, but their instructions are not
known. They stated that it would be
difficult for them to reach the desired
northern points, and Dr. Jordan and his
commission was asked to take them alone;
as his guests. The British Commissioners
are D'Arcy W. Thompson of the Uni
versity of Dundee, Scotland, Chairman
of the British Commission, and a Mr.
Hamilton of England, who went north by
way of Japan, and who will join the
Albatross party in Bering Sea. James
Macoun is the Canadian Commissioner,
Two Japanese Commissioners will join the
party when the Albatross reaches Japan
seas.
"The United States Government," said
Dr. Jordan^- is evening, "has created this
commission and sends it to the north, in
order that it may ascertain everything
concerning the habits, life and history of
the seals, as well as to learn a3 near as
possible the number of seals not only on
the American islands, but on all other
islands and in all other waters where seals
can be found. That is what we go north
for, and we will endeavor to the best of
our ability to get at the facts. I have been
given instructions and have in my pocket
thirteen questions, which the Government
wants answered. I have given, in sub
stance, the object of the trip, without
giving out any of the questions or any of
the instructions.
"There is every reason why the com
mission should be successful in its work.
We have the Albatross at our command,
good men to man her, and our accommo
dations will be all that we can desire.
"A wora about the commission: No
two men are more competent to deal with
the scientific aspects of the question than
are Dr. Stejneger and Professor Lucas.
The former, while in Norway, was recog
nized as the most learned student of the
anatomy of birds in the world. Because
ot that he was asked by Prof ssor Baird
to accept a position in the National Mu
seum, where he has been for twelve years
as curator of reptiles. He has contributed
many articles on birds and was in charge
of one expedition to the seal islands. I
have proof-sheets of his report in my
pocket, which the Government of the
United States looks upon as a model of
its kind. He also had charge of the expe
dition to Commander Islands, which
looked into all possible relics of the sea
cow, which was once found in the north,
but which has been extinct for a half
century.
"Professor Lucas is vrelt known as a stu
dent of anatomy, has written extensively
on birds and is the author of most of the
articles on higher animals in Johnson's
Encyclopedia. Joseph Murray is another
member of the commission. By reason of
his position as Special Treasury Agent on
the seal islands he has become familiar
with the economic aspects of fisheries in
all its details.
"Charles H. Murray, the naturalist of
the Albatross, has been a member of the
United States Fish Commission for twelve
years and has been on the Albatross since
it was turned over by the Naval Depart
ment to the commission. Captain J. F.
Moser, commander of the Albatross, is a
member of the commission and is re
garded as one of the wisest and most ca
pable members of the naval staff, and, as
it happens, is an old friend of Lieutenant
Austin F. Knight, Mrs. Jordan's eldest
brother. George F. Clark of Stanford will
be secretary of the commission.
"We go north by way of Sitka to Una
laska, and for the benefit of California
people let me say that Unalaska is the
only place where we will receive mail
during the summer. From Unalaska we
go to Prybilof Islands, the most important
of the American seal islands because of
the discussion as to how far the jurisdic
tion of the United States extends about
them. Next the Commander Islands of
Russia will receive our attention, and we
will after that visit all the rookeries in
Roten Island and on the Kurile Islands,
which belong to Japan.
"Of course, the itinerary of the latter
part of the summer will depend on the
weather and the necessity of going in
search of coal. All the details of the trip
have been left to me. We will return about
October 1, and some or all of tne commis
sion may return by way of the Japan
steamers."

SAN JOSE'S WILL CONTEST
The Celebrated Parker Case Is
Gradually Drawing to a
Close.
Lady Witnesses Testify as to the
Character and Conduct of the
Contestant.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 23. -The Parker
will case is gradually drawing to a close.
The respondents rested their case at noon
and contestants began offering testimony
in rebuttal this afternoon. Mrs. Delia
Binnott of San Francisco told a story of
the courtship of George H. Parker and
Mrs. Husbands. She said that Parker
had offered to settle $5000 and then $10,000
on Mrs. Husbands if she would marry
him, but she refused to do so.
At the opening of court this morning
' the respondents offered a certified copy of
the minutes in the suit of Charles Parker
against George H. Parker for slander in
I 1386. It was asserted by the contestant,
i Emma Parker, that this was a suit for
; $10,000 for alienating a wife's affections.
i It appeared that the action in question
was for slander. The case was decided in
iavor of the defendant, George H. Parker.
Mrs. Delia Sinnott of this city was then
put on the stand. She testified that she
was acquainted with Mrs. Husbands, the
lady who claimed that Georee 11. Parker
i at the time of his death was engaged to
] marry her. She said Pnrker wanted Mrs.
1 Husbands !o marry nini, and hat offered
; to settle $.^OOO on Mrs Husbands if she
! would marry him. He finally offered to
give Mrs. Husbands $10,000. She said
Mrs. Husbands subsequently told her that
! she (Mrs. Husbands) was very foolish to
, let the opportunity to marry George H.
j Parker slip by. She had twice met Mrs.
I Emma Parker. The first time was in
| July, 1894, at her mother's house in this
rity. This was shortly after the death of
, George Parker. Mrs. Emma Parker said
: that she was in California to break the
: will. She wanted Miss Sinnott to help
j her in the case, and she would give Miss
Sinnott a diamond ring and goiden crest
j worn by Geortte Parker. She had seen the
: diamond ring in question on George
Parker's hand. She had never been en
i gaged to marry George H. Parker.
Mrs. Emma A. Smith of San Francisco
! was the next witness. She first met George
! H. Parker In IVW.1 V W. Her ln:sband ami
! Parker had been intimate friend?. She
never questioned ParKer's sanity, and
: knew him to be a generous and liberal pro
; vider for his wife. She knew this, because
she had often done the shopping for Mrs.
i Parker, her husband always providing lib
erally.
The witness testified that Parker had
| often spoken of the bad woman his >on
' had married, and said he did not want her
to have a cent of his money. He knew

she was bad, because he had thoroughly
investigated it for himself. He had told
the witness that for his indiscretion in
marrying the contestant he had cut off his
son without a dollar.
The last witness for the respondents
was Mrs. G. L. Smitft of San Francisco.
She had known George H. Parker for a
number of years, and denied that Parker
had showed any signs of mental weakness.
The contestants began offering testi
mony in rebuttal, by reading the deposi
tion of Caroline Page of New Haven,
Conn. The deponent is a cousin of Emma
Parker, and claims to have known her
from childhood. She said she had never
heard that Emma Parker was in a fast
house in Meriden, Conn., or anywhere
else. On cross-examination Mrs. Page ad
mitted it wm possible Emma Parker
might have lived an immoral life without
her hearing of it.
Mrs. Emma L. Parker, the contestant,
was put on the stand in rebuttal this
afternoon, and made a general denial of
the evidence introduced by the respond
ents during the trial. This closed the case
for the contestant, and the respondents
announced their testimony all in.
The issues upon which the case will be
submitted will be argued at 9 o'clock to
morrow morning. It is intimated that the
contestant will abandon the attempt to
break the will, except as to the subsidiary
legacy to Jane Poraeroy. It is thought a
verdict will be reached before the end of
the week.

E. Jewitt Saw a Dead Man
Pinioned Beneath
the Debris.
PATRICK M'KEOWN DEAD
The Proprietor of the 111-Fated
Brighton House Suc
cumbs.
SOME ONE IS SADLY TO BLAME-
All Work on the Ruins Suspended
for Fear That the Adjoining Build
ing Will Share the Same Fate.
Under a mass of debris and heavy tim- j
bers of the wrecked lodging-house on [
Mint avenue and Fifth street lies the body I
of an unfortunate and unknown laborer, j
buch is the statement of E. Jewitt, a
laborer at 148 Fifth street, who says that
he saw the body at the lime that he as- !
sisted in removing poor Jesse May from
the basement a few minutes after the
Brighton lodging-house toppled over into
Mint avenue on Monday afternoon.
From midnight Monday until the pres
ent time nothing has been done toward

searching in the ruins for the body o:
bodies, should there happen to be mon
than one. In this, as in many matter:
where public officials are concerned, th<
work is progressing very slowly, and yes
terday was consumed in an effort to faster
the blame and responsibility for the affan
upon some one. Meanwhile thousands o
people stood around the ruins and won
dered why something had not been an.
was not being done besides ollicially in
vestigating.
They wondered why no efforts were be
ing made toward recovering the body o
the Door workingman that was lvinÂ§
crushed under heavy timbers in the debris
and ooze of the basement.
Chief Engineer Sullivan, Assistant
Dougherty and the other officials of thÂ«
Fire Department gave their explanation!
as to why the work haa been stopped, say
insrthat * the foundation of the adjoining
building was not firm enough to warrant
the removal of the wreckage. The Chief
ordered the owner of the building in ques
tion to brace up the walls and foundation
to prevent it from toppling over into tin
ruins of the lodging-house.
In the afternoon E. Jewitt took District
Engineer Dougherty and several other- to
a spot in the basement and showed them
when; he had seen the body of a dead man
soon after the crash took place. He says
that since the side wall had settled the
body is now jammed against the street
embankment.
Coroner Hawkins made an inspection of
the premises in or.li r to be informed as to
the situation when holding the inquests
on the bodies at the Morgue.
The question of responsibility caused
much discussion, each party directly or
indirectly interested claiming that he is
not to blame. It is likely that some one
will be called to task for the accident.
â  From all accounts neither ti>e architect
nor the sub-ion tractor took the trouble to
secure a permit from the proper authorities
for the alterations of the building, and the
Fire Wardens did not take the trouble to
see if the work was being done under a
permit or not.
Late last evening PatricK McKeown, one
of the victims of the accident, died in the
Receiving Hospital, after suffering great
agony for over thirty hours. He was the
proprietor of the Brig ton House.
ANOTHER VICTIM DEAD
Patrick McKoown Dies From Being
Crushed Between Two Large
Timbers.
Patrick McKeown, who, with his wife,
conducted the Brighton House, died of his
injuries last evening in the Receiving
Hospital. He was in one of the middle
rooms on the second story when the house
went down. A.S the structure toppled over
McKeown was caught between two large
beams, which pres.-ed upon him so Hard
that he couid hardly breathe, it was ne
y to cut the timbers to remove the
sufferer. He was sent at once to the Ke
ceiving Hospital, where the doctors said
that the man's injuries, which were inter
nal, wrre of such a character that his re
covery would be doubtful. He lingered in
great agony until last night, when, at 9:55
o'clock, he died.
The last sacraments of the church were
j performed shortly before by Rev. Father
Jacquet of St. Ignatius College. The
man died surrounded by his wife, relatives
and friend-. He was conscious aim
the last. HisriDÃhad been crushed and
had pierced his lungs. The body was

STOPPED THE WORK
I Chief Suliivan Says That the Ad
joining Building Must Be
Strengthened.
The work of charing away the debris
: was Btopped at midnight Monday by order
;of Chief Sullivan, who decided that i;
! would not be safe to proceed further in
; that line. When the work was stopped
i the top story had been removed and sev-
I eral holes cut in the second floor, which
j now rests in The basement. This was to
I ena!;le the firemen to look for any bodies
j ttiat might be between the two floors, but
c were found.
The Chief's next order was to dirpct J.
T. Kelly and Mr>. Charles K. Pinney, the
j owners of the four-story frame bouse a<i
joining to brace up the east trail and ;
"'jack up" under tne east part of the
building with a long temporary girder in

j tar fresh. The s-oft nature of the sand and

the moist condition of the ground is likely
to let the building down on the east side,
which would result in a crash similar to
that of Monday. He cla ins that the re
mainder of the wrecked building is pre
venting the Kelly building from toppling
over, acting as a brace. Mr. Keliy set to
work to comply with the Chief- order, but
he does so much against his will. He
states that his building is on a linn
foundation and that the side walls rest on
a seven-foot brick wall, with a two-foot
footing.
He claims further that the collapsed
building is no support whatever to his,
but, on the contrary, that the pressure
caused by the weight is pressing against
the bottom of his building and the brick
wall of Use foundation. Ik asserts that
there is no danger, as his house stands as
plumb as the day it was put up eighteen
years ago.
It will take at least another twenty-four
hours to put in the required bracing
against the east wall. Until that is ac
complished no more rubbish, broken
timbers and debris can be removed from
the cellar of the ill-fated building.
BURIED IN THE CELLAR.
E. Jewitt Showed Where the Body
of a Dead Man Is
Lying.
"There is one more man buried in that
pile," said E. Jewitt of 148 Fifth street to
District Kngineer Dougherty and Coroner
Hawkins yesterday afternoon, and he led
the officials to the spot where he said he
saw the body a few minutes after the
building went down. The men went down
the rough ladder into the basement,
picked their way among broken timbers
and piles of brick until they reached a
spot on the east side, midway of the
structure.
"It ;s in there between the side wall and
tbe street embankment." said Jewitt.
"1 was at work cleaning brick under
the rcr.r of the building, when I heard
the tracking of timbers, and instantly 1
r> a [zed what \va< happening. I called to
the men to run, and I sprang to the west
wall, which did not come down, and saved
myself. Alter great difficulty I got out on
the street without any injury, but badly
shaken up. Then I thought of Jesse May,
with whom I had been working, and I
started oack, followed by a number of lire
m a. We picked our way to where I last
saw May and I found him lying there,
bleeding. I caught hold of him, but he
was fast under some timbers. I got hold
of a man's leg and said, 'Jess, is that your
lee?' He said : 'No; it must be the man
who fell on me. For God's sake, help me
out.'
'â¢Some one got a light and we took May
out, but before I went I saw the man he
spoke about. The man had evidently
tried to crawl along the street embank
ment when a big timber caught him
across the middle of the back and he was
'crushed to the ground, his lem lying on
May's body. I saw the man plainly. He
was" lying* face down and bis head was
covered with' blood. I noticed that lie
w.as bald on the top of his head. lam
sure the man was dead. The sidewalk at
that time was several feet above the base
i meat Holt, but it has settled since, antl in
j doing >o it come down inside of where the
nirtn was lying. We carried May out, and
by that tune all my strength was spent, so I
went b< rue to tell my wife tha. I was not
seriously hurt.
"To-day I went down to the Morgue to
see is the man's body "as there, but it was
not, so it must be here."
Dougherty said that there was plenty of
room for a man's body in the position de
scribed by Jewitt, but that it wouid not be
possible to reacu the .lead man until after
the debris and timbers are all out. The
place indicated by Jewitt is a ma

WHO WAS TO BLAME?
Officials Trying: to Fasten the
Responsibility on the
Culprit.
The Coroner and the officials of the Fire
! Department made a long investigation
I yesterday to determine who was respon
i i sible for the accident and the attending
i fatalities. It is needless to say that each
one interested tried to throw the blame
; ! upon some one else. It will no doubt fall
i : upon cither Sibley, Gleason or Davis, the
; i sub-contractors, or perhaps upon all three.
Coroner Hawkins interviewed several of
! \ the workmen. One was Mike Howard, a
i ' laborer, who lives on Twenty-sixth street,
; ! near San Jose avenue. He said that early
Monday morning he noticed that the large
. i iore-and-aft timber under the floor was on
,' a slant. The jackaerews and cribs were
i i also out of place; that they were not
j ! squared up as they should be. Howard
: called the attention of Foreman Davis to it,
t I but the latter said that they were all
i right, and that the timber was just a little
i warped. The jackserews in particular
j were "off," and he did not think they
â¢ | were safe, but he could not do anything.
Here District Engineer Dougherty inter
. posed the statement that Fire Warden
i | McCluskey had made an inspection of the
building early in the morning and found
everything all right.
William Lenahan, a laborer employed
in building the foundation, declared that
i he saw nothing out of tue way with the
, underpinning.
E. D. Davis, Pibley's colored foreman,
stated that at 3 :30 p. m. he was in the base
ment and saw that everything was all
t n k rbt -
An inspection of the wrecked premises
[ by District Engineer Shaughnessy, Fire
' I Marshal Towe and Mr. Pierson, a well-
I j known architect, will probably do much
; j toward fixing the rebponsibility where it
> ! belongs.
They spent considerable time yesterday
afternoon in the basement and found
1 plenty of evidence of either criminal care
-1 lessness or ignorance. Even with the
â  timbers, cribs and jackscrews twisted and
i displaced by the collapse very grave evi
dence of lax methods were discovered. In
the rirst place, those excavating the sand
had next to undermined cribs and sup
' porting blocks. The street enbanknient,
after being planked up, had been braced
by large pieces of timber placed against
the cribs, the intermediate Dlocksand the
fore and alt timber under tne Moor. The
street bank naturally settled and the buig
ing sand pressed against tiie braces, which
in turn pressed in the cribs and other teiu
j porary supports.
With the immense weight of the build
ing pressing downward, the lateral pres
sure from the street embankment oper
ating upon the cribs, the cribs undermined
by the excavators, it Wuuld have been sur
prising to Mr. Shaughnessy if tne building
j had been able to stand.
Considerable has been said about the
water in the basement. Several claim
that the basement is really a quicksand
and that the foundations under the cribs
were washed out by the water that flows
I through the sand.
Coroner Hawkins said that when the in-
I quests are held on the bodies he will have
I all of the evidence he can pet, and if there
I is sufficient to warrant a criminal prosecu
> tion he will cause the arrest of the guilty
parties.
THEY HAD NO PERMIT.
Repairs to the Fifth-Street Build-
ing Apparently Without Legal
Authority.
Seven hours before the building on Fifth I
street came crashing down, burying be-
Death its fatal weight nearly a score of
inmates and passers-by, John McCluskey,
relief engineer and lire warden, went be
neath the building, and, as he states, ex
amined the work carefully. He says he
found it resting upon dibs, not needles as
has Lecn stated. "I would have been
willing to sl-ep there," .said John Mc-
Cluskey. "What the contractors may
have done after I left of course I don't
know. You never can tell what these
contractors are going to do. Of course, I
couldn't anchor there. I had other duties
to attend to."
So far McCloakey's statement seems to
be satisfactory, bill there is one circum
stance upon which neither McCluskey nor
any one else connected with the Fire De
partment seemed to be able to throw any
particular light, upon. That is, by whose
permission the building was beinir re*
i aired at all. It is within the Cre limits,
anJ the ordinance seems clear enough
upon the que-tion of permits necessary to
be obtained and lue manner of obtaining
them for repairs within the City limits.
Yet among those who should be be.it
posted 'the matter seems to be very Lazy.
Inquiry of out- of the Fire Wardens who
was iUperint<'!iiJi!ij_' the w->rk of clearing
away the debris elicited the information
that the work of reconstructing the build
ing was being regularly prosecuted under
a permit issued by the City Superintend
ent of streets. At the headquarters of
that official a permit relating to the prem- ]
ises was readily found, but it failed en- i
tireiy in serving as a warrant for the work j
which was being done. The authority of
the Street Department ends with the street
line. The permits which they issue in re
lation to new buildings are uniform niid i
m:iy be obtained by any onr upon deposit
ing $20 a*< a guarantee of good faith. These
permits simply ullow the grantes to ob
struct one-third of the street with build- |
ins materials for a limited time. Such a j
permit>was on June 10 jrrnn'ed to Adam
Miller for the Fifth-street building. "Per
mits for the reconstruction of buildiiigs
within the fire l'mits may be found at the
office of the Fire I'ej.artmcnt."
At the office of the Fire Commissioners,
Fire Marshal and Fire Wardens they
either bad no record of the permit to 1
Miller or refused to show it. Tii^ clerk
â¢â¢aid the place to pet the information was
from the clerk of the Board of Supervisors.
Here the search practically ended. C'.erk
.(. IÂ». Russell said that all applications for
permits to repair buildings within the fire
limits should come before the *'ire Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors. He
had records of all permits granted, and a
search for six montds back failed to show
that any permit had been granted for the
building which has collapsed. "That set
tles it," said the clerk; "they have got no
permit."
McCluskey, when asked about the per
mit, was very much inclined to evade the
issue. "It is my duty as Fire Warden/
he said, "to examine all the buildings
south of Market and east of Seventh. I
examined the Fifth-street building all
right Monday morning and it was ad safe
and sound. Of course 1 don't know what
may have happened after that"
"Did you demand to see the permit
under which the work was being done?"
McCiuskey was asked.
"Well," he replied, "they had a permit
from the Street Superintendent. They
had to have that before they could tear up
the sidewalk."
"Did you see this permit? " he was
asked.
McCiuskey admitted he hadn't seen the
permit, but it was the Street Superin
tendent's duty to see that no sidewalks
were torn up without a permit, and he
supposed the Street Superintendent had
done his duty.
Then John McCluskey made a most re
markable statement. He said it was not
the custom of Fire Wardens to demand
permits for the mere replacing of a foun
dation, even if it is within the fire limits.
"If the foundation is insecure, " he said,
we serve a notice upon them to repair it.
"If they repair it without notice, we are
glad of it and say nothing about permits."
The Fire Warden seemed to be laboring
under considerable doubt as to just when
a permit was necessary. He finally ad
mitted that if the whole front of a building
was to be torn off a permit would be es
sential, and in such a case he thought the
Fire Warden's duty was to see that the
owner or the contractor had one.
"If you saw such work in course of con
struction," he was asked, "would you de
mand to see the permit? "
"Well, if there was a permit," he said,
"we would honor it. We would see it in
the Dapers and ttien we would be noti
fied." So McCluskey must have known
that there was no permit issued for the re
pairing of the building.
In the General Orders of the Board of
Supervisors the matter seems to have beeu
lucidly stated, and the befogged condition
of the official minds on the subject seems
rather uncalled for. The following is the
section:
Sec. 40. No wooden building within the
fire limits shall be altered, changed or re
paired without permission in writing, signed
by a majority of the Fire Wardens, approved
by a committee on Fire Department and the
Mayor, wnich permit shall fully express the
alterations, changes or repairs allowed, a copy
of which shall be tiled by the grantee, within
two days, in the office of* the Chief Engineer
and Fire Marshal; but no permit shall be
given to increase the Â«ize of said building, ex
cept as provided for iv this order.
Another section provides that it shall
be the duty of the Fire Wardens to see
thut the provisions of this order are car
ried out, and in case of violations they are
instructed to make complaint to a" Po
lice Judge.
A NARROW ESCAPE.
S. L, Shields of Sacramento Came
Near Being One of the
Victims.
A dispatch to The Call from Sacra
mento states that S. L. Shields of that city
narrowly escaped being included in the
j list of wounded or dead of the building
i collapse in San Francisco Monday, having
j left the building but a few minutes before
I the awful catastrophe occurred, after an
interview with Sarah Byrne, one of the
unfortunate victims. In speaking of the
matter Mr. Shields said:
I had engaged toe services of Miss Byrne for
iuv laundry here In Sacramento, aud "just be
fore leaving the City I called at the house to as
certain it she would roiiie up on the following
I day. As I passed into the building I noticed that
I the floor SHnk under my weight, and thought
at the time that the building was unfitted toi
I occupancy. The feeling increased, for wnile
I in conversation with Miss Byrne I could hear
the tlmben in the wall creaking and groaning.
I called the matter to the attention of Miss
]'. yrrie and her relatives, saying: "Do you
hear those sounds? This building la unsafe.' 1
in answer llw^. replied that they had also
: b 'ii Hlarined. but that the contractor had
told the lundlady that everything was per
j fee tly safe.
,\- I : s,M -d out of the building I noticed the
sinking an'! giving of the floor, and
when I got out on the sidewalk, my curiosity
I being nronsed I looked under the building oh
tii south *id<- und found that the stringers of
I the foundation did not rest upon the shoring
by over two inches and seemed to be very in
secure, resting as they did ou a bed of sand
that seemed obe slowly shifting. Shortly
after 1 left the vicinity the building col
lapsed.

that was of any value and piled them on
the sidewalk beside the Mint. During the
day those who had lived in the Brighton
inspected the pile to see if they could re
cognize anything that belonged to them.
Several took away small articles, but a
largÂ» amount was left, evidently being re- ;
garded as not worthy of further trouble.
Upon receiving Chief Sullivan's order
to clear the wood and rubbish from the '
street the owners of the Brighton and the j
contractors at once set a lot of men and
teams to work. The teams were kept on
the move all day, and by night consider
able of the stuff was carted away. A large
force of police were kept on the ground,
their duty being to protect the property
from the thieves who riack to su.cn places \
and to keep the larce crowd of curious and
sympathetic away from the workmen.
CHIEF SULLIVAN'S VIEWS.
He Says the Alteration Was Not
Such as Called for a
Permit.
Chief Sullivan stated last evening that
no permit had bean issued for the work
being done to the building and that none
was needed.
"Putting in a foundation," he said, "is ;
not such an alteration or repair as to re
quire a permit. It is only making the
structure more safe, and no one can pre
vent them from doing that. liaising or
lowering the building would require a
permit, and in that case it would be the
duty of the Fire Wardens to see that they
had it. The only thing they did in this
case that would call for a permit was dig- j
ging under the sidewalk. To do that they '
should have a permit from the Street De- j
partment. If they had that they are all
rieht."
Reverting to the catastrophe the Chief j
said: "It is hard to say where tne blame
lies, but it wa3 a cheap contract and it was i
evidently tho resuli of a 'penny-wise-ar.d
pound-foolish' policy. I was reliably in
formed to-day that Gleason came very
near having a similar accident on a larger ;
scale some time ago. He was raising the j
Langdon, the big five-story hotel on the |
corner of Mason and Ellis streets, when ,
it commenced to shift slowly. Architect i
Frank Shea chanced to come along and
he directed his energies toward saving the
building until far into the night, with
rinal success. Had the Langdon collapsed
as did tliis building the loss of life would I
have been frightful.
"What this City needs is a bureau of
inspection, such as the large Eastern cities
have. These bureaus are composed of
men skilled in architecture nnd construc
tion. Tho results are far more satisfac
tory than can be looked for from men who
have been trained only to put out fires."
The D^ad Victims.
The bodies of Mrs. Ernestine SilverstÂ° ; n
and Jesse May, the two victims of trie
Fifth-street disaster whose injuries re
sulted fatally, were yesterday conveyed
from tbf> Morgue to an undertaking estab
lishment at 122 Eddy street, where ar
rangements will be made for their funeral.
MONTEREY SALMUS CLANERY
Big Catches of the Sportive HÂ»h Interest
CapitnUit*.
MONTEREY, Cal., June 23.â Owing to
the large catch of salmon in Monterey
Bay the Sacramento River Packers' Asso
ciation has decided to start a cannery in
Morteiey. Last week J. P. Haller, the
manager of the company, arrived in Mon
terey and made all necessary arrange
ments for the immediate placing of the
plant. It is now in position and ready for
operation. Mr. Haller says that he
can handle about 1500 salmon per day, and
will employ quite a number of boys and
girls. He expects to pay the fishermen
about 2' 2 0r3 cents per pound for their
fish, which is a great deal better than they
can do on an average Dy snipping to San
Francisco.
The company will al3O handle fruit, and
thus the orchardists will nn<i a home
market. The Sacramento River Packers'
Association is a strong financial concern
and owns two large canneres â one at
Black Diamonn, in Contra Costa County,
and the other at Chipps Island, Solano
County. The establishment of this enter
prise is of great importanc? to the people
of Monterey, as it will furnish work during
the packing season to quite a number of
unemployed people.

The question of the campaign: Do you
wish work and wages?
Work for McKinley is a home industry
in every sense of the phrase.
Eveo* American workshop will be a
McKinlev headquarters this year.
With the Democrats anything is good
that helps to hide the Cleveland record.
For the present the center of the United
States is at Canton, Ohio, and all roads
lead there.
Now that the people no longer wish him
at Washington, Cleveland won't leave even
to go fishing. _
The financial crisis came in with the
Cleveland deficit administration and will
go out with it.
Democracy may be ready for a new de
parture but she has only old back-number
chromos to lead it.
If there is any way to read the Demo
cratic party out of itself Daggctt will do it.
He remembers Stockton/
It seems even Cleveland has begun to
wilt a little, and is now willing to talk
bimetallism as a compromise.
There is a possibility the gold men may
start a party of their own just to give Wall
street a chance to ratify something.
Democracy and Populism will never fuse
until they can agree which is to ride in
the cart and which is to do the pulling.
It looks as if New York Democrats
would play a lone hand iv this campaign
and sacrifice everything to save Tammany.
In this campaign there will be no ele
ment of confusion. The people know
what they wish and they know how to*
get it.
The only way Chicago can get a profit
from the convention is to take a census
while it is in town, and she will be sure
to do it.

afraid a relapse into silence might be con
strued as golden.
The personal factor of McKinley's noble
life will have a ereat influence in this
campaign and win many a vote for the
eoldier candidate.
One by one the leaders of the Cleveland
Democracy are rising up to declare they
do not wish the Presidential nomination
and never expected it.
If Cleveland sees no chance to get sat
isfaction out of this country he may be
just mad enough to whirl in and take it
out of the bide of old Spain.
Silver Republicans who think of bolting
the party will change their minds when
they see the sort of leaders who will be
nominated by Democrats and Populists.
General Wtyler can make promises of
an active campaign just ac easily as the
Democratic party, and the promises in the
one case are just about as valuable as in
the other.
The free-traders will resort to every
trick their ingenuity can devise to detract
the people from the tariff issue and beat
McKinley, but it is a foreeone conclusion
tbeir tricks will be in vain.
From the welcome given to Hobart on
his return home it seems certain that the
Jersey voters intend to follow him into
the Republican party, put their State in
the Union and keep it there.
President Diaz seems to have a walk
over for re-election in Mexico. Like .Mc-
Kinley in his country he stands for the
protection and promotion of home indus
tries and the people are with him.
When every industrious American can
find good work at good wages free from
the depressing competition of pauper
labor the Kepublican party will be first
ai.d foremost to go forward to new fields
and deal with new issues.
Among the novelties of the season are
McKinley umbrellas, McKinley pocket
knives. McKiDley envelopes ana McKin-
Jey canes, all of which of course are for
Republicans, aud the country is now wait
ing for sone kind of McKinloy soothing
syrup for Democrats.
The proposed badge of the silver party
in the campaign is to be a daisy with six
teen silver petals around a golden center,
and while the tbing will be lovely it will
be too rich for the wear of men who are
looking for Â» job and need bread in the
home more than a flower in the button
hole.
THE WAY IT LOOKS.
It looks as though the silver wing of the
Democratic party would have more than
enough delegates to the Chicago conven
tion to control under the two-thirds rule.
In fact many of the leaders of tbe other
wing admit thai the gold standard will
have no voice in the proceedings. It will
be a silver and practically a free-trade
platform, but during the campaign every
thing will be subordinated to free silver
coinage at lt> to 1, independent of other
nations. That is the programme now,
and there is no reason to believe it will be
changed. The issue at all the State and
ili>trict conventions has been the money
plank, and more than two-thirds of those
returned thus far claim to be silverites,
ana unless, as Altgeld fears, money is
used lavishly to buy up delegates, the
convention will be a gathering of men of
one idea. But one clearly defined idea is
a good many for a Democrat to entertain.
Anyway, the gold standard delegates will
be tolerated and that is all.
The belief which prevailed a few days
ago that if Teller were nominated by the
Ciiicago convention he would draw silver
ites of all parties to him is giving way be
fore the sober second thought. The Dem
ocracy is an adept in mailing things seem
what they are not, but to veneer Teller's
record on the tariff ana the Monroe doo
trine questions so that it could be passed
off on the people as good Democracy is
rather too much of an undertaking; be
sides Boies and Bland are plunging the
knife into the Colorado Senator on every
occasion. Bryan has no confidence what
ever in Boies' -loyalty to silver, and he
would very much prefer Teller to tlie lowa
political shuttlecock. Bryan is really a
Fopuiist, although he trains with silver
Democrats. He managed to have the
Nebraska Democratic State Convention in
dorse the Populist State ticket lrom top to
bottom two years atro, an,i for his reward
he got an unmerciful snubbing from Gov
ernor Holcomb, the very man in whose
interest he betrayed the Democratic
party. Bryan's relations with the Popu
lists â he has forgiven Holcombâ will
be used for alt they are worth to prevent
a fusion between the Populists and silver
Democrats if Boies grows dangerously
stiong. Next to himself, Bryan would
take Teller for his first and Bland for his
second.
State Chairman Wardall of the Califor
nia Populist party no doubt voices the
sentiments of his party everywhere. Silver
coinage at the old ratio is not all nor is it
the leading thing tue Omaha platform
declares lor; besides, the party has been
struggling along for years waiting for
"something to turn up." and now that
something haa turned up in the shape of
the Democrats getting ready to disinte
grate, why should it throw up its- hands
when so good a field for gathering recruits
from is open to it? That is the question
the leaders put when asked if the party
will indorse the candidate of any other
party. At this time the indications are
that the Democrats will have two Presi
dential candidates, the Populists one, the
Independent Free-silver party one and the
Prohibition party one. Anti-Republicans
can pay their money and take their choice.
CONTEMPT OF COURT.
There is at the present time a wide
pread discussion of the limits of the
powers which Judges may rightly exer
cise in punishing for what is known as
contempt of court. In California the
discussion turns mainly upon the recent
action of Judge Catlin in subjecting the
editor of the Sacramento Bee to a fine for
alleged contempt and refusing him a
right to prove the truth of tae publication
in dispute. In the East the discussion is
an outgrowth of the Debs case, and covers
much wider ground than that involved in
the Sacramento case. In both, however,
the vital point is the issue whether the
courts have not carried the practice of
punishing for contempt to a point where
it has become a danger to popular liberty.
It is not denied that our courts must
have power to compel respect and keep
order. That has been an established
principle since the very beginning. In
the original theory, however, contempt of
court was an indignity committed within
the precincts of the court itself, and cal
culated to disturb or interrupt ihe peace
able and orderly administration of justice.
Latterly in the United States there has
grown up a belief among a certain class of
Judges that they can punish as con
tempt alleged offenses committed miles
away from the courtroom. The form of
punishment is of course summary. The
accused is riot put on trial before a jury
and has no opportunity to defend himself.
It can be easily seen that in the hands of
unjust Judges the possession of such a
power would be totally destructive to the
lull enjoyment of liberty of .speech and
action by the people as well as by the
press.
That public opinion is adverse to this
dangerous exercise of power is beyond
question. The Inter Ocean in comment
ing on the subject cites in proof of mis a
case which occurred in Chicago when the
Evening Prexx of that city criticized with
some severity the action of the Supreme
Court of Illinois in connection with a
murder case. The Inter Ocean says:
"Those comments were construed by that
court to be contempt and the proprietor
and editors were compelled to apologize or
go to jail for an indefinite time, as long in
fact as the court may see tit. That case
aroused a great deal of indignation. It
was looked upon as a dangerous violation
of the freedom of the press. Net long
after the Chief Justice was a candidate for
re-election, and although a very able and
upright jurist, running in a district ordi
narily good for a majority of nearly two
to one, he was beaten. That was inter
preted as a popular rebuke of the abuse of
the judicial right to punish for contempt
of court."
If a similar question were submitted to
the people of California the result would
be the same as it was in Illinois. The
whole issue is in fact the simple one of
whether the old-fasnioned trial by jury
can be denied by Judges at their pleasure
whenever they fancy they have been un
worthiiy treated. No one denies that a
matter occurring in the presence of a
Judge, under his very eyes, and of a na
ture to interfere with him in tlie perform
ance of his judicial duties, should be sum
marily punished. In all other cases, how
ever, where Judges feel themselves
offended, tiie accused should have a fair
trial before a jury. There can be no real
liberty of speech or action on any other
terms.
OUR TRADE WITH MADAGASCAR.
It is just possible that France may find
out later on that she made a mistake when
she arbitrarily changed her relations to
Madagascar from protectorate to annexa
tion. . Hanotaux cannot divert attention
from the outrage with wit and jingoism.
When asked why France makes a colony
of the lilanu be said: "A door should be
either open or shut." That may sound
very funny to France, but the fact remains
that the door was open to traders of all
nations until French soldiers closed it a
while ago. The Hovas protested againsi
a French protectorate, but they bad to
THE SAJN JbRAXCISCO CALL, WKDJNJfISDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
submit, but it was not long beloro tbe
Paris Government framed aa excuse to go
to war with the natives, and now annexa
tion comes.
But what concerns the United Stales
most is the attempt of France to control
the commerce of the island. Hitherto our
merchants have enjoyed a very lucrative
trade with the Hovas, but France pro
poses to impose an import tax of 7 per
cent, which is intended to give French
merchants just that much advantage.
Wben it is said that with a large portion
of the inhabitants not much more than
half civilized the export and import busi
ness of the country amounts annually to
nearly $10,000,000 it will be seen that the
possibilities of the island are very great
and that this country should not be ex
cluded.
England has a larger interest in the
matter than this country, and she has
served notice on the French Government
that she will resist the abrogation of all
or any commercial treaties there may have
been made between Great Britain and
Madagascar prior to French annexation.
As far as is known, this Government has
taken no steps to protect our treaties. It
will be remembered that Consul Waller
was tried and imprisoned by the Fiench
â¢ iovernment, ostensibly for aiding the
Hovas, but in fact for an excuse to invali
date the large and valuable concessions
which Waller has secured. But other
Americans and Englishmen have similar
concessions, the title to which the French
Government intimates will be declared in
valid. In view of the high-handed man
ner in which France has laid hands upon
the commerce of that country it would
seem to be the duty of our Government to
at least protest against the abrogation
of the commercial treaties between the
Vnited States and Madagascar that were
made before France proclaimed ownership
ot the country.
PROTECTION AND INTELLIGENCE.
It is a mistake to suppose that tbe only
influence the operation of protection ex
erts upon the people is to inspire them
with a burning desire to gather riches. A
manufacturing establishment is an edu
cational institution as well as a converter
of raw material into merchantable prod
ucts to swell one's riches. With rare ex
ceptions inventions come from where the
rumble of machinery is heard. A mechan
ical contrivance for increasing and cheap
ening the output of man's hands inspires
to other inventions, and not only does the
intelligence and learning of the peopie of
a manufacturing community range higher
than in strictly commercial centers, but
a more independent and self-reliant spirit
is seen. Our public school system may be
said to have had its real strength imparted
to it by the Merrill tariff law of 1861. The
mill and shop give birth to desire for
knowledge, and desire for knowledge de
mands schools, colleges and universities.
In a recently delivered address Governor
Lippitt of Rhode Island showed that in
the manufacturing countries of Germany,
France and the United Kingdom the num
ber of people in a hundred able to read
and writa well enough, for ordinary pur
poses ranges from eighty-five to ninety
six, while in Italy, Spain and Kussia,
where no effort is made to encourage man
ufacturing, the percentage is from fifteen
to forty-seven. The difference between
manufacturing and non-manufacturing
towns in this country is not so marked,
but it is the fact that the people of the
first named generally show quicker and
more accurate mental activity, perception
and conception. One need only to visit a
manufacturing and an altogether com
mercial village and make comparison to
show that. Next to the store that "keeps"
the postoffice the blacksmith-bhop is the
chief loafing place in the quiet little vil
lage. It i< the roar of the forge and the
hammering of the iron that make it so,
because they are inspiring.
But what is true of popular intelligence
is equally true of wealth, especially when
the whole country is considered. Gover
nor Lippitt has taken the trouble to
gather the following figures, which show
how in proportion to a country's manu
factures is the volume of us wealth. His
figures are as follows:
United Kingdom $47,746.00f).000
France 41.84 3.U00.U0U
(itTUiany 31. 826.000.000
P.UMia 24,766,000.000
Italy 14.41-J.OOU.OOU
t-pain 3'_'.'J44,Â«00.000
Since the tariff act of 1861 there has
been a marvelous growth of mannfactur
ing concerns in the United States, and
with it has come a broader and higher
intelligence than any other natiun can
boast of, and in the same time the wealth
of the people has increased nearly five
times over. The academy and the manu
facturing establishment are co-partners
in educational work.
HE DID HIS DUTY.
Ex-Attorney-General Benjamin H. Bris
tow drew all eyes to him when be de
nounced the proposition that Kentucky
should assume the attitude of armed neu
trality as between the North and boutli.
In most vigorous language he told the
people of lin native State that there was
DO niiddie ground. Men were in armed
rebellion against the life of the Nation,
and there could be no such thing as armed
or any other kind of neutrality between
loyalty to the flag and treason.
Being a native of Kentucky and an un
compromising Union man, Mr. Bristow
did not hesitate to tell the people that any
man who would hesitate to declare for his
country was not (it to be a citizen. He
was a youne man then (only 20 years of
age), but he had already acquired reputa
tion as a good lawyer, and it may be
added that most of his associates were in
sympathy with the Southern cause, but
he did not hesitate to prove his loyalty by
enlisting in a volunteer company. Subse
quently He was commissioned a colonel,
but whatever capacity he was assigned to
he did ins best to save the Union.
As Attorney-General, Mr. Bristow dis
covered the great whisky ring and moved
down upon it with all the power of his
office. He unearthed the greatest frauds
that were ever perpetrated upon the Gov
ernment and not a few of the offenders
were landed in prison, but it made him
bitter enemies everywhere. The crusCie
against him was not at ail political. The
ring was composed of as many of one
party as of another, but the breaking up
of it cost him all further political pre
ferment.
War was waged against him from every
direcSion, but be had the consolation of
knowing that be had broken tip one of the
most powerful combines to rob the Govern
ment the country ever had to confront, and
that satisfied him. The best that can be
said of .Benjamin H. Bristow, now that he
sleeps the sleeps that knows no waking, is
that he served his country honestly and
faithfully from a sense of duty.
Georgia hat a prominent citizen who
combines the occupations of banker and
fisherman, but raver sen the usual rule in
such cases by fishing as his main business
and using his surplus capital and leisure
moments in banking. Thus on days when
he haa no capital fishing be rests on the
bank and finds interest in bis fishing

Asphalt Komi* Good Road*.

It is to be hoped that the '-Good Roads" As
sociation will again materialize and make
themselves telt not only in the matter of good
roads, but good streets. In this connection
their attention is called to the material that
has made the cities of Paris and Washington
noted the world over as the fineat in any land.
Asphalt is the material, and California pro
duces the best asphalt in the worla. It should
be investigated.

A writer in the Fortnightly Review describes
the condition of the 210,000 British farmers as
almost desperate. The thriving herds have
disappeared, cottages an.'J country mansions
are ciosed, "while rural laborers, flocking into
the towns, further swell the ranks of the un
employed." As a contrast there exists in Eng
! lantl. according to this writer, "ah appalling
commercinl wealth," whose vast uccumlations'
are invested with difficulty. The British
farmers demand protection, but their number
is comparatively small, and there is little pros
pect that what they ask will be granted.
Circumstances Have Chanced.

California is competing in the Eastern mar
kets for new honors. Augustin Daly, the cele
brated theatrical manager of New York, has
engaged six attractive young women from this
State to participate in the coming dramatic
season at the Metropole. Times have changed
mightily since the days of '49. Then there
was a demand for Massachusetts gchoolmsrms
and other girls in carload loss to come West
aud become the wives of worthy pioneers.
And now the tide has turned. The charming
femininity of the Pacific Coast is eagerly
sought by the East. California has come to
the fore with mighty strides in almost all
walks of life.

SHE IS NOW IN
SHALLOW WATER,
The Blairmore Raised and
Towed Half a Mile
Inshore.
ALL IS PLAIN SAILING
And the Vessel Will Now Be
Righted and Pumped Out
Immediately.
NARROW ESCAPE OF TWO MEN.
The Sugar Refinery, Gas Works and
Rolling-Mills May Have to Pay
Wharlage.
The Blairmore has been moved into
shallow water and the raisers are confi
dent of success. When operations were
begun she was sunk eleven feet in the
mud. She had to be raised out of this bed
she had made for herself, and that was
the chief difficulty. On several occasions
the bow was raised several times, but just
at the critical moment the pumps would
choke up or the hawsers part. Extra
pumps were placed on the hull and yester
day the first real success was gained.
At low water the air pump was started
and soon the bow began to rise. The
Monarch and Whitelaw were both towing
inshore and when the pumps began to
tell on the water that was in the stern of
the vessel up the vessel came. Then the
strain began to tell and slowly tug, wrecker
and sunken ship moved inshore. When
almost half a mile had been covered the
tide began to flow, and as there were a
i couple of vessels in the way Captain Burns
j determined to stop operations for the day.
' The Blairmore is now in eight feet shal
: lower water than she was last Monday and
â¢there will now be no difficulty in getting
her on an even keel ana pumping her out.
"I am now satisfied that we will have
the Blairmore up and as good as new in
side of two months," said Captain Burns
yesterday. "Where she was lying there
was a terrible tide running, and it was
hard to work in it. In fact there were
only two or three hours at a time in which
we could do anything. Last night (Mon
day) the tide ran like a millrace, and I
thought everything would be torn out of
; the Whitelaw. As it was our surgine
tangled the hawsers and the Blairmore's
bowsprit, and the latter snapped off close
to the stem. We are now in slack water
nearly all the time, and will be able to
work continuously."
The probable cost of raising and refit
ting the Blairmore will be $t50,000. The
work is being done by the insurance com
panies, and they will make money on the
transaction as the vessel is insured for
$80,000. Had she been abandoned and the
wreck sold it probably would not have
brought more than $1000 at auction, so the I
underwriters will oe fully $29,000 ahead on
the transaction.
News from the whaling fleet that win
tered in the Arctic is not encouraging.
The catch has been a small one and all the
j tish taken were small ones, so the yield in
I bone and oil was a poor one. The catch,
as given in a private letter, was only up to
! last November, but in the meantime many j
lof the vessels may have done better. The
i Mary D. Hume had only 1 whale, New
! port 7, Wanderer 1, Jessie H. Freeman 3, j
j John and Wimhrop 1, Fearless 3, Northern j
i Light 2, Jeanette 1, Karluk 1 and Navarch j
j3. Later advices, which arrived yester- I
j day, give the catch of the Fearless as 5
| and the Orca 6. This news is not authen
â  tic, however, and the officers of the Steam
j Whaling Company discredit it.
Captain Rideout of the steamer Trilby
1 denies that this vessel was in collision j
; with the Svengali. Ha says the Trilby j
j never left her moorings on Monday, and j
] therefore cculd not have been in Mission j
'â  Bay. It must have been some other I
| steamer that the Svengali hypnotized, for
I the collision undoubtedly took ;>lace.
Captain Russell, late of the Rio de ;

! will then be inaugurated and the Mail
i Company will oe ready for all opposition i
that may come along. There will also be i
achangeon the Acapulco. Captain Searles, j
i who brought her in, will resume his old |
position of "ship's husband," and Captain
Mortensen will assume command.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short I
| session yesterday and the pile question '
; occupied nearly all their time. The Teredo- j
I proof Pile Company wrotfi complaining i
that the San Francisco Timber Preserving
Company was infringing on its patent, and
stating on the authority of its attorney
I that the board would be" held responsible j
I if it used any of the opposition's piles, in j
; the construction of the* new ferry slips. J
President Colnon thought the Teredo
: proof Pile Company had no ground for
1 complaint, as the Timber Preserving Coru
i pany used creosote on solid logs and then
i nailed on an outside casing, whereas the
: other company built up an artificial log
with small pieces of timber, the latter
j process being on the principle that a teredo
| when at work will never pass a crack in
the wood.
At this point P. F. Dundon, who repre-
I sents the Timber Preserving Company,
I said he would enter into an indemnity
| bond to proiect the commission in the
; event of any lawsuit. The law point was
â  finally submitted to the board's attorney

President Colnon raised the question of J
! dockage charges at the Union Iron Works, I
! rolling-mills, gas works and sugiir refinery. {
j At none of those m ami factories is dockage j
! paid, and the Commissioner thought it
should be, as the board has full authority
over the water front, from the Presidio to
the county line. On the motion of Com- j
missioner Chadbourne the matter was re
ferred to the attorney for hi: opinion.

THE CARNIVAL QUEENS
Four Will Prf>bably Be Chosen to Sit
lifiiraih Cardinal, Blue and
Gold.
At the meeting of the executive commit
tee Monday of the Carnival of the Golden
Gate the proposition submitted for
charging 10 cents per vote in the electing
of a carnival queen was defeated. It was
decided that aspirants to that honor
should send in their applications to the
executive committee accompanied by
vouchers from two business men of good
standing. The dates for receiving appli
cations are from July 5 to September 19 at
10 p. m. The executive committee will
directly choose the queen from these
applications.
There will be probably a queen repre
senting the Stale of California, one for the
City, one for the Fire Department and
one for the school-children.
Tne colors for decorations and badges
wiil probably be a combination of the car
dinal of Stanford with the blue and gold
of Berkeley, which is said to be particu
larly showy and beautiful. These colors
were the original suggestions of T. L.
Rosen thai.
A prize of $25 will be paid by the execu
tive committee of the Carnival of the
Golden Gate for a design which will em
body ;i week of festivities and be symboli
cal of San Francisco and its Golden Gate.
All drawings must be done in ink and be
submitted to the executive committee on
or before Monday, July 6, at 4 p. m. The
accepted design will become the property
of the committee and will be copyrighted.
It will figure on all the stationery and
badges and be conspicuous in all decora
tions
It was deemed advisable to leave the
final selection of carnival colors, badges
and regalia to the committee which Chair

represent two uf tha strongest companies

Svea Fire Insurance Company of Sweden,
the only Swedish company doing business
on the coast, and the American Fire In
surance Company of Philadelphia. The
high standing and long experience of
these gentlemen in the insurance busi
ness are a guarantee that the two com
panies will be ably represented on the
coast.

THE NATION'S DAY
HEAR AT HAND.
Progress of the Prepara
tions for Its Ob
servance.
FUN FOR THE ORPHANS.
A Creditable and Patriotic
Demonstration Is Now
Assured.
ITS MANY FINE FEATURES.
The Expense Estimates Scakd Down
Last Evening by the Executive
Committee.
i It is now a foregone conclusion that the
coming Fourth of July celebration will be
I a credit to San Francisco. There will be a
j fine military parade, aud the literary ex
ercises at the Auditorium will be unusual
ly enjoyable. The children of the several
orphan asylums will be well entertained
in Golden Gate Park, and pyrotechnics,
while not especially elaborate, will be
tasteful and appropriate.
In consequence of the late date of the
organization of the executive committee
and the limited time remaining in which
to solicit subscriptions some of the features
originally contemplated in the demon
stration have been abandoned.
It was wished to adopt the idea of the
! decoration committee, for a grand electri
j cal illumination and ornamentation of
i the principal streets for three consecutive
! days, but now it is the general sentiment
\ that to carry it out would be far too expen
sive. It is also doubtiul if the Continental
j Army will make as conspicuous a figure
| in t,he parade as was at first intended.
There will not be any lack of patriotism,
! though; the Sons of the American Revo
i lution will turn out. if the so called Con
j tinental Array does not. The Declaration
of Independence wiil be read by John
! Robinson, the son of a soldier of the
I Revolution, and an oration will be dcliv
' ered by Zeaas U. Dodge, the grandson of a
soldier of the Revolution. The tableaux
will be excellent, and so will the vocal
chorus of 200 voices.
At its session last evening the executive
committee addressed itself to the task of
scaling down the sums demanded by the
various sub-committees, so that the ex
penses incurred should not by any mis
chance exceed the receipts. The auditing
committee considered the $3500 asked for
; by the parade committee to be too high,
' and advised a reduction of from 2o to 30
i per cent. Favorable reports were made
, upon the following items:
National Guard, $780; two floats, $300;
music, $800; regalia, .f-JOO; literary commit
tee..s4 UO; invitation and reception committee
$750; fireworks, $1000. With other minor
; items this made a loiul of $t>533.
The collections to date, reported by the
| finance committee, aggregate $22:54, ' with
j the Southern Pacific Cttmpauy, the banks
and insurance companies yet to come.
Grand Marshal Umbsen said he would
like an appropriation for two more floats
in the parade and $4iiO for the Continental
i Army. The $780 appropriated for the Na
i tional Guard of California was finally
adopted and action upon the other appro
; priations was deferred. There was some
! talk of dispensing with a grand stand, but
j the question was not finally determined.
The orphans (800 in all) will be taken
! out to Golden Gate Park, where the Native
Daugt;ters of tbe Golden West and
the Ladies of the Grand Army of the
j Republic will take care of them. They i
| will be given a luncheon, rides on the I
i merry-go-round, etc., and each orphan
will be presented with a neat little souvenir
flag. It is expecteu that free transporta
tion will be furni.thed the children to and !
\ from the park oy the Market-street Rail
! way Company. Upon their return to the
| City in the evening the orphans will be
I further entertained with a modest cx
i hibition of fireworks.
Secretary Adrian Smith of the Fourth i
of July Committee is in receipt of an ap- I
plication from the Portuguese Union No. j
7 to h;ive a float in the parade representing !
the first circumnavigation of the globe. I
This will be very elaborate and beautiful. â 
Albert Clark, a San Francisco lad, has j
; also requested that he be allowed to ride
; in the procession with a cart drawn by
j dogs in tandem.
The ship captains want a float with a
j saluting flag on it, that can be dipped and
manipulated according to the signal rules
I laid down by the United States nay> r .
I Captain A. P. Spear is the principal in
| this idea.
The public schools are taking a lively |
interest in the celebration and little tots !
come every day to the headquarters in- j
| quiring about floats and the costumes !
necessary for the parade. The entire Sec- i
ond Brigade of the National Guards will :
turn out under the command of Major !
Charles H. Murphy. The major is on |
General Warneid's staff, and the general j
Another reason
why we give money back if you don't like
Schilling's Best tea :
All tea sold in the United States is
roasted in far-away tea countries ; and, on
the way here, it loses that crisp delicacy
of flavor that tea has when it is first roasted.
All tea, except Schilling's Best, which
is roasted by machinery (clean) in San
Francisco, and goes to your grocer soon
after being roasted.
We want it to go to you â quick. That
is why we say "Money back if you don't
like it." We don't want it to stay around
on the grocer's shelves until it is old like
other tea.
San Francisco Â«Â» A Schilling & Company
I has taken this as a compliment to himself
and promises to spare no pains in making
J the display particularly fine. The num
ber of bands will not be decided until next
Friday.
The committee expresses itself disposed
to favor the presence of union men among
the musicians as far as is possible, yet it
may be necessary to have some non-union
men in line. The Musicians' Union has
met the committee in a very amicable
manner and has offered to play in the
parade with the non-union men, owing to
the fact that it is a patriotic celebration. /
The Grand Army men are going to turn
out in good force, and the Seven Pines
Circle, Woman's Relief Corps, is now pre
paring a float of great beauty, the nature
of which they refuse to divulge. The Vet
eran Volunteer Firemen will be promi
nently placed in line and will turn out in
large number. The Fire Department will
also have a large representation in the pa
rade.
Besides these the Leagne of the Cross
Cadets will turn out with all their com
j panics. The Sons of Revolutionary Sires,
including some of the most, prominent
citizens, will be represented. An invita
tion has been sent to Governor Budd and
stuff, and it is hoped he will be present to
add to the glory and pageantry of the
day.
The staff officers have not all been se
lected, as all the appointees have not yet
been heard from, and the announcements
will not be made until all the returns are
' in. It is provided, however, to have one
chief of staff, five chief aids, thirty aids,
twelve marshals of division and twenty
four aids to the marshals.
The literary programme promises to be
exceedingly tine. The chairman of the
literary committee already has received a
great quantity of poetic effusions, and the
competition for the $50 prize is very keen.
The decoration committee met yester
day, but decided it could do nothing until
lit was allowed $800. All committees
are instructed to hand in type-written re
ports of the amounts of money they re
' quire by next Thursday, when the execu-
I live committee will audit them, together
1 with the reports of the finance committee
lon the amount received. Appropriations
I will then be made, and all committees will
1 thereafter work with more definiteness.
A communication was received from the
i Retail Hatters' Association, saying that
' all the places of ' business of exclusive hat
I establishments would close on the Fourth
| after 1 o'clock. in the afternoon.

FATHER BYRNE TO SPEAK.
A Celebration That Will Take Place
on the Third.
The Young Men's Catholic Union held
a meeting last night to complete arrange
ments for a special celebration of the
I Fourth of July.
In consequence of the Fourth falling on
a Saturday it was resolved that the Cath
olic Union should hold its exercises on
toe evenine of the 3d. This will give
members an opportunity of attending
! other celebrations, or of going into the
I country to pass the Fourth. The young
I men's celebration will take place in Metro
-1 politan Temple, which will be patriotic
ally decorated with a large number of
American Hairs. It was resolved to use
, nothing else to adorn the building except
the portraits of the signers of the Decla
, tion of Independence.
Judge J. F. Sullivan will preside, and
: will make some interesting remarks. Miss
K;ite Black will sing "The Star-spangled
Banner," and the Declaration of Inde
pendence will be read by Ben McKinley,
the cousin of the President-elect, who won
a prize given by the Leaeue of the Cross
the other day. "Tbe Sword of Bunker
i Hill" will be sung by G. V. Wood.
There will be an original poem by
i Charles D. South. The oration ot the cx
i ercises will be made by Rev. Joseph F.
: Byrne, the chaplain of tiie Catholic
I Union; Drake's address to the flag will be
i delivered by Frank F. Shea, Miss Nellie
J Gallagher will sing "Columbia, the Gem
i of the Ocean," J. K. Tobin of the Park
i band will play a trombone solo and "The
Red, White and Blue" will be sung by a
j quartet composed of David Manlloyd, G.
! V. Woods, Miss K. M. BlacK and Miss
i Nellie Oailagher. David Manlloyd will
| also sing the tenor solo from "Maritana,"
I "Let Me Like a Soldier Fall." Professor
! Harrison will preside at the organ.
THE HOWARD CLUB.
It Will Have a Uniformed Drill Corps
for the Campaign.
A large ami enthusiastic meeting of the
Howard Club was held last evening at
i Pythian Castle Hail, 90934 Market street.
i Over 300 members were present. I. Kin
j caid, one of the members of the club, was
! complimented on the able and efficient
; manner in which he conducted the parade
i on Saturday evening.
P. J. Gray delivered a stirring address
on the advisability of the members of the
club in their respective precincts seeing
that Republican friends were registered as
early as possible, The club was enlight
i ened upon the question of protection by
Richard Downing, Peter Lynch, Richard
I McCreedie, Edward M. Sweeney and
I others.
The club will uniform its members for
j the coming campaign, and has engaged a
I drill master to drill its members with the
expectation of having one of the finest drill
clubs in the City. The club adjourned
with three cheers for McKinley and for
protection.

Burglars Blow Ip Safes.
The ease with which skilled burglars
break open 3afeÂ«, even so-called burglar
proof ones, causes them to be regarded
with distrust as secure places for the de
posit of valuables. An insurance against
loss by burglars that beats a burglar-proof
bafe is a policy in the New England Burg
lary insurance Company. It indemnifies
ajrainst loss not alone of valuables but for
all damages to property caused by the

HAPPY PICNICKERS
AT SAN RAFAEL,
The Enjoyable Reunion of
St. Brigid's Parish

LEAGUE OF THE CROSS.
Company G Has a Merry and
Memorable Day in Schuet
zen Park.
IN AID OF THE NEW CHURCH.
There Were G mes and Dancing With
out Any Intemperance â A Model
Gathering.
From morning until evening yesterday
at Schuetzen Park, picturesquely located
in the hills of Marin County, tbere was a
scene of youthful merriment. It was a |
sociable gathering of Company G, League j
of the Cross Cadets, and a large crowd was
in attendance.
The boats of the Tiburon ferry leaving
San Francisco at 9 and 11 a. m. and 12:38
and 3:30 p. m. were crowded with the
| cadets and their invited guests. The hours
I of the morning and the afternoon were
| parsed pleasantly and all too quickly in
the athletic i antes and dances usual with !
such gatherings, and it was 6:30 p. m. I
before the last of the merry company took
the special train and journeyed back to
tbe City.
The League of the Cross, as is well
j known, is a total abstinence society under
the auspices of the Roman Catholic
church. All young men between the ages
of 16 and 21 years are eligible to member
ship in the cadets. Company G was or- I
i g.inized in St. Brigid's parish in May,
1894, and mustered into the First Regi
ment of the League of the Cross Cadets in
I the following month with fifty members ,
enrolled. It is now commanded by EL J.
, Power, captain ; Owen McMahon, first ;
j lieutenant; James J. Scanlan, second lien- \
j tenant. Following is the list of tbe non
j commissioned officers: First sergeant,
i William Madden; second sergeant, Robert
Powers; third sergeant, James Toohy; \
! fourth serge-ant, William Hennessy; fifth j
sergeant, .Tos-ph Maloney; first corporal, j
' D. J. Earle; second corporal, H. Griffiths:
; third corporal, P. Colligan; fourtn corpo
\ ral, William Curry ; tilth corporal, Thomas
I Crowley; quartermaster-sergeant, William
Dixon.
Company G has a record to be coveted.
; Its percentage at a recent, inspection was
98. and its labors in tbe grand competitive !
I military drill of last year were so noticea- ;
â  ble tha< it was awarded a $25 pri^e. Ser- \
! gennt William Dixon, one of its non-com-
I missioned officers, bore away from 150
| competitors the Ryland trophy, and Cap
i tain Powers wears upon his breast the
| Montgomery medal, the object of each
'company's ambition. It is almost super
fluous to say that all of the cadets carry
! sabers, are handsomely uniformed in blue
! and well drilled.
At Schuetzen Park yesterday the young
folks talked and lunched under the shady
trees and strolled around the grounds and
danced in the pavilion.
There were suitable athletic games for
t'irlÃ, voting ladies; married ladies, fat
women, members of the Immaculate Con- !
ception Sodality, boys, altar - boys and j
members of St. Aloysius Sodality. There !
I were also races for the cadets, the married
i men and tne fat men, the winners of
i which were awamed suitable prizes.
01<i St. Brigid'B Church, at the corner of
j Van Ness avenue and Broadway, was \
j built in September, 1864, by Archbishop I
i Alemany. A new and handsome modern j
| structure is now in course of erection upon j
j the site of tne old church, the Rev. J. E.
, Cottle pastor, and it was to aid in defray
i ing the expenses of the building and to be j
I commemorated in one of its stained-glass
[ windows, when completed, that the cadets
; held their picnic at Shuetzen. Under j
I these circumstances it was sure to be sue
! cessful and enjoyable.

Yesterday, in Judge Belcher's court, the
girl he once went to jail for deliberately
acknowledged herself a liar and a perjurer,
in order if possible to send him again to
prison.
Less than four months ago Olivier was
a roomer at the house of Mrs. Esther
Brady, 14:5 Minna street. He fell in love
with Rosie Brady, the daughter of his
landlady, a young woman whose ace is
shrouded in even more mystery than is
usual on that point with most members of
the gentler sex. Rosie loved Manuel too,
or at least she felt at that time that life
with him would be preferable to one spent
in the domicile of her mother.
At any rate, Mrs. Brady woke up one
fine morning to lind thai her daughter
had eloped with the lodger, and at one
cad blow she bad been bereft of a child
and an income of $3 per week. Mrs. Brady
has not the most angelic temper in' the
world, and when she realized the fell extent
of her loss she feil into a tine frenzy and im
mediately posted off to police headquar
t-rs and swore out a warrant for Olivier's
arrest on a charge of abduction.
Before the lovesick couple could be ap
prehended they were married, and so the
nlduction charge fell flat. Not to be
balked in her revenge, Mrs. Brady then
obtained a warrant charging her new son-
tmile Hestres. the Pioneer Who Has Been Missing for Two Weeks.
in-law with perjury for having sworn that
I) is bride was over IS years old when he se
cured the marriage license. Olivier spent
Beveral days in jail and the aged head of
the Brady family liurrced as much as she
could of her abuadant anatomy for very
joy.
At the preliminary hearing in the Police
Court Rosie stood up quite bravely for her
husband and took all the blame on her
self. She swore that Manuel believed her
almost 10 years of age, and that she had
on every iccasion so informed him, giving
as her reason for so doing her love of him
and her desire to get away from her
mother's home.
Yesterday when Rosie was put on the
Maud in Judge Belcher's court she shower l
that she had experienced a wonderful
change of heart. Although married less
than a half year she acknowledged that
fche would not go back to her husband.
.She has returned to the sheltering arms of
Mamma Brady, and her testimony no
doubt pleased that amiable person.
M ra. Olivier swore that she is not yet 18
years of age, that sjhe lied in her testimony
j:iven in the Police^ Court, and denied that
she had ever on any occasion told her bus
band tbat she was of age.
In direct contradiction to this testimony
Olivier's attorneys introduced in evidence
a letter which the witness acknowledged
having written some time during last
January. It reads as follows:
Dear ifaniicl, or Dcnr Husband: I got your
note and was glad to hear that you were
dreumingof me. AVhy, dear Manuel, I dream
of you nearly every night.
Well, Manuel, you will want to know about
my age, go now I am going to tell you the
whole story. My aunt had a spat with ma
about a year ago, so I went to see her shortly
after that and we got talking about ases, so
â¢wnen I said I am 17 this Fourth (July 4)â that
is the last Fourthâ Manuel, why you should. -cc
her look at me, and then she told me that I
was six months older than her daughter, and
her daughter was born in January, bo by riijht
1 will be 19 next Fourth; and one night about
five or six months ago my aunt was talking
about ages before ma, and when ma said I was
only 17 she whs just going to speak up, and I
just looked over in time to see ma make a
i-ign to my aunt, and then they stopped talking
on that subject.
So now. dear Manuel, I have told you all
about my age, so I am going to let ma have
her own way about my age, because, Manuel,
J aon'i want to have any trouble with, her, be
cause you know, Manuel, your mother is your
best friend and I never let on thai I was told I
was older, for it would make her feel mad.
Now, dearest. I want you to understand this :
I have a daughter's love for my mother, cer
tainly as a good girl always has, and when she
f-ays i shall not do a certain thing I never do
it, not because I fear her, you see, but just be
cause I love h<T dearly, for a girl that is true
lo her mother la always truer to her husband.
And now, dear Manuel, in spite of all that I
think so much of you, and I love you so, Man
uel, that when yoii are ready no one on earth,
either mother or father, can stop me from be
coming your wife. Weil, dearest, r.b 1 have no
more to say, I draw to a close, hoping you will
be pleased with my note and excuse my mis
takes, as I had a bad chance to-iay to write or
take my time, so pood-by, honey. From your
true Boeie, or your true wife,
Mrs. OLIVIER * * *
P. S.â Yes, Manuel, we will, in spite of all.
The stars at the bottom of the letter, it
was explained, meant kisses.
In charging the jury, Jtidse Belcher
said he did not think that Olivier should
have been held by the police court. In
sp"ite of this, when the twelve good men
and true returned their verdict, the de
fendant was found guilty as charged and
recommended to the utmost mercy of the
court.
Olivier will be up for sentence on Satur
day if he is not granted a new trial before
that time,
Suit for Damages.
James Burke, a teamster, formerly employed
by Knglander Bros., has sued Seurle & Holt for
Sp:J0,000 damages for injuries sustained by
reason of being knocked irom his wagon. He

EMILE HESTRES MISSING.
Once He Owned Half a Million,
but Speculation Ruined
Him.
Built the First Theater in Stockton.
A Legacy From Signor De
La Vega.
Emile Hestre 5 , a Frenchman, who came
to this City in 184!t, was well known in the
northern mines and in this City, dis
appeared from his home on the movr.ing
of the 7th of this month and has not been
seen since.
Mr. Hestres, upon his arrival in this
City, like many others, remained but a
short time and then started for the north
ern mines, and finally located in Stockton,
where he engaged in commerce. One of
the enterprises he engaged in was the pur
chase of a flour mill at Knight's Landing
from Colonel Dent, who became the
father-in-iaw of General U. S. Grant.
While in Stockton, so some who have
known him for many years say, he built
the tirst theater in that place. During the
early days of the minintr excitement on j
the Comstock, he closed out his business |
in Stockton and then came to this City j
and engaged in the purchase and sale of ;
mining stocks.
He dealt extensively in Justice and j
Raymond <fe Ely, and his investments I
realized him not less than $15,000 a month. '
His broker, the late Henry Schmidell, at
one time advised him to sell out when he
would clear up $600,000, but he wanted to
make a million, and in his endeavor to se- i
cure that he, like many other speculators, i
lost all. He managed after that to do a i
little in the speculating line and held the
secretaryship of some mining companies, j
but as age advanced he was unable to con- I
tinue in this line of bnsiness, so he de
voted his attention to making collections
on commissions.
About twelve years ago he rentea a
room at 609 Pine street and remained
there until the day of his disappearance, j
Mrs. Juiie Quercy. the landlady, stated
yesterday that she has kent the house one i
year, during which time Hestres paid his !
rent regularly until last month, when he
became delinquent. Mrs. Quercy, taking
pity on the old man, furnished him a
Bowl of soup every evening, and he prom- i
ised to repay her kindness, but up to the !
time of his disappearance he had tailed to j
do so. During the time she has had |
charge of the house Hestres never had
but two visitors, a middle-aged woman
who was always accompanied by a boy j
about seven years of ace. Who this i
woman is Mrs. Quercy did not know, but I
on one occasion heard Hestres say that |
she was his srodchild.
When Sigrnor de la Vetra, the million- !
aire old Californian, died he he by his will '
left $1000 to Hestres. and this has been |
paid to him monthly in small sums, about \
$10 at a time.
About two months ago a divorced
woman named Magendie, but who after
her divorce was known as Mrs. Schaffer, ;
died and Hestres attended her funeral.
After that his mind seemed to be affected
and he did not seem to be like his former
self. This grew to such a degree that one j
or two of his old customers, who still cm- j
ployed him to collect rents for them, dis- ;
charged him, fearine to trust him. On j
two previous occasions he lost bis way in j
the Mission district and when found wan- j
dering around he was unable to tell where !
his home was. On one occasion i c was i
kept by some kind-hearted people for j
three days. It is likely that he has wan- I
dered away and has been taken charge of j
by some family anxious to learn who he is. j
At one time Hestres was interested in a !
number of quicksilver mines with the late
Theodore Le Roy and a number of prom
inent members of the French colony.
In order to make people keep their
distance it is necessary first to keep your
own.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1836.
BUCKLEYITES ARE
ALL ON DECK,
The Biggest Meeting Held
Since the Split
Occurred.
NUMBERS AND HURRAH.
The General Committee Prepares
for a Future Municipal
Convention.
O'BRIEN STILL IN THE FOLD.
Declaration of War, Hope of Peace,
Loyalty to the Dollar Limit
and Speeches.
The Buckley regular Democratic Gen
eral Committee held the biggest and most
enthusiastic meeting in its history at
I B'nai B'rith Hail last evening. It will
not hereafter be hinted by the coterie of
the Flood building that the Buckleyites
| are whipped off the face of the earth or
â â  that they will be breaking their necks to
! get into the Junta camp.
The organization which was denied
! recognition by Frank Gould at Sacra
j mento, last night emphatically declared it
j self the re.ular and legal party organiza-
I tion, ordered a primary to elect delegates
j to a municipal convention to be held in
September, ordered headquarters .opened
in each Senatorial district, resolved to re
mind the four Democratic Supervisors
! that they were elected on a dollar-limit
platform and loudly cheered men and
| speeches expressive of the determination
to stand boldly together and win.
There cropped out in two or three of the
speeches the general belief and desire that
i the party would, however, be united
I through a fair primary which would give
| the Democratic voters a chance to create
j one party organization. But until that
j comes the Buckle yites will hold and mass
| and play their strength to its fullest ci
i tent.
The chaira in the hall provided seats for
i about half those present. Men stood
! three deep along the side wall, packed the
rear of the hall and tilled the gallery.
Chairman Joseph Piothschild called the
meeting to order and Secretary D. M.
Gavigan's rollcall showed the presence of
386 members of the committee. Most of
the delegates to Sacramento and about 300
spectators were also present.
"Well, now, are we the people or are the
other fellows?" was jubilantly asked a
hundred times when the typical Demo
cratic San Francisco mass-meeting had
pawed tne sawdust into moistened disor
der and the touacco smoke had spread its
haze.
Five cheering? and one bunch of his3e3
interrupted the rollcall. Dr. D. F. Reagan,
who went to the enemy some time ago and
became a delegate to Chicago, was hissed.
James H. O'Brien, who iiatl been report
ed in the Kainev camp while he was at the
Santa Cruz carnival, answered "Here" all
right and the boys hurrahed. Thomas
Ashworth got his usuitl applause, as did
Recorder Giynn and Railroad Commis
sioner Btanton.
Frank Malloye offered the following
resolution orderinc a primary election and
giving the executive committee general
power and discr tion where the interests
of the faction are concerned:
Stsolved, That in pursuance of section 3.
anicle 1, of the constitution of the General
Committee, a cull is hereby made for the pur
pose of holding a primary for the election of
delegates to a municipal nominating conven
tion to be held in the City and County of San
Francisco not lp.ier than Beptember 15, 1896.
Besolved, That in accordance with section 1,
article- V, ot the constitution, the number of
delegates composing s*id municipal conven
tion -imil be 4so, apportioned as follows: To
each Assembly district twcity-thrt l -? delegates,
to be elected by the district clubs of the As
sembly district; two delegates at large lor
each Assembly district, to be elected by the
voters of tiie eighteen Assembly district clubs,
Jtcsolved, That pursuant to article VI, sec
tions 1, 2 and 3, of theconstitution, candidates
lor the Senate shall be nominated by the
Bevernl Assembly district clubi embraced in
each Senatorial district; that candidates for
the Assembly shall be nominated by the As
sembly district club in each Assembly dis
trict : "lhat the nominees for members of the
Legislature, when elected by the district club,
shall be reported to the municipal convention
for indorsement.
Resolved, That the executive committee be
and hereby is empowered to designate days
and dates for future enrollment of members
in district c'.ubs; day and date of making
nominations for delegates to municipal con
; ventiou and Legislative candidates; also date
i of holding primary election in accordance
j with articles I, II and 111 of the constitution
. governing district clubs, and to make any and
! all arrangements to curry out these resolutions
and to uttend to nil details in furtherance
| thereof and report the same to this committee.
Resolved, That the executive committee is
i further empowered to personally perform any
act that may be necessary to protect this com
mittee and the Democratic party in all its
I rights.
The resolution was adopted with a
! whoop, as was the following one, intro
! duced by T. J. Powers, declaring loyalty
: to the dollar limit:
Whereas, The tax-levy for the ensuing year
; is about to be considered by the Board of
i Supervisors, and among its members arc four
Democrats, elected on a platform pledged 10
the dollar limit; therefore, be it
Rttnlvcd, That we, the members of the Gen
j eral Committee, request that the executive
i committee of this body appoint a committee
to work. ui'Oii said .uemocratic Supervisors
and call their attention to the platform
| adopted at Union Hall beptember 11), L 894,
! and upon which they were elected, and which
we reaffirm and believe to be sufficient for the
purposei of conducting the present City gov
ern m-nt, as has been proven by many years
j of Democratic rule.
A resolution by James Eagan, author
izing the executive committee to open
j headquarters in each Senatorial district,
followed.
M. J. Donovan, chairman of the execu
tive committee, offered amid.applause the
j following resolution, which was quickly
adopted :
Whxbeas, The Genernl Committee of the
Deiuocratie party of the City and Couuty of
; Shu Francisco, of which Joseph Rothschild is
\ the president, is the only legal representative of
: the Democratic party of this City and County,
I. iivmg succeeded to all thu rights and powers
'â â  of all previous committees: therefore belt
Resolved, That the executive committee of
tins (ieneral Committee be and hereby is mi
i structed to proceed to acquire and reduce to
â¢ possession, on behalf of this committee and for
I the use and benelit of this committee, any
i money or property of this committee or its
I : edecewor, in the hands of any person or per
sons, and upon acquiring control of the same
I to turn it over to the treasurer of this com
j xnittee.
The election of Matt O'Donnell as a
; member from the Forty-third District and
j of T. J. Casserly lrom the Thirty-sixth
j was approved.
This ended the business of the meeting,
| and the speeches and hurrah followed.
Dr. Stan ton received an ovation as he
j went to the platform, where he briefly
I said:
You all know the story of the State Conyen
â  tion. Through a series of misrepresentations
and the tricks of Mr. Gould's programme our
delegation was not seated, but a visit to this hall
to-niglit wouid settle anybody's doubts as to
which organizntion repiesented the regular
Democracy. At Sacramento the Junta tried to
I gain a promise thai they would not be hurt in
I San Francisco. That was their only fear. The
i question as to whether or not this organization
shall go in and administer the affairs of the
party rests with you.
Colonel O'Byrne poure< forth his elo
quence loyally. He told that the creden
tials committee at Sacramento adopted
the unit rule so as to wholly squelch the
friends they had in the committee.
"I would like to know," said Mr.
O'Byrne, *'if the Junta people could mus
ter such a gathering as this. There is
such an intense respectability among
many of the Junta Democrats that they
would shrink from clasping the hard,
horny hands of man3 r men in this body
who are true to their country and who
are ready to sustain their country in peace
or in war. Of such Democrats is this body
composed.
"I have taken a stand with this organi
zation and I will be true to the men I
stand with. In unity there is strength.
The enemy may try to break up this
organization by taking men away in de
tail, and if that is the policy ol the Junta
I ask you to stand firm and no', desert
your friend and neighbor. In ancient
Greece, neutrality in time of war was
punished with death, and he who
now fails falls or remains neutral
deserves political death. This is not the
time for oratory. The serried ranks are
not face to face. When that time comes
I, who come from a race that never turned
back to friend or foe, will stand with you,
and if we all stand together the people
shall rule here in this free and glorious
country of ours. 1 '
There were cries for Dunne, but Feter P.
Dunne was not present and M. J. Donovan
responded to howling calls. He spoke of
Sacramento, the packed jury, the billings
gate that was successfully opposed to evi
dence, and the 113 votes' for gold in the
Junta delegation.
"This committee has done one thine,"
continued Donovan. "We forced the
Junta to nominate James G. Maeuire for
Congress. This is evidenced by thefa^t
that less than one-half of the Junta dele
gation voted to send him to Chicago. We
will keep on until we have not only
elected Maguire, but a municipal ticket
from top to bottom."
James 11. O'Brien declined to take the
platform when orders to that effect were
howled at him.
"A flew months ago," he said, "at Metro
politan Hall, they said, 'We will adjourn
this committee sine die and you will never
hear of them again.' " They said
they adjourned sine die, but they
found us in the ring. Then they
said, 'We will get the State Committee
to recognize us and that will be the end of
them.' The State Committee recognized
them, and then they said, 'Well, the State
Convention will end all trace of them.'
Tie State Convention has been held and
here we are, never having held so large a
meeting as this of to-night.
"I suppose you have heard that I've
been heralded as a candidate for Sheriff,
but I am not a candidate for Sheriff or
anytaing else within the gift of the Demo
cratic party. I am satislied to be a
humble member of this General Commit
tee, which is the Democratic organization
ot San Francisco."
T. E. Treacy said that they represented
three-fourths of the Democratic voters.
He advised going slowly in the interest of
the whole party when a great issue was at
t-take, and spoke of the absolute necessity
of uniting the party.
"All we want," he said, "is a fair pri
mary under the auspices of a fair election
board, giving every good Democrat a
chance to cast his ballot and have it
counted once. If that can bo we will have
a solid Democracy."
Frank J. Failon and Walter J. Gallagher
also spoke and then an adjournment to
the call of the chair was taken.
A. J. Clunic was conspicuous at the
meeting, but by his absence.
STOPPED BY A BEAR.
Fearful Suspense of a Tourist
on a Mountain
Pass.
A Frightened Horse Almost Racked
Its Driver Over a Preci
pice.
Black and brown bear are sihpularly
numerous this year in the mountains east
and west of Cloverdale, and hunting par
ties are being organized for the purpose
of having a little sport in chasing sny and
artful bruin throueh the mountainous
districts where the "berry-hunters" nave
recently been seen.
Last week a gentleman named Wagner.
who was driving from Highland Sprinas
to Pietn, had a very narrow escape from
being mashed into smithereens all be
cause of the sudden and unexpected ap
pearance of a bear, which was evidently
on its journey toward the coast.
Mr. Wagner was fortunately driving a
very docile animal, to whose good be
havior he attributes his success in having
escarwd with his liie.
"I had just reached about half way be
tween the springs and Pieta," said Mr.
Wagner, "when suddenly the horse 1 was
driving stopped, then reared up on hi 3
hind feet and commenced to snort. To
put it mildly, I was in the deuce of a fix,
because where the trouble commenced the
road was narrow and over my left
shoulder I could easily look down 600
feet into a canyon which was awful to be
hold, â with its treacherous-looking bowl
ders and jagged rocks which were pro
jecting from the side of the mountain.
"In an instant I concluded that my only
hope was to get the animal on the move
and I applied the whip briskly to his
Hanks, as I was apprehensive lest in case
lie continued to back the buggy would
certainly be forced off the roadbed, and in
that event horse, buggy and driver wouid
go down to perdition.
"You can rest assured that my heart
beat more freely when the horse, obedient
to the whip, started on a run down the
road, and it was at least a mile from the
spot where the trouble commenced when I
got him under subjugation. 1 could not
even surmise what on earth caused the
animal to act in such a strange manner
until I reached Pieta, when I was in
formed that the horse must have either
got the scent of a bear or had seen the ani
mal close at hand.
"On the following day some of the boys
who reside near Pieta got their hounds to
gether and started off at early morning on
a bear hunt. They found tue trail of' old
bruin, and his footprints were plainly dis
cernible on the dust of the road, and
within 100 yards of the spot where I had
such a very unpleasant and unlooked-for
experience.
"Old bruin had evidently made fast
tracks from that part of the country. He
probably was as frightened as the horse I
was driving, and did not remain over to
investigate the cause of the confusion he
had created by having put in such a very
unwelcome appearance. The hunters re
turned without having had an opportunity
of bagging big game. The trail was too
old and the dogs lost it after having fol
lowed it a mile or so in the direction of the
coa=t range."
A day or two after Mr. Wagner had such
a close call a sheep-herder drove into the
town of Cloverdale with a 500-pound black
bear which he had shot on a sheep range
about ten miles west of Cloverdale. The
brute was purchased by a butcher of
the town and shipped to this City. Pos
sibly it may have been the same shaggy
tramp which made matters so very un
pleasant for Mr. Wagner in his ride from
Highlond Springs to Pieta.

TO MAKE COTTON GOODS
Shanghai Will Crush Out India's Com
petition and 3lay Threaten This
Country.
There is a great industrial and manu
facturing revival in Shanghai since the
I China-Japanese war, says George W.
Noell, who for the last twenty-one years
has been a constant resident at thut Ori
ental seaport, and who is a well-to-do
commission merchant and broker among
the foreign residents there.
Five new cotton-goods factories are be
ing erected. They will be in full opera
tion before the end of the year.
Large quantities of cotton are grown by
the Chinese in the country inland from
the port, so that there will be home pro
duction and manufacture and a large home
consumption of the output of the mills.
This will tend, said Mr. Noell yesterday
at the Palace, to decrease and almost to
supplant the goods formerly imported
from India.
Already there are 150,000 spindles in op
eration, and when the new factories shall
have been completed 200.000 more will be
at work turning out cotton fabrics.
Women and children are and will be the
I principal employes, as the work of tending
j the frames is ::ot complicated or particu
! lady ditiicult. They work for about a
! cent and a half a day, gold value, and that
is cheaper than the wages the coolie
receives.
In addition to the great impetus that
I has been given to the manufacture of cot
ton, the silk-spinning business has also
' taken on new life. Fourteen or fifteen
I silk filatures are in the process of con
j struction. In them silk will be spun from
j the cocoon and prepared for the weaver
i and manufacturer of silk goods.
Mr. Noell arrived from i 1 c Orient on the
â¢ Coptic and ia bound for England, where
i he proposes to inÃkeavisit to his old
home after an absence of a lifetime in
! China. He will resume his journey to
| morrow, when he will start for New York.
Shanghai is a city not so large as San
; Francisco by perhaps 30,000, and the white
population, including women and chil
i dren, is about 4300. Three journals are
1 published, two evening and one morning.
J The morning paper, the North China
Daily News, has been in the field for ov*>r
| forty years, is the official organ, and is too
! well established for any would-be rival to
attempt to compete with it.
From what Mr. Noell has learned during
his long experience in bnanghai, this is
the greatest boom that has ever struck tho
j place. As to its ultimate effect upon tlio
I manufactories of the United States he
j cannot predict.

FERRY RATES.
Answers a Communication
of the Railroad Com
mission.
PARTIALITY DISAVOWED
Comparison Drawn Between the
Regular and Creek Route
Service.
DEFIANT STREETCAR LINES.
Market Street and Other Companies
Refuse to Acknowledge the Board's
Jurisdiction.
Ju'ius Kruttschnitt, general manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, and
Andrew J. Clunie, are not agreed on the
question of ferry rates between San Fran
cisco and Oakland.
At the last meeting of the Railroad Com
mission Cluuie filed a complaint charging
discrimination on the part of the railroad
corporation in that but 5 cents was charged
per passenger let ween San Francisco and
Oakland on the creek route, while 10 cents
was collected over the regular ferry lines.
He asked that the matter be investigated
and a remedy applied, if his charges
proved true.
At this meeting the matter was referred
to the Southern Pacific Company for an
explanation, and a copy of Glume's com
plaint was forwarded to General Manager
Kruttschnitt. The latter's reply to the
commission follows:
1 am in receipt of a communication from
your Honorable body inclosing copy of letter
addressed to you by one Andrew J. Clunle,
â wherein be recites the provisions 01 Section
21 of Article Xll of tlie constitution of this
btate, claiming that because this company is
encaged in ruunlng a ferry-boat irora the
water front of San Kranciscj to the toot of
Broadway, in Oakland, by the so-culled creek ,
route, at a fare 01 5 cents* per passenger, while
on the route comprising .bcuh ferry and rail
service from San Francisco, via Seventh street
to Broadway, Oakland, the fare charged is 10
cents, said constitutional provisions are there
fore violated.
An examination of the facts stated by the
complainant establisues the fallacy of his con
clusions.
The lines in question, although operated by
the me company, are entirely separate and
distinct by different routes, between different
termini and the transportation is under
different circumstances tu:d conditions. It is
not alleged, nor is it true, that any discrimin
ation whatever is made between persons in the .
us;' of these several routes, nor can there be
any discrimination between places. Both
routes are equally open to any one who chooses
to use either, ami both run between the city of
Oakland and the City of San Francisco.
The service via Scventn street, Oakland, to
Broadway is an expensive one, involving the
use o: s'.eain railroad trains, running into and
upon a costly de;Â«ot, mole and tracks, whilÂ»
the accommodation given to the passenger is
far superior to any that is possible by the i
creek route, enabling him to stop ill anyone '
of half a dozen stations between the western
limits of Oakland and the station at Seventn
street t'nd Broad ivay. As -to "The reason
ableness of the targe of 10 cents for such a
service, there has been and can be no question.
Even the complainant does not venture the as
sertion that biich a charge is unreasonably
high. Tee creek route Is comparatively
cheap of operation. All it requires is the use
of one ferry-boat, making its Landings and re
ceiving and delivering its passengers at the â 
wharves at the fo:>t of Broadway, Oakland,
end on the water iron! of San Francisco.
It is primarily intended for the use oi teams,
thus avoiding the danger of driving down the
long mole alongside o: moving trains, and
also eventing the overcrowding o: the boats
upon the railroad route by teams, to the in
convenience of the large number of passen
gers transported thereon. Incidentally, pas
sengers are taken on the creek bouts at the low
rate of five cents, but few care to avail them
selves of such transportation. If a passenger
desired to ro via that route to Seventh street
and Broadway, he would be compelled either
to walk seven blocks after arriving at the
whan at the foot of Broadway, or to take a
streetcar, paying therefor the additional fare
of five cents, and if he desired to go to any of
the other stations between Broadway and the
western boundary of the city, be would be sub
ject to lust so much the mote additional
trouble and expense. There is no discrimina
tion at all and the prohibition of the constitu
tion against charging a greater rate for a
shorter distance than for a longer one mani
festly applies to points upon the same route of
transportation, and not to parallel, but sepa
rate routes, over which a passenger has the
unrestricted option to travel, according as he
desire? the greater or less accommodations pro
vided by either.
Several replies have been received by
the commission to the communications
sent to all the street railroads in the State
reque.-ting them to make a report to the
commission of their operations for the
pant year. That from the Market-street
Railway Company, signed by Secretary J.
H. Willcutt, is an follows:
I have the honor In behalf of the Market-
Etreet Railway Company to acknowledge re
ceipt of a communication from your secretary
enclosing copy of an order purporiing to be
made by your honorable board on ihe 14th
day oi April, 1896, relative to the street rail
ways, and requesting certain information
d In such letter.
The Market-3treet Railway Company is ad
i>v its counsel that street railways are not
within the jurisdiction oi the Board of Rail
ommissioners of the H'atc; of California,
i'.t such board is not entitled to demand
or receive the information Bought to be ob
tained by the order above referred to. The Mar
ket-street Railroad Company therefore respect
fully declines to furnish such information.
Similar replies came from the Geary
street, Sutter-street and the Oakland street
railroad companies.
From K. H. Wade of the California
Southern Railway Company the following
self-explanatory letter was received:

WILLIAMS IS DISMISSED.
Official Head of Collector Wise':
Favorite Is Suddenly
Lopped Off.
Inspector Mike Cleary and Louie Quong
Also Scheduled for Permanent
Retirement.
Richard, better known as Dick, Williams,
has been summarily dismissed from the
service of the Chinese bureau where he
served as interpreter for several years
prior to his second indictment on sundry
serious charsres.
The official decapitation of Williams
adds another scalp to the string which
now adorns the belt of Special Agent
Moore and in a measure disposes of the
famous Custom-house scandal. The only
thing remaining is the criminal prosecu
tion against the inspector which is now
pending in the United States District
Court. From present indications, how
ever, it would seem that Williams is likely
to fare badly, though he expresses hiru
self as confident of acquittal.
Tbe dismissal of Wise's right hand
bower is considered in official circles as a
great victory over the Collector for the
special agent. When the charges against
the inspector were first brought to the at
tention of Collector Wise by Moore the
former refused to believe that the allega
tions were true, and declared that there
was a mistake somewhere. On the other
band Moore was no less positive that his
information was correct. The result Mas
a uecided coolness between the two otli
sials, and many sensational reports were
published as a consequence.
The principal point in the affair was the
Interest manifested by Wise for the sus
pected and indicted inspector. Now that
the Secretary has approved the course
adopU'fl by Major Moore, the Collector
feels a bit chagrined. Williams was first
ordered suspended April IC>, but when
Secretary Car; isle had carefully perused
the evidence offered on both sides he de
ciued that dismissal was the proper thing,
and ordered the same, to take eifect irom
the dnte mentioned.
Williams says that he has no official
notice of his dismissal from the service.
"I will say. however, that, whether I am
acquitted or not of the charges now pend
ine in the District Court," said the ex-in
terpreter yesterday, "I will not again enter
the service. There is nothing in it. In
fact, I am tired of the whole thing, and ex
pect to retire as soon as I am acquitted."
Another dismissal that may shortly be
expected is that of Louie Quong, the inter
preter of the Chinese bureau, who is at the
present time also underâ¢uspension. Even
though the Mongol has been temporarily
relieved from duty, he still visits each in
coming steamer, a fact that is considered
most peculiar. Upon good authority it is
said that Louie will be indicted by the
next (irand Jury, which meets in July.
Mike Cleary is also said to be slated for
private lile. Some days ago he was re
tired temporarily because of an assault on
Charles Favor, indicted for personating a
revenue officer. Cleary is supposed to
have been implicated in the fraud, and
whfn Favor was released on bail tne in
spector threatened his life with a pistol.
When the casa was called in the Police
Court Favor failed to appear, and the
charsres were dismissed.
Collector Wise gave it out that Cleary
been fully exonerated and would be at
once assigned to duty. It now develops
that tLe Collector either Duilded wiser
than he knew or else sought an easy
method of letting the inspector down.
Cleary is booked for dismissal, and his
companion Williams has already been
relegated to private life. For the present
Moore triumphs, and Wise sucks his
thumb in silence.
It is given out incidentally from the Col
lector's oitice that the policy of the Gov
ernment is toward retrenchment. Wil
liams' dismissal is purely a monetary
affair they say.
RIGHT OF WAY OPEN.
The Valley Road Han No More Litiga
tion in Prospect This Side of
t 'rrsno.
All obstruction to the rapid construction
of the Valley road through to Fiesno has
been reruoved. The last condemnation
suit was disposed of in Madera yesterday
and .railing and track-laying over the
recently disputed land will shortly becin.
Grading has been aimost completed to
within two miles of the San Joaquin
River. The bridae over the latter is ex
pected to be ready for tracks by the end of
July, and Fresno will probably be reached
by the middle of August.
Tracks have been laid for twelve miles
south of Merced, t tins leaving about
fourteen miles of grading and about forty
five miles of track-laying to be done.
The tracts of land which have been in
litigation in order to obtain right of way
extend for four miles, and it will require
about a week to grade this. Track-laying
v.ill then proceed at the rate of one and a
half to two miles a day.

JAMES H, BARRY
ON JUDGE CATLIN.
Pours Journalistic Grape
and Cannister Into
Him
THINKS CATLIN A CZAR.
Supreme Court Asks for a
Review of the Case in
Question.
ABSOLUTE DEFIANCE OF RIGHT.
Meeting of M.mb.rs of the Old Free
Press Defense Association To-
Morrow Night.
The writ of review asked for in the con
tempt caie of Eaitor McClatchy of the
Sacramento Bee, who was lined $500 by
Jude< Catlin ol the Sacramento Superior
Court, was granted by the Supreme Court
yesterday.
V writ of certiore.ri was issued, to be
served on Judge Catlin to-day, requesting
him to furnish the facts of the case for lhe
liilormation of the Supreme Court.
The applicant was represented by the
leading legal luminaries of the State, in
g D. M. Deiruas, P. Keddy and John
bards.
McClatchy was fined because he insisted
i Bee lepori of the testimony given in
open court in :i divorce case was correct,
and because he made some caustic criti
cisms upon Judge Catlin for denouncing
it irom the bencn as false nnd without
any foundation i!i fact.
The strung feelin? aroused by what has
b. tn termi d Judge Tallin's tendency for
aping the Czar of al! the Russias i* plainly
demonstrated by the movement on foot in
City to revive the Free Press Defense
Association, called into existence by the
famous Barry contempt case. There will
meeting of the pioneer members to
morrow niizht and Judge .lames <j. Ma
guire will undoubtedly he elected presi
dent of the association.
"Il is as. everlasting shame and dis
grace," said one <>t the leaders in the naove
ment yesterday, "that in this eniiÂ£ tened
era men are obliged to form orcra'iiz.itions
to pr-serve the liberty of speech and of
the t ress."
James H. Biirry. the editor who figured
so prominently in a former contempt case
au<! whose conviction resulted in ilu> enac
tion of the historic B:irry contempt law,
is line of the prince movers in reviving tlu
old association and freely gives his opin
ion on the action of Judge Catlin in linintr
the editor of the tiee.
â¢The summary conviction uf UcCiatchy
for contempt hi that manner," be said,
"was in absolute deiktnee of fundamental
rights. It waÂ« an example of judicial deÂ«t
potisja happily not often seen in this
country.
"Tho <'/.ar of nil the Russias could
hardly have exercised more despotic
power. McClatchy may have spoken
falsely, although [do not think he did;
but if he libeled .turtle Catlin that public
. :' hai the same redress as the Presi
dent of the United States or any other
public servant. Yes, or any private citi
zen, for that matter.
"He could have instituted a suit for
libel, where McClatchy would have had an
rtniiity to prove the truth of his as
sertions. Failing to do trii*. he should be
punished, but it is monstrous u> say that
any man hits the right to De accuser,
Judge, jury and executioner in his own
case, as Catlin was.
"By summarily convicting McClatchy,
Catlin has not cleared his own skirts of
the charges ma<ie against him. On the
contrary, he himself has emphasized those
charges by causing the pnblic generally to
believe them true.
"A Judge will be accorded ail the re
spect he deserves, nnd treated with a!l the
contempt that he earn-."
CHINESE CERTIFICATES.
Attorney-General Harmon Gives
a Written Opinion of
the Law.
Defines Clearly the Rights of Chinese
Laborers to Enter This
Country.
Collector WiÂ«e is in receipt of an im
portant opinion from the Attorney-Gen
eral regarding the certificates of Chinese.
Mr. Harmon says:
Department of Justice, (
Washington, d. C, May 26. 1896. \
Sir: I have the honor to give my opinion, as
requested in your letter of the 22d inst., upon
the proper construction of Article II of the
convention between the United States and
China, concerning the subject ot emigration,
proclaimed March 17, 1894.
By Article I the coming of Chinese laborers
to this country is absolutely prohibited for a
period of ten years. Article II provides that
such prohibition shall not apply to the return
to this country of registered Chinese borers
having certain specified relatives here, or prop
erty, or debts of a certain value ; but requires,
as a condition of the right of such laborer to
return, the deposit by him with the Collector
of Customs of the district from which he de
parts of a written description of his family,
property or debts. The Collector is required
to furnish him with a certificate of his right to
return. Article II then proceeds as follows:
â¢And such right of return to the United
States shall be exercised within one year from
the date of leaving the United States: but such
right of return to the United States may be ex
tended for aw additional period, not to exceed
one year, in cases where by reason of sickness
or other cause of disability beyond his control
such Chinese laborer shall be rendered unable
sooner to return, which facts shall be fully re
ported to the Chinese Consul at the port of de
parture, and by him certified, to the satisfac
tion of :be collector of the port at which such
Chinese subject shall lat<d In the United States.
And no such Chinese laborer shall be per
mitted to enter the United States by land or
sea without producing to the proper officer of
the customs the return certificate herein re
quired."
Your letter with its inclosure presents the
ease of three Chinese laborers duly registered
at Boston, according to law and treasury regu
lations, and furnished with proper certificates
In accordance with the treaty, who left the
country from the district of Vermont, and
after visiting China presented themselves for
readmission at the same place in the district
of Vermont, after an at.sence of almost thir
teen months. They v.-ere refused admission,
because the facts justifying the extension of
the period of return were not reported "to
the Chinese Consul at the port of departure
and by him certified," etc., the collector hold
ing snch port of departure to be Canton, China,
at which place they left that country, or
Hongkong, a British port, at which they* took
ship. It appears that there is, of course, no
Chinese Consul at Canton, and that for local
and political reasons the British Government
permits none at Hongkong.
Your inquiry is whether the "port of de
parture," at which the facts of sickness or
Usability are to be so reported, is the port
from which the laborer goes from this country,
or that from which he starts on his return.
It is a, well-known fact that Chinese laborers
who leave this country almost invariably re
turn to their own. This fact was, of course,
well known to the framers of the treaty. They
knew also that no country ha* Consuls at its
o\v:i ports. I: seems clear, therefore, that they
coul<fnot have meant the port of departure
from China.
If this be true, it appears to follow that the
framers of the tri-aty must have meant the
port from which tne laborer departs from this
country. He is required to deposit a written
description of his tamily, property or debts
"with the Collector of Customs of the district
from which be departs."
While, at first gntnee, the phrase "port of de
parture may appear, from its use in connec
-son with the pi. rase "port at which sucn.
Chinese subject snail land in the United
States," to indicate the point of beginning of
the voyage ot return, this appearance must
give way before the manifest necessity of so
construing the treaty, if possible, us to Rive it
the operation winch the parties plainly in
tended it to have. Besides, tne two phrases
niay both fairly be construed hs referring to
the I'm led states, requiring the fact of un
avoidable detention to be rej>orted to the
Chinese Consul at the port where the
person desiring to return left this country,
au.i the certificate thereof to be sent to the
collector of the port at which he desires to re
enter it.
As Chinese Consuls in this country are re
ceived by our Government and subject to re
call on their own request it was naturally will
ing to trust to their good faith, and ibe Chinese
Government, one of the parties to the treaty,
had the right to require of them the service it
imposes. The only other possible construction
if that tlie phrase," "Chinese Consul at the port
of departure, 1 ' was intended to designate our
Consuls at Chinese ports, but BUCh construc
tion wmild require an entire change of the
language used. When that meaning was in
tended, Article HI shows that the makers of
Ihe ireaty knew how toexsrsca it. That arti
providing for the rights of Chinese offi
cials, students, merchants, e:c. to come to
and reside In the Tinted btates, authorizes - 'a
certificate from their Government or the Gov
ernment where they IH.-t resided vised by the
diplomatic or consular representative of the
I'mted States in the country or port whence
they depart."
While lhe language of the section you sub
nii! is not explicit, and the- question presented
cannot, therefore, be answered with entire
freedom from doubt, my opinion is that the
officer to whom lhe facts of sickness or dis
ability are to be reported is the Consul wtio
represents the Chinese Government tit the
place trheoce the laborer left the United
btates. Wink- the words used, "port" and
"land,"' usually relate to a sea voyage, they
were used because the Chinese generally ko
ana cone by sea, and not because it was the
Intention to limit the right to return to such
as travel in that way. This is upuarent from
the last sentence of the section: "And uo
such laborer shall be permitted to enter the
United States by land or sea without pro
ducing to thÂ»i proper officer of the customs the
return certificate herein required." Instances
where expressions suggested by the com
monest form of the subject dealt witri have
been held to apply to all its forms are not un
common in judicial decisions.
Moreover, the word "port" does not always
mean fl seaport when it is used in connection
with our customs officers, and the word "land"
Is not necessarily limited to disembarkation
from a ship.
It appe ir.s to be necessary for the laborer to
: ii> country at a place which is a port
and is within the jurisdiction of a Chinese
Consul, and thai he should rot urn to it at a
port ot entry where there is a collector: but as
liN rish; to depart and return by land as well
as by sea is recognized by the treaty these
places need not be seap< â 
A.s the manifest object of this clause of the
treaty was 10 relieve returning laborers from
the consequences of sickness or casualty the
argument from inconvenience is not without
weight. Detentions from those causes are
likely to occur after the commencement
vi a long voyage, which, in their absence,
would accomplish the return before the ex
piration of the year. Bickness, storms, or the
many mishaps of,ocean travel may require the
statement mentioned in the treaty on arrival
in the United States, although it seemed un
necessary before starting. These facts must
have been in the minds of the framers of the
. yet if any other construction be
adopted than that which I have indicated :he
â¡ntortunate traveler would have to returu to
place from which he started or undergo
the U>ng delay which would be required i.>
communicate the facts to the officer at that
point aii.i receive his certificate thereof. Very
respe tiu.iy.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
GENERAL SHEEHAN
IN ANGRY MOOD,
Chafes Under the Examina
tion of Attorney
Eartnett.
DENIES ANY CONSPIRACY
Ex-Judge Carpenter Becomes
Impatient and Clamors
for the Proof.
THOSE TRANSFERS OF STOCK
Ncar.y Two Thousand Shares Placed
in the Name of Stenog
rapher Hardee.
Quite a number of witnesses were exam
ined yesterday in the suit brought by the
California Safe Deposit and Trust Con*
pany to remove General Sheehan and the
directors of the People's Home Savings
Bank. Much of the testimony was a repe
tition of what had already been sworn to.
Several of the witnesses testified unwill
ingly, and even defiantly, witnesses Shee
han and Phelps being particularly com
bative. The hit of humor in the situation
of witness Hardee, who, although he
owned no property, had been asked j
to pay over $300,000 by Attorney Flournoy,
was the main diversion of the day's trial.
Receiver Sheehan was again put on the
stand at the opening of yesterday's ses
sion. He answered the questions of At
torney Bartlett in a defiant manner, and
with a military glare referred him to the
bookkeeper if he wanted to know some
thing from the records.
A lively tilt between the opposing coun
sel arose over the striking out of Attor
ney Bartlett's amended complaint. Ex-
Judge Carpenter, in a very dramatic man
ner, declared that the plaintiffs were wast
ing time, beating about the bush, and that
they bad no case. "Let them prove the
conspiracies which they have charged,"
shouted the ex-Judge, "1 defy them to
prove it." Judge Seawell took the matter
under advisement.
In reply to Carpenter's questions on
cross-examination Sheehan denied that
he had anything to do witu the ousting of
Director Merrill. Davidson had told Shee
han before the election that he wanted to
get 'Merrill out of tne board because he
didn't understano business. In the vari
ous disbursements he had made nnd which
the plaintiffs charged as being extrava
gant, Sheehan declared that he nad done
what he thought to be to the depositors'
interests. He denied absolutely that he
had engaged in any conspiracy or collu
sion.
Sheehan's professed intention of hand
ling the affairs of the bank economically
was somewhat shaken by P.artnett's re
direct examination. When the Bank
Commissioners intended to cut down
Sheehan's salary the General represented
to them that his services were worth fully
$J;">0 a month, but he denied that he hail
appeared Oefore the board to resist a re
auction, an asked for by a petition of de
positor-.
W. E. Palmer, a clerk in the People's I
Home Savings Bank, was put on the I
stand. He wu* questioned in reference to
certain disbursements to attorneys out of
the City. This money had been charged
on the books to James Aiva Watt.
In regard to Sheehan's attention to the
business of the bank. Palmer said the
general was at the bank every day from
about 9 to 4:30 o'clock, and he thought
the general attended to the bank's business
almost exclusively.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Judge Seawell announced that he was not
yet ready to decide upon the admissibility
of Attorney Bartnett's amended com
plaint. The court announced that he
would decide the matter before this morn
ing's session. Clerk Palmer was asked a
few more questions, and after declaring
that he had not engaged in or heard of
any conspiracy for ousting Merrill, or for
any other purpose, he was allowed to de
part.
Theodore L. Hardee, a stenographer
who had been in the employ of Attorney
Watt at various times, was next sworn.
Watt had transferred stock to the sten
ographer at various times. He had never
purchased any stock. At present Hardee
is down ?s the owner of nearly 2000 shares
of stock of which he never had possession
except long enough to indorse it to Attor
ney Watt.
The stock in Hardee's name amounted
to several hundred thousand dollars. At
torney Fionrnpy had notified him to pay
some $.'532,000 last winter, but the sten
ographer had "asked for a little delay."
When asked by Attorney Bartnett whether
he had property sufficient to meet such
obligations, Hardee said if he had any
property he would like to have some one
show it to him. Hardee's recollection of
bow he had received the stock was very
hazy. He had always signed proxies for
Mr. Watt when requested to do so.
James Alva Watt, formerly attorney
for the bank, was placed on the stand. He
testified tnat he had received $.VJO a month
from about June, 18! M, to January, 1895.
He never had any exact understanding
with Sheehan as to his compensation.
When he first applied to Sheehan for
money he admitted to the general that
the latter had no right to pay him without
an order of the court.
Tnen Watt had seen Judge Hebbard
and had an understanding with him in re
gard to the matter. After that Sheehan
paid Watt his money.
Besides receiving $500 a month Watt
also received fees. In one month alone â
December, Ih94,â he received two fees
aggregatine $1000. He didn't reniemoer
that Mr. Sheehan had made any objection
to the payment of these fees. He thought
Sheehan relied upon him in the matter.
Other attorneys had been employed on
business of the bank. Watt didn't re
number whether or not he had consulted
the directors about employing them.
He denied that he had had an under
standing that h^ $50u a month included
all iegal work. He had no recollection of
having stated to J. W. Coleman, T. S.
Williams and Attorney Bartneit that the
$500 included all legal services.
He denied that he had acted as attorney
for the stockholders in resisting and de
fending a suit brought by the California
Safe Deposit and Trust Company. He
had expressed his opinion that the suit
was being improperly brought.
When asked if he had said, in a news
paper interview, that the bringing of the
suit to compel the paying up of the un
paid capital stock was legalized robbery,
Watt explained that he had expressed the
opinion to many persons that to compel
the bona-lide stockholders, who were very
few in number and wh > were as much the
victims of the .McDonalds as the deposit
ors to pay up this stock, even though it
might be legally possible, would be a
manifest injustice.
B. B. Hardenberg was put on the stand
to tell of a transfer of stock made by him
to Hardee. The stock iiad been trans
ferred to Hardenberg from If. H. Sher
man. The details of me transactions were
considerably confused in the witness'
mind.
William H. Phelps, one of the defend
ants in the suit, ascended the stand. His
answers were very defiant and often were
not responsive to the question. He had
purchased a claim from ex-Director Mer
rill with money furnished by James A.
Sevens, the attorney for M. IT. Sherman.
Phelps admitted that he would not have
purchased the claim if Merrill had not re
signed. Phelps denied that he hail been
elected director in consequence of any con
spiracy whatever. He did not know and
never had spoken to any of the directors
except Directors Johnson ana Davidson.
Several witnesses who were to testify
were not present, so the court adjourned
until 10 o'clock this morning.

VINEYARDIST FROM NAPA.
Mrs. Sadie Nichols Arrested for Rob-
Imiir C. H. VÂ«lpy.
Mrs. Sadie Nichols, who has achieved
considerable notoriety of late, and her
niece, Ella Hasten, were arrested yester
day afternoon on a warrant by Detective
Dillon and Policeman McGrayan on the
charge of grand larceny.
The complaining witness is C. H. Valpy,
a vineyaruist from Napa County. He was
in Mrs. Nichols' house, 116 Eddy street,
last Friday night, and alleges that he was
robbed of $215. He did not discover his
loss till the following day, and when he
went back to the house .Mrs. Nichols of
fered to return him $100. He refused to
accept it, and yesterday swore out a war
rant in Judge Campbelf's court for the ar
| rest of Mrs. Nichols and her niece.
Mrs. Nichols denies the allegation and
9ays that Valpy owes her $20.
PROPOSED LABOR LAWS.
E. L. Fitzeerald Intends to
Remedy Many Existing
Labor Ev.ls
Has Prepared a Synopsis to Bi In"
dorsed by the State Labor
Unions.
Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitzgerald
has prepared to be introduced at the next
Legislature a series of laws formulated for
the purpose of remedying and abolishing
many of the evils to which labor has been
subjected in the past and which, according
to the Commissioner's opinion, should be
speedily remedied.
In his letter to the labor unions of this
State Mr. Fitzgerald states that it is his
desire that those directly interested in
this legislation should first peruse and
aprove them, and if in their opinion any
changes should be made to suggest the
same to him that the laws may be abso
lutely correct and meet every demand,
t:. us saving further legislation on the
same ground. The laws brace the fol
lowing subjects:

lic work,' bakeries, re-establishing labor bu
i reau and creating free employment system,
regulating employment agents, per aiera on
public works, bakers' hours, time-check system,
branding prison-made goods, cost of suit upon
collection of wages, collusion with employ
ment agents, employment of citizens of the
United States on public work, regulating luncn
hour, and boiler inspection.
In order to make the foregoing clearly under
stood I will give a brief synopsis of same:
Eight hoursâ 3245 of the Political
Code provides that eight hours shall constitute
a day's work. The statute is not definite and
is capable of circumvention by contractors
who pay by the hour, and is therefore in many
instances inoperative, requiring an amend
ment to render its enforcement effective.
Bakeriesâ To pass a uniform law requiring
cleanliness and to insure purity in the manu
factured product of this important industry.
Governmental Boards Awarding Contractsâ
To prohibit Boards of Supervisors, common
councils, boards, commissions, etc., awarding
contracts to persons who have previously de
frauded laborers of their wages. This practice
is carried on to a large extent in San Francisco.
There being no lien on public work the laborer
is placed at the mercy of his employer with
many disastrous results.
Bond Protecting Labor on Public Workâ
purpose of this law is analogous to the forego
ing and is framed with a view of protecting
the laborer where the foregoing, through inad
vertence, might be disregarded.
Creating Bureausâ re-establish the bureau
as a bureau of labor, provide for free employ
ment offices, and to introduce provisions facili
tating the work where the present law is de
fective and inoperative.
Regulating Employment Officesâ place
those persons who traffic in labor under uni
form regulations, protecting the persons deal
ing with them, and making the said agents
amenable to law for the atrocities they have
so lone practiced.
Per diem oh Public Worksâ Creating a mini
mum price which laborers must be paid, in
suring ii livelihood, and protecting honest em
ployers against unscrupulous competitors.
Bakers' Hoursâ To establish uniform hours
for the persons engaged in this most arduous
toil; a necessary sanitary regulation.
. Time-check Systemâ To abolish the system
now in vogue throughout the State of depriv
ing laborers of their pay for unreasonable
periods; to prevent the desperate condition to
which laborers are forced through its opera
tionâone of the greatest evils, requiring proper
legislation and enforcement.
Identity of Prison-made Goodsâ Requiring
the branding of all goods made In the penal
institutions ;of the State, to distinguish the
same from the product of free labor.
Costs of Suitâ To allow the person whoother
wise cannot collect money due for labor per
formed to sue for same to the extent of fifty
(SSO) dollars without advancing costs of suit.
Collusion with employment agents â To pro
hibit employers from contracting with em
ployment agents to furnish labor and dividing
commissions paid by the latter.
Employment of citizensâ To prohibit the
employment of other man citizens of the
United States upon public work.
Lunch hourâ To provide a reasonable time
for the midday meal, obviating the evil of
labor in retail ah I merits being lorced to
visit lunch-counters and saloons for want of
time.
Boiler Inspectorsâ To provide for the proper
conduct of this important business as a safe
guard to life and property.
Appended to the above, Mr. Fitzgerald
states he considers every laboring man to
be directly interested by one or more of the
laws, and it is to his interest to see that the
same is passed as soon as possible.

MADE IN ELEVEN HOURS
A Remarkable Performance by a
Trio of Fair Cyclists of
the Mission.
A NEW LEAGUE ROAD BOOK,
Yeoman of the Reliance Club Made
the Fastest Time of Last
Sunday's Races.
Misses Mollie Mahony, Rita Mahony
and Lena Egeberg of this City, members
of the Alpha (ladies') Cycling Club, made
a remarkable wheeling trip last Sunday,
riding a "century," which is the cycular
term for 100 miles, around the bay. Tney
made the trip in a little over eleven hours,
including stops aggregating two hours,
and their net ridine timewoulabe a credit
to any wheelman who might undertake
the journey.
These young ladie9 are ardent wheel
women and have from time to time taken
many long trips into the country and re
turn of a Sunday, sometimes riding fifty
or sixty miles in a day. But they were
not satisfied with thi9; fifty-mile jaunts
were too easy; they sighed for a trip
around the bay, a "century," which so
many men have started upon and failed to
accomplish.
And so they finally agreed to make the
trial, and last Sunday was the date set.
Would they ride paced or unpaced, how
ever, was the question? It was easier to be
paced, they concluded, so two of their gen
tlemen friends were invited to do the pac
ing on their tandem, Robert Duncan and
H. L. Mayo of the California Cycling Club,
and they readily assented. They decided
to follow the accepted 100-mile course of
the California Associated Cycling Clubs,
over which the annual relay race is run,
and the party therefore met Sunday morn
ing at 4:30 o'clock at Tenth and Market
streets for the start. It was a little too
early to get any of the official judges or
timers of the associated clubs there to offi
cially start them, but Mr. Mayo agreed to
do the timing and act as judge, referee,
starter and scorer, and promptly at the
hour set lor the start tney set out, the tan
dem leading a lively pace down Ninth
street to Potrero avenue, and over the San
Bruno road.
All went well until they reached the
other side of the Six mile hill, when the
tandem broke down, and the ladies' hopes
of uacing for the trip vanished. They de
cided to push on unpaced, and the tandem
team agreed to return to the City, get an
other machine ana meet them on the
Oakland side as far down as possible.
This was done, the ladies riding to San
Mateo, where they had breakfast and then
continued on to San Jose for an early
lunch. After an hour's rest they left the
Garden City to return on the Oakland side,
pedaling against a strong head wind for
the last forty miles of the journey. They
made a short stop at Centerville, expect
ing to meet the tandem riders, but they
were not there. "We'll meet them on the
road soon," Miss Egeberg said, and with
this hope in view they rode on to Alva
radoâno tandem. Then the thought
dawned upon them that the California
Cycling Ciub had a roadrace at Haywards
that afternoon and probably their escorts
had stopped there. And so it proved, but
they met them at Mount Eden and paced
them through to the finish of the course,
on Central avenue, Alameda, rather tired
it is true, but delighted to think they had
covered the famous associated clubs' course
and had ridden a "century" under twelve
hours.
The Imperial Cycling Club will give a
ladies' night Friday evening of this week.
The California Cycling Club will give
gold century bars to their members who
ride 100 miles in ten hours or less, and sil
ver il the performance is made in less than
twelve hours.
The entries for the annual league meet
at Petaluma on July 4 will close at Peta
lunia next Friday, and none will be ac
cepted which anive later than that day.
C. K. Melrose, George H. Strong and J.
J. B. Argpnti have been appointed a spe
cial committee by the North California
Division, League of American Wheelman
to get out at once a new roadbook for the
division. The supply of roadbook? is now
entirely exhausted, and the new book will
contain many additional and valuable
features.
The growth of the division's membership
has warranted the appointment of several
new representatives at large, and Chief
Consul Kerrigan announces the following
appointments, to serve until December 1
1886: W. K. Griffith, Reliance Club Wheel
men; J. W. Harvey, California Cycling
Club; Leavitt H. Cox, Olympic Club
Wheelmen; John S. Egan. Imperial
Cycling Club. Whe Alpha (ladies') Cycling
Club has elected Miss Dorothy Pendergast
as representative from the club to the di
vision board of officers.
It has been found that there was an
error in the timing of the Reliance Club
Wheelmen's road race last Sunday, and
the corrected table gives the credit for the
best performance of the day to William
Yeoman of that club, who rode the five
miles in 12:30, four seconds faster than
the time made by P. Q. Alexander of the
California Club. Yeoman rode unpaced
the entire distance and his ride was very
creditable. The positions of the riders at
the finish were unchanged.
OBJECTIONS GALORE.
The Ashley- Baldwin Suit Becoming
I)rn\vn-out and Tir<Â«<uno.
The Ashley-Baldwin case yesterday was
one long string of objections. No wit
nesses testified, the day being taken up
with the reading of the depositions of
H. C. Chain berlin of Richmond, Va., and
Richard Y. Hard in, a correspondent of
Clark's Horse Review, with headquarters
at Lexington, Ky.
Extracts of these depositions have been
puDlisned and nothing new was devel
oped. In fact Mr. Crittenden, Miss Ash
ley's attorney, objected so often and so
vigorously as to raise a doubt if anything
at ail had been developed but his kicks.
Chamberlin's deposition told of bow
the Virginian had received letters from
Miss Ashley stating that she wanted to
correspond with a wealthy Southern
bachelor. He replied that he did not rill
the bill and then failed to answer subse
quent communieiitions, although in one
letter a photograph of the fair Lillian was
inclosed.
Chamberlin then told of meeting Miss
Ashley on a road near his homo and of
her announcing that she intended to visit
him. He forbid her going to his house
and later accompanied her to a streetcar
line and sent her away. On the drive to
the streetcars she asked him to give her
money to come to California, but he re
fused her.
Subsequently Chamberlin gave the pho
tograph of Miss Ashley to Mr. Hardin.
That gentleman met her at a horse sale in
Lexington, Ky., a year or two afterward
and visited the house at which she was
stopping. Hardin informed her that he
knew of the Cbam berlin episode and
threatened unless she immediately took
her departure from his friend's house he
would expose her. She departed.
Hardin's deposition then tells how
he wrote to E. J. Baldwin when he
read of the suit filed against him by Miss
Ashley. Harrlin told Baldwin what he
knew of the plaintiff's past and also put
Baldwin's attorney in communication with
Chamberlin.

DYSPEPSIA.
1 How to Cure Yourself.
In all forms of stomach trouble Mun-
yon's Dyspepsia Cure will promptly cure
where there are such symptoms a3 pain or
soreness in the stomach, indigestion or
distress after eating, pressure and fullness
in the stomach, shortness of breath, poor
appetite, coated tongue, sour or bitter
raising from the stomach, heartburn, wind
on the stomach, constipation, dizziness,
faintr.ess and lost energy.
When these symptoms are associated
with biliousness, yellow-coated tongue, .
nausea, bitter taste in the mouth and sal-
low ssk'in, take Munyon's Liver Cure in ai-
ternation with the Dyspepsia Cure, an
hour apart. Where there is obstinate con-
stipation keep the bowels open once a day
by using Munyon's Constipation Cure un-
til they become regular under the effect of
the Dyspepsia Cure. When there are trou-
blesome heart symptoms alternate Mun-
yon's Heart Cure with the Dyspepsia Cure.
If there is great nervousness or inability
to sleep, alternate Munyon's Nerve Cnre
with the Dyspepsia Cure. Ii the blood ia
poor in quality alternate Munyon's Blood
Cure and Dyspepsia Cure. 13y this plan of
treatment one can eradicate the worst
forms of stomach troubles and their com-
plications, and make tl|e cure permanent.

AND THEN HIMSELF,
Engineer George Stutz De
liberately Murders His
Sweetheart.
JEALOUSY THE CAUSE.
Cora Lincoln, the Victim, Was
Once a Bright Theatri
cal Star.
KNOWN UNDER ANOTHER NAME
Since Her Retirement as a Danseuse,
She Has Made a Reputation as
a Sicknurse.
Cora Lincoln, one of the "fairies" in
Tyke's Opera Company and a character
artist and -ianseuse in other Eastern com
binations, met with a horrible death yes
terday morning.
George Btu:z, a former sweetheart, called
MRS. CORA BORDEN' IN STAGE COST L ME.
upon ncr at her lodgings at 336 Polk street
at 10 o'clock in the morning, and while
words of friendship and highest regard
played upon his lips, cajoling the woman
to believe him always her faitnful attend
ant, he nursed a secret intention of mur
liering her and then himself.
It is but a cumulative chapter of the
"penalty of crime."
Two people came together. They loved
without restraint and regardless of all
social conventionalities. One became
tired of the other, who was jealously ex
acting, and in one of the usual quarrels
which were wont to end in a kiss and
make up, Stutz drew a revolver, killed
the woman and then made away with
himself.
1 1 was a clean job, so to epeak. There is
no mystery to it, and the police this time
have no clews to follow. If there are any
in the chamber where the
tragedy occurred.
Captain Lees and his men were early on
the scene, found both bodies, gathered in
their effects and, to their great satisfac
tmn, the whole thine ends there.
Stutz, who i? a German about 36 years of
u^e and a marine engineer, became ac
quainted with Cora Lincoln some two
years ago. She had bern a theatrical star
up to that time, and while her looks were
not calculated to set the hearts of men
afire, ber figure was shapely and her ways
were captivating.
Stutz admired her most in her profes
sion as a danseuse or a* a character artist.
for his room on Howard street was well
decorated with her pictures in costume.
That his affection continued is evinced by
thefactof bis frequent calls upon her at
her rooms long after she left the stage and
became a sicknurse, hiring out at so much
per week.
Cora Lincoln's life was a peculiar one.
Only a very few, and they were old-time
acquaintances, knew her under that name.
As such, the light-tripping, gay, laughing
little blonde with Pyke's Opera Company,
she won many hearts.
Later she was known as Mrs. Cora Bor
den. It was after Her trim figure had fallen
away and only her aplomb and nerve re
mained.
She was no longer fitted for the staee,
but she still had her tact and good nature
to carry her through. She drifted into
the hire of people requiring bright people
about them to cheer them during their
hours of suffering. She made a fair suc
cess, as the following recommendation
will show:
I am about leaving for the East and am
obliged to leave Cora Borden, who has been
with me for son* weeks. She is an excellent
nurse, cheerful and willingâ never too tired
to <io anything that will t-ase painâ and her
disposition is so sunny and cheerful that it is
a pleasure to have her around one. She is an
excellent seamstress and dressmaker and, in
short, can mute herself useful in any capacity.
I am writing this very hurriedly, but hope I
here made myself understood, although my
Writing is very un-tearty.
Hakrikt F. "Ki.muai.1,"3203 Pacific avenue.
June 10.
But employment as a sick nurse was not
enough to keep Cora Lincoln-Borden in
funds, so she secured employment m a
dressmaker with Mrs. Mary Barclay inihe
house where the tragedy occurred.
In the meantime George Stutz Kept com
j pany with her, frequently telling his
friends that he worshiped the ground on
which she walked.
Of late Stutz lias been despondent, and
! evidently was in fear that he was losing
j the love of his sweetheart. Their final
I quarrel indicates that lie was in a desper
| ate mood.
The iirst :-hot he fired at her went wide
of the mark. It shattered the wall back
of the sofa and broke a globe in the chan
delier.'
The frightened woman rushed to get
away, but in her fright stumbled, and
while on her knees, resting her head on
the sola, she raised her arms to protect or
hide her face.
The second bullet went through her left
side to her back, killing her immediately.
Mrs. Barclay was not a dozen feet from
the room door before Stutz had committed
suicide as well as murder.
He lired his weapon with his left hand,
blowing out hia brains.
When the officers air. ved on the tcene,
Cora Lincoln's clothes were alire from
the powder of the pistol rirtd at close
ranpe.
Officers Wren and Reynolds went to
George tStutz's room at 843 Howard street.
Mrs. Fields, the landlady, showed them
his room and told them he had been room
ing with her for about a year; that he was
an engineer and that the last steamship he
was on was the Yaqtiina. He had been
out of employment lor some time and was
$12 in debt to her for room rent. In the
closet of Stutz's room they found a box o
45 - caliber center - fire Winchester car"
tridges; five or six had been taken. The
landlady said these cartridges were not in
the closet when she cleaned the room
Monday morning. Stutz, she also stated,
never h&d a woman in his room and that
only one woman ever called to see him
v.hile he roomed there. That was some
time asro, but be was not at home and she
never came again.
She described her as a woman with
short curly hair. Mrs. Fields also said he
never spoke about women and was a very
quiet and gentlemanly man. They found
in the room two valises containing work
ing clothes and a couple of boxes of files in
the room and a hack saw in the closet.
There was no writing of any description.
Stutz's body wa-: taken charge of last
night by the Marine Engineers Associa
tion, of whicii he was a member.
"When Stutz came to this country twelve
j' ears ago he was a member of the steam
schooner Lackme's crew, running to
Alasfea. He also was in the engineers'
department of the steamer San Bias in
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
Mrs. >!:. ry Barclay's statement was
taken down in shorthand by Captain
Lees' man almost immediately after the
shooting. She was an eye-witness of the
proceedings until the time she ran out of
the room, leaving George Stutz and Cora
Borden alone. She made the following
statement:
I have known the dead woman about four
months. I think she was about 34 years of age.
She has lived here with me about a week. Sne
did my dressmaking for me and was sleeping
on my lounge until she could find some work.
This man came in about 103)0 this morning.
I sat on the rockinp-chair ami the woman
(Mrs. Burden) sat on the M>. r a and he sat on a
chair in front of her. He knocked at the door
and asked for MisÃ Lincoln. She introduced
him to me as George and told me he was a
GEORGE STLTZ-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
friend of hers who occasionally took her out.
She told me she knew him for the past two
years. They talked pleasantly a little while
and she asked him if he got her letter. He
said "No," and she said, "That is funny, 1
wrote for you to come and meet me and I
waited for you some time." The man -said,"! did
I not get any letter yesterday or this morning,"
' and he said that she was lying; that she did
I not write any letter at all. She said, "If lam
lying that is all right," and then he took out
bis pistol and shot her and 1 ran out of the
room, lie did not appear excited when he
came in and did not seem to be drinking; she
was sewing on the lounge. When I ran down
the stairs I heard another shot : this was about
10:30 this morning. The woman had a little
boy stopping over in Oakland; that is all 1
know about her.
Police Officer O. C. Phillips knew Mrs.
Borden when she kept a dressmaking
place on the 400 block on McAllister street.
I His official statement is:
The man went to her place about three
I month* ago and had a quarrel with her, and
on going out he broke a glass door, and the
I woman asked some officer for protection. I
1 don't know which officer. She then left that
I place and moved further down on McAllister,
j and I met the man once going into the place
i where she formerly was; he said he had a key
j and that he paid the rent and was at liberty to
go there. After she moved out I did not hear
of her any more.
Elmer Barbey, son of the landlady at 336
Polk street, where the tragedy took place,
also maae a statement to this effect:
Last night as I came home trom the theater,
about 11 o'clock, I met this man outside. He
inquired if Mr. Barclay lived there? I said
yes, but that it was pretty late for any one to
call that night, and the man replied, "All
right, I will come in the morning," and he
went away. _^^_____^__
POOLS IN A NEW GUISE.
May Go to Sausalito as Commis
sion Houses by Obeying
the Law.
Harry Corbeit's Sugar-Coated Peti
tion Condiliona ly Swal
lowed.
The poolsellers got knocked out in the
fir*t round in Sausalito last ni^ht.
The ball opened when the clerk finished
reading a communication from H. K. Cor
bett, asking permission to open a commis
sion house under such conditions as the
board might see fit to iniDOse.
General Dickinson said he knew of no
law or ordinance prohibiting any man
from opening a commi sioti house to sell
beef, pork or women. Therefore he would
like more information on the nature' of
what Mr. Corbett wanted permission for.
A man named Harrison, a poolseller
from San Francisco, who was present,
said there was a great difference between
a commission hou<e and a poolroom and
proceeded to explain the difference in
favor of Corbett's petition. He evidently
did not convince General Dickinson, as
was shown later, when a vote was taken
on the question of repeaiinz ordinance
No. |3.
In the meantime Corbett can open a
commission house by paying $5 for the
privilege for three months, with the posi
tive understanding that any violation of
ordinance 33 will be severely punished.
Thus General Dickinson and Mayor
Mil" or have set themselves riu'bt on what
was an issue between the residents of that
municipality as to whether the poolrooms
should be permitted to reopen by a repeal
of ordinance 33, which has prohibited
them.
The strong arm of the law has been in
voked to stop the pool-selling, and "Eng
lish Bill" .Tackman, who was arrested,
was fined $100 by the Justice of the Peace.
This victory for the Goddess of Justice
has in a measure qviieted the fears of the
'â¢hill" people that there would be pool
shops on the "front."
In the meantime the "front"' people
have not been idle, and whiie they all
recognize that the law must be enforced
as long as it remains on the ordinance
book, the only thing to be done is to have
it repeated, and a new law passed by the
Trustees licensing pool-selling at a penalty
of $100 per month.
This gilded bait has taken so well that
in a petition circulated for the repeal of
the obnoxious ordinance, 195 voters out of
330 signed in favor, while scarcely any
have signed the counter petition for the
retention of the law as it is.
The reason as given by the people on
the "hill" for tbeir indifference as to sign
ing 8 petition to retain the law is their
confidence in the Board of Trustees to
stand firm with a stiff spinal column and
refuse to repeal.
This confidence in the Trustees would be
maintained if Trustee Bperry was present,
because he is aectdedly ODPO.-ed to turn
ing Sausalito into a second Monte Carlo,
even with the advantage of bringing $1000
montblv into the small treasury-box. But
with Mr. Sperry absent and General
Dickiiifon's record of defending the pool
sellers on this side of the bay and Trustee
Ambjornson in an awkward position on a
rickety fence leaves them to pin their faitn
to Mayor Miller, with sufficient bracing
on the general dignity and manliness of
Genera! Dickinson to stand up for the
good name of the town and the wishes of
the better element of the residents who
are opposed to the opening of gambling
dens in their town.
TOOK THEIR QUEUES.
j Bow Mmosoo's Three Littln Chinese
AÂ«tors Were Frightened Out of
the Theater.
Morosco has three little Chinese boys
I who tate part in the naval drama now be
ing given at the Grand Opera-house, and
the securing of the small Asiatics has been
attended with trouble galore. In the first
place their parents had to be satisfied that
the youngsters would not b* bewitched or
given the evil eye or some other dread dis
ease, and then the boys themselves had to
' be coaxed.
During the first rehearsal the Chinese
\ fathers were present to witness the per
formance and test the question of their
children's safety. They stood in the wings
and when in one of the acts a player
rushed off the stage with a revolver in his
hand, with madness in his rolling eye
balls, the Mongols struck out for China
town.
After much persua c ion and an increase
of salary for the young actors, the little
fellows were brought back to the theater.
As is well known, a Grand Opera drama ii
; filled with the smoke and thunder of war,
and when the lirst gun was fired there was
a hurried <xit. The place on the stage
i where the infant Chinese stood were empty,
but Police Sergeant Con boy, patrolling on
I Mission street, y.'iw three small pigtails
wliisk by him und heard the (lapping of
three small blouses in the night wind ere
! Chinatown received thema^ain within her
dark but protecting arms.
"They took their cues with them," said
Conboy, who is a punster of a high order,
and knows a theatrical joke when he
sees it.

JUDGE CAMPBELL
AS A PUGILIST,
With One Blow He Knocks
Out His Clerk, T. B.
O'Brien.
THE LIE WAS PASSED.
Culmination of Several Months'
Bad Feeling Between the
Two.
WHAT LED TIP TO THE TROUBLE
The Court Had to Be Adjourned Be
cause the Clerk Was Not in
His Place.
Pugilism is in the air, and even the judi
ciary lias not escaped the infection, as was
exemplified by Judge Campbell yesterday.
The victim of the Judge's wrath was his
clerk, Tom O'Brien, and it was the cul
mination of several months' bad feeling
that has existed between them. The Judge
has on more than one occasion commented
from the bench upon O'Brien's dereliction
of duty, and in private O'Brien has retali
ated by calling the Judge a fakir and
threatenfng to "do him up" at the next
election.
Yesterday, shortly before noon, Larry
Buckley, who was acting as clerk, had
stepped out for a few minutes and the
Judge had just called a robbery case.
"Where is the clerK?" asked the Judge,
and receiving no answer he said : "This
sort of nonsense must be stopped. It is
time for O'Brien to understand that he
must stay here and attend to the business
of the court. We will adjourn till 2 o'clock
or until the clerk can attend to h'.s duties."
The Judge put on his hat, picked up his
cane and walked into the Prosecuting
Attorney's room. O'Brien happened to be
there. The Judee at once charged him
with neglecting his duties and told him he
would not stand his conduct any longer.
This led to a battle of words, till finally
O'Brien shouted, "You're nothing but a
fakir and a iiar."
"No man can call me a liar with im
punity," rejoined the Judge, and la an in
stant he shot out bis risrht list, which
landed squarely on O'Brien's left temple,
and he dropped to the floor like a log.
The Judge's blood was up, and he raised
his foot, but before he could administer
the threatened kick- Policeman Bailey in
tervened, and the Juuge, alter casting a
look of contempt upon the prostrate form
of his clerk, walked out of the room and
went to lunch.
O'Brieii, who bad been completely dazed
by tlie blow, staggered to his feet after thu
Judge had lift and b- gan pouring out his
vials of wrath upon the Judge's head,
characterizing him as a "carpetbagger," a
"faKer" and a "liar." Then he was led
away by some of bis friends nnd did not
make his appearance in court again.
When court was convened at 2 o'clock
the Judge said: "Perhaps it was an undig
nified proceeding to thrash O'Brien, but
although I am a Jodyre ' am only human,
and I will allow no man to call me a liar.
Besides, this man O'Brien has been saying
insulting things about me In court here
and also in the hotel where we are stop
ping for months past, and it had got be
yond endurance.
"He has been grossly neghctful of his
duties and has brought the court into con
tempt. The other day I convicted a man
for beating a woman and ordered him to
appear for sentence next morning. The
case was not on the calendar next morn
ing ana I forgot about it for two or three
days, when it was called to my attention
j that the man was in prison. I spoke to
I O'Brieii about it and he turned up his
calendar where he had marked the case
dismissed. That is only one instance, and
the worst of it is that 1 am bound by the
clerk's record."
The little finger of the Judge's right
hand was cut anu swollen from the effects
of the biow.
THOSE TELEPHONE ORDERS
City and County Attorney Cres
well Renders an Opinion
on Them.
The Measure Proposed by Herman de
Laguaa Declarel to B3 the
Most Complete
In reply to the communication recently
gent to City and County Attorney Cres
well Dy the Board of SapervUota regard
ing the tdepnone franchise, the legal ad
viser of the City has returned the follow
ing:
To the Honorab'e, the Board of Supervisors of
the City and County of Han Francisco â Gentle- |
men: 1 am In receipt of your communication '
dated June 9, 1890, inclosing resolution No. !
14.540 (third series). Accompanying said reso- j
lution were two tnunk orders, offered by the |
Peo;>!u's Telephone company and Herman de i
Lag act respectively, M ionns lor the proposed |
granting of a franchise for a competitive tele
phone company in the City and County of San
Francisco.
I liavo carefully examined these proposed
franchises, as requested by your honorable
boiird, together with certain amendments sub
mitted by the parties interested.
The form of iranchise submitted by the Peo
ple's Telephone Company contains the maxi
mum charge of $3 per month rental for encti
telephone instrument and cents for each ami
every switch; while the form submitted by .Mr.
de Laguna contains a scale uf charges for
monthly rental and twitches, and among them
is onÂ« for $3 per mouth rental utul 3 ceutseach
for switches. 1 have not-sufficient prÂ«ctical
knowledge to determine which is the cheaper
of the two proposals for the patrons of the
telephone service. Each form contains a
maximum rate, which is of itself a vuarantee
of competition with any company making a
greater charge.
The form submitted by the People's Tele
phone Company contains a provision that the
City shall receive the free use of forty tele
phones wihiu two years after the granting of
the franchise, while the form submitted by
Mr. de Laguua gives the City 100 telephones
free of charge for the lirst ten years of the life
of the company and fifty additional thereafter.
This is a material concession in favor of the
City an.i County in the form submitted by Mr.
de Laguna and greater than in the other.
Each form provides f.'r the payment iuto the
treasury of the City and County o/ per cent
of the gross earnings of the company receiving
the franchise.
The form of jranchise submitted by Mr. de
Laguua in the regulation of the business of a
telephone company With and in a city.is much
more complete than the form of the People's
Mutual Telephone Company.
1 herewith return thj proposed franchises
nubmiitcrt with your communication and the
proposed amendments wnich aeccuropanied
the same. Harry T. CIUMWBLL,
Attorney and Counselor.

NF.W YORK. N. V.. June 23.â Rumors relative
to Cuban affairs current yesterday led to a gharp
rise in prices a: the opening of the Slock Ex
change to-day. In the rise of i/gÂ®! per cent,
which occurred doling the first half hour of busi
ness, Sagta and the Internationals wer? most
prominent. After the traders had covered their
shorts the market, which had been unusually
active, drifted into dullness once more. .Sugar
then loomed up into prominence and on heavy
selins broke from 12U to 117%. The liquidations
in this specialty were on a beawÂ»cale. 'I he re
cent decline in the price of refined and the demcr
nlized condition of the market for raws have
created quite a bearish feeling on the stock, but
the trÂ»dÂ«-rs wcra not inclined to make any demon
s rÂ»: nn until to-day, when it was found that sup
port had been withdrawn.
With this discovery they put out short contracts
and their sales st orbed speculative lines and
the price dropped 14 per cent at a time. The
weakness i-xtenderf to General Klectric and a de
clltiefrom 31% 10 291.4 ensued. Railway issues,
alter the early rixe noted, developed weakness,
which was natural in view of the heaviness of
sugar certificates. While the decline trom ihe top
of toe diy was equal to '/bfiulVg per cent the ac
tive issues show net losi>-s"ot only VfcÂ©% per
cent. Manhattan gained % per cent and sugar
lost 2% p'-r cent.
The activi y and advance in silver was a feature
of the day's work, oo c r 500,000 ounces having
b*n traded in at the board at advancing figures.
.Speculation cosed weak In tone, 1o al sales were

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, 11.1., June 24.â V. ry little Of any
â  thing other than scalping was seen in wheat trad
, ing today. A widespread complaint at the lifeless
i condition of business continues to be h ard and
i the popular theory for 'inactivity is the a*>
; proach of the Presidential campaign. Local opera
tors furnish much of the orders to-day and few of
these were large enough to affect prices materi
ally. The receipt of 820 cars from the northwest
this morning against 664 last Tuesday and 18SI a
year ago tended 10 depress the fi-elii-g early, but
the baying of a little wheat by shorts rallied the
market equal :o the previous decline.
Chicago received twenty- five cars and inspected
I out 16,590 bushels. Liverpool cables were 14 d
I lower. streets announced a decrease in the
j world's stocKs of 5.003,000 bushels, which had the
effect of tinning prices after noon. (losing Paris
! and Antwerp cables were lower. Berlin was un
â  chanced to i/Â± mark higher. Export clearances
wire fair at 397.392 busies. September Wheat
' opened from 5"s /g c to 57 %c, sold between 57Vs<"
i and 58c. closing at 573 /4 c, V^c higher than yester-
I day. hstimaed receipts for to-morrow lorty-nine
j cars.
CORNâ Favored a declining course In which re
spect it agreed wit 1 the earner tone of wheat, and
was probably influenced to a greater or lea- extent
1 by tuat grain. The receipts were Urge at 55 cars,
I a factor which was also detrimental. Withdraw
| als from store were large at 438,9 35 bushels.
Liverpool cables were quiet. Bradstreets reported
; a decrease in available stocks of 133,000 bushels.
Export clearance* were 207.791 bushels, Septem
ber corn opened at '_'H" 8 (a)-9c. sold between '.:9c
and 28'&@28%c, closing at 27%@29c a shade
â  under yesterday. Estimated receipts for tomor-
I row 268 cars.
j OATSâ HeId an easy position both on their own
â : merits as well as through their relationship with
j the other grains. Receipts were large at 479 cars,
1 and 152,202 bushels were taken from store Ex
â  port clearances amounted to 171,958 btuheis
j Bradstreets reported an increa-e in stocks of 262,
--! 000 bushels September oats closed '.l^Yif* un
der yesterday, Estimated receints for to-morrow
190 cars.
FLAXâ Was easy. Cash, 79c: July. 78y 2 cb'.d;
September, 8OI.4C; December, B*_ >l Receipts
were 20 cars.
I PROVISIONSâ Profited at the start by a bet
! ter feeling in the hog market, but the lack of con
i fidence in values exhibited in the other markets
I did not permit of the retention for lone of the in
itial improvement. When wheat displayed tirrn
! nets during the last hour, product also made a
j slight gain. September pork closed 5c higher than
1 yesterday ; September lard and rids each a shade
j higher.

all attractive young iadies, expressed a
desire to be received into full membership
and the afternoon for the event was fixed.
As the affair was a good opportunity for
an example to be set for others it was
made public and all were invited.
At the appointed time the church was
filled. Four o'clock was the hour ser and
at that time every seat was rilled. As ihe
minutes passed away and the â  pastor did
not aDpear inquiry was made for him and
it was discovered that he was not in the
church. It was a sweltering afternoon
and the large audience did not relish the
long wait.
An hour passed away and Rev. Ed
ward Davis came not. Messengers were
dispatched around town and it was
learned that he was in San Francisco.
As 6 o'clock approached the wardens
became impatient and the young ladies
who were attired in baptismal robes did
not appreciate the situation any more.
As the light of day began to fade into
darkness an annoyed body of people de
cided that it was useless' to wait and so
they went : home, all wondering how the
methodical pastor could have failed to
keep such an important engagement.
It was afterward learned that Pastor
Davis had been attending the Ministerial
Association and had been detained. He
a note to the church, bat it miscar
ried and was not received.
The next day the baptisms were per- I
formed; but there was no' publicity at
tached ta the function, and the power of
the example was lost. Xobody but the |
four converts and a few lady friends, the
pastor and the janitor were present. Again !
if seemed as if fate had decided that the j
baptisms by immersion should not take
place without interruption. At the most |
solemn part of the occasion there was an
accident.
Rev. Mr. Davis, clad in his flowing
black robe and looking as dignified and
sanctimonious as the occasion demanded,
â was in the act of descending into the
water wh:n the steps began to shake, and
a~ the la>t one was reached it slipped from
under nis feet and the pastor and his
flowing locus were precipitated into the
water in a hurry. A young lady who was
also descending into the baptistry nar
rowly escaped an involuntary ducking.
When the excitement had calmed down
the ceremony proceeded.
The pastor has been very busy lately
explaining to his flock how it was that he
forgot all about the important engage
ment for which the Asbury Cnurch had
generously donated its auditorium and
baptistry.
NATIVE PRODUCTS ONLY,
Long List of Applicants for Space
at the August Expo
sition.
Many Pretty Designs in Fountains
and Flowers 'or the Outside
Grounds.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 23. f
The directors of the Alameda County
Manufacturers' and Producers' Exposition
are actively at work now, as the exposi
tion is to open August 3. The list of ap
plicants for space to mate exhibits is al
ready quite long, and is growing steadily.
The sense of the directors is that the ex
position shall be limited strictly to pro
ductions of the county.
The question as to how long the exposi
tion is to be kept open ha 3 not yet been
decided. A number of the directors con
tend that it would be well attended if
kept open during the month of August,
and even if the income the last two weeks
barely paid the expenses of keeping it
open it should be kept running for the
good of tho county. They urge that as
the exhibitors will nave gone to such an
expense to make a creditable display they
should be given the largest possible re
turn.
Others, however, contend that a two
weeks' fair would be all that would meet
with patronage. They hold that the fresh
fruit display would need replenishing so
often that a" longer period than two weeks,
so far as that department was concerned,
would be a failure. The matter will finally
be decided at their meeting Thursday
evening. ... ,__ .
A feature ol the exposition this year
will be the grounds surrounding the build
ing These are being inclosed by a high
board fence and are to be prepared by
landscape gardeners, and will contain
miniature tea gardens, lawns, woods,
brooks, waterfall.-, fountains and other in
teresting features where promenaders will
rind quiet rooks and corners to have a
social chat. Scattered about in tins in
closure will be the refreshraentbooths.
The following circular showing the ex
tent of the exposition is being widely dis
tributed:
The growth of manufacturing has been of
late years much greater than the people are
generally nwnre of. As to viticultural, horti
cultural and agricultural products, we believe
there iÂ» no county in the State that can equal
AUmcda in quality and variety. With these
inspiring conditions before Ã¼b, it is intended
to brine all our resources to the attention of
the people, not only of this but of adjoining
counties as well. It is, therefore, hoped you
will lend your valuable aid by making a cred
itable display.
The exposition opens August 3. All ex
hibits must be in place and all work com
pleted by August 1. The necessity of the en
forcement of this rule is evident to all. As
the Oakland exhibition ends in August, and
the State Home Industry Fair commences
September 1, there will be ample time for
those who desire to attend both.
THEY FEAR DEATH.
Superstitious Chinamen Refuse to Re-
main at the Hospital.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 23.â Gee Wing
and Gee Fong, two of the Chinese who
were murderously assaulted in their cabin
Sunday night by some white men, have
been moved from the Receiving Hospital
and taken to some place in Chinatown
where their minds will be at rest.
Tne two had occupied cots in the gen
eral ward. When W. M. Towle shot him
self on the Jerry- boat yesterday he was
brought in and laid on a cot in the same
room. The superstitious Mongolians
showed much alarm, and when he died
they took it as an evil omen and took no
rest until removed. Their condition is
quite critical, but Dr. Johnson believes
they will recover.
LOTTERY DEALER'S DEFENSE.
Claims Ho Wus Only an Innocent Wash-
house Man.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 23.â Judge Wood
of the Police Court tried Ah Goon, a
Chinese lottery dealer, arrested by Officers
Murray and Murphy at 1325 Seventh
street, found him guilty and fined him
$150, with an alternative of seventy-five
days in Jail. The defendant took the
stand and admitted selling the ticket, but
said he did .-o because the complaining
witness begged him so hard to do so. He
denied that he was the proprietor of the
place, and claimed to be an innocent wash
house man. As he had served time before
the court took very little stock in his de
fense. As he is not one of Bip Jim's
agenis he will probably serve time.
EDITH HOWELL ABSENT.
Friends Believe That She Has
BÂ°en Spirited Away From
Oakland
Only a Few Months Ago She Acci
dentally Learned Her True
Nam ?.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.l
908 Broadway, June Z } >. j
Edith Howell is missing and a Deputy
I Sheriff armed with a bench warrant has
been searching both sides of the bay for
her in vain. Miss Howell was to have
been the leading witness in the Drury di
i vorce case that was set for trial to-day in
i the Superior Court and which had to be
| postponed.
It is the opinion of the friends of J. K.
Drury that the girl has been spirited away
so that she could not testify in his behalf.
Miss Howeil is very petite, 19 years
old, and has attractive, classic features.
In her manner and appearance she eive*
indication of much inherited refinement.
: Her life has been a mystery throughout.
â  and only a short time ago did she rind out
her true name and then only by accident.
It has been stated by her that she is the
heir to a moderate estate in the East and
that she was kept in ignorance of her
identity so that others might claim what
I was rightfully hers. For a long time she
I lived with the Drarys and it was while
living with them that the circumstances
happened which form the bnsis of the
' present divorce suit. Edith Howell was a
\ witness to all this and was to have testified
i to-day as a witness for the husband.
Up to last Thursday Miss Howell was
living with a family at 517 Sixteenth street.
Her employer said to-day that Edith was
a remarkably good girl, and that her
actions for the past few days were a great
surprise. She was a sincere little member
of the Salvation Army, and my wife anl I
were greatly attached to her. She has re
sided with us about two months, and has
always been a faithful, irreproachable girl.
From various conversations it is very evi
dent that that there is a good deal con
nected with her early life that she does
not fully understand. Last Thursday Â«-he
had her day off and we have not seen her
since, although we received a postal from
her in San Francisco. She was in Oakland
last night, but I was unable to locate her.
Mrs. Hall of San Francisco, who is also
| a witness in the trial, said that Miss
! Howell stayed with her for three days
i after leaving Oakland and that she left
I last night and lias not been seen since.
"I believe she has been spirited away,"
said Mrs. Hall, 'so that she could not tes
tify. ' She is not the kind of girl that
ma"kes a habit of running away, but is a
, very upright little woman."
When the case was called in court to
i day and Miss Howell was not present a
bench warrant wad issued for her, but
although a deputy and many friends
I made a thorough search nothing could be
learned of her whereabouts and it is
believed that her absence is not voluntary.

vertise for New
Bids.
FIGURES MUST BE TRUE.
The Lowest Bidder on Paper
Must Be Lowest in
Fact.
YESTERDAY'S WORK UNDONE.
Rival Clothiers and Grocers Make
Things Lively in the Board
rocm.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)^
â  â  Broadway, June 23. f
The intricate method of awarding con
tracts so that the "lowest" bidder is able
to make the most money out of the county
was abandoned by the Supervisors at a
special meeting this afternoon. The facts
and figures published in this morning's
Call showing the stupidity and illegality
of the method resulted as was predicted,
in the bid?, being thrown out which were
not, in reality, the lowest.
Joseph Herrschor of San Leandro is the
only sufferer and he lias worked long and
hard for nothing, unless he should bid
again and be the lowest. The novel unit
system commended itself highly to the
San Leandro contractor, and by a system
t bat is quite inexplicable to the ordinary
mind he was the lowest bidder, although
his figures were $2000 higher than the
others on a contract ihe total of which is
but $50QU. In the face of the disclosures
it was impossible to award the contracts
and this afternoon all the bids were
thrown out.
The new schedule makes such bidding
impossible and each article is so specified
that only legitimate bids can be tendered.
The aggregate amount of the whole bi.i
must also be the. lowest, or it will be
thrown out.
The struggle over the supply of dry
goods to the County Infirmary nearly
provoked actual hostility. Joe Herrscher
and Joe Ha r rise were rival bidders and
the same complication arose as over the
groceries. One Joe said che other was not
an honest Hebrew snd there was a lively
reply. Each wanted to see the other's
samples, and each refused.
"What are you frightened about?"
asked Joe of San Leandro.
â 'Too many fools around," said Joe of
Oakland.
"Somebody might steal some, eh?"
"Perhaps some of them have been
stolen and might be mortgaged; see?"
â¢Now, Mr. Harris^, you may be older
than I am, but â " said Joe of San Leandro.
"Don't cut any figure," said Joe of Oak
land, and the two men struck an attitude
like that expected of Corbett and Sharkey
at the Pavilion.
The row had been considered funny up
to this point, but when Supervisor Church
thought there was a possibility of the
beautiful new boardroom bcins stained
with blood he interfered and said: "Gen
tlemen, we are here to judge samples of
groceries and goods, not anything e.se."
The Supervisors went very carefully
over the samples and a coterie of house
keepers could not have expressed more
opinions. Dr. Clark of the infirmary
made complete analyses of the wood and
coal, Mr. Church passed on the tÂ«a, Mr.
Talcott on the syrups and cabbages, and
County CierK Jordan on the infants' iood.
All the members sampled the tobacco.
When new bids are received they will
have to repeat the performance.
Never before has such interest been
shown in the annual award of bids, and
more fun is expected when the rivals meet
again.

Changes in Electric Lighting Plansâ
Republican Clubâ Bright News
Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 23.â The plant
of the Berkeley Electric Lighting Com
pany on Milvia street will be shutdown
in the near future, arrangements having
been made to secure a current from the
power-house of the Oakland Gas, Light
and Heat Company. John A. Britton,
president of the Berkeley company, ap
peared before the Board of Town Trustees
last night and sought permission to carry J
out his plans of transmitting power from j
Oakland. He said that it would be to the
advantage of his company to obtain the
current by wire from Oakland and that
the service would in no way be affected by
so doing. No objections were raised and
it was decided to permit the company to
proceed with its new scheme.
The new project of the company means
the abandonment of the plans recently !
proposed by the company to erect a $20,000 i
new power house at the foot of Charming !
way.
No More Punctured Tires.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 23.â Richard \
Knott, a West Berkeleyan, has devised a
new bicycle, by the use of which ho be- j
lieves that the problem of punctured tires j
will reach a ready solution and that the
troubles with bursted pneumatics will be
matters of history. He further claims that
by the use of his device cyclers can ride up
steep hills without much exertion, or go
down without a brake.
The tires of the new wheel as invented j
by Knott will be of hard rubber, the same i
size as the ordinary pneumatic tires, but i
the bump.-* and jolts will be received by
two pneumatic tires placed as wheels
within the main wheel, and so as not to
touch the ground. They are inclosed by
metal facesâ one on each side of the hub.
A hole of small size in one face maks it
possible to blow up the inner tires, so that
the effect secured will be indentical with
that by the tires in ordinary use.
The "motive power is exercised through
levers instead of pedals working upon
sprockets.
Knott declares that more power can be
attained with his wheel when climbing
hills than has been imagined possible
with a bicycle. He has already applied
for a patent on his device, ana is looking
forward to a rich harvest from the pro
ceeds of sales of royalties.

PERTINENT QUESTIONS.
Sergeant Bodgklna "Wants to .Know
Why Certain Par 1 Irs Are So
Interested.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 23.â Chief of
Police Lloyd and Sergeant Hodgkins will
not be weakened in the least in their
efforts to bring the perpetrators of the
gold brick swindle to justice by the failure
of the jury to convict Andrew Root, alias
Nesbit, alias Miller, alias Morton, etc., the
gentleman charged with complicity in
having fleeced Stephen G. Little, the
Dixon banker, out of $7500 on the old and
time -honored "gold brick" scheme.
Sergeant Ho<igkins in sneaking of the
case to-day said: "There are some things
in connection with the defense 1 do not
understand. Why is it this man, Patsy
Carroll, has been such a constant atten
dent upon this trial? Why is it that he
turned up in Phil Crimmins' saloon within
two minutes after I placed Gordon under
arrest? Why is it that he has been treat
ing everybody connected with the case
who would accept right along during this
trial?
"In order to see what class of people
want to see these men acquitted one
only needs to look into the courtroom
while the trial is going on. Nearly every
known crook and sporting man of the city
was in attendance."
The case of "Big Foot" Dave Gordon,
charged with being the principal in the
"gold-brick" steal, has been postponed
until July 17 by consent, when it will be
pushed vigorously by the District Attor
ney.

SHE IS HEIR TO
A BIG ESTATE.
Mrs. C. A. Lorenzen Will
Go East to Claim Her
Father's Property.
IT IS WORTH MILLIONS.
Left to His Three Children by
a Wealthy Cincinnati
Merchant.
FORTY ACRES IN THE CITY.
Discovered Her Wealth After It Had
E-caped Her Memory for
Many Years.
Mrs. A. C. Lorenzen of this City hag dis
covered that she is the heir to an estate of
great value in Cincinnati, Ohio, and is !
making preparations to claim what she
believes to be her own, by legal means if
necessary.
Mrs. Lorenzen is the wife of Christian
Loren/.en, of the firm of McFarland Bros.,
the sash and door manufacturers, whose
planing-mill is at 225 and 227 Berry street,
and resides in a cozy residence at 520 Oak j
street. Thirty years ago she lived with
her parents in Cincinnati and there met
Mr. Lorenzen.
Her father was S. Lowenstein, a wealthy |
merchant of the Ohio city, who, by thrift |
and a few fortunate turns in business, j
accumulated a handsome fortune in real
estate and securities. The wedding with
i the man who is now her husband was a
! social event in the circles in which the
; Lowenstein family moved, and shortly
after the marriage Mr. Lort-nzcn and his
bride moved to California.
A year later Mr. Lowenstein died, leav
ing his wealth to his children, consisting
of Mrs. Lorenzen and a brother and sister
who resided in Cincinnati. The principal
item of property was a forty-acre tract
in the outskirts of the city, which at that
time was rather too far from the business j
and residence centers to be of trreat mo- j
ment, but which has since appreciated im
mensely in value.
At the time of her father'n death Mrs. j
Lorenzen leceived a considerable sum as !
her portion of the estate, but no partition j
was made of the forty acres, and after ai
time it passed out of the mind of Mrs.
Lorenzen that sne was a part heir to the
tract. Recently, however, while going over
a lot ot old papers she came upon docu
ments that brought to her mind the an
cestral acres and she began an investiga
tion for more information. As a result of
her search she recalled the provisions of
her father's will, which were that this
tract should not bo sold or divided by '
those to whom it was left, but should re
main in the family.
Further investigation on Mrs. Loren- :
zens part develoned the fact that the
spread of the city had brought the tract
into the fold and that it must be in a dis
trict where town lots would command
fancy prices.
Figuring the prices of real estate in the
| F.iistern city the conclusion was arrived at
| that the tract must be worth from $I,(XX),
--i 000 to $2,000,000, and Mrs. Lorenzen at I
once made preparations to ascertain the
status of affairs and claim her own.
"Of course," she said last evening, "I
do not know how matters stand, but I do !
know that under the provisions of my !
father"s will that forty acres that is so [
valutiMe could not be divided or sold and ;
should now bo bringing in a big income.
"I shall go East to look after my inter
ests if necessary, and shall certainly push
my claims to the property, even though I
have to go to the courts."
NOVEL SCHOOL METHODS,
Interstate Correspondence of In

Pupils.
A California Girl Answers the Letter
of a Boy in Arcola,
Illinois.
A new method of teaching history and
geography la the public schools has just j
been developed, or rather it lias just '
reached San Francisco from the East.
Miss Goggin, a wideawake fifth-grade !
teacher of Arcola, 111., sent to Supenn- {
tendent Babcock the following letter, writ
tea by a pupil of her class to a fellow
primary pupil of this City, with a request |
that it be answered by some child here in
the same grade of one of our schools:
akcoi.a, 111., fleb. 20, 1890.
Dear School Friends: I thought I would
write you c lew lines as was requested by our
te&cber. She told us to write about Arcola,
hut as I just moved here the first of s-opt.
lSlij aud do not know much about Areola. I:
will name oi the things raised here first com i
or maize, "2nd broom-corn. 3rd wheat, 4th oats,
sth potatoes end most of ali vegetables. What j
all do you raise there? lielaware Ohio where ;
I came from was a great timber city. I think
there is not much lumber raised here. Areola I
is the largest broom-corn center in the world.

GLAD HAND OF
THE UNIVERSITY.
Regents Extend It to the
Bucolic Taxpayers of
the State.
FIFTY RURAL MEETINGS
College Professors Will Go Out
to the Orchards and
Hayfields.
THE AFFILIATED COLLEGES.
Appropriations Will Not Lapse, and
Work of Construction Caa
Go Ou.
The regents of the university yesterday
decided that the professors and subordi
nate instructors of the agricultural de
partment of the Berkeley institution of
learning should go to the country
and jireet the farmer in the hayfield. the
orchard and vineyard. Al 1 along the line I
oi agricultural industry from "Siskiyou i
to San Diego, from ihe Sierra to the sea,"
I the college professor will
ten led to t c bucolic taxpayer.
Fifty public meetings wiil be held in dif
ferent sections oi the Mate, the prime ob
ject being to convince the producing classes
that the university is not neglecting the
vital interests of agriculture while its pro
fessor.- are giving lofty thought to higher
.lion.
The regents authorized an expenditure
the missionary work, and did
isguiae the feet that rural sentiments
in behalf of increased appropriation of
public money for the university was the
animating purpose of the expedition.
Regents Wallace and Foote presided al
ternately at the session yesterday after
dood at the Mark Hoptdna Institute.
other regents present were : Messrs. Marye,
John E. Budd. Lynch, Black, Kellogg,
Martin, Demcke, "Miller, Hallidie, Rein
stein and Rodgers.
This scheme to appropriate money for
infusing in the rural mind a proper en- i
t usiasm for the agricultural work of the j
university was introduced to the regents i
some time ago in the form ol a report by 'â 
means committee. Two j
ways of raising money were suggested.
The hr.-t was to tax eacn student $10 a
term. 1 his was rejected. The second was
to hold fifty public meetings and then go
to the Legislature for assistance. This
Was adopted after a long discussion, in
which Regents Hal! die, Martin, Marye
and Miller opposed the proposition.
Speeches in favor of the measure were
made by Regents Wallace, Rodgers, Foote,
- em, Denicke, Lynch and Jonn E.
Budd.
J. West Martin asked respectfully If this
proposition to educate the people was not
a campaign to educate the Legislature in j
order that a large appropriation might be
obtained.
Ex-Speaker Lynch, candidate for Lieuten
ant-Governor on the Republican State
ticket, said there was a feeling throughout
California ti.at agriculture was neglected
at me university and higher education ad
vanced. Now, should it go forth that the
university was too poor to send out repre
sentatives to meet the farmers a bad ltel
ing would be produced.
Arthur Rodgers niaile a vigorous and an
aUe argument in favor of sending the
professors to school â sending them out to
the vineyards and orcuards to study the
..tare of the State, which was so
ent from the agriculture of the East
ern States.
Judge Wallace conceded that economy
in public and private affairs was desirable
and then he introduced a 'â¢but' with a
ig B to prove that the mission of the
- was to spend money to promote
something of much ereater value than
money. He observed that the people
owned the university and it was the duty
of the regents to show the proprietors
what had been done. Should more money
be needed the people would knock at tne
door of the treasury and open it.
Regent Denicke wanted to know if the i
university was to be closed because a de- I
liciency was threatened. "Are we going to !
follow the example of the City and shut
off the lights because money is scarce?"
He advocated the expenditure of $3ol>o, be
lieving that it would prove beneficial to
the State.
J. West Martin recalled the many diffi
culties and embarrassments which "the re
gents ot the past had encountered, but
through all the trials the board had never
treated a deficiency. IU wÂ«i a State board
presenting tins exceptional record of man
ag> meni, and he regretted to ace the great
principle violated.
Regent Haliidie was against the prin
ciple of cr^atin a debt.
Regent Miller said ne could not vote for
a measure which seemed like an offer to
bribe the Legislature.
A motion to refer the report to the
finance committee was lost.
The section of the report authorizing an
f-xpenditure of $3500 to hold fifty public
meetings in the rural districts was adopted
by the following vote: Ayes â Lynch,
Black, Denicke, Kellogg, Budd, Foote,
Keinstein. Rodger^, Wallaceâ 9. Noes â
Hallidie, Martin, Marye. Millerâ 4.
The rest of the report was laid over until
the July meeting.
By common consent Judge Wallace's
proposition, advanced at a previous meet
ing, to displace Professor Flagg and ap
point Professor Bonneil assistant instruc
tor of Greek, went over until the next
Bession.
President Kellogg recommended the ap
ment of S. D. Ayers, C. F. Loricke,
Leroy Jones and John looby as patrons
of agricultural stations, and* concurrence
was given.
John Calvert was appointed professor of
pharmacy, vice Seifert, resigned.
The regents received the gratifying in
telligence that Judge Wallace, Mr, Rein
stein and Attorney Mhoon had conferred
with Attorney-General Fitzgerald and the
result of the conference was the assurance
that the regents could go right ahead
with the building of affiliated colleges, as
the entin appropriation of $250,000 would
be available. It was feared at one time
that the sum of $125,000 would lapse to
the treasury by reason of delay in begin
ning the work of actual construction.
It is understood that the regents will fol
low strictly the laws of tne State regard
ing the construction of the public build
ing. The money end of the proposition
will be looked afier by the Board of
Examiners.

NOW MRS. CRAVEN
HAS BEEN SWORN,
Serenely Sat With the Con
testants Before Judge
Slack.
COUNTER SUITS BEGUN.
Counsel for Charles L. Fair Must
Come Into Court With
Papers. .
THE BIG FIGHT INTERFERES.
Lawyers Consent to Postpone Until
Thursday to Give Them a
Chance to See It.
Still the Fair will case weaves and weaves
an interminable complication.
The attorneys for Charles L. Fair have
dragged Mrs. Mettie C.-aven into court and
with her Charles K. Williams and Stephen
Roberts, requiring them to produce what
papers they may have which purport to
have been written by James (J. Fair.
While the attorneys for Mrs. Craven
are lighting off this appearance they pre
pare and secure from the court (yester
day) a counter order requiring the attor
neys for the children of James G. Fair and
the trustees of the estate under the earlier
will to appear in court with all the papers
which they may have purporting to have
been written or executed ; by James G.
lair.
That is a Roland for an Oliver.
Mrs. Craven records her deeds for the
Pine and the Mission street property form
erly belonging to Mr. Fair and straight
way begins suit for ejectment against the
occupants, claiming back rents and dam
ages. That was day before yesterday.
Yesterday Pierson & Mitchell, as attor
neys for the trustees, James S. Angus,
Thomas G. Crothers and W. S. Goodfel
low, began suit against Nettie R. Graven,
Marc Levingston, George R. Williams,
Stephen RoCerts and Elizabeth Haskins,
to quiet the title of these properties.
So every aggressive move by the alert
aggregation of legal talent on the one side
is met by a counter move on the part of
the alert and aggressive aggregation of
legal talent on the other side.
The appearance before Judge Slack yes
terday afternoon, although it brought out
the attorneys in full force, developed
nothing of a sensational nature.
Attorney F. S. I'.rittain, acting for Mr.
Delmas in the latter's absence, made the
opening statement to the court. He
called the court's attention to the fact
that Mr. Delmas had been engaged daily
for a long time in an important case ; at
San Jose, his whole time and attention
being engaged by it until the past few
days, when he became ill and was con
fined to his bed; that this (yesterday)
morning he had left the City. He was the
leading counsel for Mrs. Craven; it was
his desire to represent her in an import
ant matter of this kind; common cour
tesy would suggest that the matter be
postponed until he could be able to ap
pear.
"We have come here as directed by the
court," said Mr. Brittain. "We are eager
and ready to go on with this matter, and
have long been so. The postponements
have been the work of the other side. Our
excuse now is one that is respected always.
Our clients are in the City and are availa
ble at all times."
Mr. Brittain th^'i went over something
of the ground that he had canvassed in his
argument of the night before. He called
attentton to the fact that the provision of
the code under which the subpena was is
sued specified that the parties so called
upon to testily nmst have knowledge that
tliey alone could impart.
He read the provision and then said that
this was clearly not the case in this in
stance; that the attorneys on the other
side had Themselves the knowledge that
they sought to have the witness make
known upon the witness-stand.
He then said that W. W. P'oote had that
morning been associated with Mr. Delmas
as counsel in th hat he (F<
had asked him (Brittain) to make this
opening statement, and that Mr. Foote
would now wish to bu heard.
Mr. Foote, who had taicen a seat beside
Mrs. Craven some minutes before, rose
and said that he had had no opportunity
to speak to his clients and knew nothing
about tne case except what he bad learned
in a few minutes' conversation with Mr.
Brittain. He hoped the matter would go
over until Wednesday evening, or perhaps
the counsel on the other side would be
willing to let it go till Thursday evening,
as there was a counter attraction on
Wednesday that he was sure they were in
terested in. The attraction referred to is,
of course, the Corbett and Sharkey battle.
McEnemey, Knight, Heggerty and half
a dozen others, all sitting in a row, bowed
a ready assent.
Judge Slack said the date had been fixed
and no counter attraction sucn as indi
cated was sufficient to change it. He went
on to direct as to the making of the order
when the long row of attorneys rose up
NEW TO-DAY.

and with the one voice of a trained chorus
they cried :
"Is the date Wednesday or Thursday,
your. Honor? â we have all agreed upon
Thursday."
The court looked amused, and Mrs.
Craven's counsel >miled with a wide iron
ical smile at these lawyers late so eager for
immediate action.
George Knight helped himself and his
associates out by saying that he had only
now arrived from the East and had had
i no time to get posted on the latest phase
of the litigation and really needed the
time, so the court changed the date to
Thursday evening.
Mr. Foote had stated in the beginning
that Mrs. Craven would be perfectly will
ing to take the required oath, and she now
quietly stepped to the clerk's desk and
was sworn. Thereupon this scene in the
play dissolved.
As Mrs. Craven walked down the corri
dor, in company with her counsel, an of
ficer approached and served her with
notice in the suit to quiet title referred to.
"Do you accept service?" he said.
"Certainly," she replied, laughing. "Just
as often as you please."
At about the same time, as stated, yes
terday afternoon Dr. Marc Levingston,
proponent of the will document alleged to
be the last will of Senator Fair, related in
an affidavit following closely in form that
used by thea'torney of Charles L. Fair to
drag Mrs. Craven into court, that each of
the attorneys hereafter named possessed
knowledge of singular importance and
which they alo.ne could impart. Part of
this knowledge is declared to be in docu
mentary form. I'pon this a subpena was
issued commanding Reuben H. Lloyd, W.

Heggerty, Russell J. Wilson, Moumfonl
S. Wilson. Charles S. Wheeler, Garret W.

cuted or written in whole or in part by

tered into by Charles L. Fair, The

wherein and whereby said parties
authorized and directed Richard V. Dey to

sum not exceeding $-~>oo,ooo, conditioned
upon the probating of the will of said
James G. Fair, dated September 21, 1S I j4,
if the -same is dow in their custody.
This last clause lays bare the entire ob
ject of the order. If the proponents se
cure the presence of that document in
court and it proves such a document as
they claim, they will have succedeed in
materially embarrassing their opponents.
TROUT IN THE YOSEMITE.
The Fish Commissioners to Plant
Thousands in Its Lakes
and Streams.
A Company of United States Troops
Will LeDd Their Aid in the
Distribution.
The State Fish Commission has pent A. j
G. Fletcher to the Yosemite Valley to dis- j
tribute among the many streams and
lakes of that region 500,000 trout. Mr. !
Fletcher left last evening. He will pro
ceed directly to the Wawona hatchery,
which is located or. the south fork of the
Merced River, about twenty-five miles
from the valley.
This hatchery was built last year and j
this is the second season of its operation, i
In distributing these fish the commission
is given the assistance of the troops in !
the park, under Colonel Young, who very |
kindly volunteered to furnish packtrains
and troops to handle the fish.
The waters of the Yosemite Park are !
very extensive, comprising the different j
forks oi me Merced and Tuolumne rivers,
as well as countless lakes of good dimen- i
-ions, most of which are entirely devoid I
of lii<h. These waters, however, are well
provided with natural fish food, and un- }
questionably will sustain great quantities i
of fish, which will be available for food
for campers and tourists.
The Wawona hatchery was built by the
Washburn Brothers, who own the stage
line in the valley. The trout to be placed
in those waters are the "Rainbow" trout,
Irom Siskiyou County, and the "Mykiss," j '
or "Cutthroats," from Lake Tahoe.
Mr. Fletcher will begone about a month i
on this trip and will visit the most' remote !
parts of tiie region. The distribution i
will, however, take a much longer time.
This work will be the most important, so
lar as trout are concerned, of the Fish '
Commission this year.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 24, 1896.
WILL EXPLORE
IN VANCOUVER,
Rev. W. W. Bolton Leaves
This Evening for
the North.
A DANGEROUS MISSION.
To Traverse Trackless Forests
and Snow-Capped Moun
tains.
NO INDIANS WILL GO THERE.
An Unexplored Country That Is
Marked by a Blank on Even
Government Maps.
Pvev. W. W. Bolton, rector of St. Mary
the Virgin's Church, leaves this evening
for Victoria, I!. C, en route for an explor
ing expedition into the heart of Northern
Vancouver.
Even on the Government charts the
tract of country which Mr. Bolton and his
expedition intend to traverse is only
marked by a blank space, broken here and
there by a few rivers, suggested by dotted
lines, to indicate the fact that geographers
guess that they may be meandering some
where in the locality. No white man has
ever set foot in the trackless forests or
crossf d the snow-capped mountains of the
region which the party will explore, and
trie Indians shun the interior of the north
ern portion of the island as they would the
plague, for there is an old, old tradition
among them that devils dwell there.
Mr. Bolton is perhaps better acquainted
with the country he intends to explore
than any other white man. Two years
ago he headed the first and only expedi
tion which has succeeded in passing
through a portion of the heart of Northern
Vancouver. He undertook the work under
the auspices of the Province Newspaper
Company of Victoiia and succoeued in
passing from the northern shore of the
island to Mountain Lake through a
country of dense forests, snow-capped
mountains and glaciers.
It took him and his men two months to
make the distance, and during that time
they passed through many dangers and
privations. At ons time they were
snowed up for two (Jays on the summit of
Snowsaddle Mountain. When the storm
ceased they attempted to descend in a fotr
down the rugged sides of the mountain,
which no man had ever descended before.
Suddenly Mr. Bolton began to shoot down
a snowslide. He did not know what lay
below him, but he managed to turn over
and clutch at a rock. Two days after he
and his men went back to see the place
where he had slipped and found that it
was just above a clear drop of 2000 feet to
a lake at the base of the mountain.
At Mountain Lake Mr. Bolton's former
expedition was forced to break up camp
and strike out for the coast on account of
the approach of winter. There an Indian
canoe was bought and the party struck out
for civilization. This time Mr." Bolton ond
his followers will steam up in a little coast
ing steamer to Adams River, about seventy
miles from the north of tiie island. This
river runs out between the Newcastle
range and the Franklyn range, and it is
believed that there will be fewer moun
tains and glaciers to traverse than by
striking inland further north.
The abandoned camp at Mountain Lake,
in longitude 127 degrees 40 minutes, and
latitude north 50 degrees 20 minutes, will
be the first point which the party will aim
to reach. They will then head south for
Alberni, a distance of about 100 miles.
"We expect to change a good deal of \
this," said Mr. Bolton yesterday, pointing i
to the blank space in a Government map, j
which represented the unexplored track !
of country. "There are some of these
rivers which I feel sure are wrong, and we
hope to indicate some new lakes and
mountains."
Through the wild country with its
dense undergrowth five miles a day is a
very rapid rate of progress. The 'party
expects to be lost to the world for at least
two months. There are four of them, Mr.
Bolton, J. W. Lane of this City and C.
\V. Jones and W. Green of Seattle They
will carry nothing but absolute neces
saries, though Mr. Lang will indulge in a
camera. It is also his intention to pros
pect and if precious metals are found he
intends later on to develop the mines.
The party will carry a map with every
Indian ranch on the coast marked on it,
in order that if any one becomes disabled
his friends wili know the nearest point to
strike out to for relief.
â â¢What we shall find in there we do not
know," said Mr. Bolton. "When we come
out we will tell The Call ell about it."
POPULISTS AT WORK.
The Thirty-Fourth Assembly District
Club Opens the Campaign in the
Mission. â 
There was a fair attendance at the first
campaign meeting of the Thirty-fourth
Assembly District People's Party Club at
Mission Opera Hall last night. President
John D. Spencer opened the meeting by
reading the Populists' platform adopted at
Sacramento on May 13, and making a few
pertinent remarks thereon.
George D. Gillesnie discussed "The Two
! Old Parties" in connectionwith the recent
State and National conventions, declaring
that while the Democratic convention ot
614 members adopted a silver plank in its
platform 350 of the delegates were solid
gold men and absolutely under the con
trol of Daggett. Their action, he ex-
I plained, was due to policy only and in no i
way to loyalty to principle. In criticizing
Cleveland's bond-issuing penchant he
charged Senator John Sherman with be
ing the Democratic President's man Fri
day and his secret and most trusted ad
! viser.
There was a duet by H. Dinslaye and
! Henry Penning, followed by an address by
j Joseph Asbury Johnson on "Populist
! Chances of Success." He charged the
i Democrats with having waited until the
| Republican party had declared itself for
I gold and then taking up the cry of free
coinage for silver. He predicted that the
Populists and the men who were for silver
from principle and not from policy would
not be befuddled by the scheme of the
Democracy, but that all in favor of free
silver would unite on a common principle
and a union candidate â some man who
would favor not only free silver coinage,
! but the abolition of all National oanks
and the issuing of all money directly by
the Government.
In conclusion he saia: "You will have
seen the last of the Democratic party
when this campaign is over. It will never
run another Presidential candidate."
This met with hearty and long applause.

RETAIL CLERKS' PICNIC,
They Are to Have a Social
Time at Glen Ellen on
Sunday Next.
Half the Proceeds Will B? Devoted to
the Use of the Fifth-Street
Sufferers.
The various members of the Retail
Clerks' Association are making elaborate
preparations to have a delightful time at
Glen Ellen next Sunday. The occasion is
their annual picnic, and they have made
up their minds that nothing shall be left
undone to make the gathering a success
both socially and financially.
There is one thing connected with the
picnic that cannot fail to win the public
approbation and insure them success in
their undertaking. It is that they have
generously decided to donate half the
profits to the aid of the sufferers by the
dreadful Fifth-street disaster.
The excursion will leave the Tiburon
ferry, near the foot of Market street, at 9
o'clock Sunday morning. Casa.ssa's First
Regiment band will on that day give an
open-air concert at the landing from 8 to 9
(/'clock.

ists will travel by special boat and train,
and will be entertained with instrumental
and vocal selections.
At the grounds the day's festivities will
include a grand cake walk, open to all,
and the winners will receive substantial
rewards. Fully 250 gate prizes will also
be distributed, and for the victors in the
various games and races there will also be
suitable premiums.
One of the gate prizes is noteworthy, a high
grade '96 bicycle. It is now on exhibition
at Beamish's shirtstore, Market street.
Another special feature will be the tug
of-war between the employes of J. J.
O'Brien and Hale Bros:, and those of
O'Connor, M off at & Co. and the White
House. The posters also make mention
of a vaudeville show to be given in the
large tent. Forty people are announced

CORBETT'S HAND HURT.
Swelled From Violent Contact
With Bob McCord's
Head.
A SHAKKEY RUMOR UNTRUE.
The Betting Was a Little Livelier
Last Nightâ Prospective Maher-
Choynski Fight.
To-night is the night of the battle. The
gladiators of pugilism, stripped for heroic
physical effort, will struggle in an arena
brilliant with iigut for the supremacy.
Below, above and around them at Me
chanics' Pavilion will be a moving sea of
white, excited faces.
Which will win? Ask of the winds.
A chance or a lucky blow can decide the
contest. The admirers of the world's
champion, James J. Corbett, and the
friends and fanciers of the sailor lad,
Thomas Sharkey, each have money on
their favorite, and money shows tne sin
cerity of opinion among sportiner men.
Champion Jim may not be able to send
his good and faithful left fist with as
telling effect on Tom Sharkey's seasoned
jaw this evening as he had intended yes
terday morning. The champion arose
from his soft and virtuous couch firmly
believing that the fist which decorated the
great John L. Sullivan's face in the famous
battle at New Orleans for the world's
cham pionship, would play a tattoo on the
handsome and intelligent phiz of the
pride of the American navy, Thomas
Joseph Sharkev.
James did not even anticipate wtiat the
afternoon of yesterday would unfold. He
did not take into consideration that an
accident might possibly happen to him.
But the unexpected frequently happens,
and Champion Jim is not at the present
writing as sanguine of stopping Sharkey
as he was when he meandered to the
Olymbic Ciub yesterday afternoon to have
a short set-to with Bob McCord, the old
veteran, who was the pride of the rlub in
a fi3tic way when Corbett was taking les
sons in the manly art from Professor
Walter Watson.
McCord and Corbett met at the club
yesterday afternoon and donned the mit
tens. They .sparred gently for three rounds,
but in the fourth round they mixed
things up. The round was about half over
when Corbett called a halt.|
He had landed a swinging left-hander
on McCord's head, which caused him no
end of pain. One of the knuckles of Cor
bett's left hand was knocked out of place
and the member swelled to such an extent
that applications of hot water had to be
applied immediately. The champion suf
fered much pain lor some time, but last
evening he said that the hand was all
right again, and that he would use it to
good advantage on iiis opponent â that is,
as far as straight-arm punching is con
cerned.
It i- extremely doubtful that he will try
! a left swing at Sharkey's head, even
though a favorable opportunity may offer
to land a favorite blow.
The betting last evening was 10 to 7 that
Sharkey will remain the four rounds.
The general opinion is that Sharkey will
resort to running and defensive tactics for
three rounds, and if every thing goes well
with him up to this point of the game he
may possibly make something of a stand
before Corbett in the last half of the final
round. In fact, his play will be to remain
on deck until the gong sounds the end of
the fourth and last round.
The Marquis of Queensberry rules ex
plicitely state that if a contestant falls
without being hit the referee must caution
him and if he transgresses the rules a sec
ond time the decision must be given
against him. Will this rule be inforced '"
Last night the situation with refer
ence to the referee was that each
side was to submit a list of five or
six names and that a meeting will
be held to-day to make alinai choice. Just
what man will be picked was just as much
an unknown quantity as in the afternoon,
though there were constantly rumors afloat
that such and such a man had been
chosen.
Later last night the betting changed
somewhat. About 9 o'clock $9 to $10 was
offered that Corbett stops Sharkey in the
four rounds. The takers were not many.
There is much more Corbett monuy offered
than Sharkey money. Seven dollars
against $10 was offered that Smith beats
Davis, with some acceptance.
Harry Corbett wanted to bet $100 to ?70
that his brother, the champion, gets the
decision. There were no calls for his
money.
There was Borne haggling but in a quiet
way yesterday over the question of who
shall be the referee. Corbett has no money
to lose and practically no reputation if she
should (ail to put the sailor lad into a
dreamland with a constellation of shoot
ing stars, but on tne other hand Sharkey
has much to win or lose. The former gets
50 per cent of the receipts anyhow, but it
may depend on the decision whether
Sharkey will win $3000 or $1800. If he
stays with the champion through the four
round dance he gets $3000, but if he is
knocked out be will receive the latter sum.
Hence the sailor lad and his trainer are
somewhat anxious concerning the choice
of the referee.
The disagreement has come down to
this: With the Coroett side it is anybody
but Hiram Cook, and with the Sharkey
and Needham side anybody but Alf King.
As Billy Delaney said yesterday after
noon :
"Anybody on earth but Cook. We don't
want him and we won't have him. This
is because of his decision that the Corbett-
Jackson right was a draw.
"We will take any other good square
man," he went on. "King preferred. We
will take Patsy Hogan, Ed Homan or
Patsy Logan, l'hey would be acceptable
to us.
"Happy Jack" Harrington, Jim Ches
ley and Tommy Nolan arc also mentioned
as being agreeable to the Corbett people.
It is quite probable that the choice of
the referee will not be finally made until
this afternoon.
Needham and Sharkey point to Cook
as a man of well-known reputation for im
partiality, and say he would render the
decision according to his best judgment
regardless of whom it hurt or helped. As
serting this to be a fact they ?ay they can
not see why the other side should object
to him.
Corbett has the big end of the whole
proposition, and it may not be impossible
for him to force the other side into agree
ing on King or some other man he favors.
Corbett worked rather hard yesterday,
but not as long as usual. His trainers de
cided that he ought to let up a little, and
to-day he may not work at all, but put in
the time resting. Delaney is of this opin
ion. George Green said it was not finally
decided yet whether Corbett would train
to-day. They would see about it this

morning. Young Corbett said that the j
champion is not in condition for a finish ]
fight, but he is in shape ior four rounds.
Billy Delaney, Jim Carr and George '
Green will be behind Corbett. Needham, !
Tim McGrsth and Paddy Ryan of Vallejo, i
who will be bottle-holder, will be in Shar- ,
key's corner.
Sharkey and his trainers and a few
friends will come over to this City this af- ,
ternoon and put up at the W T indEor Hotel. :
Sharkey did some light work yesterday,
but to-day he will sprint a hundred yards j
a time or two to limber him up and open !
up the cells of his lungs.
There was a report in Oakland yesterday ;
afternoon that Sharkey had hurt his ankle.
This, if true, wouli have meant that the
fight is off, but it is entirely false. It was
perhaps put in circulation CO affect the !
bettint'.
Sharkey was seen at the Acme Athletic \
Club at 3:15 o'clock. Not only his ankles j
but every other portion of his husky an
atomy is in prime condition, and he is fit '
to make The fight of his life.
Corbett and Green were beaten at hand- !
ball yesterday afternoon by Hampton and
Pocknitz at the Olympic A'hletic Club,
and Corbett was beaten a single-handed ;
game by Hampton.
Jim Carr, who will be one of the seconds !
for Corbett to-night, is an old and re
tired pugilist, though still a young man.
He eoes into the fig-ht owing to his long
standing friendship for Corbett.
Carr has met Jack BurKe, Jack Dem p- â 
sey, Tom Cleary and others. In the fight |
between Corbett and Choynski, which was ,
attempted to be pulled off at San Rafael
some yrars ago, Carr was behind Corbett.
The fight was stopped at that time, but
finally it came off aboard a barge up in
Raccoon Slough.
At the Olympic Club next Friday even- |
ing (ladies' night) Corbett will box four;
rounds with William Smith of Australia.
Before the contest takes place there will be :
given in the gymnasium an athletic exhi- j
bition.
May Be Maher and ChoynsKi.
The National Club telegraphed Peter
Maher last evening that it would match
him against Chovnski for ten rounds, the
contest to take place in July. Maher was
instructed that in case he agreed to meet
Choynski the club would forward him
$500 to defray his expenses to this City.
An answer will doubtless be received to
day froni the Irish champion.
