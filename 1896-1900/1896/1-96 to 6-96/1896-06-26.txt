Demanded.
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 25.-The sil
ver mass-meeting at Cooper Union to
night tilled the large auditorium and all
the available standing room. The
audience was enthusiastic. Senator Ben
jamin R. Tillman of South Carolina oc
cupied a prominent place on the platform
and was cheered lustily when he entered
the auditorium.
George F. Keeney, founder of the Ameri
can Silver Organization, presided. He
said tbat the object of the meeting was to
get resolutions adopted declaring for the
free coinage of silver and urging the adop
tion of free coinage by the Chicago Con
vention.
After Senator Bixby had made a few
remarks, in wbich he said the country
needed free siver and was going to get it,
Hon. Alexander Delmar was introduced
as a recognized authority, tbe world over,
on the money question. He made a
lengthy speech in which he said that the
capitalists were not content with the high
rates of interest, but wanted to bind the
people to pay in gold, of which the,y
had a monopoly. The country needed a
medium of exchange. Gold would not do,
because it would flow out of the country.
Silver and greenbacks would do, because
they would stay here. Fifty per cent of
the business of the country, the speaker
said, is done by note, proving that there
is not sufficient money countine iv both
gold and silver, for the volume of business.
"This nation, if it is to remain inde
pendent, must devise and maintain its
own system of money," said Mr. Delmar,
"and I saw, with the monetary com mis
sions of I*7Â« and 1878. that aX attempts to
render money international are doomed
to disastrous failure."
It took several minutes for the vast
crowd in the auditorium to get through
cheenne when Senator Tillman was in
troduced. He began by paying his re
spects to the newspapers. He said that
the night would give an opportunity to
show the members of tbe audience tbat
the newspapers were unconscionable
liars. The owners of the newspapers, he
said, were prostitutes of journalism, and
not a paper in New York would dare print
his speech in full. The speaker said that
although he had been much talked about
and lied about, he had written his name
on a page of South Carolina history in
such a way that it would remain there
always. Coming to the money question,
the Senator said :
"If the Chicago Convention does not give
us Democracy and return to the faith of
Washington and Jefferson I will have
nothing to do with it afterward. The
money question is up and has got to be
settled. It is as important as was the
slavery question, and if enough of you can
get togetner to reverse the verdict of the
two millionaire conventions you will de
serve the thanks of the whole county. "
Senator Tillman referred to the moneyed
men of the East as timble-riergers, and re
peated bis assertion that Cleveland was a
tool of Wall street. Tbe Senator called on
all those who had handled god within a
year to hold up their hands. Half a dozen
hands were raised. Then he called on
those who had not handled gold coin to
raise their hands. Possibly a thousand
bands went up.

visit to Canton in the interest of this paper last Saturday.

"Then where is the gold gone?" asked
Senator Tillman. "You have not handled
it. although 1450,000,000 or $550,000,000 in
Government bonds were sold on Manhat
tan Island."
The Senator said that if he were in the
Senate committee investigating the recent
bond sale, he would ask President Cleve
land why he made a private contract to
sell bonds at 104J^ per cent, when they
were selling on the public market at 117.
He then talked about unemployed labor,
which he said was a lever by wbich those
employed were ground down to low
wages.
"You see on your own streetcar lines,"
he continued, "cars labeled 'United States
Mail.' These cars don't carry any mail.
They are put on there so the car lines can
claim the protection of United States
troops in case of a strike."
Senator Tillman characterized John
Sherman of Ohio as the high priest of
I Mammon and the joint-owner with Hanna
of William McKinley. "All of you who
are going to vote for gold, hold up your
hands," concluded the Senator. Five |
hands were held up. .
"All these who are going to vote for
silver, regardless of party, hold up your
hands." Over half the audience raised
their hands.
The speaker said, as he sat down:
"America for Americans, and to with
England and all other countries."
Clarence Ladd-Davis read resolutions
which were adopted by acclamation. They
demand the incorporation in the platform
of the National Democracy of the follow

BY ALL IN COURT.
Marriage Contract Drawn at 1823 Sutter
Street, September 22, 1892â Graphic
Account of the Writing of the
Pencil Will.
Before Judge Slack last evening, under oath, in the presence of a crowded court
room Mrs. Nettie R. Craven made the statement that she is the lawful widow of
James G. Fair â that her name is Nettie Craven-Fair.
The incident was the most dramatic and sensational that has yet taken place in
this most remarkable case.
Mrs. Craven had come into court in answer to a subpena requiring her to produce
whatsoever documents she had in her possession relating to the estate of the late
Senator Fair.
The courtroom was crowded, for sensation was down on the books to appear, so far
as sensation may at any time be scheduled.
There was with her all her intimates in the case â her adviser Roberts, her attorney
Williams, her friend and the only other witness to the pencil will, Mrs. Elizabeth
Haskins. Her daughter was with her also. The ladies sat in a group at the counsel
table with Mrs. Craven's counsel, W. W. Foote and Mr. Brittain.
The army of lawyers for the Fair children flocked at the end of the table in front
of the witness-stand. Only two of the number figured actively in tbe proceedings,
however. They were George A. Knight and Charles Heggerty, upon whose motion
the subpena was issued.
None of the papers were submitted â none were called for, in fact, until an appoint
ment was declared.
But for more than two hours Mrs. Craven was subjected to a most searching, and
at times impertinent, questioning as to her relationship with Senator Fair.
With the first question the big courtroom full oi people was on tiptoe of in
terest.
Mrs. Craven's story in brief, as was told, was that she is the widow of James G.
Fair; that they signed a contract on September 22, 1892, binding them as man and
wife. She was then living at 823 Sntter street, and it was there that she herself draw
the contract, and that they two signed it.
' There were no witnesses. From that time Mrs. Craven said she lived with Mr.
Fair as his wife, but they kept the secret to themselves. Mr. Fair, she said, did not
wish it to be made known, as his children would not like it. He was winning up his
! business affairs so that he could leave the State for a year, and then he intended to
maKe the marriage known. His death interfered.
He had made several wills in her presence. The will of the 24th of September, 1884
was written in her rooms at 2007 California street. Mrs. Hawkins called in during the
writing. Mr. Fair wrote the will twice, tirst in pencil and afterward in ink.
At the time of Mr. Fair's death Mrs. Craven was at her own home. She received,
the intelligence by telephone. She did not attend the funeral, but sent a bunch of
roses to be laid upon the casket.
After the funeral Mrs. Craven sent the will to New York for safe keeping and the
interesting story of iier journey to bring it back at the instance of the attorneys for the
Fair children â Mr. Lloyd in particular â was interrupted by adjournment.
She promised to produce tne contract of marriage, the deeds and any other of the
papers called for at the hearing to-night. -
The lawyers and R. V. Dey, subpenaed on the other side to produce the $500,000
compromise contract, were in court and sworn, but they will not take the center of
the stage for some days, if they are not to be heard until Mrs. Craven's side of the
story is told.
Mrs. Craven was addressed by Court and counsel last night as "Mrs. Fair."
This appears to be in some degree at least in accordance with the custom that
obtained in Judge Coffey's court during the Blythe trial when attorneys called Alice
Edith Dickinson Mrs. Blythe.
The night's proceedings were begun by
W. W. Foote stating to the court that
subpenas had been served upon the fol
lowing witnesses, directing them to be
present in court at this time: George A.
Knight, Russell J. Wilson, C. Heggerty. R.
B. Mitchell, Reuben H. Lioyd, W. S.
Wood, Garret W. McEnerney, William F.
Gibson, Richard V. Dey and others.
Those of them who were present were
sworn in form and then Mrs. Craven was
called to the witness-stand.
When Mrs. Craven took the stand and
was sworn a deep silence ensued in the
courtroom for the period of a dozen heart- i
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
beats. Then Mr. Knight leaned forward
in bis chair and asked in that loud, inci
sive tone of voice that belongs to him,
"What is your name?"
The witness had evidently been think
ing of this question and was ready for it.
She settled herself in the chair as she
answered without hesitation:
"Nettie R. Craven-Fair."
"When were you married to Mr. Cra
ven?"
"In August, 1871."
"When did you change your name from
Craven to Fair?"
Mr. Foote now made a protest. "I sab-2
Mit, your honor, that the whole history of
this woman is not relevant here."
"We are questioning this lady on the
circumstances incident to this inquiry.
The questions are preliminary." said
Heggarty.
The court asked for and read the affi
davit upon which the subpena was based
and allowed the question.
The witness answered : "On the 22d day
of September, 1892."
"On that day you were married to James
G. Fair?" repeated Knight.
Foote objected, but the objection was
overruled.
"i'es," said the witness.
"Where?"
"1823 Sutter street."
"Who performed the ceremony?"
"It was a contract between ourselves."
"Who wrote the contract?"
"It was written by myself and subscribed
to by both of us. 1
"Who witnessed it ? "
"No one."
"After the contract was written and
signed did you then live with Mr. Fair as
his wife?"
Objected to b}' Mr. Foote.
"We wish to show the relationship be
tween these people, and these questions
are all directed to that end," said Mr.
Heggarty. "We submit that they are
proper preliminary questions."
"This lady is a witness of their own,"
said Foote. "They have no right to tiy to
impeach her. She is ready to produce all
the papers asked for in the subpena. Any
thing iunher is extraneous and improper.
They have no right to bring these wit
nesses here for the purpose of a fishing ex
cursion."
"Here is the wife of James G. Fair,"
said Knight in reply. "She is the cus
todian of the will of Senator Fair. Who
better than the wife has a right to such
custody? We canno: jump at this thing
in a minute. We have asked nothing that
any one should blusb at. There is no
man in this room who would hesitate to
say when be was married, by whom,
where, how many children were born as a
result of the union, and all that. We
maintain that these are proper questions."
Mr. Foote still objected. "This is not a
question of what relation this Jady bore to
Fair; whether she was his wife or not.
There are four witnesses who have knowl
edge of facts which are material in the
matter before this court," said Mr. Foote,
"but none others. It looks as if we were
enacting a farce here, and you, Mr.
Knight, are the chief comedian. The
whole aim of Mr. Knight's questioning
seems to be to go imo the matter as to
whether this lady was Mr. Fair's wife.
Not a question has been asked but that is
directed at that point. Mrs. Craven has
in her possession certain documents which
we shall produce. And these docu
ments which tbe opposing counsel
are now trying to prove false are the
same papers that the gentlemen pro
nounced eenuine when submitted to them
some months ago. We Ehall produce all
the i apers in possession of the plaintiff,
but no others."
The court overruled the objection, and
Knight's question, "Did you then live
with Mr. Fair as his wife?" was repeated.
The witness, in a low voice that called
fora repetition, answered "Yes."'
"Where?" asked Knight.
'â¢Where should husband and wile lire
together?" interrupted Foote.
The witness said she did not under
stand, f
"You understand the relationship that
husband and wife hold to each other, do
you not?" a'ked Knight.
"Yes, I do," answered the witness.
"Where were you living?"
"At my home, at 1823 Sutter street."
"Did they know at the houseâ the others
who lived thereâ that you were married?"
"I do not know. "
"When did James G. Fair die?"
"December 28, 1594."
"Were you at his bedside?"
"1 was not."
"Did you know that he was sick? 1 '
"Yes."
"Why were you not present at the bed
side of the man you claimed as husband?"
After some hesitation the witness said:
"For reasons that I cannot readily ex
plain. 1 did not wish to be present."
"Did you live with him as his wife up to
the time of his death ? :
The witness said she did not understand
what was meant exactly by the question.
Knight said he did not know how he
could make it plainer. "Now," he said,
"did you ever live any where on God's
green earth with James G. Fair, publicly
as his wife? "
The court interfered and refused to
allow tbe question, because of its wording.
"It is profane," said his Honor.
"I thought if I allowed him to go he
would reach the limit himself," said
Foote.
Knight remodeled the question, still
using the word publicly.
"I don't know what you mean by the
word publicly," said the witness. "We
certainly didn't live out on the street." '
"Can you name any one person that you
ever told about this marriage?"
Upon Foote's objection the court said:
"This seems to have drifted into an in
quiry as to the marriage of Mrs. Fair. The
court used tne words 'Mrs. Fair.' "
"We are not conducting an examination
of the relations between this lady and
Senator Fair," said Foote. "It Is all very
well for Mr. Knight to talk of the sacred
ness of the marriage rslation, but that is
not the question before tbe court. There
are four witnesses who can testify in re
gard to the instruments under question
before this court, and only four. I submit
that Mr. Knight's questions are not pro
pounded in good iaitb, and that all the
facts he is attempting to bring out are
irrelevant."
Judge Slack, however, thought that in
asmuch as she was the purported cus
todian of the Fair will Mr. Knight's ques
tions were pertinent.
Knight, however, shifted bis position.
He ?aid :
â¢ "I will leave this branch of the question
and enter into one to which there will be
no technical opposition." To the witness:
"Did Mr. Fair leave a will with you?"
The witness leaned forward and quietly
answered, "Several."
Knight was not astonished. He asked
with an unchanged tone of voice: "Have
you ever proffered auy of these wills for
probate?"
"Yes, I Have."
"Tell us how many wills "he did write
that you know of?"
"Seven."
"What became of them?"
"Some of them he took with him; some
of them be left with me. There was one
that was stolen," she said significantly.
â¢â¢Now tell us, did Senator Fair ever leave
% a last will?"
"I don't understand what you mean by
a last will. If you ask me whether he
made a will dated September 24, 1894, I
say that he did and left it with me."
"Where was that?"
"At my rooms at 2007 California street.''
"Who were present?"
"Mrs. Haskin, JJn. Craven and James G.
Fair."
"Was Mrs. Fair present? "
"If you want to put it ao, yea."
"It was you wLo put it that way," said
Knight.
The stenographer raised the question as
to the exact wording of the answer.
"Mrs. Nettie Craven Fair will tell
you," said Knight.
Mrs. Craven complained to the court
as to Knight's repeating the name in the
manner he did and the court said he
would see that she was protected.
Knight explained that there was a Mrs.
Fair, a Miss Craven and a Mrs. Haskin in
this matter. The stenographer wanted to
be set right. As for himself he would
address the witness as Mrs. Fair, as she
testified she was Mrs. Fair.
Toe witness said the manner, not the
wording, was wnat she objected to.
Knight said he was behaving as politely
as he knew how; that he was not aware of
anything in his manner that should offend
the lady. He resumed:
"Did Senator Fair write the will in your
presence?"
"Yes, eir."
"How was it writtenâ with lead pencil or
pen '!' '
"With both."
"What became of the documents?"
"I sent them East to my daughter at
New York about the first week in Janu
ary, 1895. That was after Mr. Fair's
death."
"Were you in Sacramento in January,
1895?"
*'I was, part of the time."
"To whom did you first make known that
James G. Fair had left a holographic
will?"
"In appearing before the Educational
Committee of the Assembly I mentioned
to Senator Earle, I think, that a wealthy
man had left $50,000 to the educational
fund, should an act be passed as we
wished. I did not mention a name."
"What did you send your husband's will
East for?"
"It was not generally known through
out the City that we bad a contract of
marriage, and the very fact of his death
suggested that it need not be known. I
did not want any notoriety."
"Wrs there anything in your relation
ship with Mr. Fair that you should be
ashamed of?"
"No. Mr. Fair did not want it for himself
on account of his children and known other
reasons. He did not want his children to
know until he could get his business in or
der so that he could leave the State for
good."
"Did you know of Mr. Fair's whereabouts
after your marriage?"
"Yes."
"Where was he?"
"At different places.' 1
"Did you ever receive a letter dated at
Yuma from him?"
"Yes."
"How were they addressed?"
"I can't remember."
"Were they addressed 'My Dear Wife?' "
"I couldn't say."
"What became of the letters from your
husband?"
"I sent them to lowa."
"Why did you do that?"
Mrs. Craven leaned forward in her chair
and, looking at Mr. Knight, said:
"I did it so that you folks couldn't steal
them."
The court said to the witness:
"You have called upon mÂ» for my pro
tection from your questioner. I shall
have to request that you answer the ques
tions properly."
"Whom do you mean by 'you folks?"
asked Knight. "We would like to know."
The court interfered a^ain, saying the
witness had been cautioned and would
confine herself to a proper answer to ques
tions.
"But," said Foote, rising, "I maintain
that the answer is a proper one and I stand
here to insist upon it retaining its place
in the record. Papers hav.e been stolen.
There is no doubt about that. They call
it 'abstracted,' but I don't see any differ
ence in the bearing in this regard."
"By whom, tbouph?" asked Knight.
"Who stole or abstracted them? We
would still like to know?'
"Ob, I can't say," said Foote.
The court said he had instructed the
witness bow to answer, but Foote per
sisted in his position that her answer was
all right. The court insisted that he take
his seat and as he still continued to talk
Judce Slack announced that he would fine
him $25 for contempt.
Upon this Foote subsided and Knight
resumed :
"Whom did you send the letters to in
Iowa?"
"To W. W. Cherry, in Colnmbus."
"Why; was there anything in the letters
that the public should not see?"
'â¢No; I wanted them to be safe, that was
all."
"When did you hear of Senator Fair's
death?"
"The same night that he died."
"Who communicated it?"
"Ii was telephoned to me."
"Did you not remember that night that
you had a holographic will?"
"I do not know."
"Did you not look at that will that
night?"
"No."
"You knew you had it at the time the
will of the 21st was filed?"
"Yes, but I did not mention it then. 1
did not want the notoriety at that time."
"Were you interested in the fact of your
husband's death?"
"Ye.-."
"You were alive to all the circumstances
attending it, were you?"
"I was not dead."
"Now, did you know that another will
had been proffered for debate?"
Objection made and sustained.
"Why did you send that will out of the
State?"
"I did not want the notoriety and I
thought I could file it within ten months.
I wanted time to think about it."
"What do you mean by notoriety? Were
you ashamed of the marriage?"
"No. I thought that with all the Fair
money the heirs could give me trouble."
"What trouble did you expect from the
Fair children?"
"I don't know exactly how to answer.
I don't know what you desire."
"It is not what I desire."
"1 thought they would dispute the fact
of the marriage contract. I feared the
same trouble that Archbishop Riordan
had about the gift to him. They would
dispute it all. I did not care for the will
so much. There was nothing in it for
me."
"What notoriety did you fear then?
It was the notoriety as to your marriage
with Mr. Fair?"
"No!"
"Did you ever have that notoriety?"
Objection sustained.
"Did you attend your husband's
funeral?"
"No."
"Why?"
"I never attend the funeral of any one,
no matter how near."'
"Did you send so much as a daisy to
grace his casket?''
The form objected to and sustained.
"Did you send any flowers?"
"Yes; 1 sent, a bunch of roses."
"Where were you the day of the
funeral?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FKJLDAY, dUJNJi; 220, jlovx,.
The House at 2007 California Street, Where Mrs. Craven Resided and Where the Holographic
Will Was Written.
The witness could not Temember.
"What was the condition of your mind
on that day?"
"Somewhat disturbed."
"Was it so disturbed that you could not
remember where you were or what you did
on the day of your husband's hurial?"
"I think I was at home in bed."
Again Foote objected to Knight's line of
questioning. "This certainly is a most
vicious method of examination," he de
clared. "I say 'vicious' advisedly, for
when you want to do so, Mr. Knight, you
certainly can do it as viciously as any
body."
The court overruled Foote's objection,
however, on the ground that such an ex
amination was allowable, because the wit
ness was the custodian of the papers for
the possession of which the contention was
being made.
"Was Mrs. Haskins living there?"
"What do you mean by living there, Mr.
Knight? It was not her home, no. She
called on me that day â the day the will
was made."
"Your husband was there when Mrs.
Haskins came?"
"Yes."
"Did he write two wills while he was
there?"
"There were not two wills. One was a
copj', one being written in ink. Mr. Fair
wrote the leadpencil will first. He copied
it himself in ink. Jin. Haskins came in
after part of it was written."
"Did you dictate any part of it?"
"I dictated two clauses which he incor
porated. One was about the teachers and
the other gave to Charley Fair $500,000 to
even up on the others."
"Do you know Charley Hildebrand ?"
"No."
"Were you at the trial of the Martin will
case ?' '
"For about fifteen minutes."
"Do you know Mrs. Martin?"
"No."
"What kind of paper was the will writ
ten on?"
"On some large paper that I happened
to have for typewriting." â¢
"What kind of paper was the ink will
written on?"
"On similar paper."
"Have you that will?''
This question brought Mr. Foote to his
feet. "Have you got it?" he inquired.
"Have any of you got it? We would like
to know where it is. If, as has been inti
mated, tbe other side have the will let
them produce it or forever after hold their
peace."
Knight laughed at what he said he con
sidered a joke of Foote's, but the court
took the matter seriously and put the
question to Mr. Knight as to whether he
had the will or not.
Knight protested against the court ask
ing him whether he had a paper which, be
said, his Honor knew he t Knight) did not
have, merely upon an idle remark by Mr.
Foote.
Foote objected to Knight's reference to
his remarks as idle talk. "I was in earnest
when I demanded an answer of Mr.
Knight. I object to having my remarks
called idle talk."
The court called upon Mr. Foote, who
was becoming quite vehement, to take his
Â»eÂ»t, and threatened to fine him. as:&in lor
! contempt â time more heavily than
â¢before.
"Well, I don't want to go broke on this
i proposition," said Foote, as he sat down.
When order was restored Knight
i answered for himself and Heircerty that
j they had no such document as Foote inti
mated. Foote still wanted to know
whether any of Mr. Knight's associates,
Mr. Lloyd or others, had the will, but
Judge Slack said Foote might later place
them on the stand to find out whether
they had the document in question, v-u:;:
This dismissed, Mr.' Knight resumed
questioning the witness.
"When you left this City to go East to
get the wills under \vh*t name did you
travel?"
"I took the name of Mrs. J. S. Came
ron.". â .
"Why?"
Because there was a great deal of ex
citement and I did it for my own safety.
I did not wish to be known."
"Did you not receive telegrams at al
most every station in cipher, addressed
to the name of Cameron?"
"I would not swear to it." She admit- *
ted that she communicated with Mr.
j RebertÃ in cipher from ' New York, how
ever. She said the cipher was a written
book, of which she and Mr. Roberts had
copies; that they had had it for several
years.
"What was the necessity of your having
a cipher with Mr. Roberts?"
"The same necessity that I have had for
several years in soing to New York. I did
not wish to telegraph openly on business
affairs." ; , â¢ â¢
"Did you have a cipher with anybody
else?"
The witness said that she communicated
in cipher with Mr. Milholland of the New
York Tribuneâ nobody else. .
Here followed a long series of questions
about the cipher and about the precau
tions taken in bringing the will back,
Mrs. Craven being taken ill in New York
and there wag doubt as to whether she
should undertake the journey. She knew
that John W. Mac Key was interested in
the Fair children and she called on him,
' but he was not in. She saw his son.
When she started West ft was not certain
that she could get beyond Chicago, so it
was appointed that a Mr. Tichner should
meet her. She assumed the name of Knox
on the return in order to avoid
detection, and it was . arranged
that . she . wear her 'â _â  handkerchief
on her bosom so that he might recongnize
her in the station. She forgot the sign,
however. She took a hack rather than a
carriage in being transferred from station
to station as the safer way. She was very
ill. A man came in and addressed her as
Mrs. Knox and said something about the
papers that he would ; arrange ; about it
and the train moved on.
Foote here pleaded for an adjournment.
He said the witness was not well and had
been tired enough.
Knight insisted, that -the. interesting
story of the journey with the valuable
papers should not be interrupted.
Mrs. Cravenâ or Fair, as Knight in
sisted on calling her,â called for a glass of
water and said she was feeling faint.
â¢ Judge Slack ordered an adjournment
until this evening at 7:30 o'clock.
The question of the production of the
deeds was raised by Knight, and both
Foote and firittain assured the court that
the deeds would be produced at the next
session of the court.
An adjournment followed and the par
ties to the drama, the lawyers and the
crowd of the mixed curious filed out.

PEFFER OPPOSES
TELLER'S BOOM,
Denounces the Taubeneck
Manifesto in Behalf of
the Silverite.
WAS NOT AUTHORIZED.
It Tends to Prevent the Union
of All Foes of the Money
Power.
HOW TO DEFEAT M'KINLEY.
He Says a Combinatian of Silver
Forces Can Alone Accomplish
This End.
WASHINGTON. D. C, June 25.âSena
tor Peffer of Kansas does not expect Mc-
Kinley's defeat this year except by &
union of all tbe free-silver forces. On the
other hand buch a combination, he be
lieves, will sweep the country. This was
the cantral thought of Senator Peffer's
utterances upon the political outlook
to-day with a United Press reporter. In
cidentally the Kansas Senator sharply
criticized Mr. Taubeneck, the secretary of
the Populist National Committee, for the
party manifesto issued by him in St. Louis
a few days ago.
"This manifesto," he said, "was in the
nature of an appeal, signed by Mr.
Taubeneck and other gentlemen, advising
our people to support Senator Teller for
the Presidency when the Populist Conven
tion meets. It was a mistake and it was
wholly unauthorized.
"The leading iaea of our people, when
we formed our party, was to bring about
ultimately a union of all the different re
form elements of the country in opposition
to the power whicn is now recognized by
the term 'money power,' so that we might
be ready at any ti^p to join forces with
the other organizations which, like us, are
in this opposition. But we want them to
do what we have done; stand with the
present organization, so that together we
may form one party which will combine
these various elements of opposition. If
the silver Democrats and silver Republi
cans meet us on that ground, we ought in
turn to make an equal advance.and by com
bining, form a solid organization against
the common enemy; for 1 Oelieve that all
the Bigns of the times indicate that the
gold men â Republicans and Democrats â
will unite to defeat the silver movement.
I think also that our party should main
tain its present organization solidly, until
some arrangement can be made for a per
manent union of all the elements I refer to.
"In case the Democrats adopt their
usual platform at Chicago, making no
allowance for recruits from other sources,
and naming a ticket composed of old
school Democrats, pledged to no reform
except that of silver, our people will refuse
to act with them. We could, however,
form an offensive and defensive alliance
witn them in the Northwest, South, South
west and west and still keep our several
organizations intact. In that way we
could bring all the strength of the silver
people to bear in the electoral college."
When asked if this would hot be tanta
mount to indorsing the Democratic nomi
ne* Senator Peffer said :
"No; it would operate this way and take
State 3 like those in the Northwest, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado.
Nevada and others in that region, where
i the Democratic vote is very light at the
I best. There we would have only Populist
electors, because the Democrats are not
sufficiently strong to change the political
complexion of the vote. In some of the
Southern States, where there are more
Democrats than Populists, there could be
a mixture of electors representing both ele
ments in proportion to their voting
strength, with the understanding that the
solid electoral vote be cast whichever way
it could be made the most effective in de
ciding the election for President. I see no
other way to maintain our separate organ
izations and get a combined strength
against the Republican candidate."
"In this event, who would be seated â
the Populist or tlie Democratic nominee?"
"That," replied Senator Peffer, "is a
matter of detail which could be settled
after the election."
"Under the circumstances, could you
defeat McKinley?'
"I shall not say that I doubt it; but I
fear it would not be successful. I don't
Believe that such a policy would bring out
anywhere the full silver vote of the coun
try. It would have the appearance of
division, and that alone would deter a
good many who would support a single
organization. National in its character.
Hence, I say, the importance of a union
of all the silver forces in one new body.
If we can secure such an organization we
shall carry the election."
VOTE AGAINST TELLER.
Ban Jose PopulUts Heprecate the Taube
neck Manifesto.
SAN JOSE, Cal., June 25.â At a meet
ing of the People's party Central Club of
this city to-night, a resolution was intro
duced declaring that it was the sense of
the club that Senator Teller be selected as
the choice of the People's party conven
tion for President.
As soon a<s the resolution was read a
number of prominent Populists took the
floor in protest. It was claimed that the
Populist party had made the silver issue
and that if Senator Teller wanted its sup
port he should tirst declare his allegiance
to the platform of that party; that the
silver-question was only a minor issue in
the platform and the repudiation of tho
other principles by the Indorsement of a
man who has been antagonistic to the
party on every question except silver,
would be to the lasting disgrace of the
party.
Chairman Taubeneclc of the Populist
National Committee, waÃ severely scored
for what was termed "his betrayal of the
interests of his party by his action in ad
vocating the indorsem ent of a free silver
Republican at the expense of its other
great principles, by the side of which free
silver pales into insignificance."
The resolution was defeated, only the
man who offered it voting in the affirma
tive.
Tavbenecfc : Makes A'o Reply.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 35.â Chairman
H. E. Taubeneck of the People's party
declines to say a word respecting Senator
Peffer's harsh criticism of his course in
putting out the recent Teller circular. It
is expected that Taubeneck will make a
reply in a few days, in which he will show
that the circular issued was authorized by
the executive committee of the People's
party.

HOLT WILL CASE CLOSED.
Termination of One of the Most Cele
brated Contests in the History
of the Country.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 25.â The
Holt will case, which has been on trial in
this city for several weeks, was Closed at
a late hour this afternoon, and at 8:30 the
jury returned a verdict in favor of the
caveators, the effect of which is to set the
alleged will aside, or, in the words of the
decision of the jury, issue substantially a
declaration that the paper presented for
probate is not a true testament. This case
has Deen one of the moat interesting of its
character that has engaged the attention
of the courts here for a very long period.
The application for probate has been ear
nestly urged and as stubbornly resisted
as any similar case ever presented in the
courts of this district, and able counsel on
both sides have fought bitterly in the in
terests of their respective clients. Tbe
verdict has been looked for with more than
usual interest in this controversy. The re
sult leaves the case exactly where it was
before a sudden anonymous presentation
of the alleged testament reached the office
of the Register of Wills, several months
ago, and the heirs at law, who have had a
desperate ie^al fight on their hands, are
to-night receiving the congratulations of
their menus.

The State Convention of
Colorado's Silver
Advocates.
TELLER FOR PRESIDENT.
Several Sensational Addresses
Attacking the Money
Power.
AN APPEAL TO THE PEOPLE.
The Government Urged to Return to
Constitutional Gold and Sil
ver Standard.
DENVER, Colo., June 25.â Five hun
dred delegates from two- thirds of the
counties of this State organized to-day the
first State Convention of the National
Silver party, adopted a platform and
elected delegates to the National Conven
tion which meets in St. Louis July 22.
The convention was harmonious and en
thusiastic. The platform is a strong
declaration for silver, and declares alle
giance to any other National party and
candidate for the Presidency that accords
with this view on the financial question.
Senator Henry M. Teller is indorsed for
the Presidency.
Hon. I. N. Stevens, acting State chair
man, called the convention to order. He
reviewed ihe history of the movement
which created this new party, and stated
that its purpose is solely to unite the
people of the country upon one common
candidate for the Presidency who will
favor the restoration of silver to full legal
tender money power. Senator H. A. W.
Tabor was selected as temporary chair
man and David Day of Durango secre
tary.
After the committee on credentials had
reported a permanent organization was
effected by selection of Hon. Platt Wicks
of Pueblo permanent chairman and Mrs.
Sue M. Hail secretary. While awaiting
the report of the committee on resolu
tions Hon. Lafe Pence, Hon. J. B. Belford
and Judge D. V. Burns delivered sensa
tional addresses, the burden of which
were attacks upon the money power. They
urge a campaign to unite the people un
der one candidate against.the goldites and
their demands.
When the committee on resolutions re
ported a long address in the form of an ar
gument for free coinage, which also se
verely attacked opponents to this idea, a
storm of protests to the language and style
of the platform ensued. After a long dis
cussion the comnrttee was ordered to pre
pare another platform. A recess was then
taken until evening. The delegates named
include many prominent men oi the State
of all political parties.
Upon reassem bJing in the evening the
convention adopted a short platform with
out discussion. The money plank is as
follows:
The paramount issue at this time in the
United States is indisputably the money ques
tion. It is between the gold standard, gold
bonds and bank currency on one side and the
bimetallic standard, no bonds and Govern
ment currency on the other. On this issue we
declare ourselves to be in favor of a distinctly
American financial system. We are unalter
ably opposed to the single gold standard and
demand the immediate return to the constitu
tional standard of gold and silver by the
restoration by the Government, independently
of any foreign powei, of the unrestricted coin
age of both gold and silver in standard money
at the ratio of 16 to 1 and upon terms of exact
equality aa tney existed prior to 1873, the sil
ver coin to be a full legal tender equally with
gold for all debts and duties, private and pub
lic.
The resolutions indorse Senator Teller
and recommend him for the Presidency,
but failing to secure him they agree to
support any other silver candidate.
The platform closes with the following
appeal:
We therefore confidently appeal to the peo
ple of the United States to leave in abeyance
for the moment all other questions, however
important and even momentous they may
seem, to sunder if need be all former party
ties and affiliations and unite in one supreme
effort to free themselves and their children
from tha domination of the money power.
Upon the consummation of our desires and
WILFRID LAURIER, LEADER OF CANADIAN LIBERALS.
MONTREAL, Quebec, June 25.â Wilfrid Laurier, the Liberal leader, in an inter
view to-day said: "We have been elected on a platform of tariff reform, and it is on
thoMj lines' we intend to worlc. We shall apply ourselves at once to a revision of the
tariff but whatever we do will be done gradually and slowly; and, moreover, no
steps' will be taken likely to affect any particular interest without due notice
bavins been given so that all concerned may know what our intentions are and
why we consider it expedient to make the contemplated changes." With regard to
the school question, Mr. Laurier stated that it would be settled in the House of
Commons. He had not decided yet upon the composition of the coming Liberal Cabinet.
efforts we invoke the gracious favor of divine
providence.
The convention adjourned immediately
upon the adoption of the platform.

"My treatment was anything but fair. In

"You did not say in your speech that

SICKNESS A LUXURY.
Comprehensive Preparations for
the Physical Welfare of Demo
cratic National Delegates.
CHICAGO, 111., June 25.â There will be
a new departure at the Democratic Na
tional Convention. Under the auspices of
the sergeant-at-arms a medical and surgi
cal staff will be in constant attendance
durintr the sessions.
Colonel Martin's plans were sufficiently
advanced to-day for him to outline them
to the United Press. He said that the
records of accidents and sudden illnesses
of visitors and delegates at former Na
tional conventions, particularly the last
one in St. Louis, had convinced him of
the necessity, on humane grounds as well
I as for the good order of the convention, of
providing a staff of able physicians and
i surgeons. An ambulance, stretchers and
| all appliances and remedies for instant
! use when the emergency arises in the
Colliseum or in the crush outside the build
ing will be on hand.
To that end he has commissioned Dr.
Herbert H. McAuley of this city, chief of
the staff, and on the latter's recommenda
j tion seven prominent Chicago physicians
I and surgeons will also be appointed. From
among the visitors to the convention from
other cities Colonel Martin will appoint
eight eminent doctors to the staff, who
will respond to any call for service.
The attendance hours of the Chicago
men will be so arranged that Dr. McAuley
i and two others will be constantly in the
hall. A room is to be fitted up for tueir
special use.
SEATTLE BOLTERS.
Republicanism Renounced by a
Number of Men Friendly to the
White Metal.
BEATTLE, Wash., June 25.â About 100
Republicans from this city and county
met to-night, renounced their party and
effected a permanent organization for the
purpose of commending Senator Teller
and furthering the cause of silver. Dr. V. G.
Calhoun, a Republican Presidential elec
tor for this State in 1892, was president.
Speeches were made by Hon. John Wiley,
Colonel George G. Lyon, Judge J. L.
Crotty and others, Crotty declaring that
the only mistake the St. Louis Convention
made was in not nominating Grover
Cleveland instead of Major McKinley.
Every mention of the names of Senators
Teller, Cannon and Dubois brought forth
the wildest applause. Twenty delegates
to attend the State Bimetallic Convention,
to be held at Tacoma on June 30, were
chosen.
Ohio's Silver Wave.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 25.â The Third
Congressional District, the last to elect its
delegates to the Democratic National Con
vention, last night selected two men sup
posed to favor the single cold standard.
The Ohio delegation to the Chicago con
vention, as now fully chosen, will contain
forty free silver members, four single gold
standard advocates and two doubtful.

Filibusters Pursued by a
Revenue Cutter
Escape.
LIVELT MARINE RAGE.
The McLane Fires Four Solid
Shot at the Fleeing
Commodore.
ONE HUNDRED REBELS ABOAED
Box-s of Arms and Ammunition Are
Transferred From Waiting
Schooners.
TAMPA, Fla., June 25.â When the
steamer Commodore left Port Tampa this
afternoon she was followed by the revenue
cutter McLane, the latter having orders to
stop the suspected filibuster. Captain
Morton of the Commodore saw the Mc-
Lane in pursuit and crowded on steam,
and a lively race began. As the Commo
dore gained the McLane sent four solid
shot after the filibuster and the latter
came to. The McLane's commander
searched the Commodore, b;* nothing
contraband was found. The Commodore
was allowed to go and the McLane started
back to port.
Six miles down the bay, however, the
Commodore came to ana was approached
by three schooners. Nearly a hundred
men and scores of boxes of arms and am
munition were transferred from the
schooners to the Commodore. The Mc-
Lane's commander saw this transfer by
means of his glasses and again pursued
the Commodore. The McLane gained at
first and fired on the Commodore repeat
edly, but the shots fell short. The power
ful engines of the Commodore soon told,
however, and she began to forge ahead.
When the boats passed St. Petersburg,
the Commodore was leading the McLane
six miles. As the McLane has no coast
pilot, she will have to lay to during the
night and this will enable the Commodore
to make good her escape.

The Secretary's Mysterious Absence Is
the Cause of Speculation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, June 25.âSecre
tary Olney returned to Washington last
night after his mysterious absence of sev

THE CASE OF MR, KNAPP.
He Is Charged With All Sorts
of Crimes by the Gov
ernor of Bitlis.
From Carrying Off a Moslem Girl to
Murder and Inciting Revo
iu'Kn.
(Correspondence of The United Press.]
CONSTANTINOPLE. Turkey, June
10. â Yesterday the Porte communicated
to the American legation the report re
ceived from the Governor of Bitlis regard
ing Mr. Knapp. This Governor charees
Mr. Knapp among other thing with hav
ing given the signal for the attack by the
Armenians upon the Moslems. This
signal was the ringing of the church bell.
(Be it remembered that not a single Mos
lem was killed during the Bitlis massacre).
Mr. Knapp is further said to have mur
dered a certain Armenian or pai<Rnen to
do it. According to the report he aided
in carrying off a Moslem girl, was an or
ganizer and leader of a revolutionary
party and was in communication with a
certain Hamoartsouin, well known in con
nection witli the Sassoun massacre and so
on. The whole report covers two full
pages. The document seemed to imply
that it was expected that the American
legation would deal with sucn a danger
ous character.
Mr. Knapp will remain in Constantino
ple, and is eager to have the charges
brought forward and investigated. His
family arrived here from Bitlis yesterday,
having come by the northern route.
Advices from Sassoun state that an out
break occurred there last week between
Greeks and Turks, in which ten Greeks
were killed. Those philo-Turks who were
so much interested in the continued able
efforts of the Turkish Government to suc
cor the distressed in Asia Minor by form
ing a relief commission, under the presi
dency of the Sultan, may be interested in
the report published this week. When
this commission was formed last winter
there was a great blast of trumpets. It
met two or three times a week, and a full
report of eacD sitting appeared in the offi
cial journal?.
Two weeks were spent in drawing up
regulations and appointing clerks. Two
weeks more 'were spent in selecting the
colors and kinds of tickets to be issued.
Then changes were made in its organiz
ation, and less was heard of it. Eight
weeks ago everything was ready, and the
journals announced that donors' names
would be published, and those who gave
$40 or over were to receive a decoration.
Last Sunday's papers published the re
port up to the present. The commission
had collected $250 for the relief of the poor
and $&50 to rebuild destroyed mosques.
(Not a single mosque had been touched
during the massacres). This report ex
cited ridicule among the Moslems them
selves. Those who had published the re
port were severely reprimanded, and yes
terday's papers reported that donations
from the ministers and the Sultan had
brought the totals up to $1000 for the re
lief of the sufferers and $1400 for rebuild
ing mosques. Of this sum the Sultan gave
$240. This is the last of this commission.
LETTER FROM GLADSTONE.
The Grand Old Man Denounces the Sultan
and His Agents.
LONDON, Enq., June 25.â The Chronicle
will to-morrow publish a letter from Mr.
Gladstone on the subject of the Armenians,
in which he says:
"Nobody uses language half strong
enough against the Sultan and his agents.
To describe their guilt is beyond all
bounds, and the language ought to go be
yond all bounds. My choice is between
far out-Heroding everybody or absolute
silence, for my language abstractly
might plausibly be ascribed to temper,
whereas it would be perfectly cold
blooded. I am silent only for fear of doing
harm. The European mind wants plaus
ible excuses to cover its disgrace. I do not
wish to furnish them/
The Constantinople correspondent of the
Chronicle telegraphs that the Armenian
losses during the recent rioting at Van are
estimated to have been 1500 killed, while
the Turkish loss was 200. The disnatch
adds that the Kurds are gathering from all
directions to pillage Van.
Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley Dead.
ST. JOHN, N. 8., June 25.â Sir Samuel
Leonard Tilley, ex-Lieutenact-Governor
of New Brunswick and at one time Min
ister of Finance in the Dominion Govern
ment, died this morning. He was 78 years
of age. Sir Samuel was a native of this
province, descending from one of the loyal
ist families which left the United States
after the revolution.

DUC DE NEMOURS DEAD,
Passing of an Orleans Prince,
Once Elected King of the
Belgians.
Twice Declined to Wear a Crown
When Offered by the National
CoDgress.
PARIS, Fkance, June 25.â The Due de
Nemours died at Versailles to-day.
Louis Charles Phillippe Raphael d'Or
leans, Due de Nemours, one of the Orleans
princes, was the second son of King
Louis Phillipp|, and was born in Paris in
1814.
He was elected King of the Belgians in
1831, but his royal father declined this
offer of the National Congress on his be
half, as he did also at a later period, a
similar offer of the crown oLGreece.
After the revolution of Tebruary, 1848,
the Due de Nemours quitted France, and
did not return until after the downfall of
the empire in 1870. He has since played
a very insignificant part in Royalist af
fairs.
J'enth in a Squall
ST. PAUL, Minn., June 25.â 8y the cap

Exchange, Minneapolis; bis sister, Miss
Anna T. Putnam, a kindergartner, em
ployed in the Minneapolis Kindergarten;
Miss Bessie Newhall of Minneapolis, and
Mrs. Herman of St. Paul. The party had
proceeded not more than 100 yards "from
the shore when a squall struck the boat.
It capsized and all went down, no assist
ance being close at hand.

During a Terrific
Squall.
STORY OF A BRITISH CAPTAIN
The Sea Was Running Tremendously
High, Rendering Assistance
Impossible.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 25.â Fears are
entertained that the ship reported as
foundering in the South Atlantic by the
British ship Loch Breden, just arrived at
Liverpool, is the City of Philadelphia,
which Bailed from New York February 2
with a general cargo for San Francisco.
The City of Philadelphia carried a crew of
twenty-five men and her master, Captain
Johnson, bad his wife and family with
him. She was spoken last on March 3in
latitude 14 degrees 5G minutes south,
longitude 34 decrees west.
Captain Cornell of the Loch Breden re
ports that on March 21, in latitude 36 de
grees, longitude 40 â or in about the posi
tion the American vessel was likely to be
in after eighteen days' sailing on her
courseâ he sighted during a gale a full
rigged ship about two miles distant, under
three lower topsails, laboring heavily. The
next morning he saw her again, the seas
breaking over her. Suddenly, at the height
of a terrific squall, at about midday, she
lurched over and disappeared. The seas
were tremendously high and it was be
lieved that the craft had sprung a leak.
All on board must have perished.
It is possible that the City "of Phila
delphia may arrive safely at her destina
tion, and that it was the doom of some
other vessel witnessed Dy tne master of
the British ship.
She is considerably overdue, however,
and the foundered vessel's description
closely tallies with her. Sixty guineas
premium were paid in London on her in
surance this week.
The City of Philadelphia, which regis
tered 1400 tons, was built in Bath, Me., in
1857, and Waiter P. Cagar & Co. of Phila
delphia are her managing owners.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC GREED
Kentucky Fails to Collect the
Charter- Tax From the
Railroad.
Talk of Repealing the Grant Under
Which the Corporation Is
Operating.
FRANKFORT, Ky., June 25. â The
Southern Pacific" does not pay and never
has paid a cent of taxes into Kentucky's
treasury, although the road owes its exist,
ence to and is now operated in California
on a charter passed by a Kentucky Legis
lature in the winter of 1884. After a hard
struggle, the railroad having a giant power
behind it and one of the strongest lobbies
that ever held sway in Frankfort, the State
Board of Valuation and Assessment, which
has the fixing of values of corporate
franchises, has taken the matter of taxing
the company tinder consideration. Al
though the board would like to find some
way of rating the road nnder the pro
visions of the revenue law, by which it is
authorized to fix a rate, it has up to this
time totally failed to reach any officer or
agent of the road upon whom it may serve
notice.
While the board has been carrying on
this investigation Auditor Stone, who is a
member of the board and to whom the tax
would have to be paid direct, has turned
1 he matter over to the personal supervision
of Assistant Auditor Frank H. Johnson,
who has given the matter thorough inves
tigation. Mr. Johnson said to a Call
representative:
"Section 8 of the charter reads: 'The
annual tax upon said corporation shall be
the same as is now fixed for brokers'
licenses, provided that all property owned
by said corporation and situated in the
State shall pay the same State and local
tax as is assessed upon similar property,
and capital stock in said corporation
owned by citizens of the State shall be
assessed against the holders thereof as
causes in action under the equalization
laws.'
"The broker's license is only $250, but
the road has not even paid this, and I see
no disposition to comply with the plain
terms of the iaw. Although there may
be no property in the State, the road is
operated on the charter which provides
for the payment of the tax that is cer
tainly dpe the State. It seems very diffi
cult to reach the road, and the Kentucky
officials can find nothing in the State to
levy on. It is known that if the road
shows no disposition to coiiply with the
law it is the intention of the officials to
recommend to the Legislature the repeal
of the charter on this ground.
"Senator William Goebel introduced a
bill in the Legislature last winter provid
ing for a repeal of the charter and made a
gallant fight for it, but was met by a forci
ble and effective lobby and he leceivedno
assistance from the State officers. While
this point was referred to by Senator Goe
bol and his colleagues, the lobby, which
was composed of several members of the
Btnftte and combined corporation lobbies,
had gained such headway it was successful
in deferring the matter before the com
mittee until just before the adjournment
I gfis.sion, when it came up and the
i Mil met its Waterloo. With thisof
fx.inl stigma on the road, and re-in forced
by tho efforts of the State officers, there
would be little doubt of a second bill at
th* next session or at any extra session
pasting."
Moneu- Orrfrr Clerk Disappears
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind, June 25.â
W. r >r<-"ne, money-order clerk of

not been unable to locate him. Greene is a

FOR A NEW TRIAL.
Murderer Walling May let Escape the
Death Penalty.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 25.â Judge
Helm this afternoon heard arguments for
a new trial of Alonzo Walling, one of the
alleged murderers of Pearl Bryan. The
-defense produced affidavits showing that
Jurors Ware and Miles, after being sum
moned as jurors and before beinji ac
cepted as such, stated that the defendant
ought to be hanged. This was quite a sur
prise, and Judge Helm said he would not
pass upon the motion for a new trial until
next Monday. Subpenas were issued for
the two jurors and affidavit-maKers to ap
pear in court on that day. If it is proven
the jurymen made this statement Walling
will undoubtedly get a new trial.
REHABILITATION SCHEME.
Creditors of Abbey, Schoeffel & Grau Will
Place the Firm on Its Feet
Again.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 25.-The re
organization committee of the creditors of
Abbey, Schoeffel & Qrau held a meeting
to-day and formally adopted a plan for a
final adjustment of the finances of the
embarrassed firm.
William Steinway, as chairman of the

the total indebtedness of the firm waa
$365,000, and that creditors representing
over $335,000 of that amount had given
unqualified consent to the scheme of re
habilitation proposed by the reorganiza
tion committee. The claims of the
smaller creditors, aggregating about $10,
--000, will be paid at once in cash. Tne
larger creditors will receive stock to the
amount of their claims in the newly or
ganized firm of Abbey, Schoeffel & Grau,
which practically began its career to-day
free of all encumbrance and without a
cent of indebtedness.
Messrs. Abbey, Schoeffel <fe Grau will
confine their operations exclusively to
the management of the Metroniitan
Opera-house in this city and the Tremont- I

DETROIT IS SHAKEN UP,
Furious Storm of Wind, Rain
and Lightning Sweeps Over
the City.
For Forty Minutes the Water Falls
in Torrents, Turning the
Streets Into Rivers.
DETROIT, Mich,, June 25.â A severe
wind and rain storm, accompanied by
sharp lightning, swept over this city this
evening. The storm came out of the
northwest. The wind reached a velocity
of 48 miles an hour and created havoc
among the shade trees all over the city.
The rain fell in torrents for forty minutes,
tiie downpour measuring 1.19 inches in
that period of time. The sewers were un
able to carry off the deluge of water, and
many of the downtown streets resembled
rivers for awhile.
The first rainstorm was followed by
others at short intervals, and when they
ceased the precipitation had reached 2.25
inches.
The street railway companies suffered '
severely from lightning, a great number ofV
motors being burned out. There have
been no reports of injuries to persons.
IOWA TOWN VISITED.

MILLS TO SHUT BOWS.
Manufacturers and Operatives Unable to
Agree Upon a Scale,
YOUNGBTOWN, Ohio, June 25.â This
afternoon the conference committees of
the manufacturers and amalgamated men
met to discuss the scale question. Presi
dent Garlnnd presented the scale as pre
pared at Detroit and set forth the claim
upon which they based their action in ask
ing for an advance of 50 cents per ton on
the boiling card. On the part of the
manufacturers it was stated that it was
impossible to pay $4 50 for puddling until
business would improve, if the advance
was insisted on the only recourse cf the
mill-owners would be to shut down.
The conference adjourned without agree
ment to meet in Youngstown again on
July 9. As this carries it beyond the
present scale all mills will shut down next
Tuesday night.

cently sent an agent to the Fox River
Valley district, where most of the filled

as well as the manufacturers for the oper
ation of the tilled cheese and license law

TRAMPS IN GREAT PERIL
Killed a Minnesota Sheriff and
Are Threatened With
Lynching.
Troops Called Out, but They Will
Probably Arrive on the Scene
Tod Late.
ST. PAUL, Mixk., June 25.â Infuriated
citizens of Southern Minnesota are trying
to-night to lynch the two tramps who
yesterday killed Sheriff Rodgers of McLeod
County. A posse of 250 men chased the
desperadoes all day and caught them in a
swamp five miles west of Arlington early
this evening. As soon as the news spread
mobs began to move forward from Glen
coe, Green Isle and Hutchinson. The
prisoners were hastily taken to Glen roe.
This saved them for a time at least, bnt
the Governor was wired that the deputy
sheriff in charge at Glcncoe could not
pre vent a lynching. All the militia com
panies of that part of the State were
taking their regular summer outing in
camp at - Lake City and were unavailable.
Governor Clough therefore ordered out
Company C, First Regiment, stationed in
St. Paul, and that company left St. Paul
for Gleneoe at 10:40. It will arrive there
at 1 o'clock, but ttie news from Gleneoe at
11:30 indicates that there will be a lynch
ing before tbat time,

READ'S FOR THE RACE.
The College Crews Prepared for the Con
test on the Hudson.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N. V., June 25.-
Lowerinc skies, a chilly atmosphere and
an occasional drizzle of rain made the day
before the great Varsity race a dismal
one. No excursion steamer, yacht or boat
of any kind except the referee's boat and
the two police boats are to be permitted to
follow the racing crewe. This provision
will assure the oarsmen a clear course and
freedom from wash. Four lines, marked
by stakeboats, are laid out. The positions
drawn by lot and numbered from the west
bank are": No. 1, Harvard; No. 2, Penn
sylvania; No. 3, Cornell ; No. 4, Columbia.
Should the day prove stormy or the
water too rough the race will be postponed
until Saturday.
The crews got in their final polish to-day
! and all are tuned up to the pitch for to
i morrow's great struggle.
The prevailing opinion as to the result
of the struggle that is looked for is: Cor
nell first; a desperate struggle for second
honors between Columbia and Harvard,
with a slight tide of sentiment in favor of
the blue and white, and Pennsylvania for
the outside position.

LAVERONE CAUGHT
NEAR RED BLUFF,
Sheriff Bogard of Tehama
Captures the Madera
Fugitive.
WORKING AT A RANCH
The Outlaw Is Found Engaged
on the Top of a Stack
of Hay.
YIELDS WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
He Describes His Escape From Blood*
hcunds by the Use of Cayenne
Pepper.
RED BLUFF, Cal., June 26.â Sheriff A.
Bogard of Tehama County to-day cap
tured W. A. Laverone, the notorious
young* outlay, who some months ago broke
jail at Madera.
About a week ago the Sheriff had an
intimation that the fugitive was in Tehama
County, and he has been on the alert since
then to locate him. He wrote to Sheriff
Westfall ol Madera several days ago, mak
ing inquiries, but had received no answer.
He wired for an immediate answer this
morning, and received in reply a full de
scription of Laverone. Sheriff Bogard had
suspected a certain person, and when tnis
description was received he at once went
to the ranch of Frank Miller, about two
miles south of Corning. There he found
the man he supposed to be Laverone. The
fellow was at work on the top of a hay
stack. The laborer was toid 4o come
down from the top of the stack.
On reaching the ground he was at once
placed under arrest. He cheerfully com
plied with a request of the Sheriff that he
should bare his arm, and with the assist
ance of J. J. Donovan his shirt was re
moved and vaccine marks were discov
ered. He then admitted that he was the
man wanted, and became very talkative.
Laverone gave a full account of his
escape; how he sawed off the bars of the
Madera jail, and the details ot his travels
since then. He said he had a caseknlfe in
his cell and procured a file, but he would
not say where tne file came from. The
knife was converted into a file, and the
work was then easily done. He and his
partner, Roberts, got a horse and cart as
soon as they got out of jail, Laverone get
ting the cart and Roberts remaining to
see that the jailer did not awaken until
Laverone' s return. They drove about
eleven miles, when the cart broke down.
Tbey then went up on to the mountains
east of Madera, where they got something
to eat at a sheep camp.
At this point the bloodhounds were
placed on their trail. To throw the
hounds off the scent they sprinkled cay
enne pepper over their shoes, and the re
sult was all they could have hoped for.
The next day they were so close to the
hounds that they could watch them, but
they felt safe, as the hounds would not
follow the trail. They went to a small
town on the railroad, where they stayed
for four days, sleeping in a barn. Then
they boarded a boxcar and went northward
for some distance, when he and Robeits
separated.
Laverone went to the town of Tehama
and secured work at the sheep ranch of E.
H. Ward. Next he went to John Rob
bins' ranch, where he worked for a time.
He came to lied Bluff, but soon departed
for the country. Then he went to his
uncle, a rancher near Tboines Creek,
northwest of Corning. After staying
there a short time, he went to Miller's,
where he was captured.
Laverone refuses to give any informa
tion regarding Roberts' whereabouts, al
though Sheriff Bogard has closely ques
tioned him.
Teharna County has a Sheriff who never
tires when on the chase. In many re
spects he resembles his brother, J. J.
Bogard, the Sheriff who w&s killed by
"Jack" Brady at the time of the Wheat
land train robbery.
WORK AT PACIFIC GROVE.
Topics Discussed in the Hummer School
of Methods.
PACIFIC COAST, Cal., June 25.â The
summer School of Methods this morning
considered the relation of the temperance
work to the children of the State. The
session was under the auspices of Mrs.
Eyster, State superintendent of the juve
nile department of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union. The discusion of
best methods of enlisting the co-operation
of teachers of the common schools in the
scientific temperance instruction demand
ed by the law of the State was shared by
Mrs. R. Johnston, late principal of Ade
line School, Oakland, Dr. Mallory of Au
burn, Mrs. Hoppin of Yolo, Mrs. Hood of
Stanford University and others of equal
ability.
In the afternoon an able address upon
"Child Culture" was delivered by Mrs.
Hood. A paper entitled "The Mothers of
Great Men" was read by Mrs. Ada Van
Pelt of Oakland, and a scientific discourse
upon "Bacteria in Alcohol," profusely
illustrated, was delivered by Miss Jennie
Norton, daughter of the late Professor H.
B. Norton. The day closed with an even
ing entertainmentâ a lecture upon Hawaii,
accompanied by stereopticon views, by
Rev. Dr. Dille of Oakland.
FRESNO'S BOY THIEVES.
Two Youths in Durance for a Series of
Midnight Raxds.
FRESNO, Cal., June 25.â Willie Grady,
aged 14, was to-day convicted in the Supe
rior Court on a charge of burglary. He
and a boy named Chenoweth broke into
Hobbs & Parsons' packing-house and stole
a number of articles. The two have quite
a criminal history, having been arrested
for thievery a number of times. Owing to
their tender years they have always es
caped punishment.
Near the home of Chenoweth, who has
already been sent to Whittier, was found
a cave which tae two boys had excavated
under a shed. In the "cave was a large
amount of plunder, representing many
raids by the youthful thieves. While in
jail awaiting their trials, about three weeks
ago, the boys escaped through a hole in
the door while the jailer was in another
part of the establishment.
FRESNO MA NTA'S FREAK.
Seeks Police Protection Front an Imag
inary Enemy.
FRESNO, Cal., June 25.â An insane
man came to the County Jail this evening
and asked to be taken in charge. A large
black man, no said, waa after him to kill _
him. Deputy Sheriff Peck questioned the
fellow, who was badly frightened. When
he saw Jailer Manley he said Manley was
the man who wanted to kill him. Manley
had to retreat, while Peck placed his new
guest behind bars.
"My name is Smith, but it will not be
that very long," said he. "That fellow is
going to kill me. I just came across the
river" from Illinois to-day, thinking that
here in lowa I could find protection."
The unfortunate man raved in his cell.
HiÂ» clothes were dripping wet with per
spiration from his race to get away from
his imaginary enemy. No one here knows
who he is or where he came from.

A FEUD AT SACRAMENTO,
Armed Mongols From Los An
geles Invade the Capital
City Chinatown.
They Come to Carry Back a Maiden
Spirited Away From the Citrus
Belt.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 25.â There
came near being a highbinder battle jn
Chinatown to-night, and it is liable to oc
cur at any moment. A few weeks ago a
local merchant married a woman who was
brought here from Los Angeles. The
southern citrus-belt Celestials called it a
case of kidnaping and sent a lot of armed
fighters here to get the woman again and
incidentally to kill off a few of the Sacra
mento Chinamen should they show fight.
The new-comers have Headquarters di
rectly across the street from those of the
so-called society to which the groom be
longs, and to-night tbey sallied forth in
force. The local contingent was not ready
for a battle and got inside in baste. The
police are on the lookout for any demon
stration that may be made.
WANTED AT PASADENA.
Forger Wilson's Futile Attempt to De
fraud Woodland Men.
WOODLAND, Cal., June 25.â A few
days ago a stranger giving the name of J. j
H. Wilson arrived in Woodland and vis- ;
ited a number of the most prominent j
Knights of Pythias. Among these were
Superior Judge W. H. Grant, a grand of
ficer of the order, District Attorney Hop
kins and Frank Dietz. Wilson claimed to
be a member of the order in good stand
ing. He told a pathetic story of bad luck
and asked for financial aid so that he
would be able to reach his home in Pasa
dena, where, he asserted, he could obtain
employment.
Mr. Dietz telegraphed to the Pasadena
lodge, inquiring about Wilson. As soon ag j
the Pasadena officers learned that Wilson
was in Woodland they telegraphed to
Sheriff Griffin to arrest him, as he was j
wanted on a chargs of forgery. The offi- I
cals made a thorough search of this city
for the forger, but were unable to fini j
him. Wilson evidently became alarmed at j
the delay and concluded to change his !
field of operations.

PORTLAND'S STRAGGLER INSANE.
I Cosgrove, the Whitechapel Fiend, Will He
Sent to an Asylum.
PORTLAND, Or., June 25.â The authori
ties have come to the conclusion that John
I R. Crosgrove, the woman strangler, is
! crazy enough to relieve him of the respon
! sibilitv of answering to the indictment in
! the criminal court, which charges him >
with assault with intent to kill a White
chapel woman nearly three months ago.
Ccgrove was turned over to the ccanty
court lor examination for insanity this
I afternoon, and he will probably be sent to
! the State Insane Asylum.
The chief witness is not positive of the
I identification of the man. and aside from
that Cosgrove's actions indicate that he is
mentally deluded, and if allowen to run at
large he is m likely to attack a man as a
woman. He, it is firmly believed by the
police, had a hand in the strangling cases
in San Francisco.
Cosgrove was at one time in Vancouver,
[ Wash., and it is believed he was the fiend
who attempted to kill a woman there last
winter. His peculiar mania was the kill
ing of outcast women, thereby ridding the
| world of their presence.

BANK ROBBERS.
Officers Discover a Tunnel
to the First National's
Vaults.
STARTS IN A SALOON.
Excavated Beneath Cellars in
the Heart of the Business
Section.
DUG IN VAIN FOR EICHES.
The Safe-Crackers Frightened Away
After Weeks of Diligent
Labor.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 25.â A re
markbly bold scheme of bank robbers â
one involving weeks of cautious labor in
the heart of this city â has been unearthed
by Los Angeles officers. The police have
discovered a tunnel which had been run
from Commercial street under celiars to
the vaults of the First National Bank,
which were to have been "oracked" by the
robbers at their first opportunity. Had
they been successful, they would have se
cured about $300,000. The bank is one of
largest institutions in this section. '
Some time ago Chief of Police Glass
learned that an attempt was likely to be
made on a local bank, but as nothing was
done the rumor was forgotten after a time.
The Chief went to Atlanta, Ga., in May,
and then, it is supposed, the gang began
operations. Detectives had been cautioned
to be on the watch during the Chief's ab
sence, and shortly after his departure they
learned that "Billy" Matthaney, Gillespie
and Rier^on, a gang of clever safe-crackers,
were in the city.
The first clew to their plans was found
when Detectives Aubie and Hawley
searched Matthaney's rooms. In a satchel
they found a suit of dirty, stained clothes,
which led the officers to believe that the
gang was trying to dig into some bank.
The point at which they were at work
could not be found, however, so after
vainly following the trio for several day?
the officers arrested them and ordered
them out of town.
Early in the present month Chief Glass
learned that an attempt had been made to
rob the First National Bank. The steel
vault rests on a brick arch built up from
the cellar. The arch consists of four
layers of brick, then cement, and on top
of this two gridiron layers of steel rails
separated by cement; cement upon the
top rail, then steel axles, more cement,
and then tbe four-inch steel floor of the
vault.
Several layers of the brick had been re
moved, while in the cement floor was a
hole hidden by some old bricks. The of
ficers could not get into this tunnel, as
the way was blocked by a big jackscrew.
Farther investigation proved that the
other end of this tunnel was in tbe neigh
borhood of the Anaheim Brewery saloon,
at 112 Commercial street, just around the
corner from the First National Bank,
which is at 226 North Main street.
On the 17th Detectives Auble and Brad
ish broke into the cellar of the saloon and
there found the other Â«nd of the tunnel.
The place had been run by a man named
P. L. Jones. The bar was partitioned off
into winerooms, and the entrance to the
cellar boarded up and floored over, a trap
door being cleverly concealed in the floor.
Tn his cellar, which is 35 by 45 feet in
dimensions, the work has been protecuted
with a care that was fully worthy of tne
magnitude of the project. It was exactly
102 feet from the cellar to tbe point under
the vault, and the robbers bad figured out
with such mathematical exactness, that
the tunnel is almost in a direct line. It is
about two and a half feet square, just
large enough to accommodate a man
working on all fours.
Picks, shovels, crowbars and other tools
were used to dig with. Tbe dirt was packed
in a piece of carpet and hauled out of the
cellar with a windlass. A small bell was
the signal. As the air was foul in the tun
nel a piece of rubber hose was stretched
and fresh air was supplied by a. bellows at
the cellar end. The drift was carefully
timbered.
The officers watched both entrances
carefully for several days, but at last
learned that the gang had flown, so the
place was thoroughly searched. The tools
were found inside the drift, carefully bid
den by earth and sacks. In the cellar was
a tub of water and in this were thirty-one
sticks of dynamite and a cigar-box half
full of giant powder, all wrapped in oiled
paper. Some of the dirt from the excava
tion had been piled in the cellar.
James K. Stephens was arrested on
Tuesday and charged with being impli
cated in the attempted burglary. His was
the only capture made, as the balance of
the gang decamped, frightened away by
gome unknown cause.
Tbe police are reticent regarding Steph
ens. It is believed that Matthaney's gang
is at the bottom of the job. Its members
are expert safe crackers and no doubt
agreed with the less experienced men to
blow up the vault if the others would do
the tunneling. Jones, the saloon man,
disappeared two weeks ago, and has not
been beard from since. The police are
anxious to get him.
RETURNS TO LOS ANGELES.
Sheriff Burr find* 1 hat Be Ha* Been
Chatting a Bogu* .IHtnhittn.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 25.â An in
nocent and unoffending prospector, by
name Tom Connell, is the Erstine Creek
"Dunham," who was seen by Pinney and
Richards, Sheriff Burr and a formidable
posse, heavily armed, after having made a
trip of many miles on horseback from
Caliente Station to the Mojave desert, re
turned to-day. They left Caliente on Sun
day with a guide and reached the Bright
Star mine camp, near Kernville, on Mon
day afternoon. Inquiry revealed the fact
that no stranger had been seen in that
section for many a day.
Here Sheriff Burr learned that the man
whom Pinney had seen at Erskine Creek
was Tom Connell, a prospector, who bad
beer. In camp for the past six months. He
was informed Inter on that a miner named
Stanley, who had a cabin about six miles
further on, had seen a stranger a. few days
a<*o while out prospecting. Burr was soon
at Stanley's cabin, but the owner was
away. He awaited Stanley's return.
Stanley informed him that while pros
pecting in a canyon a day or two ago he
beard a noise in the brush about seventy
five yards from where he was standing.
He crawled up and saw a man tearing
through the brush, closely pursued by two
wild steers. That was all. *

SCORED AT VETERANS.
Denunciation of a Pastor Who Would
Xot Drape UU Church With flans.
LOS ANGELES," Cal., June 25.â Stanton
Post, Grand Army of the Republic, and tbe
Women's Relief Corps, paid their respects
to Rev. Mr. Jfinley of the M. E. Church
South in the following terms at a meeting
here last night:
The members of the post and corps declare
that there is no spot s<o sacred but it may be
honored and glorified by the presence of that
illustrious banner, more dear to us than life
itself; that no day is too holy to bring to grate
ful remembrance the struggles and sacrifices
of our forefathers for liberty and independ
ence; that that church or denomination that
re: uses to Inculcate lessons of patriotism tiiid
veneration for our National emblem is derelict
in its duty; thai any so-called minister of the
gospel who so far forgets his obligations to
patriotism, and who so outrages every senti
ment of loyalty and memory of our patriotic
dead as to deliberately insult the flag of his
country, is in no sense a true follower of the
Lord Jesus Christ, and is unworthy the protec
tion of the stars and stripes and the blessing
of liberty and peace whicn they guarantee.
Fin ley had refused to drape his church
in National colors or preach a patriotic
sermon, as requested, next Sunday.

BAR ON SUM ARY CLOSING.
Angelenom Protest Against the Petition of
Reformers,
LOS ANGELES, Cal., June 25.â The
coutest over the proposition before the
Common Council of this city for Sunday
closing of all business places promises to
be a warm one. Two monster protests,
containing about 2500 names, have been
addressed to the Council in opposition to
the petition and movement for a Sunday
closing ordinance. The prutestants base
their opposition on the ground that such
an ordinance would be unconstitutional,
for the reason that "it would deprive a
certain class of an inherent right to six
days of labor and one of rest. Second â
Because it would destroy the equality of
all men before the law. Third â Because it
would be religious legislation. Fourthâ
Because it would be discriminating in its
nature. Fifth â Because the constitution
of the United States guarantees one day
of rest out of a week to all who care to
assert that right without designating what
day of the wee* it shall be."
STOCKTON ASYLUM SHORTAGE.
Complaint Filed at Sacramento Against
the Several Bondsmen of Ex-
Treasurer Orr.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., June 25.â Deputy
Attorney-General Charles Post filed a
complaint in the Superior Court to-day
on the part of State Controller E. P. Col
gan, H. O. Southworth, A. Thornton, J.
D. McDougal, A. McDonald and Joseph
Steffens, directors of the State Insane
Asylum at Stockton, against N. M. Orr
and H. H. Hewlitt. Frank Stewart, T. W.
Newell, 1. D. BostwicK, R. B. Parker and
George West, who were the bondsmen of
N. M. Orr when he received the appoint
ment of treasurer of the State Insane
Asylum in Stockton.
The complaint, which is very lengthy,
after detailing the conditions under which
Orr accepted the office, states that he has
failed to account for about $10,000 of the
funds of the institution, although he has
been repeatedly requested to do so. On
April 24 E. P. Colgan had a demand
served on Orr for the sum of $10,000, to be
returned within twenty days. Orr had
failed to produce the money, and in con
sequence Colgan added to the gross
amount 25 per cent damages. By so
doing there became due to the State and
payable from these bondsmen the sum of
$12,501 08, no part of which has been paid.
Then follows a copy of the bond, signed
by all the defendants, approved by the
board of directors.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1896.
FATHER FERGUSON
ON "FALLACIES,"
The Eloquent Priest Ad
dresses an Immense
Gathering.
DEFENDS THE CHURCH.
What Emperor Frfderick Said
to Philosopher Benjamin
Franklin.
DEFINES â¢â¢STALL-FED" CATHOLIC
Declares the Catholic Church to Be
in the Vanguard of Thought
and Progress.
Father Ferguson lectured at Metropoli
tan Temple last evening under the aus
pices of the Young Men's Cathoiic Union,
on the subject of "Exploded Fallacies."
The lecturer was in his best voice and was
frequently interrupted in his discourse by
the applause 6f his large and sympathetic
audience.
Prior to the lecture there was an interest
ing prelude of a musical and literary
character. The performers were all
encored. As Father Ferguson arose and
was introduced by the chairman the au
dience burst into prolonged applause.
"I intend to lay before you this even
ing," he began, "the proof of certain fal
lacies regarding the Roman Catholic
church. These proofs are so cogent and
convincing that even the beam in the
most skeptical eye cannot obscure them.
"One of these fallacies is that the Catho
lic church is an enemy of human free
dom. Why, in the broad light of history,
any being can so hold is more than I can
tell you. It is one of those things that is a
marvel unto the philosophical mind.
"Until a very late period such was the
bitterness against those of our faith that
they were not permitted to enter any of
the learned professions. Men of honest
minds, who did not realize that this state
of affairs was dne wholly to bigotry, came
to the conclusion that the Catholic church
is an enemy to freedom and all prosress.
"Then look at the prejudices tiiat have
flooded Protestant homes in the form of
partisan literature. This is one reason
why the Protestant world, not so very
long ago, beiieved us to be followers of a
crude, if not corrupt, religion.
''But of late years there has come an im
portant change. The diffusion of Catholic
literature, the writings of unprejudiced
Protestants, and even of liberalists and in
fiSels, have done much to do away with
such a flagrant error.
"Let me tell you right here, that the
wisdom of hunting down these disreputa
ble i ales is manifest. As Macaulay says,
we cannot consider it strange that Protest
tants believe even tbe most strange and {
outlandish tales about us when we let
them pass unrefuted.
"This is something for you Catholics
who may be termed 'stall-fed' to consider."
After the laugh that erected this sally
had subsided Father Ferguson continued
his discourse in elucidation of the term
"stall-fed."
"A 'stall-fed' Catholic," he declared,
while the faces of his audience showed
that they anticipated something witty,
"differs from the 'jelly-fish' Catholic in
this: The 'jelly-fish' Catholic, while he)
will not answer, will let it go at that, j
while the 'stall-fed' Catholic will neither
answer himself nor will he lat others
answer. They call this 'dienified silence,'
but it ouuht rather to be called 'dignified
cowardice.' " %
Pausing for the applause and laughter
to subside, the lecturer drew a deep
breath and then launched forth asain, his
manner becoming more impassioned as he
warmed to his subject.
"They tell us that the Catholic Church
is an enemy to civil and religious
liberty, that her head has been
whitened by the snows of the
ages while her countenance has been
kept hooded and away from tbe sunlight
of toleration and beneficence, that like
some hideous animal from the shades of
the underworld she lies in wait with her
talons ready and itching to pounce upon
and rend him who would sinK broader and
deeper in the rock of human liberty the
foundations of the social fabric.
"How any man can pretend to believe
this and then hold up his nead before his I
fellow-nien and assert that he has ever
glanced inside the pages of history is a
mystery so profound and marvelous that â 
in grappling with it the brain reels and
the senses become utterly confused. I
now and forever will maintain that if it
were not for the Catholic church the pres
ent liberty of the United States could not
be maintained.
"What have the enemy to say of the
valor of our chivalrous sons who, in the
tremendous charge between the cross and
the crescent, bathed the soil oi Europe
crimson with their lifeblood in preventing
it from being overrun by the Moslem
hordes? Nothing whatever. 1 heir silence
is as deep and unbroken as the grave.
Listen to what the Protestant historian,
Lecky, has to say:
No human pen can write its epitaph, for no
human imagination can adequately realize its
glory. In the eyes of those who estimate the
greatness of sovereignty, not by the extent of
its territory nor by the number of its soldiers,
but the influence it has exercised over man
kind, the Papal Government has no rival and
can never have a successor.
Father Ferguson then mentioned more
instances in which the archives of history
demonstrate the obligations of the world
to tbe mother church, and then took a
new tack.
"Who was it," he demanded, "that es
tablished the present system of trial by
jury, with the good that it has brought to
us? Wno was it that founded all those
cardinal laws that have insured peace and
prosperity to nations and peoples as long
as they obeyed them in spirit and in
letter? Who but the Roman Catholic
church, which is and j ' ays has been the
tender mother of civil and religious lib
erty and of individual right. .
"The Protestants cannot claim the honor
for these institutions. Why? Because
they existed long before that form of re
ligion ever came into the world with its
attendant string of evils. That is why.
Isn't it enough?"
"Now" continued Father Ferguson,
"Magna Charta is commonly supposed to
be tne document that forms the basis of
all modern governmental liberty. To
whom was its origin due? Let me tell
you âit was owing to tne stren
uous endeavors of that grand and
noble man whose memory shall for
ever linger with us as an odor
fresh from the balmy groves of the Gar
den of Eden, Stephen Langton, Arch
biihop of Canterbury. On his memory
Sunset Cox, late envoy to Persia, pro
nounced a eulogy so fitting that I am
going to read it to you tonight. I am
going to let you know something of this
man to whom the civilized world is so
greatly indebted. 1 '
Here tbe lecturer read a rather long arti
cle by the author mentioned, showing the
estimation in which he personally neld
the Archbishop of Canterbury and what
homage his memory deserved from
all enlightened nations. The reverend
father ended with a plea that his
hearers would not forget that the
man of whom tbls tribute had been
written wad a Kotnan Catholic.' He was
once interrupted by deafening applause
while reading the article at a paragraph
erapasizing the fact that Magna Charta is
the direct, predecessor of the American
Revolution and the Declaration of Inde
pendence.
"Now," he continued, "I am not eager
to draw the deadly parallel in matters re
ligious, but it might be apropos under the
circumstances to ask what those on the
Lutheran side of the fence have to say for
themselves during the years that have
elapsed since the Reformation."
The manner in which Father Ferguson
asked the question was so inimitable and
the slight, sarcastic emphasis he threw
upon the word "reformation" so fetching
that the audience was instantly convulsed
with laughter.
"What have they performed ? I ask.
Has not the Enclish Parliament passed so
many bad laws that the fair pages of
history have been sullied by numerous
'redresses of grievances.'
"If Catholics are such enemies of liberty
why did they stand in and assist this re
public in the days of its infancy, when it
was hardly able to stand upon its feet?
"How about the Protestants during
those stirring times? Did they assist the
Americans? To be sure they did"â this
ironically.
"All those Hessians that were shipped
over to keep us under the iron hand of the
tyrant were Catholics, weren't they?"
Father Fereuson's tentative tone, and the
comic expression of his features when he
made this query, again brought down the
house.
"I defy any man to show me," he thun
dered, "that any Catholics were ever
shipped over to help subdue this country.
No, they are too liberty-loving a people
for that". There were enough Catholics in
Washington's army alone to disprove any
such assertion.
"What nations were they that gave us
recognition in those times? Compare the
reception of Franklin at the court of
France and of Prussia. At the former he
was welcomed. At the latter Frederick
told that eminent philosopher, who
snatched the lightning from the skies and
the scepter from the hands of tyrants, that
he was born to rule, and did rule, and
didn't intend to lend any assistance that
would harm the trade.
"Then how about the republics of Genoa
and the surrounding territory, as well as
the cantons of Switzerland, who owed
their existence to the favor of the Popes?
Instead of fostering them they might have
taken away their liberty had they so de
] sired.
"What was the results produced upon
I the Governments of Europe by the refor
mation? For fully 250 years absolutism
reigned, and it was not until the year 1848
that the tyranny of thÂ« ruler of Prussia
was hedged about with restrictions. It is
| about the same with Sweden and Den
mark."
Hereupon the lecturer paused to quote
from historical authority to prove that the
condition of the people of many of the
districts of these countries is, in many re
spects, as crude as it was hundreds of
years ago.
"As the great Cardinal Newman said,"
he continued after reading certain ex
cerpts, ""There's not a tongue that wags
against the Catholic church to-dsy that
doesn't owe it to her that it can wag at
all.'
"The fabric of freedom in this country
was first reared by Lord Baltimore,
when he came with his faithful band of
followers and worked for the establish
ment of peace, liberty and happiness.
"Jefferson, when he wrote that para
graph in the Declaration of Independence
stating that the attributes of all men are
'life, liberty and pursuit of happiness,'
was foreshadowed by Fenelon, a great
French archbishop, who used nearly the
same words in requesting an English king
to ailow his subjects greater liberty.
"In conclusion, let me say that theCd'th
j olic church will ever be fouad in the van
' guard of progress, holding aloft tha torch
light of liberty and reason, that the
na'.ions may see their way clear to higher
planes of thought and existence."
The gathering was dismissed with the
announcement that a grand patriotic dem
onstration would be held under the aus
pices of the Young Men's Catholic Union
in Metropolitan Temple on the evening of
July 3, at which all were invited to be
present. _________^__
VILLARD HIMSELF AGAIN,
The Old-Time Railroad King in
a New Transcontinental
Scheme.
Unlimited Backing From Europe and
tbe Rockefeller Interests in
This Country.
CHICAGO, 111., June 25.â The name of
Henry Villard of Northern Pacific fame
was associated to-day in railroad circles
with a story of a new transcontinental
railroad scheme, embracing the Baltimore
and Ohio, Chicago and Northern Pacific
Company's terminal property in this city,
the Chicago Great Western Road from
this city to St. Paul and the Northern
Pacific system from that city to the Pacific
Coast. It is said that Mr. Villard has re
gained the confidence of his former finan
cial backers in Europe to the extent of
having enough money, with the help of
the Rockefeller interests on this side, to
accomplish the gigantic scheme he is
credited with cherishing. The reported
plan is to buy in the Northern Pacific
property when it is offered at foreclosure
sale next month, and the Adams reorgani
zation committee is said to be cognizant
and friendly to the project.
Then the Chicago and Northern Pacific
Terminal s-ystem, which was built during
the Villard regime, is the next connecting
link which is to be added to the alleged
transcontinental chain of the property now
in the receiver's hands, if put up at fore
closure sale next October. If it develops,
as reported, that the Vanderbilts are after
that property for a Michigan Central
terminal the bidding will run far ahead of
the court's upset price of $10,000,000.
The Baltimore and Ohio, whicn is to be

A Burglar Enters Bin Residence and
Make* a Haul.
CLEVELAND, Ohio. June 26.â Hon.
Mark Hanna's Lake wood villa was . en

worth of jewels and $70 in money.
He did not arouse the occupants of the

Mr. Hanna's private watchman. The
Lakewood Marshal was notified â¢ and he
with his two assistants chased the burglar
to tee lake front, where he eluded them,
escaping safely with his plunder.

John P. Irish is one of the gold Dem

Naval Officer John P. Irish, the Leading Democratic Champion of Gold or
"Sound Money" on the Pacific Coast.
ney of New York, whose recent letter,
written in an effort to in some measure
stem the silver tide in the party, practically
acknowledged the defeat of the gold
forces, pleads for a compromise and re
ports that the march of the "other na

the ear on the ground.
In the following statement of his views
Mr. Irish, with customary force, declares
for "no quarter," deprecates persuasion |
of silverites an<l asks that in this party
emergency the two-thirds rule be made
what it was intended to be, "the last
refuge of principle":
I have carefully read Mr. Whitney's letter,
and disagree with him.
The extreme silver men have a majority, and |
we have more than one-third of the conven- I
tion. Why persuade them to conservative ac
tion such as resting on an international agree
ment? Such an agreement is impossible, or"
6o remote as to lose paral.Â«tx. Mr. Whitney

international agreement they will be dis&p
apointed, and we will have an acute renewal
of tbe present dangerous agitation.
In my judgment the sound money men at
Chicago, being more than a third of the con
vention, should stand together and vote sol
idly for a sound money candidate â Russell,
Carlisle, William L. Wilson, Secretary Morton,
anybody who stands for the old Democratic
faith. No party authority capable of deliver
ing a National canon has ever yet declared
that the free, unlimited, independent coinage
of 6ilver at a ratio of 16 to 1 is a Democratic
principle. We are under no obligations to
accept that novelty at the dictation of recent
Republicans like Boies or anarchists like Alt
geld. Let lhem find ways and means to nomi
nate their candidate. The two-thirds rule in
Democratic conventions was intended to be
the last refuge of principle. Let it be used to
that end in this emergency.
What is the situation? We measurably re
deemed the party's pledge of tariff reform.
The silver men by violent agitation have so
alarmed the country and the world as to con
gest and stagnate business enterprise and in
dustry, with the result of deficient revenues,
not due to the tariff per se, but fo industrial
paralysis caused by the fear of a silver stand
ard. The silver men therefore have played
into the hands of the Republicans by enabling
them to revive protection and reseat it in the
law. Original silver propogandists in the
Democratic party were protectionists, like
General Warner of Ohio, who is now out with
a declaration in favor of 16 to 1 and "inci
dental" protection. The party owes to such
men the coming overthrow of every result of
thirty years' education oi the people on the
tariff.
They are going into this battle repudiating
the whole record of the party since 1861, and re
jecting the only successful leader we have had
since the Civil War. I see no good in attempt
ing to reason them out of it. They prefer Till
| man to Cleveland. Let them test the coun
try's judgment on that preference.

LONDON, Eng., June 25.â The Yale
eight were out again this afternoon and
rowed over half the course in 3:32% at a

more beating than anybody expected.
The Trinity Hall crew were out on tbe

Freedom of speech among Democrats

out of the race, but Cleveland still hesi
tates to decline.
There is no question but what New Jer
sey will stand with Hobart. We can count
her in the Union.
Even New York Democrats have been
reading "Coin's Financial School" instead
of Wall-street bulletins.
With the average Democrat any hole in

the people who demand work and wages.
The existing money of the country is
good enough for the people. What they
ask for is a chance to work and earn some
of it. _

Cleveland may issue another set of bonds

ratify it. '
Corbett may maintain his claim to the

Since the gold Democrats in New York

Day by day the gold reserve goes down

By the time the municipal campaign

Cleveland may take up the Cuban issue,
but it is by no means certain that he is a

LOCAL PATRIOTISM.
In his address at the great ratification
meeting at his home to Paterson, on Mon
day evening, Mr. Hobart turned aside for
a time from National politics to impress
upon his feJlow-citisens the importance of
civic patriotism. "1 invoke you. Republi
cans and Democrats alike," he said, "to
do even more than you have done, to
manifest more civic pride, more public
spirit. * * * We want to make a city
of comfortable homes for working people,
and have ample facilities for them to
earn enough to own and enjoy their
homes. It is to the advancement of this
idea that I have devoted my time, my
energy and my work to the best of my
ability in order that I might more fully
show my regard and affection for those
around me â thoso with whom I am in
friendly contact every day of my life."
At first thought it may seem strange
that tnis plea for local patriotism should
have been uttered by a great statesman
â who had just been nominated for the high
office of Vice-President of the United
States. One would naturally expect that
on his first address to bis fellow-citizens
after his nomination he would have spoken
to them of great National issues, to the
total exclusion of the little affairs of local
development. It is a significant evidence
of his deep and abiding civic patriotism
that he should have felt it and spoken of
it at that time, and we can easily learn
from it one of the reasons why he is so
esteemed, honored and loved by his neigh
bors and fellow-citizens.
As a matter of fact, nothing could have
been more appropriate to the occasion and
to the issues of the time than that address.
The Republic is but an aggregation of
communities. Protection to the indus
tries of the Nation means, of course, pro
tection to the industries of each locality.
On civic patriotism the truest national
patriotism is based. He serves his country
with honor -who serves his city with zeal.
It is the men who advance the welfare of
their ugighbors that can be most con
fidently trusted to advance the welfare of
the â whole people. The home industry
merges inseparably into the national in
dustry, and a devotion to tbe happiness of
the fireside leads to a devotion to the pros
perity and glory of the Republic.
From the brief extracts of his speech
that have come to us, it is clear that Mr.
Hobart is one of the men whom the
American people delight to honor and
whom the Republican party is proud to
raise to office. We need more men of his
kind in tne country. We need them par
ticularly in California. We need men who
put forth their money, their energy and
their time to the building up of industries
in order that their cities may "have com
fortable homes for workingmen, with
ample facilities for them to earn enough to
own and enjoy their homes." That is the
Republican principle of protection reduced
to practice. It is to enable such men to
accomplish such work that the Republican
party exists and battles for the cause of
American industry against tha world.
There will be no condemnation of Mr.
Hobart for his local patriotism. "When he
spoke for bis home he spoke for every
community In the land. He sets an ex
ample which every man of capital and
capabilities should follow. All who stand
for American industries at all must stand
for their home industries. Civic patriotism
is no mean virtue and well deserves recog
nition, even among the great things in
volved in the National politics of Presi
dential years.
STAND BY THE RAILWAY.
The San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway has a total mileage of less
than 100 miles, and just at this time it
should not be expected to exert much in
fluence upon freight rates and passenger
fares in a very extended territory. It
should be remembered that it is a new en
terprise and that it is only the oepinning
of what will crow into an extensive sys
tem of rail transportation lines. It is true,
also, that the mileage that is now open to
traffic was constructed rather faster than
railways generally are and that the work
of extending the line i? being pushed with
the utmost vigor. This certainly indicates
that it is the purpose of the projectors to
create competing lines in various sections
of the State, with San Francisco as the
focus of them all, and that in the not very
far distant future the Southern Pacific
will be confronted by a rival that is fully
equal to maintain its position, ereat and
powerful as the Southern Pacific is.
There never was a public enterprise in
California that promised so much good to
the people. No doubt the growth of the
interior of the State has been greatly re
tarded by the arbitrary and selfish man
agement of tbe Southern Pacific, and there
is no donbt also that there is no other way
to release the State from the iron grasp of
the Southern Pacific monopoly than the
construction of parallel lines. This the Val
ley Railway Company has undertaken to
do, and the good faith of its purpose is dem
onstrated by the large investment of capi
tal which the Valley road represents, and
in a very considerable reduction of traffic
tariffs the moment the first mileage of the
proposed system was ready to be operated.
Another proof of the earnestness of the
projection is found in the stability of the
roadway and structures of the first mile
age. It presents in no sense earmarks of
a speculative enterprise, but a solid and
permanent business undertaking on sound
business principles.
The plan includes, as we have said, a
large system of lines radiating from San
Franci'co and tbe trunk road. But while
the work of construction is in the hands
of capitalists who are thoroughly and sin
cerely seeking profitable employment for
their money, a duty of moment devolves
upon those whose interests would be bene
fited by additional rail facilities for reach
ing the markets of the country. We refer
to rights of way. There are those to whom
it sometimes occurs that a road must be
extended, else the enterprise would be
left half finished and unprofitable, and
that they will exact prices for the right of
way that would be equal to the value of
all their land holding were no railway
contemplated. Such men are a detriment
to any country; besides, they are misera
bly short-sighted, else they could see that
the introduction of ample public trans
portation lines would largely increase the
value of their property. If tbe people
want to be released from the yoke of the
Southern Pacific monopoly they should
give aid and comfort to the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley Railway enter
prise. â 
GARRET AUGUSTUS HOBART.
The St. Louis convention made no mis
take when it nominated Garret A. Hobart
for Vice-President. He is a man of wide
business experience and possesses rare
executive ability. He is in no sense a
politician, but he is just such a man of
affairs as is needed to preside ovor the
Senate. His life has been spent in chan
nels of commerce and he is thoroughly
acquainted with the needs of the Nation's
trade and traffic. His knowledge of tbe
science of economics comes of participa
tion in practical business operations, and
of the experience which years of personal
conduct of large enterprises give. And the

highest recommendation for tne position
to which he will be elected and his entire
fitness to aid ;n the work of rebuilding the
industries that have been wrecked in the
last three years cornea from his neighbors,
Republicans and Democrats, who are
familiar with his achievements in the
world of finance, manufacture and mer
chandise.
Undoubtedly Senators will be glad to
have the benefit of Mr. Hobart's larger
business experience in preparing and con
sidering measures for the advancement of
the trade, domestic and foreign, of the
country, and it is very certain that his
opinions will have in mind the ereatest
possible good for all the people. Then,
again, his knowledge of practical politics
and the tricks of the trade of politics
beinjr. no dim will cause him to regard all
legislation as business propositions for the
weal or woe of the people. This will b&ve
a tendency to make Senators forego
schemes which are for advantage to the
party rather than to the country. Mr.
Hobart will be quick to detect the purpose
of bills, and the country may be sure that
there will be no legislation, if the Vice-
President can help it, whose operation
would discriminate against one class of
citizens for the benefit of another class.
EASTERN DEMOCRATIC SCHEME.
The platform adopted by the New York
Democracy ; .s the some one that has been
in use by the party for several years. It
looks well and reads well, but wr.en one
digs down and gets at its true meaning he
rinds the same old basic principles of per
fidy, hypocrisy and falsehood. The usual
"pointing with pride" to the record of the
party was performed, and the leaders in
dulged in the time-worn habit of self
glorification. The convention was har
monious â unusually so for a New York
Democratic gathering â but then the occa
sion was not offering opportunities for the
Tiger to break into the arena. It was a
consultation to find out how best the life
of the party could be savedâ a party that
is too sinful to die and not good enough
to live. Even the unterrined Tammany
ward bosses felt the solemnity of the oc
casion and kept comparatively quiet.
It is no surprise that the convention
blamed the Republican party for the fail
ure of the Wilson-Gorman tariff act to
provide revenue enough to maintain the
Government. Had occasion required there
would have been no hesitation in declar
ing that the Republican party is responsi
ble for tbÂ« fall of Adam and all the sin in
the world. It is a cold day when the
Democracy of New York faiis to put the
consequences of its rascality and duplicity
upon tlie shoulders of some oilier party.
Bui the declaration that Democratic rule
is necessary to the well-beinir of the coun
try must have made every delegate smile
at his own capacity for lying. The last
time the country was under complete
Democratic rule prior to 1893 was between
1857 and 1861, and which culminated in
one of the most destructive civil war 3 the
world ever saw. The next advent of the
Democracy in public as the controlling in
fluence in the affairs of the nation was in
1893, and which immediately plunped the
country into commercial and financinl dis
asters of such force and character that the
nation was driven to the very edge of
country-wide bankruptcy.
History does not substantiate the claim
of the Democracy that it is necessary to
the well-being of the peop'e. "If I can
throw the patient into fits," said a quack
doctor, "he will be all right, for I am a
fits sDecialist." The Democratic party
has thrown the country into fits, which
the peop'e know very well, for they are
still squirming under the influence of the
dose, but they will not risk the old pol't
ieal quack's "cure all." The hair of the
dog is not, in this case, good for the bite;
h? sides, these are political dog day*, and
the Democratic doss are raving mad. The
effort of the New York Democracy to
make Western and Southern Democrats
take its medicine will, therefore, only in
tensify tbe spa?mÂ». Whitney, Hill and
the other New York bosses prescribe a
milk and water, meaningless but thor
oughly hypocritical dose called "straddle'
for the National party, and intimate that
if it takes of it freely all cases of fits will
be cured and the party become so strong
and powerful that victory next November
would be assured, but the West and South
have not lost their wits if they are mad.
It is an insult to the West and Suiith to
ask them to join in a scheme to Cover up
their own views on the money question
with deceit so as to appear that they are in
harmony with exactly what they arc bat
tlingagaiust merely to please Whitney, Hill
and other attorneys of Wall-street syndi
cates and trust combinations. The West
and Bouth will not be caught by any such
chaff as the New York convention's kind
of bimetallism. The declaration is
adroitly drawn, and it is intended to per
suade the Chicago convention that it is
best to make a straddle pu tie silver ques
tion: fcut no doubt tbe silver delegates
will be able to see that what the Cleve
land wing is after is an all thin&s to all
men kind of a platform, hoping that such
a veneered declaration of principles will
give the victory in November to it, when
it would fasten the goid standard upon
the country for all time. Whitney, Hill
and company should have held their con
vention in'the Morgan-Rothschilds syndi
cate's parlors on Wall street. They can
not deceive Western and Southern silver
Democrats by rushing off to an interior
rural village so as to make it appear that
they are not the authorized agents of the
gold monometallism of this country and
Europe. The bait on the hook is more re
pulsive tdan the hook itself. In refusing
to name Presidential electors the conven
tion made a stupid blunder. It was in
tended as a threatâ the threat of a would
be bully. __________________
A GOOD MAN GONE.
Lyman Trumbull was o*ne of America's
great men, a lawyer having deep and
profound knowledge of the philosophy
and ethics of law, and a statesman of
broad and comprehensive understanding
of the science of government. As a poli
tician he was a failure, although he served
eighteen years in the United States Sen
ate. Originally a Democrat, he was one
of the founders of the Republican party,
but he drew such a broad line between
practical politics and; economic politics
that he could not make them lap one over
the other, hence he failed utterly as a poli
tician, as such a man naturally would.
The trouble with Trumbull was that he
expected too much of humanity. His
ideals were too lofty and 1 too honest of
purpose for his day and generation. Be
ing a great lawyer himself he bad no
patience with law-makers who failed to
comprehend the spirit of our Government
in ; framing legislation, although they
might be entirely honest and sincere of
purpose. In I recent years Mr. Trumbull
called himself an independent Democrat
and voted at every election because he
deemed it the duty of every sovereign to
give expression in that to his best Judg
ment concerning how the public's interests
could be further promoted. He had very
little use for a man who would neglect his
duty at the polls. That he died a disap
pointed man there is no doubt. He wanted
to be at the bead of the Government be*
cause* as he believed, the constitution was
too often disregarded. The man's ambi
tion seemed to be to see profound respect
for our institutions everywhere; laws en
acted for the advancement of the people,
and the right of suffrage exercised because
it was the highest duty imposed upon the
citizen. Judge Trumbull was a type of
nobility of character and American man
hood which the youth of this country
mipht study with much profit to them
selves. ______ ______

POKY SAN FRANCISCO.
Santa Cinra Journal.
San Francisco in darkness will tend to im
press the newcomer and traveler in a very un
favorable light. When a great city has to re
sort to such methods of economy tbe financial
accounts of the municipality must indeed be
in sore straits. Even bankruptcy would seem
preferable. It is useless to advertise the won
derful advantages the City presents for horae
stckers and its spirit of prosperity, and claim
everything up to date, while such conditions
| # prevail. This adverse advertisement will
navel fast arid in a short time do harm
which it will take years to undo. Like a bad
reputation, it is hard to overcome. It will be
a great treat for thugs and thieves.
How a city like Ban Francisco can afford to
economize at such a cost is beyond the under
standing of the ordinary mortal.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A man stepped up to the Baldwin desk the
other night with a gold brick in a satchel and
a broad smile on bis lace. He kept a good
hold on his grip and maintained his facial ex
pression while ho wrote in the register,
"George Campb?ll, Gras* Valley."
"Ah! a mining man from Grass Valley?"
queried the chief clerk as he put his pen be
hind his ear and prepared to extend the glad
hand. "Mr. Campbell, let the porter take
your valise."
"Not on your life. Wait till I show yon
what's in it." And he hoisted it up and
dropped it on the counter with a thud that
splashed half the contents of the inkwell over
into the toothpick-stand.
The hair on the olerk's head slowly rose in
George Campbell, Who Came Down From Grass Valley With a Gold Brick and
Took in the Fight.
pompadour array, as he gazed, not upon the
two collars and some other things, but upon a
genuine mass of the real yellow metal.
And then he carried the brick fondly to the
safe and placed it therein, with the gentleness
of a mother putting her first born to rest, and
as he closed the heavy iron-door he murmured
softly, "A gold standard would be plenty good
enough for me."
Mr. Campbell had come down to see the
prizeflnht, and, he had arrived in town a little
too late to deposit his bullion in one of the
banks as is his custom when bringing his
purchases to the City to exchange them for
coin.
He is proud of Grass Valley, for it ia the place
of his birtn, and it bears the added distinction
of being one of the most attractive mining
towns in California.
"There are five bi? mines at Grass Valley,"
said he. as he puffed the smoke from a good
cigar and followed it with his eyes as it rose
and assumed fantastic shapes, "and about 800
men are employed in them.
"Just now E. W. Hopicius is opening up the
Old Gold Hill mine that used to turn out
bucketfuls of ore along about 1860. Then,
down on the Allison ranch they are soon going
to start work on a very rich vein. Flood and
others are interested in that new mine.
"Several Frenchmen have invested in Grass
Valley recen tly, but not to any great extent.
One was 8n editor of a Paris paper, but I do
not recall his name. Malevilie, a Frenchman,
came down on the train with me to see about
a French syndicate that is said to have been
formed, tt is supposjd. for the purpose of iu
vesting money in Grass- Valley mines. The
first I heard of tt was about six weeks ago and
now I understand the agents are expected to
arrive here very soon from France.
"The annual output of gold from the Grass
Valley mines is probably $80i),000, or an aver
age of $100 for each man, woman and child in
the place.
"Up our way Grove Johnson is the most pop
ular man for Congress, but I think they're

"I'm in for the Republican platform and I

country any good.

Edward N. Tailer of New York and W. B.
Keriott of Chicago returned to the Palace yes
terday from the Yosemite. They were on the
stage when it was held up last week on the
way into the valley.
Mr. Tailer is elated over the experience and
the prospects of entertaining his friends on
his return to New York with harrowing de
tails of the dangers of travel In the mountains
of California. It cost him but $6, and would
have cost him only $2 but for the shrewdness
of the highwayman, who instinctively sized
him up for an Alderman and, looking at him
over the barrels of a full-cocked shotgun, de
manded more coin. But Mr. Tailer said noth
ing of a fat wallet in his hip pocket, nor did
he think it wise to make a move in that direc
tion and take chances of having his purpose
mihinterpreted.
Mr. Kerfott, being a resident of Chicago,
touk the whole affair as a matter of course,
and threw out some cash so dexterously that
a 50-cent piece lodged in the feathers of the
millinery of a woman passenger on the front
seat. It was the first time he had actually
thrown money to the birds and got it back
again. Ho says he thinks the "sack-suit" dis
guise must have been made by a London
tnilor, as it fit on the most accepted English
plan of goods to spare.
According to Mr. Kerfott, the express-box
that was thrown out contained only a way
bill and a love letter, but then he says the rob
ber was a very courteous fellow, gallant, and
probably romantically inclined, for he blushed
when a woman tossed out her purse, and de
clared that he did not wish the ladies to give
up their money.
Francisco Alba of Guatemala and a numer
ous family of little Albas are at the Occidental

upou him a theatrical monopoly, together
with a handsome bonus of $110,000, on condi
tion that he have two good companies a year
to furnish enjoyment for the show-going pub
lic.
Mr. Alba thinks that he can do this and has
willingly taken the proffered money in order
to show his good faith in the enterprise.
Next year Guatemala is to have a great fair
and its opening will be the occasion of a grand
theatrical outburst, calculated for ever after
to spread a contag ion of theater-going among
the gallants and senoritas ol all Guatemala.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
A UNIQUE COLONY.
Where Individuals as Wkll as Property Be
long to the Government.
To the Editor of the San Francisco CallâSin:
In your issue of to-day I notice in Answers to
Correspondents a reference to the "Unique
Colony," in which it is said little is known re
garding it. I can give you the following facts
regarding the unique organization:
The Buenos Amigos Colony was founded in
1853 by a wealthy Peruvian named Don Jose
Rodriguez. It is located about 100 miles in
land from the northern coast ot Peru. The
orignal settlers numbered seventy-five and the
Peruvian Government granted the settlers
absolute sovereignty over the small domain,
allowing them to make such laws for self
government as they should desire.
The colony is founded upon broad socialistic
principles. Not only does all property belong
to the government, but the individual also is
a government chattel. The colony now num
bers something over 1000 population and is
growing gradually. Auy one except a negro
or an Indian can Decome a member by making
application and being elected by "Congress."
A membership fee of Â¥500 in American coin is
charged. This fee is charged because a person
who has accumulated that much money is sup
posed to be steady and industrious, and they
will tolerate no drones. About two-thirds of
the members are Peruvians, Chileans and
Brazilians, the remainder being Germans,
Englishmen and a few Americans.
Tnecolony isdividedlnto departments. these
into divisions, and the latter into suctions.
There are four departmentsâ labor, educa
tion, commerce and health â each being pre
sided over by a minister. The four ministers
comprise the tribune, which, collectively, con
trols finances and administers justice.
ThÂ« department of labor is divided into "di
visions" of agriculture, building, stockraisinic
manufacturing, export and import and im
provements; the department oi education is
divided into schools, music and arts; the de
partment of commerce into imports, exports
and distribution, and the department of health
Into housekeeping, hospitals and care of
minors. Each division is presided oter by a
superintendent, and the divisions are com
posed of sections, these being directed by a
Chief.
As the individual is held to be the property
of the government the department of health
takes charge of the^chlld when it ant comes
into the world and cares for it. The mother
and child are both taken in hand, first by the
hospital and then by the nursery. As the child
grows it is turned over to teachers for an edu
cation, and soon until it becomes an adult,
when it does its.share of labor with the others.
Every person over the age of 20 is expected
to devote four hours per day to laboi r un ess
prevented by sickness or physical disability.
Eight hours is considered a day's o ' l '^ l
one-half is considered compulsory. Any able
bodied person who does not average half a
day's work per week is compelled to work out
thl remainder of the week Saturday and
Sunday under a guard armed with a black
snake Wages are paid for this enforced labor
the same a! if it ha*d been performed volunt*
ri The financial system is simple "Labor is
money" is the principle upon which tnerolony
"o?IInl"ed. and so also with their currency,
the being me unit upon whjJJ labor
for all kinds of labor is equivalent
to 30 cents ocr hour in American coin.
Thirty cents is therefor called an â¢â¢hour."
circu?at n X medium consists of check, or
tickets. aDd is divided into six different kinds.
alent to half a cent, the "hour' I to 30 cents, the
â¢â¢month" to $52 So.and the "year tÂ°3H*3?â¢;
These checksare all ol the ""fdseandare
made of pasteboard, one inch wldo , ft . n ?.,J^? r ln ,
length, with the words 'â¢minutes, hour
etc., stamped into it in relief. Each denomin
ation has a different color. Their monetary
table as taught in their schools reads.
Sixty minutes make one hour.
Eight hours one day.
Five day 8 one week". . .
Four and two-fifth weeks make one month. .
Twelve months make one year. .
All produce, such as grain, wool and ores,
is handled by the department of export and
import, and all products of the colony find a
ready sale in the Lima market. Everything
purchased for the settlement, such as the
articles which cannot bo raised or manufac
tured at home, is purchased by this same de
partment. All members of the colony procure
their necessaries from the government ware
house at cost price. Dwellings, barns and all
other buildings are erected and owned by the
government, us well as the â  household furni
ture. All dwellings are furnished exactly
alike by the government, but there is nothing
to prevent people from purchasing additional
furniture, if they wish to do so.
There Is always something to do. If the har
vest ts all in and the planting not ready to be
gin, the people are put to work upon repairs or
improvements. They have magnificent street*
and roads, bridges and turnpikes. Their as*
sembly hall is built entirely of stone and mar
ble, which they have themselves quarried and
dressed. A reservoir built of stone lies upon a
hillside and supplies the settlement with wa
ter, and they are now completing a large canal
from the Cototo River, to provide water for irri
gation. Rains are abundant, however, and the
canal was built to prevent possible loss by
drought.
Their marriage customs are'Tery peculiar.
They have no marriage laws whatever, and no
wedding ceremony. A man and woman may
agree to keep house together, and their agree
ment lasts as long as it is satisfactory to both.
If either one desires to terminate the partner
ship ne (or she) simply packs up his things and
moves out, when each may choose another
companion. The divorce is accomplished by a
single act of the will. Strange to relate, how
ever, separations are very rare. The ease ot
divorce seetn3 to make each party careful to
extend a full measure of courtesy and helpful
ness to the other. Â«
No religious test is required of members of
the colony, and discussion on religion and
politics is prohibited under heavy penalties.
The members, however, are well educated and
fully versed in topics of the day. They use
the Spanish language generally, though onÂ«
may speak any tongue he desires. .
When a member becomes weary of colony
life and desires to return to the outer world,
he makes application to the tribune, which
grants him a permit to leave and exchanges
his labor checks for Peruvian gold coin at the
rate of 30 cents an hour. If he has been a
member of the colony for three years or more
he is a "stock member," and the tribune pay*
him his percentage of the earnings of the
colony during that time. _â  '
The people are happy and contented. They
live an easy life, are exempt from military
duty and taxes, and. thanks to their laws,
which supply and enforce labor, there are no
such things as poverty and want.

The Revenue Cutter Rush
After the Herman and
Webster.
ACCUSED OF POACHING.
Both Vessels Frequently Over
hauled but No Proof of
Guilt Found.
SAILING OF THE ALAMEDA.
Nat Goodwin's Comedy Company Drew
a Big Crowd to Folsom-Street
Wharf.
The otter-hunting schooners Herman
and Edward E. Webster, according to
latest accounts, are having lively times of
it in Bering Sea with the revenue cutter
Rush. They have been chased time and
again and on several occasions they suc
ceeded in getting away, thus saving an
overhauling. When they did heave to in
response to guns fired from the revenue
cutter it was alwas found that the schoon
er's papers were all right and that there .
was nothing contraband aboard.
The revenue officials are keeping a bright
lookout on both schooners and if they are
caught an example will be made of the
owners and crew.
According to reports both the Herman
and Webster have done remarkably well.
They have secured quite a number of otter
skins, but every time they have been over
hauled in forbidden territory there has not
been a skin found on either. The revenue
officials think the skins have been cached
and also assert that the crew of the two
schooners are trading with smuggled
liquor.
Whether any of these charges are true
remains to be seen, but the fact is that the
Rush is constantly on che lookout for
boft- schooners, and a race between the
three is almost always on the tapis. With
a strong fair wind the schooners have a
good chance of holding their own. The bet
ting on the water front is that both vessels
will be seized before the season is out.
A. P. Lorentzen, the agent of the two
schooners, is indignant over the idea of
any one thinking his schooners are poach
ing. He insists that they are out on a
legitimate otter-hunting cruise, and that
no such thing as "liquor" ever entered
into any of the captains' transactions.
That the vessels have been overhauled
and nothing found wrong In either their
manifest or cargo is strong presumption
that there is nothing wrong, but then
otter skins are worth nearly $300 apiece,
and the Rush is constantly on the track of
both schooners.
Quite a number of people were down to
see the Oceanic Steamship Company's
Alameda off for South Sea Island ports
yesterday. She was loaded to her full
carrying capacity and had, for this time
of the year, an unusually large number of
passengers. Among them was Nat Good- j
win and his comedy company. Blanche
Walsh, who was said to have withdrawn,
was among the number, and, with her
mother, was prominent on the forward
deck as the steamer moved away from the
dock. As the Alameda got under way the
tug Vigilant was also brouuht into requisi
tion. She had been chartered by -the
theatrical people and accompanied the
oig steamer to the heads. As the two
steamers passed Fort Point Mr. Goodwin,
in pantomime, made a vain attempt to get
the captain on the Alameda to stop the
ship, and, with one hand on his throat
and the other pointed to the Cliff HousÂ«,
attempted to make the crowd on the tug
understand that he wanted them to take a
farewell drink.
Among those on the Vigilant were Mel
ville Marks and Miss .Gertrude Elliott of
the Columbia Theater, George Lask of the
Tivoli. M. Clarlc of the Frawiey Company,
HugoToland, "Charley" Morel, T. Daniel
Frawiey and others. The Goodwin com
pany will be gone about five months and
during its stay will produce "A Gilded
Fool," "The Prisoner of Zenda" and "In
Mizzoura."
Among the other passengers who sailed
[ on the steamer were Mrs. Charles M.
Shortridge and her daughter, who are
bound for Hawaii on a vacation. Some
years aeo Mrs. Shortridge visited the Par
! adise of the Pacific with her husband and
the trip was such a thoroughly enjoyable
one that she has determined to revisit the
| country. Colonel J. H. Soper and P.
I Soper also sailed for Honolulu and United
States Consul-General W. Churchill and
wife went to Apia, Samoa.
The Harbor Commissioners held a short

SUIT TO FORECLOSE.
The Central Trust Company Seeks to
Gain Control of the Nevada
Railroad.
The Central Trust Company of New
York began suit Wed nesday in the United
States Circuit Court against the California
and Nevada Railroad Company for fore
closure of a mortgage held by them and
the appointment of a receiver. C. K.
King, recently appointed receiver as the
result of the suit of Charles H. Smith to
have certain bonds declared illegal, is also
made a party to the proceedings.
It appears from the complaint that in
1884 the railroad company determined to
borrow $5,000,000 for the purpose of com
pleting the road. An issue of 5000 bonds
of a par value of $1000 each was accord
ingly authorized, the same to be payable
thirty years after date. The trust com
pany agreed to float the bonds, the com
pensation named being $100,000, payable
at the maturity of the bonds, the interest
on the same to be paid annually.
It now seems, however, that the railroad
only issued 545 of the bonds authorized.
To "cover this a mortgage was given the
trust company embracing all the prop
erty owned by the railroad, including the
proposed line from Oakland to Bodie, a
distance of 250 miles. The complaint now
alleges that the defendants in the suit de
faulted in payment of interest in 1885 and
every year thereafter. In consequence of
this the complainants now file a claim of
$376,050 interest due on bonds, and in ad
dition to this prays for a foreclosure of the
mortgage, the appointment of a receiver
and an injunction against the receiver ap
pointed under the Smith suit, riled May 28.
HEALTH MEASURES AFAR,
Congress Asked to Defeat a
Senate Bill Relating to
Vivisection.
Milk Inspector Dockery Wants the
M;lk Permit of P. McDonough
Revoked.
The Board of Health took an important j
step at its meeting Wednesday when it
passed a resolution requesting the Cali
fornia representatives in Congress to op
pose the passage of Senate bill No. 1552,
which is now pending.
This measure prohibits the use of live
animals for experiments and was intro
duced at the instance of the National So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals, which is opposed to vivisection for
any purpose whatever. The resolution
was introduced on a request from the Bu
reau of Agriculture at Washington, which
desires to use live animals while pursuing
its investigations into the causes ot many
diseases of a dangerous character.
The board decided to send the following
communication to the Boards of Health
of the various counties of the State:
Dear SirÂ»: The Board of Health of the City
and County of San Francisco, desiring to co
operate with the Boards of Health of the va
rious counties of this State in the extirpation
of contagious diseases, and principally tuber
culosis or consumption in cattle, desires to
call attention to the general prevalence of that
disease in dairy herds throughout this State,
nii'l to the absolute necessity of combined
elforta for its eradication.
It neodsno suggestion by us, that it is to the
interest of owners of dairy herds to free such
herds from animals afflicted with contagious
diseases as the entire herd must soon become
infected, and within a short time thus De lost
to their owners.
The Board of Health of this City and County,
following the wise example set by the United
States Government, has begun the inspection
of dairy herds in this City and County by the
United States tuberculin tests, in conjunction
with the Boards of Health of Santa Clara and
Alameda counties, and will continue such in
spection until every animal in these counties
has been inspected with the United States
tuberculin tests and thus proven to be free
from consumption.
We desire to call your attention to the fur
ther fact that the milk ordinance of this City,
recently passed, grants to this board the
power to inspect all dairy herds furnishing
milk to this City and to quarantine against
milk from cows not thus inspected, and we
hereby respectfully notify you that on and
after October 1, 1896, we shall quarantine
against all dairy cows and the mils from dairy
cows thÃt have not been inspected by the
United States tuberculin test, according to
the rules and regulations of the United States
Agricultural Department, Bureau of Animal
Industry.
A complaint from residents of the dis
trict about the intersection of Sausome
street and Broadway that a chemical fac
tory there is creating a nuisance was re
ferred to Health Officer Lovelace for in
vestigation
The board, by a unanimous vote, con
demned the sewer on California street,
which terminates at Walnut street without
an outlet, and also the one on Walnut
street terminating at California street in
the same manner. It was decided to ask
the Board of Supervisors to remedy the
matter by having the sewers joined to an
outlet into the sewer on Central avenue.
Milk Inspector Dockery sent in a com
munication recommending that the milk
permit of P. McDonough, a rancher on
the San Bruno road, be canceled because
of his habit of permitting his cows to feed
in the morass near his place. It was de
cided to give McDonough a chance to de
fend himself at the next meeting of the
board.
The Great Kush Increasing.
The silk department at the big dry goods sale
(by order of the creditors, at 45c on the dollar
of the if Ãs 000 stock of James M. Moran & Co.,
1009-1015 Market street), was the center of
attraction yesterday, and from the smiling
faces of the ladies who were fortunate enough
to approach the counters and get waited on,
one could safely surmise that the bargains
were immense. There was no getting near the
underwear counters in the afternoon, as the
jam was terrific. The big cut in prices has
captured the town. â¢

THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
Sup rvisors Recommend a Change in
the Order of Traffic Exclusion
From the Avenue.
A boulevard may be a thing of beauty
and a joy forever to the disciple of driv
ing pleasure, but a boulevard from which
all wheeled vehicles excepting those for
recreation and pleasure are excluded is
not the kind of a thoroughfare that the
dwellers in the eartern division of Goiden
Gate avenue are clamoring for.
The property-owners and the venders of ;
merchandise enjoy the smoothly paved ]
street. The sight of carriages rolling by j
to the park and ocean is enchanting from
the purely esthetic point of view, but the
gorgeous procession brings no trade. \
When a vehicle with a trader aboard
comes in sight the police turn it aside
and the merchant languishes. The result
of this exclusion is the alleged deprecia
tion of property values on Golden Gate
avenue, from Market to Polk streets.
Rents have declined likewise, and owners
of property find it extremely difficult to
keep tenants on their premises, even
with offers of greatly reduced rents.
Perceiving that something should be
aone to restore the lost trade and enhance I
declining values in real estate, property
owners petitioned the Board of Super- I

2957) so that Golden Gate avenue east of
Van Ness avenue should be excepted from
boulevard regulations.
One of the petitions was signed by the
owners of one-half the property affected.
The names of a large proportion of the re
maining property-owners were embraced
in other petitions. The interested real es
tate owners were largely represented at
the street committee meeting of the Board
of Supervisors yesterday forenoon. Su- j
pervisors Hughes, Benjamin, Morgan
stern and Dunker listened to what was
said.
It was taken into account at the session
that the Merchants' Association bad a high
regard for boulevard attractions, holding
that certain thoroughfares should be re
served and improved for purposes of pleas
ure, travel and recreation. Thomas Mat, r ee,
Captain Taylor, ex-Supervisor Farns
worth and Theodore Knight repre
sented that the merchants on Golden j
Gate avenue stood as high in the
community and were quite as loyal to San
Francisco as the citizens belonging to the
Merchants' Association. Relerence was
made to the depreciation of property
values caused by the exclusion of other
than pastime travel, and the argument i
was strenuously advocated that the ex
clusion of trade wagons west of Van Ness
avenue ought to be sufficient to satisfy the
most ardent adherent of boulevard pro
prieties.
The commercial expansion of the City |
was such that Golden Gate avenue was on j
tne line of development, and no good rea- j
son existed for denying the owners of !
property on that thoroughfare the benefits
of such advancement.
The Supervisors listened respectfully to
all that was said by the delegates from the
avenue, and then they considered a peti
tion from the directors of the Merchants'
Association. This petition, of date June
20, asked that the directors should have a
hearing before the committee recom
mended any amendment to the existing
order.
It was put on record that the Street Com
mittee was always willing to hear the Mer
chants' Association on all pubJi; matters,
but it was deckled, nevertheless, to recom
mend that Goiden Gate boulevard, from
Van Ness avenue east, be opened to traffic.
The question will come up for final adjust- j
ment when the Supervisors in regular ses- ;
sion *hail taKe up the report of the Street j
Committee. Meanwhile Magee, Knight, j
Farnsworth and Taylor ma}' gather their \
forces for the fight in the board, and the j
boulevard advocates may rally to main- j
tain what has been scoured.
The Street Committee also recommended
the full acceptance of following streets:

j selection of this City for its next conven
| tion is due in a great measure to the ac
i tivity of Albert Culm, a prominent jour
nalist of San Jose. This will be the first
National convention of the union ever held
on the Pacific Coast and it is a significant
event to all loyal German-Americans.
The Turners' Union aims at physical
and mental culture and takes an intelli
gent interest in all of the social, political
and economical a uestions of the day. It
is represented in nearly all of the larger
I cities and towns of the United States, and
I has upon its roll 3 the names of some
50,000 members.
The societies number upward of 300.
Americans as well as Germans are
eligible to membership, but every
foreigner must become a citizen of the
United States. The union was organized
! some thirty-five years ago, and its history
has ever since been marked by cuiture and
prosperity,
It is expected that the visiting delegates
alone will be not fewer than 500, exclusive
|of their wives and friends, which will
I make at least a thousand. Like other or
! ganizations of its class, the purpose of the
| convention will be to frame general laws,
j etc., for the thirty odd districts within its
jurisdiction. There will also be the usual
election, speeches and banquets and a jolly
good time is confidently anticipated.
The oldest Turner Union organization
on the Pacific Coast is the San Francisco
Turn Verein. It has been in existence
since 1852 and is pleasantly located at 323
Turk street, where it has a fine gymna
sium, library, reading-room, etc.
The following is the list of its present
officers:
President, G. A, Trost; vice-president,
Henry Dunck; recording secretary, Louis
Brune; corresponding secretary, Hermann
bteklin ; treasurer, Henry Planz; financial
secretary, Henry Stieber; first leader,
Albert Furth ; second leader, Hermann
i Alpen; first librarian, Charles Schullkoff;
'second librarian, Adolf Bergman; ser
j geant-at-arms, B. Baumstark; trustees â
I Louis Marcus, Louis Schneider, Theodore
! Planz, William Plageman and G. A. Trost:
instructor, Professor Robert Barth ; presi-
I dent of the singing section, John Siramen.
The other societies of this City are the
Mission Turn Verein on Eighteenth street,
the Forward Turn Verein on O'Farrell
street and the Verein Eintracht on Twelfth
street. They comprise a total member
ship of about 1000, and the twelve socie
ties scattered throughout the cities ana
towns of - California have at least 3000
more. These figures added to the list of
visiting delegates and friends will give a
total of upward of 5000 persons who may
be expected to assemble in San Francisco
in June, 1898.

MOW COMES THE
RATIFICATION,
A Great Meeting in Met
ropolitan Temple
To-Night.
SUFFRAGISTS TO GATHER
Ciubs All Over the State
Will Celebrate Simul
taneously.
FINE PROGRAMME PREPARED
Many Prominent People Among the
Vice-presidentsâ The San Jose
Delegation.
Metropolitan Temple will be the scene
of great enthusiasm to-night at the ratifi
cation meeting of the suffrage plank.
There are enough sympathizers to fill the
buiiding many times over, but it is hoped
that non-sympathizers will also be pres
ent, and that their conversion will be
Bpeedy and sure.
All over the State the various suffrage
clubs will hold similar meetings. Ardent
speeches will be made by men and women
who believe in equal rights for both sexes,
and enthusiastic indorsement of the
6uffrage plank will be given. The amount
of yellow ribbon worn in California to
night will be unprecedented in the history
of the State. Yellow is the suffrage color,
and Miss Shaw and Miss Yates, who
arrived in this City yesterday from Hum
boldt County, report having left a long
track of yeliow behind them wherever
they lectured.
At Perndaie there was such enthusiasm
for suffrage, after hearing the ladies lec
ture, that the storekeepers draped their
houses with the suffrage color, though to
Bhow that they believed its principles to
be in keeping with true Americanism,
they also used the red, white and biue in
the decorations. All over Humboldt
County there was the same enthusiast,
and in* Eureka the only reason the town
did not go en masse to the suffrage meet
ings was that there was not a hall capable
of holding the entire community. As it
was, hundreds of people had to be turned
away.
Miss Shaw reports that she heard noth
ing but praise for The Call's stand on
the suffrage question. Everywhere people
read n with added interest on account of
iib championship of the woman's cause,
and she considers that this is one of the
most hopeful signs for suffragists at the
coming election.
To-night Miss Shaw will "ratify" with
even more than her wonted eloquence, for
the occasion is one tsat she considers a
red-letter day in her life. For the matter
of that all the suffragists look upon it in
the same litrtit and the amount of concen
trated enthusiasm ami eloquence which
will be vented at tbe same time both here
and In the tifty odd suffrage clubs through
out, the State will, it is expectad, be
enough to bring numbers of unbelievers
and scoffers into the suffrage fold.
A number of citizens of San Jose are
coming to the meeting in Metropolitan
Temt>le to-night. Among those from the
Garden City who will take a prominent
part in tlie proceedings as vice-presidents
are E. O. Smitli, H. V. Morehouse, F. L.
Foster. H. H. Maine, Mrs. Knox Good
rich.
The programme is now entirely ar
ranged. Charles M. Shortridge will repre
f-ent the Republican party, Hon. James
Maguire will speak for the Democrats who
)i?.ve leanings toward woman suffrage and
Thomas V. Cator will speak for the Popu
lis-:s. Five-minute speeches will be made
by Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Miss Mollie Con
ners, Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn, Mrs.
Elizabeth U. Yates and Rev. Anna Shaw,
and Susan B. Anthony will preside.
The following ladies and gentlemen will

The Parishioners of St. Patrick's
Have Their Annual
Outing.
A Day of Uninterrupted Pleasure Spent
Under the Schuetzen Park
Trees.
The annual reunion of the parishioners
of St. Patrick's Church was observed
"Wednesday by an excursion and picnic at
Schuetzen Park, near San Rafaei. These
reunions are held yearly by St. Patrick's
parish in aid of its schools, and they are
always well attended and successful in
every way. But Wednesday's gathering
was the largest ever held under the aus
pices of St. Patrick's, for fully 2000 per
sons boarded the morning boats. The
fare, 60 cents for adults and 25 cents round
trip for children, made the price of a
pleasant midweek outing within reach of
all.
The following were the different com
mittees, the members of which deserve
mention for the excellent manner in
which every detail of the affair was car
., ried oat :
A Committee of arrangementsâ T. L. Doran,
/ balrman ; James P. Gaffney, secretary; Frank
J. Sullivan. Joseph P. Hayes, J. F. O'Brien,
William T. Flynn, J.M. Kirby, John F. Two
mey, William A. Breslln, J. Loney, E. F. Lacy,
M. Boden, William A. Sullivan, G. J. Bough
erty, J. J. Donegan.
Reception committeeâ J. J. Donegan, chair
man; T. L. Doran, M, Boden, John Loney, J. P.
Gaffney.
Floor committeeâ E. F. Lacey, floor manager;
John F. Twomey, assistant; Joseph P.Hayes,
William A. Breslln, James F. O'Brien.
Games committeeâ William T. Fiynn, chair
man; Frank J. Sullivan, George Dougherty, J.
M. Kirby, William A. Suliivan, M. .Boden.
The whole was under the general super
vision of Father Brannan of St. Patrick's
parish.
For amusement, dancing commenced
irimediately upon the arrival of the trains,
and in the afternoon the athletic games
began. There were forty different con
tests on the programme, from a tug-of-war
to a race open to women over 200 pounds
in weight. There was a prize for every
contest donated by merchants of the City.
In the tug-of-war between the married
and single men the former won, being in
formed by their better-halves who were
present that they might expect domestic
trouble if they were defeated. Thiy en
couraged the benedicts and they pulled
the bachelors all over Marin County.
The race for 200-pound women wa? won
by a fleet-footed matron who had been
paced for a week by her daughter on a
bicycle. The fat men's race was won Dy
Thomas Doran, who got away in good
st3 r le, lead all the way around and came
under the wire In suburban time.
Thirty-eight gate prizes were given to
those whose tickets held lucky numbers.
At 6:30 o'clock in the evening the great
crowd boarded a special train and re
turned to the City, having spent a most
enjoyable day, with not an accident to
mar the pleasure of the outing.
AT THE RUINS.
Search for the Bodies in the Wrecked
House Will Begin This
Morning.
The work of removing the wreckage of
the Brighton House on Fifth street will be
begun this morning. All day yesterday
the workmen were bracing up the Lincoln
House adjoining and strengthening the
foundation of the east wall. It was ex
pected that the removal of the debris
would be commenced yesterday, but Dis
trict Engineer Shaushnessey decided that
he would not allow any risk to be taken,
so he had more timbers put under the
building.
The first portion to be cleared away will
be the corner and side where it is believed
there are the dead bodies of one or two
workmen who were caught in the crash.
None of the officials of the Fire Depart
ment believe that there are any bodies
under the ruins, but many of those who
were at work there just previous to the
crash are certain that one or two will be
found.
Coroner Hawkfns and Engineer Shaugh
nessey have been very busy gathering up
the evidence in the case, so that the blame
may be placed where it belongs. The
Coroner yesterday toDk W. Barnettand A.
C. Lutgens, architects, to the wreck, and
with Mr. Shaughnessey they went to
every part they could reach and carefully
examined the timbers, bracings, etc. These
gentlemen, witn several others in their
line who have gone over the premises,
will be called as witnesses at the inquest.
The inquest on the bodies of the four
victims of the wreck will begin to-morrow
morning at 9 o'clock. A large number of
witnesses have been summoned, and the
investigation is likely to consume consid
erable time.
The workmen employed in removing the
debris were kept busy all day yesterday
carting away brick, broken lumber and
dirt, and their operations were watched
by the usual large crowd. A large quan
tity of crockery and furniture was removed
from the restaurant, and strange to say
much was unbroken and in good con
dition.
FARMERS WILL REJOICE.
Now Harrowing and Rolling
May Be Accomplished With
Swift Ease.
An Ingenious Invention by Martin
Gottshall Which Fills a Long-
Felt Asricultural Want.
An Oakland citizen has solved the long
standing problem of how to seed, narrow
and roll ground simultaneously, with the
operator seated comfortably the while.
His machine is light and can be easily
drawn by two horses. Moreover, it will
be put on the market at a rate within the
reach of all.
The notable invention, which, by the
way, is called "The Farmer's Pride," con
sists essentially of a central bar or frame
having an attachment for the team at the
front end, a roller or rollers transversely
journaled at tne rear, and a pair of har
rows having their adjacent edues sus
pended from the intermediate portion of
the bar, with simple mechanism by which
the harrows may be raised or tilted or
dropped at will.
The ordinary seeder can be attached to
the fore part of the harrows, can be
omitted, tne harrows can be used without
the roller or the roller without the har
rows. In fact, the invention represents a
complete cultivating apparatus that will
undoubtedly prove popular.
The operation will be as follows: The
machine having reached the place where
it is to work the harrows are dropped, so
as to rest upon the eroond and the front
end of the machine is adjusted np or down
upon the vertical shaft of the castor wheel
(shown in the cut) to^ give the harrows
the proper angle of draft. When the har
rows are thus drawn over the ground they
will act in the usual manner to pulverize
and break up the soil and clods, and the
rollers following behind will crush any
large unbroken clods and will roll the sur
face down smoothly and even.
The inventor of this ingenious and use
ful combination, which has already been
tested and proved a success, i 9 Martin
Gottshall of Oakland, who, however, has
assigned two-thirds of it to Leopold Kiefer
and Andrew Kruechei of the same place.
George Meyers has the patent rights to
dispose of.
The full weight of the machine, with
operator on board, is barely 1100 pounds,
so that it can readily be drawn by two
horses.

Work for the State in Congress
Approved at a Mass-
Meeting.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL BILL. |
i
It Furnishes the Principal Topic of
Discourseâ Other Important
Questions.
A meeting was held yesterday afternoon
by the Chamber of Commerce in honor of
the Senators and Representatives of Cali
i fornia who have accomplished much for
j the State with reierenco to the improve
! ment of rivers and harburs in the recent
session of Congress.
Hugh Craig presided over the meeting,
j He introduced to the members President
Sunodo of the Yokohama Specie Bank,
and this gentleman, with the Japanese
Consul, occupied the seats of honor, the
former on the right band and the latter on
the left of the chairman.
In presenting Mr. Sunodo Mr. Craig said
the bans he represented would receive
the entire indemnity which China would
j t ay to the empire of Japan in consequence
lof the recent war. A letter, as follows,
was read from Senator White, who was
unable to attend the meeting:
Los Angelks, June 23, 1896.
Captain W. L. Mirry, Secretary Chamber of
Covimerce: Dear Captainâ Yours of the 2Otft
inst., informing me that there has been a
meeting of the Chamber of Commerce called
for 2 o'clock p. m., June 25, has just been- re
ceived. I would be delighted to be present,
but tbe circumstances are such that I cannot
be there. However, this condition of affairs is
rendered immaterial when you consider that
1 am as earnest an advocate of the Nicaragua
canal as any one in the chamber, and will do my
best to forward it and push it to an early com
pletion. Yours sincerely,
Stephkn M. Whits.
Congressman Barham was the first
speaker. He said: "I am pleased to meet j
you. and better pleased inasmuch as Sena- |
tor White seems to voice the sentiments I
that have called us together. The bill j
which provides for the construction of the |
Nicaragua canal will become a law before j
the next meeting of the Legislature. This
statement if made six months ago would
not have been so certain. At that time j
the precise location and many details of â 
the work were not known. After the re- i
survey of the Ludlow committee things !
are now practically clear.
"I understand from President Cleve
land," continued the speaker, "that he i 3 >
of tne opinion that all the people of the
United States favor this bill. He told me
! so with his own mouth. I havenoanxiety !
I whatever that he will veto it, and I know !
' that three-fourths, if not nine-tenths, of j
! the House are in favor of its passage, and
two-tnirds of the Senate.
"In my opinion, the construction of the |
canal will transplant the center of com
merce of the worid and San Francisco will
be in a short time the second 2^ew York."
Congressman Loud then took the lioor |
j and said : "I had not anticipated that this j
I meeting was for the purpose of talking
over the canal proposition. I supposed it
to be a glorification meeting of the alleged
services which we representatives have
done in the Legislature for Cali ornia. It
is not difficult to get a representation for
j this State of ours.
"We may boast of one thing, and not
| falsify, that we have by nature the be 5 t
harbor in the world. There is now very I
little wanted for our harbor. There are a I
few rocks that should be removed. Ido
j not think you can ever remove Mile Rock,
1 but that a beacon or a bell put upon it will
serve the best purpose.
"The Senators at Washington are will
ing to do anything in the world to benefit
our harbor. It is true we feared at one i
time that because Senator Perkins asked >
for so many things for our State we would !
kick the whole thing over and so procure I
nothing, but such was not the case.
"There is no question of such import
tan cc to the people of San Francisco as is
this proposition of the Nicaragua canal.
Every effort should be put forth to get the
next Congress to pass tiiis bill. The more
you urge the more liable you are to suc
ceed."
Congressman Hilborn said: "I do not
come here as a visitor, but as a" friend and
a brother. I have been a member of this
chamber for a long tinio and all my sym
pathy and all my love is centered here.
"My greatest pride is tiiat I was instru
mental in getting for this coast a naval re
serve. The fact of it is that the present I
depressed condition of the country has I
precluded any great improvement for any
State, but I can say that in this California j
has done even better than any of the rest.
An important thing for our State is the '
establishment of a naval training station !
for boys at Goat Island.
"In regard to the Nicaragua canal I
only wish I had the confidence of the
other gentlemen who have spoken regard
i ing the passage of this measure. You
j must remember it means the expenditure
lof millions and millions of dollars. It is
â¢ a transportation proposition and it will
I perhaps come into conflict with certain
I interests."
Congressman Maguire said: "I consider
that the prevention of the passage of the
funding bill is the most important
measure to this State of the Fifty-fourth
Congress. I want to say that the Califor
nia delegation stood shoulder to shoulder
in the accomplishment of this. I, as a
Democrat, would have had a hard time in
j Congress standing alone had not the Re
publican Representatives exerted their
efforts to win over the Republican side.
"In regard to this measure I think Cali
fornia is safe so far as the Fifty-fourth
Congress is concerned, and the same senti*
ments that influenced the Fifty-fourth
Congress will more strongly influence the
Fifty-fifth Congress."
The speaker spoke of Loud as the Nestor
of the California delegation, and said that
the burden of getting improvements for
California had rested upon him. Speak
ing of the delay in the building of the
Postoffice for this City, he said that one
cause was undoubtedly the insufficiency
of the force in the supervising architect's
office at Washington.
"I think," said he, "that by the latter
part of this year the work will be begun
and speedily carried to completion."
Senator Perkins, who had been called
upon first to speak, but had excused
himself on the plea of not being a
stranger, but one of the home body, said :
"For more than twenty years I have
been a member of this Chamber of Com
merce." He spoke in complimentary
language regarding the distinguished
Japanese gentleman present, saying that
he had come on a mission which would
result in vast benefit to both the United
States and Japan.
"Senators or Representatives," said he,
"know no partisanship after they pass the
Sierra Nevada Mountains going eastward."
He enumerated the many things that had
been secured for California during the last
session of Congress, and paid a high
compliment to the Pacific builders of men
of-war, saying they ranked highest of any
in the country.
"There is no land on God' 3 footstool,"
concluded he, "that has the resources and
big-hearted men of California."
The following resolution was unani
mously passed:
Resolved, That the thanks of the Chamber of
Commerce of San Francisco are hereby respect
fully tendered to the honorable members of
tne California delegation for their successful
eflorta on behalf of the State of California dur
ing the lirst session of the Fifty-fourth Con
gress, and for their assurance of aid hereafter,
especially in the passage of the Nicaragua
canal bill.
Resolutions of thanks were also ten
dered Senator Morgan of Alabama in be
half of the people of the Pacific Coast for
the efforts he has made in their behalf.

FATHER CLARK'S LECTURE
Traces the Development of the
Arts and Sciences to the
Church.
Says It Is a Time When the Bulwarks
of the Church Need Much
Guarding.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 25.â Rev. Arthur
M. Clark, the Paulist father of San Fran
cisco, lectured before a large audience in
the Macdonough Theater this evening.
John P. Irish occupied the chair and in
troduced the lecturer. Several members
of the local priesthood were on the plat
form.
Father Clark took for his subject the
' claim that the world of to-day owes much
|to the Catholic church. He traced the
present high state of development of the
arts and sciences to the careful manner in
which they had been fostered and pro
tected by the Catholic church. Particular
I attention was given to the teachings of the
j church in regard to morality and to the
! preservation of the sanctity of the home.
"If the world had been left to the minis
! trations of the mother church," said the
I sneaker, "we should not have a country of
poor..ouses, lunatic asylums and prisons.
It is not our teaching that has produced
the fearful state of affairs that now con
i fronts us. In every age our doctrine has
: been the same and we have endeavored to
inculcate in the young mind those grand
principles that alone can carry the soul
through this world of temptations and
preserve it unsullied till it is awarded its
eternal prize.
"In every branch of art and science it is
â  the church that has developed it and the
names of the noblest men in the pages ol
history are those who have labored and
died within its pale. Surely no one will
say a disparaging word of the noble Sher
man because he was a Roman Catholic.
"Never was there a time when the bui
walks of the church need as much guard
ing as they do to-day; but we have noth
ing to fear. We have a plain duty to per
form in training the young mind, and so
long as we do this nothing will prevail
against us."
Mourned by His Comrades.
On Wednesday night James Walsh, one of
I the best firemen in the Fire Department, died
at his home nt 136 Eighth street. He was a
member of engine company 17, on Mint
avenue. Walsh had been confined to his home
for two months pnst In consequence of a
severe cold contracted from getting wet at a
fire on Eighth and Natoma streets two months
ago. The cold turned into a case of quick con
j sumption. The funeral will be held to-day
\ from St. Joseph's Church. Two men have
j been detailed from each fire company to at
| tend the funeral. The house of engine 17 has
been draped in mourning. Walsh was 32
years of age.
Abbott's Napoleon.
Rev. John S. C. Abbott's "Life of Na
poleon" is brought to the mind by the
death of his widow, a most estimable lady,
who was an essential aid to him in his
literary work. She is said to have trans
lated much from the French for him in
bil writings of Napoleon. A reliable anec
dote of Mr. Abbott is related as showing
the spirit in which he entered upon this
biography. While it was in the course of
publication in Harper's Magazine a mem
ber of the Harper firm was approached in
remonstrance against the favorable view
taken by Mr. Abbott of this man of blood.
Mr. Harper said he would see Mr. Abbott
upon the subject. He told his inquirer a
day or two later that he had done so and
that Mr. Abbott had assured him that
every morning when he entered his study
to engage in this work his first act was to
put up a prayer to God to be guided aright
in what he should send out to the world.
Mr. Harper had a firm belief that the
truth would be reached under these condi
tions.âBoston Herald.

NEXT TAX LEVY
STATE AND CITY,
Will Not Exceed $i 67
and It May Go
Lower.
THE CITY VALUATION.
An Increase of Twelve Millions
of Dollars or More
Assured.
FIGURES ON THE STATE ROLL
City Collections on Personal Property
Now Exceed a Half
Million.
i
Assessor Siebe is diligently at work on j
the assessment roll and will file it within I
the time prescribed by law.' He said yes
terday that he would not ask for an ex
tension.
The Assessor was not willing to make an
approximate estimate of the total valua
tion, but readily admitted that it would
be m excess of last year's valuations. It
is figured by men who claim to be familiar |
with values that the total amount will ap- j
proximate $340,000,000, or an increase of \
$12,000,000 over the last roil.
The collection of personal property taxes,
unsecured by real estate, is progressing in
I lively styie. The amount taken up to noon
j yesterday was $545,967 72, a sum $100,000
in excess of last year's collections. As no
tax-levy has been fixed for this year the
collection is made on last year's rate of
is 2 25. This accounts in a measure for the
j large increase. Ultimately the City must
j refund to the tax-payers the difference be- '
i tween $2 25 and the forthcoming rate. The
I law so provides. Thirty thousand tax
| payers will each be entitled to a rebate,
but in many instances the amount will be
so small that application may not be
made.
In making this readjustment a vast deal j
of work will be imposed upon the Super
visors, Auditor and Treasurer. Every ap
j plication must be made to the Board of
Supervisors, and when allowed the money
cannot be drawn from the treasury with- |
out an order from the Auditor.
No one can yet tell exactly what the I
next tax levy will be, because the valua- ;
tion of all taxable property is still an un- |
| known quantity, and the amounts to be !
| allowed by the Supervisors for the various j
; departments of the municipal goyern
j ment have not been determined.
Auditor Broderick made a calculation
| that the value of taxable property would !
!be $330,000,000. The estimate is "likely to
| be under the actual return, but the figures
may be changed before the Supervisors,
sitting as a Board of Equalization, get
through with the roll.
The Auditor did not allow many extras
on his estimates, but figured nearly every
thing down to a business basis. Still he
thinks the board should diminish rather
than increase his allowances. In taking j
I the total of his estimates and calculating
I that the assessment roll will reach $330,-
I 000,000, he figures that the local rate
should not exceed $1 17, and might go as
low as $1 07.
Governor Budd in a general way has
more than once indicated that the State
levy would not exceed 48 cents. Since he
made this calculation reports have
reached members of the State Board of
Equalization that there would be quite a
shrinkage in the valuation.
Allowing that the State rate will be 50
cents and tne local rate $1 17, the levy
would be $1 67, or 58 cents low- r than the ,
last levy. It is possible that the rate may
go as low as $160, in view of the increas
ing public sentiment toward retrench
ment in State and municipal affairs.
There should be in the State treasury a j
surplus of $1,000,000, because the Governor ;
insisted that the revenue bill passed by
j the Legislature should cover all the ap
| propriations made by the session. Many
jof the appropriations were unconstitu-
I tional and extravagant, and so they were
! vetoed. The result was the taking of
$1,000,000 more than was necessary out of
circulation and putting it in the State
treasury. The next Legislature is likely
to appropriate it with great gladness.
The next local levy will not embrace
anything for the new City Hall construc
tion, but a large sum must be raised for
election expenses, so one will about offset
the other.
THE BUILDING TRADES.
Rival Bricklayers' Unions Ask for Rec
ognition by the Council.
The Building Trades Council met last
evening at 1159 Mission street and the sec
retary was instructed to secure headquar
ters for the council in some other build
ing.
Representatives from the rival bricklay
ers' unions, the local and the international,
addressed the council upon the matter of
affiliating therewith. It was left to the
grievance committee to decide within
thirty days which of the two unions
should be recognized by the council.
Attention was callea to the fact that
next Thursday is the day set for the rule
to go into effect which prohibits all union
workmen from finishing work where union
men have been called out on account of
the presence of non-union men. In many
cases union men have been ordered out on
striKe because non-union men were em
ployed and when the latter finished their
work the union men were allowed to re
turn, but hereafter they are prohibited
from doing so.
On Tuesday night a union mas3- meeting
of all connected with the buildinp trades
will be held at 115 Turk street to elect two
new business agents. It was decided that
the grievance committee of the council
should be increased to six members, to be
selected monthly.
The boycott on the new California
League baseball grounds on Sixteenth
and Folsorn streets has been raised by the
council.
To Be Made a Family Hotel.
The trustees of the Mercantile Library Asso
ciation hare had under consideration for some
time the project of rearranging the upper two
floors of the library building and converting
them into a family "hotel. At the last mi rting
of the trustees this idea was favorably acted
upon. The architect of tbe association has
prepared plans and specifications which call
for sixty-six rooms, parlors, dining-room, etc.
The location of the building, on Van Ness and
Golden Gate avenues, is one of the most cheer
ful Rnd sunny in the City. The s.Z2 of the
building is 137:6x120, with v frontage on
three streets, nil paved with bituminous rock.
These features, together with a reasonable
rent and long-term lease, are strong induce
ments to a hotel proprietor. The estimated
cost of making the contemplated improve
ments will be from $3000 to $t>ooo.

HE SAVES HUMAN LIFE,
How to Restore Those Who Lose
Consciousness Through
Immersion.
Professor Kiliick Thinks That Every
Child Should be Taught to Swim
and to Help Others.
"Next to swimming, and it is my
strong opinion that every child should be
taught to swim," said Professor Frederick
H. Kiliick of the Sutro Baths yesterday,
"every child should be taught the princi
ples of life-saving, that is, the methods
necessary to restore to animation those
who have become insensible from immer
sion. It has been my privilege in the past
few years to lecture on this subject to
more than 25,000 school children in Canada
and in the United States. I have spent a
number of years in the study of the vari
ous methods used by men prominent in
Europe and the United States, those of Dr.
Sylvester, Dr. Hall and of Dr. Howard,
which is that most practiced in the United
States. I have taken the best points
from each and combined them with a view
of obtaining the very best results in a case
of emergency.
"How do I proceed in the case of an in
dividual who, to use a common expres
sion, goes beneath the surface for a third
time? 1 will tell you what Ido in case
such an emergency occurs at a point where
there are none of the appliances that are
in use in life resuscitation stations.
"Whoever brings the body from the j
water should before landine it allow it to
float face downward, lor a moment only.
The body of a person in tnat condition
should never be floated on the Back. Say,
for instance that such a body was brought !
from the waters on to the beach close by i
here, I should, as soon as possible wade 'â 
in, crouch under the approaching body j
and in raising form an arch of my back,
and in that way elevate the body out of
the water. I would then move quickly to
land. The knack in securing the body is
to have the lower limbs swing over the
left shoulder and drop forward and in that
way give me a sure hold on the individual,
then the individual's stomach rests on my
back at an angle of about forty degrees,
and while in that condition the
tfater which is in the lungs and
cavity of the chest escapes through
the mouth, every motion I make
causing a pressure against the cavity
which helps to force out any water that
may have been in it and which had not of
its own weight escaped. If there was a
house close uy I would carry the body
there and Keep every one away except two
persons who could assist. If not the body
should be laid on the sand and the mouth
and nostrils at once wiped free from a
mucus that is formed in every case.
Then the tongue should be secured by
either tying a rubber band around it, or if i
none is handy a piece of string will do. j
Then the tongue should be pulled forward I
and held so that it. cannot fall brick and I
close the windpipe, and while this is being |
done I would stand over the body, place
my hands under it on a line with tne
shoulders and having locked them would
rock the body deliberately from side to
side, one of the arms of the individual
being placed in such a position that the
head will roll on it and prevent it from
being chafed b}' the sand.
"Then the body should be rested on a
roll which can be made of a coat or any
thing that will make an elevation of four
inches. This should be placed a little be
low the shoulders, so that the chest will
form an arch. This having been done, and
mind you a!) this is done in c remarkablj
short space of time, I would commence
producing artificial respiration. This
is done first by placing the thumbsof each
I hand, end to end, over the breast bone and |
extending the lingers in such a way as to
cover as much as possible of the stomach,
then pressing down and raising the hands
without removing them from the body,
keeping up that motion. The arms should
by another person be taken at the elbows
and raised forward and lowered after the
fashion of a pump handle in a regular
manner and that kept up until there is a
sign of a return of natural breathing.
When that is noticed the patient shoald I
be chafed to assist the circulation of the
blood, which has become dormant but has
not lost its vitality, and after that grad
ual heat should be applied and rest en
couraged.
"In the rooms set apart in this place for
me I have all the appliances that are in
use in saving the life of those apparently
drownea, and I have some improvements
which my observation has proved to ms
are of material assistance in the worK.
One of these is a steam bed, on which the
patient is placed as soon as it is ascer
tained that natural respiration has been
set up. It is covered with several thick
nesses of blankets, and the moment the
patient is laid on it there is a blanket in a
roll at the foot of the bed which is used to
cover him. This is first folded in the cen
ter, then pleated and rolled, and when
pushed forward it unrolls like a thing of
life and falls over the patient and covers
him in the most perfect manner without
creating the cold that is produced by
throwing a blanket over the patient. As
the patient needs heat it is applied through
a steam pipe under the bed until full
sensibility is restored and the patient is
strong enough to be removed to another
room.

Two new plays were produced by the

Scene From William Greer Harrison's New Curtain-Raiser, "Expiation.**
the fashion to serve ut> to the audience by I
way of an appetizer before the solid fare i
of the evening begins, ana the other was '
a sparkling little comedy which described |
the attempts at matrimony committed by j
the three Miss Biddies.
William Greer Harrison wrote the half- ;
hour of concentrated agony especially for
the Columbia School. It described one of
those episodes which in plays and novels
occur in men's lives and make their hair
go gray prematurely and the shadow of
mysterious melancholy settle down on
them forever. The play was named "Ex- j
piation." It was French, very French â I
in fact, it was so French that parents and
guardians sitting in the theater some
times clutched the elbows of their arm
chairs tightly and held their breath in
.terrified, suspense for fear what was com- !
ing was â well, wns just a little too French j
for the young people of the school.
Their" alarm was without foundation j
however. William Greer Harrison had ;
skated over tnin ice occasionally, but he;
had done it so skillfully that there was no !
cause for trembling or even for a passing .
qualm. "Expiation" tells how Marie, a j
French orphan, was beloved by Henri Dv |
Foise, the son of a French land owner. In
stead of rejoicing at the presence of cupid !
in his family, the landowner what Dick- i
ens in one of his novels describes as '
"flops" to his son, to abjure him to re- j
frain.
Henri refuses to refrain, whereupon a ;
village priest, who possesses the paternal j
name of Father Pere, reveals the prewsome i
Btory. Years before Marie' 3 father had j
loved Mane's mother maaly, passionately, :
selfishly. Matters came to such a pass j
that it was necessary for Henri's father to j
kill Marie'a father. The villain had caused
him to be defeated as- a conscript, which
shows that he was very young, but he re- j
turned from the war alone at nighi and j
does the deed.
This awful story moves Henri to de- ,
spair. He hears a drum and life band \
without, and bidding a hasty and last fare- ;
well to Marie and his faUier, he rushes off. ;
in evening dress, like the heroes of Water- j
100, to die for iais country, while Marie
falls on her knees and promises to be a !
daughter to her father's slayer.
The play was cleverly acted by James j
Keane, who, as the avenger, erred only by
too faithful a reproduction of Henry Irv- ,
ing's mannerisms, by Thomas Hickey as
Henri, E. Lestrado, who was dignified and
convincing as the Father Pere, and by, Miss
Minna Terry as Marie
â¢â¢The Three Miss Biddies is a work of
so much promise that it is safe to augur .i
very bright future as a playwright for chat
clever younc native daughter, Miss Alice
Yates Grant. An eccentric uncle has died,
leaving untold piiver to any or each of
the three Miss Biddies who shall marry
a man whose name begins with "R. Ibe
unurinc complications Miring from this
situation and the appearance of a Reginald
Ronald iialston on the scene are most
amuMnely portrayed. The young play
wright has worked up her point splen
didly; she makes enough of her comedy
situations, but never works them to death.
Ail the performers in this cast were good ;
the" were: R. W. Travers, Miss Helen
HiÃby, Mibs Florence K. Minot and Miss
Nettie Hynes. .
"Sunset," by Jerome K. Jerome, was
pleasingly acted by R. W. Travers, George
Godfrey. O. Humphries, Miss May Cap
well, Miss Gracie Gray and Mips Cecelia
Harmon. George Godfrey and Miss Gray
especially distinguisned themselves,
though all the acting was excellent.
The dancing was the weakest feature of
the performance, not that the young
people did not show grace, but the char
acter of the dances had not been pre
served. Every one who has read the good
old novels of the last century remembers
that the Pamelas and the Clarissas of the
period were always invited by their beaux
to "walk" a minuet. The idoa of pranc
ing with uplifted feet through its stately
measures would have shocked their sensi
tive souls. Â
On the part of the pupils yesterday a
light, springy step was adopted, which
looked |like an incipient desire to do some
high kicking. It was a very pretty dance,
but it was not the minuet de la cour.
In the Spanish bolero the modern art of
high kicking also obtruded itself, to the
destruction of the real character of the
dance. Spanish dancers wear skirts almost
ro the ankles, and instead of dancing
entirely with the feet, their grace comes
from the swaying rhythmic movement of
the whole body. The dance was pretty,
but it was :iot*a bolero.
A clever performance was given by little
Juliet, who danced with a mask at the
back of her head.
Miss May Warring gave a clever ex
hibition of fencing with Professor Emil
Tortoni.
LILLIAN CROOME DIVORCED.
Judge Troutt Decided That the Dentist
"Was Extremely Cruel.
Judge Troutt yesterday granted a
divorce to Lillian Croome on the ground
of extreme cruelly. Mrs. Croome was the
wife of Dr. William Croome, the dentist.
The plaintiff is a sister of Dr. Decker,
another dentist.
The case was heard in chambers by
Judge Troutt, the principal allegation
being that Croome beat his wife with a
hairbrush and called ncr vile names.
The plaintiff was allowed $40 a month
alimony and $150 counsel fees.
Judge Troutt also divorced Domenicco
Curcia from Antonia Curcia on the ground
of willful desertion.

SPYKE MISSED THE "GO"
The Dutch Traveler Who Hadn't
Heard of Corbett Fell
Asleep.
______________
Rises Early, Posts Himself on All the
Fistic News and Takes in a
Einetoscope.
H. Y. Spyke, the traveler from Holland
who had never heard of Corbett, did not
see the fight after all, as he fell asleep at
the California from the fatigue of his
journey, the last day of which necessi
tated a start at 4 o'clock a. m.
He was up early enough yesterday morn
ing, however, and had so far posted him- j
self on fistic contests and the engagement j
of the previous night that in the afternoon j
he was discussing the possibility of Cor
bett's appearing in Oakland before start
ing eastward for the purpose of meeting
Fitzsimmons in England.
"Do you think there will be another
light in the next few weeks?" was bis first
query. "If there is one I will stay for it. j
"After 1 read the papers this morning I j
went to see in a kinetoscope a fight. Oh, :
it was very fine. I saw Corbett hit a man j
so fast and then he knocked him down.
"I saw some men driving horses all with j
sicrns, 'The Races, Ingleside.' Where is
that? I want to see that."
Out came a notebook and on a page ;
where he nad already written "Cliff j
House," "Burlingame," he jotted down
directions to Ingleside.
"And can you tell me what is this
â¢Lucky Baldwin, the God of Love?' 1 !
want to see that, too. Oh, I thought it ;
was a great piece of statuary, may be, in
your park.
"I am just now writing to my brother in
Amsterdam all about what I have seen.
I tola him that this Golden Gate in the '
land of gold is no more golden than the I
Red Sea is red and just some ugly bluff of j
earth.
"The editor of the Telegraph, the big- j
gest paper in Holland, takes the letters j
from my brother and publishes what '
things he wishes from them. The papers I
in my country have not so many pages as !
yours, nor have they so large circulation, j
for in Holland there are only 4,500,000 |
people, though Amsterdam is larger than j
San Franci?co. It has 500,000 Deople.
"1 wrote to my brother that the women
on this side are very much prettier than
on the other side. The women in New
York, ngh, they are not beautiful.

bought in Germany it aays: 'Palo Altoâ
where there is a great university, but more
fine horses than students.' lam going to
see every town between San Francisco and

"When I was reading a sign the other
day where it said 'Our Next President 1
and a big crowd was there a man took me
by the shoulders behind, shook me. hit
nic on the shoulder and said 'What's the
matter with McKinley?'
"I don't like that anymore than the
American that came to Holland and could

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1896.
TO BETTER THE
SCHOOL LAWS,
Pertinent Recommendations
of the Rules Com
mittee.
TARDY TEACHERS FINED
Janitors in Future Will Have
to Weigh All the School
Coal.
HOISTING THE NATIONAL FLAG
Increased Patriotic Observancesâ New
Sanitary Laws, More Holi
days, Etc.
The rules and regulations governing the
public schools of San Francisco are just
now being amended and revised to con
form to the ideas of the School Directors,
each succeeding set of whom is presumed
to be wiser than any of its predecessors.
Recently th? Board of Education, realiz
ing the necessity of asserting its individu
ality of authority, authorized the appoint
ment by Superintendent Babcock of a
committee of principals, consisting of
Frank Morton of the Lowell High School,
Joseph O'Connor of the Horace Mann
Grammar, Emma E. Stincen of the Whit
tier Primary and Miss P. H. Nolan of the
Washington Evening, to mane such sug
gestions as were deemed desirable to the
better government of the schools.
After mature deliberation the Rules
Committee, consisting of T. R. Knox
(chairman), A. Comte Jr. and H. C. Hen
derson, has agreed upon a number of
changes which will be finally decided in a
committee of the whole.
The dates of the opening and the closing
of the school terms have been changed,
tardy teachers are held to a stricter ac
countability, patriotic observances are ex
tended and emphasized, and janitors are
required to keep check on the coal con
tractors. The new rules comprise the fol
lowing provisions:
The first term of the public schools shall be
gin on the first Monday of August, and end on
the Friday next preceding Christmas. The
second term shall begin on the Monday follow
ing the first day of January, and end on the
third Friday of June.
State Labor day is added to the list of school
holidays.
If a teacher shall fail to be at bis or her post
of duty at the appointed hour three times in
any one calendar month the principal shall re
port such tardiness to the committee on rules,
and if tliereafter the same teacher is similarly
tardy, he or she shall forfeit half a day's sal
ary.
Teachers are strictly forbidden to require J
their pupils to perform any menial service or !
to send them on private or personal errands i
during school hours.
The power to transfer pupils from one school
to another, when good reasons exist for so
doing, is taken from the Classification Com
mittee and vested in the Superintendents.
Any High School student may so arrange his
or her studies, under the direction of the prin
cipal, as to complete the regular course In four
or more years.
Physicians' certificates of vaccination, etc. ,
.given to pupils, must be countersigned by the
1 Health Officer before they can be received in
the schools.
Janitors shall weigh all coal received at the
schools and shall report thereon to the princi
pals. Certificates of these weights shall be
signed by the principals and sent by them to
the Secretary of the Board of Education, who
shall make a record of the same and then send
them to the committee on supplies.
Janitors shall raise the American flag on
school-houses on the first and last school day
of the school year and on the last school day
before and the first school day after each vaca
tion ; during public exercises, on Washing
ton's birthday, Bunker Hill day, the Fourtn
of July. Admission day. Patriotic day and on
such other days as may t>e ordered by the
Board of Education, the President of the
Superintendent. The flag must be at half
mast on Memorial day, on the death of a
teacher or pupil and on such other days as
may be ordered by the board, the President or
the Superintendent.
Garnisheetl Kochctte's Money.
Jacob Raver yesterday filed in the Sheriff's
office an attachment against Charles Rochette's
money for boxing at the Pavilion on the pre
vious night. The story goes that Rochette got
in debt $60 when trainine for a previous fight,
and his creditors sprung the garnishee on the
night of the fijjht at the Pavilion. An answer
was filed that the claim had been transferred.
Want* Sutro's Wood.
E. A. Reddy, superintendent of the Alms
house, asks permission of the Board of Super
visors to contract with AdolphSutro for 100
cords of wood at $5 per cord. The superin
tendent sets forth that the wood is accessible,
well suited for the bakery, that the price is
low and the cost of hauling much less than it
would cost to haul it from the City.

Rescued a Chinese Girl.
Miss Susie Williams has asked to be ap
pointed guardian of Ah Sui, a little Chinese
?;irl, who was rescued from a house of ill
ame by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children. General McComb was her
guardian, and at his death the parents of the
child made an effort to get possession of her.
A writ of habeas corpus was Issued by Judge
Troutt, but the matter is now in Judge Slack's
bands.
DETERMINED TO DIE.
Joseph Brady Jumps Into the Bay, bat
Is Bescned.
Joseph Brady, an old man without a
home, jumped into the bay from Clay
street wharf yesterday afternoon. He was
rescued and taken to the Eeceiving Hos
pital.
"I was despondent," said Brady, "and I
want to end my life, as 1 have nothing to
live for. I was once foreman of the Pio
neer Woolen Mill?, but for some years I
have been trying to earn a living by ped
dling.
"My two boys died eight years ago on
the same day from drohtneria and I am
always dreaming about them. I heard
them calling to me from the bay,, but
when I jumped into the water they were
not there. I want to get to them and what
is the use of always dragging me out of
the water."
About two months ago Brady tried to
drown himself in toe bay. He says the
next time he will do it when no one is
around. _
A CHINESE BURGLAR.
Tom Tee, Alias American Jim, Sent to
the County Jail.
Tom Yee, aiias American Jim, was sent
to the County Jail for six months by
Judge Conlan yesterday on the charge of
keeping an opium resort on Sacramento
street.
American Jim is the oldest and best
known Chinese burglar on the Pacific
Coast. For the past thirty-six years he
has been sent to the penitentiary seven
times for burglary.
He is now over CO years of age and a
physical wreck. After he has been in the
County Jail for a short time efforts will be
made to have him deported.
FREUD AND THE LADIES,
The Secretary of the Merchants'
Association Defends the
Charter.
Points Out Some Erroneous Impres
sions of the American Woman's
Liberal League.
Secretary Freud of the Merchants' Asso
ciation is not disposed to permit any at
tack on the proposed new charter to go
unchallenged. This is his reply to the op
position to tne instrument manifested by
the American Woman's Liberal League:
To the Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir: In your
issue of this inoriii ng appeared certain resolu
tions passed by the American Woman's Liheral
League in opposition to the charter. Without
intending to discourage these ladies in their
commendable enthusiasm in the public wel
fare, justice to the charter and its iramers
makes it Droper and necessary to correct them
in their erroneous conclusions.
Keterring to the clause in the charter re
quiring teachers in the primary and grammar
classes ol our public schools to be educated in
the school system of the State, the ladies seem
to lose sight of the fact that this clause can
refer only to teachers to be engaged hereafter,
not to those who are now in the department;
and if the application of this principle of
patronizing as it were home production is not
found a desirable feature of the charter it
can, of course, be amended accordingly.
These ladies are also greatly surprised not to
find anything In the charter governing the
eleclion'of the Mayor and certain other offi
cials as well as amendment of the charter. If
they will kindly turn to the constitution of
California and the general laws of the State
beating upon cities and counties they will find
ample provision for these very matters. It
would be idle and superfluous for the charter
to repeat provisions already clearly declared
in the constitution and general laws of the
State.
The resolutions rlso state that there are no
provisions in the charter "along the lines laid
down by modern sociology." Not being en
tirely ct-rb-.m ns to the exact meaning of this
! declaration, I must forego the privilege of
j innking any attempt at the solution of the
I conunurum.
In conclusion, it certainly must occur to the
i average citizen that the charter is an excel
lent document when it js considered that the
objections so far raised against it are so weak
ami baseless. The friends of the charter only
ns_ the citizens of San Francisco to read and
consider its provisions. While it is by no
means perfect, it certainly is infinitely su
perior to the present laws governing the City.
Kespectiully yours, J. Richd Freud.

Liberty and the other for the personage
representing the State of California. This
was passed.

had struggled through 120 poetical selec
tions sent in as competitive productions
for me one patriotic pueni. Of these the
committee selected a number of the best
for critical examination.

deliver the opening prayer at the exercises
in the Pavilion and to invoke the benedic
tion.
The parade committee submitted the
following resolution:
Whereas, The ex-Union Veterans have,
through their organization, accepted an invi
tation to parade on July Fourth; therefore,

Jienolvcd, By the ex-Union Veterans on the
parade committee that the grand marshal
issue an invitation through the press asking
all ex-Union veterans not attached to any or
ganization, and all ex-Confederate veterans to
join in the parade.
Signed, MÂ«jor J. A. Whitesides, Captain L.
Hanson, J. H. Garrett, Captain L. J. Kearney,
Captain John Tuttle.
The invitation and reception committee
reported that Manager Vining bad allowed
free transportation to orphans to Golden
Gate Park. Donations have been prom
ised from the .Baldwin and California Ho
tels of 500 sandwiches each, and from Mr.
Wiseman of 200 and Mr. Marsden 250
doughnuts. J

LOOK OUT FOR
YOUR REGISTRATION
Things Are Different This
Year and Time Is
Already Short.
MANY WILL BE TOO LATE
Only Thirty Eight Days Left' for
Over Sixty Thousand
Citizens. â¢
WILL WAKE UP FOR THE BUSH
Registration Ends Three Months
Before Election and Many Will
Be Disfranchised.
There is danger that thousands of the
citizens of San Francisco will be disfran
chised this year through failure to get
their names on the great register under
the new conditions which rule registra
tion this year. This danger is being espe
cially urged by A. Ruef, chairman of the
registration committee of the State Cen
tral Committee, and by members of the
County Committee-
No citizen of this City who is not prop
erly registered nearly three months before
election day may cast his ballot on No
vember 3. The coming campaign is one
which will enlist the interest of every
voter in the land, and it is especially in
cumbent on Republican voters to see that
the power of their ballots is not lost in the
coming momentous issue through their
own negligence.
The danger described lies in the radical
change in the registration proeramme
v. men ihe mass of the citizens have not
realized. By acts of the last Legislature
registration in San Francisco now begins
160 days before the general election and
continues lor seventy-five days.
Registration at the City Hall thus oe
gan May "JT and will end August 3.
Whether or not the usual five days "of pre
cinct registration should follow has been a
disputed question owing to the uncer
tainty of the mixture of amendments to
the law, but Registrar Hinton has decided
to hold precinct registration and it is not
likely to De contested.
The fifth day of precinct registration
will be August 9 and with the close of the
books on that day the last chance of any
citizen o! San Francisco to get on the
register will be gone If his name is not
registered then he will not vote.
Voters are ?o used to the old Jaw which
allowed registration up to within a few
days of election day that tbey are just
naturally putting it off, thinking that
there is plenty of time. Many have gone
and are going away on vacation trips
which will keep them away until after
August 3, and when they come back they
will be surprised to find that they will
have no vote to cast this fall. Everybody
who is putting off registration is laying
up trouble and annoyance for himself by
waiting, for a time, very soon to come,
when he will have to take his place in a
long line when the rush comes.
Twenty-four of the seventy-five days of
central registration have Â«one and but 250
a day are now being registered. If this
lasts a few days longer it will become a
physical impossibility to register the ap
plicants. To register the full vote will re
quire an average of 1800 registrations a
day. This illustrates the danger and the
prospects of the rush the belated ones will
find themselves in a few days hence.
"Republicans in San Francisco must
wake up to the necessity of getting regis
tered at once," said A~. Ruef, yesterday,
"for there is danger that a great many will
be disfranchised.
"It is not generally realized that the
change in the law closes registration nearly
three months before election day, and the
voters who are used to registering along to
ward election time carelessly think. 'Oh,
well, there's plenty of time.
"But there isn't plenty of time. Twenty
four of the seventy-live days have *:one
and but about 6000 have registered. Nearly
L'OOO a day will Have to be registered from
now on to get all the voters op the regis
ter, and you can see what is coming.
"The people are thinKing that while reg
istration begins early this year it keeps up
till about the usual time, and they have
got into the habit of waiting until thirty
days or so before election. But this year
it clobes three months instead of fiftee n
days before election. This change was
made to give an opportunity to purify the
register. People are going to the country,
to be gone for weeks, a time of rushing
and crowding is near at band and all
around there is danger, and in <act a cer
tainty, that many voters will lose their
chance to vote because they have not at
tended to their registration.
"This matter is of special importance to
the Republicans, and they should be
urgod to attend at once to registration by
every possible means."
HOW REGISTRATION GOES.
The Urgency of the Situation as It
Appears at the Registrar's
Office.
There are thirty-eight days yet remain
ing in which the voters of this City may
get their names on the great register.
The citizen who fails in that cannot vote.
The register has been open now just
twenty-four days, and in that time there
have registered just 5638 voters. On the
twenty-fourth day of the registry in 1894
the total number of registrations was 10,
--647, or nearly double the number regis
tered this year.
Registrar Hinton says the reason is the
change in tbe law which requires the reg
istry to be opened and closed more than
sixty days earlier and more than that
time before tbe election. He says that
unless the voters respond to the" call to
register very much more rapidly than
they nave been doing of late it will be a
physical impossibility to register them in
the final rush. With ihe ordinary service
it would be an open question if they could
do so now were it not for precinct regis
tration. On the 3d of August the registra
tion books at the central office will be
closed and on the 4th they will be turned
over to the precinct officers. They will
conduct ihe work in the several precincts
for five days. At the end of that time the
big books will be slammed shut, not to be
opened again for the adding of any man's
name before the election, although elec
tion day will stiil be nearly three months
in the future.
Tbe ratio of registration is increasing,
but not rapidly enough to meet the situa
tion. On the first nay the books were
opened ninety-nine names were placed on
them. Yesterday tbe number registered
was 258. The total number registered to
date as stated is 5638. Registrar Hinton
estimates that the total number who
ought to register this year, based on the
statistics of past years, should be about
74.000. The total number registered in
1894 was 68,039. This being a Presidential
year the vote called out should reach 10
per cent above that figure unless the edu
cational provision of the new law should
cut the number down. With, say, 6000 in
ronnd numbers registered now and count
ing the total number who may wish to be
registered at 74,000 there remains yet to be
registered as many as were registered
altogether in 1594â 68,000â ana twenty-four
days of the period in which it may be done
are already gone.
With thirty-eight days m which to do
the work there will have to register an
average of 1800 a day. In view of the fact
that yesterday only 258 names were placed
on the book. Registrar Hinton's anxiety is
easily accounted for. In 1894, to be sure,
about a third of the total enrollment was
made in the few days of the precinct regis
tration. That will probably be the case
this year, but even then the work to be
done" may be more than can be done.
There are twenty-eight men now em
ployed in the offices of the Registrar.
They are not very busy â at least the men
in the registry booths are not. They
should be kept busy by applicants for
registry.
Speaking of the educational qualification
Mr. Hinton says there is likely to be some
misconception. The law requires that
every voter shall be able to read the con
stitution, except â that is the pomt â every
voter except those who were 60 years of
age on the 4th of November, 1884, and all
those who were registered and therefore
qualified to vote that year.
All persons who are in doubt about elec
tion matters this year will have only to
ask Senator P. J. Murphy, who is in
charge of the information bureau in the
Registrar's office, and have the doubts
cleared up.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1896.
LUCKY BALDWIN
BEING GRILLED,
Attorney Criftenden Makes
Things Interesting for
the Defendant.
A MUCH MARRIED MAN.
Lillian's Alleged Betrayer Tells
of His Many Wed
dings.
HE DENIES AIL HER CHARGES.
The Millionaire Hotel and Horse Man
Says Miss Ashley Successfully
Resisted His Blandishments.
E. J. Baldwin's troubles commenced
yesterday afternoon, when Miss Ashley's
attorney began probine into the liasons of
the man of luck. During the forenoon
THE AGED DEFENDANT ON THE WITNESS-STAND.
Baldwin found all extremely agreeable.
His counsel held the reins, and they drove
the case in pleasant ways for the defend
ant. One by one Henry E. Highton re
counted tbe allegations of the plaintiff
and her witnesses, and Baldwin speci
fically and generally denied everything.
Little more than monosyliablic nega
tives were required by him, and only oc
casionally he threw in a few words of ex
planation or extra vehement denial. Such
occasions were when reference was made
to Miss Ashley having referred to him as
"papa." Baldwin didn't like the idea
that his relations to tbe frail Lillian had
ever been paternal, and at every such ref
erence he waxed eloquent in denial.
The defendant was shown a number of
letters, which have heretofore been pub
lished, and he was requested to explain
certain references in them. One of these
was the one wherein he said he had for
gotten her last name, as she always signed
her letters L. A. A. The witness said he
nad written this simply as an excuse for
not writing. He explained a statement in
one of his letters, to tne effect that he had
been short of cash atl winter, ap an excuse
for not sending her money to go to school.
"She asked me to give her money to go
to school with," he said, "and I told ber I
would see. I never made any promise."
While Baldwin was describing his visit
to Miss Ashley's room at the Baldwin she
laid her head on a table and sobbed bit
terly. By afternoon she had apparently
regained her composure. Once when
Baldwin was going into the details of his
relations with Miss Ashley she laid her
head on the table, but to those nearest her
something very like a smile seemed to be
playing about her countenance.
At the afternoon session of tbe court
Baldwin was handed over to the not very
tender mercies of Attorney Critt?nden.
The latter commenced his investigation at
the genesis of the defendant's career. He
traced his steps from the date of his birth
until the opening of the present suit. Par
ticular attention was directed to Baldwin's
operations as a canal-boat proprietor at
Racine, Wis.
The searching nature of these questions
caused the defendant to exclaim testily:
"I never ran away or cheated anybody out
of anything. I'm not ashamed of it."
He referred to Newt Killip, the local
auctioneer who was then in his employ, to
prove bis statement of his integrity as a
canal man.
"Did you know a man at Los Angeles
named Gregory?" nsked Crittenden.
Highton objected successfully to the
question and Crittenden tried another
tack. He asked Baldwin if he had ever
paid a man named Gregory $5000 to testify
falsely in a suit for seduction brought
against him by Louise Wilson. An
objection to this question was also over
ruled. Crittenden persevered in attempt
ing to get the witness to answer substan
tially the same question until Judge Slack
warned him he had enough of the matter.
Baldwin's matrimonial career was then
gone into at length. It is an eventful
story In four chapters, but the continuity
of the narrative was badly marred by the
defendant's faulty memory. He couldn't
remember just where he was married the
first time. He knew it was somewhere in
South Bend, but explained that he had
never had any occasion to recollect the
exact location of tbe ceremony. He was
aiso unable to recollect within five years
of when his first wife died. His sec
ond wife. Mary Cocnran, he married
in San Francisco. He was divorced'
from her about 1874 or 1875 Bnd
didn't know wnere she was now located.
Miss Virginia Dexter was tne maiden
name of nis next helpmeet. He married
her in San Francisco also and was under
the impression her demise occcurred six
teen or seventeen years ago. It was twelve
or thirteen years ago that he married his
present wife, who was then Miss Lillie
Bennet. He was unable to tell the exact
date or even the year of the wedding.
"Where was your wife in June, 1893?"
asked Crittenden.
Baldwin said she was at 1217 California
street in this City all of that month to the
best of his knowledge.
Baldwin was then asVed in regard to
some woman with a small girl whom he
was alleged to have been traveling with as
his wife and her sister. He denied that
there ever were any such characters, but
admitted that he had pointed out to Miss
Ashley at the St. Louis racecourse a little
pirl whom he described as his wife's sister.
"I never saw the little girl before," he de
clared, "and the statement was absolutely
untrue."
The witness was questioned at length in
regard to his interview with Miss Ashley
at that time. The trend of the questions
was to show that Baldwin had taken Miss
Ashley into the grand stand and had there
had a conversation with her in the pres
ence of Anderson, a former employe. This
Baldwin denied. He said his conversation
with Miss Ashley occurred in front of the
clubhhouse and did not occupy more than
fifteen minutes. He asked Miss Ashley
what she was doing there and she said she
had telegraphed for money and he had
failed to send it. She wanted funds where
with to go to Boston. Baldwin gave her
$40.
The trip to Hotel Coronado was next ex
ploited. Lillian's attorney was particu
larly eager to know at whose instance the
plaintiff was registered as Baldwin's
daughter. The defendant said the matter
had been talked over between them and
they had agreed that was the better way.
"At 66 years of age, proprietor of one of
the largest hotels in the City, you went to
one of the most respectable hotels in the
State and registered yourself and this lady
f;ilÂ«ply for immoral purposes?" asked Crit
tenden, in withering tones.
Highton endeavored to shield his wit
ness with an objection, but nis Honor ae
cided the question was admissible.
Baldwin said that was what he had
done.
Several questions were asked the wit
ness in regard to his having ordered a
nurse of a liveryman at Coronado. Bald
win insisted that he had ordered it for
â¢'.M Nh Ashley."
Criitenden asked him if he was sure it
was not "my daughter" he sajd, but Bald
win was certain, because he afterward
thought he had made a mistake in using
her name. Incidentally, Baldwin re
marked that he didn't wish her to go
riding that day, anyway. He didn't
think she looked well on a horse, and be
sides it was Sunday.
On closer questioning, however, he had
j some doubts as to whether it was Sunday,
but his faith in Lillian's poor appearance
as an equestrienne could not be shaken.
When adjournment was had for the day
Crittenden had revÂ«rted to the question as
to whose was the suggestion that Miss
Ashley pass as Baldwin's daughter. He
was endeavoring to show by letters that
Baldwin suggested such a course before
Lillian arrived in California. The case
will be continued this mornine.
MRS, STANTON WINS.
Judge Morrow Decides That She Did
Not Infringe on Dr. Simmt'
Copyright.
Judge Morrow, acting as Circuit Judge,
rendered a decision yesterday in the case
of Dr. Joseph Simms against Mary O.
Stanton, Frank M. Pixley and the San
Francisco News Company for infringement
on certain copyrights.
It appears that in 1872-73 Simms wrote
two books on physiognomy, and in 1879
Mrs. Stanton issued similar publications.
Six momhs ago Simms instituted suit
against Mrs. Stanton and others claiming
that they were literary pirates. The doc
tor asked for an injunction against further
infringement and incidentally demanded
several thousand dollars' damages. Judge
Morrow, in his decision, covered twenty
six typewritten pages, going carefully
over the more recent copyright decisions.
In conclusion he said:
It is my opinion that while the respondent
did consult and use complainant's works she
has not drawn from them to a substantial de
gree; that, such utility as she did make may
properly come within the designation of fair
use; that as to other features of these rival
works common to all of the works of that char
acter she obtained these from other sources
than complainant's works and to which the
latter had no copyright; in other words, I am
not satisfied that respondent's literary efforts
are not the result for the most part of her own
independent thought and studies and research.
The bills will therefore be dismissed.
Orange Shipments.
Shipments of oranges for the season of 1895
--96 will fall about 1000 carloads short of those
of the previous year. During 1894-95, when
the season ended on August 31, there was
moved to through Eastern points 6734 loaded
cars and 1025 loads were carried to local
Pacific Coast points. Up to June 15 this year
5795 loads have gone East and 741 to local
Pacific Coast points. It is estimated that not
to exceed 200 carloads will be moved up to
August 31, thus leaving this year's shipments
about 1000 loads short of last year. This is a
better showing than expected in view of the
heavy frost that visited the southern citrus
* section early m the season.
WHY HE VOTED TO
OUST FLOURNOY.
Ex-Director Thornton Gives
His Various Rea
sons.
CONSIDERED INCAPABLE
Flournoy Said to Have Made
Himself "Personally Ob
noxious."
LOOSE METHODS ARE DISCLOSED
Expenses of Trips by Rank Officers
for Which No Vouchers
Were Kept.
The testimony of ex-Director Thornton
of the People's Bank was the interesting
feature of yesterday's session in the trial
of the Sale Deposit Company against the
officers of the bank. Thornton is by pro
fession a commercial traveler, but would
seem to have considerable knowledge of
what constitutes legal ability, for he was
willing to base his endeavors to remove
Attorney Flournoy as attorney of the
bank merely upon his opinion that Flour
noy was incompetent.
Then there were other reasons. Flour
noy had made himself "personally obnoxi
ous" to Thornton and that was the last
straw. Thornton denied that he had
voted to oust Flournoy to avoid calling in
the unpaid capital stock, although it was
common talk at the time that such was
the case. As on.c of the stockholders the
payment of the unpaid stock would be
against Thornton's interests, but that did
not cut any figure, he claimed.
M. H. Grossmeyer testified that in Janu
ary, 1894, he had demanded of General
Sheehan certain information about tbe
meetings of the directors and that the gen
eral had refused, saying that he would not
give information for Grossmeyer to use
against his management of the bank. Tbe
witness had made the request upon Shee
han at the instance of himself, the stock
holders and to some extent the Safe De
posit Company.
General Sheehan was recalled to testify
in regard to his expenses on his trip south
in the fall of 1894 to examine the bank's
property. The expense of the trip, $186 50,
represented railroad fare, hotel bills and
buggy nire. He did not have any vouch
ers for the various items and, so far as he
remembered, did not make any itemized
account of his expenses upon his return.
Similar trips made by himself. General
Thornton and colonel Stone were also in
quired into.
I. L. Merrill testified that he also had
made a demand upon General Sheehan in
January, 1895, for an itemized account of
the general's expenses on his various trips
but iiad failed to get it.
General Sheehan was questioned in
regard to tbe attorneys' fees paid out by
i him. From May 1, 1894, to January 14,
1895, he had paid out in the neighborhood
of $7500, which be believed was reasonable.
During that time he bad also paid f3339 50
to employes. During this period the
depositors had not received any money
from the bank. Sheehan declared that
the employes kept by the bank during
that time were absolutely needed. He
bad employed tuem, he said, upon the
order of the Bank Commissioners, but he
had no written order from them to that
effect. All amounts he had paid Out he
honestly believed to be just. During all
the time he had been at the bead of the
banK he had never done anything with
intent to further his own interests as
against those of tbe bank's creditors.
At the opening of the afternoon session
Attorney-General Fitzgerald was put on
the stand. The Bank Commissioners re
ported to him the taiiure of the directors
of the People's Bank to comply with the
order to call in the capital stock and he
was requested to take steps in the matter.
The directors, be said, could have been
proceeded against either civilly or crimi
nally. He advised the Bank Commission
ers to order the stock to be called in.
This advice had been given at the sugges
tion of Attorney Bartnett and the Attor
ney-General thought it the best course, be
cause it would not require any court pro
ceedings. A protracted argument here
ensued between the opposing counsel rela
tive to the admission of the following let
ter from Bank Commissioner Magee to the
Attorney-General, whicn Judge Seawell
finally refused to admit:
Office of "i
Board of Bank Commissioners, I
530 California Street. f.
San Francisco, Oal.. May 2S, 1896. J
ITcm. M*. F. Eitzgtrald, Attonuy-General, San
Francisco, Cal.âr Dkar Sir: Wnercas the Board
of Bank Commissioners, under section 11 of the
bank act, have the general supervision of all
banks in liquidation; and by virtue of such
authority tho People's Home Savings Bank,
being insolvent and in liquidation, is sub
ject to and under control of the commission;
and by further provision of law authority is
invested in any one or more of the commis
sion at any time during the liquidation of
said bank to petition the court to remove any
or all the board ot directors, if in the opinion
of any one of said commission evidence of
fraud", malversation, criminal carelessness or
negligence is found to exist, and that any of
them are not the proper persons to be entrust
ed with the closing of the affairs and business
of the corporation in the interest of the depos
itors, creditors and stockholders thereof;
And whereas, it appears and is the opinion
of one of the Commissioners (your corre
spondent) that some of the allegations in the
complaintNo. 45210 filed in the case, "The
People of the State of California, the com
plaint of W. H. Knight etal., plaintiffs, vs.
People's Home Savings Bank, defendants; Cali
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company,
plaintiffs, vs. S. K. Thornton et al., de
fendants," as alleged therein are true;
And that the affairs and business of such
corporation are not being closed with such
dispatch and interest as might be done and as
the law provides shall be done in the interest
of all parties concerned;
That in my opinion it would be for the in
terests of said bank to form a new directory,
and to that end submit the matter to you for
your consideration. Very respectfully,"
H. W. Magee, Bank Commissioner.
A. F. Johns was wanted atthis junctuie,
but wae not present. Deputy Sheriff
Richardson swore he had served a subpena
upon him, and, upon Attorney Bart
nett's application, Judge Seawell ordered
an attachment to be issued for Johns'
arrest.
S. K. Thornton, who was one of the
directors of tbe bank, took the stand.
He was a director at the time of the re
moval of Attorney Flournoy and had
favored his removal. He had also spoken
of the matter to N. P. Taylor, an old
friend of his, who had just been elected to
the board of directors. He had not told
Taylor that a petition of over 2000 de
positors, including the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company, representing
claims of over $727,000, had 'been pre
sented asking for the continuation of
Flournoy as attorney.
Thornton declared that he believed the
reason given at the time for the removal
of Flournoy.
Thornton had at first opposed the call
ing in of the capital stock, but had later
lavored it. His change of attitude, he
declared, bad been 'due to a change of
mind in regard to what his duty was. He
had not done so because of any threat of
the Attorney-General to bring suit to re
move the board of directors unless they
called in the stock.
Thornton had made trips examininÃ
bank property. On several trips he had
incurred considerable expense, but had
received nothing from the banks. Later,
when a resolution of the board of directors
requested him to return some $45 which
be had received previously for attending
meetings of the board, he had refused to
on the grounds that he had incurred more
than twice that much expense on his trips
for tbe bank.
Thornton had worked for Flournoy s re
moval, he said, not as the result of a con
spiracy to prevent the calling in of the
capital stock, but because he thought
Flournoy incompetent. Flournoy, he de
clared, had made himself personally ob
noxious to Thornton and other directors,
and often refused to recognize them when
he passed them by. Thornton had also
taken exception to Flournoy's legal ad
vice upon various occasions. Further
more, Flournoy hid disobeyed the board
of directors, and had declared beforehand
that he would not obey them.
A. F. Johns, for whom an attachment
had been issued, drifted in a few minutes
after the order of Judge Seawell tiad been
made. At the conclusion of Thornton 8
testimony he was put on the stand to tell
of his connection with the collection from
the bank of an assessment pressed by the
Kings River Reclamation District.
Johns had acted as a*broker in the mat
ter, having got the claim for Judge Den
son, the agent of the district. Johns had
told Watt that he was negotiating with
Judge Denson and had also told Watt if
there was any discount in the matter he
(Johns) wanted it.
At the conclusion of to-day's session
Judge Seawell announced that he would
give Monday and Tuesday of next week
for the tr;al before taking his summer va
cation. Attorney Bartnett has only three
more witnesses and as Judge Carpenter
promises a very weak defense it is prob
able that by Tuesday night the evidence
will be all* in. To expedite matters the
trial will be taken up at half pa*t 9 in
stead of 10 o'clock on Monday morning.

has, at a general rule, no one to blame for
it but himself. He may be silently brood-
ing over some secret trouble that destroys
conjugal love, that tends to separate hus-
band and wife. Or his liver may be torpid
and inactive, which not infrequently pro-
duces constipation, biliousness, and at times
perhaps a melancholy condition of the
mind. Or he may be dyspeptic, his diges-
tion greatly impaired if not almost entirely
destroyed, as is sometimes so. by chronio
catarrh. Or a terrible syphilitic disease
may be working its way through his sys-

ADII I All E - GRILLON,
un I LLD N a safe AiasM?*HISTORY OF THE
PHÅNIC CLUB
Its Grand Appearance in
the Recent Ratifi
cation.
CURRY AN ORGANIZER.
By His Magnetism He Rises
Into Power and Promi
nence.
OTHER ABLE ASSISTANTS.
The. Executive Officers Generally Sus
tained by the Club Mem
bers.
Thus? of our citizens who -watched the
Republican procession as it passed up
Market street last Saturday night were
impressed with the Bplendid appearance
The Originator (C. F. Curry) and the Principal Officers of the Phoenix Republican Club, Organized in
1890 and Now Kindled Into Activity for the Campaign of 1896.
of the Phoenix Club as that body of men
marched four abreast behind a band of
music which discoursed patriotic airs.
The Phoenix Club in some sense is very
much like the fabulous bird from which it
derives its name.
It has, aince its origin, risen up with
that spontaneity accredited to the bird of
mythology. Within a few weeks the
Phoenix Club assumed shape and be
came one of the living forces about to ex
ercise its power and influence in the com
ing campaign.
In 1890 the Phoenix Club first made its
appearance as a political factor in the
Republican ranks. Its creation is due to
Charles Forrest Curry, a young man, a
native of this City, and one of those en
dowed with the qualities of a leader.
Mr. Curry believes in the principles of
the Republican party, and with this be
lief there is no such thing as shaking
his loyalty to the party or the party
leaders.
The qualities possessed by this young
man brought bim to the front with
his youthful friends and they urged
his nomination before the leaders of the
party for the office of Recorder in 1886.
But* the tden leader, W. T. Higgins,
thought him too young for such a
responsible office as that of Recorder
for a big city iike San Francisco. But
he did yield to the wishes of the party
and permitted him to be nominated for
thÂ« Assembly for the then Thirty-sixth
District.
This was looked upon as an attempt
to shelve the rising young man's politi
cal ambition, from the fact that the
Thirty-sixth Assembly District at that
time was Democratic by a large ma
jority and the idea of nominating a school
boy for the Assembly from that district
was considered a huge joke by the Demo
crats.
But when the votes were counted and
it was found that young Curry bad been
elected by a sweeping majority over his
Democratic opponent the laugh was on
tue other side. Even good - natured
Bill Higgins admitted his astonishment
and coniessed that he had made a mistake
in estimating the caliber of young Curry
nnd the propelling power of las Inends,
foremost among whom is his chief deputy,
Harry Piperâ also one of the bright young
men of San Francisco.
The record made by this young man in
the session of the Legislature of 1887 was
not only brought to the notice of the local
politicians In this City but gave Him a
State reputation whicii was recognized by
General Sam ttackua when President Har
rison appointed him Postmaster of this
City. He placed Mr. Curry in charge
of that very important branch station
near the new City Hall. At the Repub
lican State Convention of 1694 he had the
nomination for Clerk of the Supreme
Court within his grasp, but at the re
quest of some of his friends he permitted
another to get it.
When the principal convention assem
bled in San Francisco a few months later
he was offered the nomination for County
Clerk, which he accepted, and he was
ejected by a handsome majority.
This otfi.-e he haÃ filled and" conducted
with his usual ability. Besides this he has
turned more money into the City treasury
during his term as County Clerk" than any
of his predecessors.
Such is the character and political stand
ing of the founder of the Phoenix Republi
can Club.
Yet, however able a man may be, he
cannot form a club. To do this he-must
have men, and those men must, in order to
succeed, be in perfect accord with their
principal. Such were the men who
associated themselves with this young
leader. Among them may be mentioned:
fciX-Connrressman John T. Cutting, ex-
Harbor Commissioner C. O. Alexander, ex-
State senator and ex-District Attorney J.
N. E. Wilson, J. C. Quimi, Collector of In
ternal Revenue, Dr. J. H. Healy, Superin

Whiie some of the old boys have dropped
out of active club politics new blood" has
been infused into the club in the per
son of Colonel T. V. Eddy, WOO i* a
born orator. Its secretary, Andy W.
Branch, besidas being a first-class secre
tary, is an orator of no mean ability, as is
shown by his being sent out by the Re
publican State Central Committee to
speak on the stump for four successive
campaigns.
Secretary Branch studied law in the
office of M". If. Estee and was admitted to
practicb by the Supreme Court. In his
capacity of secretary he acquitted himself
to the honor of his friends and his own
credit in the Legislature for three sessions.
His last experience in this line was with
the municipal convention two years ago
in this City.
The treasurer of the Phoenix Club
is P. E. McCarthy, for years con
nected with the business office of a morn
ing Republican contemporary, but now
engaged in the insurance business.
There are others whose services are
equally important in the management of
a successful club. These are tue several
committees:
The executive committee with its chair- I
man, M. H. Smith, comprises Thomas
McDermott, \V. E. Bates, A. B. Turner, I.
Schwartz, M. 8. Harloe, J. H. Healy, I.
D. Hart and E. C. Paimieri. Under these
auspices the club will make no such thing
as a failure in its task of assisting in the
campaign.
The members of the finance committee
are: D. K. Mullen, M. \N elch, E. M. I
Buckley, F. Haicerman, J. B. Cam obeli, A.
Delatori, Ed Holland and George Bur.zini.
For permanent organization R. R. Duck
worth, E. C. Paimieri and I. D. Hart are
authorized to act as a committee.
The headquarters of the Phoenix Club
are located at Scottish Hall on Larkin
street, opposite the south end of the City
Hall, where weakly meetings will be he!d
on Tuesday nights from now until the
election next November.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1896.
MR. RAINEY IS A
VERY BUSY BOSS,
He Is After the Junta's
Compaign Committee
â¢ Now.
ALARMED BY HIS POWER
He Is Expected to Force a Meet
ing of the General Com
mittee Soon.
FIGURING ON REORGANIZATION
How the Rainey - Daggett â¢ Lanigan
Combine Captured the State CenÂ«
tral Comnr.tteemen.
ThÂ« condition of the Junta is critical
just now, with Rainey and Lanigan act
ively feeding 011 its insidesaud the organi-
zation is full of alarm and wonder at what
may happen pretty soon.
Having secured control of a majority of
the general committee through the re
cent partnership with Lanigan, Rainey is
i now straining every nerve to capture the
I campaign committee of twenty, whifch was
supposed to be absolutely Rainey-proof
when it was appointed by Chairman Sulli
van. Eddie Greaney and other able lieu
tenants are manipulating every. lnfluence
that can be brought to bear on members
of the committee. The Raineyites claim
to surely have seven of the. committee and
four more are needed. '
It is understood throughout the organi
zation thnt if the Rainey-Daggett-Lani
gan combination can capture the campaign
committee, which was endowed with ab
solute powers by their enemies, they will
simply assume direction of things and let
the machine stand as it is. It would be
more politic and arouse less comment and
opposition to thus gently slip into con
trol without making any revolutionary
disturbance.
But if the capture of the campaign com
mittee is not accomplished soon the Rainey-
Lanigan programme is to call a meet
ing oi the general committee, amend the
constitution so as to do away with the
campaign committee and substitute some
neve committee, which they can create
themselves.
So there is a general expectation that
within a week or two Chairman Sullivan
will receive a petition for a meeting signed
by tifty members of the general commit
tee, which, under the constitution, will
force a meeting. Any move of that sort
will precipitate the fierce battle which is
bound to come, if there is any sustained
effort to keep the Junta machine going,
and that battle will result in the route
of McNab, Sullivan, Hassett, Popper,
Braunhart, Hughes and the reinor lights
of the "decent" element which have
sought to get control of the local party.
No definite moves toward a reorganiza
tion of the party which will unite it have
yet appeared, but reorganization is in the
local Democratic air, and both factions
iire anticipating it and putting themselves
in position to win as much as possible of
the new machine.
Whenever and however this reorganiza
tion comes the Buckleyites and the
Raineyites will easily agree in roost dis
tricts on a programme tnaf will leave
McNab, Braunhart, Popper, Sullivan,
Hassett, Hughes and their kind out in the
cold alone. Reorganization must come
through a primary to which both fac ions
will agree to submit, and at a fair primary
the gentlemen mentioned will have about
as much chance to elect anybody or be
elected themselves to the new county
committee as to be elected President of
th-- Dniten States. The practical district
politician on both sides agree on this
feature oi the programme.
The way the Rainey-Lanigan combina
tion captured the State Central Commit
teemen from San Francisco is an exponent
of the situation in the Junta. Before the
State Convention the McNab element was
sure of its State Central Committeemen
and conceded three members of the com
mittee to Rainey, Dageett and Lanigan,
with two or three more doubtful. When
the eighteen State Central Committeemen
were chosen the "decent" element was
found to have three and two are doubtful-
This result was largely due to Mr. Lani
gan,'who made the State Central Commit
tee his especial business at Sacramento.
The combination with Lanigan was made
primarily with a view to keeping State
Central Committeemen out of the hands
of the MuNaO element. Lanigan had the
balance of power in several districts and
Rainey thought it was better toilet Lani
gan have some plums than to let them fall
into the hands of the enemy.
So it was that Max Popper was beaten
in the Thirty-sixth District and E. P.
Mogan, the Police Court clerk and close
friend of Lanigan, elected. In this dis
trict the Rainey-Lanigan delegates lacked
one of a majority, and that ono was se
cured through tue influence of T. J.
Clunie with one of the delegates. Popper
had gone out to fight Clunie for the Con
gressional nomination two weeks before
and all at once it came Clunie's way to
get bact at Popper by accomplishing his
defeat for the State Central Committee.
The Rainey-Lanigan victory in this
field was the more striking from the fact
that the "inside," which named fifty-three
delegates at large, played what they
thought was a "cinch" Dy arbitrarily ap
portioning these delegates at large among
the districts so as to make needed major
ities in the district delegations secure.
But after all the sure-thing work of the
McNab element they were routed by the
clever work of people who do politics as
practical politics should be done.
Now the Raineyites figure that if it
should happen that the State Central Com
mittee should try to take a hand in the
local situation they will have a good-sized
bunch of friends in ihe committee. The
Buckleyites are likewise counting on
friends from Los Angeles, Orange, Solano,
Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and other counties,
and if the Raineyites and Buckleyites come
to any agreement about dividing things
they will be in a position to get about
what they want.
The reorganization of 1896 will be a
wholly different affair from that of 1892.
WERE QUIETLY WEDDED,
Miss Harper United to the Eld
est Son of Judge W. T.
Wallace
Miss Patterson and Sidney Alison,
the Popular Insurance Man,
Quietly Married
Richard Wallace, eldest son of Judge
and Mrs. William T. Wallace, and Miss
Jeanette Harper, prominently connected
with the publ c schools of this City, were
married Wednesday evening at the resi
dence of the bride's aunt, Mrs. S. Greer,
322 Hyde street. Although no formal an
nouncement of the engagement of the
happy couple was made, the fact of the
marriage leaked out and society- was more
than usually interested in the event.
No elaborate preparations were made
for the happy affair, which was character
ized by simplicity and an entire absence
of all ostentation and formality.
In the parlor where the ceremony was
performed roses, palms and cordons of
Bmilax gave to the apartment a festive ap
pearance. In the bay-window swung a
handsome marriage bell, and it was here
the happy couple stood while Rev. Dr. I
Hemphill read the marriage ceremony
that made them man and wife.
Miss Sarah Harper, the bride's sister,
was maid cf honor. Judge Coffey of
ficiated as best man and ex-Supervisor
Burling, an old lriend of the Harpers,
gave the bride inio the Keeping of the
groom.
Carrie Purcell, Mildred Nelson and
Ruby Canham, three little pupils of the
bride, led the bridal procession, strewing
flowers along the path of the newly
wedded couple.
The bride, who is a tall and handsome
brunette, loosed extremely lovely in her
elegant bridal gown. It was fashioned of
cream brocaded satin and trimmed with
old point lace, the gift of the bride's aunt.
The bridal veil was fastened to the coiffure
by a spray of orange blossoms and a sun
burst of diamonds and pearls, the gift of
the groom.
Miss Harper, the bride's sister, wore a
very elegant gown of pink satin. The
corsage and jupe were elaDorately trimmed
with point applique.
Only the immediate relatives of both the
contracting parties and a limited number j
of intimate friends, in all about thirty
guests, witnessed the ceremony.
Mr. avid Mrs. Wallace will left yesterday
for an extensive bridal tour that will em
brace a stay at Monterey and a visit to the
Var'ous fashionable resorts.
Miss Lizzie Patterson, youngest daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. James Patterson, and
Sydney Allison of the New England Lite
Insurance Company were quietly married
Wednesday at the residence of the oride's
parents, iH'22 Greenwich street, Rev. Dt
Freedereich of the Fourth Congregational
Church officiating. The decorations of
the home were simple and artistic. No
set arrangement was adhered to. Choice !
blossoms filled- bowls and vases, and ferns \
and smllax formed a pretty background.
The bride was attended by her sister,
Miss Maymee Patterson, who officiated as
maid of honor, and Drew Harrigan was
best man.
The bridal gown was of white silk and
trimmed with knuts of white satin ribbon
and lace.
Miss Pattison, the maid of honor, wore !
a pretty gown of pale green silk, trimmed I
with lace.
Only the immediate relatives of he con
tracting parties witnessed the c >remony
and partook of the bridal supper which
followed.
Mr. and Mrs. Allison left yesterday morn
ing on a bridal tour, keeping their destina
tion a profound secret On their return
they will occupy their new home on
Tuylor street.
NEWER CITY HALL.
The North End Improvement Associa
tion Katify the Awarding of
the Plan*.
A meeting of the North End and
Kearny-street Improvement Association
took place at the old Y. M. C. A. Hall on
Butter street last evening. The object of
the meeting was to ratify the action of
the Board of Supervisors in awarding the
plans of the new municipal building to be
erected on the 9ite of the old City Hall.
Chairman John Shirley of the associa
tion called the gathering to order and
stated that this was an assemblage of
North Kearny-street business men, whose
object was to turn the tide of progress and
prosperity bacK to its old starting point.
He referred to the proposed erection of
the new building, which is to cost $300,000,
which, he said, will cause a change in the
North End.
He spoke of the excellent work of Su
pervisors Wagner and Benjamin in getting
the appropriation for the great building.
Both of the Supervisors were present and
addressed the meeting.
George D. Shadbufne said that Market
street, with its lofty values and towering
rents, would not always stand trie strain
ana that capitalists were even now buy
ing up the depreciated property along
Kearny street. Real estate, he said, had
increased in value in the North End fully
one-third since it became known that the
new municipal building was to be erected.
Eunene Dupray, Supervisor Hirsh and
others addressed the meeting in the same
tenor, and predicted that within a year
the new building would be finished.
The following resolutions were unani
mously adopted : .
Whereas, The plans and specification! lor
the building of the new municipal building on
the Old City Hall site having been finally
awarded to Architects Shea & Shea, at the last
meeting of the Board of Supervisors, and,
whereas the awarding of the said plans and
specifications will be of incalcutble value not
only to the property-owners, business men and
residents of this sectiou of the City, but to the
labor: ne men, artisans and mechanics as well;
therefore, be it
Resolved, That the North End and Kearny
street Improvement Association, in public
meeting assembled at "i oung Men's Christian
Association Hal!, on Thursday evening, Jttne
25, 1896, speaking for its members in par
ticular aud its 6000 FUpporters in general, do
hereby most sincerely express their heartfelt^
thanks to the members of the Board of Super
visors, who by their voles caused the deadlock
in the board to be broken and the awarding of
tbe plans which will undoubtedly create a re
vival of business and a better feeling among
the people interested and doiug business in
the north end.
Resolved, That this association desires to
most emphatically express its earnest and sin
cere thanks to Supervisors Edward L. Wagner
and C. E. Benjamin in particular, and also to
Sunervisois King, Scully, Hirsoh, Dimond
and Hobbs, for their loyal and unselfish devo
tion on our behalf; and oe It
Resolved, That thisassociation hereby pledges
it support and influence to these Supervisors
for any position or emolument to which they
may aspire irrespective of our individual
politics.
Resolved, That Supervisors Wagner and Ben
jamin be hereby elected honorary members,
and the secretary of this association is hereby
instructed to send an expression of our
thanks to the above-named Supervisors.
Resolved, That this association sorely depre
cates the unmanly and treacherous action of
Supervisor Taylor in deserting our cause at
a most critical time, which ho did by leaving
the board room while the resolution awaraiug
the plans were being read.
Saohud, Tiiat his action was absolutely iu
excusab'.e, and this association severely con
demns the same.
President Shirley then appointed the fol
lowing judiciary committee to supervise
i he affairs of the association: George D.
Shadborue, Daniel Rogers, W. D. Bodti3h.
Hit With a Hammer.
William Walker, a boy employed at the Rls

CANNED AND DKIED FRUITS.
How the Season of 1896 Looks at the
Opening.
The Cutting Packing Company's circular says of
canned and dried fruits:
CANNKD FRUITSâ a tricots. The condition
of the 'crop is about the name as at out last ad
vices, excepting that the , extreme hot, dry
weather has caused a great failing and consequent
reduction in quantity, also a great detriment to
the quality, many orchards showing 'the fruit
shriveled and of small size, the heat evidently ar
resting the full development; this will militate
against the general good quality of the crop.
Moorparks esueclally are dropping more than
Koyals. The low opening prices on dried will
work against high prices for canning stocK, but as
the general quality of the latter for the season is
"off" good stock for extra goods will command a
higher price than in 1896. while ordinary stock
may on the coutrary and probably will be fur
nished at less.
PearsâThe critical period on these has practi
cally passed, and the prospect for a large crop
was" never better. We are â til! uncertain, how
ever, as to the price for canning stock, as the de
mand for Eastern shipment promises to be very
heavy, there being extra facilities for cheap and
rapid transportation over piec'din!; .ears, and it
Is hence altogether uncertain what prices will rule.
An unpromising feature of the crop is thÂ« heavy
proportion of small fruit, making high grades and
quality scarce.
Fi.vmsâ our previous advices are confirmed as
to the crop being badly damaged, of uncertain
quality and quite short: in fact the prospect is
even poorer than a month since.
Pkachksâ Previous advices are confirmed ex
cept as to the value of clings for canning stock,
which will doubtless tie fully 50 per cent over that
of '95 and much heavier than was anticipated.
The large Eastern crop will Influence largely the
pack of frees In this Mate, and we believe the de
mand will run largely for clings: anyhow, there
does not. seem to be tiny special encouragement to
pack the former, when so-called California peaches,
under a California label, printed in .Baltimore are
offered freely by enterprising packers from the
laiteroity. of a claimed standard quality, at 9J
cents tor 3-tb cans f. o. b. Baltimore. :"â 
Small Fruits â Strawberries. raspberries,
blackberries, currants and gooseberries are all very
short In quantity, although of good quality. Few
contracts have been made as yet for these varie
ties. It is not probable that prices will rule as
low as in '95.
Chkbriesâ The packing is practically over and
probably not over one-third of that of any of thÂ»
last rive years. Prices for canning stock have cd
vanced constantly during the month. It is safe to
say that 'lie small canned stock will go out at
packers' figures. The crop in the State as a whoie
is in better condition than could have been ex
pected a few months since, and aside from the
damage due to the extreme hut and dry weather
of the past three weeks, is much Improved gener
ally.
DRIED fruits-
Apricotsâ Are now being dried in some sec
tions. A few carloads have gone forward at 7%
@8c net to growers for rirst shipments,.7c to the
growers for a few days' later shipment. The out
put will not exceed 350 cars, with practically no
Carry -over of 1 895 crop, against 200 to 250 cars
last year, with a carry-over of about 75 cars from
1894. It is safe to assume that present prices will
be maintained. Pr ces a year ago ranged from
7% to 9c, and in 1894, withauou'tputof 1100 cars.
6 io7c. â¢
PeachesâWill probably be in somewhat lighter
â npnly than last year; drying will not begin until
next month.
Pei'sks-In some sections will be considerably
short of last year, but in other sections devoted
more ex'enMvely to prunes the crop will exceed
last year's, so that barring accidents to the crop
before! drying season, the output of the state
will be somewhat larger than in 1895.
RaisinsâThere is not to exceed rive to ten cars
lefc in the State, all of which will be required for
local trade. The comi>-.<: crop will be about 2500
carloads, against about 4000 cÂ»rs last year.

In sugar saved the stock market from being one
the dullest on record. The transactions in sugar
aggregated 107,000 shares. Total sales to-day
were 179,700 shares. The market openrd with a
fair degree or strength, but the traders, who had
the market practically to themselves, were bear
ishly inclined and when sugar :-galn started on he
down track they hammered the list. Despite their
efforts, however, comparatively little impression
was made upon prices, the decline at the lowest
varying from 14 to % per cent, outside of Manhat
tan, which declined 1%. During the afternoon
there was a rally of 3Â£ on Manhattan, and leading
stocks like the Grangers, Lou sville and Nashville â 
and Western Union recovered ViÂ®Vt percent.
Tho coal shares were notably firm, ami especially
for Jersey Central and Delaware and .Hudson, :
which moved up 1%@2% points 10 107ya@ 1
127% respectively on very light offerings. Gen
eral electric and Hocking Coal were also strong.
All the movements noted, however, fell into in
significance when' contrasted with the striking
fluctuation and remarkable . activity in sugar.
This stock, after opening Vb higher at lis'/2.
declined rapidly to 113. Subsequently, on the
announcement that certain brands of refined sugar
had been advanced 1-16, the stock got back to
114Vs, but under a renewed pressure it fell to
113 and closed at 1133 3.
The market closed barely steady. Net changes
show losses of yÂ«C4 I /4 per cent. Jersey Central
and Reading, scored gains' of. '<! per cent, while

uninteresting And unattractive character. The
main causes of the weakness were apparently the
: especially fine weather for harvesting and the
! good outlook for crops in general. The Cincinnati
I Price Current contributed to the disappointment
i Dy reporting a maintained promise for wheat
during the past week. ' v *
I North western arrivals were 449 cars, against
| 615 last Thursday and 146 a year ago Chicago
had 13 curs and Inspected out 16.300 bushels.
Liverpool cables were quiet and steady, an 1 Con
tinental markets were Irregular. Export Clear
ances were quite liberal at 443,760 bushels, the
posting of the figures producing a steadier tone
and causing prices t o rally sliehtly. September
i wheat opened from 67c to 57ysC, so'll between
| 565/ 8 c and 57 1 /B V4C, closing at 56%, s/g@34c
| under yesterday. Estimated receipts tor to-mor
! row 20 cars.
j CORNâ Depreciated in value through the weak
ness extended by wheat, and because the situation
! presented . nothing on which buyers could con
i vince themselves that purchases promised profita
i ble returns. The Cincinnati Price Current re
i ported crop conditions of corn good. Receipts
| were 385 cars Â«nd 142,643 bushels were with
drawn from store. Liverpool cables were quiet
and steady. Export clearances aggregated 194,
--045 bushels. September corn opened at 28 /sic
i declined to 2814 c, closing at 283/ B e, Vie under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 450
I cars. â 
; OATSâ Were really the most active deal on the
I floor. The liquidation which nas been in Oio^ress
' for some time past was continued. Many sales on
stop loss orders were made, ane few peo >le, if any,
I evinced a desire to possess the grain. The C.ncin-
I nati Price Current reported the crop conditions of
: oats a3 excellent. Receipts were good at 316 cars.
and 8M..6U bushels were taken from store. Ex-
I port clearances were large at 220,521 bushels.

PROVISIONSâ The market for product did not
differ materially from those of the grains. Id ad

surr undlng it the further depressing Influence of
a declining bog market made itseli felt. At the

but one arrival from' any â¢'- Colonial port, viz.,
;*pr.ngburn with 399.1 tons. It Is several years
since this happenedâ one arrival in 30 days; the
reason we are all cognizant of, the continuation of
the labor troubles at the Newcastle mines. . It is
just two months since this strike commented, and
It has extended over more time already than any
one supposed at us Inciplency. Some grades of

908 Broadway, June 25. f
Mr. Daniels of 588 Thirty-third street baa
disappeared somewhere between his home
and Liverpool and his wife can find no
trace whatever of him.
The circumstances attending the drop- !
pine out of sight of Mr. Daniels are en- J
tainly mysterious and have given risen to \
many theories advanced by the neighbors j
of the distracted wife. The Daniels have j
been married but a year or two and resided '
at their present home nearly a year. They
are comparatively wealthy and Mr. Dan
iels had no profession, but was generally
understood to be a stockbroker, He was
always well supplied with money, paid \
his obligations where he went, and he and !
bis handsome wife led a quiet life, receiv- :
ing but few friends.
Nearly three weeks aeo Mr, Daniels told
his wife he had decided to make a trip to i
Liverpool, England, for the benefit of his j
lualtb. He went off and has not been j
heard of, neither has he arrived at his dcs- I
tination nor did he ship on the steamer
on which he intended to take passage, j
Telegrams to all points have not brought J
eny news, ana if something is not re- I
ceived soon there is grave danger that the
young wife's reason may be impaired. For
several days she has been bordering on
Lysterics and cared for by friends.
Mrs. Daniels has confided her story to ;
several friends and it bears some resem- j
blance to a mystery tale of which the j
chief chapter is left to the imagination.
'When he first spoke about going off," I
said Mrs. Daniels, "I intended to go with J
him, but he was in too much haste to j
allow of my preparing for such a journey.
When he left me I had but 80 cents in my
pane, and he was to send me money in a I
couple of days. He was to have written to '
me from various places, but I have not j
received any money or any letter. He !
used to deal in stocks, and was always
well supplied with money, and l never \
knew what it was to be short. Our mar- j
ried life has always been happy and pleas- j
ant, And I fear that my husband must
have been taken sick or met with some j
accident and is somewhere where he is not j
known. He was very jolly when he left, j
and I expected to receive letters from him i
all along the route of bis journey. The j
steamer on which he was to cross the i
Atlantic has arrived at Liverpool, and he
was not a passenger. I am at a loss to
explain the strange circumstance."
This afternoon the friends of Mrs. Dan
iels had to carry her meals, as she was
perfectly destitute. She is but 25 years of
age and has confided to her friends the
fear that she may never meet her husband
again. ________________
APPEAL OF BLIND MEN,
Ohject to Being Classed With
Chinese Laborers and
Convicts.
The Sightless Workers Who Ask the
State Labor Commissioner for
Protection.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, June 25. \
The blind broomniakers are aggrieved.
A few weeks ago a petition was addressed j
to Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald by fifty j
representatives of the broommaking in- |
dustry of San Francisco, asking for relief, j
The petition was printed in full in The
Call of June 9. Since that time the blind
workers in the Horns for Adult Blind in j
North Oakland have held several informal ;
meetings, and to-day they prepared a pc- j
tition to the Labor Commissioner, giving j
their view of the situation.
"We feel that we are likely to suffer \
from the misrepresentations made in the i
petition," said E. B. Taylor, who was dele- i
gated to visit the Oakland office of The
Call, "and we are forced to defend our
selves."
The petition contains the following:
Heretofore we could compete with other
manufacturers oniy in the poorer class of j
brooms. In these there is no profit. But un- !
der the guidance of sight and skill we have j
been able to place upon the market the best j
quality of brooms (in which. there is profit)
and we are very proud of it ; proud of the fact
that we stand on an equality with those arti-
Minswho have sight; proud of the fact that we
tan earn a dollar of our own ; and still more
proud that it does not cost |he State a cent.
Among the numerous orders received during
the last few months was one for 2000 dozen
best quality brooms at current prices. This
hurts the San Francisco menuraciurer and he
gets together fifty men and boys (mostly boys)
and h'imbly petition! you, as an official of the
State, to crush our manhood by taking from
us our ( mployme.u and to turn this hive of in
dustry into a Stale almshouse.
Blind workers everywhere enter more or less
Into competition with the seeing men of other
trades, and for many years industrial homes
have been establish**! in several States of this
Union and also by the governments of other
countries, and it is nowhere on record, either
here in America or in Europe, that any class
of artisans have ever appealed to the authori
ties to abolish such industries except these liity
San Frnncisco broommakers; and we venture
the assertion, sir, that the broommakers who
signed this petition were instigated to do so by
one or more of the manufacturers in San Frae
cisco, *n<l we further assert thiit no American
artisan would append his name to any petition
to destroy our industry unless forced to do so
through fear of discharge.
They claim in their petition that "the State
should protect the honest Amorican laborer In
n chance to mate a living." YYe wish to
firove to you that we are ''honest American
aborers" and that the State is only protecting
us in a chance t . make a living. We wish to
â how you that those who walk in the realm of
darkness should have the privilege of being
self-supporting and independent as well as
those who walk In the realm of light.
THEY ARE UNHAPPY.

owing to this treatment she has been com

FABIOLA'S BALANCE.
The Pprmiar Hogpital Receives a Neat
Sum as a K--.nl; of the May
Day Fete.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 25. -William R.
Davis, president of the Fabiola floral fete
i of 1896, has made a report giving the final
I result of the May day festival, which
shows a balance of $2155 55 after all bills
were paid.
In closing tho report he says:
We desire also to express our sincere thanks
to every one contributing to Vhe succeas of tho
fete, and especially to Thomas Williams and
his associates, wno so generously donated the
use of the trotting part and furnisned other
valuable assistance and suggestions, and to
every exhibitor and participant taking part in
the events of the day, and to the judges who
so kindly undertook and discharged the diffi
cult duty of awarding the prizes among the
contestants.
The board of directors of the Fabiola
Hospital Association, in acknowledging
the receipt of the report and accompanying
coin, compliments the president on his
untiring efforts, and those associated with
him, and then says:
We know that in your work, while the first
I thought wss a benefit for Ffbiola. you ever
kept in mind the larger good to Oakland, to
Central California, and your efforts were re
[ warded with a floral parade that demonstrated
i to the strangers who visited us that Alameda
j County is second to none in floral wealth, and
that her people have the refinement and cul
â¢ tivation that made it possible for them to ar
| range a floral parade wherein every carriage
i exhibited was a gem of artistic beauty. No
words could have conveyed such a lastiiig im
; pression of our matchless climate as the aoun
' dance of delicate flowers displayed on May 1,
all grown in the open air.

Mrs Boyer Wants a Divorce
Because She Married a
Blind Man.
Her Sen Thrasted a Man Who Was
Too Friendly With His
Mother.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, June 25. j
Mrs. S. A. Boyer, who waa once station
agent at Oak street, wants a divorce fr^m
her husband, who is now an Inmate of the
Blind home.
Mrs. Boyer's affairs were made public
Tuesday afternoon because of a beating of
tier son, Eugene Reeves gave a man named
Thompson on Clay street.
She was married to Thomas Boyer
about four years ago and now says
that he was blind at the time but that be
concealed the fact from her. Since the
wedding he has heco me an inmate of the
Blind Home. Stories reached Boyer about
his wife and a man named Thompson and
he called to his assistance the stepson
Robert Reeves, an able-bodied younjg man
who likes to resent an injury. This was
about two weeks ago when Mrs. Boyer was
staying at the Galindo Hotel.
Early last week Mrs. Boyer left the
hotel, telling her aon that she was going
in the country. He did not believe the
story and started out to find his mother.
He found her at a Clay-street lodging
house. Young Reeves at once informed
Mr. Boyer of his discovery and his fear,
and they both waited for developments.
Presently they saw Mrs. Boyer gome up
the stairs with Thompson. Eugene Reeves
joined the pair and there was a scene.
When seen last night Mrs. Boyer said
that as soon as she was divorced she in
tended to marry Thompson.
Now Boyer will apply for a divorce and
the case will probably hane fire for weeks,
much to the chagrin of Mrs. Boyer, who,
it is said, has arranged to marry Thomp
son next week.
"I have not lived with Boyer for several
years," she said. "He deceived me when
we were married, and as soon as I found it
out -I left him. My boy did slap Mr.
Thompson, but that is all the thing
amounted to. He is mad because I won't
marry a rich old fellow who lives near Oak
street. This man has lots of money and
my boy wants to spend some of it for him.
If I were rid of Boyer to-night I would
marry Thompson to-morrow."

I Mrs. Amanda Callotray Besting Kasy
With Two Bullets in Her
Body.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 25.â Amanda
Calloway, the colored woman who was
shot three times last night by Mary Wag
ner, is lying at the Receiving Hospital
hovering between life ana death, with
some chance of ultimately recovering
from the effects of her wounds, and yet
she may die before another day rolls
around.
Her fate depends entirely upon the com
plications which may result from the in
ternal injuries. The bullet in the arm has
been removed, but the one in the thigh
and the one in the chest are still in her
body. To probe for the latter would no
doubt produce death, so it will be allowed
to remain in the lung.

MAY INCREASE
FERRY FARES,

Ferry Rates Is In
complete.
SOME FAULTY LOGIC.
v
The Manager's Explanation Is
Partly Explained by
Mayor Davie.
NEWS FOR ME. KRUTTSCHNITT.
Need of a Thorough Investigation of
the Points Before the Railroad
Commission.
Oaklawd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, June 26. j
Mr. Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pacific
Company is not familiar with ah the facts
regarding the rate war of Oakland fer
ries. Neither he nor Mr. Clunieseem to be
aware of the fact that there are people now
crossing the bay on tickets that Co9t only
2]4 cents apiece.
Only two years have passed since John
| L. Davie and J. M. Eassett operated a com
j petitive ferry and these gentlemen read
j the general manager's reply to the Rail
j road Comm ission with great interest.
Judging by the past they consider it only
a matter of time before the fare on the Sev
enth-street road to San Francisco will be
raised to the original price of 15 cents.
"If this matter is not settled by the Rail
road Commissioners according to the
law," said Mr. Davie to-day, "there will
without doubt be a return to the old order
of things and single trips will cost 15 cents,
as they did before our opposition. That
was before Mr. Kruttscunitt's time, but
not so long ago that the people of OaKlana
have forgotten it. For some months after
our service opened up the fare on both the
creek and the Seventh-street route were
the same, namely, 15 cents. After a time
the pier route was reduced to 10 cents and
the creek route to s cents. This continued
for a time and then they were pressed so
hard that they reduced the creek route
fare to 2% cents for a single trip. While
their tickets were in circulation parties
bought up large blocks of them and are
using them to this day.
"When the opposition ceased the creek
route rate was at once raised to five cents.
The law says that when a fare is reduced
by reason of competition it cannot be
raised again except on application to the
Railroad Commission. The commission
was ignored regarding creek route fares
and it is only reasonable to suppose that
the same thing will occur in regard to the
the Seventh-street route if Mr. Krutt
schnitt's incomplete statement, is not
properly understood.
"As to tne general manager's remarks
about the cost of operating not justifying
a reduction of the Seventh-street rate that
is absurd. There is money in carrying
people across the bay for a nickel, and we
nave proved it. \VÂ« sh. uld have been do
ing it yet if the City Council at the rail
road's bidding had not refused to give us
a decent landing on this side.
"In my opinion the constitution was
framed for the purpose of dealing with
just such cases. Mr. Kruttschnitt's con
tention that there are two distinct routes
and that the "greater rate for a shorter
distance" clause does not apply in this
case cannot surely be made in good faith.
Carry out his theory and tne railroad
company has only to parallel some of the
best-payiiig portions of its route and
charge just what it pleases. Now that
this matter has been opened up the very
fullest investigation should be made by
| the commission."

Heath and Hi* Razor.
BERKELEY, Cal., June 25.â Charles
Heath, a negro bootblack, waa arrested
to-nieht and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon, having attempted to carve
the throat of Walker McEnleo with a
razor. In the effort to cut McEntee's
ju-iular vein, the razor slipped and almost
entirely severed the thumb of Heath's
own right hand.
The quarrel between Heath and McEn
tee was the result of an old feud, bad blood
having existed between the two for some
time. McEntee was passing the stand of
the bootblack when Heath struck him in
the face. A c iich followed, and Heath
was petting the orst of the fray when he
pulled a razor from his inside pocuet and
made a slash at the throat of McEntee.
His aim missed and the blow was spent on
McEntee's coat, which was cut entirely
across from left shoulder to right hip. So
tigiit a grasp did Heath have on his oppo
nent's neck that blood flowed freely from
the finger-nail marks left.
Heath assaulted and almost choked to
death Samuel Wakeham of Berkeley some
months ago.

BROKE THE FURNITURE,
William Collins, a Wenlcininded Youth,
Attacks His Mother and Creates
a Riot.
OAKLAND, Cal., June 24. â William
Collins wrecked the home of his mother
at 167 Eighth street this afternoon, at
tacked her and created such a sensa
tion that the neighborhood was thor
oughly aroused. He is a young man,
about 26, who has been weakminded for
several years, but was considered perfectly
harmless.
Without the least warning he went into
a frenzy, smashed all the windows in the
place, drove his aged mother and a sister
out of the house, smashed the stove to
smithereens and set to work to demolish
the furniture. His mother attempted to
pacify him, but he turned on her, slapping
her in the face. Before he could do her
further harm she escaped to the street,
where by this time had gathered quite a
crowd.
No one dared to enter the place until an
officer arrived, when Collins was secured
and taken to the County Jail to await ex
amination for insanity. When questioned
as to why he had become so destructive lie
said that, a fly had bit him on the face and
he wanted to kill it. Mrs. Collins said to-^
night that their lives would not be safe if
he returned, and one was anxious to have
him sent to an asylum.
AFFAIRS OUT
IN RICHMOND,
Three Improvement Clubs
at Work for the
District.
AFTER THE GRAVEYARDS
The Legislature Will Be Peti
tioned for an Anti-Cem
etery Law.
INDORSING THE CHARTER.
Richmond Wants to Use Her Own Red
Rock for the Paving of
Her Streets.
Richmond district has three improve
ment clubs all working in the interest of
the locality, and to this fact may be at
tributed in a measure the progress in that
portion of the City. They are the Richmond
District Association, the Richmond District
.Property-owners' Protective Association
and the Point Lobos Improvement Associ
ation. The Protective Association was
formed with one object and that was to
oppose the interment of bodies within the
City limits. It succeeding in getting an
ordinance passed making the sale of burial
iota unlawful. The Richmond District Im
provement Association has now taken up
the cemetery question and the two clubs
will join forces in their efforts to have the
graveyards removed. Richmond has all
the cemeteries in the City and its residents
feel that they are most especially unfor
tunate.
The Richmond District Improvement
A9so ciation held a spirited meeting
"Wednesday evening and prepared for vig
orous work in the interest of the district.
First the newly elected oificers as follows
were installed: Charles H. Hubbs, presi
dent; George Magoonis, Maurice V. Sam
uels and John T. Meinert, vice-presidents;
J. G. Maloney, secretary; S. U. Darbee,
treasurer; J. J.Slattery, sergeant-at-arms;
executive committee â John Leonard, S. U.
Darbee, J. J. Casey, J. Slattery and W. B.
Simonds.
Charles H. Hubbs is also president of
the Property-owners' Protective Associa
tion, which contains in its numbers many
of the most influential residents of the dis
trict.
One of the first questions before the
association at its Wednesday evening
meeting was the mail delivery for the lo -
caliiy. A Dranch postoffice will shortly
be established in the district and a peti
tion was ordered forwarded to Postmaster
McCoppin asking for a Sunday and night
letter collection.
The new charter received the hearty
indorsement of the association, and M. V.
Samuels and S. U. Darbee were elected j
delegates to the charter convention.
Charles Hubbs and M. V. Samuels were
elected delegates to the Board of Confed
trated Clubs.
It was unanimously adopted that the
association pledge itself to use its utmost
endeavors to enforce the ordinance di
rected against City burials. It was the
general opinion that a legislative enact
ment should be procured to meet the
cemetery question. The City burial places
out west or Thirty-tiiird avenue are con
sidered to be a menace to the locality and,
therefore, should be removed. Messrs.
Hubbs and Samuels, who are attorneys,
were appointed a committee to draft
a bill for presentation to the next Legis
lature. It will authorize the Board of
Supervisors to sell the old City cemeteries
and purchase suitable burial grounds out
side the corporate Jiinits.
J. A. Berperot, cne of the directors of
the French Benevolent Society, was made
a member of the Richmond District Asso
tion as the representative of the society.
''There is another question," said Mr.
Hubbs yesterday, "which will not down
in Richmond, and that is the question of
pavement. "We have naturally the finest
and most level streets in the City and we
want to put them in good condition. We
can do so if the Board of Supervisors will
let us, but that body holds us back and
many of our streets are sadly in need of
work. The trouble is over the rock. The
board Bays we must use the bluerock,
which is unsuitable and costly. "We have
a redrocK quarry in our midst that turns
out a material which is in every way satis
factory. In use a roadbed of this material
packs down like hardpan and lasts for
years.
"Look at Clement street, upon which
the Sutro electric road runs. It was paved
with our red rock and the big cars travel
as smoothly as though they were rolling
j on bitumen.
"It is a grievous injustice that we can
not use a cheap and excellent material for
our streets, but must pay a heavy price
for a rock that is unsuitable simply b?
cause somebody has got a 'job' through
tlie new City Hnll. One of the objects of
the Richmond District Improvement As
sociation is to use its endeavors to bring
about the repeal of the Gray Bros." rock
ordinance and work our streets in our own
way." ______________

CHARGED WITH BIGAMY.
A Former Resident of liO.rln in Trouble !
- in Shasta- County. â¢';'*:
OAKLAND, Cal., June 25.â Word has j
â been received here that G. C. Richards, a j
former resident of Lorin, has been charged j
with bigamy by his first wife, and that i
while under bonds to appear for trial next
Tuesday on that charge, he has absented
himself, until the idea ha 3 gained general !
belief that he has left to avoid further J
trouble. ,'
This, however, is denied by his friends ]
in bis lormer home at Lorin, who say. he
will be on band to prove be is innocent of
any wrong when the proper time arrives, 1
'but that meanwhile he is in San Francisco j
conferring with his attorneys and securing j
'the necessary evidence to clear himself of
the pending char.c.
, Richards .was married in Michigan
twenty-rive years ago, as far as can be
learned, and separated from his wife some,
ten years later, and as he supposed was
divorced. He married again, but his wife
soon died, hie married the third wife and '
had been living with her at Lorin until he
went to French Gulch to mine. A couple !
of months ago his wife and family joined
I him there, and everything appeared to j
be progressing nicely.
. It was at this point that Mrs. Richards ;
No. 1 appeared and claimed that he had
never been " legally separated from her. !
She even swore to a complaint charging j
i him with bigamy. He was arrested and
| taken to Redding, where he gave bonds for {
his appearance for trial. Since that time
he has not been seen by those who were
former friends.

THE WIDENING SCHEME STORY
Record of Litigation, Peculation, De
falcation, Spoliation and
Suicide.
One of the closing chapters in the his
tory of the Dupont-street widening
scheme will be recorded at the Treasurer's
office in the new City Hall next Tuesday,
June 30, when the time will expire for the
surrender of bonds, as provided for in the
act of the Legislature of 1876.
Grant avenue, extending from Market
street to Bush, was known before the
widening act was passed as Dupont street,
having been christened in honor of
Commodore Dupont of the United
States navy. a brief season it
was Known on the official records
as Fleet street, not in consequence
of the fast living of certain of its denizens,
but in honor of Mr. Strother. then Super
visor, whose front name is Fleet. This ap
pellation did not suit Frank McCoppin,
who was then a Senator from San Fran
cisco in the State Senate. He had an act
passed restoring the name Dupont, but
subsequently ihe thoroughfare was named
Grant avenue, in honor of U. S. Grant.
Ihe record of the widening scheme is
dotted with peculation, defalcation and
?u:cide. Some men were enriched, others
were impoverished and not a few swindled.
Resistance ro the measure began in the
courts twenty years ago and has since con
tinued. The example of the Dupont
street commission had much to do in caus
ing the fraraers of the constitution to in
sert a clause in the organic act abolishing
all commissions.
U.S. Tibbey, secretary of the commis
sion, was a defaulter to the extent of
$70,000. A deputy treasurer of the City,
whose Dupont-street accounts were mud
dled to cover the peculation of $5000, com
mitted suicide, and the community was
surprised when the deputy's bondsmen
paid the amount promptly without going
to the courts for release from the obliga
tion.
There is now in the municipal treasury
the sum of $37- r \OOO to be applied to the
redemption of outstanding bonds. Some
of these bonds are held by local bankers
and capitalists, others were bought for
Knslish and German investors. Tht
rating of these securities has frequently
cuanged according to adverse or favorable
court decisions. Yet money has been
gradually drawn into the treasury to meet
the principal.
During the past week frequent inquiries
have been made of Treasurer Widber con
cerning the pending off r for the surren
der of bonds. It is possible that a syndi
cate may have secured a large block of the
securities, and in order to obtain the coin
on hand may put in a low price for sur
render. The ueople in the Treasurer's
office are not prepared to make a guess at
the figures likely to be submitted. It is
put in the notice calling for proposals, that
no offer above par will be considered.
James D. Phelan, A. Sutro & Co. M. Lewis
and others are supposed to be local holders
of Dupont-street bonds. Next Tuesday
the holders will submit their figures to
the Treasurer.
BUCKLEY MAY BE SUED,
Ex-Managing Editor Henderscn
Has the Complaint All
Ready.
An Interesting Story of a Charge
Made by the Ex-Boss Against
the Journalist.
The sensational libel suit of ex-Man
aging Editor Henderson of the Examiner
against "Boss" Buckley, wnich was
nrinted in The Call a few weeks ago as
one of the possibilities of the future, is
about to be brought to an issue.
The complaint has been prepared and
the filing of the same awaits the con
venience oi the plaintiff.
Mr. Henderson has been out of the edi
torial business for several months. Since
leaving the journal with which he was
last connected he has been devoting his
time to pastoral pursuits on his ranch in
the Livermore district. There is only a
fence and a hedge between the Henderson
and Buckley ranches, but that may have
no material bearing on the pending suit
for libel.
Mr. Henderson bases his suit on an ar
ticle which was published in The Call
on trie 24ih of last December. It was a re
ported interview with Christopher Buck
ley, during the course of which Mr. .Buck
ley made certain statements concerning
Clifton E. Mayne, the Metropolitan Elec
tric Railway franchise and the managing
editor oi a morning paper. This particu
lar managing editor, so Mayne told Buck
ley, entered into a contract whereby his
paper was to back the franchise and re
ceive $12, CXX), etc.
Mr. Henderson assumes that he is the
managing editor referred to, and will sue
for damages in the sum of $25,000.
The complaint then goes on to quote the
portions of the article in The Call of De
cember 24, on which the suit is founded.
The excerpts read as follows:
Mayne was introduced to me (Buckley) in
1890 by Attorney George Perry. Mayne ex
plained.his railway franchise and wanted me
to take a hand in it. I sized him up as an
advniurer and one incapuble o* managing
such a scheme. He said that he had bonded t.
great deal of- land near the park, and he
appeared to be a professional boomer auxious
to carry out a big real estate scheme.
I relused io have anything to do with the
scheme, but Mayne persisted, especially in
October. 1890. All I said to any of the Super
visors was to let the thing alone and especially
cautioned them not to do anything looking
like a clean-up before going out of office. In
November 1 went to Europe and the franchise
was given while I was in London and I bad
nothing to do with it.
I will say that during a talk Msvdc told me
he had made a contract with the managing
editor oi a morning paper by which the paper
was to back the measure and get Mayor Pond
lo sign it aud receive $12,000 if the scheme
was successful. The paper, he said; had lived
up to Us agreement, but he had foolishly sur
rendered the contract.
The same article goes on to say that
BucKley gave an explanation why a cer
tain influential journal is (was) now vigor
ously opposing him. The story involved
a certain half-forgotten electric-liehtfran
chise which was not granted in 1890.
"The proprietor of that journal," he
said, "came to me in the fall of 1890 with
information that he wanted a franchise for
an electric light company and asked me to |
go and see his business representative in
the Nevada block. * * â¦ He offered
me 3000 shares at $2 a share if I would
(being, so he said, the Board of Super
visors) work in his interest. I declined,
but before I went I was told that the news
paper in question would rnin me. The
attack was begun and has been kept up
ever since," which same is probably quoted
to confirm the identification of the paper
mentioned in the fore part of the article.
The complaint continues, in effect, that
no mistake can be made as to the manag
ing editor referred to, as the Examiner
was the only newspaper advocating the
franchise; that by reason of the broad
implication conveyed in the defendant's
words, as reported in the Call interview,
to the effect that he (the plaintiff) had
sold himself and his paper for $12,000, he
was prevented from following his pro
fession and securing desirable positions.
All of which is assessed as a damage
amounting to $25,000.
The delay in fiJing the suit was due to
the absence of Mr. Henderson in the
mountains.

FIXING UP A FINISH FIGHT.
A Corbett=sharkey Battle
for $10,000 a Side to
Be Settled To=day.
SHARKEY THREATENS TO WHIP
CORBETT ON THE STREET.
The Champion Tells How It Hap=
pened==Denial of a Story That
the Fight Was Fixed.
The name Sharkey was uttered by thou
sands of tongues yesterday. He, the man
who really bested Corbett, the world's
champion pugilist, in four rounds, was
the hero of the hour. His star is now in
the zenith.
He appeared at the Palace Hotel last
night and was followed by a crowd as full
of mute admiration as any that ever fol
lowed Corbett.
The public opinion around town yester
day was that Sbarkey ought to have had a
decision the night before and that he had
the best of the fight. This the champion
himself, especially the part of it exclusive
of the decision, practically admits. He
admits that shrimp salad and French din
ners are no menu for a prize-figiiter in
training.
Such is the state of admiration around
town for the sailor lad that he can get all
the money he wants to back him in any
kind of a cont est with Corbett. There is
a quartermaster in that part of the Pa
cigc squadron of the United States navy
now down at Santa Cruz who wants to
put up $10,000 on him.
The story cropped out yesterday that
the whole battle was a "fake" fixed up as
a necessary prelude to an Eastern sparring
tour of the principals. This Sharkey ve
hemently denied in an interview, and if
he can't get another fight with Corbett ne
threatens to lick him on the street
James J. Corbett and Dan Lynch, repre
senting Thomas Sharkey, met yesterday
and neid two conferences in regard to
having a finish nght between the princi
pals.
They arranged to meet at noon to-day
to come to a final agreement, sign articles
and post $2500 forfeit for a fight to a finish
for $10,000 a side and the largest purse
offered.
It is proposed to fight in Mexico or any
where else except Soutn Africa inside of
six months, Marquis of Queensbery rules
to govern.
FOR A FINISH FIGHT.
Principals and Backers Will Meet
To-Day to Arrange One for
$10,000 a Side.
When at the close of the contest in the
Pavilion Corbett congratulated Sharkey
on his excellent wrestling qualities this
additional conversation took place be
tween them:
"I'm just as good a fiehter as you are
and I can whip you," said Sharkey.
"You can't in 100 years," was Corbett's
reply.
"I can whip you in a finish fight for
$10,000," added Sharkey.
Tben Corbett drew nearer. Raising tbe
index finger of his right hand to em
phasize his words he said:
"Remember, now, Sharkey; don't. say
what you don't mean. If you'll put up a
side bet of $10,000 I'll erive you a chance
for a finish fight with me. But you'll
have to put up the dough or it don't go."
In no way abashed Sharkey retorted:
"I'll put it up all right if you will. I'll
see you to-morrow."
Well, Sharkey did not see Corbett, yes
terday, but hiÃ representative, Danny
Lynch, did. It was just the same and
perhaps better as business more than
reminiscences was tai'red of and settled.
Lynch first saw Corbett at the St. Nicho
las Hotel in tbe morning and they decided
to meet in the afternoon at 4 o'clock at
Harry Corbett's place on Ellis street to
arrange for the prospective match.
It was subsequently decided that a more
retiree* place would afford beiter facilities
for uninterrupted conversation and the
hotel was again sought.
Corbett and Lynch, a dozen friends and
the newspaper men were present at the
conference.
"I understand Sharkey wants to fight
me to a finish; is that so!" asked the
champion.
"That is right," answered Lynch. "I

am here to speak in behalf of Sharkey and
to arrange for a finish fight with ybu for
$5000 a side if you care to meet him."
"1 want to mpet him, all right," said
Corbett, "but he'll have to put up more
money than that. He will have to put up
$10,000. If Sharkey don't want that I will
post $10,000 and challenge any man in the
world. I had to do that when I challenged
Su'.livan and I don't see why Sharkey
should not do so with me."
Lynch was not long in deciding, but he
preceded his decision with an inquiry that
indicated his disbelief in Corbett's sin
cerity.
"Now, Corbett," he said, "do you really
mean you'll fight Sharkey for' $10,000 a
side?"
"I do," the champion replied.
"Well, how mucn forfeit do you want
down? Will $1000 do, or do you want
more?"
"My experience with Fitzsimmons has
made me dead careful. I want a good,
heavy forfeit deposited right from the
jump."
"You needn't be afraid," put in Lynch.
"This won't be a case of Fitzsimmons.
Sharkey isn't afraid of you; he demon
strated that last night."
"How?" asked Corbett.
"By fighting you for four rounds."
"Yes, how did he fight me? He threw
me down, bounced me about the ring and
wrestled both the referee and me to the
floor."
Lynch was anxious to get further into
business and he interrupted the cham
pion's train of argument.
"Now, I'll tell you," he broke in. "I'll"
make this match with you for $10,000 "
Before he could proceed any further
Corbett interrupted:
"Here," he said, "I want to know if it
is true that Sharkey said what was pub
lished in the morning papers, that I
I clinched as much as he did."
''I don't know what he said to the news
paper men; but to be candid with you I
will say that he told me you fought â
foul," stated Lynch.
"I'd like to ask that of Sharkev him
self," Corbett rejoined, "because I want to
know."
"What difference could his answer
make?" asked Lynch. "Would it inter
fere in any way with the signing of arti- j
cles in this case?"
"Yes, it would. If he said that, we'll
sign articles barring clinching. We'll
break when ordered ~by the referee, and
the man who don't do it will lose the
fight."
"All right, are you ready for the match?
Sharkey is."
"Yes, I'll bet $10,000," said Corbett, "I
can beat him in any kind of a match. We
will tight for the largest purse to be ob
tained in America or Mexico, but I bar
Johannesburg. 1 don't want any South
Africa in mine. You can rest assured I'll
be ready to fight under the management
that will offer us the most money. Sharkey
can leave his interests with me in that
respect."
"That's all right, Mr. Corbett," aaid
Lynch. "We must now agree upon a tem
porary stakeholder. As a matter of fact, I
am even willing to have the permanent
stakeholder selected here. I will agree to
put up not over $2500 immediately upon
signing the articles of agreement, $2500
more later on, and eventually the remain
ing $5000. This being settled, when do
youpropose the fight shall come off?"
"Within six months. It will take a
month anyhow before we get an offer of a
good parse. Leave that to me," said Cor
bett with a knowing smile. "I know where
I can get a good purse. But I want it
understood that we are to fight Marquis
of Queensberry rules, not the rules ob
served last night."
"Never mind that, Mr. Corbett," said
Lynch. "I will say right here that I don't
want anything but what is sauare and
fair. You will find no trouble either with
Sharkey or with me. Just as I do in a
horserace I will do in this, the judge's
decision to be final."
"As I am liable to be clear across the
country in a short time I want all details
for this affair settled and well understood
now." said the champion.
"That is exactly the thing," came from
Lynch. "I want the articles signed before
you leave. We must make the original
deposit as a forfeit with a temporary
stakeholder, and as I know a lot of good
people East that you also know I think it
won't be hard for us to settle on the final
stakeholder there if you do not want to
name one here."
Corbett could think of nothing else. It
was decided that each side would pro
duce articles of agreement to-day at noon,
discuss matters and try to agree'
"I want to tell you something, Lynch,"
Corbett said in the way of opening up
more discussion. "I made arrangements
for a light with Fitzsimmons, and then all
his money was attached. I don't think
the same will be the case with you. I want
it understood that I am not going to be a
fool again and leave $10,000 tiea up for a
year like I have done. I will not wait a
minute after the time the deposits are to
be made, but will claim forfeits when they
are due. Another thing >s tbat, regtÂ»rd
less of what anybody says, this fight will
be for the stakes, purse and champion
ship of the World. lam still the cham
pion, technically and actually. I have
had a deposit of $1000 for six "months in
Chicago to fight Fitzsimmons and he has
refused to cover it."
"Dont be afraid on the money end of
this, Mr. Corbett," said Lynch. "Sharkey
has $5000 of his own money to go up on
this fight, and outside of that 1 will see
that the $10,000 :s there. I don't suppose
you care whose money you are fighting
against.
"No, that is all right," said Corbett.
"But I'll tell you something else I've just
thought of. Sbarkey must not fight any
body else, or enter into a limit d contest
between now and the date of our meeting."
"Will you bind yourself in the same
way?" asked Lynch.
"No; why should I? I am chanÂ«pion
and have a right to do as I please. But I
don't think you quite understand me. I
mean that if he enters into a contest be
tween now and the lime of his fight with
me, and vets defeated, the whole thing is
off. I don't think, however, that he will
be so foolish, for he can make a heap more
money showing now, after the reputation
I have given him, than he could make
fighting and taking chances."
Lynch agreed with the champion, and
they parted each assuring the other of his
intention of signing articles of agreement
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JUNE 26, iÂ»y<s.
and having $2500 to deposit as a forfeit at
noon to-day.
Sharkey already has an invitation to try
to become an actor. He will make his
dramatic debut at the Alcazar Theater
this evening, in a set-to with Danny
Needhain in "The Cross-Roads of Life,"
and will appear also Saturday and Sunday
evenings.
HOW IT HAPPENED.
Corbett Says His Neck Was Full of
Shrimp Salad and His
Stomach Sick.
A couple of slignt abrasions of the face,
a lacerated ri^bt knee and a contusion of
the right hip are the outward evidences of
James J. Corbett's meeting with Thomas
S bar key-
Away down deep, however, somewhere
under the left side of his vest, there is ah
awful sore. It is, of course, less physical
than sentimental, but it hurts and hurts
dreadfully.
Corbett remained in his rooms at the
St. Nicholas Hotel all of yesterday, where
many of his disappointed friends called
upon him to learn how it was he had not
annihiliated the obscure sailor lad.
"I fought like a Chinaman," the cham
pion declared, "and I have come to the
conclusion that a man can't train on
French dinners when he's going to fight.
â¢'Do you know what was ihe matter
with me? I just simply underestimated
the man I was going to meet. I want to
give him all the credit due him; don't for
get that. He is a wonderfully powerful
man, and can stand more than any one 1
ever saw. He is game all through, but he
is the foulest fighter that ever stepped into
the ring.
"tie disregarded all the rules under
which we were supposed to be fighting,
and he bounced me about the ring givine
me hiplocks and throwing me around as
if he had a hold of a brawling sailor in a
barroom fieht.
â¢'As i told you, I was not in condition
to meet such a powerful man, so as to stop
him in four rounds. I was carried away
with the fact tbat I had a California
audience about me, hundreds being my
own person&l friends. My father ami
brother Harry were right back of me, and
I wanted to show myself to good ad
vantage. I believed I could go at almost
any pait and stand four rounds of it, but I
found I was mistaken.
"In the first two rounds Sharkey kept his
head covered by his right forearm, and
swung his left, sawing the air. I should
have allowed him to keep doing this until
he changed his tactics. At all events, 1
never should have punched him while he
was so protected. But I wanted to spurt,
as I said before, and the pace told on me.
"When I went to my corner after the
second round, I told Delaney. 'Billy, I feel
that last shrimp salad up in my neck. My
stomach is going back on me.'
"In the fourth round, when Sharkey
fired me over his hip and knocked down
the referee, who fÂ«ll on my chest, Carr
said distinctly, 'I give this fight to Corbett
on a foul.' l'then turned toward Delaney
for him to net ud on the platform and
claim the fi^ht. When Delaney tried to
jump up, Captain Wittman grabbed and
pulled him back.
"Maybe you don't think that fall I got,
with the referee landing on my stomach,
was a dandy. It just simply knocked the
starch out of me. It would have done as
much to any man, let alone one with au
already nauseated stomach.
"But, as I told Shaxkey, he is no fighter,
and I am ready and anxious to go him
again four, six, eieht or ten rounds, or to
a finish, for $10,000 a side.
"The next time I meet Sharkey it will
be a different thing entirely. I know my
man now, and I won't monkey with him.
He is good enough for me or anybody else
to train for properly.
"My financial end of the business
was all right. I got my 60 per cent,
amounting to exactly $7063," concluded
the champion.
WILL LICK HIM SURE.
Sharkey Says What He Will Do to
Corbett to Please the
Public.
Thomas Sharkey, the hero of the hour,
spent some of his time and hard-earned
coin last evening leaning over the Palace
Hotel bar.
At best the now famous sailor lad is not
handsome. But, with a right eye made
black and blue by Corbett's punches, a
few abrasitfns on the forehead and cheeks,
also a swollen red nose, he was in ill keep
ing with the rich and tasty surroundings.
Sbarkey was not drinking. He never
drinks as drinking is usually understood.
He might take a small glass of beer,
which would drive an ordinary seaman
crazy for more, but he never touches hard
liquor. He was smoking a large dgar
with evident delight and was entertaining
an admiring throng.
Sharkey is not one of those fighters who
are full of mystery. He has no "Coups de
Jarnac" is reserve, and he is as free as
the air with all he knows and feels.
He rehearsed, his battle with Corbett all
over again for his friends, and also told
them what he expected to do with the
champion when they next meet in the
ring.
Incidentally Sharkev displayed his high
regard for the dear public.
"They are my friends," he said. "They
showed it last night. Everybody knows I
can whip Corbett, and he knows it, too.
"I am trying to make a tinisn-fight agree
ment with him, and you caniuet bet tnat I
will fetch it on. There will be no monkey
j work with me like there was with Fitz
simmons.
"If Corbett tries it with me I'll meet
him on the street and lick him anyhow
just to please the public."
"ALL CUT AND DRIED."
The Coming: Match Said to Be a
Purely Advertising Scheme
for Both.
There is an ugly feature cropping up in
this whole Corbett-Sharkey matter.
Whether right or wrong, it is spoken of
in whispers among that inner clique con
sisting mainly of betting men, bookmak
ers and the like.
They are the very men who are likely to
know of crooked work being done, but, on
the other hand, they are the ones best cal
culated to spread damaging rumors for
motives of their own.
"This match Corbett and Sharkey are
trying to make Is a cooked-up job," was
the expression of belief volant eered to a
Call reporter yesterday.
The speaker said the same thing in re
gard to the matter the day previous a few
hours before the Corbett-Sharkey light
took place.
The statement he made then was that
Sharkey would make a great showing, and
with the reputation he would gain by
standing Corbett off, the latter and he
could make capital galore in the future.
"1 have seen their : contract," was as
serted in a most-positive way. "They
signed it a day or two ago, and it calls for
their going on a tour as sparring partners,
or in working up a big purse for a fight to
a finish."
It is certain that matters have turned
out in such a way as to give color to the
statement. â¢
In speaking on the subject, however,
Sharkey yesterday said:
"That is not true. There's nothing in
it. I never made any such agreement, and
I have no contract in my pocket or posses
sion. If there is any such" arrangement it
has yet to be made. I'd rather meet Cor
bett in a fight to a finish than tour the
country with him.
â â ..â ; .-, â  â _ â^ '
SHARKEY INCENSED.
He Is Extremely Anxious to Have
Another Go With Cot bett to
a Finish.
"Yes," remarked Sharkey emphatically,
"I want a rest now worse than anything
else, and then I intend to get a finish
fight with Corbett, if I can. I will fight
him or Fitzsimmona, or any one else in
in the ring today, as soon as I get a little
rest.
"You want to remember that I have
had no rest for nearly three years, simply
because I have met all comers. I am
tired of training all the time. After a
couple of months I will fight any of them,
outside of a nigger. Don't want any
'colored' gentlemen in mine," he con
cluded.
Sharkey was asked how much he would
make out of this fight. He said he was
unable to tell, as all that business was
left to his backer. The amount is com
monly supposed to approximate $3000.
On being asked if he got in any telling
blows on Corbett his countenance lighted
up with a grim smile.
"Well, you can just gamble I did,'* he
replied. "I gave him more than he gave
me."
"What was the hardest blow you struck
Corbett during the fight?"
"The time I knocked him over against
the ropes was about the hardest thump, I
think. Then I gave him a pretty stiff
punch in the jawâ the time he fell. That
was a peach."
"Did Corbett come up to your expecta
tions in the fight?"
"Oh, yes; he was fully as scientific as I
expected him to be. But, then, you
know," he added, with an injured air,
"the public is inclined to give me no
credit for being clever myself at all. Hang
it, I have as much science as any of them.
Haven't I fought the most scientific men
in the world, among them being Choynski
and Greggains? And now oughtn't my
showing with Corbett to convince them
tbat I am no slouch?
"You can just bet," he went on, "that
there are no flies on Tnomas Sharkey, if
he does say it himself. Corbett didn't hit
me in the mouth once, while I banged
him there three times, one after the other.
"The only blows he hit me were after
the breakaways. I promised, at his re
quest, to break like a gentleman, and stuck
to the promise. I always fight fair â for
instance, the way I fought Williams. Cor
bett said, 'Break away nice, now,' and the
first time we broke be landed on my eye.
"Well, just wait until I get another
chance at him â say in a finish contest or
anything over ten rounds â and then "
The sailor lad paused with lowering brow
and set lips in ominous silence. "Woe be
unto Corbett next time we meet," is what
the expression said more plainly ihan
words.
"Now Fitzsimmont is in England and
Corbett signifies his intention of going
there to meet him. I guess I can give him
all the fun he wants for awhile on this
side. There is just one more thing I want
to say here, and that is: Of all the foul
fighters under the sun Corbett stands un
rivaled. If we ever meet again I will do
him up."
IN A BATH ROBE.
Sharkey Receives Visitors Notwith
standing: a Red and Black
Eye.
The sailor lad received scores of visit
ors yesterday in a bathing robe. He
was taking a post-graduate course of
sweats and various batns and lone inter
missions of rest at the Hammam. Per
sons who want to see Sharkey now must
send in their cards or their names. Before
the battle he was open to all, but is a little
more exclusive now.
But this does not mean that tbe sailor
lad's hat is getting too small for him. He
is just as reserved as ever in his manner,
but he is now inclined to do a little more
talking. He has met th? champion and
found that, he is not such a great man as
he thought. Consequently he feels more
self-confidence and more like asserting
himself.
Sharkey has a bad right eye from the
jab that Corbett gave him in "one of the
breakaways. The leeches, put on the night
before, did not bring ail the relief ex
pected, and yesterday the color of the
injured optic was deeper. But pugilists
do not mind a black eye, especially after a
well-fought battle, ana that is not the
reason that he is staving indoors. He is
simply resting, and when he gets ready he
will walk out before the world, perhaps
to-day. Considering the circumstances,
this is a case where a black eye is not a
source of humiliation, but perhaps an
honor.
WON'T FIGHT MAHER YET.
Sharkey Says Corbett Promised
Him Money If He Would
Quit.
At the baths yesterday Sharkey told a
remarkable story of the champion be
seeching him during the fight to quit and
promising him a consideration if he would
doit.
Ho said that in the last round Corbett in
a clinch said to him, "Quit, Tom, quit,
and I will make it all right for you."
"This made me hot," said the sailor
lad, "and 1 fougnt all the more savagely.
Corbett was dead tired and I could not
shake him off. He held his left arm
around my neck and I was powerless to
do anything, as I could not get away from
him. FinaUy I did manage to break
away, and as I turned to smash htm in the
face he grabbed mÂ« again around the neck
and tried to choke me. This is what ne
calls fair lighting.
"Well, I went at him again and we
clinched. He then turned to the referee
and said: 'Announce me the winner.
Sharkey has quit.' Tben I was wild, and
as the referee got between us I pitched
both of them to the floor.
"Corbett's next trick to save his wind
and himself was to beckon the police to
come into the ring, which they did. If he
had done the same kind of fighting that I
did tbe referee would have given him the
match, and that's all there is to it.
"I was informed last night tbat Corbstt
fainted in the carriage while being driven
from tbe pavilion to bis hotel," be con
cluded.
Sharkey stated that he would fight Cor
bett again, but not till he takes a rest of
two months at some spring in Colorado.
This rest he wants before he puts on the
gloves again with anybody.
Sharkey will not give any attention to
Peter Maher's challenge, as be wants a
rest after having so many fights.
A NEWSPAPER FIGHTER.
What "Denver" Ed S mlth Calls Cor
bett, Talking by Wire From
New York.
NEW YORK, N. V., June 25.â 1n an in
terview wfth a representative of tbe
United Press to-night "Denver" Ed Smith,
speakin g of the Corbett-Sharkey tight last
night said :
"I knew Corbett was overrated. He is
only a newspaper fighter. I have been
after him for years, but he has offered all
kinds of excuses, saying, among other
things, that 1 am a second-rater.
"Corbett's class must now be a tenth-rater
if I am a second-rater," he said, "when he
could not lick a novice like Sharkey. If
Corbett don't cover my money and will
make a match with Sharkey it shows be is
afraid to fight me; and should they fight
they cannot fight for the championship
unless they meet me, as ray money is up,
and under* the rules of the ring I am the
only champion pugilist in the world.
"I will meet Corbett at any time or in
any place, and will fight him with bare
knuckles or gloves," said "Denver" Ed.
"Now, if he is a man and not a coward
let him show tbe public that he will fight,
and I will guarantee to punch his big head
off. I would also like to have a few rounds
with Tom Sharkey, either in the Madison
square Garden or California, to show the
admirers of boxing that I am a better man
than Corbett."
Smith is backed by Hildebrandt and has
51000 posted at the "Police Gazette office to
h'cht Corbeit for the championship of the
world, under the recognized champion
London prize-ring rules with bare
knuckles. Corbett as yet has not covered
this money.

THE BATTLE REVIEWED.
Said to Have Been Lucky for Cor- j
bett That It Was Not a Six-
Round Go.
Now tbat the smoke of the Corbett-
Sharkey battle has cleared away some of
its points of attack and rally can be more
clearly seen.
It was a proud smile that "the unde
feated champion of the world," as Billy
Jordan announced him, wore when he |
stood up before the new Sullivan at the |
beginning of the first round. The smile I
was there still at the opening of the second
and when the gong sounded for the third,
but by the end of that round it had lost all j
of its condescension, and in the fourth it
had entirely vanished. Even before the
third round Corbett had discovered that he
had all the hard work he wanted and that 1
Sharkey was not only setting the pace but j
cutting out the shape of the cloth. He
whimpered to his seconds tnat it was roast
beef and hominy instead of a French dinner
menu that was being served and that the j
bill of fare was unexpected.
Close observers and many old-time pa
trons of the ring thought they observed
signs of "grogginess" in Sharkey as he
walked to his corner at the end of the sec
ond round. His right eye, where Corbett
uppercut him in the first round, had
swelled up and be seemed a little bit dazed.
Up to the beginning of the third round
Corbett clearly had the best of it. His !
vastly superior science and generalship j
was apparent to the most inexperienced ob
server.
But at the end of the second round the
champion's trolley was off. He was out
of wind, and it could be discerned that he
was rapidly losing breath and strength,
though he tried to smile and hide it and
deceive the spectators. Sharkey made the
pace too hot.and from that time on Corbett
was really on the defensive and using the
best tactics at his command to prevent be
ing knocked out.
The programme had suddenly changed.
It was Sharkey stopping the world's cham
pion in four rounds instead of Corbett put
ting out the sailor lad at any stage of the
contest.
The champion had made a mistake.
His superior sparring ability rose above
Sharkey as an elephant towers above a
mouse, but his staying qualities, his ener
gy, were soon gone and then lie began to
devote himself to his own salvation.
It was plain to all that had the fight
continued but two more rounds, and prob- 1
ably only one, that the champion would
have been prostrate and Sharkey would
have been his conquerer.
The mistake that Corbett made was in
making so little preparation for the battle.
He underestimated his opponent and i
trained for only an easy four-round con- j
test where he would have it entirely his j
own way. As a matter of fact Sharkey had !
the best of the battle.
Notwithstanding his virtual defeat last
night the judgment of the best sporting
men around town is that with proper
training for a finish fight Corbett would
win out, though Sharkey would have a
chance and give him as much work as he
would want, Marquis of Queensberry rules.
But at London prize-ring rules, where
wrestling goes, Corbett would imet his
Sharkey just as Sullivan met his Corbett
at New Orleans.
In an inteiview with Sharkey yesterday
afternoon as to whether he was dazed at
the end of the second round, he said :
"Not for a second ! I was not 'groggy.'
I would not have got the blows I did had
not Corbett uppercut me in the break
away. Outside of that he never landed on
me so that it affected me a bit. I'll fight
him to a finish right now."
RULES NOT VIOLATED.
Marquis of Queensbery Rules Say
Nothing: About Blows In the
Breaking: Away.
There is a widespread opinion that Cor
bett struck Sharkey foully when they were
breaking away, and at the ringside he was
hissed by many for these blows.
The fight was under Marquis of Queens
bery rules.
There is no reference whatever in these
rules to clinching or hitting when clinched.
Then as a matter of fact Corbett did not
violate tne rules in upper-cutting Sharkey
while they clinched or in breaking away.
Sharkey, however, claims that he agreed
with him to "break away nice." While
this personal agreement, may have been
violated there wÂ»s no infraction of the
rules by either man. .
PARSON DAVIES' OFFER.
Posts a Forfeit for a Match Be
tween Choynskl and Sharkey
or Corbett.
CHICAGO, 111,, June 25.â "Parson"
Davies. manager for Joe Choynski, has
posted a forfeit for a match with Tom
Sharkey, who gave such a good account
of himself in his bout with Corbett last
night.
Following is a copy of the challenge ia
sued on behalf of Choynski. It is ad
dressed to the sporting editor of a San
Francisco paper:
ItearSir: I have deposited $1000 with Will
J. Davis, manager of the Columbia and Hay
market theaters, this city, in support of the
following offer to Tom Sharkey, who has just
made such a splendid showing with James J.
Corbett in your city :
I will match Joe Choynski against Pharkey
for a finish contest, Qneeusbury rules, for a
side wager of $5000, at any reasonable time
after siguing articles. In the event of tbe con
test taking pla<;e in or near your City I will
transfer my money to your paper, which, I
trust, will act as financial stakeholder.
In the event of such Sharfcey not desiring to
engage in a finish contest with Choynski, I am
prepared to make a match of eight rounds,
Choynski o attempt to stop him, under the
same conditions which governed their former
contest.
The marine champion failing to accept either
of ihe above offers, the following proposition
is made to James J. Corbett: Joe Choynski will
box him eight rounds. Should Corbett stop
Joe. he is to take the entire gate receipts.
Falling to do so, he is to forfeit the same.
As Choynski's showing with Sharkey was far
superior to Corbett's, and as Sharkey publicly
stated that Joe was the greatest fighter he had
ever met, this should prove a good contest.
I trust I will receive an immediate answer to
the above, as I am arranging matches between
Dan Creedon and Peter Maher with Joe. The
above propositions, however, hold good Irre
spective of the results of the contests with
Maher and Creedon. Yours sincerely,
Chari.es D. Davies.
WILL BACK SHARKEY.
The Flagship Philadelphia's Quar
termaster Has $10,000 to Bet
Against Corbattor Fltz.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., June 25.â Pan!
Hermann, quartermaster of the flagship
Philadelphia, stated here to-day that h<
would back Sharkey with $10,000 for a fin
ish fight with Corbett or Fitzsimmons.
Hermann expressd satisfaction with
Sharkey's work in his four-round bout
with Corbett and said he was confident
that Sharkey would have knocKed the
champion out if tbe police had not inter
fered.
His enthusiasm or his knowledge of
Sharkey, who owes his success :o the
quartermaster, leads him *o openly assert
his belief that there is not a man in the
world who can best the sailor boy in a
fight to a finish.
What the Fighters Made.
The net receipts of the battle were over
$13,000. Corbett'B share is about $7000,
and Sharkey gets about $2500. If tbe
fight had been to a finish the chances arc
that the division of the receipts would
have shifted ends.
Frequent vigorous rubbing of the hands
will promote the circulation and keep the
skin in good condition. Care should be
taicen of the nails, too â they should be
soaked in hot water occasionally and kept
neatly trimmed.

PIONEERS' NEW YACHT.
She Will Sail Under the Club's
Colors in All Re
gattas.
Handsome Acquisition to the Pleasure
Ciaft of the Bay Built by
Julius Heiming.
The Pioneer Yacht Club, formerly the
Bilge-water Yacht Club of this City, has
just added another yacht to its already
large fleet of white-winged flyers, and it
will not be long before the Pioneer Club will
ha\e the largest fleet of any yacht club on
the bay.
At present over twenty-five yachts, rang
ing from 20- foot plunrers to 45-foot sloops
and comprising some of the fast st yachts
on the bay, notably the Magic, Volunteer,
Sam Vincent, Mary and Ariadne, are
among the present fleet, and before long
several new ones will be added, as several
yachts are now being built along the shores
of the southern end of tbe harbor, the
ownerÃ of which are members of the
Pioneer Club.
The latest addition to the club's squad
ron is the magnificent new yacht Elthe,
owned and built by Julius Henniug, a
young yacht builder of local fame.
She is m odeled after the new yacht Sam
Vincen t, which wag recently launched ou
Long Bridge, is 28 feet long, 11 foot beam
and 3 feet 2 inches deep.
She whs built on what is known as the
"old hulk," a steamer long past its days of
usefulness and now used as a boat build
ing and repairing shop oif the Arctic Oil
Works.
Mr. Henning at first contemplated mak
ing the boat after the Eastern models,
with cutaway bows and a fin keel, but
after noticing the work of several of this
style of yachts here he concluded that
straight bows and a full stern were prefer
able to the other style. He says that it
will be conducive of just as much speed.
He is ready and eager to try conclusions
with any of these cutaway bowed and
drawn in sterned boats.
The Elthe was built with a view to sta
bility. Her keel is a one-length stick of
well-seaÃoned oak 4 inches thick. Her
timbers are also of ste:im-bent oak. 2
inches thick and 1% inches wide, and are
pl.iccd 6 inches apart. Her planking is of
cedar. She is ripged with a centerboard,
7 feet long and 3 feet high. Her cabin is
a thing of beauty, paneled with highly
polished white and Spanish cedar, which
is embellished with a magnificent hand
worked border. The ceiling has been
sandpapered and polished till it has a sur
face like a mirror.
The cabin has accommodations for about
twenty people. In the forward part are
arranged clotheslockers and a toilet, and
aft lockers for dishes and provisions. On
each side of the cabin are placed folding
bunks, which, when not in use, can be set
up against the side of the boat, giving to
the cabin plenty of available space.
She will carry a good spread of canvas.
Her mast is 34 feet high ; the ma^n boom of
the mainsail is 30 feet long, the caff 14 feet
long and the perpendicular hoist 22 feet.
She will carry one jib of the following
dimensions: 14 feet long on the hoist and
30 feet on the stay. A mainsail and jib
will be her working sails, but in addition
to these she will be equipped with a com
plete suit of racing sails, and in the future
regattas the Eli he ought to show up well
in any event she enters.
TACOMA FINEMEN STRIKE,
Will Leave Their Pout* Unlr-mt Back Sal'
arira Are Paid.
TACOMA, Wash., June 25.â Thirty-nine
' ity firemen to-day sent a letter to Mayor
, Fawcett, informing him that because eight
mouths' back salary was due them they
would quit the city's service on July 1.
A special council meeting has been called
for to-morrow to consider their plea.
Insurance men demand that the depart*
ment be maintained at full strength. The
city has nearly $100,000 in the treasury,
and the present dilemma is caused by the
necessity of an investigation, now nearly
finished, as to the legality of outstanding
warrants. Pending this cash cannot be
applied to the redemption of old warrants,
nor new warrants be issued, because the
legal limit Has been reached. It is believed
the council will arrange to pay the firemen
something.
A woolen rag saturated with boiled lin
seed oil is recommended for removing
scratches from a highly polished surface,
which may afterward be varnished with
shellac dissolved in alcohol.
