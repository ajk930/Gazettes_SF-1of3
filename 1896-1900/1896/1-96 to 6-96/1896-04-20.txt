LOS ANGELES, Cal., April 19.â One
day more and Los Angeles will be en fete.
Already the city has a holiday appear
ance, but a great deal of work remains to
be done in the next twenty-four iiours to
make the town a fit place of residence for
her Majesty, the queen of the carnival,
whose coming has been heralded for Tues
day evening. The Queen's merry maskers
will take possession of the city on the
afternoon of that day. They will parade the
street- in fantastic array, pillaging the
stores and marts of trade for such articles
as they think are meet tributes for their
gracious sovereign. The merchants who
are wise will bar their doors against the
invaders, but those who have already
contributed liberally of their wealth
to defray the expenses of the
court will have little to fear, as
the Queen baa given instructions that her
foragers shall pass the houses of all such
and loot only the business places of rich
men who have refused to make voluntary
contributions of their substance for the
entertainment of her Majesty and her
train.
To the credit of the easiness men of Los
Angeles as a whole it must be said that
they have shown great enterprise and lib
brality in the matter of subscribing funds
for the fiesta and devising means w hereby
to make the third annual carnival the
most successful event of the kind ever at
tempted o:i '.he Pacific Coast. From pres
ent indications there is every reason to
believe that their expectations will be real
ized and that tiie thousands of visitors to
Los Angeles this week will see such a ser
ies of feies as tiaa never been equaled on
the Western shores oi this continent.
There is oniy one contingency that can
detract from the pleasure of the occasion
and that is the weather, an element that
usually does not enter into the calcula
tions of the people in this land of sun
shine in making preparations for outdoor
amusements. This year seems to be ex
ceptional, however, in view of the high
winds that have prevailed for nearly a
week, which, to some extent, marred the
iloral festival at Santa Barbara. Should
this kind of weather continue it would in
terfere materially with the comfort of the
spectators and participants in the carnival
events, and might prove disastrous to
pome of the street decorations, but the
people are hopeful and are going ahead
with the preparations just as though they
*ere assured of the linest kind of weather.
It would be very unusual, indeed, if
there should be two weeks of such weather
as. that of last week. To-day was raw and
chilly and a rough wind came in from the
ocean. A change of weather before Tues
day is confidently expected.
A great many of the street decorations
were completed yesteraay and last night.
All along the line of march, which takes
in Broadway, Spring and Main streets,
from Seventh street to the plaza, the elec
tric poles are being decorated with palm
leaves and boughs of pepper, eucalyptus
and other evergreens. Banners of red,
yellow and green floated to the breeze from
wires stretched across streets at intervals
of about 100 feet. The streets leading
from the railroad stations to the center of
the city are similar! v decorated, giving
visitors from abroad the impression that
the whole city is decked in colors typical
of the orange, the oiive and wine.
Many of the ousiness houses and private
residences are being elaborately decorated,
the red, green and yellow of the fiesta
being harmoniously blended with the
national colors. At night red, green ana
yellow incadescent electric light greet the
eye on every hand. Wires are being strung
along all the business streets about eight
feet from the curb, from which thousands
of Chinese lanterns will be suspended. The
city during the five nights of the carnival
will be most brilliantly illuminated.
On a block of vacant ground bounded by
Sixth, Hope, Seventh and Flower streets,
tribunes have been erected for the seating
of 5000 Deople. The seats are arranged in
tiers around what is called the Queen's
Highway, through which all processions
will oass immediately after starting.
In the center of the tribunes the queen,
surrounded by her maids of honor and the
gentlemen of her court, will be seated on a
throne, Irom which she will review all the
parades*. The sale of seats began last Mon
day and notwithstanding the fact that the
price was repeatedly raised nearly all were
sold in a few days. On nearly every
vacant Jot along the line of march addi
tional tribunes are beinsr erected and seats
are selling in advance like hot cakes. Be
sides these every window ana balcony
along the route\of the parades will have its
quota of spectators.
The line of inarch is a long one and
ample opportunity will be afforded the
countless thousands who wili throng the
city to see ail the | ageauts. After passing
through the queen's hiphway near the
point of forming the route will be via
Sixth street to Broadway, to First, to
Spring, to Seventh, to Main, to and around
the piaza, countermarch on Main to Tem
ple and thence on Spring street back to
First and Broadway, whore the processions
will disband. The course will be about
three miles lonj:.
The choice of a Queen by the executive
committee of La Fiesta was a most happy
one. Mrs. Mark Lewis, upon whom the
The San Francisco Call.
honor was conferred, is a most beautiful
young woman and very popular. She will
make the ideal Queen." Her father, R. H.
Howell, a well-known capitalist, and her
husband, assistant cashier of the State Loan
and Trust Company, have spared no ex
pense to make ber wardrobe the most regal
ever displayed in Los Angeles. Each of
her gowns has been evolvea with an eye
to the most effective detail. They were
designed and made by Miss Alice Gastren,
and all the material, the yards and yards
of shining satin, the webs of filmy lace,
the golden jeweled embroidery and the
royal ermine, were bought in Los Angeles,
and Los Angeles luay well be content with
the knowledge that when such an occasion
offers she has within her stores material
quite befitting a Queen's wardrobe.
First there is the dress in which her
Majesty appears when she, with her court,
meets the ceremonial committee at the
pavilion Tuesday nightâ a shining shim
mering pink brocade with great splasnes
of yellow chrysanthemums covering it.
A fall of rich lace ornaments the front,
embroidered with jewels. From this falls
long yellow silken tabs, finished with gold
fringe and gold ornaments of costly beads.
Immense puffed sleeves and a Marie An
toinette collar of gold lace finish the waist,
while a long court train of yellow satin,
edged with ermine, gives a most beautiful
and queenly effect.
The lovely day gown which will h* seen
at the tribunes is of rich white siLÂ», bro
caded in green and pink. Emerald green
velvet tabs, fastened with an immense
rhinestone bucKle, the tabs falling to the
feet, ornament the waist, while from the
high Medici collar, jeweled and glittering,
sweeps the train of green velvet, lined
with pink satin and trimmed with ermine.
The decorations are of pearl passementerie
and form a striking contrast to the em
erald velvet decorations.
At Athletic Park the dress worn will be
of white mousseline de soie over white
satin. Over this fall yards and yards of
filmy Valenciennes lace. A Spanish
flounce finishes the skirt, ornamented
with garlands of green and white tendrils
ana Nile green roses. A white hat, a
white silken and lace flounced parasol,
long white gloves and white satin slippers
are Dart of this costume.
The ball dress is, perhaps, in its comple
tion the most beautiful. It is of dazzling
white satin, with jeweled plastrons, gold
and jeweled embroideries ornamenting the
skirt. Tho sleeves are puffed and are of
gold-brocaded silk, a high gold lace collar
finishing the neck. The long court train
is of gold brocade, lined with yellow satin
and finished with ermine. With all these
dresses the jeweled girdle and necklace of
rubies and the beautiful crown are worn
and the golden scepter is carried.
The queen's clear cut, regular features,
her delicately tinted complexion,; her
beautiful bronze brown eyes with their long
lashes, her tall and stately figure, all com
bine in effects of extreme and queenly
beauty.
F. K. Rule's two little sons, Gerald and
Roy, will carry the Queen's train in the
picturesque dress of court pages.
In nearly every sbopwindow in the city
are displayed photographs of this stately
woman who has been chosen to rule over
the Ansrelenos during the period of the
fiesta. Her dazzling beauty will be charm
ingly augmented by that of sixteen maids
of honor, who have all been chosen for
their grace of form and manner.
One.of the greatest events of the fiesta
will be the concert to be given on Wednes
day evening. A magnificent chorus of
John F. Francis, President of La Fiesta
of Los Angeles.
300 voices has been assiduously trained
and the effect of this harmony of vocular
ensemble cannot fail to be one of the
greatest musical events in the history of
the city. The services of Mrs. Maud Berry
Fisher, who has a voice of great range,
wonderful flexibility and of great sympa
thetic quality, have been secured as so
prano soloist.
Mrs. Charles Dickman, who has a voice
of wonderful depth and beauty, and has
been the solo contralto in the most noted
choirs of San Francisco and Oakland, will
also be heard. The tenor is Andrew Bo
eert. He is an artist of renown and favor
in the musical world, and has a magnifi
cent voice â pure, unalloyed and sweet.
Another great feature of the week's fes
tivities will be the floral parade on Satur
day. Besides innumerable other decorated
equipages, there will be a score of tally-ho
coaches and drags, with from four to eight

horses. The Jonathan Club expects to
carry off first prize with its tally-ho, the
decorations of which will cost hundreds of
dollars.
IJEALJ>sntIUi'S CONTEST.
Final Count of the Vote* for Queen to 1iÂ«
Made I hia Evening.
HEALDSBURG. Cal., April 19. â The
contest for queen of Healdsburg's Floral
Festival closes to-morrow evening at 7:30
o'clock, and to-night a guard watches the
ballQt box, for hundreds of votes were
deposited to-day, and each represents a
moneyed value. The finance committee
does not intend to let any enterprising
individual get away with the contents of
the box.
Without a doubt the vote to-morrow will
be heavy. There are four pretty girls who
would be willing to wear the floral crown,
and the friends of each are working hard
for their favorite. Even on this blustering
Sunday workers were out in the farming
districts adding to the already large purses
raised.
Miss Nellie Petiay heads the list with
1570 votes, having 300 more than Miss
Alice Haigh, who leads Miss Edna Biddle
by fourteen votes. Miss Oza Waldrop is
close up. Miss Waldrop is a pretty blonde,
and her many friends are quite intent to
have her in fourth place until the last
ballot has been put into the box, when,
they declare, she will be found to have a
sufficient number to make her queen.
A committee from the Veteran Fire
man's Association was here fro m San
Francisco to-day making arrangements
for the accommodation of the association
d uring festival days.
The decoration committee has been al
lowed $425 additional for the purpose of
making an electrical display, and a five
pointed star of electric lights will be hung
over the plaza. Hundreds of blue and
white incandescent lights will make the
business portion of town bright as day by
night.
Entries for the parade are coming in
from all parts of Sonoma County and one
float has been entered from Mendocino
County. Five bands have been engaged
for the fiesta.
Snila From Santa Barbara.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., April 19.â
The United States steamer Albatross,
which has been lying here for the last
week, will leave for San Pedro to-morrow,
where it will remain for the next week to
give the officers and men an opportunity
to view the Los Angeles fiesta. The Alba
tross is the United States Fishing Com mis
sion boat, and prior to coming here did
some deep sea dredging around Santa Cruz
and Santa Rosa Islancs, but found nothing
of note.

STREET RIOTS
IN HONOLULU.
The Portuguese in an Angry
and Troublesome
Mood.
CONFLICT WITH POLICE.
President Dole Has a Narrow
Escape From Personal
Violence.
THE MOB FINALLY DISPERSED.
Indications of a Conspiracy Looking
to the Restoration of the
Ex-Queen.
HONOLULU, Hawaii. April 10.â There
is a feeling of unrest and uncertainty in
this city at present, which arose from the
recent Portuguese demonstration to the
Legislature, and which has been aggra
vated by occurrences since that time , the
principal one of which was a regular Por
tuguese riot on Sunday evenin g last.
Mrs. Mark Lewis, Queen of the Los Angeles
Fiesta, and Her Maids of Honor.
On the corner of Punchbowl and Emma
streets a drunken ex-policeman took away
a bicycle from a Portuguese boy, and his
cries brought a lot of Portuguese women
to his assistance. This portion of the city
marks the commencement of the Portu
guese quarter, while a few doors below, on
Emma street, is the residence of President
Dole. A row ensued, in which the drunken
policeman was roughly handled by a num
ber of Portuguese. He was, however,
arrested by one of the mounted patrol,
who was attracted to the scene by the dis
turbance, and taken to the station-house.
In the meantime the crowd of Portu
guese had been swelled to two or three
hundred, and two or three police had ar
rived on the scene. The Portuguese be
gan abusing the policemen and calling
them all manner of vile namss. President
Dole heard the disturbance and came out
to the street, where he warned a number
of excited Portuguese to go home, but they
paid no attention to him.
A lieutenant of police came up at this
juncture and asked the President for
orders. He was told to clear the streets
and arrest any who opposed the order. By
this time seven or eight police were on
hand, including two or three of the
mounted patrol. These charged on the
mob, and picking out two or three of the
ringleaders attempted to arrest them. The
mob resisted, and as fast as one was ar
rested the mob would rescue him. The
Portuguese fought with sticks and stones
and finally commenced pulling off the
pickets from neighboring fences.
The police, except the lieutenant, were
only armed with clubs, but they did good
execution with them. A passing wagon
was seized by the police and they made a
stand around it, seizing a rioter and
throwing him in as they got a chance.
Meanwhile, the mounted police were
riding their horses through the mob and
endeavoring to separate them.
The mob by this time had got in front of
President Dole's house and was rapidly
increasing in size. The Prezident went in
among tne rioters and urged them to dis
perse, but they paid no attention to him,
although they offered him no personal
violence.
In the meantime the facts had been
telephoned to the police station, and Cap-
A. Roncovieri, Musical Director of the
Los Angeles Fiesta.
tain Scott, at the head of a dozen heavily
armed police, came up Emma street in the
patrol wagoa at a gallop, and they arrived
just in time to prevent loss of life.
The lieutenant of police was surrounded
by rioters on all sides and drew his pistol
to protect himself. The mob yelled that
he would not shoot, but he fired one shot
on the ground. At the sound of the shot
and the sight of the rifles in the patrol
waeon the mob dodged round the corner
and disappeared.
When the melee was over the police took
stock of what they had in the wapon and
found nine of the rioters, two of whom
had to be sent to the hospital at once.
The others were taken to the police sta
tion where they were at once bailed out by
leading Portuguese at $100 cash each. The
police escaped without any serious in juries.
Since that occurrence there has been
much ill-feeling between the police and the
Portuguese, which so far has only found
vent in occasional volleys of stones thrown
at policemen from behind fences.
The result of all this has been to create
a feeling of impending trouble with the
Portuguese, and this is increased by the
i inactivity of the legislative committees on
the Portuguese petitions. The Legisla
ture is inclined to treat the recent demon
stration as a bulldoziug proposition and
will be apt eventually to consign the pe
tition to the waste basket.
In the meantime no one seems to really
know what the Portuguese are up to.
Readers of The Call will remember that
in these letters a prediction was made
that the restoration of the ex-Queen was
what was secretly aimed at, and from in
formation gained by your correspondent
since that time he is more than ever con
vinced that that is what is really intended
by some of the members of the society.
I am in a position to know that certain
Portuguese have made treasonable utter
ances, and that these have been reported
to the Government, which, so far, has
made no move beyond watching the sus
pects very closely. How the Portuguese
expect to effect the restoration is unknown,
for they have no arms or financial backing,
but that they have some deep-laid scheme
on foot is self-evident. They have abso
lutely refused work on any of the planta
tions, even at the increased rate of $18 per
month now offered. The Government,
confident in its strength, is taking things
very easily, but at the same time is fully
awake to the situation.

KNIFE AGAINST PISTOL
Battle to Death on a Streetcar Between
an Ex-Policeman and a Gang of
Negroes.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 19.â As a
result of a battle on a streetcar about 1
o'clock this morning ex-Policeman Jonas
and Will Hampton are dying and several
others are saffering from â wounds more or
less serious. When Jonas was on the
force be incurred the enmity of the negroes
by the rough manner in which he treated
them, and since his removal from the
force the negroes have repeatedly threat
ened him. When Jonas boarded the
streetcar he found it full of negroes, among
them being Will Hampton, who, having a
grudge against the ex-officer, began curs
ing him and a free fight followed, the ne
gro s attacking the white man. Hampton
used a pistol and Jonas a kniie. The white
man slashed with the knife, cutting
Hampton's throat and wounding several
others. Jonas finally put the negroes to
flight, but not before he had received a
bullet in the head and was beaten almost
to a jelly. Ail the negroes have been ar
rested. Jonas and Hampton will die. It
is believed the attack on Jonas was pre
meditated.

CABLE LETTER
FROM BERLIN.
Current Events That Are
Agitating Press and
People.
DUELING IS PARAMOUNT
England's Action Against the
Transvaal Comes Next to
Importance.
CAN SHE CONDUCT TWO WARS ?
Hostile Criticism of American Inter
vention in Behalf of the
Cubans.
BERLIN, Germany, April 19.â The time
of the introduction in the Reichstag of
the Centrist interpellation in opposition to
the practice of dueling has been fixed for
Tuesday next, and if the Government
should fail to make a satisfactory state
ment In regard to the matter the Centrists
will either offer motions demanding tne
suppression of dueling or support the res
olution of tne Freisinnige demanding that
the chief authorities of the respective fed
eral States shall exert all their powers to
put a stop to this custom, especially in the
army.
The debate upon this matter will afford
the Freisinnige and Socialists a splendid
opportunity to assail the Emperor's re
peated remissions of sentence imposed
upon duelists after they had spent brief
and easy terms of confinement in a fort
ress.
The Government will find it peculiarly
difficult to answer the Centriat interpella
tion in terms which will be sufficiently
satisfactory to obviate the introduction of
a motion calling for the total suppression
of the practice of dueling. Both the Cen
ter and the Freisinnig parties are desirous
that the Government shall issue an edict
of such a character as will absolutely
prevent recourse to dueling without refer
ence to a military court of honor, whose
decisions have frequently rendered duels
imperative.
It was the action of the military court
in expelling Lieberecht yon Kotze from
his rank as an officer for neglecting
to challenge Baron yon Schraeder and
suing him in a civil suit instead, that
eventually caused the fatal encounter be
tween the two men. The Emperor him
self thought that Kotze ought to fight,
and consequently quashed the decision of
tne military court, thus enabling Kotze to
regain his position as an officer and fulfill
the requirements of the military code by
sending Schraeder a challenge.
It i 3 not expected therefore that the
Emperor will instruct the Ministers to
promise what the Centrists and Freisin-
nige demand.
The utmost that can be hoped for from
the debate is an abatement, but not the
extinction, of the evil. The Kaiser's pre
rogative of extending clemency ia abso
lute and cannot be controlled by the
Reichstag, but the aim of the Centrists is
to make the Ministry so far responsible for
the remission of sentence imposed upon
duelists as to enable the Reichstag to de
mand explanations in cases where sen
tences are remitted. This will act as a
partial check to dueling if the Government
assents to the Centrists' demand.
Next to dueling the leading cause of
popular excitement is the preparation
which England is making for action
against the Transvaal.
All of the Austrian and Italian influ
ences in the councils of the Dreibund
which have been thrown on the side of
England will become paralyzed if events
shall confirm the suspicions entertained by
Germany that Great Britain intends to co
erce the Boers. The peaceful assurances
given by the British Ministers and the
British Parliament are distrusted here.
The North German Gazette cautiously
advises delay in the dispatch of English
troops to South Africa in deference to
.President Kruger's peace policy, but the
unofficial and more outspoken Tageblatt
sees a plan on the part of Great Britain to
use the Matabele rising as a pretext for
sending forces to the Cape Colony.
The Vossische Zeitung approves the ac
tion of the Boers in arming themselves to
protect their independence and predicts
another Majuba Hill disaster to England.
The Boersen Zeitung declares that the
British army is wholly inadequate to the
task of conducting two wars at the same
timeâ one in the Soudan and the other
against the Boers. If England refuses an
entente with Germany, through jealousy
of the growth of German influence in
South Africa, the paper adds, the loss will
not be Germany's.
Although the report that President
Cleveland has offered the friendly services
of the United States in settling the Cuban
troubles is not confirmed, the North Ger
man Gazette, in an intensely hostile criti
cism thereon, written.upon the assump
tion that the report is true, tells Spain to
decline positively to admit that thÂ« Presi
dent of the United States has any right to
tender his advice in the Cuban matter, or
rather to tell the American Government
to mind its own business.
The Vossische Zeitung says: If the
United States Government gives effect to
the resolution passed by the two houses
of Congress recognizing the Cubans as
belligerents Spain must to'erate the act.
She cannot go to war with the United
States, but America cannot expect any
European State, however weak or dis
trested, to submit without protest to such
interference.
The United Press finds excellent reasons
for stating that the views expressed by
thÂ« two newspapers above quoted do not
represent the opinion of the Kaiser, who
thinks that Spain ought not to reject the
friendly diplomacy of the President of the
United States, but rather should show a
willingness to negotiate with and assist
the Government at Washington to find a
way to settle the Cuban question.
Professor Eulenburg, the eminent Ger
man physician and assistant to the clinic
of the University of Berlin, has written a
letter to the Medical Gazette in which be
declares that there is no cause for a hostile
campaign against Dr. Behring's diph
theria serum, which, if properly injected,
he says, is perfectly safe. Even if it were
not quite safe, be continues, it would not
cause death with such rapidity as in the
case of the infant son of Dr. Langernaus,
the medical director of the Moabite Hoa
pital, who died two weeks ago from the
effects of a precautionary injection of the
serum.
Professor Eulenboxg thinks that Dr.
Langerhaus was himself to blame in mak
ing a mistake in giving the injection so
that an embolism was induced. The arti
cle of Professor Eulenburg has helped
greatly to allay the serum scare.
The United States Consuls in Germany
have published in their respective con
sular districts the regulations governing
the export of American meats from the
United States, with a view of dispelling
the German prejudice against the Ameri
can product.
The-Strasburg Post in commenting on
these regulations says: "The provisions
of the American law are clear and suf
ficient, nevertheless official examinations
of American meats made here prove that
the meats imported are bad and that the
law therefore cannot be stringently en
forced."
The Berlin Neuste Nachrichten pro
fesses to know upon good authority that
practices exist in the American meat
packing business that would so disgust
foreign consumers did they know of them
as to forever deter them from touching
American-packed meats.
In view of these and other expressions
inspired by commercial jealousy, Ameri
can meat does not grow in favor in Ger
man y.
The Berlin employers have agreed to
give their employes a general holiday on
May 1, for the purpose, as they allege, of
enabling them to attend the opening of
the Trades Exhibition, which takes place
that day. The Socialist preÂ«s is jubilant
over this concession on the part of the em
ployers and ascribes it to the recent Social
ist manifesto threatening a boycott against
all employers who do not join in the cele
bration on May day.
The North German Gazette, comment
ing upon the communication sent by Mr.
Chamberlain to President Kruger. giving
the reasons for an increase of the British
military forces in Cape Colony, says: "We
are glad that Mr. Chamberlain has done
this, as it shows the intention of the Brit
ish to avoid irritation of the Boers."
Fritz Friedman, the absconding Berlin
lawyer, who is still in custody in Bor
deaux, has written to friends here saying
that the death of Baron yon Schraeder,
who, he declares, pursued him with im
placable hatred and incited his pecula
tion, has altered his intention of publish
ing the court revelations contained in the
so-called Kotze letters in his possession.
A dispatch from St. Petersburg says it is
reported there that the Sultan of Turkey
has accepted an autograph invitation from
the Czar to visit Moscow and fct. Peters
burg. The date of the Sultan's visit has
not been fixed, the dispatch says, but it is
possible that it may occur at the time of
the Czar's coronation.
Mrs. Runyon, widow of Hon. Theodore
Runyon, late United States Embassador
to Germany, and her daughter. Miss Julia
Runyon, will sail for New York at the end

WILLIS TAKES OFFENSE.
The Minister Calls President
Dole's Attention to an [
Attack.
Angered by the Republication of an
Article From an American
Newspaper.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, April 11. -United
States Minister Willis, being about to sail
to the East for a sixty days' furlough, on
the 9th in st- paid his official farewell visit
to President Dole. After the customary
interchange of friendly speeches the
Minister took occasion to express his dis
satisfaction with a paragraph in that
morning's Advertiser, intimating that it
was the organ of the Government, an em
ploye, Collector J. B. Castle, being a
principal stockholder therein. Foreign
Minister Cooper assured Mr. Willis that
the Advertiser was in no way controlled
or inspired by the Government, and
promised to speak to the editor about the
offending article, which was done.
The offending paragraph was one quoted
without comment from an editorial in the
Washington (D. C.) Star, the moat an
noying words of which were: "Mr. Willis
has no value whatever in Honolulu. If
anything, he is a standing affront to people
for wnom the people of this country feel a
warm attachment."
The next issue of the Advertiser pointed
out that the paragraph was copied from
the Star without comment, ana asserted
t c paper's absolute independence of the
Government. It expressed regret that the
American representative should have been
misled by rumors, and sincerely hoped
that Mr. Willis would fully recover his
health, which had been sadly broken by
the nervous strain incident to the trying
position he occupied.
Since the disagreement of the 17th of
January there has been no direct exchange
of social courtesies between Minister Willis
and any member of the executive. Oh ac
count of smallpox on the Gaelic Minister
Willis' departure was again postponed un
til the 16th.
Activity on the Clyde.
LONDON, Eng., April 19.â The Clyde
trade shows a wonderful exp ansion. The
orders for 40,000 tons of new shipping
were piaced there in April. Steel vessels
are especially in demand. The greatest

Thirty-Eight Subjects of the
Empire Known to Have
Been Slain.
APPROACHING ANOTHER CRISIS
Downfall of the Present Premier and
His Faction Believed to Be
Imminent.
TOKIO, Japan, April 7.â lt is believed
that affairs in Korea are rapidly approach
ing another crisis which will involve the
downfall of the present Premier and his
faction. The idea is that Li Pon Chin will
evade the difficulties of his position by
proceeding to Russia, ostensibly as erabas
sador to attend the coronation ceremony,
and that Pak Yons-ho, now in the United
States, will be snmmoned to head the Gov
ernment. Rumor now alleges that the
flight of the King to the Russian legation
was entirely due to the machinations of Li
Pon Chin. He deceived both sides: tue
King by a cleverly fabricated story that the
Russian representative was highly desirous
of his Majesty's secret removal to the lega
tion so that he might escape the fate of his
late consort, and the Russian representa
tive by an equally ingenious pretense that
the King eagerly wished to seek asylum
under the roof of the Russian legation
against murderous projects on the part of
the Japanese. Both were imposed upon,
and thus the affair of February 11 took
place.
The number of Japanese subjects mur
dered in Korea since February 11 now
totals tnirty-eight, in aadiVon to five who
are missing. Great patience has been
shown by the Government and people of
Japan in the face of these outrages, the
nation's indignation being curbed by a
conviction that any resolute employment
of force to quell the insurgents and pun
ish the murderers might involve a collision
with Russia. But it being now evident that
Russia's designs in the peninsula are not
bo matured or far-reaching as was origin
ally supposed, the Japanese will probably
adopt vigorous measures to protect the
lives and property of their nationals.
Of seven Japanese working in Caroline
Bay to float the Chinese crniser Kwang-yi,
three have been murdered by Koreans.
Four of the little party had proceeded to
Chemulpo on business and when they re
turned to the scene of operations, they
found their comrades dead and their
houses reduced to ashes. The four men
themselves were violently assaulted and
barely escaped with their lives.
The colony of Hongkong is suffering
from an epidemic of something like
rinderpest. The dairy farms have been
almost annihilated, and the colonists are
deprived of their supply of fresh milk.
The bubonic plague also is again asserting
itself. Its reappearance is attributed to
want of thoroughness on the part of the
sanitary authorities, who, instead of burn
ing the hovels where the disease germs
were most likely to find a nidus, pulled
them down and sola the materials by auc
tion.
The caterpillar plague continues to de
vastate the district of Kowloon. Nine and
a half tons of the insects have been col
lected there, but they have not as vet
made their appearance in Hongkong.
The diplomatic corps in Peking has
been greatly exercised recently about the
choice of a language for use in their offi
cial intercourse with the Chinese. English
used always to be employed, but, a set has
been made against it. On the occasion of
the Imperial Audience at the Chinese New
Year, the doyen of the diplomatic
corps made his speech in English. The
reply was interpreted into English, where
upon the Ministers of Russia and France
called upon the interpreter to render it in
their respective languages, which was
done. Happily, all the other Ministers
sent did not insist upon similar consider
ation for their various tongues. Subse
quently the diplomatic body held a confer
ence to determine which language should
thereafter be employed, and English
gained the day by one vote. But the mat
ter was not allowed to rest there. Further
meetings took place and circulars were
sent round advocating the use of French.
At the imperial banquet French was exclu
sively employed, the United States repre
sentative, who is doyen of the corps, hav
ing, for some inexplicable reason, con
sented to the veto against English.
Some of the German officers engaged in
organizing and drilling the new army in
Nanking have been roughly handled by a
Chinese mob. Before his departure from
the city, the former Viceroy, Chang Chih
tung, purchased a piece of ground and set
preparations on foot to build there a mili
tary school, barracks and houses for the
foreign officers. The situation is said to
be particularly choice as to its scenic sur
roundings. On March 16 several of the
German officers â there are thirty-tive in
Nanking â went to look at the progress of
the work. They did not ride together,
having no suspicion of peril. The first to
arrive, Major Baron Reitzenstein, was im
mediately set upon by two or three hun
dred yelling Chinese and received a nasty
beating with poles and clubs before he
succeeded in extricating himself and riding
away.
Several of his brother officers, corning
subsequently, were similarly treated, but
happily all escaped without serious
wounds. It is supposed that the mob be
lieved the new Viceroy, Liv Kun-yi, to be
hostile to the foreign-drilled army scheme
and were anxious to give practical effect to
their belief. The Viceroy has issued or
ders for the arrest of the rioters.
After all the talk about the reappoini
ment of the Black Flag chief, Liv Yung-fu,
to his former post of brigadier-general in
Kwangtung â an appointment that would
have signified the Chinese Government's
approval of Liu's opposition to the Jap
anese in Formosaâ the place has been
given to another official, which means that
Liv has been dismissed from the Chinese
service. F. Bbinkley.
Genera I â  Booth's Zeal.
LONDON, Eng., April 19.â General
Booth, the commander of the Salvation

birth on April 10 by holding a series of
councils from early in the morning until
late at night. He'has concluded arrange
ments for reconstructing the official staffs
of the army in the United States. India,
South Africa and elsewhere. The War
Cry says that the General's zeal does not
abate, and that he is able to worfc fifteen
hours a day. The paper adds that he is
not afraid of a split in the army in the
United States, because salvation is inter
national.
BURGOMASTER OF ' VIENNA.
Dr. Lueger Elected, a Third Time by the
Municipal Council-
VIENNA, Austria, April 19.â The Mu
nicipal Council has again elected Dr.
Lueger, the anti-Semite leader, to the
office of Burgomaster of Vienna. This is
the third time that Dr. Lueger has been
elected to this office. Upon the first occa
sion he declined to accept the office be
cause he did not think his majority was
large enough. The second time he was
elected by a larger majority of the* mem
bers of the Council and the Emperor
promptly dissolved the Council and an
nulled Dr. Lueger's election, whereupon
much rioting ensued. Yesterday the Coun
cil elected him by a still lanrer majority,
ninety-six votes being cast for him. It is
expected that the Government will again
dissolve the Council and take the appoint
ment of Burgomaster into its own hands.

CLEVELAND AS ARBITER.
Engaged in Settling a Dispute
Between Italy and Co
lombia.
Enormous Mass of Evidence and Ar
gument in a Case Involving
$1,500,000.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.âPresi
dent Cleveland is now engaged in the arbi
tration of the claim of Italy against Co
lombia, all the papers in the dispute hav
ing finally been presented in accordance
with the convention between the disput
ants.
The case involves damages amounting to
nearly $1,500,000, on account of the perse
cution of Ernesto Cerruti, a wealthy mer
chant and Italian consular representative
during a revolution in Colombia about ten
years sgo.
The Italian brief â which was delivered
to the President by Frederick R. Coudert
and S. Mallet-Prevost some time ago, and
to which Calderon Carlisle for the defense
has only recently filed an elaborate techni
cal replyâ declares that Cerruti, who had
during a long residence in Colombia
amassvd a considerable fortune, establish
ing one of the greatest mercantile organiza
tions in that country, was accused of vio
lating the neutrality laws between the
contending parties in the revolution of
1885, and that all his estates were confis
cated. After vainly endeavoring to secure
reparation, Italy broke off diplomatic rela
tions with the South American State and
sent a war ship to rescue Cerruti and his
family from the country.
Through a protocol arranged by the Co
lombian and Italian Ministers at Paris, in
1886, Colombia agreed to return all Cer
ruti'a property, and the question of his
neutrality was referred to the Government
of Bpain, which in 1888 decided that Cerruti
had not violated the neutrality la,ws and had
not lost the rights and privileges of a neu
tral foreigner and was entitled to in
demnity for the injuries sustained. For
the next five years negotiations continued
between Italy and Colombia, finally re
sulting in the agreement of August 18,
1894, to leave the matter to the aroitral de
cision of Presid~ent Cleveland.
This agreement was reached only after
Cerruti had declined Colombia's offer to
â ettle for 1,000,000 francs, gold.
It is understood that one of the first offi
cial duties of Assistant Secretary of State
Baldwin has been to study the enormous
mass of evidence and argument that has
been presented by the distinguished coun
sel on both sides.
ftOHK BEFORE COXORESB.
The General Pension Bill to Come Up in
Hi?. Bouse.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.-To
morrow is "suspension day" in the House
â that is to say a day on which it is in or
der to take up bills for immediate passage
under suspension of the rules. That order
will be followed by the general pension bill
reported on Friday last. By the terms of the
bill discontinuances or reductions of pen
sions, except for fraud or error or recovery
from disabilities, are made unlawful.
Chairman Pickler estimates that the restor
ation of pensions and additional expendi
tures authorized by the bill will amount to
$2,000,000 or $3,000,000 a year.
Cannon wili afterward call up the gen
eral deticiency bill. Wednesday and Thurs
day have been set aside for a discussion of
the bankruptcy bill, upon which a vote is
to be taken by the House on Friday.
In the Senate an effort will probably be
made to antagonize Peffer's pending bond
purchase investigation by calling up the
Indian appropriation bill. The naval ap
propriation bill has been ready for consid
eration for ten days and Hale is very anx
ious to dispose of it. Gorman is credited
with an intention to attack the provision
for four new battle-ships. He proposes to
reduce this number to two and to substi
tute for the battle-ships stricken out small
sized gunboats for use in rivers and shal
low water.

Have Been More Than
Fulfilled.
ELECTIONS YET TO BE HELD.

"WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.â The
following is the statement given out by
General Grosve nor pursuant to the custom
which has prevailed to announce the pro
ceedings of the McKinley campaign in the
press of each Monday. General Grosvenor
said:
"Before giving you the situation as it
stands to-day, I want to call attention to
my tirst bulletin, which was issued before
any delegates had been elected. At that
time I predicted that the vote for McKin
ley on the iirst ballot would be stated as
below. I place now within the first column
my prediction at that early date and in
the second column I place the results in
all of the same States in which the full
complement of delegates has been chosen:

"It will be seen that Kentucky, New
Mexico and Utah have fallen below my
estimate â five in Kentucky, one in New
Mexico and one in Utah, while Georgia,
Indiana, Kansas, Illinois, North Dakota,
Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin
have all gained. This comparison of the
original estimates, which aggregate 433,
with the actual results from elections in
eighteen States, shows very clearly that
the estimate was too low.
"There have been elected delegates in
States that I did not claim in that esti
mate â Minnesota 18, New York 4 and
Pennsylvania 2. And it will thus be seen
that if the same ratio of gain is maintained
to the end of the States forming my origi
nal prediction there will not only be the
433 delegates claimed, but there will be a
clear majority of the convention in these
States alone and those in which I claimed
nothing in my orieiual estimate.

"The New York TriDune of this morning
gives McKinley 318 practically uncon
tested and instructed votes. In my report
I exclude doubtful votes and have failed
to claim a number known to be for Mc-
Kinley. I point to the vindication of my
original estimate with some degree of
satisfaction, and 1 state now that my
present estimate of safe votes for McKin
ley on the first ballot is below the actual
facts.
"The most significant feature of the last
week's election is the number of second
choice instructions for McKinley. In this
category may be classed New Hampshire,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania and New York,
and it is safe to say that there are now
of well-defined second-choice delegates,
thoroughly committed to McKinley as
such, not less tbaii 125.
"During the remainder of April there
will be elections in Connecticut, Mary
land, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Indian Ter
ritory, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Ver
mont and Arizona â in all, eighty-four
votes. Out. of this number it is a very low
and conservative estimate to claim for Mc-
Kinley fifty delegates.
"Then will follow in the month of May
conventions in the following States: Cali
fornia, Indiana, Michigan, Nevada, West
Virginia, Montana, Missouri, Delaware,
Colorado, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming
and North Carolina, with 152 delegates. It
will be seen that the McKinley situation
has not only constantly improved, but is
rapidly approaching a triumphant conclu
sion."

Political Situation in the Golden State
Described.
NEW YORK, H. V.. April 19. -A Tri
bune special from Washington Bays: R.
M, Hitchoomb, a well-Known commission
merchant of San Francisco, who is here to
advance the interests of the proposed Ha
waiian cable enterprise, describes the
present political situation in California as
follows :
"California, as far as the great mass of
its people are concerned, is for free silver,
though the managing people of both po
litical parties are solidly against it and
everything that looks that way. There is
considerable doubt, however, that they
can stem the tide, and the present outlook
is that both parties at their coming con
ventions will readopt the free-aiiver ex
pressions they passed at the last conven
tions simply because the active political
managers will not be able to prevent it.
The preponderance of the sentiment of
the Republicans is for McKinley all the
way through, though Reed and Allison'
have many friends there.
"It. is generally recognised, on the Pa
cific Coast, as it is here^ that this to be a
Republican year, and But little is though,*
of or said in connectic|i with lihe Demo
cratic Convention. Cleveland will be in
dorsed by the State Democratic' TftfiVen-'
tion as against any other Democrat, un
less, before it is held, he indicates in a
public way that he does not desire an
indorsement. Senator White may be
strong in the southern part of the
State, where ne resides, but he cuts no
figure in California Democratic politics in
other parts of the State, as is evidenced by
the fact that every Democratic holder of
leading Federal positions in San Francisco
secured his appointment in the face of
White's opposition.
"The Democratic situation will be just
as Mr. Cleveland makes it. Personally he
can have what he asks for, but be will
have to ask for it, though the gift will go
to him on a silver palver."
JrKOM A HEED STAXDPOIST.
A. Friend of the Speaker IHffera With
Oeneral Grosvenor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 19.â The
weekly bulletin furnished by Representa
tive J. Frank Aldrich of Illinois giving the
results of the Republican .Presidential
canvass from the standpoint of a friend of
Mr. Reed, issued to-night, is as follows:
"The developments of the past week in
the Republican Presidential contest have
resulted In no material change in the rela
tive standing of the leading candidates,
notwithstanding the prediction last week
that McKinley's strength 'will grow rap
idly by the conventions in Kentucky, Ne
braska and New Jersey-' Of the tVenty
votes confidently counted upon by him in
Kentucky Governor Bradly has captured
sixteen, and the failure to instruct for Mc-
Kinley the fourteen delegates elected from
New Jersey was a significant disappoint
ment. .
"My last statement gave Mr. Reed 111
delegates, McKinley 169, to all other can
didates 166 and 48 doubtful. In tnat table
I credited Mr. Reed with two uninstructed
delegates which, upon later information,
I deem it fair to place in the doubtful
column. With this single exception my
figures of last week cannot be seriously
disputed.
'â¢The fieures herewith presented have
been carefully compiled from reports re
ceived from day to day and verified by re
plies received from telegrams sent to vari
ous States yesterday. I have placed six
teen additional delegates in the doubtful
column, twelve of wnich are from New
Jersey. Of the 604 delegates elected to
date McKinley has just about 35 U per cent.
If he continues af this rate to toe end he

the tables sent out from Washington each

teen or fifteen of these votes will never go
to McKinley, whether the name of Har
rison is brought before the convention or
not. These men on the delegation who
threaten to bolt McKinley are warm per
sonal admirers of Harrison, and their re
sentment I as been aroused by the charac
ter of the McKinley campaign in Indiana,
led by Chairman Gowdy of the State Com
mittee. Gowdy has declared that the
State convention shall instruct for Mc-
Kinley, even if it requires a bitter fight,
and the Harrison people accuse him of in
spiring certain paragraphs that are ap
pearing in the country newspapers, to the
effect that Indiana would have been for
McKinley overwhelmingly even had Har
rison been a candidate.

RESTING AT CORONADO
Eastern Bonifaces Pass a Quiet
Sabbath at the Ocean
Beach.
Tia Juana Is Visited and the Guests
Tread Upon the Soil of
Mexico.
CORONADO, Cal., April 19.â This has
been a typical Southern California day
and the members and ladies of the Hotel
Mutual Benefit Association have enjoyed
it much. The morning hours were gen
erally given to rest, though quite a num
ber patronized the hot saltwater plunge
bath rooms, while a few went fishing. The
local Presbyterian and Episcopal churches
drew to their doors some of the strangers,
but the great majority spent the forenoon
in the rotunda and court of Hotel del Cor
onado, upon the porches or out on the
sands.
In the afternoon tl:ere was more anima
tion. There were driving and riding par
ties; a trip to Tia Junna, where the ladies
and gentlemen stepped Over upon Mexican
soil and then stepped back again ; a ride
out upon the jetty at the entrance to the
harbor, swimming parties without num
ber in the great plunge and a general cir
culation in ana about the hotel. One of
the fishing parties returned with a catch
of about 150 pounds, comprising barra
couda, mackerel and yellow tail. They
reported great sport.
Professor G. Wharton James delivered
his popular lecture upon the saake dances
of the Southwest aud the grand canyon of
the Colorado to an appreciative audience
this evening.
Continual expressions of pleasure and
surprise at the wonderful beauty, attrac
tiveness and fertility of the soil of South
ern California are being beard. To-morrow
will be San Diego day. There will be a
drive, a reception by the Mayor and a
luncb at Hotel Florence, which is under
the management of George W. Lynch,
president-elect of the association. In the
evening, the annual banquet will take
place in the larue dining-room of Hotel del
Coronado, at which over 400 covers will be
laid. The set speeches of the occasion will
be by Governor Budd on "California," and
Benjamin H. Yard, its president, on "The
Hotelmens' Mutual Benefit Association."
It promises to be a great affair.
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 19.â The Board
of Trade committee is making arrange
ments to take the 400 members of the Na
tional Hotelmen's Association on a drive
through thecityand surrounding orchards
during their visit to this city next Satur
day. The visitors will be feasted at the
Hotel Vendome, and everything possible
dona to give them a good idea or the rich
ness and productiveness of Santa Clara
County. It is proposed to have prepared

bill of fare at the feajt. From here the
visitors go to Monterey, where they remain
over Sunday.
JACK FROSTS HAVOC. .
Oranges and Lemons Afone Escape Around
Clove rd ale â Damage Reported From
Several Sections.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., April 19.â This
section is having an unusually cold spring,
the most disastrous to fruit in many
years. There has been a damaging frost
every night the past week, last night's be
ing the most severe of all. From the pres
ent outlook, half a crop of grapes is an
ticipated at the first picking, but men of
experience say that this will be followed
by a heavy second crop, which \s usually
about six weeks later than the first.
Figs and almonds were a failure, except in
favored localities. Potatoes, beans and
melons have received a setback. It is a
peculiar circumstance and worthy of note
that the orange and lemon trees have suf
fered very little the past winter and at
present they Â«.re covered with healthy
blooms. In some places this morning the
themometer registered 30 degrees.

Actual I.osÂ» to the Fruit- Grower* Will
Xot Be Great.
VISALIA, Cal., April 19.â Fully one
half of the expected season's yield in Tu
lare County will be realized in deciduous
fruits, ana the quality and quantity will
be far superior and greater than last sea
son. The growers will not suffer loss to
any extent, the enhanced value and the
great Baying of expense in thinning the
trees making quite an item. The working
men are the real sufferers; for instance, at
the Fleming orchard it would cost fully
$2000 to thin the trees.
In some localities the frost did no dam
age. Many orchards near Farmersville,
seven miles east of Visalia, escaped. Re
ports from Exeter, Lindsay and Lemon
Cove report that the citrus fruits show no
trace of frost.
Itamarf Around Merced.
MERCED, Cal.. April 19.â frost this
week has been quite destructive to every
variety- of fruit and small vege
tables. Apricots and cherries that es
caped the March frost wilted and dropped
this week. The sweet potato vines at At
water were cut to the ground sad will be â¢
total loss. Grapes met tha mi&6 disaster,
so far as the first crop was concerned. All
small vegetables went down in the general
ruin, but a great many gardeners will re
plant their places and in a great measure
recoup their losses.
Little Damage at Han Jose.
BAN JOSE, Cal., April 19.â The cold
weather of the past week has not done any
serious injury to the growing fruit crop.
Grapes have been hurt a little and in low
localities a few prunes, peaches and apri
cots have dropped, but the damage will
only be trifling. Everything points to a
bounteous crop in Santa Clara County.
yorth*rn Sonoma Crops Damaged.
HEA.LDSBURG, Cal., April 19.â A
heavy frost last night did considerable
damage to the grape and fruit crop and to
day it is cold and during the afternoon
there was a heavy fall of bail. The fruit
crop in this district will be very lignt.
HolHster Vineyards Suffer.
HOLLISTER, Cal., April 19.â Frosts
last night caused havoc in vineyards in
this county. Gaston Ashe's Anita vine

Twice Run Over,
SAN JOSE, Cal., April 19. â James
O'Brien, a middle-aged tramp, was run
down and killed in this city to-night by
the Southern Pacific train, which arrives
here from San Francisco at 8:30 o'clock.
O'Brien and another tramp named John
Hogan had been drinking to excess dur
ing the day.Jand this evening started for
the depot, intending to board a freight
train and leave town. A train was rapidly
approaching as they began to cross the
Guadaloupe River bridge.
It is supposed that O'Brien fell and was
unable to arise. He was struck and killed
instantly. The train went on to the depot
and the engine backed down across the
bridge, running over O'Brien a second
time before the engineer and fireman were
aware that there nad been an accident.
Hogan is being held at the City Prison
to testify at the inquest. He says" that he
was too drunk to know what was going
on. According to his story O'Brien is a
native of Limerick, Ireland, and has a sis
ter in San Francisco and several relatives
in Boston.

NEWS OF MARE ISLAND
Thorough Repairs to Be Made
on the Baltimore and
Bennington.
American Interests at Corinto Pro
tected by the Alertâ New
Regulations.
VALLKJO, Cal., April 19.â As soon as
money becomes available repairs on the
Baltimoie and Bennington will commence
in earnest at Mare Island, word having
been received from Washington to that
effect. The Baltimore is already out of
commission. Nearly all of the stores will
be put ashore from the Bennington to al
low the workmen as much room as possi
ble. The vessel will be overhauled from
top to keelson, and when again ready for
sea duty will be good for many years of
active service without need of visiting a
navy-yard for repairs. Upward of $100,000
will be expended on the pair.
From information received, the Alert
was expected to be on ""its way to Mare
Island by this time, but orders were sent
for the vessel to go to Corinto to look out
for American interests. In the last of
March the Alert was awaiting an invoice
of stores, especially of provisions, of
which it had but twenty days' supply
left; If none arrived by the 10th of April
the captain intended to hoist anchor and
proceed to Panama to secure an additional
supply.
It would take the traditional Philadel
phia lawyer about all of his time to keep
track of all the orders promulgated by the
Navy Department relative to the employ
ing and discharging of men at navy-yards.
The latest order received is that all men
discharged between the dates April 1, 1895,
and December 1, 1895, and marked "good,"
shall have the term changed to "excel
lent," so they can be placed on the pre
ferred list, as men to be employed first
after veterans of the war have been called.
With all the changes in ratings and rules
and regulations for employment, the work
seems to go on just about the same as it
did yearo ago.

The >*ew Gorilla at the Zoo.
Though the new gorilla has been but a
few days with us she has partially con
firmed, in one particular, Dv Chaillu's ac
count of the habits of these great apes.
He has told with much circumstance how
the old male advances to meet his foes,
â¢'beating on his breast till it resounds like
an immense bass drum, which is their
mode of offering defiance." The new
gorilla, which seem to be very nood-tem
pered, also drums on her breast, but ap
parently for pleasure. There may be some
difference in the drumming when the ani
mal is pleased and when she is angry. So
far, however, this is not apparent. The
same action, performed more or less ener
getically, may denote different feelings.
The drumming on the breast does not
seem to have occurred in the specimens
kept at the Berlin Aquarian, but the young
male sent thither by the German Loango
expedition "took a special and what may
be called a childish pleasure in making a
noise by beating on hollow articles, and
seldom missed an opportunity of drum
ming on casks, dishes or tin trays." â The

SENSATION IN A
FRESNO CHURCH
Evangelist Norvell Tests
the Truthfulness of
a Vision.
INSISTS ON PREACHING.
The Prophecy That He Would
Die in the Pulpit Is
Not Fulfilled.
AIAEM OF A CONGREGATION.
Greatly Relieved When the Discourse
Is Ended and Their Pastor
Still Lives.
FRESNO, Cal., April 19.â Rev. Mr. Nor
veil, pastor of the First Baptist Church of
this city, created a genuine sensation this
forenoon by announcing at the opening of
his services that it had been predicted that
he would not live to the end of the morn
ing sermon. He said this proDhecy had
caused his wife great anxiety, but that he
was not at all superstitious and proposed,
therefore, }o brave the fates and go ahead.
In spite of the direful prediction tne pastor
lived through the discourse, and an in
tense sigh of relief arose when he had con
cluded the "lastly" to his remarks and
announced the closing hymn.
During the sermon the pastor would not
state the source of the evil prophecy, but
when seen after the services to-night he
was very much alive and in the happiest of
moods. He greeted the interviewer cheer
fully, and when an inquiry was made as to
the cause of his remarkable statement from
the pulpit this afternoon, said :
"Yes, what you have heard is true. A
person said to me last Sunday that he had
seen a vision in which my death was
plainly portrayed, and that the end was to
come at the close of my afternoon dis
course, if not while I would be delivering it.
I answered my informant that such omens
and warnings were from Satan, and not
from God."
Mr. Norvell and his talented wife have
had charge of the Baptist church here
since the first of last January and have
awakened wonderful interest in the work.
They are both evangelists and have spent
many years among the heathens of
China. Mr. Norvell, referring to his wife
as an assistant in all his labors, modestly
remarked that she was the "abler preacher
of the two," which observation is indeed
sustained by some of the parishioners.
Referring again to the vision of death, Mr.
Norvell said:
"I hope I am near enough to the Lord to
receive my own warnings as to the end of
my life. At all events, I am not in the
least disturbed by such declarations, and
you see that in the face of this one I am
alive and well."
Expire* After a Poker Qatne.
FRESNO, Cal., Ayril 19,â Frank Smith,
who has for a long time been conducting a
small retail liquor store on Blackstone
avenue, this city, died suddenly this
morning of fatty degeneration of the
heart. Smith has been a hard drinker for
years. It is reported that he was in a game
of poker all of last night, and did not re
tire until 6 o'clock this morning, and he
was dead at 7;3C. A physician was called
and arrived just in time to see him breathe
his last.

FERNDALE, Cal., April 19.â A local
branch of the State Dairy Association has
been organized here, comprising the lead
ing dairymen of the Eel River Valley.
The object is to promote dairy interest,
which is increasing at a rapid rate. The

The State association will hold a con
vention here on June 15 and 16, and the
Ferndale association will provide free ac
commodations to visiting members. A
large attendance is anticipated and special
rates for transportation trom all steamship
lines between here and San Francisco
will probably be secured. Portland has en

MEMPHIS, Ti-.nn-., April 19.â Pat Dunne
will undertake to get along without his
premier jockey, Willie Martin. The latter
will go to the Nashville meeting, to ride
for the Hot Spring 3 stable, while Dunne
will take his string to Louisville. The
separation at this early day in the season
is connected by inside turf authority with
the very peculiar riding of Dunne's Agent
by Martin on Fridcy, a report of which
was given in these dispatches. The same
horse started again yesterday and ran
fourth, which was also regarded with sus
picion. Martin also bad the mount on
Overella yesterday. She was a hot favorite
and easily outclassed her field, but was
beaten by Royal Choice, a very long one.
Martin did a grandstand finish, driving
under whip and spur.
Presiding Judge Carter has notified
the owner of the horse Roy Lochiel
that his entries would not be re
ceived in the future at Montgom
ery Park. The horse ran unplaced in
an ordinary field on Friday last, and twice
since then he has won easily over good
horses. Jockey Knapp, who rode Roy
Lochiel Friday, has been ruled off for
criminal riding, and a recommendation
has been made to tne Turf Congress that
his license be revoked.
SAN JOSE ROAD RACE.
Oscar Smith Wins the Garden Citys' Five-
Mile Event by a Third of a
Wheel.
SAN JOSE, C\l., April 19.â The five
mile race of the Garden City Cyclers to
day, over the San Martin course, south of
this city, was one of the closest and most
exciting road events ever held in this
State. The course was in bad condition
owing to the rain, and the wind blew
strong in the face of the riders, but every
one of the thirty starters completed the
journey. Fifteen of the riders finished in
a bunch, Oscar Smith winning by a third
of a wheel from Julius Smith. The men
came in so close that the judges were
dazed, and positions after the fifth man
had crossed the tape were in dispute. The
tangle, however, was unraveled by the
judges at a special meetine held this even
ing. There were twenty-seven prizes given,
the largest number ever offered for a
single race by a California club. Tony
Deimas went over the course in 13:53 3-5,
winning the time prize. The first fourteen
riders, their handicaps, time and positions,

EMPEROR PRANOIS JOSEPH.
Characteristics of the Ruler of Austro-
Hnngary.
The Austro-Hungarian Empire is for
tunate in possessing a sovereign like
Francis Joseph, who rules with impartial
ity, serving the dual interests of state and
dynasty which he rightly considers as the
mightiest links wherewith to hold the mon
archy together. This quality has given
the Emperor, especially since the death of
the Crown Prince in 1889, universal popu
larity and respect. Primarily by his devo
tion to duty the Emperor is entitled to
the consideration he receives. The former
Prime Minister, Hasner, in his memoirs,
has without exaggeration described the
sovereign as "the most industrious man
in the realm." Bismarck, with every
other diplomatist wno has had relations
with him, confirms this statement. Alike
in summer and winter the Emperor rises
early and by 5 o'clock he is occupied at
his standing-desk. He examines all pro
posals iaid Before him, particularly such as
relate to military or foreign affairs (the
later department he has himself directed
since the withdrawal of Andrassy in 1879),
and matters concerned with royal favors
and pardons as well as the persons and
property of members of the imperial fam
ily. He submits every detail to a careful
consideration. Military maneuvers or
travel make no difference to the Emperor,
who has frequently, while on hunting
trips, attended to official business. Fre
quently the frugal midday repast is served
to the Emperor at his desk. With aston
ishing accuracy he examines every sub
jectâmore particularly matters relating to
important legislative designsâ laid before
him by the Ministry. The former Min
ister of Justice, Glaser, mentions the fact
that the Emperor in 1872 called his atten
tion to a couple of contradictory state
ments in the draft of an extensive penal
code, which had escaped the practiced eye
of the lawyer, and which the Emperor
himself corrected. His knowledge of
affairs, supported by a most tenacious

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1890.
TRIGGER SPRINGS BROKE
George Schultz Shoots a Rifle
Match Under Great Dif
ficulties.
THE RED MEN SHARPSHOOTERS
Several Good Scores Made on the
Shell Mound Rangeâ At Schuet
zen Park.
There were severalinteresting matches
on the Shell Mound rifle range yesterday,
and in many instances good scores were
obtained, for all that a cold north wind
whipped across the range all day. One
event that attracted considerable attention
Was a fifty-shot match between H. H.
Burfeind, who belongs to a number of
German clubs, and George Schultz, a mem
ber of the Columbia Pistol and Rifle Club.
Burfeind allowed Schultz 110 points in the
match. Schultz shot under unprecedented
difficulties. He had been shooting several
practice scores, and when he started on
the score three steel springs broke at the
same instant. The hair trigger spring
and the trigger spring snapped as he was
about to fire the first shot. As be removed
bis rifle from his shoulder Schultz took out
his watch, and the mainspring in the time
piece broke before he could return the
watch to his pocket.
Before the match was over the unfortu
nate marksman had a ehfll burst in his
rifle and he lost the <"et-screw off the top*
of his rear sight. By using a pair of
pincers, a file and a screw-driver Schultz
managed to utilize the larger part of the
broken trigger-spring and shot out the
match and, with his 110 allowance, won
by fifty-one points. The scores in strings
of tenshots were as follows:
Schultzâ l97, l97, 170, 195, 186â954; add
110â1064.
Burfeind-195, 224, 199, 199, 196-1013.
On Wednesday Burfeind had a 50-shot
match with A. H. Pape and made the
same scoreâ lol3. Pape's score was 1063.
Fred Schuster was also in the match to
beat Pape's score, but he failed, making
1016.
The Red Men's shooting section's
monthly medal shoot drew out a goodly
number of marksmen. Next Sunday this
club will have a grand time at Shell
Mound. Among the features will be eagle
shooting on the beach outside of the
range and valuable prizes will be given 10
the winners who demolish the artificial
bird. Of course, there will be a lively
competition to see who will be crowned
schuetzen king, which event will take
place on the evening of May 3 at the fifth
anniversary ball, which will be held at 620
Bush street.

IN THE INTEBEST OF ECONOMY.
The Story a Cigar-Smoking; Congress
' man Loves to Tell. ..-â¢;'â ;;
"I have been reading that story about,
Chickering giving me a knife with a cham
pagne opening attachment," remarked
Representative Hull of lowa a short time
ago, "and it ? s going the rounds just as
every good story does that is printed in
the Post. Btffr did any of you ever hear
Chickering's cigar story?"
None apparently had heard it and he
told it.
"Chickering lives at the Hamilton when
in Washington. There is a big family
smoking-room in the house where all the
Congressmen gather around a center-table
and hold a tobacco congress every even
ing. Chickering used to come down every
night and before taking his seat plunge
his hand into an inner pocket and draw
out a handful of fine cigars. He used to
pass them around and to the credit of
those assembled be it said they always did
him the honor to accept. One night
Chickering, after passing them around,
asked how they liked his ciears. Oh, they
all liked them exceedingly well ; they were
fine cigars and they voted Cbickering a
connoisseur.
"'Well,' said the New Yorker, 'they
ought to be good ones. I raised the to
bacco myself, on my farm iv Lewis County,
and on rainy days when he can't do any
thing else my hired man, who is some
thing of a genius, goes into the barn and
rolls up a quantity of tobacco into cigars
and sends them to me.'
"The smoking party didn't say much.
In fact an impressive silence fell upon the
assemblage, and by and by one after the
other edged up to the aoor, opened it, and
tbrew his cigar into the gutter.
"The next evening Cfiickering again
took his seat at the festive smoking board,
and as usual, pulled out a handful of
cigars, which he volunteered to pass
around. But the party concluded it want
ed no more of his Lewis County stogies,
and every man exensed himself by saying
he was already supplied with smoking
material. After that Chickering smoked
his own cigars, being unable to place one
for love or money."â Washington Post.
SOME GOVEBNOES OF OHIO.
Most of Them Have Come to Be Cele
brated Citizens of the United States.
History doea not record any memorable
remark made by an Ohio Governor to the
Governor of either of the neighboring
Statesâ Kentucky and Indianaâ but Ohio
Governors have enjoyed for many years a
peculiar exemption from the disasters of
politica and in many cases have been
favored with great public and official ad
vantages. One of the reasons for the
good fortunes of Buckeye Governors
is found in a clause of the Ohio
State constitution which withholds
from the chief executive the vÂ«to
power. An Ohio Governor can recommend
what legislation he chooses, or he can re
frain from any allusions or suggestions of
the kind in his annual message; but the
entire responsibility for the laws of the
State devolves on the Legislature, or the
General Assembly, as it is called in Colum
bus, and an Ohio Governor is, therefore,
free from political responsibility for such a
measure as the Raines liquor bill, which
Governor Morton signed. Such measures
in Ohio do not reach the Governor for
either veto or approval. The Legislature
Las the whole responsibility.
Going back no further than the year of
the establishment of the Republican party
as a National organization, 1856, it is found
that Ohio Governors have, generally
speaking, come to be celebrated citizens of
the Republic. Salmon P. Chase, inaugur
ated in 1856, was afterward Secretary of
the Treasury, and he was at the time of
his death Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of the Dnited States. William Den
nison, his immediate successor, was after
ward Postmaster-General in President
Lincoln's Cabinet. Jacob D. Cox was
Postmaster-General. Rutherford B. Hayes
served four years as President after the
election of Mr. Tilden. Edward F. Noyes,
the successor of Hayes as Governor
became American Minister to France.
William Allen (Old Bill Allen, or
Fog Horn Bill Allen, as he waÃ some
times called), who defeated General Noyes
in 1873, was Ohio's choice for the Demo
cratic nomination for Presi dent in 1876.
Charles Foster, elected Governor in 1880,
was Secretary of the Treasury under Presi
dent Harrison. Joseph B. Foraker, elected
Governor in 1885, is now United States
Senator-elect from Ohio. James E. Camp
bell, his successor, was the choice of the
Democrats of Ohio for the Piesidential
nomination in 1892, and Campbell's suc
cessor, William McKinlev, is now a promi
nent candidate for the Republican nomi
nation for the Presidency in 189G, and
Ohio's first choice for that office. The
present Governor of Ohio, General Bush
nell. has not as yet developed any political
aspirations in the field of National pol i
tics, bat it is not seriously doubted by
Ohio men anywhere that he may have ex
pectations of political preferment.
In most States north of Mason and Dix
on's line the strength of the Republican
party ia in the farming or country dis
tricts and the preponderance of Democrats
is largest in the Dig cities. This is un
doubtedly so in New York, Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois and
lowa, but it is distinctly not so in Penn
sylvania and Ohio. In the latter State
the farmers are, generally speaking, Dem
ocrats, and most of the rural counties of
Ohio usually give a Democratic majority.
The cities are Republican, and as the po
litical influence of the cities is relatively
larger than the country districts, an ex
planation of the success of the Ohio Re
publicans may be found in this circum
stanceâNew York Sun.

GREAT GAME OF HANDBALL
J. Harlow, the Coast Champion,
Defeats T. F. Bonnet for
a Trophy.
EXCELLENT PLAY WITNESSED.
John Riordan Promptly Challenges
Harlow to Play for the
Championship.
The great game of handball which has
been the sole topic of conversation in
handball circles for some weeks back is
over and J. Harlow, the Coast champion,
has won the $50 trophy and shown that he
is a stayer from start to finish.
Harlow won the Coast championship
without an effort about a year ago as
Riordan, the then holder of the title, re
fused to accept his challenge and he
claimed it by default. Since then there
has been an earnest desire on his own part
and on the part of his friends that some
prominent player should play him for the
championship.
T. F. Bonnet waa generally conceded to
be the one player who had a chance of
wresting the title from him, but nothing
could be done, as Bonnet refused to leave
the amateur ranks. A few weeks ago the
difficulty was got over by Phil Ryan, the
proprietor of the San Francisco court,
putting up a $50 trophy to be presented to
the winner, and the match came off yes
terday afternoon.
The court was crowded with the friends
and backers of both players. Bonnet was
the favorite, and odds of 15 to 10 were laid
upon him. The confidence of his friends
seemed to be well grounded, as he won
the first two games after some brilliant
play on both sides and started in on the
fourth with six aces to his credit.
Harlow pulled himself together and won
the third game, Bonnet being only able to
add one ace to his score of six. Harlow
seemed to have been reserving ail his
strength and dexterity, as he won the
fourth game without Bonnet being able to
score at all. Harlow in the third had
made thirteen consecutive aces and in the
fourth he had added eleven, making
twenty-four aces in all before Bonnet got
a chance. Harlow won the final and the
troDhy, Bonnet only scoring four, and was
loudly applauded.
Bonnet played himself out in the first
two games. Harlow then made the pace
so hot for him that he was not able to re
spond and Harlow, who tossed a great
game, bad it practically all his own way.
At the close of the match the perspira
tion was pouring off Bonnet, but Harlow
was as fresh as a daisy and fit for another
match. Bonnet showed the lack of train
ing, but his pluck during the last three
games won the hearty admiration of the
spectators. It was conceded to be one of
the finest exhibitions of skill and judg
ment ever seen on the coast.
Riordan promptly challenged Harlow to
play for the coast championship, and the
match will take place in the San Francisco
court in two weess.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a match between J. J. Feeney and
Terry McManus and R. Linehan ana P.
Kelly. Each side won a rub and the final
will be played next Sunday.

A VERY QUEER CL&IM.
Rent Demanded for a Corner Jutting
Out From a Building.
The most peculiar lease ever signed will
soon be recorded in the .Registrar's office
says the New York Journal. When it is
filed the public will be officially notified
that the Astor estate has laid claim to a
piece of space up near the clouds, which
will prove a most valuable investment
without any outlay. The details of this
remarkable claim will not be made
known if .the parties to it can
prevent publicity. But the Sunday
Journal has learned enough about it to
serve as a warning to builders and owners
of architecturally beautiful structures.
The claim in question concerns the big
22-story white structure of the American
Surety Company at Broadway and Pine
street. Scarcely had it been finished be
fore an effort is made to find fault with its
construction. This effort is not made by a
poor, underpaid building inspector, but by
the Astor family through their legal rep
resentative.
The Astors own the Schermerborn build
ing, a seven-story office structure, which
adjoins the Surety Company's building
on thetwoi nclosed sides.having a frontage
on Broadway and another on Pine street.
They aro not satisfied with the large rentals
which they now receive from their seven
story building, but have taken a running
jump up eleven stories above their own
roof to the eighteenth story of the Surety
building, and there found a cornice pro
jecting twenty-six inches over their roof
and ground.
Taking advantage of an old English le
gal decision, that a ground-owner controls
the same amount of space up to heaven
and down to hell, the Astors have demand
ed that the Surety Company shall either
remove the cornice which surrounds the
two sides of its towering structure or pay
an annual rental for keeping it there.
The Surety Company was warned at the
lime the cornice was being Duilt that it
wa3 trespassing. Its answer to the warn
ing was that it proposed to have an archi
tecturally beautiful structure and would
not remove the cornice. The legal repre
sentatives of both parties consulted, with
the result that the old Englisn law was
discovered and the Surety Company was
compelled to concede its trespass.
Several months have been spent in the
attempt to discover what space is worth
per square foot up above a roof, and ex
perts differ as to the proper amount. It
was said that the Astor estate would take
$1000 a year for the space, but that this
amount was considered exorbitant by the
Surety Company's officials. They are said
to have offered half that amount for a
period of sixty-six years, which would
make a total of $33,000.
The agent of the Surety Company's
structure is indignant that such extensive
realty owners as the Astors should demand
rent for a cornice which is so far above
the roof of their structure, and which in
no way interferes with or mars the looks
of their own building. He says that if many
more such demands are made upon
owners of big structures, nearly all of
which have cornices projecting on all sides,
there will soon be no more use for archi
tects to make plans having a suggestion of
beauty in them. The claim is said to be
without precedent in real-estate history,
and the payment of a rental by the Surety
Company will open up a new question for
the real-estate lawyers to grapple with.
WOSK OP THE PEENOH ACADEMY.
Endless Dictionary Making It* Chief
Occupation.
The principal occupation of the acad
emy, pursued without cessation and hav
ing in its completion but a perpetual
recommencement, has been the diction
ary. I already hear the exclamation:
"The dictionary! But that is surely a
joke! The academy will never finish it.
After 250 years it has not yet completed
the letter A." I will, therefore, endeavor
to dispel the confusion existing in many
minis. The academy has two diction
aries. One of these, which was begun in
1778, is the "Historical Dictionary," whose
plan was suggested by Voltaire. It is a
complication of etymology and history,
and of the variations in the significance of
words set forth in numerous examples, as
attested by every French writer inclus
ively since the fifteenth century. Al
though this dictionary has in fact only
reached the letter "A," it has been pub
lished in an enormous quarto volume. It
will never be completed. The academy
decided, some twelve years ago, to aban
don the work.
There is, however, besides the "Histori
cal Dictionary," a "Dictionary of Usage,"
wherein are given only the words with
their different acceptations and short and
decisive examples 01 ordinary use. From
1694 to 1878 seven editions of thia work
have been published, each radically differ
ent from the others. Indeed, a language
is constantly subjected to modification.
The sense of one word is altered; another
word is no loneer employed ; still another
is created to meet a new requirement, as
"telegram" or "bicyclet," or a modern
thought must find expression, as "decen
tralization" or "pessimism." It is the
same with orthography, in which the con
stant tendency is toward simplification.
In the seventeenth century one wrote "il
debvoit"; in the eighteenth century, "il
devoit" ; to-day we write "il devait." The
dictionary is framed as a standard, and
hence, like a veritable labor of Penelope,
must be began again as soon as it is fin
ished. In ihe matter of orthography the
dictionary of the academy is an authority
in all institutions of learning, and it would
be almost an impossibility for a nrinting
office to diverge therefrom in spelling.
The otJÃce of the academy is not to
create, but to register words of pure lan
guage and such as are usually employed ;
and while it acknowledges the privilege
of all to create new words, it retains the
right to exclude neologisms from the dic
tionary wherever it may judge them to be
barbarian or of very restricted usage. The
work of this department is carried on by
six members, named for life, who, assisted
by the perpetual secretary, prepare the
work. Each word is next submitted by
the chairman to the approval of the as
sembled academy. The discussions are
occasionally protracted, particularly words
occupying an entire session. â Forum.
The Conquest of a Queen.
General Duchesne says that the Queen
of Madagascar has accepted the French
suzerainty as she might have done the
mastery of a second husband and Prime
Minister. She seems rather interested in
the complete transfer of power from the
ex-Prime Minister to the French, and
showed herself deeply, sensible to the
many courteous attentions of the victors.
General Duchesne thinks' her open
hearted, open-minded, and in : her way a
charming woman. : \ ".: ;, . Y ;'..;.; / . ' ;._.
Another general says she is extremely
fond of dress, and longs to visit Paris. Sho.

Beauty.
A healthy body in woman begets a beautiful form. It gives
the bright sparkle to: the eye, the rose to the cheek. A sickly,
nervous woman is never beautiful. " It is the effervescing, bub-
bling spirit within that brings out the attractive features in : a
woman's form, and all women aim to be attractive. None kno^
better than they how impossible it is to exhibit a beautiful
sparkling eye when the body is racked with ', pain, the spirit
downcast with nervous disorders, and the roses in the cheek
turned into pallor by the killing drain upon the. vital forces.
There is no life in the body, no vim. Female weakness and its
lengthy following of nervous troubles are too common. Women
regain your vital energy, resume your healthy state, get back the
bright eye, the rounded form, the roses of health.

AN OYSTER-HOUSE ABLAZE
Three Thousand Dollar Fire in
the Baltimore Restau
rant.
CAUSED A SECOND ALARM.
Explosion of a Big Kitchen Oil Stove.
The F ames Quickly
Controlled.
There was a $ww maze at 21 and 23
Sixth street early this morning. The
flames shot into the air at first with great
force and the neighbors became frightened
and turned in a second alarm.
The fire broke out in the rear of the
Baltimore oyster-house and restaurant,
run by Alexander Kosta, and the first
alarm was turned in from box 95 at 1:15
o'clock.
The flames nad not fairly started before
they reached the big kitchen oil stove,
which exploded with a big bang and
caused the flames to spread rapidly.
By the time the second alarm was turned
in, however, the firemen were already on
the scene.
They worked hard and fast and soon had
the flames under controJ, but not
until they had spread to the adjoining
saloon at 23 Sixth street, which is run by
Pittlick & Metzler, and also to some frame
shanties in the rear on Stevenson street.
In half an hour the fire was completely
extinguished and most of the companies
were on their way home.
The cause of the fire is unknown. The
total loss will not be more than $3000,
which is fully covered by insurance.
The Pogter in Japan.
Four or five years ago I stopped for the
night at a little teahouse far up in the
mountains of Japan. Nowhere were to bo
seen any railroads, European cast-off
clothing or other "modern improve
ments"; and in a walk through the vil
lage, after a dinner of rice and fish, I was
led to believe that at last a spot had been
found where things were to be as they
always had been.
But oil returning to the village last sum
mer, there stood at the door a little
maiden with a delightful smile of rejoicing
as she proudly showed in one hand an un
mistakable nickel-Dlated American alarm
clock, and in the other an unbroken tin
foiled stick of chewing-gum. Verily our
civilization had arrived.
The next day, however, in a village even
more remote, a still greater surprise
awaited me, for displayed prominently on
a blank wall, with an admiring crowd
about it, was a veritable poster; and a few
more days snowed that this innovation in
arc. if il may be so called, was common
and highly popular.
Every teahouse had its series, and all
the snops in the bazaars were full of them,
and wherever a poster was in sight an ad
miring throng was sure to be seen. A
new style of drawing seemed to go band
in hand with the new idea, and even an
understanding of our perspective was ap
preciable. â "Japanese War Posters," by
D. P. B. Conkling, in the April Century.
Of labor that may be fairly called skilled
the Japanese is probably the cheapest, for
a worker in lacqner or inlaying and mo
saic work will employ skill and knowleagÂ«
that have been inherited and handed down
for generations in return for a wage that
an English bricklayer's laborer would re
fuse with contemptuous disgust.
In many European countries the prac
tice has been adopted of planting nut and
fruit trees in place of merely shade trees
along the highways.DEATH OF JOE FRANKLIN.
In Turn a Sailor, Slaver and
Blockade-Runner and As
semblyman.
CAPIQRED BY A MAN-OF-WAB.
His True Name Was Joseph Franc
Keniâ A Story of Sea Ad
venture.
Last Saturday Joe Franc Keni died Â»t
his residence, 141 Taylor street, of con
sumption. He was better known as Jo
seph Franklin to the sailor boarding-house
Keepers on the front, and around the Latin
quarter among his country people. He
was also known by that name in political
circles, and under that title he served one
term in the Legislature.
Joe Franklin's life would make matter
for an interesting yarn of sea and shore
adventure.
From a little runaway Italian boy
through slavers, blockade-runners, Con-
federate troops and other situations up to
law-maklnjj for a great State is a career as
well rounded out with incidents as the
most adventurous could desire.
To escape a flogging from his father, a
customs officer at Nice, the youngster,
aged about 15, stowed himself away on
board of an American schooner and finally
reached New York.
He soon after shipped as cabin-boy on a
fast-sailing bark named the Julia Dean,
which had been a fruiter between the
Mediterranean and New York City, but on
that voyage she was engaged in a different
trade. The story of Joe Franklin's ad
ventures on the Julia Dean may be given
as told to the writer a short time before
bis death :
We stole dowu to Charleston, B. C, and laid
in a supply of Spanish rum to exchange for
slavesâ the fruit we were after that time. We
had an American crew and American officers,
but we had several Spanish passengers, who
were really the owners of the vessel. We gave
out that we were bound along the African
coast for palm oil and ivory, and anything
except niggers.
One night as we lay at anchor in a little
port on the west coast of Africa we were sur
prised by the old United States sloop-of-war
Vincennes. If we had had any breeze we
could have skipped out, but in the fog that
prevailed the sloop was on to us before we
could stir. But we only knew our predica
ment when it was too late, and you bet we all
looked blue when we saw the boats of the
sloop-of-war drop from the davits and pull
alongside in a jiffy.
Our captain and the Spaniards wore an ex
pression of innocence on their countenances
about as placid and serene as they could mus
ter, but bless you these fellows know better
than to lake soft profes-ions for gospel, and
down tbey'dived into the hold and turned over
everything, for proof that we were nigger
hunting. Tlie rum gave great satisfaction to
some of the ni*n. They fell foul of it and were
soon in a rollicking condition, quite trans
ported beyond notions of discipline and likely
to catch crabs when next they had the oars in
the rowlocks.
However, their hilarity did us no good. A
guard of marines was put on board and the
rum was hoisted up by block and tackle and
confiscated. We had no hand-irons on board
ânothing beyond the rum, beads, calicoes and
muskets to show what were our marauding in
tentions, but, putting one thing and another
together, the captain of the Vincennes con-
Ciaded we were lawful capture and put a prize
crew of thirty officers and men on board. The
officer placed in command was a young fellow,
â who was ordered to take the Julia Dean to Bos
ton, Mass., and we all went back with her as
prisoners.
On our way home our prize crew sighted an
English trader, which they took for another
slaver. So they cnased her in the Julia Dean,
but after overhauling the vessel found out
their mi-take. But one thing occurred to the
advantage of our owners. I don't know why,
but I suppose the commanding officer was
talked over in some persuasive way aud no
body standing by to near the argument fin
ished. Instead of going to Boston, as we had
been ordered, we dropped anchor at Norfolk,
Va.. and that made all the difference for the
owners. At Boston condemnation would
have been sure and certain, ia spite of the
fact that we had no manacles among our
equipment. In fact, we had not had time to
get manacles.
But at Norfolk we had the benefit of the
public opinion of a slave State, and bo the
court looked upon cut voyage as a very dove
like enterprise in the direction of honest com-
merce, and the Julia Dean was returned to her
owners. I suppo-e they had enough to growl
at. for they lost a good deal by the failure of
the trip. Had they got a cargo of slaves they
would have been run down to Cuba and sold
to the planters- I have often wondered how
tney managed to square it with the prize crew,
out it was lucky for them they did not get into
the hands of the Boston abolitiouiste.
That knocked me out of the slave business,
and that I believe was the very last voyage
made in it by an American vessel. When the
war broke out I was in another kind of yen-
tureâ blockade-running in low-lying, fast
steamers, which had come out from the Clyde,
ana were the very craft to Ehow their heels to
any of our cruisers. Why, we thought nothing
of skipping through the fleet lying off Charles
ton. The blotkade-runnero couM steam 14 to
16 know an Hour, and that was a long way
ahead of any speed the men-of-war could
put on.
But we took no chances about being caught
by the guns of cruisers. We kept out of sight
until night came down, and when we made
lor port we kept in close by the land, with
every light out or concealed, and nothing in
fact visible that a cat could see. Even the bin
nacle was covered over with t_c canvas and
only a little hole left In it to peer down upon
the compass. The hulls were all painted jjray,
end we steamed along silently almost within
hailing distance of the cruisers.
In 1865 he came to this coast in a sailing
ship, ami for some time piied his vocation
as a sailor on the Pacific. He finally set
tled down to the more lucrative and more
peaceful life of keeping a water-front board
iny-house. Joe Franklin's active spirit
could not settle itself down to supplying
ships with sailors and himself with their
aivance, and so be took to politics for ex
citement and recreation.
Bill Higgins, whose name was a power
in Republican circles then, was not averse
to Joe Franklin going to Sacramento to
mate laws for the Forty-fifth Assembly
District. So Joe threw himself into the
canvass with his old-time saiior vi<Â»or. He
worked emon- his country people, male
and female, until the entire Latin quarter
loved him more than they did Garibaldi.
It is needless to say his election was a
walkover, and the stowaway boy from the
Mediterranean took his seat in the Capi
tol.
That was ten years ago, and since that
time Joe Franklin has been quietly en
gaged in the sailor boarding-bouse busi
ness. For some time he had been suffer
ing from consumption, and was well
aware that he could not get well.
He was about 52 years of ape, and leaves
a widow. The funeral services will be
held at the late residence, 141 Taylor street,
to-day.

DR. J. L. YORK'S LECTURE.
He Speaks of the True Meaning: of
Agnosticism and Liberalism.
Dr. J. L. York, the Liberal lecturer, last
evening addressed a large audience in
Scottish Hall on the subject of "Agnos
ticism and Liberalism." In the course of
his remarks he said :
Agnosticism and liberalism are twins, born
of freethought, and like the Siamese twins,
they cannot live apart. Their life and mission
are one, to promote mental life in mankind.
The word agnostic means two things, first,
tnat I do not know; second, that beyond, and
outside of my natural sensesâ nothing can be
known.
We are grateful to Professor Huxley for this
word, as it helps men and women to be honest
and not to pretend to know what they do not
know.
Agnosticism Is the beginning of wisdom, be
cause to know that we do not know, and ad
mit it, is to find out our limitations. It opens
the door for knowledge and advancement, as
no one tries to find out that which he thinks
he already knows.
To be an agnostic and not to know anything
is not a credit to any one. To make a full
diet three meals a day ot agnosticism would
be to live on the wind and skim milk. But
agnosticism as the dessert to the full meal is of
great benefit.
Human advancement depends on what can
and must be known and not upon specula
tion about the unknown and unknowable.
Agnosticism is simply a negation or denial
which in its right use stands in the way to
challenge all pretensions. And in connection
with free thought, its mother, and li>x'rali*in,
its twin sister, not only denies the false, but
also shows the truth and leads the way. This
is the true function of agnosticism. It shall
have something to affirm, to refute that which
it denies, and thus becomes a builder of the
new as well as a destroyer of the old id-Is of
thought.
Liberalism Is on the move, and it is highly
gratifying to me to kuow that liberalism under
the name of free churchâ or the church mili
tant, or any other name, so that liberal ideas
are promulgated and humanitarianlsm and
true reform is fostered and pursued, instead of
superstition and priestcraft.
In The Call of last Mondayâ you should all
read itâ we were made happy in reading an ac
count of one of these free churches or
churches militant in Chicago that called Col
onel Ingersoll to address them on liberalism
which he did to an immense audience.
The subjfct matter uttered by the great ag
nostic and the prolonged applause of his senti
ments goes to show that the trend of thought
in that (so called) cn ureh is in hearty sympa
thy with true reform and the religion of hu
manity and liberalism. It also shows that the
bars of orthodoxy and sectarianism are break
ing down and giving way Defore the rising
tide of reason, intelligence and gospel of com
mon sense.
The hope of liberalism is to hasten the day
when men by inteligent co-operation shall as
sert their natural rights to life and happi
ness on a free soil; wnen the grinding wheels
of monopoly shall cease to absorb and control
the natural gifts and advantages of life and
?^* rl t t li Wh t n . Belfishnessftnd will not
eat up the substance oi the tolling, helpless
poor and equality and justice shall characterize
the laws and usage of a better civilization-
hen there shall be no more war and the an wi
of peace and good will shall rule the world,
and woman shall cease to be a slave of super
stition and raise her babes in the lap cf reason
and common sense; when popes and kinÂ«
and priests and thrones shall be no more and
religion consist simply in doing good and a
new faith shall gild our skies with a brighter
hope and promise for mental freedom and the
brotherhood of mankind. cu Â»"i &ua me

The gentle art of the decorator made
Native Sons' Hall very beautiful last even

was abundant effort to make the affair a
success. Entirely surrounding the room
were fancy booths, in which every kind of
attractive merchandise was offered for
sale at ruinously low prices by bewitch
ingly beautiful young ladies.
On the stage there was an attractive pro
gramme, but the curtain did not rise.
Those wishing to enjoy the entertainment
were compelled to pay a small admission
fee and walk behind the curtain. By this
means the ladies hope to obtain a consid
erable sum, which will aid them materi
ally in their most laudable object of caring
for the poor and infirm of their faith.

MANY VEGETARIANS.
Some Thrive en Dates and Others Fat-
ten on Bananas.
We never seem to realize that a large
proportion of the inhabitants of this coun
try are practically vegetarians at the pres
ent moment. It is true that they are com
pulsorily so, but the fact remains. How
much meat can an agricultural laborer's
family have out of a wage of 15s. a week?
If a small quantity of salt pork be occa
sionally eaten, it is of value chiefly as res
piratory food. Yet our laborers, who have
subsisted on this diet for generations, are
strong. In other European countries the
peasantry are still more evidently vege
tarian for all practical purposes. Even in
Russia, according to Prince Krapotkin,
the peasant gets only corn, and not enough
of that sometimes. Yet the Russian peas
ant is not wanting in vigor. The evidence
is the same if we glance at non-European
races. â¢ _
The hardy Arab or Soudanese is satisfied
with his dates, the Zulu with "mealies,"
the Hindu with grains and pulse. The
Japanese have a similar diet, varied occa
sionally with fish. Stanley says of the
Waganda: "Witb the banana plant he is
happy, fat and thriving. Without it he is
a famished, disconsolate, woebegone
wretch." _ Â ,
The Jats of Rajpootana are described as
"a very intelligent, tine race, while both
men and women attain great age. As a
rule the lower classes do not eat meat.
These instances, which might be
multiplied, are quoted to show that
vegetarianism is the ordinary practice
of numerous races which are not
among the lowest, and which show no
sign of race deterioration. In face of these
facts the mere random assertion some
times made that vegetarians are subject
to "poorness of blood" must be taken for
what it is worth. Errors, both of diet and
hygiene, may be committed by vegetari
ans as well as by other people.- Westmin

TO BE VICE-PRESIDENT.
Dr. Anderson Will Be Honored
by the Society of The
osophists.
MYSTEBIOTJS OCCULT LEADER.
The Unknown Adept Who Will Carry
Forward the Work of B avat
sky and Judge.
Dr. Anderson, who is generally con
ceded to be the leading Theosophist of
the Pacific Coa9t, has gone to New York
to attend the annual conclave of Theoso
phists to be held in that city, commencing
April 26. A dispatch from New York de
clares that Dr. Anderson is looked upon
as the probable choice of the convention
for the vice-presidency, and the members
of the local society feel confident of his
election.
Some doubt has been expressed as to the
probable success or of W. Q. Judge as presi
dent of the society. The matter seems
now, nowever, to have been definitely de
cided in favor of Ernest Temple Hargrove,
a young man who lias had rathea a ro
mantic career.
It began at Harrow, in England, after he
had been to several preparatory schools.
At 18 he left the university and studied for
the diplomatic service. A little later he
want to Australia, visiting Tasmania and
making an extended tour through New
Zealand, wbere some time was spent
among the Maoris. He returned home
by way of Ceylon, and became a barrister
of the Middle Temple.
Mr. Hargrove is the second son of James
Sidney Hargrove, one of London's best
fenown solicitors. The name has been for
long time connected with literature, sev
eral members of the family being men
tioned in England's Dictionary of Na
tional Biography as authors of considera
ble repute. His father's family comes
from Yorkshire; on his mother's side he
is Scotch, she being an Aird. The best
known representative of this line has been
lor some years the member of Parliament
for one of the London constituencies.
There is also a righting streak in the
stock, for among his ancestors is such men
as General Hargrove, Governor of Gibral
ter during the war in the early part of the
eighteenth century, and Sir Martin Fro
bisher, who foucht against the Armada.
Mr. Hargrove first heard of theosophy
during the time of the great discussion in
the London Chronicle. He was at a sea
side resort, and saw a placard announcing
a lecture by Annie Besant. He bought
books on the subject, and soon became a
member-at-large. Since then he has been
treasurer of the Blavatsky Lodge, and has
written a good deal for the theosophical
journals.
Axcording to The United Press telegram
received by The Call yesterday morning
there is another personage who could
readily succeed 10 the presidency were he
not bound not to at present disclose his
identity. This mysterious person was
declared to be an adept whom W. Q. Judge
had discovered during his lifetime and had
named, in a document recently brought to
ight, as bis successor. This paper con
tained an injunction that the adept'B name
and identity were to be kept secret for a
specified time, and it is this restraining
clause which prevents the unknown leader
from accepting the exoteric as well as the
esoteric leadership.
Dr. Allen Griffith, Pacific Coast lecturer
of the Theosophical Society, stated that
the appearance of an adept to succeed W.
| Q. Judge was not a surprise to Theoso
phists of the occult body. "The occult
Body," he explained, "is entirely different
from the exoteric body, that part which
the world generally knows and which hold
stated public meetings. The exoteric body
is perfectly democratic. Anyone can join
and members are not required to believe
anything, but they are expected to be
truthseekers. The occult body is some
thing entirely separate and distinct. It
holds the mysteries of the order and con
sists of those so far advanced in theosophy
that they can recognize an adept at sight.
An adept is a person who has reached a
higher plane than that to which human
ity ordinarily rises. They are intrusted
by the Mahatmas with knowledge of oc
cult forces which t hey use, not as you or I
might use them for personal gain, but for
the uplifting of their fellow-men.
About this time of the century, the end
as we reckon time, there is a grand spring
I time in which new truths are born to us.
At just such periods we have received the
great chain of adepts of which Jesus
Christ was an initiate and Plato and Aris
| totle were links. When Mine. Blavatsky
left her body finally, which she could
always do temporarily at will, because her
work was finished, W. Q. Judge, who was
also an adept, took her place as the head
of the occult body. When he died we
knew some one else had taken up the
work, and we did not worry. Whether or
not we now know who it is I cannot say.
The workings of the occult body are
known only to the members, and only
those who have reached the proper stage
of development can become members.
Dr. Anderson was to have addressed the
meeting of the Theosophists last evening
at 320 Post street, but owing to his ab
sence Mercie M. Thurds consented to
speak. Her subject was, 'Our Other
Selves." "No matter how near or how
dear to us others maybe," she said, "there
is always that division between life and life
which we cannot help but feel. The near
est lines are at best like parallel streams,
j sometimes merging thought with thought,
| but always separate." The speaker pro-
I ceeded to show that in the scheme of the
j Great Intelligence there was but one com
j posite life, of which we were each integral
parts, and all other parts were our other
selves. She reasoned that by recognizing
this truth we would eventually realize the
ideal of brotherhood contemplated by re
ligions and fraternities, and man might
hope to be raised to the plane of the adepts.
This view of our other selves, she declared,
would inculcate tolerance, patience and
love.

MARRIAGE AS A FAILURE
Argument of Morrison Swift in a
Sunday Night Lec
ture.
It Is an Institution That Must Surely
Give Way Before the Law
of Change.
"Marriage" waÃ the theme of Morrison
Swift's lecture before the Socialist Society
that meets in Kohler & Chase Hall on
Sunday evenings. He would have none
of it â that is to say, '"marriage."
"The conception of evolution," said the
speaker, "has taught us that we may hope
for improvement in everything. Change
is the law, and the most abiding things
that we are familiar with will change.
We value what we have because it attains
in a measure what the new process that
will take its place will obtain better. We
can tie to nothing, and we must deliver
our minds from attachment to persistent
foi ma.
"One of the most revered institu
tions of civilized life, in theory, is
he familyâ one man wedded to one
woman through life and death, with
children growing about them. The ideal
may range wide within this conception,
but it loses its ideal character if it ventures
beyond. It has not concerned us that this
inflexible marriage system causes many
individuals suffering. To marry once and
only onceâ to separate by divorce un
der no circumstances â one party thinks
almost the summit of the ideal, but it
places another course a little higher, the
entire abstention from marriage, and es
teems this more godly and godlike.
"Out of the Catholic church tiere are
those who acknowledge the sometime de
sirability of divorce, but their edict is that
the divorced persona must never again
marry, and some of this class discrimi
nate against a divorced woman from what
ever cause, holding her to be tainted by
that act or marked as one who from the
beginning was wrong. And provided the
wrong was wholly on her husband's side
the majesty of marriage requires her to be
made an example of and virtually ex
cluded from #ood company as a warning
vto actual wrongdoers who might contem
plate divorce. It is better to ruin the
lives of a few wemen than to lower the
ideal and degrade society.
"We are still in the period of laws, ab
stract, universal, immutable. We care for
the law, not so much for the consequences.
Or if we care for the consequences we
think they depend urxm the certainty and
steruess of the law in its application to
all alike.
"When we test the civilized marriage
system by its effect upon lives we see that
it has not an altogether immaculate rec
ord. Tne life association of a single pair
is defended because it secures a permanent
family, provides best for the children and
develops a higher kind of affection than
any other relation could. Ail that can be
legitimately said of our form of marriage
is that through it the race has attained es
timable and better results than it had pre
viously done.
"It is the latest form and in its conse
quences the best so far. It is not necessa
rily the last form nor the best form, unless
evolution has stopped. A very great error
is to suppose that a form or relation which
has existed among inferior races in past
times, with necessarily low results, is
thereby in itself condemned and is the
cause of the inferiority of these results.
The results are low because races are low.
Falling away from any custom that we
have always seems to superficial minds
tailing back."
The speaker touched upon the question
of children, declaring that the family re
lation hampered and contracted them. He
pleaded for the independence of women and
lor the freedom ot both men and women
from the yoke of the married state where
the relation was unhappy to either or both.
THE IEON DUKE.
An Artist* Recollection of Welling
ton.
When engaged on the two pictures,
"The Queen Receiving 1 the Sacrament"
and ''The Christening of the Princess
Royal," much of my father's time and
money was spent in taking them from one
nobleman's house to another to obtain
sittings, but often to rind, after making an
appointment with a Duke or a Lord, ftrst
that he was encaged, and after waiting for
hours, that he regretted not then being
able to see Mr. Leslie, but would be at his
service on the following day. The Iron
Duke was an exception, and the day after
he received a note from my father I saw
a white-haired elderly gentleman walk
up the short gravel path and steep
steps of our little villa, and shading
his eyes from the sun. take a rapid
survey of the front garden as he
stood on the steps, and, when a
small maid-servant answered his knock
and question, "Is this Mr. Leslie's?" with
"Yes, sir; what name please?" his reply,
in a very clear, loud voice, "The Dook of
Wellington, " nearly made the girl drop
where she stood, and not only brought my
father, palette and brushes in hand, to her
re?cue, but many heads out of the upper
windows of the adjoining villa. Then, be
fore going indoors, he informed my father
and all the neighbors, in the same loud
tone, that the distance between Apsley
House and ours was "rive miles," repeat
ing it more than once, and when my father
ventured to say, "I think not quite so
much, your Grace," he closed the argu
ment with, "Oh, yes, it must be; I'm a
gool judge of distance and consider it cer
tainly over rive miles." The Duke had
come on horseback and was much pleased
when told that my lather would wait upon
him for a sitting at Apsley House, but on
doing so he was received by the Duke with,
"Well, Mr. Leslie, didn't you rind it a long
way?â over five miles, I am sure."
A few days later my father chanced to
mention this to Sir Edwin Landseer, who
knew more of the Duke than he did. Sir
Edwin said : "It is no use to differ with
the Duke; 1 once did about some engrav
ings of my own pictures with which he
was having a room papered, and ventured
to su gest that, as many of them were
valuable proofs, they mierht be attached to
the wall only by paste round the edges, so
that at any future time they could be re
moved without injury. But he cut me
short at once with, 'No, no, that would
not do at all. What Ido is this: I get a
man with a pot of strong paste and a big
brush, and he pastes them all over the
backs, and up they go at once, with no
more bother about them.' " â David Leslie
in Temple Bar.
Celebrating; the Onion.
The nutritious and wholesome onion
occasionally finds its vindicators. At the
thriving Montana city of Anaconda there
is a dining club, called the Anaconda
Onion Society. Its first feast was recently
given with distinguished success.
Down in the center of the hall, says the
Anaconda Standard, was set a long table
with covers for all the guests. At each
plate was a large and juicy onion; in the
middle of the table was an array of meats,
bread, fruit, crackers, cheese and other
things.
At one end of the hall floated the stan
dard of the club in proud conspicuousness.
It consisted of a pole surmounted by a
string of the vegetables from which the
society takes its name. On the wall hung
the motto, beautifully wrought, "In onion
there is strength." Each member wore a
pretty boutonniere of little onions. The oc
casion was greatly enjoyed oy all the par
ticipants, and the society hope to do much
to restore the onion to the Honor and es
teem of the world.
In Montana, as well as on the whole of
the Pacific Slope, the onion attains a de
liciousness of quality which is compara
tively unknown on the Eastern side of the
continent. If the people of the East could
have onions as good as those of Montana
and California it is possible that the Ana
conda Onion Society might find imitators
in the East. â Philadelphia Times.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
When the funding bill is reported the
weather will get warmer very rapidly.
Politics, festivals and business are all
coming at once and spring is on the jump.
In miniug California leads for gold, but
in politics she takes a place in the front
rank for silver.
There will be hardly any change in poli
tics this week except that it will grow
steadily hotter.
The Democrats are so far behind in the
campaign they have not even got a predic
tion bureau in working order yet.
Los Angeles has now a chance to im
prove on Santa Barbara and show other
featival towns how to improve on her.
It is even rumored now that if the Re
publicans of that State would combine
with the Populists they could carry Texas.
Before she gets through with this racket
England may be urging the dervishes to
leave the Soudan boundary to arbitra
tion.
The more the proposition to send a
pledged delegation to St. Louis ia consid
ered the less it seenis worthy of consider
ation.
An unpledged delegation it is easily un
derstood will stand for the interest of Cali
fornia, but what will a pledged delegation
stand for.
As the British expedition up the Nile is
to take balloons with it there is a probable
intention of going higher than was at first
announced.
Having now two wars with the natives
to carry on England certainly has all the
excuse she needs for getting into Africa
with both feet.
It remains to be seen whether Tillman
can Handle his pitchfork as effectively in
Western hayfields as he did in the Con
gressional compost heap.
Perhaps the Virginia Democrats favor
Bayard for the Presidential nomination
because they know that after the election
he never would be missed.
It may be for years and it may be for
ever before we know whether Whitney's
visit to Washington wa3 intended to pre
pare for a circus or a funeral.
It iB not likely the various Democratic
factions will ever get together this year
until they find themselves after the elec
tion dumped into the same hole.
From the way that prominent Senators
Â«re scattering themselves over the country
it ia evident they do not expect anything
big to happen in the Senate very soon.
Sending the California vote to St. Louis
by telegraph would be better than sending
it by a bound up delegation, inasmuch as
it would at least wort the wires a littte.
If Whitney can rouse the Democrats to
stand up and make a straight fight for
free trade and the Cleveland administra
tion we would like to see him get in and
doit.
Republican harmony has now come bo
near including all the members of the
party that it will be an easy thiug for the
malcontents to loyally join in and make it
unanimous.
This is not the first time we have heard
that Huntington had prepared to rush his
funding scheme through Congress, nor
will it be the first time that the rush ends
in a tumble.
There is actually an agitation in Okla
homa to have the National capitol re
moved to that Territory, but of course
gall can't do everything even with the
Government.
There are many things to distract atten
tion at present, but nothing will ever lead
toe people of California to turn their eyes
away from the funding bill tight until the
thing is settled.
As there is a chance the silver men will
control the Democratic convention Horace
Boies is probably getting ready to explain
that his letter of declination was only a
passing despondency and he is feeling bet
ter now.
Clevelajid knows that if he would rec
ognize the independence of Cuba the
House would be with him, the Senate
would support him and the people would
commend him, but it seems he is not cer
tain about Wall street.
A New York physician has broken the
record as a fee earner by drageing a sneak
thief whom he found in his office into a
laboratory where he put him through sev
eral severe tests as to his sanity and then
compelled him to pay $5 for it as a medi
cal examination.
There is no anti-McKinley element
arucng the Republicans of this State any
more than there is an anti-Reed or anti-
Allison element. All ihe Republicans of
the State will be for the nominee of the
St. Louis convention and will loyally
unite in giving him the vote of California
0:1 election day.
UNNECESSARY PLEDGES.
The Oakland Tribune is another leading
Republican paper, besides The Cam,, that
is warning the party in California not to be
hasty in pledging itself to any particular
candidate at the St. Louis convention. It
says :
"It is probable that a majority of the Re
publicans of the State are in favor of the
nomination of McKinley. But they should
go to the convention free to vote for him
or for any other candidate who at that time
may seem most available. With this free
dom the votes of the California delegation
may turn the scale in favor of some suc
cessful candidate. California will be want
ing many things of the next administra
tion. It is assumed that it will be Repub
lican. The delegates will in all probability
attend a President-making convention.
Their influence will be recognized in a
much greater degree if there is freedom to
take advantage of the largest opportuni
ties. It would be an unfortunate circum
stance if the delegation were tied up by
pledges to support some one man, because
such pledges necessarily antagonize all
other candidates. Fortunately, every
name that has been prominently brought
forward in connection with a nomination
is that of a good man. California would be
well served by either of such men as Mc-
Kinley, Reed, Allison, Morton or Harri
son. There may be even a greater num
ber of names before the convention. It
certainly would not be a fortunate circum
stance, if, by reason of pledges, the delega
tion from this State were compelled,
through thick and thin, to stand by an un
successful candidate."
The Tribune is perhaps correct when it
says that probably "a majority of the Re
publicans of the State are in favor of the
nomination of McKinley." The brilliant
author of the bill which expressed the sen
timent of the Republican party on the
subject of protection eminently deserves
the admiration of every Republican. If
elected, as he surely would be if nom
inated, he would make as able and patri
otic a .President as the country can pro
duce. He would be an honor to the whole
people and to his party.
As the Tribune points out, the Republi
cans are reasonably sure of victory in the
coming election. The oversha<l owing con
sideration with us is the needs of this State
and this extraordinary opportunity to de
mand their recognition at the hands Of a
great party sailing to a victorious port.
To run the risk of antagonisms whicu
pledges might create is a step that we
cannot afford to take. If there were any
question that the other candidates ad
vanced for the nomination were inferior
to Mr. McKinley in patriotism, ability or
Republicanism the situation would be dif
ferent. If it were simply a question of
electing him or having a Democratic
President it would be right that all Re
publicans should unite upon his selection.
But that is not the situation. What we
shall most surely have is a Republican
President. What we should do is to
secure the greatest possible advantage
from the opportunity. No one candidate
can be sure of the nomination. A pledge
to support any particular candidate would
certainly be taken as a challenge to all
other candidates. Every intelligent Re
publican aware of our needs and of the
value of this opportunity may now ask
himself if he has the right to run the risks
and invite the antagonisms which a pledge
would provoke.
BATES AND FUNDING.
Those American citizens, in and out of
Congress, who seem to think that the set
tlement of the railroad debt to the Gov
ernment is a "simple business proposi
tion," involving the sole question Of ex
tending the time for an embarrassed cred
itor to make settlement, might read with
interest and profit the result of the con
convention of freight agents recently held
in Milwaukee. These gentlemen, after a
careful study of the question of overland
transportation rates, have framed a sched
ule advancing present west-bound rates
more than 50 per cent, with a correspond
ing advance on east-bound rates for the
leading products of California. In taking
this action they have considered only tne
delay necessary in putting the new rates
into effect. One of the delays is that of
ten days' notice to the Interstate Com
merce Commission.
The rate war of 1892 reduced west-bound
charges to 40 per cent of the rates thereto
fore prevailing. This was caused by the
competition of the Panama Railway.
Upon this 40 per cent, according to the
published statement of the general freight
agent of the Bouthern Pacific Company,
an average raise to 65 per cent of the orig
inal rates has been made, which is a raise
of over 63 per cent on existing rates. That
is to say, the railroads west of the Missouri
River, acting in concert and enabled to
do so by the arrangement which Mr.
Huntington has made for removing the
competition offered by the Panama Rail
way, can entirely upset and readjust the
commercial conditions of California and
the whole West, and in doing so exhibit a
power infinitely greater than that which
the Government of the United States is
able to exercise. What private, commun
ity, State or regional interests may be
wrecked or advanced by this violent over
turning of an established order of things
upon which present conditions are based
are matters that have not received the
slightest attention from the combined rail
roads making this advance.
' It might be argued that even though the
President should exercise his clear prerog
ative and foreclose the Government mort
gage on the debtor roads, the possible pur
chasers would be as likely as the present
owners to enter into just such a revolu
tionary combination as has been thrust
upon us. But such an argument would
leave out of the account the fact tbat the
roads, under foreclosure sale, might pass
out of the hands of their present owners,
whose sole policy is to strengthen monop
oly by combination and to squeeze every
dollar in sight, without regard to an in
creased traffic and larger profits possible
under a liberal policy, and might fall into
the hands of owners who realize that the j
best results come from fostering develop
ment by offering encouraging rates.
Under the new airangement the Central
Pacific is enabled to say to the opponents
of the funding bill in Congress that in ad
dition to the money-earning power which
it enjoys as a monopoly, it has secured the
co-operation of all other transcontinental
lines, and that by raising its rates to a
figure which will prohibit the develop
ment of the West it will be able to dis
cbarge its Government debt under the
terms of the funding bill. Tnis will be
placing the interests of the aided roads im
measurably above those of the country.
Whether that is the desire of Congress is
something that the people at large would
be glad to know.
AN IBBEGTJLAR MAIL.
The Eureka Stntidard calls attention to
thft irregularity of the overland mail ser-
Tice, which entails so grievous and unjust
a hardship upon the people of Humboldt
and Mendocino counties. It is learned
from other sources that sometimes it re
quires eight days for paper mail to reach
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1596.
Eureka and the contiguous region from
San Francisco. This is outrageous. The
Standard says in explanation: "The pri
mary trouble is that tne mail contractors
took the contract at such low figures that
no money can be made." As a conse
quence, when a drummer appears with his
trunks and pays compensatory fare the
bulky part of the mail is left behind for a
later trip. A succession of drummers
means an indefinite postponement of all
heavy mail forwarding.
The situation is made clear when it is
reflected that the mail has to be carried by
team over mountain roads for long dis
tances, there being no railroad connection
with the dense population centering on
HumboldtÃay. In that region great en
terprises have sprung up. including lum
ber, dairying, farming and mining. It iÂ§
one of the richest and most inviting sec
tions of California, and it stretches all the
way from I'kiah to Eureka. It is develop
ing with great rapidity, a necessary result
of its splendid resources and attractions.
The bulk of the residents are persons of
brains, means and enterprise, who have
gone thither to carve their fortunes out of
the undeveloped wealth that lies ready to
their hands. They need and demand an
adequate mail service with the great world
which lies beyond their environing moun
tains and they are entitled to consider
ation.
In explanation of the present shameful
mail service the Standard says: "Aeon
tractor binds himself to do a certain thing,
and because he has made a mistake 30,000
people have to suffer. Is there no redress,
no remedy for this state of affairs? Hum
boldtCounty has3o,ooo people who are eager |
to learn what the people of other sections
are doing, and they are prohibited from the
enjoyment of this right by a contractor
who either through ignorance or greed
made a b'g mistake. The people of this
county did not have anything to do with
awarding the contract or asking the con
tractor to accept it, and tbe Standard is of
the opinion that they should not suffer.
Something should be done to remedy the
wrong."
It gives The Call pleasure to second
this protest and to demand a remedying of
the wrong at which it is aimed.
THE OEANGE OEOP.
Secretary Dreher of the Fruit Growers'
Exchange announces the following facts:
That the orange season in Southern Cali
fornia has practically closed, only a few
late varieties remaining; that the ship
ments have been 5437 carloads; that
first - class navels have brought as
much as $2 95 a box, and that a great
many carloads sold in Southern California
for $2 60 a box. Growers who received
$2 50 a box cleared $1 30 after paying
every expense, including interest, taxes
and labor. As each acre produces from
200 to 300 boxes, many of the older groves
running to 500 boxes, it is easy to compute
the handsome profits that have been real
ized from the industry this year. And yet
it was only a few years ago that the cry
of overproduction was raised. Growers
could not sell, "the market was glutted."
Millions of oranges rotted on the ground,
valuable properties were lost and planting
ceased. Then the growers organized,
found an eager and inexhaustible Eastern
market that had never heard of their
products, and are now prospering amaz
ingly.
Similar results have been secured in the
region lying north of Tehachapi Pass.
Here a stretch of foothill country over 300
miles in length is gradually being dotted
with orange orchards, for it is perfectly
suited to that industry, being above the
frost level of the valleys. Oranges thrive
as far north as Anderson, the extreme
upper end of the Sacramento Valley. As
the winters in this northern stretch are
colder than in Southern California the
ripening of the fruit is hastened, and this
enables the northern growers to reach the
Easiern market early and secure high
prices on that account. The oranges of
Oroville arrive at New York ahead of
those from any other part of the world.
The splendid results of orange culture
have been secured solely through the in
telligent co-operation of the growers.
The wine industry, like the orange, was
practically a failure before the growers
organized and found a market. The raisin
industry is being similarly rehabilitated,
and the recent action of deciduous fruit
growers toward concert of action in the
Eastern market assures equal profits for
ensuing crops.
COAST EXCHANGES.
Whether or not the gifted editor of the Red
lands Citrograph meant to be facetious when he
wrote the following paragraph may never be
known, but the fact remain* that he has made
a suggestion that carries as much wisdom as
fascination. He says:
It strikes us that the owners of the huge salt
mines over on the desert north of here are derelict
in their duty to suffering humanity In that they
do not use the big blocks quarried from the mines
us material with which to build sanitariums. It
Is well known that salt is antiseptic and death to
most disease germs. Houses built of salt would
naturally be highly aseptic and the rock salt over
there is so hard that it makes splendid building
material. Hurry up the first natural rock salt san
itarium and advertise it as a blessing to suffering
humanity.
The Stockton Independent publishes an ac
count ot two ten-mule teams loaded with
freight at Stockton tor Modesto. The load con
sisted of 40,000 grain bags, consigned to Orrie
McHenry, the Modesto banker. The entire
number of bags to be transported is 100,000.
Our contemporary says:
The railroad company's rate on jute bags from
Stockton to Modesto in carload lots is 14 cents per
hundred, or $2 80 per ton; the distance is about
thirty miles, and can easily be covered by teams
In a day. The load taken on the four wagons
amounts to about twenty tons, the freight rates on
which would be $66, and on the whole shipment
of fifty tons of jute tags alone would be (140 in
freight rates saved to the farmer.
It seems incredible that team freighting over
the wretched roads of the San Joaquin can be
done more cheaply than by the Southern
Pacific Company. The Independent adds the
following astonishing news:
'beaming to Modesto is not a new thing, and at
present fully two-thirds of the freight shipped out
of Stockton to Modesto goes that way lv prefer
ence to rail. The freight team on the street of
Stocktou is becoming almost as familiar a sight as
it ever was in the greatf days of teaming to thÂ«
southern mines. In speaking on the subject yes
terday afternoon, Manager Welsh of the Crown
Mills stated that for several months nearly every
pound of Hour that has (one from the Stockton
mill to Modesto has gone by team. The rate on
flour for the thirty miles over the railroad is $3 lio
a ton, and there Is the haul from mill to train and
from train to store by team beside.
The need of the new railroad now being
pushed through the valley seems to be fully
demonstrated.
The Concord Sun is still calling attention to
the benefits to be reaped by any company that
will establish a fruit cannery at that place. It
saye:
Tberc are several thousands of acres between
Concord and Clayton and Concord And Danville In
fru lt-bearing orchards, all of which fruit, If re
tained here for canning purposes, would sustain a
very extensive cannery. This settles the matter
as to the fact of enough tree fruit growing here to
furnish a cannery. Then acatn the large amount
of berries and vegetables that would be raised here
if such an Industry were established would give a
cannery a greater guaranty of prosperity.
This is but one of many opportunities for the
profitable employment of capital In California.
The Modesto Herald publishes a spiritedlet
ter from Oakdale which contains the follow
ing:
uakdale to-day, without doubt, 1b the best busi
ness town In the county. The streets are thronged ,
with people, and they are mostly strangers who
have purchased property here or in the imme
diate vicinity. There is uo doubt, in my mind that
Oakaale has the brightest prospects of any town
this part of the State. Taking into consideration
the excellent facilities for irrigating the land sur
roundine Oakdale for miles on either side, it is
plain that the country is going to build up Oakdale
and not Oakdale build up the country, hence one
can readily appreciate the very flattering future of
our town.
The Alameda At gut indirectly calls attention
to one of me most delightful sources of health
and pleasure lying ready to the hands of the
people hereabout. It is a familiar fact that
within recent years a summer outing in house
boats on the bay of San Francisco has become
a regular thing. From the primitive affair of
first effort we are advancing to elegance and
luxury. Our contemporary says that George
N. Blanchard of the Spring Valley Water Works
has sold his old "ark" and has decided on plans
for a new one to cost $2000. The hull is to be
eighty feet long and thirty-four feet wide and
will carry a two-story housu containing eight
or nine rooms and fitted with hot and cold salt
water baths, a bowling alley and electric
lights. This will be the largest floating house
on the bay.
The San Bernadino Sun announces another
of the important discoveries that are con
stantly being made in California. It says:
Hues Thomas and John Wood returned to this
city Bunday night after a two months' prospect
ing trip on the desert. TlÂ»ey bring the news that
they made a valuable discovery on their trip In the
shape of a deposit of borax, five acres in extent
which they found about sixteen miles north of
Barstow, and as evidence of the verity of their
stnry they bring with them some samples of the
rock, which assays 7 per cent better than that
taken from the mlno of the Pacific Coast Borax
Company at Calico, and 60 per cent better than
that mined in Deata Valley.
While many of the larger cities of the State
are holding the public attention with their
fiestas and rose carnivals, it is pleasing to read
in the Mountain View (Santa Clara County)
Register that the ladies of the Library and
Exchange in that place are preparing to hold a
rose fair there on the 23d and 24th inst. There
will be an excellent programme, including a
drama, tableaux and music.
The Riverside Enterprise is calling attention
to the profi ts derivable from the cultivation of
canaigre. Says our exchange :
It ii a very profitable crop when Intelligently
handled, as has been demonstrated by experi
ments. No finer soil for its cultivation and t>ropa
gation can be found than the decomposed granite
and sandy loam of Riverside County. Returns
can be had in a few months from the time of
embarking In the business of growing it. And a
market can be found for it right here without the
expense of shipping long distances.
Guadalupe, Santa Barbara County, is feeling
the new impulse of progress. Evidence of its
advancement is thus given by the Standard:
"What a wonderful change since the first of
the yearâ graveled streets and sidewalks, a
new $10,000 school building, and now comes
a new brick block on the main street."
According to the San Diego Sun the newly
organized Citizens' Traction Company of that

The Fresno Republican says that a new day

to rejuvenate the place.
The oil wells at Coaiinga, Fresno County,
says the Fresno Republican, are promising a
handsome yield. One well is down 590 feet
and is producing forty barrels of oil a day. The
other is 540 feet and is to be carried down to
1200 feet. Says our contemporary:
The most remarkable thing connected with the
district is that the oil is of the best quality pro
duced in the United States. The theory of geolo
gists has been that no first -class coal or oil would
ever be found on this coast, because the forma
tions' are not old enough. But theories count for
nothing at Coaiinga. Compared with the best oil
produced anywhere else on this coast the Coaiinga
| product is as 62 to 17. A manufacturing company
j of San Francisco, which use* in Its business a high
grade of oil, which it Imports from Peru, in South
America, because it cannot obuUn it in the United
States, was sent a gallon of the Coaiinga oil. After
putting It to the test it was declared equal to the
Peru oil.
Another San Francisco company which uses
aSOO barrels of crude oil each month for fuel in its
firebrick kilns has tented the coaiinga product,
! and says that 1200 barrels of it will go aa far as
i 2500 barrels of the other. An offer has been made
j by a company to ersci a refinery on the ground
and buy the entire output at $2 60 a barrel. This
is an exceedingly high price, and is two and a half
times more than the Los Angeles oil sells for. The
oil tlo-.vs from the well without the aid of a pump.
Experts in the business predict that a much
greater flow will be struck. Tanks have been pro
vided for saving the oil, and others will be taken
to the wells Â»s needed.
Later news from the Republican is to this
effect:
News reached Fresno yesterday that the 600
--| fool well at Coaiinga is improving dally. After
| being plugged several days It was opened, and
thirty-five barrels flowed out in an hour and a
quarter.
That Nevada is awake to the new order of
things is evidenced by this announcement in
the Virginia Chronicle:
Lina Is the name of the new town which has Just
hÂ°en organized on the Nevada side of the Stale
Line district. It is l-ut a few hundred feet on the
Nevada side, but affords the best location for a
townsite to be found thereabouts, as all the min
ing claims nearly can r>e made tributary to it.
The Log Angeles Journal gives this important
information:
A full corps of engineers and surveyors has been
pnt Into the field at Â£1 Paso, beyond the frontier,
and they are now heading toward the Pacific
Coast. This means that the Sierra Mad re Trunk
line, known as the Gulf, Rio Grande and Pacific
Railway, intends to build a transcontinental line
through Northern and Central Mexico. The El Paso
Telegram and Mexican Herald have given consider
able space to the project, holding that It Is destined
to be an important factor In the development of
rich mineral and timber regions in Mexico. The
new railway alto has a direct significance for the
whole Pacific Coast. It will open a wonderfully
rich and fertile country now awaiting settlement
and development, and at the same time bring that
region tntocommunlcatlon with San Diego. Much
of the business in freighting down there now
passes down the eastern declivity of the Sierra
Madras and is absorbed by St. Louis and Western
and Eastern cities, the Mexican Central and Mexi
can International lines diverting the traffic from
California. With the new road In operation the
remunerative business of the mines already In
operation and industries yet to be started will be
done with the Pacific Coast, to the exclusion of
Kastern competitors.

THE VICE-PRESIDENCY.
The hated opposition has not gone so far as
to get out a Vice-Presidential campaign but
ton for Mr. Reed.â Washington Post.
You can't induce politicians to take into ac
count that there is importance in the Vice-
Presidency while they are nominating a Presi
dent, and it is no use to make the attempt to
do so.â Boston Herald.
Those newspapers which affect to regard the
Vice-Presidency with a feeling of contempt are
evidently ignorant of the splendid galaxy of
statesmen who have not deemed it beneath
their dignity to occupy that station.â New
York Commercial Advertiser.

Chauncey Depeir on California.
New York Tribune.
California is without a doubt the most beau
tiful part of the world that I have ever seen,
and I have been pretty much all around. At
this time of the year the ooontry is all in blos
som and bloom. The winter there is about
like our fall, and the summers, while hot, are
not uncpmfortaDle, owing to the dry atmos
phere, and the nights are always cool. It sel
dom rains therÂ», and the climate is almost
ideal. What surprises me is that every one
with a little capital has not gone to California
to live. San Francisco is a bustling city, and.
while there is not the same air of hurry and
stir of action that there is in the East, where
there are large manufacturing interests, the
people are wideawake and energetic.

A LEANING CHIMNEY.
There is a chimney on the Presidio reserva
tion that keeps an upright position when, ac
cording to all accepted laws of gravitation it
should be lying in a heap on the ground. It is
one of the chimneys of the old blacksmith-shop
on the road to Fort Point and presents a gro
tesque appearance. It is about twenty feet
high and three feet square and leans over so
badly that one expects it to fall each moment.
The blacksmith-shop stands close to the bay
shore, and during the last storm the waves
undermined one side of it, so that the building
is now a total wreck. There are three forges
A Chimney That Refuses to Obey the
Laws of Gravitation.
[From a sketch.]
in the building and the one nearest the water
suffered the most from the action of the waves.
The earth and sand under one side of it were all
washed out so that it sank several inches.
The strange thing is that the chimney did
not go to pieces, but the bricks have held to
gether as if they were glued. When the forge
sunk out of plumb the chimney of course went
a proportionate distance out of the perpendi
cular. But somehow it shows no disposition
to fall over.
If chimney and forge were one piece there
would be nothing remarkable about its retain
ing an upright position, ub the centerof weight
is within the base of the forge. But, being
made of many small pieces, the chimney is
practically a separate structure Bet on top of
the forge and the center of its weight is sev
eral Inches outside of its base.
Most chimneys fall over long before they
reach the limit, as the jarring caused by their
being thrown out of plumb loosens the bricks.
The only possible explanation of the reason
the chimney in question does not tall is that
(he bricks "stick" together. It maybe that
they were laid in cement instead of mortar.
LADYS NIGHT ROBE.
Night robes made in the old-fashioned sack
shape, with large sleeves and a big collar, are
very pretty and have the advantage of requir
ing less material than other shapes. The back
may be made with a bias seam, which avoids
piecing at the bottom and cuts to better ad
vantage. The ease with which these gowns
may be laundered recommends them to many.
Lounging or bath robes are cut after the
same model, being liked, as they are less
bmty than those with pleats or gathers at the
top.
Batiste is the material used when any nice
gowns are made.' A sailor collar 19 made of
fine Hamburg edging, which is seamed from
all the corners to the neck, to bring all the
scallops around the edge.
White lawn is also used and with a collar of
the same, trimmed on the edge with an inser
tion of Valenciennes lace, and beyond this a
ruffle of the plain lawn or of embroidery is
very dainty. A collar with embroidery set on
with braiding through which delicate colored
ribbons are drawn is also pretty.
These gowns may be made quite elaborate by
tucking the goods down the bacfc and front,
and also tucking the sleeves.
Heavy nightgowns of flannelette or heavy
muslin cannot be better made than in this
style. The collar may be made of China silk
for flannelette gown, to give a dainty touch,
for the silk wears quite as well as the flannel
ette.

HIS ANSWER.
(To Her Leap Year Proposal.)
â Be your husband?" Why this is so sudden,
You really have given me a start!
I never imagined one moment
That such was the state of your heart
I certainly hoped that you liked me,
But merely, of course, as a friend;
I never had dreamed our flirtation
Could come to so serious an end!
And oh, I'm sorry it happened I
It grieves me to give you such pain.
Since I really and truly must tell you
That your hopes are entirely vain.
But though I can ne'er be your husband
1 don't undervalue your charms,
I'm willing to be your big brother,
And even a " brother In arms!"

OF IMPORTANCE TO POPULISTS.
Tularo County News.
We again desire to call the attention of Pop*
nllsts, throughout the Pacific Coast, to the lib*
eral policy presented by the San Pranolico
Call in devoting space to the free expression
of the views of able reform writer* In its ool
nmns. While The Call is thoroughly Repub
lican in politics it is not of that narrow.
minded variety so noticeable in other leading
dailies. We have published some of these arti
cles from the pen of Joseph Asbury Johnson,
one of the brainiest reform writer* on the
coast, but our space precludes the publication
of many others which we are anxious our
readers should peruse.
Should The Call continue Its liberal course
during the present campaign we would advise
Populists generally to take that paper in pref
erence to others possessed of less liberality.
We have not noticed Tmc Wbek.lt
Call to ascertain whether these articles
appear in it or not, but If they do
Populists in the country who are so situated
as to be unable to take a dally paper should
give their preference to The Webklt Call,
and thus not only enable themselves to enjoy
the advantages of this department of that
paper, but to encourage its commendable
course.
The People's party Is greatly in need of a
newspaper, giving all the current newt, but
in the absence of such paper should take ad
vantage of the next best thing to be hadâ
which is, the old party paper giving their
cause the fairest treatment.

DID FLYNN OWN
THE SATCHEL ?
The Police Have So Far
Failed to Establish
This Fact.
ASSERTS HIS INNOCENCE
The Accused Man Repeats His
Old Story of Platonic
Friendship.
MRS. BENJAMIN'S STATEMENT.
Mrs. Browning's Landlady Now Hints
Vaguely at Things Yet
to Bs Told.
The mystery surrounding the abandoned
child found on Mission street, near
Twelfth, last Monday night, seems as far
from solution as ever. That Mrs. Brown-
The Sunday Morning Service of the Latter-Day Saints at Metropolitan Temple. The Mormon Choir.
[Sketched by a "Call" staff artist.]
ing is the mother of the infant there is
no doubt, but even the detectives are not
satisfied that Flynn, the reputed father,
is alone responsible for its death.
The accused man continues to present a
bold but not by any means defiant front.
He appears to be firm in the belief that
something wili ultimately turn up to
prove his innocence, though from what
quarter this is to come he does not now
know.
Mrs. Browning and her sister, Mrs.
Shane, refuse to see all visitors. A Call
reporter visited the former at her home,
130)4 Ninth street, yesterday, but suc
ceeded in seeing only the landlady, Mrs.
Benjamin. This lady was visibly dis
turbed over the unpleasant notoriety into
which she finds her establishment plunged.
Just what she knows of anything could
not be learned, but her evasive answers to
numerous questions revealed the possi
bility of her telling a great many things
not now down on the calendar.
"I don't care to talk now," she said. "In
fact, I won't talk except before the Coro
ner's jury. There is plenty of time for
me to tell all I Know, or rather anything
I might know."
"Did you see Flynn on the night of Mrs.
Browning's confinement?" was aeked.
"No, I did not, 1 ' was the answer. "In
fact, I hardly know him. Mrs. Shane is a
regular visitor here, but of that I don't
care to speak at present."
"It is thought that the satchel in which
the baby was found came from this
house," was ventured. "Do you know
anything about its being given to Flynn
or Mrs. Shane?"
â¢'I told you that I did not see Mr. Flynn
that night," replied the landlady some
what angrily. "As for Mrs. Shane, that is
another matter. Only before the Coroner
will I tell what 1 know."
"Then it is to be inferred that the satchel
did come from here and that â "
"Well, people can infer what they please.
I have been instructed not to talk and I
don't propose to do it except in a legal way,"
and with that Mrs. Benjamin burst into a
flood of tears, the echo of which followed
the reporter down the long flight of stairs
and into the street.
Over the proprietorship of the satchel
containing the new-born child of sin seems
to hang the guilt or innocence of Flynn.
The police have so far failed to establish
his ownership and on this fact Attorney
Knight depends largely for the acquittal
of nis client.
Mrs. Goldstein, who keeps the lodging
house at 51 Third street, at which place
Flynn occupied a room for two months
preceding the birth and desertion of the
child, yesterday corroborated Flynn's
statement to the effect that he had paid
her a balance of $2 and removed two va
lises from the house at about 8 p. m. on
last Monday evening.
In a pawnbroker's office at 117 Third
street there is a record of a loan of $3 ad
vanced to John F. Flynn, for which two
satchels were taken as security on the
same evening and at nearly the same
hour. These satchels Mrs. Goldstein can
identify, as they are the same tnat she
held as a pledge for the payment of the
room lent, and they are the only valises
she saw in Flynn's possession during his
stay at her house.
"It seems to me," said FJynn last night,
"that it would be an easy matter for the
detectives to trace the ownership of the
valise or satchel. I only had two, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1896.
they are both in pawn Jdown on JTbird
street. Now if I had bought another at
any of the second-hand BtoreÃ, or else
where, there should be no great difficulty
in establishing the fact.
"That valise came from Mrs. Brown
ing's room, or was furnished the sister by
some one in the lodging-nouse. When
the whole story is fully known it will be
seen that lam innocent of any crime. I
reached home about 3 o'clock last Tuesday
morning, and can prove it by my boy and
the clerk at the lodging-house. From
what I can hear of the. child, and the con
dition in which it was found, it could
hardly have lived in all that cold until the
early morning. In due time my inno
cence will be established, but just how I
cannot now say."
Detective Gibson is authority for the
statement that Flynn borrowed $25 from a
friend in order to have Mrs. Browning
undergo an operation at the hands of a
well-known physician of this City. Dr.
Quigley pronounces the child born last
Monday night to have been of only seven
and a half months' development. This
seems to corroborate, in a measure at
least, the statement of Detective Gibson.
Mrs. Shane will to-day move from her
quarters on Larkin street to a cottage at
Wl7 Eddy street.
It iB hardly probable that the Coroner's
inquest will be held to-day, as Dr. Quigley
stated last night that Mrs. Browning
would not be able to attend.
Van New Seminary Changes Hands.
An important move in edncational circles
has just been consummated by which Van
Ness Seminary, one of the best known private
schools for girls in San Francisco, passes under
the principalship of Miss Sarah D. Hamlin and
Mrs. Edna Snell Poulson of this City. Dr. and
Mrs. Willey retire from all activity in the con
duct of the school, but their daughter, Mrs.
Pray, remains in charge of the boarding de
partment. Under the new arrangement the
seminary will be known as Miss Hamlin's
school. Miss Hamlin and Mrs. Poulson are
both well known as educators on the const,
and their connection with the school is guar
anty that it will maintain high name among
the institutes of learning in this City.
SUICIDE OF A CARPENTER.
Jacob Scharertzo Shoots Himself While
in a Fit of Despondency.
Jacob Scharertze, a carpenter living at
5 Douglass street.committert suicide yester
day afternoon at 6 o'clock by shooting
himself through the head. The only
reason that his wife and brother-in-law,
J. Moyer, could assign for the act was that
the deceased became despondent Dy reason
of nis failure to procure work. He had
been trying for the past two and a half
months to obtain work, but failed, and in
consequence became depressed in spirits.
Deputy Coroner J. E. O'Brien, on investi
gation and from the statement made by a
neighbor named Pigeoree, who, on hear
ing the report of the pistol, rushed into
the cottage where the act had been com
mitted, was satisfied that a determined
suicide was the cause of death and allowed
tne body to remain at the residence.
THREE NOTED JAPANESE
President of a College, a Profes
sor and a Clergyman Ar
rive Here.
They Are Delegates to the General
Methodist Conference in Cleve
land.
Three distinguished Japanese arrived on
the Gaelic yesterday from the land of the
j chrysanthemum. They are not warriors
like Marshal Yamagata ana his party that
preceded them, but at home are high in
the profession that preaches "peace on
earth and good will toward men" ; they
are Japan's best representative clergymen
sent as her National delegates to the Gen
eral Metnodist Conference that opens at
Cleveland, Ohio, on May 1.
The party consists of the Rev. Y.
Honda, president of the Anglo-Japanese
College at Tokio; Dr. E. Asada, professor
of Old Testament exegesis in the same col
lege, who, in addition to being a graduate
of the Garrett Bible Institute of North
western University, Illinois, bears the dis
tinction of being the first person on whom
a degree was ever conferred by the Uni
versity of Chicago; and the Rev. Mr. Ipia
of the United Brethren Church of Japan.
Soon after their arrival they prepared to
resume at once their chosen work as min
isters of the Gospel, and last night fbund
them addressing the" congregation of the
Japanese mission on Post street.
They were met upon their arrival at the
Occidental by the Rev. Dr. Harris, the
head of the Japanese missions of t:.is
State, who had during his own long mis
sionary life in Japan formed the acquaint
ance of President Honda of the Tokio
college.
They spoke to their countrymen last
night in their mother tongue, as the la/ge
congregation was composed entirely of
Japanese young men, drawn together by
their clannish patriotism and their com
mon desire to avail themselves of every
opportunity to learn in this country.
The party will remain here but a few
days before continuing the journey to the
meeting-place of Methodists from all over
the world. I
DOCTRINE OF THE SAINTS.
Metropolitan Temple Thronged
to Hear the Mop
mons.
JOSEPH SMITH'S PROPHESIES.
Elder Heber J. Grant of Salt Lake
Makes an Elcquent
Appeal.
Whatever may be said of the Mormon
church it does not lack for sweet music
and simple eloquence, yesterday it did
not lack, even in this City, for a great fol
lowing.
Metropolitan Temple, where there was
an open religious meeting, had, from the
front row of the auditorium to the outer
row of the gallery, not a seat to spaxe.
The choir occupied all the space of the
stage except tne reserved center for the
speakers.
Possibly it was the opportunity to hear
the famous choir without cost that called
the big congregation together. Whatever
it was there was no evidence that any
came to scoff. The meeting was one of the
best conducted and altogether successful,
as religious meetings go, in the history of
such in this City.
Heber J. Grant had come all the way
from Salt Lake City to make the address-
When he got through â at nearly 1 o'clock
â he had at least enlisted the sympathy if
he had not won the faith of his big audi
ence. Once it gave him a sudden and sus
tained burst of apolause.
Elder Henry S. Tanner, president of the
California Mission, presided. In a brief
address of his own, preliminary to the
introduction of Elder Grant, he said: "In
calling you together here, and in working
daily in your midst, we seek only your
good, the redemption of mankind. We ask
you to listen to the doctrine of redemption
;as we understand it. The Church of Jesus
! Christ of Latter-day Saints has been
i much maligned and misunderstood. Our
: reputation is not our character. We ask
you to take note of our character, the lives
j we lead and tne professions we make, and
] judge us by these rather than by what our
enemies or the misinformed may say of
us."
The opening remark of Elder Grant was
an indorsement of this statement and a re
iteration of that which declared the pur
pose of the church and this meeting to be
the redemption of men. He looked for
ward to the time when the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints â he
called it nothing else in his entire address
â would convert the world.
It was impossible, he said, to give more
than the briefest outline of the tenets of
the church in a single address. He ran
through the articles of faith, with brief
comments. The Latter-day Saints believe
in the Bibleâ believe in it too strictly for
many, he said. Henry Ward Beecher had
been quoted as saying, "if one is to take
the Bible literally he had better join the
Mormon church." In that Mr. Beecher
spoke truly.
"We also, however, believe in the Book
of Mormon as presented by Joseph Bmith,"
said the speaker. "We believe in God, the
Eternal Father, his son Jesus Christ and
the Holy Ghost. We do not believe that
these three are one.
"We believe that all men may be saved
except those who once having received the
light shall deny God.
"We believe that souls may be saved
after death by vicarious effort in their be
half. Those who deny this must deny the
first article of faith in the Christian reli
gion. For Christ died that we might be
saved. We believe, too, that he went
further than that; that he extended salva
tion to the countless millions of souls that
had passed into the great beyond before
his coming. We believe that during the
three days that his body lay in the tomb
his spirit had gone to preach the Gospel to
the spirits and offer them salvation, tor
this we have the word of the Bible, We
believe in baptism, and there is only now
completed in Salt Lake City the temple,
which has cost millions of dollars and the
toil of many people forty years in build
ing, where nothing goes on but the cere
mony of baptism both for the living and
the dead."
The speaker referred to the report that
the area-murderer, Holmea, had been re
ceived into the Catholic church. Like
wise it was the belief of the Latter-day
Saints that no sinner need be lost except
those who committed the one unpardon
able sin referred to.
'â¢We believe," he said, "in the gift of
tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions,
healing, interpretation of tongues, etc., and
the laying on of hands for the gift ox the
Holy Ghost; the same organization that
existed in the primitive church, namely,
apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evan
gelists, etc.
"It is just a little strange," continued
the speaker, "that in view of these things
we have founded a church uoon the sim
ple doctrine of Jesus Christ â that ours was
the only one that was cast out at the
World's Congress of Religions at Chicago;
the only one of them all that was not con
sidered good enough to rnmgle and give
its testimanv there was the church of
Jesus Christ." The Hindoo, the Turk, the
Chinese, all were welcomed there, but the
Church of Latter-day Saints, founded on
American soil, the only one of them all
that was not an imported article, was cast
out, and this in a land of boasted religious
liberty. I say it was a little remarkable,
but it was also a coincidence that Jesus
Christ was scorned and cast out."
The speaker then went on to tell of Jo
seph Smith and his book. He was one of
the prophets of God. "I know this," said
the speaker, "as I know that when 1 ap
proach a warm fire I shall be relieved of
the distress of the cold. I know it because
I have seen his prophecies fulfilled. Jo
seph Smith, at a time when his following
was small, predicted that they would be
driven from place to place, from State to
State, and out of the United States, and
finally they would go to the Rocky moun
tains and there become a strong people;
that there would be a time when the whole
United States would turn against this peo
ple. And I have seen all that fulfilled.
Not only persecuted and driven from place
to place, but I have seen the United States
send an army against the community. Jo
seph Smith prophesied the rebellion, and
that it would start in South Carolina. I
might name many more as remarkable
evidences that this was a prophet of God.
Brigham Young was also a proph
et, and so is the present leader of the
church, more than 90 years of age. Three
years ago at the dedication of the temple
he stated that the great bitterness felt
against this church would gradually dis
appear, not in this country alone but in all
the world. And I accept your presence
here as an evidence of the fulfillment of
that prophecy. You might be surprised to
see how from the missionaries we have
sent out comes the word 'Send us more
missionaries; we find prejudice fast dis
appearing and the people more and more
willing to accept our teachings.'
Speaking of the Book of Mormon he
said it was the divine history of the In
dians in this country and the evidence
of its genuineness was of such strength
that were it introduced in the United
States courts against a man for murder it
would hang him.
Josiah Quincy, warrior and stateaman,
had said that if the question were asked
some years hence what native American
had had the most influence upon the des
tinies of the people he would not be greatly
surprised to have the question answered
with the name of Joseph Smith. The
speaker fully expected that answer some
day to be given.
The concerc in the evening was attended
by a large and appreciative audience. An
excellent programme was rendered. The
greater number of the selections were of
a sacred character. George D. Pyper,
who presides over a Justice's court when
at home in Salt Lake City, sang "The
Holy City" in a manner that provoked
generous applause. Charlie Pike, the boy
alto, was also well received. Lizzie Tbomas
Edward and Mabel Cooper, Maud May
Babcock, Joseph J. Daynes, W. E. Weihe
and Nellie Druce Pugsley contributed to
the programme.

A Large Attendance Expected To-Night
at Metropolitan Temple.
To-night, under the auspices of the
American Women's Liberal League, Key.
Father Yorke, chancellor of the archdio
cese, will lecture at Metropolitan Temple.
Considerable interest has been mani
fested in this appearance on a public ros
trum of Father Yorke, the first since his
return from Los Angeles, whither he ac
companied Archbishop Riordan on a visit.
This will also be the first of a series of
lectures to be delivered by him under the
same auspices.

$1 for the entire series of live. Tickets can
be secured in advance at the headquarters
of the league, Donohoe building, corner of
Taylor and Market streets, and at Sherman

make this series peculiarly notable at this
juncture, and a specially large attendance
is looked for at the opening lecture to
night.
Editor Barry of the Star will preside on
this occasion. The proceedings will open
promptly at 8 o'clock.
MASONIC ORPHANAGE.
Golden Gate Commander; to Hold a
Benefit at Mechanics' Pavilion.
The ground was broken Saturday last
for the Masonic Widows' and Orphans'
Home to be located at Decoto.
This undertaking concerns the Masons
of the State in general, but the Golden
Gate Commandery Drill Corps, Knights
Templar, has especially interested itself in
benaif of the good work and has arranged
to give a benefit next Saturday at the
Mechanics' Pavilion.
There will be a concert by Casassa's
Band of fifty pieces, and brief addresses
will be made by Rabbi Voorsanger, Charles
F. Crocker, W." F. K. Pierce and C. L. Pat
ton, who are among the trustees of the
home. There will also be a battalion
formation, a dress parade, review, guard
mount and exhibition drill by the drill
corps of the Golden Gate Commandery.
The tickets are 50 cents.
There is already $26,000 in the fund for
the erection of the home; the building is
to cost |40,000. Sixty acres of land have
already been purchased for $35,000.
NEW TEMPLE DECIDED ON
The Congregation Sherith Israel
Will Erect a New
Building.
A Site at the Corner of Van Ness
Avenue and O'Farrell Street
Will Be Purchassd.
The semi-annual meeting of the Congre
gation Sherith Israel was held in the syna
gogue, corner of Post and Taylor streets,
yesterday afternoon. Over eighty mem
bers were in attendance. President Brown
occupied tne chair.
The routine business was soon disposed
of. and the board considered the report of
the committee on a new building-site.
The committee, consisting of Phil N.
Aronson, Louis Brown, Charles Harris, A.
Kutner, Eitel Philips, E. Sheideman and
H. I. Kowalsky, was appointed last Octo
ber to find a suitable lot for a new syna
gogue. They looked at a number of lots,
and last Thursday held a meeting and de
cided to recommend the lot on the south
west corner of O'Farrell street and Van
Ness avenue as the best suited to the de
mands of the synagogue.
All the members of the congregation at
yesterday's meeting were unanimous in
the opinion of the committee and Presi
dent Brown was instructed to close nego
tiations for the lot. He will probably do
so to-day or to-morrow.
The lot decided upon is one of the finest
building sites in San Francisco. It has a
frontage of 120 feet on Van Ness avenue
and 137 feet on O'Farrell street. Very
little grading will be needed as the lot is
almost level. Just what kind of Â» builJ
ing the Congregation bherith Isreal will
erect has not yet been decided upon, but
it will cost not less than $150,000.
The old building on the corner of Post
and Taylor itreets has grown much too
small for the congregation and it will be
sold as soon as the new building is ready
for occupancy.
ARCHIEPISCOPAL SERMON
His Grace Addresses a Large
Congregation in St. Fran
cis Church.
SPOKE ON THE GOOD SHEPHErD
Many Boys and Girls Confirmed After
Mass and the Pledge Is Ad
ministered.
St. Francis Cburch, at Vallejo street
and Montgomery avenue, was the scene
of impressive ceremonies yesterday naorn
ing. The people of the parish crowded
into every available space and completely
tilled the church, as great interest was
taken in the services, which consisted of
high mass, followed by administration of
the sacrament of confirmation. There
was also a sermon by Archbishop Rior
dan, and at the close a large number of
children were given the pledge of the
League of the Cross to abstain from in
toxicating drinks and keep out of places
where liquors are sold until the boys reach
the age of 21 years.
Services began at 11 o'clock, when
Father Giles celebrated high mass. The
altar was one ereat cluster of calla liles
and evergreens, through which appeared
white marble and rows of flaming candles.
The choir, comprising Mrs. B. F. Sides,
Miss Henneberry, T. J. Walsh and A. P.
Woodbridge, supported by a large chorus
under the direction of Mrs. A. B. Collins,
rendered the "Kyiie" and "Gloria" from
Mozart's "Twelfth Mass," "Credo" from
Mine, "Sanctus" and "Uenedictus" from
Gounod, the "Agnus Dei" from Haydn's
"Second Mass," and offertory, "0 Jesu
Me" (Verdi), during the mass.
The sermon by Archbishop Riordan was
upon the Gospel of the day, in which
Christ says: "lam the Good Shepherd."
His Grace said in introduction he wished
to draw out in a few simple words the
beautiful lesson of the day's Gospel. The
day is known in the church as "Sunday of
the Good Shepherd," when the Redeemer
presents himself in the form of a shepherd
looking after his flock.
Christ did not appear in the garment of
kings nor surrounded by the pageantry of
military display; for though he was a
great king and a great ruler, yet he was
pleased to put himself in this day's Gos
pel as a simple shepherd in the field tend
ing his sheep. "We are the sheep of this
divine shepherd," said the Archbishop,
who drew a picture of the good life of the
simple shepherd caring for a flock on the
hills, day after day leading a pure and fru
gal life, surrounded by his sheep.
The Archbishop said that Christ is now
as when he said "I am the Good Shep
herd/' â the good shepherd. He provides
the word of divine truth, making his flock
understand what his commandments are,
putting into their minds these principles
of heavenly knowledge that the flock may
not be sheep that are going astray. This
is the way he provides nourishment for his
flock. Christ has fixed for all time heav
enly knowledge, brings his flock into the
light of leveaied truth, and put them in
the way of reaching eternal happiness.
This is the first nourishment which Christ
as the good shepherd provides for his flock.
He has placed his flocK here for a better
life which he has partly revealed, and yet
sufficiently that men may see him face to
face. But it is one thing to know the
truth, another thing to live according to
the obligations of divine truth. Christ
gives light for the way and strength
through his grace. He has a special in
dividual care for each member of his flock,
each one of whom stands revealed before
him.
The sermon was brought to a conclusion
with an appeal to pray to tne Good Shep
herd for his blessing and his guidance.
Confirmation was administered to some
Hundred boys and girls. The girls were
dressed in white ana wofe white lace veils,
and the boys were distinguished by white
bows on their arms. The "Veni Creator"
of La Hache was sung during the cere
mony, and Miss Clotilda Devlin played
Schumann's "Traumerei" on the violin, to
the accompaniment of the organ.
In the afternoon the Archbishop con
firmed several boys and girls at St. James
Church.

WITH A RIGHT
ROYAL GRIP
Christian Fellowship Ex
tended Its Hand to
Wm. Shaw.
HE LOVES CALIFORNIA.
Left Three Feet of Snow in His
Front Yard in Boston
Two Weeks Ago,
AND FOUND BLOOMING ROSES.
The National Convention of 1897 May
Be Held in San Fran
cisco.
With a right royal grip was the Chris
tian hand of fellowship extended yester
day to William Shaw, treasurer of the
United Society of Christian Endeavor,
who had come from Boston to visit the
branches of the order on this coast. When
he stood upon the stage of the auditorium
of the Young Men's Christian Association
he saw before him a sea of friendly faces of
Christian young men and women, with
here and there a wave of gray hairs dash
ing upon the rocks of honorable old age to
emphasize the fact that all the Christian
Endeavorers are not young.
There were no vacant chairs in the cozy
auditorium, either downstairs or in the
gallery, and all who were there were of
one family. This imparted a warmth to
the atmosphere that harmonized well with
the true California greeting extended to
the brother who had come all the way
from Boston to thaw out in the genial sun
shine of the Golden Gate.
The .Plymouth Congregational choir,
consisting of Mesdames Eva Tenny and
J. W. Madden and Messrs. Charles L. Par
ent and J. R. Ogilvie, led in the singing
and was one of the most attractive features
of the occasion.
The exercises were opened with the
hymns "Praise Him! Praise Him! Jesus,
Our .Blessed Redeemer!" "Joy to the
World, the Lord Is Come," "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," and others of the
familiar Endeavor selections, for a quar
ter of an hour's service of song which put
the society into the frame of mind appro
priate for the occasion. The service was
led by H. S. Stedman.
Dr. Williams of the Plymouth Congrega
tional Church offered prayer, after which
followed a recitation in concert of the
twelfth chapter of Romans led by Rev. Mr.
Ricker.
Miss Susie Hert MarK followed with a
song "Forever," and sang with exquisite
feeling.
Secretary McCoy announced that this
evening there would be v birthday social
and grand fellowship meeting in the Y. M.
C. A. edifice on which occasion the en
tire buildiug would be thrown open to the
members of the society. Every visitor was
requested to bring a cent for every year of
his age. He al^o requested that each
branch of the society send five del-
egates to the State Convention which will I
meet at Sr.n Jose on May 13. 14, 15 and 16. |
The announcement was alto made that
on Thursday evening, April 30, there would
be an open night meeting for young men
under the auspices of the Forward Move
ment Society.
Professor J. A. Wiles made a neat and
gracefully worded address of welcome to
the distinguished guest, William Shaw of
Boston, whom he designated as one of God's
noblest men standing in the front of the bat
tle. Mr, Shaw, he announced, was in favor
of the selection of San Francisco as the
place of meeting of the National Conven
tion of the V. P. S. C. E. in 1897. He
ciosed by introducine Mr. Shaw.
Mr. Shaw began by expressing his pleas
ure on beholding a welcome even in the
beautiful flowers which he found growing
here. He was a tenderfoot and was as
green as anything that grew in California.
He had this to say, however, and that was
that whether or not the society here
wanted the National convention to come
to San Francisco, the society in the East
wanted to come here and would come here.
The members were eager to come. Many
members had been saving money for
years to make the trip, and if the railroads
would not make reasonable terms they
would sail from Boston to the Sandwich
Islands and get to California by that way.
They were bound to come if they had to
go by way of the north pole.
He declared that if he told half the
truth about California he would be called
a romancer. He would have to tone it
down very much. When he left home
two weeks ago he left three feet of snow in
his front yard, and he did not know how
many feet in his back yard, and since he
went away from there three feet more had
fallen. He came here and was walking on
roses and breathing in a climate of floral
perfume and of sunshine.
The witty remarks of the speaker kept
the audience in continual good humor
and made a decided hit when he good-
naturedly spoke about the difficulty with
which the farmers of Maine planted bear.s
with a shotgun, and the discouraging
nature of the task of Eastern horticultur
ists in attempting to grow roses on
Plymouth Rock. They wanted soil in the
East and they ought to come to Califor
nia, where there is plenty of cood soil and
good climate.
It would do the Christian Endeavorers
of California good also to see the kind of
Endeavorers they raise in the East â young
men with the Bunker Hill monument up
their backs.
"We want young men/ he added, "with
the Bunker Hill monument in their back
bone who will stand against ali the as
saults of the devil and all the invitations
of the enemy, and who will stand for
Christ and for his church."
The speaker told of the 60,000 delegates
who were expected to attend the National
convention ia Washington next July.
They were a body of vigorous young men
and women with live ideas, and next year
they might be able to transplant some of
those ideas in California. He closed with
a graceful tribute to the Endeavorers of
California for the earnestness and enthu
siasm they had shown in the work and for
the remarkable progress they had made
during the last few years.
In the absence of Mrs. Eva Tenney, J.
R. Ogilvie sang "Come Unto Me," and dis
played a very sweet tenor voice.
Rev. WiJliam Rader made an address in
which be spoke of the manner in which
the Endeavorers of California had greeted
the "rural visitors from the Bast." He
hoped that the distinguished guest would
not believe all that he would hear in this
State, but to look around him. He called
attention to liberal-minded and progress
ive men from the East who had brought
those ideas with them and settled in
California. One of these was Horace
Bushnell, another was Mayor Sutro, who
will have left behind him the most mag
nificent baths in the world and other
monuments reared by his enterprise and
liberality. He mentioned also Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper, who had made a name for her
self of world-wide range in kindergarten
work.
When Mrs. Cooper's name was men
tioned it was received with a round of
hand-clapping.
Mention was made also of the beautiful
building of the Y. If. C. A. and the man
ner in which it came into being, and A. S.
Watt, who declared that San Francisco
should have the National convention in
1897, and if not then in 1898. "When the
City Fathers heard this they immediately
raised the angel on the City Hall dome.
"We hope," added Dr. Rader, "that after
the convention is held here the angel will
get inside the City Hall."
San Francisco to bis idea occupied the
center of things. Through its Golden Gate
came in representatives of the Orient and
through them went missionaries to all
parts of the world. Tho cosmopolitan
character of the City, with 20,000 Italians
and 40,000 Chinese, was next spoken of as
being one of the peculiarities of this City.
The speaker called upon his hearers to
advocate Christian citizenship, the old
Christian Sabbath of New England ; the
reading of the Bible in the school and to
denounce the saloon element.
"Nearer, My God, to Thee," by the
Plymouth Congregational Choir, and
"Sunshine," by the choir and audience,
concluded the meeting.
Immediately afterward Mr. Shaw gave a
reception in the parlor and was taken by
the hand and cordially welcomed by many
hundreds of Christians.
in conversation the visitor said that he
will visit Los Aueeles and San Diego this
week and will reach Sacramento next Sun
day. From that place he will leave for the
East. He said with reference to the con
vention of 1897 that many Endeavorers in
the East had formed clubs and were pay
ing in so much a week for the purpose of
providing themselves with funds to make
the trip to San Francisco. He estimated
that 25,000 Endeayorers would visit San
Francisco if the railroad companies would
make reasonable excursion rates.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1896.
RICHMOND'S NEW CHURCH
Congregationalists Preparing to
Erect a Spacious House of
Worship.
HOW THE WORK WAS STARTED
Rev. Phillip Coombe Organized the
Church Less Than Three
Years Ago.
Through the persistent efforts of one
manâ Rev. Phillip Coombeâ Richmond is
THE NEW RICHMOND CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.
to have a new church. It will be a hand
some, commodious edifice, and one that
the entire district will be proud of.
The new building will be erected on the
corner of Sevtnth avenue and Clement
streets, where the present humble house
of worship now stands. The lot, 75 by 100
feet, is sufficiently large to accommodate
both structures, so the old honse will be
moved back and used for a pastor's study
and lecture-room.
Rev. Phillip Coombe came to San Fran
cisJo in the early part of 1893, and in the
December following organized the Rich
mond Congregational Church. At first he
had to battle with great odds, but with
true Christian fortitude he struggled on,
his efforts finally culminating in a brilliant
success when only dismal failure had been
predicted.
The congregation naturally small at the
beginning, gradually increased with each

Richmond Congregational Church.
passing month until now it taxes the ca
pacity of the building every Sunday night,
there being only one service a day. The
membership has also grown until now
fifty-nine names ire enrolled on the
churchbook.
Some six months ago the pastor saw
that a new church was absolutely neces
sary, and with characteristic energy set to
work to secure it.
Subscriptions came in rapidly. Those
who found themselves unable to contribute
cash pledged an equivalent in lumber,
until now all but a few hundred dollars
has been subscribed.
There is enough guaranteed, however, to
authorize the trustees in commencing the
work at once, and all last week some half
a dozen contractors were busy making esti
mates. The contract has not been let yet,
bnt probably will be in a few days. The
building complete will cost $3500, and from
an architectural* point of view will be
ideally beautiful. The new edifice is
modeled after the Santa Rosa church, one
of the handsomest buildings of its kind in
the State.
The auditorium, or church proper, will
have a seating capacity of 700, with fold
ing doors so arranged as to reduce this to
300 should the conditions warrant a
smaller room. There will be Sunday
school and Bible classrooms and library.
With the sliding doors additional rooms
can be had if the occasion arisss. Work
will begin on the new edifice in a few days
and will be pushed rapidly to completion.
Rev. Phillip Coombe, in addition to his
pastorate of the Richmond Congregational
Church, is also in charge of the Pierce
street church.
JUMPED INTO THE BAY.
J. C. Wilber, an Old Man, Seek* a
Watery Grave.
J. C. Wilber, an old man without a
home, jumped into the bay at Beale and
Bryant streets yesterday afternoon, but
was quickly pulled out and sent to the
Receiving Hospital in the patrol wagon.
He was none the worse for his bath.
Wilber said he was tired of life and
thought the best way to end it was by
jumping into the bay. He was a box
maker by trade, but had not done any
work in his line for seventeen years.
Since then he has been living by doing
odd jobs along the water front.
"I was a member," said Wilber, "of the
old Tiger Fire Company for some years.
At that time the firemen were paid good
salaries and we had good times then. I
haven't had any luck since I left the fire
company, and now I am tired of it all.
I suppcse I will have to try drowning
again. Some people think I'm crazy and
I suppose I am. Say, have you got a
cigar about you?"

the throwing out of new shoots and ieaves,
the latter forming the tea of commerce.
The average "flushing" period is from
seven to nine months,^ and tfce intervals
vary trom seven to fourteen days. The
number of "flushes" range from eighteen,
where no manure is used, to twenty-five

THE SECOND BIG RIFLE
Mounting of Another 12-Inch
Gun on the Fort Point
Hill.
THE CRUISER CHARLESTON.
Oregon to Go on the Drydock During
High Water Next Saturday
Night
Under a decision of the Secretary of
War a soldier transferred at his own ie
quest is required to bear the cost thereof.
The major-general commanding tne army
has informed department commanders
that when transfers of this kind are ap
plied for the soldier must, In general, have
the money to pay his own expenses with
out calling upon the Government to ad
vance his transportation in kind, subject
to future charges on the muster roll.
'The practice of furnishing transportation
to be paid for by charges on the muster
roll, some times covering long periods of
time, is considered detrimental to the best
interests of the service."
Leave of abseDce for ten days has been
granted to Captain Francis E. Pierce
First Infantry.
Leave of absence for twenty days has
been granted to Lieutenant William G
Haan, Fifth Artillery.
The work of mounting another 12-inch
rifle on the bluffs above Fort Point is i n
progress. The gun is to be mounted in all
respects similar to the rifle already in posi
tion and will command a like range. These
two 12-inch rifles bear directly upon
the entrant to the Golden Gate and a fleet
approaching would be exposed to their
range for a distance of eight miles. Two
guns of equal caliber and of the same pat
tern are to be posted on the Lime Point
bluff, Marin County, almost directly oppo
site Fort Point. A 12-inch rifle throws a
solid projectile weighing 1000 pounds.
The instruction of the Fifth Artillery in
heavy gun practice is constant at the Pre
sidio. The batteries, from Fort Ma3on and
Alcatraz are brought there for the drills.
Proposals for rilling in the marsh lands
of the Presidio have been invited by pub
lic advertisement, and a contract for the
work will probably be awarded next
Wednesday. Colonel A. S. Kimball, chief
quartermaster of the department, is as
sured that many contractors will compete
for tbe work. The contract for building
the quartermaster's stables will also be let
this week.
Dr. White, post surgeon of the Presidio,
has arrived from St. Louis, and will enter
upon his duties this week.
Lieutenant McGrath, Fourth Cavalry,
and Lieutenant Brown, Fourth Infantry,
are in San Francisco to attend tue board
of examination for promotion.
Secretary Lamont has acted on the case
of Lieutenant Schofield of the Fourth Cav
alry and that officer will come up for re
examination next year. Lieutenant Scho
field is a son of Lieutenant-General
Schofield, U. S. A., retired. When he was
admitted to the army the medical board
found in him no defects, but on his exami
nation for promotion before the board at
the Presidio some three months ago it was
found that his hearing was defective and
so the case was referred to the Secretary
of War. Then the question arose whether
the deafness was contracted in the service
or before he entered the army, as they had
important bearing on retirement. Some
officers were so indiscreet as to hint that
the board of medical examiners which
passed Mr. Scholield did not want to re
ject the son of the General who was then
in command of the armies of the United
States and consequently did not make as
careful an examination as should have
been made.
General Forsythe, commanding the De
partment of California, went to San Diego
ten days sgo to inspect the troops of the
First Infantry, there siationed. After per
forming his duties at San Diego barracks
he visited Santa Barbara, arriving there in
time to view the floral display. He will
be in San Francisco again early this week.
Orders have been issued by the Navy
Department for tbe return of the cruiser
Charleston to San Francisco from the Ori
ent beiore July 1 next. The cruiser will
go to Mare Island and be placed out of
commission for repairs.
In the Yokohama United Club, where
Englisnmen predominate and Americans
are a good second, considerable money
was recently wagered on a run wherein
the British Edgar surpassed the time
made by the French cruiser. The Edgar
won and the French lost a lot of money.
As United States cruiser Olyrnpia was
about to make the same run the Ameri
cans put up money that their ship would
break the record, but the Olynipia en
countered tempestuous weather, hence the
Englishmen were again winners.
The cruiser Philadelphia. Admiral
Beardslee's flagship, goes from Santa Bar
bara to San Pedro.
The battle-ship Oregon has now all her
armament aboard excepting the six-pound
ers. Work has been going on vigorously
to pnt everything in readiness for the
trial inp, beginning May 10. The Oregon
will go on the drydock at Hunters Point
during high water next Saturday evening
at 10 o'clock. The Bhip will be taken from
the Union Iron Works to Hunter 3 Point
by two tugs.
The instructions given to the Board of
Inspectors for testing the Indiana and
Massachusetts are to govern the inspec
tors of the Oregon. The officers to whom
the duty of testing the Oregon will be as
signed have probably been selected at the
department in Washington and their
names may be given in the dispatches
very soon. __^________^__
SWAM FOR HIS LIFE.
John T. Sullivan's Remarkable Egcape
From Drowning in the Bay.
John T. Sullivan, the shoe-dealer, met
with a serious mishap while out rowing in
his wherry tbe other day, and if it were
not for his remarkable physical endurance
he would surely have gone to a watery
grave.
He was just returning from a spin up to
Hunters Point, and when half way be
tween the point and the California Sugar
Refinery, while taking a stroke, he missed
water with one oar, and losing his balance
was precipitated into the water.
The boat still maintained its upright
position, but being a very frail built craft
Mr. Sullivan could not re-enter it without
swamping it.
When the accident occurred he was a
mile out from land, and unfortunately no
one was near to render assistance. He was
incumberea with a heavy sweater and
shoes and before he struck out for shore
he undertook to remove them.
Being an expert swimmer it was an easy
matter to get his shoes off. but when it
came to the sweater the task almost fin
ished him. He was under water half the
time in getting the thin? off. only coming
to the surface when completely out of
breath. Once he had the sweater nearly
off when it became entangled in some
manner and almost smothered him, but
by a superhuman effort while under
water he managed to free himself of the
incumbrance, and coming to the surface
struck boldly out, towing his vaiueble boat
alongwith him.
He was just one hour and a half reaching
terra firma, during all of which time he
had been struggling in the water that
was both cold and very rough. He landed
at a point midway between the rope-walks
and Butchertown, and after starting circu
lation in bis benumbed anatomy, he got
into his wherry and rowed to the* Pioneer
boathouse, where his craft is kept.
Outside of a slight cold, which he con
tracted through the experience, he was
none the worse for his little mishap,
and was out rowing as usual yesterday.
Mr. Sullivan is well-known in sporting
circles, being a prominent member of the
Olympic Club and Pioneer Boat Club. He
is a remarkably fine oarsman, having held
the amateur championship of the coast in
the single-scull for a number of years.
CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY
The Junior Teams of the Ala
meda and Pacific Clubs at
Alameda.
The Alamedans Are Victoriousâ The
San Jose Eleven Fail to Come
to Time.
The first cricket game of the season seen
on the Alameda grounds took place yes
terday, the competing teams being the
junior divisions of the Alameda and Pacific
clubs. These combinations are not, as the
title implies, the second elevens of the
respective clubs, but are picked teams,
with six players of either club barred, and
the games are arranged by the association
with a view to fostering the interest in the
game of the younger members and inci
dentally giving them match practice.
J. H. Harbour, who captained the Paci
fies, having won the toss, sent his oppo
nents in. They came within two of a
century, H. Bird, Burr and Driffield doing
the chief scoring and taxing the efforts of
no less than seven bowlers.
The scarlet and blacks made on the
whole a poor showing, John Theobald,
with a carefully compiled 27, and Tiede
niann, who scored his dozen, alone reach
ing double figures. Their total of 58 left
their foes victorious by 40 runs.
Among the fielding features of the game
Young's catch of Burr off Hanson, and of
Bird off Hufferdine deserve mention, as do
Hufferdine's excellent bowling and Tiede
mann's catch of Driffield. The scores:

DIFFERED AS TO DAMAGES.
Juror Mocker Explains How a Com*
promise Sum Was Eventually
Agreed to in Martin's Case.
Twelve good men and true, after due de
liberation, awarded George W. Martin a
verdict against the Southern Pacific Rail
road Company for $25,000. It was a signal
victory and one on which twelve similar
suits are directly concerned. Though
those who have followed the progress of
the trial have felt that the rights of the
rippled, plaintiff had been grossly vio
lated, verdicts against the railroad com
pany for the arrogance and malefactions
of its servants are none too common to
cause wondering comment, and the vic
tory which Messrs. Delmas and Biiort
ridge achieved in defeating this pugna
cious corporation has won them unlimited
applause.
The most important requisite to the suc
cessful litigation oi a just cause next to
the evidence is the jury. The jury in the
Martin case was particularly good. Al
most without exception they were practi
cal business men, without class prejudice
or foolish sympathies.
"I can truly say that I have never sat
with a better jury," said William Mocker,
one of the jurymen, yesterday. ''Though
there were differences of opinion I believe
every man in the room was anxious to do
what was right. From the first we
listened closely to the evidence. "We noted
the points brought out by the lawyers and
we paid particular attention to the charges
of the Judge. I can truly say for myself
that I was there to see equal and exact
justice done to all. Ido not enter the jury
box for the $2 a day. I have my home and I
have property, so I do not need the money.
From a purely monetary standpoint jury
duty is a losing proposition, bnt some
one has to do it, and I hold it a test of
good citizenship not to shirk this duty.
"I have not a bit of prejudice against a
corporation, railroad or other kind, but if
I had 1 would not allow it to influence my
verdict. The opinion I came to was de
rived entirely from the evidence, and I be
lieve I can say the same for the other ju
rors.
"From the time we entered the jury
room there was not a minute lost. We
commenced at once a discussion of the
merits of the case, and there were some
hot speeches made. These, however, were
all concerning the amount of damages.
E. P. Rowe maintained warmly that
$75,000 was none too little for the rough
treatment, with its dire results, to which
Martin had been subjected.
"It took seven or eight ballots before we
could agree on the amount of damages.
The sum agreed on was not satisfactory
entirely, but a compromise seemed neces
sary. Mr. Rowe, however, woul 1 not
agree to less than $75,000."

Rev. Donald M. Ross Speaks of
the Duty of the Members
of the A. P. A.
SHOULD ATTEND TO POLITICS.
Common Cause Should Be Made
Against the Vicious Bosses
and Politicians.
There was a decided increase in the
attendaneejat the good citizenship meeting
yesterday afternoon at Metropolitan Tem
ple. The fact that there was no charge for
admission and that Key. Donald M. Ross
was the speaker of the day served, no
doubt, as factors in filline the house.
In opening the meeting Chairman Quit
zow said: "We have been at work during
the past week endeavoring to get men who
represent our principles sent to the Repub
lican State Convention to be held at Sacra
mento, and I am pleased to state that I
believe we have been successful."
"I am satisfied that we shall have a
strong representation in this convention,
which is to be held to name the delegates
to the National Convention at St. Louis,
and I am sure we shall have a great influ
ence in the nomination of the candidate
for'the next Presidential election.
â¢'I will say that the people on the other
side are not satisfied with our work. They
say that after we get through with the
Catholics we shall turn our attention to
the Jews. I want to cay that that is not
so. If there is any Jew that wants to join
our organization let him come forward and
he will see how heartily he will be received
as a member."
Rev. Donald M . Ross, in speaking on
"The Duty of an A. P. A.," said:
'A thermometer is not more than six
inches long, but it indicates the weather
for miles around. I am glad to see so
many here to-day, for they, acting like the
thermometer, represent not only their
own Eentiments, but the sentiment of
thousands ana thousands in San Fran
cisco and other parts of the State.
"We have great responsibilities on us.
I 1 hey say we are actuated by bigotry. But
do you think that millions of people in
the United States could be brought to
gether Tinder one constitution actuated
simply by bigotry? The men wno say
this are dignified and so is the owl, and
the one knows just as much of our move
ment as the other. Not a man in America
who is a true patriot would give a cent lor
persecution. The iaea that brings them
together is the same as that which inspired
men during the revolution. It is not a
cent for persecution, but millions for de
fense, and it is a case of defense now
with us.
"The three or four millions of men who
have banded themselves to keep the poli
ticians busy, do not care for the politi
cians â the bosses. We do not even know
who the bosses are, but we are against the
evil of bossifjm as a principle and method
of government.
"The first, chiefj and only duty of an
A. P. A. is his duty to his country. When
you shift this duty to the politician and to
a party you fair iu your duty. You have
no right to shift tne responsibility of gov
ernment in this way. The duty to gov
ernment cannot rightly ana justly be laid
aside by any man. Each vote is as strong
aa any that is cast. People blame bosses
for wrong government, but do nothing to
prevent the bosses from getting control.
When the political thieves rob your treas
ury you have only yourself to blame.
"This condition of political corruption
is easy to correct. It requires simply a
little activity on the part of the individual
citizen. Let the men who are corrupt un
derstand that when next they come before
the country for election they will be al
lowed to fall without any effort being
made to pick them up or relieve them,
and you will soon see a change in the ad
ministration of government.
"The business man refuses to go into
politics because it will take too much of
his valuable time, yet he will uncomplain
ingly pay excessive taxes while the poli
tical crooks pay not a cent. He may some
times protest and swear a little when he
goes to tne Tax Collector's office to pay his
taxes, but there it ends."
The speaker referred to the high rale of
taxes last year and the utter absence of
any permanent improvement in the City
to show for imposing this financial burden
on the citizen. He asserted that the cor
rupt political office-holders consumed the
taxes. Continuing he said :
â¢â¢We owe a duty to the City of San Fran
cisco that will properly protect this yearly
income of $7,000,000 from taxes. This sum
ought to make our City a very paradise,
but it don't. People are not attracted to
Jive in this City. They go to Los Angeles
or some other city where there is some
thing in the shape of public improve
ments to attract them. The people of San
Francisco should see that this large
amount is used for public improvementsâ
well-paved streets among other things.
There is no need for increased taxation if
the money is properly expended. As the
matter, however, stands to-day there are
many in the public service who fail to re
ceive their salaries from the City regularly.
This is because the politicians are allowed
to absorb the taxes by their peculiar and
corrupt methods of administration.
"The people out;ht to rise in indignation
over the way in which these frauds carry
on our city government. The men of the
A. P. A. and all good citizens should see
to it that these corruptionists are thrown
out. I think that the A. P. A. has a
duty to perform that no other organization
caa fulfill. We must see that these men
are turned out. Some people may accuse
us of prosecution in trying to turn them
out, but any persecution of a criminal
might just as fairly be termed persecution.
What we want to do is to make the men
who are public servants work as if they
were private servants. This the A. P. A.
can do by seeing that their votes go ouly
for good public servants.
"It may take us a little time to get things
straightened out, but if we show the proper
courage and persistence we shall eventu
ally and thoroughly accomplish this great
work of reforming our City government,
and the broader State and National gov
ernments. There are business men and
Protestant men who are not in the A. P.
A., because they have not seen that we
have accomplished anything. But let
them wait two or three years, and then
you will see them only too willing to stand
by and with us. If we are determined to
support only good and true men for every
office, we shall Boon force every one to ac
knowledge that we have done the country
great good. We are not working for-self,
but for tne good of the country, and this
we must make the people understand.
They will then rise up and call us blessed'
and they shall praise ua in the future as
they now praise the fathers of the revolu
tion.
"It is hard to fight entrenched corrup
tion. A good man will seldom fight as
hard for principle as a bad man will for
his corrupt perquisites. No good man
fights so bitterly as does the corrupt poli
tician in his effort to hold his point of
vantage. But we have a way of fighting
that can be made effective, and it will need
no great physical effort. All we need to
do is to stick together and all cast our lit
tle silent but powerful ballot in the one
cause of reform.
"Members of the American Protective
Association, let that unselfishness rest
upon you that is necessary to win a com
mon and glorious victory. Let every effort
be directed toward one common object. If
our leaders decide that we must come out
of that party or out of this party, it is our
duty to do as tbey suggest, and unless we
do as they instruct, we cannot hope to win
in our great struggle. Only by standing
together under all circumstances, shoulder
to shoulder, can we attain the object of
our organization â the salvation of the
United States. Then will the corruption
ist feel what he has never before felt, the
thrill of a kick from an honest man in
possession of his own house.
"Our work must be done by the 3d of
next November or our opportunity will be
lost for at least two years. Let us not rest
till then. Let us try to have every man
cast his vote in the interest o! good and
honest government on that day."
Chairman Quitzow in closing the meet
ing advised every man to take a close
interest in the primary elections and in
the district political clubs.

in distress, having exhausted her supply
of food and water. Light and barflin.'
winds had lengthened out the voyage.
Otherwise no accident had occurred. The
Tillaraook sent provisions and a barrel of
water aboard the schooner and the two
vessels parted company.
A dispatch from Point Arena last even
ing stated that the coast steamer Point
Arena, which left this port the 16th for
Mendocino and way ports, struck on the
rocks at Point Arena. She had discharged
the freight and passengers intended for
that port and was starting for Mendocino
City. As she backed out her propeller
fouled the lines of the steamer Whitesboro
and she immediately became unmanage
able.
The luckless vessel was washed on the
rocks at South Beach. The Whitesboro
rendered assistance and succeeded in pull
ing the Point Arena into deep water. The
freight was transferred to the Whitesboro
and the passengers on board at the time
were landed at Point Arena safely. The
steamer South Coast was signaled for and
she took the disabled vessel in tow for San
Francisco. The crew went on board the
South Coast, as the Point Arena soon filled
with water.
New Woman in Georgia.
She saw a streetcar about a block and a
half away aud made up her mind to catch
it. and she did, b'gosh! She made a
plunge for it, and whistled for the con
ductor to stop the concern. The conductor
didn't think she would ever reach the car,
and consequently did not stop. But that
woman was one of "the up-to-daters, and
she had different notions from those of the
conductor. She ran like a rabbit, and it
wasn't long before she had planted her
tiny foot upon the step of the retreating
car. I felt disposed to applaud her for
this feat, but about that time she reached
up and pulled the bellcord and stopped
tlie car herself. The conductor and motor
man looked up in astonishment. "I sim
ply want to wait lor my dog to catch up,"
replied to their inquisitive glances.
Now, all I have to say is this â that if that
woman is a new woman, we need more of
them to run this country. We need them
particularly in the corn fields.â Atlanta

NASH TO BE LIBRARIAN
Senator Stanford's Private Secre
tary Will Become a Pro
fessor.
Diplomatic Experience and Knowledge
of Books Made Him Woodruffs
Successor.
Herbert C. Nash, for several years tutor
to Leland Stanford Jr., for eleven years
secretary to Leland Stanford, and for the
last three years secretary and adviser to
Mrs. Stanford, is to be the librarian at
Stanford University.
About sixteen years ago, when Governor
Stanford, then California's chief executive,
and Mrs. Stanford were making a tour of
Europe with their son, a youth of 12, they
met in one of the cities of the ; south of
France an attache of a British diplomatic*
corps stationed there, and 1 the courteous
manner and attractive personality of the
young man made more than a passing im
pression upon the parents. And s6;it
happened that upon their return to Paris,
after visi ting the Mediterranean coast of
Africa, they had agreed that they had
seen the person whom they would wish to
be tutor to their only son. Correspond
ence followed, and Herbert Nash accepted
the offer made him by the multi-million
aire railroad magnate to accompany the
famiiv on . their return to distant Cali
lornlt/ .., *sw* :^.v â ";. : - â  ..Z,:-u
--â  As a little boy Iceland Stanford Jr. did
not like stuay. He had, however, ac
quired an eagerness for learning some
years before Mr. Nash became his in
structor, and until the time of his death
he was almost constantly with his tutor,
both while at Menlo Park and while trav
eling extensively abroad. His interest in
learning was first aroused one day after
hearing bis teacher read a little story of a
pebole â how it had been formed, what af
fected it, and its whole experience during
the long lapse of ages; and he went home
from the private school in this City and
told his mother all about it. After the
boy's death, and when a president had
been chosen for the new university at
Palo Alto, it became Known to the
Stanfords that by a notable coincidence
the simple little story that had been the
inspiration of their son's desire to learn
was written years before by David Starr
Jordan, the man who afterward became
the head of the great university named as
a lasting memorial to the ambition of a
studious youth.
Mr. Nash continued his residence in the
Stanford household. His early insight
into diplomatic affairs made it easy for
him to assume the new duties of private
secretary to the president of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, and subsequently to be
in close sympathy with Mr. Stanford dur
ing two successful Senatorial campaigns
and their â  resulting life in Washington.
The broad training that he received in
this way coupled with the reliance that
Senator Stanford was known to place in
his secretary's judgment in many matters
of great importance resulted in several
unavailing offers being made to Mr. Nash
to enter a diplomatic life at Washington.
It is said of him that during his later
extensive travels over . Europe with the
Stanfords he was able almost without ex
ception to converse in at least one of the
prevalent languages of the people of the
countries visited, for he has made himself
familiar with no less than six languages.
; Those who know him personally say
that he is an omnivorous reader j and is
thoroughly conversant with the contents
of the best new books, and is often able to
discuss them before most people know they
have been published. His familiarity
with books and ; his judgment of their
merit were important considerations in
his selection as librarian to . succeed Pro
fessor E. H. Woodruff, who has accepted a
professorship of law at Cornell, where pre
vious to his establishing his reputation as
a librarian he was an instructor in Eng
lish.
Mr. Nash was born of W>lsh parents in
Italy, where the old family home is still
maintained. He has a brother in London
who as an Episcopal minister is quite a
distinguished character. . ~~r. r 'â ",:
At present Mr. Nash is at the Santa Bar
bara Hot Springs, where :he has been for
several months regaining his health. It
will be remembered that when ; Senator
Stanford died he left his secretary a pres
ent of $15,000. -^^-^Ov^
The Reading Mania.
"They talk about the drink habit, the to
bacco habit and the morphine habit," said
Dr. E. C. Briggs of Pittsburg at Wiilard's,
"but the worst habit to wnich a man can

REALTY MARKET REVIEW
Opinions of Real Estate Men
About Street Improve
ments.
A BOND ISSUE THE THING.
Considerable Opposition to a Tax Levy
for Such Purposes at
Present.
There is to be a conference between the
Board of Supervisors and a committee of the
Merchants' Association on Thursday, the 23d
inst., to see if arrangements cannot be made
to provide in the next tax levy for a sufficieut
sum to replace the cobblestone pavements on
the downtown streets with bitumen or some
other modern pavement. It is also possible
that the question of repaying Market street
will also be discussed with a view to ascertain
ing whether it is best to include this thorough
fare in the list of principal streets to be re
paved.
The undertaking of improvements of this
character on any extended scale would of
course add to the tax â¢ rate. As real estate
brokers come more generally in contact with
property-owners than any other class they are
pernaps better qualified to judge whether such
action on the part of the Board of Supervisors
would meet with general approval at this par
ticular time or not.
A Call representative interviewed a num
ber of the leading brokers on the subject Sat
urday, and the majority seem to disapprove of
undertaking these street improvements at the
present time. Instead, a study of ways and
means to reduce the tax rate is recommended.
The question of bonding the City for paying
for these and other improvements seems to
meet with general favor, but in most instances
it was regarded as unwise to bond the City un
til a new charter can be adopted which will
permit the expenditure of money raised in
this manner in a different way than it is under
the present form of City government.
A. s. Baldwin of the firm of Baldwin & Ham
mond said :
I am a member of the Board of Directors of the
Merchants' Association, and approve of their
efforts to secure better pavements on the down
town streets. I do not know that they have in
view the repavlng of but about fifteen or twenty
blocks in the retail district. If so, the cost wou'd
not be over 950,000 or $60,000, and this would not
add very much to the tax rate. In regard to Mar
ket street I think that it ought to be repaved
either with bituminous rock or asphaltum. The
latter would be better than the former.
A very superior quality of asphaltum is obtained
In San Luis Oblspo County, this State, that is
being used extensively in Kastern cities, and is a
strong competitor of the Trinidad asphalt. I don't
know why it has never been used here, unless tne
owners of the deposit are satisfied with their East
ern market and don't care to make the effort that
would be necesgarv in order to secure the intro
duction of their product here. However, Ido not
think Market street should be repaved until a first
ola*s sewer and conduit Is put in. It is only a
question of tima when this work will have to be
done, and no pavement should be laid until it is
done.
Thomas Magee of Thomas Magee <fc Sons said :
I think it would be a!l riirht to levy an additional
tax of from f 50.000 to 875.000 per year for the
purpose of gradually repaying the streets that now
have cobble pavements. But to undertake to in
augurate improvements of this kind on an exten
sive scale and thereby increase taxes materially
would be ruinous to real estate. I think there is
no necessity for the repavement of Market street
at present, nis good enough, and in any case Ido
not favor laying a bituminous or asphalt pave
ment on that thoroughfare for it would be a menace
to draylng and heavy teaming which is a principal
part of the traffic there.
Wendell Easton of the firm of Easton, Eid
ridge& Co. said:
The downtown streets of the City are In many
places in miserable condition and should be re
paved. lam in favor of having it dove gradually,
but don't think any extended plan of street im
provements such as would cause a material In
crease in the tax rate should be undertaken at
this time. The trouble is that Han Francisco has
waited too lon* before commencing this much
needed work. If, however, it can be carried on
judiciously even under the present syttem I am in
favor of the work being commenced. Market
street needs repaying worse than any other street
in the City. It should be paved with bitumen or
asphalt.
There has Â«ot to be a preat deal of work done un
derground first, for the sewer system of the City is
a wretched one. and mnst be remedied before lone.
No extensive street Improvements should re made
till the sewers are first put into proper condition.
The ideal pian for accomplishing all these im
provements would be to bond the City, but to do
this the present form of jrorernment should be
changed, so that the money raised by bonding will
be properly expended and the best results attained.
George D. Toy of tne firm of Bovee, Toy &
Sonntagsaid: J
I cannot say that I approve of the proposition of
the Merchants' Association to endeavor to per
suade the Board of Supervisors to include in the
next tux levy a sufficient amount to replace the
cobble-stone pavements downtown with bitumen
or asphalt. Our taxes are already too high, and I
don t believe that the present Board of Supervisors
which is notoriously the most extravagant one the
City ever had, needs or should be given encourage
ment from any source to undertake improvements
that will increase tbetax-rate. If it is Intended that
the property-owners should pay one-half the ex
pense of laying new pavements on the streets in
question, it would not be so objectionable. But to
ask the property-owners generally to pay for the
paving of a few certain blocks is unjust.
Mr. Sountag of the same firm said he fully
concurred in what Mr. Toy said and added:
The only proper method of procedure to secure
well-paved streets in San Francisco is to vote to
bond the City for a sufficient snm to defray the
expense and to leave the expenditure of the
money to a board of public works to be appointed
by the Mayor and to have the paving conducted
under the supervision of competent and reliable
engineers. This Is ft plan I have advocated for
years, and lam confident that It will have to bo
adopted before San Francisco's streets will be
paved in the manner that they ought to. It is
only fair that the surctPdinfj generation should
pay for some of the Improvements of the City that
they will enjoy and be benefited by even more
than we who are here now will be.
Herman Shainwald of the firm of Shainwald
Buck bee & Co. said:
1 am heartily in favor of Btreet Improvements
and know that they are needed badly in many
localities. I am, however, decidedly opposed to
adflintr to the next tax levy to pay for such Im
provements. Ii would be wiser to try and devise
means to cut down the tax roll. There is but one
sensible plan for providing for iuch improvement*
and that Is to bond the city for an amount suf"
flclent to cover the cost of all improvements to
the accepted streets that may be deemed neces
sary. The Interest on such bonds would not
amount to as much ns is now charged from year
to year in the tax roll for making these street
improvements. It Is only just that the next gen
eration should pay for a portion or the improve
ments of the city.
G. H. Umbsen of the firm of G. H. Umbsen &
Co. said:
T am decidedly opposed to the proposition to pro
vide in the next tax levy for repaviDg the down
town streets or any others, for that matter. These
mprovements, I am willing to admit, should be
made, but not at this time. Taxes should be re
duced rather than raised, and the only way to
make street improvements necessary to be made
Is to bond the City to pay for them. It thus
spreads the payments over a period of time and is
more just and equitable all around.
3.'3. O'Farrell ot the firm of O'Farrell & Co.
said:
I am opposed to any proposition for street im
provements that will cause an increase in taxes.
Jn fact, I think that street Improvement should
be curtailed until the new charter can be adopted,
and under which street improvements will be con
ducted In a more satisfactory manner. Provision
may be made in the tax levy for certain street Im
provements, but the money is often diverted in
other channels. An Instance Is the case of the
levy of $80,000 for improving Folsom street. The
money was collected, but Is said to not, be avail
able, having been used for other purposes. No; I
think It unwise to encourage the levy of taxes for
street improvements under the present condition
or affairs.
Will E. Fisher of the firm of Will jc. Fisher &
Co. said:
I am decidedly opposed to the increase of taxes
for any purpose. Our taxes are already too high.
so high, in fact, that it discourages investments
here of outside capital. I favor the contemplated
street improvements and would like to see them
made, but it is an injustice toward property-holders
to tax them for that purpose. There is only one
way that It can be accomplished properly and that
is by bonding the City. Our tax rate is, I believe,
higher or as high as any city in the Union, while
our indeiftedness is nothing. It is not right to ex
pect us to build up the City and pay for it merely
for our posterity.
A. H. Lissak of the firm of O. F. Yon Rhein &
Co. said:
Efforts should be made to decrease taxes and not
increase them or maintain anything like the pres
ent high rate. It is killing real-estate values, the
present high taxes, and property will not earn the
expense it incurs to keep It up. The streets that
It is proposed to improve have done duty for many
years and there has not been mucn complaint
about them, and I think it foolish in a period of
depression like this to agitate for their improve
ment and the Increase in taxation that it will en
tall. If property-owners want thecobbles removed
let them pay for It individually.
C. H.Reynolds of C. H. Reynolds <fc Co. said:
We have beeu going through one of the worst or
deals ever experienced in the history of the coun
try and It is a very poor time to talk of raising
money for repaying streets. Taxes should be re
duced rather than increased and I am opposed to
making street improvements at this time at the
expense ol the property-owners. I would like to
see them made but we can't afford it now.
A. M. Speck of thefirm of A. 31. Speck Â«fc Co.
said: *^
Our downtown streets are generally in bad con
dition and should berepaved, and I think it would
be quite right to commence work on them as early
bs possible. The work should be done gradually,
however, so that it will not work too great a hard
ship on taxpayers. My idea is that work should
be first commenced on Market street raher than
the side business streets. Market street is the
main thoroughfare of the City. It Is a street that
everyone uses and the street that strangers first
see when coming to the City.
If any work is to be done on the downtown
streets Market street shonld by all means have the
preference. It should be paved out as far at least
as Van Ness avenue. To bond the City for street
improvements would be the best plan, but It
would be some time before such a proposition
could be acted upon. Meanwhile the streets are
getting worse, and they are bad enough now.
Samuel Center of the firm of Center <fc
Spader said:
Of two evils It is always best to choose the lesser
and as between raising the money on the next tax
levy for repaying the downtown streets or allow
ing them to remain as they are I am in favor of
the former. I know taxeÂ« are too high, hut on the
other hand the streets downtown, especially Mar
ket street, will have to bo improved very soon or
they will be unfit for traffic. Either asphalt or
that new block pavement of the kind just laid at
the foot of Market street would be best to pave
Market street with.
Jacob Heyman said:
I am in favor of street improvements being made
only by bonding the city. It is unjust and unwisp
at this time to levy taxes however small for the
purpose of repaying the downtown streets. I know
such improvements are badly needed, but am
ODposed to them being made by a tax levy made at
this time for the purpose.

l.Rst Friday a new chapter was instituted at
Wadsworth.
Golden Gate Hall was crowded to its utmost
lust Thursday night by the friends of Golden Gate
Chapter, on the occasion of the entertainment and
reception by the members of the chanter. . The en
tertainment was a most pleasing one and of a
character that is seldom presented by any fra
ternal organization. The ladies who composed
the committee of arrangements and prepared the
programme are entitled to a great deal of praise
for their work, and they have reason to feel proud
of the' result. An overture, â¢â¢Zampa," was given
by Professor Yanke, which was followed by, "The
Legend of the Organ-Builder," recited with a great
deal of effect by T. L. -Hill; the Wednesday Morn
ing String Quintet rendered some delicious music
on mandolins, mandola and lute; Arthur Davis
pave an acceptable tenor solo, and Professor Aael
stein charmed the audience with the lute, after
which Miss Helen Sway soprano, sang a song
that was loudly applauded.
This was followed by the living pictorial repre
sentation of Tennyson's "A Dream of Fair
Women," a very interesting production, In which
Helen of Troy, Iphigenla, Oleopatria, Jephat's
Daughter, Rosamond, Eleanor and Joan of Arc
were represented by the .Misses Johnson, Stephen
son, Hobe, Willais. Murphy, Huer and Bradley.
-Ml the young ladies impersonated the characters
assumed In a manner showing they had given
close attention to dress and paw in order to bring !
out the ideas of the poet, but one was particularly
meritorious, and thai was Joan of Arc. who was
represented by Miss Susan Mill Willals. She gave
a picture that was spoken of in terms of highest
praise by all. the comnic: datiou being deserved,
for the young lady presented an ideal picture of
the Maid of Orleans. The entertainment closed
with a number of living pictures, the first of which
was a presentation of the well-known one, "What
Are the Wild Waves Saying?" by a minor and an
adnlt. It was supposed that the adult was one of
the young ladies, but a laugh was raised when that
individual turned and exposed the bearded feat
ures of V. B. Hill. Mrs. George L. Darling was
very acceptable as "Trilby." Miss Ethel Murphy
posed as "Sally In our Alley," and was a very char
acteristic picture. The puzzle of the evening was
to know who it was that posed as Minerva in char
acteristic flowing <-own and all the effects that served
to make up the goddess. The wearer of the cos
t -me made up exceedingly well, andafter the show
Â«as over It was ascertained that the character had
been assumed by Walter Neat Brunt; a member of
the chapter. Dancing and refreshments brought
the delightful evening reception to a close. George
L. Darling was master of ceremonies.

Grand Army of the Republic.
A new order In connection with the Grand Army
has been organized at Wetherfiell, Conn. 7. The
Fraternal News of Hartford says: .This new order
is known as "The John \ M. : Morris Post Associa
tion." : Its object is to interest all patriotic citizens
in the Grand ;Army of the i Republic. It Is well
known that the comrades of . the Grand Army are
rapid declining in numbers, aad, uno oat wit a
out an honorable discharge from the army or navy
and who fought in the War of the Rebellion can
become a member, it is reasonable to suppose the
time will soon come when the Grand Army of the
ReDubllc will be an order of the past. This new
order Is designed to perpetuate Ihe memory of the
Grand Army boys and their deeds, also the prin
ciples for which they fought, and to stimulate that
true principle of patriotism In the present and
coming generation. It is designed to aid the needy
comrade, his widow and orphans, and to keep
green and fresh in the minds of the people the
deeds of the veterans of the war.
Last Wednesday James A. Garfield Post held
memorial service, it being the anniversary of the
death of Abraham Lincoln. At the close of the
very impressive service the veterans and their
guests were invited into the hall of the ladies of
James A. Garfleld Corps, and were entertained for
a time, then treated to light refreshments. The
ladies of this corps have appointed a committee to
arrange for a novel entertainment to be given
shortly.
Modesty of the New Woman.
The new woman tells us that the pres
ent century is her own; and, indeed, she
approaches the truth in this instance. She
has promised us a "Woman's Bible," and
she nas shown that even the Infinite
Father does not escape her jealousy, for
she has discovered that we should pray to
a "Heavenly Mother" as well as a
Heavenly Father. She informs us that
the Pilgrim Fathers are no more, and adds,
"There stepped on Plymouth Rock, on the
bleak shores of New ' England, thirty-two
women accompanied by sixty-nine" men
and children.' 1 At expositions she must
have a "woman's building," wherein she
may glorify the work ot her brain and
hund. No work done by man can be
placed beside hers for examination or
competition. Surely she furnishes a note
worthy example of modesty and self
abnegation for the benefit of the tyrant
man!â Mrs. Frank H. Winston in the
April Forum.

Officials.
SOME FLORAL JUGGERNAUTS.
E!cc f ric-Car C mranies Are Still Dcm
onstrat.ng li-e.r Superiority

Oakland Office San Francisco Cali.,)
908 Broadway, April 19. j
There has been a sufficiency of political
sensations and scandals in this city to
cause any one to think that anything ap
parently new must of necessity be a repe
tition of some old scheme. This is not the
case, nowever, and the latest out in the
City Hall farce is the most amusing of all.
As usual it is Mayor Davie against the
field, and as the Mayor and Council only
just completed one year of office there can
be no hope of result from the present ri
dicuious campaign till next March. This
being so tne ordinary voters are taking it
in and the professional politicians are
looting on with mild indifference and
making preparations to choose the next
Legislature.
It almost seems to have reached the
point where the Council and Board of
Works persistently oppose anything advo
cated by the Mayor merely because it is
the plan of John L. Davie. The same
would appear to be partly true of the
other side. Oakland has never had a
Mayor wiio made ie his sole business to
give the municipality the services it pays
for till it elected John L. Davie. Conse
quently the officials have long been in the
habit of doing us they pleased and of re
senting any curbing of their arrogance as
a display of impudence.
Mr. Davie does not make a comfortable
seat when sat upon, and, in consequence,
tne municipal reports and reports of spe
cial comnmteeo and the reports of Coun
cil and Board of Worns meetings during
the past year are the most puerile, undig
nified, useless and generally stupid con
tributions to official archives thai, can pos
sibly be found.
Tne latest phase of this petty political
Warfare is the attempt to prove that the
dollar tax limit is not sufficient to run
the city and not ipave a deficit. At the
present time but ten weeks of the fiscal
year remaiu, and Superintendent McCly
moudd is already prophesying a deficit in
the High School funds. If there be a
deficit the Mayor has proved that it is of
McCiymonds' making, for he has dictated
the policy of the Board of Education for
rive years, until at the present time the
salaries of teachers are 50 per ct'pt higher
than those of ether representative cities.
The Mayor has compiled the following
table, which he declares is absolutely
correct.

The Mayor openly declares that his
colleagues are conspiring how to spend
every available and unavailable cent so
that they can prove the fallacy o! his $1
tax limit. Mr. Davie, of course, opposes
ail expenditures that were not in the
estimate;, aim sends his communications
anent them to the Council. That body
rid.cules them and passes them by witn a
sneer. A few days ago Councilman
Manuel, who had been delegated to inquire
into some charges brought by the Mayor
against the Street Superintendent, pre
sented a report which was intended as an
affront to the Mayor, and which reflected
quite as ruuen on the writer as on the ob
ject of his wrath. Such work has now be
come so common that the saixfe crowd that
patronizes the police court now. troops
into the Council chamber in the same
spirii as they would feel toward a circus.
The killing of two bright little girls a
few weeks aÂ»o is being forgotten, and the
electric-cars are still rushing through the
streets without guards and just as they
please. The ordinance requiring guards
is said to be inoperative and tne police and
the council throw the ball of responsibility
from one to the other with careless indif
ference. Last week an ordinance was
passed, however, which is operative if en
forced. It regulates the passing of cars
and their passing of street crossings. It
reads "to take effect immediately after its
passage." It was passed a week ago and
the cars, if possible, are dashing across
streets more carelessly than ever. The
streetcar companies have notified the fete
committee that they will get out and dec
orate expensive cars to advertise the floral
fiesta.
The motive is a worthy one, but so long
as the shadows of frequent fatalities is
3een amonj; the display of gayety sensible
people will consider that obedience to the
iaws is more commendable than a tawdry
display of finely. The floral cars will still
be juggernauts when they pass the homes
where they have caused eternal sorrow.
The events of the past week have proved
without a doubt that the Republican
party of Alameda County is in dire straits
for want of a political Moses. The ma
terial to forru a party is here and the
major portion of it is willing to pledge
fealty to any able commander, but so far
he is not in sight. The reorganizes have
succeeded in disrupting the party and
claim to nave taken with them a majority
of the party, but this is not borne out by
yesterday's primaries when only about 900
voted in the city of Oakland out of an aver
age Republican vote of about 8000.
This is not altogether a safeguard, as
Oaklanders never figure at primaries, but
yesterday it was expected that at least a
majority of Republicans would be on hand.
As a matter of fact the new movement is
composed of seven different factions in the
seven wards of the cty, and each has its
own special leader. Dr. Rabe leads the
First, John A. Sands the Second, Fred E.
"Whitney the Third. \v. R. Thomas th-
Fourth. W. H. Friend Die Fifth. A. L.
Davis t be Sixth and George C. Pardee the
Seventh. Now a head is required to unite
these elements into a solid iront, but it is
not ensy to say who will completely fill
the bill.
There are many things to be taken into
consideration. The natural man for the
ta?k is ex-Mayor J'ardee, but he seems far
more inclined to be the power behind the
throne than the figure-head. As a non
i artisan Mayor Par'dee was a success, but
as a Republican leader he would fign.-fl in
an entirely different role. To make a suc
cess of the reform branch requires a man
of marvelous courage and executive abil
ity. He must be a political Reynard if be
is to lead the party out of the morass into
whicli they say it has descended. The old
line have everything to command. They
have experienced politicians, men of nerve
and force and strategists, and in addition
they have control of the party machinery,
and evince a desire to retain it.
The problem will be partly solved at to
morrow's convention. It'ia not known
yet who will preside, but as G. C. Pardee
Is a delegate ne cannot serve, and it is not
unlikely that County Clerk Jordan may be
called upon. If Jordan be wise, he will
not take such a prominent part.
It cannot be denied, however, thatthe
bolters are not so powerful as they believe
they are, and should the right man be
found the Republican party of this county
will yet be harmonized, but each day the
chances for such a reconciliation are grow
ing smaller.

DEAD IN HIS CELL.
Jailer White* Grewaome Discovery In
the Padded CÂ«-U Yesterday
OAKLAND, April 20.â Frank 8. Koeble
was found dead in the padded cell at the
County Jail this morning.
Koeble was arrested yesterday in Ala
meda and was booked for insanity. The
jailer thought that it was a case of de
lirium tremens and placed him in a cell,
but as he was rather violent he was re
moved to the padded cell last night.
Wnen Jailer White visited him this morn
ing he was dead and had expired several
hours previously. The body was taken to
the Morgue and" an inquest will be held.
Koeble was arrested yesterday on com
plaint of his wife, who said he had been
drinking heavily. He lived on a little
ranch on Central avenue off the San Le
andro road and leaves one child. It is
supposed that death was caused by alco
holism. __
THERE WAS NO RIVAL BAND.
Jonquln Miller* Nearest Saloon Visited
by Salvationists.
OAKLAND, Cal., April 19.â The Her
mitage, a well-known resort in Upper
Fruitvale, was visited to-day by a detach
ment of Salvationists and a quiet meeting
was held. The proprietor of the place,
knowing that they were coming, caused it
to be widely circulated and announced the
fact tnat he had engaged a brass band
from San Francisco to offset the army
band. A sensational story to this effect
was pubiisiied this morning and a tremen
dous crowd was drawn to the resort, out
the proprietor had not a vestige of a band,
and tne ingenuity of tne host was well re
paid. The Salvationists neld a quiet little
meeting about half a mile away an>l the
great battle of bands was proved to have
existed only in lhe mind of Boniface.

WOEKING ON THE COMET.
State I7nivergity Astronomers Coinnu
iug Its Orbit.
BERKELEY, Cal., April 19.â The as
| tronomers at the State University are
j busily engaged in computing the orbit of
: the new comet in the northern skies,
! which was observed or rathsr discovered
at the Mt. Lowe observatory a few nights
ago. It is believed that the comet is ap
proaching the earth and that it will be
| visible in a short time. It is impossible to
| determine as yet whether or not it is a
j large one from the fact that all the data
have not been furnished the coniputors.
! It will be a question of only two or three
days after all the data regarding the comet
have arrived from Mt. Hamilton that Pro
fessor Leu&cbner and his assistants will be
able to determine its exact location with
! respect to the earth and its detailed
I characteristics.
Greatent General of the War.
| . I do not risk anything in saying that the
: greatest general we had. greater than Grant
jor Ihomas. was Abraham Lincoln. This
I was not so at the beginning, but after three
or four years of this constant practice of
the art of war he arrived at this supreme
: knowledge of it, so that Molke was not re
| ally a better general or an abler planner
| of a campaign than President Lincoln was.
To gum it up, he was a born leader of men.
He knew numan nature. He knew what
chord to strike and he was never afraid to
strike it when he believed the time to do
so had arrived.â From a lecture by Charles
A. Dana.
Napoleon* Lack of Delicacy.
Apropos O' Napoleon's lack of delicacy
it is said tnai once in the Tuileries the Em
peror addressed one of his court ladies, not
renowned for purity, with the words, "You
are fond of men, I understand?" "Yes;
when they are polite," was the rejoinder.'
At Erfurt Talleyrand gave the same ex
planation of his master's vagaries. "We
French are more civilized than our mon
arch," he said to Montgeles, tLe Bavarian
Minister of State; "his is only the civiliz
ation of Roman history." â "Life of Napo

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1896.
DEDICATED BY LUTHERANS
The New First Church Formally
Accepted by the Synodic
Officials.
MANY ADDRESSES OF WELCOME
The Key of the Pretty Edifice Is
Handed Over to the Building
Committee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, April 19. ]
The First English Lutheran Church was
dedicated this afternoon by the members
of the synod, which had just adjourned
San Jose.
The pretty building, which is the first
one built by the Lntherans in this city,
has been in use for several months, but
the formal dedication was reserved till to
day, bo that several officers high in the
councils of the church might be present.
After the hymn following the opening
services several local pastors made speeches
of greeting and congratulation. Among
those who did so were Dr. McLean, Dr. R.
If. Coyle, Dr. Kummer, Revs. J. C. Hobart,
J. M. French, A. Gatlio, A. M. Le Veau.
When the gifts and subscriptions were
taken up a substantial part of the debt
necessary to equip the church was real
ized.
Christian Schreiber, one of the trustees
of the church, presented the keys to the
building committee and the formal dedica
tory prayers completed the ceremony. The
ladies had decorated the church with neat
taste, and the unpleasant weather of the
past week certainly had no effect so far as
the profusion of flowers was concerned.
This evening special services were held.
Rev. H. L. Yarger, western secretary of the
board of church extension, preached tne
dedicatory sermon. Rev. W. S. Hoskins
of Sacramento delivered the charge to the
pastor, Rev. J. E. Bushnell, and G. G.
Burnett of the First English Lutheran
Church of San Francisco delivered the
charge to the congregation. If the advice
of these two speakers be followed there
will never be any dissension among the
worshipers at the new church.
GEANT, THE MAN.
Hig Style of Living and Dressing, as
Told by a Veterau.
Here is a story of U. S. Grant, told by
George B. Merriok of Chicago, a veteran
and an editor:
"Before the war I 'ran the river,' as
steamboating was known in the early
days. My first acquaintance with the
greatest military genius of modern times
began while engaged in that business, be
tween 1857 and 1861. During one season I
was running as second clerk on the steamer
Fanny Harris. We ran into Galena, seven
miles up Fever River, then a navigable
stream. Galena was at that time a dis
tributing point, as well as a center of the
lead industry. Among its wholesale firms
was that of Grant & Son, leather, saddlery
and harness dealers, and among their em
ployes was the future general of our
armies. He was then shipping clerk. As
'mud clerk' it was my duty to check up all
shipments as the goods were hauled to the
levees on drays, and receipt for the same
to the shipper. U. S. Grant was the clerk
to whom the boy receipted for Grant &
Son's shipments. Remembering him, as
I do now/as only one of many business
men with whom I came in contact, my
j impression is not as distinct as it is of tue
general whom I last met at Washington in
1866. My impression is that the last time
I saw him in Galena he had a mustache,
not the full beard familiar to the men of
Vicksburg, Chattanooga and Petersburg.
"When the war opened we all went our
wa3 r s, and the name of Grant at Belmont
awakened no response in the mind of the
cub pilot on the Mississippi, conn cting
the fighting colonel with the saddlery
business at Galena. Our cnief pilot, Toni
Burns, had raised a company at Galena,
composed principally of river men, pilots,
engineers, mates and roustabouts, and his
name was greater than Grant's among the
river men who had not yet caught the war
fever.
"In February, 1864, I was detailed from
the West to the War Department for spe
cial service. Grant had made a great name
aB a fighter and a winner of Dattles. There
was much discussion among the detailed
men as to his probable success in handling
the Army of the Potomac. It was claimed
by the Eastern men that he had fought
only the second-rate military men in the
West. When he met Lee he would fail, as
other promising generals haa failed. We
Western men in the War Department main
tained that he would whip Lee, as lie had
Johnson, Beauregard, Braj.'Â« and Pember
ton ; or, failing, it would be because lie did
not have his Western troops to back him.
"I saw Grant at City Point in 1864 after
the repulse at Petersburg and once or
twice at Washington during the months
following. It was not until after the fall
of Richmond and the surrender of John
ston that I met the Galena man to speak
with him.
"It will be remembered that after the
assassination of President Lincoln men
held their breath, wondering what would
be the outcome. All eyes were turned
upon Grant. The volunteers' estimate of
the loyalty and patriotism of Andy John
son in that crisis was not high. Had the
threatened differences come to a choice
between Johnson and Grant the army
would assuredly have followed Grant, and
no one will question that Grant would
have done what he deemed best for the
Union. It was at this time that I resumed
my acquaintanca with Grant.
"Many War Department employes
lunched at a little oyster-house on G street,
just off Seventeenth. We dined in a very
democratic manner, standing at a tafl '
counter and eating half a dozen raw and j
drinking a cup of coffee. Ignoring t.e j
high-priced and high-toned restaurants, i
General Grant sauntered over from his
headquarters in the Windsor building,
and, standing at the counter, finished his
half-dozen like the rest of us, took a cigar
and walked around the biock for exercise.
I was dressed in a private's uniform, and
knew the far-apartness of a boy in the
ranss and a lieutenant-general, but, pre
suming on the fact that the war was over
and upon the common interest we had in
old times in Galena, I one day took my
stand alongside the general, and dur- j
ing a pause in the lunch I intro
duced myself. At once General Grant was
a shipping clerk in Galena, and as eager to
know the fate of the river captains, clerks
ane pilots, mutual acquaintances, as I was
willing to communicate what I knew of
them. We c atted for fully half an hour,
discussing the changes that the war had
made in the circle of our acquaintances
and the changes that had already come, or
would come, to the West and to the com
merce of the Mississippi.
"I saw the general often after that dur
ing the two years of my stay in Washing
ton, but never again spoke with him. The
fact of his democratic style of living and
dressing, for he never wore his uniform
buttoned and laced as the regulations re
quired, and his condescension, as it might
be deemed, in conversing with a private in
a public place, all indicated a character
uninfluenced by changed conditions and
untainted by success. The political and
scholastic biography of Grant will deline
ate him as a grea t general planning cam
paigns and winning battles; the popular
history which will take hold on the lives
as well as the imaginations of the young
men of tne Nation, as well as upon the in
terest of the old men who followed him,
will show him to have been a plain man,
hard-working, sometimes unfortunate in
business, determined, persistent, courte
ous, interested in common affairs as well
as in great, doing his whole duty in many
and varied conditions of life, and, dying,
worthy to rank with other our great men,
Washington and Lincoln."
BALLAST TOR DUOKS.
A Scientific Discovery That Elucidated
a Puzzling Mystery.
"Few people credit a duck with the
sense he really possesses," said Frank
Ozenne, a disciple of Nimrod. "For years
I had been wondering what had caused
the presence of a good-sized pebble-bank
on the shore of the lake in the Grandivola
section of the Louisiana marsh. Had it
been a sandbank I could have understood
it, but it was composed of pebbles, all
over, very much alike, rounded and
smooth almost to a size, and appar
ently differing from the small stones
found in the gravel-beds of the South.
Several of the hunters in that section had
seen the pebble beach and, like myself,
they could not understand it. All winter
long it seemed fresher than at other times,
and during the summer the grass would
kinder cover its upper portion and the
mud from the fresh water dim the luster
of the stones near the edge. There was
not another beach like it in the marsh.
'One winter, in fact it was just when the
first cold spell had struck us, I was hunt
ing with a friend in the lake I spoke of. It
was one of the finest ducting spots in the
State. This was before they had begun to
make glue from the eggs in Canada. When
we reached the lake there was not a duck
to be seen.
"The next morning I was hiding in the
grass near the pebble beach when i heard
a sound of wings and a large flock of mal
lard settled mar me. Before I could raise
my gun the en lira lot walked out on the
pebble beach and, to my astonishment,
began to disgorge a lot of small stones like
the ones already there. This occupied but
a short time and ttie flock began quacking
and sailed into the lake and I shot several.
This settled the mystery of the pebble
beach.
"In the spring I was again hunting in the
lake, and when the first warm weather
came the ducks began to go home. They
would come to the beach, and after a few
preliminaries swallow a lot of pebbles,
then fly around fjr a few minutes in order
to see if their balance was ali right. If
they were too heavy they would disgorge
a few stones, or if too light swallow a half
dozen more.
"I found by observation that in order
for the ducks to make long nights it was
necessary for them to fill up with a cer
tain number of stones to secure a proper
equilibrium for the return trip. Alter I
found tnis out I always had plenty of
game to show my friends." â New Orleans
Times-Democrat.
FATHER YORKE TO SPEAK
He Has Been Asked to Address
the Grand Council Y. M. I.
at Haywards.
Ladies Promise That the Decoration of
the Church Will Surpass Any
thing Yet Seen.
HAY WARDS, Cal., April 19.â .The com
mittee having the matter in charge has
requested Rev. Peter U. Yorke to deliver
the address to the delegates of the State
Council of the Y. M. I. that meets here
on May 19, and it is regarded as certain
that he will accept. The controversy in
which Father Yorfce recently engaged in
The Call has made his writings familiar
to Catholics all over the State, and there
is a general desire among the delegates to
hear him speak.
The finance committee that started out a
few days ago to collect the promised sub
scriptions met with extraordinary success,
and all doubt regarding adequate enter
tainment for the delegates is at an end.
In a few days the erection of tne arch of
welcome will be commenced and prepara
tions will be made for decorating the town.
The ladles have promised that the
churcn shall be decorated as never church
was decorated before. They are preparing
some floral designs that are said to be
unique and which will not b<3 seen till the
church opens for hi^h mass on the day
the Grand Institute opens.
The preparations for the event are not
confined to any creed, but everybody irre
spective of belief, has entered into the af
fair and is working for the success of the
gathering, all realizing that they are
equally interested in having a good report
of the town carried away by the returning
delegates.
Arrangements have been made so that
all who attend can be accommodated end
there will be neither crowding nor over
charging.
SUIT FOE A PEJTOY.
The Coin Wai Over Nine Hundred Tears
Old.
In the Westminster County Court yes- \
terday his Honor, Judge Lumley Smith,
Q. C, tried the case of "Spink vs. Cress
well, â¢' which was an action brought by
Messrs. Spink & Son, numismatists of
Piccadillj, W., to recover three guineas,
the value of an Athelstan penny, from the
Rev. Dr. CresswelJ, who resides at (Jrorner.
Mr. Jones, solicitor to the plaintiff firm,
said they published what was known as
Spink's Numismatic Circular. A "Not
tingham" was described there, and on
January 2 tne defendant wrote to the
plaintiffs asking that the coin might be
sent on approval. fhe coin, a King
Athelstan penny, was sent. On January
6 the defendant wrote, saying: "The coin
you pent me gave way in the wadding."
The plaintiffs received it by post and
found that it had been broken, and they
now sought to recover its value from the
defendant.
Charles Frederick Spink, a member of
the plaintiff firm, bore out that statement
and added that he had twenty-two years'
experience. The penny was sent by reg
istered letter in wadding. That was the
usual method of transit for coins and this
was the lirst one ta t had been damaged. !
He produced the coin.
His Honorâ Do you call that a coin? It
is as thin as a piece of tissue paper. Was
it originally thin?
Mr. Spink said it was originally thin,
and in answer to further question's from
his Honor' said it was English and dated
about 900. Dr. Cresswell said he was a col
lector of coins and other curiosities He
was desirous of having the coin in ques
tion and received it by registered post en
approval. Ultimately he decided to send
it back to the plaintiffs and put it in some
wadding and inclostd it in a small envel
ope. He then put it between his finger
and thumb and telt it, to make sure It had
not slipped oat, and he felt it crumble
away. He used no undue pressure. He
put it in a box and returned it to the
plaintiffs. Mr. Jones submitted that under
the sale of goods act the defendant was
liable. He had adopted the article. Fur
ther, he was negligent in pressing the
coin and breaking it. He then proceeded
to cite cases in support of his contention
tnat defendant was liable as a bailee for
award. His Honor decided against Mr.
Jones throughout. This old penny had
kept together over 900 years and then the
time came when it fell to pieces, and he
believed it received a shock to the system
in the post. He was of the opinion that a
registered envelope was not v safe way of
sending it, and he found for the defendant,
with costs. â London Times.

ENCINAL YACHT CLUB
Opening of the Season Marred by
High Winds and Choppy
Seas.
Second Pr eduction of the Operetta to a
Crowded House â More Fire
Exits.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 19.â The En
cinal Tacbt Club opened its season yester
day afternoon by tendering & reception to
its many friends at their club house. Old
Boreas was not invited, but he came along,
however, with a driving gale and a choppy
sea that made the onlookers shiver in
their friezes, restricted the number of
sight-seers and curtailed the afternoon's
programme considerably. The Commo
dure's El JSueno, not having forgotten
her early appetite for the mud, refused to
leave her winter quarters at High street :
consequently the parade as arranged for
did not come off. Vice-Commodore E. K.
Taylor and Stanley Btephenaon on the
Emerald and Captain Hanley on the
"Caprice" contrived to interest the spec
tators with their skill and daring. S.
Stephenson fell off the Emerald into the
water and continued to swim until he got
into the yacht's skiff, which had been cut
loose.
He refused to be lifted out of the briny
by a boathook manipulated by one not in
the Know, but got into the skifl eventu
ally. Captain Hanley picked tip his painter
and chased after the Emerald, some three
miles out. Calculating the distance to a
hair's breaath he brought the Caprice
round to the wind, dropped the painter
and left Stephenson nothing to do but
step on board the Emerald. The captain's
skill was much applauded.
In the evening a much larger attendance
experienced the hospitality of the club.
F. R. Ziel, with stereopticon views of a
nautical nature: H. Melville of Oak
land, Alex Rosborough, the Philomela
Quartet, Acme Quartet, Captain John Leal
of the Bay City and Charles Hart rendered
a choice selection of songs. Afterward
dancing to the strains of Yanke's orches
tra concluded the festivities.
"The Kival Queens."
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 19.â Linderman
Opera-house was packed to the doors last
night long before the curtain was raised
for the second production of the operetta
"The Rival Queens." As might be ex
pected it ran more smoothly, and every
one was highly delighted with the per
formance. Miss Maud Brennan danced
the cachuca in a way that few profession
als ever excel. Tins little lady has also
the honor of being the first one to make a
voluntary contribution toward the fitting
out of the "Alameda bed," her gift being
a hot-water bottle and mackintosh sheet.
A great many remarks are current about
the want of proper fire exits in both the
Opera-house and Armory Hall.
If ever a hre should occur the loss of life
would be appalling, as tne stairways in
both halls are far too narrow and crooked
to allow of the galleries being emptied
readily and safely. It is said there is no
fire ordinance affecting the question, and
a conflict of opinion exists as to whose
duty it is to see that due provision is made
for minimizing such a danger.
The Encinal Hall Ball.:
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 19.â The TJ. 0.
R. M. ball in connection with the opening
of Encinal Hall last night was a great suc
cess. Over eighty couples took possession
of the floor till well into the early hours.
The music was supplied by A. Paulson's
band and Messrs. C. W. Petry, T. W. Ley
decker, F. Cattermole and W. Kalmass
duly attended to the comfort of the guests.
..Latest News -Notes.
ALAMEDA, Cal., April 19.â A man
named Peter May was lodged in the City
Jail this morning by Officer Keyes as being
a vagrant. ~
Information reached this city to-day
that the unfortunate man. F. 8. Koeppele,
who said he was robbed yesterday, and
later on was arrested as a lunatic, died
shortly after admission to the County Jail.
THE LANDLORD'S JOKE.
It la Harmless, and He Has Worked It
Many Years.
James F. Moses has been landlord of the
good, old-fashioned Bucksport tavern
known as the Robinson House for thirty
six years. Just how far back in history he
conceived the ingenious "April-fool" joke
is uncertain, but a gray-haired citizen was
caught by it on April 1 for the twenty
third consecutive year, according to un
doubted authority.
The hotel is of the old-style hospitable
front, with a piazza running the whole
length, from which open two large doors.
In winter these are protected by portable,
boxlike storm porches, about the width of
the doors and four teet deep. The door
opening into the office is in constant use,
and it is here that the trap for the unwary
is set.
As often as the Ist of April rolls around
tbe veteran hotel-keeper has the porch at
the office door moved ulong the piazza to
the left, so that it laces the blank broad
side of the house. Projecting sufficiently
to hide the office door from a person ap
proaching from up street, it makes the de
lusion more effectual.
The snare is hardly set before, perhaps,
up comes one of the grocery delivery
wagons. The driver leaps from his seat,
grabs two or three baskets and bundles,
stumbles up the steps, kicks the door open
and goes into the trap "all over," as the
heavy-weighted door slams behind him.
Next, probably, comes along one of the
leisure population, who thinks to drop in
and look over the paper and have a chat.
He opens the porch door deliberately and
shuts it behind him, carefully wipes his
feet and fumbles over tbe cold white clap
boards for the door-latch, and then remem
bers the old, old, but ever new joke.
The train is in, and along comes a pha
lanx of the knignts of the grip. Tbe leader
acutely recognizes the plot as one which
cost him many a cigar a year ago, and he
resolves to make a wholesale slaughter of
j the rest of "the boys." There are half a
i dozen or more, and by shrewd tactics he
! gets them in a group. "Now boys," says
i he, "let's all get in a bunch and pile into
the office all at once and holler, 'Hullo,
old Jed!' " All aeree to it. "Now charge! '
There is a rush, and in a second alt but
one are floundering in a confused heap in
the 4 by (J box, while the cause of the com
j motion slips into the best room and is well
I settled before the confused contingent gets
untangled and with battered hats and
wrath in their eyes swarm in.
And so it|goes all day long. Landlord
Moses, from his chair in the reading-room.
chuckles and haw-haws at the success ol
hiÃ little scheme, although it is whispered
i that he was by a very deep-laid plot in-
I veigled into his own traphimSelf, and that
' he had to go down cellar and bring up
| something to square matters. â Lewiston

Entertains St. Ignatius.
Personal Notes.
John W. McAlpin of San Luis Obispo
County, Cal., and Miss Alice E. Blake,
daughter of the late Dr. James of this City,
were married last Wednesday evening at
the residence of the bride's mother, 1844
Geary street. It was a family affair, only
relatives and a few intimate friends being
present.
The parlors were beautifully decorated
with orange blossoms, white roses and
srailax, with a handsome floral bell in tte
front bow-window, under which the cere-
mony was performed.
The bride, looking most charming in
pure white, was given away by her brother,
Dr. Charles K. Blake, the rua:d of honor
being Miss Ada C. Tracy, while the
groom's brother, Alan McAlpin, acted as
best man. The marriage service was con
ducted by the Rev. W. M. Kiley of St.
Paul's Episcopal Church.
After a sumptuous banquet the happy
couple, amid showers of rice, left for parts
unknown.
The residence of Mrs. M. Edwards, 328
Golden Gate avenue, was the scene of a
very pretty wedding Wednesday evening,
April S, the contracting parties beinsr Fred
erick J. Harper and Florence E. Edwards, both
of this City. The parlors and dining-room
were handsomely decorated in pink and white.
Rev. Father Pendergast of St. Mary's per
formed the ceremony.
Miss Frances Edwards, sister of the bride,
officiated as maid of honor, nnd A. Sangster
was best man. John C. Edwards gave the
bride awnv.
The bride wore an elegant white silk gown,
elaborately trimmed with pearl passementerie,
and carried a bouquet of lilies of the valley.
Miss Frances Edwards wore a very pretty
pink silk gown. The yoke was made perfectly '
plain, and the corsage was handsomely
trimmed with lace. Her bouquet was com
posed of long-stemmed La France roses.
After the ceremony congratulations were
showered on the happy couple, and then the |
guests repaired to the dining-room, where an j
elaborate wedding feast was served. At 12
o'clock, nmid a Fhower of rice, old shoes, etc.,
thÂ»- bridal party left for the Hotel Longworth.
The wedding presents, consisting of silver
ware, ornaments, etc., ware numerous and
handsome.
The Winter Cotillon Club held its final as
sembly Friday evening, April 17. at Beethoven
Hall, Hotel-Savoy building. The hall was fairly
filled with ihe members of the club, which has
proved so successful in its first season, and by
the time the merry throne were ready to exe
cute the complicated figures of the german a
goodly number of spectators had assembled.
Promptly at 11 o'clock the dancers seated
themselves and the leading; set formed for the
dissolving circles. "The Driving" and "My
Lady's Handkerchief" figures followed. The
german was led by George E. Bennett with
Mira Eva Fairweather and the figures wore ad
mirably executed. The driving figure was
especially line, over thirty couples taking part
in the same. The dancing of the evening pre
ceding the german was under the management
of Mr. H. Scott, who led the grand marcn with
Miss Smith, followed by about forty couples.
This getmaii proved the most successful of
the season, and great credit is due the com
mittees who hnve managed the four affairs,
each of which has proved most enjoyable both
to participants and spectators. The ciuo will
reorgauize the latter end of the year for the
season of ltiO6-97.
A most enjoyable affnir took place Saturday
evening, April 11, at the residence of Mr. and
Mr.'. Ralph Leon, the occasion being the com
ing of age of their on!y son, Samuel R.Leon.
A series of prettily posed living pictures were
most thoroughly appreciated by those present.
A most elaborate banquet followed, in which
the health of the young man was drunk in
bumpers of champagne. Dancing and music
were indulged in until 3 a. m.
A very pleasant reception was tendered by
Mrs. M. Simpson to her many friends last
Wednesday evening. Vocal and" instrumental
selections contributed largely to the evening's
entertainment, the most delightful of which
were the duets by the Misses Frances Scheuren
and Dora Thompson. Games followed, after
which an eiegant supper brought the festivi
ties to a close. Among those present were:
Miss Hazel Beatty. Miss Nita Hawthorne,

LADY BLEBSINGTON.
She Failed to Slake " Her Mark as an
' â¢ 'J^. ' Authoress. â *â¢''â¢â ':â¢'
"The most generous Lady Blessington,"
as she was christened by her very old ad
mirer, Dr. Parr, has long since passed into
the regions of oblivion for the general
world. As an authoress she never suc
ceeded in making any mark, though she
worked at the business as hard as any of
her successors of the present day. Her
novels were many and fashionable, Mrs.
Gore-like in taeir methods, and filled with
strange and wandering scraps of French.
She edited books of beauty for fancy clients
and at fancy prices; and when the Daily
News was first started, under the editor
ship of Charles Dickens, she was offered an
engagement as a purveyor of fashionable
intelligence, and asked Â£800 a year for
it. She was offered either Â£400 "as a cer
tainty or Â£250 for six months on approval,
and confidently chose the latter, with the
melancholy result at the end of the term,
Dickens having in the meantime retired
from his uncongenial work, and John For
ster having accepted his post ad interim,
she was informed that her services were
no longer wanted.
She fought for her hand hard enough in
later days, poor lady, after years of Ara
bian Night luxury with ncr magnificent
husband; but we fear that her position in
the literery world was not at any time one
of solid security. Privately, she lived under
a cloud from the scandal which always
connected her name with Count d'Orsay,
and we suppose not without reason.
At ail events they never appear to have
taken any steps "to defend themselves
against the charges of papers like The Age,
which anticipated a similar class of jour
nals that sprang up in our own day, and
rather suffered judgment by default. â The
Spectator. '

OIL AND WATER
MAY YET MIX
Proposed Fusion Between
Democrats and Popu
lists Talked Of.
IN SEVEN DISTRICTS.
Max Popper and John Foley
Think It Would Be a
Strong Ticket.
FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
Proposal That the Democrats Take
Three Representatives and
the Populists Four.
Certain secret conferences between per
sons high in the councils of the Demo
cratic party and persons close to tbe pow
ers behind the throne in the Populist
party have been noted recently.
In these behind-curtain tete-a-tetes not
more than three on a side have been en
gaped, and when the cabalistic six sepa
rated and wended their ways homeward
they exchanged nods and winks, the full
import of which could be understood only
by the initiated.
These meetings were invested with the
most profound secrecy, as though the fate
of the empires were at stake, and it was
only within the past day or two that The
Call succeeded in unearthing the gopher
that had been burrowing so long in
Becrecy. In brief, the subject discussed in
these behind-the-curtain meetings, was
that of a fusion on the Congressional
ticket.
It has not been definitely settled as to
which side made the overtures, but the
matter is said to be under serious consid
eration by leaders of the Democratic and
the Populist parties. The plan outlined
was this: That the Democrats would not
make any nominations in the odd-num
bered Congressional districts, and that the
Populists would not put up any candi
dates in the even-numbered districts. It
is understood that the scheme is under
favorable consideration and that the fol
lowing ticket was made up at the confer
ences as an object lesson of the plan pro
posed :
First Congressional Districtâ George
W. Monteith (Populist).
Second Congressional District âA.
Caminetti (Democrat).
Third Congressional District â Judge
F. M. Gibnon (Populist).
Fourth Congressional Districtâ Judge
Maguire (Democrat).
Fifth Congressional District â Mayor
Sutro.
Sixth Congressional District â George
Patton (Democrat) of Los Angeles.
Seventh Congressional District â JT. L.
Gilbert (Populist) of Fresno.
At the last Congressional election in the
First District Barham (R.) received 15,101
votes; Geary (D.) 13,570, and Grigsby
(Pop.) 7246. In proportion to its voting
strength this is the strongest Populist dis
trict in the State. It contains a large
laboring aud farming vote among agri
culturists and lumber men in Sonoma,
Mendocino, Humboldt, Del Norte, Shasta
and Siskiyon. as well as miners in the
Sierra Nevada mountains. Railroad em
ployes have a large vote in that district,
but the remainder of the vote is nearly all
agricultural, and it is a strong anti-rail
road district. The Populists allege that
Barham, the present representative, is a
railroad man, but tnis is denied by the
Democrats. The Populists lay mucn stress
on the fact that his cards were allowed to
be tacked up in the railroad shops, while
those of Grigsby, the Populist candidate,
were not allowed within the limits of the
railroad yards.
In the Second District Cammetti expects
to bury Johnson by 10,000 or 15,000 major
ity. Those engineering the matter want
to make a hot fight in Johnson s dis
trict, such a Waterloo for C. P. Huntington
that no Congressman will ever undertake
to go against his solemn pledges ana the
will of the people again as the Populists
say that Johnson did.
Judge Gibson indicated his popularity in
the Third District two years ago by running
4000 to 5000 ahead of his ticket, so that the
combined vote would give him a very large
majority.
In the Fourth Judge Maguire would poll
a very strong vote, say the Democrats, and
with the combined strength of the fusion
would receive an enormous majority.
The friends of Mayor Sutro are confi
dent that he could easily beat Loud in the
Fifth two to one. should the fusion be
come a fixed fact. If Sutro' s vote for
Mayor be a criterion, they say that he
would probably have the biggest majority
of any Congressman ever elected from the
State.
The friends of Mr. Patton in the Sixth
expect that with his splendid anti-railroad
record he would beat McLachlan without
difficulty.
Gilbert in the Seventh is a strong man
with the Populists and made a fine run
two years ago.
In the early stages of the conference a
combination on the legislative ticket was
spoken of, but as the Populists would stick
to Cator under all circumstances it was
not deemed advisable to keep the proposi
tion standing.
Mr. Monteith was asked last night as to
his opinion of the proposed plan. He
vehemently disclaimed all knowledge of
it, and declined to express any opinion on
the matter until he had time to think it
over. The ticket seemed to him to be a
good one, except the name of tbe candi
date from the First District, whom he
could not consistently support. This is
supposed to be facetiousness.
Max Popper of the Rainey-Junta wing
of the Democracy said that he had not yet
been consulted and he was not conversant
with the proposed plan except that Tavlor
Kodzers had suggested that it might work

REMARKABLE SCENE IN THE FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH IN OAKLAND YESTERDAY MORNING DURING THE
SERMON OF PROFESSOR GRIGGS.
A madman named Lewis Porter advanced toward the preacher and began an excited harangue. When Colonel Irish and
Judge Yule went toward him he drew a pistol on them, but Irish dashed it out of his hand, and a panic ensued,
that was only ended after Porter had been handed over to the police.
well if the Democrats did not put up any
candidate in the Fifth and the Populists
should return the favor by leaving tne
Fourth vacant.
"The proposed' fusion ticket," added
Mr. Popper, "is a strong one, but the ob
jection that 1 see to it is the fact that the
Populists would get four districts and the
Democrats only three. Patton is a first
class man, but he would have the united
opposition of the A. P. A."
Ex-Supervisor John Foley was in favor
of the proposed fusion. He thought that
the whole Congressional ticket could be
elected.
LIBERTY CYCLERS' RACE
C. H. Parks Won Their Five-
Mile Event and H. Wahnig
Made Best Time.
Special Meeting of the Association to
Be Held This Week to Settle
the Relay Trouble.
The Liberty Cycling Club held a five
mile handicap road race yesterday over
the course from San Mateo to San Carlos.
The road was fairly good, but a strong
head wind the first two miles before a
turn southwardly is made prevented very
fast time.
There were twelve contestants, and C. H.
Parks, a one-armed rider, won with 1 min
ute 40 seconds handicap. The fastest
time was 13:57, made by H. Wahnig, who
finished second from scratch. F. R.
Haley, the other scratch man, came in
third, one second behind Wahnig. He
fell crossing a railroad track, but was un
hurt and remounted. A large number of
the club members rode down to see the
finish of the race, led by Captain Beattie.
Harry F. Terrill of the Bay City Wheel
men went to Santa Rosa yesterday to train
on the new track there for the race on May
2. He will be followed later in the week
by C. S. Wells, T. S. Hall, F. L. Day and
others of the same club, and several of the
Olympic Wheelmen will also go.
A great many wheelmen went to the
Park yesterday, while several of the clubs
had runs to the country. The Camera
Club Cyclists went to San Jose, Califor
nias to Tocolomo, San Franciscos to Lake
Pilarcitos, Imperials to Santa Rosa and
Reliance to Point Bonita. The members
of the Olympic Cyclers were out training
for their road race next Sunday, in which
there will be fully thirty contestants.
B. D. Blakeslee, the transcontinental
record-breafcer, who rode in the relay race
for the Imperial Club, returned to Chicago
day before yesterday.
Â£. Ross Lozier left for the East last night
on a business trip.
The dispute over the relay cup seems
likely to be settled this week. President
White of the Associated Clubs has decided
to call a special meeting of the association
for either Thursday or Friday evening of
this week, when both sides of the trouble
will be presented and an adjustment of the
difficulty may be reached.
The Bay City Wheelmen will have a
strong case when they go before the asso
ciation, and are rapidly gaining sympa
thizers. President Kerrigan's long letter
to the road-racing committee, published
exclusively in The Call Saturday, was a
clear, concise statement of their side of the
case, ana shows the matter in a different
light from what it has appeared in hereto
fore.
It is now generally understood that the
Acme man, Squires, and not Foster, the
Olympian, was to blame for the collision
near the finish. This does not relieve
the doubt, though, as to whether Foster
could have beaten Wells across the tape,
barring the accident.
President White of the association has
received several letters asking which club
officially won the race, that several bets on
the result may be settled. As the associa
tion does not recognize betting and dis
courages it as much as possible he has
replied that the Bay City Wheelmen fin
ished first, but have since'been disqualified
and the cup awarded to the Garden City
cyclers, and the bettors must settle it
among themselves. Such wagers as were
made petween individual members of the
Bay Citys and Olympics have been paid
by the latter, it being generally conceded
that the Bay Citys won.
Many of the flying squirrel's peculiari
ties are to be found in a curious little
lizard which is common in India, Java
and Borneo, known as the "flying
dragoon." This little creature's six first
false ribs are greatly elongated, and sup
port a wing-like expansion of skin, which
when stretched serves to bear it up.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1896.
SOME FLORAL BEAUTIES
The Cold Snap Did Not Damage
the Flowers and Plants
in the Park.
THE ROSE-COLORED OBSIDIAN.
A Contribution to the Museum From
the Straits Settlement â Palms
Around the Court.
The recent cold snap had no serious
effect on the fioral beauties that flourish in
Golden Gate Park and the thousands who
visited the people's grand garden yester
day viewed with delight the many-colored
flowers that are set out in the different
sections to make them most attractive.
There is one thing above all others that
San Francisco can boast of, and that is the
product of the flower garden : not only the
blossoms that are produced in the hot
houses, but those that grow in the open at
all seasons of the year. These are the
pride of all who produce them and the
envy of those who come from the countries
where beautiful flowers are known only
during a short season each year.
While the beauties thrive in the open air
the more delicate ones cultivated in the
park are reared and nurtured in the im
mense conservatory, which contains
many rare plants and blossoms. There
are orchids in full bloom that are
part of what is admitted to be the finest
collection in the United States. Notably
among those now on exhibition is the
Java beeflower, so named from its sup
posed resemblance to a bee, and the
lady's slipper, the latter of many bright
hues. There is also on exhibit a beautiful
collection of the lady's satchel in many
shades and variety of color.
"If people would only take a little time
to study blossom and foliage," said Head
Gardener Holbrow yesterday, "they would
find much to interest and instruct them.
Here, for instance," he said, as he pointed
to a plant that is sending its shoots up
ward, "is something that but few notice,
yet it is an extraordinary plant. It is the
Japanese trailing fern, the only one of the
fern family that trails, as does the smilax,
and so little do people know about foliage
that it is safe to say that almost every one
who chances to glance at this will go away
with the idea that he or she has been loos
ing at smilax.
"Talking of ferns," continued the fore
man, drawing attention to a growth at the
entrance to the western end of the conserv
atory and under the shade of a tall bush,
the Hibiscus Rosa Sinensis, which bears a
handsome red tlower that is the pride of
the women of Mexico, who use it to co
quettishly dress the hair, "here is an
other curiosity, and it comes from the Ha
waiian Islands."
The object pointed to looks like an im
mense bowl made of long light-green
leaves.
"That,' 1 said Mr. Holbrow. "is called the
birds-nest fern because it is in the shape
of a very large nest. It always retains its
present shape, new leaves taking the place
of those that die."
Entering the space under the great dome
Mr. Holbrow drew attention to a growth
that has at its foot a sign on which is
painted, "Papyrus Antiqnorumâ Ancient
Paper Plant of Egypt," and said: "That
is a remarkable plant, not because it is
the plant of which the ancients made
paper, but because it is an historical one.
The little sign at the foot does not draw
much attention to it, but if one was sub
stituted announcing that it is what grows
on the banks of the Nile and is of the kind
of bulrushes in which Moses was found in
a basket by Pharaoh's daughter there
would be so many people stop to look at it
that the walk would be blocked all day."
There was a large number of people
around the bandstand listening to the
music, and the auditors were particularly
charmed with the trombone solo of F. K.
Tobin.
The addition to the museum is rapidly
nearing completion, and it is expected
that in a month it will be ready for the
public.
There has been received for the museum
a very interesting collection of ninety -one
specimens from the Selangor Museum, at
Selangor, Straits Settlement, which will
be placed in the natural history depart
ment.
"This," said Curator Wilcomb, holding
up a small piece of volcanic glass, "i 3 a
very rare specimen of obsidian. As you
see, it is rose-colored, and is full of small
bubbles, such as you sometimes see in ice.
It comes from the Yukon in Alaska, and
is something entirely new. Obsidian, as
we know it, is black, but this is a stranger
to mineralogists."
The specimen when viewed under a pow
erful glass shows a number of globules of
uniform size that look like little balls of
quicksilver. When the specimen is held
to the sun it shows a beautiful play of
colors as striking as those of the finest
opal.
A triple row of palms has been planted
all around the grand court, the trees divid
ing the portions of the grand circle set
apart for pedestrians, vehicles and cyclers.
There was a large crowd at the beach
and Sutro baths were crowded, the great
attraction being the Chinese troupe of
actors and their wonderful costumes, which
are said to be the richest that have ever
been worn by Chinese actors in this City.
The top dressing in the great highway is
beins placed on the coarser rock, and it
will not be long before the boulevard is
ready for travel.
At the Haight-streets ground there were
a great many people. They were delighted
with the Japanese fireworks, some sixty
pieces being sent up, but they were disap
pointed because the balloon ascension was
not a success. The uphere rose about sev
enty-five feet, when it became cranky,
turned head down and dragged over the
trolley tower. Markeburg, who hung to
the trapeze about fifteen feet from the
ground, had a narrow escape from being
dashed against the tower. As a result of
the collision a part of the tower was torn
away and an electric-light wire damaged.

COLONEL IRISH TO THE RESCUE
Members of the Congregation Struggle
With the Stranger and Fin
ally Overpower Him.
Oaklakd Office Ban Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, April 19. j
A lunatic with a gun cleared out nearly
all the worshipers in the First Unitarian
Church this morning. For several min
utes there were intense excitement and a
hurried rush to the doors, but when Col
onel Irish and Judge Yule were seen lead
ing a wilk-lookiug man out the congrega
tion was induced to return and the service
was concluded.
The mad man, who afterward gave the
name of Lewis Porter, went into the
cnurch as soon as service commenced and
took a seat alongside the aisle, about half
way toward the altar. His nervous man
ner and peculiar actions engaged the at
tention of several members of the congre
gation from the first.
Her kept looking behind him and side
ways, and many times rose partly from his
seat and sat down again. His eyes be
trayed intense emotion and his lips worked
as though he was in a fit. Those who sat
near him did not appreciate their neigh
bor, but they decided to tolerate him
rather than to move to a more agreeable
seat.
The opening exercises passed without
anything of note occurring and the first
hymn was sung. Professor Craig of Stan
ford and Dr. Wendte, the pastor, ex
changed pulpits this morning and the pro
fessor read an extract that was to form
the basis of a sermon. Every word seemed
to sting the stranger and bis lips and eyes
worked and trembled more nervously
than ever. Only a few noticed it, however,
and the great mass of the congregation
were totally unprepared for the scene that
followed.
After Professor Craig had finished read
ing he gave out the second hymn and it
was sung by the choir and congregation.
A lady offered the visitor a hymn-book, but
he merely took it ana placed it in the pew
pocket and the look of disgust with which
it was received made the lady wish she
had been less thoughtful and generous.
At the conclusion of the hymn the stran
ger arose from his seat and walked down
the aisle till he reached the altar. As he
walked down he said in a loud voice:
"This thing is all a farce. It's a hum
bug. Now I want to have my say and it
won't be well for anybody to attempt to
stop me."
The congregation was thunderstruck
with astonishment. Such a scene in an
orderly and a fashionable church had
never been dreamed of, even by the wildest
penny-dreadful romancers.
People caught their breath and held it,
half in awe at the wonderful daring of this
stranger. He paused only an instant and
then went on with hi 3 harangue.
"This is all a fraud and a sham," he re
peated, "and I don't mean to stand it any
longer. You can't prove by Professor Le
Conte and President Jordan that men are
descended from the lower animals."
He waved his hands and spoke excitedly
and swiftly. It takes long to tell it, but
it happened all in much less than a full
minute. As he spoke he advanced toward
the pulpit. By the time he had concluded
his wildly uttersd statements about the
origin of man end the lower animals his
feet had carried him, seemingly automatic
ally, alongside of where Colonel John P.
Irish sat. On the opposite aide of the
aisle was Judge Yule.
"Men are not animals!" shouted the
maniac, and at the same instant both
Colonel Irish and Judge Yule rose and
ntepped in front of him.
Then the remarkably dramatic incident
reached its denouement.
To the utter horror and amazement of
the congregation and preacher the mad
stranger now calmly put his hand in his
pocket and drew out a loaded revolver.
With this movement Irish and Yule
sprang forward. The madman never
raised his pistol arm until he reached the
City Prison.
Irish acted instinctively and instantly,
and in a space of time too small to calcu
late he had struck the madman's arm a
terrific blow and the pistol lay on the floor.
Judge Yule was almost as quick, and in
less tnan a second the belligerent stranger
was being forced rapidly down the aisle
toward the outer door, securely pinioned
by Irish, Yule and S. P. Hall.
As soon as Porter reached his pistol
pocket the rush commenced. The mem
bers who had watched the man from the
beginning of the service led the stampede
and the whole church wa3 plunged into
confusion. Several minutes elapsed be
fore order was restored after the madman
had been handed over to the police.
After the service Colonel Irish, Judge
Yule and Mr. Hall were congratulated on
all sides. Professor Craig preached an
eloquent discourse, but nobody could tell
what it was about this afternoon, and the
adventure of the lunatic with the gun are
all that will live of this morning's service.
At the City Prison it was made very evi
dent that Porter was a religious fanatic
whose brain is deranged. He said he was
displeased with the service and that the
teachings of Starr-King and the Unitarian
church were cursing the age and that
those who would not listen to the truth as
would he tell it deserved to be shot.
Porter does not appear to be so much of
a Junatic as an abnormal fanatic. He is
not violent at all and calmly submitted to
be led out of the church. He converses
rationally on subjects other than religion,
and says he would not have attempted to
kill anybody unless they tried to stop him
from proclaiming the truth. He says that
Colonel Irish was altogether too smart,
and hinted that the church was no place
for men of his activity.
Nobody knows who' Porter is and no one
ever saw him before. He is charged with
disturbing a religious meeting and with
carrying concealed weapons, but it is prac
tically certain that his future residence
will be Agnews.
